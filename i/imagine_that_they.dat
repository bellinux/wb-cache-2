25|$|Ancient authors {{seemed to}} believe, incorrectly, that sling-bullets could {{penetrate}} armour, and that lead projectiles, heated by their {{passage through the}} air, would melt in flight. In the first instance, {{it seems likely that}} the authors were indicating that slings could cause injury through armour by a percussive effect rather than by penetration. In the latter case we may <b>imagine</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were impressed by the degree of deformation suffered by lead sling-bullet after hitting a hard target.|$|E
25|$|Another {{argument}} Al-Khoei {{brings up}} {{in favor of}} the Quran is that by the time ‘Uthman became caliph, Islam had spread {{to such an extent that}} it was impossible for him, or even for anyone more powerful than him, to remove anything from the Quran. The value and importance of the Quran during this time protected it from being altered. In the oral culture at this time, people paid great attention to memorizing pre-Islamic Arabic poetry, it is hard to <b>imagine</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> did not pay similar attention to the preservation of the Book of the Almighty, especially since they believed they would be rewarded in the hereafter for memorizing it. Uthman could have altered the text, but he would have been unable to remove the Quran from the hearts of the Muslims who had memorized it.|$|E

25|$|Articulated {{thoughts}} in stimulated situations (ATSS): ATSS is a paradigm {{which was created}} {{as an alternative to}} the TA (think aloud) method. This method assumes that people have continuous internal dialogues that can be naturally attended to. ATSS also assesses a person’s inner thoughts as they verbalize their cognitions. In this procedure, subjects listen to a scenario via a video or audio player and are asked to <b>imagine</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are in that specific situation. Later, they are asked to articulate their thoughts as they occur in reaction to the playing scenario. This method is useful in studying emotional experience given that the scenarios used can influence specific emotions. Most importantly, the method has contributed to the study of personality. In a study conducted by Rayburn and Davison (2002), subjects’ thoughts and empathy toward anti-gay hate crimes were evaluated. The researchers found that participants showed more aggressive intentions towards the offender in scenarios which mimicked hate crimes.|$|E
500|$|On Chanukah, Grandma Minka reads a {{book about}} the meaning of the holiday to the babies Tommy, Chuckie, Phil, and Lil. The babies <b>imagine</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are the story's characters; Judah (Tommy) is outraged by King [...] "Antonica", who has taken over the Jewish kingdom and forced Greek culture on its inhabitants. Judah leads an army of Jewish Maccabees to war against Antonica's Seleucid Empire, {{emerging}} victorious. The story is left unfinished as Minka stops to help make latkes in the kitchen with her daughter Didi.|$|E
500|$|The first {{occurrence}} {{of this is}} in the episode [...] "A Rugrats Passover," [...] which originally aired in the United States on April 13, 1995. In the episode, Tommy {{and the rest of the}} Rugrats, accompanied by their respective parents, attend a Passover seder hosted by Boris and Minka. Boris and Minka have an argument and Boris storms off to the attic, where the Rugrats find him and discover they are now locked in. To pass time, Boris recites the story of Passover. The Rugrats <b>imagine</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are the characters in the story, including Tommy as Moses and his mean-spirited cousin Angelica as the Pharaoh of Egypt.|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the emotional response in a disjunction condition. Participants were presented with a hypothetical three-condition scenario in which <b>they</b> <b>imagined</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> had submitted their application for admission to two universities. In the two conditions of certainty, the participants <b>imagined</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were either accepted by University A or rejected by University A. In the uncertain condition, the participants <b>imagined</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> {{did not know whether}} they had been accepted or rejected by University A. These three conditions formed a disjunction condition. The results suggested that the participants felt less happy under the uncertain condition than under the two conditions of certainty, regardless of whether the information presentation was non-transparent (Experiment 1 A) or transparent (Experiment 1 B) and regardless of whether the options in the two conditions of certainty were similar (Experiment 2 A) or substantially discrepant (Experiment 26 and Experiment 3). Experiment 3 further demonstrated that, consistent with the hedonic hypothesis, preferential choices (which constitutes a disjunction effect) are based on emotional responses in the disjunction condition. The underlying processes of the emotional response in the disjunction condition and its relation to the literature on risk and uncertainty aversion are discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V.

Alto Adige is Italian and bilingual, and no one would even dream of trying {{forcibly}} to Italianize these German immigrants. But neither may Germans <b>imagine</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> might push Italy back to Salorno and from there to the Lago di Garda. Perhaps the Germans believe that all Italians are like Credaro. If they do, they’re sorely mistaken. In Italy, there are hundreds of thousands of Fascists who would rather lay waste to Alto Adige than to permit the tricolore that flies above the Vetta d’Italia to be lowered. If the Germans have to be beaten and stomped to bring them to reason, then so be it, we’re ready. A lot of Italians have been trained in this business." ...|$|E

Participants’ PM perceptions were measured {{at the conclusion of the}} simulation. Results indicated that observers’ PM perceptions were lower than were virtual actors’ following the negative momentum sequence. More generally, interrupting positive momentum lowered PM perceptions, whereas interrupting negative momentum increased PM perceptions. Implications for the study of PM in sport are discussed...|$|R
