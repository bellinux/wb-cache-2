We {{present a}} new {{application}} of computer vision: continuous {{measurement of the}} <b>geometrical</b> <b>visibility</b> range on inter-urban roads, solely based on a monocular image acquisition system. To tackle this problem, we propose first a road segmentation scheme based on a Parzenwindowing of a color feature space with an original update {{that allows us to}} cope with heterogeneously paved-roads, shadows and reflections, observed under various and changing lighting conditions. Second, we address the under-constrained problem of retrieving the depth information along the road based on the flat word assumption. This is performed by a new region-fitting iterative least squares algorithm, derived from half-quadratic theory, able to cope with vanishing-point estimation, and allowing us to estimate the <b>geometrical</b> <b>visibility</b> range. ...|$|E
30|$|Owing to {{the need}} to develop {{computational}} resources for the organisation of large digital music libraries, the importance of automatic music classification systems has grown considerably in recent times (Pampalk et al. 2002). Many classification platforms have been proposed (Costa et al. 2012; Ezzaidi and Rouat 2008; Guaus 2009; Panagakis et al. 2009), and despite efforts to find a new path (Goulart 2012; Jennings et al. 2004), most feature extraction tools use knowledge of the audio signal processing field (Eronen 2009; Silla Jr et al. 2006; Tzanetakis and Cook 2002). The descriptors most commonly used in feature extraction are Mel Frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs), spectral rollof, spectral flux, zero crossing rate, and low-energy feature. These algorithms carry out their mathematical operations in the time–frequency domain in order to extract three basic characteristics of the musical signal: tone texture (timbre), rhythmic content (time, rhythm, pulse), and tonal content (pitch). In contrast, we propose a way to categorise polyphonic 1 signals using a topological property of complex networks in this paper, and therefore do not use the same principles traditionally adopted in the analysis of an audio signal. To realise this idea, we first captured the loudness of the audio signal from a calculation of the average intensity of its fluctuations in fixed-size windows (Jennings et al. 2004), creating a series of variance fluctuations of the original signal. After this, we mapped this series onto a graph using the <b>geometrical</b> <b>visibility</b> mapping proposed by (Lacasa et al. 2008). In this mapping, if two points of the series ’see each other’ in the Cartesian plane, an edge is created in the Euclidean plane. Thus, if the visibility of a point in the series is higher, it will have more edges in the graph. At the end of the mapping, the graph inherits the visibility of all local peaks with their respective neighbourhoods within its structure (Lacasa and Toral 2010). Consequently, a variance fluctuation series with few local-but very visible-peaks, will generate graphs with few hubs, {{with a high degree of}} connections. On the other hand, a series with many local peaks with a poor visibility will generate graphs with many vertices with a lower level of connections. The analysis of the modularity will identify if the network structure was created from the series with a greater or smaller local visibility.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Computer {{vision is}} {{challenged}} by the underwater environment. Poor <b>visibility,</b> <b>geometrical</b> distortions and nonuniform illumination typically make underwater vision less trivial than open air vision. One effect which can be rather strong in this domain is sunlight flicker. Here, submerged objects and the water volume itself are illuminated in a natural random pattern, which is spatially and temporally varying. This phenomenon has been considered mainly as a significant disturbance to vision. We show that the spatiotemporal variations of flicker can actually be beneficial to underwater vision. Specifically, flicker disambiguates stereo correspondence. This disambiguation is very simple, yet it yields accurate results. Under flickering illumination, each object point in the scene has a unique, unambiguous temporal signature. This temporal signature enables us to find dense and accurate correspondence underwater. This process may be enhanced by involving the spatial variability of the flicker field in the solution. The method is demonstrated underwater by in-situ experiments. This method {{may be useful to}} a wide range of shallow underwater applications. I...|$|R
40|$|Speed {{diagrams}} {{of rural}} roads are an essential {{tool for the}} good geometric road design, for the control, in existing roads, of the <b>geometrical</b> layout characteristics (<b>visibility</b> distances, coordination between successive elements, the climbing lane for the heavy vehicles). Again they can be used, with information to vehicle weights, to improve sizing of safety barriers. These operations can be successfully performed if it will increase {{the knowledge of the}} speed characteristics in road sections with greater accident risk. There are many studies realized on driver speed, in the last two decades; the resulting values and relationships are different from each other. Every Country has an its own relationship that characterizes the behavior of drivers in road environment: {{it is not possible to}} define a single formula for different situations and different drivers. In the paper, in particular, it describes an experimental relationship obtained of the distributions of running speeds of vehicles recorded, in significant periods of time, in different conditions of geometric path and different provinces. The surveys were conducted on various two-lane roads and have allowed to identify a good relationship for the dependence of the operating speed of the layout geometrical elements not only with the free flow speed (FFS, 85 th-percentile) and the CCR (curvature change rate), but also with the road longitudinal gradient. It has used the measurements over 40 sections of rural roads with two-lane single carriageway, width greater than 7 meters, long straights and curvature radii greater than 100 meters. The roads are located in Italy, in the provinces of Grosseto, Caserta, Benevento, Cosenza and Naples, with different plan and elevation views of alignment. The environmental conditions of surveys have always been clear weather and daylight. The values obtained were interpolated with different relations and the results were compared with those obtained from other authors in the same geometric conditions...|$|R
