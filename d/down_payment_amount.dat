40|$|Rapid {{increases}} in house prices can make home ownership {{more difficult for}} prospective first-time home buyers by increasing the required <b>down</b> <b>payment</b> <b>amount</b> and, if the increases outpace income growth, by increasing the ratio of mortgage payments to income. In response to such constraints, households may seek a gift or loan from a family member to use {{as part of the}} down payment.; Family transfers for housing purchase may be useful in understanding the relationship between housing finance and housing markets. Gifts may play a critical role for some households in home purchase activity in real estate cycles.

Typically rehab lenders will only go to 65-70% ARV (After Repair Value), so if the borrower is bringing 10% into the deal, the gap funder would provide the other 20-25%, and take a 2nd position lien and often a portion of the profit.|$|R

A committee met in Paris on 9 February 1929 to pin <b>down</b> the German <b>payment</b> <b>amounts</b> and schedule.Owen D. Young, an American banker, chaired the group. Under pressure from the Americans, a revised settlement was defined in which the German debts were reduced and terms of payment made easier.|$|R
50|$|When Jacob Bishopp sold Anne Orthwood’s {{indenture}} to Lieutenant Colonel William Waters, he {{had assured}} Waters {{that as far}} as he knew Anne was in perfect health and still a virgin. At some point between April and June 1664, Waters became aware of Anne’s pregnancy, at which point he tried to cancel the sale and recover his <b>down</b> <b>payment</b> (the <b>amount</b> of which was never specified). Bishopp refused to take Anne back and return Waters' <b>down</b> <b>payment,</b> stating that the contract was valid and Waters had no legal obligation to support her. Waters believed that the contract was voidable because Bishop had provided a false description of Anne’s physical condition, since it was impossible for Anne to have not been pregnant {{at the time of the}} sale. Under English law (which was generally used in the colonies at that time), if a servant became pregnant before a master hired her, he was able to fire her from his household, but if she had conceived the child during her time in the new master's house, then the master had to continue to provide the necessities of life and was not permitted to turn her out. So in order to “fix” his bad purchase of Anne’s indenture, Waters had to convince a panel of five judges (his colleagues as he was also a justice of the peace) that he was not obligated to care for her as she did not become pregnant during her stay in his home, and sue Bishop for the return for his <b>down</b> <b>payment.</b>|$|R

5000|$|In the United States, <b>down</b> <b>payments</b> {{for home}} {{purchases}} typically vary between 3.5% and 20% {{of the purchase}} price. [...] The Federal Housing Administration, or FHA has advocated lower <b>down</b> <b>payments</b> {{since its inception in}} 1934, and currently, borrowers that qualify for an FHA loan pay only 3.5% for a <b>down</b> <b>payment.</b> With rising home prices in the years from 2000 to 2007, lenders were willing to accept smaller or no <b>down</b> <b>payment,</b> (either through 100% Financing, seller-assisted <b>down</b> <b>payment</b> assistance, government <b>down</b> <b>payment</b> providers, or by providing a combination of an 80% 1st and 20% second mortgages), so that more individuals could purchase homes as their primary residences. Currently, in the United States, the VA or Department of Veteran's Affairs, offers 100% financing for qualifying veterans. The USDA Home Loan program also offers 100% mortgage loans with no <b>down</b> <b>payment.</b> These loans are available as Direct or Guaranteed loans and are offered to qualifying borrowers purchasing a home in a more Rural Area. Most State Finance Housing Agencies offer <b>down</b> <b>payment</b> assistance. In 2013 the Agencies offer a program that provides assistance to qualifying homebuyers of up to 3% of the loan amount.

50|$|A <b>down</b> <b>payment</b> {{refers to}} the cash paid to the lender for the home and {{represents}} the initial homeowners' equity or financial interest in the home. A low <b>down</b> <b>payment</b> means that a home represents a highly leveraged investment for the homeowner, with little equity relative to debt. In such circumstances, only small declines {{in the value of}} the home result in negative equity, a situation in which the value of the home is less than the mortgage amount owed.

5000|$|A borrower's <b>down</b> <b>payment</b> {{may come}} {{from a number of}} sources. The 3.5% {{requirement}} can be satisfied with the borrower using their own cash or receiving a gift from a family member, their employer, labor union, or government entity. Since 1998, non-profit organizations have been providing <b>down</b> <b>payment</b> gifts to borrowers who purchase homes where the seller has agreed to reimburse the non-profit organization and pay an additional processing fee. In May 2006, the IRS determined that this is not [...] "charitable activity" [...] and has moved to revoke the non-profit status of organizations providing <b>down</b> <b>payment</b> assistance in this manner.

40|$|Previous {{research}} has focused on equity as a prime determinant of mortgage default propensities. This paper extends the analysis of mortgage default to include mortgages that require no <b>down</b> <b>payment</b> from the purchaser. A continuous time hazard model is used to estimate the conditional probability of a serious delinquency, or a claim, as a function of a host of standard control variables, and indicators for the presence and source of the <b>down</b> <b>payment.</b> The data consist of a nationally representative random sample of about 5, 000 FHA insured single family mortgages endorsed in Fiscal Years 2000, 2001, and 2002, observed through September 30, 2006, and samples of about 1, 000 FHA loans each from the Atlanta, Indianapolis, and Salt Lake City MSAs in the same time period. The results indicate that borrowers who provide <b>down</b> <b>payments</b> from their own resources have significantly lower default propensities than do borrowers whose <b>down</b> <b>payments</b> come from relatives, government agencies, or non-profits. Borrowers with <b>down</b> <b>payments</b> from seller-funded non-profits, who make no <b>down</b> <b>payment</b> at all, have the highest default rates. Additionally, borrowers who do not make <b>down</b> <b>payments</b> from their own resources tend to have higher loss given default in the small subset of loans that had completed the property disposition process. ...|$|R
