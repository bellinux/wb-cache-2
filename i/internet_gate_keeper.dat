50|$|She is {{the oldest}} <b>Gate</b> <b>Keeper</b> in Japan, having been born in 1169. However, she has stopped aging and appears in 1969 {{as a young girl}} in a white kimono (and again in <b>Gate</b> <b>Keepers</b> 21 without any trace of aging). Like her name Yukino suggests, she {{commands}} the Gate of Ice and Snow, being able to summon blizzards and hail. She {{is one of the most}} powerful <b>Gate</b> <b>Keepers</b> in the series, being referred to as a 'top-secret, High-Level <b>Gate</b> <b>Keeper</b> A.E.G.I.S. has been hiding' by Reiji Kageyama. One of her unique traits is the fact that she converses in Tanka poetry. She does help the A.E.G.I.S. members, despite being not an official member of A.E.G.I.S. She also has her pet ermine Hisame with her. She returns in <b>Gate</b> <b>Keepers</b> 21. In the game Yukino is actually a hidden character, but if she joins, she interacts more with the main characters and actually attends the same school as them (she joins the same class Fei is in) unlike the anime where she usually keeps her distance from the rest of the characters. Her Gate color is white.|$|R
