25|$|During the trial, {{the defense}} {{maintained}} their {{claim that the}} crash {{was the result of}} Alvarez's aborted suicide attempt and he never intended to hurt anyone, but prosecutors claimed he deliberately caused the crash in an attempt to get attention from his estranged wife, citing that he doused his SUV with gasoline beforehand. A relative of one of the victims questioned why Alvarez did not simply lie down on the tracks if <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>a</b> suicide attempt.|$|E
25|$|We {{were able}} to use archival pieces from Van Cleef & Arpels, which came with a {{revolving}} door of security guards. The jewelry schedule was very complicated, because pieces had to go from Switzerland to Paris, and the shooting schedule was changing constantly. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>a</b> house of cards. There were a couple of times we got caught, scenes got moved up, and lucky for me, Madonna was able to make available her personal jewelry. When you see Wallis spraying the flowers with perfume, her black and white pearl and diamond Bulgari earrings are Madonna's.|$|E

25|$|After the Khmer advance was checked, Anawrahta {{turned his}} {{attention}} toward Nanzhao. Anawrahta led a campaign against the kingdom in the northeast. (According to a mid-17th century source, he began the march on 16 December 1757.) He advanced to Dali, the capital of Nanzhao Kingdom, ostensibly to seek a Buddha's tooth relic. As {{in the case of}} the request for the scriptures from Thaton, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>a</b> demand for tribute. The ruler of Nanzhao shut the gates, and would not give up the relic. After a long pause, two kings exchanged presents and conversed amicably. The Nanzhao ruler gave Anawrahta a jade image which had come into contact with the tooth.|$|E
25|$|Gershwin's all-black opera {{was also}} unpopular with some celebrated black artists. Harry Belafonte {{declined}} to play Porgy {{in the late}} 1950s film version, so the role went to Sidney Poitier. Betty Allen, president of The Harlem School of the Arts, admittedly loathed the piece, and Grace Bumbry, who excelled in the 1985 Metropolitan Opera production as Bess, made the often cited statement: I thought it beneath me, I felt I had worked far too hard, that we had come far too far to have to retrogress to 1935. My {{way of dealing with}} it was to see that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>a</b> piece of Americana, of American history, whether we liked it or not. Whether I sing it or not, it was still going to be there.|$|E
25|$|The first {{skirmish}} of the New Zealand Wars was the 1843 Wairau Affray at {{the north}} end of the South Island. It was an isolated incident caused by the Nelson settlers trying to seize land they did not own, an extra-legal vigilante action that resulted in twenty-two of them being killed. The Flagstaff or Northern War took place in the far north of New Zealand, around the Bay of Islands, in March 1845 and January 1846. This was about mana—tribal prestige—and customs duties. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>a</b> war between rival Māori chiefs with the British fighting on one side for the prestige of the British Empire. This was followed almost immediately by the Hutt Valley Campaign, March to August 1846, and the Wanganui Campaign, April to July 1847, in the south-west of the North Island. Both these conflicts were about the encroachment of the European settlers onto Māori land. In the first three wars Māori fought the British to a standstill each time. From the engagements emerged an understanding: English law prevailed in the townships and settlements, and Māori law and customs elsewhere. There followed a period of relative peace and economic cooperation from 1848 to 1860.|$|E

25|$|One {{view is that}} it {{was only}} a partial success for non-caste Hindus (Avarnas) as they gained access only to the roads on three sides of the temple. The fourth and most {{important}} eastern road remained inaccessible to them. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>a</b> blow to the Christians and Muslims as they lost their previously enjoyed freedom to have complete access on all the roads around the temple. Now the eastern road was blocked to them. Because of the gates, which remained closed the members of the Devaswam Board and the inmates of the temple who used the eastern road as thoroughfare were denied the opportunity. Anyway, it was a great opportunity for the Indian National Congress party to grow in Kerala. Before this agitation, the Congress in Kerala was {{only a limited number of}} Upper Caste and Upper class people of Malabar (which was under British Rule). The Avarnas did not bother about the Congress, as the Congress leaders did not show any enthusiasm for the eradication of social inequalities. But when the party undertook to lead the agitation at Vaikom, the Avarnas underwent a sea of changes. At the exhortation of T. K. Madhavan, they joined the Congress en masse. The Congress swelled from being a class party to a mass party.|$|E

She invited producers and songwriters to accompany them, including Sia, Timbaland, Justin Timberlake and The-Dream.

You could go and jump in the pool and ride bikes... the ocean and grass and sunshine... <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>a</b> safe place." [...] She would spend the majority of her day with her newborn daughter, taking some hours out to record music. The album's opening track [...] "Pretty Hurts", co-written by Sia, was completed during these sessions. The project was suspended until 2013 and relocated to New York City's Jungle City and Oven studios where most of the album was recorded. In an interview for Vogue in January 2013, Jason Gay described Beyoncé's attention to detail as [...] "obsessive" [...] when observing her studio, noting the vision boards she created for inspiration, which contained potential song titles, old album covers and pictures of performances.|$|E
