40|$|A {{method for}} the {{analysis}} of the explosive triacetonetriperoxide (TATP) in ambient air is introduced. The high volatility of the peroxide leads to significant concentrations in the air surrounding even minute quantities of TATP, thus enabling the analyst to avoid direct contact with the sensitive explosive. Air sampling is performed using gas-washing bottles filled with acetonitrile and air sampling pumps at a flow-rate of 0. 6 l min− 1. A sampling and a back-up gas-washing bottle are connected in series to allow monitoring of possible breakthroughs in the sampling gas-washing bottle. After sampling, two different analytical methods were used: first, reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with subsequent post-column UV irradiation and electrochemical detection; and second, photochemical degradation of TATP with enzyme-catalyzed photometric detection. The limits of detection for 20 min of sampling time (12 l sample volume) were 190 ng l− 1 air for the photometric method and 550 ng l− 1 air for LC with <b>electrochemical</b> detection.

40|$|The {{disposal}} of ferric phosphate (FePO 4) sludge, routinely generated in wastewater and drinking water treatment, {{has a major}} impact on the overall treatment cost. Iron sulfide (FeSx) precipitation via sulfide addition to ferric phosphate (FePO 4) sludge has been proven to be an effective method for phosphate <b>recovery.</b> <b>Electrochemical</b> oxidation of FeSx can then be utilized to recover ferric iron for reuse back in the phosphate removal process. In this study, the reactivity of FeSx particles for anodic oxidation at pH 4 was studied as a function of time after FeSx precipitate generation at a S/Fe molar ratio of 1. 75. Cyclic voltammetry showed high reactivity for fresh FeSx particles, but the reactivity diminished significantly over a period of 1 month. X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) revealed that this reduced reactivity with time is a consequence of the transformation of the FeSx particles in suspension from mackinawite (FeS) to pyrite (FeS 2) ...|$|R

A {{thermodynamic}} study (Pourbaix type diagrams, {{using the}} software Hydra/Medusa) of acid leaching solutions {{to obtain the}} <b>electrochemical</b> <b>recovery</b> of Ni, Cu and Zn present in printed circuit boards is reported.

From this data, the reduction potentials were determined for each metal, finding the values of- 0. 0024,- 1. 1274 and- 0. 5892 V vs calomel for Cu, Ni and Zn, respectively.

Cyclic voltammetry and open-circuit potentiometry indicated the formation of several phases of Pr–Ni alloys. Alloy samples were prepared by one- or two-step potentiostatic electrolysis using a Ni plate electrode at various potentials. Scanning electron microscopy observations and X-ray diffraction measurements confirmed the formation of PrNi 2, PrNi 3, Pr 2 Ni 7, and PrNi 5.

40|$|We report potentiodynamic {{studies to}} {{characterize}} copper, nickel and zinc leaching solutions from electronic waste. The metals were leached using oxygen and sulfuric acid (pH = 1. 5). As is known, reduction potentials are determined using thermodynamics laws, and metal recovery strategies from electronic waste are usually considered according these thermodynamic values. Pourbaix‐type diagrams are not appropriate to plan strategies in electrochemical processing. Therefore, knowledge of electrode potentials for the metal deposit/dissolution {{process is the}} basis for the selective recovery planning. For this reason, potentiodynamic studies, specifically cyclic voltammetry, are revealed as a good way to decide the best conditions for the process of <b>electrochemical</b> <b>recovery</b> of metals from electronic waste, which is also cost‐efficient and has no interference from strange ions, such as lead, in this case...|$|E
40|$|An {{environmental}} friendly <b>electrochemical</b> detoxification and <b>recovery</b> process is {{developed for the}} spent SCR catalysts disposal under alkaline condition. It is revealed that the spent V 2 O 5 -WO 3 /TiO 2 catalyst is severely aggregated and poisoned by arsenic compounds. In this study, the efficient removal of arsenic is achieved by the electrochemical advanced oxidation processes (EAOPs) at surface-modified carbon felt cathode, where the HO 2 - and highly oxidative center dot OH are in-situ generated from two-electron ORR and electro-Fenton-like reaction, respectively. The mechanism of electrochemical arsenic extraction is systematically illustrated by employing the ESR measurements, and vanadium species induced electro-Fenton-like reaction is proposed. After electro-oxidative dissolution, the crystal structure and original composition of the catalyst support (TiO 2 and WO 3) are well maintained for recycle or subsequently re-fabrication process. After dipping active component on the detoxified catalyst, the regenerated catalyst shows a comparable SCR catalytic activity with the fresh sample. The present electrochemical strategy provides a promising approach for the spent catalysts utilization and further understanding for the in-situ generated reactive oxygen species in alkaline media.

40|$|This work {{reports the}} {{utilization}} of two methodologies for carbaryl determination in tomatoes. The measurements were carried out using an amperometric biosensor technique based on the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase activity due to carbaryl adsorption and a HPLC procedure. The electrochemical experiments were performed in 0. 1 mol L- 1 phosphate buffer solutions at pH 7. 4 with an incubation time of 8 min. The analytical curve obtained in pure solutions showed excellent linearity in the 5. 0 x 10 (- 5) to 75 x 10 (- 5) mol L- 1 range, with the limit of detection at 0. 4 x 10 (- 3) gL(- 1). The application of such a methodology in tomato samples involved solely liquidising the samples, which were spiked with 6. 0 x 10 (- 6) and 5. 0 x 10 (- 5) mol L- 1 carbaryl. Recovery in such samples presented values of 99. 0 and 92. 4 %, respectively. In order to obtain a comparison, HPLC experiments were also conducted under similar conditions. However, the tomato samples have to be manipulated by an extraction procedure (MSPD), which yielded much lower recovery values (78. 3 and 84. 8 %, respectively). On the other hand, the detection limit obtained was much lower than that for the biosensor, i. e., 3. 2 x 10 (- 6) g L- 1. Finally, the biosensor methodology was employed to analyze carbaryl directly inside the tomato, without any previous manipulation. In this case, the biosensor was immersed in the tomato pulp, which had previously been spiked with the pesticide for 8 min, removed and inserted in the <b>electrochemical</b> cell. A <b>recovery</b> of 83. 4 % was obtained, showing very low interference of the matrix constituents. (C) 2007 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

The immiscible phases in the electrolytic cell were NaCl and Na 2 O- 2 B 2 O 3 at 1173 K, and the metal feedstock to be recovered was either metal chlorides or metal oxides of Co, Cu, Mn and Ni. Metals could be successfully recovered as plated metal deposits and the formal redox reaction potentials were reported. Metals thermodynamic behaviour differences between the cells were analysed. Analysis of the metal deposits showed that the recovered metals were of high purity (∼ 99 %). This offers an alternative method to recycle valuable metals present in the growing e-waste stream...|$|E
40|$|High {{levels of}} {{potentially}} leachable toxic metals such as Pb, Cd, and Cr, in the ash residues require consideration of treatment technologies {{prior to disposal}} or utilization of the ashes in other applications.

The kinetics of the Pb, Cd, and Cr extraction were determined through a series of batch extraction studies. The specific incinerator design and the equilibrium conditions strongly influenced the ash matrix and the extraction kinetics.

40|$|International audienceThe {{platinum}} nanoparticles used as catalyst in Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells (PEMFCs) represent around 46 % of {{the cells}} total price {{and is one of}} the limitations for their large scale commercialization. The recycling of the platinum catalyst represents a good way to limit the production cost of PEMFCs. Usual recovery routes for platinum-containing catalysts are pyro-hydrometallurgical processes, combining a calcination step and an aqua regia treatment, generating fumes and NOx emission. An <b>electrochemical</b> <b>recovery</b> route by coupling electrochemical leaching and electrodeposition in ionic liquids (ILs) is proposed here, more environmentally friendly, performed in "soft" temperature conditions and without any gases emission. Imidazolium chloride ILs were selected for their complexing ability against platinum and their good electrochemical stability. They were used either pure or diluted in a low coordinating IL, BMIMTFSI (1 -butyl- 3 -methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl) imide). The electroleaching of massive platinum was first studied in several chloride-based ILs. BMIMCl (1 -butyl- 3 -methylimidazolium chloride) appeared to be the best of leaching media tested, as passivation phenomena were observed in other ILs. BMIMCl + BMIMTFSI melts were then tested, containing different BMIMCl amounts. A marked increase of the leaching rate with BMIMCl content is observed up to 0. 1 M. For contents higher than 0. 5 M, the leaching rate is comparable with the one obtained in pure BMIMCl. The study of the <b>electrochemical</b> <b>recovery</b> of leached platinum revealed that its electrodeposition is impossible in the electrochemical window of pure BMIMCl, due to its high chloride content. On the contrary, platinum electrodeposition was successful in BMIMCl + BMIMTFSI ILs melts for BMIMCl content up to 0. 1 M. ILs melts were then successfully used for platinum recovery from fuel cell electrodes. By further modulating the composition of the melt and the electrode potential control mode, it also appeared possible to simultaneously leach and electrodeposit platinum in a single cell process...|$|E
40|$|Leaching {{selectivity}} during {{metal recovery}} from complex electronic waste using a hydrochemical process is always {{one of the}} generic issues. It was recently improved by using ammonia-based leaching process, specifically for electronic waste enriched with copper. This research proposes electrodeposition as the subsequent approach to effectively recover copper from the solutions after selective leaching of the electronic waste and focuses on recognising the electrochemical features of copper recovery. The electrochemical reactions were investigated by considering the effects of copper concentration, scan rate and ammonium salts. The diffusion coefficient, charge transfer coefficient and heterogeneous reaction constant of the electrodeposition process were evaluated in accordance with different solution conditions. The results have shown that <b>electrochemical</b> <b>recovery</b> of copper from ammoniabased solution under the conditions of selective electronic waste treatment is charge transfer controlled and provide bases to correlate the kinetic parameters with further optimisation of the selective recovery of metals from electronic waste...|$|E

Cyclic Voltammetry (CV) provided qualitative evidence that palladium and platinum contained in an effluent with an acid chloride matrix could be deposited on a graphite cathode. Experimental techniques related to (i) {{the use of}} synthetic solutions (ii) the variation of potential scan ranges, (iii) {{the use of a}} witness ion (+ 3 Fe), and (iv) the use of glassy carbon or platinum disc working electrodes were used to assist with the interpretation of voltammograms. Exhaustive electrolysis experiments via a graphite working electrode demonstrated the recovery of palladium and platinum in the refinery effluent to concentrations of < 1 1 l mg −. Copper present in the effluent was co-deposited with the precious metals.

The nature of the silver deposit was studied using a Hull cell, and the current density range was selected for electrolysis to recover silver.

40|$|Recovery of {{selenium}} from copper-based {{sulfuric acid}} solution is of significant {{importance for the}} supply of this scattered metal. In order to overcome the drawbacks of high energy/reagents consumption and low recovery ratio in conventional processes, a cost-effective <b>electrochemical</b> <b>recovery</b> process of Se and Cu was first developed using low-cost stainless steel cathodes. It has been demonstrated that Se and Cu ions can be simultaneously electrodeposited, and the co-deposition is mass transport controlled quasi-reversible reaction. Consequently, a cylinder turbulent cell with larger surface area cathode was employed for the extraction of metals from dilute solution (2. 0 g/L Cu 2 + and 0. 3 g/L Se 4 +. Nanosized powder was obtained due to the excellent mass transport. 93. 2 % copper and 97. 6 % selenium was successfully extracted with a current efficiency of 81. 3 %. The as-prepared metal powder could be readily flushed and collected from the cell with water.

40|$|Wearable {{sensors and}} {{healthcare}} devices use small lightweight batteries to power their typical operations of monitoring and tracking. It becomes absolutely vital to effectively utilise {{all the available}} battery charge for device longevity between charges. The <b>electrochemical</b> <b>recovery</b> effect enables the extraction of more power from the battery when implementing idle times in between use cycles, and {{has been used to}} develop various power management techniques. However, there is no evidence concerning the actual increase in available power that can be attained using the recovery effect. Also, this property cannot be generalised on all the battery chemistries since it is an innate phenomenon, relying on the anode/cathode material. Indeed recent developments suggest that recovery effect does not exist at all. This paper presents experimental results to verify the presence and level of the recovery effect in commonly used battery chemistries in wearable sensors and healthcare devices. The results have revealed that the recovery effect significantly does exist in certain batteries, and importantly we show that it is also comprised of two different time constants.

40|$|During the {{previous}} funding cycle for this project, we investigated the electrochemistry of Cs(I) in air and moisture-stable ionic liquids both {{with and without}} the addition of BOBCalixC 6. These investigations revealed that the electrochemical windows of the dialkylimidazolium bis[(trifluoromethyl) sulfonyl]imide ionic liquids do not permit the direct electrochemical reduction of Cs(I), even when Hg electrodes are employed, because these organic cations are reduced at less negative potentials than Cs(I). However, Cs(I) coordinated by BOBCalixC 6 can be electrolytically reduced to Cs(Hg) in tetraalkylammonium-based room-temperature ionic liquids such as tri- 1 -butylmethylammonium bis[(trifluoromethyl) sulfonyl]imide (Bu 3 MeN+Tf 2 N-) at Hg electrodes. Because this reduction process does not harm either the ionic liquid or the macrocycle, it is a promising method for recycling the cesium extraction system. The previous studies mentioned above were carried out under an inert atmosphere, i. e., {{in the absence of}} H 2 O and O 2. However, it may not be economically feasible or even possible to carry out the recycling process in the absence of these contaminants during large-scale processing of aqueous tank waste. Thus, as described in our proposal, we have begun an investigation of the <b>electrochemical</b> <b>recovery</b> of Cs from the Bu 3 MeN+Tf 2 N- + BOBCalixC 6 extraction system in an air atmosphere containing various amounts of water and oxygen. Our recent preliminary results were very surprising because they indicated that the electrochemical extraction process is relatively insensitive to the presence of small amounts of moisture even when the moisture content of the ionic liquid approaches 1000 ppm. Furthermore, we have found that the ''wet'' ionic liquid can be easily dehydrated under reduced pressure or by sparging with dry nitrogen gas without the need for heat or any other specialized treatment...|$|E
