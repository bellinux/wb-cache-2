He is seen brandishing a gun and threatening to use <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> order. He can be seen on top of Collapsible B when the first funnel collapses. Lightoller was the most senior officer to have survived the disaster.|$|E
5|$|To be most {{effective}} at controlling a pest, a biological control agent requires a colonizing ability which allows <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> pace with changes to the habitat in space and time. Control is greatest if the agent has temporal persistence, {{so that it can}} maintain its population even in the temporary absence of the target species, and if it is an opportunistic forager, enabling it to rapidly exploit a pest population.|$|E
5|$|The Volt's {{battery is}} {{guaranteed}} by General Motors {{for eight years}} or , and will cover all 161 battery components. GM estimates that the Volt batteries will degrade by 10 to 30% after 8 years or 100,000 miles. GM has applied for a patent that may allow technicians to quickly and cheaply recover some {{of the performance of}} degraded battery packs. The Volt’s battery management system runs more than 500 diagnostics at 10 times per second, allowing <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> track of the Volt’s battery pack in real-time, 85% of which ensure the battery pack is operating safely and 15% monitor battery performance and life.|$|E

5|$|There {{have been}} {{subsequent}} claims by Tesla biographers that Edison and Tesla were the original recipients and that neither {{was given the}} award because of their animosity toward each other; that each sought to minimize the other's achievements and right to win the award; that both refused ever to accept the award if the other received it first; that both rejected any possibility of sharing it; and even that a wealthy Edison refused <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> Tesla from getting the $20,000 prize money.|$|E
5|$|Though Kentrosaurus likely {{stood with}} forelimbs erect like in other dinosaurs, it is {{hypothesised}} {{that the animal}} adopted a sprawling posture when defending itself. Its neck was flexible enough to allow <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> sight of predators, as it could reach the sides of its body with its snout and look over the back. In addition, the posterior position {{of the center of}} mass may not have been advantageous for rapid locomotion, but meant that the animal could quickly rotate around the hips by pushing sideways with the arms, keeping the tail pointed at the attacker. Kentrosaurus was nevertheless not invulnerable. A quick predator could have made it to the tail base (where the impact speed would be much lower) when the tail passed and the neck and upper-part of the body would have been unprotected by the tail swings. A successful predation of Kentrosaurus may have required group hunting. Compared to the more robust spikes of Stegosaurus, the thinner spikes of Kentrosaurus were at greater risk of bending.|$|E
5|$|Graf's {{unit was}} interned {{for over a}} week with more than 30,000 other {{disarmed}} soldiers in a primitive camp with minimal food and sanitation. Following {{the letter of the}} Allied agreement, units fighting on the Eastern Front were to become Soviet prisoners. Graf and most of the JG52 personnel were handed over by the American forces to the Soviet Union on 15 May 1945. On 20 August, he and other senior Luftwaffe officers, including Hartmann and Hans Hahn, were moved to POW Camp No. 150 in Gryazovets, northeast of Moscow. This was a (relatively) more comfortable confinement than the regular labour camps and intended to provide a more sympathetic environment for high-profile prisoners. When Graf was found not to be malleable for their purposes, the Soviet regime put him on trial for war-crimes. However, when insufficient evidence could be produced, the charges were dropped. Erich Hartmann however, was found guilty and sentenced to 25 years of forced labour. On 8 December 1945, Graf was moved to POW Camp No. 27 in Krasnogorsk, Moscow. The author, Musciano, mentions that he was subject to solitary confinement for extended periods, but that he had his final order hidden in his shoe and would re-read <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> his sanity.|$|E

25|$|The {{roots of}} the modern Tanzanian labor {{movement}} reach back to the 1940s. By 1947, five unions had been registered with the authorities. The colonial government reacted {{to the creation of}} unions in Tanzania by enacting laws which allowed <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> tabs on the movement– for example, the registration of unions become obligatory. Nonetheless, the labor movement grew, by 1956 there were 23 organizations with a total of nearly 13,000 members.|$|E
25|$|Prayers with beads {{like the}} rosary {{may have begun}} as a {{practice}} by the laity to imitate the Christian monasticism of the Liturgy of the Hours, {{during the course of}} which the monks prayed the 150 Psalms daily.

The FBI was {{investigating}} the matter and had asked the Meier family to refrain from speaking publicly about <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the Drews from learning about their investigation. Shortly after the first anniversary of Meier's death, her aunt, Vicki Dunn, saw an article written by Steve Pokin of the Suburban Journals about Internet harassment. She contacted Pokin to share Meier's story with him. Once the story broke, it quickly spread to national and international news outlets.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} {{the next}} drive, the Seahawks finally got a chance to score when Hillary muffed a punt and {{defensive}} back Melvin Jenkins recovered for Seattle on the Bengals 24-yard line. Two plays later, Krieg's 14-yard completion to fullback John L. Williams (Seattle's longest gain of the half) brought up first down and goal. But on the next play, defensive tackle Tim Krumrie stripped the ball from Williams and defensive end Jim Skow recovered <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the score 21–0 at halftime. The Bengals had dominated the first half, massively outgaining Seattle in rushing yards (167–0), total yards (241–49), first downs (16–3), and time of possession (20:35–9:25).|$|E
25|$|In 1918, Hershey {{transferred}} {{the majority of}} his assets, including control of the company, to the Milton Hershey School Trust fund, to benefit the Industrial School. The trust fund has a majority of voting shares in the Hershey Company, allowing <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> control of the company. In 1951, the school was renamed the Milton Hershey School. The Milton Hershey School Trust also has 100% control of Hershey Entertainment and Resorts Company, which owns the Hotel Hershey and Hersheypark, among other properties. He took great pride in the growth of the school, the town, and his business. He placed the quality of his product and the well-being of his workers ahead of profits.|$|E

25|$|Square dancers {{dance to}} a variety of music, mostly Chinese popular songs, both {{contemporary}} and historic. The hobby began in the mid-1990s, as middle-aged women who had been forced into retirement began doing <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> themselves occupied. Its popularity notwithstanding, square dancing {{has been the subject of}} considerable controversy in the 2010s China due to complaints of noise pollution in the evening or morning hours. Dancers in China's increasingly populous cities congregate in public areas because there are few dedicated facilities where they could go. Residents of nearby apartment complexes who have been disturbed by the high volume of multiple dance groups' musical accompaniment, especially late in the evening and early in the morning when they are trying to sleep, have sometimes reacted violently.|$|E
25|$|Sewer {{service is}} {{available}} to 87.7 percent of the city, and 100 {{percent of the population}} is serviced by treated water. While in most Brazilian cities the water is supplied by large state companies, in Porto Alegre the Municipal Department of Water and Sanitation Services, (DMAE) is the provider. It is the largest municipal water supplier in the country and enjoys operational autonomy and financial independence. As a separate entity from the municipal government it can make its own decisions on how to invest revenues it has collected, and such decisions are not directly subject to interference from the municipality. It receives no subsidies and makes no payments to the municipality itself. As a municipal undertaking, DMAE enjoys tax-exempt status, which allows <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> water prices lower.|$|E
25|$|West of Times Square, {{the tracks}} curve sharply {{downward}} before turning under 11th Avenue. The tracks end at 24th Street, although the last station is at 34th Street. This segment was built {{as part of}} the extension of the Flushing Line west to Manhattan's Far West Side (see below). A decommissioned lower level at the IND Eighth Avenue Line's 42nd Street–Port Authority Bus Terminal station formerly blocked the way; it had been rumored that the IND built <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the IRT from extending the Flushing Line, although no blueprints indicate that the IRT planned such an expansion. While some originally questioned the necessity of the plan, with London receiving the 2012 Summer Olympics, the city pursued it as a means to enable the redevelopment of the far West Side under the Hudson Yards Redevelopment Project.|$|E

25|$|Microblogging: Microblogging is the {{practice}} of posting small pieces of digital content—which could be text, pictures, links, short videos, or other media—on the Internet. Microblogging offers a portable communication mode that feels organic and spontaneous to many users. It has captured the public imagination, {{in part because the}} short posts are easy to read on the go or when waiting. Friends use <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> in touch, business associates use it to coordinate meetings or share useful resources, and celebrities and politicians (or their publicists) microblog about concert dates, lectures, book releases, or tour schedules. A wide and growing range of add-on tools enables sophisticated updates and interaction with other applications. The resulting profusion of functionality is helping to define new possibilities for this type of communication. Examples of these include Twitter, Facebook, Tumblr and, by far the largest, WeiBo.|$|E
25|$|The {{law clerk}} Mr. Guppy, enamoured of Esther, hopes {{to win her}} affection by helping her {{discover}} the identity of her parents. He finds connections to both Lady Dedlock and the deceased Nemo, who {{has been identified as}} Captain James Hawdon, and is eventually alerted to the existence of letters left behind by Hawdon but kept by his drunken landlord, Krook. Realizing that Esther is her daughter whom she was told had died — fathered by Hawdon before her current marriage — Lady Dedlock confesses to Esther but swears her to secrecy. Esther is stricken by smallpox and nearly dies; she recovers but is terribly scarred. John proposes marriage to Esther, but though she accepts, he convinces her to keep it secret until she is sure it is what she wants. While amassing other enemies, Tulkinghorn deduces Lady Dedlock's secret and tries to use <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> her in line.|$|E
25|$|Belfast City Council {{had long}} been {{dominated}} by unionists, mainly the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and Ulster Unionist Party (UUP). However, in May 2011 Irish nationalists (Sinn Féin and the Social Democratic and Labour Party) won more seats than unionists for the first time. The middle-ground Alliance Party held {{the balance of power}} on the council. Nationalist councillors wanted the Union Jack taken down permanently, and unionist councillors wanted <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> flying all year. Alliance put forward a compromise: that it would fly on 18 designated days, in line with UK government policy on the flying of the union flag from UK government buildings, which is followed by many city and local governments in Britain. At Parliament Buildings (or Stormont), where the Northern Ireland Assembly meets, the Union Jack is only flown on 15 designated days. The nationalist and Alliance councillors voted in favour of this compromise and it was passed.|$|E
