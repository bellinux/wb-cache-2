25|$|A goal kick is an {{important}} 'set piece' that will occur many times in a game and yet few teams practice it. If taken quickly the kick may be taken short to a full-back who has run into a wide position. Although this may gain little ground it retains the all-important possession of the ball. A longer kick to the midfield is more common and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>vital</b> <b>that</b> the midfield unit {{are in a position}} to receive it.|$|E

25|$|In 2008, the MRC set up {{an expert}} group to {{consider}} how the MRC might encourage new high-quality research into CFS/ME and partnerships between researchers already working on CFS/ME and those in associated areas. It currently lists CFS/ME with a highlight notice, inviting researchers to develop high-quality research proposals for funding. In February 2010, the All-Party Parliamentary Group on ME (APPG on ME) produced a legacy paper, which welcomed the recent MRC initiative, but felt {{that there has been}} far too much emphasis in the past on psychological research, with insufficient attention to biomedical research, and that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>vital</b> <b>that</b> further biomedical research be undertaken to help discover a cause and more effective forms of management for this disease.|$|E
25|$|In {{times of}} {{relative}} peace, {{the process of}} mine removal {{is referred to as}} demining. This is a thorough, time-intensive process that seeks to locate all mines so that the land or sea area may be safely returned to normal use. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>vital</b> <b>that</b> this process be exhaustive. Even if only a small handful of mines remain undiscovered, incomplete demining can actually lead to an increase in civilian mine casualties as local people re-occupy an area they previously avoided in the belief that it has been made safe. In this context demining is one of the tools of mine action. Coordinated by Mine Action Coordination Centers run by the United Nations or a host government, civilian mine clearance agencies are tasked with the demining. In post-conflict areas, minefields are often contaminated with a mixture of explosive remnants of war (ERW) that includes unexploded ordnance as well as landmines. In that context, the humanitarian clearance effort {{is often referred to as}} battle area clearance.|$|E
25|$|A {{positive}} screen warrants an antibody panel/investigation {{to determine}} if it is clinically significant. An antibody panel consists of commercially prepared group O red cell suspensions from donors that have been phenotyped for antigens that correspond to commonly encountered and clinically significant alloantibodies. Donor cells may have homozygous (e.g. K+k−), heterozygous (K+k+) expression or no expression of various antigens (K−k−). The phenotypes of all the donor cells being tested are shown in a chart. The patient's serum is tested against the various donor cells. Based on the reactions of the patient's serum against the donor cells, a pattern will emerge to confirm the presence {{of one or more}} antibodies. Not all antibodies are clinically significant (i.e. cause transfusion reactions, HDN, etc.). Once the patient has developed a clinically significant antibody <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>vital</b> <b>that</b> the patient receive antigen-negative red blood cells to prevent future transfusion reactions. A direct antiglobulin test (Coombs test) is also performed as part of the antibody investigation.|$|E

25|$|Pharès {{is angry}} that Amédès might reveal his guilt. Chemmis {{says that the}} people still love him and to cement his {{position}} as new king, he should be crowned and marry Nephté that very day. But Pharès suggests that he will only be safe when Amédès is dead and Chemmis promises to kill him if he reveals the secret. The statesmen, heads {{of the army and}} soldiers march in. Pharès tells them that the peoples of Asia are in revolt against Egypt after Séthos' death; <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>vital</b> <b>that</b> Egypt has a commander for its army. The soldiers acclaim Pharès as their new general. Their shouts of congratulation are interrupted by the arrival of Nephté. Nephté is outraged at Pharès' behaviour but says that Amédès will soon reveal the killer's name. The soldiers, who have not heard this conversation, urge Pharès and Nephté to marry. Pharès asks where Nephté's son is; he should be brought up in the palace in the view of his people. He sends soldiers to search for the boy. He leaves with the soldiers, promising them that the military campaign will begin at dawn. Alone with her waiting women, Nephté says she can see no escape from her predicament: if she seeks revenge, her son's life will be in danger; if she does not, justice will not be done and she will be a criminal. Her waiting women try to comfort her, but Nephté asks to be alone. Amédès now enters, shadowed by Chemmis. Amédès tells Nephté he is in danger and the gods seem to have abandoned them, but the priests will defend her son to the death. Chemmis emerges and threatens Amédès but the priest says he is willing to sacrifice his life. However, Nephté vows to die in his place to secure revenge for her husband. News comes that the soldiers have found her son's hiding place. The people arrive and beg Nephté to marry Pharès. Nephté finally agrees.In an aside, she reveals she has a secret plan.|$|E

2500|$|Patients should ideally {{receive their}} own blood or type-specific blood {{products}} {{to minimize the}} chance of a transfusion reaction. [...] Risks can be further reduced by cross-matching blood, but this may be skipped when blood is required for an emergency. Cross-matching involves mixing a sample of the recipient's serum with a sample of the donor's red blood cells and checking if the mixture agglutinates, or forms clumps. If agglutination is not obvious by direct vision, blood bank technicians usually check for agglutination with a microscope. If agglutination occurs, that particular donor's blood cannot be transfused to that particular recipient. [...] In a blood bank <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>vital</b> <b>that</b> all blood specimens are correctly identified, so labelling has been standardized using a barcode system known as ISBT 128.|$|E
2500|$|As {{the expert}} witness is being {{walked through the}} evidence, he/she has {{to keep in mind}} that most people have no {{thorough}} knowledge of entomology, so the responses to the questions being asked and the explanations about the evidence have to be kept clear and concise and in a simplistic manner that informs and educates, not only the jurors, but the judge as well. [...] <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>vital</b> <b>that</b> the attorney has a thorough grasp on all the concepts that are being explored so that he/she knows which questions to ask to carry across his point. In the same manner, the responses to the questions being asked by the opposing side should be kept as precise as possible, so as not to given the opposing attorney any ammunition to discredit the findings in the cross-examination.|$|E
2500|$|Some airbrushes use {{pressures}} {{as low as}} 20 psi (1.38 bar) {{while others}} use pressures {{in the region of}} 30-35 psi (2-2.4 bar). Larger [...] "spray guns" [...] as used for automobile spray-painting need 100 psi (6.8 bar) or more to adequately atomize a thicker paint using less solvent. They are capable of delivering a heavier coating more rapidly over a wide area. Even with small artist airbrushes using acrylic paint, artists must be careful not to breathe in the atomized paint, which floats in the air for minutes and can go deep into the lungs. With commercial spray guns for automobiles, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>vital</b> <b>that</b> the painter have a clean air source to breathe, because automotive paint is far more harmful to the lungs than acrylic. Certain spray guns, called High-Volume Low-Pressure (HVLP) spray guns, are designed to deliver the same high volumes of paint without requiring such high pressures.|$|E

2500|$|Since 31 August 2009, {{legislation}} granting lesbians equal birth {{rights in}} England and Wales came into effect, meaning both {{can now be}} named on a child's birth certificate, amending the Registration of Births and Deaths Regulations 1987. The legislation was criticised by those who believe it was [...] "damaging the traditional notion of a family". Stonewall Head of Policy and Research Ruth Hunt said the new law makes life easier for lesbian families and stated [...] "Now lesbian couples in the UK who make a considered decision to start a loving family will finally be afforded equal access to services they help fund as taxpayers". Home Office minister, Lord Brett was full of praise in his comments: This positive change means that, for the first time, female couples who have a child using fertility treatment {{have the same rights}} as their heterosexual counterparts to be shown as parents in the birth registration. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>vital</b> <b>that</b> we afford equality wherever we can in society, especially as family circumstances continue to change. This is an important step forward in that process. Iain Duncan Smith, who led efforts to oppose the change, said that [...] "The absence of fathers generally has a detrimental effect on the child." ...|$|E
2500|$|At {{some time}} in the late 1950s, Kahane took on the persona of a Gentile individual, along with the {{pseudonym}} Michael King. At this point, Kahane began openly expressing anti-Communist positions. He and Joseph Churba created the July Fourth Movement, which was formed to counteract widespread opposition towards U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War. Subsequently, they co-authored the text, The Jewish Stake in Vietnam together, which was an attempt to convince American Jews of the [...] "evil of Communism". The book's introduction states that, [...] "all Americans have a stake in this grim war against Communism.... <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>vital</b> <b>that</b> Jews realize the threat to their very survival [...]" [...] Churba had a major falling out with Kahane over the use of para-militarism, and they permanently parted ways. Churba went on to pursue his own career, joining the US Air Force, writing many books on the Middle East, and later becoming one of Ronald Reagan's consultants. Kahane chose to fight for Jewish rights, and was willing to use extreme measures. He even attempted to acquire and grow biological weapons to use on a Soviet military installation, but failed. He began using the phrase [...] "Never Again", and conceived the Jewish Star and fist insignia, a symbol resembling that of the Black Panther Party, though Kahane himself opposed the Black Panther party due to anti-Jewish riots they had supported in Massachusetts and their leftist leanings, as he saw it.|$|E

And <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>vital</b> <b>that</b> you should know exactly what your ship is going to do three seconds before she does it. Similarly with men. If any one, from Lieutenant-Commander to stoker, changes his personal trick or habit--even the manner in which he clutches his chin or caresses his nose at a crisis--the matter must be carefully considered in this world where each is trustee for his neighbour's life and, vastly more important, the corporate honour.|$|E
