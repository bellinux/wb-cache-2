5|$|Driberg embraced enthusiastically {{the climate}} of the 1960s and the social and {{cultural}} freedoms that the decade introduced. In 1963 <b>he</b> <b>met</b> <b>the</b> Kray twins, prominent London gangland figures, and began a lengthy friendship with them and their associates. In July 1964 two backbench Conservative MPs reported to their Chief Whip that Driberg and Lord Boothby (a well-known Conservative peer) had been importuning males at a dog track, and were involved with gangs of thugs.|$|E
5|$|Fleming's trip to Istanbul in June 1955 {{to cover}} an Interpol conference for The Sunday Times {{was a source}} of much of the {{background}} information in the story. While there <b>he</b> <b>met</b> <b>the</b> Oxford-educated ship owner Nazim Kalkavan, who became the model for Darko Kerim; Fleming took down many of Kalkavan's conversations in a notebook, and used them verbatim in the novel.|$|E
5|$|From Persia, Andranik {{moved to}} the Caucasus, where <b>he</b> <b>met</b> <b>the</b> Armenian leaders in Baku and Tiflis.

5|$|A {{visit to}} Cornwall in 1746–1747, where <b>he</b> <b>met</b> <b>the</b> antiquary and naturalist William Borlase, awakened an {{interest}} in minerals and fossils which formed his main scientific study during the 1750s. In 1750, his account of an earthquake at Downing was inserted in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society, where there also appeared in 1756 a paper on several coralloid bodies he had collected at Coalbrookdale, Shropshire. More practically, Pennant used his geological knowledge to open a lead mine, which helped to finance improvements at Downing after he had inherited the estate in 1763.|$|E
5|$|After the 1976 tour, Townshend took {{most of the}} {{following}} year off {{to spend time with}} his family. He discovered that former Beatles and Rolling Stones manager Allen Klein had bought a stake in his publishing company. A settlement was reached, but Townshend was upset and disillusioned that Klein had attempted to take ownership of his songs. Townshend went to the Speakeasy where <b>he</b> <b>met</b> <b>the</b> Sex Pistols' Steve Jones and Paul Cook, fans of the Who. After leaving, he passed out in a doorway, where a policeman said he would not be arrested if he could stand and walk. The events inspired the title track of the next album, Who Are You.|$|E

5|$|Another {{strike in}} Szczecin broke out on 22 January 1971. In a risky move, Gierek went to Szczecin on 24 January and to Gdańsk the next day. <b>He</b> <b>met</b> <b>the</b> workers personally, apologizing for the {{mistakes}} of the past and saying that as a former worker himself he understood their plight and would now govern Poland for the people. Workers striking in Szczecin formulated demands in the area of freely elected worker councils and union representatives. Gierek agreed, but the authorities soon marginalized and eliminated the worker leaders from the legally existing structures and their places of employment. The February 1971 Łódź strikes followed and concentrated on economic demands. Afterwards prices were lowered, wage increases were announced, and sweeping economic and political changes were promised.|$|E
5|$|At the April 2017 Chicago Comic & Entertainment Expo, a film {{adaptation}} was announced. It will be co-written by Seeley and Sarah Fischer, {{directed by}} Luke Boyce and produced by Shatterglass Films, an independent film {{company based in}} Champaign, Illinois. Larger production firms also expressed interest, but Seeley would have had less input into the film if it were made by them. Boyce said he had enjoyed Revival since its debut, and {{had been thinking about}} adapting it long before <b>he</b> <b>met</b> <b>the</b> creators. A two-minute proof of concept teaser was shown at the expo.|$|E
5|$|Daniel Solander {{was living}} in Linnaeus' house during his time as a student in Uppsala. Linnaeus was very fond of him, {{promising}} Solander his oldest daughter's hand in marriage. On Linnaeus' recommendation, Solander travelled to England in 1760, where <b>he</b> <b>met</b> <b>the</b> English botanist Joseph Banks. With Banks, Solander joined James Cook on his expedition to Oceania on the Endeavour in 1768–71. Solander {{was not the only}} apostle to journey with James Cook; Anders Sparrman followed on the Resolution in 1772–75 bound for, among other places, Oceania and South America. Sparrman made many other expeditions, one of them to South Africa.|$|E

5|$|Despite his socialist and pro-Soviet beliefs, Crawford {{believed}} in collaborating with all foreign archaeologists, regardless of political or ideological differences. In early 1938, he lectured on aerial archaeology at the German Air Ministry; the Ministry published his lecture as Luftbild und Vorgeschichte, and Crawford was frustrated that the British {{government did not}} publish his work with the same enthusiasm. From there, he visited Vienna to meet with his friend, the archaeologist Oswald Menghin; Menghin took Crawford to an event celebrating the Anschluss, at which <b>he</b> <b>met</b> <b>the</b> prominent Nazi Josef Bürckel. Shortly after, he holidayed in Schleswig-Holstein, where German archaeologists took {{him to see the}} Danevirke.|$|E
5|$|In 1767 Pennant {{was elected}} {{a fellow of}} the Royal Society. About this time <b>he</b> <b>met</b> <b>the</b> much-travelled Sir Joseph Banks and visited him at his home in Lincolnshire. Banks {{presented}} him with the skin of a new species of penguin recently brought back from the Falkland Islands. Pennant wrote an account of this bird, the king penguin (Aptenodytes patagonicus), and all the other known species of penguin which was published in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society.|$|E
5|$|In 1922, {{his travels}} {{took him to}} Asia and later to Palestine, {{as part of a}} six-month {{excursion}} and speaking tour, as he visited Singapore, Ceylon and Japan, where he gave a series of lectures to thousands of Japanese. After his first public lecture, <b>he</b> <b>met</b> <b>the</b> emperor and empress at the Imperial Palace, where thousands came to watch.

Kenyatta would not return to Kenya for fifteen years. In Britain, he spent the summer attending ILP summer schools and gatherings of the Fabian Society. In June, he visited Geneva, Switzerland to attend a conference on African children run by the Save the Children charity. In November, <b>he</b> <b>met</b> <b>the</b> Indian independence leader Mohandas Gandhi while in London. That month, he enrolled in the Woodbrooke Quaker College in Birmingham, where he remained until the spring of 1932, attaining a certificate in English writing.|$|E
5|$|In early 1929 Robey {{returned}} to South Africa and then Canada for another tour with Bits and Pieces, {{after which he}} started another series of variety dates back in England. Among the towns he visited was Woolwich, where he performed to packed audiences {{over the course of}} a week. Here <b>he</b> <b>met</b> <b>the</b> theatre managers Frank and Agnes Littler, with the latter briefly becoming his manager. In 1932 Robey appeared in his first sound film, The Temperance Fête, and followed this with Marry Me, which was, according to his biographer A. E. Wilson, one of the most successful musical films of the comedian's career. The film tells the story of a sound recordist in a gramophone company who romances a colleague when she becomes the family housekeeper.|$|E
5|$|Kilburn {{was born}} in Sheffield in 1909, and {{attended}} Holgate Grammar School in Barnsley, before completing a degree in economics at the university there. From an early age, he showed interest in cricket; as a boy he received coaching from former Yorkshire cricketer George Hirst at Scarborough, and played for Barnsley in Yorkshire Council matches and for Bradford in the Bradford League. Bowling fast-paced off spin, Kilburn was successful enough with bat and ball to win medals for Bradford and have his achievements reported in the press. He worked briefly as a teacher in a Harrogate preparatory school. While in Bradford, <b>he</b> <b>met</b> <b>the</b> vice-consul for Finland; as a result, he went to live in Finland for a year.|$|E
