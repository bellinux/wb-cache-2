[...] In order to inspect this surface thoroughly the physician blows it up like a balloon, using an air compressor, {{in order to get}} the creases out. [...] The stomach, intestines and colon have a so-called [...] "second brain" [...] wrapped around them, which autonomously runs the chemical factory of digestion. [...] It uses complex hormone signals and nerve signals to communicate with the brain and the rest of the body. [...] Normally a colon's job is to digest food and regulate the intestinal flora. [...] The harmful bacteria in rancid food, for example, creates gas. The colon has distension sensors that can tell when there is unexpected gas pushing the colon walls out—thus the [...] "second brain" [...] tells the person that he or she is having intestinal difficulties by way of the sensation of nausea. [...] Doctors typically recommend either total anaesthesia or a partial twilight sedative to either preclude or to lessen the patient's awareness of pain or discomfort, or just the unusual sensations of the procedure. [...] Once the colon has been inflated, the doctor inspects it with the scope as it is slowly pulled backwards. [...] If any polyps are found they are then cut out for later biopsy.|$|E

40|$|Using linear {{gas bearing}} guides {{in a high}} vacuum environment, the common method to keep the vacuum quality is to exhaust the gas emitted by the bearing pads before leaking into the vacuum chamber. Thereby the <b>exhaust</b> <b>tubes</b> between the guide and the exhaust pumps should {{interfere}} with the guide {{as little as possible}} while maintaining a flexible connection and a highly effective exhaustion rate. A novel exhaust system that implements these requirements is described within this paper. The major achievement was the realization of two <b>exhaust</b> <b>tubes</b> slidable into one another combined with the known method of non-contact clearance seals, thus enabling an highly efficient and yet disturbance free exhaustion. This setup was developed and characterized at static and dynamic conditions. An analytical model for dimensioning the non-contact seal was worked out and experimentally verified. The number of seal stages and the clearance height were identified as the major impact factors on the leakage rate of the setup. It is concluded that the investigated approach is very suitable for vacuum compatible gas bearing guides since a vacuum level in the order of 10 - 4 Pa was maintained during the experiments...|$|R

5000|$|A pop pop boat {{is powered}} by a very simple heat engine. This engine {{consists}} of a small boiler, which is connected to an <b>exhaust</b> <b>tube.</b> When heat is applied to the boiler, water in the boiler flashes into steam. The expanding steam pushes out the bottom of the boiler with a sound 'pop' and pushes some of the water in the <b>exhaust</b> <b>tube,</b> propelling the boat forward. Then the boiler is dry, no generating steam pressure, because no water inside the boiler. The column of water in the <b>exhaust</b> <b>tube</b> is no longer being pushed, but the momentum of the water keeps it going outward. This creates a lower-than-atmospheric pressure inside the boiler. The bottom of the boiler bulge inward (concave), making a sound 'pop' and normal atmospheric pressure is pushing the water back in. The cooled water that is brought back into the boiler is then heated and flashed into steam, and the cycle repeats. This constant flashing and cooling cycle of the engine creates the distinctive [...] "pop pop" [...] noise for which the boat is named. This noise is more pronounced when a diaphragm-type boiler is used (coil-type boilers are much quieter). The presence of air in the boiler acts as a spring and gives a better oscillation of the water level, but if too much air enters the boiler then the oscillation ceases. Since water contains some dissolved air, in operation air tends to build up in the engine. Therefore, engines must [...] "burp" [...] out air periodically in order to run for a long time.|$|E

This invention involved {{the division of the}} chimney into a central <b>exhaust</b> <b>tube</b> and an outer concentric ring into which air was projected through the louver slits down the front of the chimney casing. The increase in air resistance was induced by deflector plates. By this means, a draught was supplied when the engine was running with its steam cut off, as happened for long stretches on the hilly Highland line.|$|E

When Curley takes his seat in the classroom, he discovers that his new teacher is the wonderful kindhearted Mildred. During that first day she teaches the children a lesson of humility by making each one a victim of his own prank, and Curley, who is also humiliated, flees the scene before his prank is about to happen.|$|E

50|$|This {{design with}} its low {{stress on the}} rails, low {{inherent}} resistance and simple weight compensation was promising especially as it also avoided the use of cranked driving axles. Similar thoughts in the USA during the 1930s {{led to the development}} of duplex locomotives. Because the cylinders of adjacent axles also had 28 mm of side play, the locomotive could negotiate radii of as little as 170 m. Through the special design of the cylinders, the use of crank axles (Kropfachse) was avoided. Whilst this design enabled the steam lines between the high- and low-pressure cylinders to be extremely short, long admission and <b>exhaust</b> <b>tubes</b> were necessary.|$|R

50|$|Jet damping or thrust damping is {{the effect}} of rocket exhaust {{removing}} energy from the transverse angular motion of a rocket. If a rocket has pitch or yaw motion then the exhaust must be accelerated laterally as it flows down the <b>exhaust</b> <b>tube</b> and nozzle. Once the exhaust leaves the nozzle this lateral momentum is lost to the vehicle and thus serves to damp the lateral oscillations. The jet damping is stabilizing as long as the distance from the instantaneous spacecraft center of mass to the nozzle exit plane exceeds the instantaneous transverse radius of gyration. Most rocket or missile configurations meet this criteria and the jet damping has a dynamic stabilizing effect. The jet damping torque rotates at nutation frequency in the spacecraft frame.|$|E

50|$|In pop pop boats {{with two}} exhaust tubes, {{the water is}} {{expelled}} from both tubes during {{the first phase of}} the cycle, and drawn in from both tubes during the second phase of the cycle. The water does not circulate in through one tube and out through the other. The internal-combustion analog of the pop pop boat engine is the valveless pulse jet.The operation of the pop pop boat may seem surprising, since one might expect that if water is going in and out through the <b>exhaust</b> <b>tube,</b> the boat should merely shake back and forth. But while the water pushed out carries away with it momentum, which must be balanced (by Newton's third law) by an opposite momentum on the part of the boat, the water sucked in quickly impinges on the boiler tank and transfers its momentum to the boat. The initial reaction force on the boat (which would pull it backwards) is therefore cancelled by the pushing of the water when it hits the inside of the boiler. The result is that the inflow of water causes no appreciable force on the boat.|$|E

30|$|Conclusions may be {{extracted}} from studies {{carried out with}} particles of similar composition. The corrosion of zinc and steel has been studied in relation to the presence of deposited particles derived from the combustion of oil (which may be comparable to diesel fuel) and coal [139]. The authors concluded that in relatively unpolluted atmospheres inert particulates can induce corrosion in zinc and mild steel due to differential aeration, an effect which is masked when the overall corrosion rates increase. Oil-ash particles were also found to be much more corrosive than coal-ash particles. Although far from the heritage field in terms of temperature and concentration, some investigations have demonstrated that DPM leads to severe degradation of ceramic filters used in engine <b>exhaust</b> <b>tubes</b> [140].|$|R
