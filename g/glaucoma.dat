5|$|Narrow/closed angle <b>glaucoma</b> is an {{autosomal}} dominant inheritable trait in the breed. It {{is a leading}} cause of blindness in dogs, and is where there is increased fluid pressure within the eye. If the fluid is not reduced, the pressure causes permanent damage to the retina and optic nerve. Loss of eyesight can happen as quickly as within 24 hours if the pressure if elevated enough, or slowly over time if it is only a mild elevation. The sudden, rapid elevation of pressure is more common with narrow/closed angle <b>glaucoma</b> which is more common to the breed than the slower open angle <b>glaucoma.</b> Symptoms can include redness in the eye, the eye itself looking cloudy, sensitivity to light and the dog may rub at their eye, or even rub it along other objects and carpet as the condition is moderate to extremely painful. Treatment can vary depending on the severity of the condition but if inherited <b>glaucoma</b> appears in one eye then it usually occurs in the other eye eventually.|$|E
5|$|Another {{leading cause}} of {{blindness}} is Canine <b>glaucoma.</b> This {{is an increase in}} the pressure of the fluid in the eye which, if left untreated, can cause visual impairment and eventual loss of sight. The condition can be inherited (Primary <b>glaucoma)</b> or a secondary condition to a variety of other eye issues including tumors or lens luxation. Both breeds are affected by juvenile cataracts which can occur at up to four years of age. Symptoms can include discoloring of the pupil, and treatment may include surgery to remove the cataract.|$|E
5|$|Following work by {{the breed}} clubs to ensure that any reoccurring health {{problems}} are dealt with, there are no especially common conditions affecting the Dandie Dinmont Terrier. However, minor problems affecting the breed can include hypothyroidism, primary closed angle <b>glaucoma</b> and Cushing's syndrome. In order to combat <b>glaucoma</b> in the breed, the breed clubs recommend that Dandies should have a procedure called a gonioscopy performed on them at regular intervals throughout their lives. The Dandie is also at slightly higher risk of canine cancer than average. The average life expectancy of a Dandie Dinmont Terrier is 1113 years.|$|E
5|$|In 2015, Barr {{revealed}} she {{has been}} diagnosed with both macular degeneration and <b>glaucoma,</b> and thus is gradually losing her eyesight and expects to eventually go blind; she is consuming medical marijuana to decrease her intraocular pressure that is a feature of these diseases.|$|E
5|$|The book , co-written by {{the three}} bodyguards fired the {{previous}} year, was published on August 1. It was the first exposé to detail Presley's years of drug misuse. He was devastated by the book and tried unsuccessfully to halt its release by offering money to the publishers. By this point, he suffered from multiple ailments: <b>glaucoma,</b> high blood pressure, liver damage, and an enlarged colon, each aggravated—and possibly caused—by drug abuse. Genetic analysis of a hair sample in 2014 found evidence of genetic variants that could have caused his <b>glaucoma,</b> migraines and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. In addition, his drug abuse had led to falls, head trauma, and overdoses that most likely had damaged his brain.|$|E
5|$|This in turn {{blocks the}} flow of fluids in the eye, leading to a painful {{increase}} in intra-ocular pressure (<b>glaucoma)</b> and often irreparable optic nerve damage, leading to visual field loss and eventual blindness.|$|E
5|$|Aloe vera gel is used commercially as an {{ingredient}} in yogurts, beverages, and some desserts, although at certain doses, its toxic properties could be severe whether ingested or topically applied. The {{same is true}} for aloe latex, which was taken orally for conditions ranging from <b>glaucoma</b> to multiple sclerosis until the FDA required manufacturers to discontinue its use.|$|E
5|$|Benzodiazepines {{require special}} {{precaution}} if {{used in the}} elderly, during pregnancy, in children, in alcohol- or other drug-dependent individuals or those with comorbid psychiatric disorders. Additional caution is required in critically ill patients, as accumulation of midazolam and its active metabolites may occur. Kidney or liver impairments may slow down the elimination of midazolam leading to prolonged and enhanced effects. Contraindications include hypersensitivity, acute narrow-angle <b>glaucoma,</b> shock, hypotension, or head injury. Most are relative contraindications.|$|E
5|$|Columbia {{scientists}} have been credited with about 175 new inventions in the health sciences each year. More than 30 pharmaceutical products based on discoveries and inventions made at Columbia are on the market today. These include Remicade (for arthritis), Reopro (for blood clot complications), Xalatan (for <b>glaucoma),</b> Benefix, Latanoprost (a <b>glaucoma</b> treatment), shoulder prosthesis, homocysteine (testing for cardiovascular disease), and Zolinza (for cancer therapy). Columbia Technology Ventures (formerly Science and Technology Ventures), , manages some 600 patents and more than 250 active license agreements. Patent-related deals earned Columbia more than $230million in the 2006 fiscal year, according to the university, more than any university in the world. Columbia owns many unique research facilities, such as the Columbia Institute for Tele-Information dedicated to telecommunications and the Goddard Institute for Space Studies, which is an astronomical observatory affiliated with NASA.|$|E
5|$|Although {{partially}} blind from <b>glaucoma</b> {{by the age}} of 109 {{and completely}} blind from cataracts by 111, he nevertheless retained his memory and good health until his final days; his medical history showed no signs of high blood pressure, heart or kidney trouble or diabetes. He was able to walk without a cane or walker, preferring not to use one, and was able to feed himself, including Cheerios for breakfast, his favorite vanilla ice cream with his other meals and a daily can of Ensure for energy. While he enjoyed recounting tales from his military experience, he never complained about the segregated nature of his unit, preferring instead to focus on his own exploits on the job.|$|E
5|$|Benzodiazepines {{require special}} {{precaution}} if used {{in children and}} in alcohol- or drug-dependent individuals. Particular care should be taken in pregnant or elderly people, people with substance abuse history (particularly alcohol dependence), and people with comorbid psychiatric disorders. The use of alprazolam should be avoided or carefully monitored by medical professionals in individuals with: myasthenia gravis, acute narrow-angle <b>glaucoma,</b> severe liver deficiencies (e.g., cirrhosis), severe sleep apnea, pre-existing respiratory depression, marked neuromuscular respiratory, acute pulmonary insufficiency, chronic psychosis, hypersensitivity or allergy to alprazolam or other benzodiazepines, and borderline personality disorder (where it may induce suicidality and dyscontrol).|$|E
5|$|Eye {{conditions}} which affect the Parson Russell Terrier include primary lens luxation, a heritable condition. This disease causes the zonular fibres to be abnormal {{and begin to}} disintegrate in affected dogs. The fibres support {{the lens of the}} eye, and their destruction can cause the lens to fall into the wrong location within the eye. If the lens falls into the anterior chamber of eyeball then a secondary <b>glaucoma</b> can occur, causing loss of vision. National kennel associations such as the Kennel Club (UK) publish DNA screening results on Parson Russell Terriers, broken down into three groups; clears, carriers, and affecteds.|$|E
5|$|Hip and elbow {{dysplasia}} are common. Giant Schnauzers {{are also}} prone to eye {{problems such as}} keratoconjunctivitis sicca, <b>glaucoma,</b> cataracts, multifocal retinal dysplasia, and generalized progressive retinal atrophy. They are also prone to skin diseases, such as seasonal flank alopecia, vitiligo, and follicular cysts. Cancer of the skin is common in dark-colored dogs, with the most frequently occurring varieties being melanoma of the limbs and digits, and squamous cell carcinoma of the digit. This susceptibility occurs because melanoma {{is caused by a}} defect in the melanocytes, the cells that darken the color of the skin. Noncancerous skin tumors are also common.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, {{cannabis}} was legalized in California for {{the aid of}} {{chronically ill}} residents. The Compassionate Use Act of 1996 allowed people to have and use cannabis but only when prescribed by a doctor/physician. Cannabis was prescribed to people who had trouble with cancer, AIDS, and other medical inflictions such as <b>glaucoma.</b> It was implemented {{as a way to}} try and help those who needed cannabis for their medical illnesses to find a source and safe way to use the drug. However, this did not protect patients with medical cards to redistribute any of the cannabis they had legally obtained for themselves.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{greatest}} potential dangers {{of faith in the}} Bates method is that a believer may be disinclined to seek medical advice regarding what could be a sight-threatening condition requiring prompt treatment, such as <b>glaucoma.</b> Also, children with vision problems may require early attention by a professional in order to successfully prevent lazy eye. Such treatment may include exercises, but which are different from those associated with the Bates method, and parents who subscribe to Bates' ideas may delay seeking conventional care until it is too late. It may further be necessary for a child at risk of developing lazy eye to wear the proper correction.|$|E
5|$|The Welsh Springer is {{generally}} a healthy breed, but some can suffer conditions common to many breeds such as hip dysplasia, Canine <b>glaucoma</b> and like other dogs with pendulous ears, they {{are prone to}} ear infections such as otitis externa. In a survey of over a hundred breeds of dog conducted in 1997, the Welsh Springer Spaniel was ranked 14th for worst hip score, with the average score of the breed being 18.45. The average lifespan is 12 to 15 years.|$|E
5|$|Two genetic health {{concerns}} {{seen in the}} breed are von Willebrand disease (vWD) and craniomandibular osteopathy (CMO); Scottie cramp, patellar luxation and cerebellar abiotrophy are also sometimes seen in this breed. Common eye conditions seen {{in a variety of}} breeds such as cataracts and <b>glaucoma</b> can appear in Scotties as they age. There are no specific conditions relating the skin that affect the breed, but they can be affected by common dog related conditions such as parasites and mange. Scotties typically live from 11 to 13 years.|$|E
5|$|American Cocker Spaniels are {{susceptible}} {{to a variety of}} illnesses, particularly infections affecting their ears and, in some cases, their eyes. Although the number or percent of afflicted dogs is not known, progressive retinal atrophy (PRA), <b>glaucoma,</b> and cataracts have been identified in some members of the breed. The American Spaniel Club recommends annual eye exams by a veterinary ophthalmologist for all dogs that are to be used for breeding. Autoimmune problems in Cockers have also been identified in an unknown number or percent of the breed, including autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA). Ear inflammations are common in drop-eared breeds of dog, including the American Cocker, and luxating patellas and hip dysplasia have been identified in some members of the breed.|$|E
5|$|In 1978 Robert Randall {{sued the}} federal {{government}} for arresting him for using cannabis to treat his <b>glaucoma.</b> The judge ruled Randall needed cannabis for medical purposes and required the Food and Drug Administration set up a program to grow cannabis on a farm at the University of Mississippi and to distribute 300 cannabis cigarettes a month to Randall. In 1992 George H. W. Bush discontinued the program after Randall tried to make HIV/AIDS patients eligible for the program. Thirteen people were already enrolled and were allowed to continue receiving cannabis cigarettes; today the government still ships cannabis cigarettes to four people. Irvin Rosenfeld, who became eligible to receive cannabis from the program in 1982 to treat rare bone tumors, urged the George W. Bush administration to reopen the program; however, he was unsuccessful.|$|E
5|$|In January 1974, Brundage {{underwent}} surgery for cataracts and <b>glaucoma.</b> The necessary arrangements had initially {{been made by}} Brundage's protégé, Spanish IOC member Juan Antonio Samaranch, who would become IOC president in 1980. At the last moment, Brundage cancelled the plans, choosing to have the surgery in Munich, near the home he had purchased in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, site of the 1936Winter Olympics. After {{a month and a}} half, Brundage was discharged from the hospital, though whether the surgery had improved his vision was disputed, with Mariann Brundage stating that it did and Ruegsegger stating the contrary. Now frail, at age 87 he went with his wife on a final tour of the Far East. Despite the efforts of Olympic officials on his behalf, he was not given an invitation to mainland China, source of much of the art he loved. In April 1975, Brundage entered the hospital at Garmisch-Partenkirchen with flu and a severe cough. He died there on May 8, 1975, of heart failure.|$|E
5|$|Lennie {{started on}} the family's player piano {{at the age of}} two or three. He had {{classical}} piano lessons when he was eight, but indicated later that they had hindered, rather than helped, his development. He was born with weak eyesight, possibly as a consequence of his mother being affected by the 1918–19 flu pandemic during pregnancy. A bout of measles when aged six may have exacerbated his condition, and by the age of nine or ten he was totally blind as a result of <b>glaucoma.</b> He initially went to standard state schools, but attended the Illinois School for the Blind in Jacksonville for a decade from around 1928. During his school days he played several instruments, including saxophones, trumpet, guitar, and drums. At the age of eleven he had his first gigs, playing clarinet in a brothel.|$|E
5|$|Lens luxation, {{also known}} as ectopia lentis {{is the most common}} {{hereditary}} disorder in Jack Russell terriers. Even so, this condition is not a common occurrence in the breed. Most frequently appearing in dogs between the ages of 3 and 8 years old, it is where the lens in one or both eyes becomes displaced. There are two types, posterior luxation (where the lens slips {{to the back of the}} eye) and anterior luxation (where the lens slips forward). Posterior luxation is the less severe of the two types, as the eye can appear normal although the dog's eyesight will be affected. In anterior luxation, the lens can slip forward and rub against the cornea, damaging it. Anterior luxation also has a high probability of causing <b>glaucoma</b> which can lead to partial or complete blindness. Treatment is available and may include both medical and surgical options. Secondary lens luxation is caused by trauma to the eye and is not hereditary. The condition appears in a number of terrier breeds as well as the Border collie, Brittany and Cardigan Welsh corgi.|$|E
5|$|The {{survey showed}} that the breeds suffer from similar rates of ongoing health conditions, with one exception. Whereas {{more than a quarter}} of Pembroke Welsh Corgis {{surveyed}} suffered from some type of eye condition, only 6.1% of the Cardigan Corgis did. Eye conditions typical in the Corgi breeds include progressive retinal atrophy, which occurs more often in dogs over six years of age, and canine <b>glaucoma,</b> which again is more common in older dogs. Similar percentages in the survey were seen in both breeds for issues relating to reproduction, such as requiring caesarian sections and having false pregnancies. Further similarities were also seen related to musculoskelatal issues, including arthritis. However, Hip dysplasia, common in some types of dogs, is rare in the Corgi breeds.|$|E
25|$|Open-angle <b>glaucoma</b> {{accounts}} for 90% of <b>glaucoma</b> {{cases in the}} United States. Closed-angle <b>glaucoma</b> {{accounts for}} less than 10% of <b>glaucoma</b> cases in the United States, but {{as many as half}} of <b>glaucoma</b> cases in other nations (particularly East Asian countries).|$|E
25|$|<b>Glaucoma</b> is a {{group of}} eye {{diseases}} which result in damage to the optic nerve and vision loss. The most common type is open-angle <b>glaucoma</b> with less common types including closed-angle <b>glaucoma</b> and normal-tension <b>glaucoma.</b> Open-angle <b>glaucoma</b> develops slowly over time and there is no pain. Side vision may begin to decrease followed by central vision resulting in blindness if not treated. Closed-angle <b>glaucoma</b> can present gradually or suddenly. The sudden presentation may involve severe eye pain, blurred vision, mid-dilated pupil, redness of the eye, and nausea. Vision loss from <b>glaucoma,</b> once it has occurred, is permanent.|$|E
25|$|No clear {{evidence}} indicates vitamin deficiencies cause <b>glaucoma</b> in humans. It follows, then, that oral vitamin supplementation {{is not a}} recommended treatment for <b>glaucoma.</b> Caffeine increases intraocular pressure in those with <b>glaucoma,</b> but {{does not appear to}} affect normal individuals.|$|E
25|$|<b>Glaucoma</b> - <b>Glaucoma</b> {{can also}} be a common issue amongst Griffons owing to the breed's facial {{features}} and eye size.|$|E
25|$|If treated early it is {{possible}} to slow or stop the progression of disease with medication, laser treatment, or surgery. The goal of these treatments is to decrease eye pressure. A number of different classes of <b>glaucoma</b> medication are available. Laser treatments may be effective in both open-angle and closed-angle <b>glaucoma.</b> A number of types of <b>glaucoma</b> surgeries may be used in people who do not respond sufficiently to other measures. Treatment of closed-angle <b>glaucoma</b> is a medical emergency.|$|E
25|$|Absolute <b>glaucoma</b> (H44.5) {{is the end}} {{stage of}} all types of <b>glaucoma.</b> The eye has no vision, absence of pupillary light reflex and pupillary response, and has a stony appearance. Severe pain is present in the eye. The {{treatment}} of absolute <b>glaucoma</b> is a destructive procedure like cyclocryoapplication, cyclophotocoagulation, or injection of 99% alcohol.|$|E
25|$|Many {{people of}} East Asian descent {{are prone to}} {{developing}} angle closure <b>glaucoma</b> due to shallower anterior chamber depths, {{with the majority of}} cases of <b>glaucoma</b> in this population consisting of some form of angle closure. Higher rates of <b>glaucoma</b> have also been reported for Inuit populations, compared to white populations, in Canada and Greenland.|$|E
25|$|Acetazolamide, {{sold under}} the trade name Diamox among others, is a {{medication}} {{used to treat}} <b>glaucoma,</b> epilepsy, altitude sickness, periodic paralysis, idiopathic intracranial hypertension, and heart failure. It may be used long term {{for the treatment of}} open angle <b>glaucoma</b> and short term for acute angle closure <b>glaucoma</b> until surgery can be carried out. It is taken by mouth or injection into a vein.|$|E
25|$|The modern {{goals of}} <b>glaucoma</b> {{management}} are to avoid glaucomatous damage and nerve damage, and preserve visual field and total {{quality of life}} for patients, with minimal side effects. This requires appropriate diagnostic techniques and follow-up examinations, and judicious selection of treatments for the individual patient. Although intraocular pressure {{is only one of the}} major risk factors for <b>glaucoma,</b> lowering it via various pharmaceuticals and/or surgical techniques is currently the mainstay of <b>glaucoma</b> treatment.|$|E
25|$|Of {{the several}} causes for <b>glaucoma,</b> ocular {{hypertension}} (increased pressure within the eye) {{is the most}} important risk factor in most glaucomas, but in some populations, only 50% of people with primary open-angle <b>glaucoma</b> actually have elevated ocular pressure.|$|E
