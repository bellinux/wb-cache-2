40|$|Intralabyrinthine schwannoma {{is a rare}} {{cause of}} sensorineural hearing loss and {{intractable}} vertigo. Schwannoma is a benign neoplasm of the nerve sheath. Acoustic schwannomas can arise anywhere along the entire course of the eighth cranial nerve, usually from intracanalicular portion of either the inferior or superior division of vestibular nerve. Intralabyrinthine schwannoma arises primarily from intralabyrinthine branches of the <b>eight</b> <b>cranial</b> <b>nerve</b> and initially have no component in the internal auditory canal (IAC). We report {{a case of a}} young lady with left sided progressive hearing loss. Magnetic resonance imaging of cochlea documented intralabyrinthine schwannoma (intracochlear type).

40|$|PST (post-stimulus time) and {{interval}} histograms {{computed from}} recorded spike trains {{are related to}} an average timing characteristics of the spike train. The exact nature of this relationship varies with recording parameters, interfering signals, the histogram bin width, and {{the duration of the}} measurement interval. This work describes the conditions under which a PST histogram can serve as an unbiased estimate of the ensemble average of a spike train's intensity and an interval histogram can serve as an unbiased estimate of the probability density function of the interspike intervals. Simulation studies are used to confirm the validity of the theoretical results.

40|$|Vestibular schwannomas are benign {{intracranial}} tumors {{which generally}} {{arise from the}} Schwann cells of the superior part of the vestibular portion of the <b>eight</b> <b>cranial</b> <b>nerve.</b> The most common symptoms accompanying vestibular schwannoma (VS) are unilateral hearing loss, tinnitus, vertigo and unsteadiness. For many years, microsurgical treatment of VS has been considered the ‘gold standard’. However, the treatment of VS continues to evolve {{with the advent of}} alternative treatment options such as wait and scan and stereotactic irradiation. Moreover, advances in MRI techniques have allowed for an early diagnosis and exact measurement of growth, which has led to an increased number of patients with small and minimally symptomatic tumors. As a result, the treatment of VS no longer involves life saving surgery, but prophylactic management of future morbidity. These developments have also created new insights into how vestibular schwannoma can be best treated, as it has become clear that the tumor may remain unchanged for many years. However, the treatment of VS patients still remains a matter of debate with advocates and opponents of each modality. Traditionally, the evaluation of VS treatment was performed using primary outcome measures such as mortality and morbidity. But the subject of quality of life (QoL) has increasingly become an important outcome measure in VS. QoL may provide clinicians valuable informati on that is not alway...|$|E
40|$|Objective. This study {{aimed to}} examine hearing {{function}} in children admitted with bacterial meningitis {{to determine the}} risk factors for sensorineural hearing loss. Setting. The {{study was conducted in}} the audiology unit and paediatric wards of Kenyatta National Hospital. Subjects and Methods. The study involved 83 {{children between the ages of}} six months and twelve years admitted with bacterial meningitis. The median age for the children examined was 14. On discharge they underwent hearing testing to evaluate for presence and degree of hearing loss. Results. Thirty six of the 83 children (44. 4 %) were found to have at least a unilateral mild sensorineural hearing loss during initial audiologic testing. Of the children with hearing loss, 22 (26. 5 %) had mild or moderate sensorineural hearing loss and 14 (16. 9 %) had severe or profound sensorineural hearing loss. Significant determinants identified for hearing loss included coma score below <b>eight,</b> seizures, <b>cranial</b> <b>nerve</b> neuropathy, positive CSF culture, and fever above 38. 7 degrees Celsius. Conclusions. Sensorineural hearing loss was found to be highly prevalent in children treated for bacterial meningitis.

50|$|In cases {{involving}} the basilar artery (VBD), the pathogenesis arises from direct compression of different <b>cranial</b> <b>nerves.</b> Additionally, ischemic {{effects on the}} brain stem and cerebellar hemispheres as well as symptoms related to hydrocephalus are common. Direct <b>cranial</b> <b>nerve</b> compression can lead to isolated <b>cranial</b> <b>nerve</b> dysfunction, usually associated with a normal-sized basilar artery that is tortuous and elongated. <b>Cranial</b> <b>nerve</b> dysfunction most commonly involves the VII <b>cranial</b> <b>nerve</b> and the V <b>cranial</b> <b>nerve.</b> Multiple <b>cranial</b> <b>nerve</b> dysfunction is {{far more likely to}} occur if there is dilation (ectasia) associated with a tortuous and elongated basilar artery. <b>Cranial</b> <b>nerves</b> affected in descending order of frequency include: VII, V, III, VIII, and VI.|$|R

40|$|Objectives: To {{identify}} the key predictive factors of radiation-induced <b>cranial</b> <b>nerve</b> palsy {{in patients with}} nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Method and materials: From November 1998 to December 2007, all consecutive patients with newly diagnosed NPC who were curatively treated with radiotherapy and subsequently developed radiation-induced <b>cranial</b> <b>nerve</b> palsy (RICNP) were included in our study. Patients with <b>cranial</b> <b>nerve</b> palsy due to disease recurrence were excluded. Their records were retrospectively reviewed. Results: Amongst 965 patients with NPC treated with radical radiotherapy, 41 developed new <b>cranial</b> <b>nerve</b> palsy. After exclusion of 5 patients with <b>cranial</b> <b>nerve</b> palsy due to recurrence, 36 (3. 7 %) developed RICNP. The median follow-up was 8. 9 years (range, 3. 2 - 11. 3 years). Ten of the 36 patients had <b>cranial</b> <b>nerve</b> palsy at presentation. Twenty-seven patients had single <b>cranial</b> <b>nerve</b> palsy and 9 patients had multiple <b>cranial</b> <b>nerve</b> palsy. The most commonly involved <b>cranial</b> <b>nerve</b> was <b>cranial</b> <b>nerve</b> XII, with 30 patients having palsy of <b>cranial</b> <b>nerve</b> XII and 6 of them having bilateral <b>cranial</b> <b>nerve</b> XII palsies. Magnetic resonance imaging features of radiation-induced hypoglossal nerve palsy were demonstrated in our study. Multivariate analysis revealed that <b>cranial</b> <b>nerve</b> palsy at presentation was an independent prognostic factor {{for the development of}} RICNP. Other factors including T staging, N staging, gender, age, radiotherapy technique and the use of chemotherapy have no significant relationship with the risk of developing RICNP. Conclusion: RICNP in patients with NPC is not a rare complication, and <b>cranial</b> <b>nerve</b> palsy at presentation is an important prognostic factor. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

50|$|An {{important}} part of the physical exam is also assessment of the <b>cranial</b> <b>nerves.</b> Due to the unconscious status of the patient, {{only a limited number of}} the nerves can be assessed. These include the <b>cranial</b> <b>nerves</b> number 2 (CN II), number 3 (CN III), number 5 (CN V), number 7 (CN VII), and <b>cranial</b> <b>nerves</b> 9 and 10 (CN IX, CN X). Gag reflex helps assess <b>cranial</b> <b>nerves</b> 9 and 10. Pupil reaction to light is important because it shows an intact retina, and <b>cranial</b> <b>nerve</b> number 2 (CN II); if pupils are reactive to light, then that also indicates that the <b>cranial</b> <b>nerve</b> number 3 (CN III) (or at least its parasympathetic fibers) are intact. Corneal reflex assess the integrity of <b>cranial</b> <b>nerve</b> number 7 (CN VII), and <b>cranial</b> <b>nerve</b> number 5 (CN V). <b>Cranial</b> <b>nerve</b> number 5 (CN V), and its ophthalmic branch (V1) are responsible for the afferent arm of the reflex, and the <b>cranial</b> <b>nerve</b> number 7 (CN VII) also known a facial nerve, is responsible for the efferent arm, causing contraction of the muscle orbicularis oculi resulting in closing of the eyes.|$|R
