The casualties amounted to 1,413 killed, and 3,409 wounded. The success of anti-air defence measures was limited; of the 397 aircraft {{that had taken}} part in raids, only 24 Gothas were shot down (though 37 more were lost <b>in</b> <b>accidents),</b> despite an estimated rate of 14,540 anti-air rounds per aircraft. Anti-zeppelin defences were more successful, with 17 shot down and 21 lost <b>in</b> <b>accidents.</b>|$|E

5|$|Australian National Airways (ANA) never {{recovered}} from {{the crash of the}} Amana. Since the beginning of 1945, 77 people had been killed <b>in</b> <b>accidents</b> in aircraft operated by ANA. In late 1948, ANA suffered 4 crashes in 4 months. The loss of ANA's reputation as a safe airline, together with the unblemished safety record and growing commercial success of its rival Trans Australia Airlines, sent ANA into decline. In 1957 ANA was taken over by Ansett Transport Industries Limited and merged with Ansett Airways to form the domestic airline Ansett-ANA.|$|E

In 2007, four Apache helicopters were destroyed on the ground by insurgent mortar fire using web-published geotagged photographs taken by soldiers. Several AH-64s were lost to accidents in Afghanistan as of 2012. Most Apaches that took heavy damage were able to continue their missions and return safely.|$|E

40|$|It {{is argued}} that doctors who work <b>in</b> <b>accident</b> and {{emergency}} departments should play their part <b>in</b> road <b>accident</b> prevention. It is suggested {{that this might be}} done in the field of research, by direct action, through education of the public and by influencing legislation. Examples are given of both small and simple, and major national research projects based <b>in</b> <b>accident</b> and emergency departments. The type of direct action envisaged is modelled on the work of Dr Hayle Hadeson <b>in</b> preventing <b>accidents</b> to children. Examples of the education of the public are drawn from publicity work in the seat-belt campaign, and experiences of lobbying members of parliament in relation to seat-belt legislation are described. The relative under-funding of trauma research compared with cancer of heart disease research is seen as a measure of society's lack of interest <b>in</b> <b>accident</b> prevention, and colleagues unchallenged to do more to alter this situation...|$|R
5|$|Since a {{major cause}} of TBI are vehicle accidents, their {{prevention}} or the amelioration of their consequences can both reduce the incidence and gravity of TBI. <b>In</b> <b>accidents,</b> damage can be reduced by use of seat belts, child safety seats and motorcycle helmets, and presence of roll bars and airbags. Education programs exist to lower the number of crashes. In addition, changes to public policy and safety laws can be made; these include speed limits, seat belt and helmet laws, and road engineering practices.|$|E
5|$|The Bombing of Yawata on {{the night}} of 15/16June 1944 was the first air raid on the Japanese home islands {{conducted}} by United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) strategic bombers during World War II. The raid was undertaken by 75 B-29 Superfortress heavy bombers staging from bases in China. Only 47 of these aircraft bombed the raid's primary target, the Imperial Iron and Steel Works at Yawata in northern Kyūshū, and little damage was caused. Five B-29s were lost <b>in</b> <b>accidents</b> during the operation and two were destroyed by Japanese aircraft.|$|E
5|$|The {{division}} used approximately 20 Tetrarchs {{during the}} British airborne landings in Normandy in June 1944. The tanks were successfully landed by glider, {{but they did}} not perform well. Several were lost <b>in</b> <b>accidents,</b> and those that did see action proved to be inferior in firepower and armour to the armoured fighting vehicles of the German forces. A few days after the beginning of the operation, the tanks were removed from direct engagement with German armour and used only to provide fire support. By August 1944, most of the Tetrarchs in action were replaced with Cromwell cruiser tanks, and the remainder were replaced by the M22 Locust in December 1944.|$|E
