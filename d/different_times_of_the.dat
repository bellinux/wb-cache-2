The specific genera that inhabit the lake vary at <b>different</b> <b>times</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> year and also at different depths within the lake. Due {{to the presence}} of light attenuation in the lake, light plays a role in determining which species of cyanobacteria inhabit it.|$|E
5|$|Because the Earth's axis is tilted {{relative}} to its orbital plane, sunlight is incident at different angles at <b>different</b> <b>times</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> year. In June the Northern Hemisphere is tilted towards the sun, so {{at any given}} Northern Hemisphere latitude sunlight falls more directly on that spot than in December (see Effect of sun angle on climate). This effect causes seasons. Over thousands {{to hundreds of thousands}} of years, changes in Earth's orbital parameters affect the amount and distribution of solar energy received by the Earth and influence long-term climate.

While the area was obviously primarily used for public bathing, one could exercise and enjoy a variety of recreational activities.

5|$|Fossil {{evidence}} indicates that other notable species of sharks, such as the great white shark, responded to competitive pressure from megalodon by avoiding regions it inhabited by mainly inhabiting the cooler waters of the time. In areas where their ranges seemed to overlap, such as in Pliocene Baja California, {{it is possible that}} megalodon and the great white shark occupied the area at <b>different</b> <b>times</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> year while following different migratory prey. Megalodon probably also had a tendency for cannibalism, much like contemporary sharks.|$|E
5|$|Social {{behaviour}} {{is influenced}} by the climate and geography; as such, the impala are territorial at certain times of the year and gregarious at other times, and the length of these periods can vary broadly among populations. For instance, populations in southern Africa display territorial behaviour only during the few months of the rut, whereas in eastern African populations, territoriality is relatively minimal despite a protracted mating season. Moreover, territorial males often tolerate bachelors, and may even alternate between bachelorhood and territoriality at <b>different</b> <b>times</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> year. A study of impala in the Serengeti National Park showed that in 94% of the males, territoriality was observed for less than four months.|$|E

40|$|Technetium- 99 m (99 m Tc) -pertechnetate single photon {{emission}} computed tomography (SPECT) allows non-invasive measurement of gastric accommodation (GA) {{and has been}} reported to provide the results comparable to the gold standard barostat. <b>The</b> reproducibility <b>of</b> <b>the</b> test when it is performed at <b>different</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> day is not known. <b>The</b> aim <b>of</b> this study was to assess <b>the</b> reproducibility <b>of</b> GA measurement by 99 m Tc-pertechnetate SPECT at <b>the</b> same and <b>different</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> day. Methods Three GA studies were performed in each of 20 healthy volunteers (9 males, age 35 ± 9 years), 2 studies in the morning and 1 study in the afternoon. Each study was performed on separate days at least 3 days apart, in random order. The fasting gastric scintigraphy images were acquired using SPECT at 30 minutes after iv 99 m Tc-pertechnetate. Then, the scintigraphic images were acquired 50 minutes after liquid meal (250 mL, Ensure Ⓡ) ingestions. Gastric volumes were calculated from transaxial gastric im-ages using Image J software. The GA was defined as the maximum postprandial gastric volume minus fasting gastric volume. Results GA measurement by SPECT show good reproducibility at both <b>the</b> same and <b>different</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> day. The intraclass correlation coefficients of GA results for the same <b>time,</b> the first <b>different</b> <b>time</b> and the second <b>different</b> <b>time</b> studies were 0. 681, 0. 630 and 0. 774, respectively, and <b>the</b> intra-subject coefficients <b>of</b> variation were 13. 9 %, 14. 1 % and 8. 7 %, respectively.

5|$|The {{combination}} {{of wind and}} solar PV has the advantage that the two sources complement each other because the peak operating times for each system occur at <b>different</b> <b>times</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> day and year. The power generation of such solar hybrid power systems is therefore more constant and fluctuates less than {{each of the two}} component subsystems. Solar power is seasonal, particularly in northern/southern climates, away from the equator, suggesting a need for long term seasonal storage in a medium such as hydrogen or pumped hydroelectric. The Institute for Solar Energy Supply Technology of the University of Kassel pilot-tested a combined power plant linking solar, wind, biogas and hydrostorage to provide load-following power from renewable sources.|$|E

5|$|Aveni {{states that}} one of the {{strengths}} of the Brown methodology is that it can explore astronomies invisible to statistical analysis and offers the astronomy of the Incas as another example. The empire of the Incas was conceptually divided using ceques radial routes emanating from the capital at Cusco. Thus there are alignments in all directions which would suggest there is little of astronomical significance, However, ethnohistorical records show that the various directions do have cosmological and astronomical significance with various points in the landscape being significant at <b>different</b> <b>times</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> year. In eastern Asia archaeoastronomy has developed from the History of Astronomy and much archaeoastronomy is searching for material correlates of the historical record. This is due to the rich historical record of astronomical phenomena which, in China, stretches back into the Han dynasty, in the second century BC.|$|E
5|$|The blue-faced honeyeater {{appears to}} be {{generally}} sedentary within its range, especially {{in much of the}} Northern Territory, Queensland and New South Wales. However, in many places (generally south of the Tropic of Capricorn), populations may be present or absent at <b>different</b> <b>times</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> year, although this appears to result from nomadic rather than seasonal migratory movements. Around Wellington in central New South Wales, birds were recorded over winter months, and were more common in autumn around the Talbragar River. Birds were present all year round near Inverell in northern New South Wales, but noted to be flying eastwards from January to May, and westwards in June and July. In Jandowae in southeastern Queensland, birds were regularly recorded flying north and east from March to June, and returning south and west in July and August, and were absent from the area in spring and summer.|$|E
