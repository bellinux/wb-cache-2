40|$|Posttranslational {{modifications}} (PTMs) are ubiquitous chemical alterations {{that are}} made to peptides and proteins after ribosomal synthesis. The non-templated nature of PTMs hinders the ability to study an individual isoform of a given protein, which may be expressed as complex mixtures in vivo. This thesis describes ligation-based strategies {{for use in the}} chemical synthesis of PTM peptides and proteins. Chapter one describes the development of a synthesis of the antibacterial PTM peptide microcin B 17 (MccB 17). Using Ag(I) -ligation chemistryMccB 17 was synthesised efficiently from three precursors. This strategy permitted the synthesis of 7 analogues for use in structure-activity relationship studies. A truncated analogue of MccB 17 was shown to be a more potent poison of DNA gyrase, the target of MccB 17, compared with MccB 17. Chapter two describes ligation–desulfurisation chemistry at β-SH aspartate (Asp). A protected form of β SH Asp was accessed efficiently in 3 -steps for direct use in peptide synthesis. Ligation reactions of peptides bearing this amino acid were rapid and ligated products could be desulfurised to afford peptides bearing the native Asp residue in high yields. Computational analysis then prompted exploration of chemoselective <b>desulfurisation</b> of β-SH Asp in the presence of Cys residues. This strategy permitted the synthesis of the N-terminal extracellular domain of CXCR 4, bearing a sTyr residue and an N-linked glycan. Chapter three outlines the use of a new alkyl thiol additive for use in one pot ligation–desulfurisation chemistry, namely 2, 2, 2 -trifluoroethanethiol (TFET). This alkyl thiol facilitated ligation rates similar to the current gold standard thiol additives. Importantly, the alkyl nature of TFET allowed <b>desulfurisation</b> to be conducted in the same vessel, a feat not possible with aryl thiol additives. Through the use of TFET, the synthesis of four sulfoforms of the 60 amino acid (sulfo) protein madanin- 1 was achieved. Access is restricted to staff and students of the University of Sydney.

Following initial investigation of classical routes to indolo[2, 3 -a]pyrrolo[3, 4 -c]carbazole aglycons, a new strategy employing base-mediated condensation of thiourea and guanidine with a bisindolyl β-ketoester intermediate afforded novel 5, 6 -bisindolylpyrimidin- 4 (3 H) -ones in moderate yields. Chemical diversity within this H-bonding scaffold was then studied by substitution with a panel of biologically relevant electrophiles, and by reductive <b>desulfurisation.</b> Optimisation of difficult heterogeneous literature conditions for oxidative <b>desulfurisation</b> of thiouracils was also accomplished, enabling a mild route to a novel 5, 6 -bisindolyluracil pharmacophore to be developed within this work. The oxidative cyclisation of selected acyclic bisindolyl systems to form a new planar class of indolo[2, 3 -a]pyrimido[5, 4 -c]carbazoles was also investigated. Successful conditions for this transformation, as well as the limitations currently prevailing for this approach are discussed. Synthesis of 3, 4 -bisindolyl- 5 -aminopyrazole as a potential isostere of bisindolylmaleimide agents was encountered, along with a comprehensive derivatisation study, in order to probe the chemical space for potential protein backbone H-bonding interactions. Synthesis of a related 3, 4 -arylindolyl- 5 -aminopyrazole series was also undertaken, based on identification of potent kinase inhibition within a closely related heterocyclic template. Following synthesis of approximately 50 novel compounds with a diversity of H-bonding enzyme-interacting potential within these classes, biological studies confirmed that significant topo II inhibition was present for 9 lead compounds, in previously unseen pyrazolo[1, 5 -a]pyrimidine, indolo[2, 3 -c]carbazole and branched S,N-disubstituted thiouracil derivative series. NCI- 60 cancer cell line growth inhibition data for 6 representative compounds also revealed interesting selectivity differences between each compound class, while a new pyrimido[5, 4 -c]carbazole agent strongly inhibited cancer cell division at 10 µM, with appreciable cytotoxic activity observed across several tumour types...|$|E

Dibenzothiophene, a more accurate model for organic sulfur in coal, displays no reactivity towards the iron carbonyl, suggesting that the more condensed systems will desulfurise less readily. Microwave methodology has been successful in accelerating the {{reactions of}} thiophenes with Fe 3 (CO) 12. However, reaction of benzothiophene does not proceed to the <b>desulfurisation</b> stage while dibenzothiophene is unreactive even under microwave conditions. Tellurophenes (Te analogues of thiophenes) are shown to mimic the behaviour of thiophenes towards certain organometallic reagents with the advantage that their greater reactivity enables recovery of products in higher yields. Hence, reaction of tellurophene with Fe 3 (CO) 12 again affords the ferrole but with an almost ten-fold increase in yield over thiophene. More significantly, dibenzotellurophene is also detellurated by the iron carbonyl affording the previously inaccessible dibenzoferrole, C 12 H 8. Fe 2 (CO) 6, thereby demonstrating the mechanistic feasibility of dechalcogenation of the more condensed aromatic molecules. The potential of tellurium heterocycles to act as precursors for novel organometallics is also recognised owing to the relatively facile elimination of the heteroatom from these systems.
