25|$|Ice {{cream is}} a {{colloidal}} emulsion having dispersed phase as fat globules. It is an emulsion {{which is in}} the end made into foam by incorporating air cells which is frozen to form dispersed ice cells. In the composition of ice cream ice crystals are of most importance as they give a desirable mouth feel. Ice cream is composed of water, <b>ice,</b> <b>milk</b> fat, milk protein, sugar and air. Water and fat have highest proportions by weight creating an emulsion. The triacylglycerols in far are non polar and will adhere to itself by van der Waals interactions. Water is polar thus, emulsifiers are needed for dispersion of fat. Also ice cream has a colloidal phase of foam which helps in light texture. Milk proteins such as casein and whey protein present in ice cream are amphiphilic, can adsorb water and form micelles which will contribute to consistency. Sucrose which is disaccharide is usually used as a sweetening agent. Lactose which is sugar present in milk will cause freezing point depression. Thus, on freezing some water will be unfrozen and will not give hard texture.|$|E

In 1989, the creamery {{expanded its}} products to include frozen yogurt and filed {{for a new}} trademark for this new line of products. Upon learning of the registration request, the Hershey Company—then named Hershey Foods—demanded the company cease production of the products claiming it violated Hershey Company's trademarks. The creamery dropped its application, but continued releasing the products, so in May 1990, Hershey Company filed suit in the Middle District court of Pennsylvania seeking a legal injunction to stop Hershey Creamery from producing and marketing its Hershey's branded frozen yogurt, {{as well as to}} attempt to stop the company from using the [...] "Hershey's" [...] trademark outside of its [...] "traditional thirteen-state trading area" [...] and to demand that the company include a disclaimer disavowing its relation to Hershey Company on all of its products. Hershey Creamery counter sued in the New York South District court, concerned that Hershey Company demands reneged on the 1967 settlement, and requested the Pennsylvania court actions be transferred to the New York court as that was where the settlement was originally handled. The request was denied and the court instead blocked the Hershey Creamery's suit in New York. The Creamery appealed but this was denied.|$|E
