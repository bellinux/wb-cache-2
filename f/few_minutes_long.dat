He worked extensively with the ethnographer and British Columbia native George Hunt in 1910, which inspired his work with the Kwakiutl, but much of their collaboration remains unpublished. At the end of 1912, Curtis decided to create a feature film depicting Native American life, partly {{as a way of}} improving his financial situation and partly because film technology had improved {{to the point where it}} was conceivable to create and screen films more than a <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>long.</b> Curtis chose the Kwakiutl tribe, of the Queen Charlotte Strait region of the Central Coast of British Columbia, Canada, for his subject. His film, In the Land of the Head Hunters, was the first feature-length film whose cast was composed entirely of Native North Americans.|$|E

40|$|Starting from stacked binary {{sulphide}} precursor layers with {{copper and}} zinc rich composition {{the formation of}} Cu 2 ZnSnS 4 kesterite has been investigated. Precursors with different layer thicknesses were deposited to evaluate the influence of material transport on the reaction kinetics. During annealing experiments the formation of kesterite in the different precursors was monitored by in situ energy dispersive X ray diffraction. An evaluation of the reaction rates revealed that at a temperature of 500 C a kesterite film of 2 m thickness can be formed within <b>few</b> <b>minutes.</b> The <b>long</b> annealing times reported in literature for well performing kesterite photovoltaic absorbers do therefore not owe to a general kinetic limitation {{for the formation of}} kesterite thin film...|$|R
40|$|Parking {{in crowded}} urban areas is a {{precious}} resource that impacts driver stress levels, daily productivity, and the environment. A reservation system that enables individuals to buy parking spots prior to leaving their home would significantly ease these concerns. However, designing an infrastructure for guaranteed parking requires extensive sensor deployment and manpower, which is expensive and time-consuming proposition. In this paper, we present CrowdPark, a crowdsourcing platform that enables users to “loosely reserve ” parking spots. Unlike traditional reservation platforms where sellers {{are usually the}} owners of resources, CrowdPark achieves parking reservation by crowdsourcing information about when parking resources will be available, and using this availability information to help other users find parking spots. The design of such a crowdsourcing-based parking reservation system presents several challenges including incentive design, robustness to malicious users, and handling the spatial and temporal uncertainty due to real-world vagaries. We present novel solutions to address these challenges that combine protocol design, game-theoretic and cost-benefit analysis, sensor data processing techniques, and navigation-based tools. With a combination of simulation and real-world experiments, we show that CrowdPark can 1) effectively incentivize user participation and detect malicious users with accuracy of over 95 %, and 2) handle over 95 % of spatial uncertainty and achieve over 90 % successful parking reservation with a <b>few</b> <b>minute</b> <b>long</b> waiting time. 1...|$|R

He was later replaced by the newly created dog character Moppi, who debuted on April 3, 1976 and starred alongside Pitti and Schnatterinchen in more than 400 Abendgruß episodes. As with Meister Nadelöhr, Pittiplatsch and his friends also still starred alongside their human companion Fabian in some Abendgruß episodes.

40|$|Messenger RNA (mRNA) {{stability}} {{is a critical}} determinant that affects gene expression. Many pathways have evolved to modulate mRNA stability in response to developmental, physiological and/or environmental stimuli. Eukaryotic mRNAs have a considerable range of half-lives, from as short as a <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> to as <b>long</b> as several days. Human globin mRNAs constitute an example of highly stable mRNAs. However, {{a wide variety of}} naturally occurring mutations that result in the clinical syndrome of thalassemia can trigger accelerated mRNA decay thus controlling mRNA quality prior to translation. Distinct surveillance mechanisms have been described as being targeted for specific defective globin mRNAs. Here, we review mRNA stability mechanisms implicated in the control of beta-globin gene expression and the surveillance pathways that prevent translation of aberrant beta-globin mRNAs. In addition, we emphasize the importance of these pathways in modulating the severity of the beta-thalassemia phenotype...|$|R

No wonder that they wailed, for over twelve thousand men, or nearly a fifth of the Kukuana army, had been destroyed in that awful struggle. It was heart-rending to lie and listen to their cries for those who never would return; and it made me understand the full horror of the work done that day to further man's ambition. Towards midnight, however, the ceaseless crying of the women grew less frequent, till at length the silence was only broken at intervals of a <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> by a <b>long</b> piercing howl that came from a hut in our immediate rear, which, as I afterwards discovered, proceeded from Gagool [...] "keening" [...] over the dead king Twala.|$|R
50|$|Some {{styles of}} music place an {{emphasis}} on certain of these fundamentals, while others place less emphasis on certain elements. To give one example, while Bebop-era jazz makes use of very complex chords, including altered dominants and challenging chord progressions, with chords changing two or more times per bar and keys changing several times in a tune, funk places most of its emphasis on rhythm and groove, with entire songs based around a vamp on a single chord. While Romantic era classical music from the mid- to late-1800s makes great use of dramatic changes of dynamics, from whispering pianissimo sections to thunderous fortissimo sections, some entire Baroque dance suites for harpsichord from the early 1700s may use a single dynamic. To give another example, while some art music pieces, such as symphonies are very long, some pop songs are just a <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>long.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The innkeepers of uranian taverns, but {{certainly}} not just them, organize large urning balls, especially {{in the course of}} the winter, that, in their size and type, are a specialty of Berlin. Outstanding strangers, especially foreigners, who want to see something very special in the youngest European world-cities, are shown by higher officials these balls as one of the most interesting sights. ... During the high season from October to Easter, these balls are held several times a week, often even several a night. Even though the entrance fee is rarely less than 1.50 marks, these events are usually well visited. Almost always, several secret policemen are present that make sure that nothing disgraceful happens; as far as I am informed, there was never any occasion to intervene. The organizers have the right to admit, if possible, only people who are known to them as homosexual.Some of the balls were especially well known, particularly those shortly after New Year, on which the new, often self-made dresses are presented. When I visited this ball last year with some medical colleagues, there were about 800 people participating. Around 10 o'clock in the evening, the large halls are still almost deserted. The rooms begin to fill only after eleven o'clock. Many visitors dress in formal or street suit, but many are costumed. Some appear densely masked in impenetrable dominoes, they come and go without anyone knowing who they are; others reveal their faces at midnight, some come in fantastical costumes, a large part in evening gowns, some in simple, others in very elaborate toilets. I saw a South American man in a robe from Paris, it's price had to be over 2,000 francs.Not few seem so feminine in their appearance and movements, that even connoisseurs find it hard to recognize the man. ... Real women are only very sparse on these balls, only now and then does a uranist bring his landlady, a friend, or... his wife. In the case of the uranist, one does not proceed so strictly as on the analogous urninde balls, on which [...] "real men" [...] are strictly denied access. Most distasteful and repulsive sighton the balls are the not so infrequent gentlemen that, in spite of coming [...] "as women", keep their stately mustaches or even a full-beard. The most beautiful costumes are greeted by a sign of the ceremony master with a thundering fanfare and guided by him through the hall. Between 12 and 1 o'clock the ball usually reaches its peak. At about 2 o'clock, the coffee break — the main source of income for the owner — takes place.

Common triggers include pain or stimulation, body turning or movements, and bladder distention. Bladder distention has been observed in patients being treated in intensive care units with the concurrent use of catheters. Symptoms of PSH can last from weeks to years following initial onset. As episodes persist over time, they have been found to become less frequent in occurrence but last for prolonged periods.|$|R
