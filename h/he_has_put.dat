25|$|Gibbs {{has scored}} two double centuries in his Test career, both {{contrasting}} innings. His first was an innings of 211 not out against New Zealand at Jade Stadium in 1999. His innings took 468 balls while his second double century, 228 against Pakistan came off just 240 balls. In that innings in Newlands, he reached a national record partnership of 368 with Graeme Smith. <b>He</b> <b>has</b> <b>put</b> on a further two 300-run opening stands with his captain, making them the only pair in Test history to break 300 on three occasions. He also holds the South African second wicket record, a partnership of 315* with Jacques Kallis.|$|E
25|$|The return {{excursion}} train {{which was}} due to leave London at ten minutes before twelve on Saturday night last arrived at Bourne between three and four o'clock on Sunday morning. When near the platform at Bourne station the engine came into violent collision with two empty carriages which were standing upon the line, driving them completely through two very strong gates at the South Street crossing, one of the gates being smashed to splinters, and the carriages considerably damaged. There were nine passengers (including two ladies) in the carriage attached to the engine {{and we have not}} heard of anyone sustaining greater injury than a severe shaking.

But, according to Hulme, Hamilton has underestimated the [...] "innovative and creative potential of collective humanity" [...] and <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>put</b> too much faith in the infallibility of science's predictions about future climate risks. Hulme believes that Hamilton [...] "is placing too much weight on the foresight of science to provide his desired revolution, rather than calling for it more honestly and directly through political, psychological or spiritual engagement".|$|E

With Stewie's reluctant help, Brian gives his mother a proper burial. The pair eventually complete their journey home by riding in an open boxcar, where Brian attempts to apologize to Stewie for all of the trouble <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>put</b> both of them through, only to have Stewie reply that he actually enjoyed it.

Sir Alex Ferguson remarked: [...] "As far as I was concerned, he [...] won the Champions League for Chelsea." [...] Drogba's headed effort marked his ninth goal in nine cup final appearances for Chelsea, Chelsea legend Gianfranco Zola spoke after the match about Drogba's ability in big games: [...] "In all their very important matches <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>put</b> a stamp on it."

500|$|In {{the second}} plate, {{the scene is}} Thavies Inn Gate (sometimes {{ironically}} written as Thieves Inn Gate), one of the Inns of Chancery which housed associations of lawyers in London. Tom Nero has grown up and become a hackney coachman, and the recreational cruelty of the schoolboy has turned into the professional cruelty of a man at work. Tom's horse, worn out from years of mistreatment and overloading, has collapsed, breaking its leg and upsetting the carriage. Disregarding the animal's pain, Tom has beaten it so furiously that <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>put</b> its eye out. In a satirical aside, Hogarth shows four corpulent barristers struggling {{to climb out of}} the carriage in a ludicrous state. They are probably caricatures of eminent jurists, but Hogarth did not reveal the subjects' names, and they have not been identified. Elsewhere in the scene, other acts of cruelty against animals take place: a drover beats a lamb to death, an ass is driven on by force despite being overloaded, and an enraged bull tosses one of its tormentors. Some of these acts are recounted in the moral accompanying the print: ...|$|E
500|$|There are {{a number}} of {{versions}} of the story of Cú Chulainn's miraculous birth. In the earliest version of Compert C(h)on Culainn ("The Conception of Cú Chulainn"), his mother Deichtine is the daughter and charioteer of Conchobar mac Nessa, king of Ulster, and accompanies him as he and the nobles of Ulster hunt a flock of magical birds. As snow begins to fall, [...] Ulstermen seek shelter in a nearby house. As the host's wife goes into labour, Deichtine assists in the birth of a baby boy, while a mare gives birth to twin colts. The next morning, the Ulstermen find themselves at the Brug na Bóinde (the Neolithic mound at Newgrange)—the house and its occupants have disappeared, but the child and the colts remain. Deichtine takes the boy home and begins raising him as her own, but the boy falls ill and dies. The god Lug appears to her and tells her he was their host that night, and that <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>put</b> his child in her womb, who is to be called Sétanta. Her pregnancy turns into a scandal as she is betrothed to Sualtam mac Róich, and the Ulstermen suspect Conchobar of being the father, so she aborts the child and goes to her husband's bed [...] "virgin-whole". She then conceives a son whom she names Sétanta.|$|E
500|$|That winter, The Cricketer {{magazine}} named Chapman {{as a young}} cricketer of the year. However, at {{the beginning}} of the 1922 season, his form was so poor that critics suggested leaving him out of the University Match. He had scored 300 runs from 14 innings, but retained his place partially on the strength of his fielding. After Cambridge batted very slowly on the first day, Chapman attacked the bowling on the second morning to score 102 not out. Cambridge won easily, concluding Chapman's cricket at the university, but his innings impressed critics to the extent that he was again selected for the Gentlemen v Players match at Lord's. There, he scored 160 and shared century partnerships with Arthur Carr and Frank Mann. Chapman earned praise for his aggression and his stroke-play on the off side. The Times described it as [...] "one of the great innings in the history of the game". Shortly after this, Sydney Pardon wrote in The Times: [...] "In the cricket field the most interesting figure at the moment is, beyond all comparison, Mr. A. P. F. Chapman. A fortnight ago we were all lamenting his ill-success this season and wondering whether he would ever do justice to his great gifts and fulfil the hopes entertained of him in 1920. Most effectually <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>put</b> his critics to shame... in such a position that if an England eleven had to meet Australia next week he would be picked at once with acclamation." [...] Prior to this, only R. E. Foster had scored centuries in both the University Match and the Gentlemen v Players match in the same year. Chapman ended his season by scoring 805 runs and taking 19 wickets for Berkshire, and playing in festival games. He aggregated 607 runs at 33.72 in first-class matches for the season.|$|E

2500|$|Weston won the {{starting}} quarterback position and led the Wolverines {{in the next six}} games, outscoring their opponents by a combined score of 234 to 3. After his first three starts, Weston faced a major test against a strong Nebraska team. In a profile of the Wolverines published the week before the game, The Lincoln Daily Star focused on Weston: [...] "Weston is continuing to improve at the quarterback. Work seems to agree with him; <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>put</b> on three pounds of weight since he became famous two weeks ago, being no longer the lightest man on the squad." [...] Leading the Wolverines to a 20-0 win over Nebraska, his reputation continued to grow.|$|E

2500|$|For Al-Albani, misyar {{marriage}} {{may even}} be considered as illicit, because it runs counter to the objectives {{and the spirit of}} marriage in Islam, as described in the Quran: [...] "And among His signs is this, that He created for you mates from among yourselves, that ye may dwell in tranquility with them, and <b>He</b> <b>has</b> <b>put</b> love and mercy between your (hearts)…" [...] Al-Albani also underlines the social problems which result from the [...] "misyar" [...] marriage, particularly in the event that children are born from this union. The children raised by their mother in a home from which the father is always absent, without reason, may suffer difficulties.

2500|$|Putting {{the verses}} {{regarding}} polygyny into the broader Qur'anic context {{by examining the}} nature of marriage in Islam helps understanding them. The Quran [...] refers to marriage as a mithaq, i.e. a solemn covenant or agreement between husband and wife, and enjoins that it be put down in writing (4:21). Marriage {{is more than just}} a [...] "solemn covenant" [...] however, with Surah 30 verse 21 stating [...] "And among His Signs is this, that He created for you mates from among yourselves, that ye may dwell in tranquillity with them, and <b>He</b> <b>has</b> <b>put</b> love and mercy between your (hearts): verily in that are Signs for those who reflect." [...] Love and mercy are very much a part of marriage as described in the Qur'an. Although the Qur'an may prescribe different roles for males (husbands often seen as the provider), the equality between husband and wife is promoted when it is dictated in Surah 2 verse 187 that [...] "They (your wives) are as a garment to you, and you are as a garment to them." [...] It is thus clear that there is more to polygyny in the scriptural basis of the Qur'an then simply the citation of Verse 4:3.|$|E
