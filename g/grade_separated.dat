5|$|A {{number of}} {{improvement}} works {{are planned for}} Tonkin Highway, which will see most of the central and northern sections upgraded to a freeway-standard road with <b>grade</b> <b>separated</b> interchanges. Extensions are also planned {{at both ends of}} the highway, which would see the southern end extended to South Western Highway south of Byford, and link the northern end to the future Perth Darwin National Highway near Ballajura.|$|E
5|$|More {{recent works}} have {{improved}} {{sections of the}} highway in Perth. Great Eastern Highway's intersection with Roe Highway was upgraded to a <b>grade</b> <b>separated</b> interchange. The design is a diamond interchange, with free-flowing traffic on Roe Highway, and an additional looped ramp for northbound to eastbound traffic movements. Construction of the $101.5million project began in late 2010, and the interchange was officially opened to traffic on 9 June 2012.|$|E
5|$|The North Circular Road has a {{wide variety}} of styles and {{standards}} of junctions connecting to other roads. These range from the complex, grade-separated design at Charlie Brown's near Woodford, to at-grade junctions with traffic lights. The original road contained entirely at-grade junctions; many of these were improved and <b>grade</b> <b>separated</b> during the late 1970s and early 1980s.|$|E

40|$|In {{the case}} of finite groups, a {{separating}} algebra is a subalgebra of the ring of invariants which separates the orbits. Although separating algebras are often better behaved than the ring of invariants, we show {{that many of the}} criteria which imply that the ring of invariants is non Cohen-Macaulay actually imply that no <b>graded</b> <b>separating</b> algebra is Cohen-Macaulay. For example, we show that, over a field of positive characteristic p, given sufficiently many copies of a faithful modular representation, no <b>graded</b> <b>separating</b> algebra is Cohen-Macaulay. Furthermore, we show that, for a p-group, the existence of a Cohen-Macaulay <b>graded</b> <b>separating</b> algebra implies the group is generated by bireflections. Furthermore, we show that, for a $p$-group, the existence of a Cohen-Macaulay <b>graded</b> <b>separating</b> algebra implies the group is generated by bireflections. Additionally, we give an example which shows that Cohen-Macaulay separating algebras can occur when the ring of invariants is not Cohen-Macaulay. Comment: We removed the conjecture which appeared in previous versions: we give a counter-example. We fixed the proof of Lemma 2. 2 (previously Remark 2. 2). 16 page...|$|R

5|$|The {{motorway}} {{consists of}} two traffic lanes and an emergency lane in each driving direction separated by a central reservation. All intersections of the A5 motorway are <b>grade</b> <b>separated.</b> There are four exits and four rest areas operating along the route. The motorway is tolled using a ticket system, integrated with the A3, and each exit includes a toll plaza.|$|E
5|$|The {{first stage}} of {{construction}} is being undertaken {{as part of the}} NorthLink WA project. Tonkin Highway's northern section will be <b>grade</b> <b>separated,</b> and a dual carriageway will be constructed from the Northern end of Tonkin Highway near Reid Highway, past Ellenbrook and through the Swan Valley to an interchange with Great Northern Highway and a new part of Brand Highway, with the extension continuing on as Great Northern Highway. The previously planned route of the bypass, prior to 2012, followed Lord Street, east of Whiteman Park. The project is funded by both the state and federal governments. Construction began in June 2017, and is scheduled to finish mid 2019.|$|E
5|$|The {{motorway}} {{consists of}} two traffic lanes and an emergency lane in each driving direction, separated by a central reservation, except at the two bridges. All intersections of the A9 motorway are <b>grade</b> <b>separated,</b> and as of September 2011, there are 10exits and 6rest areas along the route. Since the motorway is tolled, using a ticket system, each exit includes a toll plaza; and the A9 motorway and the A8 motorway have an integrated toll system in place.|$|E
50|$|In 1905, Seven Mile {{contained}} a hotel, a harness shop, a tin shop, meat store, and a mill. The village was spared during the Great Dayton Flood {{due to the}} elevated railroad <b>grade</b> <b>separating</b> it from Sevenmile Creek.|$|R
2500|$|The Portal Grade was an [...] "Invisible" [...] or {{in-between}} <b>grade</b> <b>separating</b> the First Order {{from the}} Second Order. The Circle of existing Adepts from the Second Order had to consent to allow an Aspirant to be initiated as an Adept {{and join the}} Second Order.|$|R
50|$|Geometrically, {{there are}} four <b>grades</b> <b>separated</b> {{interchanges}} and one at grade interchange along BKE. Moreover, there are nine reinforced concrete bridges (three of those are river bridges, i.e., Sungai Mengkuang, Sungai Kulim and Sungai Karangan, whereas the rest are bridges over local roads or railway track).|$|R
5|$|All intersections found {{along the}} route are <b>grade</b> <b>separated,</b> except for a single {{at-grade}} intersection currently regulated by traffic lights; a new route is planned to bypass this intersection. As of June 2012, there were tenexits and twoservice areas {{along the route}}. The motorway is currently toll-free except for the Učka Tunnel and the Kanfanar-Rogovići section. However, most of the motorway is potentially a toll road using a ticket system, with each exit including a toll plaza except those of Veprinac, Opatija, and Matulji. The toll system of the A8/A9 Istrian Y is integrated: no ticket needs to be turned in, gotten, or exchanged when going from the A8 to the A9 or vice versa.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} project, Tonkin Highway was {{expanded}} from two to three lanes in both directions, between Great Eastern Highway and Roe Highway, with the existing intersections in this section becoming <b>grade</b> <b>separated.</b> A new diamond interchange was constructed with Dunreath Drive {{to provide access to}} the domestic terminal precinct, replacing Brearley Avenue as the main access to the precinct. International terminal access was provided via a new freeway-to-freeway cloverstack interchange at Leach Highway, and a single-point urban interchange at the intersection with Horrie Miller Drive and Kewdale Road. The existing diamond interchange with Roe Highway was upgraded to a partial freeway-to-freeway interchange, but with plans to further upgrade it to a completely free-flowing interchange in the future.|$|E
5|$|As {{the route}} {{traverses}} hilly terrain, {{it requires a}} substantial number of viaducts and tunnels, as well as two major bridges to span the Drava and Mura rivers. The motorway consists of two traffic lanes and an emergency lane in each driving direction separated by a central reservation. There are no emergency lanes in the tunnels. All intersections of the A4 motorway are <b>grade</b> <b>separated.</b> As of October 2010, there are 12exits and 3rest areas operating along the route. As the motorway is tolled using a ticket system, each exit includes a toll plaza. Exits south of the Sveta Helena mainline toll plaza have no toll plazas, as that part of the A4 route is not tolled. The same applies to the northernmost section between the Goričan exit and the Hungarian border.|$|E

5|$|The South Circular Road starts {{just south}} of the ferry {{terminal}} where the A2204 Ferry Approach meets the main east-west road through Woolwich, the A206. It heads south, climbing up John Wilson Street, a section of dual carriageway, until it meets Grand Depot Road and becomes single carriageway through Woolwich Common and Academy Road past the former Royal Military Academy. The route continues south to the A2 at a <b>grade</b> <b>separated</b> junctionone of only two on the routeand continues southwesterly as a dual carriageway, crossing Eltham Road (A210) and Sidcup Road (A20). At the junction with Burnt Ash Hill the road becomes urban single carriageway again, which it remains the case for most of the remainder of the route.|$|E
5|$|In 1967 the Ministry of Transport invited {{construction}} company Freeman Fox, Wilbur Smith Associates (FFWSA) {{to investigate and}} report {{on the impact of}} the New Town proposals on traffic demand between the proposed New Town site and Wolverhampton, and the best highway solution to meet this demand. The predicted demand was that of 75,000 vehicles per day by 1990 and a need for a dual 3-lane motorway. Two corridors were identified for a possible new motorway route, and a third option to possibly upgrade existing roads. The route could have followed the A5 Corridor to the M6 South of Gailey, at junction 12, or a new corridor could have been established to the M6, north-east of Featherstone, at junction 11. Additionally, it was proposed that the existing A5 could be upgraded to full dual carriageway <b>grade</b> <b>separated</b> standards together with improvements to the A41 and A464 trunk routes.|$|E
5|$|The {{motorway}} {{consists of}} two traffic lanes and an emergency lane in each driving direction separated by a central reservation. Sections of the motorway that have a gradient greater than 4% are divided into three lanes to prevent traffic problems caused by slower vehicles. These sections have no emergency lanes. Similarly, there are no emergency lanes in the tunnels. All intersections of the A6 motorway are <b>grade</b> <b>separated.</b> As the route traverses rugged mountains it requires numerous long bridges, viaducts, tunnels, and other structures. As of 2010 there are nine exits and three rest areas situated along the route. The majority of the motorway is a ticket system toll road with pricing tied to vehicle classification. Each exit between Grobnik mainline toll plaza and Bosiljevo2 interchage has a toll plaza. No toll is charged at Bosiljevo2 where the traffic switches to the A1 motorway; traffic is tolled upon leaving the A1 motorway. Exits between the mainline toll plaza and Orehovica interchange have no toll plazas, as {{that part of the}} A6 route is not tolled.|$|E
50|$|Lawrence Expressway {{also has}} another <b>separated</b> <b>grade</b> {{interchange}} with El Camino Real (SR 82) with Lawrence Expressway passing over El Camino Real {{just prior to}} Lawrence Expressway entering Sunnyvale. Lawrence Expressway also passes under Central Expressway (G6) on a <b>separated</b> <b>grade</b> interchange and over US 101 on a <b>separated</b> <b>grade</b> interchange. The US 101 interchange was upgraded in the early 2000s to include traffic light control on G2.|$|R
50|$|Named {{after the}} Bulgarian poet and revolutionary Hristo Botev, {{the school is}} among the oldest ones in the town and province. It has 8 <b>grades,</b> <b>separated</b> in two {{educational}} levels. The first 3 grades are in the Primary level for children 7/8/9 years old. The next 5 grades are in the Secondary level for children aged 10-14. After graduating the school, pupils may continue their education at some High school or Vocational school.|$|R

5|$|The {{motorway}} {{consists of}} two traffic lanes and an emergency lane in each driving direction, separated by a central reservation. All intersections of the A3 motorway are <b>grade</b> <b>separated,</b> and the motorway comprises several large stack and cloverleaf interchanges at junctions with four other motorways in Croatia: A1, A2, A4 and A5. As of October 2010, another cloverleaf interchange is under construction on the A3 route, where the A11 motorway is scheduled to branch off. The route comprises {{a large number of}} bridges and culverts, but has no tunnels because it runs through plains. The Sava River Bridge is the most significant structure on the A3. Currently, there are 21exits and 18rest areas operating along the route. A large part of the motorway is tolled using a ticket system; one section uses an open toll collection system. The Zagreb bypass sections are not tolled. The toll is charged according to vehicle classification in Croatia. The A3 motorway is operated by Hrvatske autoceste.|$|E
5|$|The two {{tubes of}} the 53rd Street Tunnel under the East River began {{construction}} in spring 1927, and were fully excavated between Queens and Manhattan in January 1929, with a ventilation shaft built on Welfare Island (today's Roosevelt Island). On October 4, 1928, the Board of Estimate approved {{the construction of}} the Queens Boulevard Line. During the line's construction, several intersections of Queens Boulevard with major roads were <b>grade</b> <b>separated,</b> in a similar manner to Grand Concourse in the Bronx during the building of the IND Concourse Line around that same time. At adjacent intersections with Woodhaven Boulevard and Horace Harding Boulevard (now the Long Island Expressway) in Elmhurst, Queens Boulevard's main road was depressed into underpasses. In Kew Gardens, Union Turnpike and the Interboro Parkway (now the Jackie Robinson Parkway) were depressed below Queens Boulevard {{at the level of the}} Union Turnpike station's mezzanine. The subway from Long Island City to Roosevelt Avenue and 74th Street was completed by April 1932.|$|E
5|$|In general appearance, {{the current}} {{operating}} line of SIR looks somewhat like an outdoor {{line of the}} New York City Subway. Since the 1960s, it has been <b>grade</b> <b>separated</b> from all roads, but it runs more or less at street level for a brief stretch north of Clifton, between the Grasmere and Old Town stations, and from south of the Pleasant Plains station to Tottenville, {{the end of the}} line. It uses NYC Transit-standard 600 V DC third rail power. Its equipment are R44 subway type cars that are specially modified with headlight dimmers, electric windshield defrosters, FRA Compliant cab signals and horns, and FRA regulation 223 required shatterproof glazing, and exterior mounted grab rails near the side doors. The cars were built in early 1973, {{at the tail end of}} the R44 order of subway cars for New York City Transit (the Staten Island R44s being the last cars built by the St. Louis Car Company). Heavy maintenance of the equipment is performed at NYCT's Clifton Shops. Any work that cannot be performed at Clifton requires the cars to be trucked over the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge to the subway's Coney Island Complex shops in Brooklyn. The right-of-way also includes elevated, embankment and open-cut portions, and a tunnel near St. George.|$|E
30|$|In {{order to}} control for {{variables}} that may confound the effect of FABP 7 on 21 -day mortality, logistic regression analysis was performed [21]. Aside from FABP 7, covariates considered in multivariable modeling included MELD, lactate, vasopressors use, RRT, MV and high coma <b>grade.</b> <b>Separate</b> multivariable (logistic) regression models were derived for FABP 7 early (day 1) and late (days 3 – 5) by including variables, which were significant on univariate analysis and performing backward elimination with a p value threshold of 0.05.|$|R
2500|$|Some {{projects}} that {{were removed from}} the modernisation {{as a result of the}} de-scoping such as a Flyover at Norton Bridge station were later restarted. A £250 million project to <b>grade</b> <b>separate</b> the tracks at Norton Bridge that would allow for increased service frequency as well as improved line-speeds was completed in Spring 2016. Other projects such as the replacement of a weak bridge in Watford will allow line-speeds to be increased from [...] to [...] in the coming years to decrease journey times.|$|R
5|$|After {{reviewing}} {{traffic conditions}} in 1961, the Ministry of Transport planned {{to improve the}} North Circular Road to a higher capacity, <b>grade</b> <b>separating</b> as many junctions as possible, particularly those at important arterial routes. In the 1960s the Greater London Council developed the London Ringways Plan to construct a series of circular and radial motorways throughout London with the hope to ease traffic congestion in the central area. Under this plan the North Circular Road was to be improved to dual-carriageway standard throughout {{the majority of its}} length by the late 1970s.|$|R
5|$|The highway {{was created}} in the 1930s from an {{existing}} system of roads linking Perth with the Goldfields. Though the name Great Eastern Highway was coined to describe the route from Perth to Guildford on the northern side of the Swan River (modern-day Guildford Road), it was actually used for the road through Belmont, south of the river. This section was constructed in 1867 using convict labour, with the road base made from sections of tree trunks. Over the years the road has been upgraded, with the whole highway sealed by 1953, segments reconstructed and widened, dual carriageways created in Perth and Kalgoorlie, and <b>grade</b> <b>separated</b> interchanges built at major intersections. Great Eastern Highway Bypass in Perth's eastern suburbs opened in 1988, allowing through traffic to avoid the Guildford and Midland townsites, and in 2002 a new bypass diverted the highway around Northam. A future route to replace Great Eastern Highway's current ascent of the Darling Scarp has been identified. The planned route is a controlled-access highway along Toodyay Road to Gidgegannup, and then across to Wundowie via a new alignment. Though planning began in the 1970s, , construction of this route has not been scheduled, and it is not considered a priority.|$|E
25|$|The {{junction}} with US-89 at {{the north}} end of SR-51 is a <b>grade</b> <b>separated</b> interchange constructed in 1959 (as the split of US-89 and US-91), making this one of the oldest <b>grade</b> <b>separated</b> interchanges in Utah still in use. Although portions of Interstate 15 were constructed in 1955, the Beck Street interchange (I-15/US-89) is the only original structure from 1955 still in use.|$|E
25|$|<b>Grade</b> <b>separated</b> {{light rail}} systems can move 15,000 {{passengers}} per hour {{on a fixed}} route, but these are usually fully <b>grade</b> <b>separated</b> systems. Street level systems typically move up to 7,500 passengers per hour. Heavy rail subways can move 50,000 passengers per hour. As with PRT, these estimates depend on having enough trains. Neither light nor heavy rail scales well for off-peak operation.|$|E
