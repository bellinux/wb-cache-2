40|$|Abstract. The Basel Accords {{represent}} landmark financial agreements for {{the regulation}} of commercial banks. The main purpose of the accords was to strengthen the soundness and stability of the international banking system by providing a minimum standard for capital requirements. In 2004, the Basel Committee proposed new guidelines, which have become known as Basel II. We give a short overview of the Basel II framework and present the different approaches {{which can be used}} to determine the amount of regulatory capital needed for <b>equity</b> <b>exposures.</b> These methods vary from simple, rather rule of thumb methods, to more sophisticated and economic-oriented approaches. We compare the regulatory capital consumption of two equity portfolios using the different Basel II-compliant methods. We provide evidence that, as far as regulatory capital consumption for <b>equity</b> <b>exposures</b> is concerned, there is no real incentive for banks to use the more sophisticated and economic-oriented models such as VaR or EVT models...|$|E

40|$|By buying {{convertibles}} and shorting {{the underlying}} stock, hedge funds distribute <b>equity</b> <b>exposure</b> to well-diversified shareholders.

40|$|Convertible {{arbitrage}} {{hedge funds}} combine long positions in convertible securities with short {{positions in the}} underlying stock. In effect, hedge funds use {{their knowledge of the}} borrowing and short-sale market to hedge themselves while distributing <b>equity</b> <b>exposure</b> to a large number of well-diversified investors through their short positions. The authors argue that many “would-be” equity issuers that would otherwise pay high costs in a secondary equity issue choose instead to issue convertible debt to hedge funds that in turn distribute <b>equity</b> <b>exposure</b> to institutional investors. This allows companies to receive “equity-like” financing today at lower cost than a secondary equity offering. The authors' findings also suggest that more convertibles will be privately placed with hedge funds when issuer and market conditions suggest that shorting costs will be lower. </p...|$|R
40|$|A {{single factor}} that captures assets’ {{exposure}} to business-cycle variation in macroeconomic uncertainty {{can explain the}} level and cross-sectional differences of asset returns. Specifically, based on portfolio-level tests I demonstrate that fluctuations in uncertainty with persistence ranging from 32 to 128 months carry a negative price of risk of about − 2 % annually. The price of risk for fluctuations with persistence outside of this range and for the raw series of aggregate uncertainty is insignificant. Also, <b>equity</b> <b>exposures</b> are negative and hence the corresponding risk premia are positive. I quantify macroeconomic uncertainty using the model-free index of Jurado et al. (2015) derived from monthly, quarterly and annual forecasts...|$|E

40|$|American {{multinational}} firms {{respond to}} politically risky environments by adjusting their capital structures abroad and at home. Foreign subsidiaries located in politically risky countries have significantly more debt than do other foreign affiliates {{of the same}} parent companies. American firms further limit their <b>equity</b> <b>exposures</b> in politically risky countries by sharing ownership with local partners and by serving foreign markets with exports rather than local production. The residual political risk borne by parent companies leads them to use less domestic leverage, resulting in lower firm-wide leverage. Multinational firms with above-average exposures to politically risky countries have 8. 4 percent less domestic leverage than do other firms. These findings illustrate the impact of risk exposures on capital structure. ...|$|E
40|$|This article {{compares the}} {{performance}} of bivariate error correction GARCH and FIGARCH models when estimating long term dynamic minimum variance hedge ratios (MVHRs) on the Australian All Ordinaries Index. The paper therefore introduces the bivariate error correction FIGARCH model into the hedging literature, which to date has only employed the GARCH class of processes. This is important {{for those interested in}} managing long term <b>equity</b> <b>exposures,</b> given that FIGARCH processes exhibit long memory, whilst the GARCH class of processes exhibit short memory. The naïve hedge ratio, the constant MVHR estimated via ordinary least squares (the OLS MVHR), the single period dynamic MVHR and the multi-period dynamic MVHR of Lee (1999) are considered. The results strongly support the estimation of dynamic MVHRs that allow for time varying correlations. Whilst long memory dependencies appear important, a multi-period dynamic MVHR that responds more rapidly to persistent changes in volatility dynamics requires development. Long memory, bivariate FIGARCH, time varying correlations, multi period minimum variance hedge ratios. ...|$|E
40|$|Under the Basel II banking {{regulatory}} capital regime the capital requirements for credit exposures are calculated using the Asymptotic Single Risk Factor (ASRF) approach. The capital requirement {{is taken to}} be the contribution of an exposure to the unexpected loss on the bank's diversified portfolio. Here we extend this approach to calculate capital requirements for equity investments. We show {{that in the case}} when asset values have a normal distribution an analytical formula for the unexpected loss contribution may be developed. We show that the capital requirements for equity investments are quite different to those of credit exposures, since equity investments can suffer substantial loss of value even when the underlying company has not defaulted. Unexpected loss is commonly used as a measure of capital requirements, but it ignores the ability of earnings to absorb loss. We propose a definition of capital requirement that recognises the expected earnings on assets, and show how to combine the ASRF model and the Capital Asset Pricing Model to compute this quantity for credit and <b>equity</b> <b>exposures.</b> Capital allocation Economic capital Equity Basel II ASRF Factor model CAPM...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} participants' age distribution on the asset allocation of Dutch pension funds, using a unique data set of pension fund investment plans for 2007. Theory predicts a negative effect of age on (strategic) <b>equity</b> <b>exposures.</b> We observe that pension funds do indeed take {{the average age of}} their participants into account. However, the average age of active participants has been incorporated much more strongly in investment behaviour than the average ages of retired or dormant participants. This suggests that both employers and employees, who dominate pension fund boards, tend to show more interest in active participants. A one-year higher average age in active participants leads to a significant and robust reduction in the strategic equity exposure by around 0. 5 percentage point. Larger pension funds show a stronger age-equity exposure effect than smaller pension funds. This age-dependent asset allocation of pension funds aligns with the original life-cycle model by which young workers should invest more in equity than older workers because of their larger human capital. Other factors, viz. fund size, funding ratio, and average pension wealth of participants, influence equity exposure positively and significantly, in line with theory. Pension plan type and pension fund type have no significant impact. Pension funds; strategic equity allocation; lifecycle saving and investing. ...|$|E

40|$|We analyze annuity {{demand in}} a {{realistic}} life-cycle {{model in which}} we optimize over consumption and asset allocation. We incorporate background risk and incomplete annuity menus as possible drivers of devia-tions from full annuitization. Retirees face longevity risk, capital market risk, inflation risk, and background risk. We model annuitization as a one-time decision at retirement. Contrary to what is often suggested in the literature, we find that in these settings full annuitization remains close to optimal, irrespective of whether real or only nominal annuities are available. Under all circumstances we find optimal annuitization levels above 95 % of initial wealth. On the one hand annuitization is attractive due to the additional wealth created by the mortality credit, {{on the other hand}} annuities are irreversible and the annuity menu is incomplete. We show that the additional wealth effect dominates, optimally individuals annuitize almost their entire wealth at retirement to capture the mortality credit. Whenever liquidity or <b>equity</b> <b>exposure</b> is desired, individuals save sizeable amounts out of their annuity income to smooth shocks due to background or inflation risk and/or to get <b>equity</b> <b>exposure.</b> We can identify this result, because we do not assume a priori that consump-tion equals annuity income in retirement and solve a dynamic programming problem for consumption and savings. Similarly, adding variable annuities to the menu does not increase welfare significantly, since indi...|$|R
