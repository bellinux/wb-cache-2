2500|$|The {{evolutionary}} relationships [...] of the scops and screech owls are {{not entirely}} clear. What is certain {{is that they are}} very closely related; they may be considered sister lineages which fill essentially the same ecological niche in their allopatric ranges. A screech owl fossil from the Late Pliocene of Kansas (which is almost identical to eastern and western screech owls) indicates a longstanding presence of these birds in the Americas, while coeval scops owl fossils very similar to the <b>Eurasian</b> <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> have been found at S'Onix on Majorca. The scops and screech owl lineage probably evolved at some time during the Miocene (like most other genera of typical owls), and the three (see below) modern lineages separated perhaps roughly 5 million years ago. Note that there is no reliable estimate of divergence time, as Otus and Megascops are osteologically very similar, as is to be expected from a group that has apparently conserved its ecomorphology since before its evolutionary radiation. Like almost all scops and screech owls today, their common ancestor was in all probability already a small owl, with ear tufts and at least the upper tarsus ("leg") feathered.|$|E

50|$|The Mayotte <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> {{has been}} {{considered}} to be conspecific with the Pemba <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> Otus pembaensis, the Anjouan <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> Otus capnodes rainforest <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> and the Torotoroka <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> Otus madagacarensis under O. rutilus but this species has now been split and the Mayotte <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> is now regarded as its own species, mainly based on its very different call. The <b>scops</b> <b>owls</b> of Madagascar, Comoros and Seychelles form a clade within the genus Otus with the Oriental <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> Otus sunia and are not {{closely related to the}} continental African <b>scops</b> <b>owls.</b>|$|R
50|$|The African <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> was {{formerly}} {{regarded as the}} African subspecies of the <b>scops</b> <b>owl.</b> It was grouped with the Arabian <b>scops</b> <b>owl,</b> Socotra <b>scops</b> <b>owl,</b> and the Annobon <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> into Otus senegalensis; however these species are now considered to be separate.|$|R
50|$|The {{rainforest}} <b>scops</b> <b>owl,</b> the Mayotte <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> Otus mayottensis, the Pemba <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> Otus pembaensis and the torotoroka <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> Otus madagascarensis {{have all}} previously been lumped as one species. The taxonomy is {{in state of}} flux but recent genetic studies have placed the Pemba <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> closer to the clade containing the African <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> Otus sengalensis, while the Mayotte <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> is clearly separate from the remaining two. The status of the rainforest and torotoroka <b>scops</b> <b>owls</b> as separate species is debatable as there may be very little genetic distance between the two taxa.|$|R
50|$|The Cyprus {{scops owl}} (Otus cyprius) is an owl endemic to Cyprus. Some taxonomists {{consider}} {{it to be}} a subspecies of the <b>Eurasian</b> <b>scops</b> <b>owl.</b>|$|E
50|$|The migrant <b>Eurasian</b> <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> is {{very similar}} to the African scops owl; though it averages {{slightly}} larger, it may not be distinguishable in the field.|$|E
50|$|The pallid {{scops owl}} is a small eared owl similar in {{appearance}} to the <b>Eurasian</b> <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> but with more distinct streaks {{on the back and}} less intricate markings.|$|E
50|$|The Karthala <b>scops</b> <b>owl,</b> {{also known}} as Grand Comoro <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> or Comoro <b>scops</b> <b>owl,</b> (Otus pauliani) is a small, <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> endemic to the island of Grande Comore in the Comoro Islands.|$|R
50|$|The Torotoroka <b>scops</b> <b>owl,</b> the Mayotte <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> Otus mayottensis, the Pemba <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> Otus pembaensis and the {{rainforest}} <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> Otus rutilus have all previously been lumped as one species. The taxonomy is {{in state of}} flux but recent genetic studies have placed the Pemba <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> closer to the clade containing the African <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> Otus sengalensis, while the Mayotte <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> is clearly separate from the remaining two. The status of {{the rainforest}} and Torotoroka <b>scops</b> <b>owls</b> as separate species is debatable as there may be very little genetic distance between the two taxa and subsequent {{studies have suggested that}} the plumage differences between rutilus and madgascarensis are small and that their voices intergrade. If that is the case then the rainforest and Torotoroka <b>scops</b> <b>owls</b> become subspecies of the Madagascar <b>scops</b> <b>owl.</b>|$|R
50|$|The pallid <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> (Otus brucei) {{is a small}} <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> {{ranging from}} the Middle East to West and Central Asia, {{sometimes}} called the striated <b>scops</b> <b>owl.</b>|$|R
50|$|The owl {{was similar}} {{in size to}} the <b>Eurasian</b> <b>scops</b> <b>owl,</b> though the leg bones were longer. Estimates of its body weight and wing loading suggest that it was largely ground-dwelling.|$|E
50|$|Various {{subspecies}} {{have been}} described, including the nominate from the Mantanani Islands, and O. m. sibutuensis (Sharpe, 1893) from the Sulu islands. It {{has sometimes been}} {{considered to be a}} race of the <b>Eurasian</b> <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> or the oriental scops owl.|$|E
50|$|Avifauna {{include the}} lesser spotted {{woodpecker}} (Dendrocopos minor), tree pipit (Anthus trivalis), <b>Eurasian</b> <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> (Otus scops), European greenfinch (Carduelis chloris), southern fiscal (Lanius collaris), Eurasian hobby (Falca subbuteo), blue tit (Parus caeruleus), common raven (Corvus corax), yellowhammer (Emberiza citrinella) and middle spotted woodpecker (Dendrocopos medius).|$|E
50|$|The Philippine <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> (Otus megalotis) is {{a common}} owl, endemic to the Philippines, {{belonging}} {{to the family of}} the typical <b>owls</b> Strigidae. Everett's <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> and Negros <b>scops</b> <b>owls</b> were formerly considered conspecific.|$|R
50|$|The Karthala <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> was {{formerly}} {{considered to be}} a subspecies of the Madagascar <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> Otus rutilus, but with the other Comoro Islands <b>scops</b> <b>owls</b> it is now regarded as a separate species.|$|R
50|$|The sandy <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> {{is thought}} to be basal in the lineage of the genus Otus, along with the Sokoke <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> Otus ireneae, but there has been no genetic {{material}} for testing from the sandy <b>scops</b> <b>owl.</b> In addition some authorities consider that the subspecies of sandy <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> should be teated as two different species.|$|R
50|$|The {{economy is}} {{essentially}} rural, based on agriculture and animal husbandry. Flora goes from the Mediterranean shrubland {{of the coast}} to olive and fruit trees in the mainland, up to pine and oaks in the more elevated parts. Wildlife include wild boar, fox, Sardinian hare, European hedgehog, least weasel, marten, the rare Sardinian wildcat, vulture, carrion crow, peregrine falcon, hoopoe, little owl, <b>Eurasian</b> <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> and others.|$|E
5000|$|There is an islet called Gavdopoula (Γαυδοπούλα, [...] "little Gavdos") to {{the north}} west of Gavdos. Gavdos and Gavdopoula are covered with {{phrygana}} (φρύγανα), low-lying shrubs. Both are important stops for migrating birds. [...] Local birds include the <b>Eurasian</b> <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> and the European shag. Gavdos also {{has a variety of}} other vegetation, such as maquis as well as forests of pines and junipers.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Eurasian</b> <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> (Otus scops), {{also known}} as the European scops owl or just scops owl, is a small owl. This species {{is a part of the}} larger {{grouping}} of owls known as typical owls, Strigidae, which contains most species of owl. The other grouping is the barn owls, Tytonidae. The scientific name is from the Latin otus for an eared owl and Ancient Greek skopos, [...] "watcher".|$|E
50|$|The Seychelles <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> (Otus insularis), {{also known}} as bare-legged <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> or syer (in Creole) is a rare <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> species, which only occurs in the Morne Seychellois National Park on the Seychelles island of Mahé.|$|R
50|$|The {{rainforest}} <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> (Otus rutilus), {{also known}} as the Malagasy <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> or Madagascar <b>scops</b> <b>owl,</b> is a species of owl in the family Strigidae. It is found in a large part of eastern Madagascar, but the exact distribution limits between it and the Torotoroka <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> (O. madagascariensis), with which it was long considered conspecific, require further study.|$|R
50|$|The Socotra <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> was {{previously}} lumped with the African <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> Otus senegalensis but differences in plumage and vocalisations {{have led to}} it being split. Recent genetic research suggests that its closest relatives are the Oriental <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> and the Seychelles <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> Otus insularis. An interesting theory this research has led to is that the oriental <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> is a taxon which evolved from a colonisation of a continent from island ancestors, an event which had previously been thought unlikely because island taxa {{were thought to be}} less competitive than related continental taxa.|$|R
50|$|The African {{scops owl}} is {{strictly}} nocturnal. During the day, it perches {{close to the}} trunk of a tree. When roosting in daylight, this species closes its eyes and extends its ear tufts to give the impression of a tree branch, making it easily overlooked. Pairs sometimes roost together. The African scops owl is not as territorial as the <b>Eurasian</b> <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> and will nest in loose aggregations, with the nest sites relatively close to each other.|$|E
50|$|Compared {{with the}} <b>Eurasian</b> <b>scops</b> <b>owl,</b> the wings were smaller (two thirds {{the size of}} those of the Eurasian species), the legs longer (by 11.6%), and the pelvis both broader and shorter. It was also {{generally}} smaller than the Madeira Scops Owl. The proportions of its limbs and wing loading indicate that it lived mainly {{on the ground and}} had only weak powers of flight. The distinctive anatomical features shown by this species has led the scientists to conclude that it was an insectivore which probably lived on the forest floor of the laurisilva, where it would have hunted and sheltered.|$|E
50|$|The Parco dell'Oglio Sud {{is another}} {{regional}} park that {{lies on the}} boundary of the province with the province of Cremona. It was established in 1988 and has an area of about 12,800 hectares. It is a river park that runs along the stretch of the river Oglio which forms the boundary. It lies {{to the south of}} Lake Iseo and the administrative centre is at Calvatone. Birds present in this park include great egret, grey heron, Montagu's harrier, <b>Eurasian</b> <b>scops</b> <b>owl,</b> bearded reedling, woodcock, barred warbler, crested lark, sedge warbler, moustached warbler, little egret, Eurasian hobby and ferruginous duck.|$|E
50|$|The oriental <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> (Otus sunia) is {{a species}} of <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> found in eastern and {{southern}} Asia.|$|R
50|$|The Pemba <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> was {{formerly}} {{regarded as a}} subspecies of the Madagascar <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> Otus rutilus sensu lato due to morphological similarities but genetic {{research has shown that}} it is closer to the clade in which the African <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> Otus senegalensis is situated.|$|R
50|$|The sandy <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> (Otus icterorhynchus), or {{cinnamon}} <b>scops</b> <b>owl,</b> is an owl {{form the}} familay Strigidae found in Africa.|$|R
5000|$|The {{landscape}} includes woodlands, alpine meadows, glaciers and lakes, including Big Almaty Lake. Remarkable trees include apricot, maple, and apple. A {{total of}} 300 {{species of birds}} and animals have been recorded from the Ile-Alatau National Park. [...] The park is home to snow leopards, Central Asian lynx, Tian Shan brown bears, Central Asian stone martens, Siberian ibexes, bearded vultures and golden eagles. Other notable bird species found in Ile-Alatau National Park include Himalayan snowcock, ibisbill, <b>Eurasian</b> <b>scops</b> <b>owl,</b> and Eurasian three-toed woodpecker. The park also protects specific species of deer whose antlers {{are believed to have}} medicinal properties.|$|E
50|$|Dubník is a {{national}} nature reserve in the Slovak municipalities of Dvorníky, Pusté Sady, Vinohrady nad Váhom in the Hlohovec District and Galanta District. The nature reserve covers an area of 165 ha in the Váh river valley. It has a protection level of 4 under the Slovak nature protection system. The protected area is an important bird locality especially for <b>Eurasian</b> <b>scops</b> <b>owl.</b> It is a rare remainder of natural forest with protected species in a deforested landscape. The geological substrate is loess and the soil type is black earth. On {{the edge of the}} protected landscape is a stand of old oaks which forms an important bird nesting place.|$|E

50|$|The Torotoroka <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> (Otus madagascariensis) is a taxon of owl in {{the family}} Strigidae. It is endemic to Madagascar, and was {{previously}} regarded as its own species. However, O. madagascariensis and the rainforest <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> Otus. rutilus have now been re-lumped following Fuchs et al. (2007) as the Madagascar <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> or Malagasy <b>scops</b> <b>owl.</b> The scientific name of the combined species {{is yet to be}} agreed, although rutilus would appear to be have priority.|$|R
5000|$|The Sula <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> (Otus manadensis sulaensis), {{is a small}} owl in the scops-owl genus Otus {{found on}} the Sula Islands. Taxonomically, some groups {{consider}} {{it to be a}} distinct species (Otus sulensis), others a subspecies of the Sulawesi <b>scops</b> <b>owl,</b> and yet others a subspecies of the Moluccan <b>scops</b> <b>owl.</b>|$|R
