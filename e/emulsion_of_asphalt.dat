This paper focuses on determining the minimum curing time needed for Malaysian asphalt emulsions. Three factors, including curing conditions (indoor, outdoor, and curing at night), asphalt emulsion types (RS- 1 k, RS- 2 k, RS- 2 kL, RS- 3 k, Ralumac, and SRSB) and application rates (high, medium, and low), were investigated. The curing time was determined by weighing a specimen repeatedly {{at a certain time}} interval until a constant weight was achieved. Statistical analysis of analysis of variance (ANOVA) was also performed to study if there are differences between groups of variables. From the results, it was found that curing conditions incorporating weather characteristics (i. e., wind speed, temperature, relative humidity, and solar radiation) are the most significant factor affecting the curing time <b>of</b> a particular <b>asphalt</b> <b>emulsion.</b> Curing <b>of</b> <b>asphalt</b> <b>emulsions</b> for construction at night proved to be unworkable due to the absence of solar radiation with relatively low temperature and high relative humidity.

Cold recycling technologies utilizing emulsion as binder demonstrates a number of high environmental advantages and thus it is widely applied worldwide. There are many factors influencing the performance <b>of</b> <b>emulsion</b> recycled <b>asphalt</b> mixture, such as components, curing, aging etc. This study investigates the influence of proportion of virgin aggregate and curing time {{on the performance of}} recycled mixture. The mixture formulation design at three levels of virgin aggregate addition (0 %, 10 % and 20 %) and one dosage of cement (1. 5 %) has been conducted. The performance <b>of</b> <b>emulsion</b> recycled <b>asphalt</b> mixture including splitting failure load, splitting failure strength and Freeze-thaw splitting strength has been measured at four curing times (0 day, 7 days, 14 days and 28 days). The effect of proportion of virgin aggregate and curing time on the performance of recycled mixture has been quantified accordingly. The research has manifested that the increment of the proportion of virgin aggregate and the curing time will enhance the performance <b>of</b> the emulsified <b>asphalt</b> cold recycled mixture up to 26 %.

Combined with the traditional evaluation indictor for foamed asphalt, the relationship between the foaming property and surface energy <b>of</b> <b>asphalt</b> binder was analyzed. According to the surface energy components, the wettability <b>of</b> <b>asphalt</b> binder to aggregate was calculated to verify the performance <b>of</b> foamed <b>asphalt</b> mixture.
