The contents of the investigated metals were analysed in aqua regia extracts of samples collected from three profiles of Brunic Arenosols, formed from river sands, and three profiles of Gleyic Podzols, formed from river <b>sands</b> trans-formed by <b>eolian</b> processes.

40|$|International audienceCompiling of {{bibliographic data}} has been {{completed}} with unpublished data and personal field research. They tend towards the evidence that Upper Pleistocene climatic fluctuations in Lower Sahara are contemporary with the temperate Europe ones and having the same characteristics. For example, during Eemian interglacial, lacustrine phases occured in the Grands Chotts tunisiens at 150 - 140, 000 years B. P. and at 90 - 85, 000 years B. P. (230 Th/ 243 U). At the same times, Douira then/or Rejiche marine transgressions occured in the Gabès gulf. Acheulean might disappeared during this phase. The second part of Upper Pleistocene began with a probably very arid phase, more arid than {{at the present time}} (from 80, 000 years B. P. to about 35, 000 years B. P.). During this phase, the first generation of <b>eolian</b> <b>sands</b> deposits in Gafsa region and Matmata plateau was accumulating, blown by North winds. At the same time, the second Great Eastern Erg <b>eolian</b> <b>sands</b> generation accumulated too. The lack of precise datings on classical Mousterian sites as El-Guettar and oued el Akarit preclude all interpretation of associated faula and floral fossil remains. From about 35, 000 years B. P. to about 23, 000 years B. P., climate became wetter. It allowed the genesis of glacis 2, the accumulation of terrace 2 and the development of pedogenesis in the previous eolian deposits (in Gafsa region, Great Eastern Erg, Ziban range and Matmata plateau). A marine transgression took place at this moment. Pleniglacial (22 - 14, 000 years B. P.) is very arid, more arid than at the present time. Again, deflation dug into The Grands Chotts tunisiens. Then <b>eolian</b> <b>sands</b> accumulated (Gafsa and Bir Oum Ali region, Matmata plateau, El-Haouita, Bou Saada, Great Eastern Erg third generation) even on the seaside (Tlêt formation) where a main marine regression occured. Bladelets industries makers settled down in some of these eolian accumulations. During Late Glacial (14 - 10, 000 years b. P.), temperate Europe type climatic fluctuations very probably occured. Bladelets industries persist up to about 10, 000 years B. P. while first Capsian industries are appearing. La compilation des données bibliographiques complétée par des données inédites et des observations de terrain tend à prouver que les fluctuations climatiques du Pléistocène supérieur dans le Bas-Sahara ont été contemporaines de celles d'Europe tempérée et de même sens (de froid et sec à chaud et plus humide).

40|$|Geochemical and geomorphic {{data from}} dune fields in southwestern Nebraska provide new {{evidence}} that the Nebraska Sand Hills once migrated across the North and South Platte rivers and dammed the largest tributary system to the Missouri River. The Lincoln County and Imperial dune fields, which lie downwind of the South Platte River, have compositions intermediate between the Nebraska Sand Hills (quartz-rich) and northeastern Colorado dunes (K-feldspar-rich). The most likely explanation for the intermediate composition is that the Lincoln County and Imperial dunes are derived {{in part from the}} Nebraska Sand Hills and in part from the South Platte River. The only mechanism by which the Nebraska Sand Hills could have migrated this far south is by complete infilling of what were probably perennially dry North Platte and South Platte river valleys.

40|$|This {{doctoral}} dissertation constitutes a reservoir characterization and tertiary recovery {{improvement of the}} Weber Formation, northwest Colorado. The Weber formation was deposited in an ancient desert environment and consists of intertonguing eolian dunes and fluvial deposits. Similar reservoirs are increasingly important to the petroleum industry, well known examples are in the Rotliegende in the North Sea oil fields and newly discovered Pennsylvanian strata in Saudi Arabia. This study gives scientists the first example that shows how eolian reservoirs are compartmentalized in three dimensions. Previous studies have concentrated on anisotropy in the <b>eolian</b> <b>sands</b> caused by the foreset dips of the eolian dunes, but these studies assumed that the <b>eolian</b> <b>sands</b> were relatively continuous and internally homogenous. This study shows that soils, ponds and discontinuous fluvial deposits can effectively compartmentalize a reservoir unit. ^ The dissertation consists of three studies, each addressed in a separate chapter, and each {{of which will be}} submitted to different scientific journals for publication. The first paper describes the different facies in the Weber sandstone and shows which form reservoir and which are potential barriers to fluid flow. The different depositional facies in the core were classified as a function of their depositional environment. Cross-sections and depositional models were developed to characterize the environment of deposition during the Lower and Upper Weber Formation ages. Finally, the different depositional facies were classified as a function of their potential reservoir quality. The depositional model allows us to extrapolate the geometries of reservoir and non-reservoir sandstones in three dimensions. ^ The second paper used well-logs and rock physics to quantify the permeabilities and porosities of the different depositional facies as a function of their rock properties. And correlated the potential reservoir and non-reservoir facies to well logs. This allows scientists to infer depositional environment and reservoir quality in other similar oil fields. Secondly, reservoir and non-reservoir rocks were distinguished based on their compressional and shear wave velocities. This allows scientists to infer reservoirs on seismic images, even where no wells are present. Those velocities have been employed to calculate compressional to shear wave ratios, Poisson 2 ̆ 7 s ratio, and acoustic and elastic impedance, which help to distinguish the rocks bearing oil from the water saturated rocks.

40|$|In local-scale {{groundwater}} flow problems, like {{for instance in}} contaminated groundwater studies, it becomes increasingly important for proper prediction of contaminant migration to incorporate small-scale geological and associated parameter heterogeneity in {{groundwater flow}} models. Of the micro-scale geological heterogeneities, the effect of grain fabric and lamination in unconsolidated sediments on the vertical anisotropy of effective hydraulic conductivity has received relatively little attention. This is mainly due to the low conductivity contrast between laminae {{in combination with the}} friable nature of unconsolidated sediment which makes it sensitive to disturbances during experimental procedures. As an alternative, digital image analysis of sediment thin sections was applied to separate and quantify both causes of anisotropy. The effective value of vertical anisotropy ratio of unconsolidated <b>eolian</b> dune <b>sand</b> as determined experimentally on distributed, orientated core plugs ranges between 1. 10 and 1. 50. This wide range is partly caused by artificial noise introduced by distributed sampling in a heterogeneous medium and assuming thereby that the sampled material is homogeneous. By applying digital image analysis of thin sections, high-resolution logs of hydraulic conductivity were generated. Simple upscaling of these values to effective conductivity parallel and perpendicular to sedimentary laminae provided quantitative estimates of the vertical anisotropy caused by lamination. Anisotropy values range between 1. 0 and 1. 075. The anisotropy ratio due to grain fabric ranges in value between 1. 05 and 1. 45 assuming that both anisotropy due to grain fabric and lamination are orientated identically. If {{this is not the case}} the effective anisotropy is the weighted mean of anisotropies of the constituent layer types. This study shows that for <b>eolian</b> <b>sands</b> the anisotropy owing to grain fabric dominates the effective value of anisotropy. If conductivity contrast between laminae increases, the contribution of anisotropy caused by grain fabric to the effective value of anisotropy decreases. © 2003 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|The stratigraphic {{subdivision}} and {{correlation of}} dune deposits is difficult, especially when age datings are not available. A {{better understanding of}} the controls on texture and composition of <b>eolian</b> <b>sands</b> is necessary to interpret ancient eolian sediments. The Imbituba-Jaguaruna coastal zone (Southern Brazil, 28 degrees- 29 degrees S) stands out due to its four well-preserved Late Pleistocene (eolian generation 1) to Holocene eolian units (eolian generations 2, 3, and 4). In this study, we evaluate the grain-size and heavy-mineral characteristics of the Imbituba-Jaguartma eolian units through statistical analysis of hundreds of sediment samples. Grain-size parameters and heavy-mineral content allow us to distinguish the Pleistocene from the Holocene units. The grain size displays a pattern of fining and better sorting from generation 1 (older) to 4 (younger), whereas the content of mechanically stable (dense and hard) heavy minerals decreases from eolian generation 1 to 4. The variation in grain size and heavy-mineral content records shifts in the origin and balance (input versus output) of eolian sediment supply attributable mainly to relative sea-level changes. Dunefields submitted to relative sea-level lowstand conditions (eolian generation 1) are characterized by lower accumulation rates and intense post-depositional dissection by fluvial incision. Low accumulation rates favor deflation in the eolian system, which promotes concentration of denser and stable heavy minerals (increase of ZTR index) as well as coarsening of <b>eolian</b> <b>sands.</b> Dissection involves the selective removal of finer sediments and less dense heavy minerals to the coastal source area. Under a high rate of relative sea-level rise and transgression (eolian generation 2), coastal erosion prevents deflation through high input of sediments to the coastal eolian source. This condition favors dunefield growth. Coastal erosion feeds sand from local sources to the <b>eolian</b> system. including <b>sands</b> from previous dunefields (eolian generation 1) and from drowned incised valleys. Therefore, dunefields corresponding to transgressive phases inherit the grain-size and heavy-mineral characteristics of previous dunefields, leading to selective enrichment of finer sands and lighter minerals. Eolian generations 3 and 4 developed during a regressive-progradational phase (Holocene relative sea level highstand). The high rate of sediment supply during the highstand phase prevents deflation. The lack of coastal erosion favors sediment supply from distal sources (fluvial sediments rich in unstable heavy minerals). Thus, dunefields of transgressive and highstand systems tracts may be distinguished from dunefields of the lowstand systems tract through high rates of accumulation (low deflation) in the former. The sediment source of the transgressive dunefields (high input of previously deposited coastal sands) differs from that of the highstand dunefields (high input of fluvial distal sands). Based on this case study, we propose a general framework for the relation between relative sea level, sediment supply and the texture and mineralogy of eolian sediments deposited in siliciclastic wet coastal zones similar to the Imbituba-Jaguaruna coast (C) 2009 Elsevier B.

40|$|Distinctive, eolian-dominated sandy {{deposits}} 35 m thick {{exposed in}} the SW {{margin of the}} Plio-Pleistocene Valdarno Basin in the Northern Apennines, Italy, reflect an unusually arid period in the region. Paleomagnetic investigation and 40 Ar/ 39 Ar dating of a tephra layer, 10 m above the <b>eolian</b> <b>sand,</b> suggest that the sand was deposited between about 2. 7 to 2. 4 Ma. This age {{is comparable to the}} global climatic deterioration that occurred at the Middle-Upper Pliocene transition. Eolian sediments are represented by cross-bedded sand, rippled sand and horizontal-bedded sand. The alluvial deposits, associated with the eolian sediment, consist of sheet-like beds of coarse sand and erosively based pebbly sand bodies. <b>Eolian</b> <b>sand,</b> together with fluvial sandy deposits, were formed in the medial-distal portion of an alluvial system, and represent the Rena Bianca Sand Unit. The eolian and alluvial deposits are arranged into sedimentary cycles (2 - 6 m thick), displaying wetting-drying-wetting upward trend recording second-order climatic oscillations of ca 40 ka. Each cycle is included between major bounding surfaces, defined by iron mineral encrustations. These bounding surfaces represent periods of reduced <b>eolian</b> <b>sand</b> accumulation caused by a rising water table. During the 2. 5 Ma global cooling the Valdarno Basin experienced a period of arid conditions owing to the influence of cold and dry eastern and northeaster trade wind. In contrast, during the Pleistocene, the uplift of the Pratomagno Ridge protected the Valdarno Basin from eastern and north-eastern trade winds, giving rise to relatively warm and wet conditions, and mitigating the regional and global climatic changes...|$|E
40|$|In {{continental}} margin basins, the hydrogeological setting is complex due to transgression/regression events that removed old sediments {{in the basin}} and formed new geologic units. Due to the geological complexity, the use of vertical electrical sounding {{has proven to be}} insufficient for groundwater explorations. The lack of understanding the geological underground has resulted in many boreholes with low yield or poor water quality. By performing electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) and induced polarization (IP) measurements in 11 villages in Mongicual district, three different layers covering the basement were identified: a weathered autochthon layer, a weathered allochthon layer (paleo-coastal dune) and eolian white sand layer. The drilling at successful boreholes penetrates formations where the resistivity value is between 220 and 770 Ωm, whereas at unsuccessful boreholes the lower parts of the drilled range have resistivity values higher than 770 Ωm. Also, the thickness ratio of the weathered and semi-weathered layer in the unsuccessful boreholes is less than 1 / 3, whereas in all successful boreholes the ration is higher than 1 / 2. The difference between autochthon and allochthon layers was detected by heavy minerals content in the red <b>eolian</b> <b>sand</b> layer (Tupuito formation) that increased the chargeability value. The groundwater with a conductivity higher than 2000 µS/cm is linked to the white <b>eolian</b> <b>sand.</b> The surface extension of white <b>eolian</b> <b>sand</b> layer is small to be mapped; therefore, by mapping the eolian white sand formation and the use of ERT and enhanced with IP method would lower the failure rate...|$|E
40|$|Based on {{data from}} the middle Yellow River, a model of erosion and {{sediment}} yield is proposed to describe coupled eolian and fluvial processes in a transitional zone from and to SUb-humid climates, and to explain rapid erosion and a high sediment yield in the zone. In the Study area, wind action predominates from March to June, which erodes weathered bedrock and transports <b>eolian</b> <b>sand</b> to gullies, river channels and floodplains. In the following Summer, especially from July to September, rainstorm runoff in gullies and river channels transports large quantities of fine loessic material, {{in the form of}} hyperconcentrated flow. As a result, most of the previously stored <b>eolian</b> <b>sand</b> and material supplied by mass-wasting of loess can be transported to the major tributaries and the main stream of the Yellow River, resulting in the high specific sediment yield. There exists all optimal grain size composition which maximizes Suspended sediment concentration in the study area, resulted from the combined wind-water processes. (c) 2005 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Investigations were {{conducted}} along the middle South Platte River to better define the geomorphic contexts of Paleoindian sites and {{to reconstruct the}} alluvial and eolian geochronology. Paleoindian sites {{are associated with the}} Kersey terrace (the downstream equivalent of the Broadway terrace). The Kersey alluvium was deposited during Clovis occupation and the surface stabilized by 10, 000 B. P. Post-Clovis sites post-date aggradation and stream downcutting may have started as early as 10, 500 B. P. Subsequent floodplain development and downcutting formed the Kuner terrace (the possible downstream equivalent of the Piney Creek terrace) no later than 3000 B. P. and the Hardin terrace probably within the last 1000 years. Soils on the Kersey terrace are Ustochrepts (gravelly alluvium) or Haplustalfs (sandy and clayey alluvium). Soils on the Kuner terrace are cumulic Ustorthents and Ustochrepts. Soils on the Hardin terrace are Ustorthents with no obvious horizonation. <b>Eolian</b> <b>sands</b> began accumulating in the region by 10, 000 B. P., but most are probably late Holocene deposits and are indicative of drier post-Pleistocene climate.

40|$|The Last Interglacial Period strata in the Milanggouwan {{section in}} the Salawusu River valley on the Ordos Plateau, China, have 8. 5 {{sedimentary}} cycles composed alternately of <b>eolian</b> dune <b>sands,</b> fluvio-lacustrine facies and paleosols. Based on comprehensive analyses {{on the distribution of}} magnetic susceptibility and CaCO 3 and paleo-ecology indicated by fossils in the region, it is considered that the sedimentation cycles resulted from dry-cold and warm-humid climate fluctuations. Magnetic susceptibility values and CaCO 3 contents in stratigraphic sectors I, III, V and II, IV basically respectively present peaks and low vales, and the former three can in time correlate with MIS 5 a, MIS 5 c and MIS 5 e successively and the latter two with MIS 5 b and MIS 5 d. In addition, some horizons of <b>eolian</b> dune <b>sands</b> and the low vales of their magnetic susceptibility and CaCO 3 are also correlated with 6 periods of cooling events indicated by the higher content of foraminifer Neogloboquadrina pachyderma (S.) documented in the V 29 — 191 drill in the North Atlantic and the cold events recorded by δ 18 O in the ice cores in GRIP, especially with 9 periods of dust events in Chinese Loess Plateau...|$|R
40|$|Mostly {{stabilized}} late Holocene <b>eolian</b> <b>sands</b> on the Southern High Plains of the United States {{were studied}} {{to determine their}} origins and to assess whether present dune stability depends more strongly on sediment supply, sediment availability, or transport limitations. Geomorphic, sedimentological, and geochemical trends indicate that late Holocene dunes formed under westerly paleowinds, broadly {{similar to those of}} today. Mineralogical and geochemical data indicate that the most likely source for the sands is not the Pecos River valley, but the Pleistocene Blackwater Draw Formation, an older, extensive eolian deposit in the region. These observations suggest that new sand is supplied whenever vegetation cover is diminished {{to the extent that the}} Blackwater Draw Formation can be eroded, in agreement with modern observations of wind erosion in the region. We conclude, therefore, that Southern High Plains dunes are stabilized primarily due to a vegetation cover. The dunes are thus sediment-availability limited. This conclusion is consistent with the observation that, in the warmest, driest part of the region (where vegetation cover is minimal), dunes are currently active over a large area. Geochemical data indicate that Southern High Plains dunes are the most mineralogically mature (quartz rich) sands yet studied in the Great Plains, which suggests a long history of eolian activity, either in the dune fields or during deposition of the Blackwater Draw Formation...|$|R
