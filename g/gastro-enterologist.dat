40|$|SUMMARY Persistent {{diarrhoea}} with mucus production {{developed in}} a 37 year homosexual man, and an initial diagnosis of ulcerative colitis was made after barium enema examination and rectal biopsy. The patient later developed cutaneous lesions which proved to be Kaposi's sarcoma, and the bowel lesion was also subsequently shown to be Kaposi's sarcoma. This tumour occurred {{as a manifestation of}} the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). The patient was treated with alpha interferon, with partial regression of the skin lesions, but progression of the bowel tumour. Because of severe bowel symptoms, including episodes of subacute intestinal obstruction, the localised bowel disease was treated with radiotherapy. In view of the increasing incidence of AIDS, a diagnosis of Kaposi's sarcoma must be considered in homosexual men presenting with persistent diarrhoea, for which no infectious cause can be demonstrated. Case history The patient, a 37 year homosexual hairdresser, was well until July 1982, when he developed diarrhoea, with frequent loose stool and a mucus rectal discharge. He was examined at a clinic for sexually transmitted diseases, and a rectal gonococcal infection was found; however, his symptoms persisted after the gonorrhoea had been eradicated. Over the following three months he passed up to 12 loose stools a day, with mucus, but no blood or pus. Repeated stool culture and microscopy were negative, but he was treated empirically with metronidazole for presumed Entamoeba histolytica infection. There was no clinical response, and the patient was referred to a consultant <b>gastro-enterologist</b> for investigation. In November 1982 a barium enema was performed, which showed mucosal ulceration and oedema in the rectum and distal sigmoid colon, compatible with ulcerative colitis. Sigmoidoscopy revealed an ulcerate...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} {{increasing}} recognition that the pattern of presentation of coeliac disease may be changing. The classic sprue syndrome with diarrhoea and weight loss may be less common than the more subtle presentations of coeliac disease such as an isolated iron deficiency anaemia. As a result, the diagnosis of this treatable condition is often delayed or missed. Recent serologic screening tests allow non-invasive screening to identify most patients with the disease and can be applied in patients with even subtle symptoms indicative of coeliac disease. Both benign and malignant complications of coeliac disease can be avoided by early diagnosis and a strict compliance with a gluten free diet. Aim The aim {{of this study is to}} evaluate the trends in clinical presentation of patients diagnosed with adult coeliac disease. In addition, we studied the biochemical and serological features and the prevalence of associated conditions in patients with adult coeliac disease. Methods This is an observational, retrospective, cross-sectional review of the medical notes of 32 adult patients attending the specialist coeliac clinic in a district general hospital. Results Anaemia was the most common mode of presentation accounting for 66 % of patients. Less than half of the patients had any of the classical symptoms of coeliac disease and 25 % had none of the classical symptoms at presentation. Anti-gliadin antibodies, anti-endomysial antibody and anti-tissue transglutaminase showed 75 %, 68 % and 90 % sensitivity respectively. In combination, serology results were 100 % sensitive as screening tests for adult coeliac disease. Fifty nine percent patients had either osteoporosis or osteopenia. There were no malignant complications observed during the follow up of our patients. Conclusion Most adults with coeliac disease have a sub clinical form of the disease and iron deficiency anaemia may be its sole presenting symptom. Only a minority of adult coeliac disease patients present with classical mal-absorption symptoms of diarrhoea and weight loss. Patients with atypical form of disease often present initially to hospital specialists other than a <b>gastro-enterologist.</b> An awareness of the broad spectrum of presentations of adult coeliac disease, among doctors both in primary care and by the various hospital specialists in secondary care, is necessary to avoid delays in diagnosis. It is important to include serological screening tests for coeliac disease systematically in the evaluation of adult patients with unexplained iron deficiency anaemia or unexplained gastro-intestinal symptoms and in those who are considered to be at increased risk for coeliac disease. </p...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Adenocarcinoma of the {{oesophagus}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} increasing types of cancer in western world. Adenocarcinoma of the oesophagus is the result of Barrett’s oesophagus, in which squamous epithelium is replaced by columnar epithelium in combination with gastro-intestinal metaplasia. Due to the late recognition of oesophagus cancer, the prognosis is often poor. In The Netherlands surveillance of the Barrett’s oesophagus is well practiced and consists of endoscopy with biopsy for histological examination. Recently there have been different developments in endoscopy. One of these is the virtual chromo-endoscopy, which is based on the principal that light of short wavelengths reflects in the more superficial tissue and light of larger wavelengths reflecting in deeper tissue. The overall idea is that this will be helpful for diagnosis of lesions. In the present research we investigated the role of de Fuji Intelligent Chromo Endoscopy (FICE - Fujinon), one of the virtual chromo-endoscopy techniques. Materials and methods: We derived a test with two series of 12 images, one with images from white light endoscopy and one with the same images combined with images from FICE. 15 <b>gastro-enterologists</b> were asked to differentiate the images in the four stadia of Barrett’s oesophagus (intestinal metaplasia, low-grade dysplasia, high-grade dysplasia and adenocarcinoma). Additionally they were asked to note how sure they were and what determined their decision. Results: It seemed to be hard to differentiate the series of pictures, mainly because most <b>gastro-enterologists</b> were not used to use this differentiation. Despite that the answers did correlate significantly well with the histological examinations. The <b>gastro-enterologists</b> seemed to focus mainly on dichotomy in differentiation between intestinal metaplasia and low-grade dysplasia on one side and high-grade dysplasia and adenocarcinoma on the other side. The main added value is found in the high-grade dysplasia. Which is supported by an increased differentiation between high-grade dysplasia and adenocarcinoma. Conclusion: The FICE seems to be a helpful technique when determining the stage of Barrett’s oesophagus mainly in the critical zone of low-grade and high-grade dysplasia and also for differentiating high-grade dysplasia and adenocarcinoma. The most gaining factor in this is the visualisation of the vascular system in the oesophagus. ...|$|R

JCBNSummary Non-steroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drugs (NSAIDs), {{which are}} used for the treat-ment of several inflammatory disorders including rheumatoid arthritis, are well known to cause gastroduodenal mucosal lesions as an adverse effect. Recently, the serious problem of NSAID-induced small intestinal damage has become a topic {{of great interest to}} <b>gastro-enterologists,</b> since capsule endoscopy and double-balloon enteroscopy are available for the detection of small intestinal lesions. Such lesions have been of great concern in clinical settings, and their treatment and prevention must be devised as soon as possible. Proton pump inhibitors (PPI), such as lansoprazole and omeprazole, show a potent anti-secretory effect. PPIs also have a gastroprotective effect, independent of their anti-secretory actions, which is probably mediated by inhibition of neutrophil functions as well as antioxidant actions. Administration of lansoprazole reduced the severity of the intestinal lesions in a dose-dependent manner, but omeprazole had no effect. The amount of heme oxygenase- 1 (HO- 1) protein in the intestinal mucosa was significantly increased by lansoprazole, but not by omeprazole. These results suggest that lansoprazole, but not omeprazole, ameliorates indomethacin-induced small intestinal ulceration through upregulation of HO- 1 /carbo...|$|R
40|$|The {{study of}} the small bowel by barium after intubations has been {{standardized}} by various workers since 1943. Enteroclysis is the term used in USA, while term “Small Bowel Enema ” (SBE) is widely used in Europe. In India it took sometime before enteroclysis became established procedure, but still it is not practiced in many centers because of various reasons and apathy of dedicated radiologists. With advent of fiberoptic endoscopes and availability of well trained and devoted <b>gastro-enterologists,</b> barium studies of the oesophagus, stomach and duodenum and colon has virtually disappeared in well equipped medical centres. The barium studies of the small intestine has undergone modification from conventional follow through, high dose follow through, fluroscopic follow through and small bowel enteroclysis (Enteroclysis). The small bowel enema itself has undergone evolution and author has tried single contrast barium enema, SBE with thin barium, with air contrast and with methyl cellulose, most satisfactory is with methyl cellulose. The SBE is complimentary to other cross-sectional imaging like ultrasound, CT or MRI. The barium study is an art, more difficult than CT or MRI and tremendous operator-oriented. It cannot be left to technician to do barium without supervision and it being a dynamic process, lesion will be missed if each and every loop of the bowel is not monitored or visualized on TV fluroscopy, documented and interpreted correctly.

Because of its concern about public health and standards of nutrition, DANA (Direction de l'Alimentation et de la Nutrition Appliquée - Department of Food and Applied Nutrition) in Benin has now authorized the addition of nutrients to gari. Gari is nearly 85 % glucosides but it can now be eriched with iron, iodine or vitamin A in order to counter the anaemia, goitre and eye diseases which are endemic in areas where there is over-consumption of cassava. A study carried out by DANA indicates that, while gari has few nutrients other than starch, it does have the high fibre an essential ingredient for a healthy diet. Indeed there is a correlation between the high consumption of food rich in non-digestible fibre and the low incidence of cancer in Africa. It also seems to be effective in controlling ulcers. As a result researchers, particularly nutritionist and <b>gastro-enterologists,</b> are showing great interest in gari as a food source which has valuable health benefits and whose deficiencies can very easily be corrected by the addition of minerals and vitamins.

40|$|These {{guidelines}} were compiled by a multidis-ciplinary {{group at the}} request of the chairman of the British Society of Gastroenterology’s Clinical Services Committee. The prime tar-gets for these guidelines are consultant <b>gastro-enterologists,</b> specialist registrars in training, and general practitioners. The purpose is to identify and inform the key decisions to be made in the management of patients thought to have functional diseases of the gut. As these comprise the commonest conditions seen by gastroenterologists, the working party repre-sented a wide spectrum of practitioners in gas-troenterology, including gastroenterologists from both district general hospitals and tertiary referral centres, as well as primary care practi-tioners, psychiatrists, psychologists, and diet-itians. 1. 2 SPECIFIC DIFFICULTIES Compared with producing guidelines for the management of well defined diseases such as peptic ulcer where there is a clear disease entity, an obvious end point, and highly eVective treatments, drawing up guidelines for functional gastroenterological disorders has had many diYculties. Clinical trials have been diYcult to design as the conditions being treated are highly variable with many possible end points, and most therapies only marginally more eVective than placebo. Early trials were diYcult to evaluate because of inadequate patient definition so that many questions have yet to be addressed with good quality ran-domised controlled clinical trials. Most of our recommendations are therefore supported by clinical experience rather than randomised controlled clinical trials. Finally, because func-tional diseases, although potentially debilitat-ing, are non-fatal there are few uniformly avail-able audit measures such as mortality or survival times by which to judge or compare diVerent treatment regimens in diVerent areas of clinical practice...|$|R
40|$|Hereditary {{haemochromatosis}} (HH) is {{a disorder}} of iron homeostasis with an autosomal recessive inheritance. The prevalence is 1 / 200 to 1 / 400 in Northern Europe and the carrier frequency is 1 / 10. The penetrance of HH is rather low. Homozygous carriers of the p. C 282 Y mutation may remain asymptomatic {{and have a}} normal quality of life (QoL). But iron accumulation can cause organ damage, resulting in liver dysfunction (fibrosis, cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma), arthropathy, diabetes mellitus, and this {{can have an impact}} on the QoL. Complications and symptoms can regress by intensive treatment reducing the iron overload of the body. The most common treatment is phlebotomy every week/fortnight during the depletion phase and every three to six months as maintenance therapy and consists of bloodletting of approximately 500 ml of whole blood (representing about 250 mg of iron). Secondly, erythrocytapheresis can be performed and is a treatment by which red blood cells are removed using an apheresis device. This is used in patients who do not tolerate phlebotomies for several reasons. There are different guidelines on the topics of diagnosis and treatment of HH but they do not always correspond well and recommendations are frequently based on expert opinion (guidelines from the European Association for the Study of the Liver; the American Association from the Study of Liver Diseases; Dutch guideline). Related to the diverse presenting symptoms, patients are followed by different specialized healthcare providers, varying from <b>gastro-enterologists,</b> hematologists, rheumatologist to endocrinologists, internists, but also general practitioners, which results in differential follow-up and treatment strategies. There is a lack of congruence in follow-up strategies, as well as a gap in information transfer, continuity and care coordination. Cases from teaching hospitals are known where HH patients had developed cirrhosis and HCC, while cirrhosis was not diagnosed and therefore surveillance screening of the liver with ultrasound had not been performed. HH is a chronic condition and several care models for the management of chronic diseases exist, with their specific focus areas. The Chronic Care Model (CCM) of Wagner as well as the Innovative Care for Chronic Conditions (ICCC) are already used in several settings to optimize care for patients with chronic conditions as HIV/AIDS, hypertension, diabetes, depression. t also in care for patients with HH there is an urgent need for the development of a management model, organized from a chronic care perspective. Initial treatment in a (university) hospital setting should be followed by a phase of maintenance treatment, in order to sustain the positive effects of the initial more intense treatment phase and improve outcomes on the short and long-term. The overall aim of this doctoral project is to evaluate the current care for patients with hereditary haemochromatosis, resulting in four research questions (RQ). RQ 1 : What is the quality of the existing guidelines for hereditary haemochromatosis? RQ 2 : Which treatment and follow-up is required to ensure good quality of care in HH patients? RQ 3 : How is the current care at the University hospital Leuven, Gasthuisberg for patients with hereditary haemochromatosis, based on predefined key-interventions (RQ 2) ? RQ 4 : Does the intake of proton pump inhibitors decrease phlebotomy need?status: publishe...|$|R
