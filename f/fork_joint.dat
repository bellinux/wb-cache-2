50|$|Ash Fork High School is a {{high school}} in Ash Fork, Arizona. It is the only high school under the {{jurisdiction}} of the Ash <b>Fork</b> <b>Joint</b> Unified School District, which also includes an elementary school and middle school.|$|E
50|$|The chassis {{was entirely}} new. The metal to metal multi-plate clutch {{requires}} no lubrication. Two plates are phosphor bronze, {{the others are}} steel. There is a double universal joint (a sliding block allows for withdrawal of the clutch) between the clutch and the gearbox. The gearbox is mounted on a separate underframe, all its shafts run on ball bearings. There are three forward speeds. The propellor shaft is fully enclosed and has a ball and <b>fork</b> <b>joint</b> at its forward end. Final drive is by overhead worm.|$|E
50|$|The frame had steel {{forgings}} {{on every}} <b>joint.</b> <b>Forks</b> and handlebars {{were the same}} as the Series 20 Excelsior. Among its several advanced features were electric lighting and a fully enclosed chain.|$|R
30|$|Sensory testing—sensory {{testing was}} done {{first on the}} normal side {{followed}} by abnormal sides. Pinprick and touch was tested. For temperature testing, cold metal rod, and for vibration, a 128 -Hz tuning <b>fork</b> was used. <b>Joint</b> position sense was tested in toes and fingers using 1 ° deflection.|$|R
60|$|The {{servants}} now {{placed the}} {{dishes on the}} small tables, male attendants waiting on the men, while the women were served by females. Egyptians were unacquainted {{with the use of}} knives and <b>forks,</b> the <b>joints</b> being cut up by the attendants into small pieces, and the guests helping themselves from the dishes with the aid of pieces of bread held between the fingers. Vegetables formed {{a large part of the}} meal, the meats being mixed with them to serve as flavoring; for in so hot a climate a vegetable diet is far more healthy than one composed principally of meat. While the meal was proceeding a party of female musicians, seated on the ground in one corner of the room, played and sang.|$|R
40|$|Forking is {{the process}} of {{fracture}} bifurcation ¡rito two or more diverging fracture planes. It occurs when a fracture reaches a critical velocity concomitant with its approach to a previous discontinuity. The literature gives a comprehensive 2 -D description of forking, and this work presents a 3 -D description of these structures. Outcrop observations suggest that the radiant line (line bounding the parent joint and the bifurcated fractures) is curve shaped (like fracture tip while propagation), and the angle between bifurcated fractures remains aproximately the Same all along the vertical dimension of the joint. This geometry results from the influence of both the previous perpendicular joint towards the parent <b>joint</b> <b>forks</b> and the lithologic boundary at top and bottom of the jointed laye...|$|R
5000|$|A {{fixed gear}} frame, with a cream color known as [...] "Kustard" [...] and the {{signature}} {{color of the}} mark, with 120mm rear dropout spacing. The G typified the eclectic nature of Koswell frames: steel frame and <b>fork,</b> with lugged <b>joints,</b> but a TIG-welded bottom bracket and threadless fork, melding both traditional styles (see Rivendell) and contemporary innovations. [...] The frame was built with road geometry, but used track dropouts and a narrow dropout spacing, which precluded installation of a derailleur or multi-speed hub. Fender and rack mounts, and generous clearances that allowed for wide tires and fenders both, signalled clearly that this bike {{was meant to be}} used on the road. But its unwillingness to slavishly imitate traditional designs and geometries, or outdated and inferior manufacturing techniques, set it apart from a retro style of other boutique manufacturers.|$|R
60|$|And {{therefore}} we see {{at once that}} the stem of Gaspar Poussin's tall tree, {{on the right of}} the La Riccia, in the National Gallery, is a painting of a carrot or a parsnip, not of the trunk of a tree. For, being so near that every individual leaf is visible, we should not have seen, in nature, one branch or stem actually tapering. We should have received an impression of graceful diminution; but we should have been able, on examination, to trace it <b>joint</b> by <b>joint,</b> <b>fork</b> by fork, into the thousand minor supports of the leaves. Gaspar Poussin's stem, on the contrary, only sends off four or five minor branches altogether, and both it and they taper violently, and without showing why or wherefore--without parting with a single twig--without showing one vestige of roughness or excrescence--and leaving, therefore, their unfortunate leaves to hold on as best they may. The latter, however, are clever leaves, and support themselves as swarming bees do, hanging on by each other.|$|R
50|$|KXMB {{is owned}} by Nexstar Media Group and serves as the {{flagship}} of KX Television, a regional network of three stations relaying CBS network programming and other programs provided by KXMB across central and western North Dakota, as well as bordering counties in Montana and South Dakota. The three satellite stations clear all network and syndicated programming as provided through KXMB but air station identifications and commercial inserts. KXMC-TV in Minot also produces separate local newscasts, KXMD-TV in Williston simulcasts KXMC's programming, and KXMA-TV in Dickinson simulcasts KXMB's programming. KXMC is the oldest station of the KX group, and was the flagship station originating programming until master control and internal operations were moved to KXMB in the 2000s. KXMB and KXMC often share news stories (along with ABC affiliates WDAY-TV in Fargo and WDAZ-TV in Grand <b>Forks),</b> and co-produce <b>joint</b> morning and 5:00 p.m. newscasts seen on all four stations. The four stations are counted as a single unit for ratings purposes. Dish Network only provides KXMC, while DirecTV only provides KXMB, as central and western North Dakota's CBS affiliate.|$|R
50|$|There {{is a high}} {{definition}} feed provided on Midcontinent digital channel 603 and SRT digital channel 503. Owned by Nexstar Media Group, it has studios on the intersection of 2nd Street SE and 18th Avenue SE in Minot. KXMC is the oldest station and served as the flagship of the KX Television regional network until the 2000s, when master control and internal operations were moved to KXMB-TV in Bismarck. While being one of two full-fledged stations of the KX network, KXMC is actually considered a semi-satellite of KXMB. It clears all network and syndicated programming as provided through its parent but airs separate newscasts, station identifications, and commercial inserts. KXMD-TV in Williston simulcasts KXMC while KXMA-TV in Dickinson simulcasts KXMB. KXMB and KXMC often share news stories (along with ABC affiliates WDAY-TV in Fargo and WDAZ-TV in Grand <b>Forks),</b> and co-produce <b>joint</b> morning and 5:00 p.m. newscasts seen on all four stations.

40|$|Cardan joint {{is a very}} {{widely used}} {{assembly}} in many mechanical fields [1]. It is comprised of an {{input and output shafts}} with two forks and a cross. Each fork hole is connected to a cross pin by means of a revolute joint. In transmission simulations, it is often included using a “black box” approach, by adding coupling relationships between the relative velocities of the connected shafts. On the other side, in many applications, it is also necessary to model and simulate the joint in details in order to assess the internal reaction forces between pins and holes. The most severe complication is that the Cardan joint is an overconstrained system. In standard multibody simulations in which the kinematic restraints are modeled introducing constraint equations, this may lead to the indeterminacy of the reaction forces. Moreover, in an overconstrained system, it is impossible {{to take into account the}} effect of manufacturing and assembling errors that are always present in the actual parts. In fact, the presence of these errors is somewhat managed by the clearances and elasticity of the components which are in general neglected in a rigid body model with kinematic constraint equations. Scientific literature often reports study on universal joints by simplifying the mechanism deleting the overabundant constraints [2 - 6]. Other studies in multibody dynamics introduce the presence of clearances in revolute and cylindrical for overcoming the redundancies [7]. In order to avoid all these problems and to produce a multibody model able to take into account the effects of elasticity and manufacturing errors, a specific modeling technique has been used. All the kinematic pin-hole constraints have been replaced by penalty systems of two intelligent nonlinear piecewise springs by using the approach proposed by Brutti et al. [8] According to this approach, the springs have variable stiffness and damping characteristics in order to take into account different types of contact (line contact, single point contact, two-point contact). Moreover, the <b>joint</b> <b>forks</b> and cross pins have been modeled using the discrete flexible multibody techniques by splitting the rigid beam-shaped bodies into several smaller bodies connected by matrix spring elements that simulate the elastic compliance of the structure. Several design scenarios have been simulated including geometrical and dimensional errors of components. In particular, four errors have been included: position error on the alignment of the holes of one of the fork, angular misalignment between the holes of one of the fork, angular misalignment on the alignment of two perpendicular pins of the cross, position error of one of the pin of the cross. The influence of these errors on the performance of the joint have been evaluated in terms of kinematic parameters (velocity and acceleration of the output shaft with respect to the input one) and in terms of dynamic parameters (forces between pin and holes). The results are presented in graphs and tables using dimensionless influence parameters. They can be used for the optimization of the allocation of tolerances and for improving the design of Cardan Joint in specific field such as high-speed mechanisms, precision devices, high-efficiency driveline, etc...|$|R
