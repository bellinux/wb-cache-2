The youngest brother does not trust Death and asks {{for a way to}} stop Death from following him, so Death reluctantly gives him his Cloak of Invisibility. Afterwards, the brothers go their separate ways.|$|E

5|$|The Knight on g6 {{puts the}} f4-pawn under pressure, {{but may be}} embarrassed later by the pawn thrust f4–f5. Now 6.a3, an attempt to deny squares from the Bf8 by {{continuing}} with b2–b4 or Bc1–e3, does not achieve its goal after 6...Bc5! 7.b4?! Bxg1! 8.Rxg1 0-0! 9.Qf3 d6 10.g4 a5 11.b5 Nd7 12.Ra2 Nc5 when Black's superior pawn structure and well-positioned Nc5 <b>gives</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> advantage. That leaves White with the choice between 6.Nf3 and 6.Be3.|$|E

There he meets the chief of Vayuputras, Mithra, who {{turns out to be}} his maternal uncle. Mithra convinces the Vayuputras that Shiva is the real Neelkanth and <b>gives</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> Pashupathiastra which acts on a specific target, rather than annihilating everything like the Brahmastra. Meanwhile, Parvateshwar uses decoy ships to give an impression to Kali {{that he was going to}} attack Panchavati.

5|$|The Naval Academy won {{the contest}} 8-0, {{which made it}} the Academy's first ever {{football}} victory, {{and was the first}} match in which they recorded points.

Carter's single win <b>gives</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> second fewest in Navy football history, behind interim coach Rick Lantz.

5|$|At the 1920 elections, {{domestic}} interests aligned {{against those}} of the BSAC, rather than unreservedly in favour of responsible government. The run up to the 1922 referendum was long and acrimonious. For the Union were most of the leading citizens of Salisbury and Bulawayo, the British, South African and Rhodesian presses, the BSAC, and the British government. Against them was the Responsible Government Association, founded in 1917 by Ethel Tawse Jollie. Wallis, in his biography of Coghlan, One Man's Hand, <b>gives</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> credit for {{the victory of the}} responsible government lobby. Lewis Hastings, reviewing Wallis's book, recalls campaigning with Coghlan and says that he was the undisputed leader of the movement—highly competent, with a clear vision, principled and sincere. He attributes Coghlan's resolve to his years in Kimberley, where he experienced the autocratic rule of the De Beers mining company, owned by the BSAC.|$|E

Link enters the castle, defeats Onox, and rescues Din, who tells him that he is now a true hero and must face a new trial soon. Twinrova, watching the scene remotely, states that the Flame of Destruction has been powered by the havoc Onox has wrought.|$|E

Skírnir replies that he accepts the mission but only in exchange for Freyr's sword, which can fight on its own. Freyr <b>gives</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> sword and Skírnir sets off.

50|$|He prayed <b>the</b> regent to <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> archbishopric of Cambrai, {{the richest}} in France. This demand was {{supported}} by George I and the regent yielded. Dubois aimed for the Cardinals hat because such an ecclesiastical title would <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> utmost prominence and precedence in the Conseil den haut, <b>giving</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> ability to remove his political adversaries with impunity. The regent was initially reluctant: though not himself a religious man, he could hardly regard Dubois as a suitable archbishop, {{at a time when}} the ambitious Claudine Guérin de Tencin was universally believed to be his mistress.|$|R
