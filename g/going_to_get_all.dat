[...] She also stated that Maya is only a {{background}} character throughout the series, meaning her role is limited, and does not play a spy or becoming [...] "part of this mafia or that mafia." [...] Due to her limited appearance, the actress was available to perform other projects, including The Sarah Jane Adventures and Conan the Barbarian, as well as spending the free time with her daughter. Rouass does not participate in any stunt work, but does appear in [...] "a lot of passionate scenes." [...] Having gotten used to filming sex scenes in Footballers' Wives, Rouass noticed that while humour was involved in Footballers' Wives, Spooks was more passionate and very choreographed. In an interview with the Daily Mirror, Rouass recalled one of the scenes; [...] "there's one scene where we get together in the kitchen and the director was like, 'Come on, let's be honest, you haven't seen each other for years, you're not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>all</b> romantic, you're going to shag her on the table.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|In the Court of Appeal {{summary of}} the case, Williams stated that various jurors misconstrued as a threat a {{question}} that he asked defense counsel {{at the close of}} the guilt phase. The trial record shows that after the jurors returned their guilty verdicts, Williams said, [...] "Sons of bitches" [...] in a voice sufficiently loud that the court reporter included it in the trial transcript. [...] "On the day that the jury began its penalty-phase deliberations, an alternate juror reported to the bailiff that he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>all</b> of them." ...|$|E

I think that if you were to describe this recruiting class, they are a big, athletic bunch of athletes who can run and hit. They are also good students. I am really putting an emphasis on guys who can be successful in life, and who have goals that they want to achieve... We have 15 local-area players. There are some others that we would have liked to have, but you are never <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>all</b> of them. We put a lot of stock in trying to recruit the local-area kids." ...|$|E
5000|$|In July 1997, Jeremić co-founded {{and became}} the {{financial}} manager of the Organization of Serbian Students Abroad (OSSA), the first international Serbian student association, {{which at the time}} had several thousand members. He was an active supporter of Otpor! ("Resistance!"), the Serbian civic youth movement that employed non-violent civil disobedience tactics against Milošević's government in the hope of spurning democratic reforms. He became even more determined to see Milošević toppled during and after NATO's bombing of Yugoslavia {{in the spring and summer}} of 1999. [...] "This guy ... Milošević," [...] Jeremić recalled thinking, [...] "he has to be removed, because he’s <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> us <b>all</b> buried. If he stays, he’s <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> us <b>all</b> buried." ...|$|R

2500|$|Controversy arose {{before the}} start of the 1976 season when Golden Gaters {{co-owner}} Larry King acting in his capacity as WTT president changed the date of a match between the Pittsburgh Triangles and Boston Lobsters from May 8 to May 16, to free up Evonne Goolagong for a promotional event. Triangles owner Frank Fuhrer protested the change and called for a vote of the owners to overrule the decision. The Golden Gaters abstained from voting. The Lobsters, who were hosting the match in question, voted to accept the schedule change. However, Fuhrer got six other owners to side with him to overrule King's decision. Later, the sponsor of the promotional event appealed to Fuhrer personally and bought $10,000 worth of tickets to two Triangles matches resulting in Fuhrer accepting the schedule change. The conflicts of interest that were pervasive throughout WTT clearly caused dissent among some owners. Fuhrer was quoted as saying, [...] "We're the defending champs, and I'm not having Larry King change my schedule on me to accommodate his own interests. We're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>all</b> the conflict of interest out of this league." ...|$|E

5000|$|In 1994, Johnson and {{his crew}} {{received}} a police escort following a spring training game. In that game, Johnson had a heated confrontation with Gary DiSarcina. DiSarcina was ejected from the game, but claimed Johnson instigated the dispute by insulting DiSarcina's hitting ability. Two players alleged Johnson told DiSarcina, [...] "You're a [...]220 hitter and I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> (<b>get)</b> you <b>all</b> year." [...] The ejection was DiSarcina's first as a professional baseball player.|$|R

50|$|The team sees {{a police}} van outside, {{and think that}} it is the rescue team, but {{it turns out to be}} Aangre's men. After a few minutes of heavy firing, which {{thoroughly}} depletes the team's ammunition, Aangre's men drop off the body of the constable who was trying to repair the police van, along with a message to hand Ansari over to them. Shekhar, realising that there is no alternative, grabs Ansari and tries to hand him over, but Anant stands in his way. There is a showdown between the two, in which Shekhar accuses Anant of being a useless cop who's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> them <b>all</b> killed because of his high-minded principles.|$|R

60|$|Godolphin was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>all</b> his old company {{together}} {{as far as}} possible, {{with the exception of}} Miss Pettrell, and there was to be little or no delay, because the actors had mostly got back to New York, and were ready to renew their engagements.

6000|$|... "Give me time, dear," [...] he pleaded. [...] "The hack-work is only makeshift, and I don't take it seriously. Give me two years. I shall {{succeed in}} that time, and the editors {{will be glad}} to buy my good work. I know what I am saying; I have faith in myself.

As for business, I shall never succeed at it. I am not in sympathy with it. It strikes me as dull, and stupid, and mercenary, and tricky. Anyway I am not adapted for it. I'd never get beyond a clerkship, and how could you and I be happy on the paltry earnings of a clerk? I want the best of everything in the world for you, and the only time when I won't want it will be when there is something better. And I'm going to get it, <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>all</b> of it. The income of a successful author makes Mr. Butler look cheap.

6000|$|Also, in {{the first}} {{fortnight}} of his stay, he had called at every house, alike in Downhill and Uphill, to the great surprise {{of some of the}} families, who had not in the memory of man seen a parson cross their threshold. Some did not like it, such as old Dame Verdon, who, though she could hardly get out of bed, was very sore about the new school; and when her friends came to see her, told them wonderful stories which she had picked up--or Lizzie had from some hawker--that the gentlefolks thought there were too many children for the rates and taxes, and they were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> them <b>all</b> into the school, and make an end of them.

"It's {{all very}} well to talk that way when you're three {{thousand}} miles from home, but {{you know as well}} as I do, Jim, that your step-mother, though she's a delightful woman, isn't the sort you can assert yourself with.

She's the boss all right, and old Pett does just what he's told to. I guess it's the same with me, Jim. There's a certain type of man that's just born to have it put over on him by a certain type of woman. I'm that sort of man and your stepmother's that sort of woman.

5000|$|After this, Lannes was to {{be tested}} as a commander-in-chief, for Napoleon took him to Spain in 1808, {{and gave him a}} {{detached}} wing of the army, with which he won a victory over Castaños at Tudela on 22 November. In January 1809 he was sent to attempt the capture of Saragossa, and by 21 February, after one of the most stubborn defences in history, was in possession of the place. He said, [...] "this damned Bonaparte is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> us <b>all</b> killed" [...] after his last campaign in Spain. In 1808, Napoleon created him Duc de Montebello, and in 1809, for the last time, gave him command of the advanced guard. He took part in the engagements around Eckmühl and the advance on Vienna. With his corps he led the French army across the Danube, and bore the brunt, with Masséna, of the terrible battle of Aspern-Essling. On 22 May he received a mortal wound. His eldest son was made a peer of France by Louis XVIII.|$|R
5000|$|In October 2010 Setzer {{finally had}} enough {{confidence}} in his product to open for business, financing it with $17,000 in savings.

5000|$|In a 1978 {{oral history}} {{interview}} that McHugh {{gave to the}} John F.

Due to safety concerns that there was a conspiracy, Jacqueline Kennedy's repeated requests, {{and the fact that the}} plane's interior cabin was quite warm, McHugh had requested that the plane take off. When the plane still had not taken off, McHugh went forward to again ask pilot James Swindal why the plane had not taken off and he was told that Johnson did not want the plane to take off yet.

60|$|DEAR MR. STEAD,--Peace by compulsion. That seems {{a better}} idea than the other. Peace by persuasion has a {{pleasant}} sound, but I think {{we should not be}} able to work it. We should have to tame the human race first, and history seems to show that that cannot be done. Can't we reduce the armaments little by little--on a pro rata basis--by concert of the powers? Can't we get four great powers to agree to reduce their strength 10 per cent a year and thrash the others into doing likewise? For, of course, we cannot expect all of the powers to be in their right minds at one time. It has been tried. We are not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> try <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>all</b> of them <b>to</b> go into the scheme peaceably, are we? In that case I must withdraw my influence; because, for business reasons, I must preserve the outward signs of sanity. Four is enough if they can be securely harnessed together. They can compel peace, and peace without compulsion would be against nature and not operative. A sliding scale of reduction of 10 per cent a year has a sort of plausible look, and I am willing to try that if three other powers will join. I feel sure that the armaments are now many times greater than necessary for the requirements of either peace or war. Take wartime for instance. Suppose circumstances made it necessary for us to fight another Waterloo, and that it would do what it did before--settle a large question and bring peace. I will guess that 400,000 men were on hand at Waterloo (I have forgotten the figures). In five hours they disabled 50,000 men. It took them that tedious, long time because the firearms delivered only two or three shots a minute. But we would do the work now as it was done at Omdurman, with shower guns, raining 600 balls a minute. Four men to a gun--is that the number? A hundred and fifty shots a minute per man. Thus a modern soldier is 149 Waterloo soldiers in one. Thus, also, we can now retain one man out of each 150 in service, disband the others, and fight our Waterloos just as effectively as we did eighty-five years ago. We should do the same beneficent job with 2,800 men now that we did with 400,000 then. The allies could take 1,400 of the men, and give Napoleon 1,400 and then whip him.|$|R
5000|$|When Hayward first {{emerged as}} a star at the World U-19s, and agents started leaving {{messages}} with his parents, they expressed both surprise and concern. His father felt unprepared for the process of counseling his son through the draft process, while his mother felt that their son was not yet spiritually ready to handle the temptations of the NBA and was not convinced that he {{was good enough to}} play in the league. Eventually, his parents decided that his father would learn about the draft and his mother would [...] "put it in the Lord's hands and pray about it". While his father talked with agents and other players who had left early, Butler coach Brad Stevens talked with NBA scouts and general managers; both eventually {{came to the conclusion that}} Gordon Hayward was projected as a top-20 pick in the 2010 NBA draft even before Butler's NCAA tournament run. As his parents left Lucas Oil Stadium after the NCAA final, they had one final exchange regarding their son's basketball future. His mother said, [...] "If God wanted him to go to the NBA, he would have hit the shot," [...] but his father responded, [...] "What else is he <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do, <b>get</b> Butler <b>all</b> the way back to the final and hit the shot?"
