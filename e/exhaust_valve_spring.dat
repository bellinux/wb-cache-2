50|$|This {{was a more}} {{expensive}} engine design. Its advantages over competing L-head engines included more power from its higher compression, better intake mixture flow, less susceptibility to pinging, and greater reliability from its cooling of the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> and its <b>spring</b> (and having half the number of pushrods of an OHV engine). With only one valve in the head, {{and one in the}} block, larger valves can be used than in an OHV engine, to offset the poorer airflow of a side <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve.</b>|$|R

50|$|Increased Valvetrain Friction and Wear: Because OHV engines {{generally}} {{use only}} a single intake and <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve,</b> the valves are larger and heavier than those used in multivalve OHC engines. Furthermore, when the valve is closed, the spring must accelerate not only the valve and rocker arm, but also the pushrod and lifter. Therefore, OHV engines must use heavier <b>valve</b> <b>springs</b> than OHC engines (multivalve or otherwise). As a result, valvetrain friction and wear is increased. This is especially true with high performance OHV engines utilizing high lift/duration/ramp rate cams with heavier than stock <b>valve</b> <b>springs.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{cast-iron}} {{heads were}} designed with hemispherical combustion chambers {{and a single}} overhead camshaft over each head, operating shaft-mounted roller rocker arms. The valvetrain consisted of valves larger than those on Ford wedge head engines, made out of stainless steel and with sodium-filled <b>exhaust</b> <b>valves</b> to prevent the valve heads from burning, and dual <b>valve</b> <b>springs.</b> This design allowed for high volumetric efficiency at high engine speed.|$|R
2500|$|Both inlet and <b>exhaust</b> <b>valves</b> {{were in the}} {{cylinder}} heads. The automatic inlet valves of earlier Anzani engines, opened by atmospheric pressure and closed by <b>valve</b> <b>springs</b> were retained, but fuel was fed from a mixing chamber in the crankcase via inlet tubes placed {{at the rear of}} the engine to avoid cooling of the mixture by the oncoming airflow. [...] This arrangement placed the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valves</b> at the front of the engine, where they were operated from a cam in the rear of the crankcase via push rods and rockers. [...] A single carburettor fed the crankcase chambers from below. [...] Some versions used a single Gibaud magneto, running at 3,000 rpm, though others built by British Anzani had a pair of Bosch magnetos, running slower. [...] Plugs (K.L.G. for the British variant) were mounted in the sides of {{the cylinder}} heads, sloping upwards to avoid plug fouling by lubricating oil. The exhaust was collected by a prominent pair of semi-circular manifolds.|$|R
25|$|Until the mid-1940s, the {{traditional}} horizontal four-stroke single-cylinder 500cc engines were fitted with one overhead and one side valve but {{contrary to the}} usual practice of having inlet over exhaust (IOE), this employed the side valve for induction and the overhead <b>valve</b> for <b>exhaust.</b> Also unusual was the adoption of only one hairspring (type of <b>valve</b> <b>spring)</b> to close the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve.</b> These were the highest performance engines Moto Guzzi sold to the general public.

50|$|Additional engine changes {{include a}} lighter {{camshaft}} sprocket and increased <b>valve</b> <b>spring</b> pressure (two <b>springs</b> per intake <b>valve)</b> which allow for higher revving. There are new piston rings that slide with less friction and increased internal engine oil flow. Redline is now 14,200 rpm, 700 rpm {{higher than the}} previous year's F4. To increase the bike's pulling capabilities at high speeds, 5th and 6th gears have been shortened slightly and the rear sprocket was enlarged from 45 teeth to 46.Also adding one clutch plate for greater durability to now making 8. The oiling holes in the camshafts have been enlarged by 0.5 mm (to 2.5 mm) and piston ring friction has been decreased to aid cooling at the higher rev ceiling. Spring pressures on the intake and <b>exhaust</b> <b>valves</b> have been increased to avoid valve float. Also, there are now two <b>valve</b> <b>springs</b> (inner and outer) on the intake side instead of the single item that resides on the exhaust side.|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{hot gases}} {{produced}} by the internal combustion engines passes through the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> and causes high temperatures in the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> and its seat. To avoid damaging the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve,</b> heat must be transferred from the valve to its seat during the contact they make at the opening and closing cycle. Heat transfer rate from the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> to its seat {{is a function of}} many factors. One of the most important factors is the thermal contact conductance (TCC) between the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> and its seat. Very few researches have been done about estimation of the TCC between the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> and its seat in the past. An experimental study has been conducted to determine the TCC between two co-axial cylinders, as the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> and its seat. Furthermore, the influence of contact pressure and frequency of contact upon the TCC is studied. The results show that the TCC decreases as the frequency of contact increases.

40|$|Abstract — The system aims at {{modifying the}} {{position}} and diameter of the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> {{in order to reduce}} the probability of knocking (both in SI and in CI) and lessen the dilution of charge because of the small size of <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> when compared to the size of inlet valve. The size of the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> is smaller when compared to the size of inlet valve. It is done so because the region closer to the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> is at a higher temperature compared to that of the temperature surrounding the inlet valve. Now if the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> size is increased there will be higher possibility of knocking because the charge coming inside the combustion chamber has a higher probability of combusting at <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve’s</b> surface (due to large surface area). On the other hand if the size is too small then, there will be greater possibility of dilution in the intake charge because there is no enough space for the burnt gas to leave the chamber. To reduce these problems, modifications in the engine is proposed. In general inlet and <b>exhaust</b> <b>valves</b> are positioned vertically along the axis of the combustion chamber. Now if the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> is placed along the horizontal axis (i. e. perpendicular to the cylinder axis) and if the size of the valve is increased then there will be less possibility for the dilution. But the probability of knocking increases. Since the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> is placed along the horizontal axis, the outer surface of the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> will be in contact with the water cooling system of the combustion chamber (outside the chamber). Thus this cooling system or the coolant will be able to release the heat at the outer surface of the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> and transfer heat from the seat surface of the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> (commonly in tappet valves). The rate of Heat Transfer will be high because the surface area perpendicular to heat flow direction is large thereby enhancing heat transfer. The possibility of the dilution is reduced because, during the piston movement from BDC (Bottom Dead Center) to the TDC (Top Dead Center) the piston pushes the burnt gases outside through the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> since the size of the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> is increased, it is easie...|$|R
50|$|In most {{types of}} {{reciprocating}} engines, a valve guide is provided for each poppet valve in the cylinder head. Along with the <b>valve</b> <b>spring,</b> it serves to positively locate the valve {{so that it}} may make proper contact with the valve seat. A valve guide is a cylindrical piece of metal, pressed or integrally cast into the cylinder head, with the valve reciprocating inside it. Guides also serve to conduct heat from the combustion process out from the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> and into the cylinder head where it may be {{taken up by the}} cooling system. Bronze is commonly used, as is steel; a balance between stiffness and wear on the valve is essential to achieve a useful service life.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. MAN Diesel’s 6 S 50 MC-C disel is a {{two-stroke}} {{marine diesel}} engine. Preload of the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> component is applied in four bolts.

40|$|In the {{automotive}} field {{during the last}} decade, owing primarily to increases in maximum engine speed and the almost universal use of overhead valve gear, increasing attention has been focused upon improper valve functioning which causes noisy operation, excessive <b>valve</b> <b>spring</b> surge, <b>valve</b> seat pounding, and <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> b h g. With the conventional design of cams no allowance is made for {{the flexibility of the}} push rod and rocker, consequently in general the accelerations imparted to the valve are much greater than is necessary at high speeds when inertia effects build up. A general mathematical analysis of the conventional three-arc cam is presented, introducing the terms “eccentricity ” and “instantaneous radius”, and this is followed by a similar analysis of the new cam profile using the ‘same terms, together with the method of correcting the cam profile for high-speed operation. It is also shown how the new general equations can be used to deduce a variable eccentricity ramp, the purpose of which is to take up clearance at variable velocity. The effects of the new cam profile on horse-power and thermal efficiency are shown; the effect of the acceleration characteristic on <b>valve</b> <b>spring</b> design also is illustrated, and a comparison shows the reduction in spring weight made possible by the elimination of <b>valve</b> <b>spring</b> surge...|$|R
50|$|Early/late <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> closingEarly {{and late}} <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> closing can also reduce emissions. Traditionally, the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> opens, and <b>exhaust</b> gas is {{pushed out of}} the {{cylinder}} and into the exhaust manifold by the piston as it travels upward. By manipulating {{the timing of the}} <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve,</b> engineers can control how much exhaust gas is left in the cylinder. By holding the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> open slightly longer, the cylinder is emptied more and ready to be filled with a bigger air/fuel charge on the intake stroke. By closing the valve slightly early, more exhaust gas remains in the cylinder which increases fuel efficiency. This allows for more efficient operation under all conditions.|$|R

25|$|Most {{internal}} combustion engines use a split collet to hold both the inlet and <b>exhaust</b> <b>valves</b> under constant <b>valve</b> <b>spring</b> pressure which returns the valves to their closed position when the camshaft lobes {{are not in}} contact with the top of the valves. The two collet halves have an internal raised rib which locate into a circular groove near the top of each valve stem, the outer side of the collet halves are a taper fit into the spring retainer (also known as a collar), this taper locks the retainer in place and the raised rib that sits in the circular groove on the valve stem also locks the collet halves in place to the valve stem. To remove the valves from a cylinder head a 'valve spring compressor' is used to compress the <b>valve</b> <b>springs</b> by exerting force on the spring retainer which allows the collets to be removed, when the compressor is removed, the retainer, <b>spring</b> and <b>valve</b> can then be removed from the cylinder head. It may be realized that the retainer does not budge when the <b>valve</b> <b>spring</b> compressor is used, this is due to a buildup of carbon which over time has locked the retainer and collets slightly. A slight sharp tap on the backside of the <b>valve</b> <b>spring</b> compressor above the valve stem should free the retainer allowing the springs to be compressed whilst retrieving the split collet. On reassembly it is difficult to keep the split collets in place whilst the compressor is released, by applying a small amount of grease to the internal side of the split collets will keep them in place on the valve stem whilst releasing the compressor, then as the spring retainer rises it locks the tapered split collets in place.|$|R
