Many civilians have died and {{large parts of the}} infrastructure in this region were destroyed.|$|E
5|$|In 2014, Jordan joined {{an aerial}} {{bombardment}} campaign {{by an international}} coalition led by the United States against the Islamic State {{as part of its}} intervention in the Syrian Civil War. In 2015, Jordan participated in the Saudi Arabian-led military intervention in Yemen against the Shia <b>Houthis</b> and forces loyal to former President Ali Abdullah Saleh, who was deposed in the 2011 uprising.|$|E
25|$|On 14 April, the United Nations Security Council {{adopted a}} {{resolution}} placing sanctions on Abdul-Malik al-Houthi and Ahmed Ali Saleh, establishing an arms embargo on the <b>Houthis,</b> and {{calling on the}} <b>Houthis</b> to quit Sana'a and other areas they seized. The <b>Houthis</b> condemned the UN resolution and called for mass protests.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Houthis</b> {{have urged}} their {{supporters}} in northern Yemen {{to support the}} Syrian government. A defecting Syrian air-force brigadier alleged that the <b>Houthis</b> supplied 200 fighters {{to participate in the}} Siege of Maarat al-Numaan and the Jisr al-Shughur operation. Many <b>Houthis</b> were reported to be fighting {{on the side of the}} government.|$|E
25|$|Both sides, however, {{claimed that}} neither side laid down arms. The <b>Houthis</b> {{asserted}} that the government continued air and rocket attacks while the government claimed the <b>Houthis</b> launched attacks in the Amran and Saada provinces. A Human Rights Watch report noted how the <b>Houthis</b> attacked the village of Mudaqqa on 16 September, prompting a government response in shelling.|$|E
25|$|Currently {{the most}} {{prominent}} Zaydi movement is <b>Houthis</b> movement, known {{by the name of}} Shabab Al Mu'mineen (Believing Youth) or AnsarAllah (Partisans of God). In 2014–2015 <b>Houthis</b> took over the government in Sana'a, which led to the fall of the Saudi Arabian-backed government of Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi. <b>Houthis</b> and their allies gained control of a significant part of Yemen's territory and were resisting the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen seeking to restore Hadi in power. Both the <b>Houthis</b> and the Saudi Arabian-led coalition were being attacked by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant.|$|E
25|$|In the {{province}} of Ma'rib, six members of Sunni tribes were killed during fighting against <b>Houthis</b> on 22 March. The next day, 15 <b>Houthis</b> and 5 tribesmen were killed in clashes in the Al Bayda Governorate.|$|E
25|$|In the Lahij Governorate, heavy {{fighting}} erupted between <b>Houthis</b> and pro-Hadi fighters on 24 March. The next day, Al Anad Air Base, 60 kilometers from Aden, {{was captured by}} the <b>Houthis</b> and their allies. The base had recently been abandoned by United States of America US SOCOM troops. Defence Minister Mahmoud al-Subaihi, one of Hadi's top lieutenants, was captured by the <b>Houthis</b> in Al Houta and transferred to Sana'a. Houthi fighters also advanced to Dar Saad, a small town, 20km north of Aden.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Houthis</b> boycotted a single-candidate {{election}} in early 2012 meant to give Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi a two-year term of office. They {{participated in a}} National Dialogue Conference, but withheld support from a final accord in early 2014 that extended Hadi's mandate in office for another year. Meanwhile, {{the conflict between the}} <b>Houthis</b> and Sunni tribes in northern Yemen spread to other governorates, including the Sana'a Governorate by mid-2014. After several weeks of street protests against the Hadi administration, which made cuts to fuel subsidies that were unpopular with the group, the <b>Houthis</b> came to blows with Yemen Army forces under the command of General Ali Mohsen al-Ahmar. In a battle that lasted only a few days, Houthi fighters seized control of Sana'a, the Yemeni capital, in September 2014. The <b>Houthis</b> forced Hadi to negotiate an agreement to end the violence, in which the government resigned and the <b>Houthis</b> gained an unprecedented level of influence over state institutions and politics.|$|E
25|$|The {{conflict}} took on {{an international}} dimension in late October 2009 with clashes reported between the <b>Houthis</b> and Saudi security forces near the border. Since {{the beginning of the}} operation, the <b>Houthis</b> accused Saudi Arabia of supporting the Yemeni government and conducting bombing raids into Yemen. Prior to this, Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh held talks in the Moroccan city of Agadir with Saudi Crown Prince Sultan bin Abdul Aziz Al Saud and King Abdullah II of Jordan. Saudi Arabia, Jordan, and Morocco would later play roles in the fight against the <b>Houthis.</b> Morocco, which had severed ties with Iran in March of that year, noted that Tehran's alleged backing of the <b>Houthis</b> helped in the decision to later send troops.|$|E
25|$|On 12 February, the <b>Houthis</b> {{accepted}} the government's ceasefire proposal.|$|E
25|$|A Yemeni General {{claimed the}} <b>Houthis</b> {{violated}} the ceasefire on 12 February, claiming that four {{soldiers were killed}} in two districts while adding that {{an attempt was made}} to assassinate him. The <b>Houthis</b> denied responsibility for this attack. As the remainder of February progressed, it became clear that fighting had ceased. By the 25th, reports indicated that the <b>Houthis,</b> under conditions that they remain masked and not followed by security, left their final positions in northern Saada City. Yemeni engineers followed in afterward to clear homes of mines and booby traps. A United Nations team, including a representative of the UNHCR, were finally allowed into Saada City and surrounding refugee camps in April 2010.|$|E
25|$|Fighting also {{centered}} on the Shabwa Province, in the oil-rich Usaylan region, where Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) and Ansar al-Sharia hold sway. On 29 March, 38 were killed in fighting between the <b>Houthis</b> and Sunni tribesmen. Tribal sources confirmed the death toll, and claimed only eight of them were from their side, with the other 30 either <b>Houthis</b> or their allies from the Yemeni military.|$|E
25|$|In March 2015, the OIC {{announced}} {{its support for}} the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen against the Shia <b>Houthis.</b>|$|E
25|$|On 13 April 2015, Southern militia {{said they}} {{took control of}} the army base loyal to the <b>Houthis</b> near Balhaf.|$|E
25|$|On July 22, 2017 The <b>Houthis</b> {{and forces}} loyal to Ali Abdullah Saleh {{launched}} a retaliation missile (called Volcano H-2) on Saudi Arabia targeting the oil refineries in the Yanbu Province of Saudi Arabia. <b>Houthis</b> and Ali Saleh media {{have claimed that}} the missile hit its target causing a major fire, while Saudi Arabia has claimed that {{it was due to}} the extreme heat that caused one of the generators to blow up.|$|E
25|$|Armed tribesmen {{drove off}} <b>Houthis</b> who {{had set up}} a {{makeshift}} camp in southern Ibb Governorate and seized their weapons on 7 April. Between 17 and 18 April, at least 30 people were killed when the <b>Houthis</b> and allied army units attacked a pro-Hadi military base in Taiz. The dead included 8–16 pro-Hadi and 14–19 Houthi fighters, as well as three civilians. Another report put the number of dead at 85. On the morning of 19 April, 10 more Houthi and four pro-Hadi fighters were killed.|$|E
25|$|In March 2015, Erdoğan {{said that}} Turkey {{supported}} the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen against the Shia <b>Houthis</b> and forces loyal to former President Ali Abdullah Saleh.|$|E
25|$|In Egypt, the Yemeni foreign {{minister}} {{called for an}} Arab League military intervention against the <b>Houthis.</b> Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi floated {{the idea of a}} unified military force.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} evening, Saudi Arabia began {{a military}} intervention alongside eight other Arab states {{and with the}} logistical support of the United States against the <b>Houthis,</b> bombing positions throughout Sana'a. In a joint statement, {{the nations of the}} Gulf Cooperation Council (with the exception of Oman) said they decided to intervene against the <b>Houthis</b> in Yemen at the request of Hadi's government. King Salman of Saudi Arabia declared the Royal Saudi Air Force to be in full control of Yemeni airspace within hours of the operation beginning. The airstrikes were aimed at hindering the Houthis' advance toward Hadi's stronghold in southern Yemen.|$|E
25|$|The {{withdrawal}} of the <b>Houthis</b> and forces loyal to deposed president Ali Abdullah Saleh from all Yemeni cities {{and the return of}} military hardware and munitions seized from the Yemeni Army.|$|E
25|$|October {{was also}} the month where Somali forces joined the {{fighting}} alongside the <b>Houthis.</b> Some 200 Somali recruits arrived on boats via the Red Sea and were mainly sent on suicide missions against government and military targets in Saada City. Yemen would later claim to have captured 28 Somali troops. Other sources indicated that Somali fighters were used for engineering methods, primarily by digging trenches to hide ammunition and launch ambushes from the mountains. By December, a Somali diplomat claimed that many Somali refugees suffered abduction by the <b>Houthis</b> as they fled into Saudi Arabia. Those who refused faced execution.|$|E
25|$|The Saudi-led {{military}} {{coalition and}} <b>Houthis</b> (Ansar Allah) {{arrived at a}} swift ceasefire agreement effective 17 November 2016, {{as a result of}} efforts of U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Omani dignitaries.|$|E
25|$|On 13 November, the Iranian group Society of Seminary Teachers of Qom {{denounced the}} Yemeni and Saudi offensives against the <b>Houthis.</b> Two days later, Iranian Speaker of Parliament Ali Larijani accused the United States of {{cooperating}} with the Saudi campaign. A few days later, Iran announced plans to send warships to the Gulf of Aden {{as a means to}} protect routes against Somali pirates. This move coincided with the Saudi naval blockade in the Red Sea to stop arms shipments allegedly from Tehran and Eritrea to the <b>Houthis.</b> Three Saudi warships with marine commandos from the Yanbu naval base patrolled the waters off the coast of northern Yemen.|$|E
25|$|On 25 March 2015, Saudi Arabia, spearheading a {{coalition}} of Sunni Muslim states, started a military intervention in Yemen against the Shia <b>Houthis</b> and forces loyal to former President Ali Abdullah Saleh, who was deposed in the 2011 Arab Spring uprisings.|$|E
25|$|Clashes {{broke out}} {{once more in}} the Amran {{governorate}} and the Malahidh border area. <b>Houthis</b> had dug trenches and laid landmines besieging over a hundred Yemeni soldiers. Yemeni forces managed to break free and retreat, but lost ten soldiers to Houthi snipers.|$|E
25|$|On 27 March 2015, the USS Sterret {{took part}} in the air-sea rescue that {{successfully}} recovered the pilots of two F-15 fighter jet that may have been part of Operation Decisive Storm, the Saudi Arabian-led multilateral air campaign against <b>Houthis</b> forces in Yemen.|$|E
25|$|Although the <b>Houthis</b> {{took control}} of Lahij {{on the road to}} Aden, {{resistance}} continued in the Lahij Governorate. Ambushes and bombings struck Houthi supply lines to the Aden front, with a landmine killing a reported 25 Houthi fighters on their way to Aden on 28 March.|$|E
25|$|In 2015, UAE {{participated in}} the Saudi Arabian-led {{military}} intervention in Yemen against the Shia <b>Houthis</b> and forces loyal to former President Ali Abdullah Saleh, who was deposed in the 2011 uprising. UAE has been secretly buying foreign weapons and American F-16 through offset payments which were channelled to DC thinktanks such as Middle East Institute.|$|E
25|$|In a {{televised}} address on 24 April, Saleh {{called on the}} <b>Houthis</b> and other armed groups {{to withdraw from the}} territory they had seized and participate in UN-sponsored peace talks, in exchange {{for an end to the}} air campaign. Exiled Yemeni Foreign Minister rejected the peace proposal saying that Saleh had no role in the talks.|$|E
25|$|According to Farea Al-Muslim, direct {{war crimes}} have been {{committed}} during the conflict; for example, an IDP camp {{was hit by a}} Saudi airstrike, while <b>Houthis</b> have sometimes prevented aid workers from giving aid. The UN and several major human rights groups discussed the possibility that war crimes may {{have been committed}} by Saudi Arabia during the air campaign.|$|E
25|$|A five-day ceasefire {{proposed}} by Saudi Arabia {{was accepted by}} the <b>Houthis</b> and their allies in the military on 10 May 2015. The ceasefire was intended to allow the delivery of humanitarian aid to the country. The temporary truce began {{on the night of}} 12 May to allow the delivery of food, water, medical, and fuel aid throughout the country.|$|E
25|$|Ansar Allah (sometimes Anglicised as Ansarullah), known popularly as the <b>Houthis,</b> a Zaidi {{group with}} {{its origins in}} the mountainous Sa'dah Governorate on Yemen's {{northern}} border with Saudi Arabia, began waging a low-level insurgency against the Yemeni government in 2004. The intensity of the conflict waxed and waned {{over the course of}} the 2000s, with multiple peace agreements being negotiated and later disregarded. The Houthi insurgency heated up in 2009, briefly drawing in neighbouring Saudi Arabia on the side of the Yemeni government, but quieted the following year after a ceasefire was signed. During the early stages of the Yemeni Revolution in 2011, Houthi leader Abdul-Malik al-Houthi declared the group's support for demonstrations calling for the resignation of President Ali Abdullah Saleh. Later in the year, as Saleh prepared to leave office, the <b>Houthis</b> laid siege to the Sunni-majority village of Dammaj in northern Yemen, a step toward attaining virtual autonomy for Sa'dah.|$|E
25|$|Houthi forces {{backed by}} troops loyal to Saleh entered Taiz, Yemen's third-largest city, on 22 March and quickly took over key {{points in the}} city. They {{encountered}} little resistance, although one protester was shot dead and five more were injured. Western media outlets began to suggest Yemen was sliding into civil war as the <b>Houthis</b> from the north confronted holdouts in the south.|$|E
25|$|On March 21, 2016, a {{group of}} 19 Yemenite Jews were flown to Israel in a secret operation, leaving the {{population}} at about 50. In April 2017, {{it was reported that}} 40 of the last 50 Jews were in an enclave next to the American Embassy in Sana'a, and they were subject to threats of ethnic cleansing by the <b>Houthis.</b>|$|E
25|$|On 6 February, the <b>Houthis</b> renewed {{their attacks}} against the Yemeni government, killing 15 Yemeni {{soldiers}} in an ambush in Wadi al-Jabara district and killing 8 soldiers during street battles in Sa'dah city that day. Saudi air raids that day destroyed four civilian residences and injured two women. The Saudi military fired 174 rockets and mortars at the rebel controlled al-Dhaher, Qamamat, Ghafereh, al-Rammadiat and Shada districts.|$|E
