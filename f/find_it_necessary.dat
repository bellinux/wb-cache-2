5|$|Koht's role in {{the weak}} and unorganised defense against Operation Weserübung was debated {{during and after the}} occupation. After the World War, a {{commission}} named Undersøkelseskommisjonen av 1945 ("Scrutiny Commission of 1945") was set to scrutinise the actions of the Norwegian government in 1940. It concluded with a partial criticism of Koht's dispositions. After receiving Undersøkelseskommisjonen analysis, Koht volunteered to undergo an Impeachment trial. The Parliament of Norway did not <b>find</b> <b>it</b> <b>necessary,</b> and no such trial took place.|$|E

25|$|There is however a {{disconnection}} {{between these}} laws and everyday life experiences, {{as we do}} not <b>find</b> <b>it</b> <b>necessary</b> (nor even theoretically possible) to know exactly at a microscopic level the simultaneous positions and velocities of each molecule while carrying out processes at the human scale (for example, when performing a chemical reaction). Statistical mechanics fills this disconnection between the laws of mechanics and the practical experience of incomplete knowledge, by adding some uncertainty about which state the system is in.|$|E

25|$|Carotenoids may absorb {{solar energy}} and convert it to ATP, {{the first example}} of photoheterotrophy in animals. The {{carotene}} pigments in aphids form a layer {{close to the surface}} of the cuticle, where it is ideally placed to absorb sunlight. The excited carotenoids seem to reduce NAD to NADH which can then be oxidized in the mitochondria for energy. It is unclear why aphids should <b>find</b> <b>it</b> <b>necessary</b> to develop this source of energy when their diet provides them with an excess of sugars.|$|E
25|$|The {{argument}} from simplicity {{is probably the}} simplest and also {{the most common form}} of argument against dualism of the mental. The dualist is always faced with the question of why anyone should <b>find</b> <b>it</b> <b>necessary</b> to believe in the existence of two, ontologically distinct, entities (mind and brain), when it seems possible and would make for a simpler thesis to test against scientific evidence, to explain the same events and properties in terms of one. It is a heuristic principle in science and philosophy not to assume the existence of more entities than is necessary for clear explanation and prediction (see Occam's razor).|$|E
25|$|Openly {{transsexual}} {{people can}} have difficulty maintaining employment. Most <b>find</b> <b>it</b> <b>necessary</b> to remain employed during transition in order {{to cover the costs}} of living and transition. However, employment discrimination against trans people is rampant {{and many of them are}} fired when they come out or are involuntarily outed at work. Transsexual people must decide whether to transition on-the-job, or to find a new job when they make their social transition. Other stresses that transsexual people face in the workplace are being fearful of coworkers negatively responding to their transition, and losing job experience under a previous name—even deciding which rest room to use can prove challenging. Finding employment can be especially challenging for those in mid-transition.|$|E

25|$|The German Navy was for Germany mainly an {{instrument}} for putting political pressure on Britain. Before the war, Germany would {{have been willing to}} cease or moderate its naval competition with Britain but only in return for a promise of its neutrality in any European conflict. Hitler attempted the same thing by different methods, but he saw only one side of the picture like other German politicians. It is clear from his writings that he was enormously impressed with the part played by the prewar naval rivalry in creating bad {{relations between the two countries}}. Thus, he argued that the removal of this rivalry all that was necessary to obtain good relations. By making a free gift of an absence of naval competition, he hoped that relations between the two countries would be so improved that Britain should not, in fact, <b>find</b> <b>it</b> <b>necessary</b> to interfere with Germany's continental policy.|$|E
25|$|The Court's assumptions, some say, {{have made}} the Mackay Radio ruling {{theoretically}} unsupportable {{as a matter of}} equity. Because the Court assumed that employers must hire permanent replacements as a matter of business necessity, the Court did not <b>find</b> <b>it</b> <b>necessary</b> to require the employer to show the need for permanent replacements. This places the burden on either the Board or unions to prove that the employer had an anti-union animus. But the Supreme Court subsequently held that replacement workers cannot be presumed to be anti-union, so their use is not enough to show animus. Indeed, courts have been reluctant to find support for anti-union animus in any except the most extreme cases. As legal scholars point out, under Mackay Radio, employers can now cloak anti-union animus under the guise of using permanent replacements. They note that it is becoming increasingly common for employers to deunionize using permanent replacements, and nearly impossible for unions to obtain legal redress. This has held to a radical shift in American labor policy which Congress did not intend.|$|E
500|$|After {{a frantic}} rescue effort, Monitor finally foundered and sank {{approximately}} [...] southeast off Cape Hatteras {{with the loss}} of sixteen men, including four officers, some of whom remained in the turret and went down with the ironclad. [...] Forty-seven men were rescued by the life boats from Rhode Island. Bankhead, Green and Stodder barely managed to get clear of the sinking vessel and survived the ordeal but suffered from exposure from the icy winter sea. After his initial recovery, Bankhead filed his official report, as did the commanding officers of the Rhode Island, stating officers and men of both Monitor and Rhode Island did everything within their ability to keep Monitor from sinking. The Navy did not <b>find</b> <b>it</b> <b>necessary</b> to commission a board of inquiry to investigate the affair and took no action against Bankhead or any of his officers.|$|E

500|$|The Historic Buildings and Monuments Commission for England (popularly {{referred}} to as [...] "English Heritage") argues that the battle was named after Market Bosworth because the town was the nearest significant settlement to the battlefield in the 15th century. As explored by Professor Philip Morgan, a battle might initially not be named specifically at all. As time passes, writers of administrative and historical records <b>find</b> <b>it</b> <b>necessary</b> to identify a notable battle, ascribing it a name that is usually toponymical in nature and sourced from combatants or observers. This official name becomes accepted by society and future generations without question. [...] Early records associated the Battle of Bosworth with [...] "Brownehethe", [...] "bellum Miravallenses", [...] "Sandeford" [...] and [...] "Dadlyngton field". [...] The earliest record, a municipal memorandum of 23 August 1485 from York, locates the battle [...] "on the field of Redemore". [...] This is corroborated by a 1485–86 letter that mentions [...] "Redesmore" [...] as its site. [...] According to historian Peter Foss, records did not associate the battle with [...] "Bosworth" [...] until 1510.|$|E
500|$|AVCO Embassy Pictures, the film's {{financial}} backer, preferred either Charles Bronson or Tommy Lee Jones to {{play the}} role of Snake Plissken to Carpenter's choice of Kurt Russell, who was trying to overcome the [...] "lightweight" [...] screen image conveyed by his roles in several Disney comedies. Carpenter refused to cast Bronson on the grounds that he was too old, and because he worried that he could lose directorial control over the picture with an experienced actor. At the time, Russell described his character as [...] "a mercenary, and his style of fighting is a combination of Bruce Lee, The Exterminator, and Darth Vader, with Eastwood's vocal-ness." [...] All that matters to Snake, according to the actor, is [...] "the next 60 seconds. Living for exactly that next minute is all there is." [...] Russell used a rigorous diet and exercise program in order to develop a lean and muscular build. He also endeavored to stay in character between takes and throughout the shooting, as he welcomed the opportunity to get away from the Disney comedies he had done previously. He did <b>find</b> <b>it</b> <b>necessary</b> to remove the eyepatch between takes, as wearing it constantly seriously affected his depth perception.|$|E
