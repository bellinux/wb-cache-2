50|$|The <b>Guyanese</b> <b>dollar</b> (currency sign: $, G$ and GY$; ISO: GYD) {{has been}} the unit of account in Guyana (formerly British Guiana) since 29 January 1839. Originally it was {{intended}} as a transitional unit to facilitate the changeover from the Dutch guilder system of currency to the British pound sterling system. The Spanish dollar was already prevalent throughout the West Indies in general, and from 1839, the Spanish dollar unit operated in British Guiana in conjunction with British sterling coins at a standard conversion rate of one dollar for every four shillings and twopence. In 1951 the British sterling coinage was replaced with a new decimal coinage which was simultaneously introduced through all the British territories in the Eastern Caribbean. When sterling began to depreciate in the early 1970s, a switch to a US dollar peg became increasingly attractive as an anti-inflationary measure and the Eastern Caribbean Currency Authority (of which Guyana was a member) made the switch in October 1975. The <b>Guyanese</b> <b>dollar</b> is normally abbreviated with the dollar sign $, or alternatively G$ to distinguish it from other dollar-denominated currencies.|$|E
5000|$|Paper money {{production}} {{specifically for}} British Guiana ceased in 1942 and local notes {{were replaced by}} BWI$ notes in 1951. In 1955, the BWI$ was decimalized and coinage was issued {{in the name of}} the [...] "British Caribbean Territories, Eastern Group". In 1965, the East Caribbean dollar (EC$) replaced the BWI$ and circulated in British Guiana for a year until, following independence in 1966, the <b>Guyanese</b> <b>dollar</b> was introduced, replacing the East Caribbean dollar at par.|$|E
50|$|The main {{transport}} route between Aishalton and the Guyana coastlands (the most populated region of Guyana, {{and the home}} of the country's capital, Georgetown) is the unpaved Linden-Lethem Road. From Lethem, travelers use private vehicles to traverse the 180 km dirt track between Lethem and Aishalton. Up until 2008, the Rupununi River Bridge at Katoonarib afforded a crossing-point between Aishalton and Lethem. In 2008 however, the bridge—which cost 16 million <b>Guyanese</b> <b>dollars</b> to construct—collapsed. In the 1990s an Airplane landing strip was built in Aishalton. The IATA airport code of the Aishalton Airstrip is AHL.|$|R
50|$|The law {{provides}} {{for freedom of}} speech including {{for members of the}} press, and the government generally respects this right in practice. Government officials use libel laws to suppress criticism. A hearing into a 10 million <b>Guyanese</b> <b>dollars</b> ($50,000) libel suit filed by former President Jagdeo in July 2010 against the Kaieteur News publishers, its editor in chief, and one of its columnists began in August 2011 and remained pending at the end of 2012. The law prohibits arbitrary interference with privacy, family, home, or correspondence, and the government generally respects these prohibitions in practice. A 2008 law allows for the interception of communications through a warrant issued by a judge, exceptions being {{in the case of a}} national emergency or where approval for a warrant is impracticable due to the urgency of the matter.|$|R
5000|$|British Guiana, renamed Guyana on {{independence}} in 1966, {{was the only}} one of the territories in the British West Indies to use dollar accounts in both the public and private sectors throughout the period 1839 to 1950. Although sterling coinage circulated during this period, it did so in conjunction with the Spanish dollar unit of account at the fixed rate of $1 = 4s 2d. Another feature of interest that was exclusive to British Guiana was the special issue four pence (4d) coin known as the groat. (See the main article at <b>Guyanese</b> <b>dollar.)</b> ...|$|E
50|$|Lethem {{is part of}} the Guyanese Rupununi savannah {{where there}} are many vaqueiros (as spoken in the Portuguese language), or cowboys, and ranches. Local flora/fauna {{includes}} various types of cashew trees, both the fruit and nut varieties; mango trees and Coconut trees are also common. There is a cashew processing plant in St. Ignatius, one of the communities that are a part Lethem. There is also Culvert City, and New Culvert City, and there are several retail establishments throughout the township of Lethem. The <b>Guyanese</b> <b>Dollar</b> and, the Brazilian Reals, and in some stores, even U.S. currency is now accepted by merchants.|$|E
5000|$|The {{history of}} the <b>Guyanese</b> <b>dollar</b> should not be {{considered}} in isolation of the wider picture surrounding the history of currency in the British West Indies as a whole. ( [...] See Currencies of the British West Indies [...] ). The aspects of that history that are peculiar to British Guiana are the continued use of the four pence groat coin when all other territories had abandoned it, and also the use of dollar accounts in both {{the public and private sectors}} since 1839. In the other Eastern Caribbean territories, there was a mixture of dollar and sterling accounts until the year 1951.|$|E
50|$|In the 1830s, {{the colonies}} issued paper money {{denominated}} in joes and guilders. There were notes of 1, 2, 3 and 10 joes (22, 44, 66 and 220 guilders). It wasn’t until 1916 that the Government of British Guiana begin issuing dollar-denominated banknotes. Banknotes produced specifically for British Guiana ceased in 1942, and {{were replaced by}} British West Indies dollars in 1951. In 1955, the British West Indies dollar was decimalized and issued {{in the name of}} the British Caribbean Territories, Eastern Group. In 1965, the East Caribbean dollar replaced the British West Indies dollar and circulated in British Guiana for a year until, following independence in 1966, the <b>Guyanese</b> <b>dollar</b> was introduced, replacing the East Caribbean dollar at par.|$|E
50|$|During this period, {{and into}} the nineteenth century, {{accounts}} could be kept in either dollars or sterling. Jamaica, Bermuda, and the Bahamas preferred to use sterling accounts whereas British Guiana used dollar accounts. British Guiana used dollar accounts {{for the purpose of}} assisting in the transition from the Dutch guilder system of currency to the British pound sterling system. In the Eastern Caribbean territories the private sector preferred to use dollar accounts whereas the government preferred to use sterling accounts. In some of the Eastern Caribbean territories, notes were issued by various private banks, denominated in dollars equivalent to 4 shillings 2 pence.

5000|$|The Eastern Caribbean group {{comprised}} Trinidad and Tobago, Barbados, the Windward Islands, and the Leeward Islands. These territories {{all used}} sterling coinage {{in conjunction with}} a mixture of sterling accounts and Spanish dollar accounts. The private banking sector tended to use Spanish dollar accounts at the fixed exchange rate of $1 = 4s 2d. The Eastern Caribbean group formed a monetary union with British Guiana in 1949 and the currency was known as the British West Indies dollar. Trinidad and Tobago left the arrangement in 1964. A new arrangement came about the following year and the currency was renamed the Eastern Caribbean dollar. British Guiana withdrew from this monetary union in 1966 and Barbados withdrew in 1972.

50|$|A second {{imperial}} order-in-council {{was passed}} in 1838 with the correct rating of $1 = 4shillings 2pence. In the years following the 1838 order-in-council, the British West Indies territories began to enact local legislation {{for the purposes of}} assimilating their monies of account with the British pound sterling. Gold discoveries in Australia in 1851 drove the silver dollar out of the West Indies, but it returned again with the great depreciation in the value of silver that followed with Germany's transition to the gold standard between 1871 and 1873. In the years immediately following 1873, there was a fear that the British West Indies might return to a silver standard. As such, legislation {{was passed in}} the individual territories to demonetize the silver dollars. Even though the British coinage was also silver, it represented fractions of the gold sovereign and so its value was based on a gold standard. During this period, and into the nineteenth century, accounts could be kept in either dollars or sterling. Jamaica, Bermuda, and the Bahamas preferred to use sterling accounts whereas British Guiana used dollar accounts. British Guiana used dollar accounts for the purpose of assisting in the transition from the Dutch guilder system of currency to the British pound sterling system.
