Inscriptions mention guilds of weavers, oilmen, artisans, basket and mat makers and fruit sellers. A Saundatti inscription refers to an assemblage {{of all the people}} of a district headed by the guilds of the region. Some guilds were considered superior to others, just as some corporations were, and received royal charters determining their powers and privileges. Inscriptions suggest these guilds had their own militia to protect <b>goods</b> <b>in</b> <b>transit</b> and, like village assemblies, they operated banks that lent money to traders and businesses.|$|E

Taxes on commodities (gold, precious stones, perfumes, sandalwood, ropes, yarn, housing, hearths, shops, cattle pans, sugarcane presses) as well as produce [...] (black pepper, betel leaves, ghee, paddy, spices, palm leaves, coconuts, sugar) are noted in village records. The village assembly could levy a tax for a specific purpose such as construction of a water tank.|$|E

500|$|The government, {{at higher}} levels, was closely {{modelled}} after the Magadhan and Satavahana administrative machinery. The empire {{was divided into}} Maharashtrakas (provinces), then into smaller Rashtrakas (Mandala), Vishaya (district), Bhoga (group of 10 villages) {{which is similar to}} the Dasagrama unit used by the Kadambas. At the lower levels of administration, the Kadamba style prevailed fully. The Sanjan plates of VikramadityaI even mentions a land unit called Dasagrama. In addition to imperial provinces, there were autonomous regions ruled by feudatories such as the Alupas, the Gangas, the Banas and the Sendrakas. Local assemblies and guilds looked after local issues. Groups of mahajanas (learned brahmins) looked after agraharas (called ghatika or [...] "place of higher learning") such as at Badami which was served by 2000 mahajans and Aihole which was served by 500 mahajanas. Taxes were levied and were called the herjunka– tax on loads, the kirukula– tax on retail <b>goods</b> <b>in</b> <b>transit,</b> the bilkode– sales tax, the pannaya– betel tax, siddaya– land tax and the vaddaravula– tax levied to support royalty.|$|E
2500|$|Krugman later praised his PhD thesis advisor, Rudi Dornbusch, as [...] "one of {{the great}} {{economics}} teachers of all time" [...] {{and said that he}} [...] "had the knack of inspiring students to pick up his enthusiasm and technique, but find their own paths". In 1978, Krugman presented a number of ideas to Dornbusch, who flagged as interesting the idea of a monopolistically competitive trade model. Encouraged, Krugman worked on it and later wrote, [...] " [...] knew within a few hours that I had the key to my whole career in hand". In that same year, Krugman wrote [...] "The Theory of Interstellar Trade", a tongue-in-cheek essay on computing interest rates on <b>goods</b> <b>in</b> <b>transit</b> near the speed of light.

2500|$|Approximately every [...] - {{a typical}} day's journey for an ox-drawn wagon - was a mansio (literally: [...] "a sojourn", from which derive the English word [...] "mansion" [...] and French maison or [...] "house"). This was a {{full-scale}} wayside inn, with large stables, tavern, rooms for travellers and even bath-houses {{in the larger}} establishments. Mansiones also housed detachments of troops, primarily auxiliaries, which regularly garrisoned and patrolled the roads along their whole length. These would check the identities, travel permits and cargoes of road users. Mansiones may also have housed the agents of the imperial procurator (the chief financial officer in the province) who collected the portorium, an imperial toll on <b>goods</b> <b>in</b> <b>transit</b> on public roads that was charged at 2% - 2.5% of the value. The tax would be exacted when the goods crossed fixed toll points along the roads, which likely were located in or near mansiones. At {{least half a dozen}} sites have been positively identified as mansiones in Britain. e.g. the excavated mansio at Godmanchester (Durovigutum) on Ermine Street (near Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire).|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{concept of}} risk under sea {{carriage}} {{is an important}} subject under sales law. This {{due to the fact}} that when goods are handed over from the seller to a carrier, neither the seller nor the buyer has physical control over the <b>goods</b> while <b>in</b> <b>transit</b> Risk under sales law deals with who bears the risk of goods damaged or loss without fault on the part of the parties to the sales contract. Risk under the sea carriage therefore has to do with who bears the ultimate responsibility in circumstances of loss or damage to the <b>goods</b> while <b>in</b> <b>transit.</b> Usually the parties under the sales contract contemplate on insurance to cover such losses. However, it is important to establish whether it is the seller or the buyer who has a claim against the carrier or insurer. I chose the concept of risk under sea carriage because coming from a developing country where raw materials are exported and finished products imported, trade is vital to the economic growth of the country. As bulk cargoes are mainly transported by sea, risk under sea carriage cannot be overlooked. Therefore, it is important to understand how trade partners allocate risk among themselves especially after each has fulfilled his contractual obligation and a carrier who is not a party to the transaction has to convey the goods to the buyer. To get a clear understanding of the concept of risk under sea carriage, I chose to look at the transaction based on a contract where the seller has to get the goods, arrange for the transport and insurance (CIF) and found out that the contract of sale, finance, contract of carriage and contract of insurance are inter-dependant in an international trade transaction...|$|R
50|$|There are {{a number}} of {{planning}} and design approaches to redressing automobile dependency, known variously as New Urbanism, Transit-oriented development, and Smart growth.

50|$|This term is broadly {{similar to}} the above CFR term, with the {{exception}} that the seller is required to obtain insurance for the <b>goods</b> while <b>in</b> <b>transit</b> to the named port of destination. CIF requires the seller to insure the goods for 110% of their value under at least the minimum cover of the Institute Cargo Clauses of the Institute of London Underwriters (which would be Institute Cargo Clauses (C)), or any similar set of clauses. The policy {{should be in the}} same currency as the contract. The seller must also turn over documents necessary, to obtain the goods from the carrier or to assert claim against an insurer to the buyer. The documents include (as a minimum) the invoice, the insurance policy, and the bill of lading. These three documents represent the cost, insurance, and freight of CIF. The seller's obligation ends when the documents are handed over to the buyer. Then, the buyer has to pay at the agreed price. Another point to consider is that CIF should only be used for non-containerized seafreight; for all other modes of transport it should be replaced with CIP.|$|R
40|$|The study {{presents}} an analytical framework {{to explore the}} rail-road collaborative paradigm. ^ New collaborative technologies have been developed {{in recent years and}} they offer a potential solutions and opportunities for collaboration among all modes of transportation. The most progressive technologies that could fulfill the gap in rail-road collaborative paradigm are identified and presented in this research. ^ The research deals with current state and possible development of collaboration of rail and highway modes of transportation, referred to as rail-road collaboration. Multimodal transportation is the shipment of <b>goods</b> <b>in</b> a single transportation unit. The longest part of the route takes place by rail, inland waterway or sea without handling the goods themselves and for a collection or a final delivery highway mode of transportation is usually used. ^ The main factor for the creation of efficient multimodal transportation network is an appropriate location of multimodal facilities and effective routing through existing transportation network with focus on minimizing the operational costs. The review of developed mathematical models related to this issue is part of this research. The developed models help to determine the internal costs of intermodal collaboration on a freight transportation network. The internal costs consist of operational costs incurred by transportation and intermodal facility operators. These models were not considering time-dependent costs of <b>goods</b> tied <b>in</b> <b>transit.</b> A case study of developed models is applied to sample networks. The dependency of total cost performance on level of collaboration is discussed in sensitivity analysis. ...|$|R
