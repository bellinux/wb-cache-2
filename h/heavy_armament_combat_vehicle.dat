50|$|On 4 June 2004, BAE Systems outbid General Dynamics for Alvis Vickers, the UK's main {{manufacturer}} of armoured vehicles. Alvis Vickers was {{merged with the}} company's RO Defence unit to form BAE Systems Land Systems. Recognising the lack of scale of this business compared to General Dynamics, BAE Systems executives soon identified the US defence company United Defense Industries (UDI), a major competitor to General Dynamics, as a main acquisition target. On 7 March 2005 BAE announced the £2.25 billion (approx. US$4.2 billion c. 2005) acquisition of UDI.

50|$|A {{military}} armored (or armoured) car is {{a lightweight}} wheeled armored fighting vehicle, historically employed for reconnaissance, internal security, armed escort, and other subordinate battlefield tasks. With the gradual decline of mounted cavalry, armored cars were developed for carrying out duties formerly assigned to horsemen. Following {{the invention of the}} tank, the armored car remained popular due to its comparatively simplified maintenance and low production cost. It also found favor with several colonial armies as a cheaper weapon for use in underdeveloped regions. During World War II, most armored cars were engineered for reconnaissance and passive observation, while others were devoted to communications tasks. Some equipped with <b>heavier</b> <b>armament</b> could even substitute for tracked <b>combat</b> <b>vehicles</b> in favorable conditions - such as pursuit or flanking maneuvers during the North African Campaign.|$|R
