5|$|Michael Farrar {{underwent}} surgery in December 1995 to treat an abscess {{in his brain}} caused by the poisoning. Fearful that Farrar would not survive the proceedings, and knowing that <b>his</b> <b>testimony</b> was key to their case, prosecutors videotaped <b>his</b> <b>testimony</b> beforehand. The surgery was successful, and Farrar testified in person and recounted Green's problems with alcohol and the break-up of their marriage. Under cross-examination by Green's counsel, he admitted that both he and Green had contributed to {{the problems in the}} couple's marriage and that his relationship with his son had been so adversarial that they had sometimes come to blows.|$|E

5|$|The LeT {{operative}} David Headley (born Daood Sayed Gilani) in <b>his</b> <b>testimony</b> {{before a}} Chicago federal court during co-accused Tahawwur Rana's trial revealed that Mumbai Chabad House {{was added to}} the list of targets for surveillance given by his Inter Services Intelligence handler Major Iqbal, though the Oberoi hotel, one of the sites attacked, was not originally on the list.|$|E
5|$|After leaving {{government}} service, Matlock has occasionally {{joined with}} other experts to criticize U.S. government policy. On June 26, 1997, he signed an Open Letter to Bill Clinton criticizing plans for NATO expansion. His reason for opposition, as given in <b>his</b> <b>testimony</b> before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, {{is the belief}} that NATO expansion will preclude significant nuclear arms reduction with Russia, and consequently increase the risk of a terrorist nuclear attack.|$|E

Coakley denied threatening anyone, exclaiming that such an idea was a personal affront. Veltmann responded that this line of evidence was news to him, too. The next day, Coakley gave the press a statement accusing Veltmann of coaching McPherson.|$|E
5|$|Apollo and {{his mentor}} Kristoph Gavin, {{an old friend}} of Phoenix's, are called to {{represent}} him against charges of murdering one of his customers in a rigged game of poker.

Impressed by Apollo's performance, he invites him to start his own practice out of Trucy's talent agency.|$|E

5|$|In June and July 1991, {{the short}} armed {{conflict}} in Slovenia {{came to a}} speedy end, {{partly because of the}} ethnic homogeneity of the population of Slovenia. It was later revealed that a military strike against Slovenia, followed by a planned withdrawal, was conceived by Slobodan Milošević and Borisav Jović, then president of the SFR Yugoslavia presidency.

5|$|Private {{investigator}} George Newman {{claimed in}} 2001 that Chobert had recanted <b>his</b> <b>testimony.</b> Commentators {{also noted that}} police and news photographs {{of the crime scene}} did not show Chobert's taxi, and that Cynthia White, the only witness at the trial to testify to seeing the taxi, had previously provided crime scene descriptions that omitted it. Cynthia White was declared to be dead by the state of New Jersey in 1992, but Pamela Jenkins claimed that she saw White alive as late as 1997. Mumia supporters often claim that White was a police informant and that she falsified her testimony against Abu-Jamal.|$|E
5|$|Scholars usually {{agree that}} John {{is not entirely}} without {{historical}} value. It has become generally accepted that certain sayings in John are as old or older than their synoptic counterparts. His representation of the topography around Jerusalem is often superior {{to that of the}} synoptics, <b>his</b> <b>testimony</b> that Jesus was executed before, rather than on, Passover, might well be more accurate, and his presentation of Jesus in the garden and the prior meeting held by the Jewish authorities are possibly more historically plausible than their synoptic parallels.|$|E
