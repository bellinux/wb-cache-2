5|$|The {{greater number}} of naturalists who have taken into {{consideration}} the whole structure of man, including his mental faculties, have followed Blumenbach and Cuvier, and have placed man in a separate Order, under {{the title of the}} Bimana, and therefore on an equality with the orders of the Quadrumana, Carnivora, etc. Recently many of our best naturalists have recurred to the view first propounded by Linnaeus, so remarkable for his sagacity, and have placed man in the same Order with the Quadrumana, under the title of the Primates. The justice of this conclusion will be admitted: for in the first place, we must bear in mind the comparative insignificance for classification of the great development of the brain in man, and that the strongly marked differences between the skulls of man and the Quadrumana (lately insisted upon by Bischoff, Aeby, and others) apparently follow from their differently developed brains. In the second place, we must remember that nearly all the other and more important differences between man and the Quadrumana are manifestly adaptive in their nature, and relate chiefly to the erect position of man; such as the structure of his hand, foot, and pelvis, the curvature of his spine, and the position of his head. I absolutely know of none. If only someone might tell me a single one! If I would have called man a simian or vice versa, I would have brought together all the theologians against me.

No living person possesses a tithe of his information respecting the Hudson's Bay countries... Never mind his Bunyan-like face and cropped hair; {{he has a very}} powerful mind, and a singular faculty of picture-making. He can create a wilderness and people it with warring savages, or climb the Rocky Mountains with you in a snow-storm, so clearly and palpably, that only shut your eyes and you hear the crack of the rifle, or feel the snow-flakes melt on your cheeks as he talks.|$|E

500|$|With {{less than}} three {{minutes left in the}} allotted time, Nixon finally {{addressed}} the question: Would he stay or would he go? He indicated that he did not think he should go. [...] "Let me say this: I don't believe that <b>I</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> quit because I'm not a quitter. And, incidentally, Pat's not a quitter. After all, her name was Patricia Ryan and she was born on St. Patrick's Day, and you know the Irish never quit." ...|$|E
500|$|Her {{books were}} very popular during the Great Depression and World War II. Her novels, which {{journalist}} Lesley McDowell described as containing [...] "derring-do, dashing blades, and maids in peril", allowed readers {{to escape from}} the mundane and difficult elements of their lives. In a letter describing her novel Friday's Child, Heyer commented, [...] "'I think myself <b>I</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> be shot for writing such nonsense. ... But it's unquestionably good escapist literature and I think I should rather like it if I were sitting in an air-raid shelter or recovering from flu." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} hours of the next morning, Shackleton summoned the expedition's physician, Alexander Macklin, to his cabin, {{complaining}} of back pains and other discomfort. According to Macklin's own account, Macklin told him he had been overdoing things and should try to [...] "lead a more regular life", to which Shackleton answered: [...] "You are always wanting me to give up things, what is it <b>I</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> give up?" [...] "Chiefly alcohol, Boss," [...] replied Macklin. A few moments later, at 2:50a.m. on 5 January 1922, Shackleton suffered a fatal heart attack.|$|E

6000|$|Regina blushed and hesitated, [...] "My room {{is next to}} my aunt's," [...] she explained. [...] "We {{keep the}} door between us open.

If I thought that any part of your interest in the man's scientific attainments had become diverted to the man himself, I should feel inclined to take him by the neck and throw him into the Serpentine." ...|$|R
500|$|A new freshman, David Banks, wrote {{a letter}} to his mother about his {{experience}} in trying out for the football team in the fall of 1901:"I am not sure whether <b>I</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> play football or not. ... I put on Tom's suit one night and went down to the field to meet Yost and a few other men. They made me run around the track a couple times to try my wind. Then they rolled me around the ground and sat on me a while. I did not understand the necessity of all they did to me, but the boys say every great player must begin that way." ...|$|E
500|$|Darwin became {{engrossed in}} meticulous {{microscopic}} examination, tracing the complicated mechanisms of flowers that attracted insects by their nectar {{so that the}} insects transported pollen to cross-pollinate other plants, and on 19 July he told Hooker, [...] "I am intensely interested on subject, just as at a game of chess." [...] In September, he [...] "dissected with the greatest interest" [...] and wrote, [...] "The contrivances for insect fertilisation in Orchids are multiform & truly wonderful & beautiful." [...] By October, he had [...] "a large mass of notes with many new facts", but set them aside [...] "convinced that <b>I</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> work on Variation & not amuse myself with interludes".|$|E
500|$|After Charles's death, Lucinda Dalton {{applied to}} cancel her temple sealing to Charles in 1884: [...] "though I {{know he had}} many imperfections... now the brethren say he is unworthy, (though I know not who {{appointed}} them to judge him,) they urge that I stand in a very insecure position, and that for my children's sake, {{as well as my}} own, <b>I</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> marry again." [...] Dalton feared that by remaining sealed to Charles, she would forfeit her claim to her children. Perhaps because Charles was a drinker, her [...] "brethren" [...] considered him unworthy of his sealing. Her sealing cancellation was approved in 1887 and then revoked after her death in 1931.|$|E

500|$|Seven men met {{to draft}} the {{invitation}} to the Protestant Dutch Stadtholder, William, Prince of Orange, to invade England and assume the throne. The signatories to the letter included Whigs, Tories, and the Bishop of London, Henry Compton, who assured the Prince that, [...] "Nineteen parts of twenty of the people... are desirous of change". William needed no further encouragement. Although the invitation was not signed by Churchill (he was not, as yet, of sufficient political rank to be a signatory), he declared his intention through William's principal English contact in The Hague – [...] "If {{you think there is}} anything else that <b>I</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> doe, you have but to command me". Churchill, like many others, was looking for an opportune time to desert James.|$|E
500|$|When Wodehouse {{heard of}} the furore the {{broadcasts}} had caused, he contacted the Foreign Office—through the Swiss embassy in Berlin—to explain his actions, and attempted to return home via neutral countries, but the German authorities refused to let him leave. In Performing Flea, a 1953 collection of letters, Wodehouse wrote, [...] "Of course <b>I</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> have had the sense {{to see that it}} was a loony thing to do to use the German radio for even the most harmless stuff, but I didn't. I suppose prison life saps the intellect". The reaction in America was mixed: the left-leaning publication P.M. accused Wodehouse of [...] "play Jeeves to the Nazis", but the Department of War used the interviews as an ideal representation of anti-Nazi propaganda.|$|E
500|$|After {{his brother}} died in 1929, Pond married Katherine N. de Nancrede, who was 47 years old, at a {{ceremony}} in Ann Arbor. [...] Pond said at the time, [...] "It's the first time I ever did it, and I thought <b>I</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> be pardoned because of my youth." [...] Pond was also an amateur acrobat and remained a physical fitness buff all of his life. [...] At {{the time of his}} wedding in 1929, the Associated Press reported that he is [...] "almost as well known for his present athletic agility as for his architectural accomplishments. A part of his daily routine is to turn handsprings and flipflops and do other strenuous exercises." [...] He drew applause when, on his 80th birthday, he grabbed his bare knees with both hands and performed a backflip. [...] A photograph of Pond's feat was published in Life magazine in June 1937.|$|E

500|$|A preview {{screening}} of Sweet Smell of Success was poorly received, as Tony Curtis fans were {{expecting him to}} play one of his typical nice guy roles and instead were presented with the scheming Sidney Falco. Mackendrick remembered seeing audience members [...] "curling up, crossing their arms and legs, recoiling from the screen in disgust". Burt Lancaster's fans were not thrilled with their idol either, [...] "finding the film too static and talky". The film was a box office failure, and Hecht blamed his producing partner Hill. [...] "The night of the preview, Harold said to me, 'You know you've wrecked our company? We're going to lose {{over a million dollars}} on this picture,'" [...] Hill recalled. However, Lancaster blamed Lehman, who remembers a confrontation they had: [...] "Burt threatened me at a party after the preview. He said, 'You didn't have to leave – you could have made this a much better picture. <b>I</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> beat you up.' I said, 'Go ahead – I could use the money.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Emerson saw a kindred {{spirit in}} Very and defended his sanity. As {{he wrote to}} Margaret Fuller, [...] "Such a mind cannot be lost". Emerson was {{sympathetic}} with Very's plight because he himself had recently been ostracized after his controversial lecture, the [...] "Divinity School Address". He helped Very publish a small volume, Essays and Poems in 1839. The poems collected in this volume were chiefly Shakespearean sonnets. Very also published several poems in the Western Messenger between 1838 and 1840 {{as well as in}} The Dial, the journal of the Transcendentalists. He was disappointed, however, that Emerson, serving as editor of the journal, altered his poems. Very wrote to Emerson in July 1842, [...] "Perhaps they were all improvements but I preferred my own lines. I do not know but <b>I</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> submit to such changes as done by the rightful authority of an Editor but I felt a little sad at the aspect of the piece." [...] He was never widely read, and was largely forgotten {{by the end of the}} nineteenth century, but in the 1830s and 1840s the Transcendentalists, including Emerson, as well as William Cullen Bryant, praised his work.|$|E
500|$|Tragedy befell Alice on 29 May 1873, {{when her}} {{youngest}} and favourite son, Friedrich, called [...] "Frittie", died after falling 20feet from a window. The child suffered from haemophilia, {{and although he}} regained consciousness, the internal bleeding could not be stopped. Alice never recovered from Frittie's death, writing to her mother two months later: [...] "I am glad {{you have a little}} coloured picture of my darling. I feel lower and sadder than ever and miss him so much, so continually." [...] However, the Queen's attention was more focused on the engagement of her son Prince Alfred to the Grand Duchess Marie Alexandrovna of Russia, the only surviving daughter of Tsar Alexander II and his first wife, Empress Marie Alexandrovna. The Tsar had refused to present his daughter for pre-marriage inspection in England, and instead invited the Queen to meet the family in Germany. Alice supported this suggestion, and on the same day she wrote to the Queen about how much she missed Frittie, the Queen wrote to Alice in scathing terms: [...] "You have entirely taken the Russian side, and I do not think, dear child, that you should tell me...what <b>I</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> do." ...|$|E

500|$|Hornish again {{returned}} to Penske in 2006. The team changed manufacturers, joining Honda when Toyota and Chevrolet left the series after the 2005 season. His season highlight was the Indianapolis 500, {{when he passed}} Marco Andretti for the lead on the final lap {{to win in the}} second-closest margin of victory in the race's history. Hornish later said about the pass, [...] "I figured I came all this way, <b>I</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> give myself one more shot at it. I kind of looked at it as, I was going to drive over him if I had to. For Marco to come as a rookie and drive like that he should be proud no matter what." [...] His second win of the season was at Richmond (after leading for all but 38 laps), and he took the points lead after winning the next race at Kansas. His fourth and final win of the season was at Kentucky, when he started second and led for 57 laps. In the season-ending race at Chicagoland Hornish qualified for the pole position and finished third, clinching his third series championship and Penske's first. Although he and Dan Wheldon finished the year with the same number of points, the tie was broken by wins; Hornish had four, and Wheldon two.|$|E
500|$|On 10 August, Patton {{entered the}} {{receiving}} tent of the hospital, {{speaking to the}} injured there. Patton approached Bennett, who was huddled and shivering, and asked what the trouble was. [...] "It's my nerves," [...] Bennett responded. [...] "I can't stand the shelling anymore." [...] Patton reportedly became enraged at him, slapping him across the face. He began yelling: [...] "Your nerves, hell, you are just a goddamned coward. Shut up that goddamned crying. I won't have these brave {{men who have been}} shot at seeing this yellow bastard sitting here crying." [...] Patton then reportedly slapped Bennett again, knocking his helmet liner off, and ordered the receiving officer, Major Charles B. Etter, not to admit him. Patton then threatened Bennett, [...] "You're going back to the front lines and you may get shot and killed, but you're going to fight. If you don't, I'll stand you up against a wall and have a firing squad kill you on purpose. In fact, <b>I</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> shoot you myself, you goddamned whimpering coward." [...] Upon saying this, Patton pulled out his pistol threateningly, prompting the hospital's commander, Colonel Donald E. Currier, to physically separate the two. Patton left the tent, yelling to medical officers to send Bennett back to the front lines.|$|E
500|$|On 4 January 1922, South Georgia was sighted, {{and late}} that morning Quest {{anchored}} at Grytviken. After visiting the whaling establishment ashore, Shackleton {{returned to the}} ship apparently refreshed. He told Frank Wild that they would celebrate their deferred Christmas the next day, and retired to his cabin to write his diary. [...] "The old smell of dead whale permeates everything", he wrote. [...] "It is a strange and curious place....A wonderful evening. In the darkening twilight I saw a lone star hover, gem like above the bay." [...] Later he slept, and was heard snoring by the surgeon McIlroy, who had just finished his watch-keeping duty. Shortly after 2a.m. {{on the morning of}} 5 January, Macklin, who had taken over the watch, was summoned to Shackleton's cabin. He found Shackleton complaining of back pains and severe facial neuralgia, and asking for a painkilling drug. In a brief discussion, Macklin told his leader that he had been overdoing things, and needed to lead a more regular life. Macklin records Shackleton as saying: [...] "You're always wanting me to give up things, what is it <b>I</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> give up?" [...] Macklin replied [...] "Chiefly alcohol, Boss, I don't think it agrees with you." [...] Immediately afterwards Shackleton [...] "had a very severe paroxysm, during which he died".|$|E
