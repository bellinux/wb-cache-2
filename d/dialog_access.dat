40|$|We present KnoWDiaL, an {{approach}} for Learning and using task-relevant Knowledge from human-robot <b>Dialog</b> and <b>access</b> to the Web. KnoWDiaL assumes {{that there is}} an autonomous agent that performs tasks, as requested by humans through speech. The agent needs to “understand” the request, (i. e., to fully ground the task until it can proceed to plan for and execute it). KnoWDiaL contributes such understanding by using and updating a Knowledge Base, by dialoguing with the user, and by accessing the web. We believe that KnoWDiaL, as we present it, can be applied to general autonomous agents. However, we focus on our work with our autonomous collaborative robot, CoBot, which executes service tasks in a building, moving around and transporting objects between locations. Hence, the knowledge acquired and accessed consists of groundings of language to robot actions, and building locations, persons, and objects. KnoWDiaL handles the interpretation of voice commands, is robust regarding speech recognition errors, and is able to learn commands involving referring expressions in an open domain, (i. e., without requiring a lexicon). We present in detail the multiple components of KnoWDiaL, namely a frame-semantic parser, a probabilistic grounding model, a web-based predicate evaluator, a dialog manager, and the weighted predicate-based Knowledge Base. We illustrate the knowledge access and updates from the <b>dialog</b> and Web <b>access,</b> through detailed and complete examples. We further evaluate the correctness of the predicate instances learned into the Knowledge Base, and show the increase in dialog efficiency {{as a function of the}} number of interactions. We have extensively and successfully used KnoWDiaL in CoBot dialoguing and accessing the Web, and extract a few corresponding example sequences from captured videos...|$|R

40|$|In this article, {{we present}} an {{approach}} {{to the development of}} a stochastic dialog manager. The model used by this dialog manager to generate its turns takes into account both the last turns of the user and system, and the information supplied by the user throughout the dialog. As the space of situations that can be presented in the dialogs is too large, some techniques for reducing this space have been proposed. This system has been developed in the DIHANA project, whose goal is the design and development of a <b>dialog</b> system to <b>access</b> a railway information system using spontaneous speech in Spanish. A training corpus of 900 dialogs, that was acquired through the Wizard of Oz, was used to learn the models. An evaluation of the dialog manager is also presented. 1...|$|R

Keyword entry through the voice interface was significantly faster, while search result navigation, and page browsing were significantly slower. Although users preferred the GUI-based interface, task success rates between both systems were comparable – a promising result for regions where Smartphones and data plans are not viable.

40|$|In this article, {{we present}} an {{approach}} {{for the construction}} of a stochastic dialog manager, in which the system answer is selected by means of a classification procedure. In particular, we use neural networks for the implementation of this classification process, which takes into account the data supplied by the user and the last system turn. The stochastic model is automatically learnt from training data which are labeled in terms of dialog acts. An important characteristic of this approach is the introduction of a partition in the space of sequences of dialog acts in order to deal with the scarcity of available training data. This system has been developed in the DIHANA project, whose goal is the design and development of a <b>dialog</b> system to <b>access</b> a railway information system using spontaneous speech in Spanish.

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} our work on speech {{recognition}} for a spoken dialog system for automatic travel reservations. The system can receive speech input from an analog line or from IP telephony through a web site. The system uses speech recognition, natural language understanding, air travel database <b>access,</b> <b>dialog</b> management, {{natural language generation}} and speech synthesis technologies to perform the task of an automated travel agent. Language modeling for a mixed-initiative spoken dialog system is a challenging problem. We explore class-based n-gram language models (LMs) for this domain. Details for designing LM classes and assigning non-uniform probabilities within the classes are provided. We point out disadvantages of class-based LMs and introduce compound word vocabularies to overcome the problems observed. Dialog state dependent LMs are explored which enables incorporating semantic context into the language models. We also analyze the use of embedded context free grammar objects within LMs and point out {{advantages and disadvantages of}} using them. The resulting LMs are implemented and evaluated using IBM telephony speech recognition engine. Our efforts are shown to decrease the word error rate from 24 % to 17 % on an evaluation testset...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{researches}} {{the phenomenon}} ‘caring relationship’. The empirical studies {{in this thesis}} were carried out in China with the aim to describe the caring relationship in China through the lifeworld experiences of professional caregivers and patients. The result of this study will later on relate to a study of Swedish caring relationships. For this phenomenological study 9 patients, 10 medical and healthcare workers and 4 nursing tutors were interviewed. They were from 5 different medical and care units from two hospitals, one private clinic and a nursing school in Southern China. This study shows that caring relationship in China has many layers. Embedded in the basic interpersonal relationship is a ‘relationship of need’. The relationship carries a goal: to help the patient to restore a personal harmonic existence and regain the responsibility for their health. The relationship is temporary and normally ends when the goal is achieved. The relationship is initiated by the patients need for help. The two main actors in the caring relationship are {{the patient and the}} caregiver with their roles as care seeker and care provider. This study shows that to become a patient is a process of diminishing the natural ordinary self which makes the person feel vulnerable. Caregivers take a leading role which carries responsibility. They feel an obligation to use all their knowledge and resources {{for the benefit of the}} patients. They teach them how to live and how to stay healthy. A main function in the caring relationship is the transfer of knowledge. The caregivers feel the need to create a <b>dialog</b> to get <b>access</b> to the patients’ unique knowledge about themselves so that the caregiver’s general knowledge of health and care can be applied to the individual. Through the informal chats they share the patient’s experiences, emotions and history. It creates en opportunity for the interpersonal relationship to grow deeper and for the patient and the caregiver to meet as fellow human beings. In the Chinese caring relationship the patient’s family is included. It is considered to be every contributor’s duty to be responsible for oneself and for others. Mutual understanding and respect in a caring relationship are important in getting the patient back into balance...|$|R
40|$|Abstract GeoHeritage-GIS (GH-GIS), a {{web site}} {{concerning}} Palermo Historic Centre monumental Heritage, developed within Project 7 T 7 Cluster C 29, funded by MIUR, has been designed as a permanent interface between who studies the hazard factors interesting this area and a vast category of final users which operate to safeguard Palermo Monumental Heritage, a very precious common weal. These end-users will benefit from homogeneously collected, frequently improved and periodically updated data concerning soil properties, seismic effects {{and all of that}} can help to define the hazard exposition of each monument, having an important tool in establishing a scale of priorities for interventions and resource allocation. On start-up GH-GIS shows the geo-referred monumental database (MD) of Palermo upon a geo-referred map of Palermo historic centre, that can be manipulated using some of the standard GIS tools (e. g., zooming, panning, distance measurement, etc). The user can access to all information concerning a specific database element by directly clicking it upon the map, by digitizing monument name or by selecting it from the list of database elements. GH-GIS can provide monuments lists answering specific requirements imposed by user. The user may superimpose on this map the total dataset concerning Palermo Historic Centre worked out within the aforementioned Project 7 T 7 Cluster C 29, which includes a high density stratigraphic-geotechnical database, the stratigraphic and lithotecnical sections database worked out, describing fundation soils of several MD elements, the accelerograms database of the September 2002 seismic sequence, recorded by eight temporary digital seismic stations, installed by INGV and Geology and Geodesy Department Palermo University, inside Palermo Historic Centre, the “AeDES” damage census database set up after the 6 th September 2002 earthquake by Civil Protection Regional Department -Sicily. These different databases can be simultaneously displayed and queried, directly relating them to MD elements, making readily evident possible correlations. Specifically designed <b>dialog</b> boxes give <b>access</b> also to relational information, allowing to recognise: MD elements affected by hazard factors as soft foundation soils (alluvial deposits, recent sea deposits, man made filling), a superficial water table, etc [...] , MD elements affected by vulnerability factors, as presence of crypts, MD elements affected by both hazard and vulnerability factors. The several implemented functions make GH-GIS a very effective support tool to safeguard Palermo monuments...|$|R
