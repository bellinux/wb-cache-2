50|$|According to Natural Resources Canada (2001), {{the health}} status of Canadians living in the Arctic is {{significantly}} {{lower than that of}} the rest of Canadian inhabitants. Life expectancy is low and infant mortality rates are high, especially in the territory of Nunavut.

Many Aboriginal peoples in Canada’s North have a lower socioeconomic status that has significant <b>implications</b> <b>for</b> <b>health</b> and well-being. Suicide rates, lung cancer, drowning rates and the number of deaths by accident are high. Due to the self-sufficient lifestyle in the Arctic, a large amount of time is spent hunting, fishing and gathering other food sources, which makes motor vehicle accidents in hazardous terrain common.|$|E
