40|$|Delta-doped GaAs: Si with doping densities up to 4 X 10 (14) <b>square</b> <b>centimetre</b> {{has been}} grown by {{molecular}} beam epitaxy (MBE) at a substrate temperature of 590 degree. To promote an ordered incorporation and thus avoid clustering of Si atoms. vicinal GaAs(O 01) surfaces 2 degree misoriented towards (111) Ga were used and Si was supplied in pulses. As evidenced by real-time reflection high-energy electron diffraction (RHEED) measurements an ordered incorporation of Si atoms on Ga sites along the step edges takes place. Although the ordered (3 x 2) structure degrades at high coverages, unusual high sheet carrier concentrations are obtained by pulsed delta-doping for doping concentrations > 10 (13) <b>square</b> <b>centimetre,</b> as revealed by Hall measurements.
