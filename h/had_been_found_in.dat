5|$|The {{body of a}} 25-year-old {{substitute}} teacher from Kingston, Amy Glauner, was found on Joppenbergh after an October 1998 search. Police determined that she died of head trauma following a fall. Her car <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> a parking lot by the mountain.|$|E
5|$|A {{growing number}} of astronomers argued for Pluto to be declassified as a planet, because many similar objects {{approaching}} its size <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> the same region of the Solar System (the Kuiper belt) during the 1990s and early 2000s. Pluto {{was found to be}} just one small body in a population of thousands.|$|E

5|$|A second {{specimen}} {{was obtained}} in 1966 and the find {{was published in}} 1971 by Hugh Genoways and Knox Jones, who noted that the species is closely similar to O.palustris. Later workers affirmed the relationship between O.dimidiatus, O.palustris and associated species like O.couesi. Fiona Reid reported in 1997 that a third specimen <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>found.</b> <b>In</b> 2006, Marcelo Weksler and coworkers removed most of the species formerly placed in Oryzomys from the genus, {{because they are not}} closely related to the type species O.palustris, but kept O.dimidiatus as an Oryzomys.|$|E
5|$|Alvarez {{assembled}} {{a team of}} physicists and archeologists from the United States and Egypt, the recording equipment was constructed and the experiment carried out, though it was interrupted by the 1967 Six-Day War. Restarted after the war, the effort continued, recording and analyzing the penetrating cosmic rays until 1969 when Alvarez reported to the American Physical Society that no chambers <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> the 19% of the pyramid surveyed.|$|E
5|$|Buffetaut (1989, 1992) {{referred}} three specimens {{from the}} Institut und Museum für Geologie und Paläontologie of the University of Göttingen in Germany to Spinosaurus: a right maxilla fragment IMGP 969-1, a jaw fragment IMGP 969-2, and a tooth IMGP 969-3. These <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> a Lower Cenomanian or Upper Albian deposit in southeastern Morocco in 1971.|$|E

5|$|In July 2009 it was {{announced}} that traces of ammonia <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> the plumes during flybys in July and October 2008. Reducing the freezing point of water with ammonia would also allow for outgassing and higher gas pressure, and less heat required to power the water plumes. The subsurface layer heating the surface water ice could be an ammonia–water slurry at temperatures as low as , and thus less energy is required to produce the plume activity.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{reported}} that when energy was applied to a combination of gases like those in Titan's atmosphere, five nucleotide bases, the building blocks of DNA and RNA, were among the many compounds produced. In addition, amino acids, the building blocks of protein were found. It was the first time nucleotide bases and amino acids <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> such an experiment without liquid water being present.|$|E
5|$|This remnant (RX J0852.0-4622) <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> front (apparently) of {{the larger}} Vela Supernova Remnant. The gamma rays from the decay of titanium-44 showed {{that it must have}} {{exploded}} fairly recently (perhaps around 1200 AD), but there is no historical record of it. The flux of gamma rays and x-rays indicates that the supernova was relatively close to us (perhaps 200 parsecs or 600 ly). If so, this is a surprising event because supernovae less than 200 parsecs away are estimated to occur less than once per 100,000 years.|$|E

5|$|Apart {{from the}} finds in the Taynton Limestone Formation, in 1939 Sidney Hugh Reynolds {{referred}} remains to Megalosaurus that <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> the older Chipping Norton Limestone Formation {{dating from the}} early Bathonian, about thirty single teeth and bones. Though the age disparity makes it problematic to assume an identity with Megalosaurus bucklandii, in 2009 Benson could not establish any relevant anatomical differences with M. bucklandii among the remains found at one site, the New Park Quarry, and therefore affirmed the reference to that species. However, in another site, the Oakham Quarry, the material contained one bone, an ilium, that was clearly dissimilar.|$|E
5|$|As of 1905, {{there were}} thirty-seven stones {{remaining}} in the circle. At the time there were conspicuous gaps on the northern and western sides of the ring, with the stones perhaps having been removed for use as road metal. In 1915 {{it was reported that}} one of the previously recorded stones had been removed but that three additional stones <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> the circle. By 1988, Martin J. F. Fowler reported that there were only twenty-nine stones in the circle. Conversely, the following year Burl reported thirty stones, of which three had fallen and twenty-seven remained standing. Originally it may have included around a hundred stones, spaced about one metre (3 feet 6 inches) apart.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, Dodson raised two {{objections}} to Horner's hypothesis. Firstly, {{the possession of}} just one pair of main spikes seemed more basal than the presence of three pairs, as with Styracosaurus albertensis. This suggested {{to him that the}} Einiosaurus-Achelousaurus lineage was a separate branch within the Centrosaurinae. Secondly, he was concerned that Einiosaurus and Achelousaurus were a case of sexual dimorphism, one type being the males, the other the females. This would be suggested by the short geological time interval between the layers their fossils <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>in,</b> which was estimated by him at about 250,000 years. But if the hypothesis were true, it would be perhaps the best example of fast evolution in the Dinosauria.|$|E

50|$|NABS I, V, VII, IX, X, and XI <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> British Columbia; I, III, V <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> the Prairie Provinces, with I and V {{occurring}} {{in both the}} boreal and subalpine regions; I, III, V, and VII <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> Ontario; and I, II, III, V, and VI <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> Quebec. Armillaria ostoyae is the species most commonly <b>found</b> <b>in</b> all Canadian provinces surveyed (Mallett 1990). Armillaria root rot occurs in the Northwest Territories, and was identified on white spruce at Pine Point on Great Slave Lake prior to NABS findings.|$|R
50|$|Waagenoceras is a genus of {{cephalopods}} {{first recorded}} in the early Permian Period. It <b>has</b> <b>been</b> described as a 'fast-moving nektonic carnivore' by the Paleobiology Database. They <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> Canada, mainly in British Columbia, though the overwhelming majority <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> Texas, United States and others <b>in</b> Mexico.

5|$|La Cotte de St Brelade is a Palaeolithic site {{inhabited}} before {{rising sea}} levels transformed Jersey into an island. Jersey was a centre of Neolithic activity, {{as demonstrated by}} the concentration of dolmens. Evidence of Bronze Age and early Iron Age settlements can be found in many locations around the island. In June 2012 it was announced what could be Europe's largest hoard of Iron Age coins <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> Grouville by two persons using metal detectors. The hoard may be worth up to £10 M. People had been searching for this treasure for 30 years. It was reported that the hoard weighed about three quarters of a tonne and could contain up to 50,000 Roman and Celtic coins. In 2012 the same two men had found 60 Iron Age coins in the same area.|$|E
5|$|Officers found {{a firing}} range inside a disused wine cellar {{being used as}} an {{underground}} bunker, and seized weapons including an assault rifle, a submachine gun, a semi-automatic pistol and an RPG-18 rocket launcher. An earlier version of the rocket launcher, the RPG-7, {{had been in the}} possession of the Provisional IRA from as early as 1972, {{but this was the first}} time the RPG-18 <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> the possession of a paramilitary organisation in Ireland. Among those convicted were Alan Ryan, who was on bail for possession of a loaded revolver at his home in Dublin.|$|E
5|$|The Forensic Science Service email was {{translated}} into Portuguese on 4 September. The next day, according to Kate, the Polícia Judiciária proposed that, {{if she were to}} admit that Madeleine had died in an accident in the apartment, and that she had hidden the body, she might only serve a two-year sentence. Her husband would not be charged and would be free to leave. Both parents were given arguido status on 7 September, and were advised by their lawyer not to answer questions. The Polícia Judiciária told Gerry that Madeleine's DNA <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> the car boot and behind the sofa in 5A. Gerry did respond to questions, but Kate declined to reply to 48 questions she was asked during an 11-hour interview.|$|E

5000|$|The only {{reasonably}} complete specimens, of Halkieria evangelista, <b>were</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> the Sirius Passet lagerstätte in Greenland. Fragments {{which are}} confidently classified {{as belonging to}} halkieriids <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> China's Xinjiang province and Australia's Georgina Basin, while shells of a possible halkieriid <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> Canada's Burgess Shale.

5|$|The {{surface of}} the nucleus is {{generally}} dry, dusty or rocky, suggesting that the ices are hidden beneath a surface crust several metres thick. In addition to the gases already mentioned, the nuclei contain a variety of organic compounds, which may include methanol, hydrogen cyanide, formaldehyde, ethanol, and ethane and perhaps more complex molecules such as long-chain hydrocarbons and amino acids. In 2009, {{it was confirmed that}} the amino acid glycine <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> the comet dust recovered by NASA's Stardust mission. In August 2011, a report, based on NASA studies of meteorites found on Earth, was published suggesting DNA and RNA components (adenine, guanine, and related organic molecules) may have been formed on asteroids and comets.|$|E
5|$|Various Taliban {{supplies}} were seized by coalition forces following the battle. On 13 December, British and Afghan army units located bomb factories and weapons caches {{as they moved}} further into the outskirts of Musa Qala and searched Taliban positions. At the same time, the first civilians started {{to return to the}} area, some with reports of Taliban punishments and claims of active Pakistani and Arab jihadis. A new orientation of British strategy in Helmand is to use military force to curb the influence of local drug barons, whose trade supports the insurgents. On 16 December, British troops burned an estimated £150 to £200 million worth of heroin that <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> a drug factory and other buildings in Musa Qala.|$|E
5|$|Altogether, Hawkins called 215 witnesses, {{including}} {{numbers from}} France, Melipilla, Australia and Wapping, who testified either that the Claimant was not Roger Tichborne {{or that he}} was Arthur Orton. A handwriting expert swore that the Claimant's writing resembled Orton's but not Roger Tichborne's. The entire story of rescue by the Osprey was, Hawkins asserted, a fraud. A ship of that name had arrived in Melbourne in July 1854 but did not correspond to the Claimant's description. Furthermore, the Claimant had provided the wrong name for Ospreys captain, and the names he gave for two of Ospreys crew were found to belong {{to members of the}} crew of the Middleton, the ship which had landed Orton at Hobart. No mention of a rescue <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> Ospreys log or in the Melbourne harbourmaster's records. Giving evidence on the contents of the sealed packet, Gosford revealed that it contained information regarding the disposition of certain properties, but nothing relating to Katherine Doughty's seduction or pregnancy.|$|E
