40|$|Whirl flutter is a {{specific}} type of flutter instability, relevant for turboprop aircraft, caused by the effect of rotating parts as a propeller or a gas-turbine engine rotor. The proposed optimisation-based analytical procedure is used to determine the critical values of the engine attachment stiffness parameters for the preselected flutter speed. For the half-span model, two design variables are used. The objective function is defined as the minimization of the engine vibration mode frequency sum. Design constraints keep the engine frequency ratio and the flutter stability at the selected velocity. However, application of a full-span model is necessary in some cases. In this case, special models of both symmetric and antisymmetric engine vibrations and four design variables must be used. Design constraints maintain the pitch mode frequency ratio, the yaw mode frequency ratio and the critical mode frequency ratio. Critical modes are dependent on the relation between the rotational direction of both propellers (identical or inverse). A flutter design constraint is applied as well. The described methodology is demonstrated on the application example of a twin-engine commuter aircraft. Demonstrated cases include symmetrical revolutions of propellers for both identical and <b>inverse</b> <b>directions</b> of rotation, cases of single engine failure and single propeller feathering, and finally, cases of unsymmetrical revolutions including the reduced and increased revolutions of a single propeller, for both identical and <b>inverse</b> <b>directions</b> of rotation...|$|R

We use a custom interior-point method to make the optimization problem unconstrained; this is key to defining the forward and inverse dynamics in a consistent way. The resulting model has a parameter which sets the amount of contact smoothing, facilitating continuation methods for optimization.

5000|$|A holon (Greek: ὅλον, holon neuter form of ὅλος, holos [...] "whole") is {{something}} that is simultaneously a whole and a part. The word was coined by Arthur Koestler in his book The Ghost in the Machine (1967, p. 48). Koestler was influenced by two observations in proposing the notion of the holon. The first observation was influenced by Herbert A. Simon's parable of the two watchmakers—in which Simon concludes that complex systems evolve from simple systems much more rapidly when there are stable intermediate forms present in the evolutionary process than if they are not present. [...] The second observation was made by Koestler himself in his analysis of hierarchies and stable intermediate forms in non-living matter (atomic and molecular structure), living organisms, and social organizations. He concluded that, although it is easy to identify sub-wholes or parts, wholes and parts in an absolute sense do not exist anywhere. Koestler proposed the word holon to describe the hybrid nature of sub-wholes and parts within in vivo systems. From this perspective, holons exist simultaneously as self-contained wholes in relation to their sub-ordinate parts, and as dependent parts when considered from the <b>inverse</b> <b>direction.</b>|$|E

Questions of this nature call for an inverse modeling scheme in which information about the sensor components can be extracted from the knowledge of a few physical quantities demanded for the device.

We describe how VE and VPDI can vary, sometimes in <b>inverse</b> <b>directions,</b> across disease outcomes and vaccinated populations. We provide examples of how VPDI can be used to reveal the relative public health impact of vaccines in developing countries, which can be masked by focus on VE alone.

40|$|A framework, which {{combines}} mathematical analysis, closure theory, and phenomenological treatment, is developed {{to study the}} spectral transfer process and reduction of dimensionality in turbulent flows that are subject to rotation. First, we outline a mathematical procedure that is particularly appropriate for problems with two disparate time scales. The approach {{which is based on}} the Green's method leads to the Poincar'e velocity variables and the Poincar'e transformation when applied to rotating turbulence. The effects of the rotation are now reflected in the modifications to the convolution of nonlinear term. The Poincar'e transformed equations are used to obtain a time-dependent analog of the Taylor-Proudman theorem valid in the asymptotic limit when the non-dimensional parameter jΩ t ! 1 (Ω is the rotation rate and t is the time). The `split' of the energy transfer in both direct and <b>inverse</b> <b>directions</b> is established. Secondly, we apply the Eddy-Damped-Quasinormal-Markovian (EDQNM) closure to the Poincar'e transformed Euler/Navier [...] Stokes equations. This closure leads to expressions for the spectral energy transfer. In particular, an unique triple velocity decorrelation time is derived with an explicit dependence on the rotation rate. This provides an important input for applying the phenomenological treatment of Zhou. In order to characterize the relative strength of rotation, another non-dimensional number, a spectral Rossby number, which is defined as the ratio of rotation and turbulence time scales, is introduced. Finally, the energy spectrum and the spectral eddy viscosity are deduced...|$|R

In spite of this, the data concerning the association between allergic rhinitis (AR) and cardiovascular risks is sparse and conflicting. This study aimed to investigate the association between AR prevalence and metabolic syn-drome (MetS) in a large-scale, population-based survey, while considering the relevant risk factors. Methods: A nationwide cross-sectional study was conducted based on data from 30, 590 subjects aged 19 years and older, from the Korean National Health and Nutrition Survey 2007 – 2013. The odds ratios (ORs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) of AR prevalence, based on MetS status and the presence of any MetS component, were calculated using multiple logistic regression analyses. Results: Regarding the characteristics of patients with AR and/or MetS, some variables had significant associations with disease in <b>inverse</b> <b>directions</b> for AR and MetS. Multivariate logistic analysis, with adjustments for demographic variables and health habits, indicated that AR prevalence was significantly lower in subjects with MetS (OR 0. 84; 95 % CI 0. 76 – 0. 93), high blood pressure (OR 0. 85; 95 % CI 0. 77 – 0. 94), or impaired fasting glucose (OR 0. 81; 95 % CI 0. 73 – 0. 89). Furthermore, high blood pressure and impaired fasting glucose were significant predictors for reduced AR prevalence, independently of other MetS components. Conclusion: In this population, AR was diagnosed less frequently in subjects with metabolic conditions. Well-designed prospective studies allowing for medical service utilization and collaborative basic research are warranted to elucidate the mechanism responsible for this inverse relationship...|$|R

40|$|Gain graphs are graphs {{in which}} each edge has a gain (a label from a group, say Γ, so that {{reversing}} the <b>direction,</b> <b>inverses</b> the gain). In this paper we take a generalized view of gain graphs in which the label of an edge {{is related to the}} label of the reverse edge by an involution. Applying selectors to gain graphs is a generalization of vertex-switching (or Seidel switching) of an undirected graph. In this paper we compute the sizes of the resulting equivalence classes of gain graphs. This size can be determined by computing the size of an appropriate subgroup of Γ. We first examine the case that the graph is complete. Then we show how to reduce the general problem to connected graphs and prove that if the graph is connected, but not bipartite, it can be reduced to the complete case. The connected, bipartite case is solved separately. 1 Introduction Gain graphs are graphs {{in which each}} edge has a gain (a label from a group so that reversing the <b>direction,</b> <b>inverses</b> the gain [...] ...|$|R

Current methods of training evaluations are considered, and found to be generally deficient for their lack of between technique comparisons. The {{necessity for}} an outline of planned comparative analysis of training methods is indicated and a method using Gagne's hierarchy of tasks is suggested. A comparison of chaining techniques, forward or inverse, for the learning of a non-verbal serial task is proposed and the superiority of the inverse chaining technique is hypothesized. A machine driven non-verbal maze tracing task is used to train subjects in forward and <b>inverse</b> <b>directions</b> of learning with each direction having the same three levels of pacing for task performance. The maze is presented as two separate spans of seven elements each with ten possible trace alternatives within each element. The two spans are then combined into one 14 element sequence as the final phase of training for whole task performance. Pacing levels impose decision speeds of 4, 5. 7 and 7 seconds per element and all training phases require one error free performance prior to proceeding to the next training phase. Errors, time, and cycles required to achieve criterion are used as performance measures to allow statistical inference of the best performance method. Experimental findings do not support the original hypotheses as forward sequence learning is found to significantly decrease time required for learning at the fastest pacing level and some evidence of fewer cycle starts and errors is determined to be present. Other pacing effects do not achieve acceptable statistical significance levels but some evidence of pacing effects on cycle starts and time are found in the individual span phases of training...|$|R

In particular, we wanted to examine the hypotheses that an endogenous inverse agonist ligand at the GABA-A benzodiazepine receptor (GBzR) is active during withdrawal (in which case flumazenil should be anxiolytic), or whether chronic alcohol intake results in a shift in sensitivity of the receptor in the <b>inverse</b> agonist <b>direction</b> (in which case flumazenil should be anxiogenic). Results from 15 alcohol-dependent subjects in a double-blind placebo-controlled cross-over study showed that flumazenil was neither anxiolytic nor anxiogenic, although withdrawal scores were reduced during the course of the study.
