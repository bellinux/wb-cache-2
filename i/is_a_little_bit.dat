500|$|The film's overall {{structure}} {{was influenced by}} the detective fiction of Raymond Chandler. Ethan said, [...] "We wanted something that would generate a certain narrative feeling – like a modern Raymond Chandler story, and that's why it had to be set in Los Angeles ... We wanted to have a narrative flow, a story that moves like a Chandler book through different parts of town and different social classes." [...] The use of the Stranger's voice-over also came from Chandler as Joel remarked, [...] "He <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> of an audience substitute. In the movie adaptation of Chandler it's the main character that speaks off-screen, but we didn't want to reproduce that though it obviously has echoes. It's as if someone was commenting on the plot from an all-seeing point of view. And at the same time rediscovering the old earthiness of a Mark Twain." ...|$|E

[...] "It's kind of a protected relationship, more like a brother/sister thing than a love interest. They didn’t want to go there, I guess. They did go that way in an earlier draft of the script but they didn’t want it to seem like the cop is like lascivious or something. So what they have now, hopefully, <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> of chemistry {{and you get the}} idea that through tragedy something good will come. So it ends in an optimistic way, that maybe they can be together but there’s no real love story," [...] Landes articulated.|$|E

500|$|The idea of {{the double}} burden is more evolved with the times {{concerning}} both sexes and their newfound roles. The role of a provider and caregiver is sometimes expected of women, but as more women enter the workforce, an 'independent' ideology seems to take effect and forces some women to decide between a career and family. Some may choose strictly one or the other, others may choose to carry the burden of both lifestyles. Some [...] "modern men tend {{to believe in the}} principle of equal sharing of domestic labor, but fail to actually live up to that belief." [...] The constant tug of war regarding one's time and where it could, should but will be spent creates a new speed bump that <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> higher than the previous ones. Modern times illuminate the dilemma that many dual-income couples face when trying to reconcile unpaid domestic work and paid employment. The burden of encompassing both ideologies plays a toll on both sexes in today's societies.|$|E

Previsualization was handled by The Third Floor. All vendors worked on the common magical elements (mandalas, magical runes shields, whips, stalks and aerial 'lily pads', and portals). Visual effects supervisor Stephane Ceretti, who also worked on Guardians of the Galaxy, explained {{the similarities and differences}} between the two films, saying, [...] "there's some resemblance in {{some of the things that}} we've done. In the same way, it's a totally different world. In , it's more sci-fi oriented and crazy colors. More of a comedy kind of take on things as well. This one <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> more serious. It's also a little bit more trippy. We use very different techniques, actually. Guardians was also for us a huge animation film.

When we were breaking that and sussing out what this arc would be, we had to have a lot of the pieces in place from the get go ... we had to talk to features about what their plans were and where they were going." [...] When asked whether this counts as the series tie-in to Guardians of the Galaxy, Whedon said [...] "It is a very far away other galaxy, so it's a little bit harder to have one of them walk into our set, so a direct tie-in <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> more challenging, but it's all one universe, so there's always opportunity for more. ... In Guardians, we saw parts in our universe that we hadn't explored yet, so it shows we're a part of that too."

500|$|The {{episode was}} written by George Meyer and {{directed}} by Jeffrey Lynch. Mike Reiss, show runner of The Simpsons with Al Jean at the time, said Meyer wrote most of the episode by himself without help from the show's other writers. Few changes {{were made to the}} first draft that he pitched to the producers; it was near identical to the final script. The episode was inspired by the vocational tests taken by several members of the show's staff when they went to school; Reiss, for example, said he was told he would become a librarian. Jean said [...] "one of the first things that sold us on doing the episode" [...] was the idea of Bart becoming a policeman. He said it was [...] "a funny, realistic depiction of what a kid like Bart might wind up to become, and it wasn't something you would immediately think of." [...] Jean said the episode deals with the emotion that many adults feel when they grow older and realize that {{they are not going to}} achieve the dreams they once had. [...] " [...] how people in life cope with that problem. Maybe Lisa, at eight years old, <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> young to worry about that, but that's what we were trying to explore here." ...|$|E
500|$|Much of {{the lyrics}} were {{composed}} by Batmanglij and Koenig in Batmanglij's apartment (a former factory building in Brooklyn) and at a rented cottage on Martha's Vineyard. The lyrics explore more mature, world-weary themes such as growing old and disillusionment with American foreign policy. The album eschewed the theme of privileged youth from their first two albums in favor of characters with adult responsibilities and reflections on the passage of time. Faith and mortality are recurring themes on songs such as [...] "Unbelievers", [...] "Worship You", and [...] "Everlasting Arms". Koenig likened their first three albums to Brideshead Revisited: [...] "The naïve joyous school days in the beginning. Then {{the expansion of the}} world, travel, seeing other places, learning {{a little bit more about}} how people live. And then the end <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> of growing up, starting to think more seriously about your life and your faith. If people could look at our three albums as a bildungsroman, I’d be O.K. with that." [...] According to Brice Ezell from PopMatters, Modern Vampires of the City is [...] "very much an indie rock record" [...] because of Koenig's voice and diction, which reveals [...] "the youth that he and his bandmates so often strive to shrug off." [...] Ezell asserts that, on songs such as [...] "Unbelievers", the [...] "reckless abandon" [...] expressed by the lyrics reveals [...] "the group's grasp on the genuine rebellion that indie rock ought to strive for." ...|$|E
500|$|Long-time {{collaborators}} {{and veteran}} Disney writers, Bob Schooley and Mark McCorkle {{had already been}} writing for Disney Channel for several years, contributing to the network's male-led animated series Aladdin, Hercules and Buzz Lightyear of Star Command, each one spin-offs of their respective feature-length animated films. Although they had enjoyed working on those projects, Schooley and McCorkle were becoming interested in contributing to [...] "something original". At the same time, the writers learned that Disney Channel had become interested in developing a show featuring ordinary children in extraordinary circumstances. Thus, the network commissioned Schooley and McCorkle to create an animated series geared towards the nine to 14 year-old demographic that was also capable of entertaining older audiences at the same time. While traveling in an elevator {{on their way back}} to their office from their lunch break, McCorkle said to Schooley, [...] "Kim Possible. She can do anything", to which Schooley responded, [...] "Ron Stoppable, he can’t", and nearly the entire premise of Kim Possible naturally unfolded thereafter. According to Schooley and McCorkle, both lead characters' names indicate that Kim Possible [...] "is going to be an arched show that <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> over the top, but also that the girl {{is going to be the}} action lead and the guy is going to be funny." [...] Conceiving all main characters themselves, Rufus and Wade were eventually created and added to the roster, but the series essentially remains about Kim [...] "who is incredibly competent in the action world but challenged in the real world" [...] while [...] "Ron would be challenged everywhere." ...|$|E

Scott of At The Movies also {{compared}} his {{viewing of}} the film to {{the first time he}} viewed Star Wars and he said [...] "although the script <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit...</b> obvious," [...] it was [...] "part of what made it work". Todd McCarthy of Variety praised the film, saying [...] "The King of the World sets his sights on creating another world entirely in Avatar, and it's very much a place worth visiting." [...] Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter gave the film a positive review. [...] "The screen is alive with more action and the soundtrack pops with more robust music than any dozen sci-fi shoot-'em-ups you care to mention," [...] he stated. Peter Travers of Rolling Stone awarded Avatar a three-and-a-half out of four star rating and wrote in his print review [...] "It extends the possibilities of what movies can do. Cameron's talent may just be as big as his dreams." [...] Richard Corliss of Time magazine thought that the film was [...] "the most vivid and convincing creation of a fantasy world ever seen in the history of moving pictures." [...] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times thought the film has [...] "powerful" [...] visual accomplishments but [...] "flat dialogue" [...] and [...] "obvious characterization". James Berardinelli of ReelViews praised the film and its story, giving it four out of four stars; he wrote [...] "In 3-D, it's immersive– but the traditional film elements– story, character, editing, theme, emotional resonance, etc.– are presented with sufficient expertise to make even the 2-D version an engrossing 2½-hour experience." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{idea for}} The Lion King was {{conceived}} in late 1988 during {{a conversation between}} Jeffrey Katzenberg, Roy E. Disney and Peter Schneider {{on a plane to}} Europe to promote Oliver & Company. During the conversation, the topic of a story set in Africa came up, and Katzenberg immediately jumped at the idea. The idea was then developed by Walt Disney Feature Animation's vice president for creative affairs Charlie Fink. Katzenberg decided to add elements involving coming of age and death, and ideas from personal life experiences, such as some of his trials in his bumpy road in politics, saying about the film, [...] "It <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> about myself." [...] In November of that year Thomas Disch (author of The Brave Little Toaster) wrote a treatment entitled King of the Kalahari, and afterwards, Linda Woolverton spent a year writing drafts of the script, which was titled King of the Beasts and then King of the Jungle. The original version of the film was very different from the final film. The plot was centered in a battle being between lions and baboons with Scar being the leader of the baboons, Rafiki being a cheetah, and Timon and Pumbaa being Simba's childhood friends. Simba would also not leave the kingdom but become a [...] "lazy, slovenly, horrible character" [...] due to manipulations from Scar, so Simba could be overthrown after coming of age. By 1990, producer Thomas Schumacher, who had just completed The Rescuers Down Under, decided to attach himself to the project [...] "because lions are cool". Schumacher likened the script for King of the Jungle to [...] "an animated National Geographic special".|$|E
