5|$|Is This It {{was named}} the best album of 2001 by Billboard, CMJ, Entertainment Weekly, NME, Playlouder, and Time. Magnet, Q, and The New Yorker {{included}} it in their respective unnumbered shortlists of the best records issued that year. It figured highly in other end-of-year best album lists: at number two by The Herald, at number three by Mojo, at number five by The New York Times, at number eight by Rolling Stone and by USA Today, at number nine by The Boston Phoenix, and at number ten by <b>Kludge.</b> The record featured at number two behind Bob Dylan's Love and Theft in The Village Voices 2001 Pazz & Jop critics' poll, which aggregated the votes of 621prominent reviewers. In 2002, Is This It was named Best Album at the NME Awards and Best International Album at the Meteor Music Awards. It was nominated in the latter category at the Brit Awards, where the Strokes won Best International Newcomer and received a nomination in the Best International Group category. The same year, the quintet won Band Of The Year and Best New Act at the NME Awards and was nominated in the latter category at the MTV Europe Music Awards.|$|E

Jeremy Gladstone of <b>Kludge</b> commented that the album reaches its peak with [...] "Buddha for Mary", which he called a [...] "virtual sonic achievement", but felt that the quality of the songs drops off at the halfway point, {{describing}} the entire project as [...] "top-heavy". Canadian critic Karin Lowachee found the group's sound and vision reminiscent of their [...] "concept-styled forbears" [...] but [...] "uniquely owned" [...] for a contemporary audience, and wrote that the band [...] "defies the trend by stepping out ahead of it and into the future", giving the listener something original to enjoy.

Rhyannon Rodriguez from <b>Kludge</b> wrote that the album feels [...] "a little forced", describing the overall sounds as [...] "overtly weak". Alexis Petridis, writing in The Guardian, said {{that some of the}} songs are [...] "mostly beautifully turned", but marred by lyrics that are [...] "so devoid of personality that they sound less like song lyrics". Pitchforks Joe Tangari called it [...] "bland but never offensive, listenable but not memorable." [...] Mojo wrote that the album is [...] "awash with cliches, non-sequiturs, and cheap existentialism; at times it all becomes nigh on unbearable". In a negative review for The Village Voice, Robert Christgau named X [...] "dud of the month" [...] and called Coldplay a [...] "precise, bland, and banal" [...] band, giving the album a B grade.|$|E

Taylor of AllMusic {{considered}} {{the release of}} 30 Seconds to Mars a [...] "daring new step in musical evolution" [...] and noted that its impact left [...] "vast corridors of sound open for the listener to meander down at will". He commented that Thirty Seconds to Mars managed to record an album that [...] "breathes life" [...] into the [...] "empty shell that corporate rock has become", and felt that in [...] "reanimating an avenue of musical expression that has for many years been on its deathbed", the band possibly offered the best rock experience of 2002. 30 Seconds to Mars was {{named one of the}} best albums of 2002 by a number of publications, including CMJ New Music Report, <b>Kludge,</b> Melodic, and Metal Hammer. Johan Wippsson of Melodic regarded it as [...] "one of the most unique album when it comes to an own style", while music critic Megan O'Toole from The Gazette felt that the band managed to [...] "carve out a unique niche for themselves in the rock realm".|$|E

In the Chicago Sun-Times, critic Jim DeRogatis gave the record four out of four stars and called it [...] "a near-classic right out of the gate, an urgent, raucous and thought-provoking 70 minutes that mine the musical territory between hard hip-hop and smoother Philly soul". Blenders RJ Smith called it [...] "a celebration of self-determination, a nonstop joyride through some very complicated brains". Jeremy Gladstone from <b>Kludge</b> felt the Roots had combined [...] "complicated beats" [...] with [...] "complex lyrics" [...] to produce a [...] "shockingly honest sound". In The Guardian, Alexis Petridis found the group [...] "exclusively capable of absorbing other genres", while the [...] "more straightforward hip-hop" [...] is [...] "idiosyncratic and hugely enjoyable".

5000|$|In modern {{computing}} terminology, a <b>kludge</b> (or often a [...] "hack") is {{a solution}} to a problem, doing a task, or fixing {{a system that is}} inefficient, inelegant or even unfathomable, but which nevertheless (more or less) works. To <b>kludge</b> around something is to avoid a bug or some difficult condition by building a <b>kludge,</b> perhaps relying on properties of the bug itself to assure proper operation. It is somewhat similar in spirit to a workaround, only without the grace. A <b>kludge</b> is often used to change the behavior of a system after it is finished, without having to make fundamental changes. Sometimes the <b>kludge</b> is introduced in order to keep backwards compatibility, but often it is simply introduced because the <b>kludge</b> is an easier alternative. Note that a hack might be a <b>kludge,</b> but that hack could be, at least in computing, ironic praise, for a quick fix solution to a frustrating problem.|$|E

5000|$|Within the {{computer}} programmer subculture of hackers, the term hacker {{is also used}} for a programmer who reaches a goal by employing a series of modifications to extend existing code or resources. In this sense, it can have a negative connotation of using inelegant <b>kludges</b> to accomplish programming tasks that are quick, but ugly, inelegant, difficult to extend, hard to maintain and inefficient. This derogatory form of the noun [...] "hack" [...] derives from the everyday English sense [...] "to cut or shape by or as if by crude or ruthless strokes" [...] Merriam-Webster and is even used among users of the positive sense of [...] "hacker" [...] who produces [...] "cool" [...] or [...] "neat" [...] hacks. In other words, to [...] "hack" [...] at an original creation, as if with an axe, is to force-fit it into being usable for a task not intended by the original creator, and a [...] "hacker" [...] would be someone who does this habitually. (The original creator and the hacker may be the same person.) This usage is common in both programming, engineering and building. In programming, hacking in this sense appears to be tolerated and seen as a necessary compromise in many situations. Some argue {{that it should not}} be, due to this negative meaning; others argue that some <b>kludges</b> can, for all their ugliness and imperfection, still have [...] "hack value".|$|R

40|$|Modularity {{is a key}} {{concept in}} {{building}} and evaluating complex simulation models. My main claim is that in simulation modeling modularity degenerates for systematic methodological reasons. Consequently, it is hard, if not impossible, to accessing how representational (inner mathematical) structure and dynamical properties of a model are related. The resulting problem for validating models is one of holism. The argument will proceed by analyzing the techniques of parameterization, tuning, and <b>kludging.</b> They are – {{to a certain extent}} – inevitable when building complex simulation models, but corrode modularity. As a result, the common account of validating simulations faces a major problem and testing the dynamical behavior of simulation models becomes all the more important.

During {{the last fifty years}} embedded analog and digital engineering have evolved and changed significantly. However our mathematical and scientific theories remained in the original state.

It consisted of academic papers, detailed technical projects, interviews and documented pieces of artwork. He then categorised the information into specific topics thereby producing multiple booklets. The booklet itself is a testament to critical making. It was printed using a hacked photocopier and roughly 100,000 pages were manually folded and stapled to create 300 copies of 10 booklets each. The publication asks us to look at aspects of the DIY culture that go beyond buying an Arduino, getting a MakerBot and reducing DIY to a weekend hobby. These books embrace social issues, the history of technology, activism and politics. The project also stems from a specific disappointment.
