5000|$|While {{this was}} a big step for Apple, their concern for {{environmental}} well-being has continued to grow. In 1997, the first Apple products were tested for conformity to TCO (Swedish Confederation of Professional Employees) standards. TCO standards involve requirements that cover a variety of issues: environment, ergonomics, usability, emission of electrical and magnetic fields, and energy consumption and electrical fire safety. For example, environmental demands restrict the use of heavy metals, chlorinated solvents, and other various things. Mainly, products that are labeled must meet these environmental demands.Two years after Apple agreed to meet TCO’s standards, in 1999, Apple introduced [...] "Apple Product Environmental Specifications (APES) files," [...] in which lead and cadmium in cables were restricted. Shortly after, in 2000, all of Apple’s manufacturing sites became ISO 14001 certified worldwide. This accredited that Apple had a structured environmental management system (EMS) in order to manage environmental impact of their operations.In 2001, Apple computers and displays first met ENERGY STAR requirements, in which they voluntarily phased out tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA) in all their plastic <b>enclosure</b> <b>parts</b> greater than 25 grams. They also began to purchase 100 percent of electricity for the Austin facility from renewable sources, called Austin’s [...] "Green Choice" [...] Power Program.|$|E

40|$|A {{study of}} {{southern}} pudu (Pudu puda) was {{performed at the}} zoo Nordens Ark in Bohuslän, Sweden during twelve days in Mars and April 2014. Observations were performed during twilight. Time budget and enclosure use was examined, when the animals {{had access to the}} whole enclosure of 1000 m 2 or a smaller <b>part</b> of the <b>enclosure</b> of 200 m 2. There was almost no difference in time budget between the two enclosure sizes. At both enclosure sizes the animals spent most of the time at a place that was hidden from outside the enclosure. The hidden place was situated in the house. Also {{the rest of the house}} was a place where the animals spent a lot of time. The big <b>enclosure</b> <b>part,</b> the <b>part</b> of the <b>enclosure</b> that the animals did not have access to in the 200 m 2 enclosure, was more rocky and hilly, which might have been features the animals preferred. Another reason to the preference of the big <b>enclosure</b> <b>part</b> might have been that the animals didn’t have access to that <b>part</b> of the <b>enclosure</b> the whole time and therefor found it more exciting. The three small shelters in the enclosure were seldom used. The shelter that was used the most was located in the <b>part</b> of the <b>enclosure</b> the animals didn’t have access to when they were in the small enclosure. The pudus seemed to be affected by not always having access to the whole enclosure, but additional observations are desired to ensure chance didn’t impact on the results. In the future it would be interesting to do a follow-up to study the animals at different times of the day. It would also be interesting to study enrichments to see if the animals would like to spend more time in other places than the house if the rest of the enclosure was enriched...|$|R

50|$|Traditionally, {{the first}} time the thermal design of the {{equipment}} is verified is after a prototype has been built. The device is powered up, perhaps inside an environmental chamber, and temperatures of the critical parts of the system are measured using sensors such as thermocouples. If any problems are discovered, the project is delayed while a solution is sought. A change to the design of a PCB or <b>enclosure</b> <b>part</b> may be required to fix the issue, which will take time and cost a significant amount of money. If thermal simulation is used as part of the design process of the equipment, thermal design issue will be identified before a prototype is built. Fixing an issue at the design stage is both quicker and cheaper than modifying the design after a prototype is created.|$|R

30|$|However, {{the use of}} <b>enclosures</b> as <b>part</b> of {{an ongoing}} {{privatization}} of land does not only provide opportunities for new livelihood strategies. Many of the respondents told stories about {{people who do not}} have access to enclosed land and who have to resort to unsustainable harvesting of firewood on government land to make ends meet, and of emerging conflicts in the form of boundary disputes, livestock trespassing on enclosed land and internal family disputes related to land use and land ownership.|$|R
50|$|Subsequent changes {{included}} the <b>enclosure</b> of <b>part</b> {{of the front}} verandah {{and the construction of}} a lean-to laundry building on the west. These additions have recently been removed. Nothing remains of the laundry except for an area of concrete slab on the ground {{at the foot of the}} steps. Sheet lining to the early bathroom and to the ceiling of the rear verandah has been removed, floors sanded and the whole building painted. The early timber outhouse and shed remain.|$|R

50|$|Hornbill Hill was a {{steep and}} narrow pathway that {{featured}} enclosures for Waldrapp ibis, southern ground hornbill, black hornbill, red-billed blue magpie {{and at the}} top of the hill there is an enclosure that has previously held snow leopard, fossa, giant anteater and various New World monkeys and an African aviary that normally holds purple gallinule, hamerkop, Von der Decken's hornbill and curlew. There is also a small hidden enclosure for Geoffroy's cat. The Hornbill Hill aviaries, Geoffroy's cat <b>enclosure</b> and <b>part</b> of the Medellin Monkeys exhibit have all been demolished to make way for the new sun bear enclosure.|$|R
50|$|The Wright Earthworks {{consist of}} a {{fragment}} of a geometrically near-perfect square <b>enclosure</b> and <b>part</b> of one wall that originally formed a set of parallel embankments, which travelled from the enclosure to a large oval yard. The Newark square's sides formerly ranged from about 940 ft to 940 ft in length, enclosing a total area of about 20 acres. Farming and construction, associated with building the Ohio Canal and the streets and houses {{of the city of}} Newark, destroyed much of the square enclosure and its associated mounds. The remaining segment of one wall of the square is less than 200 ft long.|$|R
50|$|Most of the {{buildings}} associated with the asylum were relocated or demolished with {{the closure of the}} facility in 1947. The mess hall however survived this period and has since been used as the Dunwich Public Hall. During that period the building has remained remarkably intact with the only significant building additions being the <b>enclosure</b> of <b>part</b> of the verandah to accommodate toilets and the construction of an interior stage. Most recently the earlier verandah enclosure was removed and new toilet facilities established in a separate building connected to the hall by way of a timber battened breezeway.|$|R
50|$|In {{the move}} towards safer {{installations}} of PV systems, {{whether it be}} in a domestic or industrial environment, consideration has to often {{be given to the}} materials and the risk of fire hazard that they pose. Ratings referred to under the UL 94 category are deemed generally acceptable for compliance with this requirement as this cover tests for flammability of polymeric materials used for parts in devices and appliances. Although there are 12 flame classifications specified in UL 94, there are 6 which relate to materials commonly used in manufacturing <b>enclosures,</b> structural <b>parts</b> and insulators found in consumer electronic products. These are 5VA, 5VB, V-0, V-1, V-2 and HB.|$|R

2500|$|The chapel was {{repaired}} {{and partly}} rebuilt in 1898 by the Marquess of Bute, its main features being preserved. The present ruins are rectangular, measuring internally 31' x 16' 6". This building was probably erected {{to replace a}} 12th-early 13th century chapel, whose foundations were found during excavations and consisted of a nave, 17' 6" [...] x 16' 6" [...] with a square chancel. The chapel stood within a contemporary <b>enclosure</b> wall, <b>part</b> of which is still standing.
