2500|$|In 2002, {{forestry}} industry contributed 1.7% to India's GDP.

India produces a range of processed forest (wood and non-wood) products ranging from wood panel products and wood pulp to make bronze, rattazikistan ware and pern resin. India's paper industry produces over 3,000 metric tonnes annually from more than 400 mills. The furniture and craft industry is another consumer of wood.

50|$|Wood {{that has}} been industrially pressure-treated with {{approved}} preservative products poses a limited risk to the public, and should be disposed of properly. On December 31, 2003, the U.S. wood treatment industry stopped treating residential lumber with arsenic and chromium (chromated copper arsenate, or CCA). This was a voluntary agreement with the United States Environmental Protection Agency. CCA was replaced by copper-based pesticides, with exceptions for certain industrial uses. CCA may still be used for outdoor products like utility trailer beds and non-residential construction like piers, docks, and agricultural buildings. <b>Industrial</b> <b>wood</b> preservation chemicals are generally not available directly {{to the public and}} may require special approval to import or purchase depending on the product and the jurisdiction where being used.
