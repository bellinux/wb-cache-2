40|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown an {{increase}} in alcohol use in New York City {{in the months after}} the September 11 terrorist attacks; thus far there have been no studies documenting changes in <b>drinking</b> <b>problems.</b> In 2002, a random digit dial phone survey was conducted of residents of New York City. This study provided us with estimates of the prevalence of alcohol <b>drinking</b> <b>problems</b> among residents of New York City 6 months after September 11 compared with the 6 months before September 11. Among 1, 570 adults, the prevalence of <b>drinking</b> <b>problems</b> was 3. 7 % in the 6 months before September 11 and 4. 2 % in the 6 months after September 11. The incidence of <b>drinking</b> <b>problems</b> among those without <b>drinking</b> <b>problems</b> before September 11 was 2. 2 %. Persons with incident <b>drinking</b> <b>problems</b> were more likely than those without to report symptoms consistent with posttraumatic stress disorder (17. 4 % vs. 0. 4 % in those without <b>drinking</b> <b>problems</b> and 1. 4 % in nondrinkers), and depression (23. 5 % vs 5. 6 % vs. 4. 9 %, respectively) after September 11.

40|$|Social {{learning}} theory (Abrams & Niaura, 1987) assumes {{that individuals who}} lack effective coping strategies {{are more likely to}} drink in response to stressful situations. A review of the literature suggests that coping strategies have not typically been studied {{in the context of a}} specific theory of alcohol abuse. Consequently, little progress has been made in the understanding of possible links between alcohol abuse and the use of coping strategies. The primary objective of the present study was to assess whether <b>drinking</b> <b>problems</b> are associated with specific coping strategies. Coping strategies were defined according to the coping models of Lazarus and Folkman (1984), Tobin, Holroyd, Reynolds and Wigal (1989) and Rosenbaum (1980). It was hypothesized that students with <b>drinking</b> <b>problems,</b> in comparison to students with no <b>drinking</b> <b>problems,</b> would report engaging less in self-control and problem-focused strategies and more in avoidant coping strategies. A secondary objective was to determine whether these coping characteristics are associated with a family history of <b>drinking</b> <b>problems,</b> a risk factor for <b>drinking</b> <b>problems.</b> One hundred and eighty-nine male university students completed screening questionnaires about their alcohol and drug consumption and about the drinking behaviors of their family members. Students accepted for this study met the criteria for one of the following groups: (a) no family history of <b>drinking</b> <b>problems</b> (FH$-$) and no <b>drinking</b> <b>problems,</b> (b) FH$-$ and <b>drinking</b> <b>problems,</b> (c) family history of <b>drinking</b> <b>problems</b> (FH+) and no <b>drinking</b> <b>problems,</b> or (d) FH+ and <b>drinking</b> <b>problems.</b> Students completed self-report questionnaires on the reactions they experience in stressful situations. Self-control strategies were assessed by the Self-Control Schedule (Rosenbaum, 1980), and task-oriented and avoidant strategies by the Coping Inventory for Stressful Situations (Endler & Parker, 1990 a). The last questionnaire was repeated for three different situations: (a) negative emotion, (b) interpersonal conflict, and (c) pressure to drink. Multivariate analyses of variance showed that students with <b>drinking</b> <b>problems,</b> in comparison to students without <b>drinking</b> <b>problems,</b> reported engaging less in self-control and task-oriented coping strategies. However, students with <b>drinking</b> <b>problems</b> did not report engaging more in avoidant strategies. This finding was contrasted with the results of other studies in which avoidant strategies were found to be related to alcohol abuse. Finally, there were no significant differences in coping between FH+ students and FH$-$ students. The potential relevance of coping to a model of alcohol abuse was discussed as well as its practical implications. For example, students with <b>drinking</b> <b>problems</b> might benefit from being taught task-oriented strategies and self-control skills, in addition to specific skills to reduce drinking...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{tested a}} path {{model of the}} {{relationships}} of reasons for drinking and reasons for limiting drinking with consumption of alcohol and <b>drinking</b> <b>problems.</b> It was hypothesized that reasons for drinking would be composed of positively and negatively reinforcing reasons, and that reasons for limiting drinking would be composed of personal and social reasons. <b>Problem</b> <b>drinking</b> was operationalized as consisting of two factors, consumption and <b>drinking</b> <b>problems,</b> with {{a positive relationship between}} the two. It was predicted that positively and negatively reinforcing reasons for drinking would be associated with heavier consumption and, in turn, more <b>drinking</b> <b>problems,</b> through level of consumption. Negatively reinforcing reasons were also predicted to be associated with <b>drinking</b> <b>problems</b> directly, independent of level of consumption. It was hypothesized that reasons for limiting drinking would be associated with lower levels of consumption and would be related to fewer <b>drinking</b> <b>problems,</b> through level of consumption. Finally, among women, reasons for limiting drinking were expected to be associated with <b>drinking</b> <b>problems</b> directly, independent of level of consumption. The sample, was taken from {{the second phase of the}} Niagara Young Aduh Health Study, a community sample of young adult men and women. Measurement models of reasons for drinking, reasons for limiting <b>drinking,</b> and <b>problem</b> <b>drinking</b> were tested using Confirmatory Factor Analysis. After adequate fit of each measurement model was obtained, the complete structural model, with all hypothesized paths, was tested for goodness of fit. Cross-group equality constraints were imposed on all models to test for gender differences. The results provided evidence supporting the hypothesized structure of reasons for <b>drinking</b> and <b>problem</b> <b>drinking.</b> A single factor model of reasons for limiting drinking was used in the analyses because a two-factor model was inadequate. Support was obtained for the structural model. For example, the resuhs revealed independent influences of Positively Reinforcing Reasons for Drinking, Negatively Reinforcing Reasons for Drinking, and Reasons for Limiting Drinking on consumption. In addition. Negatively Reinforcing Reasons helped to account for <b>Drinking</b> <b>Problems</b> independent of the amount of alcohol consumed. Although an additional path from Reasons for Limiting <b>Drinking</b> to <b>Drinking</b> <b>Problems</b> was hypothesized for women, it was of marginal significance and did not improve the model's fit. As a result, no sex differences in the model were found. This may be a result of the convergence of drinking patterns for men and women. Furthermore, it is suggested that gender differences may only be found in clinical samples of problem drinkers, where the relative level of consumption for women and men is similar...|$|R

40|$|Mood {{has been}} {{commonly}} {{viewed as an}} important determinant of drinking, but studies {{of positive and negative}} affect and alcohol use have reported inconsistent results. It has been suggested that the relationship between negative affect and heavy <b>drinking</b> or <b>drinking</b> <b>problems</b> depends on individual vulnerability dimensions such as personality. Gray’s Reinforcement Sensitivity Theory (RST) may provide a particularly useful framework in studies about alcohol use, connecting personality, motivational processes, and responses to environmental stimuli. In past studies, the sensitivity of Gray’s Behavioral Activation System (BAS) has been linked to alcohol use, but results have been less consistent for the Behavioral Inhibition System (BIS). The aim {{of this study was to}} test the relationships among the BAS/BIS, life events, affect, and alcohol use in college students. Considering the methodological limitations in previous studies, two studies were performed. In Study 1, 317 college students who reported alcohol use in the previous 6 months completed self-report measures of the BAS/BIS, life events, affect, and alcohol use (e. g., frequency of alcohol use, alcohol-related problems). BAS sensitivity was significantly related to heavy drinking, but not to <b>drinking</b> <b>problems.</b> Conversely, BIS sensitivity was positively and significantly associated with <b>drinking</b> <b>problems,</b> but negatively with heavy drinking. In the path analysis, the path from the BAS to heavy drinking was significant, and the path from the BAS to <b>drinking</b> <b>problems</b> was marginally and indirectly significant via the path from heavy <b>drinking</b> to <b>drinking</b> <b>problems.</b> Conversely, the path from the interaction between the BIS and negative life events to <b>drinking</b> <b>problems</b> was indirectly significant via negative affect, and the path from the interaction between the BIS and negative life events to heavy <b>drinking</b> <b>problems</b> was marginally and negatively significant via negative affect. In Study 2, 134 college students who showed either BAS or BIS dominance were recruited and randomly assigned to the reward or punishment task. The BAS-dominant subgroup assigned to the reward task and the BIS-dominant subgroup assigned to the punishment task showed higher urge to drink than other subgroups. The BAS-dominant subgroup assigned to the reward task did not show a higher positive urge to drink than other subgroups, while the BIS-dominant subgroup assigned to the punishment task showed a higher negative urge to drink than other subgroups. The results lend correlational and experimental support to the idea that both BAS and BIS sensitivity are related to alcohol use. Further, this study clarified differential paths to alcohol use for the BAS and BIS: BAS sensitivity motivates drinking in response to reward, while BIS sensitivity enhances vulnerability to drinking in response to negative affect. ...|$|R
