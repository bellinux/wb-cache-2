5|$|Efforts {{to control}} the spread of malaria {{suffered}} a major setback in 1930: entomologist Raymond Corbett Shannon discovered imported disease-bearing Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes living in Brazil (DNA analysis later revealed the actual species to be A. arabiensis). This species of mosquito is a particularly efficient vector for malaria and is native to Africa. In 1938, the introduction of this vector caused the greatest epidemic of malaria <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> the New World. However, complete eradication of A. gambiae from northeast Brazil and thus from the New World was achieved in 1940 by the systematic application of the arsenic-containing compound Paris green to breeding places, and of pyrethrum spray-killing to adult resting places.|$|E
5|$|Many of the {{original}} Maine Coon cats that inhabited the New England area possessed a trait known as polydactylism (having one or more extra toes on the feet). While some sources claim that trait {{is thought to have}} occurred in approximately 40% of the Maine Coon population in Maine at one time, little evidence has been given to substantiate this claim. Polydactylism is rarely, if <b>ever,</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> Maine Coons in the show ring since it is unacceptable by competition standards. The gene for polydactylism is a simple autosomal dominant gene, which has shown to pose no threat to the cat's health. The trait was almost eradicated from the breed {{due to the fact that}} it was an automatic disqualifier in show rings. Private organizations and breeders were created in order to keep polydactylism in Maine Coons from disappearing.|$|E

5|$|While the {{hurricane}} {{was over the}} open ocean, it produced large swells that caused the deaths of three people two in the Caribbean {{and one in the}} United States. As it passed west of Bermuda as a minimal hurricane, damage was limited primarily to trees and power lines, with roughly 27,500residences losing electricity. Total losses in the territory were less than US$500,000. However, in Newfoundland, Igor wrought extreme damage, claimed to be the worst <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> some areas. Large stretches of roadways were completely washed out by flooding, including a portion of the Trans-Canada Highway, isolating approximately 150communities. Throughout the region, one person was killed and damage costs amounted to a record C$200million. In the storm's wake, military personnel were deployed to assist in recovery efforts and aid distribution.|$|E
5|$|As {{it moved}} inland, however, Alice {{produced}} prolific rains along {{and near the}} Rio Grande, resulting {{in some of the}} worst flooding <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> parts of northern Mexico and southern Texas; in some areas, the flooding amounted to a one-in-1,000-year event. The Pecos River crested at , which joined with the Rio Grande to produce significant flooding. The floods destroyed bridges and dikes and flooded many cities along the inner reaches of the river, which reached its highest water levels since 1865. As the river overflowed its banks, floods breached the dikes at Piedras Negras, Coahuila, destroying large sections of the town. Other communities in Mexico reported significant flood damage. In the United States, damage was heaviest in Ozona, Texas, where the floods killed 15people and caused $2million in damage (1954USD). Rainfall peaked at over , most of which fell in a 24‑hour period. In all, flooding from Hurricane Alice killed at least 55 people, including 17 in the U.S. and 38 in Mexico, though many deaths in rural Mexico may have gone unreported; the total death toll could have exceeded 150.|$|E
5|$|Its {{writing was}} {{consistently}} praised by reviewers. The narrative was considered deep, successfully using White Wolf's Vampire: The Masquerade content. Eurogamer {{said that it}} had the best script the website had <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> a video game, and others {{described it as a}} superbly crafted tale of conspiracies, underworld subterfuge, fun and intrigue. Reviewers appreciated the use of adult themes, such as sex and death, in the storyline of a contemporary video game, which no other games had tackled with similar effectiveness. The mature themes succeeded without being gratuitous or exploitative, and were explored honestly and intelligently by a knowledgeable writer. The game's characters were praised for their memorable, developed personalities, with most major characters possessing their own backstory and presented as living people instead of ciphers. Its ending had a mixed response, with some reviewers appreciating their ability to choose one of the game's four endings (adding an incentive to replay the game) and others considering the ending anti-climatic.|$|E
