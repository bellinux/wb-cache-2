They parked on the {{underground}} B-2 level. Yousef ignited the 20-foot fuse, and fled. Twelve minutes later, at 12:17:37p.m., the bomb exploded in the underground garage, generating an estimated pressure of 150,000 psi. The bomb opened a 30-m (98ft) wide hole through four sublevels of concrete. The <b>detonation</b> <b>velocity</b> of this bomb was about 15,000ft/s (4.5km/s). Initial news reports indicated a main transformer may have blown, before {{it became clear that}} a bomb had exploded in the basement.|$|E

Effects of {{addition}} of boron (B) particles on performances of RDX-based plastic bonded explosives (PBX) {{have been evaluated}} with regard to prevention against Neumann effect from simulated devices for high explosive anti tank warheads, through measurements of penetration lengths during steel plate penetration tests for PBX samples with various B contents of up to 10 wt%. <b>Detonation</b> <b>velocities,</b> sensitivities against heat and impact, and mechanical properties have also been examined for PBX samples tested: <b>detonation</b> <b>velocities</b> were measured by using a high-speed photographic method; sensitivity against heat was evaluated through Krupp ignition temperature test; sensitivity against impact was evaluated through 5 kg-drop hammer test; and tensile and compression stresses have been measured with regard to mechanical properties. Although there were only slight changes in <b>detonation</b> <b>velocities</b> and in suppression abilities in steel plate penetration lengths when up to 5 wt % B particles were added, improvements have been observed in both aspects, when weight content of B particles increased by up to 10 wt%, even though PBX samples were observed to become more sensitive against heat and impact; and experimental values for tensile and compression stresses of PBX samples have also increased {{with the increase in}} weight content of B particles...|$|R

40|$|The Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory CHEETAH 2. 0 {{program has}} been used to analyse a number of {{conventional}} ideal explosive ingredients, ideal explosive compositions, non-ideal explosive compositions, and new and proposed explosives.

40|$|<b>Detonation</b> <b>velocities</b> {{for high}} {{explosives}} {{can be in}} the 7 to 8 km/s range. Previous work has shown that these velocities may be measured by inserting an optical fiber probe into the explosive assembly and recording the velocity time history using a Fabry-Perot velocimeter. The measured velocity using this method, however, is the actual velocity multiplied times the refractive index of the fiber core, which is on the order of 1. 5. This means that the velocimeter diagnostic must be capable of measuring velocities as high as 12 km/s. Until recently, a velocity of 12 km/s was beyond the maximum velocity limit of a homodyne-based velocimeter. The limiting component in a homodyne system is usually the digitizer. Recently, however, digitizers have come on the market with 20 GHz bandwidth and 50 GS/s sample rate. Such a digitizer coupled with high bandwidth detectors now have the total bandwidth required to make velocity measurements in the 12 km/s range. This paper describes measurements made of <b>detonation</b> <b>velocities</b> using a high bandwidth homodyne system...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this work {{is to improve the}} robustness and accuracy of numerical simulations of both ideal and non-ideal explosives by introducing temperature dependence in mechanical equations of state for reactants and products. To this end, we modify existing mechanical equations of state to appropriately approximate the temperature in the reaction zone. Mechanical equations of state of Mie-Grüneisen form are developed with extensions, which allow the temperature to be evaluated appropriately, and the temperature equilibrium condition to be applied robustly. Furthermore the snow plow model is used to capture the effect of porosity on the reactants equation of state. We apply the methodology to predict the velocity of compliantly confined detonation waves. Once reaction rates are calibrated for unconfined <b>detonation</b> <b>velocities,</b> simulations of confined rate sticks and slabs are performed, and the experimental <b>detonation</b> <b>velocities</b> are matched without further parameter alteration, demonstrating the predictive capability of our simulations.

There {{is no need to}} use the assumption of full and partial equilibrium of aluminum powder in reaction zones in the new approach. In this work the best agreement with experimental data was obtained by adjusting the parameter k in the Becker– Kistiakosky–Wilson equations of state (BKW-EOS). The <b>detonation</b> pressure and <b>velocity</b> values calculated by the present method agree well with the experimental results.
