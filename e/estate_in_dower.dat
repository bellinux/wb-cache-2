500|$|Since Suffolk {{had never}} been {{formally}} convicted, he was not attainted, but the royal grants which had given John de la Pole such good prospects were now [...] to the crown. And although John inherited his father's dukedom of Suffolk, he had lost the various offices that he had held, such as the Constableship of Wallingford Castle. On top of this, due to his mother retaining one-third of his father's <b>estate</b> <b>in</b> <b>dower,</b> his expectations from the dukedom {{could only have been}} even smaller. His income has been estimated at less than £280 per annum, which was less than the minimum required for an earl, let alone a duke.|$|E

50|$|He {{was twice}} married, {{the name of}} his first wife being Isabella, and that of his second Petronilla. At the date of his death he was possessed of <b>estates</b> <b>in</b> Devonshire, Middlesex, Hertfordshire, Essex, Wiltshire, and Hampshire. His wife Petronilla and a son, Edmund, {{thirteen}} years old, survived him. Petronilla was life-tenant of a portion of the <b>estates</b> <b>in</b> right of <b>dower.</b> She died <b>in</b> 1342. The last male representative of the family, Sir William de Benstede, died in 1485.|$|R
60|$|Lord Roehampton {{had a large}} entailed estate, {{though his}} affairs were always {{in a state of}} confusion. That seems almost the {{inevitable}} result of being absorbed in the great business of governing mankind. If there be exceptions among statesmen of the highest class, they will generally be found among those who have been chiefly in opposition, and so have had leisure and freedom of mind sufficient to manage their estates. Lord Roehampton had, however, extensive powers of charging his <b>estate</b> <b>in</b> lieu of <b>dower,</b> and he had employed them to their utmost extent; so his widow was well provided for. The executors were Mr. Sidney Wilton and Endymion.|$|R
50|$|In 1271-2, Robert {{obtained}} {{the hand of}} Marjorie of Carrick, the young widowed heiress of Niall of Carrick, 2nd Earl of Carrick for his son, also called Robert de Brus. Around this time his first wife Isabella de Clare of Gloucester and Hertford dies, the date is unknown as she's last recorded receiving a gift of deer from King Henry in Essex, in 1271, but on the 3 May 1273 Robert married Christina de Ireby, the Widow of Adam Jesmond, the Sheriff of Northumberland. The marriage added <b>estates</b> <b>in</b> Cumberland and <b>dower</b> land from her previous husband, to the Brus holdings. Following the marriage Robert appears to have restricted himself to {{the management of the}} family's northern possessions, leaving the southern to his sons'.|$|R

50|$|Around {{this time}} his mother died, the date is unknown {{but on the}} 3 May 1273 his father married Christina de Ireby, the Widow of Adam Jesmond, the Sheriff of Northumberland, at Hoddam. The {{marriage}} added <b>estates</b> <b>in</b> Cumberland and <b>dower</b> land from her previous husband, to the Brus holdings. The younger Robert and his step-mother {{do not appear to}} have got on, with Robert recorded as trying to withhold dower lands, after his father's death in 1295. This {{may be one of the}} reasons why the Father appears to have independently managed the possessions in the North, as well as intermittently holding the position of Constable of Carlisle, while Robert appears to have confined himself largely to the management of the southern and midland possessions, with his brother Richard who independently held Tottenham and Kempston, as well as commanding a Knight banneret for Edward. Richard is recorded as receiving a number of wards and gifts of deer and to have sought permission to empark the forest at Writtle at this time. Robert, while not part of Edward's household, became an envoy and mouthpiece for Alexander III at court, swearing fealty on Alexander's behalf, to Edward at Westminster, in 1277, as well as following Edward to Gascony Robert is also recorded as following Alexander to Tewkesbury, in the autumn of 1278.|$|R

50|$|From the 1270s Hawise {{began to}} take more a {{prominent}} role in the management of the family <b>estates,</b> <b>in</b> part perhaps because she was much younger than her aging, though still active, husband Gruffudd. Around 1270 she took personal control of her brother Hamon's manor of Church Stretton, Shropshire, while he went on crusade, and ultimately assumed full responsibility for the manor in her own right when Hamon died on crusade. She was a figure of family authority, seemingly central to the arrangements made both for her children's marriages and for the future of her husband's patrimonial lands. In providing for the family after his death, Gruffudd ap Gwenwynwyn made sure his Hawise's <b>dower</b> was preserved. <b>In</b> 1277 he issued a charter to his wife granting her dower interests then included the township of Buttington, the commotes of Deuddwr and Caereinion and pastures in Cyfeiliog and Arwystli.

By 1236 the manor was subinfeudated to John de Lacy, 2nd Earl of Lincoln. He was succeeded in 1241 by his son Edmund, who obtained livery of his father's lands by 1249 and in 1254 granted the manor to Henry de Lacy, 3rd Earl of Lincoln, for life.

50|$|After {{his death}} in 1566 the manor was held <b>in</b> <b>dower</b> by his widow Winifred, who married Sir John Paulet, Marquess of Winchester (d. 1576).

This purchase was probably hoped by Dister to be a quite lucrative move with the village undergoing a population boom during this period, when baptisms were nearly double the burials, although some historians believe that many people most likely migrated to Colchester.|$|R

5000|$|The general {{establishment}} {{of the principle of}} <b>dower</b> <b>in</b> the customary law of Western Europe, according to Maine, is to be traced to the influence of the Church (no evidence of this whatsoever dower payments evolved from Germanic custom of paying a brideprice, which over centuries morphed into the bridegift, was in place long before the church became seriously involved in marriage practice), and to be included perhaps among its most arduous triumphs. Dower is an outcome of the ecclesiastical practice of exacting from the husband at marriage a promise to endow his wife, a promise retained in form even now in the marriage ritual of the Established Church <b>in</b> England. <b>Dower</b> is mentioned <b>in</b> an ordinance of King Philip Augustus of France (1214), and in the almost contemporaneous Magna Carta (1215); but it seems to have already become customary law in Normandy, Sicily, and Naples, as well as in England. The object of both ordinance and charter was to regulate the amount of the dower where this was not the subject of voluntary arrangement, dower by English law consisting of a wife's life <b>estate</b> <b>in</b> one-third of the lands of the husband [...] "of which any issue which she might have had might by possibility have been heir".|$|R
