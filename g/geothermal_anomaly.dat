40|$|Abstract. The {{thermal water}} {{reservoir}} system which {{was developed by}} boreholes in recent years around Tiszakécske and Lakitelek was subjected to intense investigation. The study confirmed and extended {{the knowledge of the}} <b>geothermal</b> <b>anomaly</b> revealed previously in Part I (Alfôldi and Galfi, 1966). The devel-opment of this warm water geothermal field was carried out through 10 exploratory and extension wells. Their depths ranged from 250 to 2 048 m and penetrated a sedimentary sequence of Quaternary-Pliocene-Miocene age. The areal extent of the study area is approximately 150 km 2. Two thermal water reservoir systems can be distinguished: an upper formation consisting of sand and gravel of Quaternary age and a deeper formation including a sand series of Pliocene age. In analysing the major reservoir parameters and pressure-volume-temperature (PVT) relations and considering the geo-logical conditions, a communication between the two reservoir systems may be supposed. The local, near-surface <b>geothermal</b> <b>anomaly</b> is due to ascending, relatively warm water from the deeper thermal water layer under special geological, hydrodynamic and thermodynamic conditions. By comparison, {{in the southern part of}} the study area, a negative <b>geothermal</b> <b>anomaly</b> was found influenced by the descending cold water of meteoric origin.

Where groundwater flow is constricted at the discharge areas of the basins forced convection can locally increase the gradient to a level where free convection also occurs, generating surface heat flow anomalies 5 - 15 times background.

30|$|At the {{regional}} scale, the underground temperature distribution is spatially heterogeneous, {{and a series}} of local anomalies with temperatures above 140 °C at 2 -km depth are mainly concentrated on the western side of the URG, such as Soultz-sous-Forêts (France), Landau (Germany), or Mainz (Germany) (Schellschmidt and Clauser 1996; Baillieux et al. 2013). The temperature anomalies in the URG are controlled by three thermally relevant mechanisms: variability in the radiogenic heat production, convection, and conduction. The so-called ‘Soultz geothermal anomaly’ {{is one of the most}} important temperature anomalies and has been the subject of numerous studies. Soultz granites exhibit a maximum variation in radiogenic production of 5.5 to 6.5  μW/m 3 measured in core samples from GPK- 1 (Rummel et al. 1988) and a more important vertical variation of 2 to 7  μW/m 3 in GPK- 2 (Pribnow and Schellschmidt 2000). However, this radiogenic production is insufficient to explain the <b>geothermal</b> <b>anomalies</b> (Stussi et al. 2002). Temperature data from various oil and geothermal wells reveal a concentration of hot zones along Soultz or Kutzenhausen normal faults (Benderitter and Elsass 1995; Pribnow and Clauser 2000; Pribnow and Schellschmidt 2000). These <b>geothermal</b> <b>anomalies</b> at the local scale are attributed to buoyancy-induced hydrothermal circulation within the crystalline basement and the sandstones. To explain the Soultz anomaly, various hydrothermal modeling studies have focused on the Soultz horst region (Kohl et al. 2000) and on several vertical cross sections perpendicular to the graben axis (Le Carlier et al. 1994; Person and Garven 1992; Guillou-Frottier et al. 2013).|$|R

Different hypotheses must be investigated in the future, for example, the presence of bedrock formed by granitic rocks (with U, Th, K, Llambias 2008; Rapella and Baldo 2014) that may produce high internal radiogenic heat over long time periods. Following Donaldson (1962), other probable hypothesis to be investigated is that the heat transference may be possible in these systems through sediments that underlie the aquifer and the distribution of heat in the aquifer system itself may become possible by free hydrothermal convection.|$|E

To try to identify the geothermal nomaly in geoelectrical terms and to understand its origin and relation to the regional geological framework, a magnetotelluric survey in the frequency range 0. 031 - 128 Hz was carried out in the area that includes the zone of high HFD values. The results of the survey are discussed in conjunction with magnetic, gravimetric and seismic information as well as synthetic alculations of temperature distributions within the crust.

30|$|The {{registered}} {{thermal anomaly}} defines a geothermal {{area with the}} highest values linked to the General Levalle Cretaceous depocenter, especially associated to the low block of the Tigre Muerto regional fault. This <b>geothermal</b> <b>anomaly</b> {{is consistent with the}} regional geotectonic setting and it {{is the result of the}} continental crustal thinning and the geological regional faults that make groundwater circulation easy at several depths. The groundwater flowing from recharge areas, favored by the dipping regional blocks, would have reached higher temperatures (in the order of 79  °C, according to the chalcedony geothermometer) explaining the present oversaturation in SiO 2. This situation implies maximum depths up to 1500  m and the observed thermodynamic behavior for such mineralogical phases. This framework is in agreement with the Cl–SO 4 –HCO 3 ternary diagram which indicates steam-heated waters. Moreover, the results obtained in the Na–K–Mg ternary diagram show that the cationic geothermometers were not useful because the samples were located in the immature water field near the boundary of the partially equilibrated waters.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the relationship between}} volcano-seismic events, recorded at La Fossa crater of Vulcano (Aeolian Islands, Italy) during 2004 - 2006, and {{the dynamics of the}} hydrothermal system. During the period of study, three episodes of increasing numbers of volcano-seismic events took {{place at the same time}} as <b>geothermal</b> and geochemical <b>anomalies</b> were observed. These <b>geothermal</b> and geochemical <b>anomalies</b> have been interpreted as resulting from an increasing deep magmatic component of the hydrothermal fluids. Three classes of seismic events (long period, high frequency and monochromatic events), characterised by different spectral content and various similarity of the waveforms, have been recognised. These events, clustered mainly below La Fossa crater area at depths of 0. 5 – 1. 1 km b. s. l., were space-distributed according to the classes. Based on their features, we can infer that such events at Vulcano are related to two different source mechanisms: (1) fracturing processes of rocks and (2) resonance of cracks (or conduits) filled with hydrothermal fluid. In the light of these source mechanisms, the increase in the number of events, at the same time as geochemical and <b>geothermal</b> <b>anomalies</b> were observed, was interpreted as the result of an increasing magmatic component of the hydrothermal fluids, implying an increase of their flux. Indeed, such variation caused an increase of both the pore pressure within the rocks of the volcanic system and the amount of ascending fluids. Increased pore pressures gave rise to fracturing processes, while the increased fluid flux favoured resonance and vibration processes in cracks and conduits. Finally, a gradual temporal variation of the waveform of the hybrid events (one of the subclasses of long period events) was observed, likely caused by heating and drying of the hydrothermal system...|$|R
