5|$|It <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>point,</b> {{with the}} {{questioning}} of Acoli, that {{the accounts of}} the confrontation begin to differ (see the witnesses section below). However, in the ensuing shootout, Trooper Foerster was shot twice {{in the head with}} his own gun and killed, Zayd Shakur was killed, and Assata Shakur and Trooper Harper were wounded.|$|E
5|$|The {{fall line}} is the geomorphologic break between the upland region of {{relatively}} hard crystalline basement rock and the coastal plain of softer sedimentary rock. The fall line is most prominent when crossed by a river. It <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>point</b> that cities developed, because riverboats could not typically travel any farther inland without portaging. In some locations, the rapid change in elevation of the water, and the resulting energy release, made the fall line a good location for water mills, grist mills, and sawmills. Because {{of the need for}} a river port leading to the ocean, and a ready supply of water power, settlements developed where rivers crossed the fall line. In Georgia, the Fall Line extends from Augusta, through Macon, and on to Columbus.|$|E
5|$|When {{the first}} {{novel of the}} series, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (published in America and other {{countries}} as Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone) opens, {{it is apparent that}} some significant event has taken place in the Wizarding World – an event so very remarkable, even Muggles (non-magical people) notice signs of it. The full background to this event and Harry Potter's past is revealed gradually through the series. After the introductory chapter, the book leaps forward to a time shortly before Harry Potter's eleventh birthday, and it <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>point</b> that his magical background begins to be revealed.|$|E

5|$|M-43 and M-89 run {{concurrently}} for a mile {{north of}} Richland before M-89 heads {{off to the}} west while M-43 continues north. After the concurrency ends, M-43 turns east and then back north to run between Little Long and Gull lakes. It <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>point</b> where M-43 begins its northward trek. The road continues on a general north-northeast track through rural areas and beside several lakes in Barry County before meeting M-179 and M-37. M-43 merges with the latter highway and together they run into Hastings. Downtown, M-37 leaves town to the south, while M-43 heads north before curving around the east, passing through farmfields approaching the community of Woodland. After leaving town, the road meets M-66, and together they head north to a junction with M-50.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, a mysteriously ill Jordan {{continues}} {{to ask about}} Helen's whereabouts, and her remarks about Helen's conditions lead Black to believe she is starting to experience the seemingly-psychic visions {{he is capable of}} seeing, which allow him to see the evil people are capable of. Elsewhere, Green is arrested. His property is searched but Helen is nowhere to be found—although another corpse is dug up in the garden, evidently killed nine years before. Black deduces that Green could not have killed Helen at the cabin as his house was already being watched by the police. He sees a set of tools in Green's home which he realizes were not used for murder or torture, but to immure Helen in the basement. Black and the police dismantle a newly finished plaster wall, finding Helen injured but alive; it <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>point</b> that Black realizes Green was simply a pawn, used by his father to lure victims to the house.|$|E
5|$|Raskolnikov <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>point</b> {{completely}} torn; he is {{urged by}} Sonya to confess, and Svidrigaïlov's testimony could potentially convict him. Furthermore, Porfiry confronts Raskolnikov with his suspicions and assures him that confession would substantially lighten his sentence. Meanwhile, Svidrigaïlov attempts to seduce Dunya, {{but when he}} realizes that she will never love him, he lets her go. He then spends a night in confusion {{and in the morning}} shoots himself. This same morning, Raskolnikov goes again to Sonya, who again urges him to confess and to clear his conscience. He makes his way to the police station, where he is met by the news of Svidrigaïlov's suicide. He hesitates a moment, thinking again that he might get away with a perfect crime, but is persuaded by Sonya to confess.|$|E

5|$|Zack {{had only}} a small role in the {{original}} Final Fantasy VII. He is first mentioned by name in Gongaga, his hometown, where his parents are oblivious as to what became of him after he left to join SOLDIER, and are worried for his safety after not hearing from him for years. It <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>point</b> that Aerith explains Zack was her first love. Cloud later realizes {{that some of his}} memories and even aspects of his personality were actually Zack's, and not his own. Flashbacks reveal that both Zack and Cloud battled Sephiroth after he burned the town of Nibelheim upon discovering he {{was the result of a}} scientific experiment. After Cloud defeated Sephiroth, both Zack and Cloud were taken to be used in experiments by Shinra. Eventually, Zack woke up and was able to escape with a semi-conscious Cloud to the city Midgar, but on the edge of the city, he was gunned down by Shinra troops. While Zack's and Cloud's flashback escape is optional in the North American and European releases of Final Fantasy VII and the Japanese International version, it was originally planned to be shown once Cloud discovered the results of Shinra's experiments.|$|E
25|$|In 2010 DFDS {{acquired}} Norfolkline from Maersk. Following restructuring, {{the operations}} of DFDS Tor Line, DFDS Lisco and Norfolkline were integrated into DFDS Seaways. The merger led to changes and additions to freight destinations and an expansion in freight volumes. It <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>point</b> that the historic Tor Line ceased to exist as a brand and entity, though its contributions to the legacy of North Sea and Baltic Sea maritime shipping remains.|$|E
25|$|Up Masons Hill {{the road}} reaches Bromley Common, the first {{large-scale}} open space negotiated; briefly, just before Farnborough, the road becomes Hastings Road. The original A21 went though the suburb, the High Street {{is now the}} B2158. Until now the road {{has been in a}} south-easterly direction, but after Green Street Green it turns eastwards towards the valley of the River Darent, and it <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>point</b> that the road pattern makes a complete change from its original route.|$|E

25|$|Successful in {{all three}} endeavors, Volyova, Khouri, and Thorn begin the lengthy evacuation, while the Inhibitors {{continue}} their mysterious construction project. Only a few thousand people have been evacuated from the surface when the Inhibitors come so close to Resurgam's star that Volyova begins deploying the cache weapons {{in the hope that}} they will be able to buy more time. It <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>point</b> that a beta-level simulation of Clavain arrives in a laser transmission, and attempts to negotiate the peaceful turn over of the cache weapons to the soon to be arriving Zodiacal Light. Volyova rejects his requests, explaining that she has greater need to the weapons and continues deploying them.|$|E
25|$|The river then {{continues}} south through the market town of Stone, and after passing {{the village of}} Salt, it reaches Great Haywood, where it is spanned by the 16th-century Essex Bridge near Shugborough Hall. At this point the River Sow joins it from Stafford. The Trent now flows south-east past the town of Rugeley until it reaches Kings Bromley where it meets the Blithe. After the confluence with the Swarbourn, it passes Alrewas and reaches Wychnor, where it is crossed by the A38 dual carriageway, which follows {{the route of the}} Roman Ryknild Street. The river turns north-east where it is joined by its largest tributary, the Tame (which <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>point</b> actually the larger, though its earlier length shorter) and immediately afterwards by the Mease, creating a larger river that now flows through a broad floodplain.|$|E
25|$|Roughly a {{week after}} the nest is complete, the first larvae begin to hatch, and these will become adults {{approximately}} 30 days after hatching, marking the end of the pre-emergence phase {{and the beginning of the}} post emergence phase. It <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>point</b> when the emergence of workers is largely dependent on the necessity to produce reproductive females that will become queens. Because of the fact that S. septentrionalis is a polygynous species, more than one queen will exist at a given time, and often the number of queens will fluctuate. When queen number is small, worker number will be high and thus females will grow ovaries that are well developed so that they may reproduce as queens. When queen number is high, worker number is small, and steps will be taken to inseminate females in order to keep them from reproducing, and they will become workers.|$|E

25|$|The Old Seward Highway {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with Potter Valley Road, less than 500 feet from Potter Valley Road's own terminus with the (new) Seward Highway. From there, Old Seward Highway curves {{along the east}} side of Potter Marsh opposite the New Seward Highway (on the west side) before intersecting Rabbit Creek Road, again less than a 1/4 mile from the New Seward Highway, which <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>point</b> a four-lane freeway. From there, Old Seward Highway travels northwest over the New Seward Highway and through the neighborhood of Oceanview. The route bends north, running parallel to the New Seward Highway. The roadway intersects O'Malley Road and continues northward through the Campbell/Taku neighborhood. The road proceeds north into Midtown, traveling through the neighborhood to the highway's northern terminus, an intersection with 33th Avenue near the Moose's Tooth Pub and Pizzeria. An exit ramp from the New Seward Highway serves as the beginning of the southbound lanes.|$|E
25|$|The law was passed. The {{next day}} Calpurnius Bibulus {{tried unsuccessfully to}} get the senate to annul the laws. However, the {{senators}} were afraid of the strong popular support for the law. Bibulus retired to his home and did not appear in public {{for the rest of}} his consulship. He sent notices declaring that it was a sacred period and that this made votes invalid each time Caesar passed a law. The plebeian tribunes who sided with the optimates also stopped performing any public duty. The people took the customary oath of obedience to the law. Cassius Dio wrote that Cato and Quintus Metellus Celer refused to swear compliance. However, on the day when they were to incur the established penalties they took the oath. Appian wrote that many senators refused to take the oath but they relented because Caesar, through the plebeian council, enacted the death penalty for recusants. In Appian's account it <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>point</b> that the Vettius affair occurred.|$|E
25|$|The second {{completed}} manuscript, {{called the}} printer's manuscript, was {{a copy of}} the original manuscript produced by Oliver Cowdery and two other scribes. It <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>point</b> that initial copyediting of the Book of Mormon was completed. Observations of the original manuscript show little evidence of corrections to the text. Shortly before his death in 1850, Cowdery gave the printer's manuscript to David Whitmer, another of the Three Witnesses. In 1903, the manuscript was bought from Whitmer's grandson by the Community of Christ, known at the time as the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. On September 20, 2017, the LDS Church purchased the manuscript from the Community of Christ at a reported price of $35 million. The printer's manuscript is now the earliest surviving complete copy of the Book of Mormon, being nearly 100 percent extant. The manuscript was imaged in 1923 and was recently made available for viewing online.|$|E

25|$|Homestead is a small-sized city. At its {{greatest}} north-south points– along SW 137th Avenue (Speedway Boulevard)– its city limits extend only – from SW 288th Street (Biscayne Drive) {{at the north}} end to (theoretical) SW 352nd Street at the south end. At {{its greatest}} east-west points– along SW 328th Street (North Canal Drive / Lucy Street)– its city limits extend – from (theoretical) SW 132nd Avenue at the east end to SW 192nd Avenue at the west end. U.S. 1– known as Homestead Boulevard within the city limits– extends through a rather narrow northeast / southwest corridor of the city from SW 304th Street (Kings Highway) {{at the north end}} to SW 328th Street (Lucy Street) at the south end. It <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>point</b> at the south end that Homestead and Florida City share a common border. (North of the north end at SW 304th Street is known as Unincorporated Miami-Dade County, but it is locally known as the community of Leisure City).|$|E
25|$|The {{beginning}} of the Kalki Purana describes Kali's lineage starting with the creator-god Brahma, his great-great-grandfather, and ending {{with the birth of}} his children's children. Instead of being born of poison from the churning of the ocean of milk, he {{is the product of a}} long line of incestuous monsters born from Brahma's back. (See Family Lineage below) Kali and his family were created by Brahma to hurry the dissolution of the cosmos after the pralaya period was over. When his family takes human form on earth, they further taint the hearts and minds of mankind to bring about the end of Dvapara Yuga and the {{beginning of}} Kali Yuga. During the first stage of Kali-Yuga, the varnashrama breaks down and God-worship is forsaken by man. All through the second, third, and fourth stages, man forgets the name of god and no longer offers Yajna (offerings) to the Devas. It <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>point</b> when God Vishnu reincarnates as Kalki in the name of the Devas and all of mankind to rid the cosmos of Kali's dark influence.|$|E
25|$|Jordanes' {{description}} of the battle, according to Hughes, takes place from the Roman perspective. Attila's forces arrived on the ridge first, {{on the far right}} side, before the Visigoths could take that position. Then Aetius' Romans arrived {{on the left side of}} the ridge, and repulsed the Gepids as they came up. Finally the Alans and the Visigoths under Thorismund fought their way up and secured the center of the ridge, holding it against Attila. However, Hughes differs from mainstream explanations in that he places Thorismund between the Alans and Visigothic main body, rather than on the Visigothic flank. MacDowall, for example, places Thorismund on the far right of the battlefield. The final phase of the battle is characterized by the Gothic attempt to take the right side of the ridge, in which Theodoric is slain, with the rest of his army unaware of his death. It <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>point</b> that Thorismund located Attila's position in the Hunnic battle line, and attacked the Hunnic center, nearly slaying Attila himself and forcing the Hunnic center to retreat. Both armies fell into confusion as darkness descended, and neither side knew the outcome of the battle until the following morning.|$|E
