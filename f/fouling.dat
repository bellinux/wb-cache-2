5|$|In {{both their}} native and {{introduced}} ranges, C.mutica are also synanthropic, being found abundantly in <b>fouling</b> communities in artificial structures like submerged ropes, fishing nets, pilings, docks, buoys, aquaculture equipment, oil rig platforms, ship hulls, and even offshore wind farms. In their introduced ranges (particularly in Europe), they are primarily and even exclusively found inhabiting artificial structures.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} (as at 2010) of two breeding {{pairs of}} wild peregrine falcons (nesting {{one in each}} of the telescope's two support towers) prevents the nuisance of pigeon infestation (by droppings <b>fouling,</b> and their body heat affecting sensitive instrument readings) that some other radio telescopes suffer from.|$|E
5|$|With {{six minutes}} remaining, the Knicks began {{intentionally}} <b>fouling</b> any Warrior except Chamberlain, keeping {{the ball out}} of the center's hands. New York also began moving the ball slowly and using as much of the shot clock as possible to leave fewer opportunities for Chamberlain to score. Effectively, they played the opposite of what a normal club would do if they faced a deficit, willingly giving up many easy points instead of making attempts to rally back. Meschery said the Warriors lobbed the ball in from the sideline across the floor directly to Chamberlain, who would use his size and strength to get the ball. Chamberlain was the only Warrior to make a field goal in almost four minutes before Meschery made a jump shot at 4:15. Philadelphia began quickly <b>fouling</b> New York with around four minutes left, reciprocating the intentional foul strategy. Warriors coach Frank McGuire at one point pulled out his entire starting five, save Chamberlain, and replaced them with bench players. The intention was to foul the Knicks, get the ball back after free throws and give Chamberlain the ball. Thus each team spent the last minutes <b>fouling</b> each other. The Warriors ended with 25 personal fouls, and the Knicks with 32, and lost Imhoff and Willie Naulls with six fouls.|$|E
50|$|<b>Foul</b> {{territory}} or <b>foul</b> {{ground is}} defined as the area of the field outside of the <b>foul</b> lines. The <b>foul</b> lines and <b>foul</b> poles are not part of <b>foul</b> territory.|$|R
50|$|A player <b>foul</b> is any <b>foul,</b> but {{typically}} personal and flagrant <b>fouls,</b> {{by reference to}} the count of <b>fouls</b> charged against a given player. A team <b>foul</b> is any <b>foul</b> by reference to the count against a given team.|$|R
50|$|On a <b>foul</b> {{committed}} by the defense (and on a loose-ball <b>foul</b> when neither team is in possession of the ball), if the team committing the <b>foul</b> is in the penalty situation or the <b>fouled</b> player was {{in the act of}} shooting, the <b>fouled</b> player is awarded free throws. Otherwise, and on offensive <b>fouls,</b> the <b>fouled</b> player's team is awarded possession of the ball to pass inbounds from the out-of-bounds point nearest to the <b>foul.</b> The shot clock is reset.|$|R
5|$|A {{new problem}} confronted the Confederates. The {{dead and wounded}} of Grant's army lay {{in the heat of}} Mississippi summer, the odor of the {{deceased}} men and horses <b>fouling</b> the air, the wounded crying for medical help and water. Grant first refused a request of truce, thinking it a show of weakness. Finally he relented, and the Confederates held their fire while the Union recovered the wounded and dead, soldiers from both sides mingling and trading as if no hostilities existed for the moment.|$|E
5|$|Calabria was {{designed}} for use in Italy's colonial empire, rather than the earlier vessels intended as fleet scouts. As such, her steel hull was sheathed with wood and then a layer of zinc {{to protect it from}} <b>fouling</b> during lengthy tours in the overseas colonies. Additionally, she was equipped with less powerful though more efficient engines than the earlier cruisers. The ship was otherwise similar to preceding designs like the Regioni class, having a displacement only slightly lower and a nearly identical gun battery.|$|E
5|$|However, {{their larger}} sizes and very {{aggressive}} behavior also {{make them a}} serious threat to native species of skeleton shrimp. A study in 2009 on the native populations of Caprella linearis, a smaller caprellid species in the Helgoland region of the German Bight in the North Sea, have revealed that C. linearis have more or less vanished and have been replaced by C. mutica. C. mutica <b>fouling</b> populations may also incur minor economic effects through the cost of their removal from submerged aquaculture equipment and ship hulls.|$|E
50|$|Only {{defensive}} and loose-ball <b>fouls</b> count towards a team's limit {{for the team}} <b>foul</b> penalty. Offensive <b>fouls</b> do not count towards the team <b>foul</b> penalty.|$|R
50|$|FIBA {{basketball}} {{rules have}} a similar <b>foul</b> called an unsportsmanlike <b>foul,</b> which is roughly equivalent to a flagrant type 1, with the addition that an unsportsmanlike <b>foul</b> can be called if a player <b>fouls</b> with no intention to play the ball (including excessive holding, shirt grabbing), as well as if a player <b>fouls</b> another player on a fast break from behind him. If a player commits a <b>foul</b> warranting immediate ejection from the game, the <b>foul</b> would be called as a disqualifying <b>foul</b> - similar to a flagrant 2. Two unsportsmanlike <b>fouls</b> lead to automatic ejection, similar to the NBA.|$|R
50|$|Any of {{the above}} types of balls might be fair balls or <b>foul</b> balls. Umpires will also signal first signal fair or <b>foul</b> on fly outs near the <b>foul</b> line, but {{the result of a}} <b>foul</b> fly out (or <b>foul</b> out) is no {{different}} from a fair fly out; it is not a <b>foul</b> ball.|$|R
5|$|Marquinhos {{began the}} 2014–15 season on 2 August in the Trophée des Champions, playing the whole 90 minutes as PSG won 2–0 against Guingamp at the Workers Stadium in Beijing. In the 32nd minute, he gave away a penalty kick by <b>fouling</b> Claudio Beauvue, but Salvatore Sirigu saved the penalty shot from Mustapha Yatabaré. His first {{goal of the}} season came in a 2–0 win at Caen on 24 September, heading in Javier Pastore's corner.|$|E
5|$|Okafor and Young {{reached an}} {{anticipated}} city championship matchup with Curie and Alexander at the Jones Convocation Center. Okafor had 16 points, 14 rebounds and 3 blocks. Curie won the city championship 69–66 in quadruple overtime as Okafor had 16 points before <b>fouling</b> out with 2:13 remaining in regulation. The CPL Championship game {{was attended by}} Mayor of Chicago Rahm Emanuel and was the lead story on the late edition of SportsCenter.|$|E
5|$|When Jeremy Lin was sidelined for the 2017–18 NBA {{season after}} the first game, it opened up playing time. After Allen Crabbe started game 2, LeVert entered the {{starting}} lineup for game 3 on October 22 against the Atlanta Hawks, posting 16 points, 6 rebounds, 4 assists and 3 steals. Coming off the bench on November 6 against the Phoenix Suns, LeVert posted a 5-steal performance, while locking down Devin Booker so well that he frustrated Booker into <b>fouling</b> out.|$|E
50|$|Individual sports {{may have}} {{different}} types of <b>fouls.</b> For example, in basketball, a personal <b>foul</b> involves illegal personal contact with an opponent. A technical <b>foul</b> refers to unsportsmanlike non-contact behavior, a more serious infraction than a personal <b>foul.</b> A flagrant <b>foul</b> involves unsportsmanlike contact behavior, considered the most serious <b>foul</b> and often resulting in ejection from the game.|$|R
50|$|In basketball, such {{misconduct}} is penalized by {{a technical}} <b>foul</b> {{as opposed to}} a personal <b>foul.</b> The technical <b>foul</b> is akin to a caution in that two such <b>fouls</b> warrant an expulsion, although egregious conduct will be immediately assessed two consecutive technical <b>fouls.</b>|$|R
5000|$|This type of {{technical}} <b>foul</b> serves in effect as a [...] "player <b>foul</b> penalty" [...] of a bonus free throw, {{similar to the}} team <b>foul</b> penalty. However, this bonus free throw is awarded regardless of the <b>foul</b> being an offensive or defensive <b>foul.</b>|$|R
5|$|Alavés {{kicked off}} {{the second half of}} extra-time and within seconds, Babbel was booked for {{bringing}} down Alavés defender Delfí Geli 30 yards from goal. The resulting free-kick was put wide by Hermes Desio. Three minutes later, Liverpool had a chance to score, but Fowler could not reach Steven Gerrard's cross and the ball was subsequently cleared from the Alavés penalty area. In the 115th minute of the match, Alavés were reduced to nine men, when Antonio Karmona received a second yellow card for <b>fouling</b> Smicer. McAllister took the resulting free-kick, which was headed into his own goal by Geli. As a result of the golden goal, Liverpool had won the match 5–4 to win their third UEFA Cup and complete a Treble.|$|E
5|$|Barcelona {{kicked the}} match off, but Manchester United showed their intent from the outset, forcing goalkeeper Víctor Valdés to concede a throw-in after just 10 seconds. Further {{pressure}} on the attack resulted in Yaya Touré <b>fouling</b> Anderson within Cristiano Ronaldo's shooting range. Ronaldo fired the free kick directly at Valdés, but the Spanish goalkeeper could only parry the ball and Gerard Piqué did well to divert Park Ji-sung's follow-up effort over the bar. The resulting corner was cleared, but {{only as far as}} Wayne Rooney, whose snap-shot was wayward and went out for a goal kick.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} minute, Barcelona's Javier Mascherano conceded a corner kick, which Juventus aimed at Evra but Barcelona cleared it. However two minutes later, Jordi Alba made {{a run on}} Barcelona's left, passing to Neymar and then Andrés Iniesta who set up Ivan Rakitić to score the first goal from close range. Rakitić's goal was Barcelona's fastest goal in a Champions League Final, and the fourth fastest in Champions League Final overall. In the 11th minute, Arturo Vidal of Juventus {{received}} the first yellow card for <b>fouling</b> Sergio Busquets. At half time, Barcelona led 1–0.|$|E
5000|$|In {{that they}} {{generally}} exceed {{the severity of}} [...] "common" [...] <b>fouls,</b> {{in addition to being}} personal <b>fouls,</b> flagrant 1 and flagrant 2 <b>fouls</b> are also technical <b>fouls.</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{personal}} <b>foul</b> is {{the most}} common type of <b>foul.</b> It results from personal contact between two opposing players.Basketball features constant motion, and contact between opposing players is unavoidable, but significant contact that is the fault of illegal conduct by one opponent is a <b>foul</b> against that player. Most personal <b>fouls</b> are called against a defensive player. A personal <b>foul</b> that is committed by a player of the team in possession of the ball is called an offensive <b>foul.</b> When neither team is in clear possession of the ball, a <b>foul</b> is called a loose-ball <b>foul.</b>|$|R
50|$|First or worst—if both drivers {{commit a}} <b>foul,</b> the driver who commits the <b>foul</b> first loses, {{unless it is}} two {{separate}} <b>fouls,</b> where the loser is the driver who committed the worse <b>foul</b> (lane violation is worse than <b>foul</b> start, and failure {{to participate in a}} post-run inspection is worst).|$|R
5|$|Johnson was {{appointed}} as captain {{ahead of the}} 2011–12 season having previously captained the club in a friendly match against Nottingham Forest, but was stripped of the post following the arrival of Clarke Carlisle. Johnson retained his first team place, making 48 appearances and scoring twice in two consecutive games against Morecambe and Southend. During a 3–2 loss against Burton Albion on 26 December 2011, Johnson received a straight red card in the 18th minute, for <b>fouling</b> John McGrath. After the match, the club announced it would appeal against his sending-off. The club won the appeal after The Football Association overturned the decision, therefore making him available to play.|$|E
5|$|Led by Baylor and West at 38.3 and 30.8ppg respectively, the Lakers {{improved}} to 54–26 in 1961–62, {{and made the}} finals. In a game five victory, Baylor grabbed 22 rebounds and set the still-standing NBA record for points in a finals game with 61, despite <b>fouling</b> out of the game. The Lakers, however, lost to the Celtics by three points in overtime of game seven. Frank Selvy, after making two jumpers in the final 40 seconds to tie the game, missed a potential game-winning 18foot jump shot in regulation, a miss which he said in June 2010 still haunted him more than 40 years later.|$|E
5|$|Northampton signed Johnson on {{a two-year}} {{contract}} in July 2010 following the successful loan spell. After signing {{for the club}} on a permanent basis, Johnson's first match was the opening game of the season, in a 3–0 loss against Torquay United. Two months later, he received a straight red card after <b>fouling</b> Simon Clist and lost his appeal, resulting in a one-match ban, missing a 3–1 loss against Oxford United. A week after his suspension, he scored his first goal as a permanent Northampton player in a 2–0 win over Lincoln City. In his first season at Northampton (as a permanent player), he made 41 appearances and scored seven goals.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Foul</b> {{limits are}} reset {{in the last}} two minutes of a quarter or {{overtime}} period. If a team has not reached its limit of accumulated <b>fouls,</b> the first team <b>foul</b> {{in the last two}} minutes results in possession by the team <b>fouled,</b> and all subsequent <b>fouls</b> result in two free throws.|$|R
25|$|A team {{enters the}} penalty {{situation}} after the fifth <b>foul</b> in a quarter, with each successive <b>foul</b> entitling the <b>fouled</b> player to two free-throw attempts. In {{the last two}} minutes of regulation, teams are only allowed one <b>foul</b> to give, as in NBA rules. Overtime periods allow each team two <b>fouls</b> {{in the first three}} minutes and one <b>foul</b> in the last two minutes, as in NBA rules.|$|R
50|$|There are {{two types}} of <b>fouls</b> in woman's lacrosse, major and minor. When a minor <b>foul</b> is {{committed}} anywhere on the field, the player who committed the <b>fouled</b> is set four meters to whichever side she was last guarding the person she obstructed. If a major <b>foul</b> occurs outside of the twelve meter fan or eight meter arc, the <b>fouler</b> must stand four meters behind the player she <b>fouled.</b>|$|R
5|$|The Dukes then {{returned}} home, where they faced Radford on November 29. B.J. Monteiro continued {{to perform well}} as a starter in replacing Melquan Bolding, leading the team with 21 points. Next up for the team was the annual City Game match-up between Duquesne and its crosstown rival Pitt. In front of 12,336fans at the Mellon Arena, Duquesne sprang out to a 16-point lead before slipping and losing 58–67 in double overtime. Bill Clark led all players with 23points but the team hit foul trouble, with Saunders, Monteiro, and Peggau all <b>fouling</b> out in the final minutes.|$|E
5|$|The {{golden goal}} was used during extra-time, {{which meant that}} {{whatever}} team scored first would win. Liverpool kicked off {{the first half of}} extra-time and within three minutes, Alavés looked like they had scored a golden goal. Ivan Alonso had put the ball in the Liverpool goal, but it was ruled out as Alonso was offside. A minute later, Óscar Téllez was booked for <b>fouling</b> Robbie Fowler. Within four minutes, Alavés had been reduced to 10 men. Magno was shown a second yellow card for a two-footed challenge on Markus Babbel. With a minute {{of the first half of}} extra-time remaining, Fowler thought he had scored the winning goal, however it was disallowed as he was offside.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the match, Lauren {{committed}} several fouls on Ronaldo, and {{confronted the}} Portuguese winger {{early in the}} second half, before finally being booked for persistent <b>fouling</b> in the 62nd minute. Ronaldo took the free kick himself but put it just over the bar from 30 yards. In the 64th minute, Arsenal were awarded a free kick for an O'Shea foul on Reyes; Bergkamp took the kick, which was headed away by Ferdinand, but only as far as Pirès, whose side-footed volley went over the bar. The free kick was to be Bergkamp's last contribution to the final, as he was then substituted by Ljungberg in the 65th minute.|$|E
5000|$|In basketball, a {{flagrant}} <b>foul</b> is {{a serious}} personal <b>foul.</b> A <b>foul</b> is considered flagrant when it involves excessive or violent contact that could injure the <b>fouled</b> player. A flagrant <b>foul</b> may be unintentional or purposeful; the latter type is simultaneously known as an [...] "intentional foul" [...] in the NBA. However, most intentional <b>fouls</b> are not considered [...] "flagrant" [...] and are performed safely as a necessity for time management.|$|R
50|$|Finally, if {{a referee}} deems a <b>foul</b> {{extremely}} aggressive, {{or that it}} did not show an attempt to play the ball, the referee can call an even more severe <b>foul,</b> known as an unsportsmanlike <b>foul</b> in international play or a flagrant <b>foul</b> in the NBA and NCAA basketball. This <b>foul</b> is charged against the player (and depending on the severity of the offense, can even be ejected), and the opponent gets two free throws and possession of the ball afterwards. Unlike technical <b>fouls,</b> the player <b>fouled</b> must shoot the awarded free throws.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Foul</b> limit—no {{limit on}} {{personal}} <b>fouls</b> per player, seven per team. A player who commits two unsportsmanlike <b>fouls</b> is disqualified.|$|R
