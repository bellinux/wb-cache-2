500|$|One of Kaczynski's tactics {{was leaving}} false clues in every bomb. He would {{deliberately}} make them {{hard to find}} to mislead investigators into thinking they had a clue.

One false clue he left was a note in a bomb that did not detonate which reads [...] "Wu—It works! <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>it</b> would—RV". Another clue was the Eugene O'Neill $1 stamps used to send his boxes. One of his bombs was sent embedded in a copy of Sloan Wilson's novel Ice Brothers.|$|E
