40|$|Control {{function}} verification is {{an important}} task in current engineering design. Traditional researches usually focus on the final function validation when the control system has already been implemented on a hardware controller. However, {{it would be more}} useful if design errors are found in earlier stages of design. <b>Logic</b> <b>diagram,</b> as a popular middle medium, plays a critical role in the current design practices, especially for medium-sized and large-sized control systems. Therefore, verification of the design specifications of the <b>logic</b> <b>diagrams</b> is an interesting topic in order to find and eliminate the design errors in an early stage. In this thesis, we provide a viable approach to verify the design functions of the <b>logic</b> <b>diagrams</b> which is based on the modular supervisory control of Discrete-Event Systems.

Technology <b>Logic</b> <b>Diagram</b> documents published for the DOE facilities in Oak Ridge (K- 25, X- 10, Y- 12) were chosen for this effort because of the large number of technologies identified, described, evaluated, and ranked for possible use in the environmental remediation of these facilities.

The present paper investigates the cognitive processes of interpreting diagrammatic representations underlying deductive reasoning, combining the insights from both logical and cognitive studies of diagrams. A semantical analysis of two different ways of formalizing <b>logic</b> <b>diagrams</b> is provided.

However, the question of why certain diagrams but not others have such inferential efficacy in performing syllogism reasoning has not been fully answered. Based on a proof-theoretical analysis of categorical syllogisms and diagrammatic reasoning, we supplement our previous study of cognitive efficacy of diagrams and argue that the relational information underlying quantified sentences plays a crucial role in understanding the efficacy of diagrams in syllogistic reasoning. The distinctive features of our conception of diagrammatic reasoning are made clear by comparing it with the model-theoretic conception of ordinary reasoning developed in the mental model theory...|$|R

With the startup of the Oak Ridge K- 25 Site gaseous diffusion plant In 1947, Alpha- 4 was placed on standby. In 1953, the uranium enrichment process was removed, and installation of equipment for the Colex process began. The Colex process [...] which uses a mercury solvent and lithium hydroxide as the lithium feed material-was shut down in 1962 and drained of process materials. Residual Quantities of mercury and lithium hydroxide have remained in the process equipment. Alpha- 4 contains more than one-half million ft{sup 2 } of floor area; 15, 000 tons of process and electrical equipment; and 23, 000 tons of insulation, mortar, brick, flooring, handrails, ducts, utilities, burnables, and sludge.
