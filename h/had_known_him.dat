Siddiqui, who had only had minor roles in Bollywood up to that time, was surprised {{that for the first time}} he would not have to portray a beggar.

He thought there were suitable actors in Hindi film industry for the role.

25|$|There {{was also}} {{considerable}} {{concern about the}} police investigation into the girls' murders. It took nearly {{two weeks before the}} police became aware of previous sexual allegations against Huntley (they were contacted by a woman who <b>had</b> <b>known</b> <b>him</b> in Grimsby and was aware that he had once been charged with rape) and, although he was identified as the last person to see either of the two children, his story was not effectively checked out early during the investigation.|$|E
25|$|One {{friendship}} {{was made}} in these years that has been worth more than words can tell. I refer to that of Matthew McClung. To {{be known as a}} co-official with McClung was a privilege that only those who knew him can appreciate. I <b>had</b> <b>known</b> <b>him</b> before at Lehigh in his undergraduate days, and had played on the same teams with him Never was there a squarer sportsman, or a fairer, more conscientious and efficient official; nor a truer, more gallant type of real man than he. His early death took out of the game a man of the kind we can ill afford to lose and no tribute that I could pay him would be high enough.|$|E
25|$|Eliza Tierney, a 14-year-old servant at Starr's tavern, {{was called}} {{as a witness}} and testified that she had known Whelan for six weeks as a boarder {{who lived in a}} room {{on the first floor of}} the tavern, and that he had owned a pistol for as long as she <b>had</b> <b>known</b> <b>him.</b> However, she discredited the police {{evidence}} suggesting that a shot had been recently fired from Whelan's gun, by offering that one of the other servant girls had handled the pistol clumsily only a week before and shot herself in the arm. This was also confirmed by bookkeeper William Goulden in his testimony, who added that Whelan had offered to sell his pistol just six weeks before McGee was killed. Other evidence suggested that Whelan owned the pistol as he was fond of sport shooting.|$|E

25|$|None of Keats' biographies {{were written}} by people who <b>had</b> <b>known</b> <b>him.</b> Shortly after his death, his {{publishers}} announced they would speedily publish The memoirs and remains of John Keats but his friends refused to cooperate and argued {{with each other to}} the extent that the project was abandoned. Leigh Hunt's Lord Byron and some of his Contemporaries (1828) gives the first biographical account, strongly emphasising Keats's supposedly humble origins, a misconception which still continues. Given that he was becoming a significant figure within artistic circles, a succession of other publications followed, including anthologies of his many notes, chapters and letters. However, early accounts often gave contradictory or heavily biased versions of events and were subject to dispute. His friends Brown, Severn, Dilke, Shelley and his guardian Richard Abbey, his publisher Taylor, Fanny Brawne and many others issued posthumous commentary on Keats's life. These early writings coloured all subsequent biography and have become embedded in a body of Keats legend.|$|E

Although only in her mid-thirties, Fuller's background made her [...] "one of the most experienced artists in Western Australia at this time". For the next four years, she painted portraits, including one of Western Australian politician James George Lee Steere, undertaken posthumously from photographs and recollections of those who <b>had</b> <b>known</b> <b>him.</b> It was acquired by the gallery whose board he chaired. She also took on students, including French-Australian artist Kathleen O'Connor.|$|E
500|$|In Newgate prison, Bellingham was {{questioned}} by [...] magistrates. His calm demeanour and poise led them, unlike Hume, to doubt his sanity, although his keepers had observed {{no signs of}} unbalanced behaviour. James Harmer, Bellingham's solicitor, knew that insanity would provide the only conceivable defence for his client, and despatched agents to Liverpool to make enquiries there. While awaiting their reports he learned from an informant that Bellingham's father had died insane; he also heard evidence of Bellingham's supposed derangement from Ann Billett, the prisoner's cousin, who <b>had</b> <b>known</b> <b>him</b> from childhood. On 14 May a grand jury met in the Sessions House, Clerkenwell, and after hearing evidence from the eyewitnesses, found [...] "a true Bill against John Bellingham {{for the murder of}} Spencer Perceval". The trial was arranged to take place the next day, Friday 15 May 1812, at the Old Bailey.|$|E

One day, to Deare's surprise, a small group of warriors approached his party from the west, carrying a letter. This message, written in English and signed [...] "Changa-Changa, Chief of the Mashukulumbwe"—the name John Harrison Clark was given {{in the body of the}} letter—said that its author had heard of a white man being entertained recently by Mpezeni, and wished to provide the same hospitality at Algoa. [...] "Really, wonders never cease!" [...] Deare recalled. [...] "I had heard of this man on the Zambezi and <b>had</b> <b>known</b> <b>him</b> well many years ago in the Cape Colony... We had both lived in the same town for years. I learnt his story later." [...] It is unclear whether Deare took up Clark's invitation to Algoa.|$|E
500|$|As to his {{national}}ism, {{he wished}} to see Scotland {{on an equal footing}} with other nations. His national pride was intense; in a Preparatory Note to The Voyage of the Scotia he wrote: [...] "While 'Science' was the talisman of the Expedition, 'Scotland' was emblazoned on its flag". This insistence on emphasising the Scottish character of his enterprises could be irksome to those who did not share his passion. However, he retained the respect and devotion of those whom he led, and of those who <b>had</b> <b>known</b> <b>him</b> longest. John Arthur Thomson, who had known Bruce since Granton, wrote of him when reviewing Rudmose Brown's 1923 biography: [...] "We never heard him once grumble about himself, though he was neither to hold or bend when he thought some injustice was being done to, or slight cast on, his men, on his colleagues, on his laboratory, on his Scotland. Then one got glimpses of the volcano which his gentle spirit usually kept sleeping".|$|E
500|$|In April 1844, Verdi took on Emanuele Muzio, {{eight years}} his junior, as a pupil and amanuensis. He <b>had</b> <b>known</b> <b>him</b> since about 1828 as another of Barezzi's protégés. Muzio, who in fact was Verdi's only pupil, became {{indispensable}} to the composer. He reported to Barezzi that Verdi [...] "has a breadth of spirit, of generosity, a wisdom." [...] In November 1846, Muzio wrote of Verdi: [...] "If {{you could see}} us, I seem more like a friend, rather than his pupil. We are always together at dinner, in the cafes, when we play cards...; all in all, he doesn't go anywhere without me at his side; in the house {{we have a big}} table and we both write there together, and so I always have his advice." [...] Muzio was to remain associated with Verdi, assisting in the preparation of scores and transcriptions, and later conducting many of his works in their premiere performances in the US and elsewhere outside Italy. He was chosen by Verdi as one of the executors of his will, but predeceased the composer in 1890.|$|E

500|$|Oscar Ramiro Ortega-Hernandez, an {{unemployed}} 21-year-old man, left {{his home in}} Idaho Falls, Idaho on October 23, three weeks prior to the shooting. He told {{his friends and family}} {{that he was going to}} Utah for a business trip; his family reported him missing on October 31 after he failed to return. According to friends, Ortega-Hernandez had become increasingly paranoid before leaving, saying that the United States government was controlling citizens and that President Barack Obama [...] "had to be stopped". The mother of Ortega-Hernandez's former fiancée stated that he had been well-mannered for the four years she <b>had</b> <b>known</b> <b>him,</b> but had recently started making bizarre statements. On July 8, he had told an acquaintance that Obama was planning to put GPS tracking devices into children and that the world would end in 2012. In September, he made a video for Oprah Winfrey, explaining that he was Jesus and asking to appear on her television show. On his 21st birthday in October, he made a 45-minute speech on various topics including a warning of the dangers of secret societies. Ortega-Hernandez had a 2-year-old son with his former fiancée; it is unknown when or why they separated.|$|E
500|$|After a {{visit to}} Birmingham, Bache moved to Rome in 1863 and lived there the next two years. While there he {{received}} private lessons from Liszt, {{one of the few}} pupils thus privileged; most of Liszt's students attended only his master classes. He also heard Liszt play his own music on many occasions in private homes, including a then-rare performance of the Piano Sonata in B minor. Liszt helped him prepare for several public concerts in Rome and encouraged him to learn some difficult pieces that Bache initially felt unable to play; these pieces included Liszt's transcriptions of Gounod's Faust Waltz and Meyerbeer's [...] "Patineurs" [...] Waltz from his opera Le prophète. These lessons, the kindness that Liszt continually showed, and Bache's exposure to Liszt in general, became a life-defining experience. Liszt expected him to work hard and Bache applied himself with a purpose to his keyboard studies. The same [...] "musician of high standing" [...] that Constance quotes about Bache's years in Leipzig also states that [...] "there {{can be no doubt that}} it was his friendship with Liszt that he owed that enthusiasm and power of sustained hard work which distinguished him during his career in London, and which was often the astonishment of those who <b>had</b> <b>known</b> <b>him</b> in earlier years." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{years from}} 1801 to 1804 are {{something}} of a blank space for Austen scholars as Cassandra destroyed all of her letters from her sister in this period for unknown reasons. In December 1802 Austen received her only known proposal of marriage. She and her sister visited Alethea and Catherine Bigg, old friends who lived near Basingstoke. Their younger brother, Harris Bigg-Wither, had recently finished his education at Oxford and was also at home. Bigg-Wither proposed and Austen accepted. As described by Caroline Austen, Jane's niece, and Reginald Bigg-Wither, a descendant, Harris was not attractive – he was a large, plain-looking man who spoke little, stuttered when he did speak, was aggressive in conversation, and almost completely tactless. However, Austen <b>had</b> <b>known</b> <b>him</b> since both were young and the marriage offered many practical advantages to Austen and her family. He was the heir to extensive family estates located {{in the area where}} the sisters had grown up. With these resources, Austen could provide her parents a comfortable old age, give Cassandra a permanent home and, perhaps, assist her brothers in their careers. By the next morning, Austen realised she had made a mistake and withdrew her acceptance. No contemporary letters or diaries describe how Austen felt about this proposal. In 1814, Austen wrote a letter to her niece, Fanny Knight, who had asked for advice about a serious relationship, telling her that [...] "having written so much {{on one side of the}} question, I shall now turn around & entreat you not to commit yourself farther, & not to think of accepting him unless you really do like him. Anything is to be preferred or endured rather than marrying without Affection". The English scholar Douglas Bush wrote that Austen had [...] "had a very high ideal of the love that should unite a husband and wife... All of her heroines... know in proportion to their maturity, the meaning of ardent love". A possible autobiographical element in Sense and Sensibility occurs when Elinor Dashwood contemplates that [...] "the worse and most irremediable of all evils, a connection for life" [...] with an unsuitable man.|$|E
