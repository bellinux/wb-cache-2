In this experiment, tissue oxygenation was compared in anesthetized pigs receiving a placebo or water enriched in O 2 by injection or a new electrolytic process. Methods: Forty-two pigs randomized in three groups received either mineral water as placebo or water enriched in O 2 by injection or the electrolytic process (10 mL/kg in the stomach). Hemodynamic parameters, partial pressure of oxygen in the arterial blood (PaO 2), skin blood flow, and tissue oxygenation (transcutaneous oxygen pressure, or TcPO 2) were monitored during 90 minutes of general anesthesia. Absorption and tissue distribution of the three waters administered were assessed using dilution of deuterium oxide. Results: Mean arterial pressure, heart rate, PaO 2, arteriovenous oxygen difference, and water absorption from the gut were not significantly different among the three groups. The deuterium to protium ratio was also similar in the plasma, skin, and muscle {{at the end of the}} protocol. Skin blood flow decreased in the three groups. TcPO 2 slowly decreased over the last 60 minutes of the experiment in the three groups, but when compared to the control group, the values remained significantly higher in animals that received the water enriched in O 2 by electrolysis. Conclusions: In this protocol, water enriched in O 2 by electrolysis lessened the decline of peripheral tissue oxygenation. This observation is compatible with the claim that the electrolytic process generates water clathrates which trap O 2 and facilitate O 2 diffusion along pressure gradients. Potential applications of O 2 -enriched water include an alternate method of oxygen supply.

Despite the evidence that SCP/TAPS proteins of parasitic nematodes are involved in host-parasite interactions, there is a paucity of information on this protein family for parasitic trematodes of socio-economic importance. Methodology/Principal Findings: We conducted the first large-scale study of SCP/TAPS proteins {{of a range of}} parasitic trematodes of both human and veterinary importance (including the liver flukes Clonorchis sinensis, Opisthorchis viverrini, Fasciola hepatica and F. gigantica as well as the blood flukes Schistosoma mansoni, S. japonicum and S. haematobium).

We studied the extent of contamination in the environment of hospitalised children with cystic fibrosis (CF) associated with specific activities. We assessed the levels of bacterial contamination in 432 air and surface samples collected from various locations in our CF centre over a three-month period: the bedrooms, corridor, communal showers, school, leisure centre and the respiratory <b>functional</b> <b>explorations</b> (RFE) unit. Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains found in bedrooms and the RFE were compared with those found in patient expectorations using pulsed field gel electrophoresis. In all sampling locations, there were high levels of airborne contamination just after the presence of patients or nursing staff. In the bedrooms, the amount of S. aureus or P. aeruginosa in the air, at wake-up and after physiotherapy, were significantly higher than that after the bedroom had been cleaned. For P. aeruginosa, 33 % of isolates were multiresistant to antibiotics; 50 % of the colonised patients had the same P. aeruginosa strain in their sputum as in air taken from their bedroom. P. aeruginosa was detected in 23 % of samples taken from the surfaces in the showers after patient washing. Very low levels of pathogenic bacteria were found in samples from the other locations. Overall, activities with the highest risk of contamination in the CF ward are physiotherapy and washing in the communal shower room.

The functional and endoscopic pre-operative work-up did not enable to isolate a group of patients likely to present a therapeutic failure. 54 patients were seen again at 1 year, with a good clinical result in 50 of them (92 per cent). At 4 years, 39 out of 48 patients (81 per cent) maintained that result. The acid reflux test was abnormal in all cases of clinical recurrence. Two asymptomatic patients had an abnormal test.

40|$|Background: Tissue inhibitors of metalloproteases (TIMPs) are a {{multifunctional}} {{family of}} proteins that orchestrate extracellular matrix turnover, tissue remodelling and other cellular processes. In parasitic helminths, such as hookworms, TIMPs {{have been proposed}} to play key roles in the host-parasite interplay, including invasion of and establishment in the vertebrate animal hosts. Currently, knowledge of helminth TIMPs {{is limited to a}} small number of studies on canine hookworms, whereas no information is available on the occurrence of TIMPs in other parasitic helminths causing neglected diseases. Methods: In the present study, we conducted a large-scale investigation of TIMP proteins of a range of neglected human parasites including the hookworm Necator americanus, the roundworm Ascaris suum, the liver flukes Clonorchis sinensis and Opisthorchis viverrini, as well as the schistosome blood flukes. This entailed mining available transcriptomic and/or genomic sequence datasets for the presence of homologues of known TIMPs, predicting secondary structures of defined protein sequences, systematic phylogenetic analyses and assessment of differential expression of genes encoding putative TIMPs in the developmental stages of A. suum, N. americanus and Schistosoma haematobium which infect the mammalian hosts. Results: A total of 15 protein sequences with high homology to known eukaryotic TIMPs were predicted from the complement of sequence data available for parasitic helminths and subjected to in-depth bioinformatic analyses. Conclusions: Supported by the availability of gene manipulation technologies such as RNA interference and/or transgenesis, this work provides a basis for future <b>functional</b> <b>explorations</b> of helminth TIMPs and, in particular, of their role/s in fundamental biological pathways linked to long-term establishment in the vertebrate hosts, with a view towards the development of novel approaches for the control of neglected helminthiases...|$|R

Materials and methods: Mitochondrial respiration was compared in situ in saponin-skinned fibers isolated from the soleus muscles of Wistar rats, in solution enriched in O 2 by injection or the electrolytic process 1) at an O 2 concentration decreasing from 240 µmol/L to 10 µmol/L (132  mmHg to 5 mmHg), with glutamate–malate or N, N, N&# 39;, N&# 39;-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (TMPD) –ascorbate (with antimycin A) as substrates; and 2) at increasing adenosine diphosphate (ADP) concentration with glutamate–malate as substrate. Results: As expected, maximal respiration decreased with O 2 concentration and, when compared to glutamate–malate, the apparent Km O 2 of mitochondria for O 2 was significantly lower with TMPD–ascorbate with both waters. However, when compared to the water enriched in O 2 by injection, the Km O 2 was significantly lower with both electron donors in water enriched in O 2 by electrolysis. This was not associated with any increase in the sensitivity of mitochondria to ADP; no significant difference was observed for the Km ADP between the two waters.

The optimized design process consists of mapping one of the possible expressions in the application space onto a concurrent architecture. We use the Metropolis design framework to demonstrate the effectiveness of the procedure using an FPGA architecture as the target implementation platform. The advantage of using this platform is the availability of models that approximate well the performance of the final implementation when performing the mapping from function to architecture thus yielding a robust design methodology. ...|$|R
