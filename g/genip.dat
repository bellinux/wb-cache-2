5000|$|This genus used {{to contain}} only 5 species, {{but the number}} has tripled since a number of plants {{formerly}} believed to be genip-trees - the [...] "Genipa sensu Drake" [...] group - were recognized to be not as closely related to <b>genips</b> as was previously believed. Those species are now placed in Hyperacanthus, at least provisionally: ...|$|R
5000|$|In 1664 Du Tertre {{described}} some behavioural {{traits of}} the Guadeloupe amazon, and listed items among its diet: When it erects the feathers of its neck, {{it makes a}} beautiful ruff about its head, which it seems to admire, as a peacock its tail. It has a strong voice, talks very distinctly, and learns quickly if taken young. It lives on the wild fruits which grow in the forests, except {{that it does not}} eat the manchioneel. Cotton seed intoxicates it, and affects it as wine does a man; and for that reason they eat it with great eagerness... The flavor of its flesh is excellent, but changeable, according to the kind of food. If it eats cashew nuts, the flesh has an agreeable flavor of garlic; if 'bois des inde' it has a flavor of cloves and cinnamon; if on bitter fruits, it becomes bitter like gall. If it feeds on <b>genips,</b> the flesh becomes wholly black, but that does not prevent its having a very fine flavor. When it feeds on guavas it is at its best, and then the French commit great havoc among them. Clark noted that the Saint Vincent amazon and other amazon species can also raise a [...] "ruff" [...] of feathers around their neck when excited.|$|R
50|$|The festival {{includes}} {{arts and}} crafts, food, folkloric music, games, {{and plenty of}} farmers market quenepas. It also includes a competition for the most unusual quenepa-based dish. All {{the activities of the}} festival center on the <b>genip</b> fruit. As such, much of the foods, from cakes to juices, are based <b>genip</b> fruit recipes. Likewise, crafts are made, displayed and sold that are based on the seed of the <b>genip</b> fruit.|$|E

50|$|The Festival Nacional de la Quenepa (English: National <b>Genip</b> Fruit Festival) is a {{cultural}} celebration that takes place every year in Ponce, Puerto Rico. The festival centers on the <b>genip</b> fruit, the city's official fruit. The celebration lasts three days and takes place over a weekend (Friday through Sunday). It is generally held on the second weekend of August, but occasionally during a weekend in September. It {{is sponsored by the}} Ponce Municipal Government.|$|E
5000|$|In Old English {{there were}} three words that could mean darkness: heolstor, <b>genip,</b> and sceadu. Heolstor also meant [...] "hiding-place" [...] and became holster. <b>Genip</b> meant [...] "mist" [...] and fell out of use like many strong verbs. It is however still used in the Dutch saying [...] "in het geniep" [...] which means secretly. Sceadu meant [...] "shadow" [...] and {{remained}} in use. The word dark eventually evolved from the word deorc.|$|E
50|$|Fruits {{consumed}} in the Virgin Islands include: sugar apple, mango, papaya, soursop, <b>genip,</b> sea grapes, tamarind (can be made in a sweet stew or rolled in sweet balls), and goose berries (small green sour fruit, smaller than a grape). These fruits are mainly stewed together with sugar for a sweet snack.|$|E
50|$|Genipa, the genip-trees, are a genus of {{flowering}} {{plants in the}} family Rubiaceae. This genus is closely allied to Gardenia; several Gardenia species were originally placed in Genipa. It {{is not to be}} confused with <b>genip</b> (Melicoccus bijugatus), a completely unrelated eudicot. The name is derived from genipapo, the Guianan name for G. americana (commonly known as huito). The genus is also commonly called jagua, xagua or xaqua.|$|E

There are many local foods growing within the estate such as Mango, Guava, Soursop, Kenep or <b>Genip,</b> Breadfruit, Banana, Sugar Apple, Plum, Golden Apple, Sugar Cane, Coconut, and more. Many residential lots contain small gardens of various herb, spices and teas. The local people refer to these herbs as [...] "Bush Tea" [...] they are used for everyday drinking, as well as medicine.|$|E
5000|$|Melicoccus bijugatus is {{native to}} {{northern}} South America and naturalised in coastal and dry forest in Central America, the Caribbean {{and parts of the}} Old World tropics.

The black dye is thought to repel insects and the designs are known as Jagua Tattoos. On special occasions, using this same dye, they print {{intricate}} geometric patterns all over their bodies, using wood blocks carved from balsa wood. The women also wear silver necklaces and silver earrings on these special occasions; many of the necklaces being made of old silver coins. They punch {{a hole in the}} coin and run a silver chain through it. Many of the coins on these necklaces date to the 19th century and are passed down from mother to daughter.|$|E

40|$|This essay {{deals with}} the Scandinavian loanword sky {{and its role in}} the {{configuration}} of the semantic field concerning ‘sky’, ‘air’, and ‘cloud’ during the transition between Old and Middle English. Firstly, the etymology and Germanic cognates of OE scēo ‘cloud’ and ON ský ‘cloud’ are discussed. Secondly, the context of the only occurrence of OE scēo in the Exeter Book Riddle 1 is explored and it is argued that this hapax could be explained as a lectio difficilior, that is as an archaism, even a relict word which had not established itself in common OE usage and which the learned, articulate poet of the Exeter Riddle retrieved in his ingenious search for ever diverse, nuanced vocabulary. It is therefore concluded both that OE scēo had already died out by the time ON ský was borrowed in the Middle English period, and that the former never really competed with the latter anyway, the most common OE terms for ‘cloud’ and ‘sky’ being wolcen, <b>genip,</b> lyft, and heofon respectively. Indeed, the ultimate success of Norse-derived sky over or alongside these native equivalents can be put down to a process of progressive semantic differentiation and specialisation within the semantic field in question...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the practices used in Saladoid and Taíno medicine {{with the use}} of historical accounts, specifically from Hispaniola, and uncovers other plants that were employed in medicinal context {{with the use of}} ethnoarchaeology. Taíno traditional medicine was in part practiced by shamans, working with hallucinogenic plants, and in part by housewives, preparing herbal remedies. The shamanistic medicine is described in detail by Spanish chroniclers and was a common feature of Taíno cultures. The plants used in this context were cohoba (Anadenanthera peregrina), a strong kind of tobacco (güeyo), and an energizing and hunger suppressing herb called digo, {{which may or may not}} have been coca (Erythroxylum coca). Hardly anything, however, is accounted on domestic medicine and, therefore, the last chapter applies ethnoarchaeology to modern herbal medicine in the Caribbean, in search of plants of which the use could date back to prehistory. Nine plants that were used by the Ostionoid and Saladoid peoples and are currently employed as medicine in the Caribbean are studied. These are: West Indian elm (Guazuma ulmifolica), monkey pistol (Hura Crepitans), cf. soursop (Annona muricata), cassava (Manihot esculenta), <b>genip</b> (Melicoccus bijugatus), red mangrove (Rhizophora mangle), maize (Zea mays), guava (Psidium guajava) and red pepper (Capsicum sp.). The last two have such a widespread and significant use that they were relatively certainly used as medicine as early as prehistory. Another discovery is the identification of a gum used for stomach problems by the Taíno, which was the gum of mesquite, (Prosopis juliflora) ...|$|E
40|$|Lithium-ion {{batteries}} (LIB) are {{the best}} option among batteries for portable electronic, power tools, and electric vehicles due to their higher energy storage, higher power, and lighter weight than other battery technologies such as Ni-based or lead acid. However, Li-ion batteries still face challenges such as safety, life, performance, and cost. One way {{to contribute to the}} solutions of these challenges and, consequently, improve the performance of Li-ion cells is to develop and design more stable passivation films at the electrode-electrolyte interface. Therefore, having {{a better understanding of the}} molecular processes that lead to the nucleation, growth, structure and morphology, as well as the electron and ion transport properties of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) is highly important for the development of new or improved lithium-ion batteries. In this work, computational methods, which allow studying phenomena not easily observable with experimental techniques, are used to study the electron transfer characteristics and the lithium ion diffusivity of the materials found in the SEI film formed in LIB with silicon anodes. First, ab initio computational methods are used to study the electron transfer through selected finite models of SEI films formed at the anode-electrolyte interface. A combined ab initio density functional theory (DFT) and Green?s functions approach, as implemented in the Generalized Electron Nano-Interface Program (<b>GENIP),</b> is used to calculate the current-voltage characteristics of selected SEI configurations. The models studied consist of a LixSiy cluster, a SEI product (LiF, Li 2 O or Li 2 CO 3), and an electrolyte component, ethylene carbonate (EC). Various parameters are considered in the investigation including: various lithiated states for the anode; several thicknesses and configurations for the SEI layer; and the presence of surface oxides (SiO 2 and Li 2 Si 2 O 5). The trend of conductance is found to be Li 2 O > SiO 2 > LiF > Li 2 CO 3 > Li 2 Si 2 O 5, at the same applied voltage and anode configuration. Then, lithium-ion diffusion is studied in the main components of the SEI layer using classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in order to provide insights and to calculate the diffusion coefficients of Li-ions at temperatures in the range of 250 K to 400 K. The compounds studied are lithium fluoride (LiF), lithium oxide (Li 2 O) and lithium carbonate (Li 2 CO 3). A slight increase in the diffusivity as the temperature increases is found and since diffusion is noticeable at high temperatures, Li-ion diffusion in the range of 1300 to 1800 K is also studied and the diffusion mechanisms involved in each SEI compound are analyzed. The mechanisms of Li-ion diffusion observed include vacancy assisted and knock-off diffusion in LiF, direct exchange in Li 2 O, and vacancy and knock-off in Li 2 CO 3. Moreover, the effect that an applied an electric field has in the diffusion of Li-ions at room temperature is also evaluated. The long-term goal is to eventually have more control over interface parameters such as composition, structure, porosity and thickness, and thus accurately design SEI films and therefore better Li-ion batteries. This work is a step towards this ultimate goal...|$|E
