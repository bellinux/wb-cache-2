500|$|Kills {{discussed}} Perfectionist during 2013 interviews. She {{revealed that}} after having lived a deplorable life in London, her ambitions and dreams influenced the album's lyrics. [...] "I {{was not as}} aware of... how I was", she stated. [...] "I almost {{had a bit of}} fear where <b>everybody</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> loved, <b>everybody</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> understood in a way that's not full of judgment or blame. So I put all of myself into the album and then [...] bits out." [...] That year, Corner hailed Perfectionist as [...] "one of the most underrated pop collections in recent memory", and Idolator's Sam Lansky opined that although it had [...] "killer" [...] choruses, the album suffered from excessive similarities to other artists.|$|E
500|$|Bangalter and Homem-Christo have {{credited}} {{many sources}} that influenced their musical style. Bangalter recalled that the records motivated him to learn English {{as a second}} language, since he wanted to understand the lyrics. The duo's mutual admiration for rock bands led to the founding of their own indie group called Darlin'. Bangalter explained: [...] "It was still maybe more a teenage thing at that time. It's like, you know, <b>everybody</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> in a band." [...] They also drew inspiration from the rock and acid house in the United Kingdom during the early 1990s. Homem-Christo referred to Screamadelica by Primal Scream as the record that [...] "put everything together" [...] in terms of genre".|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Software {{architecture}} {{is taking a}} bad rap with many agile proponents; big up-front design, massive documentation, smell of waterfall, it is pictured as a non-agile practice, something we do not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> even consider; though <b>everybody</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> called an architect. However, certain classes of system, ignoring architectural issues too long “hit a wall ” and collapse by lack of an architectural focus. Agile architecture: a paradox, an oxymoron, two totally incompatible approaches? In this paper we review the real issues at stake, past the rhetoric and posturing, and we suggest that the two cultures can coexist and support each other, where appropriate...|$|R

2500|$|Another strong {{theme from}} {{the album is}} peer pressure, {{particularly}} due to the band's part-Christian-part-mainstream status. The song [...] "Gravity" [...] refers to the opposing influences of Heaven and the secular world pulling the band in opposite directions, whilst [...] "Metamorphis" [...] further explores [...] "the fact that out in the world, although <b>everybody</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> their own selves, we're pulled this way and that. Everyone you meet wants you to be something or another. The song asks God to help us to be our own true selves, as God sees us, not the way folk pressure us to be what {{they want us to}} be." [...] "Bliss" [...] deals with accusations of selling out; in the words of Stu G, [...] "we know exactly where we want to go, we want to take our music to the world and have it recognized as being as good as anything that's out there. But we're not going to compromise or back away from our integrity as Christians." ...|$|E
2500|$|To GM's product {{planners}} and marketers, {{the fact that}} the Corvette had become known as an [...] "old man's toy" [...] became a prime factor in developing the next generation. Studies showed that about 46 percent of Corvette buyers in 2012, through October, were 55 or older, compared with 22 percent of Audi R8 and 30 percent of Porsche 911 customers. The head of Chevy marketing, Chris Perry, acknowledges that too many people saw it as the car of [...] "the successful plumber." [...] John Fitzpatrick, Corvette's marketing manager said [...] "It's the old saying, 'Nobody wants to be seen driving an old man's car, but <b>everybody</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> seen driving a young man's car.' [...] " [...] To counter that perception GM planned to make the new generation C7 more aspirational to younger people. Towards that end, a camouflaged version of the car was made available in the popular video game Gran Turismo 5 in November 2012. [...] As part of the marketing effort associated with the introduction of the new generation, the 2013 Indianapolis 500 utilized a Corvette for the 12th time as its pace car.|$|E
2500|$|Ewan McGregor {{was offered}} the part of King Edward VIII, but was later {{replaced}} by James D'Arcy. Additionally, producer David Parfitt and casting director Nina Gold also quit W.E., with sources claiming that the duo had [...] "creative differences" [...] with Madonna and found that she struggled to [...] "collaborate and delegate". Actress Margo Stilley was {{to play the role}} of Lady Thelma Furness, but left the project, citing [...] "artistic differences" [...] with Madonna. Stilley said: [...] "I had the role, but we had artistic differences. She (Madonna) is really something. I wish the cast luck because they are all really talented." [...] In her place, Katie McGrath joined the cast. Judy Parfitt was signed to portray Queen Mary and Geoffrey Palmer as Stanley Baldwin. Real-life father and son James and Laurence Fox were signed to the parts of King George V and his son, Bertie—Edward's younger brother. BBC reported that members of the London Welsh Center expressed interest in appearing for a scene in the film, which involves Edward being shocked at the living conditions in Welsh mining villages. A spokesperson for the centre, which was contacted by the film's casting agency, said: [...] "I've had about 15 phone calls this morning, and yesterday was bedlam because <b>everybody</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> in a film with Madonna." [...] The centre said Welsh-speakers were needed as extras to create scenes based on Edward's visits to the south Wales valleys in the 1930s. Actress Natalie Dormer was cast to play the part of a young Queen Elizabeth (Queen Mother). Dormer reflected on the role, saying: [...] "This country tends to remember the Queen Mother as a rather wrinkly 97-year-old, but I am playing her when she was quite an enchanting, engaging twenty- and thirty-something. [...] She was quite a savage and savvy game player." [...] Dormer's assertion of the role was confirmed by royal historian Hugo Vickers, who was sought by Madonna to advise her on the characteristics of the different members of the royal family. He confirmed that Madonna was portraying the Queen Mother as an unfavorable influence on the relationship between Edward VIII and Simpson.|$|E

500|$|... "Lovely" [...] {{introduced}} an ongoing storyline of Katherine Mayfair exploring her sexuality. Actress Dana Delany, who previously played a lesbian {{character in the}} Showtime series The L Word, said she felt the subplot was an excellent idea: [...] "A lot of the ladies on the set have said, 'Why has this not happened before?' I think <b>everybody</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{the one who got}} to do it." [...] In an interview with E! Online, actress Marcia Cross jokingly said of the kiss scene, [...] "I'm a little jealous that I'm not involved. What is going on?" [...] Delany said she did not know if the character would become a lesbian permanently, because the story lines change so often in Desperate Housewives, but that series creator Marc Cherry [...] "is interested in playing the complexity of that". The pairing between Robin and Katherine was the first lesbian relationship in Desperate Housewives.|$|R

Midnight is a real time strategy game who utilizes the rock, paper, scissor principal in the balancing of the teams.

In the method part of this report, I <b>am</b> going <b>to</b> explain how the pipeline looked and worked. The process that was used started with the production of concept art, turnarounds were produced and it was then modeled and textured. When it was complete, rigging and animation were commenced, and the artifacts were then put into the game. The pipeline worked rather good later in the production, but was inefficient in the beginning because of other projects and courses colliding with this one. There were some problems with the structuring of the different teams. <b>Everybody</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a part of everything. This led to inefficiency.

40|$|In The Spirit of the Laws, Montesquieu {{tried not}} to discuss about laws, but in fact, about the type of power hiding behind them. Inspired by Plato and Aristotle, he built his own vision on the palingenesis of the {{political}} forms and of the principles governing them. Baron de La Brède started from ideas, from spiritual structures, that have the role to create certain social behaviors, and identified three types of government forms, each characterized by its own nature and principle: monarchy, democracy, and despotism. The French philosopher tried to understand, besides the principles ensuring the nature of each government, the key elements legitimating the power and also its sources. The monarchy is seen by Montesquieu as the most suitable regime, for his time, to rule free societies. The aristocracy helps {{to the maintenance of}} freedom in royalty by resisting to any attempt of the crown to exceed its constitutional prerogatives. The transition from one form of government <b>to</b> another <b>is</b> done because of the alteration of principles. Democracy is maybe the most exposed to alteration as its excess of freedom leads to the affirmation of the spirit of endless equality that makes <b>everybody</b> <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the equals <b>to</b> the rulers. Montesquieu sees no other solution to replace the degraded forms of political organization than the confederative republic. Such a political organization would answer the need for permanent political flexibility...|$|R
