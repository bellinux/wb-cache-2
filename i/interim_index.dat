50|$|The {{traditional}} {{measure of}} inflation in the UK {{for many years}} was the Retail Prices Index (RPI), which was first calculated in the early 20th century to evaluate {{the extent to which}} workers were affected by price changes during the First World War. The main index was described as the <b>Interim</b> <b>Index</b> of Retail Prices from 1947 to 1955. In January 1956, it was rebased and renamed the Index of Retail Prices. In January 1962 this was replaced by the General Index of Retail Prices, which was again rebased at that time. A further rebasing occurred in January 1987, subsequent to the issue of the first index-linked gilts.|$|E
40|$|By {{employing}} {{the concept of}} reliability index, an <b>interim</b> <b>index</b> of "comparative reliability" is proposed that bypasses the loading variables and weighs the resistances of two structural elements with the same ultimate limit state directly against each other. The comparative reliability index is then related to the conventional target reliability to allow a simple calculation method of the strength reduction factor for elements whose safety factor {{is yet to be}} calibrated. This is achieved by comparing a pair of elements that experience the same failure mode and yet only one holds a validated level of safety (that is, strength reduction factor and reliability index). This concept is put into practice by calculating flexural and shear-strength reduction factors for fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) reinforced concrete (RC) members by comparison with conventional steel-reinforced concrete beams possessing the same ultimate capacity. As a result, a revised set of strength reduction factors and deign provisions are proposed for use in FRP design guidelines for shear and flexure...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. (Botany)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2010. In a {{semi-arid}} {{country like}} South Africa, {{the availability and}} quality of water has always played {{an important part in}} determining not only where people can live, but also their quality of life. The supply of water is also becoming a restriction to the socio-economic development of the country, in terms of both {{the quality and quantity of}} what is available. Thus different monitoring techniques should be put in place to help inform the process of conserving this precious commodity and to improve the quality of what is already available. Water quality monitoring has traditionally been by the means of physico-chemical analysis; this has more recently been augmented with the use of biomonitoring techniques. However, since the biota commonly used to indicate aquatic conditions are not always present in wetlands; this study tested the use of diatoms as bio-indicators in wetlands. Diatom samples were collected from thirteen wetlands in the Western Cape Province, and cells from these communities were enumerated and diatom ?based indices were calculated using version 3. 1 of OMNIDIA. These indices were useful for indicating water quality conditions when compared to the measured physico-chemical parameters. In addition, most diatom species found were common to those found in riverine environments, making the transfer of ecological optima possible. The objective of the study was to provide a preliminary diatom-based index for wetlands, however, given the relatively small study area and the strong bias towards coastal wetlands it was deemed inadvisable to construct such an index, instead several indices are recommended for interim use until further research that more comprehensively covers wetlands in South Africa has been conducted. It is thus the recommendation of this study that more data is collected for comparison to other wetlands and that in the <b>interim,</b> <b>indices</b> such as SPI be applied for routine biomonitoring of these environments.

30|$|This alterative way {{to process}} {{recruitment}} illustrates {{one of the}} benefits of recasting models: advances in computer technology have created more revealing ways to represent concepts, and pose fewer restrictions on computational resources, allowing modellers to focus on good representations rather than computational efficiency (Vanclay, 2003). The challenge is for modellers to break free of old paradigms and fully exploit these new opportunities, and not merely follow a well-trodden path without question. Leary (1985, p. 47), commenting on a related matter, warned that “what began as an <b>interim</b> solution (site <b>index)</b> to a difficult problem (geocentric approach [to site productivity estimation]) should not now be called the solution to the original problem” and his caveat applies equally to modelling.|$|R

40|$|In {{an effort}} {{to develop a new}} {{approach}} to comprehensive college and university planning, Colgate University and the Amencan Foundation for Management Research (AFMR.) undertook a loint study that involved (1) an intensive investigation of planning practices at selected colleges and universities, (2) a review of the available literature on planning, (3) the observation of planning practices in business and industry, and (4) consultations with various planning experts. Generally, the trial planning process that was developed for Colgate University involved a 1 -week session to discuss institutional oblectives and to define strategies for long-term development. The institutional data collected during an <b>interim</b> period were <b>indexed</b> and analyzed, and a second 1 -week session concentrated on the analysis of these data to identify significant internal trends of the university and their relationship to environmental influences. Planning "gaps " were identified, alternate Courses of action were broken down into specific programs, and a planning guide for future comprehensive planning was developed. This process, which has also been tested at Franklin and Marshall College, compresses the amount of time required for planning but provides...|$|R

The process of fracture healing was similar to the <b>interim</b> <b>indices</b> in rats groups II and III, which was introduced at the fracture site platelet-rich plasma and performed phonophoresis with a fixed dose of poison. By the nature of the formation of callus, they differed. Therefore, in groups I and III process occurred on osteogenic type, and in group II on chondrogenic. In applying the platelet-rich plasma activated alkaline phosphatase decreased plasma calcium and phosphorus content in it. Under the influence of the activation proceeds phonophoresisCa²+ in the fracture, but unlike the II-group, this process is punctuated character. Suggested that the enriched plasma and phonophoresis with "Apizartron" promotes greater intake of calcium in the fracture, and promotes the activation of repair processes in the population of osteocytes. Keywords: fracture of the fibula; platelet-rich plasma; calcium metabolism; alkaline phosphatase; phonophoresis. Реферат На 92 белых крысах – самцах аутобредного разведения изучали влияние на процесс заживления перелома малой берцовой кости, а также обмен ионов Са²+, фосфора и активность щелочной фосфатазы в плазме крови. Процесс заживления перелома был одинаков по временным показателям у крыс II и III групп, которым в месте перелома вводилась плазма обогащенная тромбоцитами и проводился фонофорез с фиксированной дозой яда. По характеру процесса образования костной мозоли они отличались. Так в I и III группах процесс происходил по остеогенному типу, а во II группе по хондрогенному. При применении плазмы обогащенной тромбоцитами активируется щелочная фосфатаза плазмы и снижается содержание фосфора и кальция в ней. Под влиянием фонофареза происходит активация поступления Са²+ в облисть перелома, но в отличие от II-группы этот процесс носит перемежающий характер. Высказано пердположение, что обогащенная плазма и фонофарез с «Апизартноном» способствует более активному поступлению кальция в область перелома, а также способствует активации процессов репарации в популяции остеоцитов. Ключевые слова: перелом малоберцовой кости; плазма обогащенная тромбоцитами; обмен кальция; щелочная фосфатаза; фонофарез...|$|R
40|$|Background: Early diagnosis, prompt treatment, {{and disease}} {{containment}} are vital {{measures in the}} management of Lassa fever (LF), a lethal and contagious arenaviral hemorrhagic disease prevalent in West Africa. Lassa Virus (LAV) -specific Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) test, the gold standard for diagnosis, is unavailable in most centers. Serologic detection of LAV IgM is a more accessible tool and this work was to investigate its adequacy as an early marker for LF. Patients and Methods: A prospective case-control study conducted July 2007 -March 2011 in a tertiary referral health center in Nigeria. Blood samples for test and control were evaluated for Lassa specific antigens and IgM using RT-PCR (primers S 36 + and LVS 339) and indirect ELISA (Lassa Nucleo-protein (NP) -Antigen) respectively. RT-PCR outcome was used as standard to test for the sensitivity and specificity of IgM. Results: Of the 37 confirmed cases of LF infection by RT-PCR, 21 (57 %) were IgM positive. Amongst the 35 confirmed negative cases (control group), eight were IgM positive. The diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of the IgM assay were 57 % and 77 % respectively. The negative and positive predictive values of the IgM serological assay were 63 % and 72 %, respectively, while the efficiency of the test was 67 %. Conclusion: The specificity and sensitivity of IgM as a screening tool for early detection of LF appear weak and, hence, the need for a reliable LF "rapid screening kit" since RT-PCR is unavailable in most centers. In the <b>interim,</b> "high clinical <b>index</b> of suspicion," irrespective of IgM status, requires urgent referral to confirmatory centers...|$|R
