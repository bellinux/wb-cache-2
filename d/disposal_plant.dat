After some deed restrictions were lifted in 1985, the church sold the land to Palm Beach Exterminating owner Bernard Kolkana, who was planning the construction of a warehouse on the property. Unaware of the mass burial, Kolkana purchased the land for $175,000 in 1987, a year before his son, Jim, bought the land for $230,000.|$|E

Water comes from the Hyeongsan River, the multi-purpose Deokdong Dam and several streams. The city is divided into seven water districts, with eight filtration plants and seven sewage treatment plants. One of the sewage treatment plants, Angang Sewage <b>Disposal</b> <b>Plant</b> began operating in April 2005 by the co-investment of the Government of North Gyeongsang and Gyeongju City with a fund of 44,300,000,000 won to install facilities to prevent the pollution of the Hyeongsan River, which is a main water source for Gyeongju and Pohang residents. The plant is located on a spacious site with [...] in Homyeong-ri, Gangdong-myeon in Gyeongju where nature friendly facilities provide recreational venues for the locals. Through [...] of sewer pipes and 14 pumping stations, the plant has a capacity of 18,000 tonnes of domestic sewage per day that comes from Angang-eup, and Gangdong-myeon.

2500|$|After {{the closure}} of the lime kilns, John Clarkson sold the Mindarie Pastoral Company leases in 1952, and the area {{remained}} unpopulated and unused until 1981, when Smith Corporation purchased 316 hectares of land there for $5.5 million. In July 1984, the company announced plans to develop the land into [...] "Mindarie Keys", a $28 million marina and resort complex designed by James Christou & Partners, to be ready in time for the 1987 America's Cup in Fremantle. In the same year, plans were also proposed for a refuse <b>disposal</b> <b>plant</b> in the area to handle landfill waste from the Shire of Wanneroo, the City of Stirling and the City of Perth local areas. Both developments caused controversy with existing residents in nearby Quinns Rocks, who formed the Quinns Rocks Environment Group in June 1985 to bring together a formal opposition against the proposals. In 1988, Tamala Park was gazetted from land formerly part of southern Mindarie, and was set aside for refuse disposal, as well as public open space.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, the {{specific}} CO 2 emissions related to construction waste disposal were evaluated for major waste types {{and with the}} operation data collected on field survey from 17 waste <b>disposal</b> <b>plants</b> in Japan. At first, {{the specific}} CO 2 emissions were applied to the CO 2 emissions related to disposal of building demolition wastes. Secondly, emission differences brought about by varied selection of influential factors were analyzed. The influential factors evaluated were the CO 2 emissions of plant operation, transportation, oxidation/fermentation and landfill reclamation. As a result, {{it was found that}} determination of system boundary including influential factors {{had a lot to do}} with evaluation. OBJECTIVE It is difficult to estimate the CO 2 emission through building demolition waste treatment processes because there are varieties of building components and of waste process-ing approaches. In addition, different results of CO 2 emis-sion related to construction waste disposal may be expected depending on selection of influential factors. In this paper, CO 2 emissions caused by disposal of con-struction waste are discussed with the data based on field survey of 17 treatment and <b>disposal</b> <b>plants.</b> Furthermore, based on these data, CO 2 emission differences caused by de-termination of influential factors are discussed...|$|R
