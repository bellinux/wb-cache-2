5|$|A {{number of}} events in 2006 pushed {{renewable}} energy up the political agenda, including the US mid-term elections in November, which confirmed clean energy as a mainstream issue. Also in 2006, the Stern Review made a strong economic case for investing in low carbon technologies now, and argued that economic growth need not be incompatible with cutting energy consumption. According to a trend analysis <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>Nations</b> Environment Programme, climate change concerns coupled with recent high oil prices and increasing government support are driving increasing rates of investment in the renewable energy and energy efficiency industries.|$|E
5|$|Acheson was {{particularly}} worried that allowing {{the details of}} the coup to go public would damage the image of the US. The Rio Pact of 1947 had created the Organization of American States, or OAS, and this body had obtained jurisdiction over regional disputes <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>Nations.</b> In order to achieve this, the US had also committed to a policy of non-intervention {{in the internal affairs of}} other countries. If PBFORTUNE had become public knowledge, the fact that the US was supporting an invasion of a country that was also a member of the OAS would have represented a huge setback to US policy. Thus the State Department promptly ended the operation when they became aware that its cover was blown.|$|E

Thousands of refugees had crowded into the town to escape the Serb advance. Following the Serb takeover of Srebrenica, an estimated 8,000 Bosniak men and boys were systematically massacred by Serb forces between 11–15 July and another 25,000–30,000 were subjected to ethnic cleansing. It was the largest act of mass murder in Europe since World War II.|$|E
5|$|North Korea invaded South Korea on June 25, 1950.

On October 1, {{the first anniversary}} of the founding of the People's Republic, UN forces crossed the 38th parallel into North Korea. There was some disagreement within China's leadership about how to react to the American push to the Chinese border: Mao and Zhou wanted direct military intervention, while most Chinese leaders believed that China should not enter the war unless China was directly attacked. Lin Biao was Mao's first choice to lead the Chinese People's Volunteer Army (PVA) into Korea, but Lin refused, citing his bad health.|$|E

5|$|In {{the wake}} of Mora's death, the {{organization}} he worked with cancelled beach patrol efforts in Costa Rica. His death attracted international attention, including a statement <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>Nations</b> and multiple rewards {{for information on the}} case. In Costa Rica, his death led to calls for reform of environmental policy. On June 4, the government met with environmentalists to discuss potential changes to policy. A plan submitted by environmentalists and endorsed by Environment Minister René Castro would set up a new protected area and grant park rangers more authority to stop poachers, among other changes. On June 5, vigils were held across Costa Rica in honor of Mora. On June 18, the government announced the allocation of ₡20 million (US$40,000), which was later upped to ₡30 million (US$60,000), to memorialize Mora.|$|E

Abdulhadi al-Khawaja subsequently went on a new 110-day hunger strike. He was transferred to hospital in April as he kept reducing the amount of his glucose intake. On 30 April 2012, the Court of Cassation reduced Al-Hur Yousef al-Somaikh's sentence from two years to six months and he was released as he had already served his sentence. The court also announced that the thirteen other defendants would be retried by a (civilian) criminal court of appeal, but they were not released from prison, leading to criticism <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>Nations.</b>|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{after the}} storm moved inland, 700 civil defense {{personnel}} were deployed to the affected region; however, due to damaged roads and poor travel conditions, they struggled to reach isolated regions.

In response, agencies through the United Nations donated $735,000, including 20,000 water units and 3,000blankets.
