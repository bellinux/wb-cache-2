50|$|The {{protocol}} {{presents a}} summary of safety pharmacology studies in two species (rat, dog) and repeated dose toxicity studies in four species (13-week sub-chronic studies in mouse, dog and monkey; a 26-week chronic study in the rat). Of note, few adverse events were observed {{in any of the}} studies, with the oral No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) varying between 10 mg/kg/day in rats to 75 mg/kg/day in monkeys. The authors suggest that these were the maximum doses tested in these studies, though it is not clear. The authors also report no effects of significance in the animal models used for the CNS safety pharmacology studies, which studied a dose of up to 300 mg/kg/day. The protocol nominates a human NOAEL of 100 mg as a <b>human</b> <b>equivalent</b> <b>dose</b> to the 26-week rat NOAEL, though with no description how this was calculated. The summary presented however includes no assessment of the relevance of the animal species selected for study (that is, in terms of physiological and genetic similarities with humans and the mechanism of action of the study drug).

40|$|Abstract Background It is {{hypothesized}} that dietary linoleic acid (LA) promotes chronic and acute diseases in humans by enriching tissues with arachidonic acid (AA), its downstream metabolite, and dietary studies with rodents have been useful for validation. However, levels of LA in research diets of rodents, as {{published in the}} literature, are notoriously erratic making interspecies comparisons unreliable. Therefore, the ability to extrapolate the biological effects of dietary LA from experimental rodents to humans necessitates an allometric scaling model that is rooted within a <b>human</b> <b>equivalent</b> context. Methods To determine the physiological response of dietary LA on tissue AA, a mathematical model for extrapolating nutrients based on energy was used, as opposed to differences in body weight. C 57 BL/ 6 J mice were divided into 9 groups fed a background diet equivalent {{to that of the}} US diet (% energy) with supplemental doses of LA or AA. Changes in the phospholipid fatty acid compositions were monitored in plasma and erythrocytes and compared to data from <b>humans</b> supplemented with <b>equivalent</b> <b>doses</b> of LA or AA. Results Increasing dietary LA had little effect on tissue AA, while supplementing diets with AA significantly increased tissue AA levels, importantly recapitulating results from human trials. Conclusions Thus, interspecies comparisons for dietary LA between rodents and humans can be achieved when rodents are provided <b>human</b> <b>equivalent</b> <b>doses</b> based on differences in metabolic activity as defined by energy consumption. </p...|$|R

In male Wistar rats (~ 250 g, n[*]=[*] 40), serum insulin and leucine concentrations were quantified up to 120 min after one <b>human</b> <b>equivalent</b> <b>dose</b> of a WPI or the WPH-based supplement. In a second cohort of rats (~ 250 g, n[*]=[*] 20), we examined serum/blood and liver/kidney histopathological markers after 30 days of feeding low (1 <b>human</b> <b>equivalent</b> <b>dose),</b> medium (3 doses) and high (6 doses) amounts of the WPH-based supplement. In aim 1, higher leucine levels existed at 15 min after WPH vs. WPI ingestion (p[*]=[*] 0. 04) followed by higher insulin concentrations at 60 min (p[*]=[*] 0. 002). In aim 2, liver and kidney histopathology/toxicology markers were not different 30 days after feeding with low, medium, high dose WPH-based supplementation or water only. There were no between-condition differences in body fat or lean mass or circulating clinical chemistry markers following the 30 -day feeding intervention in aim 2. In comparison to WPI, acute ingestion of a novel WPH-based supplement resulted in a higher transient leucine response with a sequential increase in insulin.

30|$|Regulatory {{guidelines}} lack recommendations regarding safety margins for teratogenicity between NOAEL in EFD studies a {{and maximum}} doses tested in clinical trials. For first-in-human studies applying {{a range of}} escalating doses, the FDA suggests a default safety factor of ten between the exposure for the starting dose {{and that of the}} <b>Human</b> <b>Equivalent</b> <b>Dose,</b> which should be individualized [27]. In our experience, for non-monitorable and potentially irreversible and severe toxicities, a safety factor of ten is usually applied between exposure associated with the maximum dose in a clinical trial and the NOAEL in EFD studies. Given the uncertainties around predicting exposure in the female partner/fetus and the potential serious outcome {{in the development of the}} embryo-fetus, a safety margin higher than tenfold is proposed between NOAEL in EFD studies and exposures associated with the maximum dose in the clinical trial. Of note, the FDA draft guidance states that a margin of at least tenfold between NOAEL in EFD studies and the estimated exposure to embryo-fetus due to vaginal dose would not mandate evaluation of drug in seminal fluid.|$|E

40|$|The {{widespread}} {{usage of}} methylphenidate (MPH) in the pediatric population has received considerable attention {{due to its}} potential effect on child development. For {{the first time a}} physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model has been developed in juvenile and adult humans and nonhuman primates to quantitatively evaluate species- and age-dependent enantiomer specific pharmacokinetics of MPH and its primary metabolite ritalinic acid. The PBPK model was first calibrated in adult humans using in vitro enzyme kinetic data of MPH enantiomers, together with plasma and urine pharmacokinetic data with MPH in adult humans. Metabolism of MPH in the small intestine was assumed to account for the low oral bioavailability of MPH. Due to lack of information, model development for children and juvenile and adult nonhuman primates primarily relied on intra- and interspecies extrapolation using allometric scaling. The juvenile monkeys appear to metabolize MPH more rapidly than adult monkeys and humans, both adults and children. Model prediction performance is comparable between juvenile monkeys and children, with average root mean squared error values of 4. 1 and 2. 1, providing scientific basis for interspecies extrapolation of toxicity findings.

At typical conditions, the majority of estrogens were removed by degradation in the water compartment. A sensitivity analysis found that the simulated concentrations of E 1, E 2 and EE 2 were equally sensitive to the parameters of temperature (T), reservoir water volume (V) and equivalent biomass concentration (EBC), but E 1 was more sensitive to estrogen concentration in the recycled water (Ce) and recycling rate (Fr). In contrast, all three estrogens were not sensitive to reservoir water releasing rate (Fd). Furthermore, a probabilistic health risk assessment showed that the simulated concentrations were below fish exposure threshold value (ETV) and human public health standard (PHS). <b>Human</b> <b>equivalent</b> <b>dose</b> of EDCs from fish consumption was about 10 times higher than that from drinking water consumption.

The lifetime average daily doses (LADDs) {{for a wide range of}} adverse effects observed in human case studies were estimated and compared to the doses in the high-exposure (HE) situation. Using the Monte Carlo simulation technique the probabilities of risk quotients higher than unity ranged from 0. 02 to 0. 26. This evaluation indicated that 1, 4 -DCB posed low risks to general residents; however, for individuals with susceptible characteristics and exposure to elevated 1, 4 -DCB, the probability of adverse responses was moderate to high.

40|$|National audienceMore {{than half}} of all {{clinical}} cancer patients undergo radiation therapy. Besides the poor prognosis for multiple brain metastases and brain tumors, the delivery of curative radiation dose to eradicate tumor is strongly restricted by the healthy proximal brain. We describe a nanoparticle which can act as MR contrast agent and radiosensitizer concomitantly, for the detection, monitoring and treatment of brain cancers. Biodistribution, toxicity and pharmacokinetic studies were carried out in rodents and cynomolgus monkeys to demonstrate the safety of the nanoparticles after intravenous injection. The MR imaging properties of the nanoparticles were used to monitor their tumor accumulation in rodent bearing brain tumors. In vitro and in vivo efficacy of the nanoparticles was evaluated in rodent bearing brain tumors. The regulatory toxicity investigations demonstrated the absence of any ante- or post-mortem finding in rodent and nonhuman primates after repeated administration of nanoparticles; thus, the no-observed-effect level (NOEL) was determined and a <b>human</b> <b>equivalent</b> <b>dose</b> of 120 mg/kg was defined. In rodents, MR imaging indicated the renal elimination of the nanoparticles and their passive accumulation in the tumor region for several hours. The combination of nanoparticles and irradiation created significant dose enhancement in vitro, and improved the survival of rodent bearing aggressive brain tumor. The therapeutic efficacy of AGuIX has been demonstrated in aggressive pathologies, i. e. multiple brain metastases and brain tumors. In addition, the nanoparticles possess natural T 1 -MRI contrast agent properties, conferring a dual-property for image-guided radiation therapy. The data in rodents and nonhuman primates clearly demonstrates and justifies their clinical translational potential. The upcoming first-in-man clinical trial will investigated both imaging and radiation therapy improvement for advanced precision medicine...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: We {{previously}} {{demonstrated the}} benefits of daily, oral pentosan polysulfate (PPS) treatment in a rat model of mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) type VI. Herein we compare these effects to once weekly, subcutaneous (s. c.) injection. The bioavailability of injected PPS is greater than oral, suggesting better delivery to difficult tissues such as bone and cartilage. Injected PPS also effectively treats osteoarthritis in animals, and has shown success in osteoarthritis patients. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: One-month-old MPS VI rats were given once weekly s. c. injections of PPS (1, 2 and 4 mg/kg, <b>human</b> <b>equivalent</b> <b>dose</b> (HED)), or daily oral PPS (4 mg/kg HED) for 6 months. Serum inflammatory markers and total glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) were measured, as were several histological, morphological and functional endpoints. Overall, weekly s. c. PPS injections led to similar or greater therapeutic effects as daily oral administration. Common findings between the two treatment approaches included reduced serum inflammatory markers, improved dentition and skull lengths, reduced tracheal deformities, and improved mobility. Enhanced effects of s. c. treatment included GAG reduction in urine and tissues, greater endurance on a rotarod, and better improvements in articular cartilage and bone in some dose groups. Optimal therapeutic effects were observed at 2 mg/kg, s. c [...] No drug-related increases in liver enzymes, coagulation factor abnormalities or other adverse effects were identified following 6 months of s. c. PPS administration. CONCLUSIONS: Once weekly s. c. administration of PPS in MPS VI rats led to equal or better therapeutic effects than daily oral administration, including a surprising reduction in urine and tissue GAGs. No adverse effects from s. c. PPS administration were observed over the 6 -month study period...|$|E
40|$|Background and Objectives The {{studies were}} {{designed}} to test the efficacy of two peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) agonists in two rodent models of polycystic kidney disease (PKD). Materials and Methods The PCK rat is a slowly progressing cystic model while the Wpk-/- rat is a rapidly progressing model. PCK rats were fed with a pharmacological (0. 4 mg/kg body weight [BW]) and a sub-pharmacological (0. 04 mg/kg BW) dose of rosiglitazone (week 4 – 28). Wpk-/- rats were fed with pharmacological (2. 0 mg/kg BW) and sub-pharmacologic (0. 2 mg/kg BW) doses of pioglitazone from day 5 to 18. At termination, kidney weights of treated versus untreated cystic animals {{were used to determine}} efficacy. The current studies were also compared with previous studies containing higher doses of PPARγ agonists. The concentrations used in the animals were calculated with reference to <b>equivalent</b> <b>human</b> <b>doses</b> for both drugs. Results The current studies demonstrate: 1) that low, pharmacologically relevant, doses of the PPARγ agonists effectively inhibit cyst growth; 2) there is a class action of the drugs with both commercially available PPARγ agonists, rosiglitazone, and pioglitazone, inhibiting cyst growth; 3) the drugs showed efficacy in two different preclinical cystic models. In the PCK rat, animals fed with a sub-pharmacological dose of rosiglitazone for 24 weeks had significantly lower kidney weights than untreated animals (3. 68 ± 0. 13 g vs. 4. 17 ± 0. 11 g, respectively, P < 0. 01) while treatment with a pharmacologic dose had no significant effect on kidney weight. The rapidly progressing Wpk-/- rats were fed with pharmacological and sub-pharmacologic doses of pioglitazone from day 5 to 18 and the kidneys were compared with non-treated, cystic animals. Kidney weights on the pharmacologic dose were not statistically lower than the untreated animals while rats fed a sub-pharmacologic dose showed a significant decrease compared with untreated animals (3. 35 ± 0. 15 g vs. 4. 55 ± 0. 46 g, respectively, P = 0. 045). Conclusion Concentrations of PPARγ agonists below the <b>human</b> <b>equivalent</b> diabetic <b>doses</b> are effective in slowing cyst growth in two rodent models of PKD...|$|R
50|$|The FDA {{expressed}} concern about miscarriage at the 2006 advisory committee meeting; the committee voted unanimously that further study was needed to evaluate the potential association of OHPC with increased risk of second trimester miscarriage and stillbirth. A toxicology study in rhesus monkeys resulted {{in the death of}} all rhesus fetuses exposed to 1 and 10 times the <b>human</b> <b>dose</b> <b>equivalent</b> of OHPC. , OHPC was a category D progestin according to the FDA (that is, there is evidence of fetal harm). There is speculation that the castor oil in the OHPC formulation may not be beneficial for pregnancy. Of note, the above-mentioned NEJM study by Meirs et al. compares the effect of OHPC (with the castor oil component) to castor oil injection as the placebo.|$|R
40|$|Animal studies testing {{medicinal}} herbs are often misinterpreted by both translational researchers and clinicians {{due to a}} lack of information regarding their predictability, <b>human</b> <b>dose</b> <b>equivalent</b> and potential value. The most common mistake is to design or translate an animal study on a milligram per kilogram basis. This can lead to underestimation of the toxicity and/or overestimation of the amount needed for human therapy. Instead, allometric scaling, which involves body surface area, should be used. While the differences in the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic phases between species will inevitably lead to some degree of error in extrapolation of results regardless of the conversion method used, correct design and interpretation of animal studies can provide information that is not able to be provided by in vitro studies, computer modeling or even traditional use.
