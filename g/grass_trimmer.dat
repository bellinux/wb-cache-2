50|$|Several Wacom models, {{including}} the Intuos4 and Bamboo, were criticized for the drawing surface's roughness, which caused the small pressure-sensitive 'nib' to wear down, and become slanted or scratchy {{in the same}} way as pencil lead, albeit more slowly. This could also cause the surface to become smoother where it is used more, resulting in uneven slick and non-slick areas. As the nibs were only short lengths of plastic, it was possible for a user wanting a more durable nib to improvise a replacement from a short length of nylon 'wire' (approx 0.065 inches or 1.7mm diameter) like that found in <b>grass</b> <b>trimmer</b> or 'weed-eater' refills, suitably straightened by hand and smoothed (rounded off) at one end with abrasive paper. Additionally, a thin sheet of glass or acetate can be placed over the drawing surface to avert surface or nib damage {{in the same way}} as screen protectors are used on phones, although in the case of glass this may induce a—usually modest—parallax error when tracing.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Nowadays, {{research}} on dynamic behavior of structural components is {{becoming one of}} the important parts in the design process for any mechanical system. In order to determine the dynamic behavior of a vibrating structure, measurements of the dynamic properties of structure are essential. Free vibration analysis is one of the approaches that apply the finite element method in determining the structure modes of vibration. Each mode is defined by its natural frequency and mode shape. In this paper, the free vibration analysis of <b>grass</b> <b>trimmer</b> was performed using commercial finite element software, such as Ansys®. The importance of determining these vibration characteristics are crucial as <b>grass</b> <b>trimmer</b> is a common machine that exposed to the dynamic and static forces coming from the engine and rotating blade. A long term exposure of grass trimmer's operator may or potentially suffering a risk of hand arm vibration syndrome. The preliminary results of free vibration analysis demonstrated that the <b>grass</b> <b>trimmer</b> experienced a global first bending mode for 1 st natural frequency, a global second bending mode for 2 nd natural frequency, a local first torsion mode for third natural frequency, and a combination of global and local bending mode for 4 th natural frequency. Later, the analyses were further carried out on the modification of the <b>grass</b> <b>trimmer...</b>|$|E

40|$|Introduction: <b>Grass</b> <b>trimming</b> workers {{work every}} day in a noisy {{environment}} as they carry the <b>grass</b> <b>trimming</b> machine on their back, such daily exposure for many years may contribute to {{noise induced hearing loss}}. Objective: To assess the hearing status of the <b>grass</b> <b>trimming</b> workers in KB and the nearby areas and to determine the prevalence of noise induced hearing loss among them. Methodology: This was a descriptive cross sectional study. The source population were from <b>grass</b> <b>trimming</b> worker works under USM Health Campus, Majlis Perbandaran Kota Bharu (MPKB), Majlis Daerah Pasir Puteh, Bachok, Ketereh and Tumpat. The data was collected at HUSM /ORL-HNS outpatient clinic to fill the Proforma, otoscopic examination and hearing tests. Hearing tests consist of pure tone audiometry, tympanogram and distortion product otoacoustic emission. Results: A total of 77 <b>grass</b> <b>trimming</b> workers participate in this study. All of them were male with age range from 20 - 53 years old with majority of them fall in age group of 40 - 50 years old. Two of the subjects were excluded as they have history of working in noisy job before and for at least 10 years. None of them use any protecting hearing device. Duration of work of grass trimmers were in between 1 to 33 years. The daily work was 4 - 5 hours with time of rest in between we found that 62 out 75 grass (82. 7 %) trimming worker have noise induced hearing loss with characteristic notch at 6 kHz, 4 kHz and 3 kHz. The noise induced hearing loss occurred in workers exposed to noise as early as two years in this job. The intensity of the noise from the machine is in between 91. 3 to 100. 7 dB in a fluctuant manner. The left ear was the predominant side that was affected by hearing loss. All of the subjects was having mild hearing loss. Conclusion: The study showed that <b>grass</b> <b>trimming</b> job have occupational hazards of noise induced hearing loss. It occurs with one to two years working without any hearing protection device. The dip at 6 kHz is a significant early sign for noise exposure. We strongly recommend that all the workers use the hearing protection device while doing <b>grass</b> <b>trimming...</b>|$|R

40|$|Semi-natural grasslands are species-rich {{and one of}} {{the most}} {{threatened}} habitats in Europe, since land-use changes have led to reduced area of grassland. Appropriate management practices like grazing or mowing is needed to maintain the conservation values and species-richness of semi-natural grasslands. However, few studies have investigated which of grazing or mowing is most appropriate. Furthermore, almost no studies have investigated which mowing technique is best for the conservation value of grassland flora. The aim of this study was to determine which management practice of grazing and mowing, and which mowing technique, has the most positive effect on grassland flora. Data from two long-term trials were evaluated: one compared the effect of grazing and mowing in eleven sites in southern Sweden during at least twelve years; the other compared the effect of the knife mower and <b>grass</b> <b>trimmer</b> at different cutting heights in one site during twelve years. Meta-analysis was used, based on the odds for a plant record being an indicator species, using eight different indicator systems of classification of grassland plants. Over time, results show increasing odds of finding indicators of good management and no change in odds of finding indicators of lack of management in mowed compared to grazed plots. There were no differences in the odds of finding any indicator species for any of the mowing techniques. Hence, to maintain the conservation values of semi-natural grasslands, mowing is the better management practice compared to grazing. Mowing using a knife mower or <b>grass</b> <b>trimmer</b> has similar effects, and can both be recommended...|$|E

50|$|Ophiosphaerella korrae is {{a member}} of Ascomycota, a phylum of fungi. They produce ascospores as a sexual {{reproductive}} structure in flask-shaped pseudothecia that are formed on roots and crowns of infected turf (6). The pathogens survive unfavorable seasons as sclerotia, which are compacted mycelium that live in plant debris. In optimal conditions, cool and humid weather, the sclerotia germinate and start infecting roots of turf and pseudothecia produce ascospores throughout growing season of turf. The pathogens are spread by <b>grass</b> <b>trimming</b> equipment such as a lawn mower as they carry the plant debris that contains the scelerotia (13). In addition, the hyphae from an infected plant invade other nearby plants as they grow outside of roots and rhizomes (10). Black mycelium as known as “runner hyphae” grow on surface of infected roots and colonize nearby healthy roots around them. The hyphae then penetrate the roots and infect inside of the root cortex causing decreased ability of the plant to take up nutrients and water from soil and ultimately cause plant death. An asexual reproductive stage of the pathogen has not been discovered yet and is thought to have only a sexual reproductive stage. The only species that has been reported to have an anamorph within genus Ophiosphaerella is O. herpotricha (6).|$|R
