Results prior to {{the launch of the}} Hipparcos satellite generally found that the Pleiades were about 135 parsecs away from Earth. Data from Hipparcos yielded a surprising result, namely a distance of only 118 parsecs by measuring the parallax of stars in the cluster—a technique that should yield the most direct and accurate results. Later work consistently argued that the Hipparcos distance measurement for the Pleiades was erroneous. In particular, distances derived to the cluster via the Hubble Space Telescope and infrared color-magnitude diagram fitting favor a distance between 135 and 140 pc; a dynamical distance from optical interferometric observations of the Pleiad <b>double</b> <b>Atlas</b> favors a distance of 133–137 pc. However, the author of the 2007–2009 catalog of revised Hipparcos parallaxes reasserted that {{the distance}} to the Pleiades is ~120 pc and challenged the dissenting evidence. Recently, Francis and Anderson proposed that a systematic effect on Hipparcos parallax errors for stars in clusters biases calculation using the weighted mean and gave a Hipparcos parallax distance of 126 pc and photometric distance 132 pc based on stars in the AB Doradus, Tucana-Horologium, and Beta Pictoris moving groups, which are all similar in age and composition to the Pleiades. Those authors note that the difference between these results can be attributed to random error.|$|E

Although the Gaia team is cautious about their result, the VLBI authors assert [...] "that the Hipparcos measured distance to the Pleiades cluster is in error".|$|E

The derived semi-major axis, compared with its measured angular size, allows to determine a distance to Atlas of 132 +- 4 pc in a purely geometrical way. Under the assumption that the location of Atlas is representative of the average distance of the cluster, we confirm the distance value generally obtained through main sequence fitting, in contradiction with the early Hipparcos result (118. 3 +- 3. 5 pc) ...|$|R

A lot of measurements on underlying events with different processes at different energy scales {{are available from the}} two major experiments at LHC. Nowadays, primary focus of LHC experiments is on studying double parton scatterings. Effective cross section is considered as the most important link to the theories. As a first step to the measurement, CMS provides the data distributions of the observables which are sensitive to <b>double</b> parton scatterings. <b>ATLAS</b> provides first measurement of effective cross section...|$|R
40|$|Nearby 'open' {{clusters}} of stars (those {{that are not}} gravitationally bound) have {{played a crucial role}} in the development of stellar astronomy because, as a consequence of the stars having a common age, they provide excellent natural laboratories to test theoretical stellar models. Clusters also play a fundamental part in determining distance scales. The satellite Hipparcos surprisingly found that an extensively studied open cluster—the Pleiades (also known as the Seven Sisters) —had a distance of D = 118 plusminus 4 pc (refs 2, 3), about ten per cent smaller than the accepted value. The discrepancy generated a spirited debate because the implication was that either current stellar models were incorrect by a surprising amount or Hipparcos was giving incorrect distances. Here we report the orbital parameters of the bright <b>double</b> star <b>Atlas</b> in the Pleiades, using long-baseline optical/infrared interferometry. From the data we derive a firm lower bound of D > 127 pc, with the most likely range being 133 < D < 137 pc. Our result reaffirms the fidelity of current stellar models...|$|R
40|$|The {{production}} of a Z boson in association with a J/psi meson in proton-proton collisions probes the production mechanisms of quarkonium and heavy flavour in association with vector bosons, and allows studies of multiple parton scattering. Using 20. 3 fb(- 1) of data collected with theATLAS experiment at the LHC in pp collisions at root s = 8 TeV, the first measurement of associated Z + J/psi production is presented for both prompt and non-prompt J/psi production, with both signatures having a significance in excess of 5 sigma. The inclusive production cross-sections for Z boson production (analysed in mu(+) mu(-) or e(+) e(-) decay modes) in association with prompt and non-prompt J/psi (-> mu(+) mu(-)) are measured relative to the inclusive production rate of Z bosons in the same fiducial volume to be (36. 8 +/- 6. 7 +/- 2. 5) x 10 (- 7) and (65. 8 +/- 9. 2 +/- 4. 2) x 10 (- 7) respectively. Normalised differential production cross-section ratios are also determined {{as a function of}} the J/psi transverse momentum. The fraction of signal events arising from single and double parton scattering is estimated, and a lower limit of 5. 3 (3. 7) mb at 68 (95) % confidence level is placed on the effective cross-section regulating <b>double</b> parton interactions. <b>ATLAS</b> Collaboration, for complete list of authors see [URL]...|$|R
