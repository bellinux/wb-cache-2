500|$|Georgia Tech next {{defeated}} coach Knute Rockne's Notre Dame Fighting Irish 13–0. Father Lumpkin intercepted two Irish passes, {{setting up}} the winning score by running the second interception down to the [...] line. After the game, coach Rockne said, [...] "I sat at Grant Field and saw a magnificent Notre Dame team suddenly recoil before the furious pounding of one man–Peter Pund... Nobody could stop him. <b>I</b> <b>counted</b> 20 scoring plays that this man ruined". Rockne later also wrote of an attack on his coaching in the Atlanta Journal, [...] "I am surprised that a paper of such fine, high standing [...] would allow a zipper to write in his particular vein... the article by Fuzzy Woodruff was not called for".|$|E
500|$|......I {{went outside}} on hearing enemy planes. <b>I</b> <b>counted</b> them aloud. Ten. They dived {{straight}} on Southampton, without any preliminaries, through {{a barrage of}} gunfire, one after the other. Alfred saw a bomb released, then handed the glasses (Binoculars) to me. The aircraft had twin-rudders, and might have been Dorniers or Jaguars [...] The dives were fast but shallow, and they pulled out of them at about 2,000 feet. It was not a dive-bombing attack proper. Soldiers passing made inane remarks about 'nothing could live in that barrage', although the Germans were living in it, too. The barrage was quite good, {{but none of the}} Huns were brought down....Very quickly and efficiently the Germans re-formed and disappeared into the cloud. I have never seen a better bit of flying than those Nazi pilots [...] put up – they got into formation like a well-drilled team, in the teeth of guns.|$|E
500|$|Alexander's 1928 team {{amassed a}} perfect record {{and won the}} school's second {{national}} title. The team was led at center by captain Peter Pund and upset Notre Dame. [...] "I sat at Grant Field and saw a magnificent Notre Dame team suddenly recoil before the furious pounding of one man–Pund, center", said legendary coach Knute Rockne. [...] "Nobody could stop him. <b>I</b> <b>counted</b> 20 scoring plays that this man ruined." [...] The 1928 team was also the very first Tech team to attend a bowl game. The team was invited to the Rose Bowl to play California. The game was a defensive struggle, with the first points scored after a Georgia Tech fumble. The loose ball was scooped up by California center Roy Riegels and then accidentally returned in the wrong direction. Riegels returned the ball {{all the way to}} California's 3-yard line. After Riegels was finally stopped by his own teammate at the 1-yard line, he was swarmed by a group of Tech players. The Bears opted to punt from the end zone. The punt was blocked and converted by Tech into a safety giving Tech a 2–0 lead. Cal scored a touchdown and a point after but Tech would score another touchdown to win the game 8–7. This victory made Tech the 10–0 undefeated national champion of 1928.|$|E

2500|$|Much of Reicha's music {{remained}} unpublished and/or unperformed {{during the}} his life, {{and virtually all}} of it fell into obscurity after his death.

[...] He also frequently advocated ideas, {{such as the use}} of quarter tones, that were too far ahead of his time to be understood by his contemporaries.|$|E

I dropped my pants, pulled down my undershorts and bent over. Then he went at it with the belt dotted with metal studs he kept reserved for the occasion.

We {{looked again}} at the heap of skulls and skeletons before us, and we {{observed}} that they were all small and that the articles of clothing intermingled with them and lying about were all women's apparel.

From my saddle <b>I</b> <b>counted</b> about a hundred skulls, not including those that were hidden beneath the others in the ghastly heap nor those that were scattered far and wide through the fields. The skulls were nearly all separated {{from the rest of the}} bones – the skeletons were nearly all headless. These women had all been beheaded...and the procedure seems to have been, as follows: They would seize a woman, strip her carefully to her chemise, laying aside articles of clothing that were valuable, with any ornaments and jewels she might have about her. Then as many of them as cared would violate her, and the last man would kill her or not as the humour took him....We looked into the church which had been blackened by the burning of the woodwork, but not destroyed, nor even much injured. It was a low building with a low roof, supported by heavy irregular arches, that as we looked in seemed scarcely high enough for a tall man to stand under. What we saw there was too frightful for more than a hasty glance. An immense number of bodies had been partially burnt there and the charred and blackened remains seemed to fill it half way up to the low dark arches and make them lower and darker still, were lying in a state of putrefaction too frightful to look upon. I had never imagined anything so horrible. We all turned away sick and faint, and staggered out of the fearful pest house glad to get into the street again. We walked about the place and saw the same thing repeated over and over a hundred times. Skeletons of men with the clothing and flesh still hanging to and rotting together; skulls of women, with the hair dragging in the dust. bones of children and infants everywhere. Here they show us a house where twenty people were burned alive; there another where a dozen girls had taken refuge, and been slaughtered to the last one, as their bones amply testified. Everywhere horrors upon horrors..." ...|$|E
