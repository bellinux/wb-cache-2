Every other {{designer}} looks and says, ‘How do they live the way they do?’ I don’t think they made the money that Valentino and Giancarlo did, because Giancarlo {{knows how to make}} money. If they did, they didn’t spend the money like Valentino. No other designer ever did. When the terrorism first started in Rome – the period when the Red Brigades were kidnapping people – Valentino was riding around in a bulletproof Mercedes. And <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> color the Mercedes was? Red. My God, I thought, you must want to get blown up.|$|E

[...] After receiving many abusive messages from Brown's fans after posting the comment, he later tweeted, [...] "I don't care that {{you call me}} a nobody.

2500|$|In {{the winter}} of 2008 it was {{announced}} that Jay-Z become the first major hip hop artist to headline Britain's 2008 Glastonbury Festival. Tickets sold out quickly. Former headliner Noel Gallagher of Oasis condemned the festival organizers for choosing Jay-Z to headline a traditionally guitar-driven festival. [...] "I'm sorry, but Jay-Z?" [...] Gallagher asked, swearing. [...] "No chance. Glastonbury has a tradition of, kind of, guitar music, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> I mean? And even when they throw the odd curve balls in on a Sunday night—you go, 'Kylie Minogue? I don't know about that', <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> I mean?—but I'm not having hip hop at Glastonbury, no way, no, no. It's wrong." [...] As controversy mounted, Jay-Z replied, [...] "We don't play guitars, Noel, but hip hop has put in its work like any other form of music. This headline show is just a natural progression. Rap music is still evolving. We have to respect each other's genre of music and move forward." [...] Jay-Z opened his Glastonbury set with a tongue-in-cheek cover of Oasis's iconic song [...] "Wonderwall", and went on to deliver a performance heralded as a successful response to pre-festival criticism.|$|E

2500|$|Estonian Prime Minister Mart Laar came to {{my office}} the other day to recount his country's {{remarkable}} transformation. He described a nation {{of people who are}} harder-working, more virtuous – yes, more virtuous, because the market punishes immorality – and more hopeful about the future than they've ever been in their history. I asked Mr. Laar where his government got the idea for these reforms. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> he replied? He said, [...] "We read Milton Friedman and F. A. Hayek." ...|$|E
2500|$|After a gap {{of about}} a month, Max starts writing to Martin at home, {{carrying}} only what looks like business and remarks about the weather, but writing as though they have a hidden encoded meaning, with strange references to exact dimensions of pictures and so on. The letters refer to [...] "our grandmother" [...] and imply that Martin is also Jewish. The letters from Munich to San Francisco get shorter and more panicky, begging Max to stop: [...] "My God, Max, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> you do? ... These letters you have sent ... are not delivered, but they bring me in and ... demand I give them the code ... I beg you, Max, no more, no more! Stop while I can be saved." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{his papers}} of 1935, Istrati {{presents}} himself exclusively {{as an enemy}} of [...] "the Jewish bourgeoisie", a class he describes as [...] "corrupt, pseudo-humanitarian, pseudo-democratic" [...] and accuses of stirring up scandal. Istrati's articles in Cruciada Românismului are more adamantly philosemitic. One of them, [...] "A Letter to Love", led {{to a series of}} articles on the subject, from Stelescu and other Crusade people. In his own articles, Talex answered for the Stelist movement: [...] "Panait Istrati, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> it is we need? A fist... The Crusade of Romanianism will attempt to become that fist... Our antisemitism? Just the same as yours: a humane one. But it is also combative, {{for as long as the}} Judaic element shall attempt to set up a state within our own state, sabotaging us with any opportunity it gets". Stelescu's newspaper was noted for its obstinate claim that Jews were a rootless, disloyal race.|$|E
2500|$|In late 2010, TVNZ {{garnered}} criticism over various {{comments made}} by Breakfast host Paul Henry. Henry had referred to Delhi Commonwealth Games organiser Sheila Dikshit as [...] "the dip shit woman" [...] and [...] "Dick Shit", going on to state that [...] "it's so appropriate, because she's Indian, so she'd be dick-in-shit wouldn't she, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> I mean? Walking along the street... she's just so funny, isn't she?" [...] Henry also questioned whether the Governor-General of New Zealand Anand Satyanand was [...] "even a New Zealander", going on to ask, [...] "Are you going to choose a New Zealander who looks and sounds like a New Zealander this time ... {{are we going to}} go for someone who is more like a New Zealander this time?" [...] Following widespread public complaints and official criticism, Henry was suspended from TVNZ for 2 weeks without pay, eventually resigning from the broadcaster. Henry's resignation polarised the New Zealand public, with supporters claiming he was a victim of political correctness, and critics accusing him of pandering to the lowest common denominator.|$|E
2500|$|Copies of the SNCC speech were {{distributed}} on August 27, {{and met with}} immediate disapproval {{from many of the}} organizers. Archbishop Patrick O'Boyle objected most strenuously to a part of the speech that called for immediate action and disavowed [...] "patience". The government (and more moderate civil rights leaders) could not countenance SNCC's explicit opposition of Kennedy's civil rights bill. That night, O'Boyle {{and other members of the}} Catholic delegation began preparing a statement announcing their withdrawal from the March. Reuther convinced them to wait and called Rustin; Rustin informed Lewis at 2 A.M. on August 28 that his speech was unacceptable to key members of the March. (Rustin also reportedly contacted Tom Kahn, mistakenly believing that Kahn had edited the speech and inserted the line about Sherman's March to the Sea. [...] Rustin asked, [...] "How could you do this? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> Sherman did?) But Lewis did not want to change the speech. Other members of SNCC, including Stokely Carmichael, were also adamant that the speech not be censored.|$|E

2500|$|Michael Musto of The Village Voice {{commented on}} the media's {{reaction}} to the incident, saying, [...] "Janet became a symbolic Joan of Arc to burn at the stake. I actually do think her breast {{was used as a}} diversionary tactic – I'm not sure to distract from Iraq specifically – but it did distract from important issues, from things we actually should be appalled by. The story got an undue amount of attention when the fact is, nobody has proved how her breast harmed anyone." [...] Speaking to Robert Tannenbaum of Blender Magazine, Jackson had strong, if guarded, views on the reactions, saying the furor [...] "is hypocritical, with everything you see on TV. There are more important thing to focus on than a woman's body part, which is a beautiful thing. There's war, famine, homelessness, AIDS". The fact that it happened in an election year [...] "did have {{a great deal to do}} with it. They needed something to focus on instead of the war, and I was the perfect vehicle for that. People are going to think what they want. It was an accident. It was not a stunt. That was embarrassing for me to have all those people see my breast. That's like having your penis hanging out in front of millions and millions of people." [...] Janet declared the reaction to the accidental exposure as [...] "contradictory", noting it to occur in an era where commercials for beer and Viagra are both [...] "very sexual" [...] and [...] "practically omnipresent". Jackson also said the mishap was [...] "not intentional" [...] and a [...] "costume accident", also commenting on some media outlets editing her taped apology, saying, [...] "Sometimes they cut out that I said it was an accident...That's what the media does, that's the way they are because they want it to be told a different way." [...] In Glamour Magazine, Janet exclaimed, [...] "It's hard to believe that there's a war and famine going on in the world and yet people made such a big deal about a breast. People said that it was done intentionally to sell records. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what?</b> I have never pulled a stunt. Why would you do that and have your album come out two months later? It doesn't make sense." [...] In the ensuing months, Janet felt overwhelmed by the hostility towards her. [...] "People think I'm immune to being hurt by what's said. They ask me questions that shock me. Not everybody is as strong as the next person and words can kill. People push you and you start to think, 'Can I handle this?' But I know I can." ...|$|E
