5|$|In the {{following}} season, Cousy made further progress. Averaging 7.7 assists per game, {{he won the}} first of his eight consecutive assists titles. These numbers were made {{despite the fact that the}} NBA had not yet introduced the shot clock, making the game static and putting prolific assist <b>givers</b> at a disadvantage. Powered by Auerbach's quick fastbreak-dominated tactics, the Celtics won 46 games and beat the Syracuse Nationals 2–0 in the 1953 NBA Playoffs. Game 2 ended 111–105 in a 4-overtime thriller, in which Cousy had a much-lauded game. Despite having an injured leg, he scored 25 points after four quarters, scored 6 of his team's 9 points in the first overtime, hit a clutch free throw in the last seconds, and scored all 4 of Boston's points in the second overtime. He scored 8 more points in the third overtime, among them a 25-ft. buzzer beater. In the fourth overtime, he scored 9 of Boston's 12 points. Cousy played 66 minutes, and scored 50 points after making a still-standing record of 30 free throws in 32 attempts. This game is regarded by the NBA as one of the finest scoring feats ever, in line with Wilt Chamberlain's 100-point game. However, for the third time in a row, the Knicks beat Boston in the next round.|$|E

25|$|In 1978, due to {{increasing}} {{morbidity and mortality}} rates in the Instituto Materno Infantil NICU in Bogotá, Colombia, Dr. Edgar Rey Sanabria, Professor of Neonatology at Department of Paediatry - Universidad Nacional de Colombia, introduced a method to alleviate the shortage of caregivers and lack of resources. He suggested that mothers have continuous skin-to-skin contact with their low birth weight babies to keep them warm and to give exclusive breastfeeding as needed. This freed up overcrowded incubator space and care <b>givers.</b>|$|E

The Daily Mail newspaper provided cash prizes throughout though the initiating donation came from the Duke of Sutherland. The Air Ministry were prize <b>givers</b> in the 1924 event. The trials were held at Lympne in Kent, England.|$|E
25|$|Elderspeak can in fact {{contribute}} to decreased comprehension, and can increase confusion. Early social scientists first identified elderspeak and estimated that 20% {{of the communication}} occurring in nursing homes is actually elderspeak (Caporael, 1981). Caretakers of nursing home residents must be particularly careful when using elderspeak. Although elderspeak {{has been shown to}} help older adults with dementia and Alzheimer’s in language comprehension, they are not immune to feeling disrespected when it is used. Resisting care is an ongoing problem with dementia patients, as well as violent behaviour, and residents of nursing homes are more likely to resist care when their nurse uses elderspeak. Care <b>givers</b> may assume that the elder prefers the nurturing of elderspeak but older adults think of it as demeaning. Older adults in both institutional settings and those receiving home care services report that as many as 40% of their caregivers use speech they perceive as demeaning, and 75% of the interactions that elderly people have are with the staff of the nursing homes.|$|E

25|$|Generally speaking, {{the levels}} of service {{available}} will {{fall into one of}} three categories; Basic Life Support (BLS), Advanced Life Support (ALS), and Critical Care Transport (CCT) by traditional healthcare professionals, meaning nurses and/or physicians working in the pre-hospital setting and even on ambulances. In some jurisdictions, a fourth level, Intermediate Life Support (ILS), which is essentially a BLS provider with a moderately expanded skill set, may be present, but this level rarely functions independently, and where it is present may replace BLS in the emergency part of the service. When this occurs, any remaining staff at the BLS level is usually relegated to the non-emergency transportation function. Job titles typically include Emergency Medical Technician, Ambulance Technician, or Paramedic. These ambulance care <b>givers</b> are generally professionals or paraprofessionals and in some countries their use is controlled through training and registration. While these job titles are protected by legislation in some countries, this protection is by no means universal, and anyone might, for example, call themselves an 'EMT' or a 'paramedic', regardless of their training, or the lack of it. In some jurisdictions, both technicians and paramedics may be further defined by the environment in which they operate, including such designations as 'Wilderness', 'Tactical', and so on.|$|E
500|$|The quarter eagle {{remained}} {{popular as}} a Christmas gift {{but did not}} initially come back into production as the Treasury held stocks of the pieces from the prewar years. [...] This surplus was slow to dissipate, as gift <b>givers</b> preferred the older Liberty Headquarter eagle that had been struck until 1908. [...] With the Liberty Head pieces becoming rarer and acquiring a premium above face value, the quarter eagle was finally struck again in 1925, principally to be given as presents. [...] The 1925 quarter eagle was struck only at Denver, {{and it was then}} struck from 1926 to 1929 only at Philadelphia. [...] With the economic collapse which started the Depression, the quarter eagle was not called for in commerce, and the Mint halted production.|$|E
500|$|The {{two songs}} {{performed}} by Artie and Quinn were not reviewed as enthusiastically.

Chaney gave the song a [...] "C" [...] and said that [...] "something about this segment wasn’t as dynamic as it should have been". Votta and Strecker both described the performance as [...] "pleasant", the latter also added a [...] "B−" [...] grade. Strecker gave a [...] "B" [...] to the other song, [...] "Up Up Up", which she said was [...] "mostly background music" [...] and the song itself [...] "not particularly memorable". Chaney's [...] "B" [...] was far more complimentary: she characterized the performance as [...] "the most energetic set piece of the night" [...] which [...] "made nice use of the infectious <b>Givers</b> song". Futterman thought that [...] "the sugary vocals work well for Artie and Quinn", but Votta wrote that [...] "the vocal is so indistinct it could be anyone".|$|E

30|$|The FE {{evaluates the}} {{kindness}} of a player towards another player (for clarity we will refer to both players as “giver” and “receiver”) {{as a function of}} the payoffs the receiver gets. Because the payoffs of the receiver depend not only on the actions of the <b>giver,</b> but also on her own actions, the FE assumes that a player (“spectator”), who can be the <b>giver</b> or the receiver, evaluates the kindness based on the payoffs the spectator believes the <b>giver</b> wants to give to the receiver. For this, Rabin assumes that the spectator has beliefs not only about the actions of the receiver, but also about the beliefs the <b>giver</b> has about the actions of the receiver). The SRE extends the concept of reciprocity for more players, by assuming that the spectator has beliefs about the actions of all other players and about the beliefs of the <b>giver.</b>|$|R

2500|$|<b>Givers</b> came {{together}} in 2008, when Lamson and Guarisco recruited Kirby Campbell, Will Henderson and Josh LeBlanc for a two-hour slot at a Lafeyette pub. Lamson and Guarisco had never sung prior to joining the band, and Josh LeBlanc was a jazz trumpeter before learning the bass. The unnamed band hopped on the last-minute slot after another local band dropped off the bill, and improvised the entire set. They were phoned by the pub and invited back, and they continued to perform improvised sets. [...] "I mean, we weren't a band, we were just making shit up," [...] Guarisco later said. [...] "That was how songs were created, that total free-form state where we just played and recorded and then excerpted and rearranged." [...] The band scoured their iTunes libraries looking for interesting song titles they could narrow down for a band name; Guarisco picked a Lucky Dragons song called [...] "Givers." [...] The band recorded their debut EP in Campbell's bedroom, and released it online for free in 2009. After the newly christened <b>Givers</b> performed at Baton Rouge's stalwart music hall Spanish Moon, booking agent Aaron Scruggs gave the band what would become one the [...] "major accidents that became very fruitful occurrences," [...] according to Guarisco. For their Baton Rouge show, Dirty Projectors had a rare opening slot, and Scruggs gave it to <b>Givers,</b> who had been performing only part-time since their 2008 formation. Dirty Projectors were Guarisco's favorite band and a key inspiration in creating <b>Givers.</b> To prepare for the performance, the band rehearsed {{eight hours a day}} for a week. Frontman Dave Longstreth subsequently invited the band along as support for an East Coast tour.|$|E
