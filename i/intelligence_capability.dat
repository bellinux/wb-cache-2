2500|$|During the Progressive Era of {{the late}} 19th and early 20th centuries, there was an {{explosion}} of public interest in American Indian culture and imagery. Newspapers, dime-store novels, Wild West shows, and public exhibitions portrayed Native Americans as a [...] "vanishing race." [...] Their numbers had decreased since the long Indian wars and survivors were struggling with poverty and constraints on government reservations. At this time, many whites still viewed Indians as savages and incapable of any civilizing influence. Debate raged regarding undesirable racial characteristics of non-white peoples, including <b>intelligence,</b> <b>capability</b> and other traits perceived as inferior to whites. Advanced in part to justify slavery in the United States, proponents often used biological data to support claims of inferiority. These arguments invariably extended to Indians with academics and government officials claiming that limited intellectual capacity and often savage traits should preclude citizenship and legal rights.|$|E

[...] CIA Director Leon Panetta, who supervised the operation that found and killed bin Laden, stated in an interview with NBC reporter Brian Williams: [...] "…they used these enhanced interrogation techniques against some of these detainees. But I'm also saying, that the debate about whether we would have gotten the same information through other approaches, I think, {{is always going to be}} an open question." ...|$|E

We verified a significant weak correlation between the ‘self-motivation’ subscale of the VBEICS© and the ‘personal issues’ subscale of the MCSS© (- 0, 386).

40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{research}} project is to identify the source of children's ideas about the <b>intelligence</b> <b>capabilities</b> of robots. If children's beliefs are influenced by naïve biology theories, there {{is likely to be}} a strong relationship between animacy judgments (whether an entity is alive or not) and judgments of intelligence. However, if children's beliefs are influenced by prior experience with robots, there is no reason to assume intelligence and animacy would be related; rather, degree of prior exposure to robots would influence children's beliefs about robots' <b>intelligence</b> <b>capabilities.</b> Results suggest a relationship between animacy judgments and intelligence for children with little prior exposure to robots. For children with greater exposure, there is less of a relationship between intelligence and animacy judgments. Additionally, children with greater exposure attributed more intelligence to the robots than children with little exposure. It would seem that children with little robot experience are guided by their naïve theories of biology, while children with significant robot experience use ideas gathered from their prior experiences to make judgments about the <b>intelligence</b> <b>capabilities</b> of robots...|$|R
