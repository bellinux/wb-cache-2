50|$|Any {{reportable}} offence {{that occurs}} during a Grand Final match will receive an addition called the double penalty: {{equal to the}} offence's original base score {{as determined by the}} Match Review Panel. This addition is applied after the additions and deductions previously mentioned. This loading is meant to discourage excessively rough play encouraged because any penalties given as a result would not apply until the following season. A rough fight in the 2004 AFL Grand Final between Alastair Lynch and Darryl Wakelin resulted in the Tribunal handing down stiff penalties and adding the <b>double</b> <b>penalty</b> rule.|$|E

50|$|When {{each player}} has their items and cards, the players turn their cards face up.

Each truck is 5×3 units in surface area and 1 to 4 units high, {{although}} part of the surface area might be filled up in advance. The players then {{do their best to}} stack their items in the remaining volume in the truck. Any space left vacant counts as penalty points, and any items left over count as <b>double</b> <b>penalty</b> points. The player with the fewest penalty points is awarded 10 points.|$|E
50|$|Foremost was {{the fight}} between Alastair Lynch and Darryl Wakelin in the 1st Quarter. The Tribunal noted the {{increased}} physicality {{that occurred during}} Grand Final matches because any penalties for reported offences would only apply to the following season, so they set an example. Lynch, the aggressor in the melee, was suspended 10 matches for his combined offences against Wakelin and fined a total of AU$15,000, although this meant little as Lynch retired after the Grand Final. Wakelin was fined AU$5,000 for wrestling and attempting to strike Lynch. To help reduce this aggression, the AFL established a new rule called the <b>double</b> <b>penalty</b> that would effectively double the severity (and the potential suspension) of any offence that occurred during a Grand Final.|$|E

5000|$|The {{season began}} poorly, though Harris {{returned}} to the first eleven and Alcock thus departed. Keeper John Connaughton picked up a knee injury, whilst a reporter from The Sentinel was allegedly told [...] "I'll kill you" [...] by a club official after he criticized the team in the paper. The reporter noted that [...] "there is disenchantment in the air". The situated was calmed on 27 September, when Vale beat high-flying Colchester United 3-2 at Layer Road, reserve keeper Trevor Dance making a <b>double</b> <b>penalty</b> save. This was only a reprieve for Sproson however, as Vale would go the next fourteen league games without a victory, and the Vale Park faithful turned against the team. This run was not too damaging however, as eleven of the games were draws. Included in this was a club record streak of six home draws, lasting from 10 October to 27 December. Sproson complained of Mick Cullerton's attitude, and had to endure speculation of former Stoke City manager Tony Waddington taking his job. Sproson was sacked in October, and he rejected the offer of an executive position at the club. Colin Harper was made caretaker-manager. The board {{tried and failed to}} attract Bill McGarry to the vacant managerial position, and so advertised the position with a significant salary increase to attract applicants. On 17 November, Bobby Smith was sacked as Bury manager, and the next day walked into the Vale job. He appointed Dennis Butler as his assistant, as Harper left the club. Sproson also returned to Vale with an offer 'to help in any capacity'. Victory finally came on New Year's Eve with a 3-0 win over Rotherham United. Soon after this the 'Vale Lottery' was introduced, which proved to be a real money-spinner, and a five-a-side pitch was built for training.|$|E

40|$|In this study, an {{improved}} error metric for morphodynamic models is introduced. Cur-rent error metrics, like the classical (Root) Mean Squared Error (RMSE), assume that predictions can be properly validated against observations by regarding the point-wise difference in bed level. This analysis inherently has {{the problem that}} phase differences of bottom features are not recognized, such that a misplaced feature is penalised twice, the so called <b>double</b> <b>penalty</b> effect. To reduce the <b>double</b> <b>penalty</b> effect, Bosboom and Reniers (2014) formulated errors metrics based on an optimal smooth displacement field between predictions and obser-vations. Since the employed image warping technique moves pixels rather than sand, sediment continuity is not guaranteed. To overcome this limitation, this study presents an error metric based on the effective (net) sediment transport difference between predic-tion and observation including a recipe to compute it: the Root Mean Squared Transport Error (RMSTE). This transport difference is minimised by its 2 -norm (not 1 -norm) for computational efficiency. Intuitively, the RMSTE {{can be interpreted as}} a measure for the amount of work to be performed to correct the sediment displacements betwee...|$|E
40|$|The {{verification}} of simulations against {{data and the}} comparison of model simulation of pollutant fields rely on the critical choice of statistical indicators. Most of the scores are based on point-wise, that is, local, value comparison. Such indicators are impacted by the so-called <b>double</b> <b>penalty</b> effect. Typically, a misplaced blob of pollutants will doubly penalise such a score because it is predicted where {{it should not be}} and is not predicted where it should be. The effect is acute in plume simulations where the concentrations gradient can be sharp. A non-local metric that would match concentration fields by displacement would avoid such <b>double</b> <b>penalty.</b> Here, we experiment on such a metric known as the Wasserstein distance, which tells how penalising moving the pollutants is. We give a mathematical introduction to this distance and discuss how it should be adapted to handle fields of pollutants. We develop and optimise an open Python code to compute this distance. The metric is applied to the dispersion of cesium- 137 of the Fukushima-Daiichi nuclear power plant accident. We discuss of its application in model-to-model comparison but also in the {{verification of}} model simulation against a map of observed deposited cesium- 137 over Japan. As hoped for, the Wasserstein distance is less penalising, and yet retains some of the key discriminating properties of the root mean square error indicator...|$|E

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{minimizing}} by genetic algorithms {{the weight of}} a composite laminate subjected to various failure constraints is considered. Constraints are accounted for through penalty functions. The amount of penalty for each constraint violation is typically controlled by a penalty parameter that has a crucial influence on the performance of the genetic algorithm. An optimal value of each penalty parameter exists. It is larger than the smallest value of the penalty for which the global optimum is feasible. A generational elitist genetic algorithm is found to be less efficient for laminate optimization than a genetic algorithm with a more conservative selection procedure (a "superelitist" algorithm). A segregated genetic algorithm is proposed that uses a <b>double</b> <b>penalty</b> strategy and is superelitist. The segregated genetic algorithm performs as well as the superelitist genetic algorithm for optimal amounts of penalty. In addition, the segregated genetic algorithm is less sensitive to th [...] ...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: and Overview. Many state dental {{practice}} acts {{allow for}} the suspension or revocation of a dentist's license {{on the basis of}} a previous conviction for illegal behavior, even if the behavior is not related to the practice of dentistry. Penalizing a dentist twice for the same behavior appears to violate the legal principle "ne bis in idem"-that is, no <b>double</b> <b>penalty</b> for the same socially undesirable behavior. However, disciplinary measures are not intended primarily to penalize the offender but rather to protect the public and the reputation of the profession. In this article, the authors review various cases in which boards disciplined convicted dentists and propose criteria for discerning between situations in which such "double trouble" is fair and unfair. CONCLUSIONS: and Practice Implications. The authors conclude that such disciplinary actions are fair only if four criteria concerning the following are fulfilled: the relationship between the dentist's illegal behavior and dental treatment or privileges of the dentist; the severity of the crime; the frequency of the illegal behavior; and the balance between crime and punishment...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—IEEE 802. 11 {{wireless}} network supports multiple link rates at the physical layer. Each link rate {{is associated with}} a certain required Signal-to-Interference-and-Noise Ratio (SINR) threshold for successfully decoding received packets. On transmission failures, the 802. 11 DCF performs a binary exponential backoff mechanism to discourage channel access attempts, hoping to reduce congestion. When traditional link adaptation is applied, both rate reduction and binary backoff represent <b>double</b> <b>penalties</b> for this wireless link, which may cause overly conservative transmission attempts. On the other hand, once transmission succeeds, 802. 11 DCF resets the backoff contention window to the minimum value to encourage channel access attempts. At the same time, traditional link adaptation may also decide to increase the data rate, which leads to overly aggressive transmission attempts. We observe this imprope...|$|R
40|$|Combining {{national}} forest inventory (NFI) data with digital site maps of high resolution enables spatially explicit predictions of site productivity. The {{aim of this}} study is to explore the possibilities and limitations of this database to analyze the environmental dependency of height-growth of Norway spruce and to predict site index (SI) on a scale that is relevant for local forest management. The study region is the German federal state of Bavaria. The exploratory methods comprise significance tests and hypervolume-analysis. SI is modeled with a Generalized Additive Model (GAM). In a second step the residuals are modeled using Boosted Regression Trees (BRT). The interaction between temperature regime and water supply strongly determined height growth. At sites with very similar temperature regime and water supply, greater heights were reached if the depth gradient of base saturation was favorable. Statistical model criteria (<b>Double</b> <b>Penalty</b> Selection, AIC) preferred composite variables for water supply and the supply of basic cations. The ability to predict SI on a local scale was limited due to the difficulty to integrate soil variables into the model...|$|E
40|$|The {{numerical}} forecast using ALADIN model in Meteorological and Hydrological Service of Croatia is run operationally since July 2000. Over the years, various methods of validation and verification of the operational forecast have been applied. The classical methods using {{root mean square}} error and mean absolute error would often renalize the high resolution ALADIN when compared to a low resolution global model forecast due to <b>double</b> <b>penalty</b> paradigm. Therefore, the model was mostly evaluated by plotting the forecast and the measurements to allow subjective comparison, especially in weather situations that have high impact on the living and traffic conditions in Croatia. Here we show an overview of validation and verification products created operationally. These products intended for subjective validation in real time can help the forecaster in the decision if to rely on a particular forecast run more or less than to another. Statistical verification scores provide information on model bias and {{root mean square error}} but suffer from missing data due to automatic procedures used quality check and filtering of the measured data...|$|E
