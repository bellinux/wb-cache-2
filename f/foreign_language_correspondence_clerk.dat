40|$|This ESRC funded {{study was}} {{set out to}} explore teachers’ perspectives, asking them, as {{research}} participants, to report their beliefs {{about the value of}} grammar teaching in <b>foreign</b> <b>languages</b> in England. The above aims were pursued by means of three research questions: 1. What are teachers’ beliefs about the role of grammar in <b>foreign</b> <b>languages</b> teaching? 2. How is grammar taught and used in the classroom by teachers? 3. What factors influenced the development of teachers’ pedagogical systems? My small-scale, interpretive study aimed to strongly contextualise <b>foreign</b> <b>language</b> teaching in England, aware of the difficulties to generalise from descriptive research, but also aware of the credibility that a well-documented description of the situated nature of local processes has in developing understanding of language teaching. My study planned to reinforce the contextual relevance of participants’ views and pedagogical interpretations of national policy guidelines and theoretical frameworks. From its interpretive epistemological stance, my study’s findings concerning discrete participant’s beliefs and practices in discrete contexts were therefore generalised and validated by the very situated nature of the collected data. The purpose of this dissertation was to investigate teachers’ beliefs about a fundamental aspect of <b>foreign</b> <b>language</b> teaching: grammar. Whilst progressively reinstated in the national curriculum and consistently sustained by <b>foreign</b> <b>languages</b> teachers’ practices, grammar’s perceived irrelevance for assessment criteria of the nationally adopted method of assessment - the General Certificate of Secondary Education – kept it caught in conflicting discourses of policy, linguistic research and teaching practices. Whilst <b>foreign</b> <b>languages</b> policy and practice kept converging towards increasing focus on forms in <b>language</b> education along <b>correspondences</b> with linguistic research, the assessment has remained focused on generic communicative, skill-focused criteria. My small-scale research aimed to find how <b>foreign</b> <b>languages</b> teachers translated grammar teaching policy and possible theoretical guidelines in their teaching practices, by collecting data through interviews, observations and think-alouds. The findings revealed disparate educational contexts, approaches, as well as interpretations of grammar teaching. It led me to realise the necessity to probe further into a much more thorough theoretical and methodological underpinning of <b>foreign</b> <b>languages</b> education. As this study concludes, the secondary <b>foreign</b> <b>languages</b> curriculum has become disapplied, and schools and teachers have been left to devise their idiosyncratic <b>foreign</b> <b>language</b> learning strategies and rationales. As <b>foreign</b> <b>languages</b> teaching becomes anchored in the primary education curricular provision, this research hopes to document the need to frame theoretical and methodological guidelines, a consistent <b>foreign</b> <b>languages</b> education rationale, leading to a consistent and convincing education and provision of future <b>foreign</b> <b>language</b> teachers.
