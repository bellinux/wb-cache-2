In this paper, we present flow visualization data on patterns of water movement over the caudal peduncle and <b>finlets</b> (small fins on the dorsal and ventral body margin anterior to the caudal fin). Chub mackerel, Scomber japonicus, ranging in fork length from 20 to 26 cm, swam steadily at 1. 2 fork lengths s − 1 in a recirculating flow tank. Small, reflective particles in the flow tank were illuminated by a vertical (xy) or horizontal (xz) laser light sheet. Patterns of flow in the region near the caudal peduncle were measured using digital particle image velocimetry. Patterns of flow along the peduncle and <b>finlets</b> were quantified using manual particle tracking; more than 800 particles were tracked for at least 12 ms over a series of tailbeats from each of four fish.

50|$|The {{albacore}} has an streamlined, {{fusiform body}} with a conical snout, large mouth, and big eyes. Its body is dark blue dorsally, shades of silvery white ventrally, and covered by small scales. The pectoral fins begin slightly before the first dorsal fin and extend well beyond {{the front of the}} anal fin, usually as far as the second dorsal <b>finlet,</b> often as long as 30% of the fish's total length. Like the fish's body, the fins are dark blue on top, but change to a medium yellow color on the underside. They are markedly shorter in fish under 0.5 m in length, often resulting in confusion with T. obesus juveniles, which also have long pectoral fins, though these are rounded at the tips where the albacore's taper to a point. The first dorsal fin is a deep yellow and the second, which is smaller than the first, is a light yellow, as is the anal fin. It has 7-9 dorsal finlets and 7-8 anal finlets, dark blue and silvery white in color respectively, matching the part of the fish's body they are on. The caudal fin is also silvery white. At 1.4 m maximum length, the albacore is the smallest of the bluefin tuna. It reaches sexual maturity at 0.9 m and its common length is only slightly larger at 1.0 m.

40|$|Scombrid fishes (mackerels, bonitos and tunas) {{are noted}} for their {{high-performance}} locomotion. These fishes {{are capable of}} relatively high burst speeds [from 18 BL s- 1, where BL is body length, for mackerel (Wardle and He, 1988) to 27 BL s- 1 for tuna (Fierstine and Walters, 1968; also see Magnuson, 1978) ] and high cruising speeds [from 3. 5 BL s- 1 for mackerel (Wardle and He, 1988) to 6 – 10 BL s- 1 for tuna (Yuen, 1970; summarized in Beamish, 1978) ]. In addition, scombrids are known to migrate long distances (as far as 9700 km for the trans-Pacific crossing of the bluefin tuna; Lindsey, 1978). The morphology and kinematics of scombrids, especially in relation to hydrodynamic efficiency and energetics, {{have been the subject}} of numerous studies (e. g. Walters, 1962; Magnuson, 1970; Westneat et al., 1993; Dewar and Graham, 1994; Blake et al., 1995; Gibb et al., 1999). Finlets are among the more unusual of the morphological specializations of scombrid fishes. These small, non-retractable fins are situated on the dorsal and ventral body margin and span the region between the second dorsal and the anal fins and the caudal peduncle (Fig. 1). Scombrid fishes have 5 – 12 finlets (Collette and Nauen, 1983). On the basis of a phylogeny by Block et al. (1993), the range in <b>finlet</b> number is similar in primitive and advanced scombrid species (Fig. 1). The ubiquity of finlets in the high-performance scombrid fishes (Fig. 1) and the position of the finlets immediately anterior to the caudal fin suggest that finlets play a role in locomotion. Walters (1962) proposed that the finlets direct flow longitudinally along the body and prevent roll. Lindsey (1978) postulated that the finlets deflect water across the caudal peduncle and enhance locomotory performance by preventing separation of the boundary layer and thus reducing drag. Magnuson (1970) proposed that the finlets direct water across the pronounced central caudal keel of tuna and thereby contribute to any lift forces produced at the keel. Aleev (1969) and Helfman et al. (1997) hypothesized that the finlets eliminate or prevent vortices in water shed from the median fins and thus provide a less turbulent environment for oscillation of the tail...|$|E
