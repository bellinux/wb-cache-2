5|$|A {{video of}} Franken at the Minnesota State Fair on September 2, 2009, {{engaging}} in a <b>discussion</b> <b>with</b> a group of Tea Party protesters on health care reform, began circulating on the Internet and soon went viral. The discussion was noted for its civility, {{in contrast to the}} explosive character of several other discussions between members of the 111th Congress and their constituents that had occurred over the summer.|$|E
5|$|After a {{telephone}} <b>discussion</b> <b>with</b> a Casper weather briefer, Reid {{decided to take}} off despite the worsening conditions at the airport, {{and to try to}} escape the poor weather by turning immediately eastward. He decided to file a visual flight rules (VFR) flight plan, and depart under VFR, to be better able to cope with the heavy weather in his immediate takeoff path and the vicinity of the airport.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of October, Slovakia and Netherlands were the last countries {{to vote on the}} EFSF expansion, which was the immediate issue behind the collateral <b>discussion,</b> <b>with</b> a mid-October vote. On 13 October 2011 Slovakia approved euro bailout expansion, but the government has been forced to call new elections in exchange.|$|E
40|$|This article {{investigates the}} effects of {{political}} <b>discussions</b> <b>with</b> parents, political <b>discussions</b> <b>with</b> peers and exposure to political news during an election campaign on the voting intentions and behaviour of first-time voters. Longitudinal data collected in the Czech Republic are employed in the main analysis (N= 223). Results show that young people who frequently discuss politics with their peers are characterized by higher voting intentions and subsequent electoral participation. On the other hand, political <b>discussions</b> <b>with</b> parents and exposure to political news have no such effects. Furthermore, although {{it does not have}} an impact on voting intentions, more frequent political <b>discussions</b> <b>with</b> parents predict increased frequency of political <b>discussions</b> <b>with</b> peers. Overall, our results underscore the importance of peers in late adolescents' political socialization...|$|R
50|$|In September 2012 the Socialist Alliance {{initiated}} unity <b>discussions</b> <b>with</b> Socialist Alternative, {{the other}} main {{group on the}} Australian far-left. At the time, Socialist Alternative were in unity <b>discussions</b> <b>with</b> the Revolutionary Socialist Party (Australia) {{which led to a}} merger in early 2013.|$|R
50|$|Following the 2007 election, {{with the}} SNP {{emerging}} the largest party by one seat but short {{of an overall}} majority, it held <b>discussions</b> <b>with</b> the Scottish Green Party and also intimated {{that it would be}} open to <b>discussions</b> <b>with</b> the Liberal Democrats. However, since the Liberal Democrats had indicated that they would not enter <b>discussions</b> <b>with</b> parties which continued to favour a referendum on independence, no formal talks were held: the SNP became a minority administration and Nicol led his party to the opposition benches.|$|R
5|$|Media {{coverage}} of the movement has focused on popular leaders, such as Hensley, and the deaths of ministers by snakebite have received particular attention. Practitioners of snake handling continue to view Hensley as a great man. Kimbrough recorded a <b>discussion</b> <b>with</b> an advocate of snake handling who dismissed Hensley's personal failings as slanderous fabrications. His advocacy, leadership, and– in particular– his personal charisma were important factors in the advancement of the movement.|$|E
5|$|Rawlinson {{had already}} {{finalised}} his plans in <b>discussion</b> <b>with</b> his Corps commanders (Butler, Monash, Sir Arthur Currie of the Canadian Corps and Lieutenant General Charles Kavanagh of the Cavalry Corps) on 21 July. For the first time, the Australians would attack {{side by side}} with the Canadian Corps. Both had a reputation for aggressive and innovative tactics and a strong record of success over the past two years.|$|E
5|$|Sucker Punch began {{planning}} {{the game as}} early as 2010, when they began <b>discussion</b> <b>with</b> Sony to bring the Infamous series onto {{a new generation of}} hardware. They provided feedback to Sony on what hardware evolutions {{they would like to see}} on the PlayStation 4 system. Sucker Punch considers Second Son a fresh start for the series because it features a new protagonist. Delsin Rowe's superpowers were designed to feel fluid and suited to the open world design.|$|E

5|$|A {{day after}} announcing the attempt on his life, Nasser {{established}} a new provisional constitution proclaiming a 600-member National Assembly (400 from Egypt and 200 from Syria) and {{the dissolution of}} all political parties. Nasser gave each of the provinces two vice-presidents: Boghdadi and Amer in Egypt, and Sabri al-Asali and Akram al-Hawrani in Syria. Nasser then left for Moscow to meet with Nikita Khrushchev. At the meeting, Khrushchev pressed Nasser to lift the ban on the Communist Party, but Nasser refused, stating it was an internal matter which was not a subject of <b>discussion</b> <b>with</b> outside powers. Khrushchev was reportedly taken aback and denied he had meant to interfere in the UAR's affairs. The matter was settled as both leaders sought to prevent a rift between their two countries.|$|E
5|$|After an {{exhibition}} rout of US Armed Forces, the Lady Vols {{opened up the}} season unusually, with a conference game against Mississippi. Semeka Randall did not start the game. However, four minutes into the game, the Lady Vols were only up 4–2. At this point, Randall was put into the game, and Tennessee scored fifteen straight, on a run fueled by her. Randall scored 24, and star Chamique Holdsclaw added 23. This season opener has {{caused a lot of}} anticipation, as it was expected that this would be the game where all four of Tennessee's freshman played together. However, during a November practice, Clement had injured her foot, resulting in a stress fracture. After a <b>discussion</b> <b>with</b> the team doctor, Clement agreed to sit out the Mississippi game {{in order to be able}} to play the next game, against Louisiana Tech.|$|E

5|$|After college he {{rejoined the}} Naval Reserve {{with the aim}} of {{becoming}} an officer. Shortly after receiving his commission acceptance letter, his local bishop asked him to serve as a counselor in the bishopric. Time conflicts with bishopric meetings would have made Navy service impossible. After <b>discussion</b> <b>with</b> church apostle Harold B. Lee (his former stake president), Monson declined the commission and applied for a discharge. The Navy granted his discharge in the last group processed before the Korean War. Lee set him apart six months later as a bishop—mentioning in the blessing that he likely would not have been called if he had accepted the commission.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} to continental Europe, Forster turned toward academia. He traveled to Paris {{to seek out}} a <b>discussion</b> <b>with</b> the American revolutionary Benjamin Franklin in 1777. He taught natural history at the Collegium Carolinum in the Ottoneum, Kassel (1778–84), and later at the Academy of Vilna (Vilnius University) (1784–87). In 1788, he became head librarian at the University of Mainz. Most of his scientific work during this time consisted of essays on botany and ethnology, but he also prefaced and translated many books about travel and exploration, including a German translation of Cook's diaries.|$|E
5|$|Castelli and Martín Rodríguez {{moved to}} the Fort for an {{interview}} with Cisneros. Juan Florencio Terrada, commander of the Infantry Grenadiers, joined them, because their barracks were located under Cisneros' window, and his presence would not allow the Viceroy to request military aid to take Castelli and Martín Rodríguez prisoners. The guards let them pass unannounced, and they found Cisneros playing cards with Brigadier Quintana, prosecutor Caspe and aide Coicolea. Castelli and Rodríguez demanded once again the convening of an open cabildo, and Cisneros reacted angrily, considering their request an outrage. Rodríguez interrupted him and forced him to give a definitive answer. After a short private <b>discussion</b> <b>with</b> Caspe, Cisneros reluctantly gave his consent.|$|E

5|$|Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) {{has been}} {{promoted}} to Assistant Regional Manager {{and as a result}} is inspired to find ways to be more productive, for himself and the office. However, his ideas for the office are ignored by Andy, leading to a <b>discussion</b> <b>with</b> Jim in the warehouse about their increasing dissatisfaction with Dunder Mifflin. Jim tells Darryl about his sports marketing job opportunity in Philadelphia and offers him a possible position. However, as Jim has yet to tell Pam, Darryl says he should before going forward. When Pam comes back, Jim reveals the job opportunity to Pam, who, despite giving her approval, is upset that Jim did not consult her beforehand.|$|E
5|$|Development {{for another}} {{adaptation}} of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (filmed previously as Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory in 1971) began in 1991, {{which resulted in}} Warner Bros. providing the Dahl Estate with total artistic control. Prior to Burton's involvement, directors such as Gary Ross, Rob Minkoff, Martin Scorsese and Tom Shadyac had been involved, while actors Bill Murray, Nicolas Cage, Jim Carrey, Michael Keaton, Brad Pitt, Will Smith, Adam Sandler, and many others, were either in <b>discussion</b> <b>with</b> or considered by the studio to play Wonka.|$|E
5|$|During {{the summer}} of 1940, Hitler {{considered}} the possibility of occupying the Portuguese Azores, Cape Verde and Madeira and the Spanish Canary islands to deny the British a staging ground for military actions against Nazi-controlled Europe. In September 1940, Hitler further raised the issue in a <b>discussion</b> <b>with</b> the Spanish Foreign Minister Serrano Súñer, offering now Spain to transfer one of the Canary islands to German usage {{for the price of}} French Morocco. Although Hitler's interest in the Atlantic islands must be understood from a framework imposed by the military situation of 1940, he ultimately had no plans of ever releasing these important naval bases from German control.|$|E

5|$|Eusebius {{notes that}} this event marked the {{beginning}} of a temporary respite from persecution. Although the precise dating of this respite is not specifically noted by Eusebius, the text of the Martyrs records no Palestinian martyrs between July 25, 308 and November 13, 309. The political climate probably impinged on persecutory policy here: This was the period of the conference of Carnuntum, which met in November 308. Maximinus probably spent the next few months in <b>discussion</b> <b>with</b> Galerius over his role in the imperial government, and did not have the time to deal with the Christians.|$|E
5|$|Group Captain James Stagg of the Royal Air Force (RAF) met Eisenhower on {{the evening}} of 4 June. He and his {{meteorological}} team predicted that the weather would improve enough for the invasion to proceed on 6 June. The next available dates with the required tidal conditions (but without the desirable full moon) would be two weeks later, from 18 to 20 June. Postponement of the invasion would have required recalling men and ships already in position to cross the Channel, and would have increased the chance that the invasion plans would be detected. After much <b>discussion</b> <b>with</b> the other senior commanders, Eisenhower decided that the invasion should go ahead on the 6th. A major storm battered the Normandy coast from 19 to 22 June, which would have made the beach landings impossible.|$|E
5|$|In February, Jackson and Marvel came to terms, and he {{was signed}} to play the {{character}} in up to nine films. Downey and Rourke discussed his part during a roundtable <b>discussion</b> <b>with</b> David Ansen at the 2009 Golden Globes, and Rourke met with Favreau and Theroux to discuss the role. Rourke almost dropped out due to Marvel's initial salary offer of $250,000, but the studio raised the offer, and in March Rourke signed on. Later that same day Scarlett Johansson signed on to play the Black Widow. Her deal included options for multiple films, including potentially The Avengers. In April, Garry Shandling, Clark Gregg, and Kate Mara joined the cast.|$|E
