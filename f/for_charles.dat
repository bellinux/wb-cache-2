5|$|Conference Premier rivals York City made a £10,000 bid <b>for</b> <b>Charles</b> in June, {{which was}} {{subsequently}} rejected, with MyFootballClub members voting against the offer with over a 98% majority. Following this, York manager Martin Foyle {{said it was}} unlikely they would increase their offer <b>for</b> <b>Charles.</b> Ebbsfleet later agreed to sell Charles and striker Michael Gash for a combined fee of £80,000 to an unnamed club, which was revealed to be York and he {{was reported to have}} signed on 29 June 2009. However, the deal eventually fell through after Charles decided against joining the club as {{he did not want to}} relocate to York. Shortly after Ebbsfleet received an enquiry about him from an unnamed League Two club, although nothing came of this interest. He later became Ebbsfleet captain and was sent off for dissent in a 1–0 defeat to Tamworth on 21 November 2009. He made 42 appearances for Ebbsfleet during the 2009–10 as they were relegated to the Conference South.|$|E

He was taken to Visegrád, where he died on 24 February.|$|E

A collection of his speeches was published in 1857. Recognised as a supporter of education and technological progress, he was invited to speak at scientific meetings, such as the memorable address he delivered as president of the British Association for the Advancement of Science when it met at Aberdeen in 1859. His espousal of science met with clerical opposition; he and Palmerston unsuccessfully recommended a knighthood <b>for</b> <b>Charles</b> Darwin, after the publication of On the Origin of Species, which was opposed by the Bishop of Oxford.|$|E

Later, after releasing five Spanish-language albums that all achieved unprecedented milestones in the Latin music industry, Koppelman considered that Selena had reached her peak in the Spanish market, and he began preparations for a crossover album.|$|E
5|$|By 1614, {{the ditch}} outside the walls {{appears to have}} been {{partially}} filled in and the reclaimed land rented out.

Parliamentary forces intervened and reoccupied the city, burning the wooden city gates and deliberately damaging, or slighting, the walls near Canterbury Castle. With the restoration of Charles II to the throne in 1660, new wooden doors were installed at the West Gate.|$|E
