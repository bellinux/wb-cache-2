40|$|Purpose – The text {{deals with}} the recent case law of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) on the {{directive}} on the retention of data (metadata) by providers of electronic communications services {{for the purposes of}} investigation, detection and prosecution of serious crimes. The authors seek to clarify the implications of the declaration of invalidity of this European directive for the EU Member States, towards the protection of legal equality of European citizens. Methodology/approach/design – The text was drafted while there was a pending ECJ’s response to the questions referred by two national courts (one Swedish and one British) on the effects of that <b>invalidity</b> <b>decision</b> on the domestic legislation that transposed it. Thus, the authors sought to anticipate the Court's decision in the light of its settled case law and the reaction of the Member States’ authorities’ after the declaration of invalidity of the referred directive. Findings – In the light of the particularities of the protection of fundamental rights in the EU and the legal model of integration, the authors draw some guidelines as to the procedure to be followed in future cases in order to safeguard the effectiveness of the Union law, namely {{when it comes to the}} legal equality of European citizens...|$|E
40|$|I analyse how patent {{litigation}} {{outcome in}} Germany affects {{the performance of}} the disputing firms by interpreting changes in a firm's credit rating as a proxy for changes in firm performance. The results match theoretical considerations on the functioning of the bifurcated German patent litigation system: The separation of litigation and <b>invalidity</b> <b>decisions,</b> resulting in <b>invalidity</b> <b>decisions</b> taking much longer than decisions on infringement, provides patent holders with a window of opportunity to enforce patents that may later be invalidated. This shifts a major share of the immediate risk to the defendant and allocates bargaining power to the plaintiff. The estimation results provide support for this incongruity. Plaintiffs on average profit from litigation while defendants agreeing upon a settlement deal lose as much as defendants losing in trial. I further show that small, inexperienced defendant firms are at a disadvantage when dealing with litigation. ...|$|R
40|$|Procedural reasons, {{unlike other}} reasons for <b>invalidity</b> of <b>decisions</b> made by the Assembly in a Limited {{liability}} company (hereinafter:Ltd) in the judicial and business practice open up {{the highest number of}} legal questions. These are “mistakes in the steps” that lead to <b>invalidity</b> of <b>decisions</b> made by the Assembly in Ltd. about which in the domestic legal literature has not been systematically discussed. The starting point for the elaboration of this issue is based on the circumstance that in the provision of article 448 of the Companies Act is stipulated that to the <b>invalidity</b> of <b>decisions</b> made by the Assembly in Ltd. appropriately apply the provisions on the <b>invalidity</b> of <b>decisions</b> made by the General Assembly in PLC (Public Limited Company). Procedural differences in working of the General Assembly in PLC and Assembly in Ltd. is one of the fundamental differences between these two types of capital companies and this kind of positive legal regulation leads to legal uncertainty and misinterpretations. The first part of this paper gives a chronological overview of the domestic law with regard to <b>invalidity</b> of <b>decisions</b> made by the Assembly in Ltd. Then are doctrinally deferred invalid decisions from the other decisions with defect. Then, each provision on the <b>invalidity</b> of <b>decisions</b> made by the General Assembly in PLC is tested and then explicitly formulated provision which is valid only within the context of Ltd. Apart from domestic law are analyzed also solutions from comparative law (especially German) because domestic law largely overlaps with the solutions from comparative law. In conclusion after completion of analysis, the obtained findings are used as guidelines for more practical de lege ferenda regulation in the Companies Act regarding the <b>invalidity</b> of <b>decisions</b> made by the Assembly in Ltd...|$|R
40|$|Petitioner Oil States Energy Services sued {{respondent}} Greene’s Energy Group in {{a district}} court on several counts, including patent infringement. Greene’s then petitioned the U. S. Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) to challenge {{the validity of the}} patent claims asserted in the litigation. The PTO cancelled the claims, and the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit summarily affirmed that determination. Had this Court not granted certiorari, the petitioner’s patent infringement cause of action would have been extinguished by the PTO’s decision. The error made by the Federal Circuit in the opinions that bound the court in the instant case, and repeated by respondents in certiorari briefing, lies in the attempt to classify patents as either public or private rights in a categorical manner – that is, in isolation from any particular cause of action. This framing is improper because, under this Court’s precedents, the question whether a case involves a private right that must be adjudicated by an Article III tribunal relates to a particular legal action or claim, not the underlying privilege or property interest. Under the correct approach, which takes into account {{the context in which the}} PTO makes its <b>invalidity</b> <b>decisions,</b> the Inter Partes Review (IPR) statute at issue in this case should be held unconstitutional because it empowers an agency to resolve a claim of private right: an action for patent infringement. The cause of action for patent infringement is a private right because it has long been recognized as a species of trespass claim by which the plaintiff typically seeks, among other remedies, monetary relief for past harm from another private party. Because of its historic characterization as a trespass, infringement has a close kinship to common-law claims that this Court has recognized as private rights that cannot be adjudicated outside Article III courts. Invalidity is one of several, enumerated affirmative defenses that a defendant in a patent case may plead in response to an allegation of patent infringement. The IPR statute effectively removes this affirmative defense to infringement from Article III courts, and empowers the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB), an arm of the PTO, to decide it. In many cases, including one involving these very litigants, a determination of invalidity by the PTAB has extinguished parallel district court actions for patent infringement. This delegation of judicial power over such causes of action to a body that is not a part of the judiciary, and not an adjunct to an Article III court, is constitutionally forbidden by this Court’s precedents. The IPR statute offends the doctrine of separation of powers for another, closely related reason: It effectively grants to the PTAB the power to direct that pending cases be dismissed. Although Congress can constitutionally abate extant claims by amending applicable law while the litigation is pending, Congress in this case delegated to an agency the power to extinguish a claim by adjudicating an affirmative defense in favor of a defendant. Because the PTAB here fully resolved a claim concurrently pending {{in a district}} court, it violated the rule that coordinate branches cannot direct Article III courts to dispose of specific cases in a particular way. The doctrine of separation of powers exists in part to prevent abuses that might eventuate if claims of private rights are adjudicated outside Article III courts. By empowering the Executive Branch to resolve such disputes in the patent infringement context, the IPR statute weakens Article III safeguards of impartial adjudication, and therefore contravenes separation of powers principles...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{has as its}} object the {{contrary}} understandings and in favour of thethesis that proposes the relativization of res judicata material in case of violation ofconstitutional standards. With the contrast between legal certainty and other constitutionalvalues, there are doctrinal disagreements as to the legal nature of the defects ofunconstitutionality (consistent in considering whether this generates the lack, the <b>invalidity</b> orineffectiveness of <b>decision</b> of merit), which binds the choice of procedural instrument to beused for the termination of the trial. At that point, the doctrine addresses four main situationsrelated to the legal nature of the decision and the means of termination: the ruling based onlaw that is subsequently declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court; the decisionestablished in law ever declared unconstitutional; the decision ceases to apply standardconsidered unconstitutional, which subsequently is declared constitutional by the SupremeCourt and the decision which violates directly the Federal Constitution. The study of theseissues is critical given the chance brought by articles 475 -L, § 1, and 741, sole paragraph, ofthe Code of Civil Procedure. From the analysis of res judicata as unconstitutional anddoctrinal positions on the subject, aims to verify the legal nature of the addiction ofunconstitutionality and their consequences for possible rescission of decision, if there is aconflict between constitutional norms and values which should prevail. DOI:[URL] presente estudo tem como objeto as manifestações contrárias e favoráveis à tese que propõe a relativização da coisa julgada material em caso de violação de normas constitucionais.
