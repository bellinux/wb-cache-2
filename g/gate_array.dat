Our experience indicates that RPGAs are easily {{integrated into the}} classroom, but are not yet sufficiently mature to permit comparable integration into a research environment. While reprogrammable <b>gate</b> <b>arrays</b> offer the potential for reduced area and chip count, routing and interconnect issues presently detract from their utility as building blocks in high-performance systems. We believe {{this is due to}} asymmetrical advancement rates of hardware and software technology. We point out the principal difficulties with using reprogrammable <b>gate</b> <b>arrays</b> in performance critical designs, and offer suggestions for improvement. 1. 0 Introduction We have described in previous work our interest in the rapid prototyping of digital systems at the Thayer School of Engineering [FaHi 89].

Unlike the nanofluidic field-effect transistor, where only the amount of ions/molecules is regulated by an electrostatic potential, the field-effect reconfigurable diode {{can be used to}} control both directions and magnitudes of ion/molecule transport. This device could be deemed as the building blocks for ionic counterpart of the electronic field-programmable <b>gate</b> <b>array.</b>|$|E

40|$|The recent {{introduction}} of partially-reconfigurable-field-programmable <b>gate</b> <b>arrays</b> (PRFPGAs) {{has led to}} the need for new algorithms suited for use with these devices.

This paper examines the applicability of PRFPGAs in hardware emulation sys-tems. A partitioning algorithm known as temporal partitioning is introduced for use with PRFPGA-based hardware emulation systems. Partitioning for field-programmable <b>gate</b> <b>arrays</b> (FPGAs) refers to the process of splitting a large circuit into smaller sub-circuits.
