5|$|Negroes are not {{barred from}} {{organized}} baseball by the commissioner {{and never have}} been in the 21years I have served. There is no rule in organized baseball prohibiting their participation and never has been to my knowledge. If Durocher, or if any other manager, or all of them, want to sign one, or twenty-five Negro players, it is all right with me. That <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>business</b> of the managers and the club owners. The business of the commissioner is to interpret the rules of baseball, and to enforce them.|$|E
