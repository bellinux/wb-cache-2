40|$|The AMBA Advanced high {{performance}} bus (AHB) protocol design {{acts as an}} interface between two different IP cores. In this work initially the investigation on the AHB is carried out and the basic commands and its working are identified based on which the signal flow diagram and the specifications are developed for designing the AMBA-AHB using VHDL. In this paper we propose the design and implementation of a flexible arbiter scheme for the AHB busmatrix based on burst operation. Basically, AHB burst operation is that a sequence of operation happens {{with respect to the}} size given and it supports only three burst sizes. The size is acting as one of the input to the master during the burst operation and after each burst operation, the master or slave will go to the <b>IDLE</b> <b>stage.</b> The AHB design contains basic blocks such as master and slave and the working of these blocks based on arbitration scheme. According to arbitration scheme only one master can Access the bus at any one time. Multiplexer and Decoders are used to selects the appropriate signals between master and slaves that are involved in the transfer. This AMBA-AHB protocol can be adopted in all the applications provided the design should be an AHB compliant...|$|E

40|$|Abstract- In {{this paper}} we present {{deterministic}} clock gating schemes for various micro architectural blocks {{of a modern}} out-of-order superscalar processor. We propose {{to make use of}} 1) <b>idle</b> <b>stages</b> of the pipelined function units (FUs) and 2) wrong-path instruction execution during branch mis-prediction, in order to clock gate various stages of FUs. The baseline Pipelined Functional unit Clock Gating (PFCG), presented for evaluation purpose only, disables the clock on <b>idle</b> <b>stages</b> and thus results in 13. 93 % chip-wide energy saving. Wrong-path instruction Clock Gating (WPCG) detects wrong-path instructions in the event of branch misprediction and prevents them from being issued to the FUs, and subsequently, disables the clock of these FUs along with reducing the stress on register file and cache. Simulations demonstrate that more than 92 % of all wrong-path instructions can be detected and stopped from being executed. The WPCG architecture results in 16. 26 % chip-wide energy savings which is 2. 33 % more than that of the baseline PFCG scheme. I...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} the usefulness and {{viability of the}} scheme developed by Viola and Lloyd [Phys. Rev. A 58, 2733 (1998) ] to control dephasing {{in the context of}} exciton-based quantum computation with self-assembled quantum dots. We demonstrate that optical coherence of a confined exciton qubit exposed to phonon-induced dephasing can be substantially enhanced through the application of a simple periodic sequence of control pulses. The shape of the quantum dot has a significant effect on the dephasing properties. Remarkably, we find that quantum dots with parameters optimized for implementing quantum computation are among the most susceptible to dephasing, yet periodic decoupling is most efficient for exactly that type of dot. We also show that the presence of an electric field, which is a necessary ingredient for many exciton-based quantum computing schemes, may further increase the control efficiency. Our results suggest that dynamical decoupling may be a method of choice for robust storage of exciton qubits during <b>idle</b> <b>stages</b> of quantum algorithms. Comment: submitted to PR...|$|R
40|$|Four {{points of}} major {{criticism}} {{can be identified}} regarding the application of firm life-cycle theory on SMEs: inconsistency of empirical validation; descriptive nature of the model; regression in the cycle is neglected; and linear, sequential life-cycle model. Data was collected on Australian SMEs in the ICT sector, using an established quantitative methodology. Propositions were formulated based on critical literature, and were evaluated using the data. It was found, that the life-cycle classification was possible and meaningful. Progression along the life-cycle path was predominant, but regression could also be identified. An <b>idle</b> life-cycle <b>stage</b> could not be clearly identified using clustering. However, when investigating the shift between life-cycle stages, a substantial group of idle firms has been show...|$|R

40|$|Abstract â€” This paper {{describes}} an experimental chip of self-timed (clockless) power-aware pipeline incorporating stage-by-stage power gating scheme. Its power gating circuit cuts the voltage-supply to the <b>idle</b> pipeline <b>stages</b> {{in order to}} reduce the static (leakage) power dissipation. To reduce the dynamic power dissipation, self-timed pipeline (STP) is one of the suitable circuit architectures because its ondemand transfer control activates only the pipeline stages operating valid data and thus unexpected signal propagation resulting in transistor switching is gated at pipeline stage level. Moreover, each pipeline stage can be slowed down in parallel with processing by introducing dynamic voltage scaling techniques and thus both the dynamic and static power dissipations can be reduced. In this paper, powerperformance characteristics of the self-timed power-aware pipeline (ULP-STP) are experimentally analyzed through measuring the actual 65 nm CMOS LSI chips and simulating the optimized ULP-STP. The experimental results indicate that autonomous power-awareness of the ULP-STP can save about 48 % power in case of intermittent operation mode...|$|R
30|$|The task of {{simulating}} {{a folded}} volume is rather {{different from the}} synthetic examples discussed initially. For fold simulations, the initial geological surface defining the boundary condition will contain {{a significant number of}} subdomains. Because of this, the list used for subdomain scheduling will be quite long already from the start. When this list is long, it is easier to make full use of the available computing resources, thus resulting in a substantial effect of parallelisation. For simpler problems, where the boundary condition is represented by one or a few point sources, only a few subdomains will be scheduled as active. Thus, some of the available computing resources will be <b>idling</b> until later <b>stages</b> of the solution process when the lists grow longer. Since GPUs have an intrinsic capability of processing a large number of subdomains simultaneously, the simulation of geological folds based on LAS or SOLAS is particularly suitable for GPUs.|$|R
