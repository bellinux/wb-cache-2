30|$|Overall, {{it could}} be said that <b>the</b> FB <b>group</b> can be {{conceived}} as an enabling factor for socialization performance, especially for those who had fewer relationships before <b>joining</b> <b>the</b> <b>group.</b> In fact, among those students who have a FB profile, more than a half stated that they had less than three friends—among their mates—on <b>the</b> FB before <b>joining</b> <b>the</b> <b>group,</b> while they increased of at least of three people the number of friends after <b>joining</b> <b>the</b> <b>group.</b> On <b>the</b> other hand, those who had at least three mates as friends on <b>the</b> FB before <b>joining</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> had a poorer socializing performance after <b>joining</b> <b>the</b> <b>group.</b>|$|R

5|$|The Boys Light Up reached No. 4 on the Australian album {{charts and}} {{remained}} in the charts for an unbroken 101 weeks. It sold five times platinum: over 280,000 copies, {{and became one of}} the biggest Australian albums of the 1980s. Singer/guitarist/songwriter Guy McDonough (ex-The Flatheads and Bill's younger brother) <b>joined</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> in October 1980.|$|E
5|$|According to {{the medieval}} chronicler Geoffrey Gaimar, after the Battle of Stamford Bridge Harold {{entrusted}} the loot gained from Harold Hardrada to Ealdred. Gaimar asserts that King Harold did {{this because he}} had heard of Duke William's landing in England, and needed to rush south to counter it. After the Battle of Hastings, Ealdred <b>joined</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> who tried to elevate Edgar the Ætheling, Edward the Exile's son, as king, but eventually he submitted to William the Conqueror at Berkhamsted. John of Worcester says that the group supporting Edgar vacillated {{over what to do}} while William ravaged the countryside, which led to Ealdred and Edgar's submission to William.|$|E

5|$|At a {{scheduled}} layover in Chicago, they disembarked {{only long enough}} for breakfast and to answer some brief media questions before the train resumed its route. In Omaha, Nebraska, the King was {{the guest of honor}} at a reception held in the home of Judge James M. Woolworth. Most of the attendees were friends of the judge's daughter, who had met the King on a vacation in Hawaii. Although Kalākaua had claimed exhaustion from his world trip, he nevertheless danced the whole night with the women guests. Claus and Mrs. Spreckels <b>joined</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> at Ogden, Utah.|$|E
5|$|Badmotorfinger was Soundgarden's {{first album}} with bassist Ben Shepherd, who <b>joined</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> in April 1990. Shepherd {{replaced}} previous bassist Jason Everman. The album {{was recorded in}} the spring of 1991 at Studio D in Sausalito, California, Bear Creek Studios in Woodinville, Washington, and A Studios in Los Angeles, California. Soundgarden chose to work with producer Terry Date again as it had on its previous release Louder Than Love (1989). Frontman Chris Cornell said the band decided to work with Date again seeing as the band had a good relationship with him {{and did not want to}} go through the pressure of trying to find a new producer.|$|E

After Atlantis turned heel and <b>joined</b> <b>the</b> <b>group,</b> they became known as Los Guerreros de la Atlántida, it was teased that Bucanero would break up with Guerrero but Bucanero stayed with the group and Los Guerreros feuded with Perro Aguayo, Jr.'s Los Perros del Mal faction into 2006. At the end of April, he teamed with Tarzan Boy to win a double hair vs. hair match against Mr. Águila and Damián 666 in the main event of the 50. Aniversario de Arena México show.|$|E
5|$|Elmore {{requested}} {{a leave of}} absence from Northwestern Law School in 2001 to focus on the band.

The band completed a fall West Coast tour and began recording their debut album with Romanski. The band took on the name The Reputation at this time.|$|E
5|$|Frank Case, {{owner of}} the hotel, ensured a daily luncheon for the talented group of young writers by {{treating}} them to free celery and popovers; more importantly, they were provided with their own table and waiter. Edna Ferber, Franklin P. Adams, George S. Kaufman, Heywood Broun, and Marc Connelly eventually <b>joined</b> <b>the</b> <b>group,</b> expanding its membership. All members were affiliated with the Algonquin Round Table, although they referred to themselves as the Vicious Circle.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1970s and early 1980s, FIG toured Europe several times, where they played at festivals at various venues, {{including}} Paris, Berlin, Rome, Copenhagen, Stockholm and Reykjavík. When Cooper and Born were performing with Henry Cow in Zürich in early 1978, Cooper invited Swiss pianist Irène Schweizer to join FIG. English filmmaker Sally Potter, who played saxophone and sang, <b>joined</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> in April 1978. Dutch trombonist Annemarie Roelofs, English singer Frankie Armstrong, Dutch woodwind player Angèle Veltmeijer, and French saxophonist and guitarist Françoise Dupety also played intermittently with the group.

5|$|Over {{the next}} several days, more Texian {{settlers}} <b>joined</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> at La Bahía. Many of them were from Refugio, a sprawling settlement that was furthest from Matagorda. Historian Hobart Huson speculates that these men were the last to receive word of the planned attack. Austin ordered that 100men remain at Goliad, {{under the command of}} Dimmitt, while the rest should join the Texian Army in marching on Cos's troops in Béxar. Collinsworth returned to Matagorda to recruit additional soldiers, but on October 14 the remaining Texians at Goliad began the march towards Béxar.|$|E

5|$|Rather Ripped is the 14th studio album by the American {{experimental}} {{rock band}} Sonic Youth. It {{was released on}} June 13, 2006, by Geffen Records. The record was the band's first album after the departure of multi-instrumentalist Jim O'Rourke, who <b>joined</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> as a fifth member in 1999. Unlike its immediate predecessors, Rather Ripped was produced by John Agnello and recorded at Sear Sound in New York City, the same studio where the band's 1994 album Experimental Jet Set, Trash and No Star was recorded. It also completed Sonic Youth's contract with Geffen, which released the band's previous eight records.|$|E
5|$|Sturm {{left early}} on, but Konietzko {{continued}} performing, {{at one point}} having twenty people in his troupe, which by then was engaged in antics such as fire eating and throwing entrails at audiences. Konietzko then returned to Hamburg, where he joined up with Peter Missing in his new band Missing Foundation. Drummer Nicklaus Schandelmaier, who had recently moved to Hamburg from Frankfurt, also <b>joined</b> <b>the</b> <b>group,</b> and took the stage name En Esch. Although the group did some live performances, Konietzko and Esch dropped out of Missing Foundation before any recordings were made {{and went back to}} work as KMFDM, collaborating with Hamburg-based studio owner Raymond Watts.|$|E
5|$|The {{character}} of Barton Fink is {{loosely based on}} Clifford Odets, a playwright from New York who in the 1930s <b>joined</b> <b>the</b> <b>Group</b> Theatre, a gathering of dramatists which included Harold Clurman, Cheryl Crawford, and Lee Strasberg. Their work emphasized social issues and employed Stanislavski's system of acting to recreate human experience as truthfully as possible. Several of Odets' plays were successfully performed on Broadway, including Awake and Sing! and Waiting for Lefty (both in 1935). When public tastes turned away from politically engaged theatre and toward the familial realism of Eugene O'Neill, Odets had difficulty producing successful work, so he moved to Hollywood and spent 20 years writing film scripts.|$|E

40|$|Many {{users who}} are in a cyber-space usually want to <b>join</b> <b>the</b> social <b>group</b> to have or to share their information. Now, {{there are two ways to}} <b>join</b> <b>the</b> <b>group,</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> manager invites them, and the users who want to <b>join</b> ask <b>the</b> owner. These days <b>the</b> <b>group</b> polices usually follow this way. But, it can be faced a {{security}} problem when <b>the</b> manager send <b>group</b> messages in near future because they don’t have any securities. Therefore, the security modules to join groups will be needed when they <b>join</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> or when they read <b>the</b> <b>group</b> messages. To set the security, we have to think how to keep the key such as a generation /an update/an arrangement, because all users need <b>the</b> key to <b>join</b> <b>the</b> <b>groups</b> or to read <b>the</b> <b>group</b> messages by decrypting. The key are going to be used to <b>joining</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> when it dynamically changes such as frequent group joining and leaving. If it applies or uses the existing methods in the smart cities which consider the users who will move globally, it could easily assume that the overhead/the cost of CPU will be increased and it follows capacity down because of lots of the key updates. So, to let them down, we suggest three key strategies, a group key, a subgroup key and a session key in this paper...|$|R
