50|$|Mirrored {{sunglasses}} are sunglasses with {{a reflective}} optical coating (called a mirror coating or <b>flash</b> <b>coating)</b> {{on the outside}} of the lenses to make them appear like small mirrors. The lenses typically give the wearer's vision a brown or grey tint. The mirror coating decreases the amount of light passing through the tinted lens by a further 10-60%, making it especially useful for conditions of sand, water, snow, and higher altitudes. Mirrored sunglasses are one-way mirrors.|$|E

How to obtain the corresponding surface point clouds is always an important work in reverse engineering. Faro Laser Scanner Fonton 120 was used to scan an organic material which is composed of potassium stearate, sodium stearate, polyvinyl alcohol and paraffin liquid in a dark room. The organic material has fewer reflectors and is penetrated by laser of scanner. For increasing the reflector and obtaining high-accuracy 3 D model, the <b>flash</b> sliver was <b>coated</b> on organic material’s surface. Flash sliver was found not only increasing the high reflector but also preventing laser penetrating. It indicated that <b>coating</b> <b>flash</b> sliver was an efficient method to obtain high-quality point clouds. These findings have supplied a basis for 3 D laser scanner appling {{to the field of}} organic material...|$|R
60|$|Afterwards Otomie, Guatemoc, and I {{went into}} the garden of the palace and sat upon {{the crest of a}} small pyramid, a teocalli in {{miniature}} that Montezuma had built for a place of outlook on the market and the courts of the temple. From this spot we saw the dancing of the Aztec nobles, and heard the song of the musicians. It was a gay sight, for in the bright sunlight their feather dresses <b>flashed</b> like <b>coats</b> of gems, and none would have guessed how it was to end. Mingling with the dancers were groups of Spaniards clad in mail and armed with swords and matchlocks, but I noted that, as the time went on, these men separated themselves from the Indians and began to cluster like bees about the gates and at various points under the shadow of the Wall of Serpents.|$|R

Officers chased then 16-year-old Keef, who turned around several times and pointed the gun at them. The policemen [...] "discharged their weapons," [...] but missed. They caught him a half-block later and recovered the pistol, which was loaded. Keef was charged with three counts of aggravated assault with a firearm on a police officer and aggravated unlawful use of a weapon. He was also given a misdemeanor charge for resisting arrest. He was held in the Cook County Juvenile Detention Center until a judge sentenced him to home confinement at his grandmother’s house.|$|R
50|$|The Army Aircrew Combat Uniform (A2CU) is a two-piece flight suit in the {{universal}} camouflage pattern that offers the soldier protection from <b>flash</b> fires. The <b>coat</b> {{is similar to the}} ACU in design, with a stand-up collar featuring a front extension, shoulder patches, a front zipper, two inside hanging chest pockets with flaps; adjustable waist; two-piece set-in sleeves with elbow patches; two sleeve utility pockets with flaps and Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) tabs; and two lower sleeve pencil pockets with flaps. It can be worn with the Air Warrior Microclimate Cooling Vest. The trousers have nine pockets: two thigh pockets; two calf pockets with external tool pockets; one knife pocket with lanyard (on the left thigh); and two side hanging pockets. Pockets (except for the side hanging pockets and the lower leg external tool pockets) have flaps and zippers.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{describe}} a technology platform {{to study the}} effect of nanocues on the cell growth direction in primary cortical cell culture. Topographical cues to cells are provided using nanoscale features created by Jet and <b>Flash</b> Imprint Lithography, <b>coated</b> with polyethylenimine. We investigated nanoscaffolds with periodicities ranging from 200 nm to 2000 nm, {{and found that the}} samples with a period between 400 nm and 600 nm and a height of 118 nm showed highly ordered regions of neurites in a newly formed network with a preferential alignment tendency for astrocytes. Live/dead staining results showed that different materials, such as silicon, glass, and imprinted resist are rendered biocompatible by coating with polyethylenimine. This coating therefore allows for a free choice of scaffold materials and promotes good cell-substrate adhesion. From our results we conclude particular length scales of nanoscaffold can impose a degree of order on cell spreading behavior in a complex cellular brain-on-a-chip network, which could thus be used to emulate ordered brain regions and their function in vitr...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{develop a}} {{practical}} method of measuring shotcrete early strength ansite {{in the first}} six hours after application using a partial beam test standard, ASTM C 1 16 - 90. Determining the early-strength development of as-sprayed shotcrete can improve mine safety by identifying appropriate reentry times and providing a convenient means of quality control during application. A more thorough understanding of shotcrete early strength will lead to improvements in ground support practices, thereby preventing ground falls and reducing mine roof-fall accidents. Background: When shotcrete is used as part of a multi component ground support system, {{it is important to know}} when the material has developed enough strength to be self-supporting and allow for reentry and emplacement of the remaining support elements that require drilling of the shotcrete layer without degradation. Typical reported values for this threshold strength for North American mines range from 1 to 1. 6 MPa (145 to 233 psi) [O'Toole and Pope 2006], with a compressive strength equivalent to 1 MPa (145 psi) being the norm [Rispin et al. 2003; O'Toole and Pope 2006]. Typical ground control support includes a shotcrete <b>flash</b> <b>coat</b> 19 - to 25 -mm (3 / 4 - to 1 -in) thick, followed by screen, plates, bolts, and a second layer of shotcrete bringing the combined thickness to 75 to 100 mm (3 to 4 in). In areas requiring rehabilitation, the second layer of shotcrete is plated and bolted as well. While testing cored samples after 24 hours is standard, this is not practical for the one- to six-hour period following application when shotcrete unconfined compressive strengths are less than 10 MPa (1, 450 psi). Indirect methods are typically used to determine shotcrete strength during the early stages of curing because the partially cured or green material is difficult to sample and test. While problems with inconsistent test results have been reported with the penetrometer-type devices, beam molds have been used successfully for creating shotcrete test specimens in the United States and Canada. Operating the Partial Beam Test System: The test unit is a self-contained, servo-controlled, stiff-frame press. Partial beam test samples are obtained by spraying shotcrete into 102 - x 102 - x 152 -mm (4 - x 4 - x 6 -in) mold boxes. After the samples have been sprayed, tests are conducted at one-hour intervals over the next six hours (one- through six-hour tests). The shotcrete samples are carefully demolded by disassembling the mold fixtures and removing the enclosed sample. Next, a shotcrete sample is placed in a specialized testing fixture and centered under the loading head of the test machine. When the test sequence is initiated, a programmable-logic-controller- (PLC) driven press applies a fixed-rate load to the sample. The load profile is shown on a graphical output display, and the measured test parameters (time, displacement, and load) are stored on a thumb drive. Once the operator observes a well-defined peak in the load profile curve, the test is completed and the test machine's loading platen can be returned to its initial starting position. Peak load is typically reflected by the development of large vertically oriented cracks along the platen-to sample contact edges, which are indicative of the failure plane. There is a marked difference in early-strength gain between sprayed and cast shotcrete. The cast shotcrete samples have a similar strength gain profile to that of cast concrete samples.

6000|$|But 'all {{things do}} end,' {{and so did}} this; and {{the silence of the}} hounds also; and a faint but knowing whimper drove St. Francis out of all heads, and Lancelot began to stalk slowly with a dozen {{horsemen}} up the wood-ride, to a fitful accompaniment of wandering hound-music, where the choristers were as invisible as nightingales among the thick cover. And hark! just as the book was returned to his pocket, the sweet hubbub suddenly crashed out into one jubilant shriek, and then swept away fainter and fainter among the trees. [...] The walk became a trot--the trot a canter. Then a faint melancholy shout at a distance, answered by a 'Stole away!' from the fields; a doleful 'toot!' of the horn; the dull thunder of many horsehoofs rolling along the farther woodside. Then red <b>coats,</b> <b>flashing</b> like sparks of fire across the gray gap of mist at the ride's-mouth, then a whipper-in, bringing up a belated hound, burst into the pathway, smashing and plunging, with shut eyes, through ash-saplings and hassock-grass; then a fat farmer, sedulously pounding through the mud, was overtaken and bespattered in spite of all his struggles;-- until the line streamed out into the wide rushy pasture, startling up pewits and curlews, as horsemen poured in from every side, and cunning old farmers rode off at inexplicable angles to some well- known haunts of pug: and right ahead, chiming and jangling sweet madness, the dappled pack glanced and wavered through the veil of soft grey mist. 'What's the use of this hurry?' growled Lancelot. [...] 'They will all be back again. I never have the luck to see a run.' ...|$|R

Unconsciously she was {{thinking}} of her husband. That Philip had been uprooted, cast down like the pine filled her with dread as she went quickly from the kitchen. But the storm, which left the house in total darkness during the night had also interfered with telephone service. After vain attempts to communicate with the central office, she dashed off a note to a well-known nerve specialist. She begged him to come at once, explaining that her husband was too ill to leave his bed. From the terrace she watched the gardener depart with her note. She felt at last like one who stakes all on a final venture. Would the doctor come soon? Would Philip resent the visit? Above all, how should she break the news to the invalid, who begged to be left alone? [...] "Don't call a doctor," [...] he had pleaded; and again she wondered if she had been wise in a grave emergency. The house was now astir. Belated maids were at work. Soon shrill exclamations arose from the wet garden. Madame had discovered the fallen pine, to fly below with the boy. Reginald was proudly equipped with rubber boots. His red <b>coat</b> <b>flashed</b> as he outran his excited companion. Isabel translated the French woman's lament for the lost tree; then the boy cried out in distress. His mother reached his side to find him in tears, holding a dead oriole. The once gay, golden little creature lay limp in the child's hand.|$|R
40|$|Many {{energetic}} {{systems can}} be activated via mechanical means. Percussion primers in small caliber ammunition and stab detonators used in medium caliber ammunition are just two examples. Current medium caliber (20 - 60 mm) munitions are detonated {{through the use of}} impact sensitive stab detonators. Stab detonators are very sensitive and must be small, as to meet weight and size limitations. A mix of energetic powders, sensitive to mechanical stimulus, is typically used to ignite such devices. Stab detonators are mechanically activated by forcing a firing pin through the closure disc of the device and into the stab initiating mix. Rapid heating caused by mechanically driven compression and friction of the mixture results in its ignition. The rapid decomposition of these materials generates a pressure/temperature pulse that is sufficient to initiate a transfer charge, which has enough output energy to detonate the main charge. This general type of ignition mix is used in a large variety of primers, igniters, and detonators. [1] Common primer mixes, such as NOL- 130, are made up of lead styphnate (basic) 40 %, lead azide (dextrinated) 20 %, barium nitrate 20 %, antimony sulfide 15 %, and tetrazene 5 %. [1] These materials pose acute and chronic toxicity hazards during mixing of the composition and later in the item life cycle after the item has been field functioned. There is an established need to replace these mixes on toxicity, health, and environmental hazard grounds. This effort attempts to demonstrate that environmentally acceptable energetic solgel <b>coated</b> <b>flash</b> metal multilayer nanocomposites can be used to replace current impact initiated devices (IIDs), which have hazardous and toxic components. Successful completion of this project will result in IIDs that include innocuous compounds, have sufficient output energy for initiation, meet current military specifications, are small, cost competitive, and perform as well as or better than current devices. We expect flash metal multilayer and sol-gel to be generic technologies applicable {{to a wide range of}} devices, especially in small caliber ammunition and sub-munitions. We will replace the NOL- 130 mixture with a nanocomposite that consists of a mechanically robust energetic multilayer foil that has been coated with a sol-gel energetic material. The exothermic reactions are activated in this nanocomposite are the transformation of the multilayer material to its respective intermetallic alloy and the thermite reaction, which is characterized by very high temperatures, a small pressure pulse, and hot particle ejection. The proposed materials and their reaction products consist of, but are not limited to aluminum, nickel, iron, aluminum oxide, titanium, iron oxide and boron. These materials have much more desirable environmental and health characteristics than the NOL- 130 composition...|$|R
40|$|The {{coupling}} of energetic metallic multilayers (a. k. a. flash metal) with energetic sol-gel synthesis {{and processing}} {{is an entirely}} new approach to forming energetic devices for several DoD and DOE needs. They are also practical and commercially viable manufacturing techniques. Improved occupational safety and health, performance, reliability, reproducibility, and environmentally acceptable processing can be achieved using these methodologies and materials. The development and fielding of this technology will enhance mission readiness and reduce the costs, environmental risks {{and the necessity of}} resolving environmental concerns related to maintaining military readiness while simultaneously enhancing safety and health. Without sacrificing current performance, we will formulate new impact initiated device (IID) compositions to replace materials from the current composition that pose significant environmental, health, and safety problems associated with functions such as synthesis, material receipt, storage, handling, processing into the composition, reaction products from testing, and safe disposal. To do this, we will advance the use of nanocomposite preparation via the use of multilayer flash metal and sol-gel technologies and apply it to new small IIDs. This work will also serve to demonstrate that these technologies and resultant materials are relevant and practical to a variety of energetic needs of DoD and DOE. The goal will be to produce an IID whose composition is acceptable by OSHA, EPA, the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, Resource Recovery Act, etc. standards, without sacrificing current performance. The development of environmentally benign stab detonators and igniters will result in the removal of hazardous and toxic components associated with their manufacturing, handling, and use. This will lead to improved worker safety during manufacturing as well as reduced exposure of Service personnel during their storage and or use in operations. The implementation of energetic sol-gel coated metallic multilayers, as new small IIDs will result in dramatically reduced environmental risks and improved worker and user safety risks without any sacrifice in the performance of the device. The proposed effort is designed to field an IID that is free of toxic (e. g., tetrazene) and heavy metal constituents (e. g., lead styphnate, lead azide, barium nitrate, and antimony sulfides) present in the NOL- 130 initiating mixture and in the lead azide transfer charge of current stab detonators. The preferred materials for this project are nanocomposites consisting of thin foils of metallic multilayers, composed of nanometer thick regions of different metals, coated with a sol-gel derived energetic material. The favored metals for the multilayers will be main-group and early transition metals such as, but not limited to, boron, aluminum, silicon, titanium, zirconium, and nickel. Candidate sol-gel energetic materials include iron (III) oxide/aluminum nanocomposites. It should be noted that more traditional materials than sol-gel might also be used with the flash metals. The metallic multilayers undergo an exothermic transition to a more stable intermetallic alloy with the appropriate mechanical or thermal stimulus. This exothermic transition has sufficient output energy to initiate the more energy dense sol-gel energetic material, or other candidate materials. All of the proposed initiation mix materials and their reaction by products have low toxicity, are safe to handle and dispose of, and provide much less environmental and health concerns than the current composition. We anticipate that the technology and materials proposed here will be produced successfully in production scale with very competitive costs with existing IIDs, when amortized over the production lifetime. The sol-gel process is well known and used extensively in industry for coatings applications. All of the proposed feedstock components are mass-produced and have relatively low costs. The multilayer deposition equipment is commercially available and the technology is widely used in the coating of semiconductor devices, food storage containers, and reflective windows. In addition, both the sol-gel and multilayer technologies are very versatile. A variety of synthesis and processing variables can be tuned to change material properties such as particle or layer size or thickness, porosity, and composition can lead to materials with different properties. Using these techniques IIDs with optimized sensitivity, energy output, processing, and aging characteristics can be produced that are not as easily accessible using other nanotechnologies, in particular the use of ultra-fine grain powders. This effort attempts to demonstrate that environmentally acceptable energetic sol-gel <b>coated</b> <b>flash</b> metal multilayer nanocomposites can be used to replace current impact initiated devices (IIDs), which have hazardous and toxic components...|$|R
