40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis aims {{to describe}} the basic characteristics and problems related to <b>deprivation</b> <b>syndrome</b> in children, provide educators the information needed for effective orientation in the area, to recognize <b>deprivation</b> <b>syndrome,</b> {{emphasize the importance of}} relationships that go beyond the educational environment and have a societal character and offer tools and mechanisms that lead to effective prevention and possible remedial syndrome. The work is divided into two main sections. The first part defines the basic terms and conditions of <b>deprivation</b> <b>syndrome</b> formation and its symptoms. It refers to the characteristics of resource <b>deprivation</b> <b>syndrome</b> and how it translates into behavior syndrome children. The second part focuses on possibility of prevention and remediation <b>deprivation</b> <b>syndrome.</b> Emphasis is placed on the importance of the interconnectedness of life and many areas of society. Also important is the influence of family coherence and teaching staff to optimize prevention and correction...|$|E

40|$|Elevated {{rates of}} {{attention}} deficit and overactivity {{have been noted}} previously in samples of institution-reared children. This study examined the hypothesis that inattention/overactivity(I/O) might constitute a specific <b>deprivation</b> <b>syndrome.</b> One hundred and sixty five children adopted at varying ages (e. g., 0 – 42 months of age) into the UK following severe early deprivation were compared with 52 within-UK adoptees who did not suffer deprivation. The children were rated by teachers and parents on levels of I/O, conduct difficulties, and emotional difficulties using the Revised Rutter Scales. Data were collected at age 6 {{for the entire sample}} and at age 4 for the UK adoptees and for the subsample of Romanian children who entered the UK before the age of 2 years. Mean level analyses suggested a significant effect of duration of deprivation on I/O, but not on conduct or emotional difficulties. The effects of duration of deprivation were specific to I/O and were not accounted for by low birth weight, malnutrition, or cognitive impairment. Levels of I/O correlated with attachment disturbances. Furthermore, the effects of duration of deprivation on I/O did not attenuate over time. We conclude that I/O may well constitute an institutional <b>deprivation</b> <b>syndrome,</b> but that the type of attention deficit and overactivity exhibited by these children may present a different clinical picture from that of ordinary varieties of attention deficit disorder or hyperkinetic syndrome...|$|E
40|$|In recent decades, {{there has}} been a {{significant}} expansion in our understanding of the role of astrocytes in neuroprotection, including spatial buffering of extracellular ions, secretion of metabolic coenzymes, and synaptic regulation. Astrocytic neuroprotective functions require energy, and therefore require a network of functional mitochondria. Disturbances to astrocytic mitochondrial homeostasis and their ability to produce ATP can negatively impact neural function. Perturbations in astrocyte mitochondrial function may accrue as the result of physiological aging processes or as a consequence of neurotoxicant exposure. Hydrophobic environmental neurotoxicants, such as 1, 3 -dinitrobenzene and a-chlorohydrin, cause regionally specific spongiform lesions mimicking energy <b>deprivation</b> <b>syndromes.</b> Astrocyte involvement includes mitochondrial damage that either precedes or is accompanied by neuronal damage. Similarly, environmental neurotoxicants that are implicated in the etiology of age-related neurodegenerative conditions cause regionally specific damage in the brain. Based on the regioselective nature of age-related neurodegenerative lesions, chemically induced models of regioselective lesions targeting astrocyte mitochondria can provide insight into age-related susceptibilities in astrocyte mitochondria. Most of the available research to date focuses on neuronal damage in cases of age-related neurodegeneration; however, there is a body of evidence that supports a central mechanistic role for astrocyte mitochondria in the expression of neural injury. Regional susceptibility to neuronal damage induced by aging by exposur...|$|R

In the Tupperware party, you have reciprocation, consistency and commitment tendency, and social proof. (The hostess gave {{the party and the}} tendency is to reciprocate; you say you like certain products during the party so purchasing would be consistent with views you've committed to; other people are buying, which is the social proof.) In the open outcry auction, there is social proof of others bidding, reciprocation tendency, commitment to buying the item, and <b>deprivation</b> super-reaction <b>syndrome,</b> i.e. sense of loss. The latter is an individual's sense of loss of what he believe should be or is his. These biases often occur at either conscious or subconscious level, and in both microeconomic and macroeconomic scale.|$|R

However, {{studies have shown}} that students prefer sleep education to be more interactive, and less monotonous. From the literature it was very clear that adolescents were encountering significant challenges due to sleep <b>deprivation,</b> delayed phase <b>syndrome</b> and challenges due to inadequate sleep. Thus, we undertook a study to assess the baseline sleep data and education of the elementary school students to help create healthy sleep habits. We designed and produced a 3 D animated sleep education movie KNIGHTS (Keep Nurturing and Inspiring Good Habits in Teen Sleep) to help create healthy sleep habits.|$|R

40|$|The physical, {{motor and}} psychosocial {{development}} has been studied in early age children (3 - 24 months old) who lack the family environment. Neurologic (N), expressive (E), receptive (R) and cognitive (C) functions are assessed by BINS (Bailey's Infant's Neurodevelopmental Screener). The {{results of the study}} are compared to the developmental indicators of children who grew in families. In the case of <b>deprivation</b> <b>syndrome,</b> in children who lack parent care there is the evidence of delayed physical development with disharmonic type. The indicators of neurological clusters are decreased; expressive and cognitive functions show significant impairment. As the child grows we see the improvement of Neurological and Receptive clusters, but expressive and Cognitive functions show marked depression. There is still the evidence of previously mentioned deviations during the time of two-year monitoring. The results of the study show the significance of the family environment and of the biophysical union between mother and child on the processes of child's development; it also shows the importance of implementation of the multidisciplinary model in institutional houses for the development of children...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: There {{is a need}} {{to better}} {{understand}} the epidemiological relationship between language development and psychiatric symptomatology. Language development can be particularly impacted by social factors-as seen in the developmental choices made for deaf children, which can create language deprivation. A possible mental health syndrome may be present in deaf patients with severe language deprivation. METHODS: Electronic databases were searched to identify publications focusing on language development and mental health in the deaf population. Screening of relevant publications narrowed the search results to 35 publications. RESULTS: Although there is very limited empirical evidence, there appears to be suggestions of a mental health syndrome by clinicians working with deaf patients. Possible features include language dysfluency, fund of knowledge deficits, and disruptions in thinking, mood, and/or behavior. CONCLUSION: The clinical specialty of deaf mental health appears to be struggling with a clinically observed phenomenon {{that has yet to be}} empirically investigated and defined within the DSM. Descriptions of patients within the clinical setting suggest a language <b>deprivation</b> <b>syndrome.</b> Language development experiences have an epidemiological relationship with psychiatric outcomes in deaf people. This requires more empirical attention and has implications for other populations with behavioral health disparities as well...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The present article {{examines}} several lines of converging {{evidence suggesting that}} the slow and insidious brain changes that accumulate over the lifespan, resulting in both natural cognitive aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD), represent a metabolism reduction program. A number of such adaptive programs are known to accompany aging and {{are thought to have}} decreased energy requirements for ancestral hunter-gatherers in their 30 s, 40 s and 50 s. Foraging ability in modern hunter-gatherers declines rapidly, more than a decade before the average terminal age of 55 years. Given this, the human brain would have been a tremendous metabolic liability that must have been advantageously tempered by the early cellular and molecular changes of AD which begin to accumulate in all humans during early adulthood. Before the recent lengthening of life span, individuals in the ancestral environment died well before this metabolism reduction program resulted in clinical AD, thus there was never any selective pressure to keep adaptive changes from progressing to a maladaptive extent. Aging foragers may not have needed the same cognitive capacities as their younger counterparts because of the benefits of accumulated learning and life experience. It is known that during both childhood and adulthood metabolic rate in the brain decreases linearly with age. This trend is thought to reflect the fact that children have more to learn. AD "pathology" may be a natural continuation of this trend. It is characterized by decreasing cerebral metabolism, selective elimination of synapses and reliance on accumulating knowledge (especially implicit and procedural) over raw brain power (working memory). Over decades of subsistence, the behaviors of aging foragers became routinized, their motor movements automated and their expertise ingrained to a point where they no longer necessitated the first-rate working memory they possessed when younger and learning actively. Alzheimer changes selectively and precisely mediate an adaptation to this major life-history transition. AD symptomatology shares close similarities with <b>deprivation</b> <b>syndromes</b> in other animals including the starvation response. Both molecular and anatomical features of AD imitate brain changes that have been conceptualized as adaptive responses to low food availability in mammals and birds. Alzheimer's patients are known to express low overall metabolic rates and are genetically inclined to exhibit physiologically thrifty traits widely thought to allow mammals to subsist under conditions of nutritional scarcity. Additionally, AD is examined here in the contexts of anthropology, comparative neuroscience, evolutionary medicine, expertise, gerontology, neural Darwinism, neuroecology and the thrifty genotype. </p...|$|R
40|$|Leptin is {{a product}} of the obese (OB) gene {{secreted}} by adipocytes in proportion to fat mass.

40|$|This {{final year}} thesis focuses on {{problems}} of children {{growing up in}} children´s homes. In the theoretical part it deals with {{definition of the term}} children´s home and children´s home with school, reasons for placing child in children´s home, purpose and function of family and children´s home. The thesis characterizes family background a child came from to children´s home, it describes <b>deprivation</b> <b>syndrome</b> and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. A part of the thesis addresses Romany children growing up in children´s home and the relation between childhood spent in children´s home and crime committed in adulthood. The last chapter refers to some difficulties of young people leaving institutional upbringing. The practical part contains comparison of composition of children from three chosen institutions (two state and one non-state) Children´s Home with School Horní Planá, Children´s Home Aš and Private Children´s Home Koryto. They are compared especially in spheres described in the theoretical part. Concurrently I obtained basic information about particular children´s homes from senior executive. Also I monitored carers opinions of institutional upbringing and of children´s state of preparation for independent life after leaving children´s home and their attitudes to upbringing children...|$|E
40|$|My {{bachelor}} {{thesis is}} concerned with {{quality of life in}} Children´s homes for children from 10 to 18 years old in Zlín region. In a theoretical part, it deals with a division and characteristics of target group of pubescents and adolescents and describes children's basic needs and needs as such. Moreover, it describes also quality of life, health and circadian rhythms connected to quality of life, institutional care and Children´s home and Children´s home with a school, which fall into institutional care. This thesis briefly mentions a history of Children´s homes and also those in a Zlin region. Furthermore, it focuses on risks of institutional care, <b>deprivation</b> <b>syndrome</b> and also on related subdeprivation. General target of this thesis is to discover quality of life of children living in a Children´s home. Specific target is to discover those children's quality of life in particular fields of quality of life, such as health, satisfaction, and circadian typology. In order to find out data, I used adjusted and translated standardized questionnaire Cummins (1997) ComQoL-S 5 and few questions were selected from circadian typology CIT Harada, Krejčí questionnaire. Considering extensiveness of the questionnaire, only some fields of life were selected for an evaluation, such as health, satisfaction, and circadian typology according to which was quality of life evaluated. Results show that quality of life, concerning health and satisfaction, is the same and positive concerning pubescents and adolescents. Children aged between 10 - 18 evaluate their field of satisfaction as positive. Regarding circadian typology, pubescents incline to an evening type...|$|E
40|$|Aim: Obesity {{is a major}} {{contributor}} to the global burden of disease and is closely associated with the development of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. This study tested the hypothesis that mitochondrial respiratory capacity of the pre-diabetic heart is decreased leading to impaired contractile function and tolerance to ischaemia/reperfusion. Methods: Eight-week-old male Wistar rats were fed a high caloric diet for 16 weeks after which anthropometric, metabolic, cardiac and mitochondrial parameters were evaluated vs. age-matched lean controls. Cardiac function (working heart perfusions) and mitochondrial respiratory capacity were assessed at baseline and in response to acute oxygen deprivation. Results: Rats fed the high caloric diet exhibited increased body weight and visceral fat vs. the control group. Heart weights of obese rats were also increased. Triglyceride, fasting plasma insulin and free fatty acid levels were elevated, while high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were reduced in the obese group. Contractile function was attenuated at baseline and further decreased after subjecting hearts to ischaemia-reperfusion. Myocardial infarct sizes were increased while ADP phosphorylation rates were diminished in obese rats. However, no differences were found for mtDNA levels and the degree of oxidative stress-induced damage. Conclusions: These data show that decreased mitochondrial bioenergetic capacity in pre-diabetic rat hearts may impair respiratory capacity and reduce basal contractile function and tolerance to acute oxygen <b>deprivation.</b> Keywords metabolic <b>syndrome,</b> mitochondrial respiration, myocardial infarction, obesity.

40|$|Acute {{myocardial}} ischemic syndromes {{are apparently}} {{related to the}} underlying pathophysiology leading to the clinical instability. Depending on the completeness and the duration of blood <b>deprivation,</b> different clinical <b>syndromes</b> result, such as sudden death, acute transmural infarction, nontransmural infarction, or unstable angina. Recent clinical, angiographic, and pathologic studies have emphasized the important pathophysiologic link between unstable angina, acute myocardial infarction, and early postinfarction angina. The term unstable angina is used for prolonged episodes of myocardial ischemia at rest {{in the absence of}} detectable myocardial necrosis. However, in the acute situation, when a patient presents with chest pain and electrocardiographic signs of ischemia, the distinction between unstable angina and myocardial infarction is often difficult. The uncertainty of outcome in a specific patient forces one to provide maximal treatment. The prime goal of any intervention in this situation must primarily be the preservation or early restoration of antegrade flow in the ischemia-related artery, in order to resolve myocardial ischemia and to prevent (further) myocardial necrosis, and so to improve both shortand long-term mortality and morbidity. Despite the latest substantial improvements in surgical techniques, cardioplegia, anaesthesia, and postoperative care, there is still no consensus as to the safety of surgery in the management of these subsets of patients. As an attractive alternative to coronary artery bypass surgery, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty would logically {{play an important role in}} the management of patients with acute myocardial ischemic syndromes...|$|R
