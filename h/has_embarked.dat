25|$|The {{government}} of Tanzania <b>has</b> <b>embarked</b> {{on a major}} sector reform process since 2002. An ambitious National Water Sector Development Strategy that promotes integrated water resources management {{and the development of}} urban and rural water supply was adopted in 2006. Decentralisation has meant that responsibility for water and sanitation service provision has shifted to local government authorities and is carried out by 20 urban utilities and about 100 district utilities, as well as by Community Owned Water Supply Organisations in rural areas.|$|E
25|$|The {{challenges}} include {{water scarcity}} {{in the northern}} and central parts of the country; inadequate water service quality (drinking water quality; 11% of Mexicans receiving water only intermittently as of 2014); poor technical and commercial efficiency of most utilities (with an average level of non-revenue water of 43.2% in 2010); an insufficient share of wastewater receiving treatment (36% in 2006); and still inadequate access in rural areas. In addition to on-going investments to expand access, the government <b>has</b> <b>embarked</b> on a large investment program to improve wastewater treatment.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to the national highways, the government <b>has</b> <b>embarked</b> on an expansive reconstruction of spur secondary routes, which connect smaller towns to the trunk routes. In {{the last few years}} the government constructed a 106-kilometer toll road that connects Santo Domingo with the country's northeastern peninsula. Travelers may now arrive in the Samaná Peninsula in less than two hours. Other additions are the reconstruction of the DR-28 (Jarabacoa– Constanza) and DR-12 (Constanza– Bonao). Despite these efforts, many secondary routes still remain either unpaved or in need of maintenance. There is currently a nationwide program to pave these and other commonly used routes. Also, the Santiago light rail system is in planning stages but currently on hold.|$|E

25|$|Since {{the legal}} {{reforms of the}} late 1970s and 1980s, the Communist Party of China (CPC) has officially moved to embrace the {{language}} {{of the rule of law}} and to establish a modern court system. In the process, it has enacted thousands of new laws and regulations, and has begun training more legal professionals. The concept of 'rule of law' has been emphasized in the constitution, and the ruling party <b>has</b> <b>embarked</b> on campaigns to promote the idea that citizens have protection under the law. At the same time, however, a fundamental contradiction exists in the constitution itself, in which the Communist Party insists that its authority supersedes that of the law. Thus, the constitution enshrines the rule of law, yet simultaneously stresses the principle that the 'leadership of the Communist Party' holds primacy over the law.|$|E
25|$|With an {{estimated}} 650,000 {{people living with}} HIV/AIDS and an ever-greater number of people at risk of infection, the government <b>has</b> <b>embarked</b> upon a formidable task. The provision of accessible testing and treatment services not only requires financial resources, but also, in many cases, reorganization and supplementary funding of existing local health services infrastructure, especially in rural areas where most of Chinese HIV-positive individuals reside. In particular, rural areas do not have adequately trained staff capable of providing effective treatment and prevention services, {{as well as the}} laboratory and clinical infrastructure necessary to monitor treatment. The problem of inadequate human resources is not restricted to health departments – in rural areas, there are few adequately trained technical and management personnel at all levels and across all sectors. The combination of insufficiently trained staff, inadequate technical resources, and a largely remote, poorly educated, rural population represents a challenge to the implementation of effective programmes.|$|E
25|$|In Trust, Truth and Traffic, Naomi <b>has</b> <b>embarked</b> on {{her career}} as a free lance event planner, and she has even managed to spot her {{probable}} new client. Naomi is trying her best to convince her possible new client. She is also faced with a problem when TA, Naomi's physics class partner, informs her that she has to pass his physics class, if she wants to pass the sophomore year. It turns out the TA is hurt, as Naomi has never invited him to any of the parties she has thrown in the past year. Later on, Naomi decides to help Liam make Vanessa’s party a success, so she can invite the TA to the party, and score a few brownie points. At the party, Naomi tells TA that she would rather work hard to get good marks on her project, than him favoring her in any way. In No Good Deed, Naomi decides to plan Mitchell Nash's daughters sweet sixteen birthday party, after a previous client told her she would not hire her without her having any professional experiences.|$|E
