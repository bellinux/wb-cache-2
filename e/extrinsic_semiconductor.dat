It is resistant to most aqueous acids, phosphoric acid being an exception. It forms a protective layer of silicon dioxide {{on the surface and}} hence only oxidises appreciably in air above 1000°C; removal of this layer by molten hydroxides or carbonates leads to quick oxidation. Silicon carbide is rapidly attacked by chlorine gas, which forms SiCl4 and carbon at 100°C and SiCl4 and CCl4 at 1000°C. It is mostly used as an abrasive and a refractory materia, as it is chemically stable and very strong, and it fractures to form a very sharp cutting edge. It is also useful as an intrinsic semiconductor, as well as an <b>extrinsic</b> <b>semiconductor</b> upon being doped.

50|$|Semiconductor doping is {{the process}} that changes an {{intrinsic}} semiconductor to an <b>extrinsic</b> <b>semiconductor.</b> During doping, impurity atoms are introduced to an intrinsic semiconductor. Impurity atoms are atoms of a different element than the atoms of the intrinsic semiconductor. Impurity atoms act as either donors or acceptors to the intrinsic semiconductor, changing the electron and hole concentrations of the semiconductor. Impurity atoms are classified as donor or acceptor atoms based on the effect they have on the intrinsic semiconductor.|$|E
50|$|In {{semiconductor}} production, doping is {{the intentional}} introduction of impurities into an intrinsic semiconductor {{for the purpose}} of modulating its electrical properties.

5000|$|An {{extrinsic}} [...] semiconductor is {{one that}} has been doped, that is, into which a doping agent has been introduced, giving it different electrical properties than the intrinsic (pure) semiconductor. This doping involves adding dopant atoms to an intrinsic semiconductor, which changes the electron and hole carrier concentrations of the semiconductor at thermal equilibrium, the temperature at which two adjacent substances exchange no heat energy. Dominant carrier concentrations in an <b>extrinsic</b> <b>semiconductor</b> classify it as either an n-type or p-type semiconductor.

50|$|Wafers {{are formed}} of highly pure (99.9999999% purity), nearly defect-free single {{crystalline}} material. One process for forming crystalline wafers {{is known as}} Czochralski growth invented by the Polish chemist Jan Czochralski. In this process, a cylindrical ingot of high purity mono crystalline semiconductor, such as silicon or germanium, called a boule, is formed by pulling a seed crystal from a 'melt'. Donor impurity atoms, such as boron or phosphorus {{in the case of}} silicon, can be added to the molten intrinsic material in precise amounts in order to dope the crystal, thus changing it into n-type or p-type <b>extrinsic</b> <b>semiconductor.</b>|$|E
50|$|A {{photoelectric}} device {{can be either}} intrinsic or extrinsic. An intrinsic semiconductor has its own charge carriers and is not an efficient semiconductor, for example, silicon. In intrinsic devices the only available electrons are in the valence band, and hence the photon must have enough energy to excite the electron across the entire bandgap. Extrinsic devices have impurities, also called dopants, added whose ground state energy {{is closer to the}} conduction band; since the electrons do not have as far to jump, lower energy photons (that is, longer wavelengths and lower frequencies) are sufficient to trigger the device. If a sample of silicon has some of its atoms replaced by phosphorus atoms (impurities), there will be extra electrons available for conduction. This is an example of an <b>extrinsic</b> <b>semiconductor.</b>|$|E

50|$|The {{addition}} of a dopant to a semiconductor, known as doping, {{has the effect of}} shifting the Fermi levels within the material. This results in a material with predominantly negative (n-type) or positive (p-type) charge carriers depending on the dopant variety.

40|$|This thesis {{will discuss}} the design of PSi {{chemical}} sensors, the enhancement of the sensitivity and selectivity through metal oxide nanostructure depositions, and probe the applications of this technology {{as a tool to}} explore interface interaction dynamics. Using the nanostructure-directed modification of the Lewis acid/base character of an analyte-extrinsic PSi semiconductor interface, we have developed the ability to control the degree of electron transduction between an <b>extrinsic</b> <b>semiconductor</b> interface and interacting analyte gases. Based on {the inversion of the} hard/soft acid/base theory (HSAB), the careful selection of nanostructure directed modifications can enhance or impair electron transduction, which can be made to precisely control the increase or decrease the sensor response to a given analyte. This concept has led creation of a general road map, the Inverse Hard/Soft Acid Base (IHSAB) concept, for sensor design. We have demonstrated that the change in conductometric response allows a more detailed monitoring of the interaction of various materials deposited to an <b>extrinsic</b> <b>semiconductor</b> interface in contrast to standard characterization methods such as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). We are now extending the application of PSi sensors to the identification of organic solvents using impedance spectroscopy. Through the use of an equivalent circuit model, we can explore the physical changes of the PSi sensors with a diversity of distinctly interacting metal oxide nanostructure depositions and upon exposure to various organic solvents. Through mobile PSi sensor device development and formulation of a table cataloging materials' effects on interface interactions, we can create a complete interfacial analysis system with applications as a materials characterization tool, a research project starter, and a classroom demonstration of basic and advanced solid state and condensed matter physics concepts.

40|$|AbstractInvestigation on {{electrical}} conductivity and dielectric properties of manganese (Mn) and vanadium (V) mixed oxides {{were carried out}} to study the <b>extrinsic</b> <b>semiconductor</b> behaviour. The XRD pattern shows that Mn–V oxide is multiphase and quantitative phase analysis was performed to determine the relative phases. Overall results indicate that with increasing temperature, the DC conductivity, AC conductivity, dielectric constant, dielectric loss factor and loss tangent of Mn–V mixed oxide increases. Activation energy of AC conduction decreases with increase in frequency, confirms that the hopping conduction is the dominant mechanism. The activation energy of DC conduction ΔEdc is 0. 54 eV which is greater than ΔEdc. There are three types of dielectric constant spectrum found in the measuring temperature range 30 – 250 °C. This is possibly due to the extrinsic behaviour of the Mn–V oxide. Dielectric relaxation characteristic {{was obtained from the}} spectrum of the imaginary part of electric modulus.

40|$|Nanostructure-decorated n - type {{semiconductor}} interfaces are {{studied in}} order to develop chemical sensing with nanostructured materials. We couple the tenets of acid/base chemistry with the majority charge carriers of an <b>extrinsic</b> <b>semiconductor.</b> Nanostructured islands are deposited in a process that does not require self-assembly {{in order to}} direct a dominant electron-transduction process that forms the basis for reversible chemical sensing in the absence of chemical-bond formation. Gaseous analyte interactions on a metal-oxide-decorated n-type porous silicon interface show a dynamic electron transduction to and from the interface depending upon the relative strength of the gas and metal oxides. The dynamic interaction of NO with TiO 2, SnO 2, NiO, Cu x O, and Au x O (x >> 1), in order of decreasing acidity, demonstrates this effect. Interactions with the metal-oxide-decorated interface can be modified by the in situ nitridation of the oxide nanoparticles, enhancing the basicity of the decorated interface. This process changes the interaction of the interface with the analyte. The observed change to the more basic oxinitrides does not represent a simple increase in surface basicity but appears to involve a change in molecular electronic structure, which is well explained by using the recently developed IHSAB model. The optical pumping of a TiO 2 and TiO 2 &# 8722; x N x decorated interface demonstrates a significant enhancement in the ability to sense NH 3 and NO 2.

40|$|We {{investigate}} consecutive absorption or {{emission of}} photons of the quantum mechanical harmonic oscillator {{as a possible}} source of 1 /f fluctuations. Separating the absorption and emission process, we show that consecutively absorbed or emitted photons give rise to an intermittent stochastic process; thereby fluctuating clusters of photons are intermitted by distinct breaks. Let the number of photons in a cluster be m and the cluster size distribution be pm. We find that the intermittent process with a cluster size distribution pm proportional to m- 2 generates a pure 1 /f spectrum. We show that 1 /f fluctuations are present in thermal equilibrium but average out to zero. As an example we investigate phonons as a possible origin of 1 /f fluctuations in an <b>extrinsic</b> <b>semiconductor.</b> Acoustic phonons always produce {{a change in the}} volume; this affects the donor ionization energy modulating also the g-r process. We calculate the spectrum of such a modulated g-r process; thereby the intermittent character of phonon activity is identified as the origin of 1 /f fluctuations. The Hooge parameter is found to depend on the mean number of phonons comprised in a cluster, on the modulation depth of the g-r process and on a factor which describes the temperature dependence of 1 /f noise.

40|$|We {{present a}} study on spin {{transport}} in semiconductors under applied electric fields. Our experiments detect photoinjected electron spins and their relaxation during drift transport in intrinsic and moderately n-doped GaAs, based on the extraordinary Hall (eH) effect. For relatively low electric field (E), the optically spin-induced eH effect in n-doped GaAs {{is found to be}} enhanced with increasing doping density and not to depend much on E, indicating that a substantial amount of optical spin polarization is preserved during the drift transport in these <b>extrinsic</b> <b>semiconductors.</b> However, when the spin-oriented electrons are injected with a high E, a very significant decrease is observed in the eH voltage (VeH) due to an increase in the spin precession frequency of the hot electrons. Spin relaxation by the D'yakonov-Perel' mechanism is calculated, and is suggested to be the reason for such a rapid spin relaxation for hot electrons under a high E. However, in an intrinsic GaAs (i-GaAs), a much weaker VeH is observed and, as the electron spins scattered by holes due to the Coulomb interaction in i-GaAs, the spin relaxation by the Bir-Aronov-Pikus mechanism is considered. Skew scattering and side jump as possible mechanisms of the optically spin-induced transverse Hall currents are discussed. Based on a spin drift-diffusion model, drift and diffusion contributions to the VeH are examined. The results are also discussed in comparison with theoretical investigations. 頲 008 IOP Publishing Ltd. Griffith Sciences, School of Natural SciencesNo Full Tex...|$|R
