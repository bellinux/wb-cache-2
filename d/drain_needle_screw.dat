40|$|Background: Fine needle {{aspiration}} (FNA) cytology is {{the method}} of choice to exclude malignancy in thyroid nodules. A major limitation of thyroid FNA is the relatively high rate (13 - 17 %) of non-diagnostic samples. The {{aim of this study}} is to determine the diagnostic yield of a <b>screw</b> <b>needle</b> compared to the conventional FNA. Methods: We retrospectively analysed thyroid nodule cytology of all patients that underwent thyroid nodule fine <b>needle</b> or <b>screw</b> <b>needle</b> aspiration between July 2007 and July 2012 in a single academic medical centre. Cytology results were categorized according to the Bethesda classification system. Results: In total, 644 punctures of thyroid nodules from 459 patients were available for analysis. The <b>screw</b> <b>needle</b> was used 531 times, and the conventional fine needle 113 times. The percentage of non-diagnostic cytology was significantly lower in the <b>screw</b> <b>needle</b> samples than in the fine needle samples (3 % vs 17 %, P < 0. 001). Conclusion: This study shows a significantly better diagnostic performance of the <b>screw</b> <b>needle</b> compared to the conventional fine needle in cytology of thyroid nodule...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: Fears {{related to}} {{anesthesia}} have affected {{a considerable number}} of patients going for surgery. The purpose of this survey was to identify the most common concerns about general anesthesia during the preoperative anesthetic clinic in different healthcare settings, and whether they are affected by patients′ sex, age, education, or previous experience of anesthesia or not. Materials and Methods: Structured questionnaires with consent forms were distributed to patients in their preanesthesia clinic visit in three tertiary hospitals (King Abdul-Aziz Medical City, King Faisal Specialist Hospital, and King Khalid University Hospital) in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Patients′ demographics and questions related to their fears regarding general anesthesia were included in the questionnaires. All categorical and interval variables were compared statically using a Chi-square test for independence and a t-test, respectively. All statistical tests were declared significant at α level of 0. 05 or less. Results: Among 450 questionnaires that were disturbed, 400 questionnaires were collected and analyzed. Eighty-eight percent experienced preoperative fear. The top three causes of their fears were fear of postoperative pain (77. 3 %), fear of intraoperative awareness (73. 7 %), and fear of being sleepy postoperatively (69. 5 %). Patients are less fearful of <b>drains</b> and <b>needles</b> in the operative theater (48 %), of revealing personal issues under general anesthesia (55. 2 %), and of not waking up after surgery (56. 4 %). Age and gender were significant predictors of the overall fear among preanesthetic patients. Females are 5 times more likely to experience fear before surgery (P = 0. 0009). Patients aged more than 40 years old are also at 75 % higher risk of being afraid (P = 0. 008). Conclusion: The majority of the patients going for surgery experienced a fear of anesthesia. Mostly females, especially those over 40, were at a higher risk of being afraid. Fear can bring anxiety which, in turn, might affect the patient′s surgery...|$|R

With shotcrete application as a ground support system ever-present in both mining and tunnelling sectors, a major requirement of drive progression is to determine when {{it is safe to}} re-enter beneath freshly {{sprayed concrete}}. Accurately determining this time is of paramount importance. Generally, this re-entry time is based on measuring the developing strength of shotcrete until an adequate strength value is reached. The issue with current practice {{is that there is no}} widely accepted or generally preferred method that accurately assesses the shotcrete lining&# 039;s true early-age strength.

40|$|Abstract Background Drains {{are usually}} left after thyroid surgery to prevent {{formation}} of hematoma and seroma in the thyroid bed. This {{is done to}} reduce complications and hospital stay. Objective evaluation of the amount collected in the thyroid bed by ultrasonography (USG) can help in assessing the role of drains. Methods A randomized prospective control study was conducted on 94 patients undergoing 102 thyroid surgeries, {{over a period of}} fifteen months. Patients included in the study were randomly allocated to drain and non-drain group on the basis of computer generated random number table. The surgeon was informed of the group just before the closure of the wound Postoperatively USG neck was done on first and seventh postoperative day by the same ultrasonologist each time. Any swelling, change in voice, tetany and tingling sensation were also recorded. The data was analyzed using two-sample t-test for calculating unequal variance. Results Both groups were evenly balanced according to age, sex, and size of tumor, type of procedure performed and histopathological diagnosis. There {{was no significant difference in}} collection of thyroid bed assessed by USG on D 1 & D 7 in the two groups (p = 0. 313) but the hospital stay was significantly reduced in the non-drain group (p = 0. 007). One patient in the <b>drain</b> group required <b>needle</b> aspiration for collection in thyroid bed. No patient in either group required re-operation for bleeding or haematoma. Conclusion Routine drainage of thyroid bed following thyroid surgery may not be necessary. Not draining the wound results in lesser morbidity and decreased hospital stay. </p...|$|R
40|$|PurposeWe {{review the}} epidemiology, {{clinical}} presentation, management and outcome of prostatic abscess secondary to Burkholderia pseudomallei {{infection in the}} Northern Territory, Australia. We highlight the frequency of prostatic abscess occurrence in melioidosis, and formulate recommendations for its detection and management. Materials and MethodsWe reviewed a prospective database of all culture confirmed melioidosis cases in the Northern Territory between October 1989 and July 2008. This review was supplemented with data obtained from a review of case notes and postmortem records during the same period. ResultsThere were 514 patients with 561 episodes of melioidosis, and of these patients 394 (70 %) were male. A prostatic abscess was identified, usually by computerized tomography, in 81 (21 %) of these episodes, in 77 patients. In 75 (93 %) of the 81 episodes there was clinical evidence of prostatic infection or positive urine culture for B. pseudomallei. Kava use and hazardous alcohol use were independent predictors of prostatic abscesses compared to male patients without prostatic abscesses. All were treated with antibiotics and in 57 of the 81 episodes the abscesses were <b>drained.</b> Ultrasound guided <b>needle</b> drainage was used in 51 instances and open drainage in 28 (transurethral 13, transrectal 11, transperineal 4). There were 20 patients who underwent multiple procedures while 24 underwent no procedures. ConclusionsProstatic abscess is common in melioidosis. Clinical signs are usually present but may be subtle. Detection is enhanced by routine computerized tomographic screening of the abdomen and pelvis for occult visceral abscesses in all cases of melioidosis. Ultrasound guided needle drainage is adequate initial therapy in conjunction with appropriate antibiotics...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background CT-guided fine needle bioptic {{procedures}} (CTFNP) are characterised by low invasiveness, precise sample collection, a high {{diagnostic efficiency}} and support a rapid diagnostic process. A {{number of different}} fine needles and bioptic procedures are mainly used for tumour diagnostics today. The aim {{of the present study}} was to characterise the most important technical issues of fine needle bioptic procedures. In addition, we directly compared the diagnostic outcome and reliability of the most commonly used Rotex <b>Screw</b> <b>Needle</b> – (RSN) and Yale Needle – (YN) bioptic procedure. Methods In an experimental part of the study, using pig spleen, we measured the maximum number of sampled cells using different needles and aspiration volumes. For the clinical questions we analysed all consecutive 340 patients in which CTFNP were performed between 1 / 97 – 12 / 05 in the hospital Grosshansdorf. We evaluated the number of adverse events based on all clinical available information and compared the cytological findings with the respective final diagnosis (confirmed: clinically n = 192, histologically n = 148). Results Using the YN with at least some negative pressure we found a proportional increase of cell and tissue recovery with increasing number of needle movements. A sensitivity of 78 % and a specificity 98 % indicate a high diagnostic outcome of CTFNP. We found no statistical significant difference in terms of sensitivity (80 vs. 68 %) as well as complication rates (5. 9 vs. 4. 4 %) between RSN or YN. Conclusion As fine needle basically works like a cutting instrument, it is possible to raise the cell/tissue recovery. Keeping this in mind we found a high diagnostic outcome of CTFNP, which was largely independent of needle type and bioptic technique, and comparable with other conventional bioptic procedures. </p...|$|R
