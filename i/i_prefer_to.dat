25|$|I am now {{quite happy}} to be {{breaking}} up. Things getting much too big and uncontrollable. All along we've wanted to keep our hands on everything, so nothing happened that we didn't want to. With international and multi-format/multi-territorial shit, that's proving elusive. <b>I</b> <b>prefer</b> <b>to</b> cut it off rather than have it turn into another Gross Rock Spectacle.|$|E
25|$|My {{painting}} {{does not}} come from the easel. <b>I</b> <b>prefer</b> <b>to</b> tack the unstretched canvas to the hard wall or the floor. I need the resistance of a hard surface. On the floor I am more at ease. I feel nearer, more part of the painting, since this way I can walk around it, work from the four sides and literally be in the painting.|$|E
25|$|But {{my family}} {{acquired}} {{in the time of}} my father a plot of land upper than Mart Moura. It is called Marg el-Dayr and it belonged to the family Mousa. Its conversion into an orchard caused the cleaning of an oratory in decline devoted to Saint Augustine. Would it be rather there the place of celebration of the synod? <b>I</b> <b>prefer</b> <b>to</b> believe it because the place in question is on the border of the famous village of Bqoufa, also ruined, but from which we know that the prelates of the family Rizzi are originated, prelates who led our Church in those times with three successive patriarchs.|$|E

500|$|Ben Bard as Mr. Brun, {{the leader}} of the Palladists, who is {{determined}} to have Jacqueline killed for her transgression of their secrecy rules. He proclaims his convictions to Satan {{at the end of the}} film, asking Jason and Dr. Judd, [...] "Who knows what is wrong or right? If <b>I</b> <b>prefer</b> <b>to</b> believe in Satanic majesty and power, who can deny me? What proof can you bring that good is superior to evil?" ...|$|E
500|$|I'm {{not sure}} how that will play out. The geneticists, if you read their papers, have long been using code words. They sort of dropped the term [...] "race" [...] about 1980 or earlier, and instead you see code words like [...] "population" [...] or [...] "population structure." [...] Now that they're able to define race in genetic terms they tend to use other words, like [...] "continental groups" [...] or [...] "continent of origin," [...] which does, indeed, {{correspond}} to the everyday conception of race. When I'm writing <b>I</b> <b>prefer</b> <b>to</b> use the word race because that's the word that everyone understands. It's a word with baggage, but it's not necessarily a malign word.|$|E
500|$|The {{house is}} a frame structure, covered with white wooden clapboards, {{anchored}} to a stone foundation. The Priestleys built their home out of wood, dried in trenches on the site, because no stone or brick was available in the area. Joseph wrote {{a detailed description of}} the drying process, concluding: [...] "A house constructed with such boards <b>I</b> <b>prefer</b> <b>to</b> one of brick and stone". This may have prompted journalist William Cobbett to caustically label the house a [...] "shed" [...] in one of his political tirades against Joseph. The central section of the house has a slate gable roof with a railing-enclosed deck. The house has [...] "three internal gable end chimneys, one for the main kitchen", and one each at the north and south ends of the central section.|$|E

500|$|Aubrey doesn't {{deny that}} he shoots from the hip, {{in a style}} that can unhinge the fragile egos of show business. [...] "If I was in the tire business," [...] {{reasoned}} Aubrey, [...] "I wouldn't be hurt if the customer didn't buy my tires. I'd think, 'So what?' But in my business, if I don't buy the script, then the writer kicks the dog and beats his wife. So you learn {{to pay attention to}} personal relationships. But that doesn't mean you lie to people. I've been the screwer and the screwee, and I know which is better. It's better to be the screwer, and it's very difficult to do that with honesty, but it's how <b>I</b> <b>prefer</b> <b>to</b> be treated. I don't want power now, or authority, so I suppose my candor can't hurt me.|$|E
500|$|Lem {{was born}} in 1921 into a secular Jewish family in Lwów, interwar Poland (now Lviv, Ukraine). According to his own account, he was {{actually}} born on the 13th of September, but the date was changed to the 12th on his birth certificate because of superstition. He {{was the son of}} Sabina [...] Woller (1892–1979) and Samuel Lem (1879–1954), a wealthy laryngologist and former physician in the Austro-Hungarian Army, and first cousin to Polish poet Marian Hemar (Lem's father and Hemar's mother were brother and sister). In later years Lem sometimes claimed to have been raised Roman Catholic, but he went to Jewish religious lessons during his school years. He later became an atheist [...] "for moral reasons [...] [...] [...] the world appears to me to be put together in such a painful way that <b>I</b> <b>prefer</b> <b>to</b> believe that it was not created [...] [...] [...] intentionally". In later years he would call himself both an [...] "agnostic" [...] and an atheist, ...|$|E
500|$|Thompson {{has also}} criticized a Christian video game {{based on the}} Left Behind series. In , players {{participate}} in [...] "battles raging {{in the streets of}} New York," [...] according to the game's fact sheet. They engage in [...] "physical and spiritual warfare: using the power of prayer to strengthen your troops in combat and wield modern military weaponry throughout the game world." [...] Thompson claims that the makers of the game are sacrificing their values. He said, [...] "Because of the Christian context, somehow it's OK? It's not OK. The context is irrelevant. It's a mass-killing game." [...] Left Behind author Tim LaHaye disagrees, saying [...] "Rather than forbid young people from viewing their favorite pastime, <b>I</b> <b>prefer</b> <b>to</b> give them something that's positive." [...] The dispute over the game has caused Thompson to sever ties with Tyndale House, which publishes both the Left Behind books and Thompson's book, Out of Harm's Way. Thompson has not seen the game, which he says has [...] "personally broken my heart," [...] but claims, [...] "I don't have to meet Abraham Lincoln to know that he was the 16th president of the United States." ...|$|E

500|$|In April 2007, Sakic {{signed on}} for a 19th NHL season with the Colorado Avalanche, signing a one-year deal for 2007–08. Sakic commented on the deal, saying [...] "at this stage in my career, <b>I</b> <b>prefer</b> <b>to</b> do one-year deals as I {{evaluate}} my play year-to-year." [...] Upon signing Sakic to the deal, Avalanche General Manager François Giguère said, [...] "Joe {{is the heart of}} this organization and his leadership and value to this team and especially our young players is unquestioned." [...] On October 7, 2007, he scored a goal and had an assist against the San Jose Sharks, moving past Phil Esposito into eighth place on the NHL career points list with 1,591. Nineteen days later, Sakic scored a goal and assisted Ryan Smyth for an overtime game-winning goal against the Calgary Flames, reaching his 1,600th point in the NHL. On December 27, 2007, it was announced that Sakic underwent hernia surgery to accelerate the recovery of an injury that had forced him to miss the previous 12 games after a 232 consecutive games played streak. The operation caused him to miss a career-high 38 games. He was activated off of the injured reserve on February 24 and played that night, scoring an assist. On March 22, 2008, Sakic recorded his 1,000th career assist against the Edmonton Oilers, becoming the 11th player in NHL history to reach this milestone.|$|E
