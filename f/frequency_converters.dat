25|$|The {{relay network}} opened between 1960 and 1968 {{and covered the}} {{segments}} Oslo–Bergen, the coast from Oslo via Kristiansund, Bergen, Stavanger and Ålesund to Trondheim, and from Oslo via Trondheim north to Kirkenes. NRK had to its disposition four 15-kHz mono analog program channels. The government accelerated construction of transmitters in 1966, and by 1971 seventy-nine {{percent of the population}} had access to television coverage. In 1970 the network consisted of 39 main television transmitters and 266 smaller transmitters and <b>frequency</b> <b>converters.</b> The FM network consisted of 36 main transmitters and 126 smaller transmitters and <b>frequency</b> <b>converters.</b> The investments cost NOK200 million—the increase caused by a combination of inflation and under-budgeting. The operational costs remained at the budgeted levels.|$|E
25|$|Construction of a {{television}} network started with a microwave radio relay in the super high frequency band. The backbone of the system was a two-way 960 telephone channel, a one-way television channel network and additional communications lines in a third channel in Southern Norway. These lines could be rerouted {{if one of the}} relay stations fell out. It was supplemented with a redundant 300 telephone channel network. The relay network largely used the same masts as were used for television transmission, which was why the Telegraphy Administration was chosen instead of NRK. The 1957 plan called for seventy to eighty percent of the population having television coverage within twelve years. This was budgeted to cost NOK70 million, consisting of 28 transmitters and 19 <b>frequency</b> <b>converters.</b> The FM network would be built in parallel, with 37 transmitters and 10 <b>frequency</b> <b>converters.</b>|$|E
25|$|Frequency {{conversion}} {{involves the}} use of transverters that convert the operating frequency of the 802.11b/g device from 2.4GHz to another band entirely. Transverter is a technical term and is rarely used to describe these products which are more commonly known as <b>frequency</b> <b>converters,</b> up/down converters, and just converters. Commercially available converters can convert a 2.4GHz 802.11b/g signal to the 3.4GHz (9cm) band which is not authorized for unlicensed Part 15 users.|$|E
40|$|Abstract:- Voltage to <b>frequency</b> <b>converter</b> (VFC) is an {{oscillator}} whose frequency is linearly {{proportional to}} control voltage. In this paper, the New Synchronous Voltage to <b>Frequency</b> <b>Converter</b> (NSVFC) or "sigma delta " (Σ-Δ) voltage to <b>frequency</b> <b>converter</b> is described. This NSVFC works similarly as conventional SVFC {{but it has}} a better frequency spectral property then other SVFC and therefore it is possible to used in fractional phase locked loop (PLL). More over, the NSVFC has a phase modulation possibility. A experimental NSVFC was constructed and simulated to verify operation of the converter. Analysis and prototype of NSVFC is described.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{a study on}} {{conventional}} voltage to <b>frequency</b> <b>converter</b> is given. A linear voltage to <b>frequency</b> <b>converter</b> is assumed i. e. the output frequency level changes with the varying input voltage level. Then as per the findings of our study a voltage to <b>frequency</b> <b>converter</b> is designed and a physical model of the designed circuit is prepared. A transformer and full wave rectifier are used to reach the optimal dc voltage level while the regulator is used for controlled power supply. An op-Amp based voltage to <b>frequency</b> <b>converter</b> is designed whose output is obtained through a 555 timer. The main operation of the op-Amp is {{to serve as a}} voltage integrator which is necessary for triangular wave generation and also as a comparator for converting the triangular wave into square wave. The timer circuit is operated in monostable mode. A simple and low cost voltage to <b>frequency</b> <b>converter</b> design and its performance analysis is the main objective of this thesis...|$|R
25|$|Due {{to their}} {{relatively}} high capacitance values aluminum electrolytic capacitors have low impedance values even at lower frequencies like mains frequency. They are typically used in power supplies, {{switched-mode power supplies}} and DC-DC converters for smoothing and buffering rectified DC voltages in many electronic devices {{as well as in}} industrial power supplies and <b>frequency</b> <b>converters</b> as DC link capacitors for drives, inverters for photovoltaic, and converters in wind power plants. Special types are used for energy storage, for example in photoflash or strobe applications or for frequency coupling in audio applications.|$|E
25|$|The {{scope of}} {{application}} for DC capacitors is similarly diverse. Smoothing capacitors are used to reduce the AC component of fluctuating DC voltage (such as in power supplies for radio and television transmitters), and for high voltage testing equipment, DC controllers, measurement and control technology and cascaded circuits for generation of high DC voltage. Supporting capacitors, DC-filter or buffer circuit capacitors are used for energy storage in intermediate DC circuits, such as in <b>frequency</b> <b>converters</b> for poly-phase drives, and transistor and thyristor power converters. They {{must be able to}} absorb and release very high currents within short periods, the peak values of currents being substantially greater than the RMS values.|$|E
25|$|Most of the {{terminal}} unit equipment used for receiving RTTY signals was homebuilt, using designs published in amateur radio publications. These original designs {{can be divided into}} two classes of terminal units: audio-type and intermediate <b>frequency</b> <b>converters.</b> The audio-type converters proved to be more popular with amateur radio operators. The Twin City, W2JAV and W2PAT designs were examples of typical terminal units that were used into the middle 1960s. The late 1960s and early 1970s saw the emergence of terminal units designed by W6FFC, such as the TT/L-2, ST-3, ST-5, and ST-6. These designs were first published in RTTY Journal starting in September 1967 and ending in 1970.|$|E

30|$|Multi-rate signal {{processing}} {{is an important}} technique to be discussed. It consists of interpolation and decimation and also the corresponding design of digital filter before extraction or after interpolation. The composition of a digital <b>frequency</b> <b>converter</b> {{is similar to that}} of the analog <b>frequency</b> <b>converter,</b> mainly including the digital mixer, numerical control oscillator (NCO), and the low-pass filter. In comparison, analog <b>frequency</b> <b>converter’s</b> circuit functions are not stable enough and greatly affected by the temperature. However, a digital <b>frequency</b> <b>converter</b> not only can guarantee the orthogonality of IF carrier, but also conveniently modify the frequency interval and other parameters. Besides, the purpose of the sampling rate conversion is to match the rate of data processing, especially in receiver design; the frequency of the received IF signal after certain decimation will be reduced, thereby relieving the stress of subsequent data processing.|$|R
