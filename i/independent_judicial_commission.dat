40|$|In {{order to}} {{strengthen}} the constitutional process of appointment of judges in Superior Courts, Bangladesh established a Supreme Judicial Commission in 2008 by promulgating an Ordinance. This Ordinance was neither promulgated in pursuance of any provisions of the Constitution nor by introducing any amendment to {{the provisions of the}} Constitution. The recommendations of the Commission were not given binding force on the executive. The power of the executive to accept or reject the candidates recommended by the Supreme Judicial Commission at his pleasure defeated the very objective of establishing the Commission for appointing the most competent and suitable persons as judges of the superior courts in Bangladesh. However, following the general elections held on 29 December 2008, the newly elected Government of Bangladesh Awami League dispensed with the Supreme Judicial Commission by not placing the Supreme Judicial Commission Ordinance before the parliament for its approval. This resulted in restoring the previous system of appointing judges on the satisfaction of the executive, which has resulted in patronage appointments. Thus, the establishment of an <b>independent</b> <b>judicial</b> <b>commission</b> in Bangladesh is an imperative necessity for strengthening the independence and impartiality of the judiciary...|$|E

The study was conducted in Jakarta the place of the <b>Judicial</b> <b>Commission</b> as the targeted institution because it focuses in supervising the activities of judges of the Supreme Court and the Constitutional. The type of research is empirical legal research through the three-level approaches of philosophy dogmatic and theoretical laws. The research sample was determined by purposive sampling technique.

Results of the study revealed that the substance of the law governing the authority of the <b>Judicial</b> <b>Commission</b> to supervise the activity of judges is broadly in line with the principle of <b>independent</b> <b>judicial</b> power except the setting of membership composition and procedures of decision making of Honorary Judges. This is potentially affecting the independence of the <b>judicial</b> power. <b>Judicial</b> <b>Commission</b> applies the eclectic model of supervision by combining the model of supervision preventive but not include the recruitment promotion and transfer limited repressive and limited external supervision models external quasi.

40|$|In this paper, I {{focus on}} the {{selection}} of judicial officers using <b>judicial</b> <b>commissions.</b> These <b>judicial</b> <b>commissions</b> are {{also referred to as}} “judicial councils” or “merit commissions,” so {{for the purposes of this}} study, these three terms are synonymous. This paper focuses on Kenya and England because they have taken similar paths to judicial reform. For example, they both added an extra tier to the hierarchical structure and therefore both have a Supreme Court. They both have robust <b>judicial</b> <b>commissions</b> that have changed the selection of judicial officers. However, the <b>judicial</b> <b>commission</b> in Kenya, known as the <b>Judicial</b> Service <b>Commission</b> (hereinafter “JSC”) selects both magistrates and judges who must have had legal training and passed the Kenyan Bar exam. The <b>judicial</b> <b>commission</b> in England, referred to as the <b>Judicial</b> Appointments <b>Commission</b> (hereinafter “JAC”), only selects judges. Though Kenya is a former British colony and part of the Commonwealth, it did not transplant the JAC from England in its reforms. In fact, Kenya’s JSC predates the JAC in England but was re-constituted and strengthened in 2010. Nevertheless, the JSC has a slight resemblance to the JAC. These two countries also demonstrate the success of judicial councils in both a developed and stable democracy as well as in a developing and fragile democracy. The purpose of this study is to compare the contributions to judicial reforms that both <b>judicial</b> <b>commissions</b> have made in their respective countries. The JSC in Kenya has been functioning for two years, having officially started its duties in February 2011. Drawing on lessons from the JAC, the JSC’s performance in its first two years, and lessons from judicial councils globally, I make recommendations that, if implemented, will strengthen the JSC.
