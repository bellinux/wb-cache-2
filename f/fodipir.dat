50|$|Mangafodipir (sold {{under the}} brand name Teslascan as {{mangafodipir}} trisodium) is a contrast agent delivered intravenously to enhance contrast in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the liver. It has two parts, paramagnetic manganese (II) ions and the chelating agent <b>fodipir</b> (dipyridoxyl diphosphate, DPDP). Normal liver tissue absorbs the manganese more than abnormal or cancerous tissue. The manganese shortens the longitudinal relaxation time (T1), making the normal tissue appear brighter in MRIs. This enhanced contrast allows lesions to be more easily identified.|$|E
40|$|Mangafodipir is a {{magnetic}} resonance imaging contrast agent with manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) mimetic activity. The MnSOD mimetic activity protects healthy cells against oxidative stress-induced detrimental effects, e. g., myelosuppressive effects of chemotherapy drugs. The contrast property depends on in vivo dissociation of Mn 2 + from mangafodipir-about 80 % dissociates after injection. The SOD mimetic activity, however, depends on the intact Mn complex. Complexed Mn 2 + is readily excreted in the urine, whereas dissociated Mn 2 + is excreted slowly via the biliary route. Mn is an essential but also a potentially neurotoxic metal. For more frequent therapeutic use, neurotoxicity due to Mn accumulation in the brain may represent a serious problem. Replacement of 4 / 5 of Mn 2 + in mangafodipir with Ca 2 + (resulting in calmangafodipir) stabilizes it from releasing Mn 2 + after administration, which roughly doubles renal excretion of Mn. A considerable part of Mn 2 + release from mangafodipir is governed {{by the presence of}} a limited amount of plasma zinc (Zn 2 +). Zn 2 + has roughly 10 (3) and 10 (9) times higher affinity than Mn 2 + and Ca 2 +, respectively, for <b>fodipir.</b> Replacement of 80 % of Mn 2 + with Ca 2 + is enough for binding a considerable amount of the readily available plasma Zn 2 +, resulting in considerably less Mn 2 + release and retention in the brain and other organs. At equivalent Mn 2 + doses, calmangafodipir was significantly more efficacious than mangafodipir to protect BALB/c mice against myelosuppressive effects of the chemotherapy drug oxaliplatin. Calmangafodipir did not interfere negatively with the antitumor activity of oxaliplatin in CT 26 tumor-bearing syngenic BALB/c mice, contrary calmangafodipir increased the antitumor activity.

40|$|Oxysterols are {{the major}} {{cytotoxic}} components of oxidized low-density lipoprotein (OxLDL) that accumulate in atherosclerotic plaques. Their uptake by macrophages ensue foam cell formation, atherogenesis and plaque progression. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has grown as a modality to track such intra-plaque developments by using intracellular contrast agents. The focus {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effects of two contrast agents; manganese based mangafodipir (TeslascanTM) and iron based super-paramagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPION, ResovistTM) on cell functions and examined their interaction with oxysterol laden cells. Mangafodipir has antioxidant property and provides protection against oxidative stress. The chemical structure of mangafodipir comprises of organic ligand <b>fodipir</b> (Dipyridoxyl diphosphate, Dp-dp) and Mn (manganese). Mangafodipir is readily metabolized within the body to manganese dipyridoxyl ethyldiamine (MnPLED) after an intravenous injection. MnPLED has superoxide dismutase (SOD) mimetic activity, and Dp-dp has iron chelating effects. The second contrast agent tested in this study is ResovistTM. These SPION are primarily ingested by macrophages and accumulated in lysosomes where they are gradually degraded ensuing increased cellular iron. In paper I, we examined whether the above-noted effects of mangafodipir could be utilized to prevent 7 β-hydroxycholesterol (7 βOH) induced cell death. We found that mangafodipir prevents 7 βOH induced cell death by attenuating reactive oxygen species (ROS) and by preserving lysosomal membrane integrity and mitochondrial membrane potential. The second part of this study (paper II) was designed to identify the pharmacologically active part of mangafodipir, which exerts the above-noted effects. We compared the activity of parent compound (mangafodipir) with MnPLED and Dp-dp. We found that mangafodipir; MnPLED and Dp-dp provide similar cyto-protection against 7 βOH induced cell death. These results suggest that MnPLED and Dp-dp both contribute to the pharmacologically active part of mangafodipir. In paper III, we aimed to examine the interaction of SPION with monocytes and macrophages exposed or not to atheroma relevant oxysterols. We demonstrate that SPION loading up-regulates cellular levels of cathepsin and ferritin and induces membranous ferroportin expression. Additionally, SPION incites secretion of ferritin and both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines. Moreover, exposure to oxysterols resulted in a reduced SPION uptake by cells, which may lead to inefficient targeting of such cells. Although SPION uptake was reduced, the ingested amounts significantly up-regulated the expression of 7 βOH induced cathepsin B, cathepsin L and ferritin in cells, which may further aggravate atherogenesis. The fourth part of the study (paper IV) was designed to examine the interaction of SPION with macrophage subtypes and compare the cellular effects of coated and uncoated iron-oxide nanoparticles. We found that iron in SPION induces a phenotypic shift in THP 1 M 2 macrophages towards a macrophage subtype characterized by upregulated intracellular levels of CD 86, ferritin and cathepsin L. Differential levels of these proteins among macrophage subtypes might be important to sustain a functional plasticity. Additionally, uncoated iron-oxide nanoparticles induced dose dependent cell death in macrophages, which elucidates the potential cyto-toxicity of iron in iron-oxide nanoparticles. In conclusion, evidence is provided in this study that intracellular MRI contrast agents have the potential to modulate cell functions. The study reveals a therapeutic potential of mangafodipir, which could be utilized for future development of contrast agents with both diagnostic and curative potentials. Additionally, we found that surface coating in SPION may provide cell tolerance to iron toxicity by modulation of cellular iron metabolism and cell functions. Such alterations in cellular metabolism call for careful monitoring and also highlight new concepts for development of iron containing nanoparticles. A reduced uptake of SPION by atheroma relevant cells justifies development of functionalized SPION to target such cells in atherosclerotic plaques...|$|E
