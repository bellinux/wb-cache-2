2500|$|Installer bits, {{also known}} as bell-hanger bits or fishing bits, are a type of twist drill bit for use with a hand-portable power tool. The key {{distinguishing}} feature of an installer bit is a transverse hole drilled through the web of the bit near the tip. Once the bit has penetrated a wall, a wire can be threaded through the hole and the bit pulled back out, pulling the wire with it. The wire can then be used to pull a cable or pipe back through the wall. This is especially helpful where the wall has a large cavity, where threading a <b>fish</b> <b>tape</b> could be difficult. Some installer bits have a transverse hole drilled at the shank end as well. Once a hole has been drilled, the wire can be threaded through the shank end, the bit released from the chuck, and all pulled forward through the drilled hole. These bits are made for cement, block and brick they are not for drilling into wood. Sinclair Smith of Brooklyn, New York was issued [...] for this invention on January 25, 1898.|$|E
50|$|A <b>fish</b> <b>tape</b> (also {{known as}} a draw wire or draw tape) is a tool used by electricians to route new wiring through walls and {{electrical}} conduit.|$|E
50|$|Made of {{a narrow}} band of spring steel, by careful manipulation, the tape can be guided through {{confined}} spaces such as wall cavities. The goal is to push toward an area where guide string has been dropped inside the confined space and to pull it through, so the guide string can then be used to pull through various types of wiring, such as phone wire, network cables or speaker wire. <b>Fish</b> <b>tape</b> is designed to pull through guide string only. Using it to directly pull the target wire can damage or warp the <b>fish</b> <b>tape.</b>|$|E

50|$|From 1996 to 2000, {{musician}} Tobacco, {{along with}} other musicians, worked on and recorded songs for the Allegheny White <b>Fish</b> <b>Tapes.</b> When Power Pill Fist (who is no longer active with the band) joined, a side project called satanstompingcaterpillars was born and became active from 2000 to 2002. Under satanstompingcaterpillars, the members self-released their music on different labels, including Fuckeroo and Side 8. After their third album, The Most Wonderfulest Thing in 2002, the musicians, now a band, added three members, Father Hummingbird, The Seven Fields of Aphelion and Iffernaut. They changed their name to form Black Moth Super Rainbow (BMSR) in 2003. Tobacco and BMSR are both active today.|$|R
5000|$|Tobacco has {{released}} several albums, including Fucked Up Friends. In 2009, Tobacco released The Allegheny White <b>Fish</b> <b>Tapes,</b> {{a collection of}} mixtapes and limited CDs from pre-BMSR. On May 25, 2010, Tobacco released the second solo album Maniac Meat. It features vocals from Beck on two tracks, [...] "Fresh Hex" [...] and [...] "Grape Aerosmith." [...] The Seven Fields of Aphelion was the third member from Black Moth Super Rainbow to release a solo project. Her debut solo album Periphery was released on Graveface in February 2010.

50|$|Occasionally, two fish {{tapes are}} used from {{opposite}} ends of the wall. Because they each have a hooked end, one <b>fish</b> <b>tape</b> is capable of catching the other, and the one tape can then be pulled back, carrying the second tape out with it. Electricians sometimes attach a battery and a doorbell or buzzer to two fish tapes so that when the ends of the tapes make contact with each other (within the wall), the bell rings.|$|E
50|$|Fish {{tapes are}} usually stored coiled on a plastic reel. Because of this, {{they have a}} natural {{curvature}} {{and it is this}} curvature that allows them to be guided. By manipulating the reel, the end of the tape can be directed slightly. The tape is rigid enough that it can then be pushed in the direction in which it is pointing. In this way it can be easily guided through an empty wall cavity. Thermal insulation, firestops, pipes, HVAC ducts, electrical conduits, and other obstructions make use of a <b>fish</b> <b>tape</b> more challenging.|$|E

40|$|Fishing {{has always}} been an {{important}} activity for those Venetians who live near the Lagoon, and it still enjoys an important economic and social role in the region. Over the last few years, however, the fishing industry has been subject to a profound transformation both in the reduction of the variety and the abundance of the species found in the lagoon, and in the change from a complex and well-structured type of activity to one which has become monospecialist, that is based principally on the fishing of the bivalve Tapes philippinarum (Adam & Reeve). The widespread diffusion of this bivalve and its considerable commercial value have resulted in an increased harvest, initially carried out by hand but now by more sophisticated methods which are capable of obtaining much higher yields. The social, economic and environmental problems resulting from this automated fishing have stimulated research into alternative strategies to manage the alieutic resources of the lagoon which will allow fishing to become a sustainable activity without inflicting long-term environmental damage. This present work will try and prepare the foundations for a system of eco-compatible management, based on an analysis of the functioning of the lagoon 9 ̆ 2 s eco-system, defined as a paralic model, the observation of the traditional forms of fishing practiced over the centuries, a technical analysis of the present typology of lagoon fishing (fishing with fyke nets, 9 ̆ 3 vallicoltura 9 ̆ 4 and fishing of fish fry for rearing, clam <b>fishing</b> (<b>Tapes</b> philippinarum), mussel culture) with particular reference to the species fished, the distribution of the activity throughout the year and the technology employed, to the productivity of the various fishing methods...|$|R
50|$|Sayle's {{early work}} {{included}} several performances for Capital London. In 1979 {{he wrote and}} performed the radio series, Alexei Sayle and the Fish People, for which he won a Pye Radio Award (later known as the Sony Radio Awards). Sayle later released an album based on the show - The <b>Fish</b> People <b>Tapes.</b> This was followed by Alexei Sayle and the Dutch Lieutenant's Trousers in 1980 - the name being a reference to John Fowles' book. He has since contributed to many other radio shows, including writing the five-part sitcom series, Sorry About Last Night (1999), in which he also played the leading role. On 3 November 2006 he presented Chopwell Soviet, a 30-minute programme on BBC Radio 4 that reviewed the Chopwell miners 80 years after the village of Chopwell became known as Little Moscow. Sayle returned to Radio 4 in 2016 with Alexei Sayle's Imaginary Sandwich Bar.|$|R
30|$|The Arctic {{region is}} also {{affected}} by {{the problem of the}} pollution. Despite the fact that Spitsbergen is located far away from the closet settlements, the coast is not free from human’s influence. Among the large amounts of foreign material, mostly wood, glass and plastic bottles, tins, bulbs, pieces of clothes, bags, pieces of plastic <b>tape,</b> <b>fishing</b> nets and ropes were found (Czubla 1994). The continuously growing global production of plastic has a big influence for this virgin territory. The plastic ingestion has been documented in over 100 species of seabird (Trevail et al. 2015).|$|R
50|$|Not {{long after}} I first met Philip Belt, I <b>fished</b> out a <b>tape</b> {{he had given}} me and popped it into my {{dashboard}} cassette player. It was a recording of acclaimed pianist Malcolm Bilson performing the majestic Mozart piano concerto No. 13 in C Major (K. 415) on one of Belt's fortepianos. The sound seemed extraordinarily bright. Toward {{the end of the}} opening allegro, for instance, the notes in the cadenza come in dazzling torrents. Yet, despite the speed with which Bilson played, every note was clear and distinct. To feel the difference, I dusted off an old LP of the same piece, record by another world-famous performer on a modern concert grand. The playing was beautiful but, compared to the fortepiano, the sound seems almost muted, the rapid passages of the allegro slurred. It was like listening to Bilson's version with earmuffs on.|$|R
40|$|Large {{predatory fish}} that alter the {{behaviour}} of smaller species may affect visual estimates of abundance by making organisms {{more or less}} difficult to observe and quantify. To evaluate the non-consumptive influence of large predators on rocky reef fishes observed with Baited Remote Underwater Video (BRUV), we tested the hypothesis that fish assemblages monitored when large (ca 1. 5 m) piscivorous sharks, Mustelus antarcticus, were present differ from those observed when sharks were absent. We did this in two ways using recordings from rocky reefs in Batemans Marine Park, NSW, Australia. First, we examined 6 min of each 30 min tape; 3 min when sharks were present and 3 min when they were absent, in a paired sample design from 17 sites. Second, we compared fish assemblages for complete tapes (30 min) at sites with sharks present compared to sites where they were absent. The diversity and total abundance of fishes was consistently lower {{in the presence of}} sharks; we detected significant assemblage-wide change (PERMANOVA, P[*] 3 ̆c[*] 0. 05). Importantly, the diversity and total abundance of <b>fishes</b> for complete <b>tapes</b> (30 min) decreased in the presence of sharks by 18...|$|R
40|$|Newfie nUncle Harry's Bar Band a poor mix of "Newfie" and "country" By BOB HALLETT 'A {{couple of}} months ago I heard an {{interview}} on OZ-FM with a musician from the province's west coast. The man's group was doing quite well in the clubs, and he told the d. j. it was because the "crowds really like to hear that country and Newfie music". In his mind the word 'Newfie' had replaced the term 'western' that usually is associated with country music. The only difference be- tween 'country' and 'Newfie' music was the use of the 'Newfie' tunes of a bit of accordion. Released during the summer, their <b>tape</b> <b>Fish</b> or no Fish reveals a lot about what is good about this new style of music, but also reveals a lot that is not so good. On the face of things this tape is really not all that bad. The mix of guitar, accordion, bass and man- dolin works quite well, and some of the singing is O. K. too. The original tunes didn't do much for me, but they were as good as any- thing put out by their cohorts in their chosen style. Though this is usually a strong point on this sort of tape for some reason, the band's this tape becomes clear. Everyth- ing seems to work; when the band isn't singing, their musical prowess is second to none. Unfortunately they play all these jigs in a stand- ard country & western two-step. Despite some fine accordion play- ing, the jigs end up sounding like they were arranged by a marching band. A fast mandolin tune works quite well, but it is more of a bluegrass tune then anything else. Thus it has no problem fitting into the rigid confines of a country & western beat.
