5|$|The forward {{exchange}} rate (also referred to as forward rate or forward price) is the exchange rate at which a bank agrees to exchange one currency for another at a future date when it enters into a forward contract with an investor. Multinational corporations, banks, and other financial institutions enter into forward contracts {{to take advantage of}} the forward rate for hedging purposes. The {{forward exchange}} rate is determined by a parity relationship among the spot exchange rate and differences in interest rates between two countries, which reflects an economic equilibrium in the foreign exchange market under which arbitrage opportunities are eliminated. When in equilibrium, and when interest rates vary across two countries, the parity condition implies that the forward rate includes a premium or discount reflecting the <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>differential.</b> Forward exchange rates have important theoretical implications for forecasting future spot exchange rates. Financial economists have put forth a hypothesis that the forward rate accurately predicts the future spot rate, for which empirical evidence is mixed.|$|E

40|$|The {{currency}} {{carry trade}} is the investment strategy that involves selling low <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> currencies {{in order to}} purchase higher <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> currencies, thus profiting from the <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>differentials.</b> This is a well known financial puzzle to explain, since assuming foreign exchange risk is uninhibited and the markets have rational risk-neutral investors, then one would not expect profits from such strategies. That is uncovered <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> parity (UIP), the parity condition in which exposure to foreign exchange risk, with unanticipated changes in exchange rates, should result in an outcome that changes in the exchange rate should offset the potential to profit from such <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>differentials.</b> The two primary assumptions required for <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> parity are related to capital mobility and perfect substitutability of domestic and foreign assets. Given foreign exchange market equilibrium, the <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> parity condition implies that the expected return on domestic assets will equal the exchange rate-adjusted expected return on foreign currency assets. However, {{it has been shown}} empirically, that investors can actually earn arbitrage profits by borrowing in a country with a lower <b>interest</b> <b>rate,</b> exchanging for foreign currency, and investing in a foreign country with a higher <b>interest</b> <b>rate,</b> whilst allowing for any losses (or gains) from exchanging back to their domestic currency at maturity. Therefore trading strategies that aim to exploit the <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>differentials</b> can be profitable on average. The intention of this paper is therefore to reinterpret the currency carry trade puzzle in light of heavy tailed marginal models coupled with multivariate tail dependence features in the analysis of the risk-reward for the currency portfolios with high <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>differentials</b> and low <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>differentials...</b>|$|R

50|$|Covered {{interest}} arbitrage is an arbitrage trading strategy whereby an investor capitalizes on the <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>differential</b> between two countries {{by using a}} forward contract to cover (eliminate exposure to) exchange rate risk. Using forward contracts enables arbitrageurs such as individual investors or banks {{to make use of}} the forward premium (or discount) to earn a riskless profit from discrepancies between two countries' interest rates. The opportunity to earn riskless profits arises from the reality that the interest rate parity condition does not constantly hold. When spot and forward exchange rate markets are not in a state of equilibrium, investors will no longer be indifferent among the available interest rates in two countries and will invest in whichever currency offers a higher rate of return. Economists have discovered various factors which affect the occurrence of deviations from covered interest rate parity and the fleeting nature of covered {{interest arbitrage}} opportunities, such as differing characteristics of assets, varying frequencies of time series data, and the transaction costs associated with arbitrage trading strategies.|$|E
50|$|Uncovered {{interest}} arbitrage is an arbitrage trading strategy whereby an investor capitalizes on the <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>differential</b> between two countries. Unlike covered {{interest arbitrage}}, uncovered interest arbitrage involves no hedging {{of foreign exchange}} risk {{with the use of}} forward contracts or any other contract. The strategy involves risk, as an investor exposed to exchange rate fluctuations is speculating that exchange rates will remain favorable enough for arbitrage to be profitable. The opportunity to earn profits arises from the reality that the uncovered interest rate parity condition does not constantly hold - that is, the interest rate on investments in one country's currency does not always equal the interest rate on foreign-currency investments plus the rate of appreciation that is expected for the foreign currency relative to the domestic currency. When a discrepancy between these occurs, investors who are willing to take on risk will not be indifferent between the two possible locations of investment, and will invest in whichever currency is expected to offer a higher rate of return including currency exchange gains or losses (perhaps adjusted for a risk premium).|$|E
