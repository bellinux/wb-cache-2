25|$|August 12 - Russian President Medvedev {{said that}} he had ordered an end to {{military}} operations in Georgia. However, Russian air raids did not stop in Georgia. Russian troops drove through Poti and took up positions around it. After an end to hostilities was announced, Gori was shelled by artillery for the first time. A <b>fragmentation</b> <b>shell</b> exploded at a press center, which killed a Dutch journalist and also damaged the neighbouring buildings and lone open shop. Abkhaz forces captured the Kodori Valley, from which Georgian military and civilians had fled. French President Nicolas Sarkozy mediated a ceasefire plan between Russia and Georgia, which included provision to withdraw all troops to the lines they held before the war broke out.|$|E
500|$|Körös {{was armed}} with two single gun turrets of /L35 fore and aft, two superfiring /L42 {{anti-aircraft}} guns protected by gun shields on the superstructure fore and aft, and two machine guns. Her main guns fired a [...] armour-piercing, high explosive, shrapnel or <b>fragmentation</b> <b>shell</b> {{to a maximum}} range of [...] at an elevation of 20°. They could depress to −6° and elevate to +25°. Her armour consisted of a belt and bulkheads [...] thick, deck armour [...] thick, and conning tower and gun turret armour [...] thick. The armour was produced by the Witkowitz steel works, in Moravia. She was launched on 5 February 1892 and commissioned on 21 April of the same year.

2500|$|After {{an end to}} {{hostilities}} was announced, Gori was shelled by the Russian artillery for {{the first}} time. A <b>fragmentation</b> <b>shell</b> exploded at a press center, which killed Dutch journalist and also damaged the neighboring buildings and lone open shop. The main square of the town, where a town hall and apartment buildings were situated, was also shelled. Six people were reportedly killed in {{the periphery of the}} town by shelling. The Daily Telegraph reported, [...] "Over half an hour after Mr Medvedev gave his ceasefire order, The Daily Telegraph saw three Russian helicopters fire nine missiles at targets 25 miles north of Tbilisi." [...] A Dutch television, RTL, reported {{on the same day that}} Russian bombing had killed at least five people, including Dutch cameraman. Sky News Russia journalist reported that all the windows of the buildings were broken in the main square of Gori. Spokesman for Russian Foreign Ministry Boris Malakhov claimed that Russia had not attacked civilians. Later, Sky News was told by the acting Georgian ambassador to the UK that civilians targets were being bombed by Russia. The ambassador said that Russian accusation of Georgian [...] "war crimes" [...] was a smokescreen. Russian defence ministry denied the reports of non-cessation of hostilities and called them [...] "provocations".|$|E
2500|$|The cargo {{included}} 4,200,000 {{rounds of}} Remington [...]303 rifle/machine-gun cartridges, 1,250 cases of empty [...] <b>fragmentation</b> <b>shell</b> casings and eighteen cases of percussion fuses, {{all of which}} were listed on the ship's two-page manifest, filed with US Customs after she departed New York on 1 May. However, these munitions were classed as small arms ammunition, were non-explosive in bulk, and were clearly marked as such. It was perfectly legal under American shipping regulations for the liner to carry these; experts agreed they were not to blame for the second explosion. Allegations the ship was carrying more controversial cargo, such as fine aluminium powder, concealed as cheese on her cargo manifests, or guncotton (pyroxylene) disguised as casks of beef, have never been proven. [...] In the 1960s, American diver John Light did several dives on the wreck, trying to prove the existence of contraband explosives in Lusitania 's cargo hold, ignited by the torpedo. Light claimed to have found a large hole on Lusitania 's port side, opposite of where the torpedo had struck, though later expeditions disproved his findings. Recent expeditions to the wreck have shown that her cargo holds remain intact and show no evidence of an internal explosion.|$|E

5000|$|VOF39 with OF-29 <b>fragmentation</b> <b>shell.</b> This shell weighs 46 kg and {{contains}} 6.73 kg of Hexal (A-IX-2).|$|E
50|$|The main shell {{employed}} by the D-50/D-1 was the 53-OF-530 High Explosive <b>Fragmentation</b> <b>shell,</b> capable of being detonated by the RGM, RGM-2 or the D-1 fuses. The shells had a muzzle velocity of 508 meters per second with a maximum range of 12.39 km. The 53-OF-530 had 5.83 kg of TNT as payload. When equipped with a contact fuse, it was capable of a 2100-square-meter area denial, {{and was able to}} create a crater up to 1.2 m deep and up to 3.5 m in diameter. For greater effect the 53-O-530A was used with RGM-2 or D-1-U fuses, or the 53-OF-530R High Explosive <b>Fragmentation</b> <b>shell</b> and the 3OF9, armed with AR-26 and AR-30 radio-controlled fuses.|$|E

50|$|Initially, {{there were}} no special sea target <b>shells,</b> instead, regular <b>fragmentation</b> <b>shells</b> were used with timed, {{immediate}} and delayed fuses for differences in desired effect. A first attempt to develop sea target shells failed in the 1980s, with the company going bankrupt. A fresh start {{was done in the}} beginning of the 1990s for payload shells similar to some anti-tank shells.|$|R
50|$|The Panzer IV was {{intended}} to carry a gun {{that could be used}} in support of infantry or other tanks, and was initially armed with a short-barreled 75 mm howitzer to fire high explosive (HE) <b>fragmentation</b> <b>shells.</b> In 1941 an average of 39 Panzer IV models tanks per month were built, and this rose to 83 in 1942, 252 in 1943, and 300 in 1944.|$|R
50|$|The APHE shell {{itself was}} of the 1890s Hotchkiss naval type {{consisting}} of a hard-nosed forged-steel projectile with a base-mounted inertial deceleration shock-delay fuse with a stable explosive filler, most likely Picric Acid. APHE shells are more effective against battlefield sandbag, earthwork or log improvised fortifications and domestic buildings than equivalent-calibre impact detonating HE or <b>fragmentation</b> <b>shells.</b> APHE {{can be regarded as}} a useful dual-purpose round in many respects.|$|R
50|$|It was a {{light and}} compact gun which could be easily moved by its crew. The {{drawbacks}} were a lack of suspension, weak <b>fragmentation</b> <b>shell</b> (because of small caliber) and poor manufacturing quality. RKKA wanted a larger-caliber gun {{that could be used}} as a battalion gun as well as in an anti-tank role, so the 1-K was quickly replaced in production by its 45 mm descendants.|$|E
50|$|These {{guns were}} used from 1942 {{until the end}} of World War II. In 1943, due to its {{insufficient}} anti-armor capabilities against new German tanks such as Tiger, Panther and Panzer IV Ausf H, the M-42 was partially replaced in mass production by more powerful 57 mm ZiS-2 anti-tank gun. The M-42 remained in production however, as it was quite effective against lighter vehicles and could pierce the side armour of Panther and Panzer IV Ausf H. <b>Fragmentation</b> <b>shell</b> and canister shot gave the gun some anti-personnel capability.|$|E
50|$|Concomitantly {{with the}} gun design, a new {{cartridge}} was developed using the standard 45 mm <b>fragmentation</b> <b>shell</b> of the 21-K anti-aircraft gun. (This projectile had a tracer that burned for eleven seconds and was fitted with the MG-8 contact fuse.) The total length of the new cartridge {{was limited to the}} same value as for the NS-37 ammunition—328mm. In order to accommodate the larger shell, the case body (brass) was necked up and also slightly reduced in length from 195 mm of the NS-37 ammunition to 185 mm. The resulting 45 mm cartridge weighted 1.93 kg, of which 1.065 kg was the weight of its shell. The muzzle velocity of the NS-45 was 780 m/s and its rate of fire was around 260-280 rounds per minute.|$|E
50|$|The howitzers use a cased {{variable}} charge separate-loading propellant system. The Soviet type ammunition {{is usually}} transported as complete {{in a wooden}} box. The weight of the projectile is 43 kg (with a 6 kg explosive charge), {{and the weight of}} the largest propellant charge is 8 kg. The guns can fire high-explosive <b>fragmentation</b> <b>shells,</b> which have a muzzle velocity of about 650 m/s and an effective radius of 50-150 meters.|$|R
2500|$|During repairs after Operation Tungsten, the 38cm SK C/34 naval guns of the [...] Tirpitz were {{modified}} {{to allow their}} use against aircraft, being supplied with specially-fuzed 38cm shells for barrage antiaircraft fire, {{in a manner similar}} to the Japanese San Shiki [...] "Beehive" [...] shells fired by the Yamato-class and other battleships. Tirpitz fired her main battery against Royal Navy Fleet Air Arm aircraft in Operations Planet, Brawn, Tiger Claw, Mascot and Goodwood. In Operations Paravane, Obviate, and Catechism, Tirpitzs 38cm <b>fragmentation</b> <b>shells</b> proved ineffective in countering the Royal Air Force's high-level bombers.|$|R
50|$|The {{maximum range}} with high-explosive <b>fragmentation</b> <b>shells</b> is 25 {{kilometers}} and with special sea target shells {{it is over}} 30 km. The initial velocity of the shot is around 860 m/s depending on the shell and amount of propellant used. When firing temporary bursts with auto-loader the gun can fire 3 shots in 20 seconds and up to 6 shots per minute during sustained firing. The gun weighs 16 tons (including shield) {{and the length of}} the barrel is 6 818 mm. The gun is manned by 3 NCOs and 7 servicemen.|$|R
50|$|Körös {{was armed}} with two single gun turrets of 120 mm/L35 fore and aft, two superfiring 66 mm/L42 {{anti-aircraft}} guns protected by gun shields on the superstructure fore and aft, and two machine guns.

50|$|The K-series was {{an entirely}} new design by the Škoda Works company of Czechoslovakia. Although the exact {{development}} schedule is unknown, the first contract to deliver 12 artillery pieces was signed with the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in 1928. The howitzers were locally designated as M.28. In October 1929, the Polish delegation has also evaluated design. The contract to deliver 27 artillery pieces to Poland was signed in 1933, with actual deliveries happening in 1934-1935 period. At least 14 Škoda 220 mm howitzers were captured by German forces from Poland in September 1939 and designated 22 cm Mörser 538(p). Also, some howitzers were captured in April 1941 from Kingdom of Yugoslavia and designated 22 cm Mörser 538(j). Finally, 7 howitzers were captured by Soviet Union from Poland and were re-used against Finland during the Winter War. Army of Czechoslovakia has also considered adopting gun, but the plans were abandoned. The <b>fragmentation</b> (anti-personnel) <b>shell</b> for howitzer was developed in Poland by June 1939, and at least 60 <b>fragmentation</b> <b>shells</b> were produced under German occupation.|$|R
50|$|Ammunition {{consisted}} of 320 armour-piercing, fragmentation incendiary and fragmentation rounds (all with tracers). 130 rounds were in 5-round clips and 190 rounds were loose without clips. Armour-piercing composite rounds {{could be used}} against enemy heavy tanks. Muzzle velocity was between 890 and 920 m/s depending on projectile type, the armour-piercing shell weighed 0.785 kg, <b>fragmentation</b> <b>shells</b> weighed 0.732 kg. The autocannon could be depressed and elevated manually between -5° and +85°. Cyclic rate of fire was 120 to 130 rounds per minute while the practical rate of fire was about 50 to 60 rounds per minute. Maximum combat vertical fire was 2,500 m while the maximum vertical range was 6,500 m.|$|R
50|$|On {{the night}} of 22-23 May 1915, Albion beached on a {{sandbank}} off Gaba Tepe and {{came under heavy fire}} from Ottoman shore batteries. About 200 <b>fragmentation</b> <b>shells</b> hit her, but they could not penetrate her armor and did no serious damage, and Albion suffered fewer than a dozen casualties. After efforts were made to free her by reducing her weight and by using the recoil of firing her main guns simultaneously, her sister ship Canopus towed her to safety on 24 May 1915, Albion still firing at the Ottoman forts while being towed clear. Albion left the area for repairs on 26 May 1915 and underwent a refit at Malta in May-June 1915.|$|R
5000|$|To {{protect the}} {{approaching}} convoy from attack by CAF aircraft, Yamamoto sent two battleships from Truk to bombard Henderson Field. At 01:33 on 14 October, [...] and , escorted by one light cruiser and nine destroyers, reached Guadalcanal {{and opened fire}} on Henderson Field {{from a distance of}} 16000 m. Over the next one hour and 23 minutes, the two battleships fired 973 14 in shells into the Lunga perimeter, most of them falling in and around the 2200 m square area of the airfield. Many of the <b>shells</b> were <b>fragmentation</b> <b>shells,</b> specifically designed to destroy land targets. The bombardment heavily damaged both runways, burned almost all of the available aviation fuel, destroyed 48 of the CAF's 90 aircraft, and killed 41 men, including six CAF pilots. The battleship force immediately returned to Truk.|$|R
25|$|Finland {{captured}} several 130mm/50 B13 guns {{during the}} Battle of Hanko. The captured guns were known in Finland as 130/50 N or 130 mm 50 kaliiperin merikanuuna mallia N (130 mm 50 caliber coastal gun model N). Soviet Union had four batteries of B-13 guns in Hanko, {{but they were}} damaged or blown up when the Russians evacuated Hanko. Valtion Tykkitehdas (State Artillery Factory) and Helsinki Naval Base ordance personnel succeeded in repairing five guns. Only a few hundred rounds of ammunition were captured, so Finns began manufacturing suitable ammunition domestically. Captured Russian ammunition included modern high explosive <b>fragmentation</b> <b>shells</b> with point and base fuzes and semi-armour piercing shells, while the Finnish produced ammunition were older style high explosive shells. Three captured guns were used for {{short periods of time}} in Pihlajasaari and Miessaari forts by Uusimaa Coastal Brigade. Two guns were used to arm the auxiliary gunboats Aunus and Viena.|$|R
5000|$|After {{the defeat}} in the Battle for Henderson Field, the IJA planned to try again to retake the {{airfield}} in November 1942, but further reinforcements were needed before the operation could proceed. The IJA requested assistance from Yamamoto to deliver the needed reinforcements to the island and to support the next offensive. Yamamoto provided 11 large transport ships to carry the remaining 7,000 troops from the 38th Infantry Division, their ammunition, food, and heavy equipment from Rabaul to Guadalcanal. He also provided a warship support force that included two battleships. The two battleships, [...] and , equipped with special <b>fragmentation</b> <b>shells,</b> were to bombard Henderson Field {{on the night of}} 12-13 November and destroy it and the aircraft stationed there in order to allow the slow, heavy transports to reach Guadalcanal and unload safely the next day.

25|$|Trenches, machine guns, air reconnaissance, barbed wire, {{and modern}} {{artillery}} with <b>fragmentation</b> <b>shells</b> helped bring {{the battle lines}} of World War I to a stalemate. The British and the French sought a solution {{with the creation of}} the tank and mechanised warfare. The British first tanks were used during the Battle of the Somme on 15 September 1916. Mechanical reliability was an issue, but the experiment proved its worth. Within a year, the British were fielding tanks by the hundreds, and they showed their potential during the Battle of Cambrai in November 1917, by breaking the Hindenburg Line, while combined arms teams captured 8,000 enemy soldiers and 100guns. Meanwhile, the French introduced the first tanks with a rotating turret, the Renault FT, which became a decisive tool of the victory. The conflict also saw the introduction of light automatic weapons and submachine guns, such as the Lewis Gun, the Browning automatic rifle, and the Bergmann MP18.|$|R
