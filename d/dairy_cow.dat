5|$|The {{breeding}} of farm animals seldom occurs spontaneously but is managed by farmers {{with a view}} to encouraging certain traits that are seen as desirable. These include hardiness, prolificness, mothering abilities, fast growth rates, low feed consumption per unit of growth, better body proportions, higher yields, better fibre qualities and other characteristics. Undesirable traits such as health defects, aggressiveness or lack of docility are selected against. Selective breeding has been responsible for some large increases in productivity. In 2007, a typical broiler chicken at eight weeks old was 4.8 times as heavy as a bird of similar age in 1957. In the thirty years to 2007, the average milk yield of a <b>dairy</b> <b>cow</b> in the United States nearly doubled.|$|E

The aim of the thesis is to evaluate the most common causes, which lead to discarding of <b>dairy</b> <b>cows</b> from breeding in collective farm Trhový Štěpánov a. s. In this thesis were evaluated the results for 294 <b>dairy</b> <b>cows</b> in 2010. The underlying data were obtained from Dairyplan programm on the farm in Trhový Štěpánov, from economic analysis of ZD Trhový Štěpánov a. s. between 2008 and 2010 and from the annual report for each year. In 2010 there were discarded 294 <b>dairy</b> <b>cows</b> from total 864 pieces, that means 34 % of total number. Among causes of discarding of <b>dairy</b> <b>cows</b> belong low productivity, other zootechnical reasons, udder desease, fertility disorders, difficult births and other health reasons. The most <b>dairy</b> <b>cows</b> were discarded for other health reasons. To other health reasons belong liver desease, displacement of abomasum, paratuberculosis and bad condition of limbs. For these reasons it was discarded more than 57 % of <b>dairy</b> <b>cows.</b> The second most common reason was the fertility disorder with less than 16 % of <b>dairy</b> <b>cows</b> and the least of <b>dairy</b> <b>cows</b> were discarded for the bad condition of udder and the other zootechnical reasons.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{evaluation}} of selected influences on the milk production and fertility of <b>dairy</b> <b>cows</b> in a herd of Holstein cattle. The cattle husbandry sector, in recent years, has been facing a worsening of the indicators of reproduction and longevity in <b>dairy</b> <b>cows.</b> It is primarily the requirement of constantly increasing the milk yield of <b>dairy</b> <b>cows</b> that has had an adverse impact on these indicators. The worsening of these indicators {{can result in a}} reduction of the cost-effectiveness of the production of milk and meat. The evaluation of influences on milk production and fertility in a herd of Holstein cattle was carried out at the AGRODAM Hořepník s. r. o. company. The selected influences included milk yield quantity, parity, age at first calving, calving interval, insemination index, and conception rate after first insemination. Two hundred and two Holstein <b>dairy</b> <b>cows</b> were included in the monitoring. Data on milk yield and reproduction were obtained from milk yield records and zootechnical records. The results showed that milk production of the monitored group of <b>dairy</b> <b>cows</b> was at a high level (10, 025 kg of milk). The highest milk yield in kilograms of milk during first lactation was achieved by <b>dairy</b> <b>cows</b> that calved at the age of 27 to 29 months (9, 335 kg of milk). According to the milk yield during the first lactation, the highest milk yield during three lactations was by <b>dairy</b> <b>cows</b> that had a milk yield exceeding 10, 000 kg of milk during the first lactation (35, 515 kg). When utilizing the DOUBLE OVSYNCH synchronization protocol, the average calving interval was 412 days, and a higher conception rate after first insemination (43 %) was found as compared to the nationwide average in the Czech Republic (34. 2 %). The average number of culled <b>dairy</b> <b>cows</b> was 32 %; from this the highest proportion of culled <b>dairy</b> <b>cows</b> was for other medical reasons (31 %).

25|$|Certain breeds of cattle, {{such as the}} Holstein-Friesian, {{are used}} to produce milk, which can be {{processed}} into dairy products such as milk, cheese or yogurt. Dairy cattle are usually kept on specialized dairy farms designed for milk production. Most cows are milked twice per day, with milk processed at a dairy, which may be onsite at the farm or the milk may be shipped to a dairy plant for eventual sale of a dairy product. For dairy cattle to continue producing milk, they must give birth to one calf per year. If the calf is male, it generally is slaughtered {{at a young age}} to produce veal. They will continue to produce milk until three weeks before birth. Over the last fifty years, dairy farming has become more intensive to increase the yield of milk produced by each cow. The Holstein-Friesian is the breed of <b>dairy</b> <b>cow</b> most common in the UK, Europe and the United States. It has been bred selectively to produce the highest yields of milk of any cow. Around 22 litres per day is average in the UK.|$|E

40|$|For {{hundreds}} {{years there}} has been a tradition with tethered <b>dairy</b> <b>cows</b> in Sweden. The last decades the old fashioned way to hold cows have been questioned and the number of <b>dairy</b> <b>cows</b> in loose housing has been increasing. Last year (2004) 19 percent in total of all farms with milk production in Sweden had their cows in loose housing. Because of EU-legislation concerning all organic production no farms are allowed to build tie stalls any more and after 2010 all organic <b>dairy</b> <b>cows</b> are supposed to live in loose-housing systems.

There are important differences between buildings made for conventional <b>dairy</b> <b>cows</b> and organic ones.

The preva-lence of Cryptosporidium infection in <b>dairy</b> <b>cows</b> was 7 % (95 %CI 3. 5 - 10. 5) by acid-fast staining, and 15. 5 % (95 %CI 10. 5 - 20. 5) by PCR-RFLP. This is the first report of genetic identification of the C. parvum bovine genotype in <b>dairy</b> <b>cows</b> in Thailand.

In Holstein cows, there was an effect of parity on IGF- 1, NEFA, BHB and glucose concentrations. The hormone and metabolite concentrations were not associated with pregnancy outcomes after one or three inseminations. In Jersey cows, IGF- 1, BHB and glucose concentrations were affected by parity.

The aim of this diploma thesis is to evaluate basic behaviour of <b>dairy</b> <b>cows</b> during all day in two cowsheds with automatic milking system, and to create a data file of <b>dairy</b> <b>cows</b> in two cowsheds with breeding of two different kinds of cattle - Czech Spotted cattle and Holstein <b>dairy</b> <b>cows,</b> and two different automatic milking systems ? Lely Astronaut and DeLaval. The results were evaluated by particular applicative statistics methods and the differences between the breeds and types of robots were compared. The thesis concerns three ethological observations in 2010 and 2011 which took place in Agricultural Cooperative Kluky near Písek, where Holstein <b>dairy</b> <b>cows</b> is bred and automatic milking system Lely Astronaut is used, and also three ethological observations in 2009 on a family farm in Chlumeček near Křemže, where Czech Spotted cattle is bred and automatic system DeLaval is used. The Holstein <b>dairy</b> <b>cows</b> spent feeding from 3, 4 to 3, 9 hours per day and Czech Spotted cattle spent feeding from 5, 6 to 6, 3 hours per day during all observation.
