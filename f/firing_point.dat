5|$|The air pistol {{range is}} the same as the air rifle range, giving each shooter a table, a 1metre wide <b>firing</b> <b>point,</b> and a 10-metre {{distance}} between the firing line and the target line. The current rules require ranges to be built indoors, with specified minimum requirements for artificial lighting. Many of the top-level competitions are held at temporary ranges installed in versatile sporting facilities or convention centres.|$|E
25|$|As {{the firing}} speed is {{increased}} beyond this, non-interrupted elliptic orbits are produced; one {{is shown in}} (D). If the initial firing is above {{the surface of the}} Earth as shown, there will also be non-interrupted elliptical orbits at slower firing speed; these will come closest to the Earth at the point half an orbit beyond, and directly opposite the <b>firing</b> <b>point,</b> below the circular orbit.|$|E
25|$|From a {{circular}} orbit, thrust applied {{in a direction}} opposite to the satellite's motion changes orbit to elliptical; the satellite will descend and reach the lowest orbital point (the periapse) at 180 degrees away from the firing point; then it will ascend back. Thrust applied {{in the direction of}} the satellite's motion creates an elliptical orbit with its highest point (apoapse) 180 degrees away from the <b>firing</b> <b>point.</b>|$|E
30|$|Flash {{point is}} defined as the minimum {{temperature}} at which the vapour from a liquid is sufficient to ignite when exposed to flame [27]. <b>Fire</b> <b>point</b> is the temperature at which the vapour formed as a result of ignition continues to burn for at least 5  s. Flash <b>point</b> and <b>fire</b> <b>point</b> are significant at high temperatures. They indicate the maximum temperature at which fuel can be stored and handled without serious fire hazard [28]. Flash <b>point</b> and <b>fire</b> <b>point</b> of 40 and 47  °C, respectively, were obtained for the catalytic pyrolytic liquid, while 78 and 85  °C were obtained for the thermal pyrolytic liquid. It is expected that the catalytic pyrolytic liquid which is light, non-viscous and wax free should be more volatile and ignites in open flame at lower temperature than the thermally pyrolytic liquid which is viscous. The kaolin catalyzed pyrolytic liquid flash and <b>fire</b> <b>points</b> were within the flash and <b>fire</b> <b>points</b> range of 37 – 42 and 42 – 47  °C for gasoline, respectively, but considerably lower than that of diesel oil with flash point range of 55 – 80  °C and <b>fire</b> <b>point</b> range of 60 – 90  °C. However, the thermal pyrolytic liquid flash and <b>fire</b> <b>points</b> are remarkably out of gasoline flash and <b>fire</b> <b>points</b> range but within diesel oil flash and fire points’ range.|$|R
50|$|The {{flash point}} may {{sometimes}} {{be confused with}} the autoignition temperature, which is the temperature at which the vapor ignites spontaneously without an ignition source. The <b>fire</b> <b>point</b> is the lowest temperature at which vapors of the material will keep burning after being ignited and the ignition source removed. The <b>fire</b> <b>point</b> is higher than the flash point, because at the flash point more vapor may not be produced rapidly enough to sustain combustion. Neither flash <b>point</b> nor <b>fire</b> <b>point</b> depends directly on the ignition source temperature, but it may be understood that ignition source temperature will be considerably higher than either the flash or <b>fire</b> <b>point.</b>|$|R

25|$|Hawkins {{had told}} me aboard the ship that he would put his platoon of men up against any company of {{soldiers}} on earth and guarantee to win. He was slightly wounded by shrapnel as he came ashore in the first wave, but {{the furthest thing from}} his mind was to be evacuated. He led his platoon into the forest of coconut palms. During {{a day and a half}} he personally cleaned out six Jap machine gun nests, sometimes standing on top of a track and <b>firing</b> <b>point</b> blank at four or five men who fired back at him from behind blockhouses. Lieutenant Hawkins was wounded a second time, but he still refused to retire. To say that his conduct was worthy of the highest traditions of the Marine Corps is like saying the Empire State Building is moderately high.|$|E
25|$|Although SIGINT {{had earlier}} alerted Jackson to the {{possible}} {{presence of a}} strong Viet Cong force {{in the vicinity of}} Nui Dat 2, patrols of the area revealed nothing and as a consequence B Company did not expect to meet significant opposition. Stepping off early on 17 August they believed they would not be out long and were only lightly equipped in patrol order, lacking sleeping gear and rations. With just 80 men—including many due to commence leave in Vung Tau the following day—they were significantly under-strength. Crossing the Suoi Da Bang creek, the <b>firing</b> <b>point</b> of the mortars was soon located as were signs of the Viet Cong withdrawal as they pushed further east. Meanwhile, A Company, 6 RAR under Captain Charles Mollison continued its patrol north of Nui Dat 2, and was involved in three minor clashes, killing one Viet Cong and wounding two. B Company was subsequently tasked to remain in the area to search to the north and east the following day and was met by porters that afternoon to supply them with rations. 9 Platoon, C Company returned to Nui Dat with nothing to report, leaving A and B Company to harbour in their night locations. Speculation {{about the size of the}} Viet Cong in the area increased. Captain Bryan Wickens, the 6 RAR Intelligence Officer, assessed that the presence of medium mortars, RCLs and artillery likely indicated a significant force. Due to growing uncertainty about Viet Cong intentions, Jackson agreed the patrol scheduled for 18 August should be increased from platoon to company size. D Company, 6 RAR under command of Major Harry Smith had previously been detailed for a three-day patrol south-east of Nui Dat and was instead ordered to relieve B Company the next day to continue the search. Despite this, neither Townsend nor Smith were warned of the possible presence of the 275th Regiment.|$|E
500|$|Flame fougasses were camouflaged with a {{covering}} of light material such as netting [...] anything heavier would significantly affect the range. They {{could easily be}} merged into hedgerows or the banks of a sunken lane within view of a well-hidden <b>firing</b> <b>point.</b> They were placed where a vehicle would be obliged to stop, or at least slow down. The flame fougasse would offer instant and horrific wounds to any unprotected men caught in its fiery maw and would cause a vehicle engine to stop within seven seconds simply because it was deprived of oxygen (although it would easily start again once the fireball subsided, provided nothing was damaged).|$|E
5000|$|The <b>fire</b> <b>point</b> of a fuel is {{the lowest}} {{temperature}} at which the vapour of that fuel will continue to burn for at least 5 seconds after ignition by an open flame. At the flash point, a lower temperature, a substance will ignite briefly, but vapor might not be produced at a rate to sustain the fire. Most tables of material properties will only list material flash points. Although in general the <b>fire</b> <b>points</b> can be assumed to be about 10 °C higher than the flash points this {{is no substitute for}} testing if the <b>fire</b> <b>point</b> is safety critical.|$|R

500|$|The {{propelling}} charge was prepared with an electrically triggered detonator in a primer bound with insulating tape {{to three or}} four cartridges of ammonal explosive. This assembly was placed in a small, waterproof rubber bag that was, in turn, placed inside a used cocoa tin. [...] of magnesium alloy turnings were added to ensure ignition of the fuel. The electrical wires were passed through a small hole in the lid of the tin which was then tightly fitted. The {{propelling charge}}s were kept in storage, only to be deployed when enemy action was imminent. To activate the device, the propelling charge was lowered down the pipe and tamped down with dry soil before being connected to a <b>firing</b> <b>point</b> about [...] away.

2500|$|After being {{discharged}} from the hospital, Nikolayev {{was sent to the}} [...] "Vystrel" [...] Commander's Courses in Sverdlovsk, from which he graduated in March 1943. In the spring, he became a company commander in the 197th Tank Brigade's mechanized infantry battalion. The brigade was part of the 30th Ural Volunteer Tank Corps. Nikolayev fought in the Operation Kutuzov in August. On 8 August, he led the company during heavy fighting for control of the village of Volosatov. Nikolayev reportedly distracted the German troops with a smokescreen and machine gun fire to their front while he led a platoon into the ravines in the German rear area. The platoon attacked a German <b>firing</b> <b>point,</b> the signal for an attack by the battalion. The village was captured and the German troops reportedly lost 600 killed. After several more days of fighting, Nikolayev was severely wounded and sent to the hospital again. On 28 August, he was awarded the Order of the Red Banner for his actions.|$|E
2500|$|At 02:43 on {{the night}} of 16/17 August Nui Dat was heavily bombarded by the Viet Cong, being hit by over 100 rounds from several 82mm mortars, 75mm RCLs and an old Japanese 70mm {{howitzer}} fired from a position [...] to the east. Most of the infantry were deployed at the time, with 5 RAR still engaged on Operation Holsworthy, although a small stay behind party remained. A Company, 6 RAR was on patrol in the north-east of the TAOR, while a platoon from C Company was manning a night ambush to the south-east. Continuing for 22 minutes, it damaged vehicles and tents and wounded 24 men, one of whom later died. The impact was spread over the south and south-east, with the 103rd Field Battery heaviest hit. Despite coming under fire, the guns from the 1st Field Regiment, RAA were quickly brought into action, commencing counter-battery fire at 02:50. As the artillery locating radar was suspected of being faulty, this was done using compass bearings on sound and flash. After the likely <b>firing</b> <b>point</b> was plotted, a regimental fire mission of 10 rounds was fired from each gun totalling 240 rounds, and the mortaring ceased. With the attack over the Australians remained alert in case of a ground assault; however, no follow up occurred. Regardless, the artillery continued to shell suspected firing positions and withdrawal routes until 04:10. Although the Viet Cong were expected to have withdrawn, several company patrols would be dispatched the following morning to search the area east of Nui Dat in response.|$|E

Any passer-by ignorant of the circumstances would have wondered at the countenances of these young people, engaged, apparently, in the amusement of pistol practice. There was no smile on them, no merry laugh when the ball went wide of the mark, no triumphant shout at a successful shot. Their faces were set, pale, and earnest, Scarcely a word was spoken. Each loaded in silence, took up a place at the <b>firing</b> <b>point,</b> and aimed steadily and seriously; the boys with an angry eye and frowning brow, as if each time they were firing at a deadly foe; the girls as earnestly, and without any of the nervousness or timidity which would be natural in girls handling firearms for the first time.
