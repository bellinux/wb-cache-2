5|$|Presumably as a {{consequence}} of the Roman advance, various hill forts such as Dun Mor in Perthshire, which had been abandoned by the natives long ago, were re-occupied. Some new ones may even <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>constructed</b> in the northeast, such as Hill O'Christ's Kirk in Aberdeenshire.|$|E
5|$|The {{dates of}} the {{earliest}} church cannot be verified, but a church building may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>constructed</b> {{at the site of}} Old Pine Church as early as around 1814, and possibly as early as 1792.|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} timber church, {{which was}} dedicated to St Michael, is believed to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>constructed</b> in the 11th or 12th century from which post holes have since been identified. Associated monk cells have also been identified.|$|E
5|$|Bicycles <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>constructed,</b> for {{investigation}} and demonstration purposes, with the steering reversed so that turning the handlebars {{to the left}} causes the front wheel {{to turn to the}} right, and vica versa.

5|$|Gravitational-wave {{astronomy}} is {{an emerging}} field of astronomy that employs gravitational-wave detectors to collect observational data about distant massive objects. A few observatories <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>constructed,</b> {{such as the}} Laser Interferometer Gravitational Observatory LIGO. LIGO made its first detection on 14 September 2015, observing gravitational waves from a binary black hole. A second gravitational wave was detected on 26 December 2015 and additional observations should continue but gravitational waves require extremely sensitive instruments.|$|E
5|$|Hall Place, {{formerly}} Bentworth Hall or Manor, is a Grade II* listed medieval hall-house, located {{south of}} the road to Medstead just south-west of Tinker's Lane. It was built in the early 14th century with additions in the 17th and 19th centuries. The hall is believed to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>constructed</b> by either the constable of Farnham Castle, William de Aula, or 'John of Bynteworth'. The de Aula family are documented as being the first owners, followed by the de Melton family.|$|E

A number of bridges <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>constructed</b> over the creek since the 1920s, and it has been dammed by the Bryant Pond Dam. It is possible to canoe on part of the creek.

5|$|Homemade {{versions}} of pancake machines <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>constructed.</b> An {{example of a}} homemade pancake machine is one constructed in 1977 by Ken Whitsett of the Ocala Kiwanis Club in Ocala, Florida, which {{was used for the}} organization's annual pancake day. The Kiwanis machine utilized a hopper filled with pancake batter that was manually dropped onto a revolving griddle. The pancakes were manually flipped and plated when cooking was completed. It required four people for its operation, and could produce between 750–1000 pancakes per hour.|$|E
5|$|However, {{throughout}} the history of Christianity a number of relics attributed to Jesus have been claimed, although doubt has been cast on them. The 16thcentury Catholic theologian Erasmus wrote sarcastically about the proliferation of relics and the number of buildings that could <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>constructed</b> from the wood claimed to be from the cross used in the Crucifixion. Similarly, while experts debate whether Jesus was crucified with three nails or with four, at least thirty holy nails continue to be venerated as relics across Europe.|$|E

The completion of the lake finally laid the platform for the development of Griffin's Parliamentary Triangle. Since the initial construction of the lake, various buildings of national importance <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>constructed</b> on its shores.|$|E
5|$|The Second Avenue Subway would {{originate}} at Harding Avenue in the Bronx, {{and connect}} into the Court Street station in Brooklyn as a two-track and four-track line. A yard would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>constructed</b> {{to store the}} line's equipment. The first phase would end the line at East 139th Street. The Main Line and its connections to other subway lines was to have cost $213,950,000, while the future Bronx extension would have cost $130,160,000.|$|E
5|$|The above {{explanations}} all {{place the}} causeway within a Roman military context. An alternative, or perhaps secondary, usage for the causeway in Roman times {{is suggested by}} landscape author Michael Dunn and others, who state that it may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>constructed</b> for the transport of jet inland from Whitby. Hayes and Rutter are dismissive, stating {{that the value of}} jet mined in the Roman period would not have justified the expense of the causeway's construction.|$|E

5|$|The {{watershed}} of Toby Creek occupies part {{or all of}} ten boroughs {{and four}} townships. The creek's watershed is mainly rural. Pennsylvania Route 309, Pennsylvania Route 118, and US Route 11 are partially within it. The two-billion-gallon Huntsville Reservoir {{is also in the}} creek's drainage basin. Several mills were built along the creek in the 1800s and many bridges <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>constructed</b> over it. The creek experienced significant floods in 1942 and 1972.|$|E
5|$|A castle may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>constructed</b> on Castle Island by 1257, {{when the}} 16-year-old King Alexander III of Scotland was {{forcibly}} brought there by his regents. During the First War of Scottish Independence (1296–1328), the invading English army held the castle, then named Loch Leven Castle, which lies at a strategically important position between {{the towns of}} Edinburgh, Stirling and Perth. Parts of the present fortification, the curtain wall, may date from this time and were perhaps built by the occupying English. The castle was captured by the Scots {{before the end of}} the 13th century, possibly by the forces of William Wallace.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, Darius {{sponsored}} large {{construction projects}} in Susa, Babylon, Egypt, and Persepolis. In Susa, Darius {{built a new}} palace complex {{in the north of}} the city. An inscription states that the palace was destroyed during the reign of Artaxerxes I, but was rebuilt. Today only glazed bricks of the palace remain, the majority of them in the Louvre. In Pasargadae Darius finished all incomplete construction projects from the reign of Cyrus the Great. A palace was also built during the reign of Darius, with an inscription in the name of Cyrus the Great. It was previously believed that Cyrus had constructed this building, however due to the cuneiform script being used, the palace is believed to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>constructed</b> by Darius.|$|E
