Its merit is to enable the researcher to see the hierarchical structure of studied phenomena. To interpret the results, one proceeds either by post-multiplying the primary <b>factor</b> <b>pattern</b> matrix by the higher-order <b>factor</b> <b>pattern</b> matrices (Gorsuch, 1983) and perhaps applying a Varimax rotation to the result (Thompson, 1990) or by using a Schmid-Leiman solution (SLS, Schmid & Leiman, 1957, also known as Schmid-Leiman transformation) which attributes the variation from the primary factors to the second-order factors.|$|E

He was an early and frequent user of factor analysis (a statistical procedure for finding underlying factors in data). Cattell also developed new factor analytic techniques, for example, by inventing the Scree Test, which uses the curve of latent roots to judge the optimal number of factors to extract. He also developed a new factor analysis rotation procedure—the [...] "Procrustes" [...] or non-orthogonal rotation, designed to let the data itself determine the best location of factors, rather than requiring orthogonal factors. Additional contributions include the Coefficient of Profile Similarity (taking account of shape, scatter, and level of two score profiles); P-technique factor analysis based on repeated measurements of a single individual (sampling of variables, rather than sampling of persons); dR-technique factor analysis for elucidating change dimensions (including transitory emotional states, and longer-lasting mood states); the Taxonome program for ascertaining the number and contents of clusters in a data set; the Rotoplot program for attaining maximum simple structure <b>factor</b> <b>pattern</b> solutions. As well, he put forward the Dynamic Calculus for assessing interests and motivation, the Basic Data Relations Box (assessing dimensions of experimental designs), the group syntality construct ("personality" [...] of a group), the triadic theory of cognitive abilities, the Ability Dimension Analysis Chart (ADAC), and Multiple Abstract Variance Analysis (MAVA), with [...] "specification equations" [...] to embody genetic and environmental variables and their interactions.|$|E

40|$|Exploratory factor {{analysis}} (EFA) {{has long been}} used in the social sciences to depict the relationships between variables/items and latent traits. Researchers face many choices when using EFA, including the choice of rotation criterion, which can be dif-ficult given that few research articles have discussed and/or demonstrated their differ-ences.

Specifically, the study focused on how well WLSM and WLSMV estimation techniques work for multilevel CFA models with categorical/ordinal data by examining parameter estimates, standard error estimates of the parameters, and some of the fit indices. Also, the performance of commonly used fit indices for misspecified two-level CFA models for categorical/ordinal variables with the WLSM and WLSMV estimations was examined using traditional cutoff values for the fit indices. Simulation results showed that WLSM and WLSMV estimated biased <b>factor</b> <b>pattern</b> coefficients and the factor correlation in the between-level regardless of the simulation design factors. In the within-level model, the <b>factor</b> <b>pattern</b> coefficients and correlation were unbiased when a large number of cluster size (CS) and a large number of clusters (NC) were used; but these parameters were biased when a small NC and CS were used. Standard error estimates of the parameters in both within- and between-levels were biased regardless of the design conditions, so parameters should not be evaluated based on statistical significance test results even when these parameter estimates are unbiased. The chi-square overall model test statistics were poorly estimated. WLSM or WLSMV based overall model chi-square test statistics did not follow the traditional chi-square test distribution. Because of that, lower power rates were obtained when <b>factor</b> <b>pattern</b> coefficients were misspecified in the between- or within-level models. Generally, CFI, TLI, RMSEA, SRMR for the between-level model (SRMR-B), and SRMR for the within-level model (SRMR-W) performed poorly for detecting misspecifications.

40|$|Abstract. Deodhar [Deo 90] {{proposes a}} {{combinatorial}} framework {{for determining the}} Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials of an arbitrary Coxeter group. The algorithm he describes is shown to work for all Weyl groups, but typically involves recursion. However, under a certain condition on the element w of a Weyl group, Deodhar’s algorithm for determining the Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomial Px,w associated to the elements x and w, for any x ≤ w in the Weyl group, {{turns out to be}} a simple combinatorial formula. We say that w is Deodhar when it satisfies the condition. In this paper we characterize the Deodhar property for elements of finite Weyl groups using a new form of pattern avoidance inspired by reduced expressions and heaps, rather than the 1 -line notations on which the traditional forms of pattern avoidance rely. The embedded <b>factor</b> <b>pattern</b> avoidance turns out to be more efficient than the standard pattern avoidance (although either can be used to detect the Deodhar condition). In order to perform this characterization, we enhance the definitions and techniques found in [BW 01], which showed that the Deodhar condition for type A is equivalent to avoiding short-braids, and a single additional embedded <b>factor</b> <b>pattern</b> called a hexagon...|$|E

40|$|Relatively {{little is}} known about {{consumer}} perceptions of retailers in Central and Eastern Europe. What store attributes do consumers in these markets emphasize? Do these attributes reflect the culture of the region? These questions are addressed in the case of Estonia. However our main objective is to contrast the Estonian situation with that of a typical Western country, Canada. Two key shopping experience constructs are selected, namely merchandise selection and the interactivity between the store and the consumer. To make the comparison meaningful we have chosen a single retail category, namely discount or low-price department stores. In both countries there were two stores that dominated their respective market, so this facilitates the collection of consumer perceptions. Structural equation modeling using AMOS software has been used to test the equivalence of the constructs across cultures. Our main findings are that (1) both merchandise selection and store-customer interaction are valid constructs across both countries, (2) that the <b>factor</b> <b>patterns</b> have configural invariance or equivalence for each construct across the two cultures and (3) that the <b>factor</b> <b>patterns</b> do not have weak factor invariance across the cultures.
