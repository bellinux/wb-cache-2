5|$|The Old Blockhouse saw {{military}} action in 1651 during the interregnum {{after the end of}} the English Civil War, making it one of the very few of England's coastal <b>defences</b> <b>to</b> have ever seen actual fighting.|$|E
5|$|<b>Defences</b> <b>to</b> tracing are possible, {{particularly}} if returning the property would harm an innocent defendant, where the claimant has made false {{representations that the}} defendant relied on to his detriment, or where the property has been transferred to an innocent third party without anything given to the defendant in return that the claimant could recover in lieu.|$|E
5|$|In 1539 {{the threat}} of {{invasion}} from France and Spain grew and Henry issued orders for his coastal <b>defences</b> <b>to</b> be improved, creating a sequence of fortifications called the Device Forts across England. These were intended to carry artillery pieces able to engage enemy naval vessels should they approach the coast, and to deter any enemy landings. As part of this programme of work, Camber Castle was considerably expanded {{at a cost of}} £5,660.|$|E

5|$|The {{entrance}} {{was often}} the weakest part in a circuit of <b>defences.</b> <b>To</b> overcome this, the gatehouse was developed, allowing those inside the castle to control the flow of traffic. In earth and timber castles, the gateway was usually the first feature to be rebuilt in stone. The front of the gateway was a blind spot and to overcome this, projecting towers were added {{on each side of}} the gate in a style similar to that developed by the Romans. The gatehouse contained a series of <b>defences</b> <b>to</b> make a direct assault more difficult than battering down a simple gate. Typically, there were one or more portcullises– a wooden grille reinforced with metal to block a passage– and arrowslits to allow defenders to harry the enemy. The passage through the gatehouse was lengthened to increase the amount of time an assailant had to spend under fire in a confined space and unable to retaliate.|$|E
5|$|The {{plan for}} the battle was {{straightforward}} for both sides. The Russians wanted {{to break through the}} Polish <b>defences</b> <b>to</b> Warsaw, while the Polish aim was to defend the area long enough for a two-pronged counteroffensive from the south, led by General Józef Piłsudski, and north, led by General Władysław Sikorski, to outflank the attacking forces.|$|E
5|$|The roof of {{the south}} tower {{provides}} views of the surrounding landscape; in the 13th-century protective wooden mantlets would have been fitted into the gaps of the merlons along the battlements, and during the English Civil War it was equipped with additional wooden <b>defences</b> <b>to</b> protect the garrison.|$|E

5|$|Although the Thames {{had been}} defended from naval attack since Henry VIII's time, when five blockhouses were built {{as part of}} the Device Forts chain of coastal defences, there were no {{equivalents}} on the Medway. Two medieval castles – Rochester Castle and Queenborough Castle – existed along the river's south bank, but both were intended to defend landward approaches and were of little use for defence. There was thus a pressing need for proper <b>defences</b> <b>to</b> protect the vulnerable ships and shore facilities on the upper Medway.|$|E
5|$|Brownsea Castle {{was built}} as a {{consequence}} of international tensions between England, France and the Holy Roman Empire in the final years of the reign of King Henry VIII. Traditionally the Crown had left coastal <b>defences</b> <b>to</b> the local lords and communities, only taking a small role in building and maintaining fortifications, and while France and the Empire remained in conflict with one another, maritime raids were common but an actual invasion of England seemed unlikely. Modest defences, based around simple blockhouses and towers, existed in the south-west and along the Sussex coast, with a few more impressive works in the north of England, but in general the fortifications were very limited in scale.|$|E

5|$|Considerable Australian {{and other}} Allied {{military}} resources {{were devoted to}} protecting shipping and ports from Axis submarines and warships. For instance, the RAN escorted over 1,100coastal convoys the Army established coastal <b>defences</b> <b>to</b> protect important ports and {{a high proportion of}} the RAAF's operational squadrons were used to protect shipping at various times. Nevertheless, the use of these units for defensive tasks and the shipping casualties in Australian waters did not seriously affect the Australian economy or Allied war effort.|$|E

5|$|During the Interregnum, a governor, Sir John Fowell, was {{appointed}} by Parliament to run the defences of Dartmouth and to prevent smuggling.

Charles II was restored to the throne in 1660 and initially granted the Dartmouth <b>defences</b> <b>to</b> the control of town once again. By 1662, however, the fortifications in Dartmouth were garrisoned by a royal force of 23 men and overseen by Sir John, who continued in his post as captain and governor until 1677.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} hours of August 15 the Russian forces resumed their attacks on the Polish lines, {{intending}} to break through the second line of <b>defences</b> <b>to</b> the area of Nieporęt and Jabłonna. However, as they bypassed a small forest outside Wólka Radzymińska, they were assaulted from the rear by the 1st Battalion of the 28th Infantry Regiment, which had been concealed there earlier. Simultaneously, the remainder of the 28th Regiment began a badly coordinated and half-hearted attack from Nieporęt. Both Polish assaults were bloodily repelled, with the casualties including Lieutenant Pogonowski who was posthumously awarded the Virtuti Militari medal for his bravery leading the charge, but they did force the Russians to retreat to their initial positions.|$|E
