40|$|Abstract Background The use of {{information}} and communication technologies in healthcare is seen as essential for high quality and cost-effective healthcare. However, implementation of <b>e-health</b> <b>initiatives</b> has often been problematic, with many failing to demonstrate predicted benefits. This study aimed to explore and understand the experiences of implementers [...] the senior managers and other staff charged with implementing <b>e-health</b> <b>initiatives</b> and their assessment of factors which promote or inhibit the successful implementation, embedding, and integration of <b>e-health</b> <b>initiatives.</b> Methods We used a case study methodology, using semi-structured interviews with implementers for data collection. Case studies were selected to provide a range of healthcare contexts (primary, secondary, community care), <b>e-health</b> <b>initiatives,</b> and degrees of normalization. The initiatives studied were Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS) in secondary care, a Community Nurse Information System (CNIS) in community care, and Choose and Book (C&B) across the primary-secondary care interface. Implementers were selected to provide a range of seniority, including chief executive officers, middle managers, and staff with 'on the ground' experience. Interview data were analyzed using a framework derived from Normalization Process Theory (NPT). Results Twenty-three interviews were completed across the three case studies. There were wide differences in experiences of implementation and embedding across these case studies; these differences were well explained by collective action components of NPT. New technology was most likely to 'normalize' where implementers perceived that it had a positive impact on interactions between professionals and patients and between different professional groups, and fit well with the organisational goals and skill sets of existing staff. However, where implementers perceived problems in {{one or more of these}} areas, they also perceived a lower level of normalization. Conclusions Implementers had rich understandings of barriers and facilitators to successful implementation of <b>e-health</b> <b>initiatives,</b> and their views should continue to be sought in future research. NPT can be used to explain observed variations in implementation processes, and may be useful in drawing planners' attention to potential problems with a view to addressing them during implementation planning. </p...|$|R

Many issues are presented as key to its success including solving issues with confidentiality and privacy. However, the main problem may not be these issues in sharing information {{but the fact that}} the point of origin of such records is still relatively insecure. This paper highlights why this may be the case. Research into the security of medical information has shown that many primary healthcare providers are unable to create an environment with effective information security. Numerous factors contribute to this complex situation including a trustful environment, the resultant security culture and the capability of individual healthcare organisations. Further, the growing importance of new directions in the use of patient information is considered. This paper discusses these issues and positions them within the complex environment that is healthcare. In our current health system infrastructure, the points of origin of patient information are our most vulnerable.

40|$|Wolter and Marsha Dolan), and the Kansas {{steering}} committee. Background Consumer interests, preferences, {{knowledge and}} attitudes are central to successful health information exchange. As health information technology/health information exchange (HIT/HIE) in Kansas continues to expand and evolve, consumer understanding and trust in the process, especially technical and legal protections, are essential to successful outcomes. It is believed that consumer education regarding HIT and HIE privacy and security issues and capabilities can facilitate HIT adoption, generate consumer advocates of HIT and HIE, and enable consumers to benefit sooner. Other research supports this logic model. The <b>E-Health</b> <b>Initiative</b> Foundation found that consumers were more receptive to the electronic exchange of their health information when they were better informed. 1 Consumers create demand for information services and thus influence HIT and HIE through market forces. Consumers also recognize their need to acquire or define a vocabulary that will empower them to exercise the level of control that they demand over how their health information may be used by others. Some of this control will be exercised though contract (i. e., through specific authorization and consent mechanisms); some through statute (i. e., throug...|$|E

The protection of e-health information security is critical to the successful implementation of any <b>e-health</b> <b>initiative.</b> To address this, this paper proposes a security architecture for index-based e-health environments, according to the broad outline of Australia’s National E-health Strategy and National E-health Transition Authority (NEHTA) ’s Connectivity Architecture.

40|$|Information {{technology}} adds considerable {{value to}} modern organizations and healthcare is no exception. Information technology {{plays a major}} role in the financial viability of healthcare organizations, like hospitals, but while it is indispensable for hospital administration, the penetration of IT in clinical areas has been low. Although the administrative side of healthcare enjoys considerable computer support, the clinical side does not. Yet data on clinical errors of patient care, such as incorrect medical dosages, or even treatments, suggest automatic patient data proc-essing could be beneficial. Electronic communication could make available critical health information that is currently often absent. To improve healthcare computer integration in the current U. S. <b>e-health</b> <b>initiative,</b> clinical IT support is a key area. But clinical healthcare providers often resist IT support. This has been attributed either to medical conservatism, the lack of IT ease of use, or both. However, doctors and nurses often use complex medical equipment, and in healthcare laboratories they have readily accepted computer support. We suggest a more valid reason for IT resistance may be that clinical healthcare has unique requirements, specifically data confidentiality and data mobility. The difficulty of combining these criteria in a single IT product may explain why clinical healthcare lags considerably behind administrative healthcare in IT support...|$|E

(4) Software usage collected via GP questionnaire and qualified through visual inspection of the software meta-data. Results: Software implementation posed difficult and at times disabling technological barriers (e. g. out-dated hardware, poor internet connections). The software's speed and inability to seamlessly link with day-to-day software was a source of considerable frustration. Overall, GPs rated software usability as poor, although most (68 %) felt that the structure and functionality of the software was useful. Recommendations for future <b>e-health</b> <b>initiatives</b> include thorough scoping of IT systems and server speed, testing across diverse environments, automated pre-requisite checks and upgrades of processors/memory where necessary, and user-created usernames and passwords. Conclusions: GPs are willing to embrace novel technologies to support their practice. However, implementation remains challenging mainly for technical reasons, and this precludes further evaluation of potential user-specific barriers. These findings could inform future e-health ventures into shared-care, and highlight the need for an appropriate infrastructure.

40|$|The {{protection}} of patient information {{is now more}} important as a national e-health system approaches reality in Australia. The major challenge for health care providers is to understand the importance information security whilst also incorporating effective protection into established workflow and daily activity. Why then, when {{it is difficult for}} IT and security professionals to navigate through and apply the myriad of information security standards, do we expect small enterprises such as primary health care providers to also be able to do this. This is an onerous and impractical task without significant assistance. In the development of the new Computer and Information Security Standards (CISS) for Australian General Practice, a consistent and iterative process for the interpretation and application of international standards was used. This involved both the interpretation of the standards and the application of knowledge to create a practical but acceptable level of security for the primary healthcare environment. From a security perspective such practical application of standards poses the dichotomous challenge (and criticism) of how much security is sufficient versus how much can the primary healthcare environment manage. This paper describes the path of development from standards to implementation using the CISS as an example. It is concluded that more practical assistance is required by the security profession to support the national <b>e-health</b> <b>initiative</b> if Australia is to provide a safe and secure healthcare environment...|$|E

Many issues are presented as key to its success including solving issues with confidentiality and privacy. However the largest problem may not be these issues in sharing information {{but the fact that}} the point of origin and storage of such records is still relatively insecure. Australia aims to have a Personally Controlled Electronic Health Record in 2012 and this is underpinned by a national network for e-health. It is this very foundation that becomes the critical infrastructure, with general practice the cornerstone for its success. Yet, research into the security of medical information has shown that many general practices are unable to create an environment with effective information security. This paper puts together the connections of e-health and the complex environment in which it is positioned. A discussion of how this critical infrastructure is assembled is presented, and the key vulnerabilities are identified. Further, it addresses how security may be approached to cater for this diverse and complex environment. From a national security and critical infrastructure perspective, as medical records are part of society’s critical infrastructure, the most effective system attacks are those on the points of highest vulnerability. In our current health system infrastructure those points are the data collection and records retention areas of individual medical providers.

40|$|Background: There are an {{estimated}} 4. 7 million with knee osteoarthritis (OA) and 2. 1 million with hip osteoarthritis in the United Kingdom. Resources to manage OA within the National Health Service are limited. National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines advocate education and self-management for all people with osteoarthritis. Most recently E-health programmes via the internet {{are being used to}} deliver health services and information.. Arthritis Australia & Osteoarthritis Research Society International developed Myjointpain. org to support Australians in self-managing hip and/or knee joint pain. There is currently no equivalent UK e-health resource [...] This study explored the attitudes, facilitators and barriers towards using e-health by people self-managing hip/knee OA in the UK. Method: A qualitative design using semi-structured telephone interviews was used. Patient and public involvement (PPI) members were recruited via Nottingham City Hospital. PPI members were included if they had Hip and/or Knee joint pain and internet access. Each PPI member was provided with an information sheet and consent form. All consenting members received a link to the Myjointpain,org website and given XX days to practice using the programme. Participants were then contacted for a telephone interview. The interviews were transcribed and a six step thematic analysis used. This included (1) Reading/re-reading of transcript, (2) Coding interesting features of data, (3) Categorising codes into potential themes/subthemes, (4) Reviewing themes, (5) Defining themes, (6) Producing final report. Themes identified were independently verified. Results:. Twelve PPI members wre recruited and contributed to telephone interviews. Overall PPI members were open to using an <b>e-health</b> <b>initiative</b> to self-manage their joint pain; Facilitators that encouraged PPI members to use Myjointpain. org included:. the interactive nature of the e-health programme; the personalised action plan, and participatns’ preceived trustworthiness of the content of the website.,However excess information was reported as a barrier of use, as well as finding time to use the website due to busy lifestyles. The use of email/telephone prompting was thought may help people better engage with on line self management programmes. [...] Conclusion PPI members with hip and /or knee OA in the UK report that they are receptive and open to considering using the Myjointpain. org web based e learning self management programme. Such an approach that emphasises personalised and interactive aspects to facilitate self management helps promote engagement with self management. Prompting is helpful in maintaining engagement (e. g. via e-mail) and provision of too much information may prevent people from engaging with the programme.

Outcome of assessment led to creation of e-health architectural framework for e-health solutions. Assessment was conducted in usage of ICT in patient healthcare record system, processes and procedures in consultation among healthcare professionals, prescription of medication, referral of patients and training of healthcare professionals in ICT usage. The study was in two phases and six hospitals were selected. E-healthcare readiness assessment focusing on need, technological, engagement and social acceptance readiness were assessed. Data collected used group interviews and qualitative questionnaires. Findings showed that computers were not used for clinical duties and no e-health solutions were found. E-health Maturity Level was at level zero. Recommendations and compilation of Provincial E-Health Framework (PEHF) were made. The findings were unexpected and therefore, of great benefit to healthcare institutions which intend to implement <b>e-health</b> <b>initiatives</b> in hospitals...|$|R
40|$|For <b>E-HEALTH</b> <b>initiatives</b> in Uttarakhand the {{proposed}} E-HEALTH service model may allow better sharing of health information among multiple government departments, locally {{as well as}} at a distant location. But without coordination of different departments in Uttarakhand we cannot setup good e-health solutions. Priorities of Uttarakhand government for providing E-HEALTH facilities to rural areas are yet to be fulfilled. At present stage less budget from state government for health, and lack of coordination have triggered down trend in health services in rural and hilly areas of Uttarakhand This paper reviews use of ICT applications at different locations in our country and also try to provide a model for Uttarakhand province. Some suggested services using ICT and smart phone apps in healthcare are explained in this paper also. Use of smart phone apps to communicate health associated alerts using SMS services and collect information from rural areas suggested here in this paper...|$|R

The application of internet-based ICTs (Information Communication Technologies) to healthcare is a necessary but not sufficient solution to address today&# 039;s healthcare challenges. To improve access and quality, and thereby realise the value proposition for healthcare, healthcare organisations must maximise the data and information generated by them and which flow through these ICTs. This goal can be reached by embracing the techniques of Data Mining (DM) and the strategies of Knowledge Management (KM). When coupled with evidence-based medicine, and the introduction of various internet-based ICTs such as electronic medical record systems and <b>e-health</b> <b>initiatives,</b> KM and DM create strategic imperatives for healthcare organisations to maximise both the clinical and administrative benefits from their application of internet-based information and communication technologies to healthcare...|$|R
40|$|Despite recent public {{attention}} to e-health {{as a solution}} to rising healthcare costs and an ageingpopulation, there have been relatively few studies examining the geographical pattern of e-health usage. This paper argues for an equitable approach to e-health and attention {{to the way in which}} <b>e-health</b> <b>initiatives</b> can produce locational health inequalities, particularly in socioeconomically disadvantaged areas. In this paper, we use a case study to demonstrate geographical variation in Internet accessibility, Internet status and prevalence of chronic diseases within a small district. There are signifi cant disparities in access to health information within socioeconomically disadvantaged areas. The most vulnerable people in these areas are likely to have limited availability of, or access to Internet healthcare resources. They are also more likely to have complex chronic diseases and, therefore, be in greatest need of these resources. This case study demonstrates the importance of an equitable approach to e-health information technologies and telecommunications infrastructure.
