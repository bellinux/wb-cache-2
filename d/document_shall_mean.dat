40|$|To {{aid in the}} {{representative}} measurement of pollutant emissions and/or total volumetric flow rate from a stationary source, a measurement site where the effluent stream is flowing in a known direction is selected, and the cross-section of the stack is divided {{into a number of}} equal areas. A traverse point is then located within each of these equal areas. 1. 2 Applicability This method is applicable to flowing gas streams in ducts, stacks, and flues. The method cannot be used when: (1) flow is cyclonic or swirling (see Section 2. 4); (2) a stack is smaller than about 0. 30 meter (12 in.) in diameter or 0. 071 m 2 (113 in. 2) in cross-sectional area; or (3) the measurement site is less than two stack or duct diameters downstream or less than a half diameter upstream from a flow disturbance. The requirements of this method must be considered before construction of a new facility from which emissions will be measured; failure to do so may require subsequent alterations to the stack or deviation from the standard procedure. Cases involving variants are subject to approval by the Executive Officer.

40|$|A {{gas sample}} is {{extracted}} from a stack, {{by one of}} the following methods: (1) single-point, grab sampling; (2) single-point, integrated sampling; or (3) multi-point, integrated sampling. The gas sample is analyzed for percent carbon dioxide (CO 2), percent oxygen (O 2), and, if necessary, percent carbon monoxide (CO). For dry molecular weight determination, either an Orsat or a Fyrite analyzer or other analyzers specified in Method 100 may be used for the analysis; for excess air or emission rate correction factor determination, an Orsat analyzer or analyzers specified in Method 100 must be used. 1. 2 Applicability 1. 2. 1 This method is applicable for determining CO 2 and O 2 concentrations, excess air, and dry molecular weight of a sample from a gas stream of a fossil-fuel combustion process. The method may also be applicable to other processes where it has been determined that compounds other than CO 2, O 2, CO, and nitrogen (N 2) are not present in concentration sufficient to affect the results. 1. 2. 2 Other methods, as well as modifications to the procedure described herein, are also applicable for {{some or all of the}} above determinations.

40|$|A {{gas sample}} is {{extracted}} from the sampling point in the stack. The sulfuric acid mist (including sulfur trioxide) and the sulfur dioxide (SO 2) are separated. The SO 2 fraction {{is measured by the}} barium-thorin titration method. 1. 2 Applicability This method is applicable for the determination of SO 2 emissions from stationary sources. The minimum detectable limit of the method has been determined to be 3. 4 milligrams (mg) of SO 2 /m 3 (2. 12 x 10 - 7 lb/ft 3). Although no upper limit has been established, tests have shown that concentrations as high as 80, 000 mg/m 3 of SO 2 can be collected efficiently in two midget impingers, each containing 15 milliliters of 3 percent hydrogen peroxide, at a rate of 1. 0 liter/min for 20 minutes. Based on theoretical calculations, the upper concentration limit in a 20 -liter sample is about 93, 300 mg/m 3. Possible interferents are free ammonia, water-soluble cations, and fluorides. The cations and fluorides are removed by glass wool filters and an isopropanol bubbler, and hence do not affect the SO 2 analysis. When samples are being taken from a gas stream with high concentrations of very fine metallic fumes (such as found in inlets to control devices), a high-efficiency glass-fiber filter must be used in place of the glass wool plug (i. e., the one in the probe) to remove the cation interferents. Free ammonia interferes by reacting with SO 2 to form particulate sulfite and by reacting with the indicator. If free ammonia is present (this can be determined by knowledge of the process and noticing white particulate matter in the probe and isopropanol bubbler), alternative methods subject to the approval of the Executive Officer, are required. Any modification of this method beyond those expressly permitted shall be considered a major modification subject to the approval of the Executive Officer. The term Executive Officer as used in this <b>document</b> <b>shall</b> <b>mean</b> the Executive Officer of the Air Resources Board (ARB), or his or her authorized representative...|$|E
40|$|This {{method is}} {{applicable}} to the determination of total reduced sulfur (TRS) emissions from recovery boilers, lime kilns, and smelt dissolving tanks at kraft pulp mills, and from other sources when specified in an applicable subpart of the regulations. The TRS compounds include hydrogen sulfide, methyl mercaptan, dimethyl sulfide, and dimethyl disulfide. The flue gas must contain at least 1 percent oxygen for complete oxidation of all TRS to sulfur dioxide (SO 2). The lower detectable limit is 0. 1 ppm SO 2 when sampling at 2 liters/min for 3 hours or 0. 3 ppm when sampling at 2 liters/min for 1 hour. The upper concentration limit of the method exceeds TRS levels generally encountered at kraft pulp mills. 1. 2 Principle. An integrated gas sample is extracted from the stack. SO 2 is removed selectively from the sample using a citrate buffer solution. TRS compounds are then thermally oxidized to SO 2, collected in hydrogen peroxide as sulfate, and analyzed by the Method 6 barium-thorin titration procedure. Any modification of this method beyond those expressly permitted shall be considered a major modification subject to {{the approval of the}} Executive Officer. The term Executive Officer as used in this <b>document</b> <b>shall</b> <b>mean</b> the Executive Officer of the Air Resources Board (ARB), or his or her authorized representative. 1. 3 Interferences. TRS compounds other than those regulated by the emission standards, if present, may be measured by this method. Therefore, carbonyl sulfide, which is partially oxidized to SO 2 and may be present in a lime kiln exit stack, would be a positive interferant. Particulate matter from the lime kiln stack gas (primarily calcium carbonate) can cause a negative bias if it is allowed to enter the citrate scrubber; the particulate matter will cause the pH to rise and H 2 S to be absorbed prior to oxidation. Furthermore, if the calcium carbonate enters the hydrogen peroxide impingers, the calcium will precipitate sulfate ion. Proper use of the particulate filter described in Section 2. 1. 3 will eliminate this interference...|$|E
