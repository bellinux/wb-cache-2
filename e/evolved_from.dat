5|$|Using fossil evidence, {{there are}} three main {{theories}} for the origin of modern amphibians. One is that they <b>evolved</b> <b>from</b> dissorophoid temnospondyls. Another is that they <b>evolved</b> <b>from</b> lepospondyls, most likely the lysorophians. A third hypothesis is that caecilians descended from lepospondyls and frogs and salamanders <b>evolved</b> <b>from</b> dissorophoids.|$|E

5|$|In lemuriform primates, the toothcomb {{has been}} used by {{scientists}} in the interpretation of the evolution of lemurs and their kin. They are thought to have <b>evolved</b> <b>from</b> early adapiform primates around the Eocene or earlier. One popular hypothesis is that they <b>evolved</b> <b>from</b> European adapids, but the fossil record suggests that they <b>evolved</b> <b>from</b> an older lineage that migrated to Africa during the Paleocene (66 to 55mya) and might have <b>evolved</b> <b>from</b> early cercamoniines from Asia. Fossil primates such as Djebelemur, 'Anchomomys' milleri, and Plesiopithecus may have been their closest relatives. The lack of a distinct toothcomb in the fossil record prior to 40mya has created a conflict with molecular clock studies that suggest an older divergence between lemurs and lorisoids, and the existence of a ghost lineage of lemuriform primates in Africa.|$|E

5|$|Archaea flagella operate like {{bacterial}} flagella—their long stalks {{are driven}} by rotatory motors at the base. These motors are powered by the proton gradient across the membrane. However, archaeal flagella are notably different in composition and development. The two types of flagella <b>evolved</b> <b>from</b> different ancestors. The bacterial flagellum shares a common ancestor with the type III secretion system, while archaeal flagella appear to have <b>evolved</b> <b>from</b> bacterial type IV pili. In contrast to the bacterial flagellum, which is hollow and is assembled by subunits moving up the central pore {{to the tip of}} the flagella, archaeal flagella are synthesized by adding subunits at the base.|$|E

40|$|This report {{deals with}} the {{question}} of whether or not, for a given tessellationautomaton, there exists a finite pattern that cannot <b>evolve</b> <b>from</b> a given primitive pattern no matter what sequence of environmental input transformations are applied. This is closely related to Moore's Garden-of-Eden problem. We begin dealing with this question for the simplest nontrivial tessellation automata, namely, one-dimensional binary scope-n tessellation automata. We show that any finite pattern can <b>evolve</b> <b>from</b> the primitive pattern if the neighborhood scope is four or more. We show that there are finite patterns that cannot <b>evolve</b> <b>from</b> the primitive pattern for the scope-two case. Although some partial results are presented, the question is still open for the scope-three case. Some results for more general tessellation automata are also discussed...|$|R

5|$|The {{groups are}} divided {{based on their}} {{alternative}} strategies of parasitizing its host colony (Myrmica ants). The predatory (in which the caterpillar preys on the host ants) and 'cuckoo' (in which the caterpillars feed off of the ants' regurgitation) strategies are derived characteristics from the alcon group, with the predatory strategy having <b>evolved</b> <b>from</b> the teleius group and the cuckoo strategy having <b>evolved</b> <b>from</b> the arion-Phengaris group. Another way these groups are categorized is by {{whether or not they}} release a certain chemical (dorsal nectary organ secretions) {{to attract the attention of}} the host ant. This trait is not as prominent in ancestors of the alcon group and in the M. nausithous, which is part of the teleius group.|$|E
5|$|With its low-crowned teeth, Ferugliotherium {{may have}} been an {{insectivore}} or omnivore, like similar multituberculates such as Mesodma, which is thought to have eaten insects, other arthropods, seeds, and/or nuts. The wear on Ferugliotherium teeth suggests that the animal may have eaten some plant material. The high-crowned sudamericids are thought to have been herbivores feeding on abrasive vegetation, although their precise diet is not known. In the evolutionary history of gondwanatheres, hypsodont teeth are thought to have <b>evolved</b> <b>from</b> brachydont precursors. Gurovich hypothesizes that the anterior molariforms of sudamericids may have <b>evolved</b> <b>from</b> bladelike premolars as seen in Ferugliotherium.|$|E
