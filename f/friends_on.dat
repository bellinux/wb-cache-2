5|$|After the {{produced}} pilot {{lived up}} to NBC's hopes, the series premiered with the name <b>Friends</b> <b>on</b> September 22, 1994, in the coveted Thursday 8:30p.m. timeslot. The pilot aired between Mad About You and Seinfeld, and was watched by almost 22million American viewers. The series was a huge success throughout its run, and was a staple of NBC's Thursday night line-up, dubbed by the network as Must See TV. When Crane told reporters in 2001 that the ninth season was a possibility, critics believed that he was posturing, and {{that at least two}} of the cast members would not sign on for another season. When it was confirmed that Friends would return for a ninth season, the news was mainly about the amount of money—$7million per episode—that it took to bring the series back for another season.|$|E

5|$|Quentin Tarantino {{had been}} working at Video Archives, a video store in Manhattan Beach, California, and {{originally}} planned to shoot the film with his <b>friends</b> <b>on</b> a budget of $30,000 in a 16mm black-and-white format, with producer Lawrence Bender playing a police officer chasing Mr. Pink. Bender gave the script to his acting teacher, whose wife gave the script to Harvey Keitel. Keitel liked it enough to sign as a co-producer so Tarantino and Bender would have an easier job finding funding; with his assistance, they raised $1.5 million. Keitel also paid for Tarantino and Bender to host casting sessions in New York, where the duo found Steve Buscemi, Michael Madsen, and Tim Roth.|$|E

5|$|The {{concept for}} the music video {{is based on the}} lyrics and {{presented}} as a typical Friday for Black. She wakes up and goes to school, meeting her <b>friends</b> <b>on</b> the way. In the evening, after debating whether to sit in the front or back of a convertible, Black and her friends ride the car to a party at 7:45 pm.

Some of those extras became stars in their own right; her friends Benni Cinkle, Amanda Cooper and Hayley Grodt.

The integration of Steamworks on the PlayStation 3 allows Valve to collect data about problems that arise after shipping and push appropriate updates. Valve has stated they do not plan on integrating other PlayStation 3 features, such as 3D television or PlayStation Move support. In June 2012, Valve announced that the PlayStation 3 version would be patched later that year to include support for the PlayStation Move motion controller, and to add the additional content that was previously provided with the Hydra, under the name Portal 2 In Motion. The patch was released in early November 2012. A free co-op add-on for the Portal 2 In Motion content was added in June 2013. Valve said that despite additional support for PlayStation 3 over Xbox 360, the core game is the same on both platforms.|$|E
