5|$|In 1943, {{development}} efforts {{were directed to}} a gun-type fission weapon with plutonium called Thin Man. Initial research on the properties of plutonium was done using cyclotron-generated plutonium-239, which was extremely pure, but could only be created in very small amounts. Los Alamos received the first sample of plutonium <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Clinton</b> X-10 reactor in April 1944 and within days Emilio Segrè discovered a problem: the reactor-bred plutonium had a higher concentration of plutonium-240, resulting in up to five times the spontaneous fission rate of cyclotron plutonium. Seaborg had correctly predicted in March 1943 {{that some of the}} plutonium-239 would absorb a neutron and become plutonium-240.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{completion}} of Literary Hall in 1870, the Clinton Lodge Masons regularly utilized {{the first floor of}} the building as a meeting space, while the Romney Literary Society maintained its use of the second floor as a library. Between its various periods of dormancy, the Clinton Lodge and the associated Order of the Eastern Star, which was organized in July 1919, utilized Literary Hall as a meeting space, and following the Romney Literary Society's disestablishment, the Masons and Eastern Star continued their use of the building. In 1973, prominent Romney lawyer Ralph Haines purchased Literary Hall <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Clinton</b> Lodge Masons and provided the lodge with a land lot for the construction of a new Masonic Temple at the corner of Washington and Center Streets in Romney. Following his purchase of Literary Hall, Haines used the historic building as a law office building and private museum. Literary Hall was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on May 29, 1979.|$|E

25|$|Zelikow was {{appointed}} {{executive director of the}} 9/11 Commission, whose work included examination of the conduct of presidents Clinton and George W. Bush and their administrations. Zelikow's prior involvement with the administration of George W. Bush led to opposition from the 9/11 Family Steering Committee, citing the obvious conflict of interest of having previously worked on the Bush transition team. The Commission's Republican chair and Democratic vice—chair strongly defended Zelikow, both at the time and later. In response to the concerns, Zelikow had agreed to recuse himself from any investigation matters pertaining to the National Security Council's transition <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Clinton</b> to Bush administrations, which Zelikow had helped manage.|$|E

25|$|In October 1995, Shakur's {{case was}} on appeal {{but because of}} his {{considerable}} legal fees, he could not raise the $1.4 million bail. After serving nine months of his sentence, Shakur was released <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Clinton</b> Correctional Facility on October 12, 1995, {{due in large part}} to the help and influence of Suge Knight, the CEO of Death Row Records, who posted a $1.4 million bail pending appeal of the conviction, in exchange for Shakur releasing three albums under the Death Row label. On April 5, 1996, a judge sentenced him to serve 120 days in jail for violating terms of his release on bail.|$|E
25|$|Elders drew fire, {{as well as}} censure <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Clinton</b> administration, {{when she}} {{suggested}} that legalizing drugs might help reduce crime and that the idea should be studied. On December 15, 1993, around one week after making these comments, charges were filed against her son Kevin, for selling cocaine in an incident involving undercover officers, four months prior. Elders believes the incident was a frame-up and {{the timing of the}} charges was designed to embarrass her and the president. Kevin Elders was convicted, and he was sentenced to 10 years in prison. He appealed his conviction to the Arkansas Supreme Court, and that court reaffirmed the conviction. The court held that Mr. Elders failed to show that he was entrapped into making the narcotics sale. There was no further appeal.|$|E

Some Republicans felt that the compromise reached with Clinton on the budget and tax act was inadequate, however Gingrich has stated that the tax cuts were a significant accomplishment for the Republican Congress in the face of opposition <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Clinton</b> administration. Gingrich along with Bob Dole had earlier set-up the Kemp Commission, headed by former US Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Jack Kemp, a tax reform commission that made several recommendations including that dividends, interest, and capital gains should be untaxed.|$|E

Obama had outspent Clinton three to one in Pennsylvania, but his comment at a San Francisco fundraiser that small-town Americans [...] "cling" [...] to guns and religion drew sharp criticism <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Clinton</b> campaign and may have hurt his chances in the Keystone State. In addition, Clinton had several advantages in Pennsylvania. Throughout the primary process, she relied on the support of older, white, working class voters. Pennsylvania held a closed primary, which means that only registered Democrats could vote, and, according to Ron Elving of NPR, the established Democratic electorate [...] "was older, whiter, more Catholic and more working-class than {{in most of the}} primaries to date." [...] After Pennsylvania, Obama had a higher number of delegates and popular votes than Clinton did and was still in a stronger position to win the nomination.
