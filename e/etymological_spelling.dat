50|$|The {{language}} law of 1941 promulgated purity as a policy, {{and tried}} to eliminate internationalisms, stigmatized Serbisms and introduced <b>etymological</b> <b>spelling</b> (korijenski pravopis).|$|E
50|$|Federico Krutwig also {{promoted}} {{the creation of}} an alternative literary dialect, this time based on the Renaissance Labourdine used by Joanes Leizarraga the first translator of the Protestant Bible. It also featured an <b>etymological</b> <b>spelling.</b>|$|E
50|$|Note for Portuguese:k, w and y {{were part}} of the {{alphabet}} until several spelling reforms during the 20th century, the aim of which was to change the <b>etymological</b> Portuguese <b>spelling</b> into an easier phonetic spelling. These letters were replaced by other letters having the same sound: thus psychologia became psicologia, kioske became quiosque, martyr became mártir, etc. Nowadays k, w, and y are only found in foreign words and their derived terms and in scientific abbreviations (e.g. km, byronismo). These letters are considered part of the alphabet again following the 1990 Portuguese Language Orthographic Agreement, which came into effect on January 1, 2009, in Brazil. See Reforms of Portuguese orthography.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the first}} {{variant of the}} Petrine Russian {{alphabet}} (1707-1708), the letter Ф was eliminated and Fita became {{the only way to}} represent [...] Later (1710) the letter Ф (with the same <b>etymological</b> rule of <b>spelling</b> Ѳ and Ф) was restored and both letters co-existed until the 1918 spelling reform, when Fita was eliminated and replaced by the letter Ef (Ф ф).|$|R
5000|$|Many words now {{written with}} an [...] were written with [...] in Old Spanish, {{although}} it was likely pronounced [...] in most positions (but [...] or [...] before , , [...] and possibly [...] ). The cognates of these words in Portuguese and most other Romance languages have [...] Other words now <b>spelled</b> with an <b>etymological</b> [...] were <b>spelled</b> without any such consonant in Old Spanish (e.g. haber, written aver in Old Spanish); these words have cognates in other Romance languages without [...] (e.g. French avoir, Italian avere, Portuguese haver with silent etymological [...] ).|$|R
5000|$|In English, [...] {{denotes the}} voiced {{bilabial}} stop , as in bib. In English, {{it is sometimes}} silent. This occurs particularly in words ending in , such as lamb and bomb, some of which originally had a /b/ sound, while some had the letter [...] added by analogy (see Phonological history of English consonant clusters). The [...] in debt, doubt, subtle, and related words was added in the 16th century as an <b>etymological</b> <b>spelling,</b> intended to make the words more like their Latin originals (debitum, dubito, subtilis).|$|E
5000|$|On old {{nautical}} charts of the British Virgin Islands, the island's name {{is often}} spelled [...] "Moskito" [...] (possibly as an older spelling of [...] "mosquito" [...] - older {{versions of the}} English language did make greater use of <b>etymological</b> <b>spelling).</b> Although modern charts usually spell the island [...] "Mosquito" [...] Island, and the Land Registry of the British Virgin Islands titles the island as [...] "Mosquito" [...] Island, Richard Branson has expressed a preference for [...] "Moskito" [...] Island, {{and most of the}} publicity material relating to his development has used that spelling.|$|E
50|$|Because of {{this alleged}} continuity, he {{supported}} the purification of the Romanian language by stripping it of non-Latin elements and attempting to bring it as close to Latin as possible. Between 1871 and 1876, Laurian collaborated with Ioan Massim for a two-volume Romanian language dictionary, commissioned by the Romanian Academy. The dictionary was stripped of non-Latin words, including neologisms as replacements for such words, which {{were supposed to be}} eliminated from the language. The dictionary was also written in an <b>etymological</b> <b>spelling</b> system, the result being an artificial language which only vaguely resembled Romanian and it provoked laughter, discrediting the Latinist school.|$|E
50|$|The early 16th {{century was}} also a time of {{innovations}} and change for the French language, especially in its written form. The first book of French grammar was published in 1530, followed nine years later by the language's first dictionary. Since spelling was far less codified than it is now, each author used his own orthography. Rabelais himself developed a personal set of rather complex rules. He was a supporter of <b>etymological</b> <b>spelling,</b> i.e., one that reflects the origin of words, and was thus opposed to those who favoured a simplified spelling, one that reflects the pronunciation of words.|$|E
5000|$|Many, if not most, Lao people {{claim that}} the city's name means [...] "city of the moon", while many also claim {{correctly}} that the city's name means [...] "city of sandalwood" [...] because the words for [...] "moon" [...] ( [...] or [...] from chandra [...] in Sanskrit) and [...] "sandalwood" [...] (ຈັນ or ຈັນທນ໌ from chandana [...] in Sanskrit) are written and pronounced identically as [...] "chan" [...] in modern Lao. Most academic and historic Lao sources {{claim that the}} city's name does in fact mean [...] "city of sandalwood", reinforced by the city's Thai (...) and Khmer (...) names both retain the <b>etymological</b> <b>spelling,</b> which indicates [...] "city of sandalwood".|$|E
50|$|The medieval {{spelling}} of Portuguese {{was mostly}} phonemic, but, from the Renaissance on, many authors who admired classical culture started {{to use an}} etymological orthography. In the early 20th century, however, spelling reforms in Portugal and Brazil reverted the orthography to phonemic principles. Subsequent reforms (Brazil, 1943 and 1971; Portugal, 1945 and 1973) have aimed mainly at three objectives: to eliminate the few traces of redundant <b>etymological</b> <b>spelling</b> that remained, {{to reduce the number}} of words marked with diacritics and hyphens, and to bring the Brazilian spelling standard and the Portuguese spelling standard (used in all the Portuguese speaking countries, except Brazil) closer to each other.|$|E
50|$|People who use {{non-standard}} spelling often {{suffer from}} adverse opinions, as a person's mastery of standard spelling is often equated {{to his or}} her level of formal education or intelligence. Spelling is easier in languages with more or less consistent spelling systems such as Finnish, Serbian, Italian and Spanish, owing to the fact that, either, pronunciation in these languages has changed relatively little since the initial establishment of their spellings systems, or else that non-phonemic etymological spellings have been replaced with phonemic unetymological spellings as pronunciation changes. Predicting spelling is more difficult in languages in which pronunciation has changed significantly since the spelling was fixed, thus yielding a non-phonetic <b>etymological</b> <b>spelling</b> system such as Irish or French. These spelling systems are still 'phonemic' (rather than 'phonetic') since the pronunciation of a word can be systematically derived from the spelling, although the converse (i.e. spelling from pronunciation) may not be possible. English is an extreme example of a defective orthography in which the spelling cannot be systematically derived from pronunciation but also has the more unusual problem that pronunciation cannot be systematically derived from spelling.|$|E
5000|$|In abugida scripts such as Thai and Lao, the {{inherent}} vowel [...] is often unwritten, {{especially in the}} <b>etymological</b> <b>spelling</b> of Thai loan words from Sanskrit, Pali or Khmer, but these are almost always written out in modern Lao spelling. Not all words, even if composed of the same Indic roots, will have {{the inherent}} vowel so the pronunciation of each word must be learned {{on a case-by-case basis}} in Thai. Cf. Thai ธรรมนิตย์, thammanit [...] (TH-R-R-M-N-I-T-Y), 'moral person', vs. ธรรมเกษตร, thamkaset [...] (TH-R-R-M-K-E-S-T-R), 'land of justice'. In Lao and Isan, the trend is to pronounce the vowel regardless of its etymology, which to Thai speakers sounds provincial and uneducated, akin to the mispronunciation of English 'athlete' [...] as *'athelete' [...] in non-standard usage or 'arthritis' as *'arthuritis' [...] Isan speakers would pronounce the ธรรม- root as thamma-, leading to *ธรรมมะนิตย์, thammanit [...] as expected, but also *ธรรมมะเกษตร, *thammakaset [...] akin to Lao ທຳມະນິດ/Archaic ທັມມະນິຕ or ທັມມະນິຕຍ໌ , thammanit (TH-AM-M-M-A-N-I-D), and ທຳມະກະເສດ/Archaic ທັມມະກະເສດ or ທັມມະກເສຕ, thammakasét [...] (TH-AM-M-A-K-A-E-S-D). In Lao spelling, as this vowel is pronounced, it is also always written in modern spelling, which often require insertion of a consonant to represent the phonological gemination.|$|E
40|$|In an <b>etymological</b> <b>spelling</b> such as English, {{in order}} to show dialectal {{features}} of a character 2 ̆ 7 s speech writers use non-standard spelling (eye dialect) which has a long tradition in English literature. Dealing with eye dialect diachronically and synchronically, it is shown that dialect is not represented in a maximally accurate way, but approximated in varying degrees. Although variant spellings for different features can be observed throughout (inconsistencies occur inside one work and in the whole corpus), standardizing tendencies can be observed, which, together with the semantic and syntactic context, make eye dialect more intelligible for the average reader...|$|E
