Explores this process of interaction in a mortgage setting by observing 42 conversations between advisers and 26 clients. The exact content and characteristics of interactions were recorded and coded using a category system based on consultative selling. The results show vast differences between advisers in their selling approach. In most cases, the sequence of problem-solving phases that advisers employed differed from those of the ideal model. Advisers generally did not probe for the wishes of clients but instead started by presenting alternative product solutions, a typical feature of a <b>hard</b> <b>selling</b> approach.

40|$|In the {{development}} circles, microcredit {{has become the}} buzzword. Advocates of microcredit often perceive it as a panacea for poverty alleviation. Historically, microcredit programs were initiated by the women's groups and non-governmental organizations as a potential tool for women's empowerment as poor women gain greater access to financial resources. By and large, microcredit programs have remained localized, functioning within the existing savings and credit facilities. Now attempts are being made to launch microcredit programs {{at the global level}} with new <b>hard</b> <b>selling</b> of it as an anti-poverty formula. The recent trends indicate that microcredit programs are moving away from ‘development as charity ’ model to more profitable ‘development as business’. According to a World Bank recent survey, microcredit lending will reach nearly $ 12 billion worldwide by the end of 1997. In the case of India, not only private donors but a large number of governmental financial institutions (NABARD, SIDBI), bilateral donors (SDC, GTZ), World Bank and other international financial institutions are promoting microcredit programs on a large scale. Even the transnational banks are also jumping on the microcredit bandwagon. It will not be wrong to say {{that there has been a}} flooding of financial resources to carryout microcredit programs i...|$|E

40|$|The {{research}} {{aimed to}} investigate and analyze the influence Adaptive Selling Behavior in Sales-people Performance, specifically in Business to Business Industry. The research also want to elaborate Relationship Initiative as Moderating Variable. The results of this research will help a company who is in Business to Business Industry to better understand how to maximize their sales force {{and to be able}} to create an efficient and effective training program for them. Being able to understand the concept of Adaptive Selling Behavior, will lead the sales-people towards a better way of doing their selling activity. <b>Hard</b> <b>selling</b> will only hurt the company’s image in front of customers, but value-based selling is believed to have a long-term relationship effect. In Business to Business industry, sales-people can not avoid a face to face meeting with their customers. During the meeting and negotiation with customer, sometimes what is happening is totally different with what the sales-people’s scenario already prepared. In this kind of situation, the sales-people must be able to monitor what is going to be happened and ready to modify their actions towards the new situation. The sales-people must be able to read and react, must be able to adapt their move. The study is a survey research directed to explain or confirm the causal relationships of all variables which was carried out by testing several hypotheses. Ability to Monitor, Ability to Modify and Relationship Initiative are used as exogen variables, while Motivation to Practice Adaptive Selling, Adaptive Selling Behavior and Sales-people Performance are the endogen variables. The data of this research is collected from chemicals distribution companies through a questioner. The unit of analysis in this research is the dyadic relationship between sales-people (138 respondents) and their customers (414 respondents). Finally, the data is analized using Structural Equation Modelling Software. The results are consistent with prior research, which indicates that questions regarding the efficacy of adaptive selling continue to exist.

50|$|The {{frequency}} with which either a <b>hard</b> <b>sell</b> or a soft sell is used is dependent upon the intent of its use—the goal of advertising agencies or salespeople. There are times where <b>hard</b> <b>sells</b> are the more rational choice for a sale, and where soft sells are required.|$|R
50|$|A <b>hard</b> <b>sell</b> may {{alienate}} some customers, {{who find}} it off-putting. Sometimes the pressuring nature {{that comes along}} with <b>hard</b> <b>sell</b> tactics can overwhelm a consumer {{to the point where}} they dismiss the sales pitch or turn away from the advertisement altogether. Emotional appeal is more involved in a soft sell and with the absence of this in a <b>hard</b> <b>sell,</b> business can be lost if consumers do not respond well to the tactics, especially when times are hard. During the Great Depression, soft sell tactics, like brand relationship and humor, proved to be successful approaches when selling to consumers. People's inability to spend on luxuries required some wooing to be done in order for a sell to go through. More direct <b>hard</b> <b>sell</b> tactics pushed away already stressed, calloused minded consumers during this time period of economic hardship. There is also criticism of <b>hard</b> <b>sell</b> tactics in regards to lack of creativity on the part of advertisements and sellers, which causes the consumer to never acquire intrigue towards the product being sold.|$|R

Dissatisfaction with <b>hard</b> <b>sell,</b> however, is 'negotiated' and does not outweigh overall satisfaction, suggesting that tours contribute positively to the geopolitical sustainability of the Chinese state.

50|$|A {{soft sell}} {{is much more}} emotionally focused when put in {{comparison}} to a <b>hard</b> <b>sell.</b> An advertisement or seller will attempt to trigger feelings in the buyer that will make them want to buy the product that is being advertised. This selling technique is also much more indirect in nature {{than that of a}} <b>hard</b> <b>sell.</b> The subtlety of a soft sell is very evident, and many buyers often do not realize that they are being purposely directed in such a way to buy a product how a seller predicts that they will. This type of sell's ultimate goal is to create a mood or image that will appeal to the buyer and make them want to invest their money in a product, all without the buyer realizing that this is occurring. Persistence is not as involved in a soft sell as it is in a <b>hard</b> <b>sell.</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{concepts}} that distinguish a <b>hard</b> <b>sell</b> from a soft sell {{have to do}} with directness of an advertiser or seller, rational appeal, and the amount of information given to the buyer about a product. A <b>hard</b> <b>sell</b> is extremely direct in nature. An advertisement will contain a forceful, loud slogan in order to grab buyers' attention, or a salesperson will be very persistent, cornering their buyer into purchasing the product they are <b>selling.</b> In a <b>hard</b> <b>sell,</b> the advertisement or seller will focus heavily {{on the quality of the}} product and explain how purchasing such a product will be a rational decision that will help improve the buyer's life. In this type of sell, an abundance of information is supplied to the buyer in order for them to receive as much information about the perks of the product as possible. The advertisement or seller uses such tactics to overwhelm the buyer with explanations, information, and persistence in order to ultimately create large incentive to purchase what they are selling. This selling tactic is best described as quick and forceful.|$|R
