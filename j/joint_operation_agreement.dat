50|$|Honolulu {{is served}} by one daily Newspaper, The Honolulu Star-Advertiser, owned by Black Press of British Columbia in Canada. The Star-Advertiser began {{publishing}} on June 7, 2010 after Black Press merged Honolulu's two daily newspapers, The Honolulu Advertiser and the Honolulu Star-Bulletin. The Star-Bulletin was the primary competitor to the Advertiser until it scaled back statewide distribution. In 2010 Gannett Company sold the Advertiser to Black Press. The merger was due to a failure to find a buyer for the Star-Bulletin, which had been losing money and subscribers since the two broke off their <b>joint</b> <b>operation</b> <b>agreement</b> in 2001.|$|E

50|$|The main {{exploration}} started officially when {{a cooperative}} contract signed on September 17, 2005 with Mobil Cepu Ltd., {{a subsidiary of}} ExxonMobil as main operator. A <b>Joint</b> <b>Operation</b> <b>Agreement</b> (JOA) between state oil company Pertamina was signed in March 2006. Pertamina and ExxonMobil concluded a 30-year production-sharing contract in which each company would share 45 percent interest in the block. The remaining 10 percent {{would go to the}} local governments. Foreign companies, mainly from China, have started to invest in Bojonegoro in various projects related with the planned exploration and exploitation of the Cepu Block oil fields with total value of US$8 million.

50|$|Euroway {{originally}} planned to operate two cruiseferries on a route connecting Malmö, Sweden to Travemünde, Germany. To achieve that two identical cruiseferries were ordered from Brodosplit, Croatia, {{to be called}} Frans Suell and Frans Kockum. The ships were a somewhat enlarged version of Amorella and Isabella that the shipyard had built for SF Line in 1988 and 1989, respectively. Due to the Croatian War of Independence the delivery of Frans Suell was delayed by nearly a year, from 1991 to 1992. Poor profitability of the route, further delays in construction of the second ship and a <b>joint</b> <b>operations</b> <b>agreement</b> with Silja Line made Euroway decide to cancel the order for Frans Kockum.After the order was cancelled, the ship was renamed Thomas Mann and work on her was continued, but at a more leisurely pace. In March 1994 the Thomas Mann sailed from the shipyard in Split to the Fincantieri shipyard at Trieste, Italy, where finalising touches were put on her. On 2 May 1994 DFDS made a tentative agreement to purchase the ship, and bought her ten days later. The ship was finally delivered on 11 June 1994. From Trieste she sailed to Lloyd Werft, Bremerhaven, Germany, where stern sponsons {{were added to the}} ship for increased stability.|$|R
5000|$|Jack Gallivan {{began working}} for the Kearns Tribune Corporation in Salt Lake City in 1937 and would {{continue}} at the paper for the next 60 years. Over that time he would work in nearly every department of the Tribune's operations. From 1948 to 1960 he served as Assistant Publisher to John F. Fitzpatrick and Secretary of the Corporation. He managed many early Tribune investments, including [...] KALL Radio, [...] KUTV Television and the television equipment supplier TeleMation. Fitzpatrick had secretly negotiated agreements {{leading up to the}} founding of the Newspaper Agency Corporation and the <b>joint</b> <b>operation</b> <b>agreements</b> reached with the LDS owned Deseret News which was signed on August 30, 1952. (The agreement would also bring on a decade long struggle with the Anti-Trust Division of the U.S. Justice Department.) In 1955, while serving as promotion and special projects director for the Kearns-Tribune Corporation, Gallivan procured a franchise license to build a cable TV system for Elko, Nevada, the first in the Western United States. By {{the end of the decade}} the Tribune Corporation was operating 5 systems in Nevada under the name Community Television which in 1962 merged with Western Microwave, Inc, a systems in Montana operated by Bob Magness. The new enterprise Tele-Communications Inc. (TCI) flourished and quickly expanded to 32 systems. In 1968 the corporation went public and was soon the world's largest cable company. Gallivan was periodically a director of TCI through its eventual merger with AT&T in 1998.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, Kenol faced {{numerous}} financial challenges and was placed under receivership. The company {{came out of}} receivership in 1983 and its shareholders resumed full control of the business. In 1986, Kenol and Kobil Petroleum Limited, a Delaware registered holding company that acquired Mobil Oil's assets in Kenya and Uganda in 1984, entered into a <b>joint</b> <b>operations</b> and management <b>agreement.</b> This agreement resulted in the sharing of distribution cost and managerial services thus enabling both companies to lower their operating costs and enhance profitability.|$|R
40|$|Joint Operating Agreements (JOA) {{are well}} {{accepted}} standard agreements {{in the oil}} and gas industry. The basic aim of any JOA is to regulate the relationship of the parties in the Joint Venture: Operator and Non-Operators. The former is responsible to perform the operations on the behalf of the consortium and the latter is responsible to contribute with regards to the financial commitments and expenses of the Joint Venture. However, <b>Joint</b> <b>Operation</b> <b>Agreements</b> typically do not reflect the Non-Operator's perspective, as they traditionally focus on the strong position retained by the Operator. This reality is very clear as the most critical clauses (namely management of operations, limitation of liabilities and removal of the Operator) strengthen the Operator's position, often {{to the detriment of the}} Non-Operators. In consequence, such an unbalanced agreement can cause uncertainly, raises the potential for litigation and might even jeopardize the very existence of the consortium. It is important to note that some parties might still sign such an imbalanced agreement in order to secure investment into a project but they will be subject to these risks, and even ultimately termination of the agreement. However, the decline of production and the lack of new reserves (which together reflect the maturity of an oil and gas area) will lead major companies to leave such region in search for a province with greater rewards. As a matter of consequence, the strongest party of the JOA shall be replaced by smaller companies so as there will be a shift on the JOA context from a dominant position for another in equitable terms. Consequently, there is a need for a new and more balanced approach to the negotiation of Joint Operating Agreements, to apply to new, current operations and mature operations, where the Non-Operator's perspectives are fully considered and properly addressed.

40|$|The {{research}} paper examines {{the incidence of}} sub-optimal effects in successful <b>joint</b> <b>operations,</b> in particular the command function in one successful <b>joint</b> <b>operation.</b> This study has been undertaken because research about <b>joint</b> <b>operations</b> tends to be normative {{and focus on the}} advantages and opportunities in <b>joint</b> <b>operations</b> instead of examining the problems that may arise. Previous research suggests that the command function should be centralized to achieve synergies. It is also suggested that the command function should be decentralized to enable lower command echelons to act on situations occurring in the theatre of operations. Since no existing theories explain this command-dilemma in full, a theory has been developed for the study’s analysis. Research design is that of a single-case study of the German operation Fall Gelb (Case Yellow) 1940. Empirical data has been gathered through written documents covering the selected case. Results of analysis reveal that there were sub-optimal effects in terms of inefficiencies during the operation Fall Gelb and a conclusion can be drawn that successful <b>joint</b> <b>operations</b> also have sub- optimal effects. The study contributes to existing research by providing a more nuanced understanding of <b>joint</b> <b>operations</b> with a focus on sub-optimal aspects. ...|$|R
