5|$|In November 1970, {{the group}} were {{involved}} in a car accident returning from a gig in Basingstoke. The band all suffered shock, and Kaye broke a foot. He had to <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> few gigs, and the album cover's photo shoot, with it in plaster.|$|E
25|$|Shortly {{after his}} return to Kassel, on his 66th birthday, Rundstedt {{received}} a cheque from Hitler for 250,000 Reichsmarks. This was part of Hitler's policy of buying the continuing loyalty of his senior commanders. Many found this offensive, but none turned down these gifts. Rundstedt tried to <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> best thing by failing to cash the cheque. By February this was attracting adverse comment in Berlin, and Rundstedt then cashed it. Some writers have sought to connect Rundstedt's acceptance of this money with his continuing refusal to support the resistance movement against Hitler's regime within the German Army. In fact Rundstedt refused {{to have anything to}} do with the money, handing it over to his daughter-in-law, and it was still untouched at his death in 1953.|$|E
500|$|The role of {{the player}} {{character}} in the main quest was to be changed as well. In contrast to past games, where the player character would play a type of [...] "chosen one", Oblivion would have the player character [...] "find him, protect him, and help him." [...] Aside from that, {{in the opinion of}} Hines, [...] "the main quest has similar themes and tones as in past Elder Scrolls games", and should still feel [...] "epic", simply {{because of the way the}} gamespace is designed: with openness in mind. Improving that aspect of the experience, said Hines, came mostly in the form of improved information presentation. The system would not intrude on the experience when the player merely wishes to [...] "walk around and explore the world and do whatever he/she wants", but given the scenario where the player asks [...] "'OK, I'm ready to <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> part of the main quest, where do I go?'", the game would provide a ready answer, so as to avoid [...] "confusion" [...] and [...] "downtime".|$|E

500|$|Grohl and Jones {{produced}} the record across {{a period of}} one week in October 1994, with Grohl on vocals and all instruments. Both would arrive {{in the morning at}} Robert Lang Studios, start production by noon and do four songs a day. According to Grohl, during the recording process he would run from room to room, [...] "still sweating and shaking from playing drums and [...] pick up the guitar and put down a track, do the bass, maybe another guitar part, have a sip of coffee and then go in and <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> song". The only performance by an outsider was a guitar part on [...] "X-Static" [...] provided by Greg Dulli of The Afghan Whigs, who was watching Grohl record the songs. Grohl eventually asked him if he wanted to play and handed him a guitar. Each song took about 45 minutes to be completed, and the compositions were recorded in the same order that became the album's track listing. The only song that required two run-throughs before completion was [...] "I'll Stick Around". Grohl was insecure about his singing, and added effects to his voice in [...] "Floaty", and tried to enhance the performance through double track – [...] "You know how people double their vocals to make them stronger? That album the vocals are quadrupled." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Clown"'s concept {{deals with}} an {{incident}} that happened in San Diego, California. A skinhead that told Davis to [...] "go back to Bakersfield" [...] attempted to hit Davis but he dodged and the band's road manager, Jeff, knocked the skinhead out. [...] "Helmet in the Bush" [...] was about Davis' drug abuse, and the fear that gripped him {{at the height of}} his drug problem. He pleaded for a divine intervention to deliver him from his nightmare, as if he cannot help himself. Davis explained: [...] "I'd wake up in the morning and do a line to get out of bed. Speed in the morning, I'd have it all lined up for breakfast so when I'd lay down and go to sleep, I'd wake up and just snort and it's like 'Yeah, okay, I'm up. ' It was bad. It's like, you do one line and stay up all night, but then you have shit to <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> day so you have to do another line to be able keep staying up to get that shit done. Eventually you start spinning-out from sleep deprivation. You get hallucinations and shit like that." [...] Davis said that [...] "Helmet in the Bush" [...] "is about meth. It's about when you do meth and you look down at your dick and it's literally a helmet in the bush [...] ". [...] "Basically it's what happens when you do too much drugs and your girl wanna get with you and you got some man problems down below. Just another reason not to do drugs, children," [...] Fieldy elaborated.|$|E
2500|$|Farage {{strongly}} {{opposes the}} use of bailouts and says that [...] "buying your own debt with taxpayers' money" [...] will {{not solve the problem}} and that, [...] "if we <b>do,</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> debt crisis won't be a country... it will be the European Central Bank itself".|$|E

2500|$|A story [...] from Amsterdam, 1345, {{claims that}} a priest {{was called to}} {{administer}} Viaticum to a dying man. He told the family that if the man threw up, they were to take the contents and {{throw it in the}} fire. The man threw up, and the family did what the priest had advised them to <b>do.</b> <b>The</b> <b>next</b> morning, one of the women went to rake the fire and noticed the Host sitting on the grate, unscathed and surrounded by a light. It has apparently passed through both the man's digestive system and the fire unscathed. [...] The story is commemorated with an annual silent procession through central Amsterdam.|$|E
2500|$|His {{season was}} {{abruptly}} interrupted, however, when Hirsh {{went on the}} disabled list again after his right fibula was broken in a game August 7. [...] Not realizing his leg had been broken on a line drive comebacker hit by the second batter of the game, J. J. Hardy, that caught him in the shin in the first inning, Hirsh went on to throw out Hardy and pitch six innings that day, earning a key win for the club. [...] Asked what he would <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> time he faced Hardy, Hirsh joked: [...] "I might put a catcher's shin guard on, just for him." [...] The injury ended his season. [...] "I was crushed," [...] Hirsh said. [...] "Obviously, nobody wants to have someone tell them that their season's cut short." ...|$|E
2500|$|Cliff Gallup {{left the}} band in 1956, and Russell Williford joined {{as the new}} guitarist for the Blue Caps. Williford played and toured Canada with Vincent in late 1956 but left the group in early 1957. Gallup came back to <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> album and then left again. Williford came back and exited again before Johnny Meeks joined the band. The group had another hit in 1957 with [...] "Lotta Lovin'" [...] (highest {{position}} number 13 and spending 19 weeks on the Billboard chart and number 17 and 17 weeks on the Cashbox chart). Vincent was awarded gold records for two million sales of [...] "Be-Bop-A-Lula", and 1.5million sales of [...] "Lotta Lovin'". The same year he toured {{the east coast of}} Australia with Little Richard and Eddie Cochran, drawing audiences totaling 72,000 to their Sydney Stadium concerts. Vincent also made an appearance in the film The Girl Can't Help It, with Jayne Mansfield, performing [...] "Be-Bop-A-Lula" [...] with the Blue Caps in a rehearsal room.|$|E

6000|$|... "'Tis for thy good {{we do this}} to thee!" [...] said Shadow, solemnly, {{and then}} <b>the</b> <b>next</b> victim was treated to a similar dose.

2500|$|Subjectivity is {{that which}} the individual—and no one else—has. But {{what does it mean}} to have {{something}} like this? It cannot be understood in the same way as having a car or a bank account. It means to be someone who is becoming someone—it means being a person with a past, a present, and a future. No one can have an individual's past, present or future. Different people experience these in various ways—these experiences are unique, not anyone else's. Having a past, present, and future means that a person is an existing individual—that a person can find meaning in time and by existing. Individuals do not think themselves into existence, they are born. But once born and past a certain age, the individual begins to make choices in life; now those choices can be his, his parents', society’s, etc. The important point is that to exist, the individual must make choices—the individual must decide what to <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> moment and on into the future. What the individual chooses and how he chooses will define who and what he is—to himself and to others. Kierkegaard put it this way in Works of Love, 1847: ...|$|E
2500|$|According to the {{production}} mixer, Michael Evje, the film began shooting at the Los Angeles Olympic Auditorium on April 16, 1979. Grips hung huge curtains of black duvetyne on all four sides of the ring area to contain the artificial smoke used extensively for visual effect. On May 7, {{the production}} moved to the Culver City [...] Studio, Stage 3, and filmed there {{until the middle of}} June. Scorsese made it clear during filming that he did not appreciate the traditional way in films of showing fights from the spectators' view. He insisted that one camera operated by the Director of Photography, Michael Chapman, would be placed inside the ring as he would play the role of an opponent keeping {{out of the way of}} other fighters so that viewers could see the emotions of the fighters, including those of Jake. The precise moves of the boxers were to be done as dance routines from the information of a book about dance instructors in the mode of Arthur Murray. A punching bag in the middle of the ring was used by De Niro between takes before he aggressively came straight on to <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> scene. The initial five-week schedule for the shooting of the boxing scenes took longer than expected, putting Scorsese under pressure.|$|E
2500|$|Spielberg {{suggested}} that Boam write the next draft, and Lucas agreed to it. Boam felt some nervousness {{going into the}} process. He joked that [...] "the battlefield was littered with writers before I came on to the scene. There were four or five before me. Each writer had their script next to them covered with blood." [...] Boam said that when Spielberg called to offer him the job, Spielberg said [...] "something like, 'You wanna get real rich?' and I said, 'Yeah, why?' and he said, 'I think you should <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> Indiana Jones movie.'" [...] Boam {{is reported to have}} replied to Spielberg's offer by saying, [...] "I just don't know why you didn't come to me before." [...] Boam spent two weeks filled with eight-hour days working with Lucas to develop the story. The two blocked out all other commitments to create the story, building it [...] "beat by beat". Lucas already knew many of the set pieces that were to be in the movie. During the two-week story conference, Boam worked to incorporate it all into the new narrative. [...] "Jeff was very collaborative," [...] Lucas said, adding, [...] "He'd try to include both Steven's ideas and my ideas, and tried to get what we wanted done." ...|$|E
