50|$|Shew Hall, the {{original}} <b>hospital</b> <b>structure,</b> {{was built in}} 1867. It functions as the administrative building and {{is the focal point}} of the institution. This large structure is named in honor of the hospital's first superintendent, Dr. Abram M. Shew. Designed by Addison Hutton of Philadelphia, it was constructed in the Second Empire style. The building was remodeled in 1939, when the interior was updated and a flat roof bordered by a parapet was installed on the main section. The three large wings display mansard roofs and details that are indicative of the main section's former appearance.|$|E
50|$|Whilst the {{integration}} of the asylum into the <b>hospital</b> <b>structure</b> may have alleviated some of the pressure for the Queensland government, over expenditure and crowding stretched hospital facilities to their limit, resulting in requests from the Hospital Committee for the asylum to be removed. In 1863 the hospital committee resolved that the hospital and asylum should be separate institutions. It was suggested this new facility could be a combined benevolent asylum and orphanage. The new building would initially house men until funds became available for further extensions when women and children could also be relocated from the hospital.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} <b>hospital</b> <b>structure</b> {{was destroyed}} on October 18, 1935, when a major earthquake struck Helena. The current historic main hospital building {{was built in}} 1937-1939 to replace it. This structure is a T-shaped, two-story, concrete building with a basement. The Helena office of J. G. Link & Company were the architects of this Art Deco/Early Moderne design, which includes a flat roof, colored concrete, and diamond-shaped tiles. The south side has a central entrance. There are many bays and windows around {{the exterior of the}} building. The interior floorplan has remained essentially {{the same as it was}} in 1939.

The hospital's plan became a prototype for a generation of institutions for the treatment of the mentally ill nationwide. The surviving 1859 building was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1965.|$|R

San Raffaele University is a private university but all the professors teaching there do have the same status as public university professors and must have undergone a national selection as all other university professors in the country, such as the case of the Università Cattolica or the Bocconi University in Milan.|$|E
50|$|The {{foundation}} {{of the church is}} connected with the Catacombs of San Gennaro, the largest Christian catacomb complex in southern Italy. The first structure was probably the result of the fusion of two ancient burial sites, one from the 2nd century CE that contained the remains of Saint Agrippinus of Naples, the first patron saint of Naples, and the site from the 4th century CE that contained the remains of San Gennaro, the now traditional patron saint of the city.This ancient basilica was then reformed in the fourth century AD and expanded between the 11th and 15th centuries. The church became a hospital in 1648. The church is still contained within the complex of the larger <b>hospital</b> <b>structure.</b> The premises provide access to the extensive catacombs themselves.|$|E
50|$|Like {{other women}} doctors of the time, Ripley {{found that most}} of her {{patients}} were women and young children who often had trouble accessing hospital care; for instance, no Minneapolis hospitals of the era would admit a pregnant woman who was unmarried. So Ripley started a new hospital run by and for women, especially women in economically straightened circumstances. Incorporated in 1887, her Maternity Hospital—later renamed Ripley Memorial Hospital—remained in operation until 1957, when it was closed due to low occupancy and funding problems. The <b>hospital</b> <b>structure</b> was sold, and the proceeds were used to create the Ripley Memorial Foundation. Since 1993, the foundation has focused on supporting programs that prevent teenage pregnancies. In 2007, the hospital building was converted into apartments and renamed Ripley Gardens, a redevelopment {{funded in part by}} the National Trust for Historic Preservation.|$|E
50|$|In 1613, work {{started on}} the {{construction}} of major <b>hospital</b> <b>structures.</b> The old chapel was demolished and a new one was established in July 1621 by the Archbishop of Embrun.

The chapel still stands at the corner of the boulevard Saint-Germain and the rue des Saints-Pères. The French National Academy of Medicine had its offices in this chapel from 1850 to 1902.|$|R
