500|$|According to Slant Magazines Eric Henderson, The Beatles is {{a rarity}} among the band's {{recorded}} works, {{in that it}} [...] "resists reflexive canonisation, which, along with society's continued fragmentation, keeps the album fresh and surprising". In his review for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine said that because of its wide variety of musical styles, the album can be [...] "a frustratingly scattershot record or a singularly gripping musical experience, depending on your view". He concludes: [...] "None of <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> was meant to share album space together, but somehow The Beatles creates its own style and sound through its mess."

The first song written and recorded for the album was the title track itself which she wrote in Liverpool and Manchester, England, described by Gaga as a [...] "magical message" [...] song. She wrote it in ten minutes and compared the process to an Immaculate Conception. White Shadow, one of the producers of the track, credited Gaga for {{coming up with the}} idea and the theme behind the song. [...] "We recorded it around the world, on the road, in whatever was available. <b>It</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> reads, but not like you think until you hear it," [...] he added.

500|$|Leavin {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} music critics. The album {{was called a}} [...] "treat for any Cole fan" [...] by Andy Kellman of AllMusic, who drew attention to how <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> was recorded at a [...] "leisurely pace". Continuing this thought, Kellman noted that Cole was [...] "breez through an easygoing set of covers". The BBC's Chris Rogers defined the album as [...] "an ultra smooth mix of standards both tasteful and obtuse". Jay S. Jacobs of PopEntertainment.com compared Leavin [...] to Cole's 1999 release, Snowfall on the Sahara, and viewed it as [...] "jazzy but decidedly more modern and surprisingly strong". Peoples Ralph Novak, Chuck Arnold, V. R. Peterson, and Monica Rizzo commended Cole's decision to [...] "ditch the evening-gown fare on her new CD" [...] by recording more contemporary songs. Gugu Mkhabela from News24 awarded the album three out of five stars, describing the material as [...] "pure old school with a modern twist", with Cole providing [...] "a touch of class and some depth to boot".|$|E

5000|$|Buddy Emmons covered [...] "Nothing Was Delivered" [...] on his 1975 album Steel Guitar. [...] Allmusic critic Eugene Chadbourne {{disliked the}} recording, stating that <b>it</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> was being {{played by a}} wedding band.

500|$|Jody Rosen of Rolling Stone {{believed}} [...] "Fifteen" [...] was exemplary in that [...] "Swift is a songwriting savant with {{an intuitive}} gift for verse-chorus-bridge architecture". Rosen compared her songwriting in the track {{to that of}} producers Dr. Luke and Max Martin, who he referred to as [...] "Swedish pop gods". He continued, [...] "Her music mixes an almost impersonal professionalism — it's so rigorously crafted <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> has been scientifically engineered in a hit factory — with confessions that are squirmingly intimate and true." [...] Jonathon Keefe of Slant Magazine considered the bridge one of the nicer moments of Fearless, but was unimpressed with Swift's singing, particularly in the outro. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic found [...] "Fifteen", in which Swift portrayed {{the role of a}} big sister instead of a big star, {{to be one of the}} best and the most personal song on Fearless. Ken Tucker of Billboard magazine believed [...] "Fifteen" [...] could appeal with teenagers looking for hope and adult women reminiscing the past. Leah Greenbelt of Entertainment Weekly stated, [...] "When she sings about sexuality, she sounds like a real teen, not some manufactured vixen-Lolita".|$|E
500|$|The {{album is}} a [...] "kaleidoscopic blend of pop, prog, punk, psych, and electronica". Drowned in Sound {{describes}} it as similar to Guerrilla with [...] "Beach Boys-esque psychedelic pop ... put to techno undertones" [...] while the NME has called Rings Around the World an [...] "expensive, glossy production ... lush and widescreen" [...] and suggested that it [...] "reaches for an effect so modern that at times <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> could've {{been made in the}} '80s". The first single, [...] "Juxtapozed with U", is reminiscent of both the Philadelphia soul music of the 1970s, and the [...] "plastic" [...] approximation of that music on David Bowie's 1975 album Young Americans, while [...] "No Sympathy" [...] has been described as the [...] "missing link between Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young-scatted harmonies, jungle hi-hats and berserk sampler techno". The Dallas Observer compared [...] "It's Not the End of the World?" [...] to tunes such as The Kinks' [...] "Waterloo Sunset", Dennis Wilson's [...] "Forever" [...] and Jack Bruce's [...] "Theme for an Imaginary Western" [...] while The Big Issue called [...] "Sidewalk Serfer Girl" [...] "surf-punk electro pop". Elsewhere on the album the eclectic range of sounds continues from the trip hop of [...] " [...] Touch Sensitive" [...] to the Status Quo-esque [...] "(Drawing) Rings Around the World" [...] and the [...] "electro country rock" [...] of [...] "Run! Christian, Run!".|$|E

It's 27 years later. And I have to say, I love Lydia Deetz so much. She was such {{a huge part of}} me. I would be really interested in what she is doing 27 years later." [...] Ryder confirmed that she would only consider making a sequel if Burton and Keaton were involved. In December 2014, Burton stated, [...] "It's a character that I love and I miss actually working with Michael. There's only one Betelgeuse. We're working on a script and I think it's probably closer than ever and I'd love to work with him again." [...] In January 2015, writer Grahame-Smith told Entertainment Weekly that the script was finished and that he and Burton intended to start filming Beetlejuice 2 {{by the end of the}} year, and that both Keaton and Ryder would return in their respective roles. In August 2015, on Late Night with Seth Meyers, Ryder confirmed she would be reprising her role in the sequel. In May 2016, Burton stated, [...] "It's something that I really would like to do in the right circumstances, but it's one of those films where it has to be right. It's not a kind of a movie that cries out , it's not the Beetlejuice trilogy. So it's something that if the elements are right—because I do love the character and Michael's amazing as that character, so yeah we'll see. But there's nothing concrete yet." ...|$|E

[...] "After a while, the gunfire seemed to start dying down, and then people started to go outside and they started talking. We seemed to be feeling pretty good, but then out of nowhere, the huge gunfire just went off" [...] Deryck said. [...] "This war was so unpredictable. At one point, <b>it</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> was far away, and at another point, <b>it</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> was right outside the door.

Waters described the riots as a rebellion, saying [...] "If you call it a riot <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> was {{just a bunch of}} crazy people who went out and did bad things for no reason. I maintain it was somewhat understandable, if not acceptable." [...] In her view, the violence was “a spontaneous reaction to a lot of injustice.” [...] In regards to the looting of Korean-owned stores by local black residents, she said: “There were mothers who took {{this as an opportunity to}} take some milk, to take some bread, to take some shoes...

Its cover had [...] "a graphic {{drawing of the}} {{offending}} flaccid appendage draped over a sesame seed bun with lashings of bloody sauce." [...] Posters with a similar image that advertised the group had them banned at some venues. National youth radio station Triple J criticised the group as being immature {{and told them to}} [...] "grow up". The EP was described as having [...] "good songs but <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> was recorded under a doona" [...] and had the group banned from some radio stations and retail outlets. One of its tracks, [...] "I Wish I Was as Credible as Roger Climpson" [...] (aka [...] "Roger"), attracted attention of its subject, Roger Climpson – a Seven News anchor on TV – who posed with the group for a photo. The E.P also features fan favourites [...] "Chemotherapy", and a cover of the TV series theme [...] "Home And Away". The E.P featured an alternate cover depicting rabbits on the flipside of the liftout to appease record stores or people who may have been offended by the original artwork. In October of that year, they released a single, [...] "Sorry About the Ruse", on their own label, How Much Did I Fucking Pay For This Records?

60|$|As {{will be seen}} later on, Pygmalion needs, not a preface, but a sequel, which I have {{supplied}} in its due place. The English have {{no respect}} for their language, and will not teach their children to speak it. They spell it so abominably that no man can teach himself what <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like.</b> <b>It</b> is impossible for an Englishman to open his mouth without making some other Englishman hate or despise him. German and Spanish are accessible to foreigners: English is not accessible even to Englishmen. The reformer England needs today is an energetic phonetic enthusiast: that is why I have made such a one the hero of a popular play. There have been heroes of that kind crying in the wilderness for many years past. When I {{became interested in the}} subject {{towards the end of the}} eighteen-seventies, Melville Bell was dead; but Alexander J. Ellis was still a living patriarch, with an impressive head always covered by a velvet skull cap, for which he would apologize to public meetings in a very courtly manner. He and Tito Pagliardini, another phonetic veteran, were men whom it was impossible to dislike. Henry Sweet, then a young man, lacked their sweetness of character: he was about as conciliatory to conventional mortals as Ibsen or Samuel Butler. His great ability as a phonetician (he was, I think, the best of them all at his job) would have entitled him to high official recognition, and perhaps enabled him to popularize his subject, but for his Satanic contempt for all academic dignitaries and persons in general who thought more of Greek than of phonetics. Once, in the days when the Imperial Institute rose in South Kensington, and Joseph Chamberlain was booming the Empire, I induced the editor of a leading monthly review to commission an article from Sweet on the imperial importance of his subject. When it arrived, it contained nothing but a savagely derisive attack on a professor of language and literature whose chair Sweet regarded as proper to a phonetic expert only. The article, being libelous, had to be returned as impossible; and I had to renounce my dream of dragging its author into the limelight. When I met him afterwards, for the first time for many years, I found to my astonishment that he, who had been a quite tolerably presentable young man, had actually managed by sheer scorn to alter his personal appearance until he had become a sort of walking repudiation of Oxford and all its traditions. It must have been largely in his own despite that he was squeezed into something called a Readership of phonetics there. The future of phonetics rests probably with his pupils, who all swore by him; but nothing could bring the man himself into any sort of compliance with the university, to which he nevertheless clung by divine right in an intensely Oxonian way. I daresay his papers, if he has left any, include some satires that may be published without too destructive results fifty years hence. He was, I believe, not in the least an ill-natured man: very much the opposite, I should say; but he would not suffer fools gladly.|$|E
