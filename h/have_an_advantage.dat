5|$|Since almost its {{inception}} in 1914, Grapico was associated with real grape juice by J. Grossman's Sons through its advertisements and business stationery. Publicly associating Grapico with genuine grape juice allowed J. Grossman's Sons to compete directly with real grape juice producers such as Welch Grape Juice Co. and <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>advantage</b> over other imitation grape flavored beverage producers. A problem with this approach was that Grapico was an artificial grape drink that included neither real grape juice nor fruit from the grape.|$|E

25|$|One of Petrosian's {{most famous}} {{examples}} of the positional exchange sacrifice is from his game against Samuel Reshevsky in Zurich 1953.

Petrosian realized {{he was in a}} difficult position because of the passive placement of his pieces, relegated to defensive roles.

Faced with these threats, Petrosian devised a plan to maneuver his knight to the square d5, where it would be prominently placed in the center, and blockade the advance of White's pawns.|$|E
