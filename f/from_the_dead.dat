5|$|At {{the end of}} {{the temple}} {{farthest}} from the door was a substantial monument to Robert Petre, a renowned 18th-century horticulturist. Executed in stucco and probably crafted by Roubiliac, it depicted an angel blowing the last trump, causing a stone pyramid to crumble and revealing the corpse within to be rising <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>dead.</b>|$|E
5|$|Hebron {{glass was}} {{traditionally}} produced using sand {{from the village}} of Bani Na'im, east of Hebron, and sodium carbonate taken <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dead</b> Sea. Instead of sand, recycled glass is the primary raw material used to make Hebron glass today.|$|E
5|$|It was {{not until}} 1 February that the deaths were {{reported}} to Defra.

Another 1,500 birds died on 2 February. Then on 3 February 2007 the H5N1 causation was confirmed.|$|E

5|$|A nearby {{mountain}} {{was named}} Jabal ad-Dik ("Mount of the Rooster") {{because of a}} traditional story. According to the tradition, a Jew that lived in Jifna had visited Jerusalem during the Passion. Seeing Jesus rise <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>dead,</b> the man immediately converted and told his wife what he saw. His wife refused to believe him unless the rooster she had just killed {{would come back to}} life. Instantly, the rooster flew away towards the mountain. The story was recited in some monasteries on Holy Thursday together with other biblical readings.|$|E
5|$|A seventeen-year-old girl, Lisa Donovan (Alice Kremelberg), is {{declared}} brain dead at {{a hospital}} and is pulled off life support. While the doctors remove her organs for donation, she suddenly comes back <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>dead</b> and yells highly classified naval missile codes. Fringe Division arrives to investigate, along with a naval officer; he tells them the codes are tied to a missing sailor called Andrew Rusk (Chazz Menendez). Lisa is unaware of the numbers or Rusk, but suddenly starts speaking Russian while Olivia (Anna Torv), Peter (Joshua Jackson), and Walter (John Noble) question her. The naval officer informs them that Rusk is fluent in the language.|$|E
5|$|A {{teaspoon}} of seawater contains about 50 million viruses. Most {{of these are}} bacteriophages, which are harmless to plants and animals, and are in fact essential to the regulation of marine and freshwater ecosystems; however, they are also important mortality agents of phytoplankton, {{the base of the}} foodchain in aquatic environments. They infect and destroy bacteria in aquatic microbial communities, and {{are one of the most}} important mechanisms of recycling carbon and nutrient cycling in marine environments. The organic molecules released <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>dead</b> bacterial cells stimulate fresh bacterial and algal growth, in a process known as the viral shunt. Viral activity may also affect the biological pump, the process whereby carbon is sequestered in the deep ocean.|$|E

5|$|After Jesus' death, his {{followers}} said he rose <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>dead,</b> although exact {{details of their}} experiences are unclear. Some of those {{who claimed to have}} witnessed Jesus' resurrection later died for their belief, which indicates that their beliefs were likely genuine. According to Sanders, the Gospel reports contradict each other, which, according to him, suggests competition among those claiming to have seen him first rather than deliberate fraud. On the other hand, L. Michael White suggests that inconsistencies in the Gospels reflect differences in the agendas of their unknown authors. The followers of Jesus formed a community to wait for his return and the founding of his kingdom.|$|E
5|$|After Vali's death, Sugriva acquires Vali's kingdom {{as well as}} Tara. The Ramayana {{does not}} record any formal {{marriage}} or any ritual purification—like the trial by fire Sita had to undergo when she is reacquired by Rama from Ravana—that Tara must undertake to marry Sugriva or return to Vali following his return <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>dead.</b> The lack of the description of formal marriage suggests, according to some critics, that Tara's relationship to Sugriva is neither widow re-marriage nor polyandry, but simply appropriation by Sugriva. In the references of the coronation of Sugriva as king, Angada is also described as the heir-apparent crown prince, while Tara is mentioned as Sugriva's wife. The Adhyatma Ramayana declares that Sugriva acquires Tara.|$|E
5|$|Alboin came to {{the throne}} {{after the death of}} his father, {{sometime}} between 560 and 565. As was customary among the Lombards, Alboin took the crown after an election by the tribe's freemen, who traditionally selected the king <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>dead</b> sovereign's clan. Shortly afterwards, in 565, a new war erupted with the Gepids, now led by Cunimund, Thurisind's son. The cause of the conflict is uncertain, as the sources are divided; the Lombard Paul the Deacon accuses the Gepids, while the Byzantine historian Menander Protector places the blame on Alboin, an interpretation favoured by historian Walter Pohl.|$|E

5|$|Among the Romani people, mullo (literally {{one who is}} dead) are {{believed}} to return <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>dead</b> and cause malicious acts as well as drink human blood, most often that of a relative or {{the person who had}} caused their death. Other potential victims were those who did not properly observe the burial ceremonies or kept the deceased's possessions instead of properly destroying them. Female vampires could return, lead a normal life and even marry but would eventually exhaust the husband with their sexual appetite. Similar to other European beliefs, male vampires could father children, known as dhampirs, who could be hired to detect and get rid of vampires.|$|E
5|$|As Vandygriff and his {{men began}} pulling back from the mountain, North Korean fire was falling in the platoon area from nearly all directions. The squad leaders started {{to break up the}} weapons that the platoon could not take out with them. At this time they {{discovered}} Brown was dead. Vandygriff told his troops not to remove the identification tags <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>dead</b> they would be leaving behind, as the tags would be the only means of identification later. Vandygriff put his platoon in a V formation and led them off the hill by the same trail they had ascended, picking up four wounded men on the way down.|$|E
5|$|As well as plant based poisons, {{there are}} others that are made {{that are based on}} animals. For example, the larva or pupae of a beetle genus of the Northern Kalahari Desert is used to create a {{slow-acting}} poison that can be quite useful when hunting. The beetle itself is applied to the arrow head, by squeezing the contents of the beetle right onto the head. Plant sap is then mixed and serves as an adhesive. However, instead of the plant sap, a powder made <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>dead,</b> eviscerated larva can be used.|$|E

5|$|Black has {{the blood}} tested, and finds it {{free of any}} pathogen; meanwhile, the {{government}} center running the earlier briefing has vanished. Black realizes he was tricked into finding Zero for an ulterior motive, eventually learning that the organisation responsible is carrying out medical experiments on the homeless, and may be tied to the Millennium Group. Elsewhere a homeless man, acting similarly to Zero, attacks two policemen, and is killed in response. Black and fellow Group member Peter Watts (Terry O'Quinn) investigate, but are clearly not welcome. Black manages to obtain a blood sample <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>dead</b> man, and finds a stretcher tag which he believes {{is connected to the}} United States Department of Energy.|$|E

While unconscious during his battle with Megatron, Prime encountered the presence of Nova Prime, and he meets with Nova's once-associate, Omega Supreme. Monstructor escapes his prison and seeks revenge against Omega. He finds Omega along with Prime, and after battling him, Prime leaves Monstructor to be tended by Jetfire. Elsewhere, Blaster's body is recovered from space. After more assassination attempts he discovers the traitor is an unwilling Beachcomber, controlled by Soundwave and Bombshell's cerebro shell. Angry, he vows to hunt down Soundwave.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} stages of development, {{hitherto}} unknown information contained within undamaged DNA would be enough to bring others back <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>dead</b> including their memories and personality. This would be done by taking a small sample from someone's body and preserving it at the time when the level of the brain's efficiency and knowledge is highest. On the day of death, a cell would be taken from the sample for the cloning to take place, and the memories and personality would be restored to their peak level.|$|E
