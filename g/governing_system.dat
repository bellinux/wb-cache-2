25|$|His early findings, {{which were}} based on {{observations}} from LSD research, uncovered four major types of experiences that, according to Grof, correspond to levels in the human unconscious: (1) Abstract and aesthetic experiences; (2) Psychodynamic experiences; (3) Perinatal experiences; (4) Transpersonal experiences. Grof returns to many of these findings in later books. Psychodynamic levels, which correspond {{to the theory of}} Sigmund Freud, is the area of biographical memories, emotional problems, unresolved conflicts and fantasies. Perinatal levels, which correspond to the theories of Otto Rank, is the area of physical pain and agony, dying and death, biological birth, aging, disease and decrepitude. Transpersonal levels, corresponding to the theories of C.G. Jung, is the area of a number of spiritual, paranormal and transcendental experiences, including ESP phenomena, ego transcendence and other states of expanded consciousness. In order to bring structure to the psychodynamic and perinatal levels Grof introduces two governing systems, or organizing principles: The COEX-system, which is the <b>governing</b> <b>system</b> for the psychodynamic level, and the Basic Perinatal Matrices, which represent the birthing stages and is the <b>governing</b> <b>system</b> for the perinatal level.|$|E
25|$|When Canada {{declared}} war in 1939, women felt obligated {{to help the}} fight. In October 1938, the Women’s Volunteer Service was established in Victoria, British Columbia. A recruitment event was held in hopes of gaining around 20 new volunteers; over 100 women arrived to join the efforts. Shortly after, more British Columbian women {{felt the need to}} do their part, and when the 13 corps joined together the B.C. Women’s Service Corps was created. Soon after, all the other Canadian provinces and territories followed suit and similar volunteer groups emerged. “Husbands, brothers, fathers, boyfriends were all joining up, doing something to help win the war. Surely women could help as well!” In addition to the Red Cross, several volunteer corps had designed themselves after auxiliary groups from Britain. These corps had uniforms, marching drills and a few had rifle training. It soon was clear, that a unified <b>governing</b> <b>system</b> would be beneficial to the corps. The volunteers in British Columbia donated $2 each to pay the expenses so a representative could talk to politicians in Ottawa. Although all of the politicians appeared sympathetic to the cause, it remained ‘premature’ in terms of national necessity.|$|E

500|$|Diocletian, like Augustus and Trajan before him, styled {{himself a}} [...] "restorer". He urged {{the public to}} see his reign and his <b>governing</b> <b>system,</b> the Tetrarchy (rule by four emperors), as a renewal of {{traditional}} Roman values and, after the anarchic third century, {{a return to the}} [...] "Golden Age of Rome". As such, he reinforced the long-standing Roman preference for ancient customs and Imperial opposition to independent societies. The Diocletianic regime's activist stance, however, and Diocletian's belief in the power of central government to effect major change in morals and society made him unusual. Most earlier emperors tended to be quite cautious in their administrative policies, preferring to work within existing structures rather than overhauling them. Diocletian, by contrast, was willing to reform every aspect of public life to satisfy his goals. Under his rule, coinage, taxation, architecture, law and history were all radically reconstructed to reflect his authoritarian and traditionalist ideology. The reformation of the empire's [...] "moral fabric"and the elimination of religious minoritieswas simply one step in that process.|$|E

[...] In his book Gilligan Unbound: Pop Culture in the Age of Globalization, Paul Arthur Cantor said he was amazed by how far the episode [...] "willing to take its corrosive satire of national politics." [...] He said it [...] "attacks the federal government at its foundation, the patriotic myths upon which its legitimacy lies. It makes fun of the very process by which patriotism is inculcated in the nation's youth, the hokey contests that lead children to outdo each other in progovernment effusions." [...] When the corrupt congressman is arrested, Lisa proclaims [...] "The system works!" [...] Benedict Anderson wrote in the book The Spectre of Comparisons that series creator Matt Groening [...] "assumes that his tickled audience is confident that the system barely works [...] So why does he need to show a patriot at all, especially one who is a deluded little female block-head?

2500|$|As {{a social}} movement, mundialization expresses the {{solidarity}} of {{populations of the}} globe and aims to establish institutions and supranational laws of a federative structure common to them, while respecting the diversity of cultures and peoples. The movement advocates for a new political organization governing all humanity, involving the transfer of certain parts of national sovereignty to a Federal World Authority, Federal World Government and Federal World Court. Basing its authority on {{the will of the}} people, and developing new systems to draw the highest and best wisdom of all humanity into the task of governing our world, the collaborative <b>governing</b> <b>system</b> would be capable of solving the problems which call into question the future of man, such as hunger, water, war, peace-keeping, pollution and energy. [...] The mundialization movement includes the declaration of specified territory - a city, town, or state, for example - as world territory, with responsibilities and rights on a world scale. Currently the nation-state system and the United Nations offer no way {{for the people of the}} world to vote for world officials or participate in governing our world.

2500|$|With the {{establishment}} of settlements and population came the attendant need for education, health, fire and police protection and an urgent need to improve methods of travel. The North West Territories established Departments which did not last long, and were soon replaced by a rural administrative system called Local Improvement Districts (LID). Local Improvement Districts were very large, and with the early dirt trails for roads, and {{a limited number of}} automobiles, the area was found much to large to administer. The L.I.D. soon gave way to the rural municipality system of rural civic administration and encompassed on average 9 townships, 3 x 3 in area, which were each [...] square, and with some modifications is still the rural administration in use today. A rural municipality (R.M.) was an elected <b>governing</b> <b>system</b> providing essential services such as police, fire, health, education and infrastructure services for rural residents. For example, L.I.D. 64 was the precursor of Brock No. 64 in the district of Assiniboia, North West Territories. Historically, community residents could pay taxes or supply a couple days per quarter section labour constructing roads, bridges, and fireguards instead of paying taxes. This civic government with its elected officials attended to the maintenance and construction of the early pioneer road. Two horse then eight horse scrapers maintained these early dirt roads.|$|E

2500|$|Most of {{the north}} of the state {{consists}} of an area known as the Sierra Gorda, which is an area of very rugged terrain, with widely varying climates. From the 16th to 19th centuries The Spanish would slowly dominate the lands around it, south in Querétaro, west in Guanajuato and east in Hidalgo, with only military and missionary incursions into the area's interior. This was due to the fierce resistance of the local native peoples. Unlike those in the south, the Pames, Chichimeca Jonaz and other groups were mostly hunter gatherers, not city dwellers already used to a hierarchical <b>governing</b> <b>system.</b> Attempts to militarily pacify and evangelize the area had little success, with a number of missions never completed or destroyed shortly after they were built. In the mid 18th century, the colonial government in Mexico City decided to make a concerted effort to bring the territory into submission, as it contained important routes to mining areas such as Zacatecas and Guanajuato. José de Escondón was sent in 1740 to militarily subdue the area, which culminated in the 1748 Battle of Media Luna, in which the Chichimeca were decisively defeated. This {{paved the way for the}} establishment of five principle missions in the heart of the Sierra Gorda of Querétaro, attributed to Junípero Serra, which today are a World Heritage Site. Even though the area was pacified in the mid 18th century, a district called an [...] "alcaldía mayor" [...] was established in San José de Escandón, today in the municipality of Pinal de Amoles, which governed what is now the northern half of the state. Decline of mining in the area would have this seat of government moved to Cadereyta in 1675, but this territory would be joined with the alcaldía mayor of the city of Querétaro to form the modern state.|$|E
2500|$|Florida {{was mostly}} divided between two {{distinct}} culture groups, the Muskogean & the Carib. While {{there were some}} Muskogean tribes along almost the entirety of Florida's east coast, everything else south of Lake Okeechobee was ruled by a Carib nation called the Calusa —Including the Keys. This tribe {{appears to have been}} a powerful trading force in the Caribbean & the chief & his wife were treated almost as if they were a king & queen. They had discovered complex building techniques & built cities of two story communal buildings, as space within the Everglades was scarce. Smaller farming & fishing villages built the more common thatched-roof, stilted huts common amongst the Carib peoples. While they mostly wove their clothing from Spanish moss & made shawls & rugs from dried palm leaves, they also undoubtedly traded for other cloth goods to the north and west, which may have given them access to Hemp [...] & Cotton. The Chief & his wife had their own palace, of sorts, in which they lived & from which they conducted their political business. They were met with the Spanish when they attempted to explore Florida in the 16th century & continued to survive in the region until the mid-18th century, when Spain temporarily lost control of the Florida colony to the English due to the activities of the Creek Confederacy. They were also partially responsible for the mythology surrounding the Fountain of Youth. Later, they conquered some of the other Muskogean peoples—namely the Ais & the Mayaimi [...] (for which the city of Miami is named for, despite the fact that the tribe surrounded Lake Okeechobee), technically making them an Empire, as small as they were.
