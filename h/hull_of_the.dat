5|$|The {{concept of}} a dual {{tessellation}} can also be applied to partitions of the plane into finitely many regions. It {{is closely related to}} but not quite the same as planar graph duality in this case. For instance, the Voronoi diagram of a finite set of point sites is a partition of the plane into polygons within which one site is closer than any other. The sites on the convex <b>hull</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> input give rise to unbounded Voronoi polygons, two of whose sides are infinite rays rather than finite line segments. The dual of this diagram is the Delaunay triangulation of the input, a planar graph that connects two sites by an edge whenever there exists a circle that contains those two sites and no other sites. The edges of the convex <b>hull</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> input are also edges of the Delaunay triangulation, but they correspond to rays rather than line segments of the Voronoi diagram. This duality between Voronoi diagrams and Delaunay triangulations can be turned into a duality between finite graphs in either of two ways: by adding an artificial vertex at infinity to the Voronoi diagram, to serve as the other endpoint for all of its rays, or by treating the bounded part of the Voronoi diagram as the weak dual of the Delaunay triangulation. Although the Voronoi diagram and Delaunay triangulation are dual, their embedding in the plane may have additional crossings beyond the crossings of dual pairs of edges. Each vertex of the Delaunay triangle is positioned within its corresponding face of the Voronoi diagram. Each vertex of the Voronoi diagram is positioned at the circumcenter of the corresponding triangle of the Delaunay triangulation, but this point may lie outside its triangle.|$|E

5|$|At 18:00, {{with the}} rest of the pursuit far behind, Paulet succeeded in {{bringing}} Gloire within range of the cannon on his ship's quarterdeck. Opening fire with these guns brought a response from Beens' sternchaser guns, the frigates exchanging cannon shot for four and a half hours as Astraea slowly caught up with its elusive opponent. At 22:30, Paulet was finally close enough to lay Astraea alongside Gloire and the two frigates exchanged fire at close range for the next 58 minutes, Paulet concentrating his gunnery on the <b>hull</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> French ship while Beens' ordered his men to disable the British ship's rigging and masts. Gloire was a substantially larger ship than Astraea, both in weight of shot and gross tonnage, and the battle was fiercely contested: Beens suffered a head injury and all three of Astraeas topmasts taking serious damage, so much so that the main topmast collapsed in the aftermath of the action. However at 23:28, with two British ships of the line visible in the distance, Beens surrendered his ship to Paulet.|$|E

Optimus then calls for the launch to try and escape through the portal before it closes, but the Decepticons arrive in the Nemesis to stop them.

Bruticus launches from the Nemesis and destroys the Arks fuel line before being fatally injured and blasted off the ship into empty space by Jazz and Jetfire. Nearby, Bumblebee takes the fatal hit for Optimus and the two rival leaders engage in a battle to death.

40|$|Skew {{estimation}} {{and page}} segmentation {{are the two}} closely related processing stages for document image analysis. Skew estimation needs proper page segmentation, especially for document images with multiple skews that are common in scanned images from thick bound publications in 2 -up style or postal envelopes with various printed labels. Even if only a single skew is concerned for a document image, <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> minority regions of different skews or undefined skew such as noise may severely affect the estimation for the dominant skew. Page segmentation, on the other hand, may {{need to know the}} exact skew angle of a page in order to work properly. This paper presents a skew estimation method with built-in skew-independent segmentation functionality that is capable of handling document images with multiple regions of different skews. It is based on <b>the</b> convex <b>hulls</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> individual components (i. e. the smallest convex polygon that fully contains a component) and that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> component groups (i. e. the smallest convex polygon that fully contain all the components in a group) in a document image. The proposed method first extracts <b>the</b> convex <b>hulls</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> components, segments an image into groups of components according to both the spatial distances and size similarities among <b>the</b> convex <b>hulls</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> components. This process not only extracts <b>the</b> hints <b>of</b> <b>the</b> alignments <b>of</b> <b>the</b> text groups, but also separate noise or graphical components from that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> textual ones. To verify the proposed algorithms, <b>the</b> full sets <b>of</b> <b>the</b> real and <b>the</b> synthetic samples <b>of</b> <b>the</b> University <b>of</b> Washington English Document Image Database I (UW-I) are used.

The battleship Bismarck set out to Norway in dazzle camouflage; this was painted out with gray for her final trip to the Atlantic. The cruiser Admiral Scheer wore a low contrast pattern of irregular dark gray marks on light gray for her superstructure, with a dark gray hull, black waterline and, away from air support while out raiding in 1941, dark gray turret tops.|$|E
