25|$|A hat-trick {{occurs in}} cricket when a bowler dismisses three batsmen with {{consecutive}} deliveries. The deliveries may be interrupted by an over bowled by another bowler <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the pitch {{or the other}} team's innings, but must be three consecutive deliveries by the individual bowler in the same match. Only wickets attributed to the bowler count towards a hat-trick; run outs do not count.|$|E

25|$|Bowling, in cricket, is {{the action}} of {{propelling}} the ball toward the wicket defended by a batsman. A player skilled at bowling is called a bowler; a bowler {{who is also a}} competent batsman is known as an all-rounder. Bowling the ball is distinguished from throwing the ball by a strictly specified biomechanical definition, which restricts the angle of extension of the elbow. A single act of bowling the ball towards the batsman is called a ball or a delivery. Bowlers bowl deliveries in sets of six, called an over. Once a bowler has bowled an over, a teammate will bowl an over <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the pitch. The Laws of Cricket govern how a ball must be bowled. If a ball is bowled illegally, an umpire will rule it a no ball. If a ball is bowled too wide of the striker for the batsman {{to be able to play}} at it with a proper cricket shot, the bowler's end umpire will rule it a wide.|$|E
25|$|There {{is a major}} {{difference}} {{in the way in which}} different bowlers or pitchers contribute to a single game. In baseball, a single pitcher starts the game, and makes every pitch until the manager replaces the tiring pitcher with a relief pitcher. Replaced pitchers cannot return to pitch again in the same game (unless they are shuttled to another position in the field and thus stay in the line-up, a move rarely seen in the major leagues), and a succession of pitchers may come into the game in sequence until it ends. In cricket, two bowlers begin the game, with those not actively bowling spending time as fielders. Every player in the team, including the wicket-keeper but excluding the 12th man, is available to be used as a bowler. Bowlers alternate bowling overs of six balls each. A bowler will usually bowl for a 'spell' of several (alternate) overs, and will generally bowl the entire spell from the same end of the pitch. A second bowler will bowl the overs missed by the first, <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the pitch, for his own spell. After a bowler is taken off, he may be, and often is, asked to bowl another spell later in the same innings. Although moving a pitcher to a fielding position and returning him to pitch later in the game is legal in baseball, it is a rarely used and potentially risky strategy, as the pitcher may be unprepared to play another position.|$|E
2500|$|On {{at least}} one occasion, the {{conservative}} Milner came {{to the aid of}} people <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the political spectrum. [...] He was an old family friend of Margaret Hobhouse, the mother of imprisoned peace activist Stephen Henry Hobhouse—in fact, he was Stephen's proxy godfather. [...] In 1917, when Margaret was working to get her son and other British conscientious objectors freed from prison, Milner discreetly helped, intervening with high government officials. [...] As a result, in December 1917 more than 300 COs were released from prison on medical grounds.|$|E

[...] Wentworth Woodhouse ceased to be occupied by the family after World War II, and the painting was loaned to Kenwood House in London from 1971–81, the Tate Gallery 1984–85, and the National Gallery from 1996 before its purchase the next year. [...] It is now displayed in the centre of room 34, and is framed by doorways {{at the end of}} a long enfilade so that it can be seen through ten intervening rooms <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the gallery in the Sainsbury Wing.

2500|$|However, Scotland {{continued}} to produce talented and successful poets. Poets {{from the lower}} social orders included the weaver-poet William Thom (1799–1848), whose [...] "A chieftain unknown to the Queen" [...] (1843) combined simple Scots language with a social critique of Queen Victoria's visit to Scotland. <b>From</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the social scale Lady Margaret Maclean Clephane Compton Northampton (d. 1830), translated Jacobite verse from the Gaelic and poems by Petrarch and Goethe as well as producing her own original work. Her poem Irene adapts the Spenserian stanza to reflect natural patterns of speech. William Edmondstoune Aytoun (1813–65), eventually appointed Professor of belles lettres at the University of Edinburgh, {{is best known for}} The lays of the Scottish Cavaliers and made use of the ballad form in his poems, including Bothwell. Among the most successful Scottish poets was the Glasgow-born Thomas Campbell (1777–1844), whose produced patriotic British songs, including [...] "Ye Mariners of England", a reworking of [...] "Rule Britannia!", and sentimental but powerful epics on contemporary events, including Gertrude of Wyoming. His works were extensively reprinted in the period 1800–60.|$|E
2500|$|Before a match begins, the two team captains meet on {{the pitch}} for the toss (of a coin) to {{determine}} which team will bat first. Two batsmen and eleven fielders then enter the field and play begins when {{a member of the}} fielding team, known as the bowler, delivers (i.e., bowls) the ball {{from one end of the}} pitch towards the wicket at the other end, which is guarded by one of the batsmen, known as the striker. In addition to the bowler, the fielding team includes the wicket-keeper, a specialist who stands behind the striker's wicket. The nine other fielders are tactically deployed around the field by their captain, usually in consultation with the bowler. The striker [...] "takes guard" [...] on a crease drawn on the pitch four feet in front of the wicket. His role is to prevent the ball from hitting the stumps by using his bat and, simultaneously, to strike it well enough to score runs. The other batsman, known as the non-striker, waits at the opposite end of the pitch near the bowler. The bowler's objectives are to prevent the scoring of runs and to dismiss the batsman. A dismissed batsman, who is declared to be [...] "out", must leave the field to be replaced by a teammate. An over is a set of six deliveries bowled by the same bowler. The next over is bowled <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the pitch by a different bowler.|$|E
