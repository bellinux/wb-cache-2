40|$|For {{two periods}} of several weeks {{duration}} {{in spring and}} autumn 2014, we monitored fluctuations in the geomagnetic field using 3 -axis SQUID magnetometers at three locations within the LSBB tunnel network. Measurements at the water flow point C, and the <b>GAS</b> <b>gallery</b> supplemented the measurements by the permanent [SQUID] 2 system in the Capsule. The frequency spectra of the magnetic fluctuations varied considerably between the three locations. These measurements have provided a unique data set to investigate the potential of underground SQUIDs to monitor the gradient of geomagnetic signals and thus investigate magnetotelluric effects and possible seasonal effects due {{to changes in the}} water content of the surrounding rock. We also compared the measurements of a SQUID and fluxgate system, and report on fluxgate measurements at the Boulby Underground Laboratory...|$|E
50|$|The {{community}} {{was named after}} the family of William D. Buchanan, who, with his sons Joe and George, homesteaded there beginning in 1886. Buchanan post office was established in 1911, with Hattie E. Buchanan the first postmaster. The office closed in 1919 but {{the area around the}} Buchanan Ranch is still known as Buchanan. By 1978 the community had a single store. Today Buchanan has a Burns mailing address and a business that includes a tractor repair shop, <b>gas</b> station, <b>gallery,</b> and free museum, all located within the only building in the community.|$|R
60|$|All this, however, I passed rapidly by as I {{ascended the}} staircase, and passed onward {{to the picture}} gallery. This was a room about a hundred feet long by forty wide, surmounted by a dome gorgeously {{finished}} with golden palm, trees and carving. This hall is lighted in the evening by a row of gaslights placed outside the ground glass of the dome; this light is concentrated and thrown down by strong reflectors, communicating thus the most brilliant radiance without the usual heat of <b>gas.</b> This <b>gallery</b> is peculiarly rich in paintings of the Spanish school. Among them are two superb Murillos, taken from convents by Marshal Soult, {{during the time of}} his career in Spain.|$|R
5000|$|The sobriety of the {{decoration}} {{on the outside}} of the building contrasts with its colourful interior, which takes the visitors back in time to plunge into the everyday atmosphere of a well-to-do nineteenth-century family. In the different rooms on the main floor (the music room, the ballroom, the dining room, the bedrooms) are a succession of item of furniture of different styles, mural paintings, Saxony porcelain, Murano and Bohemian glass, musical instruments, clocks and numerous objectss for personal use. In addiction, one can follow the development of the different lighting systems that existed in the nineteenth century, from oil lamps to the advent of <b>gas</b> lighting.The first-floor <b>gallery</b> and the garden are the most attractive and evocative parts of the house. In the gallery can be seen two walls decorated with children's scenes and, on the paving, a [...] "Bis Bis" [...] from the Napoleon era, a game consisting of forty-nine polychrome tiles, with which the Llopis family and their guests amused themselves.|$|R
6000|$|... 21.--We {{have had}} a great alarm. Last evening {{we went to the}} parish church; Horace Druce had been asked to preach, and the rain, which had fallen all the morning, cleared off {{just in time for the}} walk. Emily, Margaret, two of her children, and I sat in the gallery, and Avice and Isa in the free seats below. Avice had been kept at home by the rain in the morning, but had begged leave to go later. Darkness came on just as the first hymn was given out, and the verger went round with his long wand {{lighting}} the <b>gas.</b> In the <b>gallery</b> we saw plainly how, at the east end, something went wrong with his match, one which he thought had failed, and threw aside. It fell on a strip of straw matting in the aisle, which, being very dry, caught fire and blazed up for a few seconds before it was trampled out. Some foolish person, however, set the cry of 'Fire!' going, and you know what that is in a crowded church. The vicar, in his high old-fashioned desk with a back to it, could not see. Horace in a chair, in the narrow, shallow sanctuary, did see that it was nothing, but between the cries of 'Fire!' and the dying peal of the organ, could not make his voice heard. All he could do was to get to the rear of the crowd, together with the other few who had seen the real state of things, and turn back all those whom they could, getting them out through the vestry. But the main body were quite out of their reach, and everybody tried to rush scrambling into the narrow centre aisle, choking up the door, which was a complicated trap meant to keep out draughts. We in the gallery tried vainly to assure them that the only danger was in the crowd, and the clergyman in his desk, sure that was the chief peril, at any rate, went on waving and calling to them to wait; but the cries and shrieks drowned everything, and there was a most terrible time, as some 600 people jammed themselves in that narrow space, fighting, struggling, fainting.|$|R
