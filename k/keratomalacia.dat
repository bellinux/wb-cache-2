25|$|Due to {{the unique}} {{function}} of retinal as a visual chromophore, {{one of the earliest}} and specific manifestations of vitamin A deficiency is impaired vision, particularly in reduced light – night blindness. Persistent deficiency gives rise to a series of changes, the most devastating of which occur in the eyes. Some other ocular changes are referred to as xerophthalmia. First there is dryness of the conjunctiva (xerosis) as the normal lacrimal and mucus-secreting epithelium is replaced by a keratinized epithelium. This is followed by the build-up of keratin debris in small opaque plaques (Bitot's spots) and, eventually, erosion of the roughened corneal surface with softening and destruction of the cornea (<b>keratomalacia)</b> and leading to total blindness. Other changes include impaired immunity (increased risk of ear infections, urinary tract infections, Meningococcal disease), hyperkeratosis (white lumps at hair follicles), keratosis pilaris and squamous metaplasia of the epithelium lining the upper respiratory passages and urinary bladder to a keratinized epithelium. In relation to dentistry, a deficiency in vitamin A may lead to enamel hypoplasia.|$|E

50|$|Vitamin A {{deficiency}} (VAD) or hypovitaminosis A {{is a lack}} {{of vitamin}} A in blood and tissues. It is common in poorer countries but rarely seen in more developed countries.

50|$|The precise {{mechanism}} {{is still not}} known, but vitamin A {{is necessary for the}} maintenance of the specialized epithelial surfaces of the body. A lack of vitamin A leads to atrophic changes in the normal mucosal surface, with loss of goblet cells, and replacement of the normal epithelium by an inappropriate keratinized stratified squamous epithelium. In addition, the substantia propria of the cornea breaks down and liquefies, resulting in <b>keratomalacia.</b>|$|E

50|$|Proper {{diagnosis}} {{is essential for}} optimal treatment. Bacterial corneal ulcer require intensive fortified antibiotic therapy to treat the infection. Fungal corneal ulcers require intensive application of topical anti-fungal agents. Viral corneal ulceration caused by herpes virus may respond to antivirals like topical acyclovir ointment instilled {{at least five times}} a day. Alongside, supportive therapy like pain medications are given, including topical cycloplegics like atropine or homatropine to dilate the pupil and thereby stop spasms of the ciliary muscle. Superficial ulcers may heal in less than a week. Deep ulcers and descemetoceles may require conjunctival grafts or conjunctival flaps, soft contact lenses, or corneal transplant. Proper nutrition, including protein intake and Vitamin C are usually advised. In cases of <b>Keratomalacia,</b> where the corneal ulceration is due to a deficiency of Vitamin A, supplementation of the Vitamin A by oral or intramuscular route is given. Drugs that are usually contraindicated in corneal ulcer are topical corticosteroids and anesthetics - these should not be used on any type of corneal ulcer because they prevent healing, may lead to superinfection with fungi and other bacteria and will often make the condition much worse.|$|E

40|$|NUTRITIONAL {{deficiencies}} are {{a frequent}} cause of serious eye disease in India. Oomen (1961) reported a mortality of nearly 30 per cent. {{in young children}} with <b>keratomalacia</b> and an even higher proportion in those with protein malnutrition; about 25 per cent. of the survivors became totally blind, and about 60 per cent. were left with reduced vision in one or both eyes. Deficiency diseases revealed by dietary surveys have included xerophthalmia, Bitot's spots, angular stomatitis, and phrynoderma. Gilroy (1951) observed xerophthalmia in 250 out of 4, 191 children from 44 estates in Assam. Sundararajan (1963) found signs of vitamin A deficiency in 35 to 45 per cent. of schoolchildren in Calcutta. Chandra, Venkatachalam, Belavadi, Reddy, and Gopalan (1960) reported that lack of protein and vitamin A was the most frequent cause of nutritional deficiency disorders in India; out of 14, 563 children examined in a 5 -year period, 2, 245 showed malnutrition, 551 vitamin A deficiency, and 157 <b>keratomalacia.</b> Rao, Swaminathan, Swarup, and Patwardhan (1959) observed two to five cases ofvitamin A deficiency for every case of kwashiorkor.

40|$|The National Prophylaxis Programme against Nutritional Blindness due to vitamin A {{deficiency}} (NPPNB due to VAD) {{was started}} in 1970 with the specific aim of preventing nutritional blindness due to <b>keratomalacia.</b> The Programme was launched as an urgent remedial measure to combat the unacceptably high magnitude of xerophthalmic blindness in the country seen in the 1950 s and 1960 s. Clinical VAD has declined drastically during the last 40 years. Also, indicators of child health have shown substantial gains in different States in the country. The prevalence of severe undernutrition has come down significantly. Immunization coverage for measles and other vaccine preventable diseases has improved from 5 - 7 per cent in early seventies to currently 60 - 90 per cent, in different States. Similarly, {{there has been a}} significant improvement in the overall dietary intake of young children. There has been virtual disappearance of <b>keratomalacia,</b> and a sharp decline in the prevalence of Bitot spots. Prophylactic mega dose administration of vitamin A is primarily advocated because of the claim of 23 per cent reduction in childhood mortality. However, benefits on this scale have been found only in areas with rudimentary health care facilities where clinical deficiency is common, and there is substantial heterogeneity, especially with inclusion of all trials. There is an urgent need for adopting a targeted rather than universal prophylactic mega dose vitamin A supplementation in preschool children. This approach is justified on the basis of currently available evidence documenting a substantial decline in VAD prevalence, substantial heterogeneity and uncertainty about mortality effects in present era with improved health care, and resource constraints with competing priorities...|$|E

40|$|Infant malnutrition, {{resulting}} {{frequently in}} the death of children of pre-school age, is a problem requiring urgent solution in Indonesia. Children suffering from malnutrition show a variety of symptoms, the most characteristic being emaciation, growth retardation, liver changes, dyspigmentation of skin and hair, other skin lesions, oedema, muscular wasting, anaemia, and xerophthalmia. The indicative value of xerophthalmia, which often leads to the development of <b>keratomalacia,</b> in the diagnosis of malnutrition is stressed by the author. Further research is required to determine the causes—and particularly the part played by diet—of the clinical differences observed in malnutrition cases. Far greater interest in the problem of malnutrition must be shown by the entire medical profession in Indonesia if treatment is to be carried out successfully. The specific symptom, xerophthalmia, is easily curable with cod-liver oil. General malnutrition can be prevented only if sufficient amounts, both quantitatively and qualitatively, of protein, vitamin A, and calories are provided for every child.

40|$|Purpose:To {{identify}} {{children aged}} 0 - 72 months with blinding xerophthalmia in the North West Frontier Province (NWFP) and its adjoining Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) in Pakistan, {{using a new}} surveillance system, and to describe socio-economic and other characteristics of reported cases. Methods: All ophthalmologists in district headquarter hospitals in NWFP and agency headquarter hospitals in FATA were requested {{to participate in a}} surveillance programme for the detection of blinding xerophthalmia (corneal xerosis, corneal ulcers, <b>keratomalacia</b> and corneal scars related to vitamin A deficiency) for children aged 0 - 72 months. The surveillance included reporting of each case of blinding xerophthalmia presenting to the participating eye units over a period of 12 months and recording their socio-economic and other related characteristics. Results: Seventy six cases of blinding xerophthalmia were reported and there was almost no gender difference. Children came from 19 of 31 districts and agencies in NWFP and FATA with a working ophthalmologist. The commonest age at presentation was 25 - 48 months and almost half of them belonged to households with a monthly income of Pak Rs. 1200 (US $ 20). Precipitating systemic illnesses were diarrhea and fever with cough in 63. 2 % and 56. 6 % cases, respectively. Almost a third of children aged 9 months had not been immunized against measles. A quarter of all children had not been adequately breast-fed, and 7 children (9 %) had never been breastfed. Majority of the cases presented during summer and autumn months. Conclusions: Our surveillance data provide evidence that blinding xerophthalmia does occur in children in NWFP and its adjoining FATA.

40|$|Human {{health and}} {{well-being}} depends upon an interaction between genetic endowment or constitution {{on the one hand}} and environmental factors like nutrition, ecology (environmental sanitation, safe drinking water, pollutants, toxins etc) and life style (physical exercise, mental poise, peace, positive thinking, art of living, spirituality etc) on the other. Good nutrition and sound health go hand-inhand. It has been known since the time of Hippocrates, that a person with good nutrition is able to ward off infections much more effectively than a person who is "fragile and weak". During most of the 20 th century, the focus of research in nutrition was how to improve intake of total calories and protein in children. Therefore, the florid cases of kwashiorkor, severe protein-energy malnutrition and severe deficiencies of single micronutrients like scurvy, beriberi, pellagra and <b>keratomalacia</b> have significantly declined or disappeared. However, there is still widespread prevalence of diseases of public health relevance due to deficiencies of single micronutrients like iron deficiency anaemia, goitre and other iodine-deficiency disorders and milder forms of vitamin A deficiency 1. But, of late, there has been an increasing awareness that subclinical or biochemical deficiency of certain micronutrients ("hidden hunger") is widely prevalent in developing countries which is adversely affecting the quality of human life and leading to frequent occurrence of common day-to-day gastrointestinal and respiratory infections 2. It has been documented in developing countries that impaired immunocompetence due to nutritional deficiencies precedes overt infections and may even occur before growth failure is evident.

40|$|SUMMARY An {{analysis}} of 50000 patients ' medical records {{was made to}} determine the commonest causes of blindness in Zaire. It {{was found that the}} commonest causes of blindness in order of frequency were glaucoma (31 %), cataract (18 - 4 %), optic atrophy (16. 3 %), onchocerciasis (4. 9 %), and corneal leucoma (4 - 9 %). The definition of legal blindness varies from one country to another. To give one example of the differences, the legally blind in the USA are those whose corrected visual acuity for distance is equal or inferior to 20 / 200 (6 / 60) or with a visual field not greater than 200 in the better eye. 2 But in many European and African countries persons with legal blindness are those whose corrected visual acuity is equal or inferior to 1 / 20 (3 / 60) or whose visual field is not greater than 10 ° in the better eye. Studies of the predominant causes of blindness have been performed for a number of countries with different results from one country to another and in the same country from one region to another (regions of endemic onchocerciasis or trachoma, rural or urban). The world can be schematically divided into developed and developing countries. In the first group the main causes of blindness are ocular degen-erative diseases (macular degeneration, degenera-tive myopia, glaucoma) and diabetic retinopathy. ' 3 - 5 In the second group the predominant causes of blindness are ocular infections (onchocerciasis, trachoma, keratoconjunctivitis, and corneal ulcers), malnutrition (xerophtalmia, <b>keratomalacia,</b> optic neuritis), glaucoma, and cataract. 2 3611 In Zaire our study of the main causes of blindness had two purposes: (1) to determine the ocular diseases which cause blindness; (2) to provide pro-phylactic and curative treatment of them.

40|$|Corneal ulcers are a {{commonly}} encountered problem in domesticated species {{and can cause}} significant pain, incur a high cost for the owner, and result in blindness or eventual enucleation. The progressive deepening of corneal ulcers is mediated by enzymatic destruction of stromal collagen (termed <b>keratomalacia)</b> when collagenases from endogenous and exogenous sources are active on the corneal surface. The inhibition of collagenases can therefore be crucial to mitigating the damage that breakdown of corneal stromal collagen causes. In ulcers where collagenase activity is suspected, the use of topical serum has been recommended, in both human and veterinary medicine, primarily due {{to the presence of}} an endogenous serum anti-collagenase protein molecule: α- 2 macroglobulin. Alpha- 2 macroglobulin is produced by the liver and is able to inactivate collagenase molecules from various endogenous and exogenous sources. Plasma has also been recommended for use, in various forms, for the treatment of various corneal conditions. Plasma, in addition to containing α- 2 macroglobulin, also contains platelets and other growth factors that may be useful in promoting corneal healing. Despite widespread recommendations for the topical use of serum to treat <b>keratomalacia,</b> there is little data on its storage and usage in domestic species. Additionally, there is little information available comparing the anti-collagenase efficacy of serum to that of plasma. The goals of this research were {{to determine the effects of}} storage time and temperature on the anti-collagenase efficacy of serum in an in vitro corneal degradation model. This model uses a bacterial collagenase to cause collagen degradation, which is then measured by calculating percent corneal weight loss and quantifying the level of HP (a breakdown product of collagen) present; serum from different time and temperature storage is added to try to decrease weight loss and levels of HP. A reduction in percent corneal weight loss or HP would be indicative of a protective, anti-collagenase effect of the tested substance. An investigation into interspecies use of serum in the same model was also undertaken, to determine if any differences in anti-collagenase efficacy are seen with homologous serum compared to heterologous serum. In a second experiment, the anti-collagenase efficacy of fresh serum was compared to that of plasma for feline, canine and equine species. The hypothesis was that storage conditions would not affect the anti-collagenase efficacy of serum and that homologous and heterologous serum would have equal anti-collagenase efficacy. A final hypothesis was that fresh serum and plasma would have equal anti-collagenase efficacy. For the corneal degradation model, normal corneas from recently euthanized cats, dogs and horses were collected and stored at - 80 °C until use. For the first experiment serum was collected from healthy cats, dogs and horses and pooled by species, then stored for 30, 90 or 180 days at both - 20 °C and - 80 °C. Serum was pooled to control for any individual variation in serum composition. Sections of cornea were dried, weighed and incubated with clostridial collagenase and serum (homologous/heterologous) from each time/temperature point for the first experiment. Negative control samples were incubated only in saline with added calcium chloride while positive controls contained saline, calcium chloride and clostridial collagenase. Corneal damage was assessed by percent corneal weight loss and HP concentration of the incubation fluid compared to positive and negative control samples. A Shapiro-Wilk statistic was used to test for normality on percent corneal weight loss and HP. If the distribution was normal, mean and standard deviation (SD) were reported, if the distribution was not normal then median and range were reported. If the data was normal, then a general linear model was used to compare the means across groups, otherwise the Kruskal-Wallis test was used. If the Kruskal-Wallis test or the general linear model was significant, then pairwise comparisons with Bonferroni adjustment. A P value of 3 ̆c 0. 05 was considered significant. Statistical software was used for all analyses. The inclusion of serum resulted in significantly less percent corneal weight loss compared to positive controls (P 3 ̆c 0. 001). Storage time (P= 0. 074) and temperature (P= 0. 526) did not affect percent corneal weight loss, while interspecies cornea/serum combinations (i. e. heterologous serum) (P= 0. 028) did affect percent corneal weight loss. The inclusion of feline or equine sera significantly reduced HP concentration (P 3 ̆c 0. 001) compared to positive controls. Significantly more HP was present in samples incubated with serum stored for 90 days compared to all other time points (P 3 ̆c 0. 001) while temperature did not significantly affect HP concentrations (P= 0. 132). For the second experiment, the ulcer degradation model used was the same as for the first experiment. However, in the second experiment, the sections of feline, canine and equine cornea were dried, weighed and incubated with clostridial collagenase and fresh serum or plasma. For the second experiment, blood was collected from healthy cats, dogs and horses; fresh serum or plasma was pooled by species and used in the model. Serum and plasma were pooled to control for any individual variation in composition. To analyze the data from the second experiment, percent corneal weight loss and HP levels were compared among groups for positive control, serum and plasma samples with Kruskal-Wallis tests. If the Kruskal-Wallis test was significant (i. e., P 3 ̆c 0. 05), then Dunn’s tests were performed for pairwise comparisons. A Spearman correlation coefficient was used to assess correlation between percent corneal weight loss and HP concentration. In the second experiment, both serum and plasma were significantly effective at reducing percent corneal weight loss in this model compared to positive control samples. No significant difference was found between feline (P= 0. 579), canine (P= 0. 249) or equine (P= 0. 406) corneas incubated with serum or plasma with regards to percent corneal weight loss. Canine serum and plasma significantly reduced HP levels while inclusion of feline and equine serum or plasma did not, compared to positive controls. Levels of HP were moderately correlated with percent corneal weight loss for feline sample (P= 0. 002), weakly correlated for equine samples (P= 0. 096) but were not correlated with percent corneal weight loss for canine samples (P= 0. 842). These studies confirm that both serum and plasma exert an anti-collagenase effect. The results of these studies suggest that serum can be stored for up to 6 months, at either - 20 °C or - 80 C°C without loss of anti-collagenase efficacy. The use of heterologous serum may be beneficial but further research is needed before any clinical recommendations can be made. Additionally this research indicates that plasma may be an acceptable substitute for serum as a topical corneal anti-collagenase treatment. ...|$|E
