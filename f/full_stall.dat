5000|$|A {{few years}} ago, in the UK a banner-towing {{aircraft}} crashed {{at the end}} of a flight; it carried a passenger, a politician for whose election campaign the banner towing flight was intended to draw attention. Unfortunately, it did that but for the wrong reasons. At the time, it was speculated in the press that the extra weight of the passenger would have been the cause of the accident. This is highly unlikely. The aircraft should have been able to carry the added weight. It is much more likely that the pilot was making a low pass to allow the press photographers to get a good shot. Flying at low airspeed, the banner will be substantially below the flight path of the aircraft. It is probable that the pilot misjudged the height and room required to remain clear of the surface, the banner dragged over the ground and the rapidly increasing resistance as more parts of the banner would come into contact with the surface would in a very short time, a matter of mere seconds, caused the aircraft to stall. Releasing the banner, either by the pilot or by the [...] "weak link" [...] breaking would not have saved the aircraft: It would have been in a <b>full</b> <b>stall</b> and losing the stabilizing effect of the banner it is likely that it slammed into the ground.

A time-resolved particle imagevelocimetry(PIV) investigation of flowbehavior during the stall cycle examines the processes of stall development and flow reattachment. Proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) and vortex detection techniques are applied to the PIV fields to quantify relevant flow characteristics such as vortex size, separation angle, and separation point throughout a dynamic pitching cycle. The behavior of the POD coefficients provides time scales for the transitional stages which are quantified and compared, revealing that transition from attached flow to <b>full</b> <b>stall</b> is delayed to higher angles of attack and occurs at a higher rate than the transition from <b>full</b> <b>stall</b> to attached flow.

40|$|A {{total of}} eight 3 D CFD {{simulations}} of a 10 m-radius extruded blade (constant chord), using the S 809 airfoil, in pure rotational motion (without vortex recirculation) {{have been performed}} at two angular velocities (Ωlow= 12. 1 rpm≈ 1 / 3 Ωhigh) and four blade pitch angles (from full attached flow, i. e. at AoA 0 °, to high and <b>full</b> <b>stall</b> conditions at 15. 24 °). Two blade radial locations were chosen as r/R= 0. 3 and r/R= 0. 5 {{for the analysis of}} rotation effects. For this purpose, a set of 2 D CFD simulations of both radial locations has been performed at consistent conditions for each blade test case. The flow solver used for the simulations was the DLR TAU code, prescribing the RANS Spalart-Allmaras turbulence model for a steady state case. The Analysis of the results shows a remarkable increase in lift coefficient from the 3 D CFD blade simulations w. r. t. the corresponding 2 D CFD airfoil simulations, otherwise known as rotational augmentation. These increments specially occur at the most inboard part of the blade and have been found strongly related to the inertial Coriolis force acting on the flow in chordwise direction. Inside the boundary layer at the thickest point of the upper blade airfoil, an overshooting of the chordwise velocities is to be seen in the presence of radial velocities towards the blade tip, both increasing in magnitude with the angle of attack. This increase is precisely proportional to the values of rotational augmentation. For every blade test case, rotational augmentation has also been found inversely proportional to the blade radius, which also agrees with the effects of Coriolis forces after the Coriolis coefficient definition inside the Lindenburg model. The most pronounced increase in lift coefficient at both radial locations is to be seen with the blade in high stall. In these cases, a remarkable increase in radial velocities occurs along with a delay in boundary layer separation as the Coriolis forces increase in magnitude. Important phenomena have also been found such as the presence of radial velocities towards the blade root in the limits of the boundary layer for the test cases below high stall, as well as a significant development of rotational augmentation for the special cases of AoA 0 ° and <b>full</b> <b>stall...</b>|$|E
40|$|Time-resolved {{velocity}} fields {{around a}} pitching and surging NACA 0018 airfoil were analyzed {{to investigate the}} influence of three independent timescales associated with the unsteady flowfield. The first of these timescales, {{the period of the}} pitch/surge motion, is directly linked to the development of dynamic stall. A simplified model of the flow using only a time constant mode and the first two harmonics of the pitch surge frequency has been shown to accurately model the flow. <b>Full</b> <b>stall</b> and leading-edge flow separation, however, were found to take place before the maximum angle of attack, indicating that a different timescale was associated with leading-edge vortex formation. This second, leading-edge vortex, timescale was found to depend on the airfoil convection time and compare well with the universal vortex formation time. Finally, instantaneous non-phase-averaged measurements were investigated to identify behavior not directly coupled to the airfoil motion. From this analysis, a third timescale associated with quasi-periodic Strouhal vortex shedding was found before flow separation. The interplay between these three timescales is discussed in detail, particularly as they relate to the periodic velocity and angle-of-attack change apparent to the blades of a vertical axis wind turbine...|$|E

Flight simulator models will have to portray an airplane’s dynamics satisfactorily to achieve the associated training objectives. That imposes new simulator requirements. This study evaluated several <b>full</b> <b>stall</b> simulator models to meet those requirements. Three new stall models were tested in a Boeing 737 - 800 simulator. One model used the conventional approach by matching flight test data to within a tolerance. Another model did not rely on flight test data, but instead combined computational aerodynamics, scaled wind tunnel data, and expert opinion from a test pilot who had stalled the actual aircraft. The third model added a roll asymmetry to the unmodified simulator model as {{a simple way to}} possibly meet the training objectives. The test had two phases. In the first phase, test pilots who had stalled a 737 airplane evaluated the models by performing typical flight test stall maneuvers in the simulator.

40|$|In-flight loss {{of control}} remains the leading {{contributor}} to aviation accident fatalities, with stall upsets being the leading causal factor. The February 12, 2009. Colgan Air, Inc., Continental Express flight 3407 accident outside Buffalo, New York, brought this issue {{to the forefront of}} public consciousness and resulted in recommendations from the National Transportation Safety Board to conduct training that incorporates stalls that are fully developed and develop simulator standards to support such training. In 2010, Congress responded to this accident with Public Law 11 - 216 (Section 208), which mandates <b>full</b> <b>stall</b> training for Part 121 flight operations. Efforts are currently in progress to develop recommendations on implementation of stall training for airline pilots. The International Committee on Aviation Training in Extended Envelopes (ICATEE) is currently defining simulator fidelity standards that will be necessary for effective stall training. These recommendations will apply to all civil transport aircraft including straight-wing turboprop aircraft. Government-funded research over the previous decade provides a strong foundation for stall/post-stall simulation for swept-wing, conventional tail jets to respond to this mandate, but turboprops present additional and unique modeling challenges. First among these challenges is the effect of power, which can provide enhanced flow attachment behind the propellers. Furthermore, turboprops tend to operate for longer periods in an environment more susceptible to ice. As a result, there have been a significant number of turboprop accidents {{as a result of the}} early (lower angle of attack) stalls in icing. The vulnerability of turboprop configurations to icing has led to studies on ice accumulation and the resulting effects on flight behavior. Piloted simulations of these effects have highlighted the important training needs for recognition and mitigation of icing effects, including the reduction of stall margins. This paper addresses simulation modeling requirements that are unique to turboprop transport aircraft and highlights the growing need for aerodynamic models suitable for stall training for these configurations. A review of prominent accidents that involved aerodynamic stall is used to illustrate various modeling features unique to turboprop configurations and the impact of stall behavior on susceptibility to {{loss of control}} that has led to new training requirements. This is followed by an overview of stability and control behavior of straight-wing turboprops, the related aerodynamic characteristics, and a summary of recent experimental studies on icing effects. In addition, differences in flight dynamics behavior between swept-wing jets and straight-wing turboprop configurations are discussed to compare and contrast modeling requirements. Specific recommendations for aerodynamic models along with further research needs and data measurements are also provided. ...|$|E
40|$|During {{the flight}} of birds, it is often {{possible}} to notice {{that some of the}} primaries and covert feathers on the upper side of the wing pop-up under critical flight conditions, such as the landing approach or when stalking their prey (see Fig. 1). It is often conjectured that the feathers pop up plays an aerodynamic role by limiting the spread of flow separation. A combined experimental and numerical study was conducted to shed some light on the physical mechanism determining the feathers self actuation and their effective role in controlling the flow field in nominally stalled conditions. In particular, we have considered a NACA 0020 aerofoil, equipped with a flexible flap at low chord Reynolds numbers. A parametric study has been conducted on the effects of the length, natural frequency, and position of the flap. A configuration with a single flap hinged on the suction side at 70 % of the chord size c (from the leading edge), with a length of (Formula presented.) matching the shedding frequency of vortices at stall condition {{has been found to be}} optimum in delivering maximum aerodynamic efficiency and lift gains. Flow evolution both during a ramp-up motion (incidence angle from (Formula presented.) to (Formula presented.) with a reduced frequency of (Formula presented.), (Formula presented.) being the free stream velocity magnitude), and at a static stalled condition ((Formula presented.)) were analysed with and without the flap. A significant increase of the mean lift after a ramp-up manoeuvre is observed in presence of the flap. Stall dynamics (i. e., lift overshoot and oscillations) are altered and the simulations reveal a periodic re-generation cycle composed of a leading edge vortex that lift the flap during his passage, and an ejection generated by the relaxing of the flap in its equilibrium position. The flap movement in turns avoid the interaction between leading and trailing edge vortices when lift up and push the trailing edge vortex downstream when relaxing back. This cyclic behaviour is clearly shown by the periodic variation of the lift about the average value, and also from the periodic motion of the flap. A comparison with the experiments shows a similar but somewhat higher non-dimensional frequency of the flap oscillation. By assuming that the cycle frequency scales inversely with the boundary layer thickness, one can explain the higher frequencies observed in the experiments which were run at a Reynolds number about one order of magnitude higher than in the simulations. In addition, in experiments the periodic re-generation cycle decays after 3 – 4 periods ultimately leading to the <b>full</b> <b>stall</b> of the aerofoil. In contrast, the 2 D simulations show that the cycle can become self-sustained without any decay when the flap parameters are accurately tuned...|$|E
