25|$|The {{laughing}} falcon (Herpetotheres cachinnans), {{also called the}} snake hawk (erroneously, since {{it is not a}} hawk), is a medium-sized bird of prey in the falcon family (<b>Falconidae),</b> {{the only member of the}} genus Herpetotheres. This Neotropical species is a specialist snake-eater. Its common and scientific names both refer to its distinctive voice.|$|E
25|$|Predator species include coyote (Canis latrans), bobcat (Lynx rufus), American badger (Taxidea taxus), falcons (<b>Falconidae),</b> and hawks and eagles (Accipitridae) prey {{on adult}} and {{juvenile}}s. Crows and ravens (Corvus spp.) and magpies (Pica spp.) consume juvenile birds. Coyotes, ground squirrels (Sciuridae spp.), and badgers {{are the most}} important mammalian nest predators. Among bird species, magpies and ravens commonly prey on Greater Sage-Grouse nests.|$|E
25|$|In 1779 English {{illustrator}} John Frederick Miller was {{the first}} European to describe the secretarybird, and it was soon after assigned to its own genus Sagittarius by French naturalist Johann Hermann in his Tabula Affinitatum Animalium. It was not until 1935 that the species was moved to its own family, distinct from all other birds of prey—a classification confirmed by molecular systematics. Recent cladistic analysis has shown Sagittariidae to be an older branch of the {{diurnal birds of prey}} than Accipitridae and <b>Falconidae,</b> but a younger divergence than Cathartidae. Sometimes, the enigmatic bird Eremopezus is classified as an early relative of the secretarybird, though this is uncertain as the bird is only known from a few fragmentary body parts such as the legs. The earliest fossils associated with the family are two species from the genus Pelargopappus. The two species, from the Oligocene and Miocene respectively, were not discovered in Africa but France. The feet in these fossils are more like those of the Accipitridae; it is suggested that these characteristics are primitive features within the family. In spite of their age, it is not thought that the two species are ancestral to the secretary bird.|$|E

500|$|The {{peregrine}} falcon (Falco peregrinus), {{also known as}} the peregrine, and historically as the duck hawk in North America, is a widespread bird of prey in the family <b>Falconidae.</b> A large, crow-sized falcon, it has a blue-grey back, barred white underparts, and a black head. As is typical of bird-eating raptors, {{peregrine falcon}}s are sexually dimorphic, with females being considerably larger than males. The peregrine is renowned for its speed, reaching over [...] during its characteristic hunting stoop (high speed dive), making it the fastest member of the animal kingdom.

2500|$|Its {{relationships}} {{with other members of}} the <b>Falconidae</b> are unclear. [...] Traditionally it has been placed in the subfamily Polyborinae with the caracaras and forest falcons, but the American Ornithologists' Union's North American Check-list Committee now places it in the same subfamily as the true falcons, while the South American Check-list Committee places it with the forest falcons but not the caracaras, and it has also been considered a subfamily of its own.|$|E
