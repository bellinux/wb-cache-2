There were no hesitation wounds, which are typical of suicide by self-infliction. However, the authorities <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> investigating the case further.|$|E

5|$|The diet of {{the barn}} owl has been much studied; the items {{consumed}} can be ascertained from identifying the prey fragments in the pellets of indigestible matter that the bird regurgitates. Studies of diet {{have been made in}} most parts of the bird's range, and in moist temperate areas over 90% of the prey tends to be small mammals, whereas in hot, dry, unproductive areas, the proportion is lower, and a great variety of other creatures are eaten depending on local abundance. Most prey is terrestrial but bats and birds are also taken, as well as lizards, amphibians and insects. Even when they are plentiful and other prey scarce, earthworms <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> consumed.|$|E

5|$|Mainly nocturnal in habits, after dusk {{the leopard}} {{catshark}} hunts for small, benthic bony fishes and invertebrates in shallow water. In daytime, it generally rests inside caves and crevices, sometimes in groups. This species {{has been documented}} ambushing spawning chokka squid (Loligo vulgaris reynaudi) within their spawning grounds. Reproduction is oviparous and proceeds year-round. Females produce rectangular, light-colored egg capsules two at a time, attaching them to structures on the sea floor. Small and harmless, the leopard catshark adapts well to captivity and is often exhibited in public aquariums. It is caught by commercial and recreational fishers as bycatch, and often killed as a pest. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed this species as Data Deficient; its numbers <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> declining, but heavy human activity occurs within its native waters. The possibly fragmented nature of its distribution also merits caution for each local population.|$|E

25|$|The binding affinities of {{iprindole}} {{for various}} biological targets {{are presented in}} the table to the right. It is presumed {{to act as an}} inhibitor or antagonist/inverse agonist of all sites. Considering the range of its therapeutic concentrations (e.g., 63–271nM at 90mg/day), only the actions of iprindole on the 5-HT2 and histamine receptors might be anticipated to be of possible clinical significance. However, it is unknown whether these actions are in fact responsible for the antidepressant effects of iprindole. The plasma protein binding of iprindole and hence its free percentage and potentially bioactive concentrations <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> known.|$|E
25|$|Finally, as cold seeps become inactive, tubeworms also {{start to}} disappear, {{clearing}} the way for corals to settle on the now exposed carbonate substrate. The corals do not rely on hydrocarbons seeping out of the seafloor. Studies on Lophelia pertusa suggest they derive their nutrition primarily from the ocean surface. Chemosynthesis plays only a very small role, if any, in their settlement and growth. While deepwater corals <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> chemosynthesis-based organisms, the chemosynthetic organisms that come before them enable the corals' existence. This hypothesis about establishment of deep water coral reefs is called hydraulic theory.|$|E

The terms Maharashtra, Maharashtri, Marathi and Maratha may have derived from the same root. However, their exact etymology is uncertain. The Nashik Gazetteer states that in 246BC Maharatta is mentioned as one of the places to which Mauryan emperor Ashoka sent an embassy, and Maharashtraka is recorded in a Chalukyan inscription of 580 CE as including three provinces and 99,000 villages.

25|$|Fleas and ticks {{of various}} species can be {{acquired}} and brought home by a dog, {{where they can}} multiply and attack humans (and vice versa). These two parasites are particularly important to note, now that tick-borne Lyme Disease has become endemic throughout a large area, {{in addition to other}} similar diseases such as Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever. Although dogs <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> as susceptible to such diseases as humans, similar rickettsial diseases have been spread by dogs to humans through such mechanisms as a dog killing an infected rabbit, then shaking itself off in the house near enough to its owners to fatally infect most of the family.|$|E

They <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> species-specific {{when it comes to}} choosing hosts. Some species are known to parasitize insects from several families of a single order. Their most common hosts are insects belonging to the order Hemiptera (true bugs), especially Auchenorrhyncha (leafhoppers, cicadas, and allies) and Coccoidea (scale insects), but this might be because these groups are simply better studied. Other important host orders include Coleoptera (beetles), Diptera (true flies), Odonata (dragonflies and allies), Psocoptera (booklice and allies), and Thysanoptera (thrips). Hosts are known definitely for only a quarter of all known genera.|$|E
