5|$|A few {{historians have}} <b>hypothesized</b> <b>that</b> the Kylfings were a West Slavic people {{related to the}} Pomeranians. Under this interpretation, the Slavic term Kolbiag may share common origins with such place-names as Kołobrzeg (formerly Kolberg), a town on the Pomeranian Baltic coast, and Kolpino, a {{settlement}} near modern St. Petersburg.|$|E
5|$|Duckles <b>hypothesized</b> <b>that</b> {{the first}} hand {{might have been}} that of Ambrose Beeland, with whom Gamble apprenticed and is {{believed}} to have been his teacher. Lynn Hulse refutes this, saying that the handwriting does not match existing Beeland manuscripts.|$|E
5|$|In 1909, Dudley <b>hypothesized</b> <b>that</b> the {{excitation}} of neon, at {{the time}} a recently discovered noble gas, was responsible for the appearance of the aurora borealis. While this was incorrect, his suggestion was widely reported by the media {{at the time}}.|$|E

50|$|SLA {{has been}} {{influenced}} by both linguistic and psychological theories. One of the dominant linguistic theories <b>hypothesizes</b> <b>that</b> a device or module of sorts in the brain contains innate knowledge. Many psychological theories, on the other hand, <b>hypothesize</b> <b>that</b> cognitive mechanisms, responsible for much of human learning, process language.|$|R
5|$|The mirror neuron system (MNS) theory <b>hypothesizes</b> <b>that</b> {{alterations}} to {{the development}} of the MNS interfere with imitation and lead to Asperger's core feature of social impairment. For example, one study found that activation is delayed in the core circuit for imitation in individuals with AS. This theory maps well to social cognition theories like the theory of mind, which <b>hypothesizes</b> <b>that</b> autistic behavior arises from impairments in ascribing mental states to oneself and others, or hyper-systemizing, which <b>hypothesizes</b> <b>that</b> autistic individuals can systematize internal operation to handle internal events but are less effective at empathizing by handling events generated by other agents.|$|R
5|$|In 1967, Carl Woese <b>hypothesized</b> <b>that</b> RNA {{might be}} {{catalytic}} {{and suggested that}} the earliest forms of life (self-replicating molecules) could have relied on RNA both to carry genetic information and to catalyze biochemical reactions—an RNA world.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, {{researchers}} <b>hypothesized</b> <b>that</b> smooth-edged holes {{found in}} the fossil jaws of tyrannosaurid dinosaurs such as Albertosaurus were caused by a parasite similar to Trichomonas gallinae, which infects birds. They suggested that tyrannosaurids transmitted the infection by biting each other, and that the infection impaired their ability to eat food.|$|E
5|$|Some {{scientists}} have <b>hypothesized</b> <b>that</b> {{the development of}} monothecate anthers and larger flowers (compared {{to those of the}} remaining genera in Durioneae) in the clade consisting of Durio, Boschia, and Cullenia was in conjunction with a transition from beetle pollination to vertebrate pollination.|$|E
30|$|We here <b>hypothesize</b> <b>that</b> {{deficient}} autophagy, in part {{related to}} global histone hypomethylation, {{may be involved}} in the increased osteoclast formation and activity during critical illness. We also <b>hypothesize</b> <b>that</b> autophagy inducers could reverse this osteoclast phenotype in vitro as well as the resulting bone loss in vivo in a rabbit model of critical illness.|$|R

5|$|A prion like protein, called MAVS, {{has been}} shown to misfold as part of the innate immune {{response}} against pathogenic viruses, similarly the cellular prion, PrPC {{has been shown}} to have anti HIV properties, and it is <b>hypothesized</b> <b>that</b> the misfolding of the prion in TSEs may be an antiviral response against an unknown virus.|$|E
5|$|All North American Drosera species {{except for}} D. anglica have a {{chromosome}} count of 2n=20. In 1955, Wood noted that D. anglica had a chromosome count of 2n=40, and <b>hypothesized</b> <b>that</b> {{it was of}} hybrid amphidiploid origin. Since the leaf morphology of D. anglica is an intermediary between that of D. rotundifolia and D. linearis and the two occur sympatrically in several locations, Wood conjectured that D. anglica likely originated from a hybrid between these two.|$|E
5|$|Brandon Stosuy, of Pitchfork Media, {{talked of}} a black metal {{influence}} in the album's imagery. Anderson responded to the claim of black metal influence by stating {{that he does not}} know why people compare his music to black metal; he <b>hypothesized</b> <b>that</b> it is simply the raw production of the music, or the double 'i' in the band name.|$|E

50|$|Some historians <b>hypothesize</b> <b>that</b> {{during the}} rule of the Mongols, the ethnic makeup of the {{population}} of Volga Bulgaria did not change, remaining largely Bolgar and partly Finno-Ugric. Alternatively, some <b>hypothesize</b> <b>that</b> some Kipchaks and Russians were forcibly relocated to Bulgaria. Undoubtedly, some Bulgars were forcibly relocated to the territory of modern Astrakhan Oblast, the population of which was previously nomadic.|$|R

5|$|Climate {{scientists}} have <b>hypothesized</b> <b>that</b> the jet stream will gradually weaken {{as a result}} of global warming. Trends such as Arctic sea ice decline, reduced snow cover, evapotranspiration patterns, and other weather anomalies are expected to make the Arctic heat up faster than other parts of the globe. This in turn reduces the temperature gradient that drives jet stream winds, causing the jet stream to become weaker and more variable in its course.|$|E
5|$|During {{early studies}} of the optical {{spectrum}} of the photosphere, some absorption lines were found that did not correspond to any chemical elements then known on Earth. In 1868, Norman Lockyer <b>hypothesized</b> <b>that</b> these absorption lines were caused by a new element that he dubbed helium, after the Greek Sun god Helios. Twenty-five years later, helium was isolated on Earth.|$|E
5|$|In 2003 it was <b>hypothesized</b> <b>that</b> these clumps {{could be}} caused by a roughly Neptune-mass planet having {{migrated}} from 40 to 65AU over 56millionyears, an orbit large enough to allow the formation of smaller rocky planets closer to Vega. The migration of this planet would likely require gravitational interaction with a second, higher-mass planet in a smaller orbit.|$|E
50|$|Weiss and Miller furthered {{developed}} the evaluation approach by <b>hypothesizing</b> <b>that</b> activation only increases when the actors fear a negative evaluation. This {{theory suggests that}} activation increases when the audience or other competitors cause negative feelings, such as anxiety, in the actor. However, Good's development of evaluation apprehension takes the opposite approach, where he <b>hypothesizes</b> <b>that</b> activation increases when actors expect a positive evaluation.|$|R

5|$|In 2012, it was <b>hypothesized</b> <b>that</b> 15810 Arawn {{could be}} a quasi-satellite of Pluto, a {{specific}} type of co-orbital configuration. According to the hypothesis, the object would be a quasi-satellite of Pluto for about 350,000 years out of every two-million-year period. This hypothesis was disproven in 2016, when more-accurate observations of the position of Arawn were made by New Horizons.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to his ARIA work, Fischbach also researched rapid desensitization of glutamate receptors in chicken spinal cord and rat hippocampal neurons. Using focal ionophoresis and pressure injections to apply glutamate and other agonists including NMDA, AMPA, and kainate to {{different regions of the}} neurons, he noticed that certain hot spots were desensitized more rapidly that other sites on the neuron. Fischbach and his collaborators <b>hypothesized</b> <b>that</b> these hot spots may be located at synapses between neurons, where clusters of glutamate receptors were present.|$|E
5|$|In early pregnancy, {{levels of}} estrogen, progesterone, {{estradiol}} increase, leading to breast growth {{in preparation for}} lactation. It has been <b>hypothesized</b> <b>that</b> if this process is interrupted by an abortionbefore full maturity (differentiation) in the third trimesterthen more immature cells could be left than there were prior to the pregnancy. These immature cells could then be exposed to carcinogens and hormones over time, resulting in a greater potential risk of breast cancer. This mechanism was first proposed and explored in rat studies conducted in the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{commonly}} <b>hypothesized</b> <b>that</b> Pachycephalosaurus and its relatives were the bipedal equivalents of bighorn sheep or musk oxen, where male individuals would ram each other headlong, {{and that they}} would horizontally straighten their head, neck, and body in order to transmit stress during ramming. However, there have also been alternative suggestions that the pachycephalosaurs could not have used their domes in this way.|$|E
