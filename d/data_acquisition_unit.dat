50|$|A {{quick access}} {{recorder}} (QAR) is an airborne flight recorder {{designed to provide}} quick and easy access to raw flight data, through means such as USB or cellular network connections and/or the use of standard flash memory cards.

40|$|Background: Frog’s myocardiogram {{gives the}} medical {{students}} {{a clear understanding}} of the normal sequence of atrial and ventricular contraction and the effect of temperature, sympathetic stimulation and parasympathetic stimulation on frog’s heart. The {{purpose of this study was}} to compare two methods used for recording of frogs myocardiogram, namely kymographic method and iWorx <b>data</b> <b>acquisition</b> <b>unit</b> Method, keeping in view the difference between the recordings obtained by two methods and the convenience for the medical students in recording the myocardiogram by the two methods. Method: Frog was dissected and myocardiogram recorded first with the kymograph and than with the iWorx <b>data</b> <b>acquisition</b> <b>unit.</b> Frog’s saline was pored at regular intervals and both kymographic and iWorx readings were taken thrice at an interval of 5 min. Results: In the myocardiogram height of the recording on the y-axis indicates the strength of contraction by the frog heart. The height of myocardiogram recorded on the kymographic recording at intervals of 5 min each was compared with the height of the myocardiogram recorded on iWorx <b>data</b> <b>acquisition</b> <b>unit</b> at the same time. Comparison of the results at the same time interval show that iWorx <b>data</b> <b>acquisition</b> <b>unit</b> system reflects the mechanical activity of heart better than the conventional kymographic method.
