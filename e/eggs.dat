40|$|BACKGROUND: Oral food {{challenges}} for diagnosis {{and management of}} <b>egg</b> allergy using fresh <b>egg</b> are common; however, to limit the risk of foodborne infection, many allergy units use pasteurized raw <b>egg.</b> Pasteurization and drying processes {{have the potential to}} affect the structure of <b>egg</b> proteins in <b>egg</b> powder and thus the allergenicity when compared to fresh <b>egg.</b> Our aim was to compare the binding of serum IgE from egg-allergic children to in vitro digested and undigested pasteurized whole raw <b>egg</b> powder with unpasteurized fresh whole raw <b>egg.</b> METHODS: <b>Egg</b> proteins from in vitro digested or undigested pasteurized whole raw <b>egg</b> powder, fresh whole <b>egg,</b> <b>egg</b> white and <b>egg</b> yolk were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane and incubated overnight with pooled sera from egg-allergic children. RESULTS: In both the raw <b>egg</b> samples and the pasteurized whole <b>egg</b> powder, protein bands corresponding to known molecular weights of the major <b>egg</b> allergens were present. Pasteurized whole raw <b>egg</b> powder was bound by serum IgE in a similar manner to unpasteurized whole raw <b>egg</b> and was unaffected by in vitro digestion. Serum IgE also bound <b>egg</b> yolk, indicating sensitization to both <b>egg</b> yolk and <b>egg</b> white proteins. CONCLUSIONS: The main <b>egg</b> allergens are present in pasteurized whole raw <b>egg</b> powder, and serum IgE of egg-allergic children binds to them in a similar pattern to those in fresh whole raw <b>egg.</b> Pasteurized whole raw <b>egg</b> powder is a suitable substitute for raw <b>egg</b> in clinical practice for oral food challenges.

5|$|The {{number of}} <b>eggs</b> laid depends on species, with batch sizes ranging {{from two to}} several dozen. The total number of <b>eggs</b> {{produced}} in a female's lifetime (fecundity) varies from around one hundred to several thousand. In some species, the flea lives in the nest or burrow and the <b>eggs</b> are deposited on the substrate, but in others, the <b>eggs</b> are laid on the host itself and can easily fall off onto the ground. Because of this, areas where the host rests and sleeps {{become one of the}} primary habitats of <b>eggs</b> and developing larvae. The <b>eggs</b> take around two days to two weeks to hatch. Experiments have shown that fleas lay more <b>eggs</b> on hosts which have limited food intakes, and that <b>eggs</b> and larvae survive better under these conditions, perhaps because the host's immune system is compromised.|$|E

Objective: To determine whether <b>egg</b> white-specific IgE antibodies coexist with <b>egg</b> white-specific IgG antibodies in patients with <b>egg</b> allergy featuring diarrhoea(symptoms, and whether there is any relationship between these two antibody types. Methods: A total of 89 patients with <b>egg</b> allergy featuring diarrhoeal symptoms (average age, 23. 2 years; range, 1 - 78 years), all of whom tested positive for <b>egg</b> white-specific IgG, were enrolled in this study. The concentration of total IgE, <b>egg</b> white-specific IgE and number of eosinophils in the serum were determined. Results: Among the 89 <b>egg</b> white allergic patients tested, 49 (55. 1 %) patients showed high reactivity to <b>egg</b> white-specific IgG, 48 (53. 9 %) patients had elevated serum total IgE levels, and 25 (28. 1 %) patients had elevated absolute eosinophil numbers.

Of the 25 patients who were positive for <b>egg</b> white-specific IgE antibody, 21 presented high sensitive reaction to <b>egg</b> white-specific IgG, three presented moderate sensitive reaction to <b>egg</b> white-specific IgG, and one presented mild sensitive reaction to <b>egg</b> white-specific IgG.
