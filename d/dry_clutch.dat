2500|$|This type of {{transmission}} {{was invented by}} Frenchman Adolphe Kégresse just before World War II, although he never developed a working model. The first development of the twin-clutch or dual-clutch transmission started {{in the early part}} of 1980 under the guidance of Harry Webster at Automotive Products (AP), Leamington Spa, with prototypes built into the Ford Fiesta Mk1, Ford Ranger, and Peugeot 205. Initially, the control systems were based on purely analogue/discrete digital circuitry with patents filed in July 1981. All of these early AP twin-clutch installations featured a single <b>dry</b> <b>clutch</b> and multiplate wet clutch. Following discussions with VW/Porsche, DCT work continued from Porsche in-house development, for Audi and Porsche racing cars later in the 1980s, when computers to control the transmission became compact enough: the Porsche Doppelkupplungsgetriebe (...) (PDK) used in [...] the Porsche 956 and 962 Le Mans race cars from 1983, and the Audi Sport Quattro S1.|$|E

40|$|<b>Dry</b> <b>clutches</b> {{are widely}} used in {{conventional}} and innovative automotive drivelines and represent a key element for automated manual transmissions (AMTs). In practical applications, it is fundamental to model the clutch behavior through its torque transmissibility characteristic, i. e., {{the relationship between the}} throwout bearing position (or the pressure applied by the clutch actuator) and the torque transmitted through the clutch during the engagement phase. In this paper, a new model for the torque transmissibility of <b>dry</b> <b>clutches</b> is proposed. It is analyzed how the transmissibility characteristic depends on: friction pads geometry, cushion spring compression, cushion spring load, and slip-speed-dependent friction. Corresponding functions are suitably composed determining the torque transmissibility expression. An experimental procedure for tuning the characteristic parameters is presented. The clutch-torque transmissibility model is tested on a detailed cosimulation model with a typical AMT controller...|$|R

40|$|Terrestrial eggs {{have evolved}} {{repeatedly}} in tropical anurans exposing embryos {{to the new}} threat of dehydration. Red-eyed treefrogs, Agalychnis callidryas, lay eggs on plants over water. Maternally provided water allows shaded eggs in humid sites to develop to hatching without rainfall, but unshaded eggs and those in less humid sites can die from dehydration. Hatching responses of amphibian eggs to dry conditions are known from two lineages with independent origins of terrestrial eggs. Here, we experimentally tested for dehydration-induced early hatching in another lineage (Agalychnis callidryas, Phyllomedusidae), representing a third independent origin of terrestrial eggs. We also investigated how dehydration affected egg and clutch structure, and egg mortality. We collected clutches from a pond in Gamboa, Panama, and randomly allocated them to wet or dry treatments at age 1 day. Embryos hatched earlier from <b>dry</b> <b>clutches</b> than from wet clutches, accelerating hatching by ∼ 11 %. Clutch thickness and egg diameter were affected by dehydration, diverging between treatments over time. Meanwhile, mortality in <b>dry</b> <b>clutches</b> was six-fold higher than in control clutches. With this study, early hatching responses to escape mortality from egg dehydration are now known from three anuran lineages with independent origins of terrestrial eggs, suggesting they may be widespread. Further {{studies are needed to}} understand how terrestrial amphibian eggs can respond to, or will be affected by, rapid changes in climate over the next decades...|$|R
