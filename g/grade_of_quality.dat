40|$|Abstract—Nowadays, in {{wireless}} computing, guaranteeing {{a certain}} <b>grade</b> <b>of</b> <b>Quality</b> of Service (QoS) during wireless sessions {{is an important}} issue, especially when non-tolerant applications are running into the system. Mobility and channel quality often affect system performance, depending on the grade of mobility of hosts. In this paper, providing QoS to mobile hosts belonging to a certain service class (Mobility Independent Predictive- MIP) is the main issue and a statistical multiplexing algorithm is proposed, {{in order to save}} an enormous amount of resources; {{it is based on the}} Cell Stay Time (CST) distribution analysis for a 2 -dimensional (2 D) wireless environment under the Smooth Random Mobility Model (SRMM). There are many works in literature about resource pre-reservation: they offer good QoS guarantees, but a very low system utilization, because they do not care about the fact that a passive reservation can remain unuse...|$|E

40|$|Today, food quality plays a {{more and}} more {{significant}} role for the consumer. Therefore fast monitoring of food quality in the industry gets more important. To protect consumers and always ensure the optimum <b>grade</b> <b>of</b> <b>quality,</b> critical steps during production have to be controlled, to recognise and eliminate failures. Conventional analytical methods are mostly complex and expensive. In the past decade, activities directed towards development of low cost chromatographic measurement system using metal oxide gas sensors as detectors have increased substantially. 1 - 2 However, a continuing drawback of such implementations has been the incompatibility of the chromatographic column with ambient air. Novel chromatographic columns allow measurements at room temperature and ambient air and enable the use of low-cost semiconductor gas sensors as detector unit in the gas chromatographic system. Furthermore the combination of different sensors in a single array offers the possibility to detect aromatic flavours which are, due to their similar chemical behavior, not automatically separable by the used chromatographic column. Such a low-cost gas chromatographic measurement system with gas chromatographic column and the sensory unit was set up. Different aromatic compounds occurring in food industry processes and gases which are enable inferences of food quality have been investigated. For the lab tests exemplary compounds like methyl pyrrole, hexanale, ethyl butyrate, pinene and limonene as well as ethylene and methyl mercaptan have been chosen. Out of these seven, ethyl butyrate and hex anale as well as ethyl butyrate and methyl pyrrole are not separable by the retention period through the chromatographic column. For {{the selection of the}} gas sensors commercial as well as self produced sensors have been tested. The goal was that the gas sensor array composes a well-defined fingerprint for each aromatic compound. A calculated Principal Components Analysis demonstrates that the selected sensor array can differentiate the aromatic flavours. The presented measurement system enable reliable and repeatable gas concentrations, down into the ppb-range are detectable, as well as assignable to the aromatic flavours. Next to food industry, similar processes in the pharmaceutical area offers further markets for the novel gas chromatographic measurement system...|$|E

40|$|Aim: The role of transoesophageal {{echocardiography}} in cardiac interventional structural procedures {{is well established}} and appreciated. However, the need for general anaesthesia (GA) throughout the procedure remains a controversial issue. The aim {{of the present study}} is to assess the feasibility and imaging <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> using a transnasal microrobe that allows the usage of conscious sedation in patients who undergo cardiac structural interventional procedures without missing the benefits, guidance and navigation of conventional trans-procedural TEE. Methods: We analysed the trans-procedural images of 24 consecutive patients who underwent TAVI, TMVI or ASD/PFO closure, using a transnasal 2 D microprobe (PHILIPS) and then we compared them with images taken by using a conventional 3 D TEE probe (PHILIPS). In particular, we compared the imaging <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> the two probes regarding: (1) The anatomy, visualisation of valvular calcification and transvalvular colour Doppler of the aortic and mitral valve; (2) the imaging <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> PFO, ASD and interatrial communication colour flow; (3) the imaging of left ventricle systolic function and pericardial space and (4) transgastric imaging. Results: All images were graded with a scale from 5 to 1. The average <b>grade</b> <b>of</b> imaging <b>quality</b> in the mitral valve was: anatomy, 4. 3; calcification, 3. 8; colour Doppler, 4. 2. The average <b>grade</b> <b>of</b> imaging <b>quality</b> in the aortic valve was: anatomy, 4. 3; calcification, 3. 7; colour Doppler, 4. 3. The average <b>grade</b> <b>of</b> imaging <b>quality</b> in PFO/ASD was 4. 3. The average <b>grade</b> <b>of</b> imaging <b>quality</b> in LV/pericardial space was 4. 2. The average <b>grade</b> <b>of</b> imaging <b>quality</b> in transgastric imaging was 4. 1. Conclusion: These results suggest that transnasal TEE can provide good anatomical image <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> relevant cardiac structures during cardiac structural interventions and this may facilitate these procedures being performed during conscious sedation without having to lose TEE guidance...|$|R

30|$|The {{classification}} of compost {{on the basis}} of fertilizing potential (FI) and pollution potential (CI) can be used as the tool to identify different <b>grades</b> <b>of</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> marketable compost. It also provides the information about the extent of treatment required before its application to different kinds of use. FI values of MSW compost produced in Delhi achieved the guidelines <b>of</b> <b>quality</b> control compliance, whereas CI values were much below the desired value. This might be due to excess heavy metals in the compost. There are many sources through which heavy metals (majority from electronic and electrical waste) might reach to the compost. The chances of availability of heavy metals in compost are increased when mixed waste/partially segregated waste is processed in the compost plants. The average concentrations of Zn, Cd and Ni of compost of Delhi were within the permissible limit of FCO standard, whereas the average concentrations of Cu, Pb and Cr exceeded (66.7  %) the permissible limit of FCO standard. The soil washing techniques using batch mode are the most suitable techniques for removal of heavy metals from compost, as contaminants are transferred into the liquid phase by desorption and solubilization. The treatment of compost with mixture of Na 2 S 2 O 5 (reducing reagent) and Na 2 EDTA (chelating reagent) with different concentrations may increase the removal efficiency of heavy metals from compost. The post-treatment characterization of compost will further determine the <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> compost, which can be utilized for agricultural application.|$|R

How much confidence should patients place on these recommendations? Various instruments are available to assess the <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> evidence of research, such as the revised Wong scale (R-Wong) which examines the <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> research design, methodology and data analysis, and the revision of the assessment of multiple systematic reviews (R-AMSTAR), which examines the <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> systematic reviews. The <b>Grading</b> <b>of</b> Recommendation Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) Working Group developed an instrument called the GRADE system in order to <b>grade</b> the <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> the evidence in studies and to evaluate the strength of recommendation of the intervention that is proposed in the published article. The GRADE looks at four factors to determine the <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> the evidence: study design, study quality, consistency, and directness. After combining the four components and assessing the <b>grade</b> <b>of</b> the evidence, the strength of recommendation of the intervention is established.
