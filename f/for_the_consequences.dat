5|$|The New Zealand Parliament holds {{legislative}} power {{and consists of}} the Queen and the House of Representatives. It also included an upper house, the Legislative Council, until this was abolished in 1950. The supremacy of Parliament, over the Crown and other government institutions, was established in England by the Bill of Rights 1689 and has been ratified as law in New Zealand. The House of Representatives is democratically elected and a government is formed from the party or coalition {{with the majority of}} seats. If no majority is formed, a minority government can be formed if support from other parties during confidence and supply votes is assured. The Governor-General appoints ministers under advice from the Prime Minister, who is by convention the parliamentary leader of the governing party or coalition. Cabinet, formed by ministers and led by the Prime Minister, is the highest policy-making body in government and responsible for deciding significant government actions. Members of Cabinet make major decisions collectively, and are therefore collectively responsible <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>consequences</b> of these decisions.|$|E
5|$|The defence next {{engaged in}} a lengthy direct {{examination}} of Eichmann. Observers such as Moshe Pearlman and Hannah Arendt have remarked on Eichmann's ordinariness in appearance and flat affect. In his testimony throughout the trial, Eichmann insisted {{he had no choice}} but to follow orders, as he was bound by an oath of loyalty—the same superior orders defence used by some defendants in the 1945–1946 Nuremberg trials. Eichmann asserted that the decisions had been made not by him, but by Müller, Heydrich, Himmler, and ultimately Hitler. Servatius also proposed that decisions of the Nazi government were acts of state and therefore not subject to normal judicial proceedings. Regarding the Wannsee Conference, Eichmann stated that he felt a sense of satisfaction and relief at its conclusion. As a clear decision to exterminate had been made by his superiors, the matter was out of his hands; he felt absolved of any guilt. On the last day of the examination, he stated that he was guilty of arranging the transports, but he did not feel guilty <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>consequences.</b>|$|E

25|$|In {{the view}} of the majority, Judge Stump's action passed this test. Even if his {{decision}} was erroneous, it was within his jurisdiction to consider Ora McFarlin's petition. Moreover, the parties dealt with Judge Stump in his capacity as a judge, not as a private individual. Accordingly, he could not be held liable <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>consequences</b> of his actions, even if they were arguably tragic.|$|E
25|$|In March 2008, TfL {{announced}} that it had reached agreement to buy TCL for £98m. The purchase was finalised on 28 June 2008. The background to this purchase relates to the requirement that TfL (who took over from London Regional Transport in 2000) compensates TCL <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>consequences</b> of any changes to the fares and ticketing policy introduced since 1996. In 2007 that payment was £4m, with an annual increase in rate.|$|E

25|$|The {{conclusion}} of U.S. military experts interviewed by Perry {{is that the}} IDF did not target Hamas sites specifically, simply to collapse Hamas tunnels, but rather laid down a 'walking barrage' to 'crater the neighbourhood' instead of using suppressive fire to protect their forward troops, a strategy they deemed 'indefensible'. Accounting for the high civilian casualties {{as a result of}} a Hamas strategy of using civilians as 'human shields' was dismissed by one officers as a refusal by the IDF to assume responsibility <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>consequences</b> of the strategy adopted.|$|E

25|$|Anthemius was the {{grandson}} of Flavius Philippus, praetorian prefect of the East in 346. He rose to prominence {{during the reign of}} Arcadius, when he was appointed comes sacrarum largitionum ("Count of the Sacred Largesses") around or in 400 and later magister officiorum ("Master of the Offices") in 404. He occupied the latter position during the disturbances which followed John Chrysostom's final deposition from the patriarchate (Easter, 404). John's enemies demanded troops from him with which to disperse the crowd. At first he refused, but then yielded, declaring that they were responsible <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>consequences.</b>|$|E

25|$|Moral hazard is the {{prospect}} that a party insulated from risk may behave differently from the way it would behave if it were fully exposed to the risk. A person's belief that they are responsible <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>consequences</b> of their own actions is an essential aspect of rational behavior. An investor must balance the possibility of making a return on their investment with the risk of making a loss – the risk-return relationship. A moral hazard can occur when this relationship is interfered with, often via government policy.|$|E
25|$|Initially, {{the entry}} into the war was clearly {{political}} opportunism, {{which led to a}} lack of consistency in planning, with principal objectives and enemies being changed with little regard <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>consequences.</b> Mussolini was well aware of the military and material deficiencies but thought the war would be over soon and did not expect to do much fighting. This led to confusion amongst ordinary Italians and soldiers who had little idea of what they were fighting for and, hence, had little conviction and saw little justification for it. As the war progressed and one disaster followed another, Comando Supremo were forced to take more serious steps in their planning.|$|E
25|$|Inhibition {{conflict}} is a cognitive function that arises in people and {{allows them to}} {{make decisions based on}} immediate stimuli and stimuli that require a higher level of processing. In sober individuals, situations that produce an inhibition conflict would consist of one set of salient cues (external stimuli) that stimulate a certain response and other cues (internal stimuli such as possible negative consequences or societal standards and norms) that would inhibit the salient cues and therefore prevent rash action. Those influenced by alcohol myopia are unable to comprehend this second set of cues, as the condition narrows an individual’s ability for higher-level cognitive functioning. Therefore, these individuals tend to act rashly without consideration <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>consequences</b> of their actions.|$|E

25|$|The ministers {{emphasised}} {{the need}} to unite {{on the issue of}} Doha round of negotiations. This is supported by increased consultations, by IBSA delegations, in order to strengthen Non-Agricultural Market Access (NAMA), as well as the establishment of the NAMA-11 whose two main principles are supporting flexibilities for developing countries and balance between NAMA and other areas under negotiation. The Ministers took note of the broader objectives of the European Union proposed Registration, Evaluation and Authorization and restriction of Chemicals (REACH) Legislation, in respect of the protection of human health and the environment. They expressed their concern <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>consequences</b> REACH may have on the developing economies of the South. Such consequences will negatively affect the attainment of the Millennium Development Goals in these countries. The ministers urged the EU to give due consideration to these consequences and also ensure that REACH does not become a Technical Barrier to Trade (TBT).|$|E

500|$|Junpei is {{a rather}} upbeat sophomore at Gekkoukan High School who loves {{cracking}} jokes.

Junpei has a habit of charging headfirst into situations without much thought <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>consequences</b> of his actions. He develops a rivalry with Makoto despite sharing a close bond with him. Junpei's Persona is Hermes. Toriumi stated that since his character was the same role given to him in the Persona 3 game, he had not changed much of his voice mechanics. He also credited the script for having a [...] "well summarized storyline of the game" [...] and was further impressed by how well the film's depictions of social life and battling were balanced together.|$|E
500|$|After the League of Nations failed as an {{effective}} international body, Koht again favoured the strict neutrality policy to which Norway had adhered before the League of Nations membership. For many years, {{he was reluctant to}} an expansion of a Norwegian military defense capacity. He did not vehemently and principally oppose such an expansion, and had been quite friendly to the principle of a national defense in the past. His neutrality policy nonetheless put him on the [...] "defense-skeptical" [...] side together with Johan Nygaardsvold and most of his cabinet. Among the more [...] "defense-friendly" [...] in and around the cabinet, not the least from 1936, were Trygve Bratteli, Haakon Lie, Finn Moe, Trygve Lie, Oscar Torp, Martin Tranmæl and Minister of Defense Fredrik Monsen.

500|$|According to writer Joseph Maddrey, [...] "A Song for Simeon" [...] shares themes {{with his}} more famous {{conversion}} poem [...] "Ash Wednesday", the first parts of which Eliot was writing when [...] "A Song for Simeon" [...] was written and published. Eliot uses the biblical story of Simeon {{to illustrate the}} [...] "contrast between appearance and reality and humbly begs God to teach him the stillness that unifies the two". Eliot's Ariel poems and [...] "Ash Wednesday" [...] explore this new experience of conversion and {{the progress of the}} soul. Scofield writes that Eliot's depiction of Simeon presents [...] "a figure to whom revelation has been granted but to whom it has come too late for this life". [...] But as he awaits the death for which he asks, Simeon sees the consequences of the turning of faith to this new child and his mission. Simeon wants nothing of this [...] "time of sorrow" [...] and that the fate of persecution <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>consequences</b> of faith is not for him.|$|E
