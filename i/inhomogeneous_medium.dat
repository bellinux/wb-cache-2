The <b>inhomogeneous</b> layered <b>medium</b> is modeled by a generalized n-layered stratified media. The numerical method was adopted from the physics-based two-grid method (PBTG). To ensure the strict accuracy requirement while to relief the memory and CPU resources, the PBTG {{in conjunction with}} the sparse-matrix canonical grid method (SMCG) was used in this paper. In so doing the reflected terms of the dyadic Green’s function that accounts for layered media were added into the integral equations governing the surface tangential fields. Since the reflected part of the dyadic Green’s function does not 182 Chen et al. contain any singularity, the normal components of the fields remain the same {{as in the case of}} homogeneous surfaces. It was found that the elements of Green’s tensor are only important to the near-field since they decay very fast as spatial distance goes beyond a few wavelengths. The resulting integral equations are then solved by the Method of Moment (MoM). Comparisons between the inhomogeneous and the homogeneous rough surfaces suggest that the presence of the <b>inhomogeneous</b> layered <b>medium</b> has non-negligible contributions to emission, depending on the dielectric gradient and is polarization dependent. 1...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—A non-canonical <b>inhomogeneous</b> {{background}} <b>medium</b> is {{one whose}} Green’s function cannot {{be obtained by}} an analytical method. Electromagnetic scattering from objects embedded in a non-canonical <b>inhomogeneous</b> background <b>medium</b> is very challenging because of the computational complexity with the calculation of its Green’s function and the multiple scattering between objects and the background. This work applies the Diagonal Tensor Approximation (DTA) to calculate the scattering from arbitrary objects in a non-canonical inhomogeneous background. Previously, the DTA has only been applied to a canonical background such as a homogeneous or layered background media. This approach employs a numerical method to obtain all Green’s functions required in the calculation; an accurate DTA {{is used to calculate}} the scattering properties. In order to reduce the large number of simulations, we employ the symmetry and reciprocity in the Green’s function calculation. Furthermore, considering that most realistic imaging measurements are made through a voltage probe usually represented by a wave port, we develop a method to convert the scattered field on the probe (the antenna) to the measured wave port voltage. Numerical results show that this method can obtain accurate scattering characteristics from arbitrary objects in a non-canonical <b>inhomogeneous</b> background <b>medium</b> in a microwave imaging system...|$|R

The contrast source inversion method is a nonlinear iterative method that alternatively reconstructs contrast sources and contrast function.

Another attractive feature of the inversion method is that it is of strong capability in dealing with nonlinear inverse problems in an <b>inhomogeneous</b> background <b>medium,</b> because a finite-difference operator is used to represent the differential operator governing the two-dimensional elastic wave propagation. Additionally, the techniques of a multiplicative regularization and a sequential multifrequency inversion are employed to enhance the quality of reconstructions for this inversion method.
