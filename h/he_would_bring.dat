5|$|John M. Harlan's health {{began to}} {{deteriorate}} {{towards the end}} of his career. His eyesight began to fail during the late 1960s. To cover this, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>bring</b> materials to within an inch of his eyes, and have clerks and his wife read to him (once when the Court took an obscenity case, a chagrined Harlan had his wife read him Lady Chatterley's Lover). Gravely ill, he retired from the Supreme Court on September 23, 1971.|$|E
5|$|Presently Alcibiades {{sailed to}} Tissaphernes with a {{detachment}} of ships. According to Plutarch, the supposed {{purpose of this}} mission was to stop the Persian fleet from coming {{to the aid of}} the Peloponnesians. Thucydides is in agreement with Plutarch that the Persian fleet was at Aspendus and that Alcibiades told the troops <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>bring</b> the fleet to their side or prevent it from coming at all, but Thucydides further speculates that the real reason was to flaunt his new position to Tissaphernes and try to gain some real influence over him. According to the historian, Alcibiades had long known that Tissaphernes never meant to bring the fleet at all.|$|E
5|$|The feud between Bad News Brown and Jake Roberts {{began when}} Roberts sent Brown a {{birthday}} present on the April 22 episode of Wrestling Challenge. Upon opening the package, Brown found a rubber snake; {{it was revealed that}} Brown was afraid of snakes. On the May 5 episode of WWF Superstars, the two men agreed to a match; Brown later claimed that his fear of snakes was cured, although he was quickly proven wrong. On the July 28 episode of WWF Superstars, it was announced that Brown and Roberts face each other at SummerSlam with the Big Boss Man as a special referee. Brown also announced that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>bring</b> 200 pounds of Harlem sewer rats to counteract Roberts's boa constrictor, Damien.|$|E

However, in January 1788, he was taken ill with a probable stress-related condition, now thought to be ulcerative colitis. It was several months before {{he was able to}} resume work, and he spent time convalescing at Bath and Cambridge. His regular bouts of gastrointestinal illnesses precipitated the use of moderate quantities of opium, which proved effective in alleviating his condition, and which he continued to use {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E
5|$|With {{losses of}} $60,000 over the {{previous}} two seasons, the Canadiens were put up for sale in 1935. Dandurand and Cattarinich entered negotiations to sell the club and move it to Cleveland, Ohio, but a syndicate of local Montreal businessmen led by Maurice Forget and Ernest Savard stepped forward to buy the team and prevent the transfer. The Canadiens struggled on the ice, finishing with the worst record {{in the league in}} 1935â€“36. The new owners asked Cecil Hart to coach the team, in the hopes that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>bring</b> the Habs back to respectability. Hart agreed with one stipulation: that the Canadiens bring back Morenz. The team agreed, and acquired an overjoyed Morenz in a trade with the New York Rangers.|$|E
5|$|As Khalid was the {{architect}} {{of most of the}} early Muslim military doctrines, he was also the pioneer of almost every major tactic that Muslims used during Early Islamic conquests. One of Khalid's major achievements in this context was utilizing the individual skills of Arab Bedouin warriors to a larger scale. He is believed to have developed them into an almost regular unit called Mubarizun ("champions"), who would issue personal challenges to the enemy officers. These were highly trained and skilled swordsmen, whom Khalid utilized effectively to slay as many enemy officers as possible, giving a psychological blow to enemy morale. The Battle of Ajnadayn is perhaps the best example of this form of psychological warfare. Moreover, his biggest achievement was the conversion of Arab tactical doctrine into a strategic system. Until Khalid, the Arabs were basically raiders and skirmishers. Khalid turned those skirmishing tactics into something that could be used anywhere. Thus he would skirmish the enemy to death: <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>bring</b> his army in front of his enemies and wait until the whole battle degenerated into a skirmishing affair between small units. Then, after exhausting the enemy units, he would launch his cavalry at their flanks employing Hammer and Anvil tactics.|$|E

5|$|Thorpe {{was the son}} and {{grandson}} of Conservative MPs, but decided to align with the small and ailing Liberal Party. After studying at Oxford University {{he became one of}} the Liberals' brightest stars in the 1950s. He entered parliament at the age of 30, made a rapid mark, and was elected party leader in 1967. After an uncertain start during which the party lost ground, Thorpe capitalised on the growing unpopularity of the Conservative and Labour parties to lead the Liberals through a period of notable electoral success. This culminated in the general election of February 1974, when the party won 6 million votes. Under the first-past-the-post electoral system this gave them only 14 seats, but with the election having resulted in a hung parliament with no party having an overall majority, Thorpe was in a strong position. He was offered a cabinet post by the Conservative prime minister, Edward Heath, if <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>bring</b> the Liberals into a coalition. His price for such a deal, reform of the electoral system, was rejected by Heath, who resigned in favour of a minority Labour government.|$|E
5|$|Redeemed Warrior - The Redeemed Warrior, also {{referred}} to as the champion, is the unnamed protagonist of the graphic novel Rise of the Warrior who becomes the player's multiplayer character in Ascension. In Rise of the Warrior, it is shown that he was a native of Kirra whose father was killed by a general. Before dying, the warrior swore to his father that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>bring</b> no harm to his family. The warrior then gathered soldiers of the village and sought after the general, also recruiting the witch Circe. Finding the general, he discovered that the general was actually his uncle and Circe's lover. After negotiations, the warrior tricked his uncle into drinking poisonous Cerberus blood, killing his uncle. Circe was aghast and fled. Because he killed his uncle, it broke his oath to his father. The Giver appeared, revealing himself to be Orkos, and imprisoned the warrior in the Prison of the Damned. In Ascension during Kratos' pursuit of Megaera, Kratos encountered the warrior, who was rejoiced to see an opportunity for freedom from his prison. Before being attacked by an arm of the Hecatonchires, the warrior vanished in a beam of light upon praying to the gods. This transported him to the Rotunda of Olympus. There, he started his trials for redemption to become a champion of the gods and was given a choice to either swear an allegiance to Ares, Hades, Poseidon, or Zeus. Several people are credited for the character in Ascensions multiplayer: Dave Carter, Neil Kaplan, Kevin Killebrew, Alem Brhan Sapp, Isaac C. Singleton Jr., Anthony Skordi, and Jimmie Wood.|$|E

This was due to the protracted tribal dispute between the Konkomba people and the Nanumba people. He has served on many committees in both the Ghanaian parliament and the Pan-African Parliament.

The prosecutor handling the investigation said <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>bring</b> commercial fraud charges that could result in imprisonment for the violators. The producers in question were suspected of adding wine made from non-approved grapes {{in order to make it}} more appealing to the international market. In response the U.S. government blocked imports of Brunello that did not have proof that they were in fact 100% Sangiovese. The scandal was coined Brunellopoli by the Italian wine press.|$|E

Jason later gifted Sam with the star necklace on May 11, 2005 and Sam wore the necklace daily.|$|E

He had informed {{the house that}} <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>bring</b> a full Budget to the House {{when he made his}} 'little budget' speech prior to the election. The main point of his budget was the introduction of a Selective Employment Tax, penalising the service industry and favouring the manufacturing industry. Twelve days after the budget, the National Union of Seamen called a national strike and the problems facing Sterling were multiplied. Additional strikes caused the balance of payments deficit to increase and the 3.3billion loan was now due. Unemployment was also rising; it had been just over 300,000 when Labour came to power, but two years later it was climbed to more than 500,000.|$|E
