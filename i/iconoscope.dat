25|$|Vladimir K. Zworykin Invented the <b>Iconoscope</b> image {{pickup tube}} for RCA early {{television}} camera video system.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} American <b>iconoscope</b> was noisy, {{had a high}} {{ratio of}} interference to signal, and ultimately gave disappointing results, especially {{when compared to the}} high definition mechanical scanning systems then becoming available. The EMI team under the supervision of Isaac Shoenberg analyzed how the <b>iconoscope</b> (or Emitron) produces an electronic signal and concluded that its real efficiency was only about 5% of the theoretical maximum. They solved this problem by developing and patenting in 1934 two new camera tubes dubbed super-Emitron and CPS Emitron. The super-Emitron was between ten and fifteen times more sensitive than the original Emitron and <b>iconoscope</b> tubes and, in some cases, this ratio was considerably greater. It was used for an outside broadcasting by the BBC, for the first time, on Armistice Day 1937, when the general public could watch in a television set how the King lay a wreath at the Cenotaph. This {{was the first time that}} anyone could broadcast a live street scene from cameras installed on the roof of neighbor buildings, because neither Farnsworth nor RCA could do the same before the 1939 New York World's Fair.|$|E
25|$|The first space {{television}} system was called Seliger-Tral-D {{and was used}} aboard Vostok. Vostok {{was based on an}} earlier videophone project which used two cameras, with persistent LI-23 <b>iconoscope</b> tubes. Its output was 10 frames per second at 100 lines per frame video signal.|$|E
50|$|By late 1930s, dissectors were {{replaced}} by more efficient <b>iconoscopes.</b>|$|R
25|$|American {{television}} broadcasting {{at the time}} consisted {{of a variety of}} markets {{in a wide range of}} sizes, each competing for programming and dominance with separate technology, until deals were made and standards agreed upon in 1941. RCA, for example, used only <b>Iconoscopes</b> in the New York area, but Farnsworth Image Dissectors in Philadelphia and San Francisco. In September 1939, RCA agreed to pay the Farnsworth Television and Radio Corporation royalties over the next ten years for access to Farnsworth's patents. With this historic agreement in place, RCA integrated much of what was best about the Farnsworth Technology into their systems. In 1941, the United States implemented 525-line television.|$|R
25|$|As was {{the case}} with {{black-and-white}} television, an electronic means of scanning would be superior to the mechanical systems like Baird's. The obvious solution on the broadcast end would be to use three conventional <b>Iconoscopes</b> with colored filters in front of them to produce an RGB signal. Using three separate tubes each looking at the same scene would produce slight differences in parallax between the frames, so in practice a single lens was used with a mirror or prism system to separate the colors for the separate tubes. Each tube captured a complete frame and the signal was converted into radio in a fashion essentially identical to the existing black-and-white systems.|$|R
25|$|The {{ingredients}} for inventing the photomultiplier were coming together during the 1920s as {{the pace of}} vacuum tube technology accelerated. The primary goal for many, if not most, workers was {{the need for a}} practical television camera technology. Television had been pursued with primitive prototypes for decades prior to the 1934 introduction of the first practical camera (the <b>iconoscope).</b> Early prototype television cameras lacked sensitivity. Photomultiplier technology was pursued to enable television camera tubes, such as the <b>iconoscope</b> and (later) the orthicon, to be sensitive enough to be practical. So the stage was set to combine the dual phenomena of photoemission (i.e., the photoelectric effect) with secondary emission, both of which had already been studied and adequately understood, to create a practical photomultiplier.|$|E
25|$|It {{was clear}} {{to a number of}} {{developers}} that a completely electronic scanning system would be superior, and that the scanning could be achieved in a vacuum tube via electrostatic or magnetic means. Converting this concept into a usable system took years of development and several independent advances. The two key advances were Philo Farnsworth's electronic scanning system, and Vladimir Zworykin's <b>Iconoscope</b> camera. The <b>Iconoscope,</b> based on Kálmán Tihanyi's early patents, superseded the Farnsworth-system. With these systems, the BBC began regularly scheduled black-and-white television broadcasts in 1936, but these were shut down again with the start of World War II in 1939. In this time thousands of television sets had been sold. The receivers developed for this program, notably those from Pye Ltd., {{played a key role in}} the development of radar.|$|E
25|$|In 1939, Hungarian {{engineer}} Peter Carl Goldmark {{introduced an}} electro-mechanical system while at CBS, which contained an <b>Iconoscope</b> sensor. The CBS field-sequential color system was partly mechanical, with a disc made of red, blue, and green filters spinning inside the television camera at 1,200 rpm, {{and a similar}} disc spinning in synchronization {{in front of the}} cathode ray tube inside the receiver set. The system was first demonstrated to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) on August 29, 1940, and shown to the press on September 4.|$|E

25|$|Getters act by {{chemically}} {{combining with}} residual or infiltrating gases, but {{are unable to}} counteract (non-reactive) inert gases. A known problem, mostly affecting valves with large envelopes such as cathode ray tubes and camera tubes such as <b>iconoscopes,</b> orthicons, and image orthicons, comes from helium infiltration. The effect appears as impaired or absent functioning, and as a diffuse glow along the electron stream inside the tube. This effect cannot be rectified (short of re-evacuation and resealing), and is responsible for working examples of such tubes becoming rarer and rarer. Unused ("New Old Stock") tubes can also exhibit inert gas infiltration, {{so there is no}} long-term guarantee of these tube types surviving into the future.|$|R
25|$|Television {{broadcasting}} in Japan {{started in}} August 28, 1953, making the country {{one of the}} first in the world with an experimental television service. The first television tests were conducted as early as 1926 using a combined mechanical Nipkow disk and electronic Braun tube system, later switching to an all-electronic system in the 1935 using a domestically developed <b>iconoscope</b> system. In spite of that, because of the beginning of World War II in the Pacific region, this first full-fledged TV broadcast experimentation lasted only a few months. Regular television broadcasts would eventually start in 1953.|$|E
25|$|Electromechanical {{broadcasts}} {{began in}} Germany in 1929, but were without sound until 1934. Network electronic service started on March 22, 1935, on 180 lines using telecine transmission of film, intermediate film system, or cameras using the Nipkow Disk. Transmissions using cameras {{based on the}} <b>iconoscope</b> began on January 15, 1936. The Berlin Summer Olympic Games were televised, using both all-electronic iconoscope-based cameras and intermediate film cameras, to Berlin and Hamburg in August 1936. Twenty-eight public television rooms were opened for anybody who did not own a television set. The Germans had a 441-line system {{on the air in}} February 1937, and during World War II brought it to France, where they broadcast from the Eiffel Tower.|$|E
2500|$|According to Albert Abramson, Zworykin's {{experiments}} {{started in}} April 1931, {{and after the}} achievement of the first promising experimental transmitters, on October 23, 1931, it was decided that the new camera tube would be named the <b>iconoscope.</b> Zworykin presented his <b>iconoscope</b> to RCA in 1922. He continued work on it, and ...|$|E
5000|$|On {{the other}} side of the ocean, the RCA team led by Albert Rose began working in 1937 on a low-velocity {{scanning}} beam device they dubbed the orthicon. Iams and Rose solved the problem of guiding the beam and keeping it in focus by installing specially designed deflection plates and deflection coils near the charge storage plate to provide auniform axial magnetic field. The orthicon was the tube used in RCA's television demonstration at the 1939 New York World's Fair, its performance was similar to the image <b>iconoscope's</b> one, but it was also unstable under sudden flashes of bright light, producing [...] "the appearance of a large drop of water evaporating slowly over part of the scene".|$|R

Electrical engineer Benjamin Adler played a prominent role in the development of television.|$|R

2500|$|On {{the other}} hand, in 1934, Zworykin shared some patent rights with the German {{licensee}} company Telefunken. The [...] "image iconoscope" [...] ("Superikonoskop" [...] in Germany) was produced {{as a result}} of the collaboration. This tube is essentially identical to the super-Emitron. The production and commercialization of the super-Emitron and image <b>iconoscope</b> in Europe were not affected by the patent war between Zworykin and Farnsworth, because Dieckmann and Hell had priority in Germany for the invention of the image dissector, having submitted a patent application for their Lichtelektrische Bildzerlegerröhre für Fernseher (Photoelectric Image Dissector Tube for Television) in Germany in 1925, two years before Farnsworth did the same in the United States. The image <b>iconoscope</b> (Superikonoskop) became the industrial standard for public broadcasting in Europe from 1936 until 1960, when it was replaced by the vidicon and plumbicon tubes. Indeed, it was the representative of the European tradition in electronic tubes competing against the American tradition represented by the image orthicon. The German company Heimann produced the Superikonoskop for the 1936 Berlin Olympic Games, later Heimann also produced and commercialized it from 1940 to 1955, finally the Dutch company Philips produced and commercialized the image <b>iconoscope</b> and multicon from 1952 to 1958.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the video}} game Trenched, renamed as Iron Brigade, the main {{antagonist}} is a character named Vladamir Farnsworth, who created mechanical enemies known as [...] "Tubes" [...] which spread a deadly broadcast. This character name is alluding to Philo Farnsworth and Vladimir K. Zworykin, who invented the <b>iconoscope.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In 1933 RCA {{introduced}} an improved camera tube that relied on Tihanyi's charge storage principle. Dubbed the <b>Iconoscope</b> by Zworykin, the new tube had a light sensitivity of about 75,000 lux, and thus was {{claimed to be}} much more sensitive than Farnsworth's image dissector. However, Farnsworth had overcome his power problems with his Image Dissector through the invention of a completely unique [...] "multipactor" [...] device that he began work on in 1930, and demonstrated in 1931. This small tube could amplify a signal reportedly to the 60th power or better and showed great promise in all fields of electronics. A problem with the multipactor, unfortunately, was that it wore out at an unsatisfactory rate.|$|E
2500|$|In 1930, Vladimir Zworykin, who {{had been}} {{developing}} his own all-electronic television system at Westinghouse in Pittsburgh since 1923, but which {{he had never been}} able to make work or satisfactorily demonstrate to his superiors, was recruited by RCA to lead its television development department. Before leaving his old employer, Zworykin visited Farnsworth's laboratory and was sufficiently impressed with the performance of the Image Dissector that he reportedly had his team at Westinghouse make several copies of the device for experimentation. But Zworykin later abandoned research on the Image Dissector, which at the time required extremely bright illumination of its subjects to be effective, and turned his attention to what would become the <b>Iconoscope.</b> In a 1970s series of videotaped interviews, Zworykin recalled that, [...] "Farnsworth was closer to this thing you're using now [...] than anybody, because he used the cathode-ray tube for transmission. But, Farnsworth didn't have the mosaic , he didn't have storage. Therefore, [...] definition was very low.... But he was very proud, and he stuck to his method." [...] Contrary to Zworykin's statement, Farnsworth's patent #2,087,683 for the Image Dissector (filed April 26, 1933) features the [...] "charge storage plate" [...] invented by Tihanyi in 1928 and a [...] "low velocity" [...] method of electron scanning, also describes [...] "discrete particles" [...] whose [...] "potential" [...] is manipulated and [...] "saturated" [...] to varying degrees depending on their velocity. Farnsworth's patent numbers 2,140,695 and 2,233,888 are for a [...] "charge storage dissector" [...] and [...] "charge storage amplifier," [...] respectively.|$|E
50|$|A {{scientist}} invents {{a television}} called the <b>Iconoscope,</b> which thieves try to steal. The term <b>iconoscope</b> was actually used {{in real life}} for certain television vacuum tubes.|$|E
50|$|The <b>iconoscope</b> was {{replaced}} in Europe around 1936 by {{the much more}} sensitive Super-Emitron and Superikonoskop, while in the United States the <b>Iconoscope</b> was the leading camera tube used for broadcasting from 1936 until 1946, when it {{was replaced}} by the image orthicon tube.|$|E

50|$|The <b>iconoscope</b> was {{presented}} to the general public at a press conference in June 1933, and two detailed technical papers were published in September and October of the same year. Unlike the Farnsworth image dissector, the Zworykin <b>iconoscope</b> was much more sensitive, useful with an illumination on the target between 4ft-c (43lx) and 20ft-c (215lx). It was also easier to manufacture and produced a very clear image. The <b>iconoscope</b> was the primary camera tube used by RCA broadcasting from 1936 until 1946, when it was replaced by the image orthicon tube.|$|E
