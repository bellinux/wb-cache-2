Firstly, I predict and find that variation in an estimate affects not only investors’ judgment on a related issue but also their future judgments on an unrelated issue. Secondly, I predict and find that investors are more sensitive to variations in an estimate when information contained in the estimate presents less threat to their preferred conclusions than when it presents greater threat. Finally, I predict and find that investors perceive more uncertainty regarding the association between the disclosed risk factor and the <b>estimated</b> <b>financial</b> <b>reporting</b> item in the estimate when the information presents greater threat...|$|R

40|$|The FASB {{adopted a}} balance sheet-based model of <b>financial</b> <b>reporting</b> about 30 years ago, and this {{model has been}} {{gradually}} expanded and solidified to become the required norm around the world today. Currently, the FASB and the IASB are re-considering their Conceptual Framework, {{and this is the}} right time to have a much-needed debate about the proper conceptual foundations of accounting. This paper argues that the balance sheet orientation of accounting standard-setting is flawed, for the following reasons: 1. Accounting is supposed to reflect business reality, and thus the essential features of the <b>financial</b> <b>reporting</b> model need to reflect the essential features of the underlying business model. However, the balance sheet orientation of <b>financial</b> <b>reporting</b> is at odds with the economic process of advancing expenses to earn revenues, which governs how most businesses create value, and which represents how managers and investors view most firms. 2. The adoption of the balance sheet approach was driven by conceptual considerations; standard setters argued that the concept of assets is more fundamental and logically prior to the concept of income. However, this paper argues that the concept of income is clearer and practically more useful than the concept of assets, especially with the recent proliferation of intangible assets. 3. Earnings {{is the single most important}} output of the accounting system. Thus, intuitively, improved <b>financial</b> <b>reporting</b> should lead to improved usefulness of earnings. However, the continual expansion of the balance sheet approach is gradually destroying the forward-looking usefulness of earnings, mainly through the effect of various asset re-valuations, which manifest as noise in the process of generating normal operating earnings. During the last 40 years, the volatility of reported earnings has doubled and the persistence of earnings has gone down by about a third, while there is little change in the properties of the underlying business fundamentals. 4. The balance sheet approach has pushed accounting into incorporating more and more valuation <b>estimates</b> into <b>financial</b> <b>reports,</b> creating tautological and dangerous feedback loops between financial markets and the real economy. The paper concludes with two suggestions about a "good" model of <b>financial</b> <b>reporting.</b> The first suggestion is that accounting needs to make a sharp theoretical and practical distinction between operating and financing-type activities and assets, and this distinction needs to be reflected in all financial statements. The second suggestion is that for most firms the accounting for operating activities needs a renewed emphasis on the principle of matching of expenses to revenues...|$|R

40|$|Abstract]: This {{research}} investigated {{whether the}} formation of audit committees and their characteristics are associated with improved <b>financial</b> <b>reporting</b> quality. Modified versions of the models developed by Jones (1991) and Dechow and Dichev (2002) provided three measures of earnings quality, which were used to proxy for <b>financial</b> <b>reporting</b> quality. The audit committee characteristics investigated were: independence, expertise, activity, size and tenure. Several contributions to knowledge are made by this research. First, this research examined the association between audit committee formation and <b>financial</b> <b>reporting</b> quality. This could not be done {{in many of the}} prior studies that used data on companies in the United States (Klein 2002 a; Xie, Davidson and DaDalt 2003 a; Bedard, Chtourou and Courteau 2004; Vafeas 2005; Yang and Krishnan 2005; Dhaliwal, Naiker and Navissi 2006), where audit committees have been mandatory for companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange since 1978. A large number of public and private sector groups have recommended mandatory audit committee establishment for all Australian listed companies. However, there has been a lack of empirical support for these recommendations and this research provides evidence regarding this association. Second, audit committees are more heavily regulated in the United States than Australia. Given the relative lack of audit committee regulation for Australian companies, Australia represented a richer empirical setting for the examination of the association between audit committee characteristics and <b>financial</b> <b>reporting</b> quality. The use of Australian company data for the selected time period, avoided the confounding effect of regulation on this association. Third, this research used both {{a modified version of the}} traditional Jones (1991) discretionary accruals model and the more recently developed accrual estimation error model from Dechow and Dichev (2002) to <b>estimate</b> proxies for <b>financial</b> <b>reporting</b> quality. Most of the prior studies predominantly used the Jones (1991) model, which has been subject to criticism in the literature. Therefore, the use of multiple models provides more powerful tests of the association between audit committees and <b>financial</b> <b>reporting</b> quality. Finally, this research included changes tests in addition to cross-sectional tests to reduce the likelihood of problems with omitted variables. Several conclusions can be drawn from the results. First, there was some evidence that earnings quality measured using the modified Jones (1991) model significantly reduced in the year following audit committee formation, thus providing some support for the notion that {{the formation of}} audit committees improves <b>financial</b> <b>reporting</b> quality. However, a comparison of these results with those of tests using earnings quality measures based on Dechow and Dichev (2002) indicates that audit committees appear more effective at reducing opportunistic earnings management, rather than total accrual estimation errors. Second, there was little evidence of a significant association between the characteristics of audit committees and improved <b>financial</b> <b>reporting</b> quality. Consequently, it can be suggested that, once audit committees are established, variations in their characteristics do not significantly affect <b>financial</b> <b>reporting</b> quality. These conclusions provide support for the mandatory audit committee requirement under the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) listing rules, which became effective from 1 January 2003. However, there are doubts over the usefulness of several aspects of the ASX Corporate Governance Council's recommendations concerning the composition and size of audit committees...|$|R

The view is that comparability between companies’ <b>financial</b> <b>reports</b> will result in greater transparency and more efficient capital markets and will improve the quality of the <b>financial</b> <b>reports.</b> A major step in this harmonization work is that more than 120 countries now follow International <b>Financial</b> <b>Reporting</b> Standards (IFRS). The fact that many countries today follow the same set of accounting standards means that harmonization has taken place at a de jure level, but it is unclear whether harmonized standards have also led to harmonization in practice (de facto harmonization). The aim of comparable financial information will be achieved only when the standards are applied consistently. The study investigates the factors that influence how individuals apply <b>financial</b> <b>reporting</b> standards in practice and whether conceptions of <b>financial</b> <b>reporting</b> vary between individuals. The investigation consists of a study of annual reports from the years 1930 to 2012, as well as interviews with a number of individuals responsible for <b>financial</b> <b>reporting</b> within the Volvo Group. The interviews were then analyzed using the phenomenographic research method with a view to identifying the different qualitative conceptions of <b>financial</b> <b>reporting.</b> The areas of <b>financial</b> <b>reporting</b> that were the focus of the study are revenue and provisions. In addition to factors identified in prior literature, a finding of the study is that a significant factor in the application of the {{standards is}} individuals’ conceptions of <b>financial</b> <b>reporting.</b> For example, this includes views on who is the primary user of financial information, the fundamental principles that form the basis for <b>financial</b> <b>reporting,</b> how standards have been designed and how individual transactions are to be reflected in the <b>financial</b> <b>reporting.</b> Five qualitatively different ways of looking at <b>financial</b> <b>reporting</b> are identified, indicating that conceptions of <b>financial</b> <b>reporting</b> have not developed in harmony with the standards.
