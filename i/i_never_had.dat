5|$|In 2011, The Exorcist was re-released in a 40th Anniversary Edition in paperback, hardcover, and {{audiobook}} formats {{with new}} cover artwork. As described by Blatty, this new, updated edition features new and revised material. The 40th Anniversary Edition of The Exorcist {{will have a}} touch of new material in {{it as part of}} an all-around polish of the dialogue and prose. First time around <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> the time (meaning the funds) to do a second draft, and this, finally, is it. With forty years to think about it, a few little changes were inevitable – plus one new character in a totally new very spooky scene. This is the version I would like to be remembered for. Tor/Forge have also re-published The Ninth Configuration and Legion, with new, updated cover artwork.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of September 11, 2001, MacFarlane was {{scheduled}} to return to Los Angeles on American Airlines Flight 11 from Boston. Suffering from a hangover after the previous night's celebrations that followed his speech at his alma mater, the Rhode Island School of Design, and with an incorrect departure time (8:15a.m. instead of 7:45a.m.) from his travel agent, he arrived at Logan International Airport about ten minutes too late to board the flight as the gates had been closed. Fifteen minutes after departure, American Airlines Flight 11 was hijacked, and at 8:46a.m. it was flown into the North Tower of the World Trade Center, killing everyone on board. MacFarlane said,The only reason it hasn't really affected me as it maybe could have is I didn't really know that I was in any danger until after it was over, so <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> that panic moment. After the fact, it was sobering, but people {{have a lot of}} close calls; you're crossing the street and you almost get hit by a car..... this one just happened to be related to something massive. I really can't let it affect me because I'm a comedy writer. I have to put that {{in the back of my}} head.|$|E
25|$|<b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> a pupil {{who made}} such {{acquisitions}} {{of knowledge in}} so short a time; his attainments in mathematics and classics are far beyond the majority of youths at his age, and would warrant anyone conversant {{with the state of}} education in the Universities in predicting a brilliant career for him, should he ever have that path open to him. I think, however, that the development of his mind is still more remarkable than the amount of his knowledge.|$|E

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> her {{ring off}} my finger by day or night, {{except for an}} instant at a time, to wash my hands, since she died. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> her {{sweetness}} and excellence absent from my mind so long. I can solemnly say that, waking or sleeping, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> lost the recollection of our hard trial and sorrow, and I feel that <b>I</b> <b>never</b> shall.|$|R
5000|$|... "Somehow I {{became the}} Rocket Queen. And <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never,</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never,</b> said, 'I'm the Rocket Queen'. It's just not me. The real Rocket Queen is Barbi." ...|$|R
25|$|At {{this time}} I visited {{one of our}} Advent sisters, {{and in the morning}} we bowed around the family altar. It was not an {{exciting}} occasion, and there were but five of us present, all females. While praying, the power of God came upon me as <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> felt it before, and I was wrapt up in a vision of God's glory, and seemed to be rising higher and higher from the earth and was shown something of the travels of the Advent people to the Holy City...|$|E
25|$|Reflecting on {{her work}} in musical films, Powell said: People are always fascinated by the {{so-called}} golden age of musicals, but it wasn’t all that great. Everything was glazed. Those movies didn’t reflect reality. I was at MGM for 11 years and nobody ever let me play anything but teenagers. I was 25 years old with kids of my own and it was getting ridiculous. Publicity was froth. Everything you said was monitored. With me, they didn’t have to worry. <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> anything to say, anyway. It was hard work, I had no friends, no social interaction with people my age and the isolation was tough. But I had to support my family, so I did what I was told and had no other choice.|$|E
25|$|Korea – as {{a platoon}} leader. Recon leader. What {{is the job}} of a recon leader? To recon the front line – no man’s land. And what did we do? I had to assault a {{fortified}} position of the Chinese communists and wiped them out. And what is this Special Forces group that we commanded in the Army – '62–'65? That was the only remaining combat unit in the Philippine Army. The rest were training in a division set-up. We were in Luzon. We were in Sulu. And then, during the previous regime, Marawi incident. Who was sent there? Ramos. We defended the camp, being besieged by 400 rebels. So next time, look at the man’s record, don't just write and write. You said, no combat experience, no combat experience. Look around you who comes from the platoon, who rose to battalion staff, company commander, group commander, which is like a battalion, brigade commander, here and abroad. Abroad, <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> an abroad assignment that was not combat. NO SOFT JOBS FOR RAMOS. Thirty-seven years in the Armed Forces. REMEMBER THAT. You’re only writing about the fringe, but do not allow yourself to destroy the armed forces by those guys. You write about the majority of the Armed Forces who are on the job. That's why we're here enjoying our freedom, ladies and gentlemen. You are here. If the majority of the Armed Forces did not do their job, I doubt very much if you’d all be here.|$|E

500|$|It {{has been}} said that few, if any, First Ladies worked as {{consistently}} before marrying as did Pat Nixon. As she told the writer Gloria Steinem during the 1968 presidential campaign, [...] "I never had time to think about things like that—who I wanted to be, or who I admired, or to have ideas. <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> time to dream about being anyone else. I had to work." ...|$|E
500|$|On January 14, Clark herself {{responded in}} an article titled [...] "Exclusive 'News' – I'm dead to Stephen Colbert". She furthered the rise of [...] "truthiness" [...] in {{published}} English in conceding, [...] "Truthiness be told, <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> seen The Colbert Report until my name graced its 'Dead to Me' board this week... But I will say that I watched Colbert's show for the first time...It was funny. And that's not just truthy. That's a fact." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Love American Style" [...] {{was written}} by Melissa Rosenberg and {{directed}} by Robert Lieberman. The episode was Rosenberg's first for the series and her first on a show written for a premium network. Having had over 10 years' experience in writing for free-to-air commercial networks—which typically have 22–26 episodes per season rather than 12, with a much tighter schedule—she finished writing the script five weeks before it was due for preparation. She said that [...] "There was {{time to think about}} storytelling. <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> that on any show; it's just wonderful." ...|$|E
60|$|As {{a matter}} of fact <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>have.</b> But the {{incident}} remains quite unexplained either by Bickley or Bastin.|$|R

500|$|His {{opinions}} on contemporary cricket were frequently sought. [...] "People {{get a bit}} worried about me," [...] he told Cricinfo in 2008, [...] "Shane Warne's been a fine bowler—no doubt about it, he's done some wonderful things—but Bill O'Reilly and Clarrie Grimmett, who have better strike-rates per match than Warne and never played against a 2nd XI —they only played against the best—had no rough to bowl at. <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> to bat to a leg-spinner who bowled into the rough outside my leg stump, and I played for a long time." ...|$|E
500|$|On July 26, 2011, Beyoncé {{announced}} plans to make an alternative music video for [...] "Best Thing <b>I</b> <b>Never</b> <b>Had</b> [...] ". She asked her fans to send pictures from their weddings or prom day experiences, which would {{be included in a}} re-edited version of the video. This alternate video was scheduled for release in September 2011. However, it premiered on October 11, 2011, on Celebuzz. Charli Penn of Essence magazine praised the alternate video for [...] "Best Thing I Never Had" [...] calling it a [...] "must-see" [...] video and adding that [...] "it has already become a huge hit with fans".|$|E
500|$|As king, Edward VII {{proved a}} greater success {{than anyone had}} expected, {{but he was already}} past the average life {{expectancy}} and had little time left to fulfil the role. In his short reign, he ensured that his second son and heir, George V, was better prepared to take the throne. Contemporaries described their relationship as more like affectionate brothers than father and son, and on Edward's death George wrote in his diary that he had lost his [...] "best friend and the best of fathers... <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> a [...] word with him in my life. I am heart-broken and overwhelmed with grief".|$|E
2500|$|On June 12, 2008, McCain fielded a {{question}} in a town hall meeting, saying, [...] "But I'm not for quote privatizing Social Security, <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> been, <b>I</b> <b>never</b> will be." ...|$|R

500|$|In an {{interview}} with XXL magazine, rapper Fat Joe claimed that he helped produce the track while working with producer Scott Storch. He stated: [...] "I'm pretty sure the world don't know we actually produced Candy Shop together. I produced it with him (Storch) ... Scott called me like 50 times, 100 times: 'Yo, you sure you don't want to use it? 50 Cent called me. 50 Cent want it.' <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> {{a problem with this}} dude. I was like, 'Go ahead.'" [...] When writing the song, 50 Cent stated: [...] "I attempted to be as sexual as possible, from a male perspective, without being vulgar or obscene".|$|E
500|$|After his parents' {{divorce in}} 1960, Spielberg filled the void with an {{imaginary}} alien companion. He {{said that the}} imaginary alien was [...] "a friend who could be the brother <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> and a father that I didn't feel I had anymore". During 1978, he announced he would shoot a film entitled Growing Up, which he would film in 28 days. The project was set aside because of delays on 1941, but the concept of making a small autobiographical film about childhood would stay with him. He also thought about a follow-up to Close Encounters of the Third Kind, and began to develop a darker project he had planned with John Sayles called Night Skies in which malevolent aliens terrorize a family.|$|E
500|$|Several {{actors were}} {{considered}} {{for the role of}} Robert Modell, even Lance Henriksen, who went on to play the lead role in Millennium. Initially, Gilligan considered Harvey Fierstein for the role of Modell, but Robert Wisden read the script and [...] "blew us away". Rob Bowman was pleased with Wisden's performance and said, [...] "I thought Robert Wisden was great as Pusher. He is a very energized kind of confident actor with lots of ideas of his own. It took me about {{a day and a half}} to get him into it, and then <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> to speak to him again, because he had that look in his eyes. I would walk up to talk to him about the scene and I could see that he was already there.|$|E

500|$|In a 2009 {{interview}} for The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Hunt discussed {{working as an}} independent artist, stating [...] "Creatively it is certainly liberating, {{but the rest of}} it is really not that fun. I wanted a happy medium between the system of recording, marketing and distribution which I think is very important to any product you want to bring to market ... but <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> that with the record industry. Now that I'm {{on the other side of}} it trying to be the artist and the industry, I realize what the importance of the system was, but I also realize there was a lot that was missing since it is basically dying now." [...] He also said that he intends on recording another album [...] "at least one more time and then go on tour, and then I don't know." ...|$|E
500|$|She {{attended}} Southport State Primary School {{and experienced}} the personal struggles of a lonely childhood as {{she wanted a}} life similar to her school friends. [...] "Their mums and dads were married. They had brothers and sisters. They had afternoon tea. They had a cooked dinner. <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> that. I'd get {{home from school and}} {{there was nothing in the}} cupboard. I would eat mouldy bread and drink water because that would fill me up". Coulter grew up mostly on her own because her mother worked two jobs to pay the bills. During primary school, Coulter participated in many sports, including swimming, touch football and netball, which she played for six years. When Coulter was nine years old, her mother met John, a man of Scottish descent who is now her step father. Coulter has two half-sisters, Jodie and Emily.|$|E
500|$|Hill was short, {{like all}} her family, and {{indifferent}} to fashion. Her friend Henrietta Barnett wrote: [...] "She was small in stature with long body and short legs. She did not dress, she only wore clothes, which were often unnecessarily unbecoming; she had soft and abundant hair and regular features, but {{the beauty of}} her face lay in brown and very luminous eyes, which quite unconsciously she lifted upwards as she spoke on any matter for which she cared. Her mouth was large and mobile, but not improved by laughter. Indeed, Miss Octavia was nicest when she was made passionate by her earnestness." [...] Barnett also spoke of Hill's streak of ruthlessness. Gertrude Bell called Hill despotic. Later in Hill's life, the Bishop of London, Frederick Temple, encountered her {{at a meeting of}} the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, and wrote, [...] "She spoke for half an hour … <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> such a beating in all my life." ...|$|E
