The FPIs were designed to associate fishery outcomes relating to sustainability, economics and the fishing community to enabling conditions and management approaches. This tool provides helpful insight to policy reform while also being applicable to data poor situations including data-poor fisheries {{such as those in}} developing countries and data-poor sectors such as the post-harvest sector. One hundred twelve fishery systems from around the globe have been assessed. Preliminary results suggest ecologically successful fishery systems tend to be correlated with economic success, indicating that conservation and economic objectives reinforce one another and suggests the potential for <b>healthy</b> <b>fish</b> <b>stocks</b> to support high levels of economic performance if appropriately managed. Access rights and harvest rights contributed positively to ecological and economic success, and to a weaker extent, community success. Analysis on the strength of the rights including measures of transferability, durability, flexibility and exclusivity indicates a positive correlation with ecological and economic success. The exclusivity of harvest rights was incrementally more important than other measures of strength in achieving ecological success. These results provide valuable insight for effective design and reform of rights-based programs. ...|$|R
40|$|Concerns over fishing {{impacts on}} marine populations and {{ecosystems}} have intensified {{the need to}} improve ocean management. One increasingly popular market-based instrument for ecological stewardship is the use of certification and eco-labeling programs to highlight sustainable fisheries with low environmental impacts. The Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) is the most prominent of these programs. Despite widespread discussions about the rigor of the MSC standards, no comprehensive analysis of the performance of MSC-certified <b>fish</b> <b>stocks</b> has yet been conducted. We compared status and abundance trends of 45 certified stocks with those of 179 uncertified stocks, finding that 74 % of certified fisheries were above biomass levels that would produce maximum sustainable yield, compared with only 44 % of uncertified fisheries. On average, the biomass of certified stocks increased by 46 % over the past 10 years, whereas uncertified fisheries increased by just 9 %. As part of the MSC process, fisheries initially go through a confidential pre-assessment process. When certified fisheries are compared with those that decline to pursue full certification after pre-assessment, certified stocks had much lower mean exploitation rates (67 % of the rate producing maximum sustainable yield vs. 92 % for those declining to pursue certification), allowing for more sustainable harvesting and in many cases biomass rebuilding. From a consumer's point of view this means that MSC-certified seafood is 3 - 5 times less likely to be subject to harmful fishing than uncertified seafood. Thus, MSC-certification accurately identifies <b>healthy</b> <b>fish</b> <b>stocks</b> and conveys reliable information on stock status to seafood consumers...|$|R

From 2007 to 2010, boat electrofishing surveys were conducted in the Ebro River downstream of the Xerta Weir to assess the potential pool of species that could use the fishway. Nine native and 12 exotic species were captured, the latter comprising 62 % of the relative abundance and 70 % of the biomass. A combination of video recording, electrofishing and trapping was used to assess the effectiveness of the fishway in facilitating the passage of fish. Eight species were detected using the fishway, of which five were native (Liza ramada, Anguilla anguilla, Barbus graellsii, Gobio lozanoi and Salaria fluviatilis) and three exotic (Alburnus alburnus, Cyprinus carpio and Rutilus rutilus). Only L. ramada used the fishway in substantial numbers. The rate of fish passage was the highest from June to August and decreased afterwards. The effectiveness of the fishway might be lowered by areas of turbulence within the fishway and by distraction flows from a nearby hydropower station.

40|$|<b>Fish</b> <b>stocks</b> in {{the world}} are declining, but the demand for fish {{products}} is increasing. Aquaculture practices are increasing because of this gap between supply and demand. Therefore it is important to determine which production system has the least environmental impact. In this research the sustainability of two sole production systems for the Netherlands is estimated. The sustainability is defined as a combination of four factors: energy requirements, direct and indirect land use, environmental stressors and ecological impact. Several methodologies are used to calculate the impact. The assessment of the indirect land use is based on the Ecological Footprint method. The environmental stressors are calculated based on a Life Cycle Analysis method. The ecological impact is estimated by using a questionnaire from the North Sea Foundation. Three factors are combined in a triangular diagram to visualize the overall environmental impact and to compare the two production systems. For all three factors in the diagram; energy requirements, ecosystem support area (or indirect land use) and ecological impact, the fisheries production system has a higher value. That indicates that for sole the aquaculture production is the more sustainable production system. Both production systems can be improved to reduce their impact on the environment. For fisheries this can be achieved through policy measures. Hereby the fishing intensity will be reduced resulting in a <b>healthier</b> <b>fish</b> <b>stock</b> and less energy needed to catch the same amount of sole. For aquaculture improvements can be achieved by making adaptations in the production system where the most important one is achieving a more efficient water circulation system to reduce the energy requirements. Although the methodologies being used in this research are not completely sufficiently adequate on their own, in combination they are proper tools to give an overview of different aspects of the sustainability of the two production systems. ...|$|R

These species are particularly threatened by barriers such as weirs, dams and sluices, built for water management, hydropower and land drainage. Water and nature managers in Europe have been improving the situation with fish passes and by-pass channels around barriers, to help fish on their journey. An essential aspect of working on fish passage issues is raising awareness and creating commitment within communities in the different river basins. By creating commitment on {{all levels of the}} communities and stakeholders measures can be carried out more efficiently and financial opportunity can be maximised. The Fish Migration Day is a new concept to achieve greater understanding and community involvement (including children and parents). The first Fish Migration Day was held on the 14 th of May 2011.

However, the combination of these objectives makes the implementation of policies one of the main challenges in fisheries management. To prevent overfishing, different measures have been applied that limit catch and/or fleet capacity. Yet, the same management systems and economic behavior of fishermen may lead to an increase in investments in the fleet capacity, causing overcapacity. Decisions of policy makers and fishermen are made under uncertainty, such as uncertainty about <b>fish</b> <b>stock</b> dynamics and/or <b>fish</b> prices, and this can affect optimal management, investment decisions, <b>healthy</b> and productive <b>fish</b> <b>stocks</b> and resource rents.

After acclimation at a low density (LD) of 6 kg m 3 in 200 -L circular tanks containing 332 ̆ 01336 g L 1 recirculating seawater at 1920 C under a normal photoperiod, juvenile 37 -g gilthead sea bream were confined for 14 days at a HD of 26 kg m 3 and then subjected to 30 -s aerial emersion in a dipnet. Plasma levels of cortisol, glucose, lactate, osmolality and chloride were determined in fish held in separate lots during LD (control) and HD confinement at 0, 1, 2, 7 and 14 days, and then after handling at 0, 1, 2, 4 and 8 h. Although plasma cortisol levels were similar in LD and HD fish groups after 14 d of confinement (15 and 23 ng mL 1, respectively), the cortisol response in fish from the HD treatment at 1 and 2 h following acute handling (70 and 37 ng mL 1, respectively) was only about half of that measured in the control group (139 and 102 ng mL 1); plasma cortisol was similar in both groups by 4 and 8 h. In contrast, plasma glucose elevations in response to handling were higher at 4 and 8 h in the HD-held fish (94 and 72 mg dL 1, respectively) than in those from the LD treatment (59 and 51 mg dL 1); glucose responses were similar in both groups at 1 and 2 h after handling and throughout confinement. Plasma lactate levels were higher in LD fish than in the HD group {{at the beginning of the}} experiment but were similar after 14 d confinement and responses to handling were similar (e. g. 33 and 35 mg dL 1 at 1 h). Plasma osmolality showed increases during the first 2 h after acute handling but no differences were evident between the two density treatments at any time during confinement or posthandling. Plasma chloride levels did not change throughout the experiment. The reduced plasma cortisol response to acute handling likely resulted from negative feedback of mildly but chronically elevated circulating cortisol caused by the confinement stressor on the hypothalamic 2 ̆ 013 pituitary 2 ̆ 013 interrenal axis. While other post-handling physiological changes also showed differences between treatment groups, the suppressed cortisol response in the HD-held fish suggests a reduction in the gilthead sea bream's normal capacity to respond to an acute stressor.

40|$|Exactly 150 years ago, Charles Darwin {{described}} {{natural selection}} as the motor {{of the evolution}} of life. Nevertheless, it is not yet clear how important natural selection is for the evolution of marine organisms. The genetic adaptation to local environmental conditions as a result of natural selection, a process known as local adaptation, will be reduced by the migration of organisms due to its homogeneous character. Because of the huge potential for migration in the ‘open’ sea, for a long time biologists declared that local adaptation is rare and even absent. Nevertheless, current research shows that the sea is not as ‘open’ as it may seem. Many marine organisms are able to occupy a permanent place and hence occur in distinct populations. Since migration seems limited, the possibility of local adaptation in marine species presents an important research question. The most recent studies showed that natural selection might be an important evolutionary force in the ocean, however without any good scientific evidence. The present thesis has the ambition to prove that marine species may indeed be genetically adapted to local conditions. A promising opportunity is the possibility for local adaptation to the light regime of the sea. The light that organisms perceive varies between seas due to the differences in turbidity and the colour of the water. The importance of sight for marine animals is obvious, especially to find food and mates, and to avoid predators. Therefore, the aim of the thesis was to study local adaptation at the rhodopsin gene - the gene of the visual pigment that determines the visual capacity in dim-light - of a marine goby, the sand goby (Pomatoschistus minutus). The sand goby is a small and abundant fish species that lives along the European coasts. The results showed strong evidence that sand goby populations are genetically adapted to their specific and local light environment. They are adapted to high turbidity in the Baltic Sea and the Mediterranean lagoons, and to the more blue light of the Bay of Biscay and along the coasts of Spain and Portugal. Moreover, the sand gobies of the North Sea reveal a strategy of adaptation to the unstable local light conditions. In the current state of science, the rhodopsin gene provides one of the strongest indications that local adaptation occurs in the marine environment. Therefore, they encourage analogous studies to find further evidence for l ocal adaptation to other marine environmental conditions such as salinity tolerance and temperature. Such studies will clarify the importance of natural selection as evolutionary force for marine life. To conclude, this study reveals that the sand goby is evolutionary adapted to its light environment. There are strong indications that if the light environment changes due to either pollution or climate change, marine fishes won’t likely be able to adapt rapidly to the new circumstances. Good management of the light conditions of the marine ecosystem will be essential to support a balanced ecosystem and <b>healthy</b> <b>fish</b> <b>stocks...</b>|$|R

Although the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) is the main policy instrument managing <b>fish</b> <b>stocks</b> in Europe, there is continued concern as to whether commercial <b>fish</b> <b>stocks</b> will achieve Good Environmental Status (GEnS) in 2020 {{in accordance with the}} Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD). In this context, the evaluation of the status of <b>fish</b> <b>stocks</b> in the subareas of FAO fishing area 27 was carried out using mean trophic levels (MTL) in fish landings and spawning stock biomass (SSB). Comparisons were made before and after 2008 to establish whether the trend is positive or negative. The main data sources for landings and SSB were the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) advisory reports. MTLs in landing and SSB were determined for each subarea and the subareas were categorized into four groups, according to MTLs after 2008. The first group (subareas I + II, V) had higher MTL in landings and higher MTL in SSB after 2008. Therefore, fisheries in these subareas appear sustainable. The second group was subareas VIII + IX, for which the <b>fish</b> <b>stocks</b> have higher MTL in landings but low MTL in SSB, indicating that SSB was being overfished. The third was subarea (VI), where <b>fish</b> <b>stocks</b> have lower MTL in landings than those in SSB after 2008, which may indicate that <b>fish</b> <b>stocks</b> are recovering. <b>Fish</b> <b>stocks</b> in the fourth group (subareas III, IV and VII) had low MTL in landings and the MTL in SSB was lower than that of landings before 2008.
