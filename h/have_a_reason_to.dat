The club remained at its original location until it was raided by Prohibition agents in 1931. After the raid, it moved to East 51st Street.

5|$|By the mid-1970s, Ike Turner's {{excessive}} cocaine habit {{had gotten}} out of hand. During this period, Tina adopted the Nichiren Buddhism faith and chanting Nam Myoho Renge Kyo to help her deal with a stressful marriage and career. Due to Ike Turner's drug abuse, some shows were either canceled or postponed. In July 1976, Ike Turner had plans to leave United Artists Records for a five-year, $150,000 deal with Cream Records. The deal was to be signed on July 6. On July 1, 1976, Ike and Tina were en route from Los Angeles to Dallas where the Revue had a gig at the Dallas Statler Hilton. Ike and Tina got into a fight during their ride to the hotel. Shortly after arriving to the hotel, Tina fled from the hotel and later hid at a friend's house. On July 27, Tina sued for divorce on the grounds of irreconcilable differences.Ike claims in his book that Tina initiated the fight by purposely irritating him so that she'd <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> break up with him before they were scheduled to sign a new 5-year contract upon their return from Dallas.|$|E

At 18 pages of stage directions, the script contained every joke in the episode, an exercise in planning atypical for Shearsmith and Pemberton. The story contains multiple [...] "reveals"; Pemberton explained that he and Shearsmith [...] "hope there's an 'oh my God' moment. There is always a desire to wrong-foot the viewer.

2500|$|The time {{difference}} {{is also a}} problem facing traditional advertisers. When social events occur and are broadcast on television, {{there is often a}} time delay between airings on the east coast and west coast of the United States. Social networking sites have become a hub of comment and interaction concerning the event. This allows individuals watching the event on the west coast (time-delayed) to know the outcome before it airs. The 2011 Grammy Awards highlighted this problem. Viewers on the west coast learned who won different awards based on comments made on social networking sites by individuals watching live on the east coast.
