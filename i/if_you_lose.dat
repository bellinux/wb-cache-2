The funds or remaining travel is non-transferable to a new student Oyster photocard and is refundable instead. The refund of a lost or stolen Oyster card {{is based on the}} original pro-rata daily rate. Thus, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>lose</b> an annual student Oyster, the refund will not cover the remainder of the year, owing to the higher monthly/weekly pro-rata charges {{for the remainder of the}} year. This can leave students at a considerable disadvantage (adults can receive a replacement card with the remainder of their Travelcard loaded).|$|E
500|$|He {{was exposed}} to {{traditional}} flamenco music as a child while vacationing each summer in his parents' native Andalusia in southern Spain. Originally, Sanz intended to become a flamenco performer, but he found the music teachers to be overly strict. Commenting on his early experiences, Sanz explained, [...] "Flamenco can be very hard on beginners. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>lose</b> the rhythm, they toss you out with, 'You're no good, boy!' They're very strict and very cruel. But it's also a marvelous education, because you either learn to play or else." [...] He felt {{that he could not}} compete with his peers, and decided to focus on creating pop music with flamenco influences, viewing flamenco to be a [...] "lifestyle" [...] better suited to others.|$|E

500|$|Although Chamberlain {{racked up}} some of the most {{impressive}} statistics in the history of Northern American professional sports, because he won [...] "just" [...] two NBA championships and lost seven out of eight playoff series against the Celtics teams of his on-court nemesis Bill Russell, Chamberlain was often called [...] "selfish" [...] and a [...] "loser". Frank Deford of ESPN said that Chamberlain was caught in a no-win situation: [...] "If you win, everybody says, 'Well, look at him, he's that big.' <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>lose,</b> everybody says, 'How could he lose, a guy that size?' [...] " [...] Chamberlain himself often said: [...] "Nobody roots for Goliath." [...] Like later superstar Shaquille O'Neal, Chamberlain was a target of criticism because of his poor free throw shooting, an abysmal [...]511 career average, with a low of [...]380 over the 1967–68 season. Countless suggestions were offered; he shot them underhanded, one-handed, two-handed, {{from the side of the}} circle, from well behind the line, and even banked in. Sixers coach Alex Hannum once suggested he shoot his famous fadeaway jumper as a free throw, but Chamberlain feared drawing more attention to his one great failing. [...] Despite his foul line woes, Chamberlain set the NBA record (28) for free throws made in a regular season game in his 1962 100-point game.|$|E
500|$|On {{choosing}} {{his lead}} single, Drake told Rap-Up, [...] "It’s gotta {{be a real}} great song. It’s gotta be something that I feel is timeless and is better than anything that I’ve ever done." [...] Drake exclusively revealed to Rap-Up on February 15, 2010 that [...] "Over" [...] would be the lead single from his debut album, Thank Me Later, and would be produced by Boi-1da, producer of his previous singles [...] "Best I Ever Had" [...] and [...] "Forever". Drake chose to premiere the song on his hometown Toronto's radio station Flow 93.5. In an interview session with the station, Drake said, [...] "I went with 'Over' as the first look because of {{the words in the}} hook," [...] he said. [...] "The hook being the most repetitive part. I got a lot of great songs on my album. I got songs for women who wanna feel special. I got songs for dudes — if you ever thought my music was too soft, this is one you will enjoy. I got a lot of variety on there, but the biggest thing was that opening line on the hook: 'I know way too many people here right now that I didn't know last year'." [...] He went on to explain that the record sums up where he is in his career right now, and called it a [...] "great first impression". Drake did a lot of work for the song and also the album in Jamaica, during which he called the [...] "calm before the storm", and called [...] "Over" [...] the storm. He said, [...] "It's the moment. I wanted to emerge at first from this album and just let people know 'This is how I'm coming out in the public eye. I'm ready for anything." [...] He then went to explain that after the album people will be like [...] "he's still human" [...] or [...] "he's still thinking the same way", and said he wanted people to [...] "understand I could have lost it. He said, [...] "'Over' could have been my entire album. Just 'cause that's what this industry and game will do to you <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>lose</b> yourself." [...] Drake later said that the song was a [...] "warm-up record". He went on to say, [...] "I love the song. I love the message in the song. It's funny, because 'Over' is the fourth song on the album and it's the turning point in the album. It's like, you get three songs of me sort of trying to paint the picture of what the last year has been like for me — trying to fill you in, almost let you into my world as much as I can. 'Over' is that moment where you're almost worried on the album. 'Is this kid about to ... ? What's happening? Is he changing?' I wanted that to come out first. I wanted people to be a little nervous. This whole journey could have changed me drastically. Fortunately I'm able to step out of my shoes and reflect on it and give you some great music. 'Over' is a great alter-ego moment. It's the dark side of things and I really wanted that to come out first." ...|$|E

2500|$|He {{points out}} that if a wager was between the equal chance of gaining two lifetimes of {{happiness}} and gaining nothing, then a person would be a fool to bet on the latter. The same would go if it was three lifetimes of happiness versus nothing. He then argues that it is simply unconscionable by comparison to bet against an eternal life of happiness {{for the possibility of}} gaining nothing. The wise decision is to wager that God exists, since [...] "If you gain, you gain all; <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>lose,</b> you lose nothing", meaning one can gain eternal life if God exists, but if not, one will be no worse off in death than if one had not believed. On the other hand, if you bet against God, win or lose, you either gain nothing or lose everything. You are either unavoidably annihilated (in which case, nothing matters one way or the other) or lose the opportunity of eternal happiness. In note 194, speaking about those who live apathetically betting against God, he sums up by remarking, [...] "It is to the glory of religion to have for enemies men so unreasonable..." ...|$|E
