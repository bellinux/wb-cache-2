2500|$|The Mishnah {{taught that}} when the priest had {{finished}} the sprinkling, <b>he</b> <b>wiped</b> <b>his</b> hand {{on the body of}} the cow, climbed down, and kindled the fire with wood chips. But Rabbi Akiva said that he kindled the fire with dry branches of palm trees. When the cow's carcass burst in the fire, the priest took up a position outside the pit, took hold of the cedar wood, hyssop, and scarlet wool, and said to the observers: [...] "Is this cedar wood? Is this hyssop? Is this scarlet wool?" [...] He repeated each question three times, and the observers answered [...] "Yes" [...] three times to each question. The priest then wrapped the cedar wood, hyssop, and scarlet wool together with the ends of the wool and cast them into the burning pyre. When the fire burned out, they beat the ashes with rods and then sifted them with sieves. They then divided the ashes into three parts: One part was deposited on the rampart, one on the Mount of Olives, and one was divided among the courses of priests who performed the Temple services in turn.|$|E

6000|$|... "Heresy," [...] said <b>he,</b> <b>wiping</b> <b>his</b> mouth, [...] "may be endured in the {{vigorous}} and lusty; {{but in a}} person lying at the very point of death such hardihood is intolerable." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'God bless my soul!' said <b>he,</b> <b>wiping</b> <b>his</b> brow {{with a huge}} {{coloured}} handkerchief {{as big as a}} mainsail, 'one {{night in}} such a furnace as that would have brought on the gout.' ...|$|R
60|$|Judkins {{paused in}} his narrative, {{breathing}} heavily while <b>he</b> <b>wiped</b> <b>his</b> perspiring brow.|$|E

50|$|Sun Wukong then defies Hell's {{attempt to}} collect his soul. Instead of reincarnating, <b>he</b> <b>wipes</b> <b>his</b> name out of the Book of Life and Death along {{with the names of}} all monkeys known to him. The Dragon Kings and the Kings of Hell report him to the Jade Emperor.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, {{you better}} hear me first," [...] said Davis. [...] "Hear me and {{understand}} me. We've got {{no use for}} that fellow, whatever you may have.

6000|$|PAUL. Brooding on the {{universe}} as usual? I envy you your philosophic detachment. Personally, I find {{that the world is}} very much too much with us, and the devil too; (he looks at the cheque in his hand) and above all the flesh. My god, the flesh.... (<b>He</b> <b>wipes</b> <b>his</b> neck again.) ...|$|R
60|$|He {{reached a}} pit, midway between the {{waterfall}} and the engine-house. There <b>he</b> stopped, <b>wiped</b> <b>his</b> face, and listened.|$|R

50|$|In some {{instances}} the tears are implied by a hand gesture rather than actually shown. This is again influenced by Rogier's Descent, but originates from Campin's Entombment, where a figure is implied to be crying {{by the fact}} that <b>he</b> <b>wipes</b> <b>his</b> face {{with the back of his}} hand, a technique Rogier borrowed and perfected some 20 years later.|$|R

5000|$|The {{demonstration}} of Orpheus's power {{depends on the}} normal obduracy of Pluto; the Augustan poet Horace describes him as incapable of tears. Claudian, however, portrays the steely god as succumbing to Orpheus's song so that [...] "with iron cloak <b>he</b> <b>wipes</b> <b>his</b> tears" [...] (ferrugineo lacrimas deterget amictu), an image renewed by Milton in Il Penseroso (106-107): [...] "Such notes ... / Drew iron tears down Pluto's cheek." ...|$|R
5000|$|Her husband {{finally comes}} to [...] "Baba Yaga". She gives him food and lets him rest; then she brings him water to wash. <b>He</b> <b>wipes</b> <b>his</b> face not with their towel but his handkerchief. She recognizes {{it as their}} sister's. She {{questions}} him, and he tells his story. The old witch, who {{had never heard of}} something like that, knows an old frog who she thinks may know something.|$|R
5000|$|He once proclaimed, [...] "Hey, belly jeans"When {{he found}} a stash of jelly beans.But {{when he says he}} pepped in stewWe'll tell him <b>he</b> should <b>wipe</b> <b>his</b> shoe.|$|R
6000|$|... "None, Sahib. I {{watched his}} hands. They did not shake. Afterward <b>he</b> <b>wiped</b> <b>his</b> face, {{but he was}} {{sweating}} before from the heat." ...|$|E
60|$|Then <b>he</b> <b>wiped</b> <b>his</b> {{eyes again}} with the lace {{handkerchief}} and, suddenly remembering his dinner, seized his knife and fork and began eating.|$|E

5000|$|As he {{is about}} to leave the hospital, Wilbur gets a nurse named Moira, {{infatuated}} with him, to lick his ear.

At the same time, a few doors along, Harbour is told by a doctor that he needs to stay in the hospital for some tests. Harbour refuses because he wants to be at home with his new family.|$|R
6000|$|Ibid. Burnet, {{upon the}} {{examination}} of Mitchell before the privy-council for the intended assassination of Archbishop Sharp, it being first proposed {{to cut off the}} prisoner's right hand, and then his left:--Lord Rothes, who was a pleasant man, said, [...] "How shall <b>he</b> <b>wipe</b> <b>his</b> breech then?" [...] This is not very decent to be mentioned in such a work, if it were not necessary.--Swift. As decent as a thousand other passages; so he might have spared his apology.|$|R
