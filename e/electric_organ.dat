5|$|Bueno's {{band was}} a typical cuarteto band, {{composed}} of fourteen musicians. Percussion predominated, with a main drummer and additional timbales, complemented by an accordion and an <b>electric</b> <b>organ.</b> The vocal part of the band featured a male quartet as a chorus.|$|E
5|$|The Hammond organ is an <b>electric</b> <b>organ,</b> {{invented by}} Laurens Hammond and John M. Hanert and first {{manufactured}} in 1935. Various {{models have been}} produced, most of which use sliding drawbars to create a variety of sounds. Until 1975, Hammond organs generated sound by creating an electric current from rotating a metal tonewheel near an electromagnetic pickup, and then strengthening the signal with an amplifier so it can drive a speaker cabinet. Around two million Hammond organs have been manufactured. The organ is commonly used with, and associated with, the Leslie speaker.|$|E
5|$|There was major {{restoration}} {{work done}} to the church in 1886, and {{a large amount of}} the Chancel woodwork dates from this period. During the restoration the east window was also replaced; it now depicts the stylised form of Saint Oswald, flanked on either side by Saint Aidan, and Saint Cuthbert, both Christian saints of the same era, and who helped him in missionary work in the Kingdom of Northumbria. These windows are directly opposite the western window, above the font {{at the other end of}} the church, which depicts the queen at the time, Queen Victoria. Further modern additions to the church can be seen in the bell turret and organ chamber, as well as the south porch, which is currently the sole congregational entrance to the church. The church uses an <b>electric</b> <b>organ</b> during services.|$|E
50|$|In most fishes, <b>electric</b> <b>organs</b> are {{oriented}} to fire {{along the length}} of the body, usually lying {{along the length of}} the tail and within the fish's musculature, with smaller accessory <b>electric</b> <b>organs</b> in the head. However, there are some exceptions; in stargazers and in rays the <b>electric</b> <b>organs</b> are oriented along the dorso-ventral (up-down) axis. In the electric torpedo ray, the organ is near the pectoral muscles and the gills (see the image). The stargazer's <b>electric</b> <b>organs</b> lie between the mouth and the eye. In the <b>electric</b> catfish, the <b>organs</b> are located just below the skin and encase most of the body like a sheath.|$|R

25|$|Discharge of an <b>electric</b> <b>organ</b> {{begins with}} central command from a {{medullary}} pacemaker that determines {{the frequency and}} rhythm of EODs. These two characteristics (frequency and rhythm) of EODs are {{also referred to as}} SPI- sequence of pulse intervals. The command from medullary pacemaker is then passed on by spinal electromotor neurons to electrocytes forming the <b>electric</b> <b>organ,</b> which determine the waveform of the EODs based on its morphophysiological properties. As command from pacemaker reaches <b>electric</b> <b>organ,</b> it opens up all the sodium channels, causing net sodium ion flux in one direction. The direction will either be towards or away from the head, and brings simultaneous depolarization of all electroycytes {{on the same side of}} cell. The result is a positive polarity at the fish's head relative to the tail, or vice versa: a dipole system. The polarity built up by the <b>electric</b> <b>organ</b> therefore sets up an electrostatic field in the water.|$|E

25|$|Electric fishes {{communicate}} with electric signals that possess two main qualities - frequency and waveform. The information in waveform {{is embedded in}} the <b>electric</b> <b>organ</b> discharge (EOD) itself, which is determined and fixed by the anatomy and physiology of the <b>electric</b> <b>organ.</b> EOD waveform, in some species, changes with developmental stages. Frequency of EODs and interval duration between them are called sequence of pulse intervals (SPI), which are controlled by the command interneurons in the midbrain and medulla, as stated under electric organs. Alteration in SPI produces widely varying social signals among electric fish during mating, warning, or identifying. These two properties (waveform/EOD and frequency/SPI) are used by both wave and pulse type fishes for recognition and communication.|$|E

25|$|Electric fishes {{generate}} {{discharge from}} electric organs {{located near the}} tail region. Electric organs are mostly derived from muscle cells (myogenic); except for one gymnotiform family has <b>electric</b> <b>organ</b> derived from neurons (neurogenic organs). To detect the electric signals, electric fish has two types of receptive cells- ampullary and tuberous electroreceptors.|$|E
25|$|In gymnotiforms, electrocytes differ between wave-type and pulse-type {{electric}} fishes. In wave-type fishes, electrocytes {{are in a}} tubular form. In pulse {{fish the}} electrocytes tend to be flattened disks. The electocytes also form columns, but unlike the shorter size of <b>electric</b> <b>organ</b> in mormyrids, gymnotiforms have long electric organs that extend throughout almost the entire longitudinal body length. Also different from the stalk system in mormyrids, stalks in gymnotiforms only make one type of innervation at the posterior side of electrocyte. Pulse-type gymnotifoms generally show a higher complexity than the wave-type fishes. For instance, their electrocytes can be either cylindrical or drum-shaped with stalks innervating from either posterior or anterior side. Another important difference is that, unlike mormyrids or wave-type gymnotiforms, electrocytes of pulse-type gymnotiforms are not homogenous along the long <b>electric</b> <b>organ</b> that traverses the fish body. Different parts of the electric organs of some gymnotoiforms are innervated differently or may have different cellular firing properties.|$|E
25|$|The {{electric}} eel {{has three}} pairs of abdominal organs that produce electricity: the main organ, the Hunter's organ, and the Sach's organ. These organs make up four-fifths of its body, and give the electric eel the ability to generate two types of <b>electric</b> <b>organ</b> discharges: low voltage and high voltage. These organs are made of electrocytes, lined up so a current of ions can flow through them and stacked so each one adds to a potential difference.|$|E

25|$|The first {{expansion}} {{would come}} the following year. Construction {{of the line}} to Ugla had started, and was opened on 30 May 1925. To create additional traffic, two of the board members established their own company to build a tavern at Ugla. The rebuilding of the Ugla Farm included a small zoo with various aquatic birds and a hare. Part of the tavern was rebuilt to become a concert hall, and an <b>electric</b> <b>organ</b> was installed. Graakalbanen gave support to the tavern per sold ticket, and up to 5,000 people would travel to the tavern on sunny summer weekends.|$|E
25|$|Then, {{their effort}} {{was focused on}} the {{improvement}} of reliability and performance, along with the size reduction and the cost down. Unstable vacuum tube circuit was replaced with reliable transistor circuit on Donca-Matic DC-11 in mid-1960s, and in 1966, bulky mechanical-wheel was also replaced with compact transistor circuit on Donca-Matic DE-20 and DE-11. In 1967, Mini Pops MP-2 was developed as an option of Yamaha Electone (<b>electric</b> <b>organ),</b> and Mini Pops was established as a series of the compact desktop rhythm machine. In the United States, Mini Pops MP-3, MP-7, etc. were sold under Univox brand by the distributor at that time, Unicord Corporation.|$|E
25|$|Eventually tango transcended its Latin boundaries, as European bands adopted it {{into their}} dance repertoires. Non-traditional {{instruments}} were often added, such as accordion (in place of bandoneon), saxophone, clarinet, ukulele, mandolin, <b>electric</b> <b>organ,</b> etc, as well as lyrics in non-Spanish languages. European tango became a mainstream world-wide dance and popular music style, alongside with foxtrot, slow waltz, and rumba. It somewhat diverged from its Argentinian origin and developed characteristic European styles. Famous European band leaders who adopted tango included, to name a few, , Marek Weber, Oskar Joost, , Jose Lucchesi, , , Paul Godwin, Alexander Tsfasman, as well as famous singers Leo Monosson, Zarah Leander, Rudi Schuricke, Tino Rossi, , Mieczys≈Çaw Fogg, Pyotr Leshchenko, and others.

25|$|For the myogoenic fishes, {{this change}} in signal {{waveform}} occurs with the initial larval electrocytes fusing together forming new electrocytes with different shapes, along with redistribution of ion-gated channels, formation of new extracellular structures on the electrocytes, etc. Some pulse fishes also develop accessory electric organs located on {{other parts of the}} body; these extra electric organs further play a role in adding phases to the EODs. For the only neurogenic fish known so far, apteronotids, EOD changes during the developmental process seemed to be more dramatic than that of the myogenic fishes, which might indicate that neurogenic electrocytes are more easily prone to modifications. Similar with the myogenic fishes, apteronotids has its <b>electric</b> <b>organ</b> formed by myocytes. As apteronotids matures, new neurogenic electrocytes derived from spinal motoneurons replace the myogenic electrocytes.|$|E
25|$|Their {{first three}} albums were free-form {{experimental}} rock without the pop hooks {{or the more}} disciplined song structure of later work. Kraftwerk, released in 1970, and Kraftwerk 2, released in 1972, were mostly exploratory musical improvisations played {{on a variety of}} traditional instruments including guitar, bass, drums, organ, flute, and violin. Post-production modifications to these recordings were used to distort the sound of the instruments, particularly audio-tape manipulation and multiple dubbings of one instrument on the same track. Both albums are purely instrumental. Live performances from 1972 to 1973 were made as a duo, using a simple beat-box-type electronic drum machine, with preset rhythms taken from an <b>electric</b> <b>organ.</b> These shows were mainly in Germany, with occasional shows in France. Later in 1973, Wolfgang Fl√ºr joined the group for rehearsals, and the unit performed as a trio on the television show Aspekte for German television network ZDF.|$|E
25|$|The music {{score was}} {{composed}} by Bernard Herrmann in August 1951, and {{was his first}} score after he moved from New York to Hollywood. Herrmann chose unusual instrumentation for the film: violin, cello, and bass (all three electric), two theremin electronic instruments (played by Dr. Samuel Hoffman and Paul Shure), two Hammond organs, a large studio <b>electric</b> <b>organ,</b> three vibraphones, two glockenspiels, marimba, tam-tam, two bass drums, three sets of timpani, two pianos, celesta, two harps, one horn, three trumpets, three trombones, and four tubas. Herrmann's notable advances in film scoring included Unison organs, tubas, piano, and bass drum, staggered tritone movement, and glissando in theremins, as well as exploitation of the dissonance between D and E-flat and experimentation with unusual overdubbing and tape-reversal techniques. By using the theremin Herrmann made one of music's first forays into electronic music, one year before Karlheinz Stockhausen and three years before Edgard Var√®se, something that was overlooked by the classical elite.|$|E

25|$|The {{missing link}} was the {{demonstration}} that the neurotransmitter acetylcholine is actually contained in synaptic vesicles. About ten years later, {{the application of}} subcellular fractionation techniques to brain tissue permitted the isolation first of nerve endings (synaptosomes), and subsequently of synaptic vesicles from mammalian brain. Two competing laboratories were involved in this work, that of Victor P. Whittaker at the Institute of Animal Physiology, Agricultural Research Council, Babraham, Cambridge, UK and that of Eduardo de Robertis at the Instituto de Anatom√≠a General y Embriolog√≠a, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de Buenos Aires, Argentina. Whittaker's work demonstrating acetylcholine in vesicle fractions from guinea-pig brain {{was first published in}} abstract form in 1960 and then in more detail in 1963 and 1964, and the paper of the de Robertis group demonstrating an enrichment of bound acetylcholine in synaptic vesicle fractions from rat brain appeared in 1963. Both groups released synaptic vesicles from isolated synaptosomes by osmotic shock. The content of acetylcholine in a vesicle was originally estimated to be 1000‚Äì2000 molecules. Subsequent work identified the vesicular localization of other neurotransmitters, such as amino acids, catecholamines, serotonin, and ATP. Later, synaptic vesicles could also be isolated from other tissues such as the superior cervical ganglion, or the octopus brain. The isolation of highly purified fractions of cholinergic synaptic vesicles from the ray Torpedo <b>electric</b> <b>organ</b> was an important step forward in the study of vesicle biochemistry and function.|$|E

500|$|Like {{other members}} of its family, the marbled {{electric}} ray can produce a strong electric shock for attack and defense, produced {{by a pair of}} electric organs derived from muscle tissue.
