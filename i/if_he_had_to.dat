5|$|Through March and April {{the divers}} and ships' crews worked to recover {{all manner of}} treasure: silver coins, silver bullion, doubloons, jewelry, {{a small amount of}} gold, and other artifacts. Concerned about the {{possibility}} of mutiny, Phips guaranteed to the crew, who had been hired for seaman's wages, that they would receive shares in the find, even <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> pay them from his own percentage.

5|$|When questioned, Patrick Darby {{testified that}} in 1824, Beauchamp had {{solicited}} his services {{in order to}} bring suit against Sharp for unspecified charges. During their ensuing conversations, Beauchamp had related the story of Sharp's abandonment of Anna Cooke and her child, swearing that he would kill him one day, even <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> come to Frankfort and shoot him down in the street. The combined testimonies of Eliza Sharp and Patrick Darby were sufficient to persuade the city magistrates to hold Beauchamp for trial during the circuit court's next term, which began in March 1826.|$|E

5|$|Although {{pleased with}} {{the result of the}} engagement, Lord Keith issued strict {{instructions}} that Nelson was to remain in active command of the blockade and on no account to return to Palermo. <b>If</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> go to port in Sicily, then he was to use Syracuse instead. Keith then sailed to Livorno, where his flagship was destroyed in a sudden fire that killed over 700 of the crew, although Keith himself was not on board at the time. By early March, Nelson had tired of the blockade and in defiance of Keith's instructions returned to Palermo again, leaving Captain Thomas Troubridge of HMS Culloden in command of the blockade squadron. In March, while Nelson was absent at Palermo, the ship of the line Guillaume Tell, the last survivor of the Nile, attempted to break out of Malta but was chased down and defeated by a British squadron led by Berry in Foudroyant. Although Nelson briefly returned in April, both of the Hamiltons were aboard his ship and most of his time was spent at Marsa Sirocco in the company of Emma, with whom he was now romantically attached.|$|E

25|$|In late 1938, {{during the}} great crisis in Europe over Czechoslovakia that culminated in the Munich Agreement, Canadians were divided. Francophones insisted on neutrality, as did some top {{advisers}} like Oscar D. Skelton. Imperialists stood behind Britain and were willing to fight Germany. King, who served as his own {{secretary of state for}} external affairs (foreign minister), said privately that <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> choose he would not be neutral, but he made no public statement.

25|$|Pemberton was {{promoted}} to major general on January 14, 1862, and given command the Confederate Department of South Carolina and Georgia, an assignment lasting from March 14 to August 29, with his headquarters in Charleston. As a result of Pemberton's abrasive personality, his public statement that <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> make the choice he would abandon the area rather than risk {{the loss of his}} outnumbered army, and the distrust of his Northern birth, the governors of both states in his Department petitioned Confederate President Jefferson Davis for his removal. Davis needed a commander for a new department in Mississippi and also a command for Gen. P.G.T. Beauregard, so he sent Pemberton west and assigned the more popular Beauregard to Charleston.|$|E
25|$|The {{prototype}} first flew on 30 May 1939 {{powered by}} two Walter Sagitta I-SR air cooled vee piston engines. The trial flights identified {{problems with the}} cooling of the rear engine and general engine performance. It was proposed to use Rolls-Royce or Daimler-Benz engines in the production aircraft. Concerns were also raised about the pilot clearing the rear propeller <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> bail out and an ejector seat was studied. As a provisional solution, rails were put {{on both sides of}} the forward fuselage for the Fokker test pilot, Gerben Sonderman, to use to bail out in an emergency. The aircraft was flown 11 times for a total flight time of less than four hours. The rear fuselage paneling was modified significantly before the last few flights in an attempt to address chronic rear engine cooling problems. On the 11th flight in April, the undercarriage was damaged, and the programme was abandoned in May 1940 when the German forces invaded the Netherlands.|$|E

He wrote, [...] "If the whole world were to ask me to restore General Beauregard to the command which I have already given to General Bragg, I would refuse it."

500|$|At {{approximately}} 11:30 on Wednesday 30 April the six {{heavily armed}} members of DRFLA stormed the Iranian Embassy building on Princes Gate, South Kensington.

500|$|The {{prototype}} {{was completed}} on 27 November 1948 and its first flight was shortly afterwards on 4 December. The best speed that the Il-20 could manage was only [...] {{at an altitude}} of , [...] slower than the Il-10 at the same altitude, possibly a consequence of the increased drag and weight penalties inherent in the greater fuselage cross-section and area {{as a result of the}} placement of the pilot above the engine. The new M-47 engine proved to be defective with severe vibration problems. Other problems were that the Air Force was not satisfied with the armament and that access to the engine for routine maintenance was severely hampered by the placement of the cockpit over the engine. Another concern was the close placement of the cockpit to the propeller; this was believed to increase the risk to the pilot <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> bail out or make a belly landing—in which case the bent propeller blades might hit the canopy.|$|E

500|$|On the track, California Chrome has {{the ability}} to use {{tactical}} speed at nearly any point in a race. Early in his career, he tended to be slow out of the starting gate; <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> wait too long for the start, he sometimes expressed anxiety by rocking from side to side, preventing him from being oriented straight forward when the gate opened. He overcame this problem {{by the end of the}} 2014 season and learned to break quickly. [...] When outside and in the clear, he usually won. He originally did not run well on the inside or in close quarters; two of his worst finishes were in races where he had the number one post position, and his fourth-place performance in the Belmont Stakes was attributed to both his injury at the start and the number two draw. However, as an older horse, he won both a 2016 prep race at Meydan Racecourse and the Pacific Classic from the number one post.|$|E
500|$|The broad {{geographic}} {{outlines of}} European states changed {{rapidly in the}} last fifty years of the century, with partitions of Poland and territorial exchanges through conquest and diplomacy. Rulers sought to centralize their control over their domains and create well-defined borders within which their writ was law. For Joseph, the acquisition of Bavaria, or at least parts of it, would link Habsburg territories in Bohemia with those in the Tyrol [...] and partially compensate Austria for its loss of Silesia. The Bavarian succession crisis provided Joseph with a viable opportunity to consolidate his influence in the Central European states, to bolster his financially strapped government with much-needed revenue, and to strengthen his army with German-speaking conscripts. Supremacy in the German states was worth a war, but for Frederick, the preservation of Charles August's inheritance was not. He had had sufficient war {{in the first years of}} his reign, and in its last twenty years, he sought to preserve the status quo, not to enter into risky adventures that might upset it. <b>If</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> withdraw from engagement with Joseph's army, such a sacrifice was a temporary measure. Warfare was only one means of diplomacy, and he could employ others in this contest with Austria. The Austro-Prussian dualism that dominated the next century's unification movement rumbled ominously in the War of the Bavarian Succession.|$|E

[...] In March, Favre hears Phil Simms say on Sirius Radio that as long as Favre can physically play the game, he should. Shortly thereafter, Favre confirms he would return to play. After the Packers defeated the Chicago Bears the last game of the season 26-7, Favre choked up during {{an interview}} with Andrea Kremer by saying [...] "If today's my last game, I want to remember it.
