5|$|Simultaneously, {{a nearby}} Army {{reconnaissance}} team conducted a failed {{assault on the}} town {{on the basis that}} the audibly nearby Naval forces—which they did not know were then in retreat—would bring support. The outcome left the Union forces with a combined 5 casualties and 21 wounded. Dialogue between officers following the conflict left the Union navy questioning the usefulness of gunboats in joint expedition settings <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> not be capable of supporting themselves.|$|E
5|$|Apparently formidable, the Libyan {{military}} disposition in Chad was {{marred by}} serious flaws. The Libyans were prepared for a war <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> provide ground and air support to their Chadian allies, act as assault infantry, and provide reconnaissance. By 1987, however, Muammar Gaddafi had lost his allies, exposing Libya's inadequate knowledge of the area. Libyan garrisons came to resemble isolated and vulnerable islands in the Chadian Sahara. Also important was the low morale among the troops, who were fighting in a foreign country, and the structural disorganization of the Libyan army, which was in part induced by Gaddafi's fear of a military coup against him. This fear led him to avoid the professionalization of the armed forces.|$|E
5|$|As cup winners, Napoli {{qualified}} for the 2014 Supercoppa Italiana <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> face Serie A champions Juventus. The match had traditionally taken place in August, but Napoli requested it be moved due to their Champions League play-off that month. The fixture was eventually played on 22 December during the league's winter break, at the Jassim Bin Hamad Stadium in Doha, Qatar. It finished 11 after 90 minutes, 22 after extra time, and Napoli won 65 in the penalty shootout.|$|E

50|$|The {{contemporary}} {{fantasy and}} low fantasy genres can overlap as both {{are defined as}} being set {{in the real world}}. There are differences, however. Low fantasies are set in the real world but not necessarily in the modern age, <b>in</b> <b>which</b> case <b>they</b> <b>would</b> not be contemporary fantasy. Contemporary fantasies are set in the real world but may also include distinct fantasy settings within it, such as the Harry Potter series, <b>in</b> <b>which</b> case <b>they</b> <b>would</b> be high rather than low fantasy.|$|R

5|$|Burger King {{introduced}} the Specialty Sandwich line under its Burger King and I promotional campaign {{developed by the}} J. Walter Thompson (JWT) agency. The advertisements featured customers and employees praising the new sandwiches accompanied with {{a brief description of}} the products being sold. Actor Stuart Pankin played a doorman in one commercial in the series. Another one of the promotions used was a scratch card game called What's my Specialty? where the customer would receive a card with their purchase <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> have to match famous people to said person's profession. The commercial explained that if you expected to lose, you would be disappointed, as all cards were winners. Prizes included fries, sodas and sandwiches.|$|E
5|$|Places {{and objects}} named after Albert range from Lake Albert in Africa {{to the city}} of Prince Albert, Saskatchewan, to the Albert Medal {{presented}} by the Royal Society of Arts. Four regiments of the British Army were named after him: 11th (Prince Albert's Own) Hussars; Prince Albert's Light Infantry; Prince Albert's Own Leicestershire Regiment of Yeomanry Cavalry, and The Prince Consort's Own Rifle Brigade. He and Queen Victoria showed a keen interest in the establishment and development of Aldershot in Hampshire as a garrison town in the 1850s. They had a wooden Royal Pavilion built there <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> often stay when attending reviews of the army. Albert established and endowed the Prince Consort's Library at Aldershot, which still exists today.|$|E
5|$|Kenyatta's exact date {{of birth}} is not known, as birth records were not {{traditionally}} kept by the Kikuyu. It is known that he was probably born sometime in the 1890s. The Kikuyu custom {{at the time was}} to divide boys into age groups, <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> be initiated into manhood together. The older members of Kenyatta's age group are believed to have been born around 1890. One biographer, Jules Archer, suggested that his year of birth was likely 1890, although a fuller analysis performed by Jeremy Murray-Brown concluded that he was likely born circa 1897 or 1898. Kenyatta was raised according to traditional Kikuyu custom and religious belief, and was taught the skills needed to herd the family flock. When he was ten years old, his earlobes were pierced to mark his transition away from childhood.|$|E

50|$|The type {{specimen}} of Samrukia {{was at first}} believed to belong to an oviraptorosaurian theropod dinosaur. An initial cladistic analysis by Naish et al. found Samrukia nessovi instead to be a basal member of the bird lineage Ornithuromorpha. They interpreted Samrukia as a very large bird (the jawbone is {{twice as long as}} that of an ostrich), but noted that it is not known whether Samrukia {{would have been able to}} fly (<b>in</b> <b>which</b> case <b>they</b> <b>would</b> have had wingspans of roughly 4 m) or not (<b>in</b> <b>which</b> case <b>they</b> <b>would</b> have been around 2 - 3 m tall).|$|R
5|$|Ryu fights back to {{the inner}} {{chambers}} of the Ancient Ship of Doom, where he prepares {{to engage in the}} final showdown against Clancy, who has now transmuted into a super bio-noid. Clancy offers Ryu to have him and Irene work for him by his side wipe out the human race and usher a new age, but Ryu refuses and commences with the final battle. After transforming twice into progressively-stronger versions of himself, Clancy is defeated by Ryu, and Ryu is transported outside the warship and back to Irene; they both watch as the Ancient Ship of Doom is brought down and explodes, and they witness the crumbling of Castle Rock fortress. In the aftermath, Ryu tells Irene that Clancy's and Foster's plan have been foiled, and that mankind will live on and refuse to be part of anyone's evil plans; he adds that mankind would never stoop to a level <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> completely destroy themselves out of mere ambition. The two watch as the sun rises and as a new day begins.|$|E

Rockies starting pitchers have an Opening Day record of fourwins, twolosses, and one no decision when at home. With {{the exception of one}} lost game at Mile High Stadium, the other games were played at Colorado's current home stadium of Coors Field. On the road for Opening Day, Colorado starting pitchers have accumulated a record of sixwins, fivelosses, and sevenno decisions.
