500|$|Mike Ryan of Uproxx {{gave the}} film a {{positive}} review, writing [...] "Newt Scamander {{is nothing like}} Harry, {{but it has to}} be this way. <b>It</b> <b>all</b> <b>has</b> to be different. And it is, but, again, with just enough 'sameness' to make us feel like we are at home again. I'm looking forward to wherever these movies are taking us". John DeFore of The Hollywood Reporter wrote that the film is [...] "likely to draw in just about everyone who followed the Potter series and to please most of them". New York Magazines David Edelstein deemed the film a [...] "distinctly unmagical slog", remarking that the beasts [...] "aren’t especially fantastic and the effects are too blandly corporate to be exhilarating".|$|E
500|$|While {{reviewing}} the seventeenth season of The Simpsons, Jesse Hassenger of PopMatters {{noted that he}} thought the show had declined in quality compared to its earlier years, and added that the stronger episodes in the later seasons are that ones that [...] "satirize topical issues", giving [...] "The Monkey Suit" [...] as an example. Similarly, Fort Worth Star-Telegram staff writer Robert Philpot commented that [...] "Even in its weak seasons, this show has always been good {{for at least one}} belly laugh per episode. Not this year [...] Aside from an installment that took on the evolution -vs.-creationism edge {{and a couple of other}} bits, the satirical edge has really dulled, making the announcement that it will have at least two more seasons a cause for concern rather than celebration." [...] In the July 26, 2007 issue of Nature, the scientific journal's editorial staff listed among [...] "The Top Ten science moments in The Simpsons" [...] the scene from the episode in which [...] "Flanders is flabbergasted that the science museum's exhibit on the origins of man both highlights evolution and makes light of creationism — and, to top <b>it</b> <b>all,</b> <b>has</b> a unisex bathroom." ...|$|E
2500|$|Cult of Luna albums tend {{to focus}} on a theme; guitarist Erik Olofsson states in an {{interview}} that this release focuses on [...] "Male loneliness – I was very inspired by a book by J.M. Coetzee [...] about a man in South Africa with a hare lip. [...] escapes from everything and lives off the earth eating only pumpkins. Johannes [...] had similar ideas for the lyrics about loneliness, <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>has</b> a kind of countryside vibe to it." ...|$|E

60|$|You've seen <b>it</b> <b>all,</b> <b>have</b> you not, {{over and}} over again, in every degree and modification? No doubt you have, and {{as it is with}} parting {{humanity}} at railway stations, so is it at steamboat wharves.|$|R
6000|$|Jimmy laughed. [...] "Evidently. Still, I don't quite {{see what}} <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>has</b> {{to do with}} me, since I'm not going. Where's the man you had when you took the last party?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Kramer {{looked up}} at the wall speaker. [...] "How {{are you going to get}} the people to leave Terra and come with you, if by your own theory, this {{generation}} can't be saved, <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>has</b> to start with the next?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You see," [...] she continued, drearily, [...] "that <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>has</b> {{very little}} to do with the case. I meant to keep it to myself, because, of course, apart from {{anything}} else, apart from Brian's meeting him coming out of my rooms, it supplies an additional cause for anger on Brian's part." ...|$|E
6000|$|No! he did {{not tell}} her all that; the {{recollection}} of <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>had</b> still the power to make him laugh; was <b>it</b> not <b>all</b> a part and parcel of that great gamble for human lives wherein he had held the winning cards himself for so long? ...|$|R
6000|$|What {{would he}} do? Marguerite {{at the thought}} instinctively pressed {{her hands to her}} heart, the agony of <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>had</b> become {{physically}} painful. She hoped that perhaps this pain meant approaching death! oh! how easy would this simple solution be! ...|$|R
50|$|The {{expenses}} {{limit for}} the campaign (which is enforceable due to <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>having</b> to be authorised by one person) is £100,000 for a parliamentary by-election, but is approximately £5,483 plus either 6.2p or 4.6p for every registered voter in the district.|$|R
6000|$|... "I do not know. <b>It</b> <b>all</b> <b>has</b> come so {{suddenly}} that I scarce believe that {{either of us}} realizes the real terrors of our position. I feel that I should be reduced to panic; but yet I am not. I imagine that the shock has been so great as to partially stun our sensibilities." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I have {{forgotten}} nothing," [...] she declared, defiantly. [...] "Only the horror {{and fear of}} <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>has</b> passed away. I don't see why I should suffer all my life. In fact, I don't mean to. I don't {{want to be a}} miserable, lonely old woman. I want a home, something different from this." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That she didn't even suspect herself," [...] Nanda broke in, [...] "to be? I'm equally {{positive}} now. It's {{quite what}} I believed, only there's ever {{so much more}} of it. More HAS come--and more will yet. You see, when there has been nothing before, <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>has</b> to come with a rush. So that if even I'm surprised of course she is." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>had</b> been as you say, my child," [...] said Pater Bonifácius kindly, [...] "then {{you might}} perhaps {{have been happy}} {{according}} to your own light, whereas now {{you are going to}} be happy in accordance with that of God." ...|$|R

60|$|In {{the garden}} were tiny {{artificial}} streams and little pools of water, flanked by flowering bushes, as though <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>had</b> been {{designed by the}} cunning hand of some master gardener, so faithfully did it carry out the beauties and contours of nature upon a miniature scale.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Heard of it! San Francisco {{is full of}} it. Hamilton Fisker is {{the great}} man of the day there, and, when I left, your uncle was buying a villa for seventy-four {{thousand}} dollars.

6000|$|... "Yes, a foreigner," [...] {{continued}} Lucas volubly, [...] "though <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>has</b> remained very mysterious. The Prince's soldiers {{spoke of}} it amongst themselves ... the foreigner {{had said something}} about a guet-apens, a plot against the Stadtholder's life {{on his way to}} the North ... then one of the officers heard the rumour and carried it to one of his superiors.... By the evening it had reached the Stadtholder's ears." ...|$|E
6000|$|The soul is of itself, [...] All verges to <b>it,</b> <b>all</b> <b>has</b> {{reference}} to what ensues, [...] All {{that a person}} does, says, thinks, is of consequence, [...] Not a move can {{a man or woman}} make, that affects him or her in a day, [...] month, any part of the direct lifetime, or the hour of death, [...] But the same affects him or her onward afterward through the [...] indirect lifetime.|$|E
60|$|The sordidness of <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>had</b> ruthlessly struck her; for {{the first}} time in her {{intercourse}} with this man, she doubted the genuineness of his motives.

5000|$|... "Shake" [...] was the {{original}} lead single from Jesse McCartney's fourth studio album, <b>Have</b> <b>It</b> <b>All.</b> <b>Have</b> <b>It</b> <b>All</b> was, however, postponed {{to a point that}} it was eventually cancelled completely. [...] "Shake" [...] is written by McCartney, Jacob Kasher Hindlin, and written and produced by Joshua Coleman. It was sent to both U.S. mainstream radios and released in digital download format on September 21, 2010.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do I {{not know}} it?" [...] he exclaimed in a low, fierce tone. [...] "Do you think I yielded easily to the {{poisoned}} web you have woven around me? The horror of <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>has</b> darkened my days, and made hideous my nights. And yet you can taunt me with it--you, for whom I yield up conscience and future--you, for whom I give my soul! No other man could love as I love, Adrea!" ...|$|E
60|$|As I peer {{back into}} that crowded little schoolroom, smothering hot and reeking with lamp smoke, and recall the half-lit, {{familiar}} faces of the congregation, <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>has</b> {{the quality of a}} vision, something experienced in another world. The preacher, leaping, sweating, roaring till the windows rattle, the mothers with sleeping babes in their arms, the sweet, strained faces of the girls, the immobile wondering men, are spectral shadows, figures encountered in the phantasmagoria of disordered sleep.|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank goodness!" [...] he cried. [...] "I {{think it}} is your dear eyes that have done it. I could not stand that wistful look in them. What a silly, foolish {{nightmare}} <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>has</b> been! There's an end for ever in my belief in presentiments. Now, dear girl, we have just time for one good turn before luncheon. After that the gardens get so crowded that it is hopeless to do anything. Shall we have a side show, or the great wheel, or the flying boat, or what?" ...|$|E

50|$|The debut Creation's Tears album Methods To End <b>It</b> <b>All</b> <b>had</b> {{initially}} been touted for a Spring 2010 release but {{following the}} band's vocalist, Reynolds contracting serious food poisoning during the recording sessions in Stockholm, the release was subsequently postponed. Reynolds would finish a small vocal section {{at his home}} studio in Ballymena.|$|R
60|$|Only a few seconds, but a {{lifetime}} of emotion was crammed into them. Then de Marmont, with Crystal's look of loathing still eating into his soul, caught sight of Clyffurde who stood close by--Clyffurde whose one thought throughout all this unhappy scene had been of Crystal, who through <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>had</b> eyes and ears only for her.|$|R
60|$|His {{manner as}} a lecturer, says Dr. Holmes, was an {{illustration}} of his way of thinking. 'He would lose his place just as his mind would drop its thought and pick up another, twentieth cousin or no relation at all to it.' The same manner, whether we liken it to mosaic or to kaleidoscope, marks his writing. It makes him hard to follow, oracular, and enigmatical. 'Can you tell me,' asked one of his neighbour, while Emerson was lecturing, 'what connection there is between that last sentence {{and the one that}} went before, and what connection <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>has</b> with Plato?' 'None, my friend, save in God!' This is excellent in a seer, but less so in the writer.|$|E
6000|$|... "Very," [...] he {{repeated}} with biting sarcasm, whilst nervously his bony fingers {{played with the}} inevitable bit of string. [...] "Very curious indeed. Just think of the whole thing. There was the old man with all his wealth, and two sons, one to whom he is devoted, {{and the other with}} whom he does nothing but quarrel. One day there is another of these quarrels, but more violent, more terrible than any that have previously occurred, with the result that the father, heartbroken by <b>it</b> <b>all,</b> <b>has</b> an attack of apoplexy and practically dies of a broken heart. After that he alters his will, and subsequently a will is proved which {{turns out to be a}} forgery.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{could not}} hope to make you {{understand}} all that I have [...] suffered during these last few months of my illness. I would [...] not if I could. It is not worth while! My father, although [...] he knows that I am dying, will scarcely speak to me. He has [...] forgotten that I am his daughter, save when he laments it. [...] He sits alone day by day, brooding upon the dishonour of his [...] race. The priest, who prays for me, speaks words of doubtful [...] comfort, as though, after all, he doubted whether salvation [...] were possible for me. The horror of <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>has</b> entered into my [...] soul! The sin {{of the past is}} ever before my eyes,--black and [...] threatening,--and a great desolation reigns in my heart.|$|E
