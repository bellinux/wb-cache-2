One <b>index,</b> the London InterBank Offered Rate (2 ̆ 2 Libor 2 ̆ 2), may be the world 2 ̆ 7 s most important number, an interest rate benchmark upon which hundreds of trillions of dollars depend. Yet, almost every day new revelations emerge that Libor was tampered with {{during the height of}} the financial crisis by one or many of the world 2 ̆ 7 s most prominent banks, with billions of dollars potentially misappropriated.

Despite their importance, however, <b>financial</b> <b>indices</b> are poorly understood, and almost completely unstudied.

40|$|We apply RMT, Network and MF-DFA {{methods to}} {{investigate}} correlation, network and multifractal properties of 20 global <b>financial</b> <b>indices.</b> We compare results {{before and during}} the financial crisis of 2008 respectively. We find that the network method gives more useful information about the formation of clusters as compared to results obtained from eigenvectors corresponding to second largest eigenvalue and these sectors are formed on the basis of geographical location of indices. At threshold 0. 6, indices corresponding to Americas, Europe and Asia/Pacific disconnect and form different clusters before the crisis but during the crisis, indices corresponding to Americas and Europe are combined together to form a cluster while the Asia/Pacific indices forms another cluster. By further increasing the value of threshold to 0. 9, European countries France, Germany and UK constitute the most tightly linked markets. We study multifractal properties of global <b>financial</b> <b>indices</b> and find that <b>financial</b> <b>indices</b> corresponding to Americas and Europe almost lie in the same range of degree of multifractality as compared to other indices. India, South Korea, Hong Kong are found to be near the degree of multifractality of indices corresponding to Americas and Europe. A large variation in the degree of multifractality in Egypt, Indonesia, Malaysia, Taiwan and Singapore may be a reason that when we increase the threshold in financial network these countries first start getting disconnected at low threshold from the correlation network of <b>financial</b> <b>indices.</b> We fit Binomial Multifractal Model (BMFM) to these financial markets. ...|$|R

5000|$|Universal life {{insurance}} (often shortened to UL) {{is a type}} of cash value {{life insurance}}, sold primarily in the United States of America. Under the terms of the policy, the excess of premium payments above the current cost of insurance is credited to the cash value of the policy. The cash value is credited each month with interest, and the policy is debited each month by a cost of insurance (COI) charge, as well as any other policy charges and fees drawn from the cash value, even if no premium payment is made that month. Interest credited to the account is determined by the insurer, but has a contractual minimum rate (often 2%). When an earnings rate is pegged to a <b>financial</b> <b>index</b> such as a stock, bond or other interest rate index, the policy is an [...] "Indexed Universal Life" [...] contract. These types of policies offer the advantage of guaranteed level premiums throughout the insured's lifetime at substantially lower premium cost than an equivalent whole life policy at first; the cost of insurance is always increasing as found on the cost index table (usually p. 3 of a contract). This not only allows for easy comparison of costs between carriers, but also works well in irrevocable life insurance trusts (ILIT's) since cash is of no consequence.|$|E

The {{aim of this}} thesis was to investigate how construction companies manage their market risks, with a special focus on commodity risks. In addition, the thesis purpose was also to explore the composition of commodity exposures within a few selected construction companies.

In summary, the construction companies were all aware of their commodity exposures although most of them did not actively manage them or know their exposures extent.

Therefore, this thesis created and illustrated how a <b>financial</b> <b>index</b> {{could be used as}} a way to stabilize the profitability in construction projects...|$|E
