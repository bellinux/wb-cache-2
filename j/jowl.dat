500|$|Amid decolonisation and the Wind of Change, the Federation {{was looking}} ever more tenuous {{and the idea}} of [...] "no {{independence}} before majority rule" [...] was gaining considerable ground in British political circles. Harper called for Southern Rhodesia to abandon the Federation and [...] "go it alone". In June 1960 he and the Southern Rhodesian branch of the Dominion Party adopted the policy of [...] "Southern Rhodesia first", prompting strong protests from the party's Northern Rhodesian division; the Dominion Party splintered into separate Federal and territorial entities a month later. When black nationalist riots broke out in the townships in October 1960, Harper condemned the Southern Rhodesian Prime Minister Sir Edgar Whitehead and the governing United Federal Party (UFP) as too lenient on the protesters, and argued that giving concessions following political violence would make black Rhodesians believe that [...] "trouble pays dividends". Arguing against black representation in the Legislative Assembly, he said that if there were black MPs [...] "they will share the restaurant with us and they will share the bars with us. We will be living cheek by <b>jowl</b> with them, and what sort of legislation can {{the people of this country}} expect when we ourselves are being conditioned to living cheek by <b>jowl</b> with Africans?" ...|$|E
500|$|However, Toby E. Huff {{writes that}} Shen Kuo's [...] "scattered set" [...] of {{writings}} lacks clear-cut organization and [...] "theoretical acuteness," [...] that is, scientific theory. Nathan Sivin wrote that Shen's originality stands [...] "cheek by <b>jowl</b> with trivial didacticism, court anecdotes, and ephemeral curiosities" [...] that provide little insight. Donald Holzman writes that Shen [...] "has nowhere organized his observations into {{anything like a}} general theory." [...] Huff writes {{that this was a}} systemic problem of early Chinese science, which lacked systematic treatment that could be found in European works such as the Concordance and Discordant Canons by the lawyer Gratian of Bologna (fl. 12th century). In regard to an overarching concept of science which could branch together all the various sciences studied by the Chinese, Sivin asserts that the writings of Shen Kuo [...] "do not indicate that he achieved, or even sought, an integrated framework for his diverse knowledge; the one common thread is the varied responsibilities of his career as a high civil servant." ...|$|E

500|$|After {{a year at}} RADA, Morrissey {{went back}} to Liverpool to perform in WCPC at the Liverpool Playhouse. He then did Le Cid and Twelfth Night with Cheek by <b>Jowl,</b> and spent two years with the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC), principally with {{director}} Deborah Warner for whom he played the Bastard in King John in 1988. He saw the role as a learning opportunity, as he had often wondered at RADA if he would ever {{have the chance to}} act in classical theatre. His performance has been described as [...] "the most contentious characterisation of the production"; he received negative critical reaction from Daily Telegraph and Independent critics, but a positive opinion from the Financial Times. In The Guardian, Nicholas de Jongh wrote, [...] "The Bastard, who has the most complex syntax in early Shakespeare, half defeats David Morrissey. His slurred, sometimes unintelligible diction helps to deflate the Bastard, but his bawling rhetoric strikes as mere sham rather than fierce plain speaking." [...] Morrissey also spent time with the National, where he played the title role in Peer Gynt (1990). Michael Billington praised the unkempt energy of his performance. During this time, he lived on the housing estate in White City, where he and his flatmates were the frequent victims of burglars.|$|E

Fortunately, Owen landed a job with Cheek by <b>Jowl</b> and followed the theatre company on tour around the world performing Shakespeare plays. Owen has said that he wished he had gone to university, and that he had been [...] "in too much of a rush".|$|E

He also expressed concern about how standards would be interpreted in the show ring. While some breeders have shown {{their support for the}} new standards, others are upset with the new standards and have threatened legal actions against the Kennel Club. The Chairman of the British Bulldog Breed Council said of the new Bulldog standard: [...] "What you'll get is a completely different dog, not a British bulldog.

2500|$|Defenseless, and hungry, {{the band}} moved north. [...] Perhaps the first raid of the Spirit Lake Massacre came at Lost Island Lake, now near Ruthven, Iowa. [...] A warrior of the group, who {{approached}} the Gillett cabin, {{was shot and}} decapitated while looking for food and rifles. [...] As the tribe destroyed homes and lives on their journey, they came across <b>Jowl</b> Howe, who was also decapitated. [...] The warriors killed 35-40 settlers, regardless of age or gender. [...] Most {{of the victims were}} scalped. The Sioux took four young women as captives, 14-year-old Abbie Gardner and three who were married, and headed back to Minnesota territory. [...] Word spread about the attacks, and the U.S. Indian Agent organized an armed militia of white citizens. Because of the heavy snows, a relief expedition from Fort Dodge failed to arrive in time to defend Springfield. Another expedition from Fort Ridgely in Minnesota pursued Inkpaduta and his band, but failed to catch them.|$|E
2500|$|Owen's film {{career has}} {{included}} appearances in short films, and supporting roles in The Republic of Love (2003) (as Peter), {{which was based}} on a novel by Pulitzer Prize-winning author Carol Shields, and in Miss Potter (2006) (as a solicitor named William Heelis who married children's author Beatrix Potter). However, Owen's first love has always been the theatre. Early in his professional career he was involved in the Cheek by <b>Jowl</b> productions of Philoctetes and the Shakespeare plays Macbeth, The Tempest and Twelfth Night. Owen's break on stage was playing Nick in Edward Albee's Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? (1962), directed by Howard Davies, at the Almeida Theatre in London in 1996. Owen studied the play during his A-levels, and it is his favourite play. Other highlights of his stage career include playing Dan in Closer by Patrick Marber in 1998 and George in The York Realist by Peter Gill in 2002. Critics praised his performance in the latter play as [...] "astonishing in its power, throttled fury and sadness" [...] and [...] "superb, richly voiced", and called him [...] "a fast-rising star".|$|E

2500|$|... n our fast {{changing}} world where technology is outdated in a blink and future-proofing is the gold standard, the grid has demonstrated remarkable flexibility. Over two hundred years, {{the scale of}} architecture has changed from three-story walk-ups to skyscrapers more than 1,000 feet tall. Parks and avenues unanticipated by the plan have been created. The grid {{gave rise to a}} particular kind of urbanism. Unlike Washington, D.C., and the capital cities of Europe, New York does not have axial avenues that focus on star buildings. New York has buildings that sit cheek by <b>jowl</b> and anonymously form street walls. It has narrow canyons of space bounded by those street walls with views of the horizon. It has density and enclosure but also the thrill of open-ended space. Yet when modernist urban theories turned against the vernacular urbanism of New York, and superblocks and towers in the park were imposed on the city, the grid absorbed those inventions. [...] Although New York's real estate dynamism is typically associated with disrespect for history, with buildings toppled {{for the next generation of}} taller ones, the 1811 grid endures as living history. The plan leaves its imprint on every block, lot, and building in Manhattan, and has provided a remarkably flexible framework for growth and change.|$|E
