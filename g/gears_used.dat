2500|$|The third {{requirement}} {{is for a}} linkage between the [...] "machines" [...] (engine and gun) to be synchronized. Many early <b>gears</b> <b>used</b> an intricate and inherently fragile bell crank and push rod linkage that could easily jam or otherwise malfunction, especially when required to work at higher speeds {{than it had been}} designed for. There were several alternative methods, including an oscillating rod, a flexible drive, a column of hydraulic fluid, a cable, or an electrical connection.|$|E
2500|$|A cyclist's legs produce power optimally {{within a}} narrow {{pedalling}} speed range, or cadence. Gearing can be optimized {{to use this}} narrow range as efficiently as possible. As in other types of transmissions, the gear ratio {{is closely related to}} the mechanical advantage of the drivetrain of the bicycle. On single-speed bicycles and multi-speed bicycles using derailleur gears, the gear ratio depends on the ratio of the number of teeth on the chainring to the number of teeth on the rear sprocket (cog). [...] For bicycles equipped with hub gears, the gear ratio also depends on the internal planetary gears within the hub. For a shaft-driven bicycle the gear ratio depends on the bevel <b>gears</b> <b>used</b> {{at each end of the}} shaft.|$|E
50|$|There are {{sintered}} bronze double-cone blocker rings on the synchronizers for 1st and 2nd gears, while 3rd and 4th <b>gears</b> <b>use</b> carbon fiber blocker rings, and 5th and Reverse <b>gears</b> <b>use</b> molybdenum on their synchronizers. Carbon and molybdenum are extremely durable friction surfaces that remain stable even under extreme heat.|$|R

2500|$|To achieve such {{consistent}} relative differences {{the absolute}} gear ratios {{should be in}} logarithmic progression; most off-the-shelf cogsets do this with small absolute differences between the smaller sprockets and increasingly larger absolute differences as the sprockets get larger. [...] Because sprockets must have a (relatively small) whole number of teeth {{it is impossible to}} achieve a perfect progression; for example the seven derailleur sprockets 14-16-18-21-24-28-32 have an average step size of around 15% but with actual steps varying between 12.5% and 16.7%. The epicyclic <b>gears</b> <b>used</b> within hub gears have more scope for varying the number of teeth than do derailleur sprockets, so {{it may be possible to}} get much closer to the ideal of consistent relative differences, e.g. the Rohloff Speedhub offers 14 speeds with an average relative difference of 13.6% and individual variations of around 0.1%.|$|E

5000|$|In 1760, John Murdoch {{installed}} the first iron-toothed <b>gears</b> <b>used</b> in a mill in Britain at Bello Mill. These gears were cast at Carron's Foundry in Falkirk. Bello Mill {{was at that}} point the most technically sophisticated mill in the UK.|$|E
50|$|Many {{transmissions}} and <b>gears</b> <b>used</b> in automotive {{and truck}} applications {{are contained in}} a cast iron case, though more frequently aluminium is used for lower weight especially in cars. There are usually three shafts: a mainshaft, a countershaft, and an idler shaft.|$|E
50|$|Double {{clutching}} (also called double de-clutching) is {{a method}} of shifting <b>gears</b> <b>used</b> primarily for vehicles with an unsynchronized manual transmission, such as commercial trucks and specialty vehicles. While double clutching is not necessary in a vehicle that has a synchronized manual transmission, the technique can be advantageous for smoothly downshifting in order to accelerate.|$|E

50|$|Valve gear was {{a fertile}} field of invention, with {{probably}} several hundred variations devised over the years. However, {{only a small}} number of these saw any widespread use. They can be divided into those that drove the standard reciprocating valves (whether piston valves or slide valves), those used with poppet valves, and stationary engine trip <b>gears</b> <b>used</b> with semi-rotary Corliss valves or drop valves.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the first}} {{self-acting}} valve <b>gears</b> <b>used</b> for steam engines was the eccentric valve gear. This placed an eccentric on the engine's crankshaft, that in turn drove a strap and a long rod to the valve's actuating spindle. This was a simple valve gear but worked well for rotative engines that ran continuously for long periods, and in only one direction. For early mill engines this was acceptable.|$|E

50|$|Drag nets are {{commonly}} used in the lagoon. Other fishing <b>gears</b> <b>used</b> are bottles also called 'atukpaxe' which are mostly used by women, hook and line, acadja and traps. Although acadjas act as fish aggregating devices that provide shelter for fish thereby enhancing fish breeding in the lagoon, the use of mangroves and twigs, which are cut from neighboring vegetation, makes this method of fishing environmentally unfriendly. When the lagoon waters are low fish are caught using the hand.|$|E

Nuclear-trained Enlisted Sailors perform duties in nuclear propulsion plants operating reactor controls and propulsion and power generation systems.|$|E
5000|$|A {{differentially}} steered robot {{is similar}} to the differential <b>gears</b> <b>used</b> in automobiles in that both the wheels can have different rates of rotations, but unlike the differential gearing system, a differentially steered system will have both the wheels powered. Differential wheeled robots are used extensively in robotics, since their motion is easy to program and can be well controlled. Virtually all consumer robots on the market today use differential steering primarily for its low cost and simplicity.|$|E
