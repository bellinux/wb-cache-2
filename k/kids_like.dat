5|$|The {{series was}} pitched to the Nine Network through Harris and Graeme-Evans' joint {{independent}} production company, <b>Kids</b> <b>Like</b> Us. A pilot was filmed in mid-1998, which {{was shown to}} a test audience. No changes to the format were made after this test. After being commissioned, the first full series began production in October. The Nine Network initially signed a co-venture with <b>Kids</b> <b>Like</b> Us to produce two 45-episode series of the show and the first went to air on Nine in April 1999. Hi-5 was granted a P classification, deeming it specifically {{designed to meet the}} needs and interests of pre-schoolers, allowing it to be broadcast on the Nine Network with a 30-minute runtime commercial-free. The first series was produced for US$20,000 to US$30,000 for each episode.|$|E
500|$|Hi-5 is an Australian children's {{television}} series, originally {{produced by}} <b>Kids</b> <b>Like</b> Us and later Southern Star for the Nine Network and created by Helena Harris and Posie Graeme-Evans. The program {{is known for}} its educational content, and for the cast of the program, who became a recognised musical group for children outside of the series, known collectively as Hi-5. It has generated discussion about what is considered appropriate television for children. The series premiered in April 1999 on the Nine Network.|$|E

Cyma Zarghami, the president of the Nickelodeon networks, said [...] "We do know that <b>kids</b> <b>like</b> events as much as adults do [...] There's a certain amount of water-cooler talk that goes on among kids." ...|$|E

500|$|The Hi-5 brand was {{originally}} owned by its creators, Harris, and Graeme-Evans, under their joint privately owned production company <b>Kids</b> <b>Like</b> Us. Unlike peer entertainers the Wiggles, {{the cast of}} Hi-5 did not hold equity, but were rather employees of the brand. Because of this, the original cast in early years stated that they had financial difficulties, even though the Hi-5 brand was earning millions. Crawford stated, [...] "the money system has to {{go a long way}} around before it gets to us." [...] In March 2008, the Nine Network, along with production company Southern Star, purchased the Hi-5 brand. The franchise was placed under the direction of Martin Hersov and Cathy Payne, also Nine and Southern Star executives, while Harris and Graeme-Evans ended their involvement with the company along with the sale.|$|E
500|$|Others {{were less}} enamored with Ferris, many taking {{issue with the}} film's [...] "rebel without a cause" [...] hedonism. David Denby of New York Magazine, called the film [...] "a nauseating {{distillation}} of the slack, greedy side of Reaganism." [...] Author Christina Lee agreed, adding it was a “splendidly ridiculous exercise in unadulterated indulgence,” and the film “encapsulated the Reagan era's near solipsist worldview and insatiable appetite for immediate gratification—of living in and for the moment....” Gene Siskel panned the film from a Chicago-centric perspective saying “Ferris Bueller doesn't do anything much fun ... hey don't even sit in the bleachers where all the <b>kids</b> <b>like</b> to sit {{when they go to}} Cubs games.” Siskel did enjoy the chemistry between Jennifer Grey and Charlie Sheen. Ebert thought Siskel was too eager to find flaws in the film's view of Chicago.|$|E
500|$|Instead {{the bands}} {{presented}} themselves as {{no different from}} minor local bands. Jack Endino said in the 1996 documentary Hype! that Seattle bands were inconsistent live performers, since their primary objective {{was not to be}} entertainers, but simply to [...] "rock out". Grunge bands gave enthusiastic performances; they would thrash their long hair during shows as [...] "a symbolic weapon" [...] for releasing [...] "pent-up aggression" [...] (Dave Grohl was particularly noted for his [...] "head flips"). One of the philosophies of the grunge scene was authenticity. Dave Rimmer writes that with the revival of punk ideals of stripped-down music in the early 1990s, [...] "for Cobain, and lots of <b>kids</b> <b>like</b> him, rock & roll...threw down a dare: Can you be pure enough, day after day, year after year, to prove your authenticity, {{to live up to the}} music ... And if you can't, can you live with being a poseur, a phony, a sellout?" ...|$|E

500|$|After {{appearing}} in minor roles in Fall and Home Alone 3 (both 1997), Johansson garnered wider attention for her {{performance in the}} film The Horse Whisperer (1998), directed by Robert Redford. The drama film, based on the 1995 novel {{of the same name}} by Nicholas Evans, {{tells the story of a}} talented trainer with a remarkable gift for understanding horses who is hired to help an injured teenager (played by Johansson). The actress received an [...] "introducing" [...] credit on this film, although it was her seventh role. On Johansson's maturity, Redford described her as [...] "13 going on 30". Todd McCarthy of Variety commented that Johansson [...] "convincingly conveys the awkwardness of her age and the inner pain of a carefree girl suddenly laid low by horrible happenstance". For the film, she was nominated for the Chicago Film Critics Association Award for Most Promising Actress. She believed that the film changed many things in her life, realizing that acting is the ability to manipulate one's emotions. On finding good roles as a teenager, Johansson said it was hard for her as adults wrote the scripts and they [...] "portray <b>kids</b> <b>like</b> mall rats and not seriously ... Kids and teenagers just aren't being portrayed with any real depth".|$|E
500|$|M. Keith Booker {{cites the}} episode in Drawn to Television, while {{discussing}} The Simpsons treatment of religion. Booker cites {{a scene from}} the episode where Milhouse asks Bart what religions have to gain by lying about concepts such as the existence of a soul– and then the scene cuts to Reverend Lovejoy counting his money; Booker believes that this implies that religions create mythologies so that they can gain money from followers. He juxtaposes this with Bart's realization later in the episode that [...] "life suddenly feels empty and incomplete" [...] without a soul, which suggests [...] "either that the soul is real or it is at least a useful fiction". Mark I. Pinsky and Samuel F. Parvin discuss the episode in their book The Gospel According to the Simpsons: Leader's Guide for Group Study, and use examples from it to stimulate discussion among youth {{about the nature of the}} soul. Pinsky and Parvin note Bart's statement to Milhouse from the beginning of the episode: [...] "Soul— come on, Milhouse, there's no such thing as a soul. It's just something they made up to scare <b>kids,</b> <b>like</b> the Boogie Man or Michael Jackson", and then suggest questions to ask students, including whether they know individuals that agree with Bart, and their views on the existence of a soul.|$|E

2500|$|Discovery is {{recognized}} as a concept album. It relates strongly to Daft Punk's childhood memories, incorporating their love of cinema and character. Thomas Bangalter specified that the album deals with the duo's experiences {{growing up in the}} decade between 1975 and 1985, rather than it just being a tribute to the music of that period. The record was designed to reflect a playful, honest and open-minded attitude toward listening to music. Bangalter compared it to the state of childhood when one does not judge or analyze music. Bangalter noted the stylistic approach of the album was in contrast to that of their previous effort. [...] "Homework [...] was a way to say to the rock <b>kids,</b> <b>like,</b> 'Electronic music is cool'. Discovery was the opposite, of saying to the electronic kids, 'Rock is cool, you know? You can like that.'" [...] He elaborated that Homework had been [...] "a rough and raw thing" [...] focused on sound production and texture, whereas the goal with Discovery was to explore song structures and new musical forms. This change in sound was inspired by Aphex Twin's [...] "Windowlicker".|$|E

2500|$|On June 12, 1942, Bong flew {{very low}} ("buzzed") over {{a house in}} nearby San Anselmo, {{the home of a}} pilot who had just been married. He was cited and {{temporarily}} grounded for breaking flying rules, along with three other P-38 pilots who had looped around the Golden Gate Bridge on the same day. For looping the Golden Gate Bridge, flying at a low level down Market Street in San Francisco, and blowing the clothes off of an Oakland woman's clothesline, Bong was reprimanded by General George C. Kenney, commanding officer of the Fourth Air Force, who told him, [...] "If you didn't want to fly down Market Street, I wouldn't have you in my Air Force, but you are not to do it any more and I mean what I say." [...] Kenney later wrote, [...] "We needed <b>kids</b> <b>like</b> this lad." [...] In all subsequent accounts, Bong denied flying under the Golden Gate Bridge. Nevertheless, Bong was still grounded when the rest of his group was sent without him to England in July 1942. Bong then transferred to another Hamilton Field unit, 84th Fighter Squadron of the 78th Fighter Group. From there, Bong was sent to the Southwest Pacific Area.|$|E
2500|$|Tom Cruise has {{described}} the medications Ritalin (methylphenidate) and Adderall (a mixed-salt amphetamine formulation) as [...] "street drugs". Ushma S. Neill criticized this view, stating that the doses of stimulants used {{in the treatment of}} ADHD do not cause addiction and that there is some evidence of a reduced risk of later substance addiction in children treated with stimulants. In the UK, Susan Greenfield spoke out publicly in 2007 in the House of Lords about the need for a wide-ranging inquiry into the dramatic increase in the diagnosis of ADHD, and possible causes. Her comments followed a BBC Panorama program that highlighted research that suggested medications are no better than other forms of therapy in the long term. In 2010, the BBC Trust criticized the 2007 Panorama program for summarizing the research as showing [...] "no demonstrable improvement in children's behaviour after staying on ADHD medication for three years" [...] when in actuality [...] "the study found that medication did offer a significant improvement over time" [...] although the long-term benefits of medication were found to be [...] "no better than children who were treated with behavior therapy."

2500|$|Jones {{was always}} {{prepared}} {{to adapt to}} changing tastes. In 1950, when America was nostalgically {{looking back at the}} 1920s, Jones recorded an album of Charleston arrangements. In 1953 he responded to the growing market for children's records, with tunes aimed directly at <b>kids</b> (<b>like</b> [...] "Socko, the Smallest Snowball"). Jones had become unhappy at RCA Victor and left the label in 1955. His later recordings were issued by Verve, Liberty and Warner Bros. In 1956 Jones supervised an album of Christmas songs, many of which were performed seriously. In 1957, noting the television success of Lawrence Welk and his dance band, he revamped his own act for television. Gone was the old City Slickers mayhem, replaced by a more straightforward big-band sound, with tongue-in-cheek comic moments. The new band was known as Spike Jones and the Band that Plays for Fun.The last City Slickers record was the LP Dinner Music for People Who Aren't Very Hungry. The whole field of comedy records changed from musical satires to spoken-word comedy (Bob Newhart, Mort Sahl, Stan Freberg). Spike Jones adapted to this, too; most of his later albums are spoken-word comedy, including the horror-genre sendup Spike Jones in Stereo (1959) and the send-up of television programs of the period in Omnibust (1960). Jones remained topical to the last: his final group, Spike Jones's New Band, recorded four LPs of brassy renditions of pop-folk tunes of the 1960s (including [...] "Washington Square" [...] and [...] "The Ballad of Jed Clampett"). One of his New Band tracks in 1964 was a cover of [...] "Dominique", a hit by The Singing Nun, in which he not only plays part of the melody on a banjo but melds the melody successfully with [...] "When the Saints Go Marching In!" ...|$|E
