The nasal pits deepen and develop the nasal sacs in the sixth week. These new structures grow dorsocaudally in front of the forming brain. In the beginning, the nasal sacs are separated from the oral cavity by the oronasal membrane. This membrane disappears in the seventh week leaving a connection between the nasal cavities and the oral cavity, called the primitive choanae. Later, when the development of the secondary palate occurs, the choanae changes its position and locates at the junction of the nasal cavity and the pharynx. The nasal septum grows as a <b>downgrowth</b> from the merged nasal prominences and fuses with the palatine process between the ninth and eleventh week. Finally, the superior, middle and inferior conchae develop the lateral wall of each nasal cavity.|$|E

40|$|In {{the newborn}} mouse the glands of Brunner {{consist of a}} few tubular <b>downgrowths</b> from the {{proximal}} duodenal crypts.

After this time, however, the mitotic activity of the mature gland cells is sufficient to account for the continuing increase in cell population. After the fourth postnatal week the mitotic and labelling indices decline markedly, and although mitoses are rarely seen in individual sections from older animals, cellular addition at a very slow rate is sufficient to account for the gradual expansion in size of the gland, and the process continues long after the adult body weight has been established...|$|R

Surface epithelial cells exhibited myriad microvillous processes scant to moderate mitochondria. In one case, prominent hemidesmosomal junctions were present. Immunohistochemical staining with monoclonal antikeratin antibodies revealed immunoreactivity with AE 1, AE 3, and AE 11 in all cases, but with a cornea-specific antibody, AE 5, in only one case.

The incidence of this condition after cataract surgery was 0. 12 %, decreasing to 0. 08 % over the latter decade. 82 % of postsurgical patients with epithelial <b>downgrowth</b> presented to the ophthalmologist within one year following surgery, commonly complaining of decreasing visual acuity, red eye, and pain. The most common presenting signs of epithelial <b>downgrowth</b> were retrocorneal membrane, which was seen in 45 % of patients, glaucoma in 43 %, corneal oedema in 21 %, and a positive Seidel test in 23 %.

We used a truncated keratin 5 (ΔK 5) promoter to assess the potential role of the human M 2 SMO mutant in BCC development in adult transgenic mice. ΔK 5 -M 2 SMO mouse epidermis is hyperproliferative, ex presses BCC protein markers and gives rise to numerous epithelial <b>downgrowths</b> invading the underlying dermis.

40|$|The {{effect on}} the {{epithelium}} in the mouse uterovaginal canal of daily injections of 5 μg. oestradiol for the first 5 days after birth has been studied. Control young were injected with olive oil. The mice were followed up to 6 months after birth. The neonatal oestradiol treatment results in a strong suppression of the mitotic rate in the undifferentiated müllerian epithelium in the vaginal fornix, the uterine cervix and—after an initial stimulation—also in the uterine horns. In the vaginal fornix and the uterine cervix of animals neonatally treated with oestradiol, regions develop with an atypical epithelium—principally a columnar epithelium—instead of the normal stratified epithelium. In the uterine horns, there is a glandular hyperplasia; in the vagina, cornified epithelium. Later, the atypical epithelium forms glandular-like <b>downgrowths</b> into the stroma, sometimes with a diffuse border to the stroma. The atypical epithelium shows the same distribution and activity of acid and alkaline phosphatase as the uterine epithelium. The regions with atypical epithelium have the same extension after castration and a following oestradiol treatment as in animals neonatally treated with oestradiol only. The nature of the atypical epithelium and the mechanism at its development is discussed...|$|R
40|$|Reported {{here is the}} {{structural}} and immunohistochemical similarities between the Yucatan hairless micropig (HMP) skin and that of humans. Hairless micropig skin surface was composed of complex intersecting furrows that created geometric patterns remarkably similar to human skin surface glyphics. The dermal [...] epidermal interface consisted of undulant <b>downgrowths</b> that interdigitated with dermal papillae. Hairless micropig epidermis contained two morphologically distinct populations of basal keratinocytes (serrated and nonserrated). Similar heterogeneity has been seen only in human epidermis and primate palmar epidermis. Immunohistochemistry revealed that the HMP epidermis is reactive with monoclonal and polyclonal antisera to keratin proteins. Melanocytes reactive with antisera to S- 100 protein, as in human skin, also were observed in HMP epidermis. Organization of dermal extracellular matrix, including collagen and elastic fibers, and the organization and reactivity of the microvasculature with antisera to factor VIII, were consistent with human skin. The costicosteroid-induced atrophy and subsequent rebound phenomenon after withdrawal of steroid observed in HMP skin was similar with that observed in humans.

Colitis cystica profunda (CCP), a disease that affects humans and is characterized by the presence of mucin-filled epithelial <b>downgrowths</b> and cysts in the colonic submucosa, was found in 24 of the 33 (72. 7 %) tamarins. Interstitial myocardial fibrosis was present in 22 (66. 6 %) animals, and various degrees of membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis occurred in 28 (84. 8 %) monkeys.

A thin sheet of silicone with microgrooves was applied on the tubes. Two types of texturing were used, a square groove of 10 microm wide and 1 microm deep; or a V-shaped groove of 40 microm wide. The grooves were directed either along the long axis of the catheter tube (grooves perpendicular to the skin surface) or circling around the catheter (grooves directed parallel to the skin surface). As controls, catheters with a smooth outer surface were used. Implants were placed in 30 rats, with a follow-up period of 9 weeks. During this time, animals were inspected biweekly, and catheter exit sites were evaluated using a scoring system. At the end of the 9 -week period the implants and surrounding tissues were processed for histological evaluation. For the clinical evaluation of the exit sites, no statistical {{differences were found between the}} study groups. Histologically, epithelial <b>downgrowth</b> was observed for all samples. The histomorphometrical measurements showed that there were no differences in <b>downgrowth</b> between the smooth and parallel-grooved catheters.

40|$|The fine {{structural}} {{organization of}} the epidermis, dermal/epidermal junction, and dermis from an unexposed site (upper inner arm) of elderly people was compared with the organization of a similar region of young people. Despite an overall thinning of the epidermis and focal areas of cytologic atypia, the characteristic morphological markers associated with the keratinization process are not markedly altered in appearance or amount. A well-formed stratum corneum consisting of flattened, enucleated horny cells enveloped by a thickened membrane, and intracellular spaces filled with electron-dense material provide structural evidence that barrier ability is not compromised in senile skin. The dermal/epidermal changes in aged skin are marked and have significant physiologic implications. The major change is a relatively flat dermal/epidermal junction resulting from the retraction of the epidermal papillae {{as well as the}} microprojections of basal cells into the dermis. This flattening results in a more fragile epidermal/dermal interface and, consequently, the epidermis is less resistant to shearing forces. Retraction of the epidermal <b>downgrowths</b> (preferential sites of the putative epidermal stem cell) may also explain the loss in proliferative capacity associated with the aged epidermis. The three-dimensional arrangements of collagen and elastic fibers showed marked alterations with age. Both fibrous components appear more compact because of a decrease in spaces between the fibers. Collagen bundles appear to unravel, and the individual elastic fibers show signs of elastosis. These changes may contribute to the loss of resilience {{that is one of the}} salient features of senile skin. J Invest Dermatol 88 : 44 s- 51 s, 198...|$|R
40|$|Background: Epithelial and fibrous downgrowths {{result from}} {{persistently}} leaky wounds with conjunctival or corneal epithelium and fibroblasts growing over corneal endothelium, iris and angle structures, leading to corneal edema and difficult-to-control glaucoma.

While the features of epithelial <b>downgrowth</b> following corneal transplantation are well described, its association with primary graft failure has only been reported once previously. We report a case of primary corneal graft failure (PGF) associated with retrocorneal epithelial cell ingrowth. Case presentation A 59 year-old male underwent an uncomplicated penetrating keratoplasty for Fuchs' corneal dystrophy. The patient developed PGF, and a second transplant was performed 5 weeks after the initial surgery. The initial host corneal button and the failed corneal graft were examined with light microscopy. Histopathologic examination of the excised corneal button demonstrated multilaminar epithelial cells on the posterior corneal surface and absence of endothelial cells. DNA extraction and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for herpes simplex virus (HSV) DNA {{was performed on the}} failed corneal graft. Polymerase chain reaction performed on the failed corneal graft was negative for HSV DNA, which has been implicated in selected cases of PGF. Three years following repeat penetrating keratoplasty, {{there was no evidence of}} recurrent epithelial ingrowth. Conclusion This is only the second report of PGF associated with epithelialization of the posterior corneal button, which most likely developed subsequent to, instead of causing, the diffuse endothelial cell loss and primary graft failure. </p...|$|E
40|$|Background and objective: Modification of {{the root}} surface may play an {{important}} role in regenerating the periodontal attachment between the root and periodontal connective tissue. We speculated that bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) application to root surface resulted in a novel attachment by cementum-like hard tissue, although non-osteogenic tissue proliferated to the root surface. The aim of this study was to examine whether BMP- 2 guided cementum-like tissue deposition on a BMP-conditioned root surface. Material and Methods: Root dentin on the buccal side of 24 teeth in four beagle dogs was surgically exposed. The denuded root dentin surfaces were demineralized with EDTA and washed with saline. Subsequently, 15 μl of BMP- 2 solution (loading dose; 0. 4 and 1. 0 μg/μl) was applied to the root dentin surface. In the control, phosphate-buffered saline was applied to the root surface. Specimens were histologically analyzed 16 weeks after surgery. Results: Formation of cementum-like tissue was frequently observed on the BMP- 2 -conditioned root at the coronal portion. Cellular cementum-like tissue was separated from the original cementum and encapsulated with gingival connective tissue. Cementum-like tissue formation with BMP at 1. 0 μg/μl was significantly greater than those in the control and BMP at 0. 4 μg/μl. <b>Downgrowth</b> of the junctional epithelium in the 1. 0 μg/μl BMP group was significantly less than that in the control.

40|$|ABSTRACT A {{photographic}} {{study of}} development of chick embryos cultured in vitro {{was conducted in}} order to demonstrate the relationship between embryos and extraembryonic membranes during culture. Survival of embryos in this system has been extended to 21 days of total incubation (3 days in shell plus 18 days in vitro) and development to Hamburger-Hamilton stage 45 (partial or complete yolk sac retraction). A few mature cultured embryos have "pipped" through the chorioallantoic membrane and have emitted audible peeping. Three-day embryos and egg contents were cultured in commercial plastic wrap suspended in plastic tripods. The yolk sac expanded and flattened to cover {{the bottom of the}} culture chamber by five days of total incubation. <b>Downgrowth</b> of the yolk sac vascular system along the plastic wrap walls of the chamber began by six days, while <b>downgrowth</b> of the chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) began by eight days. The CAM often completely enclosed cultured egg contents by 17 days, an event which occurs in ovo by 11 to 12 days. Lack of formation of the albumen sac resulted in inhibition of albumen uptake during the latter portion of incubation. A small number of embryos were on their right side rather than on the normal left side during the first two days of culture. Many of the right side cultured embryos experienced "compensatory torsion " onto their left side by three days of culture (six days of total incubation) ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Initiation of {{the hair}} {{follicle}} placode and its subsequent growth, maturation and cycling in post-natal skin requires signaling interactions between epithelial cells and adjacent dermal cells and involves Shh signaling via the primary cilium. Previous reports have implicated laminins in hair follicle epithelial invagination. Results Here we use a human BCC model system and mouse mutants to re-evaluate the role of laminin- 511 in epithelial invagination in the skin. Blocking laminin 511 and 332 in BCCs maintains primary cilia and Shh signalling, but prevents invagination. Similarly, in laminin- 511 and dermal beta- 1 integrin mutants, dermal papilla development and primary cilia formation are normal. Dermal beta- 1 integrin mutants have normal hair follicle development.

Such membranes {{have been shown to}} arise from corneoscleral stromal <b>downgrowth</b> [[4]], but the potential effect of silicone oil in accelerating or worsening the development of a retroprosthetic membrane must be considered. Some reports have documented the alleged ability of silicone oil to promote the formation of preretinal membranes [[5],[6]]. There is at least one study describing the increased concentrations of fibrogenic growth factors in the setting of intraocular silicone oil [[6]].|$|E
40|$|Verrucous hemangiomas are a rare {{specific}} {{variant of}} equine skin tumors not well {{described in the}} literature. An 8 -year-old geld-ing presented a unilateral lesion on the pastern. Macroscopically, the mass showed a warty and verrucous surface with focal ulcerations. The histology showed a dermal proliferation of endothelial-layered capillaries and venules separated by a delicate stroma of scant fibroblasts and collagen deposition, with pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia (exuberant reactive irregular epithe-lial hyperplasia with tongue-like projections extending into the dermis, mimicking <b>downgrowth</b> of squamous cell carcinoma) and orthokeratotic hyperkeratosis of the overlying epidermis. The immunohistochemical study confirmed the endothelial origin of the tumor, and a final diagnosis of verrucous hemangioma with pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia was confirmed. To {{the knowledge of the}} authors, this is the first detailed description of this entity in adult horses. Moreover, the clinical progression and epidermal changes have not been previously reported, emphasizing the importance of a pathological study of any epithelial preneoplastic lesion to rule out an underlying dermal neoplasia...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWell-preserved jaw {{fragments}} and skull bones {{of a new}} scincomorphan lizard are described from the continental Hainin Formation (Middle Palaeocene) of the Mons Basin in southwestern Belgium. This taxon, Scincoideus haininensis gen. et sp. nov., is characterised by vermiculate dermal rugosities and represents the earliest formally recognised scincoid in Europe. It differs from cordylids (girdled lizards) by lacking the parietal <b>downgrowth</b> and differs from scincids (skinks) by having robustly built bones and a well-developed lingual cusp on tooth crowns. By its mosaic characters, S. haininensis is considered here as being a basal scincoid lizard close to the origin of cordylids and scincids. Palaeobiogeographic analysis suggests that scincoids were present in Europe from the Palaeocene or maybe even before the Cretaceous/ Palaeogene boundary {{and that they were}} replaced by modern scincoids such as true scincids and cordylids during the Eocene. The origin of the latter two families in Europe was very likely related with the immigration of the first modern mammals...|$|E
40|$|Hereditary hypertrichoses are a {{group of}} hair {{overgrowth}} syndromes that are extremely rare in humans. We have previously demonstrated that a position effect on TRPS 1 is associated with hypertrichosis in humans and mice. To gain insight into the functional role of Trps 1, we analyzed the late morphogenesis vibrissae phenotype of Trps 1 (Δgt) mutant mice, which is characterized by follicle degeneration after peg <b>downgrowth</b> has been initiated. We found that Trps 1 directly represses expression of the hair follicle stem cell regulator Sox 9 to control proliferation of the follicle epithelium. Furthermore, we identified a copy number variation upstream of SOX 9 in a family with hypertrichosis that significantly decreases expression of the gene in the hair follicle, providing {{new insights into the}} long-range regulation of SOX 9. Our findings uncover a novel transcriptional hierarchy that regulates epithelial proliferation in the developing hair follicle and contributes to the pathology of hypertrichosis...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the effect of the pore characteristics of β-tricalcium phosphate (β-TCP) on periodontal healing in class III furcation defects in dogs. Two types of β-TCP were prepared for grafting; 1) a tunnel pipe structure with an inner diameter of 300 μm, and 2) continuous pore structure with interconnected macropores. The furcations of thirty mandibular premolar teeth were implanted with each type of β-TCP or were left untreated as control. The dogs were sacrificed 8 weeks post-surgery, and healing was evaluated histologically. <b>Downgrowth</b> of junctional epithelium in the tunnel structure group was significantly less than that in the other two groups (p< 0. 01). There was significantly more new bone formation and new cementum formation in the tunnel structure group than that in the other two groups (p< 0. 01). These findings suggested that β-TCP with a tunnel pipe structure promotes periodontal healing in class III furcation defects...|$|E
