40|$|Introduction: People with {{substance}} use problems {{have a higher}} prevalence of modifiable health risk behaviors. Routine clinician provision of preventive care may be effective in reducing such health behaviors. This study aimed to examine clinician provision of preventive care to clients of community substance use treatment services. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was undertaken with 386 clients and 54 clinicians of community substance use treatment services in one health district in New South Wales, Australia. Client- and clinician-reported provision of three elements of care (assessment, brief advice and referral) for three health risk behaviors (tobacco smoking, insufficient fruit and/or vegetable consumption and insufficient physical activity) was assessed, with associations with client characteristics examined. Results: Provision was highest for tobacco smoking assessment (90 % <b>client</b> <b>reported,</b> 87 % clinician reported) and brief advice (79 % <b>client</b> <b>reported,</b> 80 % clinician reported) and lowest for fruit and vegetable consumption (assessment 23 %, brief advice 25 %). Few <b>clients</b> <b>reported</b> being offered a referral (< 10 %). Assessment of physical activity and brief advice for all behaviors was higher for clients residing in rural/remote areas. Conclusion: Assessment and brief advice were provided {{to the majority of}} clients for smoking, but sub-optimally for the other behaviors.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} whether counselor personality characteristics as measured by the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory, (MMPI), influence the extent of <b>client</b> <b>reported</b> satisfaction in the cognitive and affective spheres of the counseling process as measured by the Inventory of Fulfillment of Client Expectancy, (IFCE). The objective of the study was to determine whether the MMPI has adequate discriminatory power to estimate potential counselor effectiveness based on some knowledge of counselor personality features. The underlying question which prompted this study was as follows: What personality characteristics distinguish between counselors who tend to facilitate <b>client</b> <b>reported</b> satisfaction and counselors who tend to achieve less <b>client</b> <b>reported</b> satisfaction in the cognitive and affective spheres of the counseling process?The method whereby this question was investigated included (1) obtaining MMPI profiles from 54 counselors (26 males, 28 females), and (2) acquiring IFCE satisfaction ratings from 173 volunteer clients (63 males, 110 females) who had received therapy from the participating counselors. The data were collected during the Spring quarter, 1974. The counselors in the five groups acquired a near equal combined composite mean score on the counselee reported satisfaction inventory in the cognitive and affective spheres of the counseling process. Consequently, discrimination between groups of counselors on the basis of counselee ratings was impossible. The statistical treatment of the data to determine the relationship between counselor personality features and <b>client</b> <b>reported</b> satisfaction included the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient (r) and the multiple correlation (R). The necessary value of r for significance at the. 05 level of confidence was. 27, and the necessary value of R for significance at the. 05 level was an F ratio of 4. 03. The mean score for each of the 24 individual MMPI scales was subjected to exploratory correlation with the mean score for all the cognitive, affective, and composite items reported in the IFCE. An obtained r of. 91 between cognitive and affective items resulted in the use of the composite <b>client</b> <b>reported</b> satisfaction ratings for determining correlation significance. The outcomes contained only minimal evidence of any significant relationship between the MMPI and the IFCE. The obtained correlations of significance between the MMPI scale scores and the IFCE composite scores included the ~ scale at. 34 (representative of dependency needs within the personality) and the Re scale at -. 30 (descriptive of assuming obligations and being dependable and trustworthy). Scale K approached significance with an r of -. 25 (purportedly indicative of self-assurance). Multiple regression analysis based on combinations of MMPI scale scores was used for purposes of improving efficiency or accuracy of predicting IFCE composite ratings. The relationship between the Dy scale and IFCE composite ratings accounted for most of the variance in evidence between the two instruments. Two plausible conclusions based on the outcomes of this study with respect to counselor effectiveness may be possible assuming that the significance obtained on the Dy and Re scales, and the near significance on the K scale were not a chance difference. The combined composite mean score on the counselee rating inventory for both male and female counselors was considered relatively high at 3. 99 on a five point Likert scale. The significant positive correlation obtained on the Dy scale in which the mean T score was considerablylow for both male and female counselors in the study tentatively suggests that as dependency needs within the personality structure of the counselor increase <b>client</b> <b>reported</b> satisfaction ratings will also increase and vice versa. The significant correlation between the Dy scale and composite IFCE ratings does not represent a wide span, however, as evidenced by the relatively high composite IFCE ratings and the considerably low mean T score on the Dy scale. The significant negative correlation obtained on the Re scale in which the mean T score was slightly elevated and a near significant negative correlation on the K scale in which the mean T score was considered high for both male and female counselors in the study tentatively implies that too ideal a model of personality adjustment on the part of the counselor with respect to handling social obligations or responsibilities, and demonstrating self-assurance within the therapy setting may possibly hinder <b>client</b> <b>reported</b> satisfaction within the counseling process. The MMPI profile findings of the counselor population were quite consistent with the outcomes reported in previous studies. Thus, the counselors participating in this study were considered to be in close approximation to counselors in previous reported research. Thesis (D. Ed. ...|$|R
