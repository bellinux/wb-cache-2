5|$|On December 7, 1959, the I-94/US12 freeway {{opened on}} the south side of Kalamazoo. When US12 was shifted to follow the new freeway, the former route through {{downtown}} Kalamazoo was redesignated Business US Highway12 (Bus. US12). The next year, it was renumbered BL I-94. In 1963, the US131 freeway {{opened on the}} west side of Kalamazoo. Along with the creation of Bus. US131 along a portion of the BL I-94 routing, BL I-94 was rerouted along the US131 freeway on the west <b>end</b> <b>back</b> to I-94. The section of Stadium Drive west of US131 and the 9th Street routing was removed from BL I-94. Kalamazoo and the newly built Michikal avenues were transferred to state jurisdiction in 1965. Since then, Kalamazoo and Michigan avenues have been used as a pair of one-way streets downtown. Kalamazoo and Michikal were then signed as westbound BL I-94 from Stadium Drive to Michigan Avenue while Main Street and Michigan Avenue continued to serve eastbound traffic.|$|E
25|$|The Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956 {{introduced}} the Interstate Highway System to the United States {{and the plan}} called for a highway along the eastern bank of the Missouri River along and parallel to the existing US75 corridor. Construction {{began in the late}} 1950s near Sioux City and Council Bluffs on what would become the Interstate 29 corridor in Iowa. As portions of the new interstate were completed the US75 designation was moved off its two-lane highway onto the Interstate. In 1984, proposals to AASHTO by the Nebraska Department of Roads recommended truncating the designation of US73 on its northern <b>end</b> <b>back</b> to Dawson. At the same time, the Iowa Department of Transportation, jointly with NDOR, suggested removing the US75 designation from the I-29 corridor in Iowa and assigning it to the former US73 route north of Dawson in Nebraska. The changes were approved during the May 23, 1984 meeting and the transfer was made official on December 5, 1984.|$|E

500|$|... "A Totally Fun Thing That Bart Will Never Do Again" [...] is the 19th {{episode of}} the 23rd season of the American {{animated}} television sitcom The Simpsons. It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on April 29, 2012. In the episode, the Simpson family goes on cruise after being convinced by a bored Bart. He enjoys himself on the vacation until Rowan Priddis, {{the director of the}} cruise, performs a song called [...] "Enjoy It While You Can" [...] that makes him realize the cruise is soon to be over and he has to return to his boring life. Bart decides to trick the crew and the passengers on the ship that the world is coming to an <b>end</b> <b>back</b> on land because of a pandemic and that the ship therefore has to stay out at sea. He manages to do this {{with the help of a}} large television screen, on which he displays a scene from the film The Pandora Strain that features a general officer named William Sullivan warning humanity about a deadly virus.|$|E

The front <b>end</b> and <b>back</b> <b>end</b> parameters are jointly trained using the Rprop algorithm against a maximum mutual information (MMI) objective function.

2500|$|Lobelia (Bracegirdle) Sackville-Baggins: (2918–3020) The {{daughter}} of Blanco Bracegirdle and Primrose Boffin (a distant relation of Bilbo Baggins). She married Otho Sackville-Baggins (Bilbo's cousin) {{and had an}} only child, Lotho (b. 2964). Portrayed as unpleasant and grasping, Lobelia was {{from an early age}} an active adherent of the Sackville-Bagginses' ambition to acquire the manor smial of Bag End and its contents. Their first attempt had been made in 2942, when Bilbo was absent on the Quest of Erebor, and presumed dead. At that time Lobelia was not yet married into the Sackville-Bagginses [...] (she was 24, too young for a Hobbit to wed). Nonetheless she seems to {{have been involved in the}} disappearance of Bilbo's silverware, discovered by Bilbo on his unexpected return. Many years later Bilbo invited Lobelia to his Farewell Party (indeed she and her family were among his 144 special guests), but he gave Lobelia a box of silver spoons labelled [...] "For Lobelia, from Cousin Bilbo, as a present." [...] After a further 17 years, in which time her husband Otho died, Lobelia finally obtained Bag End when Frodo sold it to her (either for a great profit or below fair market value - accounts vary), as he was in a rush to leave the Shire with the One Ring. A shift in Lobelia's character occurs when Frodo is away on his quest. Lobelia opposed Saruman's ruffians, verbally and physically, and was imprisoned in the Lockholes of Michel Delving for her actions. This feat earned her popularity among the Shire-folk for the first time in her life. Freed after the Scouring of the Shire but greatly weakened, Lobelia deeded Bag <b>End</b> <b>back</b> to Frodo, ending the generation-long feud between Bilbo and Frodo and the Sackville-Bagginses. Devastated by her son Lotho's murder, Lobelia moved back with her original family, the Bracegirdles of Hardbottle. She died in 3020, and was over 100 years old. [...] She bequeathed what remained of her money to helping hobbits made homeless during Saruman's regime.|$|E

60|$|And {{then the}} river current caught us. So wildly were we {{paddling}} that Red-Eye {{was the first}} to notice it, and our first warning was his yell of triumph. Where the edge of the current struck the slough-water was a series of eddies or small whirlpools. These caught our clumsy logs and whirled them end for <b>end,</b> <b>back</b> and forth and around. We quit paddling and devoted our whole energy to holding the logs together alongside each other. In the meanwhile Red-Eye continued to bombard us, the rock fragments falling about us, splashing water on us, and menacing our lives. At the same time he gloated over us, wildly and vociferously.|$|E
6000|$|Joshua Slocum sailed {{around the}} world {{a few years ago}} in a thirty- seven-foot boat all by himself. I shall never forget, in his {{narrative}} of the voyage, where he heartily indorsed the idea of young men, in similar small boats, making similar voyage. I promptly indorsed his idea, and so heartily that I took my wife along. While it certainly makes a Cook's tour look like thirty cents, on top of that, amid on top of the fun and pleasure, it is a splendid education for a young man--oh, not a mere education in the things of the world outside, of lands, and peoples, and climates, but an education in the world inside, an education in one's self, a chance to learn one's own self, to get on speaking terms with one's soul. Then there is the training and the disciplining of it. First, naturally, the young fellow will learn his limitations; and next, inevitably, he will proceed to press back those limitations. And he cannot escape returning from such a voyage a bigger and better man.

I may not fly to other stars, but of this star I myself am master." ...|$|E

The man stands up the horses {{on each side of the}} thing that projects from the front end of the wagon, and then throws the tangled mess of gear forward through a ring, and hauls it aft, and passes the other thing through the other ring and hauls it aft on the other side of the other horse, opposite to the first one, after crossing them and bringing the loose <b>end</b> <b>back,</b> and then buckles the other thing underneath the horse, and takes another thing and wraps it around the thing I spoke of before, and puts another thing over each horse's head, with broad flappers to it to keep the dust out of his eyes, and puts the iron thing in his mouth for him to grit his teeth on, uphill, and brings the ends of these things aft over his back, after buckling another one around under his neck to hold his head up, and hitching another thing on a thing that goes over his shoulders to keep his head up when he is climbing a hill, and then takes the slack of the thing which I mentioned a while ago, and fetches it aft and makes it fast to the thing that pulls the wagon, and hands the other things up to the driver to steer with. I never have buckled up a horse myself, but I do not think we do it that way.|$|E
