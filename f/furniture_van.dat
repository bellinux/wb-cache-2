60|$|James Williams belonged {{among the}} level heads. With {{necessary}} slowness he picked {{his way through}} the passengers down to the steps {{at the front of the}} car. His wife followed, but she first turned her eyes and saw the escaped tourist glide from behind the <b>furniture</b> <b>van</b> and slip behind a tree on the edge of the little park, not fifty feet away.|$|E
60|$|It {{was such}} a languorous {{afternoon}} in January that a <b>furniture</b> <b>van,</b> accompanied by certain nondescript persons known as United States Police, pulled up at the curb in front of Mr. Carvel's house. Eugenie, watching at the window across the street, ran to tell her father, who came out on his steps and reviled the van with all the fluency of his French ancestors.|$|E
50|$|The {{contest between}} King's and UCL reached new levels in December 1922 when King's {{captured}} Phineas from his usual residence in Tottenham Court Road. When King's ignored an ultimatum demanding his return, hundreds of UCL students, transported in <b>furniture</b> <b>vans</b> from Bloomsbury or arriving at Aldwych tube station, stormed the King's quad.|$|R

5000|$|Mess {{loved her}} 1941 Buick [...] - [...] she kept it {{well into the}} 1960s. One summer she and I bought a flock of {{antiques}} in New Hampshire [...] - [...] so many {{that we had to}} buy an old trailer to get them to Bucks county. On the road down we were stopped twice by troopers and at every toll booth. [...] "No trailers allowed, lady!" [...] Each time she'd bat her eyes and smile, [...] "But sir, this isn't a trailer [...] - [...] it's a furniture van."Either the rules didn't mention <b>furniture</b> <b>vans</b> or her smile was irresistible, because we made it to the farm by 3:00 a.m.|$|R
60|$|But {{within that}} minute a crosstown car had stopped {{directly}} in front of the cab. The cabman tried to pass to the left, but a heavy express wagon cut him off. He tried the right, and had to back away from a <b>furniture</b> <b>van</b> that had no business to be there. He tried to back out, but dropped his reins and swore dutifully. He was blockaded in a tangled mess of vehicles and horses.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hallo! Plenty of draught now," [...] yelled {{the second}} {{engineer}} at once, {{as though he}} had been all the time looking out for Jukes. The donkeyman, a dapper little chap with a dazzling fair skin and a tiny, gingery moustache, worked in a sort of mute transport. They were keeping a full head of steam, and a profound rumbling, as of an empty <b>furniture</b> <b>van</b> trotting over a bridge, made a sustained bass to all the other noises of the place.|$|E
60|$|The {{girl in the}} {{fruitful}} hat quickly seized {{her companion}} {{by the arm and}} whispered in his ear. That young man exhibited proof of ability to act promptly. Crouching low, he slid {{over the edge of the}} car, hung lightly for an instant, and then disappeared. Half a dozen of the top-riders observed his feat, wonderingly, but made no comment, deeming it prudent not to express surprise at what might be the conventional manner of alighting in this bewildering city. The truant passenger dodged a hansom and then floated past, like a leaf on a stream between a <b>furniture</b> <b>van</b> and a florist's delivery wagon.|$|E

5000|$|The one {{attempt at}} the mass {{deportation}} of Belgian Jews, attempted on 3 September 1943, proved a failure. After Wehrmacht raids, hundreds of Antwerp Jews {{were taken in}} <b>furniture</b> <b>vans</b> from their homes to Mechelen transit camp. Soon afterwards, Reeder ordered their release at the direct request of Queen Elisabeth of Bavaria and Cardinal Jozef-Ernest van Roey, and the attempt was not repeated. It was hence reported as [...] "impossible" [...] by local SS units charged with meeting Final Solution targets to find enough stateless and foreign Jews to fill another Auschwitz transport after 20 September 1943, though 1,800 Jews of various privileged categories were taken in 1944 to camps including Theresienstadt and Bergen-Belsen.|$|R
5000|$|Nicholas Treadwell {{was born}} in the United Kingdom. In 1963, he toured England with a {{double-decker}} bus and two <b>furniture</b> <b>vans</b> as mobile galleries, as [...] "Nicholas Treadwells Mobile Art Gallery", based in Croydon.In 1968, he established the Nicholas Treadwell Gallery at 36 Chiltern Street, in the West End of London, and lived in one of the rooms in the basement. Against the contemporary trend of Hard-edge abstraction and Minimalism, the gallery focused on [...] "the basic nature of the human condition", and quickly gained a controversial reputation. In 1971, Art and Artist magazine said of one show: [...] "The place blisters with work of searing eroticism, high camp, coarse belly laughs and hideous vulgarity".|$|R
6000|$|But he did {{not give}} way to despair. He was a true hero, else {{we would not have}} had {{anything}} to write about him. Suddenly he slowed, frowned, compressed his lips, described a complete circle--in spite of a <b>furniture</b> <b>van</b> that came in his way--and deliberately went back to the spot where the accident had occurred; but there was no little lady to be seen. She had been conveyed away, the policeman was gone, the little boys were gone, the ragged girl, sweep, postman, and servant maid--all were gone, [...] "like the baseless fabric of a vision," [...] leaving only new faces and strangers behind to wonder what accident and thin old lady the excited youth was asking about--so evanescent are the incidents that occur; and so busily pre-occupied are the human torrents that rush in the streets of London! ...|$|E
60|$|It is {{the first}} of April--a white spring day of gleams and driving showers. The street door of WELLWYN's studio stands wide open, and, past it, in the street, the wind is {{whirling}} bits of straw and paper bags. Through the door can be seen the butt end of a stationary <b>furniture</b> <b>van</b> with its flap let down. To this van three humble-men in shirt sleeves and aprons, are carrying out the contents of the studio. The hissing samovar, the tea-pot, the sugar, and the nearly empty decanter of rum stand on the low round table in the fast-being-gutted room. WELLWYN in his ulster and soft hat, is squatting on the little stool in front of the blazing fire, staring into it, and smoking a hand-made cigarette. He has a moulting air. Behind him the humble-men pass, embracing busts and other articles of vertu.|$|E
60|$|The cavalcade {{passed out}} by the lower gate of Phoenix park saluted by obsequious policemen and {{proceeded}} past Kingsbridge along the northern quays. The viceroy was most cordially greeted on {{his way through the}} metropolis. At Bloody bridge Mr Thomas Kernan beyond the river greeted him vainly from afar Between Queen's and Whitworth bridges lord Dudley's viceregal carriages passed and were unsaluted by Mr Dudley White, B. L., M. A., who stood on Arran quay outside Mrs M. E. White's, the pawnbroker's, at the corner of Arran street west stroking his nose with his forefinger, undecided whether he should arrive at Phibsborough more quickly by a triple change of tram or by hailing a car or on foot through Smithfield, Constitution hill and Broadstone terminus. In the porch of Four Courts Richie Goulding with the costbag of Goulding, Collis and Ward saw him with surprise. Past Richmond bridge at the doorstep of the office of Reuben J Dodd, solicitor, agent for the Patriotic Insurance Company, an elderly female about to enter changed her plan and retracing her steps by King's windows smiled credulously on the representative of His Majesty. From its sluice in Wood quay wall under Tom Devan's office Poddle river hung out in fealty a tongue of liquid sewage. Above the crossblind of the Ormond hotel, gold by bronze, Miss Kennedy's head by Miss Douce's head watched and admired. On Ormond quay Mr Simon Dedalus, steering his way from the greenhouse for the subsheriff's office, stood still in midstreet and brought his hat low. His Excellency graciously returned Mr Dedalus' greeting. From Cahill's corner the reverend Hugh C. Love, M.A., made obeisance unperceived, mindful of lords deputies whose hands benignant had held of yore rich advowsons. On Grattan bridge Lenehan and M'Coy, taking leave of each other, watched the carriages go by. Passing by Roger Greene's office and Dollard's big red printinghouse Gerty MacDowell, carrying the Catesby's cork lino letters for her father who was laid up, knew by the style it was the lord and lady lieutenant but she couldn't see what Her Excellency had on because the tram and Spring's big yellow <b>furniture</b> <b>van</b> had to stop in front of her on account of its being the lord lieutenant. Beyond Lundy Foot's from the shaded door of Kavanagh's winerooms John Wyse Nolan smiled with unseen coldness towards the lord lieutenantgeneral and general governor of Ireland. The Right Honourable William Humble, earl of Dudley, G. C. V. O., passed Micky Anderson's all times ticking watches and Henry and James's wax smartsuited freshcheeked models, the gentleman Henry, dernier cri James. Over against Dame gate Tom Rochford and Nosey Flynn watched the approach of the cavalcade. Tom Rochford, seeing the eyes of lady Dudley fixed on him, took his thumbs quickly out of the pockets of his claret waistcoat and doffed his cap to her. A charming soubrette, great Marie Kendall, with dauby cheeks and lifted skirt smiled daubily from her poster upon William Humble, earl of Dudley, and upon lieutenantcolonel H. G. Heseltine, and also upon the honourable Gerald Ward A. D. C. From the window of the D. B. C. Buck Mulligan gaily, and Haines gravely, gazed down on the viceregal equipage over the shoulders of eager guests, whose mass of forms darkened the chessboard whereon John Howard Parnell looked intently. In Fownes's street Dilly Dedalus, straining her sight upward from Chardenal's first French primer, saw sunshades spanned and wheelspokes spinning in the glare. John Henry Menton, filling the doorway of Commercial Buildings, stared from winebig oyster eyes, holding a fat gold hunter watch not looked at in his fat left hand not feeling it. Where the foreleg of King Billy's horse pawed the air Mrs Breen plucked her hastening husband back from under the hoofs of the outriders. She shouted in his ear the tidings. Understanding, he shifted his tomes to his left breast and saluted the second carriage. The honourable Gerald Ward A.D.C., agreeably surprised, made haste to reply. At Ponsonby's corner a jaded white flagon H. halted and four tallhatted white flagons halted behind him, E.L.Y'S, while outriders pranced past and carriages. Opposite Pigott's music warerooms Mr Denis J Maginni, professor of dancing &c, gaily apparelled, gravely walked, outpassed by a viceroy and unobserved. By the provost's wall came jauntily Blazes Boylan, stepping in tan shoes and socks with skyblue clocks to the refrain of My girl's a Yorkshire girl.|$|E
60|$|But {{she did not}} {{lift her}} voice at dinner, which was very poor indeed for Colonel Carvel's house. All day long Virginia, {{assisted}} by Uncle Ben and Aunt Easter, toiled in the stifling kitchen, preparing dainties which she had long denied herself. At evening {{she went to the}} station at Fourteenth Street with her father, and stood amongst the people, pressed back by the soldiers, until the trains came in. Alas, the heavy basket which the Colonel carried on his arm was brought home again. The first hundred to arrive, ten hours in a hot car without food or water, were laid groaning on the bottom of great <b>furniture</b> <b>vans,</b> and carted to the new House of Refuge Hospital, two miles to the south of the city.|$|R
