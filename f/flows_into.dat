5|$|The next tributaries of Catawissa Creek going {{downstream}} are Dark Run and Little Catawissa Creek. Dark Run {{is close}} to four miles long and <b>flows</b> <b>into</b> Catawissa Creek from the southwest. Little Catawissa Creek is approximately ten miles long and <b>flows</b> <b>into</b> Catawissa Creek from the west, {{less than a mile}} downstream from Dark Run. Little Catawissa Creek starts near Centralia and passes by Ringtown.|$|E
5|$|The southwestern {{corner of}} Gyeongju, {{on the far}} side of the Taebaek range, drains into the Geumho River, which then <b>flows</b> <b>into</b> the Nakdong. A small area of the south, just west of the Dongdae range, drains into the Taehwa River, which <b>flows</b> <b>into</b> the Bay of Ulsan.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to Klingerman's Run, Fisher Run and Furnace Run flow down Catawissa Mountain to Catawissa Creek. Scotch Run <b>flows</b> <b>into</b> the creek from the east.|$|E
50|$|The Rio Grande which before capture <b>flowed</b> <b>into</b> {{a closed}} basin, Lake Cabeza de Vaca, but after capture <b>flowed</b> <b>into</b> the Gulf of Mexico.|$|R
50|$|In 2014 {{there was}} a report of fecal {{coliform}} <b>flowing</b> <b>into</b> the lake from a Beaconsfield creek, and of PCBs <b>flowing</b> <b>into</b> it from a Pointe-Claire industrial site.|$|R
50|$|San Gorgonio Mountain {{sits on the}} Great Basin Divide, which {{separates}} steams that <b>flow</b> <b>into</b> the basins of the Basin and Range Province from {{rivers that}} <b>flow</b> <b>into</b> the Pacific Ocean.|$|R
5|$|The gorge, {{which helped}} protect Bristol Harbour, has been quarried for stone {{to build the}} city, and its {{surrounding}} land has been protected from development as The Downs and Leigh Woods. The Avon estuary and the gorge are the county boundary with North Somerset, and the river <b>flows</b> <b>into</b> the Severn Estuary at Avonmouth. Another gorge, cut by the Hazel Brook (which <b>flows</b> <b>into</b> the River Trym), crosses the Blaise Castle estate in northern Bristol.|$|E
5|$|Two major rivers, one minor {{river and}} several small streams empty into the harbour. West River <b>flows</b> <b>into</b> the Northwest Arm, and East River empties into the Northeast Arm.|$|E
5|$|After {{drawing out}} the Rus armies for nine {{days in a}} feigned retreat, the Mongol army turned to face their pursuers along the Kalka River (the river's {{location}} is currently unknown, but it {{is thought to be}} the Kalchik River which <b>flows</b> <b>into</b> the Sea of Azov).* Gabriel, Subotai The Valiant: Genghis Khan's Greatest General p. 99.|$|E
50|$|Rivers radiate {{outwards}} to all sides. Clockwise from windward to leeward, {{the major}} watersheds are: Wynoochee, Humptulips, Quinault, Queets, Hoh, Bogachiel (all <b>flowing</b> <b>into</b> the Pacific; the Wynoochee {{by way of}} the Chehalis River, and the Humptulips by way of Grays Harbor), Lyre, Elwha, Dungeness (all <b>flowing</b> <b>into</b> the Strait of Juan de Fuca), Big Quilcene, Dosewallips, Duckabush, Hamma Hamma, and Skokomish (all <b>flowing</b> <b>into</b> Hood Canal).|$|R
50|$|In a {{differential}} scanning calorimeter (DSC), heat <b>flow</b> <b>into</b> a sample—usually {{contained in}} a small aluminium capsule or 'pan'—is measured differentially, i.e., by comparing it to the <b>flow</b> <b>into</b> an empty reference pan.|$|R
50|$|Mount French is a {{watershed}} with the creeks flowing {{west of the}} mountain ultimately <b>flowing</b> <b>into</b> the Bremer River, while the creeks flowing east of the mountain ultimately <b>flow</b> <b>into</b> the Logan River.|$|R
5|$|At an {{altitude}} of , Chard {{is one of the}} highest towns in Somerset, and is also the southernmost. The suburbs include: Crimchard, Furnham, Glynswood, Henson Park and Old Town. Local folklore claims that the town has a very unusual and unique feature, a stream running along either side of Fore Street. One stream eventually <b>flows</b> <b>into</b> the Bristol Channel and the other reaches the English Channel. This situation changed when the tributary of the Axe was diverted into the Isle; the gutter in Holyrood Street, though, still <b>flows</b> <b>into</b> the River Axe and therefore it is still true it lies on the watershed and that two gutters within the down eventually drain into the Bristol Channel and the English Channel.|$|E
5|$|Catawissa Creek {{starts in}} Luzerne County, {{not far from}} Hazleton. It flows west and {{slightly}} south into Schuylkill County before flowing north into Columbia County and then west to the Susquehanna River, which it <b>flows</b> <b>into</b> at Catawissa. It parallels Catawissa Mountain for {{a significant portion of}} its course.|$|E
5|$|Early on May 18, an {{earthquake}} measuring 5.1 on the Richter scale struck the region, creating a massive landslide—- of rock that released {{pressure on the}} volcano's crater, causing an ejection of steam. Just seconds later, Mount St. Helens erupted laterally, sending supersonic pyroclastic <b>flows</b> <b>into</b> the forest below.|$|E
50|$|Lee Vining Creek is a 16.2 mi {{stream in}} Mono County, California, <b>flowing</b> <b>into</b> the endorheic basin of Mono Lake. It {{is the second}} largest stream <b>flowing</b> <b>into</b> the lake, after Rush Creek.|$|R
50|$|Consider {{two-dimensional}} {{plane flow}} within a Cartesian coordinate system. Continuity states {{that if we}} consider incompressible <b>flow</b> <b>into</b> an elemental square, the <b>flow</b> <b>into</b> that small element must equal the flow out of that element.|$|R
40|$|Initiating {{combustion}} of {{altitude control}} rocket engines in a precombustion chamber of ductile material reduces high pressure surges generated by hypergolic propellants. Two-step bipropellant valve concepts control initial propellant <b>flow</b> <b>into</b> precombustion chamber and subsequent full <b>flow</b> <b>into</b> main chamber...|$|R
5|$|East River, {{formally}} East River Sheet Harbour, is {{the other}} main river that discharges into Sheet Harbour. It flows through the Marshall Flowage, a large flowage, then past the Ruth Falls Power Plant, a hydropower generating station. It narrows back into a river for a short while, then <b>flows</b> <b>into</b> {{the head of the}} Northeast Arm.|$|E
5|$|It then flows past a small {{mountain}} on the north, {{known as}} Kite Hill, and is diverted {{into a large}} culvert underneath Alicia Parkway that drains it to a small canyon. The creek then <b>flows</b> <b>into</b> Aliso Creek, just outside the boundary of Aliso and Wood Canyons Regional Park.|$|E
5|$|Streams on {{the west}} side drain {{directly}} into Thirlmere, apart from Helvellyn Gill which <b>flows</b> <b>into</b> a parallel valley to the east of Great How and empties into St John's Beck. However, when Thirlmere reservoir was built, a leat was constructed to capture the water of Helvellyn Gill, so that it is now directed into the reservoir.|$|E
50|$|The county {{straddles}} the Tennessee Valley Divide, with waters {{east of the}} divide <b>flowing</b> <b>into</b> the Tennessee River, and waters west of the divide <b>flowing</b> <b>into</b> the Mississippi River. Primary streams include the Beech River and the Forked Deer River.|$|R
50|$|<b>Flowing</b> <b>into</b> the far horizon.|$|R
50|$|The Columbia Bottom is a {{floodplain}} in {{the northeast}} of the county at {{the confluence of the}} Mississippi and Missouri rivers; this is preserved as a conservation area open to the public. The Missouri Bottom area between the two other floodplains had been developed for agriculture, but it is being increasingly developed for residential, business and industry. The River des Peres drains the interior of county before <b>flowing</b> <b>into</b> constructed underground channels into the City of St. Louis. It was allowed to resurface, where it forms the boundary between southern portions of St. Louis City and St. Louis County. Other streams include Coldwater Creek, Bonhomme Creek, and Creve Coeur Creek, <b>flowing</b> <b>into</b> the Missouri River; Keifer Creek, Fishpot Creek, and Grand Glaize Creek, <b>flowing</b> <b>into</b> the Meramec River; Deer Creek and Gravois Creek, <b>flowing</b> <b>into</b> the River des Peres; and Maline Creek, <b>flowing</b> <b>into</b> the Mississippi River. The highest elevation is 904 feet/275 meters.|$|R
5|$|The main valleys {{between the}} hills {{are filled with}} {{alluvial}} deposits from the hills or sea. The county has many small rivers, most of which flow into the Bristol Channel. Many of the latter rivers now have clysts (the local name for a sluice) on them to control the sea, but formerly they were tidal for some way inland. The main exception to this is the River Parrett, which still has a tidal bore. However the Chew and the Frome flow into the Avon which forms most of the northern county boundary with Gloucestershire. The Cale <b>flows</b> <b>into</b> Dorset through the Blackmore Vale, while the Exe <b>flows</b> <b>into</b> Devon. The (Dorset) Axe, the Culm and the Otter rise in Somerset but flow into Dorset.|$|E
5|$|The {{northwest}} corner of the peninsula, where the San Diego River <b>flows</b> <b>into</b> the ocean, is a separate community known as Ocean Beach. The southern one-third of the Point Loma Peninsula is entirely federal land, including Naval Base Point Loma, Fort Rosecrans National Cemetery, and Cabrillo National Monument.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in North Bay near Lake Nipissing, {{the source}} of the French River which flows down to Georgian Bay, Highway63 travels east through suburbs. It exits the city and travels along the {{northern}} shores of Trout Lake, which serves as the headwaters of the Mattawa River, which <b>flows</b> <b>into</b> the Ottawa River and eventually the St. Lawrence River. The portion of Highway63 west of Trout Lake travels between these water systems.|$|E
50|$|At {{one time}} the winged mapleleaf {{could be found in}} {{thirteen}} states. It lived in nearly all the rivers and streams that <b>flow</b> <b>into</b> the Mississippi River. It was once also found in some rivers and streams that <b>flow</b> <b>into</b> the Missouri River.|$|R
50|$|As {{the primary}} inflow of Wollaston Lake (the largest natural {{bifurcation}} {{lake in the}} world) the Geikie River's most unusual feature is that it straddles a major drainage divide which separates waters <b>flowing</b> <b>into</b> Hudson Bay from those <b>flowing</b> <b>into</b> the Arctic Ocean.|$|R
50|$|Rivers of the Ljuta, the Jesenica, the Bjelimićka Rijeka, the Slatinica, the Račica, the Rakitnica <b>flow</b> <b>into</b> the Neretva {{from the}} right, while the Živašnica (also Živanjski Potok), the Ladjanica, the Župski Krupac, the Bukovica, the Šištica <b>flow</b> <b>into</b> {{it from the}} left.|$|R
5|$|Burnham-on-Sea {{is notable}} for its beach and mudflats, the danger they pose to {{individuals}} and shipping, and the efforts to which locals have gone in defending their town and preventing loss of life. Burnham {{is close to the}} estuary of the River Parrett where it <b>flows</b> <b>into</b> the Bristol Channel, which has the second highest tidal range in the world. At , it is second only to the Bay of Fundy in Eastern Canada.|$|E
5|$|Continuing north, {{the roadway}} enters the {{community}} of Helmer where it meets a junction with the eastern terminus of the eastern H-44 (CR98, Ten Curves Road) near North Manistique Lake. The roadway also crosses Locke Creek, which <b>flows</b> <b>into</b> that lake. After H-33 leaves Helmer, it continues northward to a junction with North Road Lake Road (CR438) and Sampsell Road (CR417). Manistique Lakes Road turns to the east, replacing North Round Lake Road, and H-33 follows suit. The road continues to a junction with M-28 just south of McMillan near East Lake. There H-33 terminates near farms and several small business.|$|E
5|$|Elephant ears have thick bases {{with thin}} tips. The ear flaps, or pinnae, contain {{numerous}} blood vessels called capillaries. Warm blood <b>flows</b> <b>into</b> the capillaries, helping to release excess body heat into the environment. This {{occurs when the}} pinnae are still, and the animal can enhance the effect by flapping them. Larger ear surfaces contain more capillaries, and more heat can be released. Of all the elephants, African bush elephants live in the hottest climates, and have the largest ear flaps. Elephants are capable of hearing at low frequencies and are most sensitive at 1 kHz.|$|E
5000|$|In 2012, Springston {{dairy farm}} company, White Gold Ltd, was fined a record $90,000 after {{illegally}} discharging 45,000 litres of diluted dairy effluent over a three-day period in 2010. The public reported the dairy effluent <b>flowing</b> <b>into</b> waterways that <b>flowed</b> <b>into</b> Lake Ellesmere.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} Shing Mun River {{began at}} Needle Hill, and <b>flowed</b> <b>into</b> the former Tide Cove (Sha Tin Hoi), a shallow bay. In the 1970s, Tide Cove was reclaimed {{and turned to}} Sha Tin New Town. The river was extended through a 7 km long, 200 m wide artificial channel {{in the middle of}} the area to <b>flow</b> <b>into</b> Tolo Harbour. Other rivers that had originally <b>flowed</b> <b>into</b> Tide Cove are now tributaries of Shing Mun River in the form of concreted nullahs.|$|R
50|$|Rivers which {{start on}} Mount Kenya are the tributaries of two large Kenyan rivers: the Tana and the Ewaso Ng'iro rivers. A lot of Mount Kenyan rivers <b>flow</b> <b>into</b> the Sagana which {{itself is a}} {{tributary}} of the Tana, which it joins at the Masinga Reservoir. The rivers {{in the northern part of}} the mountain, such as the Burguret, Naru Moru, Nanyuki, Liki, Sirimon <b>flow</b> <b>into</b> the Ewaso Ng'iro. The rivers to the south-west, such as the Keringa and Nairobi <b>flow</b> <b>into</b> the Sagana and then into the Tana. The remaining rivers to the south and east, such as the Mutonga, Nithi, Thuchi and Nyamindi, <b>flow</b> directly <b>into</b> the Tana.|$|R
