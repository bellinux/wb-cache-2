40|$|Facilitation, as an art, is at one and {{the same}} time freeing and terrifying. Facilitation has {{replaced}} teaching as the primary concept in student- instructor interaction. The movement from paternalistic classroom instruction to learner directed activities removes the inhuman expectation that the teacher has to make something out of the student, that the teacher must carry the burden of student achievement, that the trainer has to force the class “to get it”, that the educator’s self esteem is attached to student performance, and that the instructor must anticipate all classroom pitfalls with expert responses of seamless ease. Yes, facilitation is quite freeing as <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> of relief. Yet I cringe, poised for self critical condemnation. Aren’t adults, especially teachers, supposed to know what they are doing? Suppose someone sees me make a mistake, or hesitate, or reveal that I don’t know all the answers? God forbid that a student might notice. How can I give up the ideal of being an expert and give up, forever, the fantasy that someday I will no longer live in doubt, confusion, ambiguity, discomfort, and shame? And what about my own ultimate salvation? Yea, maybe I can live with not knowing exactly what I’m doing with students but isn’t someone going to tell me what the truth is? Do I have to also give up hope that someone will save me and tell m...|$|E
40|$|Approaches {{to family}} therapy and {{counseling}} are influenced {{not only by}} client needs and presenting complaints {{but also by the}} clini-cian’s theoretical orientation and personal experiences. This article explores the reciprocal influence that takes place between family therapists, their families of origin, and the families they treat. The relative influence of these dimensions are explored from a systems theoretical perspective. First there is a startling thump, then a scream, and finallyan ominous silence. I (Jeffrey) look at the client sitting in my office, and she stares back at me forcefully as if to say, “Hey, this is your office. You go check out what happened. ” Not wanting to appear timid and indecisive in front of this new client, <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> and slowly make my way to the waiting room where I see an elderly couple, newly referred by a physician, in mortal combat. They are actually wrestling on my couch! The woman then stands over the frail-looking gentleman, clearly of superior physical strength, and proceeds to wag her finger in his face as she taunts him. He ineffectually tries to defend himself, finally hurling some accusation at her that long ago had been tested under similar conditions. His attack strikes its mark, for this dignified-looking, proper woman cries out in anguish and then proceeds to wail at him with her fist. On seeing me, the man and woman calmly composed themselves, rearranged their own (and each others’!) clothing, and then politely intro-duced themselves as the new couple I would be working with. This couple and I were to spend many hours together dur-ing the coming months. Never could I have imagined the mutual effects we would have on one another. Naturally, I fully expected to affect them in a significant way by helping them stop their cycle of physical violence, but little did I real-ize {{the extent to which they}} would trigger my own fam-ily-of-origin issues or influence my own family relationships in the present. I had no idea that the abuse/violence I had wit-nessed in my personal life would help me with this couple as much as anything I had learned in graduate school...|$|E

For each year, most species show a consistent right-skewed pattern of distribution, suggesting that selection is stronger against individuals that arrive too early compared to those that arrive later. Distributions are consistently leptokurtic, indicating a narrow window of optimal arrival dates. Species that arrive earlier in the spring show higher skewness and kurtosis values. Nectarivorous species showed more pronounced skewness. Wintering area did not explain patterns of skewness or kurtosis. Deviations from average temperatures and the North Atlantic Oscillation index explained little variation in skewness and kurtosis. When arrival date distributions are broken down into different medians (e. g., 5 % median and 75 % median), stronger correlations emerge for portions of the distribution that are adjacent, suggesting species fine-tune the progress of their migration. Interspecific correlations for birds arriving around the same time are stronger for earliest migrants (the 25 % median) compared to the true median and the 75 % median...|$|R

40|$|This study {{establishes}} {{a more nuanced}} look at fictional teenage girls of the 1940 s. With the beginning of World War II many teenage girls took on jobs that were left vacant by men. With these new jobs came the opportunity to gain financial independence. However, teenage girls, along with their mothers, were expected to leave their jobs once soldiers returned from war. Thus, there was {{a gap between the}} actual experiences of teenage girls and what they were expected to be [...] Rosie the Riveters who were willing to become housewives {{at the end of the}} war. This gap between actual experiences and societal expectations has lent itself to typifying even fictional girls into either 2 ̆ 2 bad girls 2 ̆ 2 or 2 ̆ 2 good girls. 2 ̆ 2 In this project <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>deeper</b> look at how social discourses [...] specifically the boom in the wedding industry, a renewed obsession with anything Western related, department store sections catered directly to teenagers, and scrapbook making [...] greatly affected the coming-of-process for teenage girls. Using De Certeau 2 ̆ 7 s The Practices of Everyday Lives, I investigate how each author in my project complicates the trope of the maturation arc. In chapter one I examine how Carson McCullers, in her The Member of the Wedding, uses her character Frankie Addams as a didactic tool, one that forces the reader to question the impact of the maturation arc on characters. In chapter two I trace the ways in which Jean Stafford, in her The Mountain Lion, unleashes the potential violence that occurs when a character is not able to reach the signposts of the maturation arc. Chapter three traces the ways in which Judy Graves from Sally Benson 2 ̆ 7 s Junior Miss is able to develop the tactic of performance in order to appropriate the maturation arc. In chapter four I consider the ways in which Francine Nolan from Betty Smith 2 ̆ 7 s A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is able to resist the maturation arc and take ownership over her own coming-of-age process.

Bouaphakeo, a 2 ̆ 2 {{donning and doffing}} 2 ̆ 2 case {{brought under}} Iowa state law {{incorporating}} the Fair Labor Standards Act 2 ̆ 7 s overtime pay provisions, the petitioners asked the Supreme Court to reject the use of statistical evidence in Rule 23 (b) (3) class certification. To its great credit, the Court refused. In its majority opinion, the Court cited both the Federal Rules of Evidence and federal common law interpreting the FLSA. In this paper, <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> moderately <b>deep</b> dive into {{the facts of the}} case, and the three opinions penned by Justice Kennedy (for the Court), Chief Justice Roberts (in concurrence), and Justice Thomas (in dissent) to explain why the case highlights the symbiotic relationship between Rule 232 ̆ 7 s certification-relevant provisions, underlying substantive law, and the Federal Rules of Evidence. I argue that the petitioners 2 ̆ 7 attempts to forge a common law of statistical evidence for class certification was at war with core Federal Rules of Evidence and, consequently, with the Rules Enabling Act. Along the way, I introduce the category of counterfactually relevant evidence. I show that the statistical and other representative evidence deployed by respondents fit in this category. I then explain why arguments against the use of this evidence [...] whether at trial or for other purposes such as class certification [...] must fail. I close with a graphical depiction of how the three sources of positive law at issue in class certification [...] Rule 23, substantive law, and the Federal Rules of Evidence [...] interact with evidence used to prove that certification is warranted. The result is what I call the Triangle of Law, with each source of law occupying a vertex and the evidence at issue situated at the Triangle 2 ̆ 7 s center. This formulation should help scholars, practitioners, and courts focus attention on the independent but interconnected roles played by evidence and the three sources of law involved in class certification questions...|$|R

40|$|What is {{the first}} thing that comes to mind when you think of home? How many layers are there in your {{definition}} of home? Throughout my research I discovered that every individual has some sort of personal, emotional, or even physical attachment to a location that most people would label as 2 ̆ 2 home 2 ̆ 2. I have also discovered that a 2 ̆ 2 home 2 ̆ 2 is not necessarily a physical place, but a home can be a smell, a feeling, or a memory. An individual 2 ̆ 7 s idea and perception is organic and multifaceted. One simple word can trigger seemingly endless layers of emotions and memories in so many different types of people. In this creative body of work, <b>I</b> aim to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>deeper</b> look into my personal battle on the idea of home.

I also utilized human organs to represent one 2 ̆ 7 s emotional and physical attachment to their notion of home. Overall, each piece is meant to be perceived as a nostalgic memory. Even though each work of art is created from my own struggle with the notions of home, my hope is that it causes the viewer to reflect and remember their own home, and why their home is or was important to them. These pieces are not only meant to be viewed, but also to be experienced, perhaps through a simple stroll down memory lane or an unwanted journey back to a place that was once called home...|$|R

I incline as little to the sickly feeling which makes every canting lie or maudlin speech of a notorious criminal a subject of newspaper report and general sympathy, as I do to those good old customs of the good old times which made England, even so recently as in the reign of the Third King George, in respect of her criminal code and her prison regulations, one of the most bloody-minded and barbarous countries on the earth. If I thought it would do any good to the rising generation, I would cheerfully give my consent to the disinterment of the bones of any genteel highwayman (the more genteel, the more cheerfully), and to their exposure, piecemeal, on any sign-post, gate, or gibbet, that might be deemed a good elevation for the purpose. My reason is as well convinced that these gentry were as utterly worthless and debauched villains, as it is that the laws and jails hardened them in their evil courses, or that their wonderful escapes were effected by the prison-turnkeys who, in those admirable days, had always been felons themselves, and were, to the last, their bosom-friends and pot-companions. At the same time I know, as all men do or should, that the subject of Prison Discipline is one of the highest importance to any community; and that in her sweeping reform and bright example to other countries on this head, America has shown great wisdom, great benevolence, and exalted policy. In contrasting her system with that which we have modelled upon it, I merely seek to show that with all its drawbacks, ours has some advantages of its own.|$|R
