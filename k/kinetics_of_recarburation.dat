40|$|Abstract—The {{dissolution}} of pyrite {{is important in}} the geochemical cycling of iron and sulphur, in the formation of acid mine drainage, and in the extraction of metals by bacterial leaching. Many researchers have studied the <b>kinetics</b> <b>of</b> dissolution, and the rate of dissolution has often been found to be half-order in ferric ions or oxygen. Previous work has not adequately explained the <b>kinetics</b> <b>of</b> {{dissolution of}} pyrite. The dissolution of pyrite is an oxidation-reduction reaction. The <b>kinetics</b> <b>of</b> the oxidation and reduction half-reactions was studied independently using electrochemical techniques <b>of</b> voltammetry. The <b>kinetics</b> <b>of</b> the overall reaction was studied by the electrochemical technique of potentiometry, which consisted of measuring the mixed potential of a sample of corroding pyrite in solutions of different compositions. The <b>kinetics</b> <b>of</b> the half reactions are related to the <b>kinetics</b> <b>of</b> the overall dissolution reaction by the condition that there is no accumulation of charge. This principle is used to derive expressions for the mixed potential and the rate of dissolution, which successfully describe the mixed potential measurements and the <b>kinetics</b> <b>of</b> dissolution reported in the literature. It is shown that the observations <b>of</b> half-order <b>kinetics</b> and that the oxygen in the sulphate product arises from water are both a direct consequence of the electrochemical mechanism. Thus it is concluded that the electrochemical reaction steps occurring at the mineral-solution interface control the rate of dissolution. Raman spectroscopy was used to analyze reaction products formed on the pyrite surface. Th...|$|R

40|$|The <b>kinetics</b> <b>of</b> {{nucleation}} of a core-shell composite nucleus {{that consists}} of a core of stable final phase surrounded by a wetting layer of intermediate metastable phase is studied using the kinetic theory of binary nucleation {{not only in the}} size and composition space but also in the component space. The steady-state solution of the Fokker-Planck equation is considered. Various formulas for the critical nucleus at the saddle point {{as well as for the}} post-critical nucleus are derived. The <b>kinetics</b> <b>of</b> nucleation at the saddle point is more appropriately characterized in the size and composition space, while the <b>kinetics</b> <b>of</b> the post-critical nucleus is more appropriately described in the component space.
