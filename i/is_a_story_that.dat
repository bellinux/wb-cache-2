25|$|Richmond {{had been}} made the capital since it was {{believed}} to be less exposed to attack than Williamsburg, but in January 1781, British forces under the renegade former American general, Benedict Arnold, sailed up the James River and captured Richmond with little opposition as Henry joined the other legislators and Governor Jefferson in fleeing to Charlottesville. Although Arnold soon withdrew to Portsmouth, in February, troops under Lord Cornwallis entered the state from North Carolina; the war, which had for the most part been fought out of state, would have many of its final moves played in Virginia. With Washington's army near New York, Henry sought to recruit soldiers to defend the state, and in March helped draft an angry remonstrance from the House of Delegates to Congress, demanding help. Nevertheless, in May, British forces under Colonel Banastre Tarleton raided Charlottesville, nearly capturing the Virginia government, which fled to Staunton. There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> <b>that</b> Henry fled with other prominent leaders, and sought refuge at the home of a woman who initially spurned them as cowards for fleeing Charlottesville. But on learning Henry was with the group, she decided it must be all right, and offered them the best she had.|$|E

In her speech at the Western Australian Equal Opportunity Commission Forum, Perth, 10 August 2009, Oscar stated that Aboriginal leaders in the Valley had taken their first steps {{on the path of}} reconstructing their communities but now needed the government to support them:It is a story of colonisation; the threat of losing our cultural authority to manage our societies; and the despair that has come from that disempowerment.It is a story of grief and trauma and the continued pain of living with grog, drug and violence.It <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> <b>that</b> academics and journalists write about us as though we are victims of history that we can do nothing about. And within their stories about us is an acceptance that the paternal hand of government will determine the nature of our welfare and even the nature of our rights.… I want to tell a different story. It is about how Aboriginal people can be the authors of our stories and not passive and powerless subjects in stories told and written by others.… I want to talk about how the leaders of the Fitzroy Valley in the Kimberley are working together to create a pathway of hope and community vitality and resilience… if our journey of social reconstruction could be measured as a one kilometre track, we have only travelled the first metre.The start of the journey has depended on the leadership of the Aboriginal community but the journey from this point on will largely be shaped by a partnership that we can create and build with governments.|$|E

500|$|As the {{nominations}} for the 66th Primetime Emmy Awards approached, early media reports named True Detective among several potential miniseries candidates, {{due to a}} revision made by the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences that recognized film and miniseries content as distinct categories. By March 2014, HBO had submitted True Detective as a drama series contender, an unconventional move given the show's anthology format and fierce competition {{from the likes of}} Breaking Bad and House of Cards. HBO's decision was censured by FX president John Landgraf, who remarked to reporters at a press event: [...] "My own personal point of view is that a miniseries <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> <b>that</b> ends, a series <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> <b>that</b> continues. To tell you the truth, I think it’s actually unfair for HBO to put True Detective in the drama series category because essentially you can get certain actors to do a closed-ended series – a la Billy Bob Thornton in Fargo or Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson in True Detective – who you can’t get to sign on for a seven-year [...] deal." [...] Nevertheless, True Detective emerged as a frontrunner heading into the Primetime Emmy season, and in July 2014, was nominated for twelve awards; its closest rival, Breaking Bad, received sixteen nominations. The series ultimately won five Emmy awards: Outstanding Directing (Fukunaga), Outstanding Casting, Outstanding Main Title Design, Outstanding Make-Up, and Outstanding Cinematography.|$|E

500|$|The English {{composer}} Benjamin Britten {{was asked}} to write the Prelude and Fugue for St Matthew's Church, Northampton.

There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> <b>that</b> he wrote it in bed one morning before breakfast. Britten had previously been commissioned by the vicar of St Matthew's, Walter Hussey, to write a cantata, Rejoice in the Lamb, for the church's fiftieth anniversary in 1943; the organ accompaniment for the cantata used the organ in a [...] "strikingly original way". The Prelude and Fugue {{was one of two}} pieces based on themes by other composers that Britten wrote in 1946; the other was the Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra, which was based on a piece by Henry Purcell.|$|E

To keep himself occupied, he began reciting poetry to the rhythm of the ship's engines and soon found himself saying, [...] "And that <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> <b>that</b> no one can beat, and to think that I saw it on Mulberry Street."

Production and additional writing on the songs were done by Greg Wells, who previously worked with the singer on her second studio album, One of the Boys (2008). Perry considers it {{to be like that}} of a two-part song because she had started working on [...] "Not Like the Movies" [...] before she met Brand, and completed it after they began dating.

500|$|Solo {{received}} mixed reviews. A {{number of}} reviewers, including Robert McCrum in The Guardian, David Mills in The Sunday Times and Olen Steinhauer in The New York Times, all considered {{the book to}} be equal with, or superior to, Fleming's stronger novels. Steinhauer wrote that it was Boyd's description of the Zanzarim civil war that gave the novel its [...] "greatest power", and that Boyd performed s a [...] "neat metafictional trick" [...] by connecting Bond's wartime experiences with 30 Assault Unit—a British Commando unit developed by Fleming. The connection was also picked up by Geoffrey Wansell, reviewing for the Daily Mail, who saw the tribute paid to Fleming as a [...] "masterstroke", in a novel that he thought [...] "brings back the real Bond, triumphantly". Writing in The Guardian, Richard Williams saw Boyd using some similar phrasing of Fleming's, while also including [...] "gestures of independence" [...] with his own ideas. The result, Williams considers, <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> <b>that</b> [...] "entertains far more than it exasperates".|$|E

Centrally planned domed churches had been built since the 4th century for very {{particular}} functions, such as palace churches or martyria, with a slight widening of use around 500 AD, but most church buildings were timber-roofed halls on the basilica plan. The Church of St. Polyeuctus in Constantinople (524–527) was apparently built as a large and lavish domed basilica similar to the Meriamlik church of fifty years before—and to the later Hagia Irene of Emperor Justinian—by Anicia Juliana, a descendent of the former imperial house. There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> <b>that</b> she used the contribution to public funds that she had promised Justinian on his ascension to the throne to roof her church in gold.
