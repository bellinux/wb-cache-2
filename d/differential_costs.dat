40|$|This paper extends {{our earlier}} {{analysis}} on approximate linear programming as {{an approach to}} approximating the cost-to-go function in a discounted-cost dynamic program [6]. In this paper, we consider the average-cost criterion and a version of approximate linear programming that generates approximations to the optimal average <b>cost</b> and <b>differential</b> <b>cost</b> function. We demonstrate that a naive version of approximate linear programming prioritizes approximation of the optimal average cost and that {{this may not be}} well-aligned with the objective of deriving a policy with low average cost. For that, the algorithm should aim at producing a good approximation of the <b>differential</b> <b>cost</b> function. We propose a twophase variant of approximate linear programming that allows for external control of the relative accuracy of the approximation of the <b>differential</b> <b>cost</b> function over different portions of the state space via state-relevance weights.

40|$|The major {{intent of}} the {{investigation}} {{was to determine the}} existing level of <b>cost</b> <b>differentials</b> for selected education program categories in the state of Indiana. The categories of prekindergarten and kindergarten, grades one through six, grades seven through-twelve, mentally handicapped, physically handicapped, compensatory and vocational education were selected as program categories for study. Secondary concerns were to describe the patterns of 1971 - 72 public school funding for the state of Indiana by government level and to recommend a new concept for distribution of state funds to Indiana local schools based on the developed program <b>cost</b> <b>differentials.</b> Sources of revenue were taken from Report of Statistical Information for Indiana School Corporations 1971 - 72 School Year for the 1967 - 68, 1968 - 69, 1969 - 70, 1970 - 71, 1971 - 72 school years. Percentages as to major categories of revenue were computed for the above years. The Education <b>Cost</b> <b>Differential</b> Basic Data Instrument was developed for collecting data to achieve the major purpose of the study. Seventy-four Indiana school corporations were sampled from a population of all Indiana reorganized school corporations which had grade organizational patterns of 6 - 6, 6 - 2 - 4, or 6 - 3 - 3 for the school year 1971 - 72. Eighteen responded with timely usable data. State <b>cost</b> <b>differentials</b> for each program were computed by dividing reported net current operating expenditures for each program area by total full time equivalent pupils in ADM for the program. State <b>cost</b> <b>differentials</b> were computed by dividing the average cost per full time equivalent pupil in ADM for each program by the cost per pupil for the basic program, grades one through six. Conclusions of the study included: 1. The major fiscal support for public school corporations in Indiana is provided from localsources. 2. Percentage of the total revenue from local sources has constantly increased for the public school systems from July 1, 1967 through June 30, 1972. 3. The Indiana General Assembly has not provided fiscal support commensurate with the rising costs of public education. 4. Federal support as a percentage of total fiscal support of public education in Indiana is below the national average. 5. Elementary programs, grades one through six, have the lowest net current operating expenditure and were assigned a <b>cost</b> <b>differential</b> index of 1. 000. 6. Secondary programs, grades seven through twelve, represent the second lowest net current operating expenditure with a <b>cost</b> <b>differential</b> index of 1. 095. 7, The <b>cost</b> <b>differential</b> index for vocational education programs is 1. 256. 8. Prekindergarten and kindergarten have a <b>cost</b> <b>differential</b> index of 1. 271. 9. The <b>cost</b> <b>differential</b> index for compensatory education is 1. 633. 10. Mentally handicapped programs have a computed <b>cost</b> <b>differential</b> index of 2. 559. 11. The <b>cost</b> <b>differential</b> index for physically handicapped programs is 2, 821. In comparing Indiana <b>cost</b> <b>differential</b> indices with <b>cost</b> <b>differential</b> indices developed in similar studies but different populations, the vocational index of 1. 256 is indefensibly lower and, therefore, questioned. Only five of the 18 respondents supplying data may account for the variation. The Indiana General Assembly should enact legislation which would provide a distribution formula for state aid to local school districts which weights per pupil allocations based upon program cost indices. The weighted pupil concept could be effectively employed to determine state allocations by multiplying the number of weighted pupils in ADM by a uniform dollar allotment for pupils with an index of 1. 000. The cost of the state guaranteed program, to avoid built-in inequities, should be defined as net current operating expenditures. Thesis (D. Ed. ...|$|R

It is concluded that interdisciplinary information sharing through computer aided design procedure is severely restricted by methodology problems and by the relatively small quantity of common information.

The U.S. trend of moving away from cash programmes towards in-kind may not be as inefficient as it first appears, and the estimates here suggest that such <b>differential</b> <b>costs</b> of in-work transfers might be exploited to raise labour force participation in the U.K. at no cost to the government. The results also imply that raising the costs of out-of-work welfare might also promote labour force participation. That is, a policy of cashing out the eligibility for in-kind transfers for those on out-of-work transfers, instead of those on in-work cash transfers, would have better served UK work incentives.|$|E

40|$|Aposematic prey use {{conspicuous}} {{warning signals}} to advertise their defenses to predators. It {{has long been}} recognized that the efficiency of a warning signal may be reduced if poorly defended prey (automimics) {{are present in the}} population. The handicap principle suggests that the use of warning signals by poorly defended prey may be kept in check if signaling is costly. Three mechanisms that involve signal costs have been proposed to facilitate honest warning signals in prey: go-slow behavior in predators, resource allocation trade-offs, and costs of detection alone. We study all three in a unified game-theoretical framework. We find that the go-slow mechanism and the resource allocation mechanism can introduce differential benefits and <b>differential</b> <b>costs</b> of signaling, respectively, and can support honest signaling in accordance with the handicap principle. When honest signaling is maintained by the go-slow mechanism, conspicuous prey will necessarily suffer more attacks on average than cryptic prey. In contrast, when honest signaling is maintained by the resource allocation mechanism, cryptic prey will suffer more attacks. The detection cost mechanism lacks <b>differential</b> <b>costs</b> and benefits, and its potential for maintaining honest signaling equilibria is limited. We relate our results to intra- and interspecific correlations between conspicuousness and defense. © 2012 University of Chicago Pres...|$|E
