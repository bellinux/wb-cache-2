5|$|Offshore {{wind power}} is {{captured}} by wind turbines placed out at sea; {{it has the}} advantage that wind speeds are higher than on land, though wind <b>farms</b> <b>are</b> more costly to construct offshore. The first offshore wind farm was installed in Denmark in 1991, and the installed capacity of European offshore wind farms reached 3 GW in 2010.|$|E
5|$|Wind {{is another}} {{resource}} that Wales has in abundance.

50|$|In 1987 about 2.7 million private <b>farms</b> <b>were</b> in operation. About 57 {{percent of}} these were smaller than five hectares. Of the {{remaining}} <b>farms,</b> 25 percent <b>were</b> between five and ten hectares and 11 percent were between ten and fifteen hectares. Only 7 percent of private <b>farms</b> <b>were</b> larger than fifteen hectares.

5|$|Effects {{are not all}} negative; for example, {{wind farms}} produce {{renewable}} energy, helping to mitigate the single greatest threat to birds, climate change. But, especially if wind <b>farms</b> <b>are</b> poorly sited, they may affect bird populations through disturbance, direct or indirect habitat loss, and collisions. Well sited wind farms benefit birds; poorly sited ones can kill many birds in collisions. For example, at the Altamont Pass in California, the golden eagle has been reduced by 80%, and nesting has ceased in the area. Thus, there is a trade-off in the siting of any wind farm.|$|E
5|$|In humans, body {{temperature}} is typically highest during {{the mid to}} late afternoon. However, human athletes being tested for physical vigor on exercise machines showed no statistically significant difference after lunch. Owners of factory <b>farms</b> <b>are</b> advised to use buildings with an east–west (as opposed to north–south) orientation to house their livestock, because an east–west orientation generally means thicker walls on the east and west to accommodate the sun's acute angle and intense glare during late afternoon. When these animals are too hot, {{they are more likely to}} become belligerent and unproductive.|$|E
5|$|Military {{units are}} {{produced}} at specific buildings {{relevant to their}} area. All sea units are created at the docks. Walls and towers are defensive fortifications (Age of Empires {{was one of the}} first real-time strategy games to include walls strong enough to form a feasible means of defense). <b>Farms</b> <b>are</b> used to produce food. Granaries, storage pits, and the Town Center are used to store resources deposited by the villagers.|$|E

5|$|The lower-level {{buildings}} for Humans and Orcs {{have the same}} functions, but different sprites. The Town Hall stores resources and produces units that collect resources and construct buildings. Each Farm provides food for up to four units, and additional units cannot be produced until enough <b>Farms</b> <b>are</b> built. The Barracks produces all non-magical combat units, including melee, ranged, mounted, and siege units. However all except the most basic also need assistance from other buildings, some of which can also upgrade units.|$|E
5|$|Alpine {{symbolism}} {{has played}} {{an essential role}} in shaping {{the history of the country}} and the Swiss national identity. Nowadays some concentrated mountain areas have a strong highly energetic ski resort culture in winter, and a hiking (ger: das Wandern) or Mountain biking culture in summer. Other areas throughout the year have a recreational culture that caters to tourism, yet the quieter seasons are spring and autumn when there are fewer visitors. A traditional farmer and herder culture also predominates in many areas and small <b>farms</b> <b>are</b> omnipresent outside the cities. Folk art is kept alive in organisations all over the country. In Switzerland it is mostly expressed in music, dance, poetry, wood carving and embroidery. The alphorn, a trumpet-like musical instrument made of wood, has become alongside yodeling and the accordion an epitome of traditional Swiss music.|$|E
5|$|Although the durian is not {{native to}} Thailand, {{the country is}} {{currently}} {{one of the major}} exporters of durians, growing 781,000 tonnes of the world's total harvest of 1,400,000 tonnes in 1999, 111,000 tonnes of which it exported to Taiwan, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore and Canada. Malaysia and Indonesia follow, both producing about 265,000 tonnes each. Of this, Malaysia exported 35,000 tonnes in 1999. Chantaburi in Thailand each year holds the World Durian Festival in early May. This single province is responsible for half of the durian production of Thailand. In the Philippines, the centre of durian production is the Davao Region. The Kadayawan Festival is an annual celebration featuring the durian in Davao City. Other places where durian <b>farms</b> <b>are</b> located include Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, India, the West Indies, Florida, Hawaii, Papua New Guinea, the Polynesian Islands, Madagascar, southern China (Hainan Island), northern Australia, and Singapore.|$|E

5|$|Bacterial {{diseases}} {{carried by}} wolves include brucellosis, lyme disease, leptospirosis, tularemia, bovine tuberculosis, listeriosis, anthrax and foot and mouth disease. Wolves can catch Brucella suis from wild and domestic reindeer. While adult wolves {{tend not to}} show any clinical signs, it can severely weaken the pups of infected females. Although lyme disease can debilitate individual wolves, {{it does not appear}} to have any significant effect on wolf populations. Leptospirosis can be contracted through contact with infected prey or urine, and can cause fever, anorexia, vomiting, anemia, hematuria, icterus, and death. Wolves living near <b>farms</b> <b>are</b> more vulnerable to the disease than those living in the wilderness, probably because of prolonged contact with infected domestic animal waste. Wolves may catch tularemia from lagomorph prey, though its effect on wolves is unknown. Although bovine tuberculosis is not considered a major threat to wolves, it has been recorded to have once killed two wolf pups in Canada.|$|E
5|$|The Poitevin breed {{has very}} low numbers. In 2011, there were 71 new foals {{registered}} with the studbook. The same year, 227 mares were covered, with 171 being bred to Poitevin stallions. There were 33 stallions registered and 80 active breeders. These numbers represent a decrease from the previous year. Over the past decade, {{the highest number of}} foals registered was 113 in 2008, and between 80 and 90 foals were registered in the other years. The majority of breeding <b>farms</b> <b>are</b> located in the Poitou area, including Vendée (especially around Fontenay-le-Comte and Luçon), Deux-Sèvres (especially near Melle), Vienna and Civray, and some in Charente, near Ruffec.

5|$|The Republic of Ireland {{has shown}} a strong {{commitment}} to renewable energy, ranking {{as one of the top}} 10 markets for cleantech investment in the 2014 Global Green Economy Index. Research and development in Ireland in renewable energy such as wind power has increased since 2004. Large wind <b>farms</b> <b>are</b> being constructed in coastal counties such as Cork, Donegal, Mayo and Antrim. The construction of wind farms has in some cases been delayed by opposition from local communities, some of whom overall consider the wind turbines to be unsightly. The Republic of Ireland is also hindered by an ageing network that was not designed to handle the varying availability of power that comes from wind farms. The ESB's Turlough Hill facility is the only power-storage facility in the state.|$|E

5|$|The typical prey {{consists}} of surface organisms such as small fish, squid, crustaceans and jellyfish. The storm petrel will also eat offal and oily food, often located by smell, and will follow ships. In the Atlantic, {{more than half}} the food items are zooplankton and the fish caught include small herring and sprats; whale carcasses are scavenged where available. During digestion, the plankton is quickly converted to an oily orange liquid that owes its colour to carotenoids. Larger prey items take longer to digest. The oil, rich in vitamin A, is produced by a large gland in the stomach. The Mediterranean subspecies' diet is mainly fish, particularly Mediterranean sand eels. Petrels also catch opossum shrimps from waters close to the colony. Bluefin tuna <b>farms</b> <b>are</b> exploited on the Maltese island of Filfla; birds from the large local colony feed on the unwashed food fed to the farmed tuna, a mixture of fish, squid and prawns which produces a sizeable oily slick. Small numbers of insects are caught near breeding colonies, and some plant material, including angiosperm seeds and sorrel, has been found in the stomach contents. A study on Leach's storm petrel, which consumes similar items, showed that the petrels were snipping pieces off plant leaves in flight, but it could not be confirmed that this was in the course of catching insects. Nasal glands remove excess salt from seawater consumed by the petrel as a concentrated solution excreted through the nostrils.|$|E
5|$|From 2010 to 2011, {{the state}} {{experienced}} a slower growth due to weaker {{performance on the}} oil and gas sector. Based on 2014 survey, Sabah GDP recorded a 5.0% growth and remained as the largest contributor in agriculture sector with 18.1%, followed by Sarawak, Johor, Pahang and Perak. Its GDP per capita however are still lowest with RM19,672, the third lowest after Kelantan (RM11,815) and Kedah (RM17,321) from all 13 states. In the same year, the state export value stood at RM45.3billion with an import value of RM36.5billion. Machinery and transportation equipment accounted for most of the imported products followed by fuel, mineral lubricants and others. While Sabah mostly exports raw petroleum and palm oil. The state currently has a total of eight ports with two in Sepanggar while each one in Kota Kinabalu, Sandakan, Tawau, Kudat, Kunak and Lahad Datu that was operated and maintained by the Sabah Ports Authority owned by Suria Group. As part of the Eleventh Malaysia Plan (11MP), the federal government has approved an allocation of RM800million to expand the cargo handling of Sapangar Bay Container Port from 500,000 to 1.25million TEUs per annum as well to accommodate larger ship like Panamax-size vessels. An additional allocation of RM333.51million was given in the same year, making it a total of RM1.13billion with the project will start in 2017. The fisheries industries remain the important part of Sabah primary sector economy with a contribution for about 200,000 metric tonnes of fish worth RM700 annually as well contributing 2.8% to the state annual GDP. While the aquaculture and marine fish cage sector have produce 35,000 metric tons of brackish and fresh waters aquaculture and 360 metric ton of groupers, wrasses, snappers and lobsters worth around RM60million and RM13million respectively. Sabah {{is also one of the}} producer of seaweed, with most of the <b>farms</b> <b>are</b> located in the seas around Semporna. Although recently the seaweed industry was heavily affected by spate of kidnappings perpetrated by the southern-Philippine-based Abu Sayyaf militant group.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the biggest}} current {{challenges}} to wind power grid integration in the United States is the necessity of developing new transmission lines to carry power from wind farms, usually in remote lowly populated states {{in the middle of}} the country due to availability of wind, to high load locations, usually on the coasts where population density is higher. The current transmission lines in remote locations were not designed for the transport of large amounts of energy. As transmission lines become longer the losses associated with power transmission increase, as modes of losses at lower lengths are exacerbated and new modes of losses are no longer negligible as the length is increased, making it harder to transport large loads over large distances. However, resistance from state and local governments makes it difficult to construct new transmission lines. Multi state power transmission projects are discouraged by states with cheap electric power rates for fear that exporting their cheap power will lead to increased rates. A 2005 energy law gave the Energy Department authority to approve transmission projects states refused to act on, but after an attempt to use this authority, the Senate declared the department was being overly aggressive in doing so. Another problem is that wind companies find out after the fact that the transmission capacity of a new farm is below the generation capacity, largely because federal utility rules to encourage renewable energy installation allow feeder lines to meet only minimum standards. These are important issues that need to be solved, as when the transmission capacity does not meet the generation capacity, wind <b>farms</b> <b>are</b> forced to produce below their full potential or stop running all together, in a process known as curtailment. While this leads to potential renewable generation left untapped, it prevents possible grid overload or risk to reliable service.|$|E
