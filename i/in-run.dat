5|$|Andersen and Ruud skied {{down the}} <b>in-run</b> in a {{standing}} position to reduce their speed, and had the two longest standing jumps.|$|E
5|$|The jury {{consisted}} of Østgaard of Norway, Jilek of Czechoslovakia and Straumann of Switzerland. Because of {{ice on the}} <b>in-run,</b> a reduced speed was used during the first round. Andersen jumped 60.0meters, by far the longest jump. Lengthwise, Ruud and Vuilleumier were in joint second place with 57.5meters, while Burket was in fourth with 57.0meters. Thams, Kleppen and Poland's Bronisław Czech all jumped 56.5meters, but both Kleppen and Czech fell. In terms of points, the three Norwegians Andersen, Ruud and Thams were in the lead, ahead of Burket and Vuilleumier.|$|E
5|$|In the break, {{a number}} of Central Europeans, {{including}} Vuilleumier and Bruno Trojani, asked for top speed. This was protested by the Scandinavian and United States jumpers, and a 40-minute discussion broke out. At one point, one of the facilitators at the <b>in-run</b> received a telephone call confirming top speed. The facilitator was skeptical, and chose to call back to the judges, who could confirm {{that they had not}} given such a go-ahead. In the end, the judges chose to allow higher speeds, with a compromise of 5.0meters more distance. However, the facilitator only moved the rope 4.5meters. This made the Swiss furious, and they used their knives to cut the rope. They then accused the participants who were opposed to full speed of being cowards.|$|E
500|$|In 2010, the Olympic legacy company ZOI'84, {{which owns}} the hills, {{launched}} plans to renovate the venue. Estimated to cost between €7 million and €10 million, the <b>in-runs</b> would have been completely rebuilt, {{as they are in}} too poor condition to be renovated. The large hill would be expanded to give a K-point of [...] Designs have been made by Austrian architect firm Hofrichter-Ritter and financing is planned through European Union or Austrian grants. The project includes natural stands {{on the sides of the}} landing slope and a combination of permanent and temporary stands around the out-run. At a later date, part of stands could be covered with a roof. A panorama restaurant has been proposed for the top of the <b>in-runs.</b> The new venue was scheduled to open in 2013; however, no work was done and the site is mostly derelict.|$|R
500|$|Papoose Peak Jumps was {{the first}} Olympic ski jump to have three <b>in-runs.</b> [...] Minor details were {{corrected}} in 1959 and 1960. It was renovated ahead of the 1976 US National Championships. However, it fell out of use afterwards and instead the hill was converted to a speed skiing and snowboarding hill. Later the resort's Far East Express chairlift was installed on the hill.|$|R
5|$|The {{location}} was first identified by Knute Hansen, a ski jumper {{who felt that}} a location in Mount McRae in Lakehead would be ideal for a ski jumping hill. He and Thor Hansen built the first jumps, which were opened in 1963 and named Lille Norway Ski Area. In 1969, after the Hansens had fallen into financial difficulties, the venue was sold and renamed Mt. Norway Ski Area. Additional land for the complex was also leased, and the provincial government provided funding to construct the main twin hill. Construction of the 70meter and 90meter (current K-90 and K-120) hills was completed in 1974. The following year, the venue hosted its first Canadian Ski Jumping Championships. Three years later, the venue was again sold, this time being named Sundance Northwest Resort. In 1981, the Provincial Government of Ontario started redeveloping the site to transform it into a national training center. In 1985, the Ontario Ministry of Tourism and Recreation bought the site. In the course of five years, they built a K-64 hill, as well as Little Thunder, which consisted of K-10, K-20 and K-37 hills. The two largest of these were equipped with porcelain <b>in-runs</b> and plastic landing slopes, allowing for their use during summer.|$|R
5|$|Norway sent {{a strong}} {{contingent}} with four jumpers {{able to win}} the event, including reigning Olympic and world champion Jacob Tullin Thams. Andersen had won all eight Norwegian qualification events. World record holder Nels Nelsen from Canada was not permitted to participate due to financial problems. Japan participated in an international ski jumping competition for the first time, also becoming the first Asian country to do so. After the first jump, three Norwegians were in the lead. A 40-minute discussion erupted regarding the speed, with Central European jumpers wanting it increased. This was complied with by the jury, resulting in falls by several favorites, including the most vocal speed increase proponents, Gérard Vuilleumier and Bruno Trojani. Andersen and Ruud won by reducing their speed on the <b>in-run.</b>|$|E
25|$|During summer, the old hill had a lake, {{which made}} it {{possible}} to use the amphitheater for concerts, plays and entertainment. The venue was then often referred to as Sommerkollen. From 1963, a temporary, small <b>in-run</b> was built down the southern grandstand, which allowed skiers and divers to make a jump and land in the water. Between 1963 and 1983, a competition was held nine times. Starting in 1983 was Ta sjansen, which was televised annually by the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation and became Sommerkollen's most popular show. It was an informal competition with two main events: one where a home-made craft was to first slide down a short <b>in-run</b> and then slide along the water surface to hit a mounted bell in the shortest possible time. The other was a cycling competition where the cyclist had to complete a track on a wobbly floating wharf.|$|E
25|$|The hill {{has been}} rebuilt 19 times; {{important}} upgrades include a stone take-off in 1910, an <b>in-run</b> superstructure in 1914, {{and a new}} superstructure in 1928. During the Second World War, the venue {{was used as a}} military installation, but upgraded in the late 1940s. Further expansions were made ahead of the 1966 and 1982 World Championships, as well as in 1991. Between 2008 and 2010, the entire structure was demolished and rebuilt. As of 8 February 2011, the hill record is unofficially held by Anders Jacobsen at 142.5 meters. The official hill record was set at 5 March 2011 by Andreas Kofler at 141 meters. The hill is part of Holmenkollen National Arena, which in addition to cross-country and biathlon venues has the normal hill Midtstubakken.|$|E
25|$|On 22 September 2005, FIS {{stated that}} an all-new Holmenkollbakken {{would have to}} be built if Oslo was to host the World Championships and World Cup tournaments. FIS stated that similar reconstructions had been done with Schattenbergschanze in Oberstdorf, Germany, and Bergiselschanze in Innsbrück, Austria. In December 2005, the Norwegian Directorate for Cultural Heritage gave {{permission}} for the tower to be demolished, on the condition it was replaced by a new <b>in-run</b> with a similar architectural quality and retain its function as a landmark. They stated that it was the activity itself that is worthy of preservation, not the structure itself. The city council made the final decision to apply for the World Championships and build a new hill on 1 March 2006. A new hill was at the time estimated to cost NOK310 million, and the state was willing to finance NOK70 million of those. Oslo was awarded the 2011 World Championships in May 2006.|$|E
500|$|The hill {{consisted}} of three jumps with a common out-run, each with a construction point (K-point) of 80, 60 and 40 meters, respectively. It was located in the central area of the Olympic resort, next to the skating rinks and the Olympic Village. Tall trees {{on both sides of}} the hill gave good protection against the wind. The location was also ideal because of the sun was at the competitor's backs. A judges' tower was constructed on the side, which was both accessible by stairs from the bottom of the hill or from the chairlift which ran to the top of the in-runs. The hill had an overall height of , the <b>in-run</b> had a length of [...] The largest jump had a take-off angle of 8.5 degrees and a landing angle of 38 degrees.|$|E
500|$|Igman Olympic Jumps, {{also known}} as Malo Polje, is a ski jumping hill on the {{mountain}} of Igman in Ilidža, Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina. It consists of a large hill with a construction point (K-point) of [...] and a normal hill with a K-point of [...] Construction started in 1980 and the venue opened in 1982 to host ski jumping and Nordic combined at the 1984 Winter Olympics. The large hill event saw Finland's Matti Nykänen set the hill record of [...] in front of 90,000 spectators. No other International Ski Federation (FIS) sanctioned competitions have taken place at the hills. During the Siege of Sarajevo, the hills became a battleground and have since not been used. However, there are plans to rebuild the <b>in-run,</b> expand the large hill and build new spectator stands and visitor facilities.|$|E
500|$|The ski jumping, {{cross-country}} skiing and Nordic combined events {{were held at}} Holmenkollbakken, [...] from the city center. Although upgraded several times since its opening in 1892, the former wooden superstructure was replaced with a concrete tower and <b>in-run</b> ahead of the Olympics, with the out-run being extended to [...] Stands were erected to seat 13,000 people, with capacity for an additional 130,000 standing spectators {{at the base of}} the hill. Cross-country races started and ended {{at the base of the}} ski hill. A switchboard was posted at the start and finish lines to help spectators monitor the progress of the competitors during the races. Most of the stands built for the ski jumping competition had to be removed for the cross-country races. As a result, there was little room for spectators to sit and watch the cross-country events. Spectators were therefore allowed to walk within the course.|$|E
500|$|Rosendale's first {{ski jumping}} {{competition}} {{was held on}} January24, 1937. The ski track was designed by Harold Schelderup, a ski hill designer from Norway. Bad weather caused the cancellation of competitive events, but a skiing exhibition still occurred. That April, the Telemark club held a special dinner in Brooklyn to honor members who performed well in the January competition. The club planned to hold a summer competition by covering the mountain with [...] "straw and pine needles". Harold Schelderup, who was recognized at the dinner for his skills, performed in the summer tournament. Joppenbergh's ski track was coated with borax, and the tournament was held on July18, 1937 at 2:30 in the afternoon, with enough parking provided for 500 cars. In front of a crowd of 3,300 people, [...] "jumpers took off from an <b>in-run</b> covered with borax and landed on a hill covered with mats and carpets topped with straw and borax".|$|E
500|$|Situated around [...] from Cortina, near Zuel, the [...] "Italia" [...] Jump (Trampolino Olimpico Italia) was {{originally}} built in 1923 as the [...] "Franchetti" [...] Jump. After modifications in 1926, the first structure was demolished in 1939 and rebuilt in 1940. With the 1956 Games coming to Cortina, the jump {{had to be}} updated again {{to comply with the}} technical demands of the Olympics. On April 15, 1955, the [...] "Franchetti" [...] Jump was finally demolished and the new [...] "Italia Jump" [...] was completed in the same year at a cost of nearly ITL310million ($500,000). The reinforced concrete platform was [...] high, and possessed a [...] long, 35° steep <b>in-run.</b> Two grandstands, each with a capacity for 3,000 people, were placed {{on either side of the}} landing slope; a natural amphiteatre at the bottom of the hill could hold up to 40,000 standing spectators. A special road was built between Cortina and the venue for the transport of athletes, officials and authorities.|$|E

2500|$|Following the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships 1940 being {{awarded to}} Oslo, the Association for the Promotion of Skiing {{decided to build}} a larger <b>in-run.</b> Construction started in 1938 and {{consisted}} of a [...] tall <b>in-run</b> tower. The take-off was moved [...] further back and [...] higher. The new structure was inaugurated in 1940, although the World Championships were canceled due to the Second World War. The venue was subsequently left unused for five years during the German occupation of Norway. German forces used the hill as a site for anti-aircraft artillery and the <b>in-run</b> was painted green. In 1945, the venue received a new upgrade, this time with new grandstands and a larger profile.|$|E
2500|$|During the 1910s it {{had become}} common in the United States to build jumps with a {{scaffold}} superstructure for the <b>in-run,</b> and this had been described as an abomination in the Norwegian press. Prior to the 1914 season, a [...] tall steel superstructure was built. This resulted in massive negative reactions in the press, {{and it was the}} public's opinion that ski jumping was to be done in natural hills. The same year, two other major Norwegian hills received similar structures, Nydalsbakken and Solbergbakken. The first trials were made on 15 January, giving jumps 34meters. This was regarded as the furthest anyone would jump. The hill was subsequently expanded slightly a few times afterwards, including blasting it steeper, chopping it wider, and covering the landing slope with earth and sowing grass to improve the profile.|$|E
2500|$|The new hill has a hill size of 134meteres and K-spot of 120meteres. The steepest {{part of the}} {{landings}} slope is 35.7 degrees, {{which is}} [...] from the take-off. The angle at the hill size point is 30.8 degrees, while {{the width of the}} landing slope is [...] The <b>in-run,</b> built of steel, is [...] long, which is 36 degrees at the steepest. The take-off is [...] tall. The height distance from take-off to the K-point is [...] The grandstands are made of steel and concrete, and include VIP facilities. It is the only hill in the world with a permanent wind screen built as part of the designed construction, and the only steel jump in the world. The hill is [...] above mean sea level. The venue is owned by Oslo Municipality and operated by the Association for the Promotion of Skiing.|$|E
2500|$|The Robotron {{system was}} found to be unreliable, and was taken out of use in 1986. In 1990, a {{porcelain}} track was laid in the <b>in-run.</b> An aluminum stage was also built across the off-run, which could be used for concerts during the summer. In 1992, the hill was further expanded by digging down another [...] This increased the K-point from 105 to 110. From 1992, the venue used a system of video still images to determine the length. Following the decision to upgrade the hill in 1991, Kollenhopp was established. A cooperation between the ski jumping clubs in Eastern Norway, it was to create more jumping activity in Holmenkollbakken, similar to the success of Trønderhopp. From 1992, the hill received floodlighting, allowing events to be scheduled into the evening, and the organizers able to move events to the evening, if wind conditions were not good during the day.|$|E
2500|$|In 1979, Oslo {{was awarded}} the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships 1982, and further {{upgrades}} to the hill were necessary. The costs of the upgrades were NOK50 million, of which the Norwegian Ski Federation paid NOK5 million, and Oslo Municipality and the state split the rest. The large expenditures resulted in a public debate. The upgrades saw the introduction of electronics into {{most parts of the}} venue. The old system of manual distance measurement by people standing beside the hill was abolished, and replaced by the video-based system Robotron. Other new installations was an electronic result and scoreboard system, a new time-keeping and speed system, and a new central system to calculate scores. The <b>in-run</b> was expanded, and a mobile start platform was installed, but later removed and replaced by a bar. The knoll and landing slope were adjusted, and the straight section was moved [...] further down. In the transition to the out-run, [...] of earthwork was blasted away, and Besserudkjernet was sunk another [...] This allowed for additional grandstands to be built and the last wooden grandstands were removed. New structures were built for delegates, broadcasting and the jury.|$|E
2500|$|In 1948, Oslo {{was awarded}} to host the 1952 Winter Olympics. This caused a bonanza of plans, one {{superseding}} the other. Until then, the grandstand {{on the sides of}} the hill had been temporary; prior to the Olympics these were rebuilt as permanent. A new grandstand was built, a jury tower was constructed, as was facilities for the delegates, the royal family and radio broadcasting. The <b>in-run</b> was rebuilt; while it previously had been a mess of open, wooden structures, it was shelled in, painted white and received an elevator. The hill had to be expanded, and to allow this, the landing slope needed to be lifted by being built as an artificial structure. Below the lifted part of the hill was built a three-story building, with the ski museum in the lower two floors and a restaurant in the top floor. The lake was dug [...] deep and made a swimming pool during the summer. The upgrades cost NOK1.5 million, paid for by Oslo Municipality. These upgrades resulted in an artificial lake being constructed in the off-run, which became a recreational and swimming venue for the city's residents. The lake was at the time [...] deep and had a typical temperature of [...] Oslo had a failed bid for the 1968 Winter Olympics.|$|E

50|$|The top of {{the hill}} is the start. This allows the jury to {{regulate}} the speed of the jumpers in varying wind conditions, by shortening or lengthening the distance along the <b>in-run.</b> The platform has a bar across it, which the jumper sits on. By leaning forward, the jumper will naturally start to glide down the prepared tracks along the <b>in-run.</b> The <b>in-run</b> normally has an angle of 38 to 36 degrees, which then curves into a transition; {{the last part of the}} <b>in-run,</b> the take-off, typically has an angle between 7 and 12 degrees downhill. The landing slope has a smooth curve which closely follows the profile of the ski jump; this means that the skier is never more than about 6 m above the ground. The skier will land on the landing slope, and the rules allow jumpers to land up to ten percent past the construction point. Past the landing slope is the outrun, which is either flat or even uphill, where the skier can slow down. The speed of the skier is normally measured about 10 m before the end of the takeoff; jumpers can reach speeds of 95 km/h on large hills and 105 km/h on ski flying hills.|$|E
50|$|The first hill had {{a length}} {{from the top}} of the <b>in-run</b> to the bottom of the out-run of 425 m and an {{elevation}} difference of 130 m. The <b>in-run</b> was 115 m long and had an elevation difference of 46 m. The hill was inaugurated on 29 January 1936 with a 50-meter jump by Birger Henriksen. The longest jump on the opening day was made by Reidar Andersen, who jumped 86 meters. At the most he was 10 to 12 m above the landing slope, so the take-off was lowered 40 cm from 6 to 11 degrees.|$|E
50|$|The main {{logistical}} {{issue with}} the events was the poor transport service, with only a narrow road to the hill. During the 1950s, the attendance rose well beyond the former 5,000, forcing the road to upgraded in 1955. By the 1950s, ski jumps were being built larger and in 1954, Kristian Hovde proposed to expand Vikersundbakken, which he hoped would allow jumps of 100 m. The plans were passed by the club's annual meeting on 13 September, with construction starting {{in the summer of}} 1955. The lower part of the landing slope was dug down 1.75 m, the <b>in-run</b> was raised up to 85 cm and a new jury tower and stairway was built. Additional expansion was passed on 27 April 1956: a 12 m tall scaffolding <b>in-run</b> was built on top of the old <b>in-run.</b> The hill was designed by Carl Borgen. Contractors were Brødrene Teigen and since the club did not have sufficient funds, they were willing to wait with the payment until they had. The new hill was inaugurated on 10 March 1956.|$|E
50|$|Ski jumping {{can also}} be {{performed}} in the summer on an <b>in-run</b> where the tracks are made from porcelain and the grass on the slope is covered with plastic, combined with water. The highest level summer competition is the FIS Ski Jumping Grand Prix, contested since 1994.|$|E
50|$|During summer, the old hill had a lake, {{which made}} it {{possible}} to use the amphitheater for concerts, plays and entertainment. The venue was then often referred to as Sommerkollen. From 1963, a temporary, small <b>in-run</b> was built down the southern grandstand, which allowed skiers and divers to make a jump and land in the water. Between 1963 and 1983, a competition was held nine times. Starting in 1983 was Ta sjansen, which was televised annually by the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation and became Sommerkollen's most popular show. It was an informal competition with two main events: one where a home-made craft was to first slide down a short <b>in-run</b> and then slide along the water surface to hit a mounted bell in the shortest possible time. The other was a cycling competition where the cyclist had to complete a track on a wobbly floating wharf.|$|E
50|$|Water ramps into {{oversized}} pools, ponds, or lakes {{are constructed}} as training locations for aerial skiing, mogul skiing, and snowboarding acrobatics events. Such structures typically comprise three sections, <b>in-run,</b> a kicker, and a water surface for landing. They permit {{the practice of}} new skills with reduced risk, as {{the impact of a}} water landing is less dangerous than a comparable impact on compacted snow.|$|E
