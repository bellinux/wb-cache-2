40|$|International audienceThe paper {{outlines}} the crucial contributions of James Clerk Maxwell to Physics and more generally to our {{vision of the}} world. He achieved 150 years ago a synthesis of the pioneering works in magnetostatics, <b>electrostatics,</b> <b>induction</b> and, by introducing the notion of displacement current, gave birth to Electromagnetics. Then, he deduced the existence of electromagnetic waves and identified light as one of them. Maxwell equations deeply changed a Newtonian conception of the world based on particle interactions by pointing out the vital role of waves in physics. This new conception had a strong influence {{on the development of}} quantum physics. Finally, the invariance of light velocity in Galilean frames led to Lorentz transformations, a key step toward the theory of relativity...|$|R

[...] The transmitter and receiver electrodes form a capacitor, with the intervening space as the dielectric. [...] An alternating voltage generated by the transmitter {{is applied to the}} transmitting plate, and the oscillating electric field induces an alternating potential on the receiver plate by <b>electrostatic</b> <b>induction,</b> which causes an alternating current to flow in the load circuit. [...] The amount of power transferred increases with the frequency the square of the voltage, and the capacitance between the plates, which is proportional to the area of the smaller plate and (for short distances) inversely proportional to the separation.|$|E

40|$|The {{fundamental}} {{aspects of}} N 2 and 0 2 adsorption in zeolites {{have been investigated}} by density functional calculations on different models. Simple systems where these molecules interact with a positive point charge or with isolated Li+ and Na+ cations {{have led to a}} qualitative explanation for the N 2 / 02 separation process. A classical description involving <b>electrostatic</b> and <b>induction</b> energies is adequate to explain the basic reason for a stronger N 2 adsorption. At short distances (bonding interaction), the electronic structure of the cation has to be taken into account. The presence of core electrons in large cations limits the stabilizing contribution of the <b>electrostatic</b> and <b>induction</b> terms to the total energy, implying that Li+ is more efficient than Na+ in the adsorption process. The presence of zeolite clusters decreases the binding energies for both N 2 and 0 2, but the main trends remain valid.

2500|$|<b>Electrostatic</b> <b>induction,</b> {{discovered}} by British scientist John Canton in 1753 and Swedish professor Johan Carl Wilcke in 1762 is a redistribution of charges in an object {{caused by the}} electric field of a nearby charge. [...] For example, if a positively charged object is brought near an uncharged metal object, the mobile negatively-charged electrons in the metal will be attracted the external charge, {{and move to the}} side of the metal facing it, creating a negative charge on the surface. [...] When the electrons move out of an area they leave a positive charge due to the metal atoms' nuclei, so the side of the metal object facing away from the charge acquires a positive charge. These induced charges disappear when the external charge is removed. [...] Induction is also responsible for the attraction of light objects, such as balloons, paper scraps and styrofoam packing peanuts to static charges. [...] The surface charges induced in conductive objects exactly cancel external electric fields inside the conductor, so there is no electric field inside a metal object. [...] This is the basis for the electric field shielding action of a Faraday cage. [...] Since the electric field is the gradient of the voltage, <b>electrostatic</b> <b>induction</b> is also responsible for making the electric potential (voltage) constant throughout a conductive object.|$|E
2500|$|An {{electrostatic}} generator, or electrostatic machine, is an electromechanical generator {{that produces}} static electricity, or electricity at high voltage and low continuous current. The knowledge of static electricity {{dates back to}} the earliest civilizations, but for millennia it remained merely an interesting and mystifying phenomenon, without a theory to explain its behavior and often confused with magnetism. By the end of the 17th century, researchers had developed practical means of generating electricity by friction, but the development of electrostatic machines did not begin in earnest until the 18th century, when they became fundamental instruments in the studies about the new science of electricity. Electrostatic generators operate by using manual (or other) power to transform mechanical work into electric energy. Electrostatic generators develop electrostatic charges of opposite signs rendered to two conductors, using only electric forces, and work by using moving plates, drums, or belts to carry electric charge to a high potential electrode. [...] The charge is generated by one of two methods: either the triboelectric effect (friction) or <b>electrostatic</b> <b>induction.</b>|$|E
40|$|International audienceA {{strategy}} that incorporates in the macromolecular, non-polarizable CHARMM force field models of atomic charges and polarizabilities determined from high-level quantum mechanical calculations is probed in the paradigmatic case of metal ion complexes. Although the ab initio polarizable potential energy function {{is capable of}} hierarchizing correctly the affinity of a divalent calcium ion for three distinct electron-donor chelating agents, severe inaccuracies in the underlying contributions to the total binding energy, compared to a reference symmetry-adapted perturbation theory (SAPT) expansion, illuminate the incompleteness of the interaction model. The reported calculations suggest that mapping faithfully the signature <b>electrostatic</b> potential and <b>induction</b> energy of the isolated species is a necessary, albeit not sufficient condition to guarantee that intermolecular interactions be described accurately when key physical phenomena are evidently missing from a force field to which explicit induction effects have been introduced. They further suggest that in the present strategy, naive attempts to correct the flawed reproduction of the <b>electrostatic</b> and <b>induction</b> terms of the perturbative expansion [...] - rooted, for instance, in an inappropriate representation of electron-cloud penetration [...] - through de novo parametrization of the mathematically questionable " 6 - 12 '' form of the van der Waals potential, common to many macromolecular force fields, are unavoidably bound to failure...|$|R

2500|$|In 1878, the British {{inventor}} James Wimshurst {{started his}} studies about electrostatic generators, improving the Holtz machine, {{in a powerful}} version with multiple disks. The classical Wimshurst machine, that became the most popular form of influence machine, was reported to the scientific community by 1883, although previous machines with very similar structures were previously described by Holtz and Musaeus. [...] In 1885, one of the largest-ever Wimshurst machines was built in England (it {{is now at the}} Chicago Museum of Science and Industry). The Wimshurst machine is a considerably simple machine; it works, as all influence machines, with <b>electrostatic</b> <b>induction</b> of charges, which means that it uses even the slightest existing charge to create and accumulate more charges, and repeats this process {{for as long as the}} machine is in action. Wimshurst machines are composed of: two insulated disks attached to pulleys of opposite rotation, the disks have small conductive (usually metal) plates on their outward-facing sides; two double-ended brushes that serve as charge stabilizers and are also the place where induction happens, creating the new charges to be collected; two pairs of collecting combs, which are, as the name implies, the collectors of electrical charge produced by the machine; two Leyden Jars, the capacitors of the machine; a pair of electrodes, for the transfer of charges once they have been sufficiently accumulated. The simple structure and components of the Wimshurst Machine make it a common choice for a homemade electrostatic experiment or demonstration, these characteristics were factors that contributed to its popularity, as previously mentioned.|$|E
