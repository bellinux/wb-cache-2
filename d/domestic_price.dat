The empirical analysis is based on data from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations for 58 countries for 1968 - 78 and for the countries of the European Community for 1961 - 85. The results show that most of the variations in world prices are transmitted and that they constitute the dominant component in the variations of <b>domestic</b> <b>prices.</b> Agricultural products are on the whole tradable, and every country trades in some agricultural products.

The problem is even more crucial when examining crisis related redistributive effects associated with relative price changes.

In the paper we examine exchange rate pass-through to <b>domestic</b> <b>prices</b> in the Euro Area member countries to examine crucial implications of the nominal exchange rate rigidity. Our results indicate that absorption capabilities of nominal effective exchange rates clearly differ in individual countries.

500|$|Brownlee {{remained}} {{intimately involved}} in the grain industry even outside the UGG, in part through {{his position on the}} Canadian Federation of Agriculture executive. [...] In this capacity, he found himself {{in the middle of a}} controversy over the British Wheat Agreement (BWA). [...] The BWA was an agreement to sell wheat to British clients at a fixed price over a four-year period. [...] The price was to be adjusted during the following two years, [...] "having regard to" [...] world wheat prices. [...] During the first four years, world wheat prices were continually above the price stipulated in the agreement, breeding resentment towards the British, especially since they sold much of this fixed price wheat for a large profit in European markets. [...] This was exacerbated when the British refused to adjust the price upwards for the last two years, on the grounds that there was nothing in the agreement to compel them to do so. [...] The result was considerable ill will and a loss by grain farmers of an estimated $350 million. [...] The federal government, which had negotiated the agreement, offered to supplement the British payments by $65 million, a sum large enough to raise the ire of eastern Canadians but too small to placate western farmers. [...] Brownlee, who had opposed the agreement, authorized a purchase of advertising across the country pointing out that the government fixed the <b>domestic</b> <b>price</b> of wheat at $0.77 per bushel while the world price reached as high as $2.18. [...] In Brownlee's view, the $65 million payment by the government paled in comparison to the benefit to consumers of the federal policy. [...] Subsequent international agreements, for which Brownlee acted as an advisor to the Canadian delegation, resulted in more favourable terms for farmers. [...] Brownlee's continued status as one of the grain industry's leading figures was also exhibited by his involvement in government relations. [...] He appeared before the Canadian House of Commons Standing Committee on Agriculture to oppose a system of allocating box cars to each grain elevator by formula, favouring instead a system whereby the Canadian Wheat Board retained the flexibility to assign them as it saw fit. [...] In his September 1960 submission to the Royal Commission on Transportation, In Defense of the Crow's Nest Pass Rates, he rejected the railways' calls to deregulate the rates they charged for the shipment of grain.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine two factors, gold {{production}} and export prices, that have been suggested as having aided Australia's escape from the deflation it faced in the early 1890 s. In order to examine the factors influencing Australian <b>domestic</b> <b>prices</b> in the second half of the nineteenth century, annual data over the period 1861 - 1900 are used to estimate a structural vector autoregression. Causality tests in a reduced form vector autoregression suggest that two factors Granger cause the movements in Australian <b>domestic</b> <b>prices,</b> namely export prices and net exports. In contrast, movements in gold production in Australia do not significantly directly cause Australian <b>domestic</b> <b>prices,</b> but have some indirect effect through the interest rate and net exports. Impulse response functions computed from the structural vector autoregression suggest that shocks in export prices lead to a rise in <b>domestic</b> <b>prices,</b> but shocks in gold production do not. Perhaps surprisingly, an export price shock leads to a fall in net exports in the medium term. Changes in capital flows would appear to be an important adjustment channel. ...|$|R
