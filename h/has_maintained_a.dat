5|$|The bobcat {{has long}} been valued both for fur and sport; it has been hunted and trapped by humans, but <b>has</b> <b>maintained</b> <b>a</b> high population, even in the {{southern}} United States, where it is extensively hunted. In the 1970s and 1980s, an unprecedented rise in price for bobcat fur caused further interest in hunting, but by the early 1990s, prices had dropped significantly. Regulated hunting still continues, with half of mortality of some populations being attributed to this cause. As a result, the rate of bobcat deaths is skewed in winter, when hunting season is generally open.|$|E

5|$|The same {{social forces}} that had built these resorts {{in the nineteenth}} century proved to be their undoing in the twentieth.

5|$|From the 12th century until 1868, Japan {{was ruled}} by {{successive}} feudal military shoguns who ruled {{in the name}} of the Emperor. Japan entered into a long period of isolation in the early 17th century, which was ended in 1853 when a United States fleet pressured Japan to open to the West. After nearly two decades of internal conflict and insurrection, the Imperial Court regained its political power in 1868 through the help of several clans from Chōshū and Satsuma—and the Empire of Japan was established. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, victories in the First Sino-Japanese War, the Russo-Japanese War and World War I allowed Japan to expand its empire during a period of increasing militarism. The Second Sino-Japanese War of 1937 expanded into part of World War II in 1941, which came to an end in 1945 following the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the Japanese surrender. Since adopting its revised constitution on May 3, 1947, during the occupation by the SCAP, Japan <b>has</b> <b>maintained</b> <b>a</b> unitary parliamentary constitutional monarchy with an Emperor and an elected legislature called the National Diet.|$|E

Crime rates in Phoenix have gone down in recent years, and once troubled, decaying neighborhoods such as South Mountain, Alhambra, and Maryvale have recovered and stabilized. Recently, downtown Phoenix and the central core have experienced renewed interest and growth, resulting in numerous restaurants, stores, and businesses opening or relocating to central Phoenix.|$|E
