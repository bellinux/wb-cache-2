40|$|Abstract — <b>Airbag</b> <b>deployment</b> {{has been}} known to be {{responsible}} for huge death, incidental injuries and broken bones due to low crash severity and wrong deployment decisions. Therefore, the authorities and industries have been looking for more innovative and intelligent products to be realized for future enhancements in the vehicle safety systems (VSSs). Although the VSSs technologies have advanced considerably, they still face challenges such as how to avoid unnecessary and untimely <b>airbag</b> <b>deployments</b> that can be hazardous and fatal. Currently, most of the existing airbag systems deploy without regard to occupant size and position. As such, this paper will focus on the occupant and crash sensing performances due to frontal collisions for the new breed of so called smart airbag systems. It intends to provide a thorough discussion relating to the occupancy detection, occupant size classification, occupant off-position detection to determine safe distance zone for <b>airbag</b> <b>deployment,</b> crash-severity analysis and airbag decision algorithms via a computer modeling. The proposed system model consists of three main modules namely, occupant sensing, crash severity analysis and decision fusion. The occupant sensing system module utilizes the weight sensor to determine occupancy, classify the occupant size, and determine occupant off-position condition to compute safe distance for <b>airbag</b> <b>deployment.</b> The crash severity analysis module is used to generate relevant information pertinent to <b>airbag</b> <b>deployment</b> decision. Outputs from these two modules are fused to the decision module for correct and efficient <b>airbag</b> <b>deployment</b> action. Computer modeling work is carried out using Simulink, Stateflow, SimMechanics and Virtual Reality toolboxes.

40|$|Motor vehicle airbag {{technology}} {{is directed at}} the reduction of injury to drivers and passengers however {{a number of researchers}} have reported cases of injuries caused by airbags. Injuries to tooth surfaces, particularly tooth wear following the deployment of motor vehicle airbags, have never been studied. A review of the literature and clinical experience does not suggest tooth enamel abrasion to be a likely outcome following <b>airbag</b> <b>deployment.</b> This in vitro pilot study was conducted to assess the effect on tooth surfaces following the deployment of motor vehicle airbags, and in particular to attempt to reproduce the injuries claimed in a case report published in the Journal of Forensic Odonto-Stomatology in December 2007. A sample of extracted upper anterior teeth (n = 20) were analyzed using unaided visual observation, photographic and microscopic observation pre- and post- <b>airbag</b> <b>deployment.</b> Teeth were mounted on a fabricated head form (similar to those used in crash test dummies) using dental putty. The tests were performed using a modified airbag test rig with airbags deployed in 5 different positions relative to the head, with respect to distance and angulations. The result of the tests showed no changes to the teeth with unaided observation, macro photography or under the microscope. Tooth wear patterns described in the case report were not observed. Although accurate reproduction of an in vivo situation is not possible, this study has given some insight into the effects of motor vehicle <b>airbag</b> <b>deployment,</b> and suggests that significant tooth wear is an unlikely outcome from <b>airbag</b> <b>deployment.</b> A Ashar, H James, D Higgins, J Kaidonis, RWG Anderso...|$|R

40|$|During {{the last}} decade the {{simulation}} of the <b>airbag</b> <b>deployment</b> process has become a standard application of explicit finite element codes. At {{the beginning of the}} development the focus was to capture the influence and improve the results of dummy impact on fully inflated <b>airbags.</b> Later the <b>deployment</b> kinematics of folded airbags, different folding techniques and vent-hole design became more and more important. With the requirement to comply with FMVSS 208, i. e. Out-of-Position load cases, it became apparently necessary to include the interaction between the internal gas flow and the fabric airbag structure. Hence coupled algorithms that allow for interaction between the discretized gas flow and the airbag structure were the main focus during the past five years.

40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. As {{in-vehicle}} safety technology becomes more prevalent, the corresponding fitment of side airbags in the United Kingdom {{is now more}} commonplace. This study adds {{to the body of}} knowledge on real world impacts by presenting initial cases of deployment from the UK, including examples where there is some suggestion that side <b>airbag</b> <b>deployment</b> may have contributed to injury outcomes. With the introduction of new restraint devices into the vehicle fleet, manufacturers and engineers are not only eager to quantify their benefit and injury mitigation effectiveness but to also consider the performance and application in the real world. Whilst there are presently insufficient numbers of cases to fully evaluate injury benefit in side impacts, individual case evaluations can provide an initial assessment of side airbag field performance. In this study, data from 47 crashes in which the side airbag deployed were available for analysis. Of these, 19 occupants sustained a MAIS ≥ 2 injury. Case reviews have identified 2 occupants where serious (AIS 3) thoracic injuries may have occurred through interaction with the deploying side airbag and a further case involving upper extremity fracture (AIS 3) was also thought to have been associated with side <b>airbag</b> <b>deployment.</b> In these 3 cases, crash severity and compartmental deformation were not considered to be extensive.
