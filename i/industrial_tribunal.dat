5|$|At {{the age of}} 83 Nagle {{was still}} {{pursuing}} gender equality, accusing the Kennel Club of sexual discrimination in their insistence on male-only membership and taking them to court over the matter. After the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 was enacted, Nagle was proposed {{as a member of}} the Kennel Club at the end of September 1977; the nomination was refused in January 1978 because the Kennel Club's constitution restricted membership to men only. Nagle referred the matter to an <b>Industrial</b> <b>Tribunal</b> five months later. She was Chairwoman of the Ladies Joint Committee, a group set up in 1975 as a part of the Kennel Club hierarchy, but the committee was not allowed any input into general club decisions. Her actions against the club were fully supported by the other members of the Ladies Committee. Legal technicalities caused the tribunal to reject the case, but it recommended that the Equal Opportunities Commission should be approached as discrimination was clearly demonstrated. Nagle was determined and stated her intention to appeal the decision. Leonard Pagliero was Chairman of the Kennel Club at the time, and before Nagle was able to complete the appeal he contacted the canine press, Dog World and Our Dogs, on 8 September 1978 announcing that the Club's General Committee was recommending that the club's constitution be changed to allow women members. The proposal was carried unanimously at a meeting held on 23 November 1978. The result was that Nagle and many other ladies were accepted as members of the Kennel Club at a formal meeting held on 10 April 1979. The total number of women approved for membership at the landmark meeting was 80; the costs of the campaign were funded by Nagle.|$|E
25|$|In 1983, {{when the}} UK {{government}} requisitioned civilian ships for the Falklands War, three British-registered sailors of Somali origin were denied employment {{on the basis}} of skin colour. This was upheld as unlawful by an <b>industrial</b> <b>tribunal</b> and an appeal court, and the case contributed to considerable focus in the media on the issue of racism in the British shipping industry. The shipping industry had been outside of the remit of the 1976 Race Relations Act, and discrimination within the industry was significant. In 1983, 90 per cent of Somali seamen living in Cardiff were unemployed.|$|E

These independent panels heard and made legally binding rulings in relation to employment law disputes. Under the Employment Rights (Dispute Resolution) Act 1998, their name was changed to employment tribunals from 1 August 1998. Employment Tribunals continue to perform the same function as the <b>Industrial</b> <b>Tribunals.</b>|$|R

He briefly joined the committee after his retirement and ruffled a few feathers with his support for Les Bentley, the head groundsman sacked in 1982 who unsuccessfully took the club to an <b>industrial</b> <b>tribunal</b> alleging unfair dismissal.

He claimed wrongful dismissal against the club at an <b>industrial</b> <b>tribunal</b> but lost and was given no leave to appeal. According to a Billy Adams Sunday Herald article on 30 May 1999, the official version is that Ferguson was sacked for various breaches of contract including unauthorised payments to players. He was counter-accused of intimidating behaviour towards his office secretary because he wanted players to get some expenses tax free. He did not speak to her for six weeks, confiscated her keys and communicated only through a 17-year-old assistant. The tribunal concluded that Ferguson was [...] "particularly petty" [...] and [...] "immature". It was claimed during the tribunal by St Mirren chairman, Willie Todd, that Ferguson had [...] "no managerial ability".|$|E

40|$|This chapter {{seeks to}} apply ‘new’ {{regulation}} theory to <b>industrial</b> <b>tribunals,</b> in par-ticular the functions and {{powers of the}} Australian Industrial Relations Commission (AIRC) in relation to enterprise bargaining {{and the making of}} collec-tive workplace agreements. In a conventional economic sense, <b>industrial</b> <b>tribunals</b> have always been regulatory agencies, with their awards operating as labour standards setting minimum pay and conditions. Since the 1990 s, though, the major work and impact of <b>industrial</b> <b>tribunals</b> has changed from making awards to the facilitation and approval of agreements as {{part of the process of}} labour market “deregulation. ” As (at the time of final revision of this paper) it now appears that any powers of the AIRC to supervise agreement-making will shortly and finally be abolished, we are in a position to review the particular ap-proach adopted for the regulation of workplace bargaining over the last decade. If <b>industrial</b> <b>tribunals</b> will no longer have a regulatory role to play in the setting of conditions by agreements, the opportunity also arises for us to consider what new type of institution might now be appropriate for the inevitable regulation which occurs within the labour market...|$|R
