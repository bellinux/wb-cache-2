6000|$|Now {{when the}} son of Sir Nabon {{perceived}} how {{that his father was}} slain, he shrieked like a woman.

5|$|Another {{featured}} preliminary match involved Shawn Michaels and Chris Jericho in a singles match.

On the April 28 episode of Raw, Jericho claimed that Michaels faked <b>his</b> <b>knee</b> injury {{to allow him to}} defeat Batista at Backlash, a claim that Michaels denied. The following week, it was announced that Jericho would face Michaels in a singles match at Judgment Day. On the May 12 episode of Raw, Jericho offered his apologies to Michaels for accusing him of feigning an injury, as well as giving Michaels the opportunity to back out of their match.

5|$|At Simpson's next race, the four-day Grand Prix d'Eibar, {{his first}} in Spain, <b>his</b> <b>knee</b> injury still bothered him. He won the second stage, but {{was forced to}} quit during the {{following}} stage. His injury had not healed, even after treatment by various specialists, but for financial reasons {{he was forced to}} enter the Tour de France with the British team. He abandoned on stage three, which started in Roubaix, struggling to pedal on the cobbles. Three months after his fall at Paris–Roubaix he saw a doctor at St. Michael's Hospital in Paris. He gave Simpson injections in <b>his</b> <b>knee,</b> which reduced the inflammation. Once healed, he competed in the road world championships in Berne, Switzerland. On the track he qualified for the individual pursuit with the fourth-fastest time, losing in the quarter-finals to Peter Post of the Netherlands. In the road race, Simpson was part of a seventeen-rider breakaway that finished together in a sprint; he crossed the line in ninth place.|$|E

5|$|Before his {{match with}} Bret Hart, Lawler {{introduced}} a woman obviously younger than himself as his mother, and wished her a happy Mother's Day.

While Hebner was tied upside down, Hakushi interfered and performed a diving headbutt to Hart. Lawler won the match when he rolled-up Hart for the pinfall.|$|E
60|$|Crossing <b>his</b> <b>knees,</b> he bent a supercilious glance on Mr. Polteed.|$|R

60|$|The {{rest was}} lost in inarticulate mutterings. The old man sank upon <b>his</b> <b>knees,</b> <b>his</b> knife in his hand, and bent himself over the moaning boy.|$|R
