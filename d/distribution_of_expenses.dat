In the thesis, analysis of the problems regarding small reservoirs, {{with a sample of}} reservoir Savci, is given from three points of view: spatial placement of the reservoir, determining available volume by analysing as many relevant information as possible and analysing accordance with the Regulation of operating and maintaining. Content of some of the spatial acts was found to be incomplete, so the recommendations and suggestions for improvement of those are given. The analysis of available volume of reservoir Savci shows average quantity of water that is disposable by month. Results of calculation show water shortage in the period from April to October. I suggest analysis of demands of primary/subordinated uses of water reservoir according to the available volume that would determine a caretaker and an ultimate user, by arranging interpersonal relations between existing users and possibilities of potential uses. The analysis of state of the reservoir Savci and how it functions separately by the elements of reservoir (barrier, weir, basic release with equipment…) gave me a separate view of missing content in the regulation.

40|$|Since 2007, Burkina Faso has subsidized 80 % of {{the costs}} of child birth. Women are {{required}} to pay 20 % (900 F CFA = 1. 4 Euros), except for the indigent, who are supposed to be exempted. The objective of the policy is to increase service utilization and reduce costs for households. We analyze the efficacy of the policy and the distribution of its benefits. The study was carried out in Ouargaye district. The analysis was based on two distinct cross-sectional household surveys, conducted before (2006; n = 1170) and after (2010; n = 905) the policy, of all women who had had a vaginal delivery in a public health centre. Medical expenses for delivery decreased from a median of 4, 060 F CFA in 2006 to 900 F CFA in 2010 (p, 0. 001). There was pronounced contraction in the <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>expenses</b> and a reduction in interquartile range. Total expenses for delivery went from a median of 7, 366 F CFA in 2006 to 4, 750 F CFA in 2010 (p = 0. 001). There was no exacerbation of the initial inequalities of the share in consumption after the policy. The distribution of benefits for medical expenses showed a progressive evolution. The greatest reduction in risk of excessive expenses was seen in women in the bottom quintile living less than 5 km from the health centres. Only 10 % of those in the poorest quintile were exempted. The subsidy policy was more effective in Burkina Faso than in other African countries. All categories of the population benefited from this policy, including the poorest. Yet despite the subsidy, women still carry a significant cost burden; half of them pay more than they should, and few indigents are fully exempted.

30|$|FiT schemes {{originated}} in the United States and gained considerable traction in Europe from the early 1990 s as {{an effective means of}} stimulating renewable energy deployment [16, 19]. However, the potential for market distortions and negative impacts on consumers from subsidies granted to renewable energy sources has led to a trend in renewable energy policy design away from standard FiTs and increasingly toward auctions [1]. The number of countries that have adopted renewable energy auctions increased from 6 in 2005 to at least 60 by early 2015 and auctions have been a major contributor to the nearly 80 % reduction in contracted power purchase agreement (PPA) prices for utility-scale solar PV between 2010 and 2016 [21]. Because, however, auctions are most relevant to utility-scale projects, hybrid policy mechanisms are evolving that support deployment of renewables at multiple scales via new combinations and variations of traditional price, quantity and access-based policy mechanisms. Hybrid policies are aimed at addressing strategic interests such as supporting a diversity of renewable energy investors and project sizes, balancing markets where self-consumption of renewable energy has become less expensive than consuming electricity from the grid (i.e. “socket-parity” has been achieved) and integrating renewable electricity technologies into wholesale spot markets [17, 22, 23]. Furthermore, as the share of intermittent renewable energy achieves higher levels in electricity systems, policies are evolving to account for the full system level costs incurred by intermittent renewables as opposed to just levelized costs of electricity (LCOEs), which often are calculated without consideration of wider system impacts. System level assessments are geographically specific and bring an important understanding of the true lifecycle costs of intermittent renewable energy [24, 25]. In fact, system level considerations are leading to the convergence of electricity tariff and renewable energy policy design as the adoption of distributed renewables is increasingly impacting electricity system costs as well as the <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>expenses</b> among electricity market rate-payers [26].|$|E

Secondary data obtained from the AHA Annual Surveys (1991 - 1998) are applied to examine the <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>expense</b> preference' parameters for all contract management adopters both pre- and post-adoption.

40|$|Liability {{insurance}} in claims disputes 1. Object of the Study Liability insurances have {{a central role}} in the control of damage and liability. Among other things, liability insurances have an effect on the cover of those suffering the damage, compensation norms and compensation practices. The liability for damages is also of special nature as an insurance risk, since it requires the acknowledgement of a normative legal relationship, i. e. liability for compensation. The developmental span of an insured event can be remarkably long and extend from the act which caused the damage to the res judicata award of damages. Despite the significance and the special nature of liability insurances, it has not been the subject of actual insurance law studies published in Finland. The purpose of this study is, for its own part, to make up for this deficiency. In particular, the study focuses on problems during the stage of filing insurance claims. The study investigates the relationship of the insurer and the insured from three different thematic perspectives, these being: 1) the legal repercussions and requirements of an insurer s claims settlement decision, 2) the insurer s right to control the insured event and 3) the <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>expenses</b> between the insurer and the insured. Each of these segments is divided into several individual legal questions, of which interpretational recommendations will be made. These more particularised questions will also be subjected to evaluations on how well the Finnish Insurance Contracts Act (ICA) accounts for the special characteristics of general liability insurances and how the established terms and conditions of insurance policies relate to the said Act s provisions. In spite of the focus on general liability insurance, this approach enables the evaluation of several questions of a general significance with regard to insurance law. The status of the damaged party will mainly be looked at only from the perspective of the mutual relationship between the insurer and the insured. The study s scope encompasses both corporate and consumer insurances. It will also take note of the terms and conditions prevalent in the industry and propose interpretational recommendations thereof. The following consists of a markedly simplified summary of this investigation s results. 2. An Insurance Company s Decision-making When deciding upon the payment of insurance compensation against liability insurance, the insurer usually has three options. It can either deny its liability for compensation based on the policy s limitation on liability, approve the claim and pay the settlement, or acknowledge the alleged liability of the insured to fall within the scope of the policy s coverage but deny liability for compensation on the grounds that the insured is not liable for damages. In the latter case, the insurer according to the terms and conditions of the policy is usually obligated to initiate investigations to clarify the insured s liability for damages. The decision-making of the insurer involves a number of issues with legal import, which are discussed in chapter 3. Pursuant to the provisions of section 70 of the Insurance Contracts Act, the insurer is obligated to initiate activities on behalf of the insured. The period of time is calculated on the basis of obtaining the clarification concerning the liability, meaning that settling the claims on behalf of the insured first is not required. The burden of proof is divided according to conventional compensation debt relations so that it is the obligation of the insured to prove that a liability for compensating a third party has arisen, and the obligation of the insurer to prove the grounds for limited liability possibly applicable to the case. In reality, the actual burden of proof concerning the insured s liability for damages in general liability insurances is usually borne by the party claiming damages. From the perspective of the insurer s and the insured's mutual relation, however, the burden of proof rests with the insured. The insurer despite the limitation on liability referred to in section 9 (2) of the Insurance Contracts Act can be found to be liable to compensate the damage, provided that the insured will be granted with a sufficient degree of trust regarding the settlement of claims. An effect of this kind may occur as a result of, e. g. the insurer s continued defence of the insured against the claim for damages while being aware of a limitation-of-liability factor possibly applicable to the case. The insurer is entitled to recover a compensation already paid only in exceptional cases. On the other hand, should such an entitlement arise, the insurer may not only be entitled to recover the actual compensation paid but the costs incurred in the insured s defence, regardless of whether the insurer s liability for costs was originally based on the provision concerning salvage costs as set forth in the Insurance Contracts Act (section 61) or the terms and conditions of the policy. The option of recovery may also arise as a consequence of the insured being found liable to compensate the insurer with the settlement which the latter has had to pay to the party claiming damages without cause. However, the usual prerequisite for recovery is that the insured has provided the insurer with misleading or incorrect information. In principle, the party suffering the damage is not liable to restore the compensation paid solely on the basis of an insurance coverage s inapplicability if the damaged party has been found to be entitled to the damages in the first place. 3. An Insurance Company s Right to Control an Insured Event A liability for compensation may arise through the long-term development of an insured event. This places emphasis on the insurer s need and its possibilities to participate in the control of an insured event in various ways. In practice, the insurer is always entitled to negotiate the compensation with the party claiming damages on the basis of the terms and conditions of the insurance and to take care of the legal proceedings on behalf of the insured. Nonetheless, an insurer s right to control the development of the insured event is often, all things considered, dependent on the interpretation of the norms of insurance law and, on an even wider scale, the definition of the relationship between the insurer and the insured. The purpose of chapter 4 is to evaluate issues relating to this. The problems surfacing in the chapter may have limited significance in connection with other types of insurance, in which the insurer is capable due to the development of the insurance risk of participating in the control of the insured event, in one way or another. The insured always has the ultimate right to decide its own status in a claims matter. The insurer, however, is, regardless of the terms and conditions of the policy, entitled to act on the insured s behalf without limitations even when the insured would be opposed to this, provided that the appropriate handling of the claims issue so demands. In accordance with section 32 of the Insurance Contracts Act, the insurer is entitled to give precautionary guidelines on how to prevent insured events. Should the insured not comply with such guidelines and the damage consequentially expand in scale, the insured will, as a rule, lose its right to compensation. However, in order to be considered binding, the insurer s guidelines must, in addition to being pertinent to the prevention of insured events, also be reasonably predictable as to their outcome. The commitment undertaken by the insurer on behalf of the insured and concerning the grounds for, or the amount of, compensation does not bind the insured, even to the extent of the deductible. Instead, in accordance with Finnish legal praxis (the Supreme Court 1990 : 12), the insured, with certain preconditions fulfilled, can become bound to a commitment concerning the insurer s procedures (the aforementioned ruling involved an extension of the time limit for the tort claim). According to typical insurance terms and conditions, the insurer is entitled to abandon further clarifications on a matter if it can come to agreement on the amount of compensation to be paid with the party suffering the damage, but the insured refuses to accept the settlement. Such terms and conditions also mean that the insurer s aggregate financial liability will be given a maximum limit. What these terms and conditions do not limit, however, is the insurer s liability in case the claim of the third party is clearly unjustified. The insurer nevertheless retains quite an extensive right, starting from the financial encumbrance brought on by legal proceedings, to make decisions as to the risks of litigation also in cases in which there is no certainty that the entered defence would be successful. The insurer s right to control the insured event requires that it receive information of the impending event at a sufficiently early time. However, section 73 of the Insurance Contracts Act does not stipulate that a claim be filed until a year from when the party entitled to compensation has become aware of such a right. The precise time of the commencement of the said period has been unclear with respect to liability insurance. This study recommends based on, inter alia, the judicial practice of the Insurance Complaints Board that the time be calculated from when the insured has become or should have become aware of its possible liability. The terms and conditions of general liability insurances which in practice require a more rapid notice than this are null and void when the Insurance Contracts Act is applied to them as statutory regulation. The terms and conditions determining the procedures of liability insurances, when considering their ultimate purpose, have to be viewed as the precautionary instructions referred to in section 31 of the Insurance Contracts Act. This also means that the insurer may decrease the compensation on the basis of the insured having neglected an obligation pursuant to these terms and conditions only if such negligence has caused damage. The insurer s right to represent the insured in an insurance compensation dispute may yield should the interests of the insurer and the insured be in clear conflict in the procedure. This can take place when, e. g. the insurer is also the claimant (due to, for instance, its right of recourse) or when the success of the claim demands circumstances which simultaneously translate into the application of the limitation of insurance coverage. Furthermore, a conflict of interest may be the consequence of, e. g. the insured having been the subject of other claims as well, the response to which is largely of no consequence or interest to the insurer. 4. The Distribution of Costs Defence against liability claims may result in substantial costs. Moreover, the usefulness of the costs is uncertain if the outcome of the claim is difficult to predict beforehand. Chapter 5 deals with questions relating to this. In particular, attention is given to the duty of salvage of the insured (section 32 of the Insurance Coverage Act) and the related norms concerning the insurer s liability for costs (section 61 of the said Act). As a starting point, the insured s right to receive compensation against salvage costs pursuant to section 61 of the Insurance Contracts Act includes a right to be compensated for legal expenses. According to the legal praxis, the insured s right to compensation also includes such costs which [...] when interpreted in the narrowest sense no longer have an effect on the prevention of liability risks, but which are nonetheless naturally connected to the action that removed the liability risk (Supreme Court 1997 : 51, which concerned costs incurred by the removal of contaminated soil). According to this, compensation is likely to include, for example, the legal costs of the counterparty. Based on the opinion presented in this study, the insured is entitled to full compensation even when the costs benefit responses other than merely the response provided to the grounds concerning the claim. As a principle, the insurer is liable only to the extent of the insured amount. However, according to section 61 of the Insurance Contracts Act, the insurer is responsible for salvage costs exceeding the insured amount. In corporate insurance, the insured amount usually also figures in the costs incurred in the defence against claims. The study proposes that the insurer also carry liability for such excesses of the insured amount which are the result of risk assumption where the insurer has been the sole beneficiary. A situation of the kind may surface, e. g. when the insurer upon exercising its decision-making powers in accordance with the terms and conditions of the insurance contract disputes a draft settlement of the counterparty that has been within the limits of the insured amount, due to which the insured amount is exceeded in the resulting legal proceedings. The liability of the insurer includes the excess of insured amounts resulting from both the extension of a claim and legal expenses. 5. Finally In the context of the Insurance Contracts Act, general liability insurances have been observed largely by regulating the status of the damaged party. From the perspective of the questions studied, however, it can be noted that many issues having an impact on the liability of the insurer and the insured are significant in various ways and that they also have a bearing on the status of the damaged party. In fact, it is a result of the insurance practice that the settings of the claims-phase are often very similar, regardless of whether the procedure is based on a notice filed by the insured itself or on a claim against the insurer filed directly by the damaged party, as set forth in sections 67 or 68 of the Insurance Contracts Act. The Insurance Contracts Act does not contain provisions on all the issues significant from the point of view of general liability insurances. Even to the extent that the Insurance Contracts Act offers a solution to a particular question, the provisions have clearly not been drawn up with situations typical to liability insurances in mind. However, this may not lead to serious problems if the systematics of the Insurance Contracts Act provides sufficient room for insurance type specific interpretations. Some exceptions notwithstanding, the Insurance Contracts Act fulfils this requirement. On the other hand, reasonable interpretations demand that the claim, as an insured event, not be tied down to a single criterion or moment, but that the characteristics of an insurance risk are evaluated separately through the perspective of each norm s objective. Typical insurance terms and conditions largely follow the provisions of the Insurance Contracts Act. However, the terms and conditions pertaining to statutory notifications concerning the insured event may lead to the insured s obligation to disclose arising too rapidly from the perspective of the Insurance Contracts Act. The fundamental problem herein, however, lies rather in the law than in the terms and conditions of insurance contracts, of which the premises are largely understandable.

40|$|Inter-industry {{differences}} in patent behaviour {{have been attributed}} {{in part to the}} number of patentable elements of the final innovation. The relatively large number of patentable parts of an innovation implies that the proprietary control of these parts is distributed across firms. Thus, they need to cross-license their technologies more often than firms in industries whose final innovations comprise relatively few patentable elements. This paper provides new evidence of firms patent behaviour based upon a survey of R&D spenders operating in UK manufacturing. We have concentrated not only on why (or not) firms apply for patents but also on how they produce their patent portfolios. We have confirmed inter-industry {{differences in}} patent behaviour. However, our results suggest that those differences may derive mainly from the <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> R&D <b>expenses</b> rather than the number of patentable elements of the final innovation...|$|R

40|$|The {{insurance}} industry {{is known to}} have high operating expenses in the financial services sector. Insurers, investors and regulators are interested in models to understand the behavior <b>of</b> <b>expenses.</b> However, the current practice ignores skewness, occasional negative values as well as their temporal dependence. Addressing these three features, this paper develops a longitudinal model <b>of</b> insurance company <b>expenses</b> {{that can be used for}} prediction, to identify unusual behavior, and to measure firm efficiency. Specifically, we use a three-parameter asymmetric Laplace density for the marginal <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> insurers' <b>expenses</b> in each year. Copula functions are employed to accommodate their temporal dependence. As a function of explanatory variables, the location parameter allows us to analyze an insurer's <b>expenses</b> in light <b>of</b> the firm's characteristics. Our model can be interpreted as a longitudinal quantile regression. The analysis is performed using property-casualty insurance company data from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners of years 2001 - 2006. Due to the long-tailed nature <b>of</b> insurers' <b>expenses,</b> two alternative approaches are proposed to improve the performance of the longitudinal quantile regression model: rescaling and transformation. Predictive densities are derived that allow one to compare the predictions for individual insurers in a hold-out-sample. Both predictive models are shown to be reasonable with the rescaling method outperforming the transformation method. Compared with standard longitudinal models, our model is shown to be superior in identifying insurers' unusual behavior.

40|$|The aim of our {{paper is}} to make a {{contribution}} to the current science and policy discourse on the social design of the German energy transition (Energiewende). For this analysis, we use the Atkinson index as an inequality measure to analyse the <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> income, consumption and energy expenses in Germany and identify Gordon’s trade-off. Gordon refers to a basic problem of democratic societies namely that the constitutional guarantee of political equality of all citizens is contrasted with economic inequality, measured in income and consumption, as a result of market forces. Gordon characterized this economically as a trade-off between equality and efficiency, irrespective of the affluence of society. The Atkinson index can contribute to scrutinizing and illustrating the trade-off with respect to the social discourse about inequality in the German Energiewende, since the index’s epsilon parameter reveals the weighting of the inequality or equality of society. The epsilon parameter allows us to assess the distribution {{from the perspective of the}} whole of society or of social groups. In the first part of our analysis we considered the real <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> income, consumption, energy expenses, and CO 2 emissions. In the second part we analysed the normative <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> energy <b>expenses</b> and the CO 2 emission. The results of applying the Atkinson index reveal the societal meaning of Gordon’s trade-off for the German energy sector in the context of the German energy transition process (Energiewende) ...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{develops}} frequency <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> annual health <b>expense</b> for {{a variety}} of family compositions. The basic data resource was a sample of claims for a large group of federal employees in 1977. The primary data were compared in several aspects against three other sources of reference data on expenses by the non-aged population; the comparisons were reassuring. The method of convolution is used to obtain family frequency distributions from the distribution for individual adults and children. This technique is necessary when the claims data do not record family com-position. In consequence, the results may not be nationally representative of households which are relatively large or affected by unemployment. Aside from this special reservation, the experience of the non-elderly federal employee families seems to be a useful resource for policy analysis. ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis uses a {{theoretical}} model {{to consider whether}} plaintiffs paying lawyers on a contingent fee basis receive smaller payoffs than those retaining lawyers on an hourly basis. This is the view in England, where contingent fees are illegal. It is also a view recognised in America, where contingent fees are legal and commonly used {{in some areas of}} law. The issue revolves around whether contingent fee lawyers will settle cases too soon for their clients to receive a substantial settlement offer. In an incomplete information, multiperiod bargaining model of personal injury litigation, we show that this need not be true: even if lawyers are self-interested, plaintiffs can receive higher payoffs under contingent fees than under hourly ones. Considerable ambiguity surrounds plaintiffs' preferred fee arrangement and the speed at which any settlement occurs under the different fee contracts. The most crucial role in this comparison is played by the <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> legal <b>expenses</b> between plaintiffs and their lawyers. Our model therefore confirms the payoff ambiguity found in previous literature while being the first to address the settlement timing issue. It also suggests that the issue of how different fee arrangements affect the plaintiff in litigation is somewhat more complicated than policy debates {{on both sides of the}} Atlantic have implied...|$|R

GAO also issued its opinion {{on the effectiveness of}} the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's (FDIC) internal control as of December 31, 2000, and its evaluation of FDIC's compliance with selected provisions of laws and regulations for the three funds for the year ended December 31, 2000. This report reviews the internal control weaknesses identified during GAO's audits of the 2000 financial statements, and recommends improvements to address those weaknesses. GAO found that FDIC has several internal control weaknesses related to financial reporting, including the execution of transactions. The weaknesses concern its asset valuation process and its allocation and recovery expenses. Specifically, GAO found that (1) errors in valuing receivership assets caused both overstatements and understatements in determining the allowance for loss related to receivables; (2) a calculation error in valuing equity partnership assets caused an overstatement in the allowance for loss related to other assets; and (3) incorrect operating expense amounts were allocated and recovered, which resulted in the incorrect <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> operating <b>expense</b> charges among FDIC's funds. FDIC has instituted new control procedures to address these weaknesses. ...|$|R
