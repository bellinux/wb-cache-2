25|$|The {{educational}} {{perspective of}} internet linguistics examines the Internet's impact on formal language use, specifically on Standard English, {{which in turn}} affects language education. The rise and rapid spread of Internet use has brought about new linguistic features specific only to the Internet platform. These include, {{but are not limited}} to, an increase in the use of informal written language, inconsistency in written styles and stylistics and the use of new abbreviations in Internet chats and SMS text messaging, where constraints of technology on word count contributed to the rise of new abbreviations. Such acronyms exist primarily for practical reasons — to reduce the time and effort required to communicate through these mediums apart from technological limitations. Examples of common acronyms include lol (for laughing out loud; a general expression of laughter), omg (oh my god) and gtg (<b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>go).</b>|$|E

I used to think that World Briefing was a bit funny. The only scary thing about those publications was the mailing listpeople like George Bushand the fact that Hart would talk to the head of British Intelligence for an hour. I used to think it was us having a laugh, putting some loony right-wing sell in, and that somebody somewhere was taking it seriously.

500|$|According to Traci Paige Johnson, {{one of the}} {{producers}} and creators of Blue's Clues, Patton's character {{was more like a}} preschooler and more innocent than Steve. Angela Santomero, another producer and creator, stated that Patton's characterization as Joe brought him closer to the preschool viewer as Joe was more willing to [...] "jump into a problem rather than figure it out first like Steve". Patton liked working on Blue's Clues because, as he stated, [...] "I <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> be a kid for twelve hours a day". [...] He called the show's crew [...] "a real fun little family" [...] and a [...] "well-oiled machine" [...] by the time he joined the show. Patton remained on the show until the show's cancellation, and also appeared in its spin-off, Blue's Room, which premiered in 2004. Several years later, Patton said he had not yet grasped the enormity of replacing Burns, even after he became a parent and witnessed the show's effect on his own children.

500|$|J. Broad {{wrote that}} the phrase [...] "have a nice day" [...] is an apt middle ground for the [...] "drop dead" [...] the cashier is {{thinking}} and the [...] "come back soon" [...] the owner wants. Broad stated that the phrase is meaningless {{because it has been}} castrated by excessive usage and pretense. He compared the phrase to the salutation [...] "How are you?" [...] and the phrase [...] "had a lovely time", which are [...] "conversational space-fillers" [...] that help prevent embarrassing silences. Usage of the term has been compared to inserting the phrase [...] "you know" [...] or the word [...] "like" [...] in sentences. In 1982, comedian George Carlin joked at Carnegie Hall, [...] "That's the trouble with 'Have a nice day'; it puts all the pressure on you. Now you've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> out and somehow manage to have a good time, all because of some loose-lipped cashier. 'Have a nice day ...' Maybe I don't feel like having a nice day.

500|$|Recording {{sessions}} {{of the basic}} instrumental tracks for Wrapped in Red took place in Kurstin's Echo Studio in Los Angeles while orchestral sessions were recorded at EastWest Studios in Hollywood and featured vocals recorded in The Barn studio in Nashville. In recording tracks for the album, Clarkson and Kurstin wanted to showcase as many different styles as they could by experimenting in various sounds and styles to create fresh, contemporary sound to classic-sounding music. Kurstin recalled: [...] "It {{was a lot of}} fun for us because we <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> back to our roots. When Kelly started singing, it was clear she had the chops and had been trained to do anything." [...] He further added: [...] "We really experimented. It was so much fun and liberating. And it pays off." [...] Kurstin, who studied with jazz musician Jaki Byard at The New School for Jazz and Contemporary Music, recruited various jazz and soul musicians such as James Gadson, Kevin Dukes, Roy McCurdy, and Bill Withers to perform on the record to resonate a Memphis soul sound. He also collaborated with Joseph Trapanese to arrange and conduct a chamber orchestra.|$|E

There was like 2,000 the first night, and another 2,000 on the second night. So it was like, 'Whoa, we sold out both shows!' I was already tired from the night before, and we already had booked the studio time in Seattle. I went there, and I finished the last four bars of the verse I wrote. I wrote most of the verse—the first eight bars—on bus. It was getting closer to the show, and I wrote the last four bars at the studio because, our meet and greets aren’t an hour anymore. There’s like 300 people or 400 people, so you’re there until 6 pm now instead of 3 or 4. Now we <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> the studio, and I gotta be on stage at 9 pm, so it’s coming down to the wire I still have to eat and whatnot.

Derrickson hoped to feature Nightmare in a potential sequel, and expressed interest in further exploring the characters Jonathan Pangborn and Hamir in a sequel, after their smaller roles in the first film. He also explained that he is [...] "kept in the loop" [...] on how the Avengers films will use Strange, because of his close relationships with Feige and co-director Joe Russo. Spaihts has also expressed interest in seeing Clea appear in a potential sequel.

500|$|In 1967, Redding {{performed}} at the influential Monterey Pop Festival as the closing act on Saturday night, {{the second day of}} the festival. He was invited through the efforts of promoter Jerry Wexler. Until that point, Redding was still performing mainly for black audiences. [...] At the time, he “had not been considered a commercially viable player in the mainstream white American market.” But after delivering one of the most electric performances of the night, and having been the act to most involve the audience, “his performance at Monterey Pop was therefore a natural progression from local to national acclaim,...the decisive turning-point in Otis Redding’s career.” [...] His act included his own song [...] "Respect" [...] and a version of the Rolling Stones' [...] "Satisfaction." [...] Redding and his backing band (Booker T. & the M.G.'s with the Mar-Keys horn section) opened with Cooke's [...] "Shake", after which he delivered an impulsive speech, asking the audience if they were the [...] "love crowd" [...] and looking for a big response. The ballad [...] "I've Been Loving You" [...] followed. The last song was [...] "Try a Little Tenderness", including an additional chorus. [...] "I <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>go,</b> y'all, I don't wanna go", said Redding and left the stage of his last major concert. According to Booker T. Jones, [...] "I think we did one of our best shows, Otis and the MG's. That we were included in that was also something of a phenomenon. That we were there? With those people? They were accepting us and that was one of the things that really moved Otis. He was happy to be included and it brought him a new audience. It was greatly expanded in Monterey." [...] According to Sweet Soul Music, musicians such as Brian Jones and Jimi Hendrix were captivated by his performance; Robert Christgau wrote in Esquire, [...] "The Love Crowd screamed one's mind to the heavens." ...|$|E
