With this test, urethral discharge is collected on a swab, placed in a plastic tube, and moistened with oxidase reagent. Development of a purple color on the swab within 3 min indicates the presence of gonococci. This system was compared with culture and Gram-stained smear for the diagnosis of gonorrhea. Of 240 specimens tested, 174 were positive with culture, Gram stain, and the <b>Gd</b> <b>test</b> and 48 were negative with all tests. For eight specimens, cultures and smears were positive, but the <b>Gd</b> <b>test</b> was negative. Nine specimens produced positive <b>Gd</b> <b>tests</b> with negative smears and cultures.

Methods: The subjects were 30 elderly patients with active TB and 100 younger patients with active TB. The QFT- 2 <b>G</b> <b>test</b> results were analyzed in relation to combined and separate responses to early secretory antigenic target 6 -kD (ESAT- 6) protein and culture filtrate protein 10 (CFP- 10) antigens.

40|$|SYNOPSIS One {{hundred and}} {{fourteen}} strains of non-lactose fermenters and 127 lactose fermenters on MacConkey's agar have been compared in the 5 % and 1 % lactose tests and in /-galactosidase production, using ortho-nitro-phenyl-/-D-galactopyranoside (O.

In general, late or non-lactose fermenting strains of genera, usually lactose-positive, yield a rapidly positive O. N. P. G. reaction. Forty-one wild strains of Salmonella, Proteus, Providencia, and Pseudo-monas aeruginosa were found negative in all three tests. Of 1, 075 stock strains of Salmonella examined in the O. N.

40|$|Background: Different {{serological}} tests {{are used in}} serologic diagnosis of brucellosis. The most widely used of these are Standard Tube Agglutination and Coombs anti-brucella tests. Whereas ELISA Ig M and Ig <b>G</b> <b>tests</b> have been in use for a long time, immuncapture agglutination test has been recently introduced and used in serological diagnosis. The {{aim of this study}} was to compare diagnostic values of ELISA Ig M and Ig G and immuncapture agglutination tests with Coombs anti-brucella test. Methods: Sera from 200 patients with presumptive diagnosis of brucellosis were included into the study. Coombs anti-brucella test, ELISA Ig M and Ig <b>G</b> <b>tests</b> and Immuncapture test were investigated in these sera. Then, sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive and positive predictive values were calculated. Results: Sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive and positive predictive values were found to be 90, 6 %, 76, 3 %, 94, 2 %, and 65, 9 % respectively for the Immuncapture test, whereas they were found to be 73, 7 %, 58, 9 %, 84, 2 %, and 42, 8 % for Ig G and 72, 2 %, 67, 8 %, 85, 2 %, and 48, 7 % for Ig M.
