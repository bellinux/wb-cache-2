5|$|Returning to Bedford, <b>Flick</b> hunted, raised horses, built buildings, {{and became}} {{involved}} in selling real estate. He also scouted for Cleveland. Only four 19th century baseball players, including <b>Flick,</b> were still alive in 1970. In his later years, <b>Flick</b> still answered requests for autographs from his fans. Proud of his longevity, <b>Flick</b> often completed autographs by writing the date and his age above or underneath his signature.|$|E
5|$|The Naps {{acquired}} Shoeless Joe Jackson {{from the}} Athletics {{in a trade}} and had him replace <b>Flick</b> in the lineup. In July 1910, the Naps sold <b>Flick</b> to the Kansas City Blues of the American Association, but <b>Flick</b> refused to report to Kansas City, which cancelled the transaction.|$|E
5|$|<b>Flick</b> {{began his}} career in semi-professional {{baseball}} and played in minor league baseball for two years. He was noticed by George Stallings, {{the manager of the}} Phillies, who signed <b>Flick</b> as a reserve outfielder. <b>Flick</b> was pressed into a starting role in 1898 when an injury forced another player to retire. He excelled as a starter. <b>Flick</b> jumped to the Athletics in 1902, but an court injunction prevented him from playing in Pennsylvania. He joined the Naps, where he continued to play for the remainder of his major league career, which was curtailed by a stomach ailment.|$|E

5|$|<b>Flick</b> retired without {{playing in}} a World Series. As of 2003, there were six Hall of Famers without a World Series {{appearance}} who played most of their careers after 1903; three of them– <b>Flick,</b> Lajoie and Addie Joss– played together with Cleveland from 1902 to 1910.|$|E
5|$|<b>Flick</b> {{was born}} on January 11, 1876, the third of five {{children}} of Zachary and Mary <b>Flick,</b> on the family farm in Bedford, Ohio. His father was a farmer and mechanic who {{had served in the}} American Civil War. <b>Flick</b> attended Bedford High School, where he played catcher on the school's baseball team. He also played American football, wrestled, and boxed.|$|E
5|$|<b>Flick</b> {{was married}} to Rosa Ella (née Gates). The couple had five daughters. <b>Flick</b> died of {{congestive}} heart failure in 1971, at the age of 94, in his hometown of Bedford. He had also suffered from mycosis fungoides.|$|E

50|$|The Hollow-Face {{illusion}} {{has been}} used to study the dissociation between vision-for-perception and vision-for-action (see Two-streams hypothesis). In this experiment, people used their finger to make a quick <b>flicking</b> movement at a small target attached to the inside surface of the hollow - but apparently normal - face, or on the surface of a normal protruding face. The idea was that the fast <b>flicking</b> (rather like <b>flicking</b> a small insect off the face) would engage the vision-for-action networks in the dorsal stream - and thus would be directed to the actual rather than the perceived position of the target. The results were clear. Despite the presence of a robust illusion in which people perceived the hollow face {{as if it were a}} normal protruding face, the <b>flicking</b> movements they made were accurately directed to the real, not the illusory location of the target. This result suggests that the bottom-up cues that drive the <b>flicking</b> response are distinct from the top-down cues that drive the Hollow-Face illusion.|$|R
5|$|<b>Flick</b> {{was one of}} many star NL {{players who}} jumped to the fledgling American League (AL) after the 1901 season, playing for the crosstown Philadelphia Athletics. <b>Flick</b> played in 11 games for the Athletics, before the Phillies {{obtained}} an injunction from the Pennsylvania Supreme Court prohibiting any player under contract with the Phillies from playing for another team. Though this injunction named Lajoie, Bill Bernhard, and Chick Fraser only, it still applied to <b>Flick</b> as well. As a recourse, <b>Flick</b> and teammate Lajoie signed instead with the Cleveland Naps, as the Pennsylvania injunction could not be enforced in Ohio. The two players often traveled separately from their teammates for the next year, never setting foot in Pennsylvania in order to avoid a subpoena. <b>Flick</b> spent the remainder of his career in Cleveland, and the contract dispute was resolved when the leagues made peace in September 1903 with the National Agreement.|$|E
5|$|<b>Flick</b> entered semi-professional {{baseball}} by chance. When he was 15 years old, {{he was at}} a {{train station}} to support the local baseball team as it left for a road trip. Only eight of the team's players showed up at the station, so <b>Flick</b> was recruited to go on the trip with the team. Though <b>Flick</b> did not have a uniform or shoes, he hit well in both games of the doubleheader, though Bedford lost both games. He joined the Bedford team on a regular basis, and he continued to play semi-pro baseball throughout his teenage years.|$|E
5|$|Before the 1900 season, Philadelphia stars Napoleon Lajoie and Ed Delahanty {{held out}} of {{renewing}} their {{contracts with the}} team. Other {{members of the team}} had grown disgruntled. Amid talk of a revival of the American Association, <b>Flick</b> and several other players began to talk about not returning to the team the next year. The Philadelphia Inquirer reported that Flick's father was in the chair business in Cleveland and that he might require Flick's help with the business. <b>Flick</b> agreed to a contract extension before the season started.|$|E

5|$|With half-time fast approaching, Barcelona's {{confidence}} {{began to}} show: first, Messi attempted to <b>flick</b> a {{pass over the}} top of the United defence to Thierry Henry, which Rio Ferdinand intercepted; Iniesta then tried an ambitious back-heel that Van der Sar collected; and finally Messi sped through three Manchester United defenders towards the by-line, only for his cut-back cross to be pounced upon by Van der Sar and then cleared by Vidić. On the stroke of half-time, Iniesta himself then attempted to <b>flick</b> the ball through to Henry, but it was just too high for the French striker, and referee Massimo Busacca took that cue to blow the whistle for the interval.|$|E
5|$|<b>Flick</b> was {{enshrined}} in the Greater Cleveland Sports Hall of Fame in 1977, and the Ohio Baseball Hall of Fame in 1987.
