5|$|A {{search of}} this star by the Hubble Space Telescope {{revealed}} no stellar companions, although {{this does not}} preclude the presence of smaller companions that are below the telescope's detection limit, such as a planet orbiting within one astronomical unit of the star. No excess infrared emission has been detected, which may indicate {{the lack of a}} debris disk in orbit around it. Radial velocity measurements of this star using the Near <b>Infrared</b> <b>Spectrometer</b> (NIRSPEC) instrument at the Keck II observatory have not revealed any variations that might otherwise indicate the presence of an orbiting companion. This instrumentation is sensitive enough to detect the gravitational perturbations massive, short period companions with the mass of Neptune or greater.|$|E
5|$|Compositional {{information}} from the visible and <b>infrared</b> <b>spectrometer</b> (VIR), gamma-ray and neutron detector (GRaND), and framing camera (FC), all indicate {{that the majority of}} the surface composition of Vesta is consistent with the composition of the howardite, eucrite, and diogenite meteorites. The Rheasilvia region is richest in diogenite, consistent with the Rheasilvia-forming impact excavating material from deeper within Vesta. The presence of olivine within the Rheasilvia region would also be consistent with excavation of mantle material. However, olivine has only been detected in localized regions of the northern hemisphere, not within Rheasilvia. The origin of this olivine is currently uncertain.|$|E

The presence of a subsurface ocean under the south polar region is now accepted, but it cannot explain {{the source of the}} heat, with an estimated heat flux of 200mW/m2, which is about 10 times higher than that from radiogenic heating alone.|$|E

In May 2015, NASA announced that it had accepted development of the Europa Clipper mission, and revealed the instruments it will use. The aim of Europa Clipper is to explore Europa in order to investigate its habitability, and to aid selecting sites for a future lander. The Europa Clipper would not orbit Europa, but instead orbit Jupiter and conduct 45 low-altitude flybys of Europa during its envisioned mission. The probe would carry an ice-penetrating radar, short-wave <b>infrared</b> <b>spectrometer,</b> topographical imager, and an ion- and neutral-mass spectrometer.|$|E
5|$|Heating in Enceladus has {{occurred}} through various mechanisms ever since its formation. Radioactive decay in its core may have initially heated it, {{giving it a}} warm core and a subsurface ocean, which is now kept above freezing through an unidentified mechanism. Geophysical models indicate that tidal heating is a main heat source, perhaps aided by radioactive decay and some heat-producing chemical reactions. A 2007 study predicted the internal heat of Enceladus, if generated by tidal forces, could be no greater than 1.1 gigawatts, but data from Cassini's <b>infrared</b> <b>spectrometer</b> of the south polar terrain over 16 months, indicate that the internal heat generated power is about 4.7 gigawatts, and {{suggest that it is}} in thermal equilibrium.|$|E
5|$|On September 30, 2013, propene was {{detected}} in the atmosphere of Titan by NASA's Cassini spacecraft, using its composite <b>infrared</b> <b>spectrometer</b> (CIRS). This {{is the first time}} propene has been found on any moon or planet other than Earth and is the first chemical found by the CIRS. The detection of propene fills a mysterious gap in observations that date back to NASA's Voyager 1 spacecraft's first close flyby of Titan in 1980, during which it was discovered that many of the gases that make up Titan's brown haze were hydrocarbons, theoretically formed via the recombination of radicals created by the Sun's ultraviolet photolysis of methane.|$|E
40|$|Chemical imaging systems help {{to solve}} many {{challenges}} in various scientific fields. Able to deliver rapid spatial and chemical information, modern <b>infrared</b> <b>spectrometers</b> using Focal Plane Array detectors (FPA) are of great interest. Considering conventional <b>infrared</b> <b>spectrometers</b> {{with a single}} element detector, we can consider that the diffraction-limited spatial resolution {{is more or less}} equal to the wavelength of the light (i. e. 2. 5 – 25 μm). Unfortunately, the spatial resolution of FPA spectroscopic setup is even lower due to the detector pixel size. This becomes a real constraint when micron-sized samples are analysed. New chemometrics methods are thus of great interest to overcome such resolution drawback, while keeping our far-field <b>infrared</b> imaging <b>spectrometers.</b> The aim of the present work is to evaluate the super-resolution concept in order to increase the spatial resolution of <b>infrared</b> imaging <b>spectrometers</b> using FPA detectors. The main idea of super-resolution is the fusion of several low-resolution images of the same sample to obtain a higher-resolution image. Applying the super-resolution concept on a relatively low number of FPA acquisitions, it was possible to observe a 30 % decrease in spatial resolution...|$|R

500|$|Images {{taken by}} Cassini during the flyby on July 14, 2005, {{revealed}} a distinctive, tectonically deformed region surrounding Enceladus's south pole. This area, reaching {{as far north}} as 60° south latitude, is covered in tectonic fractures and ridges. The area has few sizable impact craters, suggesting that it is the youngest surface on Enceladus and on any of the mid-sized icy satellites; modeling of the cratering rate suggests that some regions of the south polar terrain are possibly as young as 500,000 years or less. Near the center of this terrain are four fractures bounded by ridges, unofficially called [...] "tiger stripes". They appear to be the youngest features in this region and are surrounded by mint-green-colored (in false color, UV–green–near IR images), coarse-grained water ice, seen elsewhere on the surface within outcrops and fracture walls.

Results from the visual and <b>infrared</b> <b>spectrometer</b> (VIMS) instrument suggest that the green-colored material surrounding the tiger stripes is chemically distinct {{from the rest of the}} surface of Enceladus. VIMS detected crystalline water ice in the stripes, suggesting that they are quite young (likely less than 1,000 years old) or the surface ice has been thermally altered in the recent past.
