5|$|In Asia, nearly 70% of the {{population}} occurs in India and Pakistan. The combined population of the <b>dromedary</b> and the Bactrian camel decreased by around 21% between 1994 and 2004. The <b>dromedary</b> is sympatric with the Bactrian camel in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and central and southwestern Asia. India has a <b>dromedary</b> population of less than one million, with most (0.67 million) {{in the state of}} Rajasthan. Populations in Pakistan decreased from 1.1 million in 1994 to 0.8 million in 2005 – a 29% decline. According to the FAO, the <b>dromedary</b> population in six countries of the Persian Gulf was nearly 0.67 million in 2003. In the Persian Gulf region the <b>dromedary</b> is locally classified into breeds including Al-Majahem, Al-Hamrah, Al-Safrah, Al-Zarkah and Al-Shakha, based on coat colour. The UAE has three prominent breeds; Racing camel, Al-Arabiat and Al-Kazmiat.|$|E
5|$|The <b>dromedary</b> has not {{occurred}} naturally {{in the wild}} for nearly 2,000 years. It was probably first domesticated in Somalia or the Arabian Peninsula about 4,000 years ago. In the wild, the <b>dromedary</b> inhabited arid regions, including the Sahara Desert. The domesticated <b>dromedary</b> is generally found in the semi-arid to arid regions of the Old World, mainly in Africa, and a significant feral population occurs in Australia. Products of the <b>dromedary,</b> including its meat and milk, support several north Arabian tribes; it is also commonly used for riding and as a beast of burden.|$|E

5|$|The dromedary's diet {{consists}} {{mostly of}} foliage, dry grasses and desert vegetation mostly thorny plants. A study said the typical diet of the <b>dromedary</b> is dwarf shrubs (47.5%), trees (29.9%), grasses (11.2%), other herbs (0.2%) and vines (11%). The <b>dromedary</b> {{is primarily a}} browser; forbs and shrubs comprise 70% of its diet in summer and 90% of its diet in winter. The <b>dromedary</b> may also graze on tall, young, succulent grasses.|$|E
5|$|The modern <b>dromedary</b> {{probably}} {{evolved in}} the hotter, arid regions of western Asia from the Bactrian camel, which in turn was {{closely related to the}} earliest Old World camels. This hypothesis is supported {{by the fact that the}} <b>dromedary</b> foetus has two humps, while in the adult male an anterior vestigial hump is present. A jawbone of a <b>dromedary</b> that dated from 8,200 BC was found in Saudi Arabia on the southern coast of the Red Sea.|$|E
5|$|Feral <b>dromedary</b> populations {{occur in}} Australia, {{where it was}} {{introduced}} in 1840. The total <b>dromedary</b> population in Australia is 0.5 million as of 2005.

5|$|In 1975, Richard Bulliet of Columbia University {{wrote that}} the <b>dromedary</b> exists in large numbers in areas from which the Bactrian camel has disappeared; the {{converse}} is also true to a great extent. He said this substitution could have taken place because of the heavy dependence on the milk, meat and wool of the <b>dromedary</b> by Syrian and Arabian nomads, while the Asiatic people domesticated the Bactrian camel but {{did not have to}} depend upon its products.|$|E
5|$|The <b>dromedary</b> and the Bactrian camel often interbreed {{to produce}} fertile offspring. Where the ranges {{of the species}} overlap, such as in {{northern}} Punjab, Persia and Afghanistan, the phenotypic differences between them tend to decrease {{as a result of}} extensive crossbreeding. The fertility of their hybrid has given rise to speculation that the <b>dromedary</b> and the Bactrian camel should be merged into a single species with two varieties. However, a 1994 analysis of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene showed the species display 10.3% divergence in their sequences.|$|E
5|$|The <b>dromedary</b> has not {{occurred}} in the wild for nearly 2,000 years. Wild dromedaries inhabited arid regions, particularly the Sahara Desert. The original range of the camel’s wild ancestors was probably southern Asia and the Arabian peninsula. Its range included hot, arid regions of northern Africa, Ethiopia, the Near East and western and central Asia. The <b>dromedary</b> typically thrives in areas with a long dry season and a short wet season. They are sensitive to cold and humidity, though some breeds can thrive in humid conditions.|$|E

5|$|<b>Dromedaries</b> {{were also}} shipped from {{south-western}} Asia to Spain, Italy, Turkey, France, Canary Islands, the Americas and Australia. <b>Dromedaries</b> were introduced into Spain in 1020 AD and to Sicily in 1059 AD.

Attempts to introduce <b>dromedaries</b> into the Caribbean, Colombia, Peru, Bolivia and Brazil were made between the 17th and 19th centuries; some were imported to the western United States in the 1850s and some to Namibia in the early 1900s, but presently they exist in small numbers or are absent in these areas.|$|R

5|$|The <b>dromedary</b> {{shares the}} genus Camelus with the Bactrian camel (C. bactrianus) {{and the wild}} Bactrian camel (C. ferus). The <b>dromedary</b> belongs to the family Camelidae. The ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle (4th century BC) {{was the first to}} {{describe}} the species of Camelus. He named two species in his History of Animals; the one-humped Arabian camel and the two-humped Bactrian camel. The <b>dromedary</b> was given its current binomial name Camelus dromedarius by Swedish zoologist Carl Linnaeus in his 1758 publication Systema Naturae. In 1927, British veterinarian Arnold Leese classified dromedaries by their basic habitats; the hill camels are small, muscular animals and efficient beasts of burden; the larger plains camels could be further divided into the desert type that can bear light burdens and are apt for riding, and the riverine type slow animals that can bear heavy burdens; and those intermediate between these two types.|$|E
5|$|The <b>dromedary</b> was {{probably}} first domesticated in Somalia or the Arabian Peninsula about 4,000 years ago. In the ninth or tenth century BC, the <b>dromedary</b> became {{popular in the}} Near East. The Persian invasion of Egypt under Cambyses in 525 BC introduced domesticated camels to the area. The Persian camels were not well-suited to trading or travel over the Sahara; journeys across the desert were made on chariots pulled by horses. The <b>dromedary</b> was introduced into Egypt from south-western Asia (Arabia and Persia). The popularity of dromedaries increased after the Islamic conquest of North Africa. While the invasion was accomplished largely on horseback, new links to the Middle East allowed camels to be imported en masse. These camels were well-suited to long desert journeys and could carry {{a great deal of}} cargo, allowing substantial trans-Saharan trade for the first time. In Libya, dromedaries were used for transport and their milk and meat constituted the local diet.|$|E
5|$|The {{strength}} and docility of the <b>dromedary</b> make it popular as a domesticated animal. According to Richard Bulliet, {{they can be}} used {{for a wide variety of}} purposes: riding, transport, ploughing, trading and as a source of milk, meat, wool and leather. The main attraction of the <b>dromedary</b> for nomadic desert-dwellers is the wide variety of resources they provide, which are crucial for their survival. It is important for several Bedouin pastoralist tribes of northern Arabia, such as the Ruwallah, the Bani Sakhr and the Mutayr.|$|E
5000|$|They were {{developed}} {{to take the place}} of horses, where horses were not common. They were also successful against enemy horses, as horses are typically afraid of camels' scents. Camels were seen as exotic and useful creatures, known for their ability to move over desert terrain. It is noted that <b>dromedaries</b> were used less often than camels, though the title [...] "Dromedarii" [...] may imply that <b>dromedaries</b> were used more often. However, the Romans could not distinguish between camels and <b>dromedaries,</b> thus using both as a means of transportation. This is very similar to the camel cavalry used often by the Ottoman Empire. It is noted that camel cavalry was more commonplace as a result of the desert terrain during the Muslim conquests.|$|R

5|$|In 2013, a {{seroepidemiological study}} (a study {{investigating}} the patterns, {{causes and effects}} of a disease on a specific population {{on the basis of}} serologic tests) in Egypt was the first to show the <b>dromedary</b> might be a host for the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). A 2013–14 study of dromedaries in Saudi Arabia concluded the unusual genetic stability of MERS-CoV coupled with its high seroprevalence in the <b>dromedary</b> makes this camel a highly probable host for the virus. The full genome sequence of MERS-CoV from dromedaries in this study showed a 99.9% match to the genomes of human clade B MERS-CoV. Another study in Saudi Arabia showed the presence of MERS-CoV in 90% of the evaluated dromedaries and suggested that camels could be the animal source of MERS-CoV.|$|E
5|$|In the Sahara, 332 {{plant species}} have been {{recorded}} as food plants of the <b>dromedary.</b> These include Aristida pungens, Acacia tortilis, Panicum turgidum, Launaea arborescens and Balanites aegyptiaca. The <b>dromedary</b> eats Acacia, Atriplex and Salsola when they are available. Feral dromedaries in Australia prefer Trichodesma zeylanicum and Euphorbia tannensis. In India, dromedaries are fed with forage plants such as Vigna aconitifolia, V. mungo, Cyamopsis tetragonolaba, Melilotus parviflora, Eruca sativa, Trifolium species and Brassica campestris. Dromedaries keep their mouths open while chewing thorny food. They use their lips to grasp the food and chew each bite 40 to 50 times. Its long eyelashes, eyebrows, lockable nostrils, caudal opening of the prepuce and a relatively small vulva help the camel avoid injuries, especially while feeding.

5|$|<b>Dromedary</b> {{slaughter}} is {{more difficult}} than the slaughter of other domestic livestock such as cattle, {{because of the size}} of the animal and the significant manual work involved. More males than females are slaughtered. Though less affected by mishandling than other livestock, the pre-slaughter handling of the <b>dromedary</b> plays a crucial role in determining the quality of meat obtained; mishandling can often disfigure the hump. The animal is stunned, seated in a crouching position with the head in a caudal position and slaughtered. The dressing percentage the percentage of the mass of the animal that forms the carcass is 55–70%, more than the 45–50% of cattle. Camel meat is rarely consumed by African camel herders, who use it only during severe food scarcity or for rituals. Camel meat is processed into food items such as burgers, patties, sausages and shawarma. Dromedaries can be slaughtered between four and ten years of age. As the animal ages, the meat grows tougher and deteriorates in taste and quality.|$|E
