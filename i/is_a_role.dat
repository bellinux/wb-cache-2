She called her character [...] "innocent, vulnerable, emotional, sweet, funny and strong {{all at the}} same time", adding that she was initially sceptical to play a mother to adolescents because Telugu film sensibilities were different from that of Malayalam ones, but accepted it due to the script's novelty. Nadhiya was selected to play Asha Sarath's role of a police officer from the original. She confirmed later that she would be playing an Inspector General of Police, which <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> she found being [...] "almost like a role of a lioness that is trying to protect her family and yet is ferocious from the inside", calling it a [...] "challenging and different" [...] one.|$|E
500|$|Between 1935 and 1940 Akhmatova composed, {{worked and}} {{reworked}} the long poem Requiem in secret, a lyrical cycle of lamentation and witness, depicting {{the suffering of}} the common people under Soviet terror. She carried it with her as she worked and lived in towns and cities across the Soviet Union. It was conspicuously absent from her collected works, given its explicit condemnation of the purges. The work in Russian finally appeared in book form in Munich in 1963, the whole work not published within USSR until 1987. It consists of ten numbered poems that examine a series of emotional states, exploring suffering, despair, devotion, rather than a clear narrative. Biblical themes such as Christ's crucifixion and the devastation of Mary, Mother of Jesus and Mary Magdelene, reflect the ravaging of Russia, particularly witnessing the harrowing of women in the 1930s. It represented, to some degree, a rejection of her own earlier romantic work as she took on the public role as chronicler of the Terror.

500|$|She {{has been}} labeled by the French media as [...] "the female Zidane" [...] - like Zinedine Zidane, she has Algerian ancestry, {{grew up in}} Marseille and {{possesses}} immense skill, especially as a playmaker with an eye for goal.

In an interview with FIFA.com just before the 2012 Olympics, she alluded to the comparison, saying, [...] "Zidane <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> model for me.

[...] "For little kids growing up in the ghettos," [...] he said, [...] "it's easy to get into the wrong types of things, especially gangbanging and selling drugs. I've seen what that was like, and I don't glorify it, but I don't preach. I bring it to them rather than have them go find out about it for themselves." [...] He further explained the [...] "dream" [...] that he would pursue after making the album: [...] "I'm going to try to eliminate the gang violence. I'll be on a mission for peace.

Environmental agencies 'Keep Britain Tidy' and 'CleanupUK' commented: [...] "It is disappointing that Coronation Street chooses to allow {{one of its}} characters to throw a butt {{on the floor and}} suggest that it is okay to treat our streets like a giant ashtray. We understand the writers are concerned with realism but Becky <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> model to many viewers. We all have a responsibility to keep our local area clean and we would hope that producers of programmes such as Coronation Street would support our call to encourage the public to keep our country tidy." [...] A spokesperson for the show defended Becky's actions, stating they were portraying the character's high levels of stress realistically. Inside Soap readers voted in a poll to find out which character would be missed the most after they depart. Becky won with sixty percent of the vote, whilst up against Eve Jenson (Emmerdale) and Ronnie Mitchell (EastEnders). Julie Richardson writing for Orange U.K. said she [...] "loved a good TV scrap" [...] and the serial had [...] "a corker" [...] with Becky and Kylie's fight which took place in 2011.

Prior to release, the film was touted as the most expensive South Indian film ever, costing Rs 26.38 crores, and released across India with 400 prints. Anniyan took an [...] "extraordinary opening", {{went on to become}} a blockbuster grossing more than Rs.100 crores through the original and two dubbed versions.
