50|$|In {{photography}} and optics, a neutral-density filter, or ND filter, is a filter that reduces or modifies {{the intensity of}} all wavelengths, or colors, of light equally, giving no changes in hue of color rendition. It can be a colorless (clear) or <b>grey</b> <b>filter.</b> The purpose of a standard photographic neutral-density filter {{is to reduce the}} amount of light entering the lens. Doing so allows the photographer to select combinations of aperture, exposure time and sensor sensitivity that would otherwise produce overexposed pictures. This is done to achieve effects such as a shallower depth of field or motion blur of a subject in a wider range of situations and atmospheric conditions.|$|E
5000|$|Unlike the {{previous}} types, natural vignetting (also known as natural illumination falloff) {{is not due}} to the blocking of light rays. The falloff is approximated by the cos4 or [...] "cosine fourth" [...] law of illumination falloff. Here, the light falloff {{is proportional to the}} fourth power of the cosine of the angle at which the light impinges on the film or sensor array. Wideangle rangefinder designs and the lens designs used in compact cameras are particularly prone to natural vignetting. Telephoto lenses, retrofocus wideangle lenses used on SLR cameras, and telecentric designs in general are less troubled by natural vignetting. A gradual <b>grey</b> <b>filter</b> or postprocessing techniques may be used to compensate for natural vignetting, as it cannot be cured by stopping down the lens. Some modern lenses are specifically designed so that the light strikes the image parallel or nearly so, eliminating or greatly reducing vignetting.|$|E

40|$|A new {{filtering}} theory {{based on}} grey system theory is explored {{so that any}} actual system functioning (failure) time can be effectively partitioned into system characteristic functioning times and repair improvement (damage) times. The <b>grey</b> <b>filters</b> have effectively addressed a fundamental problem in repairable system modeling and maintenance decision-making because the repair effects are no longer required to be “estimated ” by maintenance experts or by imposing assumptions for obtaining them. However, the <b>grey</b> system <b>filters</b> lead to a challenging new problem: the characteristic system functioning times and the repair improvement effects are grey numbers, which are typically represented by a sequence of intervals. Therefore, the fuzzy set-valued issues arise and hence the characters and mathematical foundation of set-valued statistics – random set and the falling shadow function is briefly reviewed. We further discuss the procedure of fuzzy set-valued inference based on sampled data information proposed by Chen and Chen (1984). An industrial data is used to illustrate the prediction of system failure time based on covariate information. The significant contribution {{of this paper is}} therefore the innovative usage of <b>grey</b> <b>filtering</b> model to estimate system repair effects and pave the way to fuzzy set-valued statistical inferences...|$|R

40|$|Purpose - The aim of {{the study}} was to {{determine}} the effect of optimal spectral filters on reading performance following stroke. Methods - Seventeen stroke subjects, aged 43 - 85, were considered with an age-matched Control Group (n = 17). Subjects undertook the Wilkins Rate of Reading Test on three occasions: (i) using an optimally selected spectral filter; (ii) subjects were randomly assigned to two groups: Group 1 used an optimal filter, whereas Group 2 used a <b>grey</b> <b>filter,</b> for two-weeks. The <b>grey</b> <b>filter</b> had similar photopic reflectance to the optimal filters, intended as a surrogate for a placebo; (iii) the groups were crossed over with Group 1 using a <b>grey</b> <b>filter</b> and Group 2 given an optimal filter, for two weeks, before undertaking the task once more. An increase in reading speed of > 5 % was considered clinically relevant. Results - Initial use of a spectral filter in the stroke cohort, increased reading speed by ~ 8 %, almost halving error scores, findings not replicated in controls. Prolonged use of an optimal spectral filter increased reading speed by > 9 % for stroke subjects; errors more than halved. When the same subjects switched to using a <b>grey</b> <b>filter,</b> reading speed reduced by ~ 4 %. A second group of stroke subjects used a <b>grey</b> <b>filter</b> first; reading speed decreased by ~ 3 % but increased by ~ 4 % with an optimal filter, with error scores almost halving. Conclusions - The present study has shown that spectral filters can immediately improve reading speed and accuracy following stroke, whereas prolonged use does not increase these benefits significantly...|$|E

The present study measured the effect of optimal spectral filters on visual search response time and accuracy, using a task requiring serial processing.

Initial use of an optimal spectral filter improved visual search response time but not error scores in the stroke cohort. Prolonged use of neither an optimal nor a <b>grey</b> <b>filter</b> improved response time or reduced error scores. In fact, response times increased with the filter, regardless of its type, for stroke and control subjects; this outcome may be due to contrast reduction or a reflection of task design, given that significant practice effects were noted. © 2013 a Pion publication...|$|E
40|$|The present thesis investigates pattern glare {{susceptibility}} {{following stroke}} and {{the immediate and}} prolonged impact of prescribing optimal spectral filters on reading speed, accuracy and visual search performance. Principal observations: A case report has shown that visual stress can occur following stroke. The use of spectral filters and precision tinted lenses {{proved to be a}} successful intervention in this case, although the parameters required modification following a further stroke episode. Stroke subjects demonstrate elevated levels of pattern glare compared to normative data values and a control group. Initial use of an optimal spectral filter in a stroke cohort increased reading speed by ~ 6 % and almost halved error scores, findings not replicated in a control group. With the removal of migraine subjects reading speed increased by ~ 8 % with an optimal filter and error scores almost halved. Prolonged use of an optimal spectral filter for stroke subjects, increased reading speed by > 9 % and error scores more than halved. When the same subjects switched to prolonged use of a <b>grey</b> <b>filter,</b> reading speed reduced by ~ 4 % and error scores increased marginally. When a second group of stroke subjects used a <b>grey</b> <b>filter</b> first, reading speed decreased by ~ 3 % but increased by ~ 3 % with prolonged use of an optimal filter, with error scores almost halving; these findings persisted with migraine subjects excluded. Initial use of an optimal spectral filter improved visual search response time but not error scores in a stroke cohort with migraine subjects excluded. Neither prolonged use of an optimal nor <b>grey</b> <b>filter</b> improved response time or reduced error scores in a stroke group; these findings persisted with the exclusion of migraine subjects...|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{accuracy}} and precision of any instrument {{should not be taken}} for granted. While there is an international standard for checking focimeters, there is no report of any study on their performance. Method: A sample set of 51 focimeters (11 brands), were used to measure the spherical power of a set of lenses and the prismatic power of two lenses complying with ISO 9342 - 1 : 2005 and other calibrated prismatic lenses and the spherical power of some <b>grey</b> <b>filters.</b> Results: The mean measured spherical power corresponded very closely with the calibrated values; however, the spread of results was substantial and 10 focimeters did not comply with ISO 8598 : 1996. The measurement of prism was much more accurate and precise and all the focimeters complied easily. With the <b>grey</b> <b>filters,</b> about one-third of the foci meters either showed erratic reading or an error with the equivalent of category 4 sunglasses. On the other hand, nine focimeters had stable and accurate reading on a filter with a luminous transmittance of 0. 5 per cent. Conclusions: These results confirm that, in common with all other measurement instruments, {{there is a need to}} ensure that a focimeter is reading accurately and precisely over the range of refractive powers and luminous transmittances. The accurate and precise performance of an automated focimeter over its working life cannot be assumed. Checking before purchase with a set of calibrated lenses and some dark sunglass tints will indicate the suitability of a focimeter. Routine checking with the calibrated lenses will inform the users if a focimeter continues to indicate accurately...|$|R
40|$|Background: In {{patients}} with migraine, an abnormally large haemodynamic response to epileptogenic visual stimulation {{has previously been}} observed, consistent with the hypothesis of a cortical hyperexcitability. Ophthalmic filters {{have been used in}} the treatment of migraine, and they reduce the haemodynamic response. Methods: The present study used near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) to characterise the haemodynamic response to a range of visual stimuli in 20 {{patients with}} migraine (15 with aura and 5 without) and paired controls in order to assess the effect of ophthalmic treatment. In an initial study, the response to three stimuli (chequerboard, and two gratings of different spatial frequency) was measured. In a second study, using the mid-spatial frequency grating as stimulus, the response was compared when precision spectral <b>filters</b> (PSF), <b>grey</b> <b>filters</b> or filters of control colour were worn as ophthalmic lenses. Results: In the first study the time course of the response differed between the groups. The difference was most distinct for the grating with mid-spatial frequency. In the second study the PSF broadened (normalised) the haemodynamic response in migraineurs relative to controls, consistent with fMRI BOLD findings and suggesting a physiological mechanism for their reported efficacy. In neither study were there differences in the amplitude of the response between migraine and control groups or indeed between filters. Conclusion: The time course of the functional response as measured by NIRS may be an effective tool to track therapy with PSF and explore the mechanisms of visual stress in migraine. © International Headache Society 2012...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: System age {{is one of}} the key {{parameter}} in {{system reliability}} modeling and maintenance policy decision-making. Recently, reliability engineering researchers began to pay efforts in estimating repair effects, say,Yun et al (2004). In this paper, we explore the philosophical andmathematicalmechanism underlying the grey system theory proposed by Deng (1981), particularly the unity of the opposites of smoothness and roughness, that of deterministic and randomness, that of integration and differentiation. In terms of <b>grey</b> system <b>filtering</b> GM(1, 1) model, we successfully separate system repair improvement effects from system functioning times. We have obtained a series of piece-wise exponential laws for characterizing a repairable system functioning times (i. e., intrinsic system ages). The results consolidate the stochastic age process (Guo and Love, 2003), which contains continuous-change and discrete-jumps. The properties of the age process is explored and developed. A maximum likelihood estimation for age process parameters is then briefly discussed. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} {{modelling}} and {{identification of a}} river system using physical insights about the process, experience of operating the system and information about the system dynamics shown by measured data. These components together form a linear model structure in the state space form. The inputs of the prospective model are physical variables, which are not directly measured. However, the model inputs can be found by a nonlinear transformation of measured variables. Unknown parameters of the model are estimated from measured data. The modelling work focuses {{on the principle of}} parsimony, which means the best model approach is the simplest one that fit the purpose of the application. The goal of the model is to control the water level of the river, where the water flow is mainly determined by the demand for energy generation produced by the hydropower stations along the river. The energy requirement increases in the morning and decreases in the evening. These flow variations, caused by the energy demand, have to be compensated by controlling the power plants downstream, {{in such a way that}} the water level between the power stations is guaranteed. Simulation of the control system by using an adaptive model predictive controller shows that the water levels vary less and can be maintained at a higher level than during manual control. This means that more electric power can be produced with the same amount of water flow.

40|$|Abstract- The color visual {{cryptography}} {{methods are}} {{free from the}} limitations of randomness on color images. The two basic ideas used are error diffusion and pixel synchronization. Error diffusion is a simple method, in which the quantization error at each pixel level is filtered and fed as the input to the next pixel. In this way low frequency that is obtained between the input and output image is minimized which in turn give quality images. Degradation of colors are avoided {{with the help of}} pixel synchronization. The proposal of this work presents an efficient color image visual cryptic filtering scheme to improve the image quality on restored original image from visual cryptic shares. The proposed color image visual cryptic filtering scheme presents a deblurring effect on the non-uniform distribution of visual cryptic share pixels. After eliminating blurring effects on the pixels, Fourier transformation is applied to normalize the unevenly transformed share pixels on the original restored image. This in turn improves the quality of restored visual cryptographic image to its optimality. In addition the overlapping portions of the two or multiple visual cryptic shares are filtered out with homogeneity of pixel texture property on the restored original image. Experimentation are conducted with standard synthetic and real data set images, which shows better performance of proposed color image visual cryptic filtering scheme measured in terms of PSNR value (improved to 3 times) and share pixel error rate (reduced to nearly 11 %) with existing <b>grey</b> visual cryptic <b>filters.</b> The results showed that the noise effects such as blurring on the restoration of original image are removed completely...|$|R
