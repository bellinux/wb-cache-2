40|$|We {{present a}} {{detailed}} experimental and theoretical {{analysis of the}} epitaxial stress relaxation process in micro-structured compositionally graded alloys. We focus on the pivotal SiGe/Si(001) system employing patterned Si substrates at the micrometre-size scale to address the distribution of threading and misfit dislocations within the heterostructures. SiGe alloys with linearly increasing Ge content were deposited by low energy plasma enhanced chemical vapour deposition resulting in isolated, tens of micrometre tall 3 D crystals. We demonstrate that complete elastic relaxation is achieved by appropriate choice of the Ge compositional <b>grading</b> <b>rate</b> and Si pillar width. We investigate the nature and distribution of dislocations along the [001] growth direction in SiGe crystals by transmission electron microscopy, chemical defect etching and etch pit counting. We show that for 3  μm wide Si pillars and a Ge <b>grading</b> <b>rate</b> of 1. 5 % μm− 1, only misfit dislocations are present while their fraction is reduced for higher Ge grading rates and larger structures due to dislocation interactions. The experimental results are interpreted {{with the help of}} theoretical calculations based on linear elasticity theory describing the competition between purely elastic and plastic stress relaxation with increasing crystal width and Ge compositional <b>grading</b> <b>rate...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{compositional}} <b>grading</b> <b>rate</b> on reverse linear graded silicon germanium virtual substrates, grown by reduced pressure chemical vapor deposition, is investigated. For a Si(001) /Ge/RLG/Si 0. 22 Ge 0. 78 buffer of 2. 4 mu m total thickness the threading dislocation density (TDD) within the top, fully relaxed, Si 0. 22 Ge 0. 78 layer is 4 x 10 (6) cm(- 2), with a surface roughness of 3 nm. For a thicker buffer, where the <b>grading</b> <b>rate</b> is reduced, a lower TDD of 3 x 10 (6) cm(- 2) and a surface roughness of 2 nm can be achieved.

40|$|Silicon {{germanium}} alloy layers can {{be grown}} epitaxially on a silicon substrate to provide a means of adjusting the lattice parameter of the crystal. Such a platform, known as a virtual substrate, {{has a number of}} potential applications. For instance, it allows for subsequent overgrowth of highly strained layers of silicon, or germanium, that could enable very high speed transistors, similarly it could be used as the starting point of a range a silicon-based optoelectronic devices. In this work, a novel adaptation has been made to a recently proposed reverse grading technique to create high Ge composition SiGe virtual substrates. The proposed structures consist of a relaxed, highly defected, pure Ge underlayer on a Si (001) substrate prior to reverse grading where structures have final compositions of Si 0. 2 Ge 0. 8. Additionally, two grading schemes are studied, reverse linear grading and reverse terrace grading. All buffers are grown by reduced pressure chemical vapour deposition. The relaxation, defect levels and surface roughness of the fabricated buffers have been quantified whilst varying the <b>grading</b> <b>rate.</b> An ideal <b>grading</b> <b>rate</b> has been found where the quality of the buffer is very high, due to the highly defected Ge underlayer and that the buffer relaxes under tensile strain. Outside of this ideal <b>grading</b> <b>rate</b> three dimensional growth, stacking fault formation and crack generation can occur. Cracking of the buffer has been modelled and some conditions where the buffer is stable have been found. This study experimentally investigates this proposed solution and a crack-stable high quality buffer is fabricated. Comparisons have been drawn with other more popular buffer fabrication techniques and it is found that this technique has very competitive qualities.

Threshold based segmentation is performed for background removal and fruit part selection from the given image. Shape features is extracted using the contour of the date fruit and texture features are extracted using Curvelet transform and Local Binary Pattern (LBP) from the selected date fruit region. Finally, combinations of shape and texture features are fused to grade the dates into six grades. k-Nearest Neighbour(k-NN) classifier yields the best <b>grading</b> <b>rate</b> compared to other two classifiers such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Linear Discriminant(LDA) classifiers.

40|$|An {{experiment}} {{has demonstrated}} that truly dislocation free SiGe crystals with widths of at least 5 μm can be epitaxially grown on Si substrates by applying the compositional grading developed for layers to 3 D structures. At such crystal widths, the epitaxial growth of SiGe alloys with a constant high Ge content inevitably leads to the injection of dislocations. The reason is that at dimension far above the nanoscale the low aspect ratio of the SiGe/Si system during {{the initial stages of}} the growth does not allow for sufficient elastic strain relaxation. The findings suggest that there is no limit to the final Ge content, and that the <b>grading</b> <b>rate</b> can be suitably tailored in order to give access to even larger dislocation-free structures. Indeed, preliminary experimental results indicate similar absence of dislocations in SiGe crystals graded to a fi nal Ge content of 80 %. Combining this method with layer transfer techniques makes it possible to form dislocation-free SiGe patches many micrometers in size acting as virtual substrates with lattice parameters intermediate to those of Si and Ge on an Si substrate...|$|E
40|$|We {{report on}} the growth of SiGe/Si heterostructures in a {{commercial}} chemical vapor deposition cold-wall vertical reactor using SiH 4 and GeH 4 gas precursors, and we discuss their structural quality. The machine is versatile as it operates {{in a wide range}} of temperature and pressure, allowing both the ultra high vacuum and a low-pressure-like regime. In the two growth modes, the Si and SiGe deposition rates and the Ge fraction are calibrated as a function of the temperature and the hydrides partial pressures. The LP-CVD regime is appropriate for the realization of thick gradually relaxed Si 0. 75 Ge 0. 25 /Si pseudo-substrates. The role of the <b>grading</b> <b>rate</b> (5 - 20 % Ge/mu m) on the density of threading dislocations and the surface roughness is discussed.

Teaching assistants (TAs) graded students’ work and bubbled in the grades on the sheet which was then read into the computer. As well as improving the grade entry process, it also allowed for students to have their results (and grader comments) conveniently emailed to them. For this study, we have used one of the Scantron® fields as a “TA identifier” to correlate grading with the specific grader. This allows for comparison between TAs’ <b>grading</b> <b>rate,</b> grade averages, variances, and distributions. Group and individual trends were also observed over time.

We discuss these results and how they may impact our confidence in the final grade assigned to a particular student.

40|$|Until now, {{progress}} of the microelectronic industry has been maintained by scaling devices. Physical limits now necessitate alternative approaches such as enhancing material properties through strain engineering or increasing functionality through use of Si/SiGe heterostructures (e. g. optoelectronic integration), requiring control of strain, which may enhance electrical properties but {{can also lead to}} deleterious structural and electronic effects. Strain can be controlled via growth of stress-balanced structures on a fully strain relaxed virtual substrate (VS) which acts as a growth template for, and maintains strain in, the active layers, which need to be ordered and defect free. The crystalline quality of the VS therefore impacts directly upon the device. These basic elements are realised in a molecular beam epitaxy system using gaseous hydride precursors. Compositionally graded VS are used to investigate strain-relaxation processes. High resolution x-ray diffraction (XRD) allowed examination of lattice reciprocal space, where compositional and strain information is dispersed. Localised distortions of the lattice revealed the mosaic nature of the structure. Nomarski contrast microscopy and atomic force microscopy enabled quantitative analysis of surface defects and roughness, including characteristic crosshatch. VS grading rates, growth temperatures and precursor fluxes were varied to assess relaxation kinetics. The nucleation and propagation of strain-relieving dislocations were investigated through the growth of different VS structures on vicinal Si(001) substrates. XRD analysis showed tilting of the epitaxial layer with respect to the substrate. A correlation of tilt angle with offcut angle was observed, following energy barrier asymmetries on the available slip systems. Development of the tilt was seen to be a non-linear function of both Ge composition and <b>grading</b> <b>rate,</b> and was explained by interdislocation interactions. Stress-balancing was investigated by designing distributed Bragg reflector stacks. Structures without detrimental strain relief were achieved, with a reflectance in excess of those reported in the literature, demonstrating the applicability of the VS growth and stress-balance methods. The elastic properties of SiGe could also be probed via this approach, and small deviations from linear interpolation of bulk Si and Ge values were found, supported by theoretical modelling.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effectiveness and safety of stem cell transplantation for spinal cord injury (SCI). DATA SOURCES: PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, China Science and Technology Journal, Wanfang, and SinoMed databases were systematically searched by computer to select clinical randomized controlled trials using stem cell transplantation to treat SCI, published between each database initiation and July 2016. DATA SELECTION: Randomized controlled trials comparing stem cell transplantation with rehabilitation treatment for patients with SCI. Inclusion criteria: (1) Patients with SCI diagnosed according to the American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) International standards for neurological classification of SCI; (2) patients with SCI who received only stem cell transplantation therapy or stem cell transplantation combined with rehabilitation therapy; (3) one or more of the following outcomes reported: outcomes concerning neurological function including sensory function and locomotor function, activities of daily living, urination functions, and severity of SCI or adverse effects. Studies comprising patients with complications, without full-text, and preclinical animal models were excluded. Quality of the included studies was evaluated using the Cochrane risk of bias assessment tool and RevMan V 5. 3 software, provided by the Cochrane Collaboration, was used to perform statistical analysis. OUTCOME MEASURES: ASIA motor score, ASIA light touch score, ASIA pinprick score, ASIA impairment scale grading improvement rate, activities of daily living score, residual urine volume, and adverse events. RESULTS: Ten studies comprising 377 patients were included in the analysis and the overall risk of bias was relatively low level. Four studies did not detail how random sequences were generated, two studies did not clearly state the blinding outcome assessment, two studies lacked blinding outcome assessment, one study lacked follow-up information, and four studies carried out selective reporting. Compared with rehabilitation therapy, stem cell transplantation significantly increased the lower limb light touch score (odds ratio (OR) = 3. 43, 95 % confidence interval (CI) : 0. 01 – 6. 86, P = 0. 05), lower limb pinprick score (OR = 3. 93, 95 %CI: 0. 74 – 7. 12, P = 0. 02), ASI <b>grading</b> <b>rate</b> (relative risk (RR) = 2. 95, 95 %CI: 1. 64 – 5. 29, P = 0. 0003), and notably reduced residual urine volume (OR = – 8. 10, 95 %CI: – 15. 09 to – 1. 10, P = 0. 02). However, stem cell transplantation did not significantly improve motor score (OR = 1. 89, 95 %CI: – 0. 25 to 4. 03, P = 0. 08) or activities of daily living score (OR = 1. 12, 95 %CI: – 1. 17 to 4. 04, P = 0. 45). Furthermore, stem cell transplantation caused a high rate of mild adverse effects (RR = 14. 49, 95 %CI: 5. 34 – 34. 08, P < 0. 00001); however, these were alleviated in a short time. CONCLUSION: Stem cell transplantation was determined to be an efficient and safe treatment for SCI and simultaneously improved sensory and bladder functions. Although associated minor and temporary adverse effects were observed with transplanted stem cells, spinal cord repair and axon remyelination were apparent. More randomized controlled trials with larger sample sizes and longer follow-up times are needed to further validate the effectiveness of stem cell transplantation in the treatment of SCI...|$|E
