25|$|The ma'avarim {{shoulder}} insignia {{was unveiled}} {{in a ceremony}} in July 2004. The two <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>it</b> symbolize the striving for co-existence between the two sides.

25|$|An {{attempt at}} pursuit {{was made by}} Waller and Cromwell, with all the cavalry they could lay <b>hands</b> <b>on.</b> <b>It</b> was, however, unsupported, for the council of war had decided to content itself with besieging Donnington Castle. A little later, after a brief and half-hearted attempt to move towards Oxford, it {{referred}} to the Committee for further instructions. Within the month, Charles, having joined Rupert at Oxford and made him general of the Royalist forces vice Brentford, reappeared in the neighbourhood of Newbury.|$|E
500|$|To Stephen Holden of Rolling Stone, {{the track}} was [...] "a {{compelling}} gospel-flavored rocker... a stunning achievement {{that carries the}} authority of pop scripture". On an album that he considered [...] "a pop religious ceremony for all seasons, one in which Harrison acts as priest, deliberately placing his gifts and his legend into public service for God", Holden added of the song: [...] "I hope that Aretha Franklin gets her <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>it,</b> and soon." ...|$|E

500|$|The oldest {{stand at}} Anfield is the Main Stand, taking 76 years to complete. The stand was {{completed}} in 2016, however, the lower section dates from 1906. The bottom tier of the stand houses the directors' box. The directors' VIP box {{is located at the}} rear of the lower tier of the stand. The old large roof was supported by two thin central uprights, with a large suspended television camera gantry which has moved to the front of the third tier [...] The players' tunnel and the technical area where the managers and substitutes sit during the match are in the middle of the stand at pitch level. Above the stairs leading down to the pitch hung a sign stating [...] "THIS IS ANFIELD". Its purpose was to both intimidate the opposition and to bring the Liverpool players who touch it good luck. Accordingly, Liverpool players and coaching staff traditionally reached up and placed one or both <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>it</b> as they passed underneath.|$|E
2500|$|Then the High Priest {{came to the}} {{scapegoat}} {{and laid}} his two <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>it,</b> and he made confession, saying: [...] "I beseech You, o Lord, Your people the house of Israel have failed, committed iniquity and transgressed before you. I beseech you, o Lord, atone the failures, the iniquities and the transgressions that Your people, the house of Israel, have failed, committed, and transgressed before you, as it is written in the Torah of Moses, Your servant (in [...] ): ‘For on this day shall atonement be made for you, to cleanse you; from all your sins shall you be clean before the Lord.'" [...] And when the Priests and the people standing in the Temple Court heard the fully pronounced Name of God come {{from the mouth of}} the High Priest, they bent their knees, bowed down, fell on their faces, and called out: [...] "Blessed is the Name of God's glorious Kingdom, forever and ever!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Then the High Priest bound {{a thread}} of crimson wool {{on the head of}} the Azazel goat, and placed it at the gate from which it was to be sent away. And he placed the goat that was to be {{slaughtered}} at the slaughtering place. He came to his bull a second time, pressed his two <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>it</b> and made confession, saying: [...] "O Lord, I have dealt wrongfully, I have transgressed, I have sinned before You, I and my house, and the children of Aaron, Your holy people, o Lord, pray forgive the wrongdoings, the transgression, and the sins that I have committed, transgressed, and sinned before You, I and my house, and the children of Aaron, Your holy people. As it is written in the Torah of Moses, Your servant (in [...] ): ‘For on this day atonement be made for you, to cleanse you; from all the sins shall you be clean before the Lord.'" [...] And then the people answered: [...] "Blessed is the Name of God's glorious Kingdom, forever and ever!" [...] Then he killed the bull.|$|E

2500|$|The Emperor sent {{order to}} Churaman and several Rajput Rajas to join prince Azu-ud-Din, {{who had been}} deputed to Agra to watch the {{movements}} of Farrukh Siyar. But all of them procrastinated. Azi-ud-Din was subsequently defeated at Khajuha (November 1712). This alarmed Jahandar Shah. Early in December, making fulsome promises he sent a farman to Chruaman to reach Agra with his men against Farrukah Siyar. Churaman came with a big force and fought {{on the side of}} the Emperor at the battle of Agra (January 1713) But once his cause appeared to have been lost, the audacious Jat felt no qualms of conscience in plundering the rear of his professed master.This can easily be explained on account of the fact that had Churaman not taken it, [...] the victors wd definitely have laid their <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>it.</b> [...] He did not spare the camp of the victor either.He went back to Thun carrying treasures, many elephants and camels together with their baggage. The Jats so thoroughly looted it that Farrukh Siyar could not find anything better than a filthy screen and a small wooden platform to sit on, while receiving the homage of his officials.|$|E
2500|$|Nachmanides {{noted that}} [...] {{mentioned}} {{a reason for}} the offerings – that they are [...] "a fire-offering, of a pleasing odor to the Eternal." [...] Nachmanides rejected the argument that the offerings were meant to eliminate the foreigners' foolish ideas, for the sacrifices would not have that effect, as the foreigners' intention was to worship the constellations of the sheep and the ox, and if Jews slaughtered sheep and oxen to God, it would show respect and honor to those constellations. Nachmanides further noted that when Noah came out of the ark, there were as yet no Chaldeans or Egyptians in the world, yet Noah brought an offering that pleased God so much that [...] reports that on its account God said, [...] "I will not again curse the ground anymore for man's sake." [...] Similarly, Abel brought of the first-born of his flock and [...] reports that [...] "the Eternal had regard to Abel and to his offering," [...] but there had not yet been a trace of idol worship in the world. In [...] Balaam said, [...] "I have prepared the seven altars, and I have offered up a bullock and a ram on every altar," [...] but his intent was not to eradicate evil beliefs from Balak's mind, but rather to approach God so that God's communication would reach Balaam. Nachmanides argued that the reason for the offerings was more likely that since people's deeds are accomplished through thought, speech, and action, therefore God commanded that when people sin and bring an offering, they should lay their <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>it</b> in contrast to the evil deed that they committed. Offerers would confess their sin verbally to contrast with their evil speech. They would burn parts of the animal in fire that were seen as the instruments of thought and desire in human beings. The offerers would burn the legs of the animal because they corresponded to the limbs with which the offerer acted. The offerer sprinkled blood on the altar, which is analogous to the blood in the offerer's body. Nachmanides argued that offerers performed these acts so that the offerers should realize that the offerers had sinned against God with their bodies. And the offerer's soul and blood should have been spilled and the offerer's body burned, were it not for God's loving-kindness in taking a substitute and a ransom – the offering – so that the offering's blood should be in place of the offerer's blood, its life in place of the offerer's life, and that the limbs of the offering in place of the parts of the offerer's body.|$|E
