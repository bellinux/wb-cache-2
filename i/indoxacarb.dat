40|$|Data {{regarding}} the environmental fate and biological activity of chlorantraniliprole and <b>indoxacarb</b> termiticides against Reticulitermes flavipes is limited. Generally, new pesticides are evaluated in agricultural settings; however, {{the fate of}} these chemicals in the urban environment is also important. ^ Chlorantraniliprole and <b>indoxacarb</b> were evaluated for their environmental fate and bioefficacy. Chlorantraniliprole persisted longer than <b>indoxacarb</b> under field conditions. Decreases in <b>indoxacarb</b> were initially first-order (3 ̆c 180 d) with reduced loss 3 ̆e 180 d. <b>Indoxacarb</b> concentrations differed based on soil depth as half-lives increased with depth. Chlorantraniliprole loss was more consistent (i. e. zero order) as concentrations steadily declined. Chlorantraniliprole concentrations remained high at 518 d with no differences based on soil depth. ^ High R. flavipes mortality occurred when exposed to <b>indoxacarb</b> and chlorantraniliprole treated soils. Termites were unable to completely penetrate the chlorantraniliprole treated soils; however, complete penetration of some <b>indoxacarb</b> treated soils occurred at 360 d. No repellency to either termiticide was observed. ^ <b>Indoxacarb</b> leached during the initial termiticide application at concentrations higher than its solubility limit. Post-application, <b>indoxacarb</b> concentrations decreased to just above its water solubility. Chlorantraniliprole concentrations in effluent gradually increased with time to its approximate solubility limit in the sandy loam but were never detected in the silty clay loam. Most <b>indoxacarb</b> and chlorantraniliprole remained near the point of application. ^ Mineralization of <b>indoxacarb</b> in urban soils was determined. Temperature had the biggest influence with no differences based on depth. Differences in measured <b>indoxacarb</b> residues, held at different temperatures, strongly suggest the importance of soil microbes on <b>indoxacarb</b> degradation. <b>Indoxacarb</b> losses also occurred over the first 90 d {{as a result of}} abiotic degradation and/or bound residue formation. ^ Chlorantraniliprole was more toxic to R. flavipes workers when topically applied. Alternatively, <b>indoxacarb</b> was more toxic to the termites when in soil. A bioavailability ratio was developed and indicated that <b>indoxacarb</b> is more bioavailable to termites in soil when compared to chlorantraniliprole. ...|$|E

40|$|<b>Indoxacarb</b> is a {{relatively}} new pesticide from oxadiazin class, which is used near carp ponds for agricultural purposes. Thus, the aim {{of this study was to}} determine <b>indoxacarb</b> effects on common carp (Cyprinus carpio). The fish were exposed to 0 (control), 0. 75, 1. 5 and 3 ppm of <b>indoxacarb</b> over 21 days and plasma biochemical characteristics and liver histopathology were examined. Exposure to <b>indoxacarb</b> induced fall in total protein after 21 days. Globulin increased after 7 days and then decreased after 14 - and 21 -day exposure. Plasma alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase activities increased in 1. 5 and 3 ppm treatments after 7 -day exposure. <b>Indoxacarb</b> exposure significantly decreased plasma alkaline phosphatase after 7 days with no change at the second and third samplings. After 7 days, plasma T 3 levels had no significant change; however, it decreased after 14 days in the 1. 5 and 3 ppm treatments and also reduced after 21 -day exposure to the 3 ppm treatment compared to the control group. Plasma T 4 level only decreased significantly in the 3 ppm treatment compared to the control group after 21 days. Different histopathological symptoms such as necrosis, hyperaemia, sinusoidal space extension, pyknotic nuclei, leucocyte infiltration and melanomacrophage aggregates were observed after 21 -day exposure to <b>indoxacarb.</b> The symptoms intensity was dependent on <b>indoxacarb</b> concentration.

Soils with varying organic matter (0. 57 - 3. 64 %) and chemical characteristics were used in termiticide bioassays. Lethal dose resulting from topical application indicated that chlorantraniliprole was two- to 11 -foldmoretoxic than <b>indoxacarb.</b> Lethal concentration assays yielded opposite results where concentrations of <b>indoxacarb</b> in soil that caused either 50 or 90 % mortality of R. flavipes workers at 48 and 144 h were two- to six-fold lower than chlorantraniliprole. The bioavailability of <b>indoxacarb</b> and chlorantraniliprole was negatively correlated with soil organic matter. Our results suggest that <b>indoxacarb</b> is more bioavailable to termites in soil than chlorantraniliprole based on calculated bioavailability ratios. However, how these laboratory results correlate to actual field application data and termite efficacy is unknown, and more research is needed.

40|$|Aim: Chronic {{exposure}} to <b>indoxacarb</b> and pulmonary expression of toll-like receptor 9 (TLR- 9) in mice. Materials and Methods: In this study, healthy male Swiss albino mice (n= 30) aging 8 - 10 weeks {{were used to}} evaluate TLR- 9 expression in lungs of mice following <b>indoxacarb</b> exposure with and without lipopolysaccharide (LPS). <b>Indoxacarb</b> was administered orally dissolved in groundnut oil at 4 and 2 mg/kg/day for 90 days. On day 91, five animals from each group were challenged with LPS/normal saline solution at 80 μg/animal. The lung tissues were processed for real time and immunohistochemical studies. Results: LPS resulted increase in fold change m-RNA expression level of TLR- 9 as compare to control, while <b>indoxacarb</b> (4 mg/kg) alone and in combination with LPS resulted 16. 21 -fold change and 29. 4 -fold change increase in expression of TLR- 9 m-RNA, respectively, as compared to control.

40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} the <b>indoxacarb</b> 300 g kg- 1 WG, Steward 30 WDGTM, on the honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) in apple orchards, a monitoring study was conducted in Dutch apple orchards in April/May 2004. Before apple flowering began, two honey bee colonies were placed in each orchard to investigate honey bee mortality. Each hive was provided with a Münster dead bee trap to collect dead honey bees. The numbers of dead bees found in these Münster dead traps were counted every 3 - 4 days for about 2 weeks before and after the period of the insecticide treatment. In nine flowering orchards no <b>indoxacarb</b> was applied during the flowering period, which served as control sites. In 30 flowering orchards <b>indoxacarb</b> was sprayed by the fruit growers according to local practice at 170 - 260 g formulated product ha- 1 (51 - 78 g AI ha- 1). In the control orchards the average mortality was 8 honey bees colony- 1 day- 1. The average daily honey bee mortality before and after <b>indoxacarb</b> application was 8 and 10 honey bees colony- 1 day- 1 respectively. At one test site, <b>indoxacarb</b> was mixed with other plant protection products plus plant nutrients, and in this orchard a slight but biologically non-significant increase in acute honey bee mortality was recorded. It was concluded that the application of <b>indoxacarb</b> caused no effects on honey bee mortality, and that the number of dead honey bees counted in the Münster traps in the orchard treated with <b>indoxacarb</b> was comparable with those determined in control orchard...|$|E

40|$|Background: A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to evaluate the effect of <b>indoxacarb</b> applied to cats on adult cat fleas, Ctenocephalides felis, flea egg production and adult flea emergence. Methods: Sixteen cats were selected for the study and allocated to two treatment groups. Eight cats were treated with a 19. 5 % w/v topical spot-on solution of <b>indoxacarb</b> on day 0 and eight cats served as untreated controls. Each cat was infested with 50 fleas on Days − 2, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35 and 42. On Days 1, 2, and 3, and at 2 and 3 days after each post treatment reinfestation flea eggs were collected from the pan under each cat cage. Eggs were counted and viability assessed by evaluating adult flea emergence 28 days after egg collection. Three days after treatment or infestation, each cat was combed to remove and count live fleas. Results: Treatment with <b>indoxacarb</b> provided 100 % efficacy following infestations on day − 2, 7, 14, 21 and 28 and efficacy was 99. 6 % following infestations on days 35 and 42. Egg production from <b>indoxacarb</b> treated cats was reduced by 99. 9 % within 72 hours of treatment. For subsequent infestations no eggs were produced from treated cats from day 8 through day 30. Egg production was still reduced by ≥ 95. 8 % through day 45. <b>Indoxacarb</b> treatment also reduced adult flea emergence from eggs for 5 weeks after treatment. The combination of reduction in egg numbers and egg viability from <b>indoxacarb</b> treated cats reduced predicted flea emergence by 100 % from days 2 – 31 and 99. 9 %, 100 %, 96. 4 % and 99. 0 % on days 37, 38, 44 and 45, respectively. Conclusions: A topical spot-on formulation of <b>indoxacarb</b> provided ≥ 99. 6 % efficacy against flea infestations on cats for 6 weeks following a single treatment. <b>Indoxacarb</b> also eliminated or markedly reduced egg production for the entire evaluation period and reduced the viability of the few eggs that were produced from Day 1 through Day 38.

40|$|To {{investigate}} if synergism occurs between pyrethroids, organophosphates and new insecticides, {{we tested}} representatives of these compounds (bifenthrin, chlorpyrifos, spinosad, <b>indoxacarb</b> and emamectin) against the diamondback moth (Plutella xylostella). Larvicidal activity of these insecticides was assessed separately and {{together on a}} susceptible strain (Lab-UK) of P. xylostella {{as well as a}} field population collected from Multan. The field population showed significant resistance to chlorpyrifos (331 100 -fold), bifenthrin (45 200 -fold), emamectin (1800 -fold), spinosad (11 -fold) and <b>indoxacarb</b> (5600 -fold) when compared with the Lab-UK population. When insecticides were mixed based on LC 50 and tested at serial concentrations against Lab-UK, significant synergy (CI < 1) occurred between bifenthrin, spinosad and emamectin. In contrast, the interaction between bifenthrin and <b>indoxacarb</b> was additive (CI B< 1). The toxicity of bifenthrin against the field population increased significantly (P < 0. 01) when combined with spinosad, emamectin and <b>indoxacarb.</b> Synergistic effects could be attributed to the complementary modes of action by these insecticide classes acting on different components of nerve impulse transmission (which are not identical forbifenthrin and <b>indoxacarb</b> either). However, chlorpyrifos/bifenthrin mixture was not significantly different either from bifenthrin or chlorpyrifos alone, indicating an additive affect. In combination with spinosad and emamectin, tested against the resistant field population, the toxicity of chlorpyrifos increased significantly and even more so with <b>indoxacarb.</b> Mixtures could also give rise to multiple resistance that may extend across other chemical classes and thus become difficult to manage. Therefore, alternative strategies such as mosaics or rotations should be considered.

In addition, the secondary kill by acetamiprid, hydramethylnon, and <b>indoxacarb</b> was evaluated against mixed-stage cockroach populations. All baits exhibited secondary kill against various developmental stages of B. germanica. The levels of secondary mortality decreased from 100 % in the first instars to as low as 12. 1 % in adult males. The field strain was much less susceptible than the laboratory strain, with only 9. 2 - 16. 6 % secondary mortality among the 3 rd- 4 th instars. Acetamiprid caused significantly lower secondary mortality of the laboratory strain first instars than fipronil, hydramethylnon, and <b>indoxacarb.</b> In an experiment evaluating direct and secondary kill against mixed-stage populations (100 total per experimental arena), the direct kill by acetamiprid, hydramethylnon, and <b>indoxacarb</b> was 40. 0, 74. 0, and 98. 5 %, respectively.

40|$|In {{accordance}} with Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 396 / 2005, Belgium, hereafter {{referred to as}} the evaluating Member State (EMS), compiled an application to modify the existing MRLs for the active substance <b>indoxacarb</b> in rucola, cress, land cress, red mustard, other lettuce and salad plants, purslane (including sorrel and glassworth), beet leaves and other spinach and similar (leaves). In order to accommodate for the intended uses of <b>indoxacarb,</b> Belgium proposed to raise the existing MRLs from the limit of quantification to 1 mg/kg. Belgium drafted an evaluation report in {{accordance with}} Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 396 / 2005, which was submitted to the European Commission and forwarded to EFSA. According to EFSA the data are sufficient to derive MRL proposals of 1 mg/kg for the proposed uses on rucola, cress, land cress, red mustard, other lettuce and salad plants, purslane (including sorrel and glassworth), beet leaves and other spinach and similar (leaves). Adequate analytical enforcement methods are available to control the residues of <b>indoxacarb</b> on the commodities under consideration. Based on the risk assessment results, EFSA concludes that the proposed use of <b>indoxacarb</b> on rucola, cress, land cress, red mustard, other lettuce and salad plants, purslane (including sorrel and glassworth), beet leaves and other spinach and similar (leaves) will not result in a consumer exposure exceeding the toxicological reference values and therefore is unlikely to pose a consumer health risk...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Using {{high doses}} of {{insecticides}} is very dangerous for the environments and for humans. Decreased concentrations are necessary. Insecticides have lethal and sublethal effects. The aim {{of the present study}} was to determine the behavior of Plutella xylo-stella when exposed to sublethal doses of <b>indoxacarb</b> in terms of the age-specific fecundity (mx), life expectancy (ex) and stable age distribution (Cx). Also, the effects of sublethals on the pre-oviposition, oviposition and post-oviposition period of this insect were investigated. The results show that exposure to this insecticide decreased the age-specific fecundity (mx) and life expectancy (ex) of the insect. Although the pre-oviposition period was delayed in the treated groups, the post-oviposition period significantly decreased when exposed to LC 10 and LC 25 doses (the dose concentrations killed 10 and 25 % of the populations) of <b>indoxacarb.</b> The oviposition period did not change. Furthermore, sublethal concentrations of the applied insecticide caused changes in the exposed structure. Key words: Plutella xylostella, sublethal doses, <b>indoxacarb,</b> life expectancy, stable age distribution, oviposition perio...|$|E

40|$|Pesticides are an {{important}} component of New Zealand’s primary production sectors. Infestation of pests and diseases can affect crop yield, crop value and damage the country’s export reputation, resulting in economic losses. Repeat applications of pesticides, however, can result in contamination of land and water. Therefore, {{it is important to understand}} the fate of pesticides in the environment. Factors which can affect pesticide persistence include soil properties (pH, SOM, CEC), leaching and run-off, volatilisation and co-contamination with heavy metals. Many soils in New Zealand contain high levels of copper from historical applications of copper-based pesticides. Co-contamination of soils may lead to the persistence of some synthetic organic pesticides. An investigation was undertaken to determine the effects of co-contamination with copper on the biodegradation of atrazine and <b>indoxacarb</b> in a New Zealand soil. A Templeton sandy loam soil was spiked with CuSO₄ to achieve concentrations of 0, 100, 250, 500 and 1000 mg kg⁻¹ Cu. The spiked soils were field aged for six months prior to pesticide spiking with either atrazine or <b>indoxacarb.</b> The aged Cu-spiked soils were spiked with either atrazine or <b>indoxacarb</b> at a rate of 2 mg kg⁻¹. A glasshouse study was conducted to determine if copper inhibited the degradation of the pesticides. The pesticide-spiked soils were sampled at the time of spiking (t₀), at the estimated half-lives (t₁) and at twice the estimated half-lives (t₂) of the individual pesticides. The estimated half-lives were based on literature values. The bioavailability and subsequent adverse effects of copper on the soil microbial community was investigated. Total and bioavailable copper concentrations, phosphatase and urease enzyme activities, microbial biomass, and pesticide residue concentrations were all measured in the experimental soil. Methods were developed for the extraction of atrazine, atrazine metabolite and <b>indoxacarb</b> residues from the experimental soil. Total copper concentrations extracted ranged from 4 – 1060 mg kg⁻¹ in the experimental soils and were consistent throughout the pesticide degradation studies. The bioavailability of copper was a maximum of 2 % of the total copper concentration. Bioavailable copper concentrations were positively correlated to total copper (p< 0. 01). Soil biological properties were investigated to determine the effects of copper on the soil microbial community. Phosphatase and urease enzyme activities, as well as microbial biomass concentrations, were negatively correlated with total copper (p< 0. 05). Total copper was a better indicator of effects on microorganisms than bioavailable copper. The soil biological properties began showing adverse effects above a total copper concentration of 100 mg kg⁻¹. This concentration also corresponds to New Zealand’s copper limit in biosolids, which is protective of human, plant and microorganism health. Phosphate buffer extraction methods were developed for the analysis of atrazine and <b>indoxacarb</b> residues in the experimental soil by HPLC-UV. Elevated copper concentrations did not inhibit the degradation of atrazine or <b>indoxacarb</b> in the experimental soil. The half-lives of both atrazine (≤ 19. 4 d) and <b>indoxacarb</b> (≤ 18. 8 d) were lower in the spiked experimental soils than the means reported in previous New Zealand and international studies, but were within the reported ranges. This study provided the first data on the fate of <b>indoxacarb</b> in New Zealand. Hydroxyatrazine was the only metabolite detected in the atrazine-spiked experimental soils. Significant differences between the control (Cu- 1) and copper levels above 100 mg kg⁻¹ were observed for hydroxyatrazine at t₂. Significant negative correlations were observed between hydroxyatrazine and the microbiomass at t₁ and phosphatase activity at t₂ (p< 0. 05). These significant relationships suggest that elevated copper concentrations may alter the degradation of this metabolite in the experimental soils due copper toxicity of the soil microbial community. The results of this thesis indicate that elevated levels of copper above 100 mg kg⁻¹ negatively impact the soil microbial community and may reduce the overall health of the soil. Biodegradation is a key mechanism for the degradation of atrazine and <b>indoxacarb</b> in the soil, so it is important that the health of the soil microbial community is maintained. Therefore, it is recommended that atrazine and <b>indoxacarb</b> are only applied to soils with a total copper concentration less than 100 mg kg⁻¹. This will protect the health of the soil microbial community and prevent the potential adverse effects of copper on the degradation of pesticide metabolites in the soil...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{evaluated the}} new red imported fire ant (RIFA) bait Advion??????. Advion?????? contains {{the active ingredient}} <b>indoxacarb</b> which, following ingestion, must be metabolized into an N-decarbomethoxyllated metabolite known as JT 333 {{in order to become}} acutely toxic. Laboratory experimentation was conducted to determine the most effective chemical form and concentration of <b>indoxacarb,</b> as well as the most appropriate grit size, for use in Advion??????. The results indicated that Advion?????? containing <b>indoxacarb</b> was more effective than Advion?????? containing JT 333, that 0. 10 %, 0. 06 %, and 0. 045 % were the most effective concentrations of <b>indoxacarb,</b> and that standard sized grit (~ 2 mm) was more effective than small sized grit (< 1 mm). Field experimentation was conducted to determine the most effective concentration and quantity of Advion??????, as well as the most effective placement of the bait, for obtaining maximum control of RIFA colonies via individual mound treatments. The results indicated that 10 g (2 Tbsp) of 0. 045 % Advion?????? placed around the mound in a circle with a radius of 0. 5 - 3. 0 m was the most effective manner in which to treat individual RIFA mounds. Field experimentation was also conducted to compare the effectiveness of label-rate broadcast treatment with Advion?????? to the effectiveness of both label-rate broadcast treatment with Amdro???? and pre-baiting broadcast treatment with Advion??????. Both pre-baiting broadcast treatment and label-rate broadcast treatment with Advion?????? ultimately resulted in 98 - 99 % RIFA colony mortality, which was significantly greater than the 87 % colony mortality resulting from broadcast treatment with Amdro????. The 6. 2 d LT 90 for label-rate broadcast treatment with Advion?????? was nearly one half that of the LT 90 for pre-baiting broadcast treatment. Laboratory experimentation was conducted to determine whether RIFA workers were capable of metabolizing <b>indoxacarb</b> into the toxic metabolite, and the results clearly indicated that they were. Finally, field experimentation was conducted {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} label-rate broadcast treatment with Advion?????? at controlling multiple ant species. The results indicated that label-rate broadcast treatment with Advion?????? resulted in control of the RIFA and Pogonomyrmex barbatus for at least 7 wk, and Monomorium pharaonis and Dorymyrmex pyramicus for some period of time between 3 and 7 wk...|$|E

40|$|The {{potential}} for using imidacloprid (a neonicotinoid) and <b>indoxacarb</b> (an oxadiazine) as grain protectants {{was investigated in}} bioassays against resistant strains of five stored grain beetles. The species investigated were Rhyzopertha dominica (F.) (the lesser grain borer), Sitophilus oryzae (L.) (the rice weevil), Tribolium castaneum (Herbst) (the rust-red flour beetle), Oryzaephilus surinamensis (L.) (the saw tooth flour beetle), and Cryptolestes ferrugineus (Stephens) (the flat grain beetle). Each of these species has developed resistance {{to one or more}} protectants, including organophosphorus insecticides, synthetic pyrethroids and the juvenile hormone analogue methoprene.
