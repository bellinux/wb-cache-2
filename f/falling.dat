5|$|Activities {{that reduce}} {{physiological}} arousal and cognitive activity promote <b>falling</b> asleep, so engaging in relaxing activities before bedtime is recommended. Conversely, continuing important work activities or planning shortly before bedtime or once in bed {{has been shown}} to delay <b>falling</b> asleep. Similarly, good sleep hygiene involves minimizing time spent thinking about worries or anything emotionally upsetting shortly before bedtime. Trying purposefully to fall asleep may induce frustration that further prevents <b>falling</b> asleep, so in such situations a person may be advised {{to get out of bed}} and try something else for a brief amount of time.|$|E

5|$|Galileo {{proposed}} that a <b>falling</b> body would fall with a uniform acceleration, {{as long as}} the resistance of the medium through which it was <b>falling</b> remained negligible, or in the limiting case of its <b>falling</b> through a vacuum. He also derived the correct kinematical law for the distance travelled during a uniform acceleration starting from rest—namely, that it is proportional to the square of the elapsed time (d∝t2). Prior to Galileo, Nicole Oresme, in the 14th century, had derived the times-squared law for uniformly accelerated change, and Domingo de Soto had suggested in the 16th century that bodies <b>falling</b> through a homogeneous medium would be uniformly accelerated. Galileo expressed the time-squared law using geometrical constructions and mathematically precise words, adhering to the standards of the day. (It remained for others to re-express the law in algebraic terms).|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{identify}} the relationship between <b>falls</b> efficacy, perception of <b>fall</b> risk and <b>fall</b> prevention behavior in frail elderly. The data was collected from 300 elderly through the questionnaire. 1) the mean score of <b>fall</b> efficacy was 34. 3 ± 11. 5, perception of <b>fall</b> risk was 34. 3 ± 11. 5, and <b>fall</b> prevention behavior was 17. 7 ± 2. 75. 2) <b>Fall</b> efficacy was significantly different according to <b>falls</b> experience(t= 2. 905, p<. 05). Perception of <b>fall</b> risk was significantly different according to <b>falls</b> experience (t= 2. 704, p<. 05) and <b>Fall</b> prevention behavior was significantly different according to <b>falls</b> experience (t= 2. 706, p<. 05). 3) It showed the negative relation between <b>fall</b> efficacy and perception of <b>fall</b> risk. It showed the positive relation between <b>falls</b> efficacy and <b>falls</b> prevention behaviors, and <b>falls</b> prevention behaviors and perception of <b>fall</b> risk. According to this study, it showed relation between <b>fall</b> efficacy, perception of <b>fall</b> risk and <b>falls</b> prevention behaviors.
