40|$|The Deinococcus-Thermus {{group of}} species is {{currently}} recognized as a distinct phylum {{solely on the basis}} of their branching in 16 S rRNA trees. No unique biochemical or molecular characteristics that can distinguish this group from all other bacteria are known at present. In this work, we describe eight conserved indels (viz., <b>inserts</b> or deletions) <b>in</b> seven widely distributed proteins that are distinctive characteristics of the Deinococcus-Thermus phylum but are not found in any other group of bacteria. The identified signatures include a 7 -amino-acid (aa) <b>insert</b> <b>in</b> threonyl-tRNA synthetase, 1 - and 3 -aa <b>inserts</b> <b>in</b> the RNA polymerase β′ subunit, a 5 -aa deletion in signal recognition particle (Ffh/SR 54), a 2 -aa <b>insert</b> <b>in</b> major sigma factor 70 (σ 70), a 2 -aa <b>insert</b> <b>in</b> seryl-tRNA synthetase (SerRS), a 1 -aa <b>insert</b> <b>in</b> ribosomal protein L 1, and a 2 -aa <b>insert</b> <b>in</b> UvrA homologs. By using PCR primers for conserved regions, fragments of these genes were amplified from a number of Deinococcus-Thermus species, and all such fragments (except SerRS in Deinococcus proteolyticus) were found to contain the indicated signatures. The presence of these signatures in various species from all three known genera within this phylum, viz., Deinococcus, Thermus, and Meiothermus, provide evidence that they are likely distinctive characteristics of the entire phylum which were introduced in a common ancestor of this group. The signature in SerRS, which is absent in D. proteolyticus, was likely introduced after the branching of this species. Phylogenetic studies as well as the nature of the <b>inserts</b> <b>in</b> some of these proteins (viz., σ 70 and SerRS) also support a sister group relationship between the Thermus and the Meiothermus genera. The identified signatures provide strong evidence for the monophyletic nature of the Deinococcus-Thermus phylum. These molecular markers should prove very useful in the identification of new species related to this group...|$|R

More practically, Pennant used his geological knowledge to open a lead mine, which helped to finance improvements at Downing after he had inherited the estate in 1763.|$|E

5|$|In January 2003, Canadian Brent Moffat set the World Record {{for most}} body piercings in one session (700 piercings with 18g {{surgical}} needles in 1 session of 7 hours, using play piercing where {{the skin is}} pierced and sometimes jewellery is inserted, which is worn temporarily). In December of the same year, Moffat had 900 piercings in 4½ hours. On 4 March 2006, the record was overturned by Kam Ma, who had 1,015 temporary metal rings <b>inserted</b> <b>in</b> 7 hours and 55 minutes. The record for most body piercings with surgical needles was set on 29 May 2008, when Robert Jesus Rubio allowed 900 18-gauge, -long surgical needles to be inserted into his body.|$|E

Kritschgau claims to work for not only the Department of Defense but also a congressional lobbying firm known as Roush. Mulder sees Scully and her doctor about the chip. Scully's family is skeptical, particularly her brother Bill, who is quite upset with Mulder. Scully decides to go ahead and have the chip <b>inserted</b> <b>in</b> her neck.|$|E

The production used five 3ality Technical Atom 3D rigs, four of which were configured with Red Epic 3D cameras set on camera dollies and tripods, which were continuously in use during filming.

According to Conacher, the Soviets used cross-ice passing in the attacking zone, a tactic that caused problems for Dryden. Serge Savard missed the game after fracturing his ankle in practice.|$|E
5|$|The four hymns Bach <b>inserted</b> <b>in</b> the Magnificat for the Christmas vespers had a {{tradition}} in Leipzig. A setting by Bach's predecessor Kuhnau in a Christmas cantata is extant.
