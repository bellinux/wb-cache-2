5|$|A {{tropical}} wave emerged off {{the western}} coast of Africa on August27 {{and reached the}} eastern Pacific on September7. Tracking westward, little development occurred until September18, when associated shower and thunderstorm activity began to increase. Following visible satellite trends, the National Hurricane Center deemed the disturbance organized enough to be declared a tropical depression at 0600UTC on September19, while located about 1,200mi (1930km) west-southwest of {{the southern tip of}} Baja California. <b>In</b> <b>an</b> <b>environment</b> <b>of</b> cool ocean temperatures and stable air, the depression failed to organize as it turned west-northwest. Associated deep convection dissipated, leading to degeneration into a remnant low by 0000UTC on September20. Performing a slow counter-clockwise loop, the remnant low dissipated five days later.|$|E

Historiography has long asserted that she was raised in lonely isolation, <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>environment</b> <b>of</b> religious superstition, intolerance and conservatism. It has also described Teresa Cristina as a soft and timid character, unlike her ruthless father or her impulsive mother. She has even been depicted as unassertive, and accustomed to be satisfied in whatever circumstances she found herself.|$|E

Cadets begin their USMA careers as trainees (new cadets), then advance in rank, starting as CDT Privates (freshmen) and culminating as CDT Officers (seniors). Freshmen have no leadership responsibilities, but have a host of duties to perform as they learn how to follow orders and operate <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>environment</b> <b>of</b> rigid rank structure, while seniors have significant leadership responsibilities and significantly more privileges that correspond to their rank.|$|E

5|$|The {{early life}} of Chinese revolutionary and {{politician}} Mao Zedong covered the first 27 {{years of his}} life, from 1893 to 1919. Born in Shaoshanchong, Shaoshan in Hunan province, Mao grew up {{as the son of}} Mao Yichang, a wealthy farmer and landowner. Sent to the local Shaoshan Primary School, Mao was brought up <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>environment</b> <b>of</b> Confucianism, but reacted against this from an early age, developing political ideas from modern literature. Aged 13 his father organised a marriage for him with Luo Yigu, the daughter of another land-owning family, but Mao denounced the marriage and moved away from home.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Depression One in June 1992 {{produced}} 100-year {{floods in}} portions of southwestern Florida. The first tropical depression and second tropical cyclone of the 1992 Atlantic hurricane season, the depression developed on June 25 from a tropical wave. Located <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>environment</b> <b>of</b> strong wind shear, {{much of the}} convection in the system was located well to the southeast of the poorly defined center of circulation. The depression moved northeastward and made landfall near Tampa, Florida on June 26 shortly before dissipating over land.|$|E
5|$|At 0930UTC on August17, {{the center}} of Hurricane Dean passed into the Caribbean Sea through the Saint Lucia Channel between the islands of Martinique and St. Lucia. The {{northern}} eyewall passed over Martinique where a weather station in the island's capital of Fort-de-France reported 13in (33cm) of rainfall. By this time the eyewall had closed, forming a distinct eye, and <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>environment</b> <b>of</b> low wind shear and increasing ocean temperature the hurricane began to intensify rapidly. Hurricane Dean strengthened to a Category3 hurricane by the evening of August17. Satellite imagery showed that a well defined eye and numerous cyclonically curved convective bands remained over the Lesser Antilles. That evening, another reconnaissance aircraft reached the hurricane and discovered that it had strengthened into a Category4 hurricane, and by 0600UTC on August18, Dean reached Category5 intensity {{for the first time}} with 165mph (270km/h) winds. The storm's wind radii increased in all quadrants as the storm grew in both intensity and size. At 0800UTC August18, Hurricane Dean passed directly over NOAA sea buoy 42059 which reported a significant wave height (average size of the largest 33% of waves) of 33ft (10m). On August18, Hurricane Dean developed a double eyewall, indicating that an eyewall replacement cycle was taking place and causing short term fluctuations in intensity as Dean weakened back to a Category4 hurricane. That afternoon the hurricane continued to improve its outflow, and its numerous spiral bands gave it a well defined satellite presentation. Hurricane Dean finished the eyewall replacement cycle early on August19 with some trochiodal wobbles.|$|E

5|$|During {{a couple}} of the Svea flights, Andrée tested and tried out the drag-rope {{steering}} technique which he had developed and wanted to use on his projected North Pole expedition. Drag ropes, which hang from the balloon basket and drag part of their length on the ground, are designed to counteract the tendency of lighter-than-air craft to travel at the same speed as the wind, a situation that makes steering by sails impossible. The friction of the ropes was intended to slow the balloon {{to the point where the}} sails would have an effect (beyond that of making the balloon rotate on its axis). Andrée reported, and presumably believed, that with drag rope/sails steering he had succeeded in deviating about ten degrees either way from the wind direction. This notion is rejected by modern balloonists; the Swedish Ballooning Association maintains that Andrée's belief that he had deviated from the wind was mistaken, being misled by inexpertise and a surfeit of enthusiasm <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>environment</b> <b>of</b> variable winds and poor visibility. Use of drag ropes (prone to snapping, falling off, or becoming entangled with each other or the ground, in addition to being ineffective) is not considered by any modern expert to be a useful steering technique.|$|E

25|$|To prevent gas {{porosity}} the material may be melted in a vacuum, <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>environment</b> <b>of</b> low-solubility gases, such as argon or carbon dioxide, or under a flux that prevents {{contact with the}} air. To minimize gas solubility the superheat temperatures can be kept low. Turbulence from pouring the liquid metal into the mold can introduce gases, so the molds are often streamlined to minimize such turbulence. Other methods include vacuum degassing, gas flushing, or precipitation. Precipitation involves reacting the gas with another element to form a compound that will form a dross that floats to the top. For instance, oxygen can be removed from copper by adding phosphorus; aluminum or silicon {{can be added to}} steel to remove oxygen. A third source consists of reactions of the molten metal with grease or other residues in the mould.|$|E
25|$|For a poorly-resourced mission, {{the cost}} of {{maintaining}} the steamer required a strong focus on local provisioning. With a draught permitting access to {{all areas of the}} lake, the ship itself was largely self-sustaining, her steam engine powered by wood scavenged from the shore areas. But the matter of slave raiding was more problematic, requiring not only manpower for site security, but also an appreciation of the uneasy boundaries that lay between the worlds of evangelism, medicine and trade. Finding appropriately qualified crew prepared to accept low pay and the tribulations of life on the lake was one thing; the Mission’s unyielding insistence on celibacy among its European staff was an even greater recruitment challenge. Behind all this lay the tensions arising from the Mission’s intentional policy of overextension of its mission surrounding Lake Nyasa. The Chauncy Maples operated in the contradictory world of an evangelical mission which offered desperately needed medical support to the poor <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>environment</b> <b>of</b> political instability and unfettered imperial capitalism.|$|E
