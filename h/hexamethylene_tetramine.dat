We have here investigated four new [Ru(phen) (2) (dppz) ](2 +) derivatives with different bulky quaternary ammonium substituents on the dppz ligand to find relationships between molecular structure and intercalation kinetics, {{which is considered}} to be of importance for antitumor applicability. Linear dichroism spectroscopy shows that the enantiomers of the new complexes exhibit very similar binding geometries (intercalation of dppz moiety between adjacent DNA base pairs) as the enantiomers of the parent [Ru(phen) (2) (dppz) ](2 +) complex. Absorption spectra and luminescence properties provide further evidence for a final intercalative binding mode which has to be reached by threading of a bulky moiety between the strands of the DNA. Delta-enantiomers of all the new complexes show much slower association and dissociation kinetics than that of a reference complex without a cationic substituent. Kinetics were not very different whether the bulky quaternary group was derived from <b>hexamethylene</b> <b>tetramine</b> or 1, 4 -diazabicyclo-(2, 2, 2) octane (DABCO) or whether it had one or two positive charges. However, a complex in which the <b>hexamethylene</b> <b>tetramine</b> substituent is attached via a phenyl group showed a lowered association rate, in addition to an improved quantum yield of luminescence.

Moreover, the fiber-filled composites anisotropy in stress-strain properties due to preferential of the short fibers along the milling direction (longitudinal), which is substantiated by the results of swelling and fractography studies. Aging causes an increase in the modulus, tensile strength and hardness of the composites. The fractographs show an increase in interfacial adhesion between the fibers and the matrix during aging, which is further confirmed by the reduction in tan peak height of the aged composites during dynamic mechanical studies. Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) studies reveal the formation of an interphase with the addition of bonding agents and a better fiber-matrix adhesion due to aging. AFM images also confirm the role of dry bonding systems in improving the fiber-matrix adhesion of the aged vulcanizates. The composite modulus has been theoretically calculated using the well-known Halpin-Tsai equation.

Samples of all resins were supplied to Geo 2 laboratories for {{assessment of their}} efficacy in a proprietary heavy metal remediation process. Two of these resins, DMA- 1 and CMS- 2, were prepared in bulk to supply pilot scale testing. The crosslinked resin-bead substrates used were: chloromethylated polystyrene (CMS), diethylenetriamine poly(methacrylamide) (DMA), glycidyl methacrylate (GMA), and three types of poly(methyl methacrylate) (MMA, MMB & MMC) {{with varying degrees of}} porosity and crosslinking. The alkyl halide moiety of CMS was used to anchor 2 ° or 3 ° alkylamines, diethylenetriamine, tris(2 -aminoethylamine), or a quaternary ammonium group. Alternatively, a primary amine group was introduced via hydrolysis of <b>hexamethylene</b> <b>tetramine.</b> Poly(ethylene glycol) s of various sizes were affixed to the chloromethylated substrate via Williamson ether synthesis to form "pseudocrown" ether chains. Benzocrown ether groups were produced by anchoring catechol to the CMS resin and subsequent reaction with a,codichloropoly(ethylene glycol). Functional groups on poly(methyl methacrylate) resins were introduced via hydrolysis of the backbone, or by aminolysis with tris(2 - aminoethyl) amine or 2 -aminoethanol. The epoxide moiety of GMA was alkylated with either high-pressure ammonia, tris(2 -aminoethyl) amine, or various grades of poly(ethylene glycol) s. Hydrolysis of the epoxide in aqueous acid was also investigated. Resins with aminocarboxylate moieties were prepared via carboxymethylation of resins with primary amine or diethylenetriamine groups (including DMA), using excess chloroacetic acid in aqueous carbonate solution. The moieties prepared were diethylenetriamine triacetic- and tetraacetic- acids, and aminodiacetic acid. Several nonporous pseudocrown ether materials were also produced via copolymerisation, yielding urethane or methacrylate substrates. The resins were characterised by elemental analysis, and by their Infra-Red spectra. A subset of resins was also characterised by their affinity and capacity to adsorb metal ions in aqueous solution. The sorption of copper from a 75 ppm solution into these resins was measured over a 25 hour period. Adsorption isotherms for Cu 2 + in 0. 010 M aqueous hydrochloric acid were also obtained in the range 10 - 75 ppm. The highest metal capacities were achieved with aminocarboxylate functionalities; amine resins adsorbed very little...|$|E
