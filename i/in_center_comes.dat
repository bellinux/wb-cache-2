40|$|Growth {{of massive}} black holes (MBHs) <b>in</b> galactic <b>centers</b> <b>comes</b> mainly from gas {{accretion}} during their QSO/AGN phases. In this paper we apply an extended Soltan argument, connecting the local MBH mass function with the time-integral of the QSO luminosity function, to the demography of MBHs and QSOs from recent optical and X-ray surveys, and obtain robust {{constraints on the}} luminosity evolution (or mass growth history) of individual QSOs (or MBHs). We find that the luminosity evolution probably involves two phases: an initial exponentially increasing phase set by the Eddington limit and a following phase in which the luminosity declines with time as a power law (with a slope of - 1. 2 [...] 1. 3) set by a self-similar long-term evolution of disk accretion. Neither an evolution involving only the increasing phase with a single Eddington ratio nor an exponentially declining pattern {{in the second phase}} is likely.

Therefore, investigation of different medical education approaches would {{have a major impact on}} improving the quality of education. The aim of this study was investigating the performance of community-based education center of Kermanshah from the viewpoint of medical interns.  Methods: In this cross sectional analytic study, medical interns who were trained <b>in</b> community-oriented education <b>center</b> (n= 175) over one month were enrolled and completed the researcher built questionnaire. Alpha reliability was 0. 88 and its content validity was confirmed by the approval of five faculty members who were expert in the field of education. Data was analyzed by SPSS software and using of descriptive statistics, ANOVA and Friedman tests.  Results: Based on the viewpoint of our participants, community oriented education were desirable compare to education in hospital in terms of quality of education (42 / 4 %), experienced of practical tips (48 / 3 %), observing different cases (57 / 2 %), preventive medicine education (55 / 6 %) and time for communicating about patient (74 %). Among reasons of difference between training <b>in</b> the <b>COME</b> <b>center</b>  compare to teaching hospitals, "possibility of learning of practical tips" was considered more important than other reasons (P< 0. 05).

40|$|Abstract — A {{fundamental}} goal of data-center networking is to efficiently interconnect a {{large number}} of servers with low equipment cost. Several server-centric network structures for data centers have been proposed. They, however, are not truly expansible and suffer low degree of regularity and symmetry. Inspired that the commodity servers <b>in</b> today’s data <b>centers</b> <b>come</b> with two built-in NIC ports, we consider how to build expansible and cost-effective structures without expensive high-end switches and additional hardware on servers except the two NIC ports. In this paper, two such network structures called HCN and BCN are designed, both of which are of server degree 2. We also develop low-overhead and robust routing mechanisms for HCN and BCN. Although the server degree is only 2, HCN can be expanded very easily to encompass hundreds of thousands servers with low diameter and high bisection width. Additionally, HCN offers high degree of regularity, scalability and symmetry, which very well conform to a modular design of data centers. BCN is the largest known network structure for data centers with server degree 2 and network diameter 7. Furthermore, BCN has many attractive features, including low diameter, high bisection width, large number of node-disjoint paths for one-to-one traffic, and good fault-tolerance ability. Mathematical analysis and comprehensive simulations show that HCN and BCN possess excellent topology properties and are viable network structures for data centers. I...|$|R
