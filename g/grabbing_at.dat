25|$|During an open team {{practice}} {{before the}} 2002 World Cup, Ljungberg {{broke into a}} fight with teammate Olof Mellberg after a robust tackle from the latter. Ljungberg pushed Mellberg {{right in front of}} the world press and Mellberg responded by <b>grabbing</b> <b>at</b> Ljungberg's jersey top at throat level before the two wrestled on the ground. The two of them were quickly separated by shocked teammates and the team practice was immediately cancelled to deal with the public relations disaster. Within hours, video footage of the fight flooded the media and internet.|$|E
500|$|One man and {{one woman}} are chosen for each year the Queen has lived (including the year she is {{currently}} living), and they receive Maundy money equivalent in pence to that number of years. Recipients attend a [...] "Maundy Lecture" [...] in the cathedral {{in advance of the}} service to familiarise them with what will happen. [...] The cathedral is designated the Royal Chapel for the day of the service, and the Royal Standard flies. The purses are carried into the church by the Yeomen on silver dishes, held above their heads. [...] The origin of this custom is uncertain but apparently dates from the times when provisions were distributed to the poor; some experts believe the dishes were carried high to stop the poor from <b>grabbing</b> <b>at</b> the food prematurely; others believe that the position was to prevent the congregation from being overwhelmed by the smell of fish.|$|E
2500|$|The {{site has}} been treated and {{explored}} according {{to the standards of}} neither professional archaeology nor careful law-enforcement investigative technique. [...] The official government re-opening in 1991 featured bulldozers, not ultrasound or hand tools. The professional observer stood by in anguish as non-professionals sloshed through the pit, <b>grabbing</b> <b>at</b> bits of ceramic or bone. [...] Evidence indicates that the pit was opened at least once between the re-burial efforts and the [...] "official" [...] opening.

2500|$|The stage {{show for}} the Last Rights tour in North America, much like the album itself, was built around a {{detailed}} narrative inspired by Ogre's past ordeals with drug abuse. The shows involved Ogre interacting with a backing film, a virtual reality machine which was accompanied with [...] "mind-bending" [...] computer-generated effects, and numerous costumes such as the Guilt Man suit, laden with hypodermic needle. For this tour, Key focused exclusively on live drumming, employing a full drum set complete with noise gates and triggers. One incident that occurred at a show in Boston involved several concert goers climbing on stage and <b>grabbing</b> <b>at</b> Ogre's various masks and props, several of which were stolen. The band's manager, Tim Gore, pursued the thieves but was punched by a security guard. Gore began experiencing issues breathing and {{was taken to a}} hospital; the guard was fired {{as a result of the}} incident.|$|E
2500|$|Wallace {{previously}} {{stated that}} filming the baby swap storylines [...] "did not stretch her acting abilities". She told Buzz: [...] "None of it's been really tough for me, {{to tell you}} the truth. I go in, do my scenes and then I go home. As an actress you want to get roles you can get your teeth into. I leave it at the gates when I leave work. Years ago, with the storyline when Kat told Zoe Slater she was her real mother, I found it tougher because I was new to the game. But I've been doing it a lot longer now, and can detach myself from it. You have to." [...] On a lighter note, Wallace added: [...] "There are two babies playing Tommy, called Ralph and Shane, and they're dressed in outfits like zebra-skin babygros and little denim jackets – that's the Alfie (Shane Richie) influence. They keep going for Kat's big earrings and they're always <b>grabbing</b> <b>at</b> the chicken fillets I have to wear." ...|$|E

60|$|A {{moment later}} and I was in darkness. Tom had thrown himself upon {{the top of}} me and was <b>grabbing</b> <b>at</b> me with his hands. I nearly got away, but as my head poked up under his arm the girl caught hold of it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Betty, {{where are}} you goin'?" [...] said Wetzel, <b>grabbing</b> <b>at</b> Madcap's bridle. But Betty was too quick for him. She avoided the hunter, and with a saucy laugh she wheeled the fiery little pony and urged her over the bank. Almost before any one could divine her purpose she had Madcap in the water up to her knees.|$|E
60|$|We were {{climbing}} a precipitous path sufficiently dangerous in the dark, Dominic, {{more familiar with}} it, going first and I scrambling close behind in order that I might <b>grab</b> <b>at</b> his cloak if I chanced to slip or miss my footing. I remonstrated against this arrangement as we stopped to rest. I had no doubt I would <b>grab</b> <b>at</b> his cloak if I felt myself falling. I couldn’t help doing that. But I would probably only drag him down with me.|$|R

60|$|He {{moved forward}} a pace or two, fell against {{a seat in}} an attempt to avoid a toddling child, and, <b>grabbing</b> <b>at</b> his disturber's platform, {{endeavored}} to clamber up to it. The chains rattled, and it seemed that the light boards were bodily coming down when he felt with one hand behind the curtain, part of which he rent from its fastenings. Then his hand reappeared clutching a stockinged foot, and a bronzed-faced man in shirt and trousers dropped from a neighboring resting-place.|$|E
60|$|It was he--and {{yet it was}} not he. I {{had left}} him calm in his bearing, correct in his person, prim in his dress. Now he was pale and wild-eyed, gasping as he breathed like one who has run far and fast. His gaunt face was {{scratched}} and bloody, his clothes were hanging in rags, and his hat was gone. I stared in amazement, but he gave me no chance for questions. He was <b>grabbing</b> <b>at</b> our stores {{all the time he}} spoke.|$|E

60|$|It is the {{instinct}} of Man, {{in such a}} situation, to <b>grab</b> <b>at</b> the nearest support. Henry <b>grabbed</b> <b>at</b> the Hotel Superba, {{the pride of the}} Esplanade. It was a thin wooden edifice, and it supported him for perhaps a tenth of a second. Then he staggered with it into the limelight, tripped over a Bulgarian officer who was inflating himself for a deep note, and finally fell in a complicated heap as exactly in the centre of the stage {{as if he had been}} a star of years' standing.|$|R

6000|$|Why, {{years after}} my {{tramping}} days, when I {{was a student}} in the University of California, one night I went to the circus. After the show and the concert I lingered on to watch the working of the transportation machinery of a great circus. The circus was leaving that night. By a bonfire I came upon a bunch of small boys. There were about twenty of them, and as they talked with one another I learned {{that they were going to}} run away with the circus. Now the circus-men didn't want to be bothered with this mess of urchins, and a telephone to police headquarters had [...] "coppered" [...] the play. A squad of ten policemen had been despatched to the scene to arrest the small boys for violating the nine o'clock curfew ordinance. The policemen surrounded the bonfire, and crept up close to it in the darkness. At the signal, they made a rush, each policeman <b>grabbing</b> <b>at</b> the youngsters as he would grab into a basket of squirming eels.|$|E

A dedale of lusty youth, noble every student there. Nurse Callan taken aback {{in the hallway}} cannot stay them nor smiling surgeon coming downstairs with news of placentation ended, a full pound if a milligramme. They hark him on. The door! It is open? Ha! They are out, tumultuously, off for a minute's race, all bravely legging it, Burke's of Denzille and Holles their ulterior goal. Dixon follows giving them sharp language but raps out an oath, he too, and on. Bloom stays with nurse a thought to send a kind word to happy mother and nurseling up there. Doctor Diet and Doctor Quiet. Looks she too not other now? Ward of watching in Horne's house has told its tale in that washedout pallor. Then all being gone, a glance of motherwit helping, he whispers close in going: Madam, when comes the storkbird for thee? ...|$|E
6000|$|Shelton {{shook his}} head. Never before had he felt such love for this old city. It was gone now from out his life, but {{everything}} about it seemed so good and fine; even its exclusive air was not ignoble. Clothed in the calm of history, the golden web of glorious tradition, radiant with the alchemy of memories, it bewitched him like the perfume of a woman's dress. At the entrance of a college they glanced in at the cool grey patch of stone beyond, and the scarlet of a window flowerbox--secluded, mysteriously calm--a narrow vision of the sacred past. Pale and trencher-capped, a youth with pimply face and random nose, <b>grabbing</b> <b>at</b> his cloven gown, was gazing at the noticeboard. The college porter--large man, fresh-faced, and small-mouthed--stood at his lodge door in a frank and deferential attitude. An image of routine, he looked like one engaged to give a decorous air to multitudes of pecadilloes. His blue eyes rested on the travellers. [...] "I don't know you, sirs, {{but if you want}} to speak I shall be glad to hear the observations you may have to make," [...] they seemed to say.|$|E

60|$|Two steps {{took him}} up to the waist, and he had trouble in finding solid bottom at the next, because the gravel rolled and slipped away beneath his feet in the strong stream. The current also dragged hard at his limbs, and he set his lips tight when it crept up to his ribs. Then he lost his footing, and was washed away, {{plunging}} and floundering, with now and then one toe resting momentarily upon the bottom, until he was hurled against the first of the boulders with a crash that almost drove the little remaining breath out of his body. He clung to it desperately, gasping hard; and then with a determined struggle contrived to reach the second stone, against which the stream pressed him, without finding any support for his feet. A moment or two later, Vane was washed down towards him, and <b>grabbing</b> <b>at</b> the boulder held on by it. They said nothing to each other, but they looked at the sliding water between them and the opposite bank. Carroll was getting horribly cold, and felt the power ebbing out of him; he thought if he must swim across he had better do so at once.|$|E
6000|$|I don't {{know how}} long I was asleep, {{but all of a}} sudden there was an awful scream and I was up. There was pap looking wild, and {{skipping}} around every which way and yelling about snakes. He said they was crawling up his legs; and then he would give a jump and scream, and say one had bit him on the cheek--but I couldn't see no snakes. He started and run round and round the cabin, hollering [...] "Take him off! take him off! he's biting me on the neck!" [...] I never see a man look so wild in the eyes. Pretty soon he was all fagged out, and fell down panting; then he rolled over and over wonderful fast, kicking things every which way, and striking and <b>grabbing</b> <b>at</b> the air with his hands, and screaming and saying there was devils a-hold of him. He wore out by and by, and laid still a while, moaning. Then he laid stiller, and didn't make a sound. I could hear the owls and the wolves away off in the woods, and it seemed terrible still. He was laying over by the corner. By and by he raised up part way and listened, with his head to one side. He says, very low: ...|$|E
6000|$|It is {{our case}} against the Germans that in all these three cases they have subordinated every {{consideration}} of justice and the general human welfare to a monstrous national egotism. That argument has a double edge. At present there is a vigorous campaign in America, Russia, the neutral countries generally, to represent British patriotism as equally egotistic, and our purpose in this war as a mere parallel to the German purpose. In the same manner, though perhaps with less persistency, France and Italy are also caricatured. We {{are supposed to be}} <b>grabbing</b> <b>at</b> Mesopotamia and Palestine, France at Syria; Italy is represented as pursuing a Machiavellian policy towards the unfortunate Greek republicans, with her eyes on the Greek islands and Greece in Asia. Is it not time that these base imputations were repudiated clearly and conclusively by our Alliance? And is it not time that we began to discuss in much more frank and definite terms than has hitherto been done, the nature of the international arrangement that will be needed to secure the safety of such liberated populations as those of Palestine, of the Arab regions of the old Turkish empire, of Armenia, of reunited Poland, and the like? ...|$|E
