5|$|Because planetesimals are so numerous, {{and spread}} {{throughout}} the protoplanetary disk, some survive {{the formation of a}} planetary system. Asteroids are understood to be left-over planetesimals, gradually grinding <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>down</b> into smaller and smaller bits, while comets are typically planetesimals from the farther reaches of a planetary system. Meteorites are samples of planetesimals that reach a planetary surface, and provide {{a great deal of information}} about the formation of the Solar System. Primitive-type meteorites are chunks of shattered low-mass planetesimals, where no thermal differentiation took place, while processed-type meteorites are chunks from shattered massive planetesimals.|$|E
5|$|Peter {{suddenly}} {{wakes up}} to find himself in the machine in 2011, only one minute since he entered it, and Olivia waiting by his side; concurrently, in the parallel universe, Walternate attempts to convince Fauxlivia to help stop the machine. Peter recalls the memories from the future, and uses the machine to merge the machine rooms from both universes into one thus creating a bridge. While Olivia and Walter and their doppelgangers stare <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>down,</b> Peter convinces the two sides {{to work together to}} try to repair the damage to save both universes, then suddenly disappears. The Olivias and Walters cautiously agree that they need to put aside their differences to save both worlds, apparently unaware of Peter's disappearance. Outside on Liberty Island in the prime universe, the Observers watch as September (Michael Cerveris) notes to December (Eugene Lipinski) that Peter has already been forgotten by his friends, his purpose having been served, and explains that Peter now never existed.|$|E
5|$|Snowboarding is a {{sport that}} has been contested at the Winter Olympic Games since the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan. Snowboarding was one of five new sports or {{disciplines}} added to the Winter Olympic programme between 1992 and 2002, and {{was the only one}} not to have been a previous medal or demonstration event. In 1998, four events, two for men and two for women, were held in two specialities: the giant slalom, a downhill event similar to giant slalom skiing; and the half-pipe, in which competitors perform tricks while going from one side of a semi-circular ditch to the other. Canadian Ross Rebagliati won the men's giant slalom and became the first athlete to win a gold medal in snowboarding. Rebagliati was briefly stripped of his medal by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) after testing positive for marijuana. However, the IOC's decision was reverted following an appeal from the Canadian Olympic Association. For the 2002 Winter Olympics, the giant slalom was dropped in favour of the parallel giant slalom, an event that involves head-to-head racing. In 2006, a third event, the snowboard cross, was held for the first time. In this event, competitors race against <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>down</b> a course with jumps, beams and other obstacles.|$|E

25|$|There is {{an optimal}} bowling ball {{speed at which}} the player maximizes the chance to knock down all ten bowling pins. Optimal ball speed, which {{is defined as the}} time it takes for the ball to travel from one foot past the foul line to the head pin, is 2.3 seconds (this number can shift to 2.2 or 2.4 {{depending}} on the dryness or slickness of the lane). A ball that is rolled too fast will not give the pins enough time to “mix” with other pins, or in other words, to knock <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>down</b> in a domino effect motion. Conversely, a ball rolled too slowly will deflect too much and {{will not be able to}} knock down all the pins.|$|E

25|$|Operation Barbarossa {{was planned}} as a blitzkrieg {{intended}} {{to last a}} few weeks. By the autumn of 1941 {{it was clear that}} this the operation would not accomplish its goals, and leading Finnish military officers started to doubt Germany's capability to finish the war quickly. German troops in northern Finland faced circumstances they were not properly prepared for, and failed to reach their targets, most importantly Murmansk. As the lines stabilized, Finland sent out peace feelers to the Soviet Union several times. Germany was alarmed by this, and reacted by drawing down shipments of desperately needed materials each time. The idea that Finland had to continue the war while putting its own forces in the least possible danger gained increasing support, perhaps {{in the hope that the}} Wehrmacht and the Red Army would wear <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>down</b> enough for negotiations to begin, or to at least get them out of the way of Finland's independent decisions. Nationalist elements, including the IKL, may also have continued to hope for an eventual victory by Germany.|$|E
25|$|On 5 December 2009 Martínez fought Paul Williams in a non-title middleweight bout at Atlantic City's Boardwalk Hall in a {{fight that}} was later {{described}} as a fight of the year candidate. In the first round Williams and Martínez would both knock <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>down</b> once. Martínez would then seem to control the next two rounds with effective power punching. Then Williams seemed to narrowly {{take control of the}} fight when he seemingly won rounds 4, 5, 6 and 7 by landing hard left hands to the side of Martínez's head. Rounds 8–10 then signified that the fight would be close on the score-cards when Martínez won those rounds by repeating what he did in rounds 2 and 3. Then in the final 2 rounds (11–12), both fighters began to fade although the exchanges remained very closely contested, although Williams was far more active and therefore would seemingly win those final 2 rounds {{based on the fact that}} he was far more active in the last 2 rounds of the fight. That would turn out to be the case as Williams would escape with a majority decision victory with scores of 114–114, 119–110 (for Williams) and 115–113 (for Williams).|$|E
25|$|The {{other main}} feud {{on the card}} was between three tag teams, Kurt Angle and Chris Benoit, Edge and Rey Mysterio, and Los Guerreros (Eddie and Chavo Guerrero), over the WWE Tag Team Championships. On the October 3 edition of SmackDown, General Manager, Stephanie McMahon {{announced}} an eight team tournament to determine the new WWE tag team champions for the previous pay-per-view, No Mercy. On that edition, Los Guerreros defeated Rikishi and Mark Henry in the first Quarter Final round. The following week on SmackDown, in the second Quarter Final round, Kurt Angle and Chris Benoit defeated John Cena and Billy Kidman while Edge and Rey Mysterio defeated WWE Champion Brock Lesnar and Tajiri {{to advance to the}} Semi-Finals tournament the following week. On the October 17 edition of SmackDown, Edge and Mysterio defeated Reverend D-Von and Ron Simmons to advance to the tournament. Later on that edition, Angle and Benoit advanced to the tournament by defeating Los Guerreros. At No Mercy, Angle and Benoit defeated Edge and Mysterio in the finals of a tournament to determine the first WWE Tag Team Champions. On the October 24 edition of SmackDown, Edge and Rey Mysterio defeated Los Guerreros in a number one contenders tag match to earn a shot at the tag titles. Later that night, the WWE Tag Team Champions, Kurt Angle and Chris Benoit fought each other in an Unforgiven return match, which Benoit won after interference from Los Guerreros. The following week on SmackDown, both Benoit and Angle cost one another their matches. Angle helped Edge defeat Benoit then later that night, Benoit returned the favor by helping Eddie Guerrero defeat Angle. Afterwords, Angle and Benoit brawled at the halloween party, ending with Angle delivering an Angle slam and Benoit bashing the bottle into Angle's head at the same time, knocking <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>down.</b> On the November 7 edition of SmackDown, Angle and Benoit lost the WWE Tag team titles to Edge and Mysterio in the best 2 out of 3 falls match after Edge pinned Angle in the third and final fall.|$|E

The final round saw the former champions taking <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>down</b> and exchanging punches. The back and forth action rewarded both competitors with Fight of the Night honors. After the fight Hughes and Serra embraced each other and ended their feud. Hughes posted on his blog: [...] "When the fight was over, I was pretty confident I was going to get my hand raised. Some people have asked why I raised his hand at the end. Actually I didn't, he raised mine. He also told me that, no matter what the decision was, he was done with the rivalry".

2500|$|The Oka Crisis was a {{land dispute}} between {{a group of}} Mohawk people {{and the town of}} Oka in {{southern}} Quebec, which began on July 11, 1990, and lasted until September 26, 1990. On August 8, Quebec premier Robert Bourassa had announced at a press conference that he had invoked Section 275 of the National Defence Act to requisition [...] military support in [...] "aid of the civil power". A right available to provincial governments that was enacted after one police officer and two Mohawk were killed during the conflict. The Chief of the Defence Staff, General John de Chastelain placed Federal, Quebec-based troops in support of the provincial authorities. During Operation Salon some 2,500 regular and reserve troops were mobilized. Troops and mechanized equipment mobilized at staging areas around Oka and Montreal, while reconnaissance aircraft staged air photo missions over Mohawk territory to gather intelligence. Despite high tensions between military and First Nations forces, no shots were exchanged.

2500|$|The seventh match {{featured}} Brock Lesnar and Goldberg {{with special}} guest referee, Steve Austin. The {{beginning of the}} match began with both men staring <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>down,</b> jawing back and forth, with no physical action for several minutes, causing an exasperated Austin at one point to coax them into locking up. The fact that they both were leaving the WWE immediately after the match, {{as well as the}} lack of effort brought forth by both Goldberg and Lesnar drew large heat from the fans throughout the match, with fans chanting, [...] "You sold out", the chorus of Steam's [...] "Na Na Na Hey Hey Kiss Him Goodbye", [...] "Austin", [...] "This match sucks", [...] "We want Bret", [...] "Boring", [...] "Goldberg sucks", and [...] "Hogan". Goldberg then executed a Spear on Lesnar for a near-fall. Lesnar then executed the F-5 on Goldberg for a near-fall. Afterwards, Lesnar missed an attempt to knock Goldberg down, allowing Goldberg to execute another spear and a Jackhammer for the victory. After the match, Lesnar responded to the fans' criticism by gesturing his middle finger at the crowd, which was actually directed towards Vince McMahon, and to Austin. Austin then executed a Stone Cold Stunner on both competitors to the crowd's delight and celebrated with beer in the ring.|$|E
2500|$|Ferraro {{eventually}} joined Demon Ortiz {{to form a}} {{new version}} of The Alliance of Violence later that year. On October 1, Ortiz confronted him during a match against Vortex. This was Ortiz' first appearance in the promotion since being injured by Ferraro back in April. As the two stared <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>down,</b> in preparation for a fight, Ortiz inexplicably attacked Ferraro's opponent causing a disqualification and left the ring together. The next night in Lawrence, he and Ortiz interfered in a tag team match between four young trainees from the Chaotic Training Center (Vortex & “Western Dragon” Wesley Thomas vs. Alec the Alien & Dudley DL Dawson) causing a no-contest when they attacked all four participants and the referee. At CW's [...] "Lowell Street Fight", they wrestled Julian Starr and Chase Del Monte. On November 12, Ferraro was in Ortiz' corner in his match against Rick Fuller. They challenged Julian Starr and Matt Logan for the Chaotic Wrestling Tag Team Championship in Hudson, Massachusetts the next day, but were unable to win the belts. On December 3, 2010, The Alliance of Violence and Chase Del Monte & Rick Fuller battled to a double-countout at CW's [...] "Fan Appreciation Night" [...] in Lowell, Massachusetts.

2500|$|The feud between The Rock and Jericho {{had started}} {{while the two}} were uneasy allies due to their mutual hatred of Alliance {{co-owner}} Stephanie McMahon. The Rock kept reminding Jericho {{that he had never}} won [...] "the big one" [...] (a world heavyweight championship) and wrote Jericho off as a [...] "comedy act". On the October 11 episode of SmackDown!, Jericho defeated Rob Van Dam of The Alliance to become the number one contender to Rock's WCW Championship (later renamed the World Championship). At No Mercy he defeated The Rock to win the title, becoming a world champion {{for the first time in}} his career. The following night on Raw, Jericho and The Rock put their differences aside and won the WWF Tag Team Championship when they defeated The Dudley Boyz (Bubba Ray and D-Von). On the October 29 episode of Raw, Rock and Jericho successfully defended the WWF Tag team titles against then Alliance members, Booker T and Test but a few days later on SmackDown!, they dropped the titles to Booker T and Test after Jericho inadvertently Missile dropkicked The Rock, enabling Test to nail Rock with the big boot for the victory. After the match, The Rock and Jericho stared <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>down,</b> which ended with Rock nailing Jericho with two Rock Bottoms. Later on that episode, Rock challenged Jericho for the WCW Championship in a No Mercy rematch. On the November 5 episode of Raw, The Rock defeated Jericho to win the title back with a surprise roll up, beginning his second WCW Championship reign. Irate at having lost the title, Jericho savagely attacked Rock after the match and hit him with a steel chair and the championship. Jericho was made part of Team WWF for the Winner Take All match at Survivor Series, promising that he would put his differences with Rock aside for the good of the company. However, Jericho attacked The Rock following his elimination from the match and nearly cost Team WWF the victory. The feud resumed after Jericho attacked Rock on Raw the next night and escalated leading up to Vengeance.|$|E
