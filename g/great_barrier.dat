5|$|According to an {{analysis}} by Tim Flannery, the ecosystem of Lord Howe Island is threatened by climate change and global warming, with the reefs at risk from rises in water temperature. The <b>Great</b> <b>Barrier</b> Reef is specifically identified as being at risk {{to the effects of}} global warming on Australia, and the same analysis applies to the reefs of Lord Howe Island. Cool climate flora and fauna are at risk from rises in temperature, because there is limited scope for migration to higher altitudes.. The first international conference on global artificial photosynthesis as a climate change solution occurred at Lord Howe island in 2011, the papers being published by the Australian Journal of Chemistry.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} {{to the search for}} the remains of the ship herself, there was considerable Australian interest in locating relics of the ship's south Pacific voyage. In 1886, the Working Men's Progress Association of Cooktown sought to recover the sixcannons thrown overboard when Endeavour grounded on the <b>Great</b> <b>Barrier</b> Reef. A £300 reward was offered for anyone who could locate and recover the guns, but searches that year and the next were fruitless and the money went unclaimed. Remains of equipment left at Endeavour River were discovered in around 1900, and in 1913 the crew of a merchant steamer erroneously claimed to have recovered an Endeavour cannon from shallow water near the Reef.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: Despite the {{well-established}} {{benefits of}} cardiac rehabilitation (CR) and greater need, under-represented populations {{are less likely}} to utilize CR compared to their counterparts. To date, there has been limited research to quantify CR barriers in these under-represented groups and there has been lack of research to assess whether barriers differ by program model. This dissertation examined CR utilization and barriers to CR use among rural and urban inhabitants, patients of low socioeconomic status (SES) and high SES, Chinese-Canadian and North American patients, and home-based versus site-based CR. Method: Cardiac patients from hospitals across Ontario, Canada completed a survey which included the Cardiac Rehabilitation Barriers Scale among other variables for this cross-sectional study. Results: Findings suggested that rural inhabitants attended significantly fewer CR sessions, and perceived <b>greater</b> CR <b>barriers</b> overall compared to urban inhabitants. These included distance, cost, and transportation problems. In addition, patients of lower SES {{were less likely to be}} referred, enroll, and participate in CR, and reported significantly <b>greater</b> <b>barriers</b> to CR compared to their high-SES counterparts. <b>Greater</b> <b>barriers</b> for low-SES patients included severe weather, distance, cost, and transportation problems. Moreover, Chinese-Canadian patients were significantly more likely to be referred to CR compared to North Americans, but there were no significant differences with regard to utilization. Chinese-Canadian patients reported significantly <b>greater</b> CR <b>barriers</b> compared to North Americans, specifically severe weather and transportation problems. Also, appropriately, home-based CR participants reported <b>greater</b> <b>barriers</b> including distance when compared to site-based participants. Conclusion: Broader application of proven strategies to promote greater CR enrolment and completion is needed, as well as development of tailored interventions to address the primary barriers identified for these vulnerable subpopulations of patients...|$|R

5|$|The {{plan was}} that the convoy sail north to {{rendezvous}} at Lord Howe Island, then set a course broadly parallel to the <b>Great</b> <b>Barrier</b> Reef {{with the aim of}} reaching the Dutch port of Batavia. From there the convoy would sail west through the Sunda Straits to the Cape of Good Hope, then north through the Atlantic to England. This route was comparatively well mapped – the first part largely mirroring that of James Cook in his first voyage in the Pacific from 1768 to 1771, and the remainder from Batavia being the traditional route of Dutch East Indiamen returning to Europe. Shortland estimated the voyage would take the convoy between six and ten months.|$|E
5|$|The {{range of}} the {{epaulette}} shark extends from the southern coast of New Guinea to the northern coast of Australia, {{as far south as}} Sydney. The Capricorn-Bunker Group of the <b>Great</b> <b>Barrier</b> Reef contains a particularly large population, with thousands estimated to inhabit the reefs around Heron Island alone. Additionally, there are unsubstantiated reports of this species from Malaysia, Sumatra, and the Solomon Islands. Epaulette sharks are found in shallow water to a maximum depth of 50m (160ft), and are often seen in water barely deep enough to cover their bodies. They prefer tidal pools, coral flats, and stands of staghorn coral.|$|E

This study applied a mixed-mode design involving data source triangulation using semistructured interviews with classroom teachers (n = 31) and teacher-completed questionnaires (n = 189) from a random sample of 38 schools. Results identified the key factors inhibiting PE teachers, which were categorized as teacher-related or institutional. Interestingly, the five <b>greatest</b> <b>barriers</b> were defined as institutional or out of the teacher’s control.

5|$|There {{are various}} types of shallow-water coral reef, {{including}} fringing reefs, barrier reefs and atolls; most occur in tropical and subtropical seas. They are very slow-growing, adding perhaps one centimetre (0.4in) in height each year. The <b>Great</b> <b>Barrier</b> Reef {{is thought to have}} been laid down about two million years ago. Over time, corals fragment and die, sand and rubble accumulates between the corals, and the shells of clams and other molluscs decay to form a gradually evolving calcium carbonate structure. Coral reefs are extremely diverse marine ecosystems hosting over 4,000 species of fish, massive numbers of cnidarians, molluscs, crustaceans, and many other animals.|$|E

Over the next four days, the party island-hopped northward within the lagoon, aware that their movements were being closely monitored by natives on the mainland. Strains were showing within the party; following a heated disagreement with Purcell, Bligh grabbed a cutlass and challenged the carpenter to fight. Fryer told Cole to arrest their captain, but backed down after Bligh threatened to kill him if he interfered.|$|E

The small, attractively colored young also find their way into the hands of private hobbyists, though this species grows far too large for the home aquarium.|$|E
5|$|In April 1770, Endeavour {{became the}} first ship to reach {{the east coast of}} Australia, when Cook went ashore at what is now known as Botany Bay. Endeavour then sailed north along the Australian coast. She {{narrowly}} avoided disaster after running aground on the <b>Great</b> <b>Barrier</b> Reef, and Cook had to throw her guns overboard to lighten her. He then beached her on the mainland for seven weeks to permit rudimentary repairs to her hull. On 10 October 1770, she limped into port in Batavia (now named Jakarta) in the Dutch East Indies for more substantial repairs, her crew sworn to secrecy about the lands they had visited. She resumed her westward journey on 26 December, rounded the Cape of Good Hope on 13 March 1771, and reached the English port of Dover on 12 July, having been at sea for nearly three years.|$|E
5|$|Off South Africa, {{the round}} ribbontail ray is {{captured}} incidentally by prawn trawlers on offshore banks, {{but is not}} utilized. Because of its size and strength, it is also prized by sport anglers, who usually release it unharmed. South Africa sets a recreational bag limit of one ray per species per person per day, and does not allow spearfishing for this species. In Australian waters, this ray has been assessed as of Least Concern. Although it is caught (and discarded) by prawn trawlers, this mortality has been reduced by the mandatory installation of Turtle Excluder Devices (TEDs). Furthermore, a portion of its Australian range lies within the <b>Great</b> <b>Barrier</b> Reef Marine Park. This species has also been listed under Least Concern in the Maldives where, due to the tourist value of rays, the government has created protected marine reserves and banned the export of rays in 1995 and ray skins in 1996.|$|E
