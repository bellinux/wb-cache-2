50|$|EESI {{grew out}} of the Environmental Study Conference, a {{bipartisan}} and bicameral Congressional caucas originally launched in 1975 by former Congressman Richard (Dick) Ottinger, John Heinz, and Gilbert Gude. Because the Conference was unable to support its work entirely on Congressional funds and rules prohibited the receipt of outside financial support, in 1984 the leadership of the Study Conference launched an independent non-profit, the Environmental and <b>Energy</b> <b>Study</b> Institute (EESI) to continue the Conference's mission to provide information and policy resources to Congress on energy and environmental issues. EESI was established as a separate and distinct 501(c)(3) non-profit, overseen by an independent board of directors, which included several Members of Congress.|$|E
50|$|A 2007 Department of <b>Energy</b> <b>study</b> {{found the}} {{potential}} for 135,000 megawatts of {{combined heat and power}} (which uses energy recovery) in the U.S., and a Lawrence Berkley National Laboratory study identified about 64,000 megawatts that could be obtained from industrial waste energy, not counting CHP. These studies suggest that about 200,000 megawatts, or 20%, of total power capacity could come from energy recycling in the U.S. Widespread use of energy recycling could therefore reduce global warming emissions by an estimated 20 percent. Indeed, as of 2005, about 42% of U.S. greenhouse gas pollution came from the production of electricity and 27% from the production of heat.|$|E
