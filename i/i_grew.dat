The album also featured a sensitive song, Mä uskon huomispäivään ("I Believe in Tomorrow"). Other well-known songs from the album are Playboy 60 v ("Playboy 60 yrs"), Suomi–Ruotsi ("Finland–Sweden") and Taas lapsuuden maisemiin ("Back Again to Where <b>I</b> <b>Grew</b> Up").|$|E
5|$|The ironic {{thing is}} that we grew up {{listening}} to primarily American music {{and fell in love with}} American music. I love country music. <b>I</b> <b>grew</b> up with George Jones and Charley Pride and Jim Reeves. All that stuff was playing in the house. That's what I wanted to seek out. That's what I wanted to play. Carol was into Tammy Wynette. Trev Warner is Kym's dad, and he was the first person to bring bluegrass music to Australia.|$|E

And then my brother is a big influence on me. He's like 10 years older than me, so you always wanna be around your cool brother and hang out, so <b>I</b> <b>grew</b> up loving Guns N' Roses. I was all about Metallica. I was all about all those bands, and I still am. I love Aerosmith and No Doubt. I have so many influences on me that are so different. And even country. I love Reba McEntire. I could listen to her all the time.|$|E

In January 2015, he joined Orphans in Need, an international NGO, as a Global Brand Ambassador and carried the charity's logo on his bat. Speaking after his stint at the crease, Moeen Ali said, “I enjoy {{coming back to the}} community where <b>I</b> <b>grew</b> up playing tapeball cricket. It keeps you grounded.

25|$|<b>I</b> <b>grew</b> {{up on the}} Jersey Shore, on {{a little}} barrier island. The Atlantic Ocean was on one side, the bay was on the other. Everyone there hunted and fished and clammed and got crabs out of the bay. And one day my brother told me someone had {{come down from the}} Bureau of Petty Harassment or {{something}} and they measured the temperature of the water and had decided it was a little too warm and a certain type of bacteria might incubate in it and there was a chance that might harm the clams. And so, from now on, no one was supposed to take clams out of the bay anymore. Which everyone ignored. And no one died. That was before the government got tenacious about this stuff. So I thought that was pretty stupid right there.|$|E
25|$|Jim Wyatt, of the Tennesseean, {{reports that}} Ringer is the {{favorite}} for the 3rd string job, and almost a lock to make the roster. Fullback Ahmard Hall said “He’s a character guy, and you could tell that from the start, He’s the total package. You rarely get that combination of humility and natural athletic ability and I think he has that great combination. You combine those two and you get someone who could be unstoppable.’’ Of all the praise, Ringer responded, “I have to give credit to how I was brought up. <b>I</b> <b>grew</b> up in a religious family and I know without God {{none of this would}} be possible for me anyway, so that definitely keeps me humble. My personality is not to boast and brag about the accomplishments and things I am trying to do. Actions speak louder than words and that is what I try and strive for.’’ In a 17-23 loss to the Cleveland Browns, Ringer only had one run for two yards. Ringer finished off the pre-season with a 7 carry 18 yard performance, in a 27-13 win over the Green Bay Packers.|$|E

500|$|... "Close My Eyes" [...] is a downtempo piano led song, {{which runs}} for a {{duration}} of four minutes and 19 seconds. The lyrical {{content of the}} song speaks indirectly about Carey's relationship with Mottola, and reflects on times in her life where she has had personal struggles and troubles. Her past {{is presented in the}} lyrics [...] "I was a wayward child, with {{the weight of the world}} that I held deep inside" [...] and [...] "Life was a winding road, and I learned many things little ones shouldn't know." [...] As described by David Browne for Entertainment Weekly, Carey [...] "paints herself" [...] in the lyrics as [...] "A wayward child, with the weight of the world". He also noted that the singer seems concerned that she had to grow up quicker than was perhaps necessary, in order to live her life in a controlled environment, [...] "Maybe <b>I</b> <b>grew</b> up a little too soon." [...] During the chorus, Carey lightens the mood of the song by singing about having courage to face times of adversity, [...] "But I closed my eyes, steadied my feet on the ground, raised my head to the sky. And though times rolled by, still I feel like a child as I look at the moon. Maybe <b>I</b> <b>grew</b> up a little too soon." [...] Jon Pareles for The New York Times wrote that Carey [...] "coos" [...] the lyrics [...] "Maybe <b>I</b> <b>grew</b> up a little too soon" [...] and [...] "That woman-child inside was on the verge of fading/ Thankfully I woke up in time." ...|$|E
