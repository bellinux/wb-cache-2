50|$|After {{undergoing}} trials on Düsseldorf's Rheinbahn system, the trams {{were delivered}} to Sheffield via the Rotterdam-Immingham cargo ship route. The trams are bidirectional. Each tram comprises three articulated carriages {{and has a}} low-floor area of 40%. All four entrances are at 42 cm low level which matches {{the height of the}} platforms, thereby providing level access. The low-floor areas have limited seating and provide space for pushchairs and wheel chairs. The high floor areas are 88 cm high and {{can be found at the}} outer-end of each <b>end</b> <b>carriage</b> and in the centre carriage; they are reached by either two or three steps.|$|E
50|$|The {{design was}} revolutionary and without precedent. Although unpowered, {{they had a}} driving cab {{at one end and}} were pushed and pulled by steam locomotives, such as the 141 TC Ouest and 141 TD Ouest. The cars possessed two vestibules, each with two sets of doors. At both ends of each {{carriage}} was a compartment with doors leading to the following carriage for interconnection. The upper deck had rows of five seats whilst the lower deck had four. The cabins allowed the driver to control the steam engine from the driving cab in the opposite <b>end</b> <b>carriage</b> while the locomotive was pushing (using controls actuated by compressed air pipes running through the train). They were thus true driving trailers for steam operation.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (MScEng (Civil Engineering)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2007. In {{structural}} engineering practice the actions imposed by {{overhead travelling cranes}} onto the supporting structure are defined as static forces amplified by dynamic coefficients and applied as pseudo-static forces without taking the interaction between crane and supporting structure into account. To investigate the validity of this approach, the forces generated at the wheels of an experimental crane are measured, as the crane traverses on the supporting structure. The interaction at {{the wheels of the}} crane is also visually recorded. These wheel load results will also be used by other researchers, to calibrate a numerical model of the experimental system. A full-scale 5 ton electric overhead travelling crane (EOTC) running on top of rails and a supporting structure, was designed and erected for research purposes. The crane has a span of 8. 3 m and wheel spacing of 4 m, which can be modified. The supporting structure consists of three simply supported mono-symmetric plate girders on each side, with a total length of 13. 8 m. This is supported by columns with a height of about 3. 5 m. This paper describes the calibration of this system for measurement purposes. A data acquisition system was implemented to capture forces, strains, deflections and accelerations at various points on the crane and the supporting structure as well as to measure the velocity of the crane. The forces at the crane wheels are measured through strain gauges on the <b>end</b> <b>carriage</b> load measuring system. The calibrated facility is used to investigate the behaviour of the crane and the supporting structure under regular and exceptional wheel loads, which are classified as follows: - Regular wheel loads occur during normal payload hoisting and lowering, longitudinal crane travel with payload and lateral crab travel with payload. - Exceptional wheel loads occur during eccentric payload hoisting (payload outside normal operational area), impact forces on end-stops, maximum hoisting of the payload, failure of a longitudinal drive mechanism of the crane, misalignment of the supporting structure and skewing of the crane. The maximum values of these experimentally determined wheel loads and the dynamic response of the system is used to help describe the behaviour of the electric overhead travelling crane and its supporting structure...|$|E

50|$|Since 2003, all Tangaras {{have been}} updated {{with a new}} CityRail {{corporate}} appearance. This involved the fitting of yellow panels on the front, yellow painted passenger doors and the <b>end</b> <b>carriages</b> receiving yellow paint surround {{for the benefit of}} visually impaired passengers. Blue and yellow stripes along the bottom of the carriages were replaced by a single yellow stripe and new fuzzy CityRail logos were placed on the driving cars.|$|R

500|$|Towards {{and during}} the second winter, the {{supplies}} carried by the railway were different.

50|$|The {{need for}} {{capacity}} increases has posed {{issues for the}} station. While most stations on the network have had their platforms extended as part of Transport for London's three-carriage capacity enhancement project, the island platform at Cutty Sark could not be lengthened due to cost (estimated at £30m) and risk of damage to the heritage site at street level. TfL proceeded with an alternate plan for the station that involved the use of selective door operation which allows three-car trains {{to stop at the}} station by only having the doors near the centre of the train open in both <b>end</b> <b>carriages.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Maryland {{was added}} to the planned Crossrail route in August 2006 after campaigning by Newham Council, the London Transport Users Committee and others. At 169 m, the {{platforms}} are too short for Crossrail's new trains which will be over 200 m in length, and extending the platforms is impossible due to geographical constraints. Crossrail has therefore committed to providing a full service, making use of selective door operation such that doors on some <b>end</b> <b>carriages</b> will not open at Maryland. An agreement was also reached about improving access to the station. Crossrail's precursor TfL Rail took control of the present [...] "metro" [...] service at the end of May 2015 and new [...] trains will be introduced in May 2017.|$|R

5000|$|On August 25, 2008, {{the station}} began airing {{programming}} from Retro Television Network (RTV) on its second digital subchannel. This lasted until July 31, 2010, when WEHT-DT2 became the third affiliate of the Wazoo Sports Network which launched in late 2009 on WHAS-TV in Louisville and WLEX in Lexington. WEHT-DT2 branded it locally as the [...] "News 25 Sports Channel" [...] {{and the service}} had digital cable carriage. The regional sports television network was dedicated to carrying live coverage of sporting events as well as classic coverage of past {{high school and college}} events. There were also locally produced shows, the first being After Further Review, a sports talk show which aired each weeknight at 9 p.m. Central (10 p.m. Eastern). Following Nexstars purchase of WEHT, the Sports Channel was taken off the air at approximately 12:30 a.m. CDT on December 1, 2011; at the time, Nexstar carried subchannels only when a netlet subchannel was required in a market. This eventually hastened Wazoos demise, as the networks other affiliates <b>ended</b> <b>carriage</b> of it by December 31 and the network declared bankruptcy days later.|$|R
