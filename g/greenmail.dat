50|$|Another {{accusation}} of <b>greenmailing</b> levied against {{him was the}} best-known and stemmed from his attempt to purchase Gillette in November 1986. Perelman opened negotiations with a bid of $4.12 billion. Gillette responded with an unsuccessful lawsuit and public insinuations of insider trading. Perelman accumulated 13.8% of Gillette before he made what he would later call the worst decision he ever made and sold his stake to Gillette later that month for a $34 million profit. Gillette had put word out that Ralston Purina had agreed to buy a 20% block of stock, making any attempt by Perelman to buy Gillette much more difficult. Perelman decided to sell his share to Ralston Purina, but before he did so Gillette's executives called him up, asking if he'd sell his shares to them and they'd sell the shares to Ralston Purina. He sold his shares to Gillette and Ralston {{backed out of the}} deal.|$|R

5000|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, Perelman {{was accused of}} {{engaging}} in <b>greenmail.</b> [...] "Greenmail" [...] occurs when someone buys a large block of a company's stock and threatens {{to take over the}} company unless he is paid a substantial premium over his purchase price.
