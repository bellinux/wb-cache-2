40|$|In {{patients}} with cervical cord injury without fracture-dislocation of the cervical spine, {{there is a}} group having tetraplegia at the initial stage and show a fairly good prognosis.

This is the so-called acute central cervical cord injury which Schneider reported in 1954. Within this group, I have noticed a subgroup (upper <b>extremities</b> type) that is slightly different from those with typical acute central cervical cord injury.

5|$|The most {{frequent}} complication of proximal DVT is post-thrombotic syndrome, {{which is caused}} by a reduction in the return of venous blood to the heart. Some symptoms of post-thrombotic syndrome are pain, edema, paresthesia, and in severe cases, leg ulcers. An estimated 20–50% of those with DVT will develop it, and 5–10% will develop the severe form. PE is the most serious complication of proximal DVT, and the risk of PE is higher when clots are present in the thigh and pelvis. Distal DVT itself is hardly if ever associated with post-thrombotic syndrome or PE. Untreated lower <b>extremity</b> DVT has a 3% PE-related mortality rate, while deaths associated with upper <b>extremity</b> DVT are extremely rare. The presence of a remaining thrombus after a DVT frequently occurs in a minority of people, and it increases the risk of recurrence, though to a lesser extent than an elevated D-dimer. In the 10 years following a DVT, approximately a third of individuals will have a recurrent episode.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The {{aim of this}} {{epidemiological}} {{study was to investigate}} the relationship of thermal discomfort with cold <b>extremities</b> (TDCE) to age, gender, and body mass index (BMI) in a Swiss urban population. Methods In a random population sample of Basel city, 2, 800 subjects aged 20 - 40 years were asked to complete a questionnaire evaluating the extent of cold <b>extremities.</b> Values of cold <b>extremities</b> were based on questionnaire-derived scores. The correlation of age, gender, and BMI to TDCE was analyzed using multiple regression analysis. Results A total of 1, 001 women (72. 3 % response rate) and 809 men (60 % response rate) returned a completed questionnaire. Statistical analyses revealed the following findings: Younger subjects suffered more intensely from cold <b>extremities</b> than the elderly, and women suffered more than men (particularly younger women). Slimmer subjects suffered significantly more often from cold <b>extremities</b> than subjects with higher BMIs. Conclusions Thermal discomfort with cold <b>extremities</b> (a relevant symptom of primary vascular dysregulation) occurs at highest intensity in younger, slimmer women and at lowest intensity in elderly, stouter men. </p...|$|R

5|$|Physical {{examination}} {{of a patient}} with ankle OCD often returns symptoms of joint effusion, crepitus, and diffuse or localized tenderness. Examination often reveals symptoms of generalized joint pain, swelling, and times with limited range of motion. Some with loose body lesions may report catching, locking, or both. The possibility of microtrauma emphasizes a need for evaluation of biomechanical forces at the knee in a physical examination. As a result, the alignment and rotation of all major joints in the affected <b>extremity</b> is common, as are extrinsic and intrinsic abnormalities concerning the affected joint, including laxity.|$|E
