Generally, one line bay {{includes}} 1 merging unit, 1 <b>intelligent</b> <b>terminal</b> <b>unit,</b> 2 line protection devices and 1 BCU. Five switch ports is enough for one bay, but a switch generally has 16 ports, which are enough for 3 bays. When a switch used for 3 bays is faulty, all the 3 bays will lose their protection, measuring and control functions. The solution is to limit the connected ports of a switch for only one bay. In this way, the failure of one switch will only affect one bay.|$|E

40|$|Empirical {{models of}} airflow output and power {{consumption}} were developed for series and parallel fan powered variable air volume <b>terminal</b> <b>units</b> at typical design pressure conditions. A testing procedure and experimental setup {{were developed to}} test sets of <b>terminal</b> <b>units</b> from three different manufacturers. Each set consisted of two series and two parallel units, each with 8 in. (203 mm) and 12 in. (304 mm) primary air inlets, {{for a total of}} four units in each set. Generalized models were developed for the series and parallel units, with coefficients varying by size and manufacturer. Statistical modeling utilized SAS software (2002). Fan power and airflow data were collected at downstream static pressures over a range from 0. 1 to 0. 5 in. w. g. (25 to 125 Pa) for the parallel <b>terminal</b> <b>units.</b> Downstream static pressure was held constant at 0. 25 in. w. g. (62 Pa) for the series units. Upstream static pressures of all variable air volume (VAV) <b>terminal</b> <b>units</b> ranged from 0. 1 to 2. 0 in. w. g. (25 to 498 Pa). Data were collected at four different primary air damper positions. Data were also collected at four different <b>terminal</b> <b>unit</b> fan speeds, controlled by a silicon controlled rectifier (SCR). The models utilized the RMS voltage entering the <b>terminal</b> <b>unit</b> fan, the 'rake' sensor velocity pressure, and the downstream static pressure. In addition to the <b>terminal</b> <b>unit</b> airflow and power models, a model was developed to quantify air leakage in parallel <b>terminal</b> <b>units,</b> when the unit fan was off. In all but two of the VAV <b>terminal</b> <b>units,</b> the resulting models of airflow and power had R 2 values greater than 0. 90.

Each <b>terminal</b> <b>unit</b> observed in this study used an 8 in (20. 3 cm) primary air inlet. Two fan motor control methods were considered. The primary control of interest was the electronically commutated motor (ECM) controller. Data collected were compared with previous research regarding silicon rectified control (SCR) units. Generalized models were developed for both series and parallel <b>terminal</b> <b>units.</b> Coefficients for performance models were then compared with comparable SCR controlled units. Non-linear statistical modeling was performed using SPSS software (2008). In addition to airflow and power consumption modeling, power quality was also quantified. Relationships between real power (watts) and apparent power (VA) were presented as well as harmonic frequencies and total harmonic distortion. Power quality was recorded for each ECM controlled <b>terminal</b> <b>unit</b> tested. Additional tests were also made to SCR controlled <b>terminal</b> <b>units</b> used in previous research (Furr 2006). The airflow and power consumption performance models had an R 2 equal to 0. 990 or greater for every <b>terminal</b> <b>unit</b> tested.
