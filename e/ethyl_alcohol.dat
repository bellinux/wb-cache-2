5|$|Beer {{contains}} <b>ethyl</b> <b>alcohol,</b> {{the same}} chemical that {{is present in}} wine and distilled spirits and as such, beer consumption has short-term psychological and physiological effects on the user. Different concentrations of alcohol {{in the human body}} have different effects on a person. The effects of alcohol depend on the amount an individual has drunk, the percentage of alcohol in the beer and the timespan over which the consumption took place, the amount of food eaten and whether an individual has taken other prescription, over-the-counter or street drugs, among other factors. Drinking enough to cause a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of 0.03%-0.12% typically causes an overall improvement in mood and possible euphoria, increased self-confidence and sociability, decreased anxiety, a flushed, red appearance in the face and impaired judgment and fine muscle coordination. A BAC of 0.09% to 0.25% causes lethargy, sedation, balance problems and blurred vision. A BAC from 0.18% to 0.30% causes profound confusion, impaired speech (e.g., slurred speech), staggering, dizziness and vomiting. A BAC from 0.25% to 0.40% causes stupor, unconsciousness, anterograde amnesia, vomiting (death may occur due to inhalation of vomit (pulmonary aspiration) while unconscious) and respiratory depression (potentially life-threatening). A BAC from 0.35% to 0.80% causes a coma (unconsciousness), life-threatening respiratory depression and possibly fatal alcohol poisoning. As with all alcoholic drinks, drinking while driving, operating an aircraft or heavy machinery increases the risk of an accident; many countries have severe criminal penalties against drunk driving.|$|E

40|$|A {{reduction}} in thickness of barrier laminated film systems generally {{leads to a}} quality decrease of the resulting packaging materials' functional properties. Especially for food packaging applications, adequate oxygen and water barrier properties are indispensable.

Biaxially oriented polyethylene terephthalate and biaxially oriented polypropylene aluminium-coated thin film laminates as well as corresponding <b>ethyl</b> vinyl <b>alcohol</b> film systems could be successfully produced with oxygen transmission rates of < 0. 5 cm³(STP) /(m² d bar) and water barrier values of < 0. 1 g/(m² d). It could be confirmed that the film thickness of these materials within the range of the investigated dimensions does not have an influence on the barrier properties. In fact, the parameters of the production process influence the functional properties of the film systems and must therefore be adapted. Machinability of these excellent thin film systems requires further investigation on packaging lines before they can be transferred to packaging application...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Among {{vegetable}} oils, {{virgin olive}} oil (VOO) has nutritional and sensory characteristics that to make it unique and a basic component of the Mediterranean diet. The importance of VOO is mainly attributed both to its high content of oleic acid a balanced contribution quantity of polyunsaturated fatty acids and its richness in phenolic compounds, which act as natural antioxidants and {{may contribute to the}} prevention of several human diseases. The polar phenolic compounds of VOO belong to different classes: phenolic acids, phenyl <b>ethyl</b> <b>alcohols,</b> hydroxy-isochromans, flavonoids, lignans and secoiridoids. This latter family of compounds is characteristic of Oleaceae plants and secoiridoids are the main compounds of the phenolic fraction. Many agronomical and technological factors can affect the presence of phenols in VOO. Its shelf life is higher than other vegetable oils, mainly due to the presence of phenolic molecules having a catechol group, such as hydroxytyrosol and its secoiridoid derivatives.

25|$|Pot {{distilled}} gin represents the earliest style of gin, and is traditionally produced by pot distilling a fermented grain mash (malt wine) from barley or other grains, then redistilling it with flavouring botanicals {{to extract the}} aromatic compounds. The fermentation of grain mash produces a neutral alcohol (similar to vodka) that is predominately tasteless except for the iconic <b>ethyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> taste. A double gin can be produced by redistilling the first gin again with more botanicals. Due {{to the use of}} pot stills, the alcohol content of the distillate is relatively low; around 68% ABV for a single {{distilled gin}} or 76% ABV for a double gin. This type of gin is often aged in tanks or wooden casks, and retains a heavier, malty flavour that gives it a marked resemblance to whisky. Korenwijn (grain wine) and the oude (old) style of Geneva gin or Holland gin represent the most prominent gins of this class.|$|E

25|$|Anecdotal {{claims for}} an {{antimicrobial}} effect {{are based on}} abstract scientific experiments which show some antimicrobial activity in commercial grapefruit seed extracts and ethanol grapefruit seed extract but not natural GSE. The preliminary studies for the antimicrobial effect state that the Citricidal commercial brand of GSE was used for testing. There is considerable scientific evidence that the anti-microbial activity associated with grapefruit seed extract {{can be attributed to}} the contamination or adulteration of commercial GSE preparations with synthetic antimicrobials or preservatives. According to a 2001 study, branded commercial GSE preparations were contaminated with synthetic benzethonium chloride that was unlikely to have been made from grapefruit seeds. Some of the marketers claimed that their product did not contain benzethonium chloride and the error was due to the similarity in molecular weight of the quaternary ammonium compound which was formed through a proprietary manufacturing process. It is highly improbable that the preservative benzethonium chloride is formed during any extraction and/or processing of grapefruit seeds and pulp. Researchers conclusively demonstrated the presence of benzethonium chloride in commercial GSE using various analytical methods including HPLC, one- and two-dimensional NMR, PIXE analysis, and electrospray ionization MS. Another in vitro study claimed GSE had antibacterial properties. As with the branded in vitro test this extract was contaminated.

40|$|The high {{oxidative}} {{stability of}} {{extra virgin olive}} oil is mainly due to its fatty acid composition, in particular to the high monounsaturated-to-polyunsaturated ratio, and to the presence of minor compounds having phenolic structure, that also have a major role in preventing oxidation. Several classes of phenolic compounds have been identified in {{extra virgin olive oil}} (phenolic acids, phenyl <b>ethyl</b> <b>alcohols,</b> flavonoids, lignans and secoiridoids) and among them the secoiridoids (aglyconic derivatives of oleuropein and ligstroside) are the most abundant constituents. Phenolic compounds belonging to o-diphenolic category, such as oleuropein aglycon (OA), decarboxymethyl-oleuropein aglycon (DOA), and hydroxytyrosol (HYTY), are mainly responsible for the oxidative resistance of extra virgin olive oil. In this work, results dealing with oxidative stability (OSI) of several samples (n= 32) obtained from olives with a different degree of Bactrocera oleae attack (0 - 85 %), are shown. Moreover an electrochemical evaluation of the antioxidant power (AOP) of the phenolic fraction has been carried out. This method enables the recognition of the phenols that may be easily oxidised. Data demonstrate an increase of products coming from hydrolytic and oxidative degradations of fatty acids {{as a function of the}} degree of olive fly attack.
