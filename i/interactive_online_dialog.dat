40|$|One of the {{challenges}} of teacher education is to train preservice teachers to deliver {{a wide range of}} literacy skills to a diverse population. This article describes a mixed methods research study into preservice undergraduate literacy methods courses. This research examined how online, asynchronously conducted discussions influenced and impacted preservice teachers ’ literacy understanding. Providing many opportunities for supportive and <b>interactive</b> <b>online</b> <b>dialog</b> enabled the preservice teachers to develop a richer base of literacy learning knowledge. Specifically, the study demonstrated how asynchronously conducted discussions supported preservice teachers in acquiring and refining the content and pedagogical knowledge needed to teach literacy. Teacher education programs face the challenge and responsibility of preparing highly qualified, fully certified teachers who are capable of teaching a wide range of literacy skills to an increasingly diverse student population. Although evidence suggests that well designed, traditional teacher preparation programs produce effective teachers, additional new standards and requirements, such as those in the No Child Left Behind Act, limit the amount of classroom time that can be devoted to literacy instruction. With this increase in program requirements for all education certification programs, a method has been needed to extend what is taught in preservice educational classrooms without significantly increasing the credit hour requirements for education certification programs...|$|E

40|$|We have {{analyzed}} {{data from}} two online courses, {{designed to promote}} collaborative online learning, and in the contexts of two different cultures. Ongoing assessment (self, group, instructor) that actively engages students within the course (as opposed to instructor assessment at the end) is a central feature for achieving collaborative knowledge building in <b>online</b> <b>dialog.</b> Careful articulation and deployment of assessment criteria is a design feature that promotes meta-awareness, which, in turn, together with student-centeredness and operationalization of student experiences {{in the design of}} the curriculum, enhances student participation, motivation and ownership in the dialog. From eight years of experience with <b>online</b> <b>dialog</b> and two quite different implementations we offer a set of design principles, having a sound theoretical basis, that enhance the quality and quantity of online knowledge building. Our analysis suggests that the characteristics of the discussion threads emerging under these design criteria give evidence of true collaborative learning.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the relationship between Extension employees' learning styles and their performance in three different types of learning environments: traditional face-to-face instruction, minimally <b>interactive</b> <b>online</b> instruction, and highly <b>interactive,</b> multimedia-rich <b>online</b> instruction. Keith Golay's Learning Pattern Assessment and a ten-question post-test were used to gather data for this study. A 4 x 3 factorial ANOVA was used to test the data at the. 10 level of significance. Results indicate that participants in the traditional face-to-face and the multimedia-rich, highly <b>interactive</b> <b>online</b> environment had statistically higher post-test scores than those participants in a minimally <b>interactive</b> <b>online</b> environment. Further, it was discovered that a participant's learning style had no statistically significant effect on their final post-test scores in any of the three instructional methods; and no significant interaction was found between the learning style and instructional method...|$|R
