5|$|Writer Ron Hauge said he <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>for</b> {{the episode}} {{one day when}} he was heading to work. He was {{listening}} to the radio and heard of an orphanage getting ripped off, and they were getting back more than they gave.

5|$|House {{was created}} by David Shore, who <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>for</b> the misanthropic title {{character}} from a doctor's visit. Initially, producer Bryan Singer wanted an American to play House, but British actor Hugh Laurie's audition convinced him that a foreign actor could play the role. Shore wrote House as a character with parallels to Sherlock Holmes—both are drug users, blunt, and close to being friendless. The show's producers wanted House handicapped in some way and gave the character a damaged leg arising from an improper diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|The Haunted Mask is the {{eleventh}} book in Goosebumps, {{the series of}} children's horror fiction novels created and authored by R. L. Stine. The book follows Carly Beth, a girl who buys a Halloween mask from a store. After putting on the mask, she starts acting differently and discovers that the mask has become her face; she is unable to pull the mask off. R. L. Stine says he <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>for</b> the book from his son who was wearing a mask he had trouble getting off.|$|E
5000|$|A Matter of Some Gravity is an Uncle Scrooge {{adventure}} comic {{written and}} drawn by Don Rosa in 1996 and includes Magica De Spell. Like some other comic stories by Rosa (Cash Flow and The Universal Solvent), {{the story is}} founded with toying with the laws of nature. Rosa claims that he thinks that he <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>for</b> those comics from a mechanical engineering course in an institute of higher education, which he took {{before he became a}} professional cartoonist.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{inaccurate}} points {{have occurred}} in the story regarding who introduced him to London UK programs, (p20) and where he <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>for</b> his programs. Youth at Risk Victoria's CEO Andy Ellis-Smith sponsored his first trip to visit the highly successful model. Upon returning to Melbourne he arranged to work with Mr Ellis-Smith's detractors culminating in the statement [...] " [...] Thats a great program in the UK but don't bring it near my back yard" [...] He returned the following year to try to affiliate with the UK charity. YAR UK celebrates 21 years of sustained program delivery. Mr Ellis-Smith lost a family, house, his job and credibility.|$|R

5|$|The film {{is based}} on an American sailor who comes to the Yamaki family after his ship wrecks in the ocean. The sailor (Borzage) falls in love with the {{daughter}} (Aoki) of the family, unaware {{of the fact that she}} is cursed by God, such that if she marries, a nearby volcano will erupt and destroy the entire island on which the family lives. Writer and producer Thomas H. Ince <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>for</b> the film from the volcanic eruption on the island of Sakura-Jima in 1914. Hayakawa was paid $500 a week, the highest paid of all oriental stars at the time.|$|E
5|$|The pre-credits {{sequence}} used {{a church}} in Stoke Poges as a cemetery, while the helicopter scenes were filmed at the abandoned Beckton Gas Works in London. The gas works were also the location for some of Stanley Kubrick's 1987 film, Full Metal Jacket. Director John Glen <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>for</b> the remote-controlled helicopter after seeing a child playing with an RC car. Since flying a helicopter through a warehouse {{was thought to be}} too dangerous, the scene was shot using forced perspective. A smaller mock-up was built by Derek Meddings' team closer to the camera that the stunt pilot Marc Wolff flew behind and this made it seem as if the helicopter was entering the warehouse. The footage inside the building was shot on location, though with a life-sized helicopter model which stood over a rail. Stuntman Martin Grace stood as Bond when the agent is dangling outside the flying helicopter, while Roger Moore himself was used in the scenes inside the model.|$|E

5000|$|Henry James <b>got</b> <b>the</b> central <b>idea</b> <b>for</b> <b>The</b> Ambassadors from {{an anecdote}} about {{his friend and}} fellow-novelist William Dean Howells, who, whilst visiting his son in Paris, was so {{impressed}} with the amenities of European culture that he wondered aloud if life hadn't passed him by.

25|$|He wrote three scripts of {{the horror}} and thriller genre before he <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>for</b> A Dog's Breakfast. He chose a more humorous subject because Stargate Atlantis {{generally}} involves peril despite its comedy elements. Hewlett considered the movie as a personal challenge {{and did not have}} wide-distribution plans initially.|$|E
25|$|Alexius Meinong (1853–1920) — Austrian {{psychologist}} and philosopher, who wrote Gegenstandstheorie ("The theory of objects"), where he wrote {{at length about}} the notion of objects that exist only in our minds. He is referred to by his surname in the story; his theories are alluded to by way of explaining the languages of the Northern Hemisphere of Tlön. Presumably, Borges is acknowledging where he <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>for</b> this imaginary family of languages.|$|E
25|$|Heinlein <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>for</b> {{the novel}} {{when he and}} his wife Virginia were {{brainstorming}} one evening in 1948. She suggested a new version of Rudyard Kipling's The Jungle Book (1894), but with a child raised by Martians instead of wolves. He decided to go further with the idea and worked on the story on and off for more than a decade. His editors at Putnam then required him to cut its 220,000-word length down to 160,067 words before publication. In 1962, it received the Hugo Award for Best Novel.|$|E

The project's planning was headed by Itaru Hinoue, who is also the art director and character designer for Rewrite. During the time when Key was developing their fifth game [...] in 2005, Hinoue had more free time since she was just helping Fumio with the character design, and that is when Hinoue <b>got</b> <b>the</b> initial <b>idea</b> <b>for</b> Rewrite.

25|$|Dark Fall was written, {{designed}} and programmed by Jonathan Boakes, {{who was working}} as a sushi chef at the time. He first <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>for</b> the game whilst exploring a real abandoned train station and adjoining hotel in Dorset in January 2000. The buildings were sealed shut with corrugated iron, but rusted peepholes allowed him to look inside and determine they had been quite opulent in their day, and had last been used in the late 1940s. Upon further investigation, he discovered one of the doors of the train station was so rotted, the weight of the iron had pulled it partly off its hinges, {{and he was able to}} get inside and explore the buffet room.|$|E
25|$|His costume was {{unveiled}} on July 27, 2005. He generally wears either a dark brown (with blue pinstripes) or a blue (with rust red pinstripes) four-buttoned suit, {{a shirt and}} a tie, a light brown faux-suede overcoat (which he claims was {{given to him by}} Janis Joplin), and different coloured pairs of Converse All-Star sneakers, depending on his suit. According to an interview on Parkinson, David Tennant and Russell T Davies <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>for</b> the Tenth Doctor's costume from an outfit Jamie Oliver had worn on Parkinson just after Tennant had taken the role. David Tennant has commented that he would vary the combination of the buttons he fastened on his jacket in different episodes. Tennant thought the look was very geek chic.|$|E
25|$|Reeves' {{agent was}} {{amenable}} to the project, but Phoenix's agent {{would not even}} show the screenplay to the young actor. Not to be deterred, Van Sant <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>for</b> Reeves to personally deliver the film's treatment to Phoenix {{at his home in}} Florida. Reeves did so over the Christmas holidays, riding his 1974 Norton Commando motorcycle from his family home in Canada to the Phoenix family ranch in Micanopy, Florida, outside Gainesville. Reeves was no stranger to River Phoenix or members of his family, having worked previously with River on Lawrence Kasdan's I Love You to Death and with his brother Joaquin and girlfriend Martha Plimpton on Ron Howard's Parenthood. After reading the treatment, Phoenix agreed {{to play the role of}} Scott. However, since Van Sant had already cast Reeves in the role, they had to convince River to take on the edgier role of drug-addicted hustler Mike Waters. The director promised not to make either actor do anything embarrassing.|$|E

As he comes upon heavy months, and is come now to the Abbot, the Monastery, and the less profitable or popular of the novels, this is a fortunate circumstance.

It was released in April 2001 as {{the third and final}} single from her gold-selling, second studio album, Come My Way (2000). The song is inspired by Anus hero Cathy Freeman. At a Mushroom Records press release, Anu said; “I met Cathy at the ARIA Music Awards {{a couple of years ago}} but it wasn’t until I saw her in Seville... that [...] "‘Coz I’m Free" [...] came together.

500|$|Deal <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>for</b> the album's {{name from}} a {{painting}} that she saw in Boston. Pods cover was designed by Vaughan Oliver with photography by Kevin Westenberg. Oliver attached a belt of dead eels over his underwear, and performed a fertility dance while Westenberg took pictures of him, using a long exposure. Oliver's inspiration included the need for [...] "a strong male response" [...] (via the [...] "phallic" [...] eels) {{to the music of}} the mostly female Breeders. Another motivation was his attempt to charm Kim Deal, and speak to her sense of humor, as he had become enamored with her.|$|E
50|$|Dennis Gansel <b>got</b> <b>the</b> basic <b>idea</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> film {{after the}} {{broadcast}} of Das Phantom, and Gansel mentioned {{that they have}} a similar theme. The film was shot in Berlin and Ukraine. A few scenes were shot in Moscow, and a fake script was presented to the authorities to get permits without problems due to the political nature of the actual script. The editor was Jochen Retter who edited several of director Dennis Gansel's previous short films as well as his debut film Das Phantom and Before the Fall. The film is the fifth collaboration between Gansel and actor Max Riemelt who has starred in every one of Gansel's feature films since Mädchen, Mädchen. Gansel stated that the film Three Days of the Condor was an influence for him while making the film.|$|R
5000|$|Faggin, {{the sole}} chip {{designer}} among the engineers on the MCS-4 project, {{was the only}} one with experience in metal-oxide semiconductor (MOS) random logic and circuit design. He also had the crucial knowledge of the new silicon gate process technology with self-aligned gates, which he had created at Fairchild in 1968. At Fairchild in 1968, Faggin also designed and manufactured the world's first commercial IC using SGT, the Fairchild 3708 [...] that was featured on the cover of Electronics (Sept. 29, 1969). As soon as he joined the Intel MOS Department he created a new random logic design methodology based on silicon gate, and contributed many technology and circuit design inventions that enabled their single chip microprocessor to become a reality. His methodology set the design style for all the early Intel microprocessors and later for the Zilog Z80. He also led the MCS-4 project and was responsible for its successful outcome (1970-1971). Marcian [...] "Ted" [...] Hoff, head of the Application Research Department, contributed the architectural proposal for Busicom working with Stanley Mazor in 1969, then he moved on to other projects. When asked where he <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> architecture of the first microprocessor, Hoff related that Plessey, [...] "a British tractor company", had donated a minicomputer to Stanford, and he had [...] "played with it some" [...] while he was there. Shima designed the Busicom calculator firmware and assisted Faggin during {{the first six months of}} the implementation. The manager of Intel's MOS Design Department was Leslie L. Vadász. At the time of the MCS-4 development, Vadasz's attention was completely focused on the mainstream business of semiconductor memories and he left the leadership and the management of the MCS-4 project to Faggin.|$|R

Sometimes employers also agree {{to develop their}} employees' ideas internally. This paper develops a multi-task incentives model to analyze optimal corporate strategies towards employee innovations. The model explains when employees become entrepreneurs (sometimes even involuntarily); when they become intrapreneurs, managing internal ventures; when they become managers of a corporate spin-off; {{and when they are}} denied all of these options. Important determinants for these choices are the allocation of intellectual property rights, and the availability of outside resources, such as venture capital. ...|$|R
500|$|Butlin's had a {{long history}} of {{combining}} amusements with transport, starting with their first miniature railway at the Empire Exhibition in 1938. Skegness was to receive its own miniature railway in 1962. A chairlift system was installed at the same time. In 1965, the camp became home to the UK's first commercial monorail system. According to Peter Scott, who has researched the history of Butlin's transport systems, Butlin apparently <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>for</b> the system from Disneyland. Construction began in 1964 with the cars being manufactured locally; the total cost of the system was £50,000 (2011:£).|$|E
500|$|Books and {{characters}} in the series were inspired by books and films. For example, the character Slappy the Dummy {{was inspired by the}} literary classic The Adventures of Pinocchio. Some of Stine's ideas for the books also came from real life; Stine <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>for</b> the book The Haunted Mask after his son, Matt, had a Halloween mask that he had trouble getting off. Stine also uses his childhood fears to help him write his books. The author said, [...] "Luckily, I have a great memory.

500|$|Drummer Mick Avory {{has offered}} an {{alternate}} {{explanation for the}} song's lyrics, claiming that [...] "Lola" [...] was partially inspired by Avory's frequenting of trans bars in west London. Avory said, [...] "We used to know this character called Michael McGrath. He used to hound the group a bit, because being called The Kinks did attract these sorts of people. He used {{to come down to}} Top of the Pops, and he was publicist for John Stephen's shop in Carnaby Street. He used to have this place in Earl's Court, and he used to invite me to all these drag queen acts and transsexual pubs. They were like secret clubs.

50|$|Trey Parker {{says on the}} DVD {{commentary}} that he <b>got</b> <b>the</b> main <b>idea</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> episode while hiking {{on vacation}} in Tasmania, Australia. This is significant because Parker felt it was refreshing to have an idea just come to him {{rather than having to}} actively {{try to come up with}} <b>ideas</b> with <b>the</b> rest of the writing staff. Parker said he instantly had everything worked out except for what it would be that Cartman did to anger the other boys. It wasn't until late in the production of the episode, when nearly all animation was finished, that the opening scene was finalized. Parker, Matt Stone, and the rest of the writing crew were eating KFC one day when somebody mentioned how annoying it would have been if somebody just ate all the skin off the chicken before they ate it. They decided to go ahead with this idea because it seemed to slot in so perfectly.|$|R

According to the play's introduction (reprinted on the author's site), the original script calls for two characters (the Interviewer and the Sphinx), while the expanded version calls for 2 additional characters (Sigmund Freud and Florence Nightingale) who serve {{as a kind of}} Greek chorus. In a video interview, Matthews says he <b>got</b> <b>the</b> original <b>idea</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> play after writing an article in the 1960s for the CEA Critic arguing that Oedipus did not actually solve the riddle of the Sphinx.
