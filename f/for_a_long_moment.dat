25|$|Early {{the next}} morning, Bullitt drives home. As {{he walks up}} to his apartment, he spots Cathy's car. He looks in and sees her {{sleeping}} in his bedroom, {{but he does not}} wake her. He takes off his gun and balances it on a banister. As he begins to wash up at the bathroom sink, he looks up into his own reflection and contemplates himself <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>moment.</b>|$|E
500|$|When {{the tenth}} inning ended, giving Hershiser the record, he [...] "stood bent {{with his hands}} on his knees <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>moment</b> after the final out and then was {{inundated}} by teammates pouring out of the dugout to congratulate him." [...] Drysdale served as the Dodger radio broadcast announcer with Vin Scully that year. As Hershiser left the mound with the record in hand, he was searching for Drysdale and saying [...] "Where is Drysdale? I've got to find Drysdale". Drysdale was on hand to congratulate Hershiser after the game. In fact, when Hershiser returned to the dugout, Drysdale was waiting with his microphone for an interview.|$|E
2500|$|Wray {{was also}} a member {{of one of the most}} famous B-movie units at work during what is now viewed as the 'Golden Age' of Hollywood -- a group whose {{creative}} energy and inventiveness made Lewton's success possible. She spoke about working with the group in a conversation with her daughter many years later, a recollection that shines a clear light on the group's chemistry and skill, and the special place it held in Wray's heart:She rarely spoke about her early career or the McCarthy era. [...] But when I asked once what it was like working with Lewton, she smiled -- thought about it <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>moment</b> -- and then told me about the night the group spent figuring out how to build to the first murder in The Leopard Man. [...] The scene she had written was pure psychological terror, trading on very basic fears -- of the dark, of being punished unjustly, locked out of your own home, abandoned by people you trust -- and at the same time it sets up the mystery that is the premise of the entire film. [...] They were under pressure to get this sequence right, and almost everyone was there that night. The session went well into the small hours of the morning, was filled with laughter, and included a hilarious riff as one of them experimented with a set of castanets, which turned out to be the key to building the tension and suspense. They worked their way through a dozen different shot sequences before they were satisfied and, listening to her, I had the very strong impression that they would have come up with that same elegant, powerful scene even if they had been working with an A-movie budget and had more time. [...] As Agee so famously observed about Lewton, these were people who understood film and cared about human beings. [...] I can still see the smile on her face as she recalled that night. [...] -- Stefani Warren, September 2016 ...|$|E
60|$|He {{glanced at}} her swiftly. Their eyes met. Fearlessly she held his fingers <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment,--a <b>long,</b> {{wonderful}} <b>moment.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh keep me, keep me!" [...] {{he pleaded}} while her face still hung over him: in {{response}} to which it dropped again and stayed close, clingingly close. It was the seal of their situation--of which he tasted the impress <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> blissful <b>moment</b> in silence. But he came back. [...] "Yet how did you know--?" ...|$|R
50|$|He {{walks towards}} the bathroom, past the {{flickering}} fluorescent tube, and stops. In a close up, Ashcroft stares slightly downward {{into a corner}} of the room <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long,</b> silent <b>moment.</b> The silence is broken by the sound of Ashcroft urinating into an off-camera toilet. Immediately, ironically, as if to dismiss the prior foreboding, the song resumes of its own accord, loudly and triumphantly as Ashcroft continues to pass water.|$|R
60|$|The Cardinal {{continued}} to ponder him <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>moment</b> very searchingly.|$|E
60|$|<b>For</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>moment</b> none spoke. Then Kulan Tith {{cleared his}} throat.|$|E
60|$|The girl {{stood looking}} at him <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>moment</b> before she spoke.|$|E
6000|$|He made a queer, whining sound, {{covering}} his face. And the beggar's tag: [...] "'Ave a feelin' 'eart, gentleman--'ave a feelin' 'eart!" [...] passed idiotically through Gyp's mind. Would he {{get up and}} strangle her? Should she dash to the door--escape? <b>For</b> <b>a</b> <b>long,</b> miserable <b>moment,</b> she watched him swaying on the window-seat, with his face covered. Then, without looking at her, he crammed a clenched hand up against his mouth, and rushed out.|$|R
50|$|In August 1915 he {{commissioned}} the submarine HMS E19, {{the following month}} he forced a passage into the Baltic Sea to support the Russian Baltic Fleet, preying on iron ore transports from Sweden to the German Empire, where <b>for</b> <b>a</b> week <b>long</b> <b>moment</b> he had succeeded in entirely suspending German maritime traffic in the area. During his service in the Baltic, he torpedoed a German destroyer and on 7 November 1915 sank the German cruiser SMS Undine, as well as sinking or capturing 10 German steamships.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the episode}} [...] "Night Out," [...] {{he puts his}} hand on Pam's leg and caresses it <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long,</b> awkward <b>moment,</b> which {{everyone}} standing around seems to notice, making this the first time the employees see Toby's possible crush on Pam. Immediately thereafter, realizing what he had just done, he abruptly announces that he is moving to Costa Rica, runs outside to the security fence, scales it, and disappears into the night. This scene was done by a stunt double, as Lieberstein wanted to do it himself but it was decided for insurance reasons to let the stuntman do his work.|$|R
60|$|He {{stared at}} me <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>moment,</b> {{speechless}} in his utter amazement. Then he swallowed hard.|$|E
60|$|<b>For</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>moment</b> each {{looked into}} the other's eyes with a {{singular}} intentness that nothing here would seem to warrant.|$|E
60|$|<b>For</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>moment,</b> in {{speechless}} horror, {{both women}} stared at him, until, perceiving them, blankest surprise invaded his stern face.|$|E
60|$|Once {{more she}} leaned towards me. The {{wind was blowing}} around us, she came closer as though seeking for the shelter of my body. I could smell the crushed violets, which she was still wearing at her bosom; her eyes were soft and bright, her lips were {{slightly}} parted. I took her into my arms--she clung to me <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment--one <b>long,</b> delicious <b>moment.</b>|$|R
60|$|Suddenly {{the glorious}} {{creature}} righted herself, and rose again, {{as if in}} noble shame, for one last struggle with her doom. Her bows were deep in the water, but her after-deck still dry. Righted: but only <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> <b>long</b> enough to let her crew come pouring wildly up on deck, with cries and prayers, and rush aft to the poop, where, under the flag of Spain, stood the tall captain, his left hand on the standard-staff, his sword pointed in his right.|$|R
5000|$|During the [...] "Last Days" [...] {{part of the}} Secret Wars storyline, Spectrum devises a plan {{to destroy}} Earth-1610 {{to keep it from}} colliding with Earth-616. In desperation during the two weeks {{before the end of the}} world, Spectrum {{channels}} her full power and goes to destroy Earth-1610. However, right before she successfully destroys the other Earth, she spots a group of children who live there, causing her to hesitate <b>for</b> only <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> <b>long</b> enough <b>for</b> Ultimate Reed Richards to capture her.|$|R
60|$|They {{looked into}} each other's eyes <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>moment.</b> And then, hand in hand, they walked {{slowly into the}} palace.|$|E
60|$|She stopped again, {{clenching}} and unclenching her fingers, as if {{she were}} strangling some living thing. There was silence <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>moment.</b>|$|E
60|$|The park seemed full of shrill, {{piercing}} strife. It swelled, {{reached a}} highest pitch, sustained that <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>moment,</b> and then declined.|$|E
60|$|Then it {{was that}} White Fang struck. He gave no warning, with no snarl {{anticipated}} his own action. Into the air he lifted his body in the spring that landed him on the strange god's back. White Fang clung with his fore-paws to the man's shoulders, {{at the same time}} burying his fangs {{into the back of the}} man's neck. He clung on <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> <b>long</b> enough to drag the god over backward. Together they crashed to the floor. White Fang leaped clear, and, as the man struggled to rise, was in again with the slashing fangs.|$|R
60|$|<b>For</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> and {{wonderful}} <b>moment</b> {{she lay in}} his arms. She felt the soft burning of his kisses, {{the call of the}} room with its intoxicating, yet strangely ascetic perfume, the room to which all the time he seemed to be gently leading her. And then a flood of strange, alien recollections and realisations seemed to bring her from a better place back to a worse,--the sound of a passing taxicab, the distant booming of Big Ben, sounds of the world outside, the actual day-by-day world, with its day-by-day code of morals, the world in which she lived, and her friends, and all that had made life for her. She drew away, and he watched the change in her.|$|R
6000|$|Christie {{felt this}} to her heart's core, and <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>longed</b> to end the struggle, say, [...] "Take me," [...] and accept the shadow for the substance. But those last words of his vividly {{recalled}} the compact made with David that happy birthday night. How could she be his friend if she was Mr. Fletcher's wife? She knew {{she could not be}} true to both, while her heart reversed the sentiment she then would owe them: David's friendship was dearer than Philip's love, and she would keep it at all costs. These thoughts flashed through her mind in the drawing of a breath, and she looked up, saying steadily in spite of wet eyes and still burning cheeks: ...|$|R
60|$|Lionel {{looked at}} him <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>moment</b> in silence, sitting up a little. Then he sank back again slowly against Sir John's breast.|$|E
60|$|But he did {{not speak}} a word. He {{remained}} motionless <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>moment,</b> his eyes pale and steady, his right hand like a claw.|$|E
60|$|Sully {{stared at}} his master <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>moment,</b> in stupefied silence, his loyal Huguenot soul refusing to {{discount}} by flattery the truth that he perceived.|$|E
6000|$|All he {{understood}} was {{that everything was}} not over yet. There {{was no time to}} lose; Mrs Fyne and the girls had come in at the gate. He whispered [...] "Wait" [...] with such authority (he was the son of Carleon Anthony, the domestic autocrat) that it did arrest her <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> <b>long</b> enough to hear him say that he could not be left like this to puzzle over her nonsense all night. She was to slip down again into the garden later on, as soon as she could do so without being heard. He would be there waiting for her till--till daylight. She didn't think he could go to sleep, did she? And she had better come, or--he broke off on an unfinished threat.|$|R
60|$|He walked on, {{speaking}} to the mothers and patting the children, while Mr. Irwine satisfied himself with standing still and nodding at a distance, that no one's attention might be disturbed from the young squire, {{the hero of the}} day. Arthur did not venture to stop near Hetty, but merely bowed to her as he passed along the opposite side. The foolish child felt her heart swelling with discontent; for what woman was ever satisfied with apparent neglect, even when she knows it to be the mask of love? Hetty thought {{this was going to be}} the most miserable day she had had <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> while, <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> of chill daylight and reality came across her dream: Arthur, who had seemed so near to her only a few hours before, was separated from her, as the hero of a great procession is separated from a small outsider in the crowd.|$|R
60|$|A yell {{coming from}} the {{innermost}} depths of his chest died out unheard and transformed {{into a sort of}} greasy, sickly taste on his lips. At the same time the mental personality of Comrade Ossipon executed a frantic leap backward. But his body, left thus without intellectual guidance, held on to the door handle with the unthinking force of an instinct. The robust anarchist did not even totter. And he stared, his face close to the glass, his eyes protruding out of his head. He would have given anything to get away, but his returning reason informed him that it would not do to let go the door handle. What was it—madness, a nightmare, or a trap into which he had been decoyed with fiendish artfulness? Why—what for? He did not know. Without any sense of guilt in his breast, in the full peace of his conscience as far as these people were concerned, the idea that he would be murdered for mysterious reasons by the couple Verloc passed not so much across his mind as across the pit of his stomach, and went out, leaving behind a trail of sickly faintness—an indisposition. Comrade Ossipon did not feel very well in a very special way <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment—a <b>long</b> <b>moment.</b> And he stared. Mr Verloc lay very still meanwhile, simulating sleep for reasons of his own, while that savage woman of his was guarding the door—invisible and silent in the dark and deserted street. Was all this a some sort of terrifying arrangement invented by the police for his especial benefit? His modesty shrank from that explanation.|$|R
6000|$|... "Lend me that glass," [...] demanded Guy, forcefully. He {{surveyed}} {{the band of}} men <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>moment,</b> then he handed the glass back to Jean.|$|E
60|$|Thus face to face, each {{looking into}} the eyes of the other, they stood <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>moment,</b> the jostling crowd {{streaming}} past them, unheeded. Then Andre-Louis laughed.|$|E
60|$|Rosamund {{sank down}} upon the divan, and sat there with bowed head, her hands folded in her lap. Sakr-el-Bahr stood by in silence <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>moment</b> contemplating her.|$|E
60|$|The two enemies stood {{glaring at}} one another <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> silent <b>moment.</b> Each had a rifle in his hand, each had hate in his heart and murder {{uppermost}} in his mind. The chance had come to give full play to the passions of a lifetime. But {{a man who has}} been brought up under the code of a restraining civilisation cannot easily nerve himself to shoot down his neighbour in cold blood and without word spoken, except <b>for</b> <b>an</b> offence against his hearth and honour. And before the moment of hesitation had given way to action a deed of Nature’s own violence overwhelmed them both. A fierce shriek of the storm had been answered by a splitting crash over their heads, and ere they could leap aside a mass of falling beech tree had thundered down on them. Ulrich von Gradwitz found himself stretched on the ground, one arm numb beneath him and the other held almost as helplessly in a tight tangle of forked branches, while both legs were pinned beneath the fallen mass. His heavy shooting-boots had saved his feet from being crushed to pieces, but if his fractures were not as serious as they might have been, at least it was evident that he could not move from his present position till some one came to release him. The descending twig had slashed the skin of his face, and he had to wink away some drops of blood from his eyelashes before he could take in a general view of the disaster. At his side, so near that under ordinary circumstances he could almost have touched him, lay Georg Znaeym, alive and struggling, but obviously as helplessly pinioned down as himself. All round them lay a thick-strewn wreckage of splintered branches and broken twigs.|$|R
60|$|It {{had brought}} him to knowledge, to knowledge--yes, this was the beauty of his state; which came to {{resemble}} more and more that {{of a man who}} has gone to sleep on some news of a great inheritance, and then, after dreaming it away, after profaning it with matters strange to it, has waked up again to serenity of certitude and has only to lie and watch it grow. This was the drift of his patience--that he had only to let it shine on him. He must moreover, with intermissions, still have been lifted and borne; since why and how else should he have known himself, later on, with the afternoon glow intenser, no longer at the foot of his stairs--situated as these now seemed at that dark other end of his tunnel--but on a deep window-bench of his high saloon, over which had been spread, couch-fashion, a mantle of soft stuff lined with grey fur that was familiar to his eyes and that one of his hands kept fondly feeling as for its pledge of truth. Mrs. Muldoon's face had gone, but the other, the second he had recognised, hung over him in a way that showed how he was still propped and pillowed. He took it all in, and the more he took it the more it seemed to suffice: he was as much at peace as if he had had food and drink. It was the two women who had found him, on Mrs. Muldoon's having plied, at her usual hour, her latch-key--and on her having above all arrived while Miss Staverton still lingered near the house. She had been turning away, all anxiety, from worrying the vain bell-handle--her calculation having been of the hour of the good woman's visit; but the latter, blessedly, had come up while she was still there, and they had entered together. He had then lain, beyond the vestibule, very much as he was lying now--quite, that is, as he appeared to have fallen, but all so wondrously without bruise or gash; only in a depth of stupor. What he most took in, however, at present, with the steadier clearance, was that Alice Staverton had <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> unspeakable <b>moment</b> not doubted he was dead.|$|R
5000|$|In {{his later}} years, Bob would face a {{professional}} crisis when {{three of his}} patients died under his care. Suffering from memory lapses during this time, Bob's handling of the cases was being looked into and he agreed to step down as head of Memorial. Though he initially balked at Chris's request that he seek out a specialist, he finally relented and made an appointment with the new geriatric specialist, Dr. Ric Decker. Though Chris feared that Bob may be suffering from Alzeheimer's, he actually had been suffering {{from a series of}} mini strokes that were treatable with medication. However, when more people started dying, it became apparent that there was a serial killer at Memorial. After bringing in a specialist, Walker Daniels, Bob was concerned when Daniels began suspecting Dr. Decker. Bob, however, stood by his doctor especially since there was no real evidence against him. However, Bob did find a key piece of evidence, the journal of a murdered nurse. Having realized who the killer was, Bob confronted him only to be injected with potassium chloride and lingering in a coma. Weeks later, he awoke to see Dr. Decker standing over him and called him a murderer before slipping back into <b>a</b> coma. Not <b>long</b> after, Bob awoke again <b>for</b> <b>a</b> brief <b>moment,</b> <b>long</b> enough to tell Chris, [...] "Ric." [...] Soon after, Bob made a full recovery and named Ric as his attacker.|$|R
