5|$|Since its {{original}} release, Cannibal <b>Holocaust</b> {{has been the}} target of censorship by moral and animal activists. Other than graphic gore, the film contains several scenes of sexual violence and genuine cruelty to animals, issues which find Cannibal <b>Holocaust</b> in the midst of controversy to this day. Due to this notoriety, Cannibal <b>Holocaust</b> has been marketed as having been banned in over 50 countries. In 2006, Entertainment Weekly magazine named Cannibal <b>Holocaust</b> as the 20th most controversial film of all time.|$|E
5|$|Tyndall also {{engaged in}} <b>Holocaust</b> denial, {{declaring that the}} <b>Holocaust</b> was a hoax created by Jews to gain sympathy for {{themselves}} and thus aid their plot for world domination. In The Eleventh Hour, Tyndall spoke approvingly of <b>Holocaust</b> denier David Irving. In promoting <b>Holocaust</b> denial, Tyndall and those close to him may have been seeking to rehabilitate Hitler and the Nazi government in the British public's view.|$|E

5|$|Unofficial sequels to Cannibal <b>Holocaust</b> were {{produced}} {{in the years following}} its release. The titles of these films were changed following their original theatrical releases in order to associate the film with Cannibal <b>Holocaust</b> in different markets. In 1985, Mario Gariazzo directed Schiave bianche: violenza in Amazzonia, which was also released as Cannibal <b>Holocaust</b> 2: The Catherine Miles Story. In addition to the new title, Slater notes similarities between the score in The Catherine Miles Story and Riz Ortolani's score in Cannibal <b>Holocaust.</b> Previously known for his work in Mondo films, Antonio Climati directed Natura contro in 1988, which was released as Cannibal <b>Holocaust</b> II in the United Kingdom.|$|E

5000|$|These {{are the two}} ideal {{types of}} Greek {{sacrificial}} ritual; they are appropriate to different divinities, done for different purposes, and conducted by different methods. <b>Holocausts</b> are apotropaic rituals, intended to appease {{the spirits of the}} Underworld, including the Greek heroes, who are spirits of the dead; they are also given to malign powers, such as the Keres and Hecate. One of the earliest attested <b>holocausts</b> was Xenophon's offering of pigs to Zeus Meilichius.|$|R

5|$|Since {{the passing}} of the <b>Holocaust</b> denial law in 1995, it is illegal to deny or attempt to justify the <b>Holocaust.</b> The act follows the Belgian Anti-Racism Law, passed in 1981, which led to the {{establishment}} of the Centre for Equal Opportunities and Opposition to Racism, which researches racism and anti-Semitism in Belgium as well as aiding victims of discrimination. Breendonk and Dossin Barracks (at the site of the former Mechelen transit camp) are preserved as museums to the <b>Holocaust</b> and to German repression in Belgium during the occupation.|$|E
