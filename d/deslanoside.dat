40|$|AIM: To {{characterize}} the dual effects of <b>deslanoside</b> on the contractility of jejunal smooth muscle. METHODS: Eight pairs of different {{low and high}} contractile states of isolated jejunal smooth muscle fragment (JSMF) were established. Contractile amplitude of JSMF in different low and high contractile states was selected {{to determine the effects}} of <b>deslanoside,</b> and Western blotting analysis was performed to measure the effects of <b>deslanoside</b> on myosin phosphorylation of jejunal smooth muscle. RESULTS: Stimulatory effects on the contractility of JSMF were induced (45. 3 % 1; 4. 0 % vs 87. 0 % 1; 7. 8 %, P < 0. 01) by <b>deslanoside</b> in 8 low contractile states, and inhibitory effects were induced (180. 6 % 1; 17. 8 % vs 109. 9 % 1; 10. 8 %, P < 0. 01) on the contractility of JSMF in 8 high contractile states. The effect of <b>deslanoside</b> on the phosphorylation of myosin light chain of JSMF in low (78. 1 % 1; 4. 1 % vs 96. 0 % 1; 8. 1 %, P < 0. 01) and high contractile state (139. 2 % 1; 8. 5 % vs 105. 5 1; 7. 34, P < 0. 01) was also bidirectional. Bidirectional regulation (BR) was abolished in the presence of tetrodotoxin. <b>Deslanoside</b> did not affect jejunal contractility pretreated with the Ca 2 + channel blocker verapamil or in a Ca 2 +-free assay condition. The stimulatory effect of <b>deslanoside</b> on JSMF in a low contractile state (low Ca 2 + induced) was abolished by atropine. The inhibitory effect of <b>deslanoside</b> on jejunal contractility in a high contractile state (high Ca 2 + induced) was blocked by phentolamine, propranolol and L-NG-nitro-arginine, respectively. CONCLUSION: Deslanoside-induced BR is Ca 2 + dependent and is related to cholinergic and adrenergic systems when JSMF is in low or high contractile states...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjective. The aim of {{this study}} was to test the {{hypothesis}} that digitalis glycosides would reduce sympathetic activity as reflected by forearm venous norepinephrine kinetics in patients with congestive heart failure. Background. Digitalis glycosides have been reported to decrease sympathetic nervous system activity with baroreceptor sensitization in experimental animals. Such effects could be of therapeutic importance in congestive heart failure. Methods. Double-blind randomized assessment was made of the effects of low dose intravenous <b>deslanoside</b> (Cedilanid-D, 0. 002 mg/kg body weight) and vehicle on heart rate, arterial pressure, forearm blood flow, plasma norepinephrine, norepinephrine clearance and norepineporine spillover in nine patients with stable congestive heart failure, New York Heart Association functional class II or III. Open label assessment of the responses to 0. 6 mg of <b>deslanoside</b> was made in an overlapping group of seven patients. All measurements were made 30 and 60 min after intravenous injection of drug or vehicle and after 15 min of 30 ° head-down tilt as a test of the sympathetic response to baroreceptor loading. Results. Heart rate, arterial pressure and forearm blood flow were unchanged by low dose <b>deslanoside.</b> Heart rate decreased slightly with the 0. 6 mg dose with the patients in the supine position. Norepinephrine spillover and clearance decreased with time on each study day in the supine position, but no effect was attributable to digitalis. Plasma norepinephrine and norepinephrine clearance and spillover all remained unchanged during head-down tilt on each study day. Conclusions. Nonpressor doses of <b>deslanoside</b> do not suppress sympathetic activity as reflected by venous norepinephrine and norepinephrine spillover in patients with congestive heart failure. Further, <b>deslanoside</b> did not normalize the sympathetic response to mild baroreceptor loading produced by head-down tilt. These data do not support sympathoinhibition through baroreceptor sensitization as a likely effect of digitalis in congestive heart failure...|$|E
40|$|Previous rei) orts Presented {{evidence}} for the pos-sible central origin of cardiac arrhythinias and i) !ood pressure increases induced in dogs under succmnylcholmne chloride by pentylenetetrazol, picrotoxin, and <b>deslanoside,</b> Determination of the dose-route-effect relationship of intravenous, subarachnoid (cortical), lateral, third and fourth ventricle administration of) enty!enetetrazol, picrotoxin and <b>deslanoside,</b> showed that the fourth ventrio’le was the most sensitive target area for the induction of cardiac arrhythmias (l 3 ircher ci al., 1962 a). Comparison of the intravenous and fourth ventricle rotmtes in this respect exhibited the fact that equieffective doses by these routes were in the ratios of 10 to 1, 1000 to 1, and about 60 to 1 for pentylenetetrazol, pio’rotoxmn and <b>deslanoside,</b> respectively. When these drugs ‘ere injected into the cerebral ventricles, the arrhyth-mias oo’curred with or without EEG convulsive discharges, but invariably with increases of the systemic arterial blood pressure, which started {{just prior to the}} EEG convulsive seizures and the caroliac arrhythmias, The doses required for the hypertensive responses were also) substantially smaller via various cerebral routes than via the intravenous route, Further {{evidence for}} the o’en-tral origin of the carohao ’ arrhythmias was de-rived from the observation that centrally ao’ting anticonvulsants, such as pentobarh) ital, tn-methaolione and 3 -methyl-S, 5 -phenvlethvlhvdan-tom, protected against these cardiovascular changes (l 3 ircher ci at., 1962 b).

40|$|The {{mechanism}} of digitalis-induced emesis {{has been extensively}} investigated (see Borison and Wang, 1953). Hatcher and Weiss (1922) and Dresbach and Waddell (1926) failed to elicit emesis in cats by topical application of cardiac glycosides {{to the floor of}} the fourth ventricle. On the other hand, it was shown by Dresbach (1947) that digitalis was capable of evoking emesis even after extensive chronic denervation of the abdominal viscera and heart. Borison and Wang (1951) abolished emesis to intravenously administered digitalis in dogs by ablation of the medullary emetic chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ). Borison (1952) extended this observa-tion to cats and demonstrated further that oral digitalis was just as effective in causing emesis after gut denervation as before, but that CTZ ablation reduced the incidence of vomiting. Thus, in spite of convincing evidence for a direct ac-tion of digitalis on the CTZ, two features of the emetic process required explanation, namely: 1) the reported failure of topical application to produce vomiting, and 2) the consistent de-lay in emetic response after intravenous ad-ministration. Recent experiments of Share et al. (1964) indicate that, in contrast to the in-effectiveness of local application, intracerebro-ventricular injection of <b>deslanoside</b> in dogs is an effective means of eliciting emesis. It is evident from the experiments presented herein, however, that cats respond differently from dogs. Indeed, Melville and Shister (1957) at no time observed vomiting in cats following lethal doses of lanatoside C, digoxin, and digitoxin in-jeeted into the lateral ventricle of the brain.

40|$|Ebola {{virus is}} a virulent {{pathogen}} that causes a highly lethal hemorrhagic fever in human and nonhuman species. It has a lethality rate of around 50 - 90 %. Ebola Virus {{is a single}} stranded & negative RNA virus. It is a pathogen that belongs to Filoviridae family of RNA virus. Ebola is considered as a level- 4 agent as it requires high range of biohazard containments for analysis and studies. The rapid growth of this virus infection has made the scenario so complicated to control this disease. Ebola virus is unreceptive to many anti-viral drugs or antibiotics also not a valid treatment is yet discovered for this disease caused by this virus. So there is an urgent need to explore the drug targets and discover novel anti-viral agent {{to fight against the}} virus. Proteins that used to help in pathogenesis of organism are selected as drug targets. Subsequent researches identified a cell surface receptor called TIM- 1 for Ebola and Marburg viruses that typically enhances filovirus infection in many cells. Various function of TIM- 1 in pathogenesis made it a potential drug target to control infection. Using bioinformatics based approach potential drug molecules are discovered against the target protein. The objective of the current study to explore a novel anit-viral agent that does act against TIM- 1 receptor of Ebola virus using bioinformatics tools. Briefly, 25 inhibitors against TIM- 1 protein were selected from literature. Both ligand and protein were optimized using Autodock Vina software. TIM- 1 was docked with those selected compounds and stability was estimated on the basis of total binding energy. <b>Deslanoside,</b> Vinorelbine, Digoxin were found to be most suitable agent that inhibit TIM- 1. Further, drug likeness and ADMET properties were evaluated by using molinspiration & Pre-ADMET. These compounda can be taken for wet lab testing as anti-Ebola therapy. Insilico docking analysis is done repeatedly to find the most suitable compound...|$|E
40|$|The {{pharmacokinetics}} {{of different}} cardiac glycosides are altered by renal dysfunction in different ways, {{depending on their}} basic pharmacokinetic properties. Digoxin: The linearity of digoxin pharmacokinetics is unchanged by renal dysfunction, as is the bioavailability. Protein binding may be slightly reduced, but the change is of no clinical significance. The apparent volume of distribution is reduced by one-third to one-half, the change being roughly proportional {{to the degree of}} renal impairment. The significance of this change in terms of adjustment of the loading dose is controversial. The renal clearance of digoxin is reduced in renal dysfunction and becomes very closely related to the measured creatinine clearance at values of creatinine clearance below 30 ml/min. Digitoxin: There are technical problems with the measurement of digitoxin because of the need to separate digitoxin and its metabolites chromatographically before using the measurement techniques commonly applied. Such separation has not always been carried out, and this makes the interpretation of the available data more difficult. The bioavailability of digitoxin is unaffected by renal dysfunction. Protein binding is probably significantly reduced but the clinical significance of this effect is unclear since the apparent volume of distribution and total body clearance of digitoxin appear to be unchanged. In the nephrotic syndrome, which must be considered separately from the other forms of renal dysfunction, there is impaired protein binding but also probably loss of protein bound drug via the renal glomerulus. This leads to a proportionately large increase in total body and renal clearances, a shortening of the half-life and a fall in the steady-state plasma digitoxin concentrations. In other forms of renal dysfunction there is probably no change in half-life or in steady-state plasma digitoxin concentrations. There does seem to be a decrease in digitoxin renal clearance but this may be compensated for by increases in non-renal clearance, both by non-renal excretion of unchanged digitoxin and by metabolic clearance, with increased formation of the active hydroxylated and hydrolysed metabolites, as well of the relatively inactive reduced metabolites. Overall, the changes seem to contribute little of clinical importance. Little digitoxin is removed from the body by dialysis procedures. Lanatoside C, <b>deslanoside,</b> and the acylated digoxins: Since these glycosides are largely metabolised to digotxin, one would expect changes in their pharmacokinetics similar to those of digoxin. However, there is only enough information to conclude that this is probably so in the case of β-methyldigoxin. The protein binding of β-methyldigoxin is reduced, as is its apparent volume of distribution, and total body clearance. The reduction in total body clearance is mostly attributable to a reduction in renal clearance, which falls in parallel with creatinine clearance, although always remaining lower than creatinine clearance. Non-renal clearance falls little or not at all. As a result of these changes the ovarall half-life of β-methyldigoxin is prolonged and the fractional daily loss at steady-state is decreased. Dosages of β-methyldigoxin therefore need to be reduced in renal dysfunction. Little-β-methyldigoxin is removed by haemodialysis. For α-acetyldigoxin, renal clearance is reduced in proportion to renal function, and the half-life is prolonged. Little is removed by haemodialysis. Other glycosides: Little information is available about other cardiac glycosides. What little information there is, however, suggests that, as one would expect, the half-life is prolonged and renal clearance reduced for those glycosides which are mostly eliminated via the urine, while little or no change occurs for those glycosides which are mostly metabolised. Thus, for ouabain (g-strophanthin), and k-strophanthin, the half-life is prolonged and renal excretion decreased, while for proscillaridin, methylproscillaridin, and peruvoside there is no change. None of these glycosides is much affected by haemodialysis. Despite the changes in pharmacokinetics of digoxin compared with digitoxin, there is little to choose between the two drugs for use in patients with renal dysfunction. Arguments in favour of one or other can be marshalled but there is no good evidence that one is preferable to the other...|$|E
