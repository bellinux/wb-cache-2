50|$|Utilizing a 35S methionine-labeled {{precursor}} protein, Sommer et al. elucidated a proteolytic processing pathway {{common to}} a variety of plants including pea (Pisum sativum), tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum), and maize (Zea mays). The 67 kD precursor was imported into the stroma in an ATP-dependent manner where a stromal peptidase processes the precursor into a 62 kD intermediate. The translocation of this intermediate into the thylakoid lumen was light-dependent and results in the generation of the mature 59 kD <b>enzyme.</b> <b>Based</b> on analysis of the precursor and mature catechol oxidase purified from Ipomoea batatas, proteolytic processing removes both the N-terminal transit peptide as well as a C-terminal domain that covers the enzyme active site.|$|E

50|$|The formylation {{reaction}} is proposed to occur through a direct transfer reaction {{in which the}} amine group of GAR nucleophillically attacks N10-formyl-THF creating a tetrahedral intermediate. As the α-amino group of GAR is relatively reactive, deprotonation of the nucleophile is proposed to occur by solvent. In the active site, Asn 106, His 108, and Asp 144 are positioned to assist with formyl transfer. However, mutagenesis {{studies have indicated that}} these residues are not individually essential for catalysis, as only mutations of two or more residues inhibit the <b>enzyme.</b> <b>Based</b> on the structure the negatively charged Asp144 is believed to increase the pKa of His108, allowing the protonated imidazolium group of His108 to enhances the electrophillicity of the N10-formyl-THF formyl group. Additionally, His108 and Asn106 are believed to stabilize the oxyanion formed in the transition state.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Enzyme</b> <b>based</b> DNA {{computers}} are usually {{of the form}} of a simple Turing machine; there is analogous hardware, in {{the form of a}}n enzyme, and software, in the form of DNA. Benenson, Shapiro and colleagues have demonstrated a DNA computer using the FokI enzyme and expanded on their work by going on to show automata that diagnose and react to prostate cancer: under expression of the genes PPAP2B and GSTP1 and an over expression of PIM1 and HPN. Their automata evaluated the expression of each gene, one gene at a time, and on positive diagnosis then released a single strand DNA molecule (ssDNA) that is an antisense for MDM2. MDM2 is a repressor of protein 53, which itself is a tumor suppressor. On negative diagnosis it was decided to release a suppressor of the positive diagnosis drug instead of doing nothing. A limitation of this implementation is that two separate automata are required, one to administer each drug. The entire process of evaluation until drug release took around an hour to complete. This method also requires transition molecules as well as the FokI enzyme to be present. The requirement for the FokI enzyme limits application in vivo, at least for use in [...] "cells of higher organisms". It should also be pointed out that the 'software' molecules can be reused in this case.|$|E
5000|$|As of late 2007, 3 {{structures}} {{have been}} solved for {{this class of}} enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , and [...] The overall structure of the <b>enzyme,</b> <b>based</b> on crystallization from E. coli, consists of 16 alpha helices which connect to 20 beta strands by turns and loops. There are four main domains: N, A, B, and C. Each domain has a central beta sheet with an alpha helix {{on at least one}} side. The N, A, and C domains are clustered together, while the B domain is slightly separated from the others and connected to them by two hinge regions. The active site is between the NAC group and the B domain. The A and B domains appear to facilitate ATP binding, while the N and C domains confer substrate specificity. The N domain is very similar to that of glycinamide ribonucleotide transformylase. Although the orientation of the B domains varies, the structure of GARS is very similar across organisms. Furthermore, the gene has been sequenced in many organisms, and E. coli shows between 41 and 52% identity with the GARS sequences of B. subtilis, S. cerevisiae, D. melanogaster, and D. pseudobscura. Human GARS-AIRS-GART {{has been shown to be}} most similar to that of mice, chimpanzees, and cows. Among the amino acids that are identical in B. subtilus, S. cerevisiae, D. melanogaster, and D. pseudobscura, almost a third are glycine and proline, which suggests that they play an important role in proper folding of the protein. In addition to similar structure across species, GARS as a whole has a very similar structure to D-alanine:D-alanine ligase, biotin carboxylase, and glutathione synthetase. All of these enzymes have an ATP binding domain classified as ATP-grasp domains.|$|E
5000|$|Then how {{was this}} {{pseudogene}} resurrected? It {{is not so}} clear to say and one can note that the similarity between {{the region of the}} kudu deletion and the sequence of the expressed seminal RNase pseudogene extends some 70 base pairs into the 3’ -untranslated region are 89% identical (with 62 of the 70 nucleotides). [...] We can expect that in order to repair the damaged seminal RNase there might be the gene conversion event took place between it and the pancreatic gene to create a new physiological evolution. Gene conversion is of two types - interallelic and interlocus gene conversions. The resurrection of seminal RNase gene function {{is believed to be the}} unexpected consequence of the interlocus gene conversion event of seminal RNase pseudogene with its homologous functional gene. In these recombination events, the genetic information is transferred from a donor functional locus to that of an acceptor pseudogene which is non-functional. Thus the non-functional seminal RNase pseudogene has acquired some new physiological functions being in the state of dead for many million years. This might be the first example in the literature with for the resurrection of a pseudogene by gene conversion event and it would be interesting to further test this data with more sequencing data. Later on another evolutionary aspect has been proposed in case of seminal RNase showing that the seminal RNase has been left with two quaternary forms: one is to exhibit special biological actions and the other is just an RNA-degrading <b>enzyme.</b> <b>Based</b> on this proposal the evolution of seminal RNase into these two structures that coexists and are more versatile structurally and biologically can be considered as treated as an evolutionary progress.|$|E

40|$|Inflammation {{remains a}} key event {{during most of}} the {{diseases}} and physiological imbalance. Acute inflammation is an essential physiological event by immune system for a protective measure to remove cause of inflammation and failure of resolution lead to chronic inflammation. Over a period of time, a number of drugs mostly chemical have been deployed to combat acute and chronic inflammation. Recently, <b>enzyme</b> <b>based</b> anti-inflammatory drugs became popular over conventional chemical based drugs. Serratiopeptidase, a proteolytic enzyme from trypsin family, possesses tremendous scope in combating inflammation. Serine protease possesses a higher affinity for cyclooxygenase (COX-I and COX-II), a key enzyme associated with production of different inflammatory mediators including interleukins (IL), prostaglandins (PGs) and thromboxane (TXs) etc. Currently, arthritis, sinusitis, bronchitis, fibrocystic breast disease, and carpal tunnel syndrome, etc. are the leading inflammatory disorders that affected the entire the globe. In order to conquer inflammation, both acute and chronic world, physician mostly relies on conventional drugs. The most common drugs to combat acute inflammation are Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) alone and or in combination with other drugs. However, during chronic inflammation, NSAIDs are often used with steroidal drugs such as autoimmune disorders. These drugs possess several limitations such as side effects, ADR, etc. In order to overcome these limitations and complications, <b>enzyme</b> <b>based</b> drugs (anti-inflammatory) emerged, and aim for a new high since the last decade. Serine protease, the largest proteolytic family has been reported for several therapeutic applications, including anti-inflammatory. Serratiopeptidase is a leading enzyme which has a very long history in medical as an effective anti-inflammatory drug. Current study emphasizes present scenario and future prospect of serratiopeptidase as an anti-inflammatory drug.

Here, we introduce a computational approach for annotation of <b>enzymes,</b> <b>based</b> on the observation that similar protein sequences are more likely to perform the same function if they share similar interacting partners. Results: The method has been tested against the PSI-BLAST program using a set of 3, 890 protein sequences from which interaction data was available. For protein sequences that align with at least 40 % sequence identity to a known enzyme, the specificity of our method in predicting the first three EC digits increased from 80 % to 90 % at 80 % coverage when compared to PSI-BLAST. Conclusion: Our method can also be used in proteins for which homologous sequences with known interacting partners can be detected.
