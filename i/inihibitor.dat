50|$|In many organisms, {{apoptosis}} can {{be regarded}} as an early cellular defense mechanism against a strong viral infection. Although, Heliothis zea Nudivirus 1 (HzNV-1 or Hz-1 virus), a relatively broad host range nudivirus, has been shown to block an induced-apoptosis gene (hhi1), and so, prevent his own death. A functional antiapoptosis gene, (Hz-iap2), has been highlighted to suppress the hhi1 gene which can either activate the expression of prodeath gene or alter the cell cycle within the host, resulting in the death of the cell. A second <b>inihibitor</b> gene (Ac-iap2) to the hhi1 gene has been also discovered, interestingly, Ac-iap2 was speculated to be a nonfunctional iap, raising many questions regarding its functionnality.|$|E

40|$|Dysregulated cell cycling is a {{universal}} hallmark of cancer and is often mediated by abnormal activation of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) and their cyclin partners. Overexpression of individual complexes are reported in multiple myeloma (MM), making them attractive therapeutic targets. In this study, we investigate the preclinical activity of a novel small-molecule multi-CDK inhibitor, AT 7519, in MM. We show the anti-MM activity of AT 7519 displaying potent cytotoxicity and apoptosis; associated with in vivo tumor growth inhibition and prolonged survival. At the molecular level, AT 7519 inhibited RNA polymerase II (RNA pol II) phosphorylation, a CDK 9, 7 substrate, associated with decreased RNA synthesis confirmed by [(3) H] Uridine incorporation. In addition, AT 7519 inhibited glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK- 3 beta) phosphorylation; conversely pretreatment with a selective GSK- 3 inhibitor and shRNA GSK- 3 beta knockdown restored MM survival, suggesting the involvement of GSK- 3 beta in AT 7519 -induced apoptosis. GSK- 3 beta activation was independent of RNA pol II dephosphorylation confirmed by alpha-amanitin, a specific RNA pol II <b>inihibitor,</b> showing potent inhibition of RNA pol II phosphorylation without corresponding effects on GSK- 3 beta phosphorylation. These results offer {{new insights into the}} crucial, yet controversial role of GSK- 3 beta in MM and show significant anti-MM activity of AT 7519, providing the rationale for its clinical evaluation in MM...|$|E

40|$|Serine proteases {{have proven}} to be {{promising}} pharmacological targets in contemporary drug discovery for cancer treatment. Since azaphenylalanine-based compounds manifest cytotoxic activity, we have selected serine protease inhibitors designed and synthesized in-house with large hydrophobic naphthalene moiety for screening. The cytotoxic potential of screened molecules was correlated to modifications of R 1 residues. The most cytotoxic were compounds with greater basicity; amidinopiperidines, piperidines and benzamidines. Amidinopiperidine-based compounds exert cytotoxicity in low mM range, with IC 50 18 mM and 22 mM for inhibitors 15 and 16 respectively. These compounds exhibited selective cytotoxicity towards the Burkitt’s lymphoma cells Ramos and Daudi, and proved nontoxic to PMBC, Jurkat and U 937. They induce caspase-dependent apoptotic cell death, as demonstrated by the use of a pan-caspase <b>inihibitor,</b> zVADfmk, which was able to rescue Ramos cells from compound(s) -induced apoptosis. We confirm a disruption of the pro-survival pathway in Burkitt’s lymphoma through NFkB inhibition. The accumulation of phosphorylated precursor (p 105) and inhibitory (IkB) molecules with no subsequent release of active NFkB implicated the involvement of proteasome. Indeed, we show that the amidinopiperidine-based compounds inhibit all three proteolytical activities of the human 20 S proteasome, with the most prominent effect being on the trypsin-like activity. Consistently, treatment of Ramos cells with these compounds led to an increase in ubiquitinated proteins. The amidinopiperidine-based serine protease inhibitors presented are, as selectiv...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that neuronal apoptosis is the result of an abortive attempt to re-enter the cell cycle, and more recently the cyclin-dependent (CDKs) and the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases, two superfamilies of kinases that influence and control cell cycle progression, have been implicated in neuronal apoptosis. Here, to examine whether CDK/MAPK related pathways are involved in excitotoxicity, we studied the actions of various kinase inhibitors on apoptosis induced by the ionotropic glutamate (Glu) receptor agonist, kainate (KA), in primary cultures of murine cerebellar granule cells (CGCs). KA-mediated neurotoxicity was concentration-dependent, as determined by a cell viability assay monitoring the reduction of 3 -(4, 5 -dimethylthiazole- 2 -yl) - 2, 5 -diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT), and largely apoptotic in nature, as shown by morphological examination and labelling of DNA fragmentation in situ using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) -mediated dUTP digoxigenin nick-end labelling (TUNEL). KA-mediated neurotoxicity and apoptosis was completely attenuated by the mixed CDK and MAP kinase inhibitor, olomoucine, in a concentration-dependent manner (50 [*]–[*] 600 [*]μM), and partially by roscovitine (1 [*]–[*] 100 [*]μM), a more selective CDK <b>inihibitor.</b> The p 38 MAP kinase inhibitor, SB 203580 (1 [*]–[*] 100 [*]μM), partially attenuated KA receptor-mediated apoptosis, as did the MAP kinase kinase inhibitors PD 98509 (1 [*]–[*] 100 [*]μM) and U 0126 (1 [*]–[*] 100 [*]μM).

40|$|Pemphigus is an {{autoimmune}} bullous disease {{characterized by}} {{loss of adhesion}} of keratinocytes that round up in {{a process known as}} acantholysis. While the molecular mechanisms underlying acantholysis are still unclear, {{it is well known that}} cell detachment is often associated with apoptosis. We have previously detected apoptotic keratinocytes in perilesional, yet undetached, pemphigus skin. Moreover, we have observed that Fas ligand (FasL) levels are significantly higher in untreated pemphigus sera (more than 0. 1 ng/ml) than in controls. As pemphigus sera induce apoptosis in cultured human keratinocytes, we wanted to analyze the apoptotic mechanisms in pemphigus. We first confirmed that pemphigus lesions contain apoptotic keratinocytes, by showing caspase- 3 activation. In addition, while Fas receptor (FasR) is expressed in the basal and partially in the suprabasal layers in pemphigus vulgaris (PV), it is detected throughout the epidermal layers in muco-cutaneous pemphigus. Furthermore, pemphigus sera-induced keratinocyte apoptosis is partially prevented by pretreatment with either caspase- 8 inhibitor or anti-FasL neutralizing antibody. Moreover, caspase- 8 activation induced by untreated pemphigus sera is partially inhibited by anti-FasL antibody. Untreated pemphigus sera induce the cleavage of desmoglein 1 and 3 (dsg 1, 3). Moreover, recombinant FasL dose-dependently cleaves dsg 1 and 3 (0. 1, 10, 100 ng/ml). Finally, caspase- 8 <b>inihibitor</b> prevents dsg cleavage, strongly indicating the critical role of FasL in the pathogenesis of pemphigus. In particular, high levels of FasL, contained in pemphigus sera exert a dual activity, by both inducing keratinocyte apoptosis and dsg cleavage...|$|E

Earlier reports suggested that angiotensin II play important roles in the pathogensis of chronic heart failure. However, the roles of endothelin 1 have not been fully clarified. Thus, we investigated the roles of endothelin in excitation-contraction coupling and relaxation in isolated single ventricular myocytes. We focused on the third kinase system: Rho dependent protein kinase (ROCK) {{in addition to the}} protein kinase A and C. We isolated single ventricular myocytes from Wister rats and measured intracellular calcium transients and cell contraction simultaneously. When we pretreated cells with PKC inhibitor, exposure to endothelin- 1 still produced positive inotropic and lusitrophic effects. These effects were not observed when cells were pretreated with PKC inhibitor and ROCK inhibitor or myosin light chain kinase <b>inihibitor.</b> Effects of myosin light chain phosphatase inhibitor simulated those of endothelin- 1. Inhibition of myosin light chain phosphatase accelerated the phosphorylation status of cardiac myosin light chain resulting in positive inotropic action similar to endothelin- 1. Our results suggested that endothelin might activate myosin light chain not only via PKC but also via ROCK pathway. 　Our working hypothesis is that endothelin 1 may produce positive inotropic effects via ROCK pathway. Thus we try to reveal the role of ROCK pathway in the regulation of contraction and relaxation in cardiac muscle. ...|$|E

Soybean lipoxygenase- 1 (LOX- 1), {{a paradigm}} for lipoxygenases isolated from different sources, {{is composed of}} two domains: a ~ 30 kDa N-terminal domain and a ~ 60 kDa C-terminal domain. We used limited proteolysis and gel-filtration chromatography to generate and isolate a ~ 60 kDa fragment of LOX- 1 ('mini-LOX'), produced by trypsin cleavage between lysine 277 and serine 278. Mini-LOX was subjected to N-terminal sequencing and to electrophoretic, chromatographic, and spectroscopic analysis. Mini-LOX {{was found to be}} more acidic and more hydrophobic than LOX- 1, and with a higher content of -helix. Kinetic analysis showed that mini-LOX dioxygenates linoleic acid with a catalytic efficiency approximately 3 -fold higher than that of LOX- 1 (33. 3 × 106 and 10. 9 × 106 M- 1 ·s- 1, respectively), the activation energy of the reaction being 4. 5 ± 0. 5 and 8. 3 ± 0. 9 kJ·mol- 1 for mini-LOX and LOX- 1, respectively.

Mini-LOX was able to bind artificial vesicles with higher affinity than LOX- 1, but the binding was less affected by calcium ions than was that of LOX- 1.

Patients with Stage II-IV locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer were randomized (2 : 1) to either 230 mg of LY 2603618 / 1000 mg/m(2) gemcitabine combined or 1000 mg/m(2) gemcitabine alone. OS was assessed using both a Bayesian augment control model and traditional frequentist analysis for inference. Progression-free survival (PFS), overall response rate (ORR), duration of response, pharmacokinetics (PK), and safety (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [AEs] v 3. 0) were also evaluated. Ninety-nine patients (n[*]=[*] 65, LY 2603618 /gemcitabine; n[*]=[*] 34, gemcitabine) were randomized (intent-to-treat population). The median OS (months) was 7. 8 (range, 0. 3 - 18. 9) with LY 2603618 /gemcitabine and 8. 3 (range, 0. 8 - 19. 1 +) with gemcitabine. Similarly, in a Bayesian analysis, the study was not positive since the posterior probability that LY 2603618 /gemcitabine was superior to gemcitabine in improving OS was 0. 3, which did not exceed the prespecified threshold of 0. 8.

In an initial study, 22% of tumors with acquired resistance to Gefitinib or Erlotinib had MET amplification.

The boosting dose of ritonavir acts as an inhibitor of CYP 3 A 4, thereby increasing darunavir bioavailability. Recently, ritonavir tablet has been on sale in place of soft capsule. However, pharmacokinetic study of darunavir by changing ritonavir form is still not clear. In this study, we aimed to compare with plasma darunavir concentrations by switching ritinavir soft capsule to tablet in Japanese HIV- 1 infected patients. Methods: We analyzed 34 Japanese HIV- 1 infected patients (32 males: 2 females) recruited at the National Hospital Organization Nagoya Medical Center. All patients had been administered with 800 / 100 mg darunavir/ritonavir once daily {{in combination with other}} antiretrovirals. Plasma darunavir concentrations were determined by an HPLC method. A pared t-test was used to compare with their concentrations by switching from ritonavir soft capsule to tablet. Results: The mean of age, body weight, and duration of antiretroviral therapy for 34 patients were 41. 9 (range: 24 &#x 2013; 62) years, 66. 3 (range: 51. 4 &#x 2013; 90. 0) kg, and 436 (range: 182 &#x 2013; 739) days, respectively. The mean&#x 00 B 1;SD darunavir concentration was 3. 44 &#x 00 B 1; 1. 78 &#x 00 B 5;g/ml when ritonavir soft capsule was co-administered.

40|$|Antiphospholipid {{syndrome}} (APS) {{is characterized}} by recurrent thrombosis or pregnancy morbidity associated with antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL). Impaired fibrinolysis is a contributing factor {{for the development of}} thrombosis, and the effect of aPL in the fibrinolytic system has been investigated. Impaired release of tPA and enhanced release of PAI- 1 after endothel activation is reported in patients with APS. Elevated Lipoprotein (a) levels have been found in APS, which results in inhibition of fibrinolytic activity. Phospholipid-bound β 2 -glycoprotein I (β 2 GPI) is a major autoantigen for aPLs. β 2 GPI exerts both anti-coagulant and pro-coagulant properties mainly by interacting with other phospholipid-binding proteins such as coagulation factors and protein C. Dramatic increase in the affinity of β 2 GPI to the cell surface is induced by binding of pathogenic anti-β 2 GPI antibodies, which may modify the physiological function of β 2 GPI and may affect the coagulation/fibrinolysis balance on the cell surface. Using chromogenic assays for measuring fibrinolytic activity, we demonstrated that addition of monoclonal anticardiolipin antibody (aCL) decreases the activity of extrinsic/intrinsic fibrinolysis. Significantly lower activity of intrinsic fibrinolysis was also demonstrated in the euglobulin fractions from APS patients. Endothelial cells and monocytes are activated by aPLs in vitro, resulting in production of tissue factor (TF), a major initiator of the coagulation system. Recently, aPLs are reported to induce thrombocytes to produce thromboxane. The importance of apoE receptor 2 on platelets for the binding of artificially-dimerized β 2 GPI was suggested. By investigating aPL-inducible genes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, we found that mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway was up-regulated. Using monocyte cell line, phosphorylation of p 38 MAPK, NF-κB translocation to the nuclear fraction, and up-regulated TF mRNA expression were demonstrated after treatment with monoclonal aCL. These phenomena were observed only in the presence of β 2 GPI. Moreover, a specific p 38 MAPK <b>inihibitor</b> SB 203580 decreased aCL/β 2 GPI-induced TF mRNA expression. Thus, aCL/β 2 GPI plays dual roles in the pathogenesis of APS, firstly by deranging fibrinolytic system and secondly by activating monocytes, endothelial cells and thrombocytes to produce tissue factor or thromboxane.

Although first-line treatment of cGVHD is based on controlled trials, second-line treatment is almost solely based on phase II trials or retrospective analyses. The consensus conference on clinical practice in cGVHD held in Regensburg aimed to achieve a consensus on the current evidence of treatment options as well as to provide guidelines for daily clinical practice. Treatment modalities are the use of steroids and calcineurin inhibitors as well as immunomodulating modalities (photopheresis, mTOR-inhibitors, thalidomide, hydroxychloroquine, vitamin A analogs, clofazimine), and cytostatic agents (mycophenolate mofetil, methotrexate, cyclophosphamide, pentostatin). Recent reports showed some efficacy of rituximab, alemtuzumab, and etanercept in selected patients. Moreover, tyrosine kinase <b>inihibitors</b> such as imatinib came into the field because of their ability to interfere with the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF-R) pathway involved in fibrosis. An other treatment option is low-dose thoracoabdominal irradiation. Although different treatment options are available, the “trial-and-error system” remains the only way to identify the drug effective in the individual patient, and valid biomarkers are eagerly needed to identify the likelihood of response to a drug in advance. Moreover, the sparse evidence for most treatment entities indicates the urgent need for systematic evaluation of second-line treatment options in cGVHD...|$|R
50|$|Alkyl {{substitution}} {{at position}} 7 has shown increased cytotoxicity, such as ethyl (C2H5) or chloromethyl (CH2Cl). These groups {{are able to}} react with the DNA {{in the presence of}} topo I which leads to more tumor activity. It has also been shown that increasing the length of the carbon chain (in position 7) leads to increased lipophilicity and consequently greater potency and stability in human plasma.Other 7-modified CPT analogues are silatecans and karenitecins. They are potent <b>inihibitors</b> on topo I and both have alkylsilyl groups in position 7 which make them lipophilic and more stable. Silatecans or 7-silylcampthothecins have shown reduced drug-HSA interactions which contributes to its blood stability and they can also cross the blood brain barrier. DB-67 is a 10-hydroxy derivative and is among the most active silatecans. BNP1350 which belongs to the series of karenitecins exhibits cytotoxic activity and ability to overcome drug resistance. Still another route to make CPT’s lipophilic is to introduce lipophilic substituents, such as iminomethyl or oxyiminomethyl moieties. One of the most potent compounds is the oxyiminomethyl derivative ST1481 that has the advantage to overcome drug resistance caused by transport systems.Basic nitrogen in a carbon chain at position 7 makes the compound more hydrophilic and hence more water-soluble. For example, is a derivate called CKD-602, which is a potent topo I inhibitor and successfully overcomes the poor water solubility and toxicity seen with CPT.|$|R

Cases of ademyosis in infertile women were collected for three years (January 1999 to December 2001) and the diagnoses were confirmed using transvaginal USG. Cases were grouped into two groups, i. e. group 1 (undergoing laparotomic resection) and group 2 (receiving treatment with aromatase inhibitor of anastrozole). Both groups were evaluated for changes in clinical symptoms, rate of successful pregnancy, and postoperative recurrency rate. During three years as many as 1619 infertility cases were managed, and among which 66 (4. 07 %) cases of adenomyosis were diagnosed with transvaginal USG. As many as 55 cases were analyzed, i. e., 32 cases underwent resection and 23 cases received aromatase inhibitor. Of 32 cases of surgical resection, the histopathological results showed 30 (93. 75 %) cases of adenomyosis and 2 (6. 25 %) cases of uterus myoma. In the group undergoing resection three cases (9. 4 %) were successfully pregnant, i. e., two cases had live birth, one case ended up with 6 -week abortion. Moreover, 25 (78. 1 %) cases were not pregnant and 4 (12. 5 %) cases had recurrency, while 24 (75. 35 %) cases experienced disappearance of symptoms yet not pregnant. On the other hand, of 23 cases in the group receiving aromatase inhibitor 2 (8. 6 %) cases were able to be pregnant, one case had live birth and another case ended up with abortion, while 14 (59. 1 %) cases had disappearance of symptoms yet not pregnant. During three months of treatment with aromatase inhibitor, a reduction in the lesion size between 7. 31 mm 3 and 25. 90 mm 3 were observed with CI 95 % (p < 0. 001). In conclusion, treatment with aromatase <b>inihibitor</b> did not heal lesions, but only reduced the size of adenomyosis lesions. On the other hand, resection could heal lesions, yet recurrency of disease may occur (12. 5 %) after one postoperative year.

40|$|Abstract Background Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase- 1 (PARP- 1) is a {{key enzyme}} {{involved}} in the repair of radiation-induced single-strand DNA breaks. PARP inhibitors such as olaparib (KU- 0059436, AZD- 2281) enhance tumor sensitivity to radiation and to topoisomerase I inhibitors like camptothecin (CPT). Olaparib is an orally bioavailable inhibitor of PARP- 1 and PARP- 2 that has been tested in multiple clinical trials. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate the characteristics of the sensitizing effect of olaparib for radiation and CPT in order to support clinical application of this agent. Methods DLD- 1 cells (a human colorectal cancer cell line) and H 1299 cells (a non-small cell lung cancer cell line) with differences of p 53 gene status were used. The survival of these cells was determined by clonogenic assay after treatment with drugs and X-ray irradiation. The γH 2 AX focus formation assay was performed to examine the influence of olaparib on induction and repair of double-stranded DNA breaks after exposure to radiation or CPT. Results A radiosensitizing effect of olaparib was seen even at 0. 01 μM. Its radiosensitizing effect after exposure for 2 h was similar to that after 24 h. H 1299 cells with depletion or mutation of p 53 were more radioresistant than H 1299 cells with wild-type p 53. However, similar enhancement of radiosensitization by olaparib was observed with all of the tested cell lines regardless of the p 53 status. Olaparib also sensitized cells to CPT. This sensitizing effect was seen at low concentrations of olaparib such as 0. 01 μM, and its sensitizing effect was the same at both 0. 01 μM and 1 μM. The combination of olaparib and CPT had a stronger radiosensitizing effect. The results of the γH 2 AX focus assay corresponded with the clonogenic assay findings. Conclusion Olaparib enhanced sensitivity to radiation and CPT at low concentrations and after relatively short exposure times such as 2 h. The radiosensitizing effect of olaprib was not dependent on the p 53 status of tumor cells. These characteristics could be advantageous for clinical radiotherapy since tumor cells may be exposed to low concentrations of olaparib and/or may have different levels of p 53 mutation. The combination of olaparib and CPT had a stronger radiosensitizing effect, indicating that combining a PARP <b>inihibitor</b> with a topoiomerase I inhibitor could be promising for clinical radiosensitization. </p...|$|E

It consists of an active site blocking moiety, hirudin 92 ̆ 07 b 2 ̆ 0742 ̆ 078, a fibrinogen-recognition exo-site binding moiety, hirudin 2 ̆ 0752 ̆ 0752 ̆ 07 b 2 ̆ 0762 ̆ 075, and a lilnker, hirudin 2 ̆ 0742 ̆ 0792 ̆ 07 b 2 ̆ 0752 ̆ 074, connecting these inhibitor moieties. Synthetic inhibitors were designed based on the C-terminal portion of hirudin. The bulky active site blocking moiety, hirudin 92 ̆ 07 b 2 ̆ 0742 ̆ 078, was replaced by small nonsubstrate-type active site ibhibitors of thrombin, e. q., dansyl-Arg-(D-pipecolic acid). The linker moiety was replaced by 3 ̆c 9 -amino acids of (12 -aminododecanoic acid) -(4 -aminobutyric acid), and hirudin 2 ̆ 0752 ̆ 0752 ̆ 07 b 2 ̆ 0762 ̆ 075 {{was used as a}} fibrinogen-recognition exo-site binding moiety in most of the inhibitors. The crystal structure of the inhibitor in complex with human 3 ̆b 1 -thrombin showed that dansyl, Arg, and D-pipecolic acid of the active site blocking moiety occupy S 3, S 1, and S 2 subsites of thrombin, respectively, and were therefore designated as P 3, P 1, and P 2 residues. The use of dansyl-Arg-(D-pipecolic acid) improved the affinity (Ki) of the <b>inihibitor</b> 10 - 100 -fold (down to 1. 70 7 102 ̆ 07 b 99 M) comparted to that of the similar compounds having D-Phe-Pro-Arg as their substrate-type inhibitor moiety (Ki = 102 ̆ 07 b 2 ̆ 079 - 102 ̆ 07 b 9 M). The linker connected to P 2 residue eliminated teh scissle peptide bond. The inhibitor was also stable against human plasma proteases. Further inhibitor design revealed that the toxic dansyl group could be replaced by 4 -tert-butylbenzenesulfonyl group and 1 - or 2 -naphthalenesulfonyl group for in vivo studies.

40|$|The innate immune {{response}} {{is the first}} barrier against external stimuli arising from disease-causing pathogens. The primary membrane associated Toll-Like receptors (TLRs) {{play an important role}} in the innate {{immune response}} by recognizing pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Recently nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD) proteins have been shown to serve as intracellular receptors that are also involved in the innate immune response. Caveolae are small plasma membrane invaginations that exist in a wide range of cell types. The overall goals of this proposal are to examine the molecular determinants of the interaction of the intracellular pathway (NOD 2) with plasma membrane (TLR 2) mediated events in the response of epithelial cells to bacterial pathogens and to identify the role of caveolae in the signaling events that may underlie this association. Revealing the mechanisms of interaction between NOD 2 and pathogens has significant importance to control or prevent Crohn's disease and benefits the public health issues. Accordingly, the specific aims are: Aim 1 : To reveal the molecular mechanism for the interaction between NOD 2 and MDP. We hypothesize that a cognitive sequence in the LRR of NOD 2 recognizes MDP and the cognitive sequence accounts for the interaction of PGN from Gram-positive microorganism in polarized epithelial cells. Aim 2 : to determine the requisite role of NOD 2 /MDP pathway in response to Gram-positive infection. We hypothesize that constitutive levels of NOD 2 are low in polarized epithelial cells. Gram-positive infection results in synthesis of TNFa that increases NOD 2 expression and TNFa in an autocrine fashion and enables the cells to participate in host defense via synthesis of IL- 8. Aim 3 : to identify an interaction between NOD 2 and TLR 2 pathways in mediating Gram-positive bacterium Staphylococcus aureus activation (IL- 8 synthesis) in polarized MDCK cells. IL- 8 synthesis in response to gram-positive infection will be contrasted in wildtype MDCK cells vs. cells in which NOD 2, TLR 2 or both have been silenced by siRNA. We also hypothesize that cross talk between NOD 2 and TLR 2 pathways occurs at a MAP kinase step and accordingly, experiments will be repeated in the presence of pharmacological (or genetic, e. g. dominant negative) <b>inihibitors</b> of p 38, JNK and MAPK...|$|R
40|$|Human papillomaviruses {{have been}} {{identified}} as the major aetiological factor in cervical cancer. Constitutive expression of the high risk HPV E 6 and E 7 oncoproteins are important for malignant transformation in infected keratinocytes. In particular, E 6 and E 7 bind to and inactivate the cellular tumor suppressors p 53 and pRB, respectively, thus delaying differentiation and inducing proliferation in suprabasal keratinocytes to enable HPV replication. One member of the pRB family, p 130 appears to be an important target for E 7 in promoting S-phase entry. Recently, it has been discovered that p 130 is part of a large protein complex termed DREAM. The composition of DREAM is temporally regulated during the cell cycle; being associated with E 2 F- 4 and either p 107 or p 130 in G 0 /G 1 and with the B-myb transcription factor in S/G 2. In this study, we addressed whether p 130 /DREAM complex is disrupted in HPVtransformed cell lines and whether this property is important for E 6 and E 7 function. We found that, p 130 -DREAM complex diminished in HPV-transformed cell lines (CaSki and SiHa) compared to control cell lines. However, p 130 /DREAM complex was reformed and cell cycle was arrested in HPV-transformed cell lines when E 6 /E 7 expression was targeted by specific small hairpin RNAs. We further demonstrated that the profound G 1 arrest in CaSki cells was dependent on p 130 /DREAM reformation by also targeting the expression of the DREAM component Lin- 54 and p 130. Moreover, p 130 /DREAM complex was completely disrupted in high risk HPV compared to low risk and cutaneous HPV when various types of HPV were expressed ectopically in T 98 G cells. Interestingly, one type of the cutaneous HPV, 48 has an ability to disrupt p 130 /DREAM quite dramatically although it binds to pocket protein with iv extremely low affinity. Furthermore we found that B-myb/DREAM complex is not critical in regulating S/G 2 phase in CaSki cells as determined by G 2 /M-phase genes in real time PCR. Finally, we showed the ability of E 7 in disrupting p 130 /DREAM complex through multiple mechanisms. Four different types of p 130 mutants were expressed in pMSCV puro vector and transfected into CaSki and T 98 G cell lines. The results demonstrate that 16 E 7 must bind to p 130 in order to induce the S/G 2 phase in HPV-transformed cell line. Furthermore, the cutaneous HPV type (48 E 7) promotes the S phase by binding towards p 21, the CDK <b>inihibitor.</b> The results show that continued HPV 16 E 6 /E 7 expression is necessary in cervical cancer cells to prevent cell-cycle arrest by a repressive p 130 /DREAM complex...|$|E
40|$|Ferrochelatase catalyses the {{synthesis}} of heme by inserting Fe(II) into protoporphyrin IX. The structure of ferrochelatase from yeast has been determined (2. 4 Å). The structure is homodimeric {{with each of the}} monomer made up of two Rossmann type domains with an active-site cleft between them. Metal binding studies with Co(II) and Cd(II) ions reveal the metal binding residues as being the His-Glu couple, His 235 and Glu 314. In addition Cd(II) binds to a second site coordinating Glu 97, His 317 and Glu 326. Metal binding studies on the bacterial ferrochelatase from Bacillus subtilis revealed an Fe(II) bound to the same His-Glu couple, His 183 and Glu 264. The structure was refined to 1. 7 Å. Site-directed mutants in the active site were studied and four of them were structurally determined, Tyr 13 Phe (2. 4 Å), Lys 87 Ala (1. 2 Å), His 183 Cys (2. 1 Å) and His 183 Ala (2. 4 Å). In combination with biochemical studies a likely mechanism of metal binding is suggested to involve the His-Glu couple. The porphyrin inhibitor N-MeMP binds with high affinity to ferrochelatase. Cu(II) insertion into N-MeMP was studied by a time series of soaking N-MeMP:ferrochelatase crystals. Cu(II) was seen accumulating into the ring while density for the N-methyl group was seen decreasing. Mass spectrometry studies on porphyrin metallation revealed that ferrochelatase catalyse metal insertion. Cu(II) was more efficiently inserted than Zn(II) which contrasts with studies on the substrate protoporphyrin IX. The most probable reason for the discrepancy is the degree of distortion of the macro-cycle, which therefore could be of importance in metal selectivity. Co-crystal structures of two different inhibitors were determined. N-MeMP crystallised with His 183 Ala variant of ferrochelatase revealed a different isomer, from the racemic mixture, located in the binding cleft compared to previously determined wild-type structure. The structure was refined to 2. 4 Å. His 183 is put forward as an important residue controlling binding specificity. The other <b>inihibitor,</b> 2, 4 -disulphonic deuteroporphyrin IX, has two bulky side-chains and was seen trapped on its way into the binding cleft of the His 183 Cys ferrochelatase variant (2. 1 Å). Frataxin is a mitochondrial protein involved in iron delivery and storage. The crystal structure of trimeric frataxin from yeast was determined to 3. 0 Å. The structure has a propeller-like shape with the monomers making up the wings. Each monomer is folded as an alpha/beta sandwich. The same fold was also found in other metallochaperones. In an EM-reconstruction of the 24 -meric oligomer the trimers were located at the corners with octahedral symmetry. Eight trimer structures could be docked into the envelope. Frataxin seems to be more dynamic in terms of its bi-functionality and iron storage properties compared to ferritin...|$|E
40|$|The tumor {{suppressor}} p 53 {{was identified}} 35 {{years ago and}} has since then been studied extensively, but despite all efforts, no drug or therapy directly involving it has been clinically approved - yet! A lot of potential new drugs are on their way that can reactivate p 53 function by various mechanisms. Even a whole new approach called cyclotherapy has been established, during which p 53 is activated in normal cells to protect patients from the adverse effects of chemotherapy while tumor cells are still being killed efficiently. In this thesis, 16 drug combinations are being described in this context (paper I). Four individual p 53 -activating compounds, i. e. tenovin- 6, leptomycin B (LMB), nutlin- 3 and actinomycin D at low doses (LDactD), were used prior to the addition of each one clinically approved chemotherapeutic agent, i. e vinblastine, vinorelbine, cytosine arabinoside or gemcitabine. LDactD, which is clinically approved, showed the most promising results. Unexpectedly, we identified two compounds that can inhibit p 53 ’s ability to induce p 21, i. e. the novel SirT 2 inhibitor tenovin-D 3 (paper II) and the widely used histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) trichostatin A (TSA) (paper III). Inhibition of p 21 in tumor cells might be desirable during cancer treatment to prevent tumor cells from undergoing cell cycle arrest, which would make them more vulnerable to classic chemotherapy. On the other hand, an inhibition of cell cycle arrest in normal cells might occur, which may worsen the side effects caused by chemotherapy. However, SirT 2 plays a role in neurodegenerative diseases, and hence compounds like tenovin-D 3 may be of use in the treatment thereof. Furthermore, the decrease in p 21 levels may be a contributing factor in the previously observed increase in efficacy during the generation of induced pluripotent stem cells upon treatment with TSA; also tenovin-D 3 could be useful in this context. With the aid of a cell-based screen we identified two small molecules that can activate p 53 : 1) MJ 05 {{was one of the most}} active hit compounds and was very selective (paper IV); it was highly cytotoxic in ARN 8, especially when combined with nutlin- 3, whereas it was cytostatic or had a very mild effect in other tumor cell lines and normal cells. It inhibited tumor growth in vivo, an effect that was enhanced upon co-treatment with nutlin- 3. Furthermore, MJ 05 selectively killed chronic myelogenous leukemia stem cells ex vivo while having milder effects in leukocyte stem cells derived from cord blood. Preliminary data  strongly suggest that MJ 05 acts by inhibition of pyrimidine (deoxy-) nucleotide synthesis. 2) Despite being a hit compound in our screen, MJ 25 was not very potent at activating p 53 (paper V). Nevertheless, its ability to inhibit thiredoxin reductase 1 (TrxR 1) and its selectivity towards melanoma cell lines compared with normal cells were interesting features. We compared it with the TrxR 1 <b>inihibitor</b> auranofin, which was very potent and selective at killing melanoma cells in cell viability assays. The insolubility of MJ 25 at concentrations required for in vivo studies prevented us from testing it on xenografts in mice. Furthermore, MJ 25 might not be specific for TrxR 1, so the identification of additional targets could be investigated in the future. Auranofin, the other hand, has a more defined mechanism of action and is clinically approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. These traits combined with its potentially selective cytotoxic effect at low micromolar concentrations in melanoma cells may turn this compound into  a potential drug candidate to be tested in patients suffering from malignant melanoma. In the final study presented in this thesis (paper VI) we tested the small molecule tenovin- 6 in zebrafish embryos The compound had been described previously by our group. The original aim of this study was to investigate if the activation of p 53 in an organism could affect the ability of tumor cells to disseminate. Even though tenovin- 6 did not activate wild-type p 53 under the conditions tested, in vivo activity of the compound was still detectable, since embryos expressing mutant p 53 (M 214 K) displayed an increase in p 53 protein levels; furthermore, the compound was lethal in a dose- and time-dependent manner, and the embryos lost most of their brown/black pigmentation. The exact mechanism behind the latter observation could not be elucidated in the course of the project. However, tyrosinase, a key enzyme in melanogenesis, was not inhibited by tenovin- 6, and the combination of data obtained by others on mutated or pharmacologically inhibited vacuolar H+-ATPase (V- ATPase) and yeast mutant strains suggested that the compound may target V-ATPase...|$|E
