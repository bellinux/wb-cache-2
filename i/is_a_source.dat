5|$|A four-part series {{published}} between August and November 1996, Venom: The Hunger {{introduces the}} Venom symbiote's reliance on phenethylamine for survival (which requires it to eat human brains after depleting Brock's {{supply of the}} chemical) and reveals that chocolate <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>source</b> of the chemical. Brock refuses to eat human brains; the symbiote abandons him, and he is locked in an asylum {{under the care of}} the deranged Dr. Paine. Brock escapes to hunt the symbiote, which has gone on a killing spree to obtain brains. He reunites with the symbiote (after finding an alternative source of the chemical), but Paine steals the symbiote for himself. Brock frees the symbiote, and again becomes Venom.|$|E
5|$|As of 2016, Uranus {{is known}} to have 13 inner moons. Their orbits lie inside that of Miranda. All inner moons are intimately {{connected}} to the rings of Uranus, which probably resulted from the fragmentation of one or several small inner moons. The two innermost moons (Cordelia and Ophelia) are as shepherds of Uranus's ε ring, whereas the small moon Mab <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>source</b> of Uranus's outermost μ ring. There may be two additional small (2–7km in radius) undiscovered shepherd moons located about 100km exterior to Uranus' α and β rings.|$|E

5|$|Basic {{research}} on cabbage phytochemicals is ongoing to discern if certain cabbage compounds may affect health or have anti-disease effects. Such compounds include sulforaphane and other glucosinolates which may stimulate {{the production of}} detoxifying enzymes during metabolism. Studies suggest that cruciferous vegetables, including cabbage, may have protective effects against colon cancer. Cabbage <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>source</b> of indole-3-carbinol, a chemical under basic research for its possible properties.|$|E
5|$|Certain {{mushrooms}} enjoy usage as therapeutics in folk medicines, such as Traditional Chinese medicine. Notable medicinal mushrooms with a well-documented {{history of}} use include Agaricus subrufescens, Ganoderma lucidum, and Ophiocordyceps sinensis. Research has identified compounds produced by {{these and other}} fungi that have inhibitory biological effects against viruses and cancer cells. Specific metabolites, such as polysaccharide-K, ergotamine, and β-lactam antibiotics, are routinely used in clinical medicine. The shiitake mushroom <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>source</b> of lentinan, a clinical drug approved for use in cancer treatments in several countries, including Japan. In Europe and Japan, polysaccharide-K (brand name Krestin), a chemical derived from Trametes versicolor, is an approved adjuvant for cancer therapy.|$|E
5|$|Contact with {{ammunition}} <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>source</b> of lead exposure. As of 2013, lead-based ammunition {{production is}} the second largest annual use of lead in the US, accounting for over 60,000 metric tons consumed in 2012, {{second only to the}} manufacture of storage batteries. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) can not regulate cartridges and shells, as a matter of law. Lead birdshot is banned in some areas, but this is primarily {{for the benefit of the}} birds and their predators, rather than humans. Non-lead alternatives include steel, tungsten-nickel-iron, bismuth-tin, and tungsten-polymer.|$|E

5|$|Harmless to humans, the winghead shark {{is caught}} {{throughout}} its range using gillnets, seines, stake nets, longlines, and hook-and-line. The meat is sold fresh, the fins are exported to Asia for shark fin soup, the liver <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>source</b> of vitamin oil, and the offal is processed into fishmeal. This species is taken {{in large numbers}} in some areas, {{such as in the}} Gulf of Thailand and off India and Indonesia, and anecdotal evidence indicates its population has suffered as a result. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has listed the winghead shark as Endangered. This species is only infrequently caught in Australian waters, where it has been assessed regionally as Least Concern by the IUCN.|$|E
5|$|In March 2016, an NGO, Justice Centre, {{reported}} {{its findings}} that deemed one domestic worker in six in Hong Kong {{to have been}} forced into labour. It criticised the government for being in denial that Hong Kong <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>source,</b> destination and transit area for human trafficking and forced labour, and said Hong Kong lags behind other countries in having a comprehensive set of laws and policies to tackle forced labour or trafficking.|$|E
5|$|Malawian cuisine is diverse, with tea {{and fish}} being popular {{features}} of the country's cuisine. Sugar, coffee, corn, potatoes, sorghum, cattle and goats are also important components of the cuisine and economy. Lake Malawi <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>source</b> of fish including chambo (similar to bream) usipa (similar to sardine), and mpasa (similar to salmon and kampango). Nsima is a food staple made from ground corn and typically served with side dishes of meat and vegetables. It is commonly eaten for lunch and dinner.|$|E

5|$|Oil shale {{has been}} used for {{industrial}} purposes since the early 17th century, when it was mined for its minerals. Since the late 19th century, shale oil has also been used for its oil content and as a low grade fuel for power generation. However, barring countries having significant oil shale deposits, its use for power generation is not particularly widespread. Similarly, oil shale <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>source</b> for production of synthetic crude oil and it is seen as a solution towards increasing domestic production of oil in countries that are reliant on imports.|$|E
5|$|Chris Wilton, a {{recently}} retired tennis professional, is taken on as {{an instructor at}} an upmarket club in London.

During a family gathering, Chris meets Tom's American fiancée, Nola Rice, and they are instantly attracted to each other. Tom's mother, Eleanor, does not approve of her son's relationship with Nola, a struggling actress, which <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>source</b> of tension in the family. Chloe encourages her father, Alec, to give Chris {{a job as an}} executive in one of his companies; he begins to be accepted into the family and marriage is discussed.|$|E
5|$|Gas metal {{arc welding}} can be {{dangerous}} if proper precautions are not taken. Since GMAW employs an electric arc, welders wear protective clothing, including heavy leather gloves and protective long sleeve jackets, to avoid exposure to extreme heat and flames. In addition, {{the brightness of the}} electric arc <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>source</b> of the condition known as arc eye, an inflammation of the cornea caused by ultraviolet light and, in prolonged exposure, possible burning of the retina in the eye. Conventional welding helmets contain dark face plates to prevent this exposure. Newer helmet designs feature a liquid crystal-type face plate that self-darken upon exposure to high amounts of UV light. Transparent welding curtains, made of a polyvinyl chloride plastic film, are often used to shield nearby workers and bystanders from exposure to the UV light from the electric arc.|$|E
