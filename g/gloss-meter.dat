40|$|Abstract. Polyurethane (PU) {{coatings}} with additives, such as UV-curing monomers and oligomers, ultraviolet absorbing (UVA) and hindered amine (HALS), were accelerated with Xenon lamp {{to study}} the effect of additives on photo aging performance of PU coatings. The ageing behavior of samples was evaluated with <b>gloss-meter,</b> chromatic meter, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and scanning electron microscope (SEM). The {{results indicated that the}} anti-aging of coating was improved by the synergy effect of 1. 5 wt. % HALS(Tinuvin 292), 3 wt. % UV-curing resin (611 B- 85) and 1 wt. % UVA(UV 1130) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{perceived}} glossiness of 12 flat {{samples and}} 18 bumpy samples with various colors and gloss levels is estimated by 13 observers using magnitude estimation technique. Each sample is measured with the <b>gloss-meter</b> as well. It is found that bumpy surface shows lower measured gloss level than flat surface {{treated with the}} same level of UV coating. The perceived glossiness of bumpy surface is higher than that of flat surface with low level UV coating treatment while perceived glossiness of bumpy surface is lower than that of flat surface with high level UV coating treatment. This record was migrated from the OpenDepot repository service in June, 2017 before shutting down...|$|E
40|$|The {{theoretical}} {{part of the}} thesis is focused on surface treatments, their evaluation {{from the point of}} view visual properties, plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition and analysis of thin layers prepared by plasma polymerization. The experimental part of the thesis deals with surface treatment of stainless steel AISI 304. Thin layers of pp-HMDSO (plasma-polymer) and of DLC are deposited on the steel´s surface for the purpose of preparing transparent layer, which protect steel´s surface against of making finger prints visible. As an objective method is chosen an immersion test in artificial sweat solution according to standard ČSN EN ISO 105 -E 04. Evaluation of the test is measured by a <b>gloss-meter</b> and by a colorimeter. Prepared layers are identificated by FTIR method...|$|E
40|$|Adhesively bonded {{repairs to}} {{metallic}} aircraft structure {{can be used}} in a variety of applications to solve difficult maintenance issues where traditional mechanically fastened repairs are often unsatisfactory. For example bonded repairs have been applied to reduce stress intensity in fatigue prone areas of aircraft and, thereby, extend service life of the component, providing substantial maintenance savings. Despite their valuable contribution to aircraft maintenance, bonded repairs are treated as fail-safe items when used on primary aircraft structue. One of the reasons for the lack of credit for bonded repairs is the absence of a reliable non-destructive inspection (NDI) technique that can guarantee bond quality and strength. One solution to reduce this problem is the development of objective prebond inspection techniques that can guarantee the quality and reliability of the critical surface treatment process applied prior to the adhesive bonding operation. The use of a <b>gloss-meter</b> unit and surface quality monitor to quantify the prebond condition of metallic substrates is an effort to further improve the reliability and reproducibility of current bonding operations...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to detect local gloss and surface {{structure}} changes of sodium chloride tablets. The changes in surface structure were reflected by gloss variation, which was measured using a diffractive optical element-based <b>gloss-meter</b> (DOG). By scanning a surface area, we constructed a 2 -dimensional gloss map that characterized the tablet’s surface structure. The gloss variation results were compared with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images and average surface roughness values that were measured by conventional diamond stylus profilometry. The profilometry data showed a decrease in tablet surface roughness as a function of compression force. In general, a smoother surface contributes to higher average gloss values. The average gloss values for this material, in contrast, showed a decrease as a function of the compression force. The sequence of particle fragmentation and deformation together with crack formation in sodium chloride particles resulted in a loss of gloss for single sodium chloride particles at the tablet surfaces, which could be detected by the DOG. These results were supported by the SEM images. The results show that detailed information regarding tablets’ surface structure changes can be obtained by detection of local gloss variation and average gloss...|$|E
40|$|Objective. This study aims {{to compare}} several {{mechanical}} and optical properties between three different CAD/CAM materials. The properties tested are: flexural strength, modulus of elasticity, hardness, translucency and surface gloss. Background. Typically, CAD/CAM restorations are either ceramic based or resin based. A new resin-ceramic hybrid material {{has recently been}} introduced and is thought to combine the advantages of both materials. Methods. Samples were divided into three groups, leucite-reinforced porcelain (IPS Empress CAD), lithium dicilicate (IPS e. max CAD) and resin-ceramic hybrid material (Vita Enamic). Twenty-six bar-shaped specimens were fabricated for each group by cutting standard CAD/CAM blocks. 3 -point bending test and Vickers diamond pyramid indenters were {{used to test the}} flexural strength and microhardness respectively. Seven veneers were fabricated for each material with a thickness of 0. 5 mm using a CAD/CAM milling machine. These veneers were used to test the optical properties via spectrophotometry and <b>gloss-meter</b> analysis. One-way ANOVA, and the Tukey HSD post hoc test were used for statistical analysis between the groups (P 3 ̆c 0. 05). Results. No significant difference was found between IPS Empress CAD and Enamic for flexural strength and surface gloss. However {{there was a significant difference}} when comparing IPS e. max CAD to the other materials. When comparing hardness and translucency of Enamic to the other materials there was a significant difference, however, no difference was found between IPS Empress CAD and IPS e. max CAD. Conclusion. Based on the result of this study, the current commercially available hybrid resin-ceramic material (VITA Enamic) showed, for the most part, similar properties to the machinable leucite-reinforced porcelain (IPS Empress CAD). Nevertheless, it does not appear to have any significant advantages over existing all ceramic materials, which may prove to be more esthetic with time. Therefore, the use of this class of material might be suitable for simple conservative indirect restorations. Grants. This study was funded by HPD grant...|$|E
