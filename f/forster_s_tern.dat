40|$|Laguna de Cuyutlán, in {{the state}} of Colima, Mexico, is the only large coastal wetland in a span of roughly 1150 km. Despite this, the study of its birds has been largely neglected. Between 2003 and 2006 we {{assessed}} the waterbirds nesting in the middle portion of Laguna Cuyutlán, a large tropical coastal lagoon, through field visits. We documented the nesting of 15 species of non-Laridae waterbirds: Neotropic Cormorant (Phalacrocorax brasilianus), Tricolored Egret (Egretta tricolor), Snowy Egret (Egretta thula), Little Blue Heron (Egretta caerulea), Great Egret (Ardea alba), Cattle Egret (Bubulcus ibis), Black-crowned Nightheron (Nycticorax nycticorax), Yellow-crowned Night-heron (Nyctanassa violacea), Green Heron (Butorides virescens), Roseate Spoonbill (Platalea ajaja), White Ibis (Eudocimus albus), Black-bellied Whistling-duck (Dendrocygna autumnalis), Clapper Rail (Rallus longirostris), Snowy Plover (Charadrius alexandrinus), and Black-necked Stilt (Himantopus mexicanus).

The thesis takes a context-oriented approach to the topic, drawing on the actual historical, social and political circumstances of the British Raj. Looking into the challenges that the British encountered during colonial expansion, the thesis aims to show the extent to which <b>Forster</b> <b>s</b> work has been influenced by the current affairs of his time. Keeping in mind the author s anticolonial views, it seems appropriate to argue that E. M. <b>Forster</b> <b>s</b> A Passage to India is predominantly occupied with unearthing the gross imbalance of power in the Indian colony, as well as the ensuing repercussions on intercultural relations. Thus, in this thesis, the focus will be on the contrast between the British and the Indian communities. It will examine the fundamental difference between the East and the West, namely the spirituality of the East as opposed to the realism of the West, and the way these two worldviews are represented in the novel. As spirituality and realism in various forms are shown to be embedded throughout the novel, especially in matters of emotionality and types of knowledge, the conclusion of this thesis will suggest that these contribute to the failure of amiable colonial relations...|$|R

In total, 13 resident bird species were observed [Wedge-tailed Shearwater (Puffinus pacificus), Masked Booby (S. dactylatra), Brown Booby (Sula leucogaster), Red-footed Booby (S. sula), Lesser Frigatebird (Fregata arid), Great Frigatebird (F. minor), Black Noddy (Anous minim's), Brown Noddy A. stolidus), Crested Tern (Sterna bergii), Sooty <b>Tern</b> (<b>S.</b> fuscata), Fairy <b>Tern</b> (<b>S.</b> nereis), Black-naped <b>Tern</b> (<b>S.</b> sumatrana), and Buff-banded Rail (Gallirallus philippensis) ]. Segregation for nesting habitat {{was similar to that}} previously observed on other coral-reef islets of the Coral Sea. Breeding periods were either in the winter (Masked and Red-footed Boobies, Frigatebirds, Fairy Tern) or in the summer (Wedge-tailed Shearwater, Black and Brown Noddies, Crested and Black-naped Terns) or year-round (Brown Booby). Sooty Terns bred twice a year (summer and spring), but this was not consistent across years. Estimates of breeding population sizes for the whole Chesterfield-Bampton and Bellona groups are proposed for Wedge-tailed Shearwater (90, 000 to 106, 000 breeding pairs), Masked Booby (280 - 500 pairs), Brown Booby (3, 800 - 5, 800 pairs), Red-footed Booby (7, 200 - 7, 300 pairs), Lesser Frigatebird (1, 600 pairs), Great Frigatebird (350 - 480 pairs), Black Noddy (29, 000 - 45, 000 pairs), Brown Noddy (15, 000 - 23, 000 pairs), Crested Tern (80 - 100 pairs), Sooty Tern (11, 000 - 46, 000 pairs), and Black-naped Tern (70 - 90 pairs). Interannual fluctuation in breeding population size was apparent in Wedge-tailed Shearwater. Over the last 30 yr, an increase in Brown Booby abundance was noted, whereas declines are suspected for the Fairy Tern and Buff-banded Rail.

40|$|Historically, least terns (Sterna antillarum) {{were one}} of the most common tern species in North America. However, {{population}} declines have resulted from direct and indirect anthropogenic pressures on their breeding and foraging habitat. Three subspecies of least terns have been described within the United States: California least <b>tern</b> (<b>S.</b> a. browni), Interior least <b>tern</b> (<b>S.</b> a. athalassos), and East Coast least <b>tern</b> (<b>S.</b> a. antillarum). California and Interior subspecies are listed as endangered under the U. S. Endangered Species Act. However, the taxonomic status of least terns is a highly contentious issue which has implications for setting conservation priorities at erroneous levels of taxonomic distinctness. Thus, understanding population structure and taxonomy is critical for successful conservation of least terns. To clarify the phylogeographic patterns and population structure and evaluate the traditional subspecific designations, we examined variation in two mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) genes and 10 microsatellite loci among least terns in North America. MtDNA control region sequences and 10 polymorphic microsatellite loci were used to evaluate traditional subspecific designations and genetic structure in least terns...|$|R

40|$|The taxonomic {{identity}} of endangered {{populations of the}} Least Tern (Sternula antillarum) has long been debated. Their current conservation status provides even more impetus to examine the taxonomic distinctness of these groups. We used rapidly evolving mitochondrial DNA control-region sequences (840 base pairs; n = 188) and microsatellite DNA data (7 loci; n = 417) to examine genetic structure within and among three subspecies that occur within the United States: California Least <b>Tern</b> (<b>S.</b> a. browni), Interior Least <b>Tern</b> (<b>S.</b> a. athalassos), and Eastern Least <b>Tern</b> (<b>S.</b> a. antillarum). Although significant genetic structure was observed among breeding populations from across the species’ range, our data indicated little evidence of genetic structure within traditional subspecific groups. Isolation-by-distance analyses, however, identified subtle patterns that may reflect sex-specific differences in dispersal behavior. Our analyses likewise demonstrated little population subdivision among subspecific groups, which raises questions regarding the taxonomic status of traditionally defined subspecies. Our findings can therefore be used to consider a reevaluation of Least Tern subspecies by the American Ornithologists’ Union’s Committee on Taxonomy and Nomenclature. We further emphasize the need for studies of range-wide breeding-site fidelity and natal philopatry to better understand interpopulation movements of individuals throughout the annual cycle...|$|R

40|$|Energy {{budgets for}} {{nestling}} growth are presented for the Sandwich Tern Sterna sandvicensis, Common <b>Tern</b> <b>S.</b> hirundo, Arctic <b>Tern</b> <b>S.</b> paradisaea, and Herring Gull Larus argentatus. Chicks were either raised in captivity (growth efficiencies) or {{removed from the}} nest periodically for measurement of basal metabolic rate (BMR). Validation of the laboratory budgets relies on determinations of chick field metabolic rate assessed by the doubly labelled water technique (available for Arctic Tern and one other larid). Comparative analysis suggests that when chicks of these species experience growth rates typical of field conditions avenues of energy allocation summed over the entire period up to fledging show close similarity. Energy used {{in the production of}} body tissue averaged 27 % (of which 7 % for biosynthesis) while BMR accounted for 45 %, the remainder being cost of activity and thermoregulation (28 %). Where quantified, cost of temperature regulation accounted for only 10 % of the total expenditure under field conditions. A regression made of metabolic energy (ME) intake over the entire nestling period against body mass of the fledging based on eight studies of gulls and terns resulted in ME = 35. 15. M 1. 015. This predictive equation also gave satisfying results in non-larids beyond the weight range of the birds studied (100 - 1000 g) ...|$|R

Daily energy expenditure (DEE), measured using doubly-labeled water, {{was only slightly}} higher in the chicks from the polar environments, despite the higher levels of basal metabolisms (BMR) and higher costs for thermoregulation. Apparently, thermoregulatory cost {{as part of the}} DEE of the chick is only a minor item thanks to parental brooding, which may account for energy savings ranging from 40 to 80 %. A simple model indicates that the magnitude of these savings is dictated by the parental time budget (i. e. the minimal foraging time needed to meet age-dependent energy requirements of chick). Basal metabolic rate in chicks of the six available studies increased with latitude. The differences could relate to a higher capacity to produce heat, which is necessary in polar environments. The basal-metabolic-rate levels in adult terms, however, do not match this latitudinal pattern for the growing chicks. Ontogenetic studies over a longer time scale would be required to clarify these discrepancies in latitudinal pattern of BMR, for which a functional explanation is given in terms of differences in migratory biology...|$|R

The percentage of food lost topirates in thecolony(2. 1 %,n = 921) wassimilarthan in groupsoftem chicksat the beach(2. 4 %, n = 206).
