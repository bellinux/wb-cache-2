25|$|The {{canonical}} Wnt Pathway {{involves the}} accumulation of β-catenin in the cytoplasm, which activates transcription factors. Casein <b>kinase</b> 1 epsilon, and related casein <b>kinase</b> 1 delta, is dephosphorylated in this pathway. Dephospho rylation of casein <b>kinase</b> 1 epsilon is likely achieved by Protein Phosphatase 2(PP2A), which increases both the enzymes' <b>kinase</b> activity in vivo. Casein <b>kinase</b> 1 epsilon and casein <b>kinase</b> 1 delta have been implicated in increasing β-catenin's stability in the cytoplasm, although studies of the mechanism for this stabilization are inconclusive. The current theory for how casein <b>kinase</b> 1 epsilon and/or casein <b>kinase</b> 1 delta function in this pathway is that both casein kinases either directly stabilize β-catenin though positive regulation, or that they indirectly stabilizes β-catenin through negative regulation of the β-catenin degradation complex (protease).|$|E

Like other casein <b>kinase</b> 1 protein family members, casein <b>kinase</b> 1 epsilon recognizes the Ser(p)XXSer/Thr motif for phosphorylation. It is found in the cytoplasm as a monomer and can phosphorylate a variety of proteins, including itself. This autophosphorylation occurs in the protein's C-Terminal domain, a region believed to behave as a pseudosubstrate, and inhibits <b>kinase</b> activity.|$|E
25|$|As {{previously}} stated, the C-Terminal {{domain of}} casein <b>kinase</b> 1 epsilon behaves as a pseudosubstrate when phosphorylated, inhibiting <b>kinase</b> activity. The C-Terminal domain {{has also been}} shown to be dephosphorylated by phosphatases such as Protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) in vitro and cell culture, which regulates levels of active casein <b>kinase</b> in vivo. Current theory of circadian rhythms hypothesizes that this phosphorylation/dephosphorylation cycle of casein <b>kinase</b> 1 epsilon is important in modulation of the period of circadian rhythms in the cell, with increased phosphorylation decreasing casein <b>kinase</b> 1 epsilon activity (and subsequently increasing active CRY and PER) and dephosphorylation of casein <b>kinase</b> 1 epsilon resulting in a more active <b>kinase</b> (and lower levels of active CRY and PER).|$|E
40|$|Mutationally {{activated}} <b>kinases</b> play {{an important}} role in the progression and metastasis of many cancers. Despite numerous oncogenic alterations implicated in metastatic prostate cancer, mutations of <b>kinases</b> are rare. Several lines of evidence suggest that nonmutated <b>kinases</b> and their pathways are involved in prostate cancer progression, but few <b>kinases</b> have been mechanistically linked to metastasis. Using a mass spectrometry-based phosphoproteomics dataset in concert with gene expression analysis, we selected over 100 <b>kinases</b> potentially implicated in human metastatic prostate cancer for functional evaluation. A primary in vivo screen based on overexpression of candidate <b>kinases</b> in murine prostate cells identified 20 wild-type <b>kinases</b> that promote metastasis. We queried these 20 <b>kinases</b> in a secondary in vivo screen using human prostate cells. Strikingly, all three RAF family members, MERTK, and NTRK 2 drove the formation of bone and visceral metastasis confirmed by positron-emission tomography combined with computed tomography imaging and histology. Immunohistochemistry of tissue microarrays indicated that these <b>kinases</b> are highly expressed in human metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer tissues.

40|$|Reversible {{phosphorylation}} {{of bacterial}} transcriptional regulators (TRs) {{belonging to the}} family of two-component systems (TCSs) is a well-established mechanism for regulating gene expression. Recent evidence points to the fact that reversible phosphorylation of bacterial TRs on other types of residue, i. e. serine, threonine, tyrosine and cysteine, is also quite common. The phosphorylation of the ester type (phospho-serine/threonine/tyrosine) is more stable than the aspartate phosphorylation of TCSs. The <b>kinases</b> which catalyse these phosphorylation events (Hanks-type serine/threonine protein <b>kinases</b> and bacterial protein tyrosine <b>kinases)</b> are also much more promiscuous than the TCS <b>kinases,</b> i. e. each of them can phosphorylate several substrate proteins.
