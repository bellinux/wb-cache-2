25|$|When {{trustees}} fail {{in their}} main duties, the law imposes remedies {{according to the}} nature of the breach. In general, breaches of rules surrounding performance of the trust's terms can be remedied through an award of specific performance, or compensation. Breaches of the duty of care will trigger a right to compensation. Breaches of the duty to avoid conflicts of interest, and misapplications of property will give rise to a restitutionary claim, to restore the property taken away. In these last two situations, the courts of equity developed further principles of liability that could be applied even when a trustee had gone bankrupt. Some recipients of property that came from a breach of trust, as well as people who had assisted in a breach of trust, might incur liability. Equity recognised not merely a personal, but also a proprietary claim over assets taken in breach of trust, and perhaps also profits made in breach of the duty of loyalty. A proprietary claim meant that the claimant could demand the thing in priority to other creditors of the bankrupt trustee. Alternatively, the courts would follow an asset or trace its value if the trust property was exchanged for some other asset. If trust property had been given to a third party, the trust fund could claim back the property as of right, unless the recipient was a bona fide purchaser. Generally, any recipient of trust property who knew about the breach of trust (or maybe ought to have known) could be made to give back the value, even if they had themselves exchanged the thing <b>for</b> <b>other</b> <b>assets.</b> Lastly, against people who may never have received trust property but had assisted in a breach of trust, and had done so dishonestly, a claim arose to return the property's value.|$|E

40|$|Commercial {{real estate}} makes up a {{relatively}} small percentage of most institutional portfolios, even though the existing literature has consistently reported attractive risk-return characteristics that would suggest much larger allocations. This discrepancy has been explained by a perceived lack of comparability between return series calculated for real estate and those calculated <b>for</b> <b>other</b> <b>asset</b> classes. Just as investors {{actively involved in the}} futures markets do not consider individual common stocks to be traded continuously, those active in the stock market do not consider real estate to be traded continuously. In both cases, adjustments to reported returns are necessary to achieve a degree of comparability. This study makes such adjustments, using sales data from properties that help comprise the National Council of Real Estate Investment Fiduciaries / Frank Russell Company (NCREIF/FRC) Index to generate a "transaction-driven" commercial real estate return series. Examination of the risk-return characteristics of this series shows that it is quite different from traditionally reported real estate return series and far more consistent with risk-return characteristics that have been reported <b>for</b> <b>other</b> <b>asset</b> classes.

5000|$|Friedman himself {{refers to}} {{financing}} transfer payments with base money {{as evidence that}} monetary policy still has power when conventional policies have failed, {{in his discussion of}} the Pigou effect, in his 1968 AER Presidential address. Specifically, Friedman argues that [...] "the revival of belief in the potency of money policy ... was strongly fostered among economists by the theoretical developments initiated by Haberler but named for Pigou that pointed out a channel - namely changes in wealth - whereby changes in the real quantity of money can affect aggregate demand even if they do not alter interest rates." [...] Friedman is clear that money must be produced [...] "in other ways" [...] than open-market operations, which - like QE - involve [...] "simply substituting money <b>for</b> <b>other</b> <b>assets</b> without changing total wealth." [...] Friedman references a paper by Gottfried Haberler written in 1952, where Haberler says, [...] "Suppose the quantity of money is increased by tax reductions or government transfer payments, and the resulting deficit is financed by borrowing from the central bank or simply printing money".|$|E

Despite over 100 firemen attending the fire, the hall and new organ were damaged beyond repair. Over 10,000 people stood in the streets around the hall to view the fire. There were no serious injuries - the hall had closed for the day - though two boys fell into the basement while watching the fire and a number of onlookers fainted or collapsed. The next day the chairman of the Philharmonic Society announced that the hall would certainly be rebuilt, saying that until then they would need to find a replacement hall in which to play. The hall contained a number of autograph books dating from 1848; these were contained in a fire-proof safe and thus kept safe along with autographed pictures and some instruments, though the music library was lost. The building was insured, and the insurers paid £84,000 (equivalent to £ in [...] ) for the hall itself, £9,503 (equivalent to £ in [...] ) <b>for</b> <b>other</b> <b>assets,</b> and £6,000 (equivalent to £ in [...] ) for the loss of two years' rental.

It has been argued that this debt represented a huge institutional failure by the government, significantly slowing growth in the Industrial Revolution period by crowding out private investment.

The reason the government could issue so much debt without raising rates of return is unclear. One possibility is that crowding out was occurring, but population growth in 1770 1839 was reducing rental income as a fraction of GDP, creating a demand <b>for</b> <b>other</b> <b>asset</b> income so that we do not observe tightness in capital markets. ...|$|R
