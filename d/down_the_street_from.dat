60|$|It {{all seemed}} like a dream. The woman dared not open her eyes lest reality--hideous and brutal--once more confronted her.

[...] The Stork Club first opened in 1929 at 132 West 58th Street, just <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>from</b> Billingsley's apartment at 152 West 58th Street. Billingsley's handwritten recollections of the early days recall that he was approached by two gamblers he knew from Oklahoma in his New York real estate office, proposing to open a restaurant together, which he accepted. The origin of the name of the club is unknown; Billingsley once remarked, [...] "Don't ask me how or why I picked the name, because I just don't remember." [...] New York City's El Morocco had the sophistication and Toots Shor's drew the sporting crowd, but the Stork Club mixed power, money, and glamor. [...] Unlike its competitors, the Stork stayed open on Sunday nights and during the summer months.|$|E

40|$|With {{the recent}} surge in viral videos {{worldwide}} featuring women with candid cameras walking <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> <b>from</b> New York to Casablanca, street harassment has grabbed {{the attention of}} international media outlets, audiences and governments alike. At the same time, digital technologies and online activist platforms have been harnessed by social movements worldwide to mobilize communities and inspire action, such as Twitter campaigns during the Arab Spring or Facebook-based activism during the Egyptian revolution. In this thesis, I ask: What factors influence street harassment interactions and how can online platforms map these interactions and impact gendered and heterosexist public spaces in Amsterdam? I hypothesize that street harassment is a normalized gendered and heterosexist practice, where men harass individuals they perceive as women, and that digital and online technologies {{have the potential to}} expose these interactions as heterosexist and to mobilize quick, collective and widespread forms of resistance. Through analysis of a survey conducted in Amsterdam in January and February 2015, as well as data from online posts to <b>the</b> international anti- <b>street</b> harassment platform Hollaback!, this thesis aims to intervene at <b>the</b> intersection of <b>street</b> harassment and technology, to contribute to dominant street harassment discourse, and to address wider feminist concerns with heterosexism to show how such heterosexist systems of power are manifested in public spaces...|$|R

'St. Paul Missionary Baptist Church Blues' {{focuses on}} the {{decaying}} value of a real life abandoned church in Grand Rapids and how that was a striking contrast to the popularity of other churches. 'Edit Your Hometown', {{has been described as}} [...] "treading the boundary between melodrama and actual drama" [...] by Ben Patashnik of 'Rock Sound'. 'The Most Beautiful Bitter Fruit' deals with the hypothetical author's sexuality, by exploring and questioning his inability to participate in casual sex. 'King Park', a seven-minute ballad, focuses on inner-city gang culture and follows the perspective of an individual who is engrossed by a drive-by shooting; and also follows how the drive by shooter, plagued by guilt, commits suicide. Dreyer described the true story behind the song: [...] "A year or two ago, <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>from</b> where Brad and I work, a kid was shot. It's an area that's been riddled with gang violence, which has been really sad to witness." [...] 'Edward Benz, 27 Times' {{is the story of a}} father dealing with the pain of being brutally attacked by his schizophrenic son, while [...] "I See Everything" [...] describes parents losing their seven-year-old son to cancer.|$|E
