40|$|It {{has been}} shown that <b>heterocaryon</b> {{formation}} between certain biochemical mutants of Neurospora crassa is controlled by a number of genes apart from the biochemical mutant genes concerned. Genetic control of heterocaryosis {{has been shown}} for several different combinations of mutants. A detailed investigation of the <b>heterocaryon</b> formed between a mutant requiring pantothenic acid and one requiring lysine has demonstrated four and possibly five genes to be concerned in the process of <b>heterocaryon</b> formation. These genes may not only prevent the formation of a <b>heterocaryon</b> but also modify the type of heterocaryotic growth. The characters so affected are the time at which heterocaryotic growth commences, the ability to maintain heterocaryotic growth and the vigor of the growth. The possible mode of action of such genes has been discussed...|$|E

A lot of protoplasts could be isolated rapidly from some materials, which had not been done before. Tomato protoplasts fused for less than five minutes at ca. 30 ℃ by means of PEG treatments, and the process of these phenomena was successively chased by photographs. Protoplasts from the tobacco culture cells and the mesophyll cells of Erigeron annuus L. were fused under PEG solutions and they formed <b>heterocaryon.</b> These fused protoplasts (<b>heterocaryon</b> in green and non-green colour mixtures) are clearly distinguished from homocaryon arisen as the results that the same kind of protoplasts fused each other...|$|E
40|$|Genetic and {{complementation}} mapping {{studies using}} 20 qa- 2 mutants defective for catabolic dehydroquinase {{indicate that the}} qa- 2 gene encodes a single polypeptide chain and is the structural gene for catabolic dehydroquinase, a 220, 000 -molecular-weight protein composed of identical 10, 000 -molecular-weight subunits. Many qa- 2 mutants are capable of reversion, but no evidence has yet been obtained for nonsense mutations in this gene. The biochemical consequences of the mutations in two complementing qa- 2 strains (M 239 and M 204) have been determined. Both mutants have extremely low levels of catalytic activity and form a <b>heterocaryon</b> with about 4 % of the wild-type activity. As assayed by immunological cross-reactivity, mutant M 239 and the <b>heterocaryon</b> have nearly wild-type levels of native-molecular-weight catabolic dehydroquinase protein, whereas M 204 has no detectable amount of this protein. Thus it is concluded that M 239 has a mutation {{at or near the}} catalytic site which reduces the activity 10, 000 -fold but has little or no influence on the formation of the native multimeric structure. In contrast, M 204 apparently has a mutation that severely inhibits aggregation and may have only a minor effect on the inherent potential for catalytic conversion at the reactive site. The <b>heterocaryon</b> would appear to form a mixed multimer with the monomeric subunits from M 239 providing the aggregated structure and those from M 204, the catalytically active moiety...|$|E

40|$|SUZMMARY: The {{basis of}} {{variation}} in morphological appearance of first cultures of Fusarium oxysporum f. gZadioZi, isolated from diseased roots and corms of prematurely yellowed Gladiolus plants, was investigated. The occurrence of mutations {{is considered to be}} far too infrequent to account for the wide range of variability of the fungus in culture, and the existence of <b>heterocaryons</b> of mixed morphologically distinct genotypes is considered. Cytological studies show that each microconidium contains one nucleus which is derived by mitosis from the single nucleus of the conidiophore. Hyphal tip cells contain an average of seven nuclei whilst the cells behind, in the older parts of the hyphae, contain only one nucleus each or, more rarely, two. Anastomoses between germ tubes from conidia of different morphological variants occur very frequently and may provide a means whereby <b>heterocaryons</b> are formed. Synthesis of heterocaryotic cultures is achieved by simultaneous inoculation of plates containing plain water agar medium. Hyphal tips were separately removed from the mixed colonies thus produced and analysed by single-sporing the resultin...|$|R
40|$|A new {{screening}} {{technique has}} been developed for the rapid identification of Neurospora crassa mutants that are deficient in nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide glycohydrolase (NADase) and {{nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate}} glycohydrolase (NADPase) activities. Using this procedure, five single-gene mutants were isolated whose singular difference from wild type appeared to be the absence of NAD(P) ase (EC 3. 2. 2. 6). All five mutants were found to be genetically allelic and did not complement in <b>heterocaryons.</b> This gene, nada [NAD(P) ase], was localized in linkage group IV. One of the nada alleles was found to specify an enzyme that was critically temperature sensitive and had altered substrate affinity. Mutations at the nada locus did not affect the genetic program for the expression of NAD(P) ase during cell differentiation, nor did they have a general effect on NAD catabolism. Nada mutations did not have simultaneous effects on other glycohydrolase activities. Tests of dominance (in <b>heterocaryons)</b> and in vitro mixing experiments did not provide evidence that nada mutations alter activators or inhibitors of NAD(P) ase. Thus, the nada gene appears to specify only the structure of N. crassa NAD(P) ase...|$|R

40|$|A mutant {{strain of}} Neurospora which {{requires}} sulfonamides for growth at 35 ° frequently becomes altered {{so that it}} can grow at that temperature without sulfonamides. (1) In each instance analyzed, the developed ability to grow without sulfonamides has resulted from mutation of genes distinct from that responsible for the sulfonamide requirement. Each "reverted" strain {{has proved to be a}} <b>heterocaryon,</b> composed of two kinds of nuclei, both of which carry the gene (sfo) for sulfonamide requirement, but one also carries a new "supressor" gene. At least two independent supressor genes have been involved in such reversions. Homocaryotic strains have been isolated, some carrying both sfo and the supressor, others carrying the supressor alone. None of these isolates has the growth characteristics of wild type, but each shows some peculiar relationship to the p-aminobenzoic acid requirement, the nature of which is still obscure. In a few instances, artifically constructed heterocaryons between the sulfonamide-requiring strain and a strain carrying both the sulfonamide-requiring gene and a supressor have resulted in better growth on minimal medium than either strain is capable of by itself, thus reconstituting the situation observed in the original "reverted" heterocaryons...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY: An {{investigation}} of {{the rate of increase}} of spontaneous mutants and the subsequent increase in mutant proportion in a bacterial culture revealed dis-crepancies between the observed results and those expected on the assumption that mutant and parent grew with equal rates. These discrepancies could not be accounted for in terms of a selective difference between established mutants and their parents since, when the two were mixed together in reconstruction experiments, they fared equally well for hundreds of generations. Rather the discrepancies indicated a difference between parents and new mutants. The data were consistent with the hypothesis that the mutation occurred independently among one of four mutable units (nuclei) and that the mutant nucleus was ‘dominant ’ over its sister non-mutant nuclei in the <b>heterocaryon</b> so formed. As a consequence, a delay of two generations ensued before the mutant unit segregated into the homocaryotic ancestor of a mutant clone. This process delayed the onset of an increase in mutant numbers after mutation.

40|$|Two morphologically {{distinctive}} {{slow growing}} strains of Neurospora crassa have been isolated and studied. These, abn- 1 and abn- 2, differ from wild type in that their growth rates are greatly reduced and often irregular, aerial hyphae are absent, conidia are extremely rare, and no protoperithecia are formed. Growth was not improved by addition of any nutrients tested, oxygen consumption {{was similar to}} that of wild type, and cytochrome c appeared abnormally high, and b low or absent. Both abn strains gave rise only to normal progeny in crosses with normal strains. The abn characteristics appear in <b>heterocaryons,</b> and have been transmitted to other genetic strains by means of heterocaryosis followed by plating of conidia. Conidia formed by such <b>heterocaryons</b> typically showed low viability, and gave rise to cultures with great variability in growth rate, morphology, and survival. Even apparently normal derived cultures often later became abnormal or died. It is concluded that the abnormal characteristics are determined primarily by cytoplasmic factors. This conclusion was strengthened by the transmission of the typical characteristics to normal strains by microinjection of cytoplasm from abn cultures, even without demonstrable transfer of nuclei. This constitutes the first time microinjection techniques have been successfully applied to the analysis of a cytoplasmic character in Neurospora...|$|R
40|$|In Neurospora crassa, {{evidence}} {{has recently been}} obtained for a cluster of four closely-linked genes controlling the inducible enzymes catalyzing the first three reactions in the catabolism of quinic acid. Three of these genes {{appear to be the}} structural genes for the three enzymes. The fourth gene, designated qa- 1, has been interpreted as having a regulatory function, since qa- 1 mutants are pleiotropic types, are noninducible for the three enzymes, and form <b>heterocaryons</b> which complement mutants in the structural genes. The present studies were undertaken to elucidate further the nature of the regulatory role of the qa- 1 locus. A number of constitutive (qa- 1 C) mutants have been obtained from certain qa- 1 mutants as revertants selected for their ability to grow on quinic acid as a sole source of carbon. These qa- 1 C mutants produce high levels of all three enzymes {{in the absence of an}} inducer, map within (or very close to) the qa- 1 locus, and produce a catabolic dehydroquinase (EC 4. 2. 1. 10) which is indistinguishable, on the basis of thermolability tests, from that of wild type. In addition, when grown in the absence of an inducer, <b>heterocaryons</b> between wild-type (qa- 1 +) and different qa- 1 C mutants exhibit markedly different levels of constitutivity (from 5 to 50 % of the particular parental qa- 1 C mutant) for catabolic dehydroquinase, one of the enzymes under qa- 1 control. These overall results are interpreted as supporting the hypothesis that the qa- 1 + gene product (presumably a multimeric protein) plays only a positive regulatory role in initiating synthesis of the three quinate catabolic enzymes...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY: Histidine-independent (h+) mutants induced in histidine-requiring (h-) {{cultures}} by {{ultraviolet light}} have {{a delay in}} the onset of logarithmic increase that is about two generations longer than the delay shown by marked unirradiated. h+ bacteria present a t the same time. This extra delay is interpreted as being due to the segregation of one from four nuclei which are present, on the average, in growing h- organisms. The same assumption accounts for the extra delay observed in spon-taneous h+ mutahts. These and other results are discussed {{in relation to the}} site of mutation and to the various types of delay that can retard the onset of growth of a mutant clone. It is concluded that in the mutation from h- to h+, the h+ condition is dominant in the <b>heterocaryon,</b> that whatever phenotypic delay exists is short, and that cell division is not required to pass through it.

40|$|SUMMARY: Two {{strains of}} Neurospora crassa, which require a-amino {{nitrogen}} for growth {{as a result}} of a single gene mutation (am), lack glutamic dehydrogenase. Extracts of mutant mycelium contained no detectable enzyme, although as little as 0. 2 yo of the amount normally present in the wild type should have been detectable in some experiments. Mutant extracts contained no detectable enzyme inhibitor. A balanced <b>heterocaryon</b> containing am nuclei and nuclei carrying an unrelated mutation produced less enzyme than did wild type mycelium, but there was no indication that the am nuclei were suppressing the activity of the non-am nuclei in promoting enzyme production. The production of the enzyme by the wild type was not strikingly dependent on conditions of growth although the addition of glutamate to the medium seemed somewhat to depress the enzyme concentration. This effect was more marked when glutamate was supplied as a sole nitrogen source. The mutation had little or no effect on the concentrations of two other dehydrogenases or of several transaminases, all related to glutamic dehydrogenase in their substrate specificities.

This study examines reversion in a mutant stock and the genetic behavior of serine-independent cultures derived from that reversion. Individually isolated ascospores of the mutant, {{as well as}} subcultures of individual progeny, exhibited spontaneous reversion frequencies ranging from 8 X 10 - 7 to 3. 7 x 10 - 2. The great variability in reversion frequency and variability in both mutant and revertant colony size were notable properties. All revertants tested demonstrated qualitatively similar growth characteristics and identical genetic behavior. Three revertants were studied genetically. Revertant # 9 had behaved in earlier crosses {{as if it were}} a <b>heterocaryon.</b> In this study, heterocaryosis was verified and the revertant was reisolated and crossed to wild-type. Newly isolated revertants 116 Rl and 123 R 6 were made homocaryotic by backcrossing to a mutant stock; they were then outcrossed to wild-type. No serine-requiring progeny were isolated from all spores examined for the crosses of the revertants to wild-type. These results indicated that the reversion of ser (JBM 4 - 13) involves either back mutation or a closely linked suppressor. The behavior of ser (JBM 4 - 13) is examined in the light of several models proposed to account for genetic instability in Neurospora and other organisms...|$|E

40|$|Two {{molecular}} species of repressible extracellular phosphodiesterases showing cyclic 2 ', 3 '- and cyclic 3 ', 5 '-nucleotide phosphodiesterase activities were detected in mycelial culture media of wild-type Neurospora crassa and purified. The two {{molecular species}} {{were found to}} be monomeric and polymeric forms of an enzyme constituted of identical subunits having molecular weights of 50, 000. This enzyme had the same electrophoretic mobility as repressible acid phosphatase. The enzyme designated repressible cyclic phosphodiesterase showed pH optima of 3. 2 to 4. 0 with a cyclic 3 ', 5 '-AMP substrate and 5. 0 to 5. 6 with a cyclic 2 ', 3 '-AMP substrate. Repressible cyclic phosphodiesterase was activated by MnCl 2 and CoCl 2 with cyclic 2 ', 3 '-AMP as substrate and was slightly activated by MnCl 2 with cyclic 3 ', 5 '-AMP.

40|$|Mutants of Aspergillus nidulans {{resistant}} to methylammonium toxicity are simultaneously derepressed {{in the presence}} of ammonium for apparently all ammonium-repressible activities. Enzyme assays directly demonstrate derepression of nitrate, nitrite, and hydroxylamine reductases, xanthine dehydrogenase, urate oxidase, and allantoinase, whereas in vivo tests show that ammonium and methylammonium repression or inhibition (or both) is relieved in these mutants in pathways of nitrate assimilation, purine transport and degradation, and amino acid, amine, and amide catabolism. Ammonium and methylammonium uptake is apparently not defective in these mutants, for they grow normally on limiting levels of these ions as sole nitrogen source. There is no evidence that more than one gene can mutate to produce the methylammonium resistance (meaR) phenotype. Such mutations are semidominant in both heterocaryons and diploids. The ability of meaR mutations to effect derepression of activities specified by genes within another nucleus in a <b>heterocaryon</b> shows that the action of the mea product is not restricted to the nucleus. Three types of hypotheses might explain this generalized derepression. First, ammonium and methylammonium might not themselves be co-repressors but might require a metabolic conversion, blocked in these mutants, to become co-repressors. Secondly, the mea locus might specify an activity expressed in meaR but not wild-type (meaS) strains, which diminishes the concentration of ammonium and methylammonium participating in co-repression. Finally, ammonium repression might involve a macromolecular control element specified by the meaR locus and common to many or all ammonium-repressible systems. The existence of “regulation reversal mutations” at the meaR locus and the lack of uniformity and coordination with which different enzymatic activities respond to mutational derepression is most compatible with the last type of hypothesis...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY: A {{method for}} the 40 -fold {{purification}} of glutamic dehydrogenase from Neurospora crassa is described, Strains which are homocaryotic for the alleles am 1, ama or am 3 produce no detectable glutamic dehydrogenase, but heterocaryons of com-position am 1 + am 2 or am 1 + am 3 do possess the enzyme activity. Extracts of am 1 + am 2 mycelia have lo%, or rather less, of typical wild-type activity when assayed at about 20 ". Enzyme preparations from a d + am 2 are distinguished from wild-type preparations in: (a) their capacity for thermal activation {{as the temperature}} is raised between 20 " and 35 "; (b) their low stability at 60 '. Extracts of aml+ama mycelia show 20 - 25 yo of typical wild-type activity. Enzyme preparations from am 1 + am 3 are distinguished from wild-type in their lower affinity for glutamate, and they tend also to be more thermolabile than wild-type enzyme, though less so than am 1 + am 2 preparations. Experiments on mixed enzymes showed no evidence for any effect of either kind of <b>heterocaryon</b> preparation on the properties of wild-type enzyme, or vice versa. It thus {{seems likely that the}} effects observed are due to differences in the enzyme molecules themselves. The significance of these observa-tions for theories on the mechanism of inter-allele complementation is discussed. When a series of different mutations all result in a deficiency in the same enzyme, and all fall within the same very short chromosome segment, they may reasonably be considered as belonging to the same genetic locus (Fincham, 1959).

40|$|During {{the present}} study the {{significance}} of the histone variant Htz 1 presence was studied at the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae model gene GAL 1. It was established that the Htz 1 nucleosomes are important for the recruitment of the Mediator complex during transcription initiation, providing an explanation of the positive role of this histone during transcription. Unexpectedly, the incorporation of the variant in a specific promoter nucleosome was found to depend on the corepressor Tup 1 -Ssn 6. This finding suggests that gene-specific regulators might control the incorporation of Htz 1 throughout promoters. Furthermore, it was established that this deposition takes place after the formation of canonical nucleosomes during promoter inactivation, regulated in part by Ssn 6 -Tup 1. It is proposed that in this way the corepressor secures a rapid second activation. The fact that this incorporation was suggested by others to regulate the attachment of the GAL genes at the nuclear periphery and thus the phenomenon of transcriptional memory of the GAL genes, led to the examination of the role of Htz 1 on both of these processes. It is concluded that Htz 1 is not required for the retention at the periphery. Moreover, the enhanced affinity of the GAL genes for the nuclear pores was seen to be unnecessary for optimal transcription. On the other hand, this recruitment to the periphery, while taking place in a major population of nuclei, proved to be independent of transcription itself. Thus, it is proposed that this phenomenon is an escorting event but is not regulated by nor regulates transcription. Finally, histone variant Ζtz 1 is not the determining factor of the transcriptional memory phenomenon. Employing a yeast <b>heterocaryon</b> assay is demonstrated that this phenomenon has no nuclear basis and Htz 1 is not the determining factor.
