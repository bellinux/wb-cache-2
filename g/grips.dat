Members of the West African genus Nimbaphrynoides are unique among frogs in that they are viviparous; Limnonectes larvaepartus, Eleutherodactylus jasperi and members of the Tanzanian genus Nectophrynoides are the only frogs known to be ovoviviparous. In these species, fertilization is internal and females give birth to fully developed juvenile frogs, except L. larvaepartus, which give birth to tadpoles.|$|E

40|$|The {{molecular}} mechanisms {{underlying the}} targeting and localization of glutamate receptors at postsynaptic sites is poorly understood. Recently, {{we have identified}} a PDZ domaincontaining protein, glutamate receptor-interacting protein 1 (<b>GRIP</b> 1), which specifically binds to the C termini of AMPA receptor subunits and {{may be involved in}} the synaptic targeting of these receptors. Here, we report the cloning of <b>GRIP</b> 2, a homolog of <b>GRIP</b> 1, and the characterization of the <b>GRIP</b> 1 and <b>GRIP</b> 2 proteins in the rat CNS. <b>GRIP</b> 1 and <b>GRIP</b> 2 are � 130 kDa proteins that are highly enriched in brain. <b>GRIP</b> 1 and <b>GRIP</b> 2 are widely expressed in brain, with the highest levels found in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and olfactory bulb. Biochemical studies show that <b>GRIP</b> 1 and <b>GRIP</b> 2 are enriched in synaptic plasma membrane and postsynaptic density fractions. <b>GRIP</b> 1 is expressed early in embryonic development before the expression of AMPA receptors and peaks in expression at postnatal day 8 – 10. In contrast, <b>GRIP</b> 2 is expressed relatively late in development and parallels the expression of AMPA receptors. Immunohistochemistry using the <b>GRIP</b> 1 antibodies demonstrated that <b>GRIP</b> 1 is expressed in neurons in a somatodendritic staining pattern. At the ultrastructural level, DAB and immunogold electromicroscopy studies showed that <b>GRIP</b> 1 was enriched in dendritic spines near the postsynaptic density and was expressed in dendritic shafts and in peri-Golgi regions in the neuronal soma. <b>GRIP</b> 1 appeared to be clustered at both glutamatergic and GABAergic synapses. These results suggest that <b>GRIP</b> 1 and <b>GRIP</b> 2 are AMPA receptor binding proteins potentially involved in the targeting of AMPA receptors to synapses. <b>GRIP</b> 1 also may play functional roles at both excitatory and inhibitory synapses, as well as in early neuronal development...|$|R

5|$|Despite {{not having}} a sting, the {{porcupine}} ray is capable of injuring humans with its many sharp thorns. It is reportedly bold and tolerant of being approached closely underwater. The tough, thorny skin of this ray, made into a form of leather called shagreen, had many historical uses. In particular, {{it was used to}} cover the hilts of various melee weapons, as its extremely rough texture prevented slippage during battle. For example, the Japanese deemed it the only species whose skin was acceptable for covering sword <b>grips.</b> The Malayans used it to cover shields. The skin was also used ornamentally, such as by the Chinese, who dyed it and ground down the thorns to yield a mottled pattern. The native inhabitants of Funafuti Atoll used dried portions of the ray's tail as a rasp-like tool.|$|E
5|$|In the 1890s, List {{initially}} {{devised the}} idea that ancient German society had been led by a hierarchical system of initiates, the Armanenschaft, an idea which had developed into {{a key part of}} his thinking by 1908.

He claimed that the ancient brotherhood had consisted of three degrees, each with their own secret signs, <b>grips,</b> and passwords. He believed that the Armanenschaft had societal control over the ancient German people, acting as teachers, priests, and judges. In List's interpretation of history, the Christian missionaries persecuted the Armanenschaft, resulting in many fleeing northward into Scandinavia and Iceland.

Moreover, the influence of handedness on maximum <b>grip</b> force, and the relationship between maximum <b>grip</b> force and subjective difficulty were also investigated. Methods : Eleven subjects took part in the study.
