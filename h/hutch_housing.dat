40|$|Objective of {{the present}} study was to compare the {{responses}} of Holstein Friesian pre-weaned female calves confined in elevated metallic crates in closed-type of housing and polyvinyl hutches in an open environment of Kuwait. A total of 176 newborn Holstein Friesian female calves were randomly distributed to conventional confinement in closed-type calf houses (control) and individual calf hutch in open environment (treatment). These calves were monitored upto the weaning age of 90 days. The average daily live weight gain was significantly higher in calves housed in hutches than conventional housing system (413 versus 113 g/h/d; P≤ 0. 0001). Mean risk rates (RR) for mortality in hutch and conventional housing were 0. 017 and 0. 23, respectively. The results showed a significant positive impact of <b>hutch</b> <b>housing</b> with respect to growth, mortality and incidence of diseases in Kuwait’s intensive dairy farming syste...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} was carried out to {{investigate}} the effect of different type of calf hutches on growing performance and housing expenses of Holstein calves. Twenty five female calves born from February 2003 to April 2003 in Agricultural Faculty Farm, University of Cukurova, Adana, Turkey {{were used in the}} experiment. Birth weights for new material, Fiberglas and double layer tin-plate groups were 36. 61 � 1. 57, 36. 44 � 1. 19 and 34. 81 � 1. 70, respectively. The daily weight gain averages for the tint material, Fiberglas and double layer tin-plate groups were found 367. 68 � 31. 49, 319. 22 � 27. 69, 294. 43 � 21. 64 g d - 1, respectively. The differences between the groups were not statistically significant (P 0. 01). New type <b>hutch</b> <b>housing</b> compared to fiberglas or double layer tin-plate groups in respect to calf performances but housing expenses was the lowest group for new material hutch type...|$|E
5000|$|Swink and October stay at Hutch's, {{while the}} other two search Loomis' <b>house.</b> <b>Hutch</b> tells Abigail why he hates fire; {{when he was a}} boy, his jealous father set their house on fire. Unable to move, he had to watch as his mother was burned alive. After his father went to prison, Hutch lived with Loomis' family and knows one window is always left unlocked. Inside, they locate Loomis' {{cellphone}} and find the name Jonathan Malkus (James Haven), the creator of [...] "Stay Alive." [...] Swink gets the corresponding address. As King's murder hits the news, the police arrive at <b>Hutch's</b> <b>house.</b> October and Swink escape and rejoin the other two at Loomis'.|$|R
5000|$|Meanwhile, Hutch's young neighbor, Willis (Jeffrey Lorenzo), whom Hutch watches on Wednesdays, is {{involved}} in a bomb blast in <b>Hutch's</b> <b>house,</b> and breaks his leg (the bomb was intended for Hutch). Starsky comes to visit Willis in the hospital where a [...] "who's at fault" [...] argument with Hutch, finally leads to reconciliation. They both decide to go after Feldman {{and put an end to}} his drug business. With help from Huggy Bear, who grudingly acts as a golf caddie for Reese, they learn that Feldman plans to sell the drugs at a charity ball by hiding them in Volkswagen Karmann Ghias to be given away to preplanned dope pushers.|$|R

50|$|Gross died {{of cancer}} in 1992, aged 55, three days after his entry into the Seahawks Ring of Honor. The Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center created the Pete Gross House - a 69-unit housing complex that {{provides}} living space for families of patients undergoing treatment at the Center, in his memory. Pete Gross <b>House</b> also <b>houses</b> <b>Hutch</b> School, a fully accredited K-12 school for cancer patients and their siblings.|$|R
50|$|The beamline {{elements}} {{are located in}} radiation shielding enclosures, called hutches, which are {{the size of a}} small room (cabin). A typical beamline consists of two hutches, an optical hutch for the beam conditioning elements and an experimental <b>hutch,</b> which <b>houses</b> the experiment. Between hutches, the beam travels in a transport tube. Entrance to the hutches is forbidden when the beam shutter is open and radiation can enter the hutch. This is enforced by the use of elaborate safety systems with redundant interlocking functions, which make sure that no one is inside the hutch when the radiation is turned on. The safety system will also shut down the radiation beam if the door to the hutch is accidentally opened when the beam is on. In this case, the beam is dumped, meaning the stored beam is diverted into a target designed to absorb and contain its energy.|$|R
5000|$|Dynarski {{has also}} {{appeared}} in numerous television shows. He is one of 32 actors or actresses to have guest-starred in both the original Star Trek television series (episodes [...] "Mudd's Women" [...] and [...] "The Mark of Gideon") {{and in one of}} the series' spin offs (Star Trek: The Next Generations [...] "11001001"). In Monkees TV series, Dynarski played the Dragonman's sidekick, Toto, in the episode titled [...] "Monkee Chow Mein" [...] (original US air date: March 13, 1967). His many other TV credits include episodes of Batman (episodes 47 and 48), Starsky & <b>Hutch,</b> CHiPs, Little <b>House</b> on the Prairie and The A-Team. He is also known for his two appearances as Izzy Mandelbaum Jr. on Seinfeld. Dynarski appeared in the short Apple Jack (2003) as Helmut Jitters.|$|R
2500|$|Like other {{technology}} in Snow Crash, Rat Things are {{powered by a}} nuclear isotope battery, which requires extensive cooling due to the massive amount of waste heat generated. The Rat Things are passively cooled by a system of heat sinks that are only effective when the Rat Thing runs fast enough to move ambient air across the fins. To prevent rapid overheating when stationary, they must remain in their <b>hutches</b> (effectively dog <b>houses),</b> where they are continuously sprayed by jets of refrigerant. Through running, Rat Things are capable of breaking the sound barrier (about 768mph at sea level), although this is not typically permitted by Mr. Lee's Greater Hong Kong's [...] "good neighbor" [...] policies due to noise reasons. Because they must be either moving at high velocities or actively cooling in their hutches, Rat Things are rarely seen by human eyes and few people know what they look like.|$|R
40|$|Two {{studies were}} {{conducted}} to evaluate the biological effects of hutch covers in reducing heat and cold stress in individually housed dairy calves. The heat stress study was conducted on two farms, one in Arizona (AZ) {{and one in the}} Texas Panhandle (TX). Biological parameters were used to compare unweaned calves housed in reflectively covered hutches with calves in uncovered hutches. Average daily maximum temperature was 7. 78 ?C warmer (P 0. 05) weight gain or immune response to an IBR vaccination at either farm. Reflective hutch covers moderate internal hutch temperature to a degree that can affect biological function. Absence of persistent infected calves with BVD, and high antibody titers to IBR indicate the farms? vaccination and biosecurity practices against BVD and colostrum programs were successful. The cold stress study was conducted during two consecutive winters in the Texas Panhandle. Unweaned calves <b>housed</b> <b>hutches</b> covered with 2 different materials (reflective and non-reflective) were compared during two consecutive winters (Trial 1 and Trial 2). Average daily temperature minimums were colder (P 0. 05) during daylight hours (0800 - 2000). Hutch covers demonstrated heat-retaining abilities but did not have a conclusive effect on ADG. In conclusion, reflective hutch covers effectively moderate internal hutch temperature during sunny summer days, but not during winter...|$|R
