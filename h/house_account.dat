5000|$|On 3 March 2012, The CBDT of India froze {{many more}} Kingfisher {{accounts}} {{as it was}} unable to pay all the dues as per schedule. Kingfisher was meant to pay [...] per working day. It reportedly missed the deadline set by the board and could not pay the dues until the evening on 29 February. This led to more accounts being frozen. The airline neither did comment on the situation, nor pay the taxes. Aviation minister Ajit Singh warned the airline about the temporary suspension of the license until the crisis was sorted out. He announced {{that the rest of}} the airline's fleet would be grounded and all flights cancelled until the crisis came to an end. This would be only one step from permanently closing the airline. On 7 March 2012 IATA suspended ticket sales of Kingfisher Airlines citing non-payment of dues as the primary reason, and they said that sales services will only be restored once Kingfisher settles ICH (IATA Clearing <b>House)</b> <b>account.</b> IATA also immediately directed all travel agents to stop booking tickets for Kingfisher.

By the time Churchill's version appears, with the aid of hindsight after the holocaust, a rift based on clear-cut policy alternatives is discerned. On one side there is Chamberlain and his ageing sycophants bedazzled by a quest for 'peace in their time', conceived as a mission, therefore unthwartable and increasingly representing a position of weakness; on the other Eden, with harsher principles for dealing with truculent dictators, a martyr to a more resolute cause.
