5|$|Oscar Wilde {{lived in}} Grosvenor Square between 1883 and 1884 and {{referred}} to it in his works. He regularly socialised in the artistic quarter along Half Moon Street, which is mentioned in both The Importance of Being <b>Earnest</b> and The Portrait of Dorian Gray.|$|E
5|$|Other kings had {{inspired}} more respect, {{but perhaps}} only Henry VIII had endeared {{himself to the}} popular imagination as much as this one. He was the playboy monarch, naughty but nice, the hero of all who prized urbanity, tolerance, good humour, {{and the pursuit of}} pleasure above the more <b>earnest,</b> sober, or material virtues.|$|E

5|$|The Importance of Being <b>Earnest,</b> A Trivial Comedy for Serious People is a play by Oscar Wilde. First {{performed}} on 14 February 1895 at the St James's Theatre in London, it is a farcical comedy {{in which the}} protagonists maintain fictitious personæ to escape burdensome social obligations. Working within the social conventions of late Victorian London, the play's major themes are the triviality with which it treats institutions as serious as marriage, and the resulting satire of Victorian ways. Contemporary reviews all praised the play's humour, though some were cautious about its explicit lack of social messages, while others foresaw the modern consensus {{that it was the}} culmination of Wilde's artistic career so far. Its high farce and witty dialogue have helped make The Importance of Being <b>Earnest</b> Wilde's most enduringly popular play.|$|E
5|$|The neoclassical façade of King's, {{with the}} passage which connects the Strand to the Somerset House terrace has been {{utilised}} to reproduce the late Victorian Strand in the opening scenes of Oliver Parker's 2002 film The Importance of Being <b>Earnest.</b> The East Wing of King's appears, {{as a part of}} Somerset House, {{in a number of other}} productions, such as Wilde, Flyboys, and The Duchess.|$|E
5|$|Through August and September 1940 the Luftwaffe met the Dowding {{system in}} the Battle of Britain, {{and in spite of}} great effort, failed to defeat Fighter Command. Tizard's letter of 1936 proved prophetic; with their loss during the day, the Luftwaffe moved to a night campaign. The Blitz began in <b>earnest</b> in September.|$|E
5|$|With {{the loss}} of German toys on the American market during World War I, toy {{manufacturing}} in the United States began in <b>earnest.</b> The Great Depression was a temporary setback but WWII proved a catalyst. In {{the aftermath of the}} war, American couples were eager to settle down, have kids, and lavish the sumptuous Christmases they never had on their offspring.|$|E
5|$|After a few skirmishes, the {{opposing}} forces met in <b>earnest</b> at Edgehill, on 23 October 1642. Charles's nephew Prince Rupert of the Rhine {{disagreed with the}} battle strategy of the royalist commander Lord Lindsey, and Charles sided with Rupert. Lindsey resigned, leaving Charles to assume overall command assisted by Lord Forth. Rupert's cavalry successfully charged through the parliamentary ranks, but instead of swiftly returning to the field, rode off to plunder the parliamentary baggage train. Lindsey, acting as a colonel, was wounded and bled to death without medical attention. The battle ended inconclusively as the daylight faded.|$|E
5|$|Anna Mary Robertson Moses (September 7, 1860 – December 13, 1961), {{known by}} her {{nickname}} Grandma Moses, was an American folk artist. She began painting in <b>earnest</b> {{at the age}} of 78 and is often cited as an example of an individual who successfully began a career in the arts at an advanced age. Her works have been shown and sold in the United States and abroad and have been marketed on greeting cards and other merchandise. Moses' paintings are displayed in the collections of many museums. The Sugaring Off was sold for US $1.2 million in 2006.|$|E
5|$|Ant Island is {{a colony}} of ants led by the Queen and her daughter, Princess Atta. Every season, {{they are forced to}} give food to a gang of marauding {{grasshoppers}} led by Hopper. One day, when Flik, an individualist and would-be inventor, inadvertently knocks the offering into a stream with his latest invention, a grain harvesting device, Hopper demands twice as much food as compensation. When Flik suggests in <b>earnest</b> that they seek help from other stronger bugs, the other ants see it as an opportunity to remove him and send him off.|$|E
5|$|Around 1935, {{despite the}} Depression, a few breeders started to linebreed and inbreed cream-colored horses to fix their color and type. In particular, C.T. Rierson began buying cream-colored mares sired by Silver Lace and {{developing}} the American Cream breed in <b>earnest.</b> In 1944, a breed association, the American Cream Association, {{was formed by}} 20 owners and breeders and granted a corporate charter {{in the state of}} Iowa. In 1950, the breed was finally recognized by the Iowa Department of Agriculture, based on a 1948 recommendation by the National Stallion Enrollment Board.|$|E

5|$|As Rome's power waned, the Picts were emboldened. War bands raided {{south of}} Hadrian's Wall in <b>earnest</b> in 342, 360, and 365 and they participated with the Attacotti in the Great Conspiracy of 367. Rome fought back, {{mounting}} a campaign under CountTheodosius in 369 which reëstablished a province which was renamed Valentia {{in honor of}} the emperor. Its location is unclear, but it is sometimes placed on or beyond Hadrian's Wall. Another campaign was mounted in 384, but both were short-lived successes. Rome had fully withdrawn from Britain by 410, never to return.|$|E
5|$|During the Bangladesh Liberation War of 1971, Sitakunda {{was part}} of Sector 1, led by Ziaur Rahman and Major Rafiqul Islam of the Mukti Bahini, the forces {{fighting}} for the independence of Bangladesh.

As of 2007, Sitakunda had overtaken the ship breaking industries of India and Pakistan to become {{the largest in the}} world.|$|E
5|$|During {{the peace}} Jervis married his cousin Martha, {{daughter}} of Lord Chief Baron Sir Thomas Parker. Jervis was also returned as MP for Launceston in 1783. Jervis began {{his political career}} in <b>earnest</b> and voted for Pitt's parliamentary reforms and against Charles James Fox and his East India Bill. During the elections of 1784 Jervis stood for election in the independent borough of Great Yarmouth where he was returned as MP alongside Henry Beaufoy. Jervis then voted against Pitt's further bills for reform but supported him once more during the 1788–1799 Regency Crisis.|$|E
5|$|In 31, Sejanus {{held the}} consulship with Tiberius , and began his play for power in <b>earnest.</b> Precisely what {{happened}} is difficult to determine, but Sejanus seems to have covertly attempted to court those families who were tied to the Julians, and attempted to ingratiate himself with the Julian family line with an eye towards placing himself, as an adopted Julian, {{in the position of}} Princeps, or as a possible regent. Livilla was later implicated in this plot, and was revealed to have been Sejanus's lover for a number of years.|$|E
5|$|In mid-1877, Rimsky-Korsakov thought {{increasingly}} {{about the}} short story May Night by Nikolai Gogol. The story had long been a favorite of his, and his wife Nadezhda had encouraged him to write an opera based on it from the day of their betrothal, when they had read it together. While musical ideas for such a work predated 1877, now they came with greater persistence. By early 1878 the project took an increasing amount of his attention; in February he started writing in <b>earnest,</b> and he finished the opera by early November.|$|E
5|$|Initially, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) {{forecast}} that Odile would track westward {{and avoid}} land {{as it would}} curve out to sea. Accordingly, the local governments of southwestern Mexico initially posted minor weather alerts. Precautionary measures on the Baja California Peninsula began in <b>earnest</b> after Odile unexpectedly took a direct course towards the peninsula. Several municipalities {{declared a state of}} emergency, opening 164shelters with a total capacity of 30,000people. Due to the unanticipated threat of Odile, approximately 26,000foreign tourists were stranded on the peninsula at the time of landfall.|$|E
5|$|Laura and L. D. {{were taken}} to a bridge over the North Canadian River, six miles west and one mile south of Okemah. The bridge was {{described}} as on the old Schoolton road and at Yarbrough's crossing. According to the Associated Press and The Crisis, Laura was raped. The Ledger reported that the men gagged Laura and L. D. with tow sacks and, using rope made of half-inch hemp tied in a hangman's knot, hanged them from the bridge. They {{were found in the}} morning hanging 20ft below the middle span. A local resident, John <b>Earnest,</b> reported the discovery to the sheriff's office.|$|E
5|$|On 24 January the French {{ambassador}} {{was expelled}} {{in response to}} the execution of Louis XVI in Paris on 21 January and on 1 February the National Convention declared war on Great Britain. The naval campaign in the Atlantic began in <b>earnest</b> in March 1793, when a French battle squadron briefly put to sea before a mutiny forced it to return. The war between Britain and France begun in the Goulet on 2 January 1793 was to last, with a 14-month break in 1802–1803, until 1815.|$|E
5|$|Rebuilding work did {{not begin}} in <b>earnest</b> until 1863, when William Gibbs had the {{property}} substantially remodelled in a Gothic Revival style. William Cubitt & Co. were the builders and John Norton was the architect. Norton's design enveloped the original house. He added an extra floor, two new wings and towers. Norton emphasised the importance of architectural continuity in restoration and rebuilding relating to several historical periods. As a result, while some walls remained plain, others were adorned with Gothic and naturalistic carvings {{to fit in with}} the previous architectural styles.|$|E
5|$|Ship {{camouflage}} {{was used}} in <b>earnest</b> by the British Admiralty in the First World War. The marine artist Norman Wilkinson led research into dazzle camouflage, resulting in the painting of thousands of British and later American ships in dazzle patterns. He intended it not to make ships invisible, nor even to cause the enemy to miss his shot, but to deceive him into taking up a poor firing position. In the Second World War, dazzle was revisited by the Royal Navy and the United States Navy, and applied to a limited extent by other navies.|$|E
5|$|Stuart McGurk of GQ {{considers}} Adams' auburn hair, porcelain skin, upturned nose, and her soft, <b>earnest</b> speaking {{style to}} be among her trademarks. She was {{named one of the}} most beautiful people in America by Elle in 2011, and several publications have featured her red carpet appearances in their listings of best-dressed celebrities. Adams was made the face of Lacoste's fragrance named Eau de Lacoste in 2012, and two years later, she endorsed accessories and handbags of Max Mara. In 2015, the actress collaborated with Max Mara to design and promote a line of handbags.|$|E
5|$|The Rhodesian Bush War (or Second Chimurenga), {{which had}} been {{underway}} at a low level since before UDI, began in <b>earnest</b> in December 1972 when ZANLA attacked farms in north-eastern Rhodesia. The Rhodesian Security Forces mounted a strong counter-campaign {{over the next two}} years. Muzorewa re-engaged with Smith in August 1973, accepting the 1971–72 Douglas-Home terms, and the two signed a statement to that effect on 17 August. The UANC executive repudiated this in May 1974, but talks between Smith and Muzorewa continued sporadically. The RF again won a clean sweep of the 50 white seats in the July 1974 general election.|$|E
5|$|The use of {{anthropology}} in the forensic investigation of remains {{grew out of}} the recognition {{of anthropology}} as a distinct scientific discipline and the growth of physical anthropology. The field of anthropology began in the United States and struggled to obtain recognition as a legitimate science {{during the early years of}} the twentieth century. <b>Earnest</b> Hooton pioneered the field of physical anthropology and became the first physical anthropologist to hold a full-time teaching position in the United States. He was an organizing committee member of the American Association of Physical Anthropologists along with its founder Aleš Hrdlička. Hooton's students created some of the first doctoral programs in physical anthropology during the early 20th century. In addition to physical anthropology, Hooton was a proponent of criminal anthropology. Now considered a pseudoscience, criminal anthropologists believed that phrenology and physiognomy could link a person's behavior to specific physical characteristics. The use of criminal anthropology to try to explain certain criminal behaviors arose out of the eugenics movement, popular at the time. It is because of these ideas that skeletal differences were measured in <b>earnest</b> eventually leading to the development of anthropometry and the Bertillon method of skeletal measurement by Alphonse Bertillon. The study of this information helped shape anthropologists' understanding of the human skeleton and the multiple skeletal differences that can occur.|$|E
5|$|This {{episode was}} written by Glee co-creator Ian Brennan, who also made his directorial debut in this episode. While the first scenes for the episode were shot on March 30, 2012, on a day that also saw scenes shot for the {{previous}} two episodes, shooting on the episode began in <b>earnest</b> on Monday, April 9, 2012, {{after the completion of}} the prior episode {{at the end of the}} week before. Filming continued into the following week at least through Wednesday, April 18, 2012, by which point the next episode had begun shooting in parallel.|$|E
5|$|This {{was about}} to get worse, when France and the Low Countries fell in May to June 1940. U-boats could operate from French Atlantic ports, {{reducing}} their need to make the dangerous journey from ports in Norway or Germany around Scotland, and increasing their operational range in the ocean by several hundred miles. The Luftwaffe with its small, but valuable fleet of Focke-Wulf Fw 200 Condors, could now operate from the same area. From June 1940 onwards, the Battle of the Atlantic began in <b>earnest.</b>|$|E
5|$|Velites {{were first}} used, and created, at {{the siege of}} Capua in 211 BC, and were made up of {{citizens}} who would normally be too poor to join the hastati but were called up due a shortage of manpower. They were trained to ride on horseback with the equites and jump down at a given signal to fling javelins at the enemy. After the siege, they were adopted into the legions as a force of irregular light infantry for ambushing and harassing the enemy with javelins before the battle began in <b>earnest.</b>|$|E
