6000|$|<b>Did</b> <b>she</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> do that? <b>Did</b> <b>she</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> {{sell her}} pearl-backed brush and mirror, her silver candlestick, her pendant, her lovely little necklace, and go dressed in drab like the Wherrys: the unlovely uncombed Wherrys, {{who were the}} [...] "poor" [...] to her? She did not.|$|E
6000|$|Was Emma's mind {{disengaged}} {{enough for}} curiosity, or <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> quit the subject! She said--'You {{have had a}} trial of this kind yourself?' ...|$|E
6000|$|But <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> find Mr. Otter? She had {{inherited}} {{much of the}} old cutter's independence. How much better {{it would be if}} she could find work and support herself without calling on him for aid! ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Does</b> <b>she</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> get a husband.|$|R
6000|$|... "No; I don't {{think he}} <b>did.</b> <b>She</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> dance {{with him again}} bad enough, I know. Everybody does with Dick, because he's so {{handsome}} and such a clever courter." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No one you know. But {{she used}} to go about with her brows knit trying not <b>to</b> <b>do</b> {{whatever}} <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> do--if ever <b>she</b> <b>did</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> do anything--" ...|$|R
6000|$|On Saturday morning Soames {{had found}} her at her writing-table with a note written to Swithin, putting him off. Why <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> put him off? he asked. She might put her own people off when she liked, {{he would not have}} her putting off his people! ...|$|E
60|$|Why had {{she left}} Sabbath-school? Why? Oh, yes. What did he (McSnagley) {{want to tell}} her she was wicked for? What did he tell her that God hated her for? If God hated her, what <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> go to Sabbath school for? She didn't want to be beholden to anybody who hated her.|$|E
60|$|Freddie, too, was in trouble. But <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> comfort Freddie? No. On the contrary, she {{was already}} regretting her promise, so lightly given before luncheon, to go and sit with him that afternoon. A well-marked feeling of {{annoyance}} {{that he should have}} been so silly as to tumble downstairs and sprain his ankle was her chief sentiment respecting Freddie.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] said Herr Paul {{raising his}} brows till his glasses fell from his nose: [...] "And what says Gretchen? <b>Does</b> <b>she</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> be handed up to posterities a little peacock {{along with the}} other little birds?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{know about}} loving her dearly. They were intimate, and Mrs. Finn {{used to be}} with her very much {{when she was in the}} country. She was at Matching just now, when my poor mother died. Why <b>does</b> <b>she</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> see you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{stopped a}} moment {{and looked at his}} {{companion}} steadily. [...] "It's rather a curious thing that, when I suggested she might like a run over to Barrock-holme, <b>she</b> didn't seem <b>to</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> go. And there's another point that's puzzling me. When I mention the crescent or the pearls, why <b>does</b> <b>she</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> change the subject?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She hasn't bitten you, has she? Oh, {{they do it}} sometimes! What lies has {{she been}} telling you of me? Oh, they lie in the most abominable manner! What? She has been talking of me in the kindest terms? Then why <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> {{get out of my}} hearing? Ah, they're so infernally deceitful! I do hate mad people." ...|$|E
6000|$|There {{could be}} only one meaning. He had come to ask for her. And, suddenly, she took comfort. Better so; {{there would be no}} more secrecy from Dad! And he would stand between her and Fiorsen if--if she decided not to marry him. The thought {{staggered}} her. Had she, without knowing it, got so far as this? Yes, and further. It was all no good; Fiorsen would never accept refusal, even if she gave it! But, <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> refuse? ...|$|E
6000|$|Swithin {{looked at}} Rozsi--her eyes were bright, her lips tremulous. He slipped his {{hand along the}} table and touched her fingers. Then she flashed a look at him--appeal, reproach, tenderness, all were {{expressed}} in it. Was she expecting him to dance? <b>Did</b> <b>she</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> mix with the rift-raff there; wish him to make an exhibition of himself in this hurly-burly? A voice said, [...] "Good-evening!" [...] Before them stood Kasteliz, in a dark coat tightly buttoned at the waist.|$|E
6000|$|... "Because the Bent {{baby has}} got it, {{and the whole}} hotel is upside down in consequence. The Waddy has 'set her five young on the rail' and fled. The Dancing Master fears for his {{precious}} throat, and that miserable little woman, his wife, has no notion of what ought <b>to</b> be <b>done.</b> <b>She</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> {{put it into a}} mustard bath--for croup!" ...|$|R
60|$|A {{quick change}} came over her. She mistrusted herself, she mistrusted the outer world. <b>She</b> <b>did</b> not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> go on, <b>she</b> <b>did</b> not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> {{go out into}} it, <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> go no further.|$|R
50|$|Cassie doesn't {{know what}} is going on and she can't {{understand}} why her mother would do something like that to her friend. Feeling guilty for what her mother <b>did,</b> <b>she</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> help Heather by undoing the spell. Adam agrees to help her, after Cassie is telling him that she found her mom's Book of Shadows and there is a spell they can use.|$|R
60|$|The first {{excitement}} having worn itself out, {{a perfect}} volley of questions followed. What was the lady's name? Where did she live? How had {{she got the}} necklace? Had it been given to her? and, if so, who had given it? Where had it been made? Why had she {{brought it to the}} Judengasse? <b>Did</b> <b>she</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> sell it? or to borrow money on it? Aha! To borrow money on it. Very good, very good indeed; but--and then the detestable invitation to produce the reference made itself heard once more.|$|E
6000|$|A {{little before}} five o'clock, {{the hour of}} dismissal, Madame Beck sent for me to her chamber, to read over and {{translate}} some English letter she had received, and to write for her the answer. Before settling to this work, I observed that she softly closed the two doors of her chamber; she even shut and fastened the casement, {{though it was a}} hot day, and free circulation of air was usually regarded by her as indispensable. Why this precaution? A keen suspicion, an almost fierce distrust, suggested such question. <b>Did</b> <b>she</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> exclude sound? what sound? ...|$|E
60|$|As I {{lay awake}} and thought, the idea flashed across me suddenly, could Jane have any grudge {{of her own}} against Aunt Emma? Was this a {{deliberate}} plot? What did she mean by her warnings that I should keep my mind open? Why had she said {{from the very first}} it was a woman's hand? <b>Did</b> <b>she</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> set me against my aunt? And was Dr. Marten in league with her? In my tortured frame of mind, I felt all alone in the world. I covered my head and sobbed in my misery. I didn't know who were my friends and who were against me.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Because the Bent {{baby has}} got it, {{and the whole}} hotel is upside down in consequence. The Waddy has [...] "set her five young on the rail" [...] and fled. The Dancing Master fears for his {{precious}} throat, and that miserable little woman, his wife, has no notion of what ought <b>to</b> be <b>done.</b> <b>She</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> {{put it into a}} mustard bath for croup!' ...|$|R
60|$|Elizabeth, on her side, {{had much}} <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> <b>She</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> {{ascertain}} {{the feelings of}} each of her visitors; <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> compose her own, and to make herself agreeable to all; and in the latter object, where she feared most to fail, she was most sure of success, for those to whom she endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour. Bingley was ready, Georgiana was eager, and Darcy determined, to be pleased.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh, yes! Of {{course she}} was a little--well, a little wild {{when she was a}} girl, but I've forgiven that. It's her father won't forgive her. He always was a hard man, and he never loved her as I <b>did.</b> <b>She</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> come and stay with me, but he won't let her. Isn't it cruel of him? I should so like to have Lady Ously-Farrowham down here.' ...|$|R
6000|$|This {{struck him}} {{immediately}} {{as a further}} restriction of his visit: she wouldn't readmit him to the drawing-room or to her boudoir; she would receive him in the impersonal apartment downstairs where she saw people on business. What <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> do to him? He was prepared by this time for a scene of jealousy, since {{he was sure he}} had learned to read her character justly in feeling that if she had the appearance of a cold woman a forked flame in her was liable on occasion to break out. She was very still, but from time to time she would fire off a pistol. As soon as he had closed the door she said without sitting down: ...|$|E
6000|$|I found them; and accosting one, I {{asked if}} she knew of the persons I had just left. She replied, that she did not; nor <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>want</b> <b>to.</b> I then asked another, a miserable, toothless old woman, with a tattered strip of coarse baling stuff round her body. Looking at me for an instant, she resumed her raking in the rubbish, {{and said that she}} knew who it was that I spoke of; but that she had no time to attend to beggars and their brats. Accosting still another, who seemed to know my errand, I asked if there was no place to which the woman could be taken. [...] "Yes," [...] she replied, [...] "to the church-yard." [...] I said she was alive, and not dead.|$|E
60|$|Miss Trotter felt {{a sudden}} thrill. The {{recollection}} of Dr. Duchesne's strange scrutiny of her, of her own mistake, which she now knew {{might have been the}} truth--flashed across her confused consciousness in swift corroboration of his words. It was a DOUBLE revelation to her; for what else was the meaning of this subtle, insidious, benumbing sweetness that was now creeping over her sense and spirit and holding her fast. She felt she ought to listen no longer--to speak--to say something--to get up--to turn and confront him coldly--but she was powerless. Her reason told her that she had been the victim of a trick--that having deceived her once, he might be doing so again; but she could not break the spell that was upon her, nor <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>want</b> <b>to.</b> She must know the culmination of this confession, whose preamble thrilled her so strangely.|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{does your}} mother <b>do</b> when <b>she</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> you justice?" [...] Rowland asked, observing the admirable {{line of the}} young girl's neck.|$|R
5000|$|Häxan Surtant {{has nothing}} <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> <b>She</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> work but hates mates, so she works alone for {{herself in her}} newly founded company (Aktiebolaget Häxan Surtant or [...] "The Häxan Surtant Joint-stock company") without knowing just what the company should <b>do.</b> Everyday, <b>she</b> {{arranges}} something for the display window, although as she waits in the shop she hopes {{that no one will}} enter. Nevertheless, without reason, she puts a pizza box in the shop window.|$|R
6000|$|... "How much <b>does</b> <b>she</b> <b>want</b> you <b>to</b> have?" [...] I asked, laughing. [...] "She {{ought to}} fix the sum, so that I may stay till it's made up." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "In other words," [...] said Staniford, after Dunham had {{reported}} the whole case to him, [...] "she treated your hurt vanity {{as if you}} had been her pet schoolboy. She lured you away from yourself, and got you to talking and thinking of other things. Lurella is deep, I tell you. What consummate tacticians the least of women are! It's a pity that they have to work so often in such dull material as men; they ought always to have women to operate on. The youngest of them has more wisdom in human nature than the sages of our sex. I must say, Lurella is magnanimous, too. She might have taken her revenge on you for pitying her yesterday when she sat in that warehouse door on the wharf. It was rather fine in Lurella not to do it. What did she say, Dunham? What did she talk about? <b>Did</b> <b>she</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> know?" ...|$|E
60|$|And then {{as to the}} letter. Why was she so {{persistent}} {{about seeing}} it? <b>Did</b> <b>she</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> get it into her hands and then keep it, as Harold An Wolf had done? Was it possible that she suspected he would use it to coerce her; she would call it 'blackmail,' he supposed. This being the very thing he had intended to do, and had done, he grew very indignant at {{the very thought of}} being accused of it. It was, he felt, a very awkward thing that he had lost possession of the letter. He might need it if Stephen got nasty. Then Harold might give it to her, as he had threatened to do. He thought he would call round that evening by Harold's house, and see if he couldn't get back the letter. It belonged to him; Harold had no right to keep it. He would see him before he and Stephen got putting their heads together. So, on his way home, he turned his steps at once to Harold's house.|$|E
6000|$|DOLPHIN. I {{suppose it}} can. For, {{when all is}} said, there are damned few of us who really take things much to heart. Julie de Lespinasses are happily not common. I am even subnormal. At twenty I {{believed}} myself passionate: one does at that age. But now, when I come to consider myself candidly, I find that I am really {{one of those who}} never deeply felt nor strongly willed. Everything is profoundly indifferent to me. I sometimes try to depress myself with the thought that the world is a cess-pool, that men are pathetic degenerates from the ape whose laboriously manufactured ideals are pure nonsense and find no rhyme in reality, that the whole of life is a bad joke which takes a long time coming to an end. But it really doesn't upset me. I don't care a curse. It's deplorable; one ought to care. The best people do care. Still, I must say I should like to get possession of Miss Toomis. Confound that Grattarol woman. What on earth <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> rush me like that for, do you suppose? ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{song was}} {{performed}} {{third on the}} night of the Eurovision's final competition of 1992, following Belgium's Morgane with [...] "Nous, on veut des violons" [...] and preceding Turkey's Aylin Vatankoş with [...] "Yaz bitti". In an interview that was conducted at the week of the competition, with the Israeli performer, Dafna Dekel she was asked what position <b>does</b> <b>she</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> get to and had answered [...] "Somewhere between 5th and 7th". At the close of voting, the song received 85 points, placing it 6th out of 23.|$|R
5000|$|Meanwhile, Suzette's mother, Susan Nicolas, {{was angry}} {{and called on}} Suzette's former lawyer, Evalyn Ursua, and like-minded groups and {{individuals}} to stop initiating action on the case. [...] Susan also demanded to know why Ursua was [...] "asking for an investigation when we {{were the ones who}} approached lawyers so we can get the court-awarded civil damages intended for us." [...] Pertaining to Ursua, Suzette's mother added, [...] "What <b>does</b> <b>she</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> happen? I’m really angry. Why can’t she just accept that we don’t want her services anymore?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Mother’s <b>done</b> what <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> There’s {{no sense}} in it that I can see. I’m sure she couldn’t have thought you had enough of her. It’s {{perfectly}} wicked, leaving us like that.” ...|$|R
