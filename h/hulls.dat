5|$|Bulker <b>hulls</b> {{are made}} of steel, usually mild steel. Some {{manufacturers}} have preferred high-tensile steel recently {{in order to reduce}} the tare weight. However, the use of high-tensile steel for longitudinal and transverse reinforcements can reduce the hull's rigidity and resistance to corrosion. Forged steel is used for some ship parts, such as the propeller shaft support. Transverse partitions {{are made of}} corrugated iron, reinforced at the bottom and at connections. The construction of bulker <b>hulls</b> using a concrete-steel sandwich has been investigated.|$|E
5|$|During the {{afternoon}} of 12 October, a gale sprang up which inflicted further damage to the battered ships and caused water to gush through the many shot holes in the ships' <b>hulls.</b> Aboard the Dutch ships, the situation was especially dangerous. Casualties had been significantly higher, particularly on Vrijheid, than on board the British vessels and the small numbers of British sailors placed aboard as prize crews were unable to cope alone, and in the high winds many masts collapsed to the deck and huge quantities of water leaked into the <b>hulls.</b>|$|E
40|$|Bounding <b>hull,</b> such as convex <b>hull,</b> concave <b>hull,</b> alpha shapes etc. has vast {{applications}} {{in different areas}} especially in computational geometry. Alpha shape and concave <b>hull</b> are generalizations of convex <b>hull.</b> Unlike the convex <b>hull,</b> they construct non-convex enclosure {{on a set of}} points. In this paper, we introduce another generalization of convex <b>hull,</b> named alpha-concave <b>hull,</b> and compare this concept with convex <b>hull</b> and alpha shape. We show that the alpha-concave <b>hull</b> is also a generalization of an NP-complete problem named min-area TSP. We prove that computing the alpha-concave <b>hull</b> is NP-hard on a set of points...|$|R

5|$|The König-class {{ships were}} 174.7m long at the waterline, and 175.4m long overall. With {{a beam of}} 29.5m, a forward draft of 9.19m and a rear draft of 9.0m, the Königs were {{designed}} to displace 25,796metric tons normally, but at full combat load, they displaced 28,600tons. The <b>hulls</b> were constructed with transverse and longitudinal steel frames, over which the outer hull plates were riveted. The ships' <b>hulls</b> each contained 18 watertight compartments, each equipped with a double bottom that ran for 88% {{of the length of}} the hull.|$|E
5|$|The ships' <b>hulls</b> were {{constructed}} with transverse steel frames; over 90percent of the <b>hulls</b> used welding {{instead of the}} then standard riveting, which saved 15 percent of their total hull weight. This savings allowed the armament and armor to be increased. The <b>hulls</b> contained twelve watertight compartments and were fitted with a double bottom that extended for 92percent {{of the length of}} the keel. As designed, the ship's complement comprised 33officers and 586enlisted men. After 1935, the crew was dramatically increased, to 30 officers and 921–1,040 sailors. While serving as a squadron flagship, an additional 17 officers and 85 enlisted men augmented the crew. The second flagship had an additional 13 officers and 59 sailors. The ships carried a number of smaller boats, including two picket boats, two barges, one launch, one pinnace, and two dinghies.|$|E
5|$|As Pellew's {{squadron}} neared Griessie, {{a message}} {{arrived from the}} Dutch civilian governor at Sourabaya, reversing Cowell's orders and offering a full surrender. Pellew accepted the message and on 7 December his ships entered Griessie. However, during the time it had taken to exchange messages, Cowell had ordered that all shipping in Griessie harbour be destroyed to prevent the British gaining control of it. The ships were scuttled in shallow water, leaving only wrecked <b>hulls</b> for the British to claim. Pellew ordered the <b>hulls</b> burned, and British landing parties investigated the town, burning and destroying all military supplies and cannon they found. Another party landed at Sambelangan and demolished the battery there. Pellew withdrew on 11 December, his ambition of destroying the Dutch naval presence in the East Indies complete.|$|E
50|$|Modern {{submarines}} and submersibles, {{as well as}} {{the oldest}} ones, usually have a single <b>hull.</b> Large submarines generally have an additional <b>hull</b> or <b>hull</b> sections outside. This external <b>hull,</b> which actually forms the shape of submarine, is called the outer <b>hull</b> (casing in the Royal Navy) or light <b>hull,</b> as it does not have to withstand a pressure difference. Inside the outer <b>hull</b> there is a strong <b>hull,</b> or pressure <b>hull,</b> which withstands sea pressure and has normal atmospheric pressure inside.|$|R

5|$|Since the {{adoption}} of double hull has been more of an economic than a purely architectural decision, some argue that double-sided ships receive less comprehensive surveys and suffer more from hidden corrosion.

5|$|The ships' <b>hulls</b> were {{constructed}} from longitudinal steel frames. The <b>hulls</b> {{were divided into}} fourteen watertight compartments and a double bottom that extended for 72percent {{of the length of}} the keel. The Kriegsmarine regarded the ships as good sea boats, with gentle motion. At low speed, however, they were affected unpredictably by wind and currents. The ships heeled up to fourteen degrees and lost up to 50% speed with the rudder hard over at high speed. The ships had a standard complement of 42officers and 1,340enlisted men. Wartime modifications increased the crew to 51officers and 1,548sailors. The ships carried several smaller vessels, including two picket boats, two barges, one launch, one pinnace, and two dinghies.|$|E

5|$|There is no {{clearly defined}} {{end to the}} ironclad, besides the {{transition}} from wood <b>hulls</b> to all-metal. Ironclads continued {{to be used in}} World War I. Towards the end of the 19th century, the descriptions 'battleship' and 'armored cruiser' came to replace the term 'ironclad'.|$|E
5|$|Using iron {{construction}} for warships offered {{advantages for}} the engineering of the hull. However, unarmored iron had many military disadvantages, and offered technical problems which kept wooden <b>hulls</b> in use for many years, particularly for long-range cruising warships.|$|E
5|$|Although double-hull {{design is}} {{superior}} in low energy casualties and prevents spillage in small casualties, in high energy casualties where both <b>hulls</b> are breached, oil can spill through the double-hull {{and into the}} sea and spills from a double-hull tanker can be significantly higher than designs like the mid-deck tanker, the Coulombi egg tanker and even a pre-MARPOL tanker, as the last one has a lower oil column and reaches hydrostatic balance sooner.|$|E

5|$|Another common process, {{explosion}} welding, {{involves the}} joining of materials by pushing them together under extremely high pressure. The {{energy from the}} impact plasticizes the materials, forming a weld, even though only {{a limited amount of}} heat is generated. The process is commonly used for welding dissimilar materials, such as the welding of aluminum with steel in ship <b>hulls</b> or compound plates. Other solid-state welding processes include friction welding (including friction stir welding), magnetic pulse welding, co-extrusion welding, cold welding, diffusion bonding, exothermic welding, high frequency welding, hot pressure welding, induction welding, and roll welding.|$|E
5|$|Another rare variant was the Bergepanzer IV armored {{recovery}} vehicle. Some {{were believed}} to have been converted locally, 21 were converted from <b>hulls</b> returned for repair between October 1944 and January 1945. The conversion involved removing the turret and adding a wooden plank cover with an access hatch over the turret ring and the addition of a 2-ton jib crane and rigid towing bars.|$|E
5|$|Because {{titanium}} is {{resistant to}} corrosion by sea water, {{it is used}} to make propeller shafts, rigging, and heat exchangers in desalination plants; heater-chillers for salt water aquariums, fishing line and leader, and divers' knives.
