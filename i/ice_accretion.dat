This ice coating adds an additional weight of 15 to 20 kilograms per metre of conductor (10 to 20lb/ft).

40|$|Zinc (Zn) {{pollution}} negatively affects {{human and}} ecosystem health. We quantified atmospheric Zn inputs at six remote mountain-top {{locations in the}} Czech Republic (Central Europe), and used δ 66 Zn isotope ratios to identify Zn from different pollution sources. The study sites were located at an elevation of approximately 1000 m near the state borders with Germany and Poland. During two winter seasons (2009 - 2010), over 400 samples of vertical deposition (snow) and horizontal deposition (<b>ice</b> <b>accretions)</b> were collected. Zinc pollution levels were generally low. Zinc concentrations in snow and <b>ice</b> <b>accretions</b> were less than twice higher in the east, compared to the west. Across the sites, over 90 % of Zn was present in a weak-acid soluble form. Zinc concentrations were 5 times higher in <b>ice</b> <b>accretions,</b> which formed from small droplets originating in the basal cloud layer, rich in pollutants, than in snow. In contrast, droplets resulting in snow formation were larger and scavenged less pollution due to their smaller surface area. δ 66 Zn of Pribram sphalerite (west) and smelter-derived fly ash (west) were low, - 0. 23 and - 0. 47 ‰, respectively. Olkusz sphalerite (east) had a higher δ 66 Zn of 0. 02 ‰. δ 66 Zn of snow ranged from - 0. 60 to 0. 68 ‰. <b>Ice</b> <b>accretions</b> had δ 66 Zn between - 0. 67 and 0. 14 ‰. At the three eastern sites, δ 66 Zn of <b>ice</b> <b>accretions</b> were lower than δ 66 Zn of snow, suggesting the presence of volatilized smelter derived or coal-burning derived Zn. δ 66 Zn of <b>ice</b> <b>accretions</b> at {{two of the three}} western sites were higher than δ 66 Zn of snow. Different δ 66 Zn values of snow and <b>ice</b> <b>accretions</b> from the same site reflected different pollution sources, which may have been situated at different distances from the receptor site. δ 66 Zn of the soluble Zn fraction was higher than δ 66 Zn of the insoluble Zn fraction, possibly also indicating a different origin of these two Zn fractions. Zinc isotope heterogeneity in the atmosphere of remote areas indicates that δ 66 Zn can be a useful tool in pollution provenance studies. JRC. E. 5 -Nuclear chemistr...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of an experimental study designed to characterize and evaluate the aerodynamic performance penalties of residual and intercycle <b>ice</b> <b>accretions</b> that result from the cyclic operation of a typical aircraft deicing system. Icing wind tunnel tests were carried out on a 36 -inch chord NACA 23012 airfoil section equipped with a pneumatic deicer for several different FAR 25 Appendix C cloud conditions. Results from the icing tests showed that the intercycle <b>ice</b> <b>accretions</b> were much more severe in terms of size and shape than the residual <b>ice</b> <b>accretions.</b> Molds of selected intercycle ice shapes were made and converted to castings that were attached to the leading edge of a 36 -inch chord NACA 23012 airfoil model for aerodynamic testing. The aerodynamic testing revealed that the intercycle ice shapes caused a significant performance degradation. Maximum lift coefficients were typically reduced about 60 % from 1. 8 (clean) to 0. 7 (iced) and stall angles were reduced from 17 deg. (clean) to 9 deg. (iced). Changes in the Reynolds number (from 2. 0 x 10 (exp 6) to 10. 5 x 10 (exp 6) and Mach number (from 0. 10 to 0. 28) did not significantly affect the iced-airfoil performance...|$|R
40|$|AIAA 2005 - 658 : Fifty years ago, the {{phenomenon}} of spongy icing was well-known to the in-flight icing community.

Aerodynamic performance data has been derived from recorded inertial and air data, sliced into time intervals of varying length from 4 to 20 second duration. In particular, the changes in profile and induced drag coefficients ∆CDo and ∆k, respectively, and in lift-curve slope, ∆a, have been derived for each time slice, and examined in the time-domain. Useful drag component data has been extracted from the time-slices, indicating that non-substantial changes to ∂CD/∂CL 2 occurred, but approximately 380 % rise in CDo occurred. The CDo rise correlated reasonably with 80 VD, but not with the MVD, when the droplet size parameters were derived for the combined small (FSSP probes) and large droplet (2 DC probe) spectra. The drag rise was much larger than that measured in FZL, with wing flaps UP. It would equate to an approximate loss of climb gradient of 8. 7 %, very substantial when compared with landing-climb gradient and go-around obstacle-clearance climb-out path airworthiness and operational requirements, respectively. <b>Icing</b> <b>accretion</b> completely obscured the front windscreen panels.
