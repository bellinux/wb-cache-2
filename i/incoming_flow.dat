5|$|At Aliso Beach, {{the mouth}} of Aliso Creek, lies a {{freshwater}} pond that changes frequently in elevation and extent. Tidal activity at the creek's mouth results in sediment building gradually up into a sandbar, impounding it in a small lake about 0.2 miles (0.3km) long at its fullest extent. Afterwards, the water level rises upstream of the sandbar until one of two factors causes it to breach: either waves at high tide wash away {{the top of the}} sandbar, or the lagoon rises enough to overtop the sandbar by itself. Once the water level rises above the sandbar, rapid erosion quickly cuts through the sand and drains the approximately 3–5-foot (0.9–1.5 m)-deep lake in a matter of minutes. Peak flows through the sandbar can reach , even if the <b>incoming</b> <b>flow</b> of the creek is nowhere near that size. Because of the raised flow of the creek and the construction of a parking lot in the lagoon area since the 1960s, the lagoon has never been able to fill to its much larger, historic extent without breaching. Species such as the tidewater goby have suffered because of loss of their habitat this way.|$|E

Initial results show there is more inflow than consumption of glucose in regions such as the amygdala, basal ganglia, thalamus and cingulate cortex, {{all of which are}} recruited for fast responses. In regions that are more deliberative, such as the lateral frontal and lateral parietal lobes, it seems that <b>incoming</b> <b>flow</b> is less than consumption. This affects BOLD sensitivity.|$|E

2500|$|For certain body shapes, {{the drag}} {{coefficient}} [...] only {{depends on the}} Reynolds number , Mach number [...] and {{the direction of the}} flow. For low Mach number , the drag coefficient is independent of Mach number. Also, the variation with Reynolds number [...] within a practical range of interest is usually small, while for cars at highway speed and aircraft at cruising speed, the <b>incoming</b> <b>flow</b> direction is also more-or-less the same. Therefore, the drag coefficient [...] can often be treated as a constant.|$|E

This raised protests from the EMP and led to attempts to stop their <b>incoming</b> <b>flow.</b> In August 1939, Andor Jaross asked the Hungarian prime minister to recall {{at least part of}} them back to Hungary. Due to different development in Czechoslovakia and Hungary during the previous 20 years, local Hungarians had more democratic spirit and came into conflict with the new administration known by its authoritarian arrogance.

2500|$|In graph theory, a flow network (also {{known as}} a {{transportation}} network) is a directed graph where each edge has a capacity and each edge receives a flow. The amount of flow on an edge cannot exceed {{the capacity of the}} edge. Often in operations research, a directed graph is called a network, the vertices are called nodes and the edges are called arcs. [...] A flow must satisfy the restriction that the amount of flow into a node equals the amount of flow out of it, unless it is a source, which has only outgoing flow, or sink, which has only <b>incoming</b> <b>flow.</b> [...] A network can be used to model traffic in a road system, circulation with demands, fluids in pipes, currents in an electrical circuit, or anything similar in which something travels through a network of nodes.|$|E
2500|$|Prandtl {{made the}} {{hypothesis}} that the viscous effects are important in thin layers – called boundary layers – adjacent to solid boundaries, and that viscosity has no role of importance outside. [...] The boundary-layer thickness becomes smaller when the viscosity reduces. [...] The full problem of viscous flow, described by the non-linear Navier–Stokes equations, is in general not mathematically solvable. [...] However, using his hypothesis (and backed up by experiments) Prandtl was able to derive an approximate model for the flow inside the boundary layer, called boundary-layer theory; while the flow outside the boundary layer could be treated using inviscid flow theory. [...] Boundary-layer theory is amenable to the method of matched asymptotic expansions for deriving approximate solutions. [...] In the simplest case of a flat plate parallel to the <b>incoming</b> <b>flow,</b> boundary-layer theory results in (friction) drag, whereas all inviscid flow theories will predict zero drag. [...] Importantly for aeronautics, Prandtl's theory can be applied directly to streamlined bodies like airfoils where, in addition to surface-friction drag, there is also form drag. Form drag is due to the effect of the boundary layer and thin wake on the pressure distribution around the airfoil.|$|E
