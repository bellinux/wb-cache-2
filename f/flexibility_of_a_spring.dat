Time:September 20, 2012 - September 22, 2012. National Natural Science Foundation of China; Harbin Institute of TechnologyTo quantitatively assess {{stability}} of circular economy, the article defines the flexible development <b>of</b> <b>a</b> circular economy in enterprise {{based on the}} enterprise flexibility and the industrial chain <b>flexibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> circular economy, analyzes all {{the internal and external}} factors that affect the flexible development <b>of</b> <b>a</b> circular economy in enterprise, and points out the specific content that should be considered in evaluating the industrial chain <b>flexibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> circular economy. The article also builds the index system that evaluates the development <b>flexibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> circular economy in enterprise and describes the set of evaluation. On this basis, the article evaluates the development <b>flexibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> circular economy in enterprise with the method of the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation. At last, 'M Coal Group' is selected as an example to analyze the development <b>flexibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> circular economy. 漏 2012 IEEE...|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn {{this paper}} we define the <b>flexibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> system as its {{capability}} {{to schedule a}} new task. We present an approach to quantify the <b>flexibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> system. More importantly, we show {{that it is possible}} under certain conditions to identify the task that will directly induce the limitations on a possible software update. If performed at design time, such a result can be used to adjust the system design by giving more slack to the limiting task. We illustrate how these results apply to a simple system...|$|R

40|$|By the {{experiment}} {{on the balance}} of three forces, we notice that one force can not become equal to the resultant {{of the other two}} forces when we use <b>a</b> <b>spring</b> balance horizontally or obliquely. This error is caused by making <b>an</b> erroneous u・e <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>spring</b> balance which ought to be used vertically, that is, the gravity <b>of</b> <b>a</b> hook in <b>a</b> <b>spring</b> balance causes the error. Accordingly, we must correct the error of the scale <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>spring</b> balance when we use it horizontally or obliquely. This report shows the correction value for the scale in case of making use <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>spring</b> balance horizontally. Moreover, we show the comparison between a experimental value and a correction one...|$|R

40|$|While {{insufficient}} <b>flexibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> {{information system}} {{to support a}} business process precludes {{the use of the}} system in certain cases, excessive <b>flexibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> information system can limit the usability of the system (Silver 1991), in addition to presenting an unnecessary investment. Despite <b>a</b> wealth <b>of</b> research on <b>flexibility</b> and its impacts on organizations and business processes (esp. manufacturing), the value <b>of</b> <b>flexibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> information system and the price at which it comes have rarely been included into the analysis, with the result that guidelines to determine <b>an</b> appropriate level <b>of</b> <b>flexibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> information system to support a given business process have not been developed. To support decisions regarding information system flexibility, the current paper presents an optimization model to relate business process characteristics (uncertainty, variability, and time−criticality) with two basic types <b>of</b> information system <b>flexibility</b> (built−in flexibility to use the information system and flexibility to change the information system). Based on <b>an</b> analysis <b>of</b> the model, we conclude that the focus of information system management should be on flexibility to change the information system in order to support processes of high uncertainty, while situations of low uncertainty tend to call for a focus on built−in flexibility to use the information system. The model also shows that very high process variability can limit the value <b>of</b> investments in <b>an</b> information system altogether, thus, improving the importance <b>of</b> careful <b>flexibility</b> and investment management, while <b>a</b> high level <b>of</b> time−criticality generally tends to increase the benefits <b>of</b> using <b>an</b> information system over manual processing...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{discusses}} <b>a</b> method <b>of</b> {{estimating the}} <b>flexibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> manufacturing system. The approach proposed, {{is motivated by}} the dynamic behaviour analogy between a mechanical and a manufacturing system. The main hypothesis is that the <b>flexibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> manufacturing system can be calculated, in the same manner, as the damping factor <b>of</b> <b>a</b> mechanical system. In order for {{the validity of the}} method proposed, to be tested and discussed, <b>a</b> set <b>of</b> experiments has been designed and executed, initially, for a simple production system. An industrial production system has also been studied having used the same approach. The results prove that this method can be used for the estimation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> manufacturing system's <b>flexibility...</b>|$|R
50|$|The flexibility-usability {{tradeoff}} is {{a design}} principle maintaining that, as the <b>flexibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> system increases, its usability decreases. The tradeoff exists because accommodating flexibility requires satisfying <b>a</b> larger set <b>of</b> requirements, {{which results in}} complexity and usability compromises.|$|R

40|$|In machine learning, <b>a</b> number <b>of</b> systems {{learn new}} {{knowledge}} {{in the form of}} compiled formats. These systems deductively learn these compiled formats for achieving future goals. Some times, these systems fail in performing a task using what they have learned. This failure occurs despite the fact that sufficient knowledge for achieving the task is available in the system. The failure stems mainly from the inability <b>of</b> <b>a</b> systems to access part of its learned knowledge during performance, which will be referred to as the lack <b>of</b> <b>flexibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> system. In this paper, two reasons that cause this lack <b>of</b> <b>flexibility</b> are presented: 1) The effect of using deduction as the only method of learning, 2) Choosing compiled formats as a form for learned knowledge. A new paradigm: Flexible Learning of Concepts by Examples (FlexLearn) is presented that uses deduction and induction as learning methods to over come this lack <b>of</b> <b>flexibility.</b> <b>A</b> measure for evaluating the <b>flexibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> learning [...] ...|$|R
