5|$|This {{argument}} {{is based in}} part on the U.S. Supreme Court decision in the case of United States v. Bevans. In Bevans, the parties argued over whether a federal court in Massachusetts had jurisdiction over the case of a U.S. Marine charged with a murder that occurred on a ship in Boston Harbor. No issues regarding federal income taxation or the <b>Internal</b> <b>Revenue</b> Code were presented to or decided by the Court in the Bevans case. The <b>Internal</b> <b>Revenue</b> Code and the <b>Internal</b> <b>Revenue</b> Service did not yet exist in 1818, when the Bevans murder case was decided.|$|E

5|$|In August 2010, {{the members}} of the <b>Internal</b> <b>Revenue</b> Service created a Star Trek themed {{training}} video for a conference.

5|$|In the 2016 Annual Financial Report for Local Government {{published}} by the Commission on Audit, it is stated that the City of Manila's total income was ₱12.8 billion.

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of direct American involvement in World War II, the U.S. government bought the building and converted it to federal offices, officer billets, spaces used by the Army's Ordnance Procurement department, a passport agency and an induction center run by the local draft board. The high vaulted ceiling of the Great Hall worship center was hidden by a dropped ceiling. After the war, the <b>Internal</b> <b>Revenue</b> Service moved offices into the building.|$|E
5|$|Following the game, some {{actions by}} Orange Bowl Committee {{officials}} {{came under fire}} as the Miami Herald revealed the nonprofit committee had {{spent millions of dollars}} on junket trips for college football administrators.

5|$|In 1978, Gravel {{authored}} {{and secured}} the passage into {{law of the}} General Stock Ownership Corporation, that became Subchapter U of the Tax Code under the <b>Internal</b> <b>Revenue</b> Code of 1954. While that was originally done as a prerequisite to a failed 1980 Alaskan ballot initiative that would have paid dividends to Alaskan citizens for pipeline-related revenue, it also {{turned out to be}} significant in the development of binary economics.|$|E
5|$|In January 2013, the <b>Internal</b> <b>Revenue</b> Service {{ruled that}} the cost of {{covering}} only the individual employee would be considered in determining whether the cost of coverage exceeded 9.5% of income. Family plans would not be considered even if the cost was above the 9.5% income threshold. This was estimated to leave 2–4 million Americans unable to afford family coverage under their employers’ plans and ineligible for subsidies.|$|E
5|$|Larson soon {{got caught}} up in an illicit scheme to sell part of a foreign lottery, and he fled Ohio. His family was {{contacted}} by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the <b>Internal</b> <b>Revenue</b> Service, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, but his whereabouts were unknown until his death from throat cancer on February 16, 1999, in Apopka, Florida.|$|E

5|$|Gingrich {{and others}} in the House, {{including}} the newly minted Gang of Seven, railed against what they saw as ethical lapses during the nearly 40 years of Democratic control for almost 40 years. The House banking scandal and Congressional Post Office scandal were emblems of the exposed corruption. Gingrich himself was among members of the House who had written NSF checks on the House bank. He had overdrafts on twenty-two checks, including a $9,463 check to the <b>Internal</b> <b>Revenue</b> Service in 1990.|$|E
5|$|His horses raced at the Del Mar Racetrack, and he {{invested}} {{large sums}} of money in the hobby. Murphy had a gambling habit that left his finances in a poor state. In 1968 he stated that he lost $260,000 in an Algerian oil deal and was dealing with the <b>Internal</b> <b>Revenue</b> Service over unpaid taxes.

5|$|In 1989, the <b>Internal</b> <b>Revenue</b> Service began {{investigating}} the Reagans over allegations they owed additional {{tax on the}} gifts and loans of high-fashion clothes and jewelry to the First Lady during {{their time in the}} White House (recipients benefiting from the display of such items recognize taxable income even if they are returned). In 1992, the IRS determined the Reagans had failed to include some $3 million worth of fashion items between 1983 and 1988 on their tax returns; they were billed for a large amount of back taxes and interest, which was subsequently paid.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, the {{original}} clock was moved from its location near 42nd Street, {{and the building}} where the sign had been mounted was demolished so One Bryant Park could be built.

5|$|During the University of Michigan {{basketball}} scandal the Big Ten Conference, National Collegiate Athletic Association, Federal Bureau of Investigation, <b>Internal</b> <b>Revenue</b> Service, and United States Department of Justice {{investigated the}} relationship between the University of Michigan, its men's basketball teams and basketball team booster Ed Martin. The program was punished for NCAA rules violations, principally involving payments booster Martin made to several players to launder money from an illegal gambling operation.

5|$|Salant later {{pulled the}} episode from the {{schedule}} and assigned producer Harry Morgan to re-edit it. According to Wallace, Salant found the piece sensationalistic; however, C. A. Tripp, {{a psychologist who}} had put CBS {{in touch with his}} patient Larson, claimed that Salant felt the piece was pro-homosexuality. Morgan scrapped all but about 10 minutes of Peters' final cut. CBS felt that the self-accepting gay men made too favorable of an impression, so Morgan edited two of the interviews to make the men seem unhappier. According to Wallace, no sponsor would buy time during the episode because of the taboo nature of the subject matter. Commercial spots were filled by public service announcements for the Peace Corps and the <b>Internal</b> <b>Revenue</b> Service.|$|E
5|$|The University of Michigan {{basketball}} scandal or Ed Martin scandal was {{a series}} of National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) rules violations that resulted in a six-year investigation {{of the relationship between the}} University of Michigan, its men's basketball program, and basketball team booster Ed Martin.
