This is comparable to the strong influence of visual feedback on reaching movements during visual perturbation (e.g. shifting the location of objects by viewing through a prism).|$|E
25|$|Listeners' {{ratings in}} Barron-Lutzross's {{experiment}} of {{likelihood that a}} speaker is a lesbian correlated with several different phonological variables.

The weights {{are determined by the}} peak energies of the bands of frequency resonance, <b>formants.</b> The resulting weighted averages are called the Centroid <b>Formants.</b> In our proposed methodology, these centroid <b>formants</b> are used to automatically detect Dysarthric speech using neural network classification technique. The experimental results recorded after testing this algorithm are presented. The experimental data consists of 200 speech samples from 10 Dysarthric Speakers and 200 speech samples from 10 age-matched healthy speakers. The experimental results show a high performance using neural networks classification. A possible future research related to this work is the use of these extended features in speaker identification and recognition of disordered speech...|$|R

In increasing these frequency values, it was possible for these transfeminine individuals to more closely approximate the vocal frequency of cisgender women.

The analysis focused on changes in <b>formant</b> frequency and fundamental frequency through regular recordings over a one-year time period. Of the ten speakers whose voices were analyzed {{over a long period of}} time, all underwent a drop in fundamental frequency in the early stages of HRT; however, testosterone could not account for all the changes in the voice and mannerisms. The dissertation concludes that social factors also affect changes in transmasculine voices.|$|E

Time-varying <b>formant</b> frequencies and amplitudes derived by linear predictive coding were synthesized additively as pure tone whistles. This method is called sinewave synthesis. Also the composite sinusoidal modeling (CSM) used on a singing speech synthesis feature on Yamaha CX5M (1984), is known to use a similar approach which was independently developed during 19661979. These methods are characterized by extraction and recomposition {{of a set of}} significant spectral peaks corresponding to the several resonance modes occurred in the oral cavity and nasal cavity, in a viewpoint of acoustics. This principle was also utilized on a physical modeling synthesis method, called modal synthesis.|$|E

500|$|An {{alternative}} suggestion {{connects the}} name to the Syriac tedmurtā (ܬܕܡܘܪܬܐ) [...] "miracle", hence tedmurtā [...] "object of wonder", from the root dmr [...] "to wonder"; this possibility was mentioned favourably by Franz Altheim and Ruth Altheim-Stiehl (1973), but rejected by Jean Starcky (1960) and Michael Gawlikowski (1974). Michael Patrick O'Connor (1988) suggested that the names [...] "Palmyra" [...] and [...] "Tadmor" [...] originated in the Hurrian language. As evidence, he cited the inexplicability of alterations to the theorized roots of both names (represented in the addition of -d- to tamar and -ra- to palame). According to this theory, [...] "Tadmor" [...] derives from the Hurrian word tad ("to love") {{with the addition of}} the typical Hurrian mid vowel rising (mVr) <b>formant</b> mar.

Drummer Chris Tomson would then re-record the drums playing to the sped-up recording to get an uptempo live take. This second recording was then slowed back down to original speed to create an [...] "underwater" [...] effect. The effect is featured prominently on vocals as well. Ezra Koenig's vocals were run through Eventide H949 and 910 on tracks such as [...] "Diane Young", with both the pitch and <b>formant</b> shifted changed to manipulate the sound of recorded vocals.
