Normal controls (n � 21), subjects with lesions in the ventromedial (VM) (n � 9) or dorsolateral/high mesial (DL/M) prefrontal cortices (n � 10), performed on (1) modified delay tasks that assess working memory and (2) a gambling task designed to measure decision making.

40|$|Macaque monkeys with {{bilateral}} lesions {{of either}} the frontal eye-fields (Area 8) or the inferior parietal lobule (Area 7 a or PG) were compared with unoperated controls {{on their ability to}} perform a series of 8 pre-operatively learnt visual discriminations. Simple non-spatial discriminations were not affected, but the frontal group was affected when the stimuli in a shape discrimination varied in position from trial to trial and the parietal group was <b>impaired</b> <b>on</b> the judgement of centre. Both groups were <b>impaired</b> <b>on</b> a spatial andmark test which used luminous timuli presented in the dark, in positions that varied randomly with respect to the monkey so that only allocentric ues were available. Postoperative trial-by-trial error analysis on the landmark test showed that, whereas patial discriminability was a factor in determining the performance ofthe experimental groups, degree of cue-response separation and response perseveration were not. A comparison of the performance of the two groups on all 8 tests suggests that although both are <b>impaired</b> <b>on</b> spatial discriminations, the frontal eye-fields are concerned with spatially organising responses to explore the environment, while the inferior parietal lobule is concerned more directly with the processing of spatial information and the perception of spatial relationships...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} verbal and spatial working memory (WM) functioning in individuals with the neuro-developmental disorder Williams syndrome (WS) using WM component tasks. While {{there is strong}} evidence of WM impairments in WS, previous {{research has focused on}} short-term memory and has neglected assessment of executive components of WM. There is a particular lack of consensus concerning the profile of verbal WM functioning in WS. Here, WS participants were compared to typically developing participants matched for (1) verbal ability and (2) spatial ability (N = 14 in each of the 3 groups). Individuals with WS were <b>impaired</b> <b>on</b> verbal WM tasks, both those involving short-term maintenance of information and executive manipulation, in comparison to verbal-matched controls. Surprisingly, individuals with WS were not <b>impaired</b> <b>on</b> a spatial task assessing short-term maintenance of information in memory (remembering spatial locations) compared to spatial-matched controls. They were, however, <b>impaired</b> <b>on</b> a spatial executive WM task requiring the manipulation of spatial information in memory. The present study suggests that individuals with WS show WM impairments that extend to both verbal and spatial domains, although spatial deficits are selective to executive aspects of WM function...|$|R

The tests administered were sensitive to functions of dorsolateral prefrontal and orbito-frontal subsystems. Measures included perseverative errors on the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST-pe), errors on object alternation (OA), errors on Trails B, {{number of words}} generated on the Controlled Oral Word Association Test (COWAT), and number of categories completed on the WCST (WCST-cc). KS patients were as impaired as AL participants on orbitofrontal measures and, on dorsolateral prefrontal measures, were impaired relative to AL participants, whose performance {{did not differ from}} controls. Patients with PD also were <b>impaired</b> <b>on</b> tests of orbitofrontal and dorsolateral prefrontal functioning but to a lesser extent than the KS patients. Moreover, most of the PD deficits were driven by the impaired performance of patients whose initial symptoms were <b>on</b> the <b>right</b> side of the body. The ACoA patients were significantly <b>impaired</b> <b>on</b> tests of orbitofrontal but not dorsolateral prefrontal functioning relative to the control group. Together, the results confirm different patterns of frontal-system impairments in patient groups having compromised frontal lobe functioning consequent to varying etiologies...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{research}} on the DSM-IV subtypes of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has demonstrated that the subtypes differ in demographic characteristics, types of functional impairment, and profiles of comorbidity with other childhood disorders. However, little research has tested whether the subtypes differ in underlying neuropsychological deficits. This study compared the neuropsycho-logical profiles of children without ADHD (n D 82) and children who met symptom criteria for DSM-IV Predominantly Inattentive subtype (ADHD-IA; n D 67), Predominantly Hyperactive Im-pulsive subtype (ADHD-HI; n D 14), and Combined subtype (ADHD-C; n D 33) {{in the areas of}} processing speed, vigilance, and inhibition. We hypothesized that children with elevations of inatten-tion symptoms (ADHD-IA and ADHD-C) would be <b>impaired</b> <b>on</b> measures of vigilance and processing speed, whereas children with significant hyperactivity/impulsivity (ADHD-HI and ADHD-C) would be <b>impaired</b> <b>on</b> measures of inhibition. Contrary to prediction, symptoms of inattention best predicted performance on all dependent measures, and ADHD-IA and ADHD-C children had similar profiles of impairment. In contrast, children with ADHD-HI were not significantly <b>impaired</b> <b>on</b> any dependent measures once subclinical symptoms of inattention were controlled. Our results do not support distinct neuropsychological deficits in ADHD-IA and ADHD-C children, and suggest that symptoms of inat-tention, rather than symptoms of hyperactivity/impulsivity, are associated with neuropsychological impairment.

40|$|Sorry, {{the full}} text of this article is not {{available}} in Huskie Commons. Please click on the alternative location to access it. 126 p. The relationship between visual perception and visual memory was investigated. Two tests of visual perception (Facial Recognition and Judgment of Line Orientation) and two tests of visual memory (Form Sequence Learning and the 7 / 24 Spatial Recall Test) were administered to 35 subjects with unilateral cerebral lesions acquired through cerebrovascular accidents. On both perceptual measures the frequency of deficits was significantly greater among subjects with right hemisphere lesions than among subjects with left hemisphere lesions, p $<$. 05. Performance on the visual memory tests was essentially normal for subjects with left hemisphere lesions unaccompanied by aphasia. In the presence of aphasia, performance on both visual memory tests was uniformly poor. Of subjects with right hemisphere lesions, 33 % were <b>impaired</b> <b>on</b> Form Sequence Learning whereas 70 % were <b>impaired</b> <b>on</b> the 7 / 24 Spatial Recall Test. The hypothesis that visual perception was related to visual memory performance was confirmed, although the relationship varies with the hemispheric locus of lesion, and the types of perceptual and visual memory tests used. Specifically, Form Sequence Learning is significantly correlated with Facial Recognition following left hemisphere lesions, r(16) =. 51, p $<$. 05. Following right hemisphere lesions, 8 of 11 subjects <b>impaired</b> <b>on</b> the 7 / 24 test were also <b>impaired</b> <b>on</b> Judgment of Line Orientation. With the lesion groups combined, Form Sequence Learning shows a pattern of significant correlations with verbal measures, whereas the 7 / 24 test shows a pattern of significant correlations with perceptual and perceptual-constructional measures. The results indicate that visual memory deficits accompany the syndrome of aphasia following left hemisphere lesions. Following right hemisphere lesions, visual memory impairment forms part of a wider syndrome of perceptual deficits...|$|R
40|$|Humans {{are able}} to use nonverbal {{behavior}} to make fast, reliable judgments of both emotional states and personality traits. Whereas a sizeable body of research has identified neural structures critical for emotion recognition, the neural substrates of personality trait attribution have not been explored in detail. In the present study, we investigated the neural systems involved in emotion and personality trait judgments. We used a type of visual stimulus that is known to convey both emotion and personality information, namely, point-light walkers. We compared the emotion and personality trait judgments made by subjects with brain damage to those made by neurologically normal subjects and then conducted a lesion overlap analysis to identify neural regions critical for these two tasks. Impairments on the two tasks dissociated: Some subjects were impaired at emotion recognition, but judged personality normally; other subjects were <b>impaired</b> <b>on</b> the personality task, but normal at emotion recognition. Moreover, these dissociations in performance were associated with damage to specific neural regions: Right somatosensory cortices were a primary focus of lesion overlap in subjects <b>impaired</b> <b>on</b> the emotion task, whereas left frontal opercular cortices were a primary focus of lesion overlap in subjects <b>impaired</b> <b>on</b> the personality task. These findings suggest that attributions of emotional states and personality traits are accomplished by partially dissociable neural systems...|$|R

40|$|According to Kosslyn, {{two types}} of spatial {{relations}} {{can be used to}} arrange parts in mental imagery, i. e., categorical spatial relations and coordinate spatial relations, which are processed respectively by the left and right hemispheres.

The results show that left brain-damaged patients were selectively <b>impaired</b> <b>on</b> processing categorical representations, while right brain-damaged patients were more <b>impaired</b> <b>on</b> the processing the coordinate ones, regardless of the presence of visuo-spatial neglect.
