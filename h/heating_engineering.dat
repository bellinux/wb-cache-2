40|$|Intelligent {{district}} heating {{is the combination}} of traditional district <b>heating</b> <b>engineering</b> and modern information and communication technology. A {{district heating}} systemis a highly complex environment consisting {{of a large number}} of distributed entities, and this complexity and geographically dispersed layout suggest that they are suitable for distributed optimization and management. However, this would in practice imply a transition from the classical production-centric perspective normally found within district heating management to a more consumer-centric perspective. This thesis describes a multiagent-based system which combines production, consumption and distribution aspects into a single coherent operational management framework. The flexibility and robustness of the solution in industrial settings is thoroughly examined and its performance is shown to lead to significant operational, financial and environmental benefits compared to current management schemes...|$|E
40|$|A {{preliminary}} {{thermal analysis}} based on recently defined Saturn entry conditions has been conducted. The study, using viscous-shock-layer and engineering codes employed for Project Galileo, investigated nonequilibrium chemistry {{effects on the}} Saturn thermal environment, defined the primary heat-transfer mode for heatshield design, delineated some problem areas for future thermal studies, and validated BIRCHES (Blunt Body Inviscid Radiative and Convective <b>Heating</b> <b>Engineering</b> Solutions) for parametric or design studies. The effect of nonequilibrium chemistry appears to significantly influence only the radiative fluxes with effects localized to the stagnation region. However, the heat-transfer mode pertinent to the overall heat-shield design is convection. The convective results of BIRCHES and a detailed code are in good agreement. The resulting mass-loss rates for the currently prescribed nominal Saturn entry conditions are small {{when compared with the}} values for nominal Jupiter entry conditions. With coupled carbon-phenolic ablation injection, the convective heating rates are reduced substantially while the radiative heating rates are increased when compared with the corresponding no-injection results...|$|E

40|$|The book calls {{attention}} to a method of describing and investigating various physicochemical processes in their inseparable link with the heat form of energy.

All the basic principles, laws and equations of equilibrium and non-equilibrium thermodynamics, heat- and mass-exchange theory, thermo-economics and thermodynamics of finite-time processes are here derived from this method as particular cases. The book considers also with much attention phenomena at the interfaces between <b>heat</b> <b>engineering</b> and other engineering disciplines, elaborates new applications of the energy transfer and conversion theories, as well as analyzes paralogisms arising in thermodynamics due to its inconsistent extrapolation.
