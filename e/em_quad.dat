50|$|In typography, a quad (originally quadrat) was a {{metal spacer}} used in {{letterpress}} typesetting. The term was later adopted as the generic name for two common sizes of spaces in typography, {{regardless of the}} form of typesetting used. An <b>em</b> <b>quad</b> is a space that is one em wide; {{as wide as the}} height of the font. An en quad is a space that is one en wide: half the width of an <b>em</b> <b>quad.</b>|$|E
50|$|Both are encoded as {{characters}} in the General Punctuation code block of the Unicode character set as U+2000 EN QUAD and U+2001 <b>EM</b> <b>QUAD,</b> which are also defined to be canonically equivalent to U+2002 EN SPACE and U+2003 EM SPACE respectively.|$|E
5000|$|Compartments {{also held}} spacers, which are blocks of blank type used to {{separate}} words and {{fill out a}} line of type, such as <b>em</b> and en <b>quads</b> (quadrats, or spaces. A quadrat is a block of type whose face {{is lower than the}} printing letters so that it does not itself print.). An em space was the width of a capital letter [...] "M" [...] - as wide as it was high - while an en space referred to a space half the width of its height (usually the dimensions for a capital [...] "N").|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of the paper is to predict faults that tend to occur while classifying a dataset. There are various clustering algorithms that prevail to partition a dataset by some means of similarity. In this paper, a Quad Tree based Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm has been applied for predicting faults in the classification of datasets. K-Means is a simple and popular approach that is widely used to cluster/classify data. However, K-Means does not always guarantee best clustering due to varied reasons. The proposed EM algorithm {{is known to be}} an appropriate optimization for finding compact clusters. EM guarantees elegant convergence. EM algorithm assigns an object to a cluster according to a weight representing the probability of membership. EM then iteratively rescores the objects and updates the estimates. The error-rate for K-Means algorithm and EM algorithm are computed, denoting the number of correctly and incorrectly classified samples by each algorithm. Result consists of charts showing on a comparative basis the effectiveness of <b>EM</b> algorithm with <b>quad</b> tree for fault prediction over the existing Quad Tree based K-Means (QDK) model...|$|R
