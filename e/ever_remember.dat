5|$|In 1981, Fischer {{stayed at}} the home of {{grandmaster}} Peter Biyiasas, where, over a period of four months, he defeated Biyiasas seventeen times in a series of speed games. In an interview with Sports Illustrated reporter William Nack, Biyiasas assessed Fischer's play:He was too good. There was no use in playing him. It wasn't interesting. I was getting beaten, and it wasn't clear to me why. It wasn't like I made this mistake or that mistake. It was like I was being gradually outplayed, from the start. He wasn't taking any time to think. The most depressing thing about it is that I wasn't even getting out of the middle game to an endgame. I don't <b>ever</b> <b>remember</b> an endgame. He honestly believes there is no one for him to play, no one worthy of him. I played him, and I can attest to that.|$|E

He stated [...] "I can't remember in the games that I played in, I can't <b>ever</b> <b>remember</b> being sledged, and I can't <b>ever</b> <b>remember</b> sledging anybody", in reference to Steve Waugh's Australian team, which was perceived as being too hostile. In the Australian edition of the 2002 Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, he wrote a chapter titled [...] "The Curse of Sledging".|$|E
500|$|Johnson {{surprised}} many when {{he weighed}} in at 239pounds at the combine, 12pounds more than expected, although {{he claims that}} this season he played [...] "at about 235 and I got up to 238" [...] and that his weight was not a problem. Johnson had told the media {{that he would not}} run the 40-yard dash at the combine but would wait until his March15 workout at Georgia Tech. Johnson ran a 4.35 and wowed scouts with his jump drill results, his receiving skills, and his 11ft 7in (3.53m) broad jump, which is [...] "best broad jump I can <b>ever</b> <b>remember</b> an NFL prospect having," [...] according to Gil Brandt. Johnson is the only player 6-foot-5 or taller, regardless of position, to run a 40-yard dash in under 4.40 seconds at the combine since 2006.|$|E

500|$|Overnight figures {{indicated}} that the episode averaged 8.7million viewers and a 37% audience share. Official figures gave the episode ratings of 8.86million for its original airing and 740,000 for its 10pm repeat on BBC Three. Brown's performance in the episode was praised by Robert Hanks of The Independent who wrote: [...] "I don't <b>ever</b> <b>remember</b> hearing anybody on a soap talk like this before. I mean, like a real person, with real feelings, such as self-pity and a desperate urge for self-preservation. Brown conveyed the seedy gloom of it all beautifully, as well." [...] Nancy Banks-Smith of The Guardian deemed Brown possibly {{the only member of}} the cast, with the exception of Barbara Windsor (Peggy Mitchell), capable of carrying such a monologue, opining that she [...] "carried it off magnificently". She took issue with Dot's characterisation, however, believing that Dot is presented as the serial's [...] "moral compass", and would not leave her husband in a nursing home.|$|E
500|$|Brown's {{single-hander}} {{episode of}} EastEnders received much critical acclaim.

[...] Conversely, Tim Teeman posed the question in The Times: [...] "I know she’s a national institution and June Brown plays her like a dream, but was last night’s Dot Cotton extravaganza really that great? Or even necessary?" [...] Teeman opined that: [...] "Quite rightly, the producers want to eke as much gold out of the character and actress as possible: both are fantastic. But this was much-loved character overkill." [...] He deemed Dot a [...] "soap icon", however he also assessed that: ...|$|E
500|$|Against the Minnesota Vikings on October 17, Sayers carried 13 {{times for}} 64 {{yards and a}} {{touchdown}}; caught four passes for 63 yards and two touchdowns; and had a 98-yard kickoff return touchdown in the 45–37 Bears victory. He was the last NFL player to score a rushing, receiving, and kickoff return touchdown in the same game until Tyreek Hill accomplished the feat over fifty years later, in 2016. Bears coach Halas lauded Sayers after the game, saying, [...] "I don't <b>ever</b> <b>remember</b> seeing a rookie back who was as good," [...] and deemed his talents equal to former Bears greats Red Grange and George McAfee. [...] "And remember," [...] said Halas, [...] "we used to call George 'One-Play McAfee'." [...] On December 12, Sayers tied Ernie Nevers' and Dub Jones' record for touchdowns in a single game, scoring six in a 61–20 victory over the San Francisco 49ers that was played in muddy conditions at the Chicago Cubs' Wrigley Field. He accounted for 326 yards in the game: 113 rushing, 89 receiving, and 134 on punt returns. Sayers was the consensus choice for NFL Rookie of the Year honors from the AP, UPI, and NEA.|$|E

500|$|By 1850 {{and with}} the {{publication}} of Hurry-Graphs, Willis was becoming a forgotten celebrity. In August 1853, future President James A. Garfield discussed Willis's declining popularity in his diary: [...] "Willis {{is said to be a}} [...] man, although an unrivaled poet. How strange that such men should go to ruin, when they might soar perpetually in the heaven of heavens". After Willis's death, obituaries reported that he had outlived his fame. One remarked, [...] "the man who withdraws from the whirling currents of active life is speedily forgotten". This obituary also stated that Americans [...] "will <b>ever</b> <b>remember</b> and cherish Nathaniel P. Willis as one worthy to stand with Fenimore Cooper and Washington Irving". In 1946, the centennial issue of Town & Country reported that Willis [...] "led a generation of Americans through a gate where weeds gave way to horticulture". More modern scholars have dismissed Willis's work as [...] "sentimental prattle" [...] or refer to him only as an obstacle in the progress of his sister as well as Harriet Jacobs. As biographer Thomas N. Baker wrote, Willis is today only referred to as a footnote in relation to other authors.|$|E
500|$|Drury {{commanded}} Neptune for {{the next}} two years, until his promotion to rear-admiral in 1804. He departed the ship on 13 May 1804, and the following day Captain Sir Thomas Williams took over. Neptune spent the rest of 1804 deployed with the Channel Fleet, blockading the French Atlantic ports. During this time Captain Williams' health progressively worsened, and he was invalided back to Britain on 7 May 1805. He was replaced by Captain Thomas Fremantle on 8 May, and was sent to join Robert Calder's force blockading Ferrol, after the Franco-Spanish fleet had arrived there after the Battle of Cape Finisterre. Calder decided that his eight ships were not sufficient to resist Villeneuve's fleet were it to come out of harbour, and instead went north to join Admiral William Cornwallis's fleet off Brest. Shortly afterwards Nelson's fleet returned from the West Indies, bringing 12 more ships, and Calder was given 18 ships, including Neptune, and sent back to Ferrol to search for Villeneuve. By now Villeneuve had put into Cadiz and Calder's force was ordered to join the hastily assembled British fleet under Vice-Admiral Cuthbert Collingwood, that was blockading the Franco-Spanish fleet at Cadiz. As the British fleet settled in for a long blockade Fremantle commented on Neptunes sailing qualities. She had the reputation of being slow, and Fremantle complained that he did not like being in 'a large ship that don't sail and must continually be late in action.' During the battle however, Midshipman William Baddock commented that 'The old Neptune, which never was a good sailer, took it into her head that morning to sail better than I <b>ever</b> <b>remember</b> to have seen her do before.' Neptune [...] went into the battle 18 men short of her complement.|$|E

2500|$|In {{his essay}} [...] "The Irish Priesthood and Politics" [...] Sheehan gives a succinct {{description}} {{of his time in}} Maynooth: [...] "I remember well that the impression made upon me by Maynooth College then, and afterwards, when I saw its long, stone corridors, its immense bare stony halls, the huge massive tables etc., was one of rude Cyclopean strength, without one single aspect or feature of refinement. So too with its studies. Rentless logic, with its formidable chevaux-de-frise of syllogisms, propositions, scholia; Metaphysics, sublime, but hardened into slabs of theories, congealed in medieval Latin; Physics, embracing a course that would have appalled a young Newton or Kepler; and then the vast shadow of four years' Divinity towering above and over-shadowing all!". The Maynooth literature course was hardly any better: [...] "The Graces were nowhere! Even in the English literature or Belles-Lettres class, as it was called, the course seemed to be limited to hard grinding Grammar, and nothing more. [...] During the first semestre, a few lectures were given on literature. All I can <b>ever</b> <b>remember</b> of that period were the words 'Lake Poets', which the good professor was forever repeating".|$|E
