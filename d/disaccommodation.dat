It seems that the <b>disaccommodation</b> due to carbon {{is larger than the}} effect due to a corresponding atomic percentage of nitrogen, although the contrary is true for internal friction. The ratio of the diffusion coefficients of 12 C and 13 C in pure iron has been determined, again by measuring the <b>disaccommodation.</b> We find a value of (1, 04 ± 0, 01) in agreement with a (m) - 1 / 2 relationship for the diffusion coefficient...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{ascertain}} {{whether there are differences}} in amplitude, latency, and peak velocity of accommodation and <b>disaccommodation</b> responses when different analysis strategies are used to compute them, such as fitting different functions to the responses or for smoothing them prior to computing the parameters. Accommodation and <b>disaccommodation</b> responses from four subjects to pulse changes in demand were recorded by means of aberrometry. Three different strategies were followed to analyze such responses: fitting an exponential function to the experimental data; fitting a Boltzmann sigmoid function to the data; and smoothing the data. Amplitude, latency, and peak velocity of the responses were extracted. Significant {{differences were found between the}} peak velocity in accommodation computed by fitting an exponential function and smoothing the experimental data (mean difference 2. 36 [*]D/s). Regarding <b>disaccommodation,</b> significant differences were found between latency and peak velocity, calculated with the two same strategies (mean difference of 0. 15 [*]s and − 3. 56 [*]D/s, resp.). The strategy used to analyze accommodation and <b>disaccommodation</b> responses seems to affect the parameters that describe accommodation and <b>disaccommodation</b> dynamics. These results highlight the importance of choosing the most adequate analysis strategy in each individual to obtain the parameters that characterize accommodation and <b>disaccommodation</b> dynamics...|$|E
40|$|AbstractDynamics of {{accommodation}} (far-to-near focus) and <b>disaccommodation</b> (near-to-far focus) {{are described as}} a function of response amplitude. Accommodative responses to step stimuli of various amplitudes presented in real space were measured in eight 20 – 30 year old subjects. Responses were fitted with exponential functions to determine amplitude, time constant and peak velocity. Despite the intersubject variability, the results show that time constants {{of accommodation}} and peak velocity of <b>disaccommodation</b> increase with amplitude in all subjects.

40|$|AbstractVelocity and {{acceleration}} characteristics {{provide valuable}} information about dynamic control of accommodation. We investigated velocity and acceleration of <b>disaccommodation</b> (near-far focusing) from three starting positions. Peak velocity and peak acceleration of <b>disaccommodation</b> increased with {{the proximity of}} starting position however for a given starting position they were invariant of response magnitude. These results suggest that all <b>disaccommodation</b> responses are initiated towards a constant primary destination and are switched mid-flight to attain the desired final position. Large discrepancies between the primary destination and desired final position appear to produce overshoots and oscillations of small responses from proximal starting positions...|$|E
40|$|The {{static and}} dynamic {{aspects of the}} pupil {{response}} associated with various amplitudes of far-to-near (accommodation) and near-to-far (<b>disaccommodation)</b> focusing responses were evaluated in this study. Dynamic refractive and pupillary changes were measured simultaneously during focusing responses to targets at real distances in 12 young (23 – 26 years) emmetropic subjects. The targets were presented alternately at far (6 m) and at one of six near positions from 1 D (1 m) to 6 D (16. 7 cm) in 1 D steps. The latency, magnitude and peak velocity of pupil changes associated with accommodation and <b>disaccommodation</b> responses were calculated. The latency of refractive changes was shorter than that of pupillary changes. In general, the pupil constricted with accommodation and started dilating while accommodation was still maintained, resulting in reduced pupil dilation with <b>disaccommodation.</b> The magnitude of the pupil response increased linearly with that of accommodation and <b>disaccommodation.</b> The amount of pupil change per dioptre of refractive change was invariant with various amplitudes of refractive change. The peak velocity of pupil constriction was {{greater than that of}} pupil dilation for corresponding amplitudes. The pupil response is more closely associated with accommodation than with <b>disaccommodation...</b>|$|E
40|$|AbstractDynamic {{properties}} and control strategies of step responses by accommodation and <b>disaccommodation</b> differ from one another. Peak velocity of accommodation increases with response magnitude, while peak velocity and peak acceleration of <b>disaccommodation</b> increase with starting position. These dynamic properties can be modeled as control strategies that use independent acceleration-pulse and velocity-step components that are integrated respectively into phasic-velocity signals that control movement and tonic-position signals that control magnitude. Accommodation is initiated toward its final destination by an acceleration-pulse whose width increases with response magnitude to increase peak velocity. <b>Disaccommodation</b> is initiated toward a default destination (the far point) by an acceleration-pulse whose height increases with dioptric {{distance of the}} starting position to increase peak velocity and peak acceleration. Both responses are completed and maintained by tonic-position signals whose amplitudes are proportional to the final destination. Mismatched amplitudes of phasic-velocity and tonic-position signals in <b>disaccommodation</b> produce unstable step responses...|$|E
40|$|Low-temperature viscous {{acquisition}} and decay measurements {{above and below}} the Verwey transition have been carried out for a selection of natural and synthetic multidomain magnetite samples. A strong correlation between the viscosity spectra and published <b>disaccommodation</b> spectra was found, where <b>disaccommodation</b> reflects electron mobility. Assuming the viscosity is controlled by identical mechanisms as <b>disaccommodation,</b> the reduction in electron mobility below the Verwey transition is found to significantly increase viscous {{acquisition and}} decay rates over the time scales measured (1 – 3000 s). Although strongly affecting the viscosity, <b>disaccommodation</b> processes do not appear to control the rate of change of viscosity with time, i. e. the viscosity curvature. It is suggested that the curvature is controlled by the shape of relaxation-time distributions, which is approximately the same for all the magnetite samples studied. In addition, the acquisition and decay curvature parameters mirror each other when plotted as a function of temperature, inferring that at any given temperature, the acquisition and decay processes are identical...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAge related {{changes in}} the {{dynamics}} of accommodation (far to near focus) and <b>disaccommodation</b> (near to far focus) are reported in this study. Dynamic responses to step stimulus demands from 1 D to 6 D, in 1 D steps, were recorded with a PowerRefractor in 66 subjects in the age range 14 – 45 years. The accommodative and disaccommodative responses were fit with exponential functions to calculate response amplitude, time constant and peak velocity. The latency of accommodation did not change and the latency of <b>disaccommodation</b> increased with age. For accommodation, time constant increased and peak velocity decreased with age. For <b>disaccommodation,</b> no change in time constant or peak velocity was found with age. The form of the peak velocity vs response amplitude relationship (main sequence) of accommodation changed with age. The differences in the dynamics of accommodation and <b>disaccommodation</b> with age are discussed {{with reference to the}} age related {{changes in the}} eye leading to presbyopia...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{dynamics}} of Edinger–Westphal (EW) stimulated accommodation were studied in two young rhesus monkeys {{to understand the}} relationships between accommodative amplitude and rates of accommodation and <b>disaccommodation.</b> Accommodative responses were recorded with infrared photorefraction at five different amplitudes spanning the full EW stimulated accommodative range available to each eye. Combined exponential and polynomial functions were fit to the accommodation and <b>disaccommodation</b> responses. Derivatives of these functions provided the maximum rates of accommodation and <b>disaccommodation</b> as well as time constants for each amplitude. Maximum rates of EW stimulated accommodation and <b>disaccommodation</b> were found to increase linearly with amplitudes from 0. 58 to 17. 41 D in the two monkeys. The results suggests {{that the rate of}} EW stimulated accommodation is dictated by the amplitude. We conclude that if dynamic accommodative responses are to be compared in monkeys of different ages it is necessary to compare responses for the same accommodative amplitudes in order to draw conclusions about age related changes...|$|E
40|$|AbstractPeak {{velocity}} and peak acceleration of <b>disaccommodation</b> step responses remain invariant of response magnitude for a constant starting position and they increase linearly with proximity of starting position. This suggests that <b>disaccommodation</b> response is initiated towards an initial (default) destination and is switched mid-flight {{to attain the}} desired final destination. The dioptric location of initial destination was estimated from the x-intercept of regression of peak velocity on response starting position. The x-intercept correlated well with subject’s cycloplegic refractive state and poorly with their dark focus of accommodation. Altering the dark focus by inducing fatigue in the accommodative system did not alter the x-intercept. These observations suggest that cycloplegic refractive state is a good behavioral correlate of initial destination of <b>disaccommodation</b> step responses...|$|E

The shift in the peak down from the usual 10 °C is due to a lowering of the activation energy from 0. 85 to 0. 7 eV, and this decrease is attributed to the effect of electrostatic forces between the quadrivalent ion and its neighbours. The absence of the high temperature peak, process II, is consistent with the localization of the ferrous ions.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} the dynamic changes in refraction during the accommodative facility test in myopes and emmetropes. METHODS: Ten myopes and 10 emmetropes {{participated in the}} study. All were young adults, and refractive error in the myopes was corrected with soft contact lenses. Monocular accommodative facility measurements were taken for a 40 -cm and a 6 -m working distance with + 2. 00 /– 2. 00 -D and Plano/– 2. 00 -D flippers, respectively. Subjective facility was recorded with automated flippers and objective measurements of dynamic accommodation response were simultaneously taken with a photorefractor. RESULTS: Subjective and objective facility measurements showed a significantly lower facility rate in myopes when compared with emmetropes at distance (P 0. 05). The response amplitude of accommodation during facility tasks {{was found to be}} similar in the two refractive groups. However, the velocity of accommodation was found to be lower in myopes than in emmetropes for distance facility (P 0. 05). Velocity of <b>disaccommodation</b> was lower in myopes than in emmetropes at both distance and near (P < 0. 05). CONCLUSIONS: During distance accommodative facility testing, myopes exhibited a lower velocity of accommodation and <b>disaccommodation,</b> which led to a lower distance accommodative facility rate. For near facility measurements, however, although velocity of <b>disaccommodation</b> was lower in myopes, velocity of accommodation was found to be similar in the two refractive groups.

Postmortem human eyes obtained in the USA (n= 46, age= 6 – 83 years) and India (n= 91, age= 1 day– 85 years) were mounted in an optomechanical lens stretching system and dissected to expose the lens complete with its accommodating framework, including zonules, ciliary body, anterior vitreous and a segmented rim of sclera. <b>Disaccommodation</b> was simulated through radial stretching of the sectioned globe by 2 mm in increments of 0. 25 mm. The load, inner ciliary ring diameter, lens equatorial diameter, central thickness and power were measured at each step. Changes in these parameters were examined as a function of age, as were the dimension/load and power/load responses. Unstretched lens diameter and thickness increased over the whole age range examined and were indistinguishable from those of in vivo lenses as well as those of in vitro lenses freed from zonular attachments. Stretching increased the diameter and decreased the thickness in all lenses examined but the amount of change decreased with age. Unstretched lens power decreased with age and the accommodative amplitude decreased to zero by age 45 – 50. The load required to produce maximum stretch was independent of age (median 80 mN) whereas the change in lens diameter and power per unit load decreased significantly with age. The age related changes in the properties of human lenses, as observed in the lens stretching device, are similar to those observed in vivo and are consistent with the classical Helmholtz theory of accommodation. The response of lens diameter and power to disaccommodative (stretching) forces decreases with age, consistent with lens nuclear stiffening...|$|E

40|$|Viscous {{magnetization}} (VM) and viscous remanent magnetization (VRM) {{have been}} measured, {{as a function}} of temperature, between room temperature and the Curie temperature using a suite of well-characterized synthetic and natural multidomain (MD) magnetite samples. Particular attention was given to possible diffusion aftereffects such as dislocation creep (stress relaxation) and <b>disaccommodation</b> (vacancy and ionic reordering) and their contribution to viscous behavior in what has been commonly thought of as a purely thermal fluctuation process. Dislocation creep was examined by measuring viscosity before and after annealing. Annealing was found to reduce the non-log(t) behavior, where t is time. Non-log(t) behavior has been associated with diffusion aftereffects, suggesting that these are a major contributor to viscosity and (de) magnetization processes in MD samples. The positive curvature of the non-log(t) acquisition processes indicates that dislocation creep dominates over <b>disaccommodation.</b> This does not imply that VM and VRM are due solely to dislocation creep, but rather that VRM and VM reflect a number of unrelated temperature-dependent processes, primarily thermal fluctuations and dislocation creep. This {{is the first time that}} dislocation creep has been directly identified as contributing to viscosity at temperature. These findings will have particular implications for paleointensity determinations, as on heating a sample, its dislocation structure may relax, giving rise to demagnetizations not associated with thermal fluctuations.

40|$|This report {{presents}} a computer-animated {{model of the}} structures of accommodation based on new understanding of the anatomy of the zonular apparatus integrated with current understanding of the mechanism of accommodation. Analysis of this model suggests a new, consolidated theory of the mechanism of accommodation including a new theory of reciprocal zonular action. A three-dimensional animated model of the eye in accommodation and <b>disaccommodation</b> was produced in collaboration with an experienced medical animator. Current understanding of the anatomy of the zonule and the attachments of the vitreous zonule to the anterior hyaloid membrane is incomplete. Recent studies have demonstrated three components of the vitreous zonule: (1) anterior vitreous zonule (previously “hyalocapsular” zonule), which attaches the ciliary plexus in the valleys of the ciliary processes to the anterior hyaloid membrane in the region medial to the ciliary body and Weiger’s ligament; (2) intermediate vitreous zonule, which attaches the ciliary plexus to the anterior hyaloid peripherally; and (3) posterior vitreous zonule, which creates a sponge-like ring at the attachment zone that anchors the pars plana zonules. The pars plana zonules attach posteriorly to the elastic choroid above the ora serrata. Analysis of the computer-animated model demonstrates the synchronized movements of the accommodative structures in accommodation and <b>disaccommodation.</b> Utilizing model-based reasoning, it is shown that the posterior zonules attach to and provide traction to the anterior vitreous membrane and Weiger’s ligament. This model supports the concept that the ciliary body/zonule/anterior hyaloid complex contributes to {{the changes in the}} posterior lens capsule during accommodation, supporting an extralenticular component to accommodation and demonstrating an alternative to the “vitreous support” theories. There is a reciprocal action of the anterior zonules and the posterior zonules. During ciliary body contraction, the anterior zonules lose tension while the posterior zonules stretch and exert force on the posterior lens capsule playing a role in shaping the posterior lens thickness and curvature. During ciliary body relaxation, the posterior zonules lose tension as the lens flattens and is pulled back by the increasing tension of the anterior zonules...|$|E
