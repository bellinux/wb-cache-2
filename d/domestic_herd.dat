60|$|At {{a little}} village (Ozumba) {{near the base}} of Popocatapetl, where we purposed to {{commence}} the ascent, we procured guides and two pack mules with forage for our horses. High up on the mountain there was a deserted house of one room, called the Vaqueria, which had been occupied years before by men in charge of cattle ranging on the mountain. The pasturage up there was very fine when we saw it, and there were still some cattle, descendants of the former <b>domestic</b> <b>herd,</b> which had now become wild. It was possible to go on horseback {{as far as the}} Vaqueria, though the road was somewhat hazardous in places. Sometimes it was very narrow with a yawning precipice on one side, hundreds of feet down to a roaring mountain torrent below, and almost perpendicular walls on the other side. At one of these places one of our mules loaded with two sacks of barley, one on each side, the two about as big as he was, struck his load against the mountain-side and was precipitated to the bottom. The descent was steep but not perpendicular. The mule rolled over and over until the bottom was reached, and we supposed of course the poor animal was dashed to pieces. What was our surprise, not long after we had gone into bivouac, to see the lost mule, cargo and owner coming up the ascent. The load had protected the animal from serious injury; and his owner had gone after him and found a way back to the path leading up to the hut where we were to stay.|$|E

30|$|The {{emergence}} of new demands on the ‘Minimum Viable Population rule’ eventually led to significant management change within the Payette National Forest. In 2010, the Forest Service issued a Record of Decision to cancel 70 % of the grazing allotments on the Payette National Forest {{in order to achieve}} separation of bighorns and domestic sheep. Due to the inability to prove that disease transmission would not occur if the Forest Service maintained the leases, the agency could not guarantee a minimum viable population for the bighorn and, thus, began canceling grazing permits for allotments in the Payette with the plan to phase in additional cancellations. Ambiguity remains as to whether all affected allotments constitute habitat and range for bighorns. The agency has also required additional on-the-ground management strategies (e.g., daily global positioning system records of each <b>domestic</b> <b>herd).</b>|$|E

40|$|Theoretical {{models of}} {{interaction}} between wild and domestic reindeer (Rangifer tarandus; caribou in North America) can help explain observed social-ecological dynamics of arctic hunting and husbandry systems. Different modes of hunting and husbandry incorporate strategies to mitigate effects of differing patterns of environmental uncertainty. Simulations of simple models of harvested wild and domestic herds with density-dependent recruitment show that random environmental variation produces cycles and crashes in populations that would quickly stabilize at a steady state with nonrandom parameters. Different husbandry goals lead to radically different long-term <b>domestic</b> <b>herd</b> sizes. Wild and domestic herds are typically ecological competitors but social complements. Hypothesized differences in ecological competition and diverse human livelihoods are explored in dynamic social-ecological models in which domestic herds competitively interact with wild herds. These models generate a framework for considering issues {{in the evolution of}} Human-Rangifer Systems, such as state-subsidized herding and the use of domestic herds for transportation support in hunting systems. Issues considered include the role of geographic factors, markets for Rangifer products, state-subsidized herding, effects of changes in husbandry goals on fate of wild herds, and how environmental shocks, herd population cycles, and policy shifts might lead to system state changes. The models also suggest speculation on the role of geographic factors in the failure of reindeer husbandry to take hold in the North American Arctic. The analysis concludes with suggested empirical strategies for estimating parameters of the model for use in comparative studies across regions of the Arctic...|$|E
40|$|Many Neolithic {{settlements}} in southwest Asia maintained economic dependence on domestic caprine herds over long periods. This thesis explores {{the success of}} sheep herding in one 1200 year-old Neolithic settlement – Çatalhöyük, Central Anatolia (7400 – 6200 cal. BC). The evidence from two datasets is used to expand knowledge of the seasonal management of domestic sheep herds and their food resources. Successful herding is {{measured in terms of}} being able to maintain good husbandry practices whilst meeting the needs of the settlement. Samples of archaeological sheep’s teeth from Çatalhöyük are used in two ways: sequential oxygen isotope values from a sheep’s second mandibular molar give seasonality evidence {{during the first year of}} a sheep’s life, and are used to establish the birth season and mobility patterns over the year. Dental microwear analysis of the same tooth’s occlusal surface provides evidence of the dietary regime in the last few weeks of that sheep’s life, and is used to distinguish the type and quality of diet before slaughter. Together, the data outline a life history for each sheep, and are used to reveal the pattern of herding control and food resource manipulation. Çatalhöyük is within the habitat of wild sheep, where palaeoenvironmental modelling suggests that <b>domestic</b> <b>herd</b> management could have proceeded in the wider landscape with minimal niche construction. However settlement demands, both economic and social, might have prompted more convenient solutions, reliant on more extensive niche construction in a more limited local environment. The herders’ ability, or commitment, to maintaining best husbandry practices is explored by bringing the ethology of sheep to an interpretation of how environmental possibilities might have been utilized...|$|E
40|$|River buffalo are {{economically}} {{important to}} many countries and only recently has their genome been explored {{for the purpose}} of mapping genetic variation in traits of economic and biologic interest. The purpose of this research is to characterize the genetic and evolutionary profile of Toll-like receptor 5 (TLR 5), which mediates the mammalian innate immune response to bacterial flagellin. This study is comprised of three parts: 1) generating a radiation hybrid (RH) map of river buffalo chromosome 5 (BBU 5) where the TLR 5 gene is located and building a comparative map with homologous cattle chromosomes; 2) conducting a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) survey of the TLR 5 gene to reveal variation within river buffalo and other species; and 3) performing an evolutionary study by inferring phylogenetic trees of TLR 5 across multiple taxa and determining the possible evolutionary constraints within the TLR 5 coding region. River buffalo chromosome 5 is a bi-armed chromosome with arms corresponding to cattle chromosomes 16 and 29. A BBU 5 RH map was developed using the previously published river buffalo RH mapping panel and cattle-derived markers. The RH map developed in this study became {{an integral part of the}} first river buffalo whole genome RH map. Genetic variation of the TLR 5 gene was evaluated in a small <b>domestic</b> <b>herd</b> of river buffalo. Sequencing of the TLR 5 coding region and partial associated 5 '- and 3 '-untranslated regions yielded 16 novel SNPs. Six SNPs were identified as non-synonymous with one predicted to potentially code for a functionally altered product. For the evolutionary study of the TLR 5 coding region, phylogenetic trees were inferred based on TLR 5 variation across multiple orders and another for artiodactyla. Species that are closely related to river buffalo appear to have undergone negative selection in TLR 5 while those that diverged from river buffalo earlier may be retaining alleles that river buffalo are removing from the population. In conclusion, putative chromosomal rearrangements were identified between river buffalo and cattle, the variation that was uncovered in the TLR 5 coding region could potentially lead to differential immunity across species, and there appears be some evolutionary flexibility in the DNA sequence of the TLR 5 coding region...|$|E

40|$|The <b>domestic</b> goat <b>herds</b> {{maintained}} by the Samburu, nomadic pastoralists living in northern Kenya, are observed from a socio-ecological point of view. This study attempts to examine {{the characteristics of the}} <b>domestic</b> goat <b>herd</b> and to discuss its origin. Firstly, the interaction between man and goats in day-trip herding is described, and it is conjectured that there is some kind of cohesiveness between individuals within the herd. This is confirmed by the observations of ~ oriented behavior; stray goats autonomously going back to the herd without human management. These observations show that primarily goats gather in herds and herders assist goats in gathering together. Secondly, two examples of inter-herd relations show that goats distinguish their own herd from another and have a tendency to keep in contact with their own herd. The herd is thus discernible during inter-herd encounters. Therefore it is concluded that the <b>domestic</b> goat <b>herd</b> is a sociologically stable unit, a discernible congregation with constant membership. The feral goats of Chichijima, however, does not form a stable group, and it is highly probable that the wild goat does not form one either. All these factors suggest and support the hypothesis that, the stable <b>domestic</b> goat <b>herd</b> was formed with the influence of man during the process of domestication...|$|R

40|$|Although {{there is}} little doubt that the {{domestication}} of mammals was instrumental for the modernization of human societies, even basic features of the path towards domestication remain largely unresolved for many species. Reindeer are considered to be in the early phase of domestication with wild and <b>domestic</b> <b>herds</b> still coexisting widely across Eurasia. This provides a unique model system for understanding how the early domestication process may have taken place. We analysed mitochondrial sequences and nuclear microsatellites in <b>domestic</b> and wild <b>herds</b> throughout Eurasia to address the origin of reindeer herding and domestication history. Our data demonstrate independent origins of domestic reindeer in Russia and Fennoscandia. This implies that the Saami people of Fennoscandia domesticated their own reindeer independently of the indigenous cultures in western Russia. We also found that augmentation of local reindeer herds by crossing with wild animals has been common. However, some wild reindeer populations have not contributed to the domestic gene pool, suggesting variation in domestication potential among populations. These differences may explain why geographically isolated indigenous groups have been able to make the technological shift from mobile hunting to large-scale reindeer pastoralism independently...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background International trade {{regulations}} require that countries document their livestock's sanitary status {{in general and}} freedom from specific infective agents in detail provided that import restrictions should be applied. The latter is generally achieved by large national serological surveys and risk assessments. The paper describes the basic structure and application of a generic stochastic model for risk-based sample size calculation of consecutive national surveys to document freedom from contagious disease agents in livestock. Methods In the model, disease spread during the time period between two consecutive surveys was considered, either from undetected infections within the domestic population or from imported infected animals. The @Risk model consists of the domestic spread in-between two national surveys; the infection of <b>domestic</b> <b>herds</b> from animals imported from countries with a sanitary status comparable to Switzerland or lower sanitary status and the summary sheet which summed up the numbers of resulting infected herds of all infection pathways to derive the pre-survey prevalence in the domestic population. Thereof the pre-survey probability of freedom from infection and required survey sample sizes were calculated. A scenario for detection of infected herds by general surveillance was included optionally. Results The model {{highlights the importance of}} residual domestic infection spread and characteristics of different import pathways. The sensitivity analysis revealed that number of infected, but undetected <b>domestic</b> <b>herds</b> and the multiplicative between-survey-spread factor were most correlated with the pre-survey probability of freedom from infection and the resulting sample size, respectively. Compared to the deterministic pre-cursor model, the stochastic model was therefore more sensitive to the previous survey's results. Undetected spread of infection in the domestic population between two surveys gained more importance than infection through animals of either import pathway. Conclusion The model estimated the pre-survey probability of freedom from infection accurately as was shown in the case of infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (IBR). With this model, a generic tool becomes available which can be adapted to changing conditions related to either importing or exporting countries. </p...|$|R

5|$|Domestication is {{also studied}} {{by using the}} genetic {{material}} of present-day horses and comparing it with the genetic material present in the bones and teeth of horse remains found in archaeological and palaeological excavations. The variation in the genetic material shows that very few wild stallions contributed to the domestic horse, while many mares were part of early domesticated herds. This {{is reflected in the}} difference in genetic variation between the DNA that is passed on along the paternal, or sire line (Y-chromosome) versus that passed on along the maternal, or dam line (mitochondrial DNA). There are very low levels of Y-chromosome variability, but a great deal of genetic variation in mitochondrial DNA.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Experience in the Soviet Union and Alaska {{indicates}} that the major poten-tial conflicts between domestic reindeer and their wild counterparts (both caribou and reindeer are of the same species, Rangifer tarandus) are: (I) Loss of domestic reindeer to wild herds. Although this can be reduced under close herding, {{it is still a}} serious problem wherever wild reindeer or caribou and domestic reindeer coexist. Domestic reindeer joining wild herds appear to have low breeding success and therefore probably have little genetic influence on the larger wild populations. (2) Competition for forage between domestic reindeer and wild herds, which is primarily restricted to the winter range. Herded reindeer feed more intensively than the wild, free-ranging animals and therefore their effect on range forage is greater. (3) Diseases and parasites may be readily transmitted between domestic reindeer and their wild counterparts. However, most diseases and parasites common to the species are endemic to both wild and <b>domestic</b> <b>herds.</b> RÉSUMÉ.

40|$|Cattle, {{sheep and}} goat were domesticated in the Near-East during the 9 th {{millennium}} BC. From there, {{sheep and goat}}, which had no wild ancestors in Europe, were introduced to this continent {{at the beginning of}} the 7 th millennium B. C. and diffused following two main flows: a southern route along the northern coastline of the Mediterranean, and a northern route across central Europe following the Danubian corridor. Possible scenarios of migration have been complicated to investigate regarding cattle, as the species had a possible wild ancestor in Europe: the local aurochs, whose disappearance only occurred at the end of the 17 th century A. D. and whose remains are hardly distinguishable from those of the early domestic forms on the basis of classical osteometry. A tight cooperation between Archaeozoology and Genetics has provided, in the frame of several publicly funded projects (among which the OMLL scheme), substantial new data allowing refinement of historical scenarios to a degree never achieved thus far. We were able to demonstrate that local aurochs did not contribute, or contributed to a very limited extent, to the constitution of European <b>domestic</b> cattle <b>herds,</b> whose origin can be clearly traced back to the Near East. Thus, from this point of view, domestic cattle biogeographical history is very similar to sheep and goat, and their appearance in Europe probably owes more to farming pioneers than to local hunter-gatherers. Analyses of goat aDNA revealed the preservation of an important genetic diversity very far from the diffusion centre. This is suggestive of the persistence of gene flow between <b>domestic</b> <b>herds</b> across the dispersion area along the different diffusion routes, which prevented the occurrence of severe bottleneck effects. This diversity also indicates that the existence of contacts between farming groups encompassed very large areas. It is very interesting to note that recent works published on domestication and diffusion of pig in Neolithic Europe have proposed very different scenarios. This highlights the specificity of domestic bovids as tracers of human contacts, exchanges and displacements during the Neolithicisation of Europe...|$|R
