40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is fish species {{identification}} using acoustic target strength (TS). Insitu measurement has been deployed at the South China Sea of Terengganu Malaysia using Furuno FQ- 80 Scientific Echo Sounder which included in the research vessel of KK Senangin II. The transducer isplaced 2. 8 meter under sea surface while fish put in the net cage under the vessel. TS data have beencollected independently for commercial fish in Malaysia, there are Selar boops (Oxeye scad), Alepesdjedaba (Shrimp scad), Megalaspis cordyla (Torpedo scad), and Decapterus maruadsi/b> (<b>Japanese</b> <b>scad).</b> TS value, depth, and position of specific target have been observed using echogram. TS of every speciesis different although similar size and at the similar range from transducer. Thus, the specific fish specieshas been identified based on its acoustic target strength...|$|E

Of the factors that may influence the {{spatial distribution}} on the feeding ground and sub-sequent diet composition is the fish maturation stage. Using hairtail (Trichiurus japonicus) as an example, we evaluated the impacts of gonad development stage on diet composition. Hairtail supports one of the most valuable and largest fisheries in the East China Sea. As one of the top predators, it plays an important role in the ecosystem. We analyzed hairtail stomach samples collected on their feeding grounds from a fisheries-independent survey program in September 2005. Our analyses suggest that females in their third maturity stage tended to feed more intensively. Fish were the most important preys for hairtail, accounting for 72. 6 % of the total stomach contents in weight. The four most important fish species were juvenile hairtail (25. 2 %), <b>Japanese</b> <b>scad</b> (11. 4 %), Japanese jack mackerel (7. 7 %), and small yellow croaker (5. 9 %), suggesting strong cannibalism. A cluster analysis suggests that hairtail could be divided into three groups in their spatial distribution based on their diets: one group with similar percentages of fish and crustacean preys mainly distributed in the south of East China Sea far from the coast; one group mainly consuming fish and distributed over the north of East China Sea near the coast; and the third group consuming mainly crustacean species mainly distributed in the open sea. We hypothesize that gonadal development stage of hairtail may deter-mine their movement from spawning ground to feeding ground, and subsequently spatial distribution on the feeding ground, which in turn results in different feeding intensities and prey compositions...|$|E
