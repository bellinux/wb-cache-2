5|$|Despite its rapid {{gains and}} popular backing, the new {{administration}} was marked by conflicts between the radical wing and more conservative forces, especially {{over the issue of}} land reform. Two successive abortive coups were able to weaken the Government, and its international status was always contested by Russia. After managing to rally a degree of sympathy from Ottoman political leaders, the Revolution was ultimately isolated by the intervention of Russian diplomats, and ultimately repressed by a common intervention of Ottoman and Russian armies, without any significant form of armed resistance. Nevertheless, over the following decade, the completion of its goals was made possible by the <b>international</b> <b>context,</b> and former revolutionaries became the original political class in united Romania.|$|E

5|$|The 8 March Revolution {{has often}} been viewed as a mere {{military}} coup, but it had many of the ingredients of national revolts from below. The revolution was led by an anti-oligarchical alliance of a radicalised lower middle class, strategic members of the officer corps, marginalised minorities and {{a significant number of}} peasants who were mobilised for agrarian conflict. In an <b>international</b> <b>context,</b> the revolution took place because the state boundaries established by France were artificial and the hostility within the newly established Syria to the creation of Israel. The traditional elite that took power in Syria when the country gained independence had come to power during the French Mandate of Syria and Lebanon. The external imposition of arbitrary state boundaries on Syria with no corresponding popular acceptance led to discontent. The national struggle was shaped by ideologies such as Arab nationalism, pan-Islamism and Greater Syrianism. The plebeian character of the struggle, and the radical ideologies, spawned radical solutions to the agrarian problem.|$|E

25|$|The New Zealand {{constitution}} is uncodified and {{is to be}} found in formal legal documents, in decisions of the courts, and in practices (some of which are described as conventions). It reflects and establishes that New Zealand is a monarchy, that it has a parliamentary system of government, and that it is a representative democracy. It increasingly reflects the fact that the Treaty of Waitangi is regarded as a founding document of government in New Zealand. The constitution must also be seen in its <b>international</b> <b>context,</b> because New Zealand governmental institutions must increasingly have regard to international obligations and standards.|$|E

40|$|In this {{collaborative}} self-study, two {{teacher educators}} examine their experiences {{of working in}} new <b>international</b> <b>contexts</b> {{and the impact of}} those experiences on their professional learning and identities. Mandi moved from a major research university in one country to another, while Judy co-led a group of pre-service teachers on an international practicum for three weeks each year for three years. Using the concept of boundary crossing as a theoretical and analytical framework, each teacher educator identified a boundary-related critical incident or experience that occurred during her work in new <b>international</b> <b>contexts.</b> Through individual and collaborative analysis of their critical incidents, they found that working as a teacher educator in new <b>international</b> <b>contexts</b> involves the crossing and re-crossing of multiple personal, professional, linguistic and cultural boundaries. Working in these boundary spaces involved learning how to negotiate new kinds of relationships with colleagues and students, manage changed roles and responsibilities and, ultimately, a search for a renewed sense of self, as each sought to understand herself differently within a new professional context...|$|R

25|$|Regardless of {{the actual}} impact of market {{integration}} on union density or on workers themselves, organized labor has been engaged {{in a variety of}} strategies to limit the agenda of globalization and to promote labor regulations in an <b>international</b> <b>context.</b> The most prominent example of this has been the opposition of labor groups to free trade initiatives such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the Dominican Republic-Central American Free Trade Agreement (DR-CAFTA). In both cases, unions expressed strong opposition to the agreements, but to some extent pushed for the incorporation of basic labor standards in the agreement if one were to pass.|$|E
25|$|In the autumn, {{following}} the successful Nazi German expansion into Central Europe {{which seemed to}} provide momentum for the Guard, and especially the <b>international</b> <b>context</b> provided by the Munich Agreement and the First Vienna Award, its clandestine leadership grew confident and published manifestos threatening King Carol. Those members of the Iron Guard who escaped or were omitted {{in the first place}} started a violent campaign throughout Romania, meant to coincide with Carol's visit to Hitler at the Berghof, as a way to prevent the tentative approach between Romania and Nazi Germany; confident that Hitler was not determined on supporting the Legion, and irritated by the incidents, Carol ordered the decapitation of the movement.|$|E
25|$|The {{standard}} Heckscher–Ohlin model {{assumes that}} the production functions are identical for all countries concerned. This means that all countries {{are in the same}} level of production and have the same technology, yet this is highly unrealistic. Technological gap between developed and developing countries is the main concern for the development of poor countries. The standard Heckscher–Ohlin model ignores all these vital factors when one wants to consider development of less developed countries in the <b>international</b> <b>context.</b> Even between developed countries, technology differs from industry to industry and firm to firm base. Indeed, this is the very basis of the competition between firms, inside the country and across the country. See the New Trade Theory in this article below.|$|E

25|$|The Congress {{believes}} that the Plan of Action formulated by the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment at Stockholm in 1972 will influence forestry development throughout {{the world in the}} years to come. Recognizing that in many countries declared forest policies are not in accord with new knowledge, new preoccupations and new aspirations, the Congress considers it is now urgent to redefine forest policies in view of these new circumstances. The Congress firmly {{believes that}}, whatever the political objectives, whatever the form of economic organization, whatever the present pattern of forest land tenure, governments are responsible for planning the continuous flow of the productive, protective and social goods and services from the forest, ensuring that the physical output and environmental benefits of the forests are available for the general welfare of their peoples now and for all time.
