The issue of antimicrobial residues in <b>foods</b> <b>of</b> <b>animal</b> <b>origin</b> has rarely been a serious concern in developing countries, in contrast to the situation in Europe. However, while the prevalence of veterinary drug residues in <b>foods</b> <b>of</b> <b>animal</b> <b>origin</b> is less than 1 % in Europe, in some African countries it can be as high as 94 %. Antimicrobial residues in <b>foods</b> <b>of</b> <b>animal</b> <b>origin</b> can cause allergies, cancer, alterations in the intestinal flora, bacterial resistance and the inhibition of fermentation in the dairy industry.

40|$|Book Chapter {{from the}} book:The Role of Livestock in Developing Communities: Enhancing Multifunctionality by Frans Swanepoel, Aldo Stroebel and Siboniso Moyo,In poor {{developing}} communities, livestock serve many functions including supply <b>of</b> <b>food,</b> fibre and draught power, income generation and enhancement of social status. The relationship among animal-source foods and human nutrition and health {{is complex and}} involves {{both positive and negative}} trade-offs and outcomes. The positive outcomes are mostly through their addressing malnutrition by supplying the essential nutrients that are lacking in plant-source foods. Among these are micronutrients such iron, zinc, vitamin B- 12, riboflavin and conjugated linoleic acids. In addition, supplementing the diet of pregnant women and children with <b>foods</b> <b>of</b> <b>animal</b> <b>origin</b> has resulted in improved maternal, foetal and child health outcomes such as successful births, reduced maternal mortality, increased prenatal growth rates and improved cognitive functions. There are potential risks associated with (over) consumption <b>of</b> <b>foods</b> <b>of</b> <b>animal</b> <b>origin</b> such as increased risks of cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and obesity. However, at moderate levels <b>of</b> intake, <b>foods</b> <b>of</b> <b>animal</b> <b>origin</b> do not pose such threats and recent research indicates that they may actually be beneficial in reducing these diseases. Livestock?s potential contribution to environmental pollution and to total greenhouse gas emissions is recognised, but it is limited in the production systems available to poor communities where the nutritional and health benefits that accrue from consumption <b>of</b> <b>foods</b> <b>of</b> <b>animal</b> <b>origin</b> greatly outweigh the danger posed by livestock.

40|$|Irrespective of the {{existence}} of potentially pathogenic organisms carried by <b>animals,</b> <b>foods</b> <b>of</b> <b>animal</b> <b>origin</b> remain the prime nutrition of humans world-wide. As such, food safety continues to be a global concern primarily to safeguard public health and to promote international trade. Application of integrated risk-based quality assurance procedures on-farm and at slaughterhouses plays a crucial role in controlling hazards associated with <b>foods</b> <b>of</b> <b>animal</b> <b>origin.</b> In the present paper we examine safety assurance systems and associated value chains for <b>foods</b> <b>of</b> <b>animal</b> <b>origin</b> based on historical audit results of some Southern African countries with thriving export trade in animal products, mainly to identify areas for improvement. Among the key deficiencies identified were: i) failure to keep pace with scientific advances related to the ever-changing food supply chain; ii) lack of effective national and regional intervention strategies to curtail pathogen transmission and evolution, notably the zoonotic Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli; and iii) a lack of effective methods to reduce contamination <b>of</b> <b>foods</b> <b>of</b> wildlife origin.

5000|$|Vitamin B12 is a {{bacterial}} product needed for cell division, {{the formation and}} maturation of red blood cells, the synthesis of DNA, and normal nerve function. A deficiency may cause megaloblastic anaemia and neurological damage, and, if untreated, may lead to death. The high content of folacin in vegetarian diets may mask the hematological symptoms of vitamin B12 deficiency, so it may go undetected until neurological signs in the late stages are evident, which can be irreversible, such as neuropsychiatric abnormalities, neuropathy, dementia and, occasionally, atrophy of optic nerves. Vegans are unable to obtain enough B12 from their diet because only <b>food</b> <b>of</b> <b>animal</b> <b>origin</b> contains sufficient amount of this vitamin for humans.

40|$|The National Residue Control Plan (NRCP) is a {{programme}} {{to monitor}} <b>food</b> <b>of</b> <b>animal</b> <b>origin</b> such as meat, {{milk and honey}} for residues of undesirable substances. Additionally, {{on the basis of}} the Import Control Plan (ICP), <b>food</b> <b>of</b> <b>animal</b> <b>origin</b> from countries outside of the EU is monitored. For residues of pharmacologically active substances and environmental contaminants such as heavy metals or dioxins, Maximum Residue Limits (MRLs) and Maximum Levels are set, which must not be exceeded in <b>food</b> <b>of</b> <b>animal</b> <b>origin.</b> The aim of food control as part of the NRCP and the ICP is, to check that these MRLs and Maxiumum Levels are complied with, to detect non-compliant use of substances (e. g. prohibited or non-allowed pharmacologically active substances) and to investigate the causes of increased levels of residues and contaminants. The Federal Office of Consumer Protection and Food Safety (BVL) has presented the findings from the 58998 samples which were monitored by the official control laboratories of the federal states as part of the NRCP 2012 and from the 1338 samples of the ICP in 2012. In 350 findings (0. 59 %) of the NRCP samples, residues and contaminants were noncompliant. The rate is thus lower than the findings of the year 2011 (0, 73 %). In 8 findings of the 1338 samples of the ICP the limit values for residues and contaminants were exceeded. Nevertheless, the rate of exceeded limit values decreased slightly for <b>food</b> <b>of</b> <b>animal</b> <b>origin</b> imported from countries outside of the EU. The Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) has assessed the risk of findings (NRCP, ICP) for human health in 2012. In order to estimate exposure levels for the various consumer groups, data of the National Nutrition Survey II were used. The BfR concludes that single or occasional consumption of monitored food (NRCP, ICP) in 2012 with non-compliant levels of residues of pharmacologically active substances and contaminants do not imply a risk to consumers...|$|E
