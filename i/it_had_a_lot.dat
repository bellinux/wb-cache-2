25|$|With the {{increased}} demand in urban living downtown, there was interest in converting the structure to residential uses. However, the complex was awash with asbestos, which {{would need to}} be removed before any remodeling could begin. The complex was also poorly configured for residential, as <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of floor space without windows, requiring demolition of some buildings. The two combinations made for an expensive reconversion.|$|E

The change in musical style can probably be attributed to this being initially intended to be a solo release by Topon, but was migrated over to the band when it was realized that another full-length release was not quite feasible.|$|E

The song departs from the dance theme of the album and deals with the difficulties of long-distance relationships. [...] "Miles Away" [...] is a melancholy electronic ballad, which, according to Madonna is autobiographical, and is inspired by her then husband Guy Ritchie. The relationship themed lyrics continue in the next track [...] "She's Not Me", which talks about Madonna being emulated by another woman, hence she utters the line [...] "She started dressing like me and talking like me, It freaked me out, She started calling you {{up in the middle}} of the night, What's that about?" ...|$|E

500|$|The R U Tuff Enuff album succeeded Reaction {{upon its}} release in July 1988. Jackson was more {{involved}} with {{the production of the}} album than she had been on her previous releases. She stated at the time of R U Tuff Enuffs distribution that the sound on the album differed from anything she had done previously. Jackson commented that the album was [...] "more versatile", while noting that it resembled other albums because <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of dance music. Two singles were released from the album and charted on the R singles chart: [...] "Plaything", which made it into the top 10, and the title track [...] "R U Tuff Enuff", which peaked at number 78. By mid-June 1988, R U Tuff Enuff had reportedly sold 300,000 copies. MTV later concluded that the album [...] "struggled".

Jackson later stated that she performed around the world during this hiatus.|$|E

"I {{wanted to}} put two {{characters}} of flesh and bone {{in the middle of}} all these artificial creatures," [...] Henson explained, [...] "and David Bowie embodies a certain maturity, with his sexuality, his disturbing aspect, all sorts of things that characterize the adult world". Henson met David Bowie in the summer of 1983 to seek his involvement, as Bowie was in the U.S. for his Serious Moonlight Tour at the time. Henson continued to pursue Bowie for the role of Jareth, and sent him each revised draft of the film's script for his comments. During a meeting that took place on June 18, 1984, Henson showed Bowie The Dark Crystal and a selection of Brian Froud's concept drawings to pique his interest in the project. Bowie formally agreed to take part on February 15, 1985, several months before filming began. Discussing why he chose to be involved in the film, Bowie explained, [...] "I'd always wanted to be involved in the music-writing aspect of a movie that would appeal to children of all ages, as well as everyone else, and I must say that Jim gave me a completely free hand with it. The script itself was terribly amusing without being vicious or spiteful or bloody, and <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> more heart in it than many other special effects movies. So I was pretty hooked from the beginning." ...|$|E

I couldn't make head or tail of it; I thought it all twaddle. You've no idea what sort of letters Uncle Rad gets {{sometimes}} from every kind of lunatic or scoundrel you can think of, who wants to get something out of him. Well, this letter at first looked to me the same sort of thing. I had never heard of any one who had the right to say 'dear uncle' to Uncle Rad--but <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> in it about blood being thicker than water and all the rest of it, with a kind of request for justice and talk about the cruelty of Fate. The writer, however, asserted positively that he was the only legitimate son of Mr. Arthur de Mountford, who--this he professed to have only heard recently--was own brother to the earl of Radclyffe. The story which he went on to relate at full length was queer enough in all conscience. I remember every word of it, for it seemed to get right away into my brain, then and there, as if something was being hammered or screwed straight into one of the cells of my memory never really to come out again." ...|$|E
