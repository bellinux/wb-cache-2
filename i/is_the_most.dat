5|$|Although 247Bk <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> {{stable isotope}} of berkelium, its {{production}} in nuclear reactors is very inefficient {{due to the}} long half-life of its potential progenitor curium-247, which does not allow it sufficient time to beta decay before capturing another neutron. Thus, 249Bk <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> accessible isotope of berkelium, which still, is available only in small quantities (only 0.66grams have been produced in the US over the period 1967–1983) at a high price of the order 185 USD per microgram.|$|E

50|$|The Sally Lightfoot crab, the periwinkle, {{the common}} West Indian Chiton, the rock boring urchin, and <b>the</b> brown booby <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> {{affected}} (least resilient)species after the spill. The Sally Lightfoot crab <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> affected crustacean after the spill. This crustacean <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> affected because it <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> abundant of all crustaceans in the area.

Of all sea urchins observed after the spill, the rock-boring urchin fared the worst. Rock-boring urchins <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> affected organism compared to all observed species after the spill, as they accounted for 29% of all recorded affected species. Of all birds observed after the spill <b>the</b> brown booby <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> affected. <b>The</b> main reason that most of these species <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> affected after <b>the</b> spill <b>was</b> simply because they <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> abundant species located in the spill area.
