Goldstucker suffered no repercussions, and Dubček instead began to build a sense of trust among the media, the government, and the citizens. It was under Goldstücker that the journal's name was changed to Literární listy, and on 29 February 1968, the Writers’ Union published the first copy of the censor-free Literární listy.

5|$|In July 1999, the Communist Party {{initiated}} {{a campaign to}} persecute Falun Gong, including {{through the use of}} extralegal imprisonment, torture and other coercive measures, and propaganda. Falun Gong communities inside and outside China have adopted a variety of approaches to resist and mitigate the persecution in China. These tactics range from engagement with the media, lobbying of governments and NGOs, public protests and demonstrations, and attempts to seek legal redress. As the persecution in China progressed, overseas Falun Gong efforts increasingly tied their pleas for relief to Western human rights discourse, emphasizing the implications <b>for</b> <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> speech, assembly, and conscience.|$|E
5|$|Singapore's {{political}} {{model has}} been described as a representative democracy, and Singaporeans have constitutional rights to freedom of speech and assembly under Articles 14(1)(a) and (b) of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore. The constitutional rights to free speech and assembly extend only to Singapore citizens. Hence, the Singapore Court of Appeal has held that non-citizens enjoy only common law free speech. Articles 14(1)(a) and (b) are then subject to Articles 14(2)(a) and (b) which allow Parliament to impose, by law, restrictions on the rights to freedom of speech and assembly. The grounds for restrictions are, <b>for</b> <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> speech, Singapore's security, friendly relations with other states, public order, public morality, protecting parliamentary privilege, defamation, contempt of court and incitement to any criminal offence; and <b>for</b> <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> assembly, public order only. These restrictions made it a lengthy and difficult process to obtain the licence required to address a public gathering.|$|E

5|$|Dougan succeeded Terry Neill – {{his future}} Northern Ireland manager – as {{chairman}} of the Professional Footballers' Association (PFA) in 1970. He advocated the belief that players should control their own destiny and used his position as Chairman of the PFA to further players' rights. He oversaw the inaugural PFA awards in 1973–74, which included the PFA Players' Player of the Year, PFA Young Player of the Year, PFA Team of the Year, and PFA Merit Award. He pushed <b>for</b> <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> contract for players, and in 1978 accepted a compromise deal that allowed players to switch clubs {{at the end of their}} contracts, providing that the player's new club and old club could agree on a transfer fee, with a tribunal agreeing on a fee in cases where clubs could not agree.|$|E

5|$|Ethan Allen {{was born}} in Litchfield, Connecticut, the first-born child of Joseph and Mary Baker Allen, both of English and Puritan descent. The family moved {{to the town of}} Cornwall shortly after his birth. The move to Cornwall grew out of Allen's father's quest <b>for</b> <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> {{religion}} during a time of turmoil: the Great Awakening, when Puritans were separating into churches with differing dogmas, in particular about the proper form of conversion: by works or by grace. His lifelong interest in philosophy and ideas emerged against the backdrop of his father's involvement in these Puritan debates and his father's refusal to convert to the covenant by grace. As a boy Allen already excelled at quoting the Bible and was known for disputing the meaning of passages.|$|E
5|$|Judge Kevin McNulty {{heard the}} case on remand. After {{considering}} the parties' motions for summary judgment again, he ruled in the city's favor in 2014. Heffernan, he ruled, had not engaged in any protected speech or expressive conduct. Judge McNulty also ruled that Heffernan could not prevail on claims that his perceived speech was protected, per Ambrose v. Robinson Township, a previous case on that issue in the Third Circuit, or that his actions were protected since they aided and abetted speech. Judge McNulty also rejected similar claims <b>for</b> <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> association. He decided that Dye v. Office of the Racing Commission, {{a case in which}} the Sixth Circuit had held that the First Amendment reached perceived political association, was not a precedent he could rely on since Dye itself explicitly rejected Ambrose, and as a district judge he could not reject circuit precedent.|$|E
5|$|On September 22, Yoko Ono {{awarded the}} band the {{biennial}} LennonOno Grant for Peace, stating that {{she intended to}} work for the group’s immediate release. In October 2012, Pussy Riot was announced as a finalist for the European Parliament’s Sakharov Prize <b>for</b> <b>Freedom</b> <b>of</b> Thought, named for Soviet dissident Andrei Sakharov. The prize ultimately went to Iranian human rights lawyer Nasrin Sotoudeh and filmmaker Jafar Panahi. The city of Wittenberg, where Martin Luther nailed his Ninety Five Theses to the church door, nominated Pussy Riot for its annual Martin Luther “Fearless Speech” prize. The nomination provoked opposition from many theology experts, including leadership of the Evangelical Church in Germany (EKD). In November the prize was awarded to a group of Regensburg restaurateurs for an anti-Nazi campaign.|$|E

5|$|Supporters {{said that}} the {{publication}} of the cartoons was a legitimate exercise of free speech regardless of the validity of the expression, {{that it was important to}} openly discuss Islam without fear or that the cartoons made important points about topical issues. The Danish tradition of relatively high tolerance <b>for</b> <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> speech became a focus of some attention. The controversy ignited a debate about the limits of freedom of expression in all societies, religious tolerance and the relationship of Muslim minorities with their broader societies in the West, and relations between the Islamic World in general and the West. Critics of the cartoons described them as Islamophobic, racist, or baiting and blasphemous to Muslims, possibly intended to humiliate a Danish minority. Others saw them as a manifestation of ignorance about the history of Western imperialism, double standards, and stereotyping.|$|E
5|$|The book starts by {{quoting the}} First Amendment, which prohibits the U.S. Congress from {{creating}} legislation that limits free speech or {{freedom of the}} press. The author analyzes {{the impact of this}} clause and refers to the writer of the United States Constitution, James Madison, who believed that freedom of the press would serve as a form of separation of powers to the government. Lewis writes that an expansive respect <b>for</b> <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> speech informs the reader as to why citizens should object to governmental attempts to block the media from reporting about the causes of a controversial war. Lewis warns that, in a state in which controversial views are not allowed to be spoken, citizens and reporters merely serve as advocates for the state itself. He recounts key historic events in which fear led to overreaching acts by the government, particularly from the executive branch. The author gives background on the century-long process by which the U.S. judicial system began defending publishers and writers from attempts at suppression of speech by the government.|$|E
5|$|The bill's passage was {{met with}} concern by Catholic authorities, {{including}} Pope John Paul II — who warned of a weakening of family values — and his successor Pope Benedict XVI. Cardinal López Trujillo, president of the Pontifical Council for the Family, said the Church was making an urgent call <b>for</b> <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> conscience for Catholics and appealing to them to resist the law. He said every profession linked with implementing same-sex marriages should oppose it, {{even if it meant}} losing their jobs. Gay rights supporters argued that while the Catholic Church also formally opposed opposite-sex, non-religious marriage, its opposition was not as vocal; for example, the Church did not object to the marriage of Prince Felipe to Letizia Ortiz, who had divorced from a previous civil marriage. The church was unable to gather enough support to derail the bill, even though 80% of Spaniards identify as members of the Catholic Faith. Sociologists believe {{this may be due to}} the significant increase of liberalism in the realm of individual rights in recent years, where the Church traditionally had most influence, especially on family issues. A poll showed that three quarters of Spaniards believe the church hierarchy is out of touch with social reality. A complementary explanation might be that the Church's influence on Spaniards declined after the death in 1975 of the dictator General Francisco Franco, whose regime was closely linked to the Church.|$|E
