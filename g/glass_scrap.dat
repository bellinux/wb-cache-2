40|$|Mixtures of {{meat and}} bone meal (MBM) ash and soda-lime-silica (SLS) <b>glass</b> <b>scrap</b> were {{successfully}} melted, together with small additions of secondary materials, to form two calcium silico-phosphate glasses. Both glasses were successfully converted into glass-ceramics by sintering fine powders (< 37 μm) at 700 °C - 1070 °C for 0. 5 - 2 h, after very rapid heating (40 °C/min). The MBM-SLS mixture with added CaO and CaF 2 led to fluorapatite-wollastonite glass-ceramics, which retained significant porosity even after sintering at 1070 °C, since the remarkable crystallization hindered viscous flow. This feature was exploited for the preparation of open-celled macro-cellular glass-ceramic foams by thermal treatment of fine glass powders mixed with PE sacrificial templates. The MBM-SLS mixture with added CaO and Na 2 O led to dense combeite glass-ceramics exhibiting excellent mechanical properties (bending strength far exceeding 100 MPa), and sintered at particularly low temperatures (800 °C) for 1 h. Since the crystal phases developed in these glass-ceramics are well known for their biocompatibility, MBM ash and scrap SLS glass could find applications {{in the field of}} biomaterials or other applications requiring low-cost, high-strength glass-ceramics...|$|E

40|$|The glass finds {{from two}} Bronze Age {{settlements}} located in Veneto (Northen Italy) have been investigated: Fondo Paviani (Verona) and Montebello Vicentino (Vicenza). The present study aims to chemical and physical characterisations of the archaeological finds and, primarily, {{to answer to}} chronological questions. The main questions are: 1) may the compositional change from HMG to LMHK glasses date back before FBA stricto sensu? 2) are glasses from the surface layers of Fondo Paviani related {{to the age of}} the settlement: late MBA 3 /RBA- early FBA? If this is true, to wich phase may they be referred? Finally 3) are the scraps found at Fondo Paviani during the archaeological survey related to local production? The glass samples have been characterized by SEM-EDS, EPMA and computerized 2 D-image analyses. The results may be summarized in three main points: 1) the bead from the excavation of Montebello Vicentino, belonging to the transition between RBA and FBA, is a HMG glass. This confirms that LMHK glass did not exist before the FBA strictu sensu; 2) measured texture and the LMHK-type glass composition of a bead from surface layer of Fondo Paviani allow us to unambiguously date the bead to FBA period; 3) based on their composition, the <b>glass</b> <b>scraps</b> from the same archaeological survey cannot be dated to the Bronze Age. The <b>glass</b> <b>scraps</b> therefore are not related to local production.

40|$|Motivated by {{operational}} issues in real-world glass manufacturing, this thesis addresses {{a problem of}} laying out and sequencing the orders so as to minimize wasted <b>glass,</b> called <b>scrap.</b> This optimization problem combines aspects of traditional cutting problems and traditional scheduling and sequencing problems. In {{so far as we}} know, the combination of cutting and scheduling has not been modeled, or solved. We propose a two-phase approach: snap construction and constructing cutting and offload schedules. Regarding the second phase problem, we introduce FGSP (float glass scheduling problem), and provide its solution structure, called coveys. We analyze simple sub-models of FGSP considering the main elements: time, unit, and width. For each model, we provide either a polynomial time algorithm or a proof of NP-completeness. Since FGSP is NP-complete, we propose a heuristic algorithm, Longest Unit First (LUF), and analyze the worst case performance of the algorithm in terms of the quality of solutions; the worst case performance bound is { 1 +(m- 1) /m}+{ 1 / 3 - 1 /(3 m) } where m is the number of machines. It is 5 / 3 when m= 2. For the real-world problem, we propose two different methods for snap construction, and we apply two main approaches to solve cutting and offloading schedules: an MIP approach and a heuristic approach. Our solution approach produces manufacturing yields greater than 99 %; current practice is about 95 %. This is a significant improvement and these high-yield solutions can save millions of dollars.

This heat is transferred mainly by radiation to the melter in order to melt sand and cullet (<b>scrap</b> <b>glass)</b> eventually creating glass products. Many furnaces use electric boosters to enhance glass melting and increase productivity. The coupled electric/combustion heat transfer patterns are key to the glass making processes.

The solution {{to solve these}} problems were by recycling the aluminum scrap metal as secondary production of aluminum. Among the recycling process alternative is smelting, However, the process consumes high energy with low productivity. This study focuses on alumina production from aluminum scrap waste. Dissolution process of Al scrap with 0. 5 M sodium hydroxide (NaOH) yields Al (OH) 3 and hydrogen gas. Results show that the temperature gradually decreased from 40 °C to 35. 7 °C as the reaction took place. The pH of the solution during dissolution process increased from 12. 08 to 12. 38. The XRD results show that after calcination of Al (OH) 3 powders at 1500 °C, α-Al 2 O 3 peaks could be observed. SEM morphology shows that the calcination process changes the Al (OH) 3 powders from hexagonal shape to form α-Al 2 O 3 with rounded shape. Introduction.

In the case of porcelain stoneware tiles, several modified mixes were prepared by replacing different amounts of the fluxing component, sodium,feldspathic sand For roofing tiles, SLS glass was added at a fixed percentage in the body mixes. The fired samples were characterised in terms of linear shrinkage, water absorption, flexural strength and reliability Microstructure and the main phase transformations in the fired samples were examined by x-ray diffraction and by scanning electron microscopy along with EDS microanalysis. The results, for the porcelain stoneware body mix, shou, that a substitution of the fluxing component in the range of 5 - 10 wt% is feasible The new formulations had lower water absorptions, adequate flexural strengths and a consistent increase in reliability due to improved homogeneity. For substitutions exceeding 10 plagioclase was crystallised, which inhibited the formation of mullite and did not favour densification. The results regarding the modified body mix for heavy clay products have shown that a glass additions up to 30 wt% are feasible. New crystalline phases were developed within and at the interface of the glass grains. The particle size distribution of the glass and the firing temperature both influenced the physical and mechanical characteristics whereas they had a minor effect on the mineralogy.
