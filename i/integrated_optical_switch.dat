This represents the first demonstration of a wavelength-selective integrated optical MEMS switch. Additional contributions of this work include a new study of dielectric charging, analysis of the use of titanium nitride as structural material for MEMS, two new MEMS actuation techniques that lead to higher speed and/or lower actuation volt- age, and a feasibility analysis for wavelength tuning using a generalized version of the switch design. A model for the evolution of dielectric charging during the actuation of MEMS devices was developed to address a deviation of the experimentally fabricated devices from the theoretical predictions according to older models. (cont.) The new model predicts the experimental voltage versus displacement behavior of the wave-length selective switch accurately, and offers new insights into the physics of dielectric charging. The use of titanium nitride as a MEMS material was conceived as a solution to residual stress problems that are common in cantilever-type of actuators in general, including the wavelength-selective switch. Specific details on MEMS implementation using titanium nitride are discussed in the thesis. To address CMOS compatibility and speed challenges, two new complementary MEMS switch actuation techniques were developed. The new methods require less voltage and energy for actuation while at the same time reducing the switching time of the device to levels unachievable with current MEMS actuation techniques. Preliminary theoretical and experimental results are presented and discussed. Finally, the thesis covers the feasibility analysis of a version of the switch design where the motion is analog and, hence, can be used for tuning of resonant integrated optical structures. The analysis shows that the required positional accuracy is achievable with on-chip capacitive position sensing and feedback control, and points to a promising new direction for mechanically tunable integrated photonics. While these contributions are all outgrowths of work directed towards realizing an integrated optical circuit, they are also significant for applications such as radio- frequency (RF) MEMS switching and free-space optical MEMS devices (i. e. micro- mirror arrays for projection displays). by Gregory Nolan Nielson.

40|$|Organic {{materials}} such as liquid crystals and polymers offer unique optical and electro-optical properties, which make them ideal candidates for the realization of optoelectronic and sensing devices [1 - 6]. Liquid crystals are rather well assessed and definitely benefit from a mature technology, low cost, low driving voltages, short switching times, low losses and a wide spectral transparency from the visible to the near infrared. Polymers exhibit remarkable properties, among them a refractive index engineerable by varying their chemical composition and their compatibility with other materials, which allow large scale film deposition at low costs. In this Communication I will illustrate several integrated optoelectronic structures which exploit these materials. Among them is a bistable electro-optic switch realized by ion-exchange in glass and employing ferroelectric liquid crystals with polymeric alignment. The device, fully characterized at the wavelength 632. 8 nm, shows interesting properties ranging from a switching time as short as 300 us to an extinction ratio above 14 dB for a bias of only 5 V applied [7]. Another example is a guided-wave optical switch investigated using ferroelectric liquid crystals and polymers, in which light is confined in two polymeric films and with buffer layers to prevent losses in the near infrared by light absorption in the ITO electrodes. This switch, optimized in terms of extinction ratios and losses for various layers thicknesses, polymer compositions and liquid crystals refractive indices, has an extinction ratio better than 50 dB and propagation losses lower than 1 dB for a compact structure of just 174 um in length [8 - 9]. An electro-optic router can be obtained based on mode mixing. The design of such configuration, quite promising in terms of crosstalk and versatility [10], is presently under optimization. The device, based on a bi-modal nematic liquid crystal waveguide of an overall length < 500 um, can be driven to route an optical signal to either one of two output gates by virtue of a small voltage modulation < 1 V.

Massive parallelism is another inherent advantage of optical processors. However, it is traditionally demonstrated with free space components and seldom used for <b>integrated</b> <b>optical</b> signal processing. In this thesis, we consider spatial domain signal processing in guided wave structures, which brings {{a new dimension to}} the existing serial signal processing architecture and takes advantage of the parallelism in optics. A novel class of devices using holograms in multimode channel waveguides is developed in this work. Linear optical signal processing using multimode waveguide holograms (MWHs) is analyzed. We focus on discrete unitary transformations {{to take advantage of the}} discrete nature of modes in multimode waveguides. We prove that arbitrary unitary transformations can be performed using holograms in multimode waveguides. A model using the wide-angle beam propagation method (WA-BPM) is developed to simulate the devices and shows good agreement with the theory. The design principle of MWH devices is introduced. Based on the design principle, BPM models are used to design several devices including a mode-order converter, a Hadamard transformer, and an optical pattern generator/correlator. Optical pattern generators are fabricated to verify the theory and the model. Also, the bandwidth and fabrication tolerance of MWH devices are also analyzed. Also, we examine the nonlinear <b>optical</b> <b>switches</b> which allow the integration of MWHs into modern optical communication networks.

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} for {{the first}} time system operation and performance evaluation of a monolithically <b>integrated</b> InP <b>optical</b> wavelength-and-space <b>switching</b> module (OWSSM) as a key building block for implementing an integrable <b>optical</b> packet <b>switch</b> (OPS) with highly distributed control. The design of the SOA based optical gates allows the OWSSM to be directly controlled by the low voltage digital pins of an FPGA processor. This leads to the advantage of control simplicity and power efficiency. We demonstrate dynamic switching and contention resolution in the OPS with four wavelength 40 Gb/s NRZ-OOK optical packets per input port. Error free switching operation is achieved with 4 dB penalty, switching time of 25 ns and energy consumption of 66 pJ/bit. These results indicate that the <b>integrated</b> <b>optical</b> module could potentially be used to build up a large scale OPS with negligible increase of latency...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{the design and}} applications of integrated As 2 S 3 sidewall Bragg gratings on LiNbO 3 substrate. The grating reflectance and bandwidth are analyzed with coupled-mode theory. Coupling coefficients are computed by taking overlap integration. Numerical results for uniform gratings, phase-shifted gratings and grating cavities as well as electro-optic tunable gratings are presented. These integrated As 2 S 3 sidewall gratings on LiNbO 3 substrate provide an approach {{to the design of}} a wide range of <b>integrated</b> <b>optical</b> devices including <b>switches,</b> laser cavities, modulators, sensors and tunable filters. </p...|$|R
40|$|We present InP as the {{incumbent}} technology for data center transceiver and switching optics. We review {{the most popular}} InP monolithic integration approaches in light of photonic integration being recognized as an increasingly important technology for data center optics. We present Multi-Guide Vertical Integration by OneChip Photonics {{as an example of}} a low-cost InP integration platform, showcased for 100 GE transceiver optics, and we also review <b>optical</b> <b>switching</b> technology and present highly <b>integrated</b> InP <b>optical</b> <b>switches</b> developed at the COBRA Research Institute. We compare InP to the competing Si photonics technology, where we argue that Si photonics is a cost-competitive technology, but only for very large volumes, which are not yet representative of the data center market of today and in the near future. We conclude by pinpointing the future trends for the optics in data centers, including the increased level of optics/electronics integration, the increased use of spin-coated polymer devices, and novel heterogeneous integration by flip-chip bonding of separately fabricated InP and Si chips, as an alternative to the more challenging, full monolithic InP integratio...|$|R
