5|$|Polymorphism, or {{the ability}} of a {{substance}} to form more than one crystal structure, is important in the development of pharmaceutical ingredients. Many drugs are receiving regulatory approval for only a single crystal form or polymorph. For a long time, only one crystal structure for aspirin was known. That aspirin might have a second crystalline form was suspected since the 1960s. The elusive second polymorph was first discovered by Vishweshwar and coworkers in 2005, and fine structural details were given by Bond et al. A new crystal type was found after attempted cocrystallization of aspirin and levetiracetam from hot acetonitrile. The <b>form</b> <b>II</b> is only stable at 100K and reverts to form I at ambient temperature. In the (unambiguous) form I, two salicylic molecules form centrosymmetric dimers through the acetyl groups with the (acidic) methyl proton to carbonyl hydrogen bonds, and in the newly claimed <b>form</b> <b>II,</b> each salicylic molecule forms the same hydrogen bonds with two neighboring molecules instead of one. With respect to the hydrogen bonds formed by the carboxylic acid groups, both polymorphs form identical dimer structures.|$|E

2500|$|The verb {{classes in}} Arabic are formed along two axes. The first or derivational axis (described as [...] "form I", [...] "form II", etc.) {{is used to}} specify {{grammatical}} concepts such as causative, intensive, passive or reflexive and mostly involves varying the consonants of a stem form. For example, from the root K-T-B [...] "write" [...] are derived form I kteb/ykteb [...] "write", <b>form</b> <b>II</b> ketteb/yketteb [...] "cause to write", form III kateb/ykateb [...] "correspond with (someone)" [...] etc. The second or weakness axis (described as [...] "strong", [...] "weak", [...] "hollow", [...] "doubled" [...] or [...] "assimilated") {{is determined by the}} specific consonants making up the root, especially whether a particular consonant is a [...] "w" [...] or [...] " [...] y", and mostly involves varying the nature and location of the vowels of a stem form. For example, so-called weak verbs have one of those two letters as the last root consonant, which is reflected in the stem as a final vowel instead of a final consonant (ṛma/yṛmi [...] "throw" [...] from Ṛ-M-Y). Meanwhile, hollow verbs are usually caused by one of those two letters as the middle root consonant, and the stems of such verbs have a full vowel (/a/, /i/ or /u/) before the final consonant, often along with only two consonants (žab/yžib [...] "bring" [...] from Ž-Y-B).|$|E

Daughter-initiated (i. e. upward) communication about mammography within mother– daughter dyads may promote mammography to women of screening age. The current study examined this communication behaviour {{within the context of}} the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB), and aimed to bridge the intention-behaviour gap by trialling an implementation intention (II) intervention that aimed to facilitate upward family communication about mammography. Young women aged 18 – 39 (N¼ 116) were assigned to either a control or experimental condition, and the latter group <b>formed</b> <b>IIs</b> about initiating a conversation with an older female family member about mammography. Overall, those who <b>formed</b> <b>IIs</b> were more likely to engage in the target communication behaviour, however the intervention was most effective for those who reported low levels of intention at baseline. Perceived behavioural control emerged as the most important variable in predicting the target behaviour. The altruistic nature of this behaviour, and the fact that it is not wholly under volitional control, may have contributed to this finding. Future studies that systematically explore the relative roles of intention and perceived behavioural control in behaviours of this nature are warranted...|$|R
