40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study is to analyse the links between the <b>health</b> <b>and</b> the <b>education</b> sectors in legal {{documents}} and in field practices, i. e., to compare the theory with the practice of implementing <b>health</b> promotion <b>and</b> <b>education</b> programmes in schools. In a first phase, a document analysis study on the organization of <b>health</b> services <b>and</b> <b>education</b> services regarding, respectively, the "School Health" and "Health Education" national programmes and guidelines was carried out {{in order to understand the}} contributions of both sectors to the <b>health</b> promotion <b>and</b> <b>education</b> in schools. A second phase will be carried out in the field by assessing the implementation processes of <b>health</b> promotion <b>and</b> <b>education</b> programmes in schools. The preliminary analysis of key documents has showed that the partnership between <b>Health</b> <b>and</b> <b>Education</b> sectors exists formally since 1994, when Portugal joined the European Network of Health Promoting Schools (ENHPS). Later, in 2006, both Ministries of <b>Health</b> <b>and</b> <b>Education</b> signed a common protocol for the development of <b>health</b> promotion <b>and</b> <b>education</b> activities. The commitments assumed by both sectors aim at promoting active participation and interdisciplinary team of <b>health</b> <b>and</b> <b>education</b> professionals in order to build a common <b>and</b> structured <b>health</b> promotion <b>and</b> <b>education</b> programme with the contribution of different areas of knowledge (<b>health</b> <b>and</b> <b>education).</b> Both Ministries have developed measures and undergone structural changes that allow a deeper and more systematic cooperation between <b>health</b> <b>and</b> <b>education</b> sectors. Taking into account the documents produced by the Ministries of <b>Health</b> <b>and</b> <b>Education,</b> it can be concluded that the foundations for a successful interaction between these two sectors have been set up. Future work in the field, by assessing the implementation processes of <b>health</b> promotion <b>and</b> <b>education</b> programmes in schools, will show how the practices incorporate the theory.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of the Witwatersrand, School of Economic and Business Sciences, 2010. The main {{thrust of}} my thesis {{is to develop}} an {{integrated}} framework of human capital and growth to investigate {{the role of the}} two major components of human capital, <b>health</b> <b>and</b> <b>education</b> on growth for a set of selected African countries from 1980 - 2008. The descriptive analysis and stylized facts on human capital, fiscal dynamics and growth is carried out in Chapter 2. In Chapter 3, we assess the impact of <b>health</b> <b>and</b> <b>education</b> on per capita output. In our model, <b>health</b> <b>and</b> <b>education</b> determine labour effectiveness. In Chapter 4, we explicitly introduce the government budget constraint and the role of government expenditure in the model. This is mainly to capture fiscal constraints and challenges facing developing countries and to assess their possible implications for human capital development and growth. Our analysis and results show that both <b>health</b> <b>and</b> <b>education</b> play a positive role in promoting the effectiveness of labour and in influencing growth. The model features the role of the physical capital stock, which is found to have a significant positive role on <b>health,</b> <b>education</b> <b>and</b> growth. The dynamics of the model reveal that, in the long run, temporary and permanent positive shocks to <b>health</b> <b>and</b> <b>education</b> impact positively on labour effectiveness <b>and</b> growth.
