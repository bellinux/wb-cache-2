40|$|In {{this study}} we {{investigated}} whether allograft rejection is sensitive to local immunosuppressive therapy. In rats, cardiac transplantations (BN [...] Lewis) were performed with venous return on the portal vein of the recipient. For local treatment the topical steroid budesonide was infused with an osmotic minipump directly into the carotid artery of the transplant. Budesonide is rapidly cleared by the liver, and cardiac tissue binding of the drug is high. Hence, local budesonide administration, 120 micrograms/kg/day, resulted in high <b>drug</b> <b>levels</b> within the graft (29. 6 ng/mg) and low systemic <b>drug</b> <b>levels</b> (0. 34 ng/ml). Systemic <b>drug</b> <b>levels</b> were so low that systemic biological effects of the drug during local administration were not measurable. In contrast systemic drug delivery, via the jugular vein of recipient, resulted in similar <b>drug</b> <b>levels</b> within the graft (31. 0 ng/mg), but with high systemic <b>drug</b> <b>levels</b> within the graft (31. 0 ng/mg), but with high systemic <b>drug</b> <b>levels</b> (1. 65 ng/ml) and important systemic side effects. Both local and systemic administration of budesonide, 120 micrograms/kg/day for 13 days, resulted in significant prolongation of graft survival; median graft survival time was respectively 19. 5 days and 20. 0 days, compared with 7 days in controls.

50|$|Abrupt or rapid {{discontinuation}} from etizolam, as with benzodiazepines, {{may result}} in {{the appearance of the}} benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome, including rebound insomnia. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome, a rare event in benzodiazepine withdrawal, has been documented in a case of abrupt withdrawal from etizolam. This is particularly relevant given etizolam's short half life relative to benzodiazepines such as diazepam resulting in a more rapid <b>drug</b> <b>level</b> decrease in blood plasma levels.|$|E
50|$|There is a {{significant}} variability {{in the relationship between}} the dose administered and the resultant plasma level in blood. Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is necessary to obtain the correct dose. These agents exhibit a post-antibiotic effect {{in which there is no}} or very little <b>drug</b> <b>level</b> detectable in blood, but there still seems to be inhibition of bacterial re-growth. This is due to strong, irreversible binding to the ribosome, and remains intracellular long after plasma levels drop, and allows a prolonged dosage interval. Depending on their concentration, they act as bacteriostatic or bactericidal agents.|$|E

40|$|The {{relevance}} of intense protein binding to the antifungal activity of azole compounds {{is still a}} matter of debate. The influence of albumin on the antimicrobial activity of ketoconazole and itraconazole, which exhibit very strong plasma protein binding (99 and 99. 8 %), was evaluated in vitro. Candida albicans was exposed to continuously changing azole concentrations corresponding to <b>drug</b> <b>levels</b> in serum following an oral dose of 200 mg. Total as well as free <b>drug</b> <b>levels</b> in serum were simulated. The incubation medium was free of proteins or contained 4 % human serum albumin. Itraconazole <b>levels</b> reflecting free <b>drug</b> concentrations in humans did not reduce {{the growth rate of}} C. albicans, as compared with controls (difference in the log CFU per milliliter at 12 h, 0. 03 +/- 0. 09), whereas total <b>drug</b> <b>levels</b> were as active in the presence of 4 % albumin (mean difference, - 0. 61) as in its absence (- 0. 75). The same was true for ketoconazole, except that free <b>drug</b> <b>levels</b> were also active (- 1. 21 versus - 1. 39 for total <b>drug</b> <b>levels).</b> This result was due to the higher ketoconazole levels in humans.

In order to identify this block based on the readings the following must occur: multiple ECG recordings, 24-hour Holter monitoring, and implant loop recordings. Other examinations {{for the detection of}} an AV block include electrophysiologic testing, echocardiography, and exercise.|$|E

50|$|In {{contrast}} to indirect MDA, emergence of drug resistance {{has not been}} linked to the administration of therapeutic doses of antimalarials through direct MDA programmes. The likely explanation lies in the different pharmacokinetic profiles that result from these two methods of drug administration. The administration of therapeutically dosed antimalarial drugs results in a single peak <b>drug</b> <b>level</b> which kills all susceptible strains. Only during the terminal half life of the drug when the concentration drops below the Cmin, the inhibitory concentration which kills the large majority of a parasite population, will new infections with more resistant strains have a survival advantage. Thus drugs with a very short terminal half-life, including artemisinin derivatives, carry a lower risk of selecting resistant parasites than longer acting drugs. In contrast, the administration of medicated salts is likely to result in drug levels undulating in the sub-lethal range, which reach a steady state after several doses have been administered. The situation is worse if drugs such as chloroquine are used which accumulate progressively. This situation, a steady increase in drug concentration, is identical to the experimental design used for the in vitro induction of drug resistance. Medicated salt projects can be considered as large scale in vivo experiments designed to select resistant parasites.|$|E

50|$|Apart from pharmaceuticals, {{peptides}} {{are also}} used for diagnostics and vaccines. The total production volume (excl. Aspartame) of chemically synthesized, pure peptides is about 1500 kilograms and sales approach $500 million on the active pharmaceutical (API) level and $10 billion on the finished <b>drug</b> <b>level,</b> respectively. The bulk of the production of peptide drugs, which comprise also the first generation anti-AIDS drugs, the “…navirs”, is outsourced to a few specialized contract manufacturers, such as Bachem, Switzerland; Chengu GT Biochem, China; Chinese Peptide Company, China; Lonza, Switzerland, and Polypeptide, Denmark. Proteins are “very high-molecular-weight” (MW > 100,000) organic compounds, consisting of amino acid sequences linked by peptide bonds. They {{are essential to the}} structure and function of all living cells and viruses and are among the most actively studied molecules in biochemistry. They can be made only by advanced biotechnological processes; primarily mammalian cell cultures. Monoclonal antibodies (mAb) prevail among human-made proteins. About a dozen of them are approved as pharmaceuticals. Important modern products are EPO (Binocrit, NeoRecormon, erythropoietin), Enbrel (etanercerpt), Remicade (infliximab); MabThera/Rituxin (rituximab), and Herceptin (trastuzumab).PEGylation is a big step forward regarding administration of peptide and protein drugs. The method offers the two-fold advantage of substituting injection by oral administration and reducing the dosage, and therefore the cost of the treatment. The pioneer company in this field is Prolong Pharmaceuticals which has developed a PEGylated erythropoietin (PEG-EPO).|$|E
