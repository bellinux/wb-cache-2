50|$|Death due {{to disease}} is called death by natural causes. There are four main types of disease: {{infectious}} diseases, deficiency diseases, genetic diseases (both hereditary and non-hereditary), and physiological diseases. Diseases {{can also be}} classified as communicable and non-communicable. The deadliest diseases in humans are coronary artery disease (blood <b>flow</b> <b>obstruction),</b> followed by cerebrovascular disease and lower respiratory infections.|$|E
50|$|Apicoaortic Conduit (AAC), {{also known}} as Aortic Valve Bypass (AVB), is a cardiothoracic {{surgical}} procedure that alleviates symptoms caused by blood <b>flow</b> <b>obstruction</b> from the left ventricle of the heart. Left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (LVOTO) is caused by narrowing of the aortic valve (aortic stenosis) and other valve disorders. AAC, or AVB, relieves the obstruction to blood flow by adding a bioprosthetic valve to the circulatory system to decrease the load on the aortic valve. When an apicoaortic conduit is implanted, blood continues to flow from the heart through the aortic valve. In addition, blood flow bypasses the native valve and exits the heart through the implanted valved conduit. The procedure is effective at relieving excessive pressure gradient across the natural valve. High pressure gradient across the aortic valve can be congenital or acquired. A reduction in pressure gradient results in relief of symptoms.|$|E

40|$|It is {{recognized}} that cooling methods incorporating micro-channel heat sinks with high capacities of heat removal {{are necessary for}} cooling of electronic devices. In this paper, based on a water-cooled smooth micro-channel heat sink, a series of rectangular-shaped <b>flow</b> <b>obstructions</b> are designed into a heat sink, and then the corresponding laminar flow and heat transfer have been analyzed numerically by computational fluid dynamics. Five different configurations of the <b>flow</b> <b>obstructions</b> are considered by adjusting {{the length of the}} <b>flow</b> <b>obstructions.</b> The influence of the length of the <b>flow</b> <b>obstructions</b> on heat transfer, pressure drop, and thermal resistance is also observed and compared to that of the traditional smooth micro-channel heat sink without <b>flow</b> <b>obstructions.</b> The overall resistance versus inlet Reynolds number and pumping power are also compared for whole micro-channel heat sinks (including smooth micro-channel heat sink). The results show that the capacity of heat removal of micro-channel heat sinks with <b>flow</b> <b>obstructions</b> is much better than that of the corresponding straight micro-channel heat sink.

Very good agreement between the Douglas-Neumann program and experimental measurements was obtained for the downstream stator-strut flow field. The calculations for the unsteady lift due to the struts were in good agreement with the experiments in showing that the unsteady lift due to the struts decays exponentially with increased axial separation of the rotor and the struts. An application of the method showed that for a given axial spacing between the rotor and the strut, strut-induced unsteady lift is a very weak function of the axial or circumferential position of the stator...|$|R

40|$|Surface {{transient}} storage (STS) and hyporheic transient storage (HTS) have functional {{significance in}} stream ecology and hydrology. Currently, tracer techniques couple STS and HTS effects on stream nutrient cycling; however, STS resides in localized {{areas of the}} surface stream and HTS resides in the hyporheic zone. These contrasting environments result in different storage and exchange mechanisms with the surface stream, which can yield contrasting results when comparing transient storage effects among morphologically diverse streams. We propose a fluid mechanics approach to quantitatively separate STS from HTS that involves classifying and studying different types of STS. As a starting point, a classification scheme is needed. This paper introduces a classification scheme that categorizes different STS in riverine systems based on their flow structure. Eight distinct STS types are identified and some are subcategorized based on characteristic mean flow structure: (1) lateral cavities (emerged and submerged); (2) protruding in-channel <b>flow</b> <b>obstructions</b> (backward- and forward-facing step); (3) isolated in-channel <b>flow</b> <b>obstructions</b> (emerged and submerged); (4) cascades and riffles; (5) aquatic vegetation (emerged and submerged); (6) pools (vertically submerged cavity, closed cavity, and recirculating reservoir); (7) meander bends; and (8) confluence of streams.

40|$|The Environmental Ministry of Schleswig–Holstein (Northern Germany) has {{implemented}} a novel peatland rehabilitation programme to utilise the high denitrification potential of degenerated, minerotrophic peatlands for {{the reduction of}} nitrate input into aquatic ecosystems, and to simultaneously improve the habitat conditions. Realisation of both goals requires changes to the water management adapted to the site-specific geohydrological conditions. The effect of raised groundwater levels and extensive land use on the water quality of heavily vegetated and groundwater-fed ditches was investigated in a riparian peatland located in the River Eider Valley (a nationally important wetland case study area). The water quality of the selected representative ditches was regularly assessed at different discharge levels during different <b>flow</b> <b>obstruction</b> cover periods. The hydraulic residence time was predominantly {{a function of the}} ditch geometry and the overall <b>flow</b> <b>obstruction.</b> A better understanding of the effect of ditch vegetation on the temporal flow patterns and the hydraulic residence times is of high environmental interest, especially for improving nutrient standards in lowland rivers such as the River Eider. Within-ditch vegetation and other hydraulic flow obstructions such as accumulated silt and organic debris increased the hydraulic residence time and led to an improvement of the water quality (e. g. reduction in nitrate content) along the ditch. While ortho-phosphate and ammonia concentrations were acceptable to German water quality standards, nitrate–nitrogen concentrations were frequently elevated due to high discharges despite high <b>flow</b> <b>obstruction</b> cover. Further findings show that the lower stretches of the ditches were flooded by the River Eider due to the absence of a macrophyte-mowing scheme that led to increased water levels during late summer...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The {{occurrence}} of pulmonary artery obstruction {{in the course}} of acute aortic dissection is an unusual complication. The mechanism implicated is the rupture of the outer layer of the aorta and the subsequent hemorrhage into the adventitia of the pulmonary artery that causes its wall thickening and, at times, produces extrinsic obstruction of the vessel. There are no reports of this complication in acute intramural hematoma. Case presentation An 87 -year-old woman was admitted to the hospital in shock after having had severe chest pain followed by syncope. An urgent transesophageal echocardiogram revealed the presence of acute intramural hematoma, no evidence of aortic dissection, severe pericardial effusion with cardiac tamponade, and periaortic hematoma that involved the pulmonary artery generating circumferential wall thickening of its trunk and right branch with no evidence of <b>flow</b> <b>obstruction.</b> Urgent surgery was performed but the patient died in the operating room.

Hence, new preferential flow paths are created at reverse slopes within the landslide zone and at the boundary of the landslide, enhancing pipe formation.

At least 24. 5 % of the 139 sites with CP were related to the occurrence of an observed LS. Poorly drained LS may create favourable conditions for pipe development. Outside LS, natural and anthropogenic (e. g. broken field drains, road drainage) causes may result in concentrated subsurface flow, resulting in pipe development. No evidence was found that pipe development enhanced LS, probably because the subsurface drainage discharge generated upslope of the LS is too low. Even when pipes become blocked, it is more likely that new pipes develop and new collapses occur than they trigger or reactivate LS.

The models and calculations were based on prototypic tank geometry and expected normal operating conditions as defined by Tank Closure Project (TCP) Engineering. Computational {{fluid dynamics}} models of Tank 11 with different operating conditions were developed using the FLUENT(tm) code. The modeling results were used to assess the efficiency of sludge suspension and removal operations in the 75 -ft tank. The models employed a three-dimensional approach, a two-equation turbulence model, and an approximate representation of <b>flow</b> <b>obstructions.</b> The calculated local velocity was used as a measure of sludge removal and mixing capability. For the simulations, a series of the modeling calculations was performed with indexed pump orientations until an efficient flow pattern near the potential location of the sludge mound was established for sludge removal. The calculated results demonstrated that the existing slurry pumps running at 1600 rpm could remove the sludge mound from the tank with a 103 in. liquid level, based on a minimum sludge suspension velocity of 2. 27 ft/sec. In this case, the only exception is the region within about 2 ft. from the tank wall.
