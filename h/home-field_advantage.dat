5|$|The {{game was}} the fifth {{straight}} All-Star Game to decide <b>home-field</b> <b>advantage</b> in the World Series. The AL entered the game on a ten-game unbeaten streak (nine wins, with one tie in 2002). The NL was looking for their first win since the 1996 game in Philadelphia.|$|E
5|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the regular season, the Victoria Aces finished in first place with a 17–7 record, earning <b>home-field</b> <b>advantage</b> for the three-game championship series. South Australia hosted the three-game semi-final series against the New South Wales Patriots. Both teams finished with a 14–10 record. The Perth Heat (12–12) and Queensland Rams (3–21) both failed to qualify for the finals.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the 1986 {{season the}} Browns lost {{standout}} safety and former defensive {{rookie of the}} year Don Rogers. Rogers died of a cocaine overdose leaving the team without one of its best defenders in the secondary for the 1986 season. Despite the tumultuous off season, 1986 marked Cleveland's entry into the ranks of the NFL's elite as Kosar's play improved and the defensive unit came together. Kosar threw for 3,854yards to a corps of receivers that included Brian Brennan, Newsome and rookie Webster Slaughter. On defense, cornerbacks Frank Minnifield and Hanford Dixon {{emerged as one of the}} NFL's premiere pass-defending duos. After a slow start, the Browns rose to the top of the divisional standings, twice beating the Pittsburgh Steelers and ending a 16-game losing streak at Three Rivers Stadium. A 12–4 record earned Cleveland <b>home-field</b> <b>advantage</b> throughout the playoffs.|$|E
50|$|They {{have built}} good <b>home-field</b> <b>advantages,</b> and the series record {{reflects}} it: LSU is 24-10-1 in Baton Rouge; A&M is 7-4-1 in College Station. LSU is 4-3-1 at neutral sites, including wins {{in the two}} bowl games where they were opponents: the 1944 Orange Bowl in Miami and 2011 Cotton Bowl Classic in Arlington. From 1945-90, LSU went 21-6-1 against A&M. LSU has won the last six.|$|R
50|$|The Broncos-Chiefs rivalry is a {{rivalry between}} the Denver Broncos and Kansas City Chiefs in the National Football Leagues AFC West division. Since the American Football League was {{established}} in 1960, the Broncos and the Chiefs have shared the same division, first being the AFL Western Conference, and since the AFL-NFL merger, the AFC West. For years, the rivalry has featured {{two of the best}} <b>home-field</b> <b>advantages</b> in the league. It also heated up in recent years due to the Chiefs and Broncos both having a winning record from 2013-2016.|$|R
25|$|Over the years, the {{two teams}} have built good <b>home-field</b> <b>advantages,</b> and the series' record is {{reflective}} of these reputations. The Aggies are 7–4–1 in College Station, 10–24–1 in Baton Rouge, and 3–4–1 at neutral sites (including the losses in the 1944 Orange Bowl in Miami and the 2011 Cotton Bowl in Dallas). Through 1923, the Aggies built a 7–3–2 advantage (which included neutral site games in New Orleans in 1908, Houston in 1913, Dallas in 1914, Galveston in 1916, and San Antonio in 1917). The Aggies and Tigers next played every year from 1942 to 1949 {{during the regular season}} with all of the games held in Baton Rouge. The Aggies were 2–7 in those match-ups with LSU winning the last five. In addition to the regular season match-up in 1943, the Aggies and Tigers also faced each other in the first bowl match-up of their rivalry. Though the Aggies won the regular season game 28–13, the Tigers won the January 1, 1944, Orange Bowl 19–14.|$|R
5|$|In 2005, the Colts had {{a greatly}} {{improved}} defense over that of recent years. Combining this with their offense, they won their first 13 games, including a 40–21 rout of the two-time defending Super Bowl champions, New England. This was Manning's first road win against the Patriots in eight attempts, {{and his three}} touchdown passes earned him AFC Offensive Player of the Week honors. By Week 15, the Colts had a perfect 13–0 record, and had secured the AFC South and <b>home-field</b> <b>advantage</b> throughout the playoffs. Nevertheless, head coach Tony Dungy {{made the decision to}} play all of his regular starters against the Chargers. However, the Colts played a sub-par game against the Chargers and fell short of the win; the score was 26–17. Manning finished the 2005 season with , {{the first time he had}} thrown for under 4,000yards since his rookie season in 1998, largely because Manning sat out much of the final two games with the top AFC seed clinched. His quarterback rating of 104.1 was the highest in the league for the season.|$|E
5|$|Ultimately, the four-game {{series was}} split with two wins for each team, and the Tigers {{maintained}} a two-game lead {{with only three}} games remaining for each club. The Tigers lost two of their next three games to the Chicago White Sox, whereas the Twins swept the Kansas City Royals in a three-game series leaving both teams tied with an 86–76 record. A tiebreaker game would decide {{the winner of the}} Central division while the loser would be eliminated from playoff contention. Prior to the 2009 season, home field advantage in a tiebreaker game was decided by a series of coin tosses held {{towards the end of the}} regular season that would decide the home teams of all possible tiebreakers. A rule change following the 2008 season altered this process, leaving the site determined on a series of performance-based criteria beginning with the head-to-head record between the two teams that were tied. Therefore, the Twins took <b>home-field</b> <b>advantage</b> in this game, by virtue of winning the season series against the Tigers 11–7. The game was the third MLB tie-breaker in as many seasons, a record number for the league.|$|E
5|$|Reeves' {{impact was}} immediate. As Parcells {{had done in}} 1984, Reeves named Simms his {{starting}} quarterback. The defense returned to form, and allowed more than 20 points once all season. With two regular season games left, the Giants were 11–3 and appeared poised for a first-round playoff bye. They were upset by a Phoenix Cardinals team, {{who came into the}} game with just five wins, 17–6, in the next-to-last week of the season, setting up a winner–take–all contest against Dallas in the final regular season game. Though the Giants played well, it was Emmitt Smith's memorable performance with a separated shoulder that led the Cowboys to a 16–13 overtime win, giving the Cowboys a sweep of the season series and <b>home-field</b> <b>advantage</b> throughout the NFC Playoffs. Despite the loss, the Giants made the playoffs as a Wild Card and won their first-round game, 17–10 over the Vikings. However, they were defeated by the San Francisco 49ers 44–3 in the divisional playoffs. Simms played in all 16 games, completing nearly 62% of his passes, and threw for over 3,000 yards and 15 touchdowns. Simms, Hampton, offensive linemen Jumbo Elliot and center Bart Oates made the Pro Bowl, and Reeves was named Coach of the Year by the Associated Press. After the season, Lawrence Taylor and Phil Simms, the two biggest figures of the late 1980s and early 1990s Giants teams, retired.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the early}} and mid-2000s, the {{division}} was often cited {{as one of the}} NFL's [...] "Toughest Divisions" [...] due partially to the <b>home-field</b> <b>advantages</b> of Sports Authority Field at Mile High, Arrowhead Stadium, Qualcomm Stadium and the Oakland Coliseum, although in 2008 the division was the NFL's weakest since the AFC Central in 1985 by sending the San Diego Chargers to the playoffs as division winners with an 8-8 record while the New England Patriots missed out at 11-5 after losing out on tiebreakers for both the AFC East and the wild-card. In 2010, the Raiders swept the entire division, going 6-0, but failed to qualify for the playoffs as they only won two non-divisional games. The division was very weak in 2011 as well, when a loss by the Raiders in the last game of the season gave the Broncos the division title with only an 8-8 record. Only the NFC West in 2010 and the NFC South in 2014 have historically sent a worse division winner to the playoffs, when the Seahawks (themselves a former AFC West member) won that division with a 7-9 record and the Panthers won the NFC South division with a 7-8-1 record.|$|R
25|$|This was {{the first}} World Series in which <b>home-field</b> <b>advantage</b> was decided by the regular season record of pennant winners. From 1903 to 2002, <b>home-field</b> <b>advantage</b> alternated between the AL and NL, and from 2003 to 2016, it was {{determined}} by results from that season's All-Star Game, when it was awarded to the team from the winning league. With 104 regular season wins, the Dodgers earned <b>home-field</b> <b>advantage</b> over the Astros, who had 101 regular season wins. The series was played in a 2–3–2 format, with the Dodgers hosting Games 1, 2, 6, and 7; and the Astros hosting Games 3, 4, and 5.|$|E
25|$|A myth is {{that the}} Cubs were {{deprived}} of <b>home-field</b> <b>advantage</b> for the 1984 National League Championship Series (NLCS) {{because they could not}} host night games.|$|E
25|$|Seattle {{finished}} the season 13–3, winning the NFC West division and <b>home-field</b> <b>advantage</b> throughout the playoffs. The team scored 417 points during the season, while giving up 231.|$|E
25|$|The stadium {{had been}} known for {{providing}} both the Eagles and the Phillies with great <b>home-field</b> <b>advantage.</b> In particular, the acoustics greatly enhanced the crowd noise on the field, making it nearly impossible for opposing teams to hear one another.|$|E
25|$|The Met {{provided}} an overwhelming <b>home-field</b> <b>advantage</b> for the Vikings {{late in the}} season and in the playoffs due to Minnesota's famously cold temperatures. The Vikings played 10 playoff games at the Met and lost only three of them.|$|E
25|$|Per the 2006 Collective Bargaining Agreement, the Red Sox had <b>home-field</b> <b>advantage</b> in the World Series {{following}} the American League's 5–4 {{win in the}} 2007 All-Star Game. The first two games took place in Boston, with games 3 and 4 in Denver.|$|E
25|$|The {{game was}} the sixth {{straight}} All-Star Game to decide <b>home-field</b> <b>advantage</b> in the World Series, the AL having clinched {{each of the}} first five opportunities. The AL entered the game on an 11-game unbeaten streak (1001) as the NL continued to look for their first win since the 1996 game in Philadelphia, still holding a 40372 lead in the series.|$|E
25|$|The {{home team}} for each Discovery Series is {{determined}} by better win percentage, with head-to-head record as the primary tiebreaker. This {{is part of the}} reason why teams in the same conference, but opposite divisions, play each other an odd number (seven) of regular-season games. Something as important as postseason <b>home-field</b> <b>advantage</b> does not come down to run differential or a coin flip.|$|E
25|$|Since 2002, Selig {{subsequently}} {{tried to}} reinvigorate the All-Star Game by awarding the winning league <b>home-field</b> <b>advantage</b> in the World Series. The 2003 All-Star Game {{had the same}} U.S. viewership as 2002 (9.5 rating; 17 share) and the ratings declined in 2004 (8.8 rating; 15 share) and 2005 (8.1 rating; 14 share). The American television audience increased in 2006 (9.3 rating; 16 share).|$|E
25|$|Major League Baseball once {{conducted}} {{a series of}} coin flips as a contingency on the last month of its regular season to determine home teams for any potential one-game playoff games that might need {{to be added to the}} regular season. Most of these cases did not occur. From the 2009 season, the method to determine <b>home-field</b> <b>advantage</b> was changed.|$|E
25|$|Previously, <b>home-field</b> <b>{{advantage}}</b> in the World Series alternated {{between the}} two leagues each year. The American League {{took advantage of the}} new rule in each of its first seven years: between 2003 and 2009, the American League won four Series and the National League won three. The National League champion benefited from this rule {{for the first time in}} 2010.|$|E
25|$|The Rays {{began their}} first playoff run in {{franchise}} history against the AL Central division champion Chicago White Sox, who finished the regular season 89–74 and advanced to the playoffs after defeating the Minnesota Twins in a one-game playoff to decide the winner of their division. In the regular season, the Rays were 5–2 against the White Sox. The Rays had <b>home-field</b> <b>advantage</b> for the series.|$|E
25|$|After the Colts {{defeated}} the Jaguars, they became only the fourth team in NFL history {{to start a}} season 13–0. The Colts joined the 1934 Chicago Bears, the 1972 Miami Dolphins, and the 1998 Denver Broncos as the only teams to do so. Also, with this win, the Colts clinched the AFC South Division Championship, a first-round bye in the NFL playoffs, and clinched <b>home-field</b> <b>advantage</b> throughout the playoffs.|$|E
25|$|The Bears {{went into}} Week 16 knowing that {{any chance of}} a playoff berth was over, but they still {{had the chance to}} end the season on a high with their rivals the Green Bay Packers {{traveling}} to Soldier Field. The game was a must-win for the Packers if they wanted to have any chance of getting the No. 1 seed and gain <b>home-field</b> <b>advantage</b> in the playoffs.|$|E
25|$|The {{game was}} the fourth {{straight}} All-Star Game to decide <b>home-field</b> <b>advantage</b> in the World Series. The AL entered the game on a nine-game unbeaten streak (eight wins, with one tie in 2002). Many analysts saw the disparity between the leagues as more pronounced than ever this season, particularly due to the AL's dominance during interleague play, compiling a 154–98 record, the best record for either league in the ten-year history of interleague play.|$|E
25|$|The Tigers had <b>home-field</b> <b>advantage</b> in the Series, {{due to the}} AL's 3–2 {{win over}} the NL in the 77th Major League Baseball All-Star Game on July 11 at PNC Park in Pittsburgh. These two teams had already played {{against each other in}} June 2006. The Tigers swept the Cardinals 3–0 in Detroit, part of an eight-game Cardinals losing streak. This was the first time since 2000 that teams meeting during the regular season met again in the World Series.|$|E
25|$|In general, the {{condition}} of the pitch is a much greater factor in cricket than in baseball, while at the professional level stadium shape and quirks permanently built into the playing surface are greater factors in baseball than in cricket. Note that in amateur cricket pitches may have considerable variation in shape and may even incorporate obstacles (like tree roots), but this is not considered desirable or ideal. In baseball, familiarity with distinct field layout is considered to be an important part of having <b>home-field</b> <b>advantage.</b>|$|E
25|$|Colts QB Peyton Manning {{played only}} a couple series and backup QB Jim Sorgi got some {{extended}} playing time. Dungy decided that since they had clinched a playoff spot, the AFC South Division Championship, <b>home-field</b> <b>advantage</b> throughout the playoffs, and the No.1 seed in the playoffs, he had nothing else to really play for, {{and he did not}} want to risk his players getting injured before the playoffs. Seattle was playing to win because if they beat the Colts, they would clinch the No.1 seed in the playoffs in the NFC.|$|E
25|$|The rookie league Ogden Raptors won the Pioneer League first-half {{title and}} {{clinched}} {{a playoff spot}} and <b>home-field</b> <b>advantage</b> throughout the playoffs. The Raptors later won the second-half title with a 5–4 win over the Orem Owlz, which also set a franchise record with the team's 44th win. Ogden went on to beat the Grand Junction Rockies 2 games to 1 in the semifinals. The Raptors lost to the Missoula Osprey, 2 games to 1, in the championship series, the third straight year they lost in the finals.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, various {{writers have}} stated that <b>home-field</b> <b>advantage</b> in the World Series should be decided based on the regular season records of the participants, not on an {{exhibition}} game such as the All-Star Game played several months earlier. Some writers especially questioned the integrity of this rule after the 2014 All-Star Game, when St. Louis Cardinals pitcher Adam Wainwright suggested that he intentionally gave Derek Jeter some easy pitches to hit in the New York Yankees' shortstop's final All-Star appearance before he retired {{at the end of}} that season.|$|E
25|$|The {{playoffs in}} each season format have {{consisted}} of a single-elimination tournament. The teams are bracketed in the normal fashion, with the higher seed receiving <b>home-field</b> <b>advantage.</b> In 2007 and 2008, the playoff was rebracketed after the quarterfinals, with the highest surviving seed hosting the lowest surviving seed and the second-highest surviving seed hosting the third surviving seed. The winners of these semifinals qualify for the Cup Final (2006–10) or Premiership/Championship Final (2011–), held at the home ground of the higher surviving seed. From 2011 onward, {{the winner of the}} Championship Final is promoted to the Premiership, replacing that league's bottom team.|$|E
25|$|The Browns' {{tie with}} the Giants in the American Conference standings forced a playoff to {{determine}} which of them would advance to the championship game. The Bears and the Los Angeles Rams also tied for {{first place in the}} National Conference, forcing a second playoff game in Los Angeles. It was the first time since championship play began that two teams held the same record in both conferences {{at the end of the}} season. A coin toss gave Cleveland <b>home-field</b> <b>advantage</b> in the American Conference playoff, which was scheduled for Sunday, December 17 at Cleveland Stadium.|$|E
25|$|The 2006 Major League Baseball All-Star Game was the 77th {{playing of}} the midseason {{exhibition}} baseball {{game between the}} all-stars of the American League (AL) and National League (NL), the two leagues comprising Major League Baseball. The game was held on July 11, 2006 at PNC Park in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, {{the home of the}} Pittsburgh Pirates of the National League. The contest was the fifth hosted by the city of Pittsburgh – tying the Cleveland Indians for the record of most times hosted by a single franchise. The game resulted in the American League defeating the National League 3–2, thus awarding the AL champion (which was eventually the Detroit Tigers) <b>home-field</b> <b>advantage</b> in the 2006 World Series.|$|E
25|$|The Wizards {{started off}} the 2016-17 {{season with a}} 2–8 record. However, they rebounded to touch the second seed, before a slump brought {{them down to the}} fourth seed, {{finishing}} 49–33, behind the 51–31 Toronto Raptors at third, the 51–31 Cleveland Cavaliers at second, and the 53–29 Boston Celtics in first place. The Wizards won their division title {{for the first time since}} the 1978–79 season, also clinching <b>home-field</b> <b>advantage</b> for the first time since the 1978–79 season, and the team had their best record since the 1978–79 season. The Wizards played the fifth-seeded Atlanta Hawks in the first round of the Eastern Conference playoffs, defeating them in six games behind a 42 point game six performance from Wall and 31 from Beal; before losing to the Boston Celtics in a seven-game series.|$|E
25|$|Denver {{finished}} the season 13–3 {{for the second}} straight year, winning the AFC West division and <b>home-field</b> <b>advantage</b> throughout the playoffs. The Broncos had the best offense in the NFL, leading the league in points scored (606, the highest total in NFL history) and yards gained (7,313). The offense was so explosive that they scored points on their opening possession at least eight straight games leading into the playoffs and a ninth time against the San Diego Chargers during the Divisional Playoffs game. During the AFC Championship Game against the New England Patriots, they broke that streak, only to score on the opening possession of the second half. In only five out of 18 games (including playoffs) did they score fewer than 30 points, the fewest being 20 points.|$|E
25|$|Even {{before the}} season began, signs had emerged that the AAFC was {{struggling}} financially. After suffering from poor attendance in the previous season, the Brooklyn Dodgers dissolved {{and some of its}} players joined the cross-town New York Yankees as part of a partial merger. Other AAFC teams were allowed to sign players who did not join the Yankees, and the Browns added tackle Joe Spencer. Team owners agreed to several other changes in an attempt to address the league's difficulties. The regular-season schedule was reduced from 14 to 12 games, and the Eastern and Western divisions were abandoned in favor of a single set of standings, with the top four teams participating in playoffs to determine the league champion. The team with the better regular-season record had <b>home-field</b> <b>advantage</b> in the playoffs, the first time that happened in professional football history.|$|E
