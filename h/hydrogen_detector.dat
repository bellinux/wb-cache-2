40|$|Low-cost, hydrogen-gas-leak {{detectors}} {{are needed}} for many hydrogen applications, such as hydrogen-fueled vehicles where several detectors may be required in different locations on each vehicle. A fiber-optic hydrogen gas leak detector could be inherently safer than conventional detectors, because it would remove all detector electronics from the vicinity of potential leaks. It would also provide freedom from electromagnetic interference, a serious problem in fuel-cell-powered electric vehicles. This paper describes progress {{in the design of}} a fiber-optic, surface-plasmon-resonance <b>hydrogen</b> <b>detector,</b> and efforts to make it more sensitive, selective, and durable. Chemochromic materials, such as tungsten oxide and certain Lanthanide hydrides, can reversibly react with hydrogen in air while exhibiting significant changes in their optical properties. Thin films of these materials applied to a sensor {{at the end of an}} optical fiber have been used to detect low concentrations of hydrogen gas in air. The coatings include a thin silver layer in which the surface plasmon is generated, a thin film of the chemochromic material, and a catalytic layer of palladium that facilitates the reaction with hydrogen. The film thickness is chosen to produce a guided-surface plasmon wave along the interface between the silver and the chemochromic material. A dichroic be m-splitter separates the reflected spectrum into a portion near the resonance and a portion away from the resonance, and directs these two portions to two separate photodiodes.

40|$|This {{brochure}} {{summarizes the}} test protocols {{used in the}} NREL Hydrogen Sensor Test Laboratory for the quantitative assessment of critical analytical performance specifications for hydrogen sensors. Researchers at the NREL Hydrogen Safety Sensor Test Laboratory developed a variety of test protocols to quantitatively assess critical analytical performance specifications for hydrogen sensors. Many are similar to, but typically more rigorous than, the test procedures mandated by ISO Standard 26142 (<b>Hydrogen</b> <b>Detector</b> for Stationary Applications). Specific protocols were developed for linear range, short-term stability, {{and the impact of}} fluctuations in temperature (T), pressure (P), relative humidity (RH), and chemical environment. Specialized tests (e. g., oxygen requirement) may also be performed. Hydrogen safety sensors selected for evaluation are subjected to a thorough regimen of test protocols, as described. Sensor testing is performed at NREL on custom-built sensor test fixtures. Environmental parameters such as T, P, RH, and gas composition are rigorously controlled and monitored. The NREL evaluations are performed on commercial hydrogen detectors, on emerging sensing technologies, and for end users to validate sensor performance for specific application needs. Test results and data are shared with the manufacturer or client via summary reports, teleconference phone calls, and, when appropriate, site visits to manufacturer facilities. Client representatives may also monitor NREL's operation while their technologies are being tested. Manufacturers may use test data to illustrate the analytical capability of their technologies and, more importantly, to guide future developments. NREL uses the data to assess technology gaps and deployment considerations. Per NREL Sensor Testing Laboratory policy, test results are treated as proprietary and are not shared with other manufacturers or other entities without permission.

40|$|The {{objectives}} for this summer faculty fellowship were first {{to repair the}} Kratos XSAM 800 X-ray Photoelectron Spectrometer (XPS) and then to utilize the instrument to participate in ongoing research projects at KSC and in the researcher's own laboratory at UCF. The first 6 weeks were used in repairing the instrument. Working both alone and with the Kratos service engineer, a number of hardware problems, largely associated with the sample stage control system, were corrected. Defective parts were identified and fixed in the computer driver boards, the stage power supply, and the driver interface. The power supply was completely replaced. After four weeks of work, the instrument was functional. This occurred on a Wednesday. The following Friday the instrument had to be completely shut down because the power to the O & C Building was to be turned off. The instrument was properly secured. On Monday, the instrument was powered up and the original problems returned. After another 2 weeks of work, a software problem was identified. This problem caused the computer to use a defective port for the sample stage control. It was circumvented by rewriting the startup routine. The final 3 weeks of the fellowship were spent using the XPS to analyze samples being studied in the Langley materials project (Martha Williams) and a catalyst project (Dr. Orlando Melendez). During this time, several sample analysis requests from other groups at KSC also came in and those samples were run as well. The summer faculty fellowship also allowed many contacts to be made. After meeting with the sensors group, two projects were identified for collaboration and white papers are being prepared. One project aims to develop small, very sensitive hydrogen detectors {{and the other to}} develop a broad area, easily monitored, zero power consumption <b>hydrogen</b> <b>detector.</b> In addition to the work mentioned above, the XPS was utilized in a study underway in Dr. Hampton's laboratory at UCF...|$|E

40|$|AbstractResearch {{into the}} {{performance}} of proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) and its degradation (“poisoning”) {{by the presence of}} carbon monoxide, a common byproduct of most common hydrogen production methods, requires storage of a large quantities of hydrogen/carbon monoxide mixture in high pressure tanks. The possibility of unintended release of the gas calls for a safety study of H 2 /CO mixture leaks, as well as potential higher rate releases. This presentation covers the safety aspects of the numerical study of a H 2 /CO mixture release at a wide range of release parameters, including release velocity, orientation, initial diameter, and initial gases fraction ratio. The study provides a simulation of a) the extent of flammable concentrations of H 2, corrected for the presence of CO; b) the extent of CO concentration exceeding OSHA recommended health safety limits. The presence of CO in the mixture required reassessment of hydrogen flammability limits, although the correction proved to be relatively small for the CO fractions used in the present. The maximum extents and evolution of H 2 and CO envelops had been modeled and compared.

40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{research}} is to make available the technology to produce low-cost, lightweight, reliable hydrogen sensors for use as safety monitors wherever hydrogen is used, stored, or produced. Prior work has identified thin films that can be used as <b>hydrogen</b> <b>detectors</b> by measuring physical properties of those films and monitoring those characteristics that change in the presence of hydrogen. In all of the thin film sensors investigated to date, long-term changes in the response to hydrogen after exposure to ambient air, or short-term changes in response after exposure to pollutants have been noted. The specific objective of this work is to study those mechanisms affecting the stability of the films with respect to these environmental factors and to use the knowledge gained from these studies to craft methods of mitigating those mechanisms. We have worked primarily with thin films that can be coated {{on the end of a}} fiber optic cable. This configuration meets the qualifications of being lightweight, potentially very inexpensive, and inherently safe, since no electrical leads are employed in the monitored space.

40|$|Linear alkyl benzene (LAB) {{will be used}} as the solvent of {{a liquid}} {{scintillator}} mixture for the JUNO antineutrino experiment in the near future. Its light absorption property should therefore be understood prior to its effective use in the experiment. Attenuation length measurements at a light wavelength of 430 nm have been performed on samples of LAB prepared for the purpose of the JUNO experiment. Inorganic impurities in LAB have also been studied for their possibilities of light absorption in our wavelength of interest. In view of a tentative plan by the JUNO collaboration to utilize neutron capture with <b>hydrogen</b> in the <b>detector,</b> we have also presented in this work, a study on the carbon-hydrogen ratio and the relationship thereof with the attenuation length of the samples...|$|R
