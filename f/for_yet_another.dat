5|$|The tale's disappointing qualities {{have been}} {{ascribed}} to Potter's growing {{lack of interest}} in writing for children, to pressure from her publisher <b>for</b> <b>yet</b> <b>another</b> book, and to Potter's desire to exploit the lucrative American market. Potter's artistically successful books were written for specific children; Timmy Tiptoes however was composed for Potter's amorphous, ill-defined American fanbase. By 1911, the demands of her aging parents and the business operations at her working farm, Hill Top, occupied much of Potter's time and attention to the exclusion of nearly everything else, and are accounted as some {{of the reasons for the}} author's declining artistry and her {{lack of interest in}} producing children's books.|$|E
5|$|Between 13:00 and 14:00 General Bem amassed {{at least}} 64 {{artillery}} pieces {{on a narrow}} front near Forts 21, 22 and 23, and started firing on the artillery and infantry of the I Russian Corps. In the artillery barrage that lasted until 17:00, the forces of Russian I and II Corps were eventually forced to withdraw behind the ramparts of the captured forts. On several occasions the Russian cavalry of General Khilkov (including the Cuirassier Regiment) tried to charge the Polish artillery positions, but every time the charge was bloodily repelled with grapeshot and canister shot. Eventually the Russian cavalry withdrew from battle {{all the way to}} Górce. Half of the Russian artillery fought an intense artillery duel with the Poles, while the other half started shelling the suburb of Wola and Polish positions behind the second line of defences.
