5|$|Graff and {{the other}} leaders of the school covertly work to isolate <b>Ender</b> from his fellow {{recruits}} and prevent him from growing too comfortable in his environment. The cadets participate in competitive war simulations in zero gravity, where <b>Ender</b> quickly masters the game and dominates his opponents. The school continually tries to break <b>Ender</b> down, first promoting him to command a new army composed of raw recruits, then pitting him against multiple armies at once, but Ender's success continues. The jealous commander of the army with whom <b>Ender</b> first served, Bonzo Madrid, compels him to fight outside the simulation, and <b>Ender</b> unintentionally kills him, once again seeking to preemptively prevent all future struggles with Bonzo.|$|E
5|$|<b>Ender,</b> now {{ten years}} old, is {{promoted}} to Command School on Eros {{after a brief}} respite on Earth. After some preliminary battles in the simulator, he is introduced to a former war hero, Mazer Rackham. From now on, <b>Ender</b> participates in simulations created and controlled by Mazer. As the skirmishes become harder, he is joined by {{some of his friends}} from the Battle School as sub-commanders. Despite this, <b>Ender</b> becomes depressed by the battles, his isolation, and by the way Mazer treats him.|$|E
5|$|When he recovers, {{he learns}} that, {{at the end}} of the bugger war, Earth's powers fought among themselves. He stays on Eros as his friends return home and colonists venture to other worlds, using Eros as a way station. Among the first colonists is Valentine, who apologizes that <b>Ender</b> can never return to Earth, where he would become {{dangerous}} as Peter and other politicians sought to exploit him for their own purposes. Instead, <b>Ender</b> joins the colony program to populate one of the buggers' former worlds. There, he discovers the dormant egg of a bugger queen, who reveals that the buggers had initially assumed humans were a non-sentient race, for want of collective consciousness, but realized their mistake too late, and requests that <b>Ender</b> take the egg to a new planet to colonize.|$|E

5|$|Ender's Game: Battle Room was {{a planned}} {{digitally}} distributed video game for all viable downloadable platforms. It was under development by Chair Entertainment, which also developed the Xbox Live Arcade games Undertow and Shadow Complex.

5|$|Starship Troopers had {{a direct}} {{influence}} on many later science fiction stories. John Steakley's 1984 novel Armor was, according to the author, born out of frustration with {{the small amount of}} actual combat in Starship Troopers and because he wanted this aspect developed further. The 1988 Gainax OVA series Gunbuster has plot elements similar to Heinlein's novel, depicting humanity arrayed against an alien military. Scholars have identified elements of Heinlein's influence in Ender's Game, by Orson Scott Card, as well. Hantke, in particular, compares the battle room in Ender's Game to Heinlein's prosthetic suits, stating that they both regulate but also enhance human agency. Suvin suggests parallels between the plots of the two novels, with human society in both stories at war against insect-like aliens, but states that the story of <b>Ender</b> Wiggin takes a very different direction, as <b>Ender</b> regrets his genocidal actions and dedicates his efforts to protecting his erstwhile targets.|$|E
