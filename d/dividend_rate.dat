40|$|International audienceIt is {{well known}} that in models with time-homogeneous local {{volatility}} functions and constant interest and <b>dividend</b> <b>rates,</b> the European Put prices are transformed into European Call prices by the simultaneous exchanges of the interest and <b>dividend</b> <b>rates</b> and of the strike and spot price of the underlying. This paper investigates such a Call Put duality for perpetual American options. It turns out that the perpetual American Put price is equal to the perpetual American Call price in a model where, in addition to the previous exchanges between the spot price and the strike and between the interest and <b>dividend</b> <b>rates,</b> the local volatility function is modified. We prove that equality of the dual volatility functions only holds in the standard Black-Scholes model with constant volatility. Thanks to these duality results, we design a theoretical calibration procedure of the local volatility function from the perpetual Call and Put prices for a fixed spot price x_ 0. The knowledge of the Put (resp. Call) prices for all strikes enables to recover the local volatility function on the interval (0,x_ 0) (resp. (x_ 0,+∞)) ...|$|R

40|$|We study a {{model of}} a {{financial}} market in which the <b>dividend</b> <b>rates</b> of two risky assets change their initial values to other constant ones at the times at which certain unobservable external events occur. The asset price dynamics are described by geometric Brownian motions with random drift rates switching at exponential random times, that are independent of each other and the constantly correlated driving Brownian motions. We obtain closed form expressions for the rational values of European contingent claims through the filtering estimates of occurrence of the switching times and their conditional probability density derived given the filtration generated by the underlying asset price processes.

40|$|Motivated by {{economic}} and empirical arguments, we consider a company whose cash surplus {{is affected by}} macroeconomic conditions. Specifically, we model the cash surplus as a Brownian motion with drift and volatility modulated by an observable continuous-time Markov chain that represents the regime of the economy. The objective of the management is to select the dividend policy that maximizes the expected total discounted dividend payments to be received by the shareholders. We study two different cases: bounded <b>dividend</b> <b>rates</b> and unbounded <b>dividend</b> <b>rates.</b> These cases generate, respectively, problems of classical stochastic control with regime switching and singular stochastic control with regime switching. We solve these problems, and obtain the first analytical solutions for the optimal dividend policy {{in the presence of}} business cycles. We prove that the optimal dividend policy depends strongly on macroeconomic conditions. IM 10 IE 20 IE 21 IE 50 Business cycles Dividend policy Stochastic control Regime switching...|$|R
