5|$|The <b>durability</b> {{and life}} of {{dynamically}} loaded, welded steel structures is determined {{in many cases}} by the welds, in particular the weld transitions. Through selective treatment of the transitions by grinding (abrasive cutting), shot peening, High Frequency Impact Treatment, etc. the <b>durability</b> of many designs increase significantly.|$|E
5|$|In {{combination}} with neodymium, another rare-earth element, praseodymium {{is used to}} create high-power magnets notable for their strength and <b>durability.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Holt Manufacturing Company gained {{worldwide}} {{recognition for}} the quality and <b>durability</b> of its equipment.|$|E
5|$|Titanium's <b>durability,</b> light weight, and dent and {{corrosion}} resistance make it useful for watch cases. Some artists work with titanium to produce sculptures, decorative objects and furniture.|$|E
5|$|Because it hardens {{platinum}} and palladium alloys, ruthenium is used {{in electrical}} contacts, where a thin film is sufficient to achieve the desired <b>durability.</b> With similar properties and lower cost than rhodium, electric contacts are a major use of ruthenium. The plate {{is applied to the}} base by electroplating or sputtering.|$|E
5|$|Silicon nitride {{has many}} {{orthopedic}} applications. The material {{is also an}} alternative to PEEK (polyether ether ketone) and titanium, which are used for spinal fusion devices. It is silicon nitride’s hydrophilic, microtextured surface {{that contributes to the}} material's strength, <b>durability</b> and reliability compared to PEEK and titanium.|$|E
5|$|The 100 euro {{notes are}} made of pure cotton fibre, which {{improves}} their <b>durability</b> as well as making the banknotes have a distinctive feel. The printer code is positioned {{at the right of}} 9 o'clock star.|$|E
5|$|The BA model {{represented}} a A$500million investment, and 24,000hours of engine and <b>durability</b> testing. Germany's Nürburgring test track {{was used for}} some suspension testing. The anti-lock brakes and electronic stability control were calibrated in Sweden, as well as Australia.|$|E
5|$|The CFM56-7 first ran on 21 April 1995. Rated with a takeoff thrust {{range of}} , it powers the -600/-700/-800/-900 Boeing 737 Next Generation; {{compared}} to the CFM56-3, it has greater <b>durability,</b> 8% fuel burn improvement and a 15% reduction in maintenance costs.|$|E
5|$|The language, and {{implementations}} thereof, {{should provide}} support for software engineering principles such as strong type checking, array bounds checking, detection of attempts to use uninitialized variables, and automatic garbage collection. Software robustness, <b>durability,</b> and programmer productivity are important.|$|E
5|$|The {{stocks and}} sails were {{made during the}} two work-ins held in July and August, a total of 41 people {{attending}} over the two weeks. A second-hand stock had been bought in the 1920s and preserved at the mill, but upon examination it {{was found to be}} unfit for use. Thus two new stocks were required instead of one. Modern steel stocks had already been discounted on cost and <b>durability</b> grounds, leaving two options. Traditional stocks made from a single piece of timber, or laminated stocks. Good quality pitch pine was not obtainable in the lengths required. Douglas fir was obtainable in such lengths but was discounted on strength and <b>durability</b> grounds. A Douglas fir stock on a nearby mill had rotted after only seven years. Thus it was decided that laminated stocks would be made.|$|E
5|$|A Titan's <b>durability</b> {{depends on}} its size; larger Titans will take more effort to defeat than others and a few are immune to Crash's attacks. To defeat them, Crash has to jack a smaller Titan to fight them. On {{defeating}} the larger Titan, he can dismount the Titan he previously jacked and directly jack the larger Titan. The dismounted Titan will then be destroyed.|$|E
5|$|A bulk carrier, bulk freighter, or bulker is a {{merchant}} ship specially designed to transport unpackaged bulk cargo, such as grains, coal, ore, and cement in its cargo holds. Since the first specialized bulk carrier {{was built in}} 1852, economic forces have fuelled {{the development of these}} ships, causing them to grow in size and sophistication. Today's bulkers are specially designed to maximize capacity, safety, efficiency, and <b>durability.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{key element}} in combat since Genealogy of the Holy War is the Weapon Triangle, a system {{governing}} {{the strengths and weaknesses}} certain weapons and types of magic have against each other in a Scissors, Paper, Rock fashion. For weapons, lances are stronger than swords, swords are stronger than axes, and axes are stronger than lances. In magic, fire is stronger than wind, wind is stronger than thunder, and thunder is stronger than fire. For Fates, the Weapon Triangle relationships add other weapons in the following way: swords and tomes are stronger than axes and bows, axes and bows were stronger than lances and shuriken, lances and shuriken are stronger than swords and tomes, and so on. Several games use a Weapon <b>Durability</b> system: after being used a certain number of times, a character's weapon will break. Different entries have various systems related to character weapons: in Genealogy of the Holy War, weapons can be repaired at special shops; in Path of Radiance and future games, weapons can be bought and upgraded, while the <b>durability</b> system is replaced in Fates with a system where more powerful weapons weaken some of a wielder's stats.|$|E
5|$|Another {{feature of}} the ball is its rubber layer; it was {{designed}} to allow a better response while retaining the impact energy and releases it in the coup. Its support material of cross-linked nitrogen-expanded foam improves its retention and <b>durability</b> of its shape. Polyester support fabric enhances structure and stability. The asymmetrical high-contrast graphic around the ball creates an optimal flicker as the ball rotates for a more powerful visual signal, allowing the player to more easily identify and track the ball.|$|E
5|$|Battling the Flood, Covenant, {{and human}} forces are the Sentinels: robotic drones {{designed}} by an extinct race called the Forerunners {{to protect their}} structures and prevent Flood outbreaks. Sentinels are able to hover around in enclosed spaces and produce an energy shield when under attack. They lack <b>durability,</b> but use powerful laser beam weapons and are immune to infection by the Flood.|$|E
5|$|Because of its <b>durability,</b> {{titanium}} {{has become}} more popular for designer jewelry (particularly, titanium rings). Its inertness makes it {{a good choice for}} those with allergies or those who will be wearing the jewelry in environments such as swimming pools. Titanium is also alloyed with gold to produce an alloy that can be marketed as 24-carat gold because the 1% of alloyed Ti is insufficient to require a lesser mark. The resulting alloy is roughly the hardness of 14-carat gold and is more durable than pure 24-carat gold.|$|E
5|$|Before the 1958 season, O'Connell, who {{lacked the}} stature and <b>durability</b> Paul Brown wanted in a starter, retired {{to take a}} {{coaching}} job in Illinois, and Milt Plum was named as his replacement. Cleveland, however, was relying increasingly on the running game, in contrast to its pass-happy early years under Graham. As the team built up a 9–3 regular-season record, Brown in 1958 ran for 1,527yards – almost {{twice as much as}} any other back and a league record at the time.|$|E
5|$|Dutch brick {{is a type}} {{of brick}} made in the Netherlands, or similar brick, and an {{architectural}} style of building with brick developed by the Dutch. The brick, made from clay dug from river banks or dredged from river beds and fired {{over a long period of}} time, was known for its <b>durability</b> and appearance.|$|E
5|$|Greene is {{recognized}} as one of the most dominant players to ever play in the NFL. He is widely considered one of the greatest defensive linemen in league history. His <b>durability</b> allowed him to play in 181 of a possible 190 games, including a streak of 91 straight to begin his career. The Steel Curtain defense is consistently ranked among the top defensive groups of all time. As of the death of L. C. Greenwood in September 2013, Greene is the last surviving member of the Steel Curtain.|$|E
5|$|In December 2011, the FAA awarded $7.7 {{million to}} eight {{companies}} {{to advance the}} development of commercial aviation biofuels, with a special focus on alcohol to jet fuel. The FAA is assisting {{in the development of}} a sustainable fuel (from alcohols, sugars, biomass, and organic matter such as pyrolysis oils) that can be “dropped in” to aircraft without changing current practices and infrastructure. The research will test how the new fuels affect engine <b>durability</b> and quality control standards.|$|E
5|$|In October 1994 a {{large-scale}} modernisation programme was {{started on the}} Stadtbahn. The viaducts were checked and strengthened, and the tracks were bedded in concrete to improve <b>durability</b> and comfort. Almost all stations saw large financial investments and were thoroughly modernised. Long-distance traffic between Zoo and Ostbahnhof stations was interrupted during the construction period and the S-Bahn trains temporarily used the long-distance line.|$|E
5|$|In the arts, {{silicon carbide}} {{is a popular}} {{abrasive}} in modern lapidary due to the <b>durability</b> and low cost of the material. In manufacturing, it is used for its hardness in abrasive machining processes such as grinding, honing, water-jet cutting and sandblasting. Particles of silicon carbide are laminated to paper to create sandpapers and the grip tape on skateboards.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1960s, Gottschalk altered Panavision's {{business}} model. The {{company now}} maintained its full inventory, making its lenses and the cameras it had acquired from MGM available only by rental. This meant that equipment could be maintained, modified, and regularly updated by the company. When Panavision eventually brought its own camera designs to market, it was relatively unconstrained by retrofitting and manufacturing costs, {{as it was}} not directly competing on sales price. This allowed Panavision to build cameras to new standards of <b>durability.</b>|$|E
5|$|Oral trauma, {{including}} {{recession of}} gingival tissue and dental fracture and wear. Recession of gingival tissue affects 19% to 68% of subjects with lip and/or intra-oral ornaments. In some cases, the alveolar tooth-bearing bone is also involved, jeopardizing {{the stability and}} <b>durability</b> of the teeth in place and requiring a periodontal regeneration surgery. Dental fracture and wear affects 14% to 41% of subjects with lip and/or intra-oral ornaments.|$|E
5|$|Perry's <b>durability</b> {{allowed him}} to play in three {{separate}} decades, from the 1940s to the 1960s, for sixteen seasons. He was the NFL's career rushing leader from 1958 to 1963, ultimately compiling 8,378 yards; his record was broken by Jim Brown on October 20, 1963. His 7,344 rushing yards for the 49ers stood as the franchise record for nearly 60 years before it was broken in 2011 by Frank Gore. As of 2016, Perry's 68 rushing touchdowns with the team remains a franchise record.|$|E
5|$|Supply {{problems}} {{in the aftermath of}} the war meant that the concrete piers were founded on jarrah timber piles, rather than concrete. Additionally, a steel plate shortage forced the bridge's designers to avoid the use of steel to design the forms in the bridge's superstructure. Also, the cement that was used on the bridges had to be sourced from seven different sources, which led to different <b>durability</b> for different parts of the bridges.|$|E
5|$|The A-10's <b>durability</b> {{was shown}} on 7 April 2003 when Captain Kim Campbell, while flying over Baghdad during the 2003 {{invasion}} of Iraq, suffered extensive flak damage. Iraqi fire damaged {{one of her}} engines and crippled the hydraulic system, requiring the aircraft's stabilizer and flight controls to be operated via the 'manual reversion mode'. Despite this damage, Campbell flew the aircraft {{for nearly an hour}} and landed safely.|$|E
5|$|The ceramic waste forms offer higher waste {{loadings}} {{than the}} glass options because ceramics have crystalline structure. Also, mineral analogues of the ceramic waste forms {{provide evidence for}} long term <b>durability.</b> Due to this fact {{and the fact that}} they can be processed at lower temperatures, ceramics are often considered the next generation in high level radioactive waste forms. Ceramic waste forms offer great potential, but a lot of research remains to be done.|$|E
5|$|The largest {{consumer}} of tellurium is metallurgy in iron, stainless steel, copper, and lead alloys. The addition to steel and copper produces an alloy more machinable than otherwise. It is alloyed into cast iron for promoting chill for spectroscopy, where {{the presence of}} electrically conductive free graphite tends to interfere with spark emission testing results. In lead, tellurium improves strength and <b>durability,</b> and decreases the corrosive action of sulfuric acid.|$|E
5|$|The wool {{quality of}} a Herdwick has unique qualities {{relating}} to <b>durability.</b> Thick bristle type fibres will often protrude from garments forming a protective barrier layer in blizzards—most likely the same qualities that protect the sheep in similar conditions. They {{have been known to}} survive under a blanket of snow for three days while eating their own wool.|$|E
5|$|Thorium dioxide is a {{material}} for heat-resistant ceramics, {{as used in}} high-temperature laboratory crucibles, as a main material or as an addition to zirconium dioxide. An alloy of 90% platinum and 10% thorium is an effective catalyst for oxidising ammonia to nitrogen oxides, but this {{has been replaced by}} an alloy of 95% platinum and 5% rhodium because of its better mechanical properties and greater <b>durability.</b>|$|E
5|$|Traces {{of onions}} {{recovered}} from Bronze Age settlements in China suggest that onions {{were used as}} far back as 5000 BCE, not only for their flavour, but the bulb's <b>durability</b> to store and transport. Ancient Egyptians revered the onion bulb, viewing its spherical shape and concentric rings as symbols of eternal life. Onions were used in Egyptian burials, as evidenced by onion traces found in the eye sockets of Ramesses IV.|$|E
5|$|Customize mode {{is divided}} between the F-Zero Shop, Garage, and Emblem Editor. The shop is where {{opponent}} machines, custom parts for vehicle creation, and miscellaneous items such as story mode chapters and staff ghost data can be purchased with tickets. Tickets are acquired as the player progresses through the Grand Prix, Time Attack, and Story mode. In the Garage section, players can create a machine with three custom parts or print emblems on any vehicle. The parts are divided into body, cockpit, and booster categories, and affect the vehicle's overall <b>durability,</b> maximum speed, cornering, and acceleration. The Emblem Editor is a tool-set for decal creation.|$|E
5|$|He {{is known}} to have absorbed the {{abilities}} of Luke Cage, Vision, Red Hulk and Protector, and it is suggested that he also absorbed the abilities of his current Dark Avengers. In his final form, his body grew to the Hulk's size, and like Hulk he was capable of creating shockwaves by hitting the ground or smashing his hands together. His <b>durability</b> was sufficient to withstand the combined attacks of all the Avengers, and he demonstrated remarkable healing abilities, recovering in seconds after Daisy Johnson used her powers to make his heart explode. He could also turn intangible by manipulating his density, as the Vision does.|$|E
5|$|Mercury-Atlas 8 (MA-8) was {{the fifth}} United States manned space mission, part of NASA's Mercury program. Astronaut Walter M. Schirra Jr., orbited the Earth six times in the Sigma 7 {{spacecraft}} on October 3, 1962, in a nine-hour flight focused mainly on technical evaluation rather than on scientific experimentation. This was the longest U.S. manned orbital flight yet achieved in the Space Race, though well behind the several-day record set by the Soviet Vostok 3 earlier in the year. It confirmed the Mercury spacecraft's <b>durability</b> ahead of the one-day Mercury-Atlas 9 mission that followed in 1963.|$|E
