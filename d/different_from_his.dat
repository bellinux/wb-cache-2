5|$|Structurally, Amir's {{early works}} are quite <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> later ones. The works {{compiled}} in Buah Rindu generally followed the traditional pantun and syair style of quatrains with tail rhymes, including many with rhyming couplets; some works, however, combined the two, or had additional lines or more words than traditionally acceptable, {{resulting in a}} different rhythm. Though these early works were not as detailed as Amir's later works, Teeuw writes that they did reflect the poet's mastery of the language and his drive to write poems. Works in this anthology repeated terms of sadness such as menangis (cry), duka (grief), rindu (longing), and air mata (tears), as well as words such as cinta (love), asmara (passion), and merantau (wander).|$|E
5|$|The {{production}} team's {{approach to}} the character and Eccleston's portrayal were highlighted as being intentionally <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> predecessors, with Eccleston stating that his character would be less eccentric. To fit in with a 21st-century audience, the Doctor was given a primary companion, Rose Tyler, who {{was designed to be}} as independent and courageous as himself. He also briefly travels with Adam Mitchell, a self-serving boy genius who acts as a foil to the companions but ultimately proves unworthy, and Jack Harkness, a reformed con man from the 51st century. The Doctor, Rose and Jack form a close team but are separated in the series finale in which each character has to make difficult choices and face sacrifice.|$|E

He also noted that the series was <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> other works, and was unsure of how the audience would respond to it. Free Collars Kingdom is licensed for English language release in the United States by Del Rey, which released the series in 2007, and in the United Kingdom by Tanoshimi, which released it in 2008.

5|$|Dunstan {{wasted no}} time in organising his new ministry, taking several {{portfolios}} for himself, and again taking the position of Treasurer of South Australia. Deputy Premier Des Corcoran took on most infrastructure portfolios—Marine and Harbours, and Public Works. Corcoran became the face of the Dunstan ministry in its relationship with the Labor caucus, with his ability to use his strong manner to settle disputes. Bert Shard became Health Minister, overseeing the construction and planning of new, major public hospitals: the Flinders Medical Centre and Modbury Hospital. Hugh Hudson took on the Education portfolio, an important role in a government that was determined to bring about profound change to the South Australian education system. Geoff Virgo, the new Transport Minister, was to deal with the Metropolitan Adelaide Transport Study (MATS) plans. Len King was made Attorney-General and Aboriginal Affairs Minister despite being a new member of parliament. Dunstan formed a strong circle of loyal ministers around him, in a style radically <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> predecessors.|$|E
5|$|Skanderbeg led an {{incursion}} into Ottoman territory near Ohrid {{with the}} aid of Venetian forces under a condottiero named Antonio da Cosenza, also known as Cimarosto, on 6 September 1464. Together, they defeated the Ottoman forces under Şeremet bey stationed there on 14 or 15 September. The Venetian Senate informed the Hungarians the joint Albanian-Venetian success on 29 September. Mehmed, sensing the weakness in his frontier, assigned Ballaban Badera as commander, replacing Şeremet. Ballaban was an Albanian by birth who had been incorporated into the Ottoman army through the devşirme system and was sanjakbey of the Sanjak of Ohrid in 1464 and 1465. In the meantime, Pope Paul II began planning his own crusade, but with means <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> predecessor. He planned to get the major European states to help fund the crusade while Venice, Hungary, and Albania would do the fighting. He also wanted to aid the Albanians as much as possible and urged the Kingdom of Naples to supply Skanderbeg with able forces. Venice began to consider peace with the Ottomans since its resources had significantly decreased, while Hungary adopted a defensive strategy, however, pressure from the Pope and Skanderbeg forced them to abort their efforts.|$|E

5|$|The {{game was}} {{directed}} and co-written by Hironobu Sakaguchi, the original creator of Final Fantasy, {{who had the}} initial idea for the title after seeing the mixed responses to Blue Dragon and Lost Odyssey. Together with designer Takuya Matsumoto, Sakaguchi {{decided to make a}} game that would be <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> previous work and most other role-playing games. Development took between three and four years according to different sources. Its story was originally based in science fiction, but at Nintendo's insistence it was changed to be primarily based around fantasy. Among the staff were regular Final Fantasy composer Nobuo Uematsu, and illustrator Kimihiko Fujisaka. It was originally going to be exclusive to Japan, and later its North American release was in doubt after being announced for release in Europe and Australia. During this time, a fan campaign called Operation Rainfall drew considerable attention to the title. The title was a commercial success, and received generally positive reviews worldwide: while the gameplay generally met with praise, opinions varied on the story and graphics.|$|E

25|$|The {{propulsion}} system {{of this model}} comes from a project by Giuseppe Busso. It was <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> ancestor: it still used several components of the 3-litre engine from the 6C 3000 prototype, but as its name implied engine capacity was increased to 3,495cc.|$|E

25|$|The work of Philoponus, and {{possibly}} that of Ibn Sīnā, was read and refined by the European philosophers Peter Olivi and Jean Buridan. Buridan, who in about 1350 was made rector of the University of Paris, referred to impetus being {{proportional to the}} weight times the speed. Moreover, Buridan's theory was <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> predecessor's in {{that he did not}} consider impetus to be self-dissipating, asserting that a body would be arrested by the forces of air resistance and gravity which might be opposing its impetus.|$|E

25|$|Hackett's solo career continued, {{releasing}} {{a plethora of}} both electric, classical and acoustic based albums throughout the 1990s to the present day. In 1992 Virgin/Universal released the compilation The Unauthorised Biography, including two previous unreleased recordings co-written with Brian May of Queen. Hacketts first solorelease in the 90s was the low-key and melancholy Guitar Noir in 1993. An dreamy album that sounded darker and <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> last more commercial releases. It was followed up by the bluesy and right forward Blues with a Feeling (1994).|$|E
25|$|Ingres {{painted a}} new {{portrait}} of Napoleon for {{presentation at the}} 1806 Salon, this one showing Napoleon on the Imperial Throne for his coronation. This painting was entirely <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> earlier portrait of Napoleon as First Consul; it concentrated almost entirely on the symbols {{of power and the}} lavish imperial costume that Napoleon had chosen to wear, and the symbols of power he held. The scepter of Charles V, the sword of Charlemagne the rich fabrics, furs and capes, crown of gold leaves, golden chains and emblems were all presented in extremely precise detail; the Emperor's face and hands were almost lost in the majestic costume.|$|E
25|$|An {{isolating}} mechanism prevents members {{of two different}} species from successfully producing offspring. Dobzhansky invented the term, and in the eighth chapter he discusses their role in speciation. His views were sufficiently original for him to publish them in a journal article as well. Although previous authors had {{recognized the importance of}} isolation, their reasons were entirely <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>his.</b> George Romanes thought that isolation was a cause of change, whereas Dobzhansky sees two competing effects. Isolation reduces the rate of formation of harmful gene combinations, but it also restricts the scope of genetic variation. Thus, a species remains near a given peak in the fitness landscape and does not find new adaptive peaks.|$|E
