40|$|A {{total of}} 1, 350 pigs {{was used in}} three growth trials to {{determine}} the influence of weaning weight and average daily gain <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>week</b> postweaning on subsequent growth performance. Average initial weight and age were 13. 7 lb and 21 d, respectively. Pigs were weighed on d 0, 7, 28, and 56 postweaning in all three trials. Pigs were also weighed at market in trial 1. Weaning weight influenced postweaning growth performance such that each additional pound at weaning translated into approximately 2 lb by d 56 postweaning and 4 lb at market. These results indicate the importance of maximizing milk production during lactation to increase litter weaning weights. Average daily gain <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>week</b> postweaning also had a major impact on subsequent growth performance. Pigs that gained greater than. 5 Ibid <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>week</b> postweaning were 17 Ib heavier at market than pigs that lost weight <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>week</b> postweaning.
