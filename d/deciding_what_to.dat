5|$|Later on in 2012, Feeder took on {{one last}} tour for the year. The tour lasted for five dates {{starting}} at the O2 Academy Glasgow, before ending at the Brixton Academy in November. At the Brixton show, Grant Nicholas announced that the band would be going away for a while, before <b>deciding</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do next. Earlier on before the tour began, Nicholas was interviewed by website Mancunian Matters in which {{he told them that}} the band would take a break next year with no shows planned, although a follow-up album was mentioned alongside possible side-projects.|$|E
5|$|Some {{scenes of}} the episode {{contained}} backgrounds that were added with digital effects. One such scene was on Danny's ex-wife's house, which did not have mountains in the background; the mountains were digitally added in post-production. The same technique was used again on the village of quonset huts, and again on the freighter assault scenes, only with {{the background of the}} sea when Hesse and McGarrett fight. After the episode was filmed, the producers discovered that it was too long and spent two weeks <b>deciding</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> cut out. One of the scenes involved the team deciding on a name of their task force, but that scene was cut in favor of another episode. Manning's scenes were also cut due from the final broadcast to the length, though viewers could still make out {{the top of her head}} in the finished episode.|$|E
5|$|By October, Moreno's {{measures}} {{started to}} generate resistance among some who initially supported the May Revolution. Traders {{did not like}} the protectionist policy, and some members of the military had close ties with rich people and opposed their punishment. On October 16 it was discovered that ten members of the Cabildo had sworn loyalty to the Regency Council the past July, and they were all jailed. This included Julián Leiva and Juan José de Lezica. Moreno and Saavedra had a dispute when the Junta was <b>deciding</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do. Moreno proposed executing them as a deterrent, accusing them of working with the Montevideo Cabildo, the enemy of the Junta. Saavedra replied that the government should promote leniency, and rejected the use of the Patricians Regiment to carry out such executions. The prisoners were finally exiled to Luján, Ranchos, and Salto, and Leiva was housed by Gregorio Funes in Córdoba.|$|E

5|$|After Jacob's death, the Monster tells Ben {{to fetch}} Richard, {{as he wants}} to speak to him. However, when Ben exits the statue, Richard throws him down beside the corpse of the real John Locke, which has {{been brought to the}} statue by {{survivors}} of the Ajira flight, led by Ilana Verdansky (Zuleikha Robinson). Ben is forced by Ilana's group to bring them to the imposter Locke. They start shooting at the Monster, but he disappears, then returns in its black smoke form, killing Ilana's group. The Monster returns to Locke's form and mockingly informs Ben of the real Locke's last thoughts, while being strangled by Ben. Afterwards, Ben comforts Ilana when he finds her crying in Jacob's chamber and sets off with her, Sun, and Frank Lapidus (Jeff Fahey) to bury Locke before going to the Temple, where they believe they will be safe from the Monster. At Locke's funeral, Ben provides the eulogy, and expresses his sincere apologies for killing Locke. When they arrive at the Temple, the Monster is destroying the place. They return to the beach as a temporary shelter, and Ben attempts to make amends with everyone for killing Jacob. Ilana then forces him to dig a grave and explains she will kill Ben for murdering her father figure. Later, the Monster visits Ben, telling him to join him and then magically frees Ben. After Ben escapes, Ilana chases after him, and the two come face-to-face at the jungle when Ben points a rifle at her. Ben explains to her why he really killed Jacob, particularly grieving his daughter. Ilana understands and allows him to rejoin their group, which he does. Hurley, Jack, and Richard show up and join their group, then have a meeting, <b>deciding</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do next. Richard suggests they should stop the Monster escaping by blowing up the Ajira plane. After Hurley destroys the available dynamite from the shipwrecked Black Rock, Richard insists he will find other explosives. Ben and Miles join Richard, while the rest decide to go talk to the Monster. When Ben, Richard and Miles arrive at the Barracks, Widmore is there, and is soon joined by the Monster. Ben murders Widmore before he is able to make a deal with the Monster to spare his daughter. The Monster and Ben find Desmond and the Monster forces him to go destroy the Island. They run into Jack's group and they both go {{to the heart of the}} Island, where Desmond removes the cork of the Island, causing the Island to begin collapsing. After Jack kills the Monster, Ben and Hurley volunteer to stay behind on the Island with Jack to assist him relighting the Island. Jack tells them he will die doing this and Jack gives Hurley the new position of being protector of the Island. Ben advises him to approach his Island duties with his kindness and helpful attitude. Hurley asks Ben to become his advisor, to which he is honored. After an undisclosed period of time, Ben, on orders from Hurley, arrives at the Dharma Logistics Warehouse in Guam. He speaks to the two workers there and instructs them that the facility is being shut down. Afterward, Ben arrives at the Santa Rosa Mental Hospital and visits Walt. Ben tells him that he is still special and that he can help his father, Michael, even though he is dead, and offers Walt a job to return to the island.|$|E
25|$|Venture capitalists are {{typically}} very selective in <b>deciding</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> invest in; as a result, firms {{are looking for}} the extremely rare yet sought-after qualities such as innovative technology, potential for rapid growth, a well-developed business model, and an impressive management team. Of these qualities, funds are most interested in ventures with exceptionally high growth potential, as only such opportunities are likely capable of providing financial returns and a successful exit within the required time frame (typically 3–7 years) that venture capitalists expect.|$|E

Gladys' birthday party (along with her dates with Peggy, Clive and Fox) was held in his restaurant during the 1960 season. When <b>deciding</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do for April's birthday later in the season, Tony's Trattoria was suggested as a venue, but this never went ahead as Clive revealed the restaurant had been closed down by the Health Authority.|$|E

It is analogous to <b>deciding</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do with a damaged car: p53 brings everything to a halt, and then decides whether to fix the cell or, if the cell is beyond repair, to destroy the cell. This protective function of p53 is disabled in most cancer cells, allowing them to multiply without check. Restoration of p53 activity in tumours (where possible) {{has been shown to}} inhibit tumour growth and can even shrink the tumour.|$|E

He landed in San Francisco where he spent some time <b>deciding</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do next. Then it struck him to approach George Bernard Shaw, whom Pascal had met auspiciously many years earlier. During that earlier meeting Shaw, who had been impressed with the young Pascal's passion for art and cinema, {{had told him to}} pay him a visit when he was entirely penniless. Pascal was now exactly that. He then sought out Shaw, first by going to New York City hidden in the toilet of a train, then convincing a sea captain to give him a lift to England.|$|E
25|$|The play dramatises {{events in}} More's life, and {{it deals with}} issues of {{obedience}} to the crown and rule of law, particularly when a populace has become stirred up in an anti-alien fervor. It consists of 17 scenes, four of them cancelled. It begins with the Ill May Day events of 1517: Foreign nationals, who have immigrated to England from Lombardy, which is the northern region {{of what is now}} known as Italy, are misbehaving in a variety of ways, and are treating the citizens of London with abuse and disrespect. This is outraging the workers of London, who decide to join together on Mayday and seek revenge on the newcomers. London noblemen are having difficulty <b>deciding</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do about this, when rioting breaks out all across London, and even the Mayor of London is endangered. The noblemen decide to engage Sheriff Thomas More, who is popular and respected by the people, to try and calm the civil unrest.|$|E

500|$|A General History of Quadrupeds {{appeared}} in 1790. It deals with 260 mammals {{from across the}} world, including animals from [...] "Adive" [...] to [...] "Zorilla". It is particularly thorough {{on some of the}} domestic animals: the first entry describes the horse. Beilby and Bewick had difficulty <b>deciding</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> include, and especially on how to organise the entries. They had hoped to arrange the animals systematically, but they found that the rival systems of Linnaeus, Buffon and John Ray conflicted, and in Linnaeus's case at least changed with every edition of his work. They decided to put useful animals first [...] "which so materially contribute to the strength, the wealth, and the happiness of this kingdom".|$|E
500|$|Feminist author Germaine Greer called Glamour magazine's {{decision}} to award Jenner with a [...] "Woman of the Year" [...] award misogynistic, questioning whether a transgender woman {{could be better}} than [...] "someone who is just born a woman." [...] Jenner also received criticism from individuals such as actress Rose McGowan, for statingin a BuzzFeed interview that the hardest part about being a woman [...] "is figuring out what to wear". McGowan argued: [...] "We are more than <b>deciding</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> wear. We are more than the stereotypes foisted upon us by people like you. You're a woman now? Well fucking learn {{that we have had}} a VERY different experience than your life of male privilege." [...] McGowan later stated that she was not transphobic, and added: [...] "Disliking something a trans person has said is no different than disliking something a man has said or that a woman has said. Being trans doesn't make one immune from criticism." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode, {{being the}} series premiere, {{features}} the first {{usage of the}} theme song by pop punk band Nerf Herder. Parry Gripp, the band's songwriter, guitarist, and admitted fan of the show explained that the band created the theme song after [...] "fancy pants Hollywood" [...] failed to write a theme song that the producers approved. Eventually, [...] "they [...] asked a bunch of local, small time bands who they could pay very little money {{to come up with}} some ideas and they liked our idea and they used it." [...] Several songs by the band Sprung Monkey play during the episode. When Buffy is <b>deciding</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> wear, the song [...] "Saturated" [...] is playing faintly in the background. At The Bronze, the band plays their songs [...] "Believe", [...] "Swirl", and [...] "Things are Changing". All of the songs featured in the episode can be found on their 1995 album Swirl. The score for the episode, as well as all first season entries, was created by Walter Murphy.|$|E

500|$|The line 4.Qc2 {{immediately}} {{attacks the}} Ne4, as a retreat by Black would effectively surrender his temporary lead in development, {{which is the}} compensation for the sacrificed pawn. Black must continue to develop while {{trying to keep the}} Ne4 on its square, but that is by no means easy. Borik thinks 4.Qc2 is the move [...] "that gives Black the most problems to solve", but Lalic does not agree at all, stating that the reply [...] "4...Bb4+ [...] followed by d7–d5 ensures Black a rapid development and plenty of counterplay. It {{is for this reason that}} 4.Qc2 is not on the danger list". The reply 4...Bb4+ (see diagram at right) pins the white pieces before <b>deciding</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do with the Ne4. White cannot reply 5.Bd2 as he would lose the bishop pair and Black would easily regain the e5-pawn with Nc6/Qe7/0-0/Re8. After 5.Nd2 this knight would be misplaced and would block the Bc1, so Black could open the game with 5...d5 in favourable circumstances. Best for White is 5.Nc3 d5 6.exd6 Bf5 7.Bd2 Nxd6 8.e4! Bxc3 9.Bxc3 Bxe4 when Black has regained his pawn but White has the bishop pair and possibilities of an attack on the kingside.|$|E
500|$|... "18 Miles Out" [...] was {{critically}} acclaimed by television commentators. Bex Schwartz of Rolling Stone opined that the installment {{was an excellent}} and well-written episode, proclaiming that it [...] "balanced zombie action with human drama". In his B grade review for the episode, Zack Halden of The A.V. Club felt that [...] "18 Miles Out" [...] {{was one of the}} second season's more solid attempts; [...] "While there's no question this is still serialized, the story here had a clear beginning, middle, and end, and we stay focused the whole time on two plot arcs: Rick and Shane <b>deciding</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do with Randall [...] while Lori, Maggie, and Andrea deal in their own individual ways with Beth’s desire to kill herself." [...] Halden resumed that it made him hopeful of future installments of The Walking Dead. Matt Barone of Complex, Andrew Conrad of The Baltimore Sun, and IGN's Eric Goldman asserted that [...] "18 Miles Out" [...] was one of the series' best episodes, while The Star-Ledger Mark Mauer thought that it was redundant, ultimately concluding that [...] "it indulged in another subplot centered on a petty argument". Goldman professed that the episodic direction was more focused than previous installments. Concluding his review, he gave the episode a 9.5 out of 10, signifying an [...] "amazing" [...] rating. SFX journalist Ian Berriman echoed analogous sentiments, inevitably issuing [...] "18 Miles Out" [...] a four-and-a-half star rating. He called it the season's best episode, and wrote that it was filled with [...] "action, explosive arguments, [...] difficult decisions".|$|E
