50|$|This {{points to}} the major role trade credit {{insurance}} plays in facilitating international trade. Trade credit is offered by vendors to their customers {{as an alternative to}} prepayment or cash on delivery terms, providing time for the customer to generate income from sales to pay for the product or service. This requires the vendor to assume non-payment risk. In a local or domestic situation as well as in an <b>export</b> <b>transaction,</b> the risk increases when laws, customs communications and customer's reputation are not fully understood. In addition to increased risk of non-payment, international trade presents the problem of the time between product shipment and its availability for sale. The account receivable is like a loan and represents capital invested, and often borrowed, by the vendor. But this is not a secure asset until it is paid. If the customer's debt is credit insured the large, risky asset becomes more secure, like an insured building. This asset may then be viewed as collateral by lending institutions and a loan based upon it used to defray the expenses of the transaction and to produce more product. Trade credit insurance is, therefore, a trade finance tool.|$|E

40|$|Exploring {{the link}} between trade {{facilitation}} and the extensive and intensive margins of trade, the paper has two aims. The first and main objective is to investigate whether the extensive margin of trade in homogeneous and differentiated goods is affected {{in the same way}} by cross-border trade transaction costs. The second objective is to compare the implications for the extensive and intensive margins to ascertain the margin at which these transaction costs matter the most, again controlling for the type of goods being traded. Very detailed mirror data on imports to EU countries from developing countries in 2005 is utilized to decompose these countries’ exports into its extensive and intensive margins. Using the number of days needed to export a good as a proxy for trade transaction costs, econometric evidence is found that there is a significant and negative association between <b>export</b> <b>transaction</b> costs and the extensive margin for differentiated goods: developing countries with high transaction costs will export significantly fewer differentiated goods. However, no such negative effect on the extensive margin is found for homogeneous goods. Comparing the two margins’ effects, evidence is found that, for differentiated goods, the extensive margin is more negatively affected by <b>export</b> <b>transaction</b> costs than the intensive margin. Results also indicate that to the extent that there is an overall negative trade effect on homogeneous goods from <b>export</b> <b>transaction</b> costs, this negative effect stems from effects on the intensive margin.

40|$|We examine Colombian <b>export</b> <b>transaction</b> {{data from}} customs records in several dimensions. We begin with some basic {{statistics}} on the number and frequency of export transactions by a firm, overall and across individual markets. We then decompose the variation in overall exports into the number of transactions {{and the size of}} the average transaction, both at the aggregate level and for individual firms to explore gravity equations, where the patterns of exports and numbers of transactions are related to the distance with respect to the destination. The analysis is carried out both at the aggregate and the firm level. Then we explore the relationship between patterns of transactions numbers and shipment modes. Our results show great heterogeneity in the patterns of frequency and number of transactions across firms; the average firm sent about 75 shipments abroad in 2005, while the firm with largest number of transactions that same year dispatched more than 26, 000 shipments. Moreover, while close to 35 % of firms in the sample report a single <b>export</b> <b>transaction</b> over the period, for most firms with multiple transactions the average span between two transactions is less than a month. Part of this heterogeneity is shown to be related to the distance with respect to the destination market: firms exporting to more distant destinations make less frequent shipments than firms exporting to markets that are closer. This suggests that there are fixed costs per shipment inducing declining marginal cost of higher shipment volume. These patterns imply that, at the aggregate level, transactions numbers are the primary source of variation in exports. The variability in the numbers of transactions also explains an important part of the well-known negative relationship between aggregate exports and distance to a specific destination. <b>Export</b> <b>transaction</b> frequency; fixed shipment costs and scale economies in transportation; destination distance, average shipment volume and number of shipments.

Overview The IESO has identified situations where negative Congestion Management Settlement Credits (CMSC) may unfairly be charged to exporters under certain conditions, which could result in significant CMSC charges owing from exporters. The situations have occurred during internal transmission constraints under the following conditions: 1. The market participant (MP) is exporting power (this issue does not apply to imports because negative CMSC is offset by intertie offer guarantees). 2. The net interchange schedule limit (NISL) was binding in the market schedule. 3. The transactions did not, in whole or in part, result in the physical flow of power (i. e. the <b>export</b> <b>transaction</b> was constrained off). 4.
