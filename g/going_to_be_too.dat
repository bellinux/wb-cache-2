25|$|Jermaine Lawson was {{the lone}} wicket-taker for West Indies in the second innings, but the target of 172 was always <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>too</b> small, {{although}} there was hope with the score on 49 for 3. Mahela Jayawardene with 41 not out and Thilan Samaraweera with 51 steadied the ship with a partnership of 86, and Jayawardene and Dilshan saw Sri Lanka to the predictable six-wicket win – but, in all fairness, West Indies had overperformed.|$|E
25|$|Specific trap {{sites for}} heavy mineral sand placer {{deposits}} are in beaches on the leeward side of headlands, as this forms a low-energy zone which traps sediments carried {{along by the}} longshore drift. Also, sand bars developed at the mouths of rivers which feed the placer deposits are rich trap sites where the winnowing action of the waves are most efficient, because heavy minerals, if they are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>too</b> heavy to be moved, will deposit at an isthmus in preference to drifting too far down the beach.|$|E
500|$|Wilson's and Love's working {{relationship}} was briefly reestablished for the follow-up single [...] "Good Vibrations". [...] Wilson {{said that before}} its final mixdown, he had been confronted with resistance by unnamed members of the group. The subject of their worries and complaints was the song's length and [...] "modern" [...] sound: [...] "I said no, it's not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>too</b> long a record, it's {{going to be just}} right. ... They didn't quite understand what this jumping from studio to studio was all about. And they couldn't conceive of the record as I did. I saw the record as a totality piece." [...] Love was worried that the [...] "track itself was already so avant-garde, especially with the theremin, [...] I wondered how our fans were going to relate to it." [...] Shortly before the single's release, Wilson suggested: [...] "It's still sticking pretty close to that same boy-girl thing, you know, but with a difference. And it's a start, it's definitely a start." ...|$|E

500|$|Concurrent {{with his}} post-KFC {{business}} ventures, Brown purchased an ownership stake in several professional basketball teams. In 1970, Wendell Cherry assembled {{a group that}} included Brown to buy the American Basketball Association's (ABA) Kentucky Colonels. Following the 1972–73 season, Cherry sold {{his interest in the}} Colonels to a group from Cincinnati; Brown immediately purchased Cherry's interest from the group, reportedly to keep the team from moving to Cincinnati. He put his wife and a 10-woman board of directors in charge of the team. Colonels general manager Mike Storen felt that this was a sign that Brown was going to run the team [...] "his way", and left the team as a result; two months later, he accepted the job of ABA league commissioner. Head coach Joe Mullaney followed soon after, saying that Brown was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>too</b> meddlesome in personnel decisions. Babe McCarthy lasted only one season as Mullaney's replacement; in 1975, Brown hired Hubie Brown as head coach. The team won the ABA championship the following year.|$|E
500|$|Colossus's {{movements}} were re-recorded with performer T.J. Storm, as Tricoteux {{had been unable}} to move athletically due to the platform shoes he had to wear on set to replicate the character's height. LaSalle was used for his facial performance. DD then mapped these performances onto a digital model that was designed to be comic-accurate. The team sought specific reference for Colossus's metallic finish to avoid looking [...] "chromey", visiting a metal company to look at various samples. They settled on cold rolled steel, with the darker hot rolled steel used for his hair. The model also includes ridges on the character, which could be moved separately {{from the rest of the}} model to keep them always perfectly straight as in the comic books. DD also created the model of Deadpool that was used by all vendors. His mask is animated around the eyes to be expressive as in the comics, which helped balance out the [...] "chinwag" [...] caused by Reynolds' acting coming through the bottom of the mask. Replacing Deadpool's head fully was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>too</b> costly, so Weta Digital instead warped each shot based on facial reference from Reynolds, and adjusted the lighting to reflect the changes. This was called an [...] "ingenious 2D-ish solution".|$|E
500|$|The first Beach Boy to hear [...] "Good Vibrations" [...] in a semi-completed {{form was}} Carl Wilson, who had {{previously}} participated in rough guide vocals with Brian for the initial February mix. Following a performance with the touring group in North Dakota, he remembered: [...] "I came back up into my hotel room one night and the phone rang. It was Brian on the other end. He called me from the recording studio and played this really bizarre sounding music over the phone. There were drums smashing, that kind of stuff, and then it refined itself {{and got into the}} cello. It was a real funky track." [...] In 1976, Brian revealed that before the final mixdown, he had been confronted with resistance by members of the group, whom Brian declined to name. The subject of their worries and complaints was the song's length and [...] "modern" [...] sound: [...] "I said no, it's not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>too</b> long a record, it's going to be just right. ...

500|$|Critics harshly {{criticized the}} film's {{controversial}} change in title from Rapunzel to Tangled. Holding Flynn's role and characterization partially responsible for it, they accused {{the character of}} being a marketing tool manipulated by Disney to attract larger male audiences via the film's trailers. Writing for the Los Angeles Times, Dawn C. Chmielewski observed that Tangleds marketing campaign involved [...] "amp up {{the role of the}} dashing Errol Flynn-styled male lead to share the spotlight with the golden-haired namesake of the classic Brothers Grimm story". Tom Charity of CNN received Flynn as [...] "an attempt to lure boys and men into the theater". One of the film's trailers features Flynn [...] "trying to win over ... Rapunzel by giving her 'the smolder'" [...] while [...] "emphasiz ... action components ... over the more girl-oriented fairy tale stuff", according to Christian Blauvelt of Slant Magazine. Jennie Punter of The Globe and Mail felt that Flynn was [...] "obviously designed to keep the young male audience from spurning yet another princess movie". Richard Corliss of Time mocked the film's marketing and the idea that [...] "The trailers suggest that the movie is an action comedy about a roguish guy ... whose mission is to storm the tower and free the girl inside." [...] Referring to the film's title as [...] "idiotic", Matt Neal of the Standard-Examiner wrote, [...] "Disney claims it changed the film's title from Rapunzel to Tangled to emphasise Flynn Rider's role in the film ... but that title-change excuse doesn't fly." [...] The Daily Mails Chris Tookey felt that Flynn's narration [...] "feels wrong", describing it [...] "as a commercially calculated move to reassure males in the audience that the film won't be too 'girly'." [...] Similarly, A. O. Scott of The New York Times received Flynn as a [...] "hijacking of a princess's tale", panning the character as [...] "a crude commercial calculation, a sign to the anxious boys in the audience that things aren't <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>too</b> girly, or to Disneyphobes that the studio can bring some DreamWorks-style attitude." [...] Claire Martin of The Denver Post felt that Flynn's sole purpose in the film was for potential merchandising opportunities, specifically to [...] "take Ken's role as [...] male arm candy".|$|E

2500|$|During {{the reign}} of Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, due to the growing {{nationalism}} and the economic difficulties in the country, the Shah gave up control over certain religious affairs to the clergy of the country. [...] Among other things, the power sharing resulted in a campaign of persecution against the Bahá'ís. Akhavi has suggested it is likely the government had hoped that by orchestrating a movement against the Bahá'ís it could serve to obscure the fact that revenues obtained by the distribution of oil from western oil companies was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>too</b> low for the growing nationalistic sentiment; it would also serve to gain {{the support of the}} clergy for their foreign policy. [...] They approved and coordinated the anti-Bahá'í campaign to incite public passion against the Bahá'ís started in 1955 and included the spreading of anti-Bahá'í propaganda in national radio stations and official newspapers.|$|E
2500|$|To {{promote the}} album, Florence and the Machine {{embarked}} on their second worldwide tour titled the Ceremonials Tour on 13 October 2011. The set list includes {{songs from the}} band's two studio albums. The tour included numerous performances at music festivals as that is Welch's favourite way to perform live. During an interview with MTV News, Welch discussed {{the nature of the}} tour, saying, [...] "In a way, it's not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>too</b> big a production; we've done a lot of quite extravagant stuff, and that's been amazing, but for this tour, it's definitely going to be about showcasing the music [...] The songs {{are going to be the}} most important thing. It will be heavily based on the music [...] no bells and whistles just yet, we're going to try and keep it quite pure." [...] The tour ended in December 2012, after two years of worldwide touring.|$|E
2500|$|Alonso was {{convinced}} {{he could have}} finish in fifth place had his car not stopped with an energy recovery system failure, saying he felt the car was quicker than Ricciardo's Red Bull and revealed his team changed their approach prompting to Alonso reduce his speed which at that point his car problem emerged. He stated {{the remainder of the}} season was [...] "not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>too</b> different" [...] after enduring a difficult campaign over the past twelve rounds but that Ferrari was prepared [...] "It is the way at the moment but we cannot do anymore than this." [...] Bottas told the press after the race that Magnussen's driving was [...] "on the limit" [...] but was not sure whether his rival deserved a penalty. Magnussen was [...] "frustrated" [...] upon receiving his second consecutive time-penalty and stated he would review the incident and carry over lessons into the next race of the season. While initial reactions in the United Kingdom disagreed with the stewards decision, Smedley felt the penalty was justified. Red Bull team principal Christian Horner reserved praise for Ricciardo, feeling his overtaking manoeuvres were [...] "truly impressive" [...] and that this skill was one of the driver's strengths: [...] "For somebody that had a question mark over his overtaking coming into the year, he [...] is right up there with the best." ...|$|E

2500|$|As {{the episode}} {{development}} progressed, the writing staff found {{that not all}} of their original ideas fit as well as they first thought. When this happens, the staff is forced to change aspects of an episode in order to save time, better develop characters, or stay in line {{with the rest of the}} season. For example, in the original script for [...] "Whisper" [...] the thieves who try and rob the jewelry store were going to be father and son. Clark was also originally going to be blind until the end of [...] "Whisper". The team decided that [...] "it wasn’t <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>too</b> satisfying to watch", so Clark received his sight back midway through the episode. The original script for [...] "Velocity" [...] had Clark and Pete playing basketball at the end of the episode, as if nothing had happened. This was revised to have Pete apologize to Clark for forcing him to abuse his powers, and having Clark question whether the two could ever have the same friendship they once had. [...] "Resurrection" [...] originally featured the character of Garrett bonding with Clark over Jonathan’s heart condition, as Garrett’s father—later changed to his brother—was dying. As the episode progresses, elements of the story were changed and Garrett drifted from being sympathetic to being a darker character who was eventually killed by a police sniper. In the original draft of [...] "Truth", Mrs. Taylor did not reveal that she had been part of an activist group that had done some illegal activity years earlier, but that she was having an affair with a student. As Gough sees it, using the affair storyline would have created more scenes that would need to be shot in order to effectively tell that part of the episode, and using the concept that Mrs. Taylor had been on the run from the law worked easier for the crew.|$|E
