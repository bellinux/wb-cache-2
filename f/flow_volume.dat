40|$|AbstractOBJECTIVESThe aim of {{the present}} study was to quantitate shunt <b>flow</b> <b>volumes</b> through atrial septal defects (ASDs) in a chronic animal model with surgically created ASDs using a new semiautomated color Doppler flow {{calculation}} method (ACM). BACKGROUNDBecause pulsed Doppler is cumbersome and often inappropriate for color flow computation, new methods such as ACM are of interest. METHODSIn this study, 13 to 25 weeks after ASDs were surgically created in eight sheep, a total of 24 hemodynamic states were studied at a separate open chest experimental session. Electromagnetic (EM) flow probes and meters were used to provide reference <b>flow</b> <b>volumes</b> as the pulmonary and aortic <b>flow</b> <b>volumes</b> (Qpand Qs) and shunt <b>flow</b> <b>volumes</b> (Qpminus Qs). Epicardial echocardiographic studies were performed to image the left and right ventricular outflow tract (LVOT and RVOT) forward flow signals. The ACM method digitally integrated spatial and temporal color flow velocity data to provide stroke volumes. RESULTSLeft ventricular outflow tract and RVOT <b>flow</b> <b>volumes</b> obtained by the ACM method agreed well with those obtained by the EM method (r = 0. 96, mean difference = 0. 78 ± 1. 7 ml for LVOT and r = 0. 97, mean difference = − 0. 35 ± 3. 6 ml for RVOT). As a result, shunt <b>flow</b> <b>volumes</b> and Qp/Qsby the ACM method agreed well with those obtained by the EM method (r = 0. 96, mean difference = − 1. 1 ± 3. 6 ml/beat for shunt volumes and r = 0. 95, mean difference = − 0. 11 ± 0. 22 for Qp/Qs). CONCLUSIONSThis animal study, using strictly quantified shunt <b>flow</b> <b>volumes,</b> demonstrated that the ACM method can provide Qp/Qsand shunt measurements semiautomatically and noninvasively...|$|R

These <b>flow</b> <b>volumes</b> were compared with those obtained by the conventional pulsed Doppler method with reference to ultrasonic flowmeter. <b>Flow</b> <b>volumes</b> determined by the automated method agreed well with those obtained by ultrasonic flowmeter, even in this compliant aorta model with vessel size changing with pulsation, whereas the pulsed Doppler method overestimated the reference data, especially for more compliant descending aortic segments.

25|$|Droughts are {{becoming}} more frequent and intense in arid and semiarid western North America as temperatures have been rising, advancing the timing and magnitude of spring snow melt ﬂoods and reducing river <b>flow</b> <b>volume</b> in summer. Direct {{effects of climate change}} include increased heat and water stress, altered crop phenology, and disrupted symbiotic interactions. These effects may be exacerbated by climate changes in river ﬂow, and the combined effects are likely to reduce the abundance of native trees in favor of non-native herbaceous and drought-tolerant competitors, reduce the habitat quality for many native animals, and slow litter decomposition and nutrient cycling. Climate change effects on human water demand and irrigation may intensify these effects.|$|E

As the Mekong river begins its minimum around {{this time of the year}} and its water level falls deeper than the inundated Tonle Sap lake, Tonle Sap river and surrounding wetlands, waters of the lake's basin now drains via the Tonle Sap river into the Mekong. As a result the Tonle Sap River (length around 115km/71mi) flows 6 months a year South-East (Mekong) to North-West (lake) and 6 month a year in the opposite direction. The mean annual reverse <b>flow</b> <b>volume</b> in the Tonle Sap is , or about half of the maximum lake volume. A further 10% is estimated to enter the system by overland flow from the Mekong.

Positive displacement types such as piston compressors, or rotary types such as a Roots blower could also be used with suitable provisions for damping the pulsations in the air flow (however, other rotary types such as twin screw compressors are capable of providing a steady supply of compressed fluid). The pressure ratio of a single fan blade is too low and cannot be used.|$|E
25|$|Echocardiography is a {{non-invasive}} method of quantifying cardiac output using ultrasound. Two-dimensional (2D) ultrasound and Doppler measurements are used together to calculate cardiac output. 2D {{measurement of the}} diameter (d) of the aortic annulus allows calculation of the flow cross-sectional area (CSA), which is then multiplied by the VTI of the Doppler flow profile across the aortic valve to determine the <b>flow</b> <b>volume</b> per beat (stroke volume, SV). The result is then multiplied by the heart rate (HR) to obtain cardiac output. Although used in clinical medicine, it has a wide test-retest variability. It is said to require extensive training and skill, but the exact steps needed to achieve clinically adequate precision have never been disclosed. 2D measurement of the aortic valve diameter is one source of noise; others are beat-to-beat variation in stroke volume and subtle differences in probe position. An alternative {{that is not necessarily}} more reproducible is the measurement of the pulmonary valve to calculate right-sided CO. Although it is in wide general use, the technique is time consuming and is limited by the reproducibility of its component elements. In the manner used in clinical practice, precision of SV and CO is of the order of ±20%.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis work {{presents}} the results of the implementation of a probabilistic system to model the uncertainty associated to radar rainfall (RR) estimates and the way this uncertainty propagates through the sewer system of an urban area located in the North of England. The spatial and temporal correlations of the RR errors as well as the error covariance matrix were computed to build a RR error model able to generate RR ensembles that reproduce the uncertainty associated with the measured rainfall. The results showed that the RR ensembles provide important information about the uncertainty in the rainfall measurement that can be propagated in the urban sewer system. The results showed that the measured flow peaks and <b>flow</b> <b>volumes</b> are often bounded within the uncertainty area produced by the RR ensembles. In 55 % of the simulated events, the uncertainties in RR measurements can explain the uncertainties observed in the simulated <b>flow</b> <b>volumes.</b> However, there are also some events where the RR uncertainty cannot explain the whole uncertainty observed in the simulated <b>flow</b> <b>volumes</b> indicating that there are additional sources of uncertainty that must be considered such as the uncertainty in the urban drainage model structure, the uncertainty in the urban drainage model calibrated parameters, and the uncertainty in the measured sewer flows...|$|R

50|$|This {{geometry}} ensures that, per rotation, {{a constant}} <b>flow</b> <b>volume</b> proportional to rotary angle is always produced.

This results in a guaranteed dosing accuracy of 1% at the pump outlet (depending on the medium). This figure is often even better in practice.|$|E
