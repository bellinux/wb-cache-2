NASCAR vehicles are generally unregulated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency, and in particular, they have no mufflers, catalytic converters or other <b>emissions</b> <b>control</b> <b>devices.</b> However, some local short tracks which run under NASCAR sanction require certain <b>emissions</b> <b>control</b> <b>devices.</b> Many short tracks run mufflers in compliance with noise ordinances at some tracks; {{in the early years}} of the Camping World Truck Series, some races were held at venues which required mufflers, a requirement still used in NASCAR's K&N Pro Series (East and West) and Whelen (North and South) Modified Tours.|$|R

50|$|Exhaust {{emissions}} are cleaner {{because the more}} precise and accurate fuel metering reduces the concentration of toxic combustion byproducts leaving the engine.

It {{is also a}} major manufacturer of ceramic <b>emission</b> <b>control</b> <b>devices</b> for catalytic converters in {{cars and light trucks}} that use gasoline engines.

50|$|Monolithic {{catalyst}} supports are extruded substrates {{that are}} widely used in automotive and stationary <b>emission</b> <b>control</b> <b>devices</b> and other kind of reactors in the chemical industry. In automotive applications ceramic monoliths are made of synthetic cordierite, 2MgO*2Al2O3*5SiO2 which has a low thermal expansion coefficient. A monolithic catalyst support consists of many parallel channels separated by thin walls that are coated with the catalytic active substance, most commonly a metal like platinum. The channels may be round or polygonal (mainly square or hexagonal). The structure is reminiscent of a honeycomb. The cell density may be from 30 to 200/cm2 with the separating walls from 0.05 to 0.3 mm. Because of a high open frontal area (the open spaces in the cross-sectional area) of 72 to 87% pressure loss of gases flowing through the structure is low, an important feature to minimize efficiency losses in vehicles.|$|E
50|$|Diesel {{particulate}} matter burns when temperatures above 600 degrees Celsius are attained. This temperature {{can be reduced}} to somewhere in the range of 350 to 450 degrees Celsius by use of a fuel borne catalyst. The actual temperature of soot burn-out will depend on the chemistry employed. The start of combustion causes a further increase in temperature. In some cases, {{in the absence of a}} fuel borne catalyst, the combustion of the {{particulate matter}} can raise temperatures above the structural integrity threshold of the filter material, which can cause catastrophic failure of the substrate. Various strategies have been developed to limit this possibility. Note that unlike a spark-ignited engine, which typically has less than 0.5% oxygen in the exhaust gas stream before the <b>emission</b> <b>control</b> <b>device(s),</b> diesel engines have a very high ratio of oxygen available. While the amount of available oxygen makes fast regeneration of a filter possible, it also contributes to runaway regeneration problems.|$|E

5000|$|The 1970 240Z was {{introduced}} to the American market by Yutaka Katayama, president of Nissan Motors USA operations, widely known as [...] "Mr. K". The 1970 through the mid-1971 model year 240Z was referred to as the Series I. These early cars had many subtle but notable features differing from later cars. The most easily visible difference is that these early cars had a chrome [...] "240Z" [...] badge on the sail pillar, and two horizontal vents in the rear hatch below the glass molding providing flow through ventilation. In mid-1971, for the Series II 240Z-cars, the sail pillar emblems were restyled with just the letter [...] "Z" [...] placed in a circular vented emblem, and the vents were eliminated from the hatch panel of the car. Design changes for the US model 240Z occurred throughout production, including interior modifications for the 1972 model year, and a change in the location of the bumper over-riders, as well as the addition of some <b>emission</b> <b>control</b> <b>devices</b> and the adoption of a new style of emissions reducing carburetors for the 1973 model year.|$|E

Non-thermal VOHAP (Volatile Organic Hazardous Air Pollutant) <b>emission</b> <b>control</b> <b>devices</b> require additional maintenance. They also require the replacement of costly consumables such as activated carbon or they use large amounts of energy to regenerate the adsorbent. Large air flow rates and low VOHAP concentrations are frequently encountered in industrial processes.

40|$|Regulators {{have been}} {{concerned}} {{with the impact of}} environmental regulation on the profitability of regulated firms: there have been numerous grants and subsidy programs to reduce the cost of <b>emission</b> <b>control</b> equipment. Intuitively, there should be a monotonically increasing relationship between profits and the amount of subsidization. However, the author shows that this may not be so since regulation may establish a collusive outcome amongst oligopolistic competitors.

In hybrid mode, it had a maximum speed of 60 mph, which could be reached in 28 seconds. A speed of 40 mph could be attained in twelve seconds. The electric motor powered the car until it reached 10 mph, {{at which point the}} gasoline engine would kick in when running in hybrid mode.

50|$|As <b>emission</b> <b>control</b> {{strategies}} {{grew more}} sophisticated and effective, the amount of unburned and partially burned fuel in the exhaust stream shrank, and particularly when the catalytic converter was introduced, the function of secondary air injection shifted. Rather than being a primary <b>emission</b> <b>control</b> <b>device,</b> the secondary air injection system was adapted to support the efficient function of the catalytic converter. The original air injection point {{became known as the}} upstream injection point. When the engine is cold, air injected at this point cleans up the extra-rich exhaust and raises the temperature of the exhaust so as to bring the catalytic converter to operating temperature quickly. Once the engine is warm, air is injected to the downstream location — the catalytic converter itself — to assist with catalysis of unburned hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide.|$|R
