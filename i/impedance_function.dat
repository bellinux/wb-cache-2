40|$|The Department of Energy (DOE) {{operates}} many {{which are}} used to store radioactive waste material. The original design of the tanks was often based on criteria which did not meet current seismic codes. As a result DOE is undertaking {{a comprehensive review of}} the adequacy of these structures to meet current seismic standards. This comprehensive review includes an evaluation of soil-structure interaction. One method available for performing soil structure interaction analyses of structures couples a discrete model of the structure to a lumped parameter model of the soil. This method requires the knowledge of the expected dynamic stiffness and damping functions of the rigid, massless structure resting on the soil. These are commonly referred to as the <b>impedance</b> <b>functions.</b> Lumped parameter analysis is cost effective for the surface and embedded structure cases where <b>impedance</b> <b>functions</b> are available in the literature. For a complex case with the structure located on the surface surrounded by an embankment, the <b>impedance</b> <b>functions</b> must be established prior to using a lumped parameter model approach. The present paper describes the development of horizontal <b>impedance</b> <b>functions</b> for the structure surrounded by an embankment which are developed using a finite element approach as implemented by SASSI. <b>Impedance</b> <b>functions</b> for vertical, torsional, and rocking degrees of freedom can be developed in a similar manner.

40|$|International audienceRobust {{impedance}} estimation {{procedures are}} now in standard use in magnetotelluric (MT) measurements and research. These always yield impedance estimates which are better than the conventional least square (LS) estimation because the 'real' MT data almost never satisfy the statistical assumptions of Gaussian distribution upon which normal spectral analysis is based. The robust estimation procedures are commonly based on M-estimators that {{have the ability to}} reduce the influence of unusual data (outliers) in the response (electric field) variables, but are often not sensitive to exceptional predictors (magnetic field) data, which are termed leverage points. This paper proposes an alternative procedure for making reliably robust estimates of MT <b>impedance</b> <b>functions,</b> which simultaneously provide protection from the influence of outliers in both response and input variables. The means for accomplishing this is based on the bounded-influence regression M-estimation and the Hilbert Transform operating on the causal MT <b>impedance</b> <b>functions.</b> In the resulting regression estimates, outlier contamination is removed and the self consistency between the real and imaginary parts of the impedance estimates is guaranteed. Using synthetic and real MT data, it is shown that the method can produce improved MT <b>impedance</b> <b>functions</b> even under conditions of severe noise contamination...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{method is}} {{presented}} for including motional and eddy current effects when analytically modeling electrical <b>impedance</b> <b>functions</b> of cylindrical magnetostrictive transducers. To approximate eddy current effects, one-dimensional analytical constant parameter linear electromagnetic models of a cylindrical magnetostrictive transducer are developed. Maxwell's equations are solved for {{the magnetic field}} strength {{as a function of}} radial position. Closed form expressions for magnetic flux as a function of radial position are then derived, from which transducer electrical <b>impedance</b> <b>functions</b> are formulated. Two different physical models of the transducer are considered. The first model results in the classic eddy current solution for a rod in a wound wire solenoid. The second physical model includes the effects of a conducting external cylindrical housing. Motional effects are incorporated into the electromagnetic models via the magnetomechanical model, which is a frequency and load dependent, complex valued expression for the "dynamic magnetic permeability " of the magnetostrictive material within the transducer. The functional form for this dynamic magnetic permeability is derived by comparing the transduction equations for the magnetostrictive material with those for the transducer containing the material. Electrical <b>impedance</b> <b>functions</b> for both physical models are compared with an experimental measurement for a particular magnetostrictive transducer (using Terfenol-D) in its lo...|$|R

Because of computational intensity, these formulations tended to aggregate traffic zones into larger districts or rings in estimation. In current application, some models, including for instance the transportation planning model used in Portland, Oregon, use a logit formulation for destination choice. Allen (1984) used utilities from a logit based mode choice model in determining composite impedance for trip distribution. However, that approach, using mode choice log-sums implies that destination choice depends on the same variables as mode choice.

The application of these models differs in concept in that the gravity model uses impedance by travel time, perhaps stratified by socioeconomic variables, in determining the probability of trip making, while a discrete choice approach brings those variables inside the utility or <b>impedance</b> <b>function.</b> Discrete choice models require more information to estimate and more computational time.|$|E

40|$|The overall {{objective}} of this dissertation is to propose a quick and accurate method of updating transducer models. When one makes measurements on a piezoelectric transducer, oftentimes only the <b>impedance</b> <b>function</b> is measured as the experimental data. Thus, to perform model updating for transducers, two major tasks will be covered: (i) developing and verifying an efficient method for estimating the electric <b>impedance</b> <b>function</b> of a transducer, and (ii) developing and testing a FE model updating method for piezoelectric transducers. ^ The proposed method to estimate the <b>impedance</b> <b>function</b> of a transducer is a Laplace domain method. It expresses both the voltage and current in their partial-fraction forms in the Laplace domain, and obtains the <b>impedance</b> <b>function</b> of the transducer from {{the ratio of the}} voltage and current. The Prony-SS method is employed to extract the poles and residues of the voltage and current signals. Compared with traditional methods, the proposed method uses the transient signals, and will not suffer any leakage problems or resolution issues. In addition, this method requires only very short signals to obtain the <b>impedance</b> <b>function,</b> and is excellent for rejecting noise. ^ This proposed model-updating method is a multi-physics FE model-updating method, including the correction of the elastic material properties based on a short-circuit model, and the correction of dielectric and piezoelectric parameters based on an open-circuit model. The fundamental updating algorithm employed in both steps is the cross-model cross-mode (CMCM) method. In addition to its accuracy and efficiency, this method has the advantages of both the direct matrix methods and indirect physical property-adjustment methods. Implementing the CMCM algorithm requires a knowledge of both the measured modal frequencies and the corresponding mode shapes, but a measured <b>impedance</b> <b>function</b> could provide only modal frequencies for short- and open-circuit transducers. When dealing with the incomplete modal information, an iterative procedure is taken. In each iteration, the 2 ÃÜ 2 measured 2 ÃÜ 2 mode shapes are approximated by the mode shapes obtained from the previous iteration 2 ÃÜ 7 s updated FE model. ^ In this study, we employed a tube transducer, which is made of piezoceramic material, to develop and test new methods of estimating the <b>impedance</b> <b>function</b> and updating piezoelectric constitutive properties. Both computer simulations and lab experiments have been conducted to verify the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed methods. ...|$|E
