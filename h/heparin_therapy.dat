30|$|When {{patients}} {{have a high}} risk of thromboembolism, either continuation of antithrombotic agents or discontinuation of antithrombotic agents with <b>heparin</b> bridging <b>therapy</b> is required. As a definitive recommendation regarding the management of antithrombotic agents before TRUS biopsy is yet to be established, the benefits and adverse effects of <b>heparin</b> bridging <b>therapy</b> are debatable. Clinicians have traditionally discontinued antithrombotic agents and started <b>heparin</b> bridging <b>therapy,</b> depending on the risk of thrombotic events (Douketis et al. 2008; El-Hakim and Moussa 2010). The guidelines for the management of antithrombotic agents for endoscopic procedures suggest <b>heparin</b> bridging <b>therapy</b> for higher-risk procedures (e.g., polypectomy) in high-risk patients (e.g., those with atrial fibrillation with mechanical valves, valvular heart disease, and/or a history of cerebrovascular accidents, and those who experience transient ischemic attacks) (Murasaki 2011). A recent prospective study suggested that <b>heparin</b> bridging <b>therapy</b> increased the risk of bleeding complications from interruption alone (0.8 %) to bridging (13 %) in colonoscopy and oral and ophthalmic surgeries (Garcia et al. 2008). However, there is little reliable evidence for the benefits and harm associated with <b>heparin</b> bridging <b>therapy</b> in TRUS biopsy. To our knowledge, this is the first report to describe the risk of <b>heparin</b> bridging <b>therapy</b> for TRUS biopsy in patients requiring temporary discontinuation of antithrombotic agents. Our data suggested that discontinuation of antithrombotic agents with <b>heparin</b> bridging <b>therapy</b> increased the incidence of complications after TRUS biopsy. Furthermore, there was an increase in bleeding-related complications and urinary tract infections. Although the majority of complication grades were low (1 or 2), the incidence rate of complications was significantly higher in heparin bridging patients than in control patients. Similarly to a previous study (Garcia et al. 2008), our results suggested the possibility that <b>heparin</b> bridging <b>therapy</b> may cause more harm than good. From a different perspective, this is reasonable because patients who are indicated for <b>heparin</b> bridging <b>therapy</b> have a number of severe comorbidities. In fact, our patients treated with <b>heparin</b> bridging <b>therapy</b> had a significantly higher prevalence of diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Therefore, it is possible that those patients who were recommended <b>heparin</b> bridging <b>therapy</b> have a high risk for complications, and careful management of such complications is required in these patients.|$|R

The location of the clot is tender and the clot can be felt as a nodule under the skin. Trousseau's syndrome is a rare variant of venous thromboembolism (VTE) that is characterized by recurrent, migratory thrombosis in superficial veins and in uncommon sites, such as the chest wall and arms. This syndrome is particularly associated with pancreatic and lung cancer.Trousseau's syndrome can be an early sign of gastric or pancreatic cancer, typically appearing months to years before the tumor would be otherwise detected. <b>Heparin</b> <b>therapy</b> is recommended to prevent future clots.

40|$|Background: For {{endoscopic}} interventions, <b>heparin</b> bridging <b>therapy</b> {{is recommended}} {{in patients who}} {{are at high risk}} from interruption of antithrombotic <b>therapy.</b> Although <b>heparin</b> bridging has been reported to be effective in preventing thrombosis, several reports have raised concerns about increased risk of bleeding. The aim {{of this study was to}} clarify complications of hepari bridging therapy in therapeutic endoscopy. Methods: A nationwide multicenter survey using questionnaire was performed about patients undergoing therapeutic endoscopy with heparin bridging. Patients who underwent therapeutic endoscopy without <b>heparin</b> bridging <b>therapy</b> were considered as controls. Compliance scores of <b>heparin</b> bridging <b>therapy</b> guideline were employed, and association was analyzed between the score and occurrence of post-procedural bleeding. Results: The incidence of post-procedural bleeding was significantly higher (13. 5 %, 33 / 245) in the heparin group compared with the control group (2. 7 %, 299 / 11102) (p < 0. 001). Thrombosis occurred in 1 patient each in the two groups. In the heparin group, post-procedural bleeding was more likely to be delayed bleeding. Dose adjustment of heparin was a significant factor contributing to bleeding. The compliance score of <b>heparin</b> bridging <b>therapy</b> guideline was significantly higher in those who suffered bleeding. Conclusions: <b>Heparin</b> bridging <b>therapy</b> significantly increased the risk of post-procedural bleeding compared with the control.

40|$|International audienceD-dimer {{testing is}} useful for the {{exclusion}} of acute venous thromboembolism (VTE). Anticoagulant therapy is expected to reduce D-dimer levels in patients with thrombosis and, consequently, {{it may not be}} safe to use D-dimer levels to exclude VTE after anticoagulant therapy has been started. The objectives of this study were to estimate the decrease in D-dimer levels after 24 h of <b>heparin</b> <b>therapy</b> and, applying this estimate to the results of a recent study, to calculate the expected reduction in sensitivity. Using pre-defined criteria, we first performed a literature review to determine whether, and by how much, D-dimer levels decrease within 24 h of starting <b>heparin</b> <b>therapy</b> in patients with acute VTE. Using D-dimer levels that were measured in a prospective study of patients with confirmed deep vein thrombosis and/or pulmonary embolism as baselines, we then determined the change in sensitivity (and specificity) that would result from the fall in D-dimer levels that the literature review suggested would have occurred after 24 h of <b>heparin</b> <b>therapy.</b> On the basis of the literature review, we calculated that mean D-dimer levels decrease by 25 %, 24 h after starting <b>heparin</b> <b>therapy</b> in patients with acute VTE.

30|$|To {{carefully}} {{assess the}} benefits and adverse effects, risk classification is necessary. One of the major risk classifications is the CHADS 2 score (Gage et al. 2004).

Based on the CHADS 2 score, this decision pertaining to the treatment modality should be discussed with the patient and the primary physician managing the antithrombotic agents. To assess the accuracy and reliability of CHADS 2 scores in clinical practice, we selected 68 patients who were taking warfarin and compared the PT-INR and CHADS 2 scores between patients with and without <b>heparin</b> bridging <b>therapy.</b> Our data showed that the target level of PT-INR was significantly higher in patients with <b>heparin</b> bridging <b>therapy.</b> However, no relationship was observed between the CHADS 2 score and a recommendation for <b>heparin</b> bridging <b>therapy.</b> This finding suggests the difficulty in truly defining risk stratification and decision making, and highlights the urgent need for large-scale randomized clinical trials to evaluate the management of continuation of antithrombotic agents or bridging therapy in patients undergoing TRUS biopsy.|$|R

30|$|As the world’s {{population}} ages rapidly, {{a relatively}} high proportion of patients are on prescribed medication for comorbidities; these medications include long-term antithrombotic therapy using low-dose aspirin, clopidogrel/ticlopidine, and warfarin. Several prospective studies support the safety of continuation of low-dose aspirin in TRUS biopsy (Giannarini et al. 2007; Maan et al. 2003). Conversely, no recommendation exists regarding the management of non-aspirin antithrombotic agents (warfarin or clopidogrel/ticlopidine) before a TRUS biopsy. Clinicians have three options for management, depending on the risk of thrombosis. First, antithrombotic agents can be continued during procedures associated with low rates of bleeding complications. Second, they can be discontinued for several days prior to the procedure and restarted thereafter. Third, they can be discontinued with bridging anticoagulation using <b>heparin</b> (<b>heparin</b> bridging <b>therapy),</b> administered during the sub-therapeutic window, in patients {{at high risk of}} thromboembolic events (Douketis et al. 2008; El-Hakim and Moussa 2010). However, there are few prospective studies regarding the relationship between TRUS biopsy and continuation of antithrombotic agents. Furthermore, the safety of short-term discontinuation of antithrombotic agents with <b>heparin</b> bridging <b>therapy</b> in TRUS biopsy has not been well documented.

The control group included patients not administered any antithrombotic agents or those with temporary discontinuation of antithrombotic agents. Clinical indication of <b>heparin</b> bridging <b>therapy</b> was assessed by the physician who had medicated the patient with antithrombotic agents, according to the individual risks of thromboembolism. A 10 - to 12 -core TRUS biopsy was performed, and patients were surveyed to evaluate any complications and bleeding-related events. The incidence of complications and grades for each group was assessed by reference of medical charts, according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 4.0). Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the risk factors for the incidence of complications (of any grade), including age, heparin bridging, presence of comorbidities (diabetes mellitus and hypertension), number of biopsy cores, and the CHADS 2 score (congestive heart failure: 1 point; hypertension: 1 point; age 75 or older: 1 point; diabetes mellitus: 1 point; prior stroke or transient ischemic attack or thromboembolism: 2 points). The CHADS 2 score is a clinical prediction rule for estimating the risk of stroke in patients with non-rheumatic atrial fibrillation that is a common and serious heart arrhythmia associated with thromboembolic stroke (Gage et al. 2001). To evaluate the accuracy and reliability of the CHADS 2 score in clinical practice, we compared the international normalized ratio of prothrombin time (PT-INR) and CHADS 2 score between heparin bridging and non-bridging heparin-administered patients.|$|R
