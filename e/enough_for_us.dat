500|$|Director Dominic Polcino and the animators of {{the episode}} were praised for their efforts by the other staff members, {{especially}} during the scene where Homer is driving down the cliff and attempts to escape Moe's car. Polcino and his animators {{went to great lengths}} to correctly time Homer's rolling and create a vivid and detailed lake, as well as animate Homer sinking to the bottom of the lake. Show runner Mike Scully commented that, [...] "It's hard <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> to come up with the ideas, but when Dominic and the animators can make it, it's really fantastic." ...|$|E

She also visited Boston University's [...] "hackerspace" [...] workshop, known as [...] "Builds", and met its founder, David House, the MIT researcher who was later allowed to visit her in jail. In November 2008, she gave an anonymous interview to a high-school reporter during a rally in Syracuse in support of gay marriage: I {{was kicked out of}} my home and I once lost my job. The world is not moving fast <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> at home, work, or the battlefield. I've been living a double life. ... I can't make a statement. I can't be caught in an act.

500|$|The {{polar group}} {{continued}} towards the Pole, passing Shackleton's Furthest South (88°23'S) on [...] Seven days later, about [...] from their goal, Amundsen's black flag was spotted {{and the party}} knew {{that they had been}} forestalled. They reached the Pole the next day, [...] 1912: [...] "The Pole. Yes, but under very different circumstances from those expected... Great God! This is an awful place and terrible <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> to have laboured to it without the reward of priority. Well, it is something to have got here" [...] Scott still hoped to race Amundsen to the telegraph cablehead in Australia: [...] "Now for a desperate struggle to get the news through first. I wonder if we can do it." [...] However, on 18 January 1912 they discovered Amundsen's tent, some supplies, a letter to King HaakonVII of Norway (which Amundsen politely asked Scott to deliver) and a note stating that Amundsen had arrived there with four companions on [...] 1911.|$|E
500|$|IGN Todd Gilchrist {{called it}} Bay's best film, and [...] "one {{of the few}} {{instances}} where it's OK to enjoy something for being smart and dumb at the same time, mostly because it's undeniably also {{a whole lot of}} fun". The Advertiser Sean Fewster found the visual effects so seamless that [...] "you may come to believe the studio somehow engineered artificial intelligence". The Denver Post Lisa Kennedy praised the depiction of the robots as having [...] "a believably rendered scale and intimacy", and ABC presenter Margaret Pomeranz was surprised [...] "that a complete newcomer to the Transformers phenomenon like myself became involved in the fate of these mega-machines". Ain't It Cool News's Drew McWeeny felt most of the cast grounded the story, and that [...] "it has a real sense of wonder, one of the things that's missing from so much of the big CGI lightshows released these days". Author Peter David found it ludicrous fun, and said that [...] " [...] manages to hold on to his audience's suspension of disbelief long <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> to segue into some truly spectacular battle scenes". Roger Ebert gave the film a positive review, giving it 3 stars out of a possible 4, writing: [...] "It's goofy fun with a lot of stuff that blows up real good, and it has the grace not only to realize how preposterous it is, but to make that into an asset." ...|$|E

2500|$|When A {{announced}} {{the cancellation of}} Nero Wolfe in August 2002, the network took {{the unusual step of}} posting an [...] "Important Message" [...] on its website: [...] "We at A remain extremely proud of Nero Wolfe. It is a high quality, beautifully produced and entertaining show, unlike anything else currently on the television landscape. Although it performed moderately well amongst tough competition for two seasons, it simply did not do well <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> {{to be able to go}} on making it, given the current television climate." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{contrast}} to the views of John Calvin and Philipp Melanchthon, throughout his life Luther maintained {{that it was not}} false doctrine to believe that a Christian's soul sleeps after it is separated from the body in death. Accordingly, he disputed traditional interpretations of some Bible passages, such as the parable of the rich man and Lazarus. This also led Luther to reject the idea of torments for the saints: [...] "It is <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> to know that souls do not leave their bodies to be threatened by the torments and punishments of hell, but enter a prepared bedchamber in which they sleep in peace." [...] He also rejected the existence of Purgatory, which involved Christian souls undergoing penitential suffering after death. He affirmed the continuity of one's personal identity beyond death. In his Smalcald Articles, he described the saints as currently residing [...] "in their graves and in heaven." ...|$|E

2500|$|The general {{consensus}} of modern scholars is that Mark {{was the first}} gospel to be written and dates from no earlier than c.65 AD, while Matthew and Luke, which {{use it as a}} source, were written between 80/85 AD. The composition history of John is complex, but most scholars see it taking place in stages beginning as early as before 70 AD and extending as late {{as the end of the}} century. None of the authors were eyewitnesses to the life of Jesus, nor did they receive their information directly from eyewitnesses. Mythicist Richard Carrier is thus in agreement with mainstream scholarship when he states: [...] "The Gospels cannot really be dated, nor are the real authors known. Their names were assigned early, but not early <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> to be confident they were accurately known. It is based on speculation that Mark was the first, written between AD 60 and 70, Matthew second, between AD 70 and 80, Luke (and Acts) third, between AD 80 and 90, and John last, between AD 90 and 100".|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Australian journalist Nick Milligan on 25 March 2011, Anderson explained, [...] "I was in Los Angeles in 1989 recording an album which the 'Bound For Glory' single came off and I was hanging around with the Gunners {{and a lot of}} other LA bad boy rock bands that we supposedly influenced. I realised then that apart from the fact that I was there to establish myself as a singer songwriter, there was still this great following for the band. I rang up the other members and said 'Let's reform. We've been apart for three years or more.' It was long <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> to settle our differences and let all the wounds heal. I rang up each of the original members that were still interested and they all said, 'Yeah, let's get together.' So I said we should negotiate a deal where the band can come over and record in Los Angeles. But, of course, that was the year that our original drummer [...] "Digger" [...] Royall kicked his heroin habit. While he was recovering on methadone, cancer exploded through his body, quite sadly. That was the irony of it, because the cancer had been suppressed by the heroin addiction. Within months he was dead. That shook the band so badly on a personal level, because we had been so enthusiastic to reform. We didn't reform until '92. In '93, the word got around, because we had reformed with our existing drummer Paul DeMarco. The Gunners heard we were out playing again and said, 'We want you to do our support gigs throughout Australia.' We did those two Guns N' Roses raceways gigs - Eastern Creek in Sydney and the raceway down in Melbourne." ...|$|E
