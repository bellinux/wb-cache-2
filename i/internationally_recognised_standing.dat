40|$|This report summarises our {{findings}} on the progress {{with the implementation of}} the 'Robertsâ€™ Skills Recommendations'. The report addresses the points in our Terms of Reference. The panel is pleased with the progress made and the foundations that are now in place {{for the development of the}} generic skills of researchers and the attention now paid to the development of their careers whether in academia or elsewhere. The panel does, however, see risks that the <b>internationally</b> <b>recognised</b> high <b>standing</b> achieved in such matters in the UK, may be lost with uncertainties over future funding mechanisms. We have highlighted our recommendations that we hope will alert stakeholders to the points that need specific attention. Underlying these was the striking observation that the greatest recognition for what has been achieved, is emanating from outside the UK in the international academic community. Therefore considerably greater focus should be paid to engaging with stakeholders outside academia, particularly the employers and potential employers of those who have trained as researchers, to find and optimise the ways in which future development may benefit all involved in relatively shorter timescales...|$|R
