40|$|The Nevada Supreme Court {{interpreted}} the NRS 17. 030 – 17. 080 judgment debtor statutes and found: (1) that a <b>joint</b> <b>debtor</b> action {{gives rise to}} a final, appealable judgment that precludes review through a petition for extraordinary writ relief; and (2) that the principles governing extraordinary writ relief prevent a petitioner from challenging a void order when the petitioner had the opportunity to appeal the challenged order...|$|E
40|$|This study aims to {{evaluate}} the impact of productive microcredit provided by a microfinance institution linked to a commercial bank by examining a sample of 20, 628 customers. Academic literature points {{to the existence of}} shared specific characteristics amongst successful microcredit programs, including: (a) the use of a solidarity group, also called a <b>joint</b> <b>debtor,</b> (b) strong female participation, (c) a focus on poor regions, and (d) the presence of a loan officer. This article finds that the female variable is associated with increased income for the individual participant. Women began the program with an average sales value less than men, yet their sales grew exponentially at about 10 % with each extension of credit...|$|E
50|$|The {{absolute}} effect {{means that}} one juristic act affects all <b>joint</b> several <b>debtors</b> {{in the same}} way. For example, the creditor can demand the obligation in full amount from either party. The performance from one several liability debtor affects also the others and the creditor cannot refuse it without being in default. In this case the creditor will be in default towards all joint several liability debtors.The autonomy of the different obligations undertaken by the <b>joint</b> several liability <b>debtors</b> {{is the reason for}} one juristic act that affects some of the obligations not have any effect on the others. This hypothesis is described by the term “relative effect of the joint several liability”. The obligations of the <b>joint</b> several <b>debtors</b> might have different due dates. As a rule the default of the debtor worsens his financial situation. That is why the default of one of the <b>joint</b> several liability <b>debtors</b> does not have any harmful consequences for the others. Another rule that can describe the relative effect of the joint several liability is that when the performance becomes impossible and only one of the debtors is responsible for that, the creditor may claim from the latter full damages. The limitation period also have a relative effect.If one of the <b>joint</b> several liability <b>debtors</b> to have performed in full amount to the creditor for him to have a regress claim against his co-debtors but only for him to have paid more than his share.|$|R

First, what is {{the economic}} rationale for having a bankruptcy procedure at all and what defines an economically efficient bankruptcy procedure? Second, why did the number of U. S. bankruptcy filings increase so dramatically between 1980 and 2005 ? Third, a major bankruptcy reform {{went into effect in}} the U. S. in 2005 [...] what did it do and how did it affect credit and mortgage markets? Finally, the paper discusses the mortgage crisis, the high social cost of foreclosures, and the difficulty of avoiding foreclosure by voluntarily renegotiation of mortgage contracts, even when such renegotiations are in the <b>joint</b> interest of <b>debtors</b> and creditors. I also discuss {{the pros and cons of}} government programs to refinance mortgages and the possibility of giving bankruptcy judges new power to change the terms of mortgage contracts in bankruptcy. ...|$|R
