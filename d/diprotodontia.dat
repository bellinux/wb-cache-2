5|$|The koala is {{classified}} with wombats (family Vombatidae) and several extinct families (including marsupial tapirs, marsupial lions and giant wombats) in the suborder Vombatiformes within the order <b>Diprotodontia.</b> The Vombatiformes are a sister group to a clade that includes macropods (kangaroos and wallabies) and possums. The ancestors of vombatiforms were likely arboreal, and the koala's lineage was possibly {{the first to}} branch off around 40 million years ago during the Eocene.|$|E
25|$|The mammal fauna of New Guinea is {{composed}} of all extant subclasses of mammal: the monotremes, placentals and marsupials. New Guinea contains {{the largest number of}} monotreme species of any land mass, with only one species absent: the platypus (Ornithorhynchus anatinus). The marsupial fauna of New Guinea is diverse, consisting of the three orders: Dasyuromorphia, Peramelemorphia and <b>Diprotodontia.</b>|$|E
25|$|Herbivorous {{marsupials}} {{are classified}} in the order <b>Diprotodontia,</b> and further into the suborders Vombatiformes and Phalangerida. The Vombatiformes include the koala and the three species of wombat. One of Australia's best-known marsupials, the koala is an arboreal species that feeds on the leaves of various species of eucalyptus. Wombats, on the other hand, live {{on the ground and}} feed on grasses, sedges and roots. Wombats use their rodent-like front teeth and powerful claws to dig extensive burrow systems; they are mainly crepuscular and nocturnal.|$|E
500|$|The pelage of the koala {{is thicker}} and {{longer on the}} back, and shorter on the belly. The ears have thick fur on both the inside and outside. The back fur colour varies from light grey to {{chocolate}} brown. The belly fur is whitish; on the rump it is dappled whitish, and darker at the back. [...] The koala has the most effective insulating back fur of any marsupial and is highly resilient to wind and rain, while the belly fur can reflect solar radiation. The koala's curved, sharp claws are well adapted for climbing trees. The large forepaws have two opposable digits (the first and second, which are opposable to the other three) {{that allow them to}} grasp small branches. On the hindpaws, the second and third digits are fused, a typical condition for members of the <b>Diprotodontia,</b> and the attached claws (which are still separate) are used for grooming. As in humans and other primates, koalas have friction ridges on their paws. The animal has a sturdy skeleton and a short, muscular upper body with proportionately long upper limbs that contribute to its climbing and grasping abilities. Additional climbing strength is achieved with thigh muscles that attach to the shinbone lower than other animals. The koala has a cartilaginous pad {{at the end of the}} spine that may make it more comfortable when it perches in the fork of a tree.|$|E

50|$|About {{two-thirds of}} Australian {{marsupials}} {{belong to the}} order <b>Diprotodontia,</b> which is split into three suborders: the Vombatiformes (wombats and the koala, four species in total); the large and diverse Phalangeriformes (the possums and gliders) and Macropodiformes (kangaroos, potoroos, wallabies and the musky rat-kangaroo). Note: this classification is based on Ruedas & Morales 2005.|$|E
50|$|The mammal fauna of New Guinea is {{composed}} of all extant subclasses of mammal: the monotremes, placentals and marsupials. New Guinea contains {{the largest number of}} monotreme species of any land mass, with only one species absent: the platypus (Ornithorhynchus anatinus). The marsupial fauna of New Guinea is diverse, consisting of the three orders: Dasyuromorphia, Peramelemorphia and <b>Diprotodontia.</b>|$|E
50|$|All {{members of}} the order are polyprotodont (have several pairs of lower front teeth) - {{in the case of}} the Peramelemorphia, three pairs. This {{suggests}} that they have evolved within Dasyuromorphia (marsupial carnivores). On the other hand, they also have an unusual feature in their feet: the second and third toes are fused together. This condition is called syndactyly, and is characteristic of the <b>Diprotodontia</b> (the order of marsupial herbivores that includes kangaroos, wombats, possums, and many others).|$|E
5000|$|The Phascolarctidae (Phasco - pouch or bag, larct- {{from the}} Greek arctos meaning bear) are {{a family of}} {{marsupials}} of the order <b>Diprotodontia,</b> consisting of only one extant species, the koala, and six well-known fossil species, with another five less well known fossil species, and two fossil species of the genus Koobor, whose taxonomy is debatable but are placed in this group. The closest relatives of the Phascolarctidae are the wombats, which comprise the family Vombatidae.|$|E
5000|$|... “Kangaroos (aka macropods) {{belong to}} a large, mostly herbivorous Australasian {{marsupial}} clade termed <b>Diprotodontia.</b> Shared characters that unite diprotodontians include diprotodonty (where there are just two lower incisors), a special epitympanic wing of the squamosal bone in the braincase, {{and the presence of}} an extra band of fibres (termed the fasciculus aberrans) that connect the two hemispheres of the brain. The monophyly of <b>Diprotodontia</b> is also well supported by molecular characters,” [...] and indicates that Thylacoleo carnifex may have shared ancestry with wombats and kangaroos, which are generally believed to have been herbivores. Its shared bloodline meant that while its predecessors were herbivorous, the transfer to Australia by rafting, and the lack of adequate sustenance may have led to them evolving to becoming carnivores, which is an unprecedented occurrence. While it is now thought that T. carnifex was indeed a carnivore, its diet and behaviour have been intensely debated. In addition to an early description as a herbivore, [...] "the species has been speculatively portrayed as a consumer of crocodile eggs, a hyaena-like scavenger, a melon specialist, a leopard-like predator that dragged prey into trees, a slow-to-medium-paced runner incapable of climbing, a terrestrial version of a cookie-cutter shark or raider of kangaroo pouches, and a bear-like super-predator".|$|E
50|$|All {{the species}} of this order are native to Australia and New Guinea; {{however it is}} unclear how closely related this order is {{to the rest of the}} marsupials. The {{bandicoots}} have two features that suggest separate and quite opposite ideas of their evolution. They have three pairs of lower front incisors, which would usually suggest evolution from the order Dasyuromorphia, which consists of carnivorous marsupials; however, the bandicoot's middle two digits are syndactylous, meaning they are joined together except for the claw. This would suggest they share the common ancestor of the <b>Diprotodontia</b> which includes the kangaroos and koalas.|$|E
5000|$|Two key {{anatomical}} features, in combination, identify <b>Diprotodontia.</b> Members of {{the order}} are, first, [...] "diprotodont" [...] (meaning [...] "two front teeth"): they have a pair of large, procumbent incisors on the lower jaw, a common feature of many early groups of mammals and mammaliforms. The diprotodont jaw is short, usually with three pairs of upper incisors (wombats, like rodents have only one pair), and no lower canines. The second trait distinguishing diprotodonts is [...] "syndactyly", a fusing of {{the second and third}} digits of the foot up {{to the base of the}} claws, which leaves the claws themselves separate. [...] Digit five is usually absent, and digit four is often greatly enlarged.|$|E
50|$|This {{family of}} the order <b>Diprotodontia,</b> {{which can be found}} in the east coast and inland of Australia and in some islands of New Guinea, is {{characterized}} by their very small size, which has side effects: because their mass-to-surface-area ratio is so small, heat escapes quicker from their bodies than it would in larger animals (the larger the mass-to-surface-area ratio, the harder it is to get rid of heat). Therefore, when temperature drops or food is scarce, they have trouble maintaining their body temperature and they enter a state known as torpidity (not to be confused with hibernation, which is not known in marsupials) which can last between one day and two weeks. In this state, the animal's breathing slows down, its temperature drops to almost that of its surroundings, and the animal becomes unresponsive.|$|E
5000|$|The {{marsupial}} omnivores {{include the}} bandicoots and bilbies, order Peramelemorphia. There are seven species in Australia, {{most of which}} are endangered. These small creatures share several characteristic physical features: a plump, arch-backed body with a long, delicately tapering snout, large upright ears, long thin legs, and a thin tail. The evolutionary origin of this group is unclear, but they share characteristics from both carnivorous and herbivorous marsupials.The marsupial herbivores are classified in the order <b>Diprotodontia,</b> and further into the suborders Vombatiformes, Phalangeriformes and Macropodiformes. The Vombatiformes include the koala and the three species of wombat. One of Australia's best-known marsupials, the koala is an arboreal (tree-dwelling) species that feeds on the leaves of some 120 species of eucalyptus. Wombats, on the other hand, live on the ground and feed on grasses, sedges and roots. Wombats use their rodent-like front teeth and powerful claws to dig extensive burrow systems; they are mainly crepuscular and nocturnal. Wombats are also well known for their backwards facing pouches.|$|E
50|$|The Ilariidae are {{a family}} of three species of extinct {{marsupials}} in two genera. They are all found in the middle Tertiary assemblage of South Australia, and are closely related to the family Phascolarctidae, which was found in Hamilton, Victoria. I. illumidens is the best-preserved representative of this extinct clade of vombatiforms. The species is found in the Namba Formation of late Oligocene age, Lake Pinpa, South Australia. The material consists of a partial cranium and mandibular fragments with most of the dentition, together with parts of the postcranial skeleton. The other species in this family are known from a few jaw fragments and intact molars attached; they are categorised in a separate family because their teeth structure is unique among <b>Diprotodontia,</b> in having a complicated folding pattern. Ilariids are thought to be the largest marsupials of their time in the Lake Eyre and Tarkarooloo basin, and lived along with Wynyardiidae, Obdurodon, and thylacoleonids (marsupial lions) such as Priscileo and Wakaleo.|$|E
50|$|The {{marsupial}} lion {{is classified}} in the order <b>Diprotodontia</b> {{along with many other}} well-known marsupials such as kangaroos, possums, and the koala. It is further classified in its own family, the Thylacoleonidae, of which three genera and 11 species are recognised, all extinct. The term marsupial lion (lower case) is often applied to other members of this family. Distinct possum-like characteristics led Thylacoleo to be regarded as members of Phalangeroidea for a few decades. Though a few authors continued to hint at phalangeroid affinities for thylacoleonids as recently as the 1990s, cranial and other characters have generally led to their inclusion within vombatiformes, and as stem-members of the wombat lineage. Marsupial lions and other ecologically and morphologically diverse vombatiforms were once represented by over 60 species of carnivorous, herbivorous, terrestrial and arboreal forms ranging in size from 3 kg to 2.5 metric tons. Only two families represented by four herbivorous species (koalas and three species of wombat) have survived into modern times and are considered the marsupial lion's closest living relatives.|$|E
50|$|The koala is {{classified}} with wombats (family Vombatidae) and several extinct families (including marsupial tapirs, marsupial lions and giant wombats) in the suborder Vombatiformes within the order <b>Diprotodontia.</b> The Vombatiformes are a sister group to a clade that includes macropods (kangaroos and wallabies) and possums. The ancestors of vombatiforms were likely arboreal, and the koala's lineage was possibly {{the first to}} branch off around 40 million years ago during the Eocene.The modern koala is the only extant member of Phascolarctidae, a family that once included several genera and species. During the Oligocene and Miocene, koalas lived in rainforests and had less specialised diets. Some species, such as the Riversleigh rainforest koala (Nimiokoala greystanesi) and some species of Perikoala, were around {{the same size as}} the modern koala, while others, such as species of Litokoala, were one-half to two-thirds its size. Like the modern species, prehistoric koalas had well developed ear structures which suggests that long-distance vocalising and sedentism developed early. During the Miocene, the Australian continent began drying out, leading to the decline of rainforests and the spread of open Eucalyptus woodlands. The genus Phascolarctos split from Litokoala in the late Miocene and had several adaptations that allowed it to live on a specialised eucalyptus diet: a shifting of the palate towards the front of the skull; larger molars and premolars; smaller pterygoid fossa; and a larger gap between the molar and the incisor teeth.|$|E
