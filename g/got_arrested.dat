At the age of thirteen, he joined the Royal Navy as a midshipman, and was present at the Battle of Cape St Vincent in 1780. His {{experiences}} in the navy seem to have been little different from those of other midshipmen, though in contrast to other sailors he was accompanied on board ships by a tutor. He did his share of the cooking and <b>got</b> <b>arrested</b> with his shipmates after a drunken brawl in Gibraltar; he was hastily released from custody after his identity became known.|$|E

By 1985, Israeli forces withdrew to a 15km wide southern strip of Lebanon, following which the conflict continued on a lower scale, with relatively low casualties on both sides. In 1993 and 1996, Israel launched major operations against the Shiite militia of Hezbollah, {{which had become}} an emergent threat. In May 2000, the newly elected government of Ehud Barak authorized a withdrawal from Southern Lebanon, fulfilling an election promise to do so well ahead of a declared deadline.

25|$|The main feud for the SmackDown! brand {{was between}} Eddie Guerrero and Kurt Angle for the WWE Championship. In the {{beginning}} of 2004, Angle and Guerrero were allies while Guerrero feuded with his nephew Chavo Guerrero. On SmackDown! on January 29, Eddie Guerrero last eliminated Angle in a 15-man Royal Rumble style match to earn {{a shot at the}} WWE Championship. At the prior pay per view, No Way Out, Kurt Angle defeated The Big Show and John Cena in a Triple threat match to earn himself a title shot at WrestleMania on the same event where Guerrero defeated Brock Lesnar for the WWE title. On the February 19 episode of SmackDown!, Angle was the special guest referee in a match between WWE Champion, Eddie Guerrero and WWE Cruiserweight Champion, Chavo Guerrero. As Eddie was about to close in on the victory, Angle stopped the 3 count and would turn on Guerrero. On the following week's SmackDown!, Guerrero was eager to get his revenge on Angle while looking for him but when he finally saw Angle, he shoved SmackDown General Manager, Paul Heyman and his assistant Dawn Marie out of his way only for Heyman to have Guerrero escorted out of the arena by security. Guerrero was scheduled to team with John Cena to take on Chavo Guerrero and the Big Show in a tag team match on that night but due to Guerrero being escorted out of the arena, he was replaced by Rey Mysterio for the tag match, which Mysterio and Cena won. Later that night, Angle appeared and stated that he attacked Guerrero for the SmackDown! fans and for the WWE. He then referred to Guerrero as a former drug addict that shouldn't represent SmackDown! as the WWE Champion and stated that one day people would be thanking him for a champion to be proud of. Guerrero then re-entered the arena and assaulted Angle until he <b>got</b> <b>arrested</b> by orders of Paul Heyman. As Guerrero got taken out of the building in handcuffs, Angle made some insulting comments to him before the officers drove away with Guerrero in the Police car. On the March 4 episode of SmackDown!, during Guerrero's match with Heyman (while he was handcuffed), Angle interfered and knocked him down a few times until Guerrero defended himself by spitting on Angle. As Guerrero begged Angle to nail him with the WWE Championship belt, Angle did so and raised title the belt overhead to hype their match at Wrestlemania XX.|$|E

[...] The Labour demonstration of 1892 were subsequently fixed till February 1 when the council had a meeting in the Stock Exchange Building. [...] To avoid the demonstration prohibition from 1848, people gathered on various locations to unite on the square. [...] As they run across MPs and other bigwigs on Slottsbacken, they were stopped by the police from reaching the square. [...] Surrounding alleys quickly got clogged by demonstrators, however, and the cordon had to give way to the crowd whose cries and protest songs quickly filled the square. [...] The future PM Hjalmar Branting got involved in a dispute before the crowd threatened to intrude the Stock Exchange Build from Trångsund. [...] The police then got assistance from the Royal Body Guard who had demonstrators flee into the alleys to escape the horses and sabres. [...] Dozens <b>got</b> <b>arrested,</b> but a consequence of the manifestation was a growing awareness among politicians concerning the situation of the working force.|$|E
2500|$|According to the Gazette de la Régence, {{when the}} Duchess of Berry {{received}} the Russian emperor at the Luxembourg, she {{appeared at the}} reception [...] "stout as a tower" [...] ("puisssante comme une tour"), a rare idiom implying she was big with child. It is then (May 1717) that Voltaire (Arouet) <b>got</b> <b>arrested</b> after saying to a police informer that {{the daughter of the}} Regent was a whore, adding that she had retired for six months at La Muette to give birth. Dangeau's diary confirms that the Duchess spent most of Spring and Summer 1717 at her Château de la Muette. The Gazette de la Régence mentions that her prolonged stay there and also the fact she had given up hunting and horse-riding had given rise to salacious gossip. The Gazette de la Régence states that in early July, the Duchess, who by then kept secluded in La Muette, was being [...] "inconvenienced", [...] "having grown so big" [...] ("puissante”) that it was feared for her life! The “Gazette” reports by the end of July that Madame de Berry was rumored to be in critical condition as she was finally delivered of this new fruit of her amours. As in 1716, this clandestine birth was an open secret and satirical songwriters mocked the loose morality of the princess who always armed with a large c..k, gets f....d from both front and behind.

2500|$|Despite {{these few}} {{prolific}} plays, Damala was quickly forgotten or even deliberately {{ignored by the}} Parisian society, following his separation from the great diva. In March 1889, Bernhardt returned to Paris after a year-long European tour and receive a message from Damala who informed {{her that he was}} dying in Marseille and begged her to forgive him and take him back. The fact she had never stopped loving and caring for her husband was proved that very moment: she abandoned her performances in Paris, rushed to him and nursed Damala, whose health was wasted {{as a result of his}} longtime addiction. She took him in her house and after he recuperated, she cast him as her leading man in La Dame aux Camélias. Damala promised to stop taking morphine and embarked on a European tour with Bernhardt (which also included Egypt). In truth, Damala's addiction to drugs became progressively worse. He continued using the drug and occasionally ridiculed himself, his clarity severely reduced from the morphine. On one occasion, he almost <b>got</b> <b>arrested</b> for exhibiting himself naked in the Hotel de Ville in Milan. Damala reprised his role as Armand but after a six-week run he collapsed and was carried in the hospital. Shortly before his death, he was offered another role by Bernhardt, in the play Lena, at the Théâtre des Variêtés. [...] Just after the second performance, he was considered incapable of playing the part, due to his now permanent lack of clarity and continuous influence from alcohol and drugs.|$|E
