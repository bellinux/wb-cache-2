HP researchers investigated a new architecture, later named Explicitly Parallel Instruction Computing (EPIC), {{that allows the}} processor to execute multiple instructions in each clock cycle. EPIC implements a form of very long <b>instruction</b> <b>word</b> (VLIW) architecture, in which a single <b>instruction</b> <b>word</b> contains multiple instructions. With EPIC, the compiler determines in advance which instructions can be executed at the same time, so the microprocessor simply executes the instructions and does not need elaborate mechanisms to determine which instructions to execute in parallel.|$|E

25|$|Yet another impetus of both RISC {{and other}} designs came from {{practical}} measurements on real-world programs. Andrew Tanenbaum summed up many of these, demonstrating that processors often had oversized immediates. For instance, he showed that 98% {{of all the}} constants in a program would fit in 13 bits, yet many CPU designs dedicated 16 or 32 bits to store them. This suggests that, {{to reduce the number}} of memory accesses, a fixed length machine could store constants in unused bits of the <b>instruction</b> <b>word</b> itself, so that they would be immediately ready when the CPU needs them (much like immediate addressing in a conventional design). This required small opcodes in order to leave room for a reasonably sized constant in a 32-bit <b>instruction</b> <b>word.</b>|$|E

In 2011, AMD released the successor to TeraScale, Graphics Core Next (GCN). This new microarchitecture emphasized GPGPU compute capability in addition to graphics processing, with a particular aim of supporting heterogeneous computing on AMD's APUs. GCN's reduced instruction set ISA allowed for significantly increased compute capability over TeraScale's very long <b>instruction</b> <b>word</b> ISA. Since GCN's introduction with the HD 7970, five generations of the GCN architecture have been produced from 2008 through at least 2017.|$|E

A TTA <b>instruction</b> <b>word</b> is composed of multiple slots, one slot per bus, and each slot determines the data transport that takes place on the corresponding bus. The fine-grained control allows some optimizations that are not possible in a conventional processor.

This register must be changed every time control transfers between pages. PCLATH must also be preserved by any interrupt handler.|$|R

[...] This did not mean what the word means today (that a lower-level program fetched and interpreted the OPR instruction), but meant that each bit of the <b>instruction</b> <b>word</b> specified a certain action, and the programmer could achieve several actions in a single instruction cycle by setting multiple bits.

50|$|In 1989, HP {{began to}} become {{concerned}} that reduced instruction set computing (RISC) architectures were approaching a processing limit at one instruction per cycle. Both Intel and HP researchers had been exploring computer architecture options for future designs and separately began investigating {{a new concept}} known as very long <b>instruction</b> <b>word</b> (VLIW) which came out of research by Yale University in the early 1980s. VLIW is a computer architecture concept (like RISC and CISC) where a single <b>instruction</b> <b>word</b> contains multiple instructions encoded in one very long <b>instruction</b> <b>word</b> to facilitate the processor executing multiple instructions in each clock cycle. Typical VLIW implementations rely heavily on sophisticated compilers to determine at compile time which instructions can be executed {{at the same time}} and the proper scheduling of these instructions for execution and also to help predict the direction of branch operations. The value of this approach is to do more useful work in fewer clock cycles and to simplify processor instruction scheduling and branch prediction hardware requirements, theoretically reducing processor complexity and cost, as well as energy consumption.|$|E

50|$|Some {{microcontrollers}} use a Harvard architecture: separate memory buses {{for instructions}} and data, allowing accesses {{to take place}} concurrently. Where a Harvard architecture is used, <b>instruction</b> <b>words</b> for the processor may be a different bit size than the length of internal memory and registers; for example: 12-bit instructions used with 8-bit data registers.|$|R
