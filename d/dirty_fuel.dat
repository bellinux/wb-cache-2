However recent work done by the Nimbkar Agricultural Research Institute (NARI), a rural NGO in Maharashtra, has shown that it can be an excellent and clean fuel for cooking and lighting in rural households when used in a newly invented device called LanstoveTM (lantern plus stove). NARI’s diesel-powered lanstove simultaneously provides excellent light (equivalent to that from a 200 W electric bulb) and cooks a complete meal (including bread like chapatti and bhakari) for a family of five. Besides it can make 10 liters of water potable. Thus one device provides excellent light, clean cooking energy and drinking water. Diesel lanstove has been tested for the last two months in five unelectrified rural huts in western Maharashtra. It has shown excellent results with users commenting that it does not produce smoke or smell like their existing biomass-powered chulha and gives excellent light compared to the presently used hurricane lanterns, tin wick lamps and even solar lamps. The carbon monoxide (CO) levels (measure of how good the combustion is) from these lanstoves are less than 3 parts per million (ppm), whereas those from regular chulhas are between 250 - 400 ppm or 80 to 130 times more than that from the lanstove.

40|$|Error {{condition}} detected Although coal may {{be viewed}} as a <b>dirty</b> <b>fuel</b> due to its high greenhouse emissions when combusted, a strong case can be made for coal to be a major world source of clean H- 2 energy. Apart from the fact that resources of coal will outlast oil and natural gas by centuries, there is a shift towards developing environmentally benign coal technologies, which can lead to high energy conversion efficiencies and low air pollution emissions as compared to conventional coal fired power generation plant. There are currently several world research and industrial development projects in the areas of Integrated Gasification Combined Cycles (IGCC) and Integrated Gasification Fuel Cell (IGFC) systems. In such systems, {{there is a need to}} integrate complex unit operations including gasifiers, gas separation and cleaning units, water gas shift reactors, turbines, heat exchangers, steam generators and fuel cells. IGFC systems tested in the USA, Europe and Japan employing gasifiers (Texaco, Lurgi and Eagle) and fuel cells have resulted in energy conversions at efficiency of 47. 5 % (HHV) which is much higher than the 30 - 35 % efficiency of conventional coal fired power generation. Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) and molten carbonate fuel cells (MCFC) are the front runners in energy production from coal gases. These fuel cells can operate at high temperatures and are robust to gas poisoning impurities. IGCC and IGFC technologies are expensive and currently economically uncompetitive as compared to established and mature power generation technology. However, further efficiency and technology improvements coupled with world pressures on limitation of greenhouse gases and other gaseous pollutants could make IGCC/IGFC technically and economically viable for hydrogen production and utilisation in clean and environmentally benign energy systems.

Given the tremendous health impact of air pollution exposure {{the focus of this}} thesis is on primary prevention, that is the identification of outdoor air pollution and the use of dirty fuels (wood, animal dung, crop residues, coal, paraffin) for cooking and heating as risk factors, whilst controlling for confounding. Hourly averaged outdoor PM 10 mass, NO 2, NO, SO 2, O 3 data (1 August 1998 - 31 July 2003) from Cape Town were analysed in a nonparametric Spearman’s Rho correlation analysis to determine the seasonal spatial correlation between the monitoring sites. Trend and descriptive analyses were conducted on the outdoor hourly and daily PM 10 mass data to investigate the current and future health implications in the Khayelitsha sub-district, Cape Town. The 1998 South African Demographic and Health Survey (SADHS) data were analysed. The survey involved 13 826 individuals in 12763 households. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses generated crude and adjusted odds ratios and 95 % confidence intervals in order to assess the influence of <b>dirty</b> <b>fuel</b> use for cooking and heating on adult (> 15 years) respiratory health, childhood (< 59 months) respiratory health and 1 - 59 month mortality. It was found that outdoor air pollution is not homogenously distributed in Cape Town during all seasons. Elevated PM 10 mass concentrations are frequently present in the Khayelitsha sub-district. There is a strong case for acknowledging the large public health risk arising from air pollution exposure in South Africa, despite the limitations of the 1998 SADHS data. Not much {{progress has been made in}} air pollution epidemiology in the country during this investigation due to the identified limitations. Secondary exposure and health data are thus only useful in improving public health in South Africa by supplying baseline data for trend analysis or hypotheses generation.

40|$|Background: There is {{evidence}} that household air pollution is associated with poor health in China, and that this form of air pollution may even {{be more of a}} health concern in China than the much-publicized outdoor air pollution. However, there is little empirical evidence on the relationship between household air pollution and health in China based on nationally representative and longitudinal data. This study examines the association between the type of domestic cooking fuel and the health of women aged ≥ 16 in rural China. Methods: Using longitudinal and biomarker data from the China Family Panel Studies (n = 12, 901) and the China Health and Nutrition Survey (n = 15, 539), we investigate the impact of three major domestic cooking fuels (wood/straw, coal, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG)) on health status using both cross-sectional and panel approaches.

40|$|Sound {{public policy}} {{addresses}} externalities directly, when possible. Air pollution is best alleviated by policy instruments that internalize the social cost of pollution, making it attractive to reduce emissions. One such instrument {{might be a}} tax levied on individual emissions, if they are measurable {{and if there is}} an accepted relationship between emissions and the damages to society. But such first-best solutions may not be feasible for many reasons, among them the cost of implementation. When first-best instruments are unavailable, indirect instruments, such as presumptive taxing of polluting inputs, may be a powerful alternative. Energy pricing is, for air pollution, one such indirect instrument. Energy pricing policies affect emissions through fuel substitution and energy conservation. The authors provide an empirical framework for measuring the magnitude of this impact and apply it to two cases: manufacturing in Chile and Indonesia. They find that: 1) the responsiveness of emissions makes energy prices a powerful indirect tool for reducing emissions; 2) there is room for substitution toward cleaner input combinations - both toward cleaner fuels and away from energy, toward labor, capital, and materials; 3) substitution toward cleaner fuels can also be induced without increasing energy prices generally, by increasing the price of the <b>dirtier</b> <b>fuels,</b> thereby reducing the relative price of the cleaner ones. But noncompensated price increases for the <b>dirtier</b> <b>fuels,</b> plus increases for all fuels, will be more powerful since they will also induce firms to reduce their overall energy use. In exploiting interfuel substitution, it is important to assess the relative damage caused by different pollutants. In Indonesia, increases in coal prices could deliver reductions in particulate emissions, but in Chile they would not, because of a small own-price elasticity, a heavily-used source of energy that also produces particulate emissions. Higher prices for pollution-laden fuels will generally reduce demand, as expected, but the net effect on emissions will depend on: a) whether other fuels laden with the same pollutants are spared such price increases; b) whether their cross-price elasticities are positive; and c) which fuel shares are high.

To understand whether this eco-efficiency is due to a rational utilization of inputs or to a real carbon dioxide reduction as a consequence of environmental regulation, we analyze the cases where CO 2 emissions can either be considered as an input or as an undesirable output. Empirical results show that countries where cement industries invest in technologically advanced kilns and adopt alternative fuels and raw materials in their production processes are eco-efficient.
