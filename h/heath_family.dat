500|$|Epacris impressa, {{also known}} as common heath, is a plant of the <b>heath</b> <b>family,</b> Ericaceae, that is native to {{southeast}} Australia (the states of Victoria, Tasmania, South Australia and New South Wales). French botanist Jacques Labillardière collected the species in 1793 and described it in 1805. Four forms have been identified, but no subspecies are recognised. Growing in heathland, shrubland or open forest, it is generally a small shrub around [...] tall, with small stiff leaves. The red, pink or white tube-like flowers appear from late autumn to early spring. Honeyeaters, particularly the eastern spinebill, feed upon the nectar of the flowers.

500|$|Mycena aurantiomarginata is a {{saprobic}} fungus, deriving {{nutrients from}} decomposing organic matter {{found on the}} forest floor, such as needle carpets.

5000|$|... ==Flora and fauna== The plant {{communities}} of the reserve are highly dependent on proximity to the sea, and altitude zonation. The richest floral families are the grasses and members of Asteraceae, plus species of the Ranunculaceae, Rosaceae, Cabbage, and <b>Heath</b> <b>families.</b> Otherwise, the area is relatively species-poor due to isolation since the pre-glacial time. Scientists on the reserve have recorded 312 species of vascular plants. The forested areas feature stunted trees, with willow, alder and poplar common on the floodplains. The slopes of the Koryak Highlands on the Gauvin peninsula support cedar forests. [...] Scientists on the reserve have recorded 44 species of mammals: 24 permanent residents, 5 migrants, and 15 marine mammals. The rivers the reserve are important spawning grounds for salmon, chum, brown trout, brook trout, and the Kamchatka grayling. Because of its large, marshy character, the Parapolsky site {{is home to a}} wide variety of water and wading birds - ducks, geese, cormorants, and gulls. During the spring and autumn migration, hundreds of thousands of birds nest or rest on the site. The Koryak Highlands are one of the largest sites for bighorn sheep in northeast Asia. The Cape Gauvin and Lavosky sites, with coastal rocks and ledges, are home to over 30 large colonies of seabirds. [...] Species include the Steller's sea eagle, Aleutian tern, and the Spoon-billed sandpiper.|$|R

50|$|Hanworth was the <b>Heath</b> <b>family's</b> {{home for}} nearly 25 years. They moved amongst Brisbane's highest society, and entertained frequently; at the {{reception}} held at Hanworth on the marriage of their daughter Cecelia Georgina in 1886, guests included the Governor and Lady Musgrave, the Premier and Mrs Samuel Griffith, Treasurer James Robert Dickson, Mr Justice and Mrs Harding, several high-ranking government officials and officers of visiting ships. On 30 June 1890, Commander Heath retired from the position of Portmaster of Queensland. Although the family returned to England soon afterwards, Hanworth remained in Heath's (and later his daughters') possession, and by 1891 was leased by Brisbane bank manager, (later stock and share broker), Alexander Henry Hudson and his family. The Hudsons resided at Hanworth for about 22 years, and were still in occupation when the property was advertised for sale in October 1909. At this time the house {{was described as a}} Substantial Brick Structure, containing 8 rooms and all offices, with 7 acres of land, having long frontage to the main Lytton road and Norman Creek. (Brisbane Courier 2/10/1909:9:1) The property did not sell, however, and in early 1912, after the Hudsons had moved to Kangaroo Point, was put up for auction as the Hanworth Estate, subdivided into 57 residential allotments. A number of the vacant allotments sold at this time, but the house remained unoccupied until acquired by Mrs Mary Marguerite Wienholt, who obtained title in July 1913. The grounds had been reduced to just over 3 roods, and did not include the former tennis court.|$|R
