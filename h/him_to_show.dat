5|$|After {{the story}} is printed, the {{neighborhood}} learns of Mac's past, and members of a local country–western band visit <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> their respect. Although he greets them politely, Mac remains reluctant to open up about his past. Later, he secretly attends Dixie's concert. She passionately sings several songs that Mac wrote years earlier, and he leaves {{in the middle of}} the performance. Backstage, he talks to Dixie's manager, his old friend Harry (Wilford Brimley). Mac gives him a copy of a new song he has written and asks <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> it to Dixie. Mac tries to talk to Dixie, but she becomes angry upon seeing him and warns him to stay away from their 18-year-old daughter, Sue Anne (Ellen Barkin).|$|E
5|$|In the film, Aksel Winther, who {{is based}} on Vilhelm Leifer, {{is the one who}} gives Flammen and Citron orders to kill. Birkelund pointed out that he had already moved to Sweden by the time of their assassinations, while Madsen stated he was sure Leifer gave orders before leaving the country. Also, they met Frode Jacobsen in a meeting in Sweden, and he is said to have given orders from there. Birkelund {{rejected}} the idea of Jacobsen giving orders, but Madsen said the meetings were created by <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> that the resistance movements of that time had approaches different from those of their present-day counterparts.|$|E
5|$|Dollo's {{specimens}} allowed <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> that Owen's prehistoric pachyderms {{were not}} correct for Iguanodon. He instead modelled the skeletal mounts after the cassowary and wallaby, {{and put the}} spike {{that had been on}} the nose firmly on the thumb. He was not completely correct, but he also had the disadvantage of being faced with some of the first complete dinosaur remains. A problem that was later recognised was the bend he introduced into the tail. This organ was more or less straight, as shown by the skeletons he was excavating, and the presence of ossified tendons. In fact, to get the bend in the tail for a more wallaby or kangaroo-like posture, the tail would have had to be broken. With its correct, straight tail and back, the animal would have walked with its body held horizontal to the ground, arms in place to support the body if needed.|$|E

25|$|In June 2008, Chin again {{lost his}} bid to return to Malaysia when the Court of Appeal upheld an earlier ruling that {{compelled}} <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> identification papers to prove his citizenship. Chin maintained that his birth certificate was seized by the police during a raid in 1948. His counsel Raja Aziz Addruse had submitted before the Court of Appeal {{that it was wrong}} for the Malaysian government to compel him to produce the documents, because he was entitled to enter and live in Malaysia by virtue of the peace agreement.|$|E
25|$|Alvertis was {{regarded}} {{for a long}} time {{as one of the best}} perimeter shooters in Europe. His shooting style, combined with his height, made him very hard to defend. His lack of athleticism did not allow <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> great regularity; nevertheless, he was never afraid to take clutch shots, and he was very often successful. He was also an above-average defender. He sometimes played at the power forward position in Panathinaikos, over the last 5years of his career, due to his height and size, although his all-around skills were quite average.|$|E
25|$|The album {{featured}} virtuoso guitarist and newcomer John McLaughlin, who had {{one month}} {{prior to the}} February 18 In a Silent Way session recorded his classic debut album Extrapolation. At the request of Tony Williams, McLaughlin moved in early February from England to the US {{to play with the}} Tony Williams Lifetime. Williams brought McLaughlin to Davis' house the night before the scheduled session for In a Silent Way. Davis had not heard the guitarist before, but was so impressed that he told <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> up at the studio the next day. McLaughlin would go on to great fame in the 1970s as leader of the Mahavishnu Orchestra.|$|E

25|$|The {{relationship}} of Gregory VII to other European states was {{strongly influenced by}} his German policy, since the Holy Roman Empire, by taking up most of his energies, often forced <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> to other rulers the very moderation which he withheld from the German king. The attitude of the Normans brought him a rude awakening. The great concessions made to them under Nicholas II were not only powerless to stem their advance into central Italy, but failed to secure even the expected protection for the papacy. When Gregory VII was hard pressed by Henry IV, Robert Guiscard left him to his fate, and only intervened when he himself was threatened with German arms. Then, on the capture of Rome, he abandoned the city to his troops, and the popular indignation evoked by his act brought about Gregory's exile.|$|E
25|$|A fact {{important}} to the later development of the steam locomotive by others was that, in 1797 and 1798, Richard Trevithick came to live in Redruth {{next door to the}} house where William Murdoch lived (1782 to 1798). Trevithick would have seen and been influenced by Murdoch's experiments, and would certainly have been aware of his work in this area. There is also a story told by Murdoch's son John of a visit by Trevithick and Andrew Vivian to see a model engine in 1794: The model of the wheel carriage engine was made in the summer of 1792 and was then shown to many of the inhabitants of Redruth – about two years after Trevithick and A. Vivian called at my father's house in Redruth... My father mentions that... on that day they asked <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> his model of the wheel carriage engine which worked with strong steam and no vacuum. This was immediately shown to them in a working state.|$|E
25|$|In the lair, Christine {{is forced}} to don a wedding dress. Raoul finds the lair and {{attempts}} to persuade the Phantom to spare Christine, begging <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> compassion. The Phantom refuses, and captures Raoul with the Punjab lasso. The Phantom tells Christine that he will free Raoul if she agrees {{to stay with him}} forever, but if she refuses, Raoul will die. Christine, heartbroken, tells the Phantom that it is his soul that is deformed, not his face. As the Phantom and Raoul both plead to her, Christine mournfully wonders what kind of life the Phantom has known. She tells the Phantom that he is not alone and kisses him, showing him compassion {{for the first time in}} his life. The Phantom, having experienced kindness at last, understands that he cannot compel Christine to love him, and sets them both free. Raoul hurries Christine out of the lair, but she returns alone to give the Phantom back his ring. The Phantom tells Christine he loves her, before she tearfully exits with Raoul. The weeping Phantom huddles on his throne and covers himself with his cloak. The mob, led by Meg, enters the lair. Meg pulls the Phantom's cloak from the throne, finding only his mask on the seat. She lifts the mask up into the light and gazes at in wonder as the curtain falls.|$|E

He started staring at this girl and she fell into hypnosis, without me doing a thing". Lennon maintains that a number of dogs and other carnivores have a natural ability to hypnotise prey.|$|R
5|$|On August 11, 1952, Williams was {{dismissed}} from the Grand Ole Opry for habitual drunkenness and missing <b>shows.</b> He returned <b>to</b> Shreveport, Louisiana {{to perform in}} KWKH and WBAM shows and in the Louisiana Hayride, for which he toured again. His performances were acclaimed when he was sober, but {{despite the efforts of}} his work associates <b>to</b> get <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>shows</b> sober, his abuse of alcohol resulted in occasions when he did not appear or his performances were poor. In October 1952 he married Billie Jean Jones.|$|R

A rookie detective on his first homicide case, Bayliss has difficulty informing the family, while the veteran Pembleton (Andre Braugher) remains detached from his emotional response. Much of the homicide department {{is dedicated to the}} case, and Bayliss works without [...] the benefit of his own desk. When Bayliss acts weak and indecisive during a department meeting, Gee (Yaphet Kotto) angrily orders <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> more confidence. But when a news report by journalist Griselda Battel (Taylor Young) discusses Bayliss' lack of prior experience, Gee resists pressure from his superiors to replace Bayliss, insisting, [...] "That rookie will surprise us all".|$|E
500|$|In a 2005 {{lecture at}} Harvard after Jackson's trial, Jackson's {{attorney}} Thomas Mesereau said the following about Jordan Chandler: [...] "The prosecutors {{tried to get}} <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> up and he wouldn't. If he had, I had witnesses {{who were going to}} come in and say he told them it never happened and that he would never talk to his parents again for what they made him say. It turned out he'd gone into court and got legal emancipation from his parents." [...] In 2006, Jordan accused Evan of attacking him with a barbell, choking him and spraying his face with Mace. The charges were later dropped. On November 5, 2009, fourteen weeks after Jackson's death, Evan Chandler was found dead following an apparent suicide.|$|E
500|$|Following {{a journey}} to the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin, van Meegeren painted The Supper at Emmaus using the {{ultramarine}} blues and yellows preferred by Johannes Vermeer and other Dutch Golden Age painters. The experts assumed that Vermeer had studied in Italy, so van Meegeren used [...] by Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio located at Italy’s Pinacoteca di Brera as a model. He {{had always wanted to}} walk in the steps of the masters, and he felt that his forgery was a fine work in its own right. He gave it to his friend, attorney C. A. Boon, telling him that it was a genuine Vermeer, and asked <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> it to Dr. Abraham Bredius in Monaco. Bredius examined the forgery in September 1937 and he accepted it as a genuine Vermeer and praised it highly.|$|E

500|$|In Hartford, Cullen {{worked to}} {{overcome}} the team's fans' disappointment at losing Francis. [...] The Hartford fans initially booed <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> their dissatisfaction with the trade. [...] He scored 16 points in 13 regular season games to finish the season with 110 points combined between the Penguins and Whalers, and was the team's best player in their first round loss to the Boston Bruins in the 1991 Stanley Cup Playoffs. [...] He initially accepted an invitation to join the Canadian team at the 1991 Canada Cup, but subsequently chose not to participate as his contract had expired, leading to greater insurance concerns. Still without a contract when the 1991–92 season began, Cullen missed the first four games before signing a four-year deal with Hartford worth a total of $4 million. [...] He returned to score 77 points in 77 games in his first full season with the Whalers and represented the team at the 1992 All-Star Game.|$|E
500|$|Even {{before the}} senatorial {{election}}, the rival factions in the Ohio Republican Party were battling less than usual, {{but it was}} not until the day of the senatorial election that McKinley and Foraker reached a definite understanding for peace during the 1896 campaign. [...] Foraker agreed to support McKinley's presidential bid, and to travel to New York to approach that state's Republican political boss, Senator Thomas C. Platt, hoping to gain Platt's support for McKinley. [...] In March, Foraker addressed the state convention in support of McKinley in a widely publicized speech. However, he was reluctant to be a delegate to the national convention, fearing that he would be blamed if anything went wrong with McKinley's candidacy. It was only after considerable prodding from the presidential candidate that Foraker agreed to be a delegate, and to place McKinley's name in nomination. [...] McKinley desired that Foraker nominate <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> that he had the united support of the state Republican Party. [...] Senator-elect Foraker eventually agreed, and gave the nominating speech, part of which was heard by McKinley via telephone line to Canton.|$|E

Some sources have accused al-Ash'ath of being informed of the plot of the assassination of Ali. According to al-Yaqubi, Ibn Muljam was hosted by al-Ash'ath for a month when Ibn Muljam had been preparing his sword. Another report by Ibn Sa'd says that al-Ash'ath stayed the night of the killing at mosque counseling Ibn Muljam and that al-Ash'ath signaled the time of attempting the assassination by saying [...] "the morning has smiled." [...] The majority of the sources narrates an ambiguous phrase from Al-Ash'ath:"the dawn has risen for thee" [...] and those who has Shia tendency give it as a clear encouragement to Ibn Muljam: [...] "Deliverance, deliverance! The dawn has risen for thee." [...] After assassination, Hujr ibn 'Adi accused him for Ali's murder. There is even a report which says he warned Ali about Ibn Muljam. According to Laura Veccia Vaglieri, the sources narrate different reports which vary from outright accusation to a suspicion of complicity and even to an act of loyalty.|$|E
500|$|Paramount faced two {{obstacles}} {{in promoting the}} film: the unfamiliarity of the [...] "MySpace generation" [...] with the franchise and the relatively weak international performance of the previous films. Six months before the film's release, Abrams toured Europe and North America with 25 minutes of footage. Abrams noted the large-scale campaign started unusually early, but this was because the release delay allowed <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> more completed scenes than normal. The director preferred promoting his projects quietly, but concurred Paramount needed to remove Star Treks stigma. Abrams would exaggerate his preference for other shows to Star Trek as a child to the press, with statements like [...] "I'm not a Star Trek fan" [...] and [...] "this movie is not made for Star Trek fans necessarily". Orci compared Abrams' approach to The Next Generation episode [...] "A Matter of Honor", where William Riker is stationed aboard a Klingon vessel. [...] "On that ship when someone talks back to you, {{you would have to}} beat them down or you lose the respect of your crew, which is protocol, whereas on a Federation ship that would be a crime.
