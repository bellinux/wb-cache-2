40|$|Today’s {{software}} development {{has become a}} very complex task {{and no one has}} the required skills or time to resolve a sophisticated problem on his own. Software development phases need the implication of lots of people having to use concepts and ideas for which they share a common understanding. Into such a context, several {{software development}} methodologies appeared in the last thirty years. Those methodologies use different development life cycles, {{one of the most famous}} being the iterative one used in the Unified Process (UP). To learn project managers and computer science students to deal with such development processes few methods exist. Indeed, one can learn from <b>ex</b> <b>cathedra</b> <b>courses,</b> books or directly into “real life ” projects but no software project simulation games exists. That is why we are developing an online multi-user game simulating the job of a project manager facing user requirements, development planning, human resources allocation, budget constraints, risk and quality management onto a UP/UML software project case study...|$|R
40|$|Teaching in {{the early}} bachelor’s degrees at the {{university}} often comes down to classical <b>ex</b> <b>cathedra</b> <b>courses</b> for which the students take a passive role leading progressively to the lost of their motivation which may result in school failure. In this work, we demonstrate {{that the use of}} a collaborative social bookmarking, such as Diigo, can help for preserving and promoting the student motivation within large classes. Diigo is a free online tool used in a bachelor class of Bio Engineering (270 students) at the Gembloux Agro Bio Tech Faculty (University of Liege, Belgium) in order to allow students to work actively in small groups of 6 students. During this activity, which is supervised by a tutor who is also a teacher, the students prepare themselves the subject of the course. The impacts of this learning activity are clear: the motivation is substantially increased and the teacher can assist each group in its research through the Network rather than merely transmit his knowledge to a large audience without close interactions with the students. bookmarking, such as Diigo, can help for preserving and promoting the student motivation within large classes.

5000|$|According to the {{teaching}} of the First Vatican Council and Catholic tradition, the conditions required for <b>ex</b> <b>cathedra</b> papal teaching are as follows: ...|$|R
50|$|The {{doctrine}} of infallibility relies {{on one of}} the cornerstones of Catholic dogma: that of Petrine supremacy of the pope, and his authority as the ruling agent who decides what is accepted as formal beliefs in the Roman Catholic Church. The use of this power is referred to as speaking <b>ex</b> <b>cathedra.</b> The solemn declaration of papal infallibility by Vatican I took place on 18 July 1870. Since that time, the only example of an <b>ex</b> <b>cathedra</b> decree took place in 1950, when Pope Pius XII defined the Assumption of Mary as an article of faith. Prior to the solemn definition of 1870, there were other decrees which fit the definition of <b>ex</b> <b>cathedra,</b> for example, Pope Boniface VIII in the bull Unam Sanctam of 1302, and Pope Pius IX in the Papal constitution Ineffabilis Deus of 1854.|$|R
25|$|Jeffrey Skidmore OBE (born 27 February 1951) is the {{conductor}} and {{artistic director of}} <b>Ex</b> <b>Cathedra,</b> a choir and early music ensemble based in Birmingham in the West Midlands, England. An active participant in musical education and a pioneer in researching and performing neglected choral works of the 16th to 18th centuries, he has worked with leading musicologists to prepare new performing editions of French and Italian music. In particular, his recordings of French and Latin American Baroque music with <b>Ex</b> <b>Cathedra</b> have won wide acclaim.|$|R
50|$|The {{doctrine}} of papal infallibility states {{that when the}} pope teaches <b>ex</b> <b>cathedra</b> his teachings are infallible and irreformable. Such infallible papal decrees must {{be made by the}} pope, in his role as leader of the whole Church, and they must be definitive decisions on matters of faith and morals which are binding on the whole Church. An infallible decree by a pope {{is often referred to as}} an <b>ex</b> <b>cathedra</b> statement. This type of infallibility falls under the authority of the sacred magisterium.|$|R

5000|$|The term <b>ex</b> <b>cathedra,</b> meaning [...] "from the chair", {{is used to}} {{designate}} official pronouncements of the pope intended for a world audience.
