Fermi guessed that this was due to the hydrogen atoms in the paraffin. Those in wood similarly explained the difference between the wooden and the marble table tops. This was confirmed by repeating the effect with water. He concluded that collisions with hydrogen atoms slowed the neutrons. The lower the atomic number of the nucleus it collides with, the more energy a neutron loses per collision, and therefore the less collisions that are required to slow a neutron down by a given amount. Fermi realised that this induced more radioactivity because slow neutrons were more easily captured than fast ones.

30|$|According to <b>Fermi’s</b> <b>age</b> {{equation}} [18] and Ge QDs’ sizes from AFM, {{we estimate}} the capture probability for electrons of Ge QDs in different samples. The probability in sample C is about 1.6 and 1.2 {{times higher than}} that of sample A and B, respectively. Further, the nonradiative recombination channels related to point defects that form at low growth temperature can decrease the PL intensity [11, 19]. The growth process of Ge QDs in which Si spacers were grown at higher temperature are similar to cyclic annealing. It may decrease the point defects and improve the crystal quality [20].|$|R

Arnold Sommerfeld would create the contour integral sign in 1917. Also in 1917, Dimitry Mirimanoff proposes axiom of regularity. In 1919, Theodor Kaluza would solve general relativity equations using five dimensions, the results would have electromagnetic equations emerge. This would be published in 1921 in [...] "Zum Unitätsproblem der Physik". In 1922, Abraham Fraenkel and Thoralf Skolem independently proposed replacing the axiom schema of specification with the axiom schema of replacement. Also in 1922, Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory was developed. In 1923, Steinmetz would publish Four Lectures on Relativity and Space. Around 1924, Jan Arnoldus Schouten would develop the modern notation and formalism for the Ricci calculus framework during the absolute differential calculus applications to general relativity and differential geometry {{in the early twentieth}} century. In 1925, Enrico Fermi would describe a system comprising many identical particles that obey the Pauli exclusion principle, afterwards developing a diffusion equation (<b>Fermi</b> <b>age</b> equation). In 1926, Oskar Klein would develop the Kaluza-Klein theory. In 1928, Emil Artin abstracted ring theory with Artinian rings. In 1933, Andrey Kolmogorov introduces the Kolmogorov axioms. In 1937, Bruno de Finetti deduced the [...] "operational subjective" [...] concept.|$|E
40|$|For a {{measurement}} of the diffusion constant D from the decay of the fundamental mode only, optimal dimensions of the pile are given, leading to a fast decay of the higher modes. Another method is discussed which makes use also of higher modes. Evaluation formulas and optimal pile dimensions for this method are derived. The amplitudes of the normal modes are calculated for different initial distributions of the neutrons {{by means of the}} <b>Fermi</b> <b>age</b> theory. The error introduced using <b>Fermi</b> <b>age</b> theory was fixed moderator atoms for the slowing down process down to thermal energy is estimated. In one instance, for a simple initial distribution of thermal neutrons, the neutron density was calculated as a function of space and time.

40|$|This report {{deals with}} {{relative}} and absolute {{measurements of the}} thermal and epithermal neutron flux in a cylindrical pile of paraffin in which is placed a 0, 5 C Ra-Be -source. The measurements were performed applying the well-known techniques by means of 0, 020 mm thick circular Au disk foils of 1 cm^ 2 area. The results (for Cd ratios, the removal cross section, the experimental <b>FERMI</b> <b>age,</b> the spatial flux integral, etc.) have been compared and found in accordance with results found by other authors. The neutron source strength has been obtained as 7, 60 · (1 ± 0, 02 _ 5) · 10 ^ 6 neutrons/sec which differs not inadmissible from the calibration value 7, 81 · (1 ± 0, 03) · 10 ^ 6 neutrons/sec of our source by the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt in Braunschweig (Germany) ...|$|E
