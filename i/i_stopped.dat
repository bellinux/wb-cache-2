25|$|World War <b>I</b> <b>stopped</b> {{activity}} on the site; it began again in 1916 {{with the arrival of}} refugee workers, Belgians and Italians. At the end of the war, Serbian workers came to the ferrier. At the end of the World War II heavy equipment such as excavators and other large machines arrived. Using these considerably modified the ferrier in many ways, notably by greatly upsetting the order of archaeological strata in many places and thus locally preventing near-any historical tracing.|$|E
25|$|World War <b>I</b> <b>stopped</b> everything. All {{priests and}} the entire staff of the Mission were {{expelled}} from Palestine as enemy aliens and all the churches were closed. Turkish soldiers occupied the Russian Compound. With the rise of communist rule in the Soviet Union, the stream of Russian pilgrims to Jerusalem ceased almost entirely. The October Revolution had {{a major impact on}} everyday life in Jerusalem. It halted not only the flow of pilgrims, but also the money to maintain the Compound. Most of the buildings were rented to the British authorities.|$|E
25|$|The mayor {{released}} Benga to {{the custody}} of Reverend James M. Gordon, who supervised the Howard Colored Orphan Asylum in Brooklyn and made him a ward. That same year Gordon arranged for Benga {{to be cared for}} in Virginia, where he paid for him to acquire American clothes and to have his teeth capped, so the young man could be more readily accepted in local society. Benga was tutored in English and began to work. Several years later, the outbreak of World War <b>I</b> <b>stopped</b> ship passenger travel and prevented his returning to Africa. This, as well as the poor treatment he was subjected to for most of his life, caused Benga to fall into a depression. He committed suicide in 1916 at the age of 32.|$|E

500|$|Stossel has won 19 Emmy Awards. He {{was honored}} five times for {{excellence}} in consumer reporting by the National Press Club, has received a George Polk Award for Outstanding Local Reporting and a Peabody Award. According to Stossel, {{when he was in}} favor of government intervention and skeptical of business, he was deluged with awards, but in 2006 he stated, [...] "They like me less... Once I started applying the same skepticism to government, <b>I</b> <b>stopped</b> winning awards." [...] On April 23, 2012, Stossel was awarded the Chapman University Presidential Medal, by the current president, James Doti, and chancellor, Danielle Struppa.

500|$|... "I {{think the}} movie is about mothers and sons," [...] Spacey said, {{referring}} to Darin's relationship with his mother Polly and sister Nina. Spacey's mother, Kathleen Fowler, died of brain cancer just before production started. [...] "I made the movie for all mothers, but especially for my mother. She introduced me to Bobby Darin. When she got very ill in 2002, <b>I</b> <b>stopped</b> everything {{and took care of}} her. We constantly played Bobby Darin records, and I'd let her listen to the tracks I was recording. I'm glad she passed knowing this was the movie I was going to make." [...] After his award-winning performances in The Usual Suspects and American Beauty, Spacey [...] "chose to move away from dark, sarcastic characters, and instead play damaged but good-hearted men" [...] in films like Pay It Forward, K-PAX and The Shipping News. The actor was criticized for his career move; Spacey acknowledged the similarities when Darin integrated into folk music and protest songs.|$|E

The song served as an inspiration for one of the first punk fanzines, Mark Perry's Sniffin' Glue. [...] "I Don't Wanna Go Down to the Basement" [...] is also a minimalist piece, and was inspired by horror movies. The entire text is composed of three lines, and the composition was based on three major chords. With a playing time of 2:35, it is the longest piece on the album.|$|E

500|$|By the mid- to {{late 1990s}} Mehldau was {{regarded}} {{by some as}} one of the leading jazz musicians: critic John Fordham described him as [...] "the next great keyboard star of jazz". The appreciation was not universal: some of the pianist's self-penned liner notes and interview comments, which included philosophical musings and complaints about comparisons with pianist Bill Evans, engendered dislike in some, thereby, in critic Nate Chinen's words, [...] "leaving Mehldau with a lingering reputation for pretentiousness and self-indulgence." [...] Many critics did, though, reassess their judgment of his main influences, which previously had often been given as Evans, an assessment that was perhaps attributable more to race than to music. Another, non-musical, similarity with Evans that was commented on was Mehldau's struggle with an addiction to heroin during the 1990s, up to 1998. Around 1996 he moved to Los Angeles, to try to overcome this drug problem. Mehldau later stated that [...] "Once <b>I</b> <b>stopped</b> using heroin, it was like a rush of creativity that had been held in check came out".|$|E
500|$|Prior to the album's release, Manson made {{a series}} of disparaging {{comments}} regarding Interscope and its artistic censorship; as well as its then-CEO Jimmy Iovine, who Manson said [...] "wasn't smart enough to understand what [...] do." [...] He also accused the label of caring more about Vitamin Water [...] than music. Several days after the album's release, Trent Reznor – who, as of 2015, remains friends and business partners with Iovine – called Manson a [...] "dopey clown", and said that [...] "He is a malicious guy and will step on anybodies face to succeed and cross any line of decency." [...] Manson responded by accusing Reznor of professional jealousy, saying: [...] "Since I've known Trent, he's always let his jealousy and bitterness for other people get in the way. I'm not talking about me—I sat back and watched him be jealous of Kurt Cobain and Billy Corgan {{and a lot of other}} musicians in the past. I just don't find time to do that. <b>I</b> <b>stopped</b> thinking about him a while back." ...|$|E
500|$|Since airing, [...] "The Falcon and the D'ohman" [...] has {{received}} mixed reviews from critics. The {{plot of the}} episode has been criticized by some reviewers. Kyle Lemmon of Under the Radar gave the episode a three out of ten rating, concluding that [...] "this new episode is rarely grounded {{in any kind of}} reality. The best examples of The Simpsons center the situational humor in somewhat plausible scenarios within the town. I guess after so many years, they've completely run out of ideas." [...] Similarly, Television Blend's Jesse Carp wrote that the plot shows [...] "essentially what is wrong with the show and why <b>I</b> <b>stopped</b> watching. Because of the endless amount of material needed to keep a series running for twenty three years, they have to resort to outlandish plots and endless cameos to stay interesting. The best episodes,... definitely have some absurd elements but they're all firmly grounded in a fairly real world of Springfield, USA and its colorful cast of characters. I'd like to see more of that. I miss them." ...|$|E
