25|$|A report dated 13 June 2008 by the 'Marine Corps Center for Lessons Learned' {{indicated}} {{concerns about}} MRAP vehicles rolling over in combat zones. The V-shaped hulls of the MRAP {{give it a}} higher center of gravity {{and the weight of}} the MRAP can cause the poorly built or maintained roads in rural <b>Iraq</b> <b>or</b> Afghanistan to collapse. Of the 66 MRAP accidents between 7 November 2007 and 8 June 2008, almost 40 were due to rollovers caused by bad roads, weak bridges, or driver error. In many of the rollovers, troops were injured, and in two separate incidents five soldiers have been killed by rolling over into a canal and getting trapped under water. The report said 75% of all rollovers occurred in rural areas often where roads are above grade with an adjacent ditch or canal. The report raised concerns associated with MRAP vehicles snagging on low-hanging power lines in <b>Iraq</b> <b>or</b> its antennas getting close enough to create an electric arc, which may lead to the electrocution of the passengers. The person located in the gunner's hatch is at the highest risk.|$|E
