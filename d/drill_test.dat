Unlike the regular armed forces, where it is possible to enter as either directly as a commissioned following completion of some form of officer training (service academy, college ROTC, or OCS/OTS, etc.), or enlist and eventually advance to non-commissioned officer or petty officer status, a CAP cadet must be promoted through every CAP cadet enlisted grade in order to achieve the rank of CAP cadet second lieutenant. To complete an achievement, a cadet must pass a physical fitness test as well as two written tests, one for leadership and one for aerospace education. The only exceptions to this rule are the promotions to cadet airman and cadet staff sergeant, which have no aerospace test. For some achievements, an additional test of drill proficiency is required.

Events of petroleum extraction in the nearby areas (such as Black oil in the Devil's Basin) strengthened their resolve to proceed further with drilling operations {{in the area of}} the anticline, now known as Mosby Dome. On 18 February 1920 at the southeast corner of the county, the first <b>drill</b> <b>test</b> at Cat Creek was carried out. The discovery well was drilled by the Frantz Oil Corp but the success of oil find was limited in this first effort. In the second effort undertaken at West Dome, initial yield was 350 barrels daily up to August 1920. Then the drill hole was cleaned up which resulted in increased oil production of 2000 barrels per day. Encouraged by this success 300 more drill holes were done in the next 6 years.|$|E

40|$|Sandvik Mining and Construction Oy {{manufactures}} drill rigs, {{which are}} machines used for rock drilling. A drill rig has {{one or more}} rock drills that perform the actual drilling. The rock drills are tested in test benches, which are automatic test systems. These <b>drill</b> <b>test</b> benches are used mainly for assuring quality of manufactured rock drills. In {{the beginning of the}} thesis process, Sandvik had project plans on building new <b>drill</b> <b>test</b> benches for testing durability of new rock drill products in the product development stage. Durability testing involves long test runs where test phases are repeated several times. The new <b>drill</b> <b>test</b> benches required a new control system to be developed. The control system is an embedded system consisting of several components, some of which run the Linux operating system. Additionally, a desktop application needed to be developed for creating tests for the <b>drill</b> <b>test</b> benches. In this thesis a concept of a testing framework is created, which describes conceptually how the automatic tests for the <b>drill</b> <b>test</b> benches are defined and run. Applicability of the concept is analyzed also in a broader context for testing various kinds of systems. An implementation of the testing framework concept for <b>drill</b> <b>test</b> benches is developed, which is the main focus of this thesis. All levels of the control system are described briefly from both hardware and software perspectives. However, the thesis will not go into details of other software components beyond the testing framework since they were not implemented by the author. The project plans for building new <b>drill</b> <b>test</b> benches based on the new control system were cancelled late in the process of writing this thesis. Therefore, no feedback from production use was received. The control system can, however, be deployed later in new <b>drill</b> <b>test</b> bench projects or when an old <b>drill</b> <b>test</b> bench control system is updated. Based on current assessment, the project has achieved its goals. The new software used for creating tests has better usability than the one used in a previous <b>drill</b> <b>test</b> bench. Maintainability of the control system is also considerably better than in previous <b>drill</b> <b>test</b> benches...|$|E

40|$|Detecting and {{assessing}} hydrocarbon reservoirs {{without the need}} to <b>drill</b> <b>test</b> wells is of major importance to the petroleum industry. Seismic methods have traditionally been used in this context, but {{the results can be}} ambiguous. Another approach is to use electromagnetic sounding methods that exploit the resistivity differences between a reservoir containing highly resistive hydrocarbons and one saturated with conductive saline fluids. Modeling presented by Eidesmo et al. (2002) demonstrates that by using seabed logging (SBL), a special application of frequency domain controlled source electromagnetic (CSEM) sounding, the existence or otherwise of hydrocarbon bearing layers can be determined and their lateral extent and boundaries can be quantified.
