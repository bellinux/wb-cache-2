5000|$|Otto Niebergall {{was born}} into a working class family just outside Kusel, a small {{industrial}} town in the hills to the north-east of Saarbrücken. He trained for work as a machinist, an electrician and a miner, and these were the sectors in which he worked as a young man. [...] In 1918 he was a co-founder of the Saarbrücken Young Socialists ("Arbeiterjugend") group. He was also actively engaged in the local branch of the Metal Workers' Union ("Deutscher Metallarbeiter-Verband" [...] / DMV). [...] In 1920 he relocated to Hamborn in the Ruhr region which at this time, like the Saarland, remained under French military occupation. In Hamborn, still aged only 16, he joined the Young Communists, in which he subsequently {{became a member of the}} district leadership team ("Unterbezirksleitung"). [...] The early 1920s were years of desperate austerity and of widespread quasi-military civil unrest in many parts of Germany. Niebergall joined the [...] "Red Ruhr Army", established in the area as a response to the Freikorps units of unemployed <b>demobilised</b> <b>former</b> <b>soldiers</b> which had emerged in the aftermath of military defeat, and which continued to be active despite the failure in 1920 of the Kapp Putsch.|$|R
