5000|$|In 6/49 lottery, the {{experiment}} of <b>drawing</b> six <b>numbers</b> from the 49 generates {{events such as}} <b>drawing</b> six specific <b>numbers,</b> <b>drawing</b> five <b>numbers</b> from six specific <b>numbers,</b> <b>drawing</b> four <b>numbers</b> from six specific <b>numbers,</b> <b>drawing</b> at least one number from a certain group of numbers, etc. The sample space here is the set of all 6-size combinations of numbers from the 49.|$|R
30|$|Given {{that four}} out of 10 apps {{involved}} <b>drawing</b> <b>numbers,</b> an increase in this skill was anticipated from the pre- to the post-test. However, of the two items assessing <b>drawing</b> <b>numbers,</b> only one item (i.e., 1.7 b <b>drawing</b> the <b>number</b> 6) revealed a significant increase from M[*]=[*] 2.86 and SD[*]=[*] 1.46 to M[*]=[*] 3.29 and SD[*]=[*] 1.25, following the intervention.|$|R
50|$|The odds {{of getting}} 2 out of 6 <b>drawn</b> <b>numbers</b> plus the extra number are {{approximately}} 1 in 81.207, {{less likely than}} getting 3 out of 6 <b>drawn</b> <b>numbers.</b> However, there is no prize for only getting 2 out of 6 <b>drawn</b> <b>numbers</b> plus the extra number, which explains why Mark Six has lower overall odds. If one day this became the 8th division of the game, the overall odds of Mark Six would reduce to 1:32.208, comparable to counterparts in the United States.|$|R

50|$|Prizes {{are awarded}} to players who match {{at least three}} of the six <b>drawn</b> <b>numbers,</b> with prizes {{increasing}} for matching more of the <b>drawn</b> <b>numbers.</b> All players who match all six <b>drawn</b> <b>numbers</b> win equal shares of the jackpot; the chance of doing so is 1 in 13,983,816. If four, five, or six balls are matched, the relevant prize is divided equally between all who match that many balls. If no player matches all six numbers, the jackpot is added to that of the next Lotto draw—a Rollover.|$|R

50|$|Another {{widespread}} {{tradition is}} using the <b>drawing</b> <b>number</b> as the root (or stem) of the part number; in this tradition, the various dash-number parts usually appear as views on the self-same drawing. For example, <b>drawing</b> <b>number</b> 12345 may show an assembly, P/N 12345-1, which comprises detail parts -2 ("dash two"), -3, -4, -8, and -11. Even drawings {{for which there is}} currently only one part definition existing will often designate that part with a part number comprising <b>drawing</b> <b>number</b> plus -1 ("dash one"). This is to provide extensibility of the part numbering system, in anticipation of a day when it might be desired to add another part definition to the family, which can then become -2 ("dash two"), followed by -3 ("dash three"), and so on.|$|E

5000|$|In 1944-45 the Germans {{changed their}} system of {{artillery}} designations {{from the old}} [...] "year" [...] system.

The shells were all to be designated as M with a 4-digit number, the first three were the <b>drawing</b> <b>number</b> and the last was the shell's category from the following list: ...|$|E
