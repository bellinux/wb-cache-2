40|$|Diverse p 44 alleles at the p 44 {{expression}} locus (p 44 Es) encoding surface-exposed major membrane proteins, P 44 s, of Anaplasma phagocytophilum were {{hypothesized to}} be garnered by recombination to enact antigenic variation. However, this hypothesis {{has not been}} proven so far, due to inability to clone this obligate intragranulocytic rickettsia. To define the p 44 E recombination, we developed a novel method to clone A. phagocytophilum. This isogenic cloned population containing a defined p 44 E was used to infect a naive horse and severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice. During a 58 -day infection period {{in the blood of}} the <b>horse,</b> <b>p</b> 44 E conversion was evident in a total of 11 new p 44 Es, 48 % (115 / 242) of the sequenced p 44 E population. During a 50 -day infection period in the blood of SCID mice, p 44 E conversion was manifested in a total of 13 new p 44 Es, 42 % (192 / 460) of the p 44 E population. Thus, similar levels of p 44 E convertants were detected in either {{the presence or absence of}} an acquired immune system, suggesting that T- and B-cell immune pressure was not essential for recombination and/or selection of the p 44 E variants. Analysis of sequentially changed p 44 Es revealed that the entire central hypervariable region of donor p 44 pseudogenes or of donor full-length p 44 s replaced the same region of the resident p 44 E as a cassette. Putative recombination points were detected within p 44 conserved regions flanking the central hypervariable region by the TOPALi analysis. Our results unambiguously demonstrated p 44 E recombination. The cloning method developed would facilitate precise analysis of the recombination process and the extent of diversity which the recombination creates in the antigenic repertoire...|$|E

Twenty-five mature horses were blocked by BW and randomly allocated to 1 of 5 dietary treatments: negative control (CTRL: 0. 085 mg of Se/kg of DM), 3 different dietary concentrations of organic Se provided by Se yeast (SY 02, SY 03, and SY 04 containing 0. 2, 0. 3, and 0. 4 mg of total Se/kg of DM, respectively), and 1 positive control provided by sodium selenite (SS 03 containing 0. 3 mg of total Se/kg of DM). Horses were fed the same basal diet (6 kg of grass hay and 3 kg of concentrate per horse daily) and received their respective treatments for a continuous period of 112 d. Jugular venous blood samples were collected before the morning feed on d 0, 28, 56, 84, and 112. Whole blood was analyzed for hematological profile, and plasma was analyzed for metabolites of energy, protein, and mineral metabolism; enzymatic activities and metabolites related to liver and muscle damage; and markers of inflammatory and oxidative status. Plasma metabolites related to energy, protein, and mineral metabolism, acute phase proteins, and enzyme activities related to hepatocellular, hepatobiliary, and muscle damage were not affected by Se source or dose. There were no differences among treatments in either reactive oxygen metabolites or thiol group concentrations in plasma. However, a linear decrease (P < 0. 01) in plasma total antioxidants was observed with increasing Se yeast supplementation. Furthermore, total antioxidant concentrations were less in SY 03 than SS 03 <b>horses</b> (<b>P</b> < 0. 05), and were less in SY 03 and SY 04 than CTRL <b>horses</b> (<b>P</b> < 0. 05).

40|$|In `sympathetic horsemanship¿ the {{importance}} of the natural behaviour of the horse and the use of body language in communication is emphasised. However, it is unclear what effect sympathetic horsemanship has on the welfare of horses. During a 5 -week starting period the effect of a sympathetic (ST) versus a conventional (CT) training method was studied using 28 young Warmblood horses. Behavioural observations during the starting period as well as during a standardised final riding test were performed by trained observers. A Wilcoxon matched-pair test was used to detect differences within groups, Mann-Whitney-U to test differences between groups, and principal component analysis (PCA) to evaluate the effect on multiple variables simultaneously. A human-approach test showed that ST horses snorted significantly less compared to CT <b>horses</b> (<b>P</b> = 0. 006) after the training period. Furthermore, CT horses showed more fear and stress-related behaviours during training such as `body tension¿ (P < 0. 001), `high head carriage¿ (P < 0. 001), `lip movements¿ (P = 0. 008) and `teeth grinding¿ (P = 0. 03). Principal component analysis demonstrated that horses showed consistent differences in a range of behavioural and heart-rate parameters between groups.

40|$|Background: Inflammatory airway disease (IAD) affects {{performance}} and well-being in horses. Diagnosis is primarily reached by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cytology {{but this is}} invasive and requires sedation. Objectives: The {{purpose of this study}} was to identify candidate blood biomarkers of IAD using species-specific expression microarrays. Methods: Horse Gene Expression Microarrays were used to investigate global mRNA expression in circulating leukocytes from healthy and IAD-affected standardbreds and endurance horses. Results: Nine genes were significantly differentially regulated in standardbreds and 61 in endurance <b>horses</b> (<b>P</b> < 0. 001). These genes were mainly related to inflammation (eg. ALOX 15 B, PLA 2 G 12 B and PENK), oxidant/antioxidant balance (eg. DUOXA 2 and GSTO 1 - 1) and stress (eg. V 1 aR, GRLF 1, Homer- 2 and MAOB). DUOXA 2, ALOX 15 B, PLA 2 G 12 B, MAOB and GRLF 1 variations of expression were further validated by RT-qPCR. The deregulation of the oxidant/antioxidant balance was demonstrated at the protein level by an increase of glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity in heparinised whole blood of IAD-affected standardbreds (P = 0. 0025) and endurance <b>horses</b> (<b>P</b> = 0. 0028). There was good correlation (r = 0. 7354) between BAL neutrophil percentage and whole blood GPx activity in all horses. Conclusions: There is accumulating evidence that, even when systemic clinical signs are not evident, circulating leukocyte gene expression can reflect responses of other tissues, leading to potential diagnostic applications in the future. Although not specific for IAD, whole blood GPx activity appears to reflect BAL neutrophil percentage. This finding should be further assessed by testing a larger number of horses. Peer reviewe...|$|R

Because the functions of equine PIMs in endotoxemia remain unknown, we studied {{the role played by}} equine PIMs in endotoxin-induced pulmonary pathophysiology. We achieved this by using a recently developed protocol to deplete PIMs in order to compare lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -induced pulmonary responses in horses with or without PIMs. Horses treated with gadolinium chloride (GC; 10 mg/kg intravenous) to deplete PIMs or endotoxin-free saline (n = 4) were injected with Escherichia coli LPS (E. coli LPS; 50 ng/kg intravenously) 48 h after GC or saline. Control horses (n = 5) received two injections of endotoxin-free saline at 48 h intervals. All the horses were euthanized 2 h after LPS or saline challenge. Immunohistology for the PIMs showed their reduced numbers in GC-treated horses. The LPS treatment of normal and GC-treated horses increased diastolic and systolic pulmonary arterial pressures at 30 min compared to the saline-treated <b>horses</b> (<b>P</b> < 0. 05). However, horses pre-treated with GC did not have an LPS-induced increase in mean pulmonary arterial pressure compared to the LPS-treated <b>horses</b> (<b>P</b> < 0. 05). Light and electron microscopic immunocytochemistry detected extensive labeling for LPS in PIMs of LPS-treated horses. Both the LPS-treated groups had more alveolar septal cells positive for TNF-α and IL- 1 β compared to control horses, which did not receive LPS (P < 0. 05). However, GC-treated horses challenged with the LPS showed less IL- 1 β-positive cells (P < 0. 05). Immuno-electron microscopy localized TNF-α and IL- 1 β in PIMs. These new data show that PIMs endocytose LPS and contain TNF-α and IL- 1 β and their depletion partially inhibits LPS-induced pulmonary inflammatory responses...|$|R

This study aimed {{to determine whether}} intravenous liposomes accumulate in lamellar tissue during laminitis development in horses so as to assess their potential for targeted lamellar drug delivery. Polyethylene-glycol (PEG) coated liposomes were prepared according to the film hydration method and labelled using (99 m) Tc-hexamethyl-propylene-amine-oxime. Six horses received 10 g/kg oligofructose via nasogastric tube to induce laminitis, and four control horses received water via nasogastric tube. All horses received 300 micromol (99 m) Tc-PEG-liposomes (5. 5 GBq) plus 5. 5 micromol/kg PEG-liposomes by slow intravenous infusion. Scintigraphic imaging was performed at 0, 6 and 12 h post-infusion. Technetium- 99 m liposome uptake was measured in regions of interest over the hoof, fetlock and metacarpus. At the study end-point horses were euthanased, tissue samples collected and tissue liposome levels were calculated {{as the percentage of}} the injected dose of (99 m) Tc-liposomes per kilogram of tissue. Data were analysed non-parametrically. All horses receiving oligofructose developed clinical and histological signs of laminitis. Technetium- 99 m liposome uptake in the hoof increased with time in laminitis <b>horses</b> (<b>P</b> = 0. 04), but decreased with time in control <b>horses</b> (<b>P</b> = 0. 01).

Liposomes accumulated in lamellar tissue during oligofructose-induced laminitis development and demonstrated potential for targeted lamellar drug delivery in acute laminitis.

Immunohistochemical and histopathological analysis of lymphoid tissues of affected CVID horses revealed an absence of B cells in the bone marrow and spleen.

Samples were collected from high load-bearing areas of the dorsal radial facet (intermittent high load) and an area of the palmar condyle (low constant load) in five non-trained and three trained young racehorses. The data show that COMP is much less abundant in the matrix in intermittent high loaded areas of articular cartilage from trained horses as compared to the untrained <b>horses</b> (<b>p</b> = 0. 036).

The immunological basis of RAO remains uncertain although its chronicity, its localization to a mucosal surface and its domination by a neutrophilic, non-septic inflammatory response, suggest involvement of Interleukin- 17 (IL- 17).

To gain insight into the mechanism of its pathogenesis, 24 -h profiles for peripheral plasma melatonin, serotonin, dopamine and cortisol concentrations were determined at the winter and summer solstices, and the autumn and spring equinoxes in six horses diagnosed with Cushing’s disease and six matched controls. The nocturnal rises in plasma melatonin concentrations, although different across seasons, were broadly of the same duration and similar amplitude in both groups of animals (P > 0. 05). The plasma concentrations of cortisol did not show seasonal variation and were different in diseased horses only in the summer when they were higher across the entire 24 -h period (P < 0. 05).

Generalized Procrustes Analysis was performed and there was significant consensus between observers (55. 66 % of variation was explained by the consensus profile, which was different from 100 randomly generated profiles, P < 0. 001). Three main dimensions of behavior were detected. The two extremes of each dimension were labeled by assigning terms more frequently used by observers: Dimension 1 was labeled agitated/relaxed, Dimension 2 excited/tired, while Dimension 3 appeared to indicate engagement of the horse with its environment. Individual differences were noted, and there were significant effects of time of ride, and of group of horses on the scores (analyzed by repeated measures ANOVA). The horses scored as significantly more “tired” (Dimension 2) mid-way through {{and at the end of}} the ride, compared to pre-ride (P < 0. 05). The eight horses that finished the ride successfully scored as more “engaged” (Dimension 3) pre-ride than the two unsuccessful <b>horses</b> (<b>P</b> < 0. 05). QBA may be a useful addition to evaluation of health and physiological measures of competing horses...|$|R

The experiment was realized in Riding Centre of the Department of Animal Husbandry, Faculty of Agrobiology and Food Resources, Slovak University of Agriculture in Nitra. Total 14 warmblood sport horses geldings were used 7 horses in control group, 7 horses in experimental group respectively, Slovak warmblood bred, average body weight 525 plus minus 75 kg and 6 8 plus minus 3 Years. The control group of horses were fed by crimped barley, meadow hay and mineral feed mixture. Feed rations in experimental group were supplemented with a photogenic additive containing a blend of essential oils from origanum, anise and citrus, as well as a prebiotic rich in fructooligosaccharides. Blood serum was collected 3 times during the experiment, in the beginning of the experiment, and every 45 days. The experiment lasted 90 days. After the 45 days of phytoadditive supplementation we found a tendency of lower concentrations of serum triglycerides milimol l and total cholesterol milimol 1 in experimental group of <b>horses</b> <b>P.</b> In serum concentrations of glucose, total proteins and urea we find similar values in all of groups. We analyzed a positive effect of phylogenetic additive on organic matter digestibility of feed ration. In experimental group of horses we found significantly, higher organic matter faecal digestibility coefficient 73 per cent in comparison with control group 68 per cent. We analyzed insignificant effect of a phytoadditive on blood serum concentrations during 90 days of experiment. We found positive effect of phytoadditve supplementation on total faecal digestibility of organic nutrients...|$|R
30|$|This chapter also {{discusses}} {{variations in}} herd compositions through time and space. Various cultural factors {{can be seen}} influencing the representation of species, such as {{the reduction in the}} use of the horse for transport through the twentieth century and food taboos: Russians are not horsemeat eaters, unlike the Yakut; whereas in Yakutia, pigs (introduced by the Russians) were for a long time looked down upon, and even now only constitute a minority of animals kept (p. 42, 46). The role of the environment is evident in the distribution of domestic species in the countries of the study region - for example in Yakutia at the north-eastern limit of the study area, horses make up over one quarter of domestic herds and there is a notable absence of sheep, whereas at the south-western end of the study area, hot and dry Turkmenistan boasts over 50 % sheep, and a negligible proportion of <b>horses</b> (<b>p.</b> 41). Although discussed, the importance of the environment and the extent to which it influences animal husbandry is not ultimately given sufficient weight. In the conclusion to the book, Ferret considers general horse husbandry models for the cultures across the study area, within which she compares horse population numbers to those of the human inhabitants (p. 308), but does not discuss the role of the environment in this identified pattern. It is of course possible to raise animals in environments outside of their 'comfort zones', but this requires greater investment by humans than for species better adapted to those environments (as seen in the contrast in input for Yakut cattle and horse described by Ferret), and it remains a fact that there are environmental, biological and behavioural factors which will affect animal populations and their suitability to different regions (e.g. Kerven et al. 1996; Temple, 1984).|$|R

40|$|Borna {{disease is}} a severe, immunopathological {{disorder}} of {{the central nervous system}} caused by the infection with the Borna disease virus (BDV). The detection of BDV in diseased animals, mainly sheep and horses, is achieved by histological, immunohistochemical and serological approaches and/or PCR-based technologies. In the present study, reverse transcription, real-time PCR assays were established for the detection of BDV in the brain tissue from sheep and horses, using loci for the p 40 (nucleoprotein) and the p 24 (phosphoprotein) genes. The PCRs were equally specific and sensitive, detecting 10 target molecules per reaction and one BDV-infected cell among 106 non-infected cells. In tissues from BDV-diseased sheep and <b>horses,</b> the <b>p</b> 24 target was detected at higher abundance than for p 40. Therefore, the p 24 test is suggested to be of higher value in the diagnostic laboratory. However, both assays should be useful for addressing questions in pathogenesis and for detecting BDV reservoirs in endemic areas...|$|R
