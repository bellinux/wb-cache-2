40|$|Ethernet {{technologies}} have evolved through enormous standardization efforts {{over the past}} two decades to achieve carrier-grade functionalities, leading to carrier Ethernet. Carrier Ethernet is expected to dominate next generation backbone networks due to its low-cost and simplicity. Ethernet's ability to provide carrier-grade Layer- 2 protection switching with SONET/SDH-like fast restoration time is achieved by a new protection switching protocol, Ethernet Ring Protection (ERP). In this thesis, we address two important design aspects of carrier Ethernet networks, namely, survivable design of ERP-based Ethernet transport networks together with energy efficient network design. For the former, we address the problem of optimal resource allocation while designing logical ERP for deployment and model the combinatorially complex problem of <b>joint</b> <b>Ring</b> Protection Link (RPL) placements and ring hierarchies selection as an optimization problem. We develop several Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model to solve the problem optimally considering both single link failure and concurrent dual link failure scenarios. We also present a traffic engineering based ERP design approach and develop corresponding MILP design models for configuring either single or multiple logical ERP instances over one underlying physical ring. For the latter, we propose two novel architectures of energy efficient Ethernet switches using passive optical correlators for optical bypassing as well as using energy efficient Ethernet (EEE) ports for traffic aggregation and forwarding. We develop an optimal frame scheduling model for EEE ports to ensure minimal energy consumption by using packet coalescing and efficient scheduling...|$|E
40|$|Ring laser {{gyroscopes}} are {{inertial sensor}} {{based on the}} Sagnac effect: rotation causes {{the frequency of the}} two counter-propagating beam in the ring cavity to be shifted by an amount proportional to the angular velocity. This shift (the Sagnac frequency) can be easily measured letting the two beams beat. Applications of ring laser gyros range from inertial navigation system to geodesy, to test of fundamentals physics. Several large laser gyros with high sensitivity have been developed in the last years. This thesis presents the work done with a square ring laser with a side length of 1. 40 m in the contest of the experiment G-pisa of the INFN. This experiment may help improve the performance of the mirrors suspension of the gravitational wave antenna Virgo. The laser design is based on instruments developed by the <b>joint</b> <b>ring</b> laser working group in New Zealand and Germany. It is a helium-neon laser working on the 474 THz line of neon. Earth rotation is enough to bias the Sagnac frequency to 110 Hz. The capacitive-coupled discharge exciting the laser, whose stabilization was specially designed, is the flagship of this experiment. In the first apparatus the operation was quite unstable with the laser gyro often blind to rotation. Long term operation of the laser was limited by the contamination of the gas. The laser have been extensively tested. Diagnosis of the discharge shows the prominent role of hydrogen as contaminant, leading to the installation of getter pumps. Ring-down time was measured to check the quality factor of the laser cavity. Investigation of the mode structure proved an invaluable tool to understand the behaviour of the laser. The laser usually works single mode, but unusually good Sagnac signal can be achieved with the laser working multimode. These analysis shows that the gyro is mostly limited by split modes: independent mode jump of counter-propagating beams causing the gyro to be intermittently blind to rotation. Stabilization of the beam intensity has been implemented to obtain more stable operations. Active stabilization of the optical frequency is designed, developed and tested in order to avoid mode jump and improve the performance of the gyro. A piezo-electric transducer is used to move one of the four mirrors, acting on the perimeter of the cavity. This kind of stabilization brings the laser against the subtle effect of backscattering of light of each beam in the other. A simple theoretical treatment of the backscattering and of its influence on the Sagnac effect is reported to explain acquired data, followed by some numerical simulations. Results obtained with this setup are reported: achieved optical frequency stability, prolonged operation (till now of several hours), consequences on the Sagnac frequency (periodic pulling) and rotation sensitivity...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE—To {{examine the}} {{hypothesis}} that gold rings might delay articular erosion at the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint of the left ring finger in ring wearers with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).  METHODS—Consecutive patients with RA were recruited. They were classified as ring wearers if they had worn a gold ring on the left ring finger {{throughout most of the}} time since disease onset, or as non-ring wearers if they had never worn a gold ring. Standard hand radiographs (with rings removed, where possible) were taken and articular erosion was quantified at the MCP and proximal interphalangeal <b>joints.</b>  RESULTS—Thirty <b>ring</b> wearers (27  female) and 25  non-ring wearers (12  female) were included. The median (25 th- 75 th centile) Larsen score in the left hand <b>ring</b> MCP <b>joint</b> of <b>ring</b> wearers was 1. 0  (1. 0 - 2. 0), which was significantly less than in their equivalent right hand joint (1. 0,  1. 0 - 5. 0, p =  0. 01). It also tended to be less than the equivalent left hand joint of non-ring wearers (4. 0,  1. 0 - 5. 0, p =  0. 06), with a similar but significant difference observed at the adjacent middle finger MCP joint (p =  0. 01).  CONCLUSIONS—The results of this preliminary study suggest that there may be less articular erosion at the left hand ring, and perhaps adjacent, MCP <b>joints</b> observed in <b>ring</b> wearers with RA. These data support {{the hypothesis that}} gold could pass from a gold ring through skin and local lymphatics `downstream' to nearby MCP joint in sufficient quantities to delay articular erosion. ...|$|R

40|$|Using Monte Carlo {{simulations}} {{and advanced}} knot localization methods, we analyze {{the length and}} distribution of prime components in composite knots tied on Freely <b>Jointed</b> <b>Rings</b> (FJRs). For increasing contour length, we observe the progressive factorization of composite knots into separated prime components. However, we observe that a complete factorization, equivalent to the "decorated ring" picture, is not obtained even for rings of contour lengths N≃ 3 N_ 0, about tens of times the most probable length of the prime knots tied on the rings. The decorated ring hypothesis {{has been used in}} literature to justify the factorization of composite knots probabilities into the knotting probabilities of their prime components. Following our results, we suggest that such hypothesis may not be necessary to explain the factorization of the knotting probabilities, at least when polymers excluded volume is not relevant. We rationalize the behavior of the system through a simple one dimensional model in which prime knots are replaced by sliplinks randomly placed on a circle, with the only constraint that the length of the loops has the same distribution of the length of the corresponding prime knots.

50|$|The O-rings {{were two}} rubber rings that formed a seal between two {{sections}} of the SRBs. The {{sections of the}} boosters were joined using tang and clevis <b>joints</b> and the <b>rings</b> were intended to seal the joint, while allowing for the inevitable movement between the sections under flight conditions. By design, pressure from within the booster was to push a fillet of putty into the joint, forcing the O-ring into its seat. The system never functioned as designed. The rings were supposed {{to sit in a}} groove and seal the joint between the sections of the booster. It was found, however, that flight dynamics caused the joints in the SRBs to flex during launch, opening a gap through which rocket exhaust could escape. As the <b>joints</b> flexed, the <b>rings</b> would come out of their grooves and move to a new position in the joint, a process called extrusion. The extruded ring would form a seal in this new position, but during the time it took for the ring to shift, the joint was unsealed and hot gases could escape, a process called blow-by. These hot gases would damage the rings until the seal was achieved.|$|R

40|$|Because of low hindrances during {{construction}} {{and lack of}} space in populated areas, shield driven tunnels {{are becoming more and}} more popular. Since 1997 these segmented tunnel linings are also constructed in the Netherlands but are difficult to accomplish in soft soils. Because of unexpected damages in the early constructed tunnels a full scale test set up has been build at the Delft University of Technology to obtain knowledge on the lining behaviour. The conducted tests were performed in the SLS in which it became clear that the joints in between the segments play an important role in the global lining behaviour. In order to asses the safety level of a concrete lining, and the ultimate load capacity, failure tests have been performed in the ULS. Generally a lining might fail due to concrete failure or by an ongoing rotation of the segment joints. With the aid of the collected test data a detailed description of the failure mechanisms is obtained. The influence of the segment <b>joints</b> and <b>ring</b> <b>joints</b> on the global lining behaviour is analysed especially at extreme loading conditions. Based on the measured segment joint rotations and lining deformations, interaction forces between adjoining rings are analysed. With the obtained knowledge on lining behaviour a FE model is developed in Diana for predicting internal forces and external deformations for loadings in the ULS. With the aid of this model different loading combinations can be analysed and eventually the influence of soil can be incorporated. Because the load capacity of the lining and its failure mechanisms is known, a probabilistic safety analysis may be performed for assessing the safety level of tunnel linings...|$|R

40|$|Downloaded Fsolid {{ferritic}} flanges have cracked purely due to overload; and {{stainless steel}} overlay ferritic flanges have cracked possibly due {{to a combination of}} mechanisms. The stainless steel overlay flanges may be more prone to cracking than solid ferritic flanges due to crack initiation by Cl SCC of the overlay and differential thermal expansion and residual stresses between the stainless steel overlay and the ferritic base metal. Nonetheless, a major factor in crack initiation for all of these cases is the high localized stress at the corners of the ring groove. It has been well documented that the configuration of standard RTJ flanges does not include sufficient radii {{at the base of the}} ring groove to effectively reduce the local-ized peak stresses. Note that the ASME B 16. 5 standard permitted a very sharp corner of essentially zero radius until a recent ad-denda which includes the requirement for larger radii, which should help mitigate cracking, but probably not eliminate it. During routine inspection of a 2 - 1 / 4 Cr- 1 Mo hydrogen process-ing reactor vessel in a petroleum refinery, cracking was identified in the <b>ring</b> <b>joint</b> flange of the inlet nozzle. The cracking was de-tected while the flange connection was in the assembled condition using a new angle beam UT technique.
