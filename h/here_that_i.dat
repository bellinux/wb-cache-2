500|$|The song {{begins with}} a {{keyboard}} before turning into an '80s-inspired dance-pop number. Reminiscent of Solveig's hit single [...] "Hello", the song has a [...] "pulsating" [...] French house composition, and a [...] "catchy" [...] hook and chorus, inline with Madonna's 2006 single, [...] "Get Together". According to Brad O'Mancey from Popjustice, following the introduction on the keyboard, the music continues to grow as Madonna sings the line, [...] "you feel the wind on your face and your skin and it's <b>here</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> begin my story", and crashes following it. John Mitchell from MTV News described {{that there was a}} [...] "propulsive" [...] energy in the track that felt [...] "authentic and alive". He went on to add that [...] "the calculated perfectionism" [...] of other club tracks by Madonna might appear to be chilly, but the composition of [...] "Turn Up the Radio" [...] instead was [...] "effervescent" [...] and [...] "happy". According to the sheet music of the song published by Guitar Tabs, [...] "Turn Up the Radio" [...] is set in the time signature of common time, with a moderate tempo of 127 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of D major with Madonna's vocals ranging from C to A. The song follows a sequence of D–B–Amin–G in the verses and D–G–B–Emin during the chorus.|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} {{originally}} {{set to be}} on Drake's debut album, Thank Me Later, but after Drake forwent the song, he insisted that Songz include it on Ready. Songz stated in an interview what fan reception to the track mostly had been that he should put a verse in on [...] "Successful", but Songz told BallerStatus, [...] "I was like, 'That's my homie's song.' Then initially, Drake {{came up to me}} with the idea like 'Nah dog. That's your song. I'm not putting it on my album. So it's going to be a waste. So it's {{going to be a big}} record with no one to go retrieve it.' So we put the verse on there just to give me a little more presence on the record for it to be on my album." [...] In an interview with MTV News, Drake explained how the song came about, stating, [...] "It has this pocket, and there was no melody yet. I remember [...] kind of making the joint, and then he hit this sound, which is the chords that are in there. It was so eerie. Like it was haunting, almost. I was like, 'Yo, that's it. You need to use that.' He started playing this patch, and just every note that he played fell into place. I had this beat sitting <b>here</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> love so much, and I didn't know what to do with it..." ...|$|E

On June 5, 1967, during the Six Day War, his battalion fought the battle of Um Katef in Sinai, then reinforced the Golan Heights battle. During the Golan Heights battle, he was wounded while helping rescue a fellow soldier who lay wounded deep behind enemy lines. He was decorated for valor after that war.|$|E

2500|$|The Scream 4: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack was {{released}} on April 12, 2011 by Lakeshore Records. The soundtrack features 12 songs performed by various artists mainly of the rock genre, such as Ida Maria, The Sounds and The Novocaines. The soundtrack received mixed reactions, with Gotham News stating that [...] "This new album attempts to retain {{the style of the}} old, while speaking to the present content-diluted market. It has some success, but no cigar." [...] Shadowlocked criticized the soundtrack's overly light tone, saying that [...] "There's little <b>here</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> would have picked for a horror movie." ...|$|E

[...] "It {{was only}} <b>here</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{acquired}} {{the level of}} professionalism I was craving for," [...] {{she said in an}} interview years later. At MAT Vertinskaya mastered two roles from Anton Chekhov's repertoire, traditionally regarded as difficult: Nina Zarechnaya (The Seagull) and Yelena Andreyevna (Uncle Vanya). Critics praised Vertinskaya's performances, [...] "emotionally charged, yet perfectly controlled." [...] Among her other triumphs of the time were Elmire in Molière's Tartuffe directed by Anatoly Efros, Liza Protasova (Lev Tolstoy's Living Corpse), Natasha (Alone with Everybody by Alexander Gelman), and Pat (Mother-of-Pearl Zinaida by Mikhail Roshchin). In 1989 Vertinskaya portrayed her own father in The Mirage or the Russian Pierrot's Way, a show that she herself wrote a script for and directed to mark the centennial birthday anniversary of Alexander Vertinsky.|$|E
2500|$|Mack was {{somewhat}} more guarded in his investigations and {{interpretations of the}} abduction phenomenon than were earlier researchers. Literature professor Terry Matheson writes that [...] "On balance, Mack does present as fair-minded an account as has been encountered to date, at least as these abduction narratives go." [...] In a 1994 interview, [...] Jeffrey Mishlove stated that Mack seemed [...] "inclined to take these [...] reports at face value". Mack replied by saying [...] "Face value I wouldn't say. I take them seriously. I don't {{have a way to}} account for them." [...] Similarly, the BBC quoted Mack as saying, [...] "I would never say, yes, there are aliens taking people. [...] I would say there is a compelling powerful phenomenon <b>here</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> can't account for in any other way, that's mysterious. Yet I can't know what it is {{but it seems to me}} that it invites a deeper, further inquiry." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the April of {{his first}} year in Australia he {{attended}} a picnic to farewell Charles St Julian, who had been appointed Chief Justice of Fiji. In responding to a toast, the 17-year-old Celua said in Fijian: [...] "I thank you for so heartily drinking this toast. Speechmaking is a new thing to me, you must therefore please excuse my words being few. I come from a once dark land – a land of cannibal cruelty – but Christianity has raised us from the lowest degradation, and now we are a Christian people. We are now trying to establish law and order in our land, and I ask you to help us. We most earnestly desire the establishment of law, and if you will help us it can be done. We want to govern Fiji in every respect as this land is governed. I have come to white man's land to be trained at Newington College. I am anxious to be taught. You were born in the light, I in the darkness. You were born in a Christian land, I in a heathen country. I wish to be trained <b>here</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> may be of service in the government of my own country. Again I thank you for so heartily drinking prosperity to Fiji." ...|$|E

2500|$|Through her long-running {{solo show}} Mrs Shakespeare, Will's {{first and last}} love (1989) American actress-writer Yvonne Hudson {{has had a long}} {{relationship}} with both the historical and dramatic Anne Hathaway. She depicts Anne and Will as maintaining a friendship despite the challenges inherent to their long separations and tragedies. Mining early and recent scholarship and the complete works, Hudson concurs that evidence of the couple's mutual respect is indeed evident in the plays and sonnets, along with support for the writer's infatuations and possibly adulterous relationships. Hudson also chooses the positive view of the bed bequest, sharing that [...] "it may have been only <b>here</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> possessed William." [...] Mrs Shakespeare explores the realities of keeping house without a husband while applying some dramatic licence. This allows Anne to have at least a country wife's understanding of her educated spouse's work as she quotes sonnets and soliloquies to convey her feelings.The 2005 play Shakespeare's Will by Canadian playwright Vern Thiessen is similar in form to Hudson's show. It is a one-woman piece that focuses on Anne Hathaway on the day of her husband's funeral. Avril Rowland's Mrs Shakespeare (2005) depicts Anne as a multi-tasking [...] "superwoman" [...] who runs the home efficiently while also writing her husband's plays in a businesslike partnership with him as her promoter/performer.|$|E
2500|$|Although workers {{compensation}} laws deny workers {{the right}} to sue their employer, it is possible for them to sue a related third party. Within a week of the explosion Williams Bailey, a law firm based in Houston, Texas, placed half-page advertisements in a local newspaper. The adverts read [...] "Were you seriously injured in last week's explosion?", and directed potential clients to the company website. The advert also claims that the firm has extensive experience in explosion-related cases. Fran Deisinger, director of the Milwaukee Bar Association, said of the ad [...] "It's a little disconcerting because it's such a terrible situation <b>here</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> think it probably rubs everybody a little wrong,", adding that although he believed the ad to be in poor taste, it didn't breach any rules for lawyer advertising. Although it is unclear whether any workers contacted Williams Bailey, it is known that at least one injured man, and the families of the deceased, have hired personal injury lawyer Bob Habush to represent them, who once before worked on a high-profile industrial case when three people {{died as a result of}} a crane collapse in 1991. On February 7, 2007, he launched a suit against Brennan based on these allegations. J.M. Brennan responded with the following statement: [...] "We are proud of our employees and the response they took in response to the explosion. And we're confident that the results of the official investigation will show that J.M. Brennan's work was reasonable and did not contribute to the cause of the explosion." [...] The suit was settled out of court.|$|E
