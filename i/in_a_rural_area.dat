5|$|On September18, a heavy {{northern}} gale wrecked {{the ship}} Smoker {{on the bar}} at Tampico, Tamaulipas, in Mexico. On September19, two ships were capsized, the John Howell and the J.K.L.

The storm made landfall early on September19 <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>rural</b> <b>area</b> of Tamaulipas to the north of Tampico.

5|$|This strong, long-tracked wedge tornado {{touched down}} in extreme {{southwest}} Greene County to the west-southwest of Tishabee, near the Sumter County border, at 5:30p.m. CDT (2230 UTC) and moved northeast.

5|$|Tropical {{cyclogenesis}} in {{the season}} began when a tropical low developed in the Arafura Sea on 5 January and last until 24 January, after meandering over northern and Western Australia. On 1 February, weakening Cyclone Beni entered the Australian region and brought severe flooding to Queensland, before dissipating on 5 February. Severe Tropical Cyclone Fiona formed north of Western Australia on 3 February and later peaked as a Category4 severe tropical cyclone on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale. Cyclone Graham developed offshore Western Australia on 24 February and made landfall <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>rural</b> <b>area</b> of that state on 28 February, producing flooding in the area. Tropical Cyclone Harriet existed offshore of Western Australia from 1 March to 11 March.|$|E

5|$|In late July, a trough of low pressure, which Hurricane Blanche avoided, was {{situated}} over the northeastern Gulf of Mexico. The system developed into Tropical Depression Six at 12:00UTC on July28, while located about 60mi (100km) southwest of Cape San Blas, Florida. The depression {{combined with a}} building high pressure system, resulting {{in the development of}} a strong convergence zone. This, in turn, caused heavy rainfall along the Gulf Coast, particularly in southern Alabama and the Florida Panhandle. With sustained winds initially at 25mph (35km/h), the storm intensified slightly while tracking west-northwestward. Early on July29, the depression attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 35mph (55km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 1010mbar (29.83inHg). Several hours later, it made landfall <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>rural</b> <b>area</b> of St. Bernard Parish, Louisiana, with winds of 30mph (45km/h). The system curved northwestward and dissipated at 12:00UTC on July30, shortly after crossing into Mississippi.
