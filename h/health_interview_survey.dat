40|$|In {{order to}} study the value of {{national}} <b>health</b> <b>interview</b> <b>surveys</b> for national and international research and policy activities, this paper examines the existence and content of recent and future <b>health</b> <b>interview</b> <b>surveys</b> in the 15 member states of the European Union (EU), Norway, Iceland and Switzerland. National <b>health</b> <b>interview</b> <b>surveys</b> are performed in most countries, but not in Greece (only regional surveys), Luxembourg, Ireland and Iceland (only multi-purpose <b>surveys).</b> The <b>health</b> <b>interview</b> <b>surveys</b> in the other 14 countries provide regular data on the main health topics. Of the 14 health topics that are examined in this inventory seven are measured in all countries. Questions on health status (e. g. self-assessed health, long-term physical disability, and height and weight) and medical consumption (e. g. consultations with the general practitioner, GP) are often included. Lifestyle topics are less often included, except smoking habits, information about which is sought in all countries. Topics like diet and drugs/narcotics are more often included in special surveys than in general <b>health</b> <b>interview</b> <b>surveys.</b> Despite differences in the content, frequency and methodology of national health surveys in different countries, these surveys are a valuable source {{of information on the}} health of Europeans.

40|$|This study {{examines}} the concurrent validity {{of a list}} of chronic conditions used in <b>health</b> <b>interview</b> <b>surveys.</b> The results regarding the prevalence of chronic diseases from three <b>health</b> <b>interview</b> <b>surveys,</b> carried out in The Netherlands during the 1980 s, were compared. In addition, the results for chronic diseases {{of one of these}} <b>health</b> <b>interview</b> <b>surveys</b> were checked against the medical records of 11 randomly selected general practices. The comparison indicates the prime importance of the wording of the question. The level of agreement between information about chronic conditions provided by patients and by general practice medical records differed widely for the separate disease categories. This was especially true for the reporting of migraine/serious headache, other diseases of the neurological system, diseases of the stomach and intestines and serious consequences of injury. Age, sex, level of education and how long the interviewee was registered as a patient at the practice played a minor role in these differences. When quantifying health differences it is essential to understand the impact of methodological influences, as minor differences in survey methodology have a substantial effect on the prevalence of chronic disease. Moreover, <b>health</b> <b>interview</b> <b>surveys</b> measure a different health status than general practice morbidity surveys. Neither method is the gold standard for the other. A consensus on instruments and methodological procedures of <b>health</b> <b>interview</b> <b>surveys</b> at {inter) national level should be sought. (aut. ref. ...|$|R

2500|$|Living {{in a rural}} community, {{whether in}} the United States, or around the globe, reduces access to medical services, health insurance, and changes health culture. Differentials exist between rural and urban communities, and some health {{disadvantages}} exist for impoverished rural residents. Since health of a population increases in geographical locations that have a higher prevalence of primary care physicians, rural areas face worse health. According to certain studies, measures of health and well-being indicate that rural populations have worse health outcomes. Rural residents have a greater rate of premature mortality (less than age 75 at death) than urban residents. According to certain studies in the United States, the death rate of individuals age 1–24 years was 31% higher than those in urban counties. The death rate of adults 25 to 64 years old was 32% higher among rural residents than those of suburban counties and of urban counties. These higher death rates were contributed to unintentional injuries, suicide, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. In 1997 in the United States, 18% of adults in rural areas had chronic health conditions, compared to only 13% of suburban adults. The National <b>Health</b> <b>Interview</b> <b>Survey</b> indicated that in 1998, 16% of rural adults reported poor health. Poor rural residents have only 21% Medicaid coverage, while poor urban populations report 30% coverage. Demographic and socioeconomic factors vary between rural and urban areas, which contributes to some health disparities. For extremely poor rural communities, variables in the community, like ecological setting, including climate, soil, rainfall, temperature, altitude, and seasonality greatly impact health. [...] "In rural subsistence societies, these variables can have strong influence on child survival by affecting the quantity and variety of food crops produced, the availability and quality of water, vector-borne disease transmission" ...|$|E

Results: According to GP-records, acute somatic and chronic diseases were more frequently presented in rural areas. At the same time self reported health problems point to a better health in rural areas. Conclusion: GP electronic medical records may be used to monitor the health of rural populations. These data can be obtained relatively quickly and easily and against acceptable cost. However, they do not give the same outcomes as <b>health</b> <b>interview</b> <b>surveys.</b> Reasons for this discrepancy may be; differences in the accessibility of specialist services and help seeking behaviour between urban and rural populations.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Mammography rates {{reported}} {{by women in}} the National <b>Health</b> <b>Interview</b> <b>Surveys</b> of 1990 and 1987 are examined. Why this screening modality is not more frequently used is explored. METHODS. Data from the 1987 and 1990 National <b>Health</b> <b>Interview</b> <b>Surveys,</b> conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics, are cross-tabulated and compared. RESULTS. In 1987, approximately 17 % of women over 40 years of age reported having had a screening mammogram in the previous year. In 1990, the rate doubled. Race declined in importance; income and education remained strong, positive predictors of screening. CONCLUSIONS. Despite this dramatic increase, two thirds of women are not having screening mammograms. Use was not higher primarily because women {{did not realize that}} screening mammography tests for breast cancer in asymptomatic women. Primary care physicians are the main source of health education for screening mammography. The data suggest that public health programs to promote screening mammography should especially target primary care physicians and women with low incomes and education.
