25|$|Less than a {{month after}} the Korean War {{armistice}} (a cessation of hostilities), Miller wound up in a drunk tank in North Georgia Mountains. Miller stated later that this incident was the lowest point of his life. Upon his release, Miller enlisted in the Marines. During his three years in the United States Marine Corps, Miller attained the rank of sergeant. He often refers to the value of his experience in the Marine Corps in his writing and stump speeches; in his book on the subject, entitled Corps Values: Everything You Need to Know I Learned in the Marines, he wrote: In the twelve weeks of hell and transformation that were Marine Corps boot camp, <b>I</b> <b>learned</b> <b>the</b> values of achieving a successful life that have guided and sustained me on the course which, although sometimes checkered and detoured, I have followed ever since.|$|E
25|$|In 1968, Callas told Lord Harewood, De Hildalgo had {{the real}} great {{training}}, {{maybe even the}} last real training of the real bel canto. As a young girl—thirteen years old—I was immediately thrown into her arms, meaning that <b>I</b> <b>learned</b> <b>the</b> secrets, the ways of this bel canto, which of course as you well know, is not just beautiful singing. It is a very hard training; it {{is a sort of}} a strait-jacket that you're supposed to put on, {{whether you like it or}} not. You have to learn to read, to write, to form your sentences, how far you can go, fall, hurt yourself, put yourself back on your feet continuously. De Hidalgo had one method, which was the real bel canto way, where no matter how heavy a voice, it should always be kept light, it should always be worked on in a flexible way, never to weigh it down. It is a method of keeping the voice light and flexible and pushing the instrument into a certain zone where it might not be too large in sound, but penetrating. And teaching the scales, trills, all the bel canto embellishments, which is a whole vast language of its own.|$|E

2500|$|... "Eight Misbehavin'" [...] {{was written}} by Matt Selman and {{directed}} by Steven Dean Moore {{as part of the}} eleventh season of The Simpsons (1999–2000). Guest starring in the episode were Jan Hooks (as Manjula), Garry Marshall (as Larry Kidkill), and Butch Patrick (as himself). According to Jonathan Gray in his 2006 book Watching with The Simpsons: Television, Parody, and Intertextuality, the episode makes fun of the [...] "conflation of real time and occasional predilection for time jumps" [...] often seen in sitcoms. He further noted that in [...] "Eight Misbehavin", [...] "in order to fit a character's pregnancy into one episode, we skip nine months." [...] Here, Gray refers the part in the episode where a new scene starts and Homer says: [...] "Man, the last nine months sure were crazy." [...] Bart responds [...] "I'll say. <b>I</b> <b>learned</b> <b>the</b> true meaning of Columbus Day," [...] and then Marge says [...] "I enjoyed a brief but memorable stint as Sideshow Marge," [...] followed by Lisa who says [...] "I became the most popular girl in school, but blew it by being conceited." [...] Bart then concludes by commenting: [...] "And then <b>I</b> <b>learned</b> <b>the</b> true meaning of winter." [...] Gray wrote in his book that [...] "Here, we are treated to a parody not only of how awkwardly time jumps are proposed, but also of how ultimately irrelevant any sitcom time is — nothing really changes, after all — and finally, of the sort of plots that traditionally fill sitcom time." ...|$|E

2500|$|He [...] had {{a little}} Wild West {{aggregation}} that visited the camps and did a tremendous business. I did some roping and riding, and Jack, {{who was one of}} the smartest showmen I ever knew, took a great interest in me. It was he who gave me the idea for my original stage act with my pony. I learned a lot about the show business from him. He could do a bum act with a rope that an ordinary man couldn't get away with, and make the audience think it was great, so I used to study him by the hour, and from him <b>I</b> <b>learned</b> <b>the</b> great secret of the show business—knowing when to get off.

2500|$|... “After I {{had learned}} to play a little, I was chosen to give all the bugle calls. [...] I {{had to get up}} in the morning before the others and arouse {{everybody}} by blowing the morning call. [...] Evenings at ten minutes before nine o’clock I blew again. [...] Then all of the boys would run for their rooms. [...] At nine o’clock the second call was given, when all lights were tuned out and we were supposed to be in bed. [...] Later on <b>I</b> <b>learned</b> <b>the</b> mess call, and eventually could blow all the calls of the regular army.” The Carlisle Indian band of brass instruments performed at football games, world expositions and presidential inaugural parades. On May 24, 1883, Luther led the first “real American” band to cross the Brooklyn Bridge at its grand opening ceremony.|$|E
2500|$|In {{contrast}} to the first two, Season 3 of the series was met with mostly negative reception. After the eventual cancellation of the show, Schwartz admitted that [...] "the whole {{first half of the}} third season was a total mess." [...] IGN faulted a season which, in their opinion, had [...] "far too much time and too many episodes spent with the less than beloved character Johnny." [...] IGN also noted that [...] "Kirsten and Sandy both suffered from unsatisfying stories," [...] and that the departure of character Caleb Nichol had been a mistake [...] "as he had been a great character to bounce off both of the elder Cohens." [...] In September 2007, Schwartz admitted in an interview for New York that the show [...] "went down the wrong road" [...] with Johnny. The season did, however, receive some praise. The new character Taylor Townsend was stated as being [...] "played to perfection by Autumn Reeser" [...] and her character was described as [...] "one of the greatest elements of The O.C." [...] Jeffrey Robinson of DVD Talk described the storylines as [...] "very intelligent and also incorporate a great deal of humor to keep your interest." [...] While looking back on the series in an interview for the complete series box-set, Schwartz explained that [...] "somewhere around Season 3, for reasons too numerous to discuss, I lost focus. The network wasn't really supporting the show." [...] Schwartz {{went on to say that}} Season 3 was probably [...] "the most important season, because it's where <b>I</b> <b>learned</b> <b>the</b> most. About television, about myself as a writer, about discipline and trying to hold onto your focus even if you're hearing a lot of opinions or being forced to add things creatively that you don't agree with. And I don't think Season 4 would have been as fun or as adventurous or as weird and zany and ultimately emotional if it weren't for that experience." ...|$|E
