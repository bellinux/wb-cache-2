30|$|The above {{concern has}} led to the {{development}} of the water-alternating-gas (WAG) process for <b>flood</b> <b>profile</b> control. The higher microscopic displacement efficiency of gas combined with the better macroscopic sweep efficiency of water has been found to significantly increase the incremental oil production over the plain waterflood. The WAG process was first proposed by Caudle and Dyes 1958 and has remained the industry default mobility control method for gas injection, mainly due to the lack of proven <b>flood</b> <b>profile</b> control alternatives. Reservoir key parameters such as wettability, interfacial tension, connate water saturation, gravity segregation, and the reservoir heterrogeneity could add complexity to the design of a successful WAG flood.|$|E

The effect of horizontal wells on <b>flood</b> <b>profile</b> has been investigated by using two different well configurations, viz., horizontal injection-vertical production (HI-VP) and vertical injection-horizontal production (VI-HP). The experimental results show that HI-VP configuration recovers more oil than VI-HP configuration. The commercial simulator, ECLIPSE, is used for simulating the flood profiles for these well configurations. A good agreement is observed with the experimental flood profiles.

Carbon dioxide miscibility achieved through multi-contact process (Stalkup 1992) which require a certain core length depending on the injection rate. The residual oil saturations in gas swept zones {{have been found to}} be quite low. However, the volumetric sweep of the flood has always been a cause of concern. The mobility ratio, which controls the volumetric sweep, between the injected gas and displaced oil bank in gas processes, is typically highly unfavorable due to the relatively low viscosity of the injected phase.

Experimental initial oil saturation distribution is supplied to the simulator using colored dye distribution by the Matlab image processing tool. The water flood profiles obtained by simulation using ECLIPSE are in reasonable agreement with experimental results.

30|$|Flood {{inundation}} mapping {{is important}} for helping identify potential <b>flood</b> <b>profiles,</b> and assist decision makers in planning and mitigation operations (Jung and Merwade, 2012). Due to inherent complexity and large numbers of parameters, flood inundation modelling processes often involve large uncertainties, especially at topographical formation where no sufficient data are available for model parameterization, calibration and validation. As a key global parameter in flood inundation modelling, it has been recognized that the Manning’s roughness coefficient (Manning’s n) could notably affect flood inundation predictions (Beven and Binley, 1992; Aronica et al., 1998; Hall et al., 2005). Furthermore, due to different types of vegetation, surface irregularity and non-uniform/unsteady flows over the floodplain, the roughness coefficient has demonstrated a high heterogeneity (Pappenberger et al., 2005; Liu, 2009). Previously, many studies were devoted to analyse uncertainty propagation from manning’s roughness coefficients during flood modelling, such as Generalized Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation (GLUE) and traditional Monte Carlo simulations (MCS) (Aronica et al., 1998; Aronica et al., 2002; Van Vuren et al., 2005; Reza Ghanbarpour et al., 2011; Jung and Merwade, 2012). However, most of these studies tend to adopt homogenous values of roughness coefficient over the study domain, and this could lead to significant discrepancies between the observed data and simulation results.|$|R

In this study, some spatial analysis techniques are presented {{that might be}} employed with Landsat TM data to analyze forest structure characteristics. A case study is presented wherein fractal dimensions (FDs), along with a simple spatial autocorrelation technique (Moran’s I), were related to stand density parameters of the Oakmulgee National Forest located in the southeastern United States (Alabama). The results indicate that when smaller trees do not dominate the landscape (< 50 %), forested areas can be differentiated according to breast sizes and thus important flood plain characteristics such as ratio of obstructed area to total area can be estimated from remotely sensed data using the studied indices. This would facilitate the estimation of hydraulic roughness coefficients for computation of <b>flood</b> <b>profiles</b> needed for bridge design. FD and Moran’s I remained fairly constant around the values of 2. 7 and 0. 9 (resp.) for samples with either greater than 50 % saplings or less than 50 % sawtimber and with ranges of 2. 7 – 2. 9 and 0. 6 – 0. 9 as the saplings decreased or the sawtimber increased.

40|$|ABSTRACT: In recent years, Cagayan de Oro has {{experienced}} the damaging impacts of flooding. In December 2011, Tropical Storm Sendong (Washi) caused {{the most devastating}} flood in the city’s history which caused unparalleled damages and casualties. To mitigate the impacts of river flooding, the DPWH has instituted the Flood Risk Management Project – Cagayan de Oro River which proposes {{the construction of a}} 12 -km dike system along the river. However, the dike system is designed for a Pablo scale flood which is estimated at 25 -year return period, as compared to a Sendong scale flood which is approximated at 50 -year return period. This study aims to determine the flood inundated area along the Cagayan de Oro River considering the proposed dike system under a Sendong scale flood. A high resolution Digital Terrain Model (DTM) derived from Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data was used to extract the topography and river geometry along the channel with the use of HEC-GeoRAS. <b>Flood</b> <b>profiles</b> were then determined using a one-dimensional steady-state flow model through HEC-RAS. The model was calibrated and validated using the actual Pablo and Sendong flood maps. The hydraulic model was then used to simulate water-surface elevations and then combined with the DTM to obtain the spatial extent and flood depths. After running through 66 models, the final model is used to simulate the flood behavior with the proposed dike system. Results show that majority of the areas along the river are protected by the dike, thus conforming to the Pablo scale flood design. However, under a Sendong flood, results show that some areas along barangays Carmen...|$|R

40|$|The Township of Gawler, {{situated}} 40 km North-North East of Adelaide in South Australia, {{is vulnerable}} to flooding from the Gawler River system and has been inundated 14 times over the last 150 years. Until now, flood levels have only been classified qualitatively (minor, moderate, major) and flood warnings were issued accordingly. Quantitative predictions of flood water levels at key points within the Township of Gawler will provide the local population with greater resilience to floods and its associated hazards. This paper presents the development of such a flood forecasting tool. The HEC-RAS (Hydraulic Engineering Centre River Analysis System) {{was used in this}} study to model the <b>flood</b> <b>profiles</b> of the three river system consisting of North Para, South Para and Gawler River. Subsequently, the depths of water at three selected low-lying fords (First Street, Fourteenth Street, and Murray Road) within the Township of Gawler were correlated with river water levels at a range of flood quantiles of the Gawler River (20 - 500 yr ARI; varying from 100 - 1145 m 3 /s). For each of the selected flood quantiles of the Gawler River, the HEC-RAS model was run for a series of flow split scenarios between North Para and South Para Rivers upstream of the Gawler Junction. Nomographs were then derived to display the correlation between flow in either the North Para or the South Para River and water depth at each of the low-lying fords. These nomographs can now be used to predict the depth of water above the road's low-point at each location and it is expected that the quantitative nomograph tool developed in this project {{could be used as a}} template for improving flood forecasting systems in other similar flood prone areas...|$|R

This comment addresses issues of the applicability of the DMT method in the field. DMT also advocate their method as a replacement of the widely used Jones Formula. The Jones Formula was modified by Thomas (Henderson, 1966) to include the temporal derivative of the depth, instead of the spatial one, to specifically allow discharge estimation from at-a-section stage observations. The outcome of the comparison is not surprising in view of this approximation.

Although mangrove edges broadly tracked mean sea level along the east coast, deviations in edge elevation corresponded to substantial geographic variation in flooding dynamics.

The combination of these EOR methods are simulated by the useof ECLIPSE 100 on a simplified synthetic 3 D model (500 m x 500 m x 36 m). A 4 meter thick high permeability layer with a permeability of 2000 mD is sandwiched between two low permeability layers of 100 mD. For most of the simulations, the oil viscosity was 30 cp. After 30 years of production, polymer flooding as a mobility control yieldedan additional recovery of 6. 7 % of STOOIP. The combination of mobilitycontrol and deep profile control almost doubled the effect andgave additional recovery of 11. 3 % of STOOIP. Sensitivity studies showedthat the effect of deep profile control is highly dependent on theextension of the partly blocked zone. The larger the blocking zone,the higher recovery by deep profile control. Saturation plots showedthat polymer flooding advances the water front in the low permeablelayers while profile control recover additional oil around the blockedarea inside the low permeable formation.

40|$|Many of {{the large}} rivers in {{southern}} Africa exhibit a strong bedrock influence, being characterised by a channel incised 10 – 20 m into ancient planation surfaces. Under alluviated conditions, these channels display downstream sequences of channel types, including alluvial single thread, braided, bedrock anastomosed, mixed anastomosed, and pool-rapid. This sequence of channel types has been reviewed using aerial imagery for the Sabie River, which drains a 6320 km 2 catchment and flows across the Lowveld of South Africa. Prior to 2000, the river exhibited a downstream sequence of channel types that broadly alternated from alluvial single thread or braided to bedrock anstomosed or mixed anastomosed, with pool-rapid types also present locally. Unconsolidated (predominantly sandy) alluvial sediments were significantly eroded by cyclone-driven extreme floods both in 2000 and 2012, exposing the underlying bedrock template along considerable lengths of the river. This bedrock-dominated state was surveyed using aerial LIDAR following the 2012 <b>flood.</b> Long <b>profile</b> data revealed the strong gradient control exerted by the bedrock anastomosed and mixed anastomosed channel types, which creates hydraulic conditions suitable for deposition in the upstream alluvial reaches. The role of these bedrock-influenced channel types on hydraulic character is also revealed in the results of 2 D hydraulic modelling of moderate flood (3500 m 3 s- 1) as the bedrock or mixed anastomosed channel type is drowned out, resulting in dramatically increased velocities along the entire river and a general stripping of unconsolidated and consolidated sediments regardless of initial channel type or location...|$|R

Literature on climate change associated with flood management over the GBM River basin as well as South Asia supports this argument.

40|$|Future flood {{frequency}} {{for the upper}} Truckee River basin (UTRB) is assessed using non-stationary extreme value models and design-life risk methodology. Historical floods are simulated at two UTRB gauge locations, Farad and Reno, using the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model and non-stationary Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) models. The non-stationary GEV models are fit to the cool season (November–April) monthly maximum flows using historical monthly precipitation totals and average temperature. Future cool season flood distributions are subsequently calculated using downscaled projections of precipitation and temperature from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP- 5) archive. The resulting exceedance probabilities are combined to calculate {{the probability of a}} flood of a given magnitude occurring over a specific time period (referred to as flood risk) using recent developments in design-life risk methodologies. This paper provides the first end-to-end analysis using non-stationary GEV methods coupled with contemporary downscaled climate projections to demonstrate the evolution of a <b>flood</b> risk <b>profile</b> over typical design life periods of existing infrastructure that are vulnerable to flooding (e. g., dams, levees, bridges and sewers). Results show that flood risk increases significantly over the analysis period (from 1950 through 2099). This highlights the potential to underestimate flood risk using traditional methodologies that do not account for time-varying risk. Although model parameters for the non-stationary method are sensitive to small changes in input parameters, analysis shows that the changes in risk over time are robust. Overall, flood risk at both locations (Farad and Reno) is projected to increase 10 – 20 % between the historical period 1950 to 1999 and the future period 2000 to 2050 and 30 – 50 % between the same historical period and a future period of 2050 to 2099...|$|R

To improve the reservoir producing degree, it is necessary to convert steam stimulation to other development methods, such as steam flooding, hot-water flooding, etc. However, heat loss is usually serious during steam flooding process due to the thin oil layer in Henan Oilfield of China. Therefore, hot-water flooding is proposed as an alternative of steam stimulation. The inter-well thermal communication is not generated completely, and the injected hot-water can flow to the corner well instead of moving directly to the edge wells that are closer to the injection well, thus improving the hot-water sweep efficiency. Additives such as foam and gel are usually used in hot-water <b>flooding</b> process for <b>profile</b> control and makes hot-water migrate to regions that remaining oil assembles. In addition, the water-alternating-gas method also does good to increase injected heat to the reservoir, thus decreasing oil viscosity and increasing crude oil mobility.|$|R
40|$|Small rivers, {{particularly}} those draining mountainous terrain, discharge disproportionately {{large quantities of}} sediment to the globalocean. Because small mountainous rivers {{are more susceptible to}} catastrophic events, they tend to discharge their sediments over relatively short periods of time, such as during floods. The impact of small mountainous rivers is especially evident on the coastal ocean, such as the Adriatic Sea where fully 75 % of the estimated 145 million tons (Mt) of discharged sediment comes from rivers with basin areas smaller than 7000 km 2. Within this semi-enclosed basin in the northeast of the Mediterranean Sea, of particular note are the high sediment loads of five Albanian rivers (located in the southeast), which, prior to dam construction, collectively discharged about 85 Mt yr – 1 perhaps much of it at hyperpycnal concentrations, which would have allowed the sediment to bypass the shelf and be deposited at greater depths. Geochemical data confirm that Albanian river sediment extends well into the southern and central Adriatic Sea. Delineating and understanding the flux and fate of Adriatic Sea sediments may be best facilitated through the reanalysis of existing river datasets and the acquisition of new river data, particularly during periodic <b>floods,</b> high-resolution seismic <b>profiling</b> coupled with sitespecific coring, as well as application of integrated ocean-sediment numerical models</p...|$|R
40|$|CO 2 is sequestered in {{geological}} formations {{by three}} trapping mechanisms: solubility, mineral and hydrodynamic trapping. This is {{to capture and}} securely storage the CO 2 emissions produced by human activities from reaching the atmosphere. For this to happen the injectivity of the formation needs to be evaluated, for which formation permeability and flow properties are important factors to be determined. Also, relative permeability and residual saturation should be estimated when two phase flow is injected, e. g. brine and CO 2. In this paper it was attempted to simulate numerically a core flooding lab experiment conducted to investigate injectivity of a sandstone sample. The experiment consisted of primary drainage displacement (brine displaced by CO 2) followed by primary imbibition (CO 2 displaced by brine) <b>flood.</b> The production <b>profiles</b> at both injection phases were estimated and the differential pressure across the sample was recorded. ANSYS software was implemented in this study to construct a 3 D core sample with similar size to the one tested in the lab. A fine grid mesh was generated for the model. Both injection phases were simulated numerically using the lab data. The pressure drop across the sample and the velocity profiles were extracted. Also, the relative permeability of the two phases was estimated. The results showed a fairly good agreement with those obtained from the lab experiments. The results are presented and interpreted...|$|R
40|$|The {{past decade}} has seen a {{revolution}} in genomic technologies that enable a <b>flood</b> of genome-wide <b>profiling</b> of chromatin marks. Recent literature tried to understand gene regulation by predicting gene expression from large-scale chromatin measurements. Two fundamental challenges exist for such learning tasks: (1) genome-wide chromatin signals are spatially structured, high-dimensional and highly modular; and (2) the core aim is to understand what are the relevant factors and how they work together? Previous studies either failed to model complex dependencies among input signals or relied on separate feature analysis to explain the decisions. This paper presents an attention-based deep learning approach; we call AttentiveChrome, that uses a unified architecture to model and to interpret dependencies among chromatin factors for controlling gene regulation. AttentiveChrome uses a hierarchy of multiple Long short-term memory (LSTM) modules to encode the input signals and to model how various chromatin marks cooperate automatically. AttentiveChrome trains two levels of attention jointly with the target prediction, enabling it to attend differentially to relevant marks and to locate important positions per mark. We evaluate the model across 56 different cell types (tasks) in human. Not only is the proposed architecture more accurate, but its attention scores also provide a better interpretation than state-of-the-art feature visualization methods such as saliency map.

40|$|Severe flood events {{turned out}} to be the most devastating catastrophes for Europe's population, economy and {{environment}} during the past decades. The total loss caused by the August 2002 flood is estimated to be 10 billion Euros for Germany alone. Due to their capability to present a synoptic view of the spatial extent of floods, remote sensing technology, and especially synthetic aperture radar (SAR) systems, have been successfully applied for flood mapping and monitoring applications. However, the quality and accuracy of the flood masks and derived flood parameters always depends on the scale and the geometric precision of the original data as well as on the classification accuracy of the derived data products. The incorporation of auxiliary information such as elevation data can help to improve the plausibility and reliability of the derived flood masks as well as higher level products. This paper presents methods to improve the matching of flood masks with very high resolution digital elevation models as derived from LiDAR measurements for example. In the following, a cross section approach is presented that allows the dynamic fitting of the position of <b>flood</b> mask <b>profiles</b> according to the underlying terrain information from the DEM. This approach is tested in two study areas, using different input data sets. The first test area is part of the Elbe River (Germany) where flood masks derived from Radarsat- 1 and IKONOS during the 2002 flood are used in combination with a LiDAR DEM of 1 m spatial resolution. The other test data set is located on the River Severn (UK) and flood masks derived from the TerraSAR-X satellite and aerial photos acquired during the 2007 flood are used in combination with a LiDAR DEM of 2 m pixel spacing. By means of these two examples the performance of the matching technique and the scaling effects are analysed and discussed. Furthermore, the systematic flood mapping capability of the different imaging systems are examined. It could be shown that the combination of high resolution SAR data and LiDAR DEM allows the derivation of higher level flood parameters such as flood depth estimates, as presented for the Severn area. Finally, the potential and the constraints of the approach are evaluated and discussed...|$|R
