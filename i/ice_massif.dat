5000|$|Mount Eyskens (...) {{is a large}} {{rock and}} <b>ice</b> <b>massif</b> rising to 2,300 m next northward of Mount Derom in the Queen Fabiola Mountains of Antarctica. It was {{discovered}} by the Belgian Antarctic Expedition under Guido Derom, October 7, 1960, and named for Albert Eyskens, the pilot {{of one of the}} two aircraft used by the Belgian reconnoitering party in this area.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{the new version}} (1. 2) of the “Ice” software designed for calculating the sea ice area of different cohesion according to pentad (once in five days) archival maps of the ice cover of the Sea of Okhotsk and the Sea of Japan, based on remote Earth-sensing data in the {{universal polar stereographic projection}} (UPS) and published in free access by the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) after each ice season since 1971. In the process of modifying the basic version of the software an additional possibility of processing operational ice map-schemes, which are being published operatively on the JMA website between December and May twice a week (on Tuesday and Friday) in a transversely cylindrical Mercator projection, has been added. Functions of creating zoning masks for calculating <b>ice</b> <b>massif</b> area according to operational map-schemes in regions with arbitrary borders for samples of any length and periodicity have been added. The possibility of calculating the volume of ice is realized by taking into consideration the average thickness of the <b>ice</b> <b>massif</b> in the selected area, which is calculated by the ice expert according to satellite imagery in the visible and infrared ranges. The description of formats of files with initial and target data containing information about zoning, thickness of ice, area of ice cover of various cohesion has been given. A technique for creating masks for regions with a fixed ice thickness on operational maps is described. Formulas and basic parameters for calculating the volume of ice in selected areas with arbitrary borders in the waters of the Sea of Okhotsk and the Sea of Japan are given...|$|E
40|$|A {{complex of}} ice cover {{characteristics}} and {{the season of}} the year {{were considered in relation}} to vessel route planning in ice-covered areas on the NSR. The criteria for navigation in ice - both year-round and seasonal were analyzed. The analysis of the experts knowledge, dissipated in the literature, allowed to identify some rules of route planning in ice-covered areas. The most important processes from the navigation point of view are the development and disintegration of ice, the formation and disintegration of fast ice and behavior of the <b>ice</b> <b>massifs</b> and polynyas. The optimal route is selected on basis of available analysis and forecast maps of ice conditions and ice class, draught and seaworthiness of the vessel. The boundary of the ice indicates areas accessible to vessels without ice class. Areas with a concentration of ice from 0 to 6 / 10 are used for navigation of vessels of different ice classes. Areas of concentration of ice from 7 / 10 up are eligible for navigation for icebreakers and vessels with a high ice class with the assistance of icebreakers. These rules were collected in the decision tree. Following such developed decision-making model the master of the vessel may take decision independently by accepting grading criteria of priorities resulting from his knowledge, experience and the circumstances of navigation. Formalized form of decision making model reduces risk of the "human factor" in the decision and thereby help improve the safety of maritime transport...|$|R
40|$|Long-term {{variability}} of large taryn-aufeises was studied {{for several decades}} in {{different regions of the}} USA (Alaska) and Russia (Chukotka, Kolyma, Southern Yakutia, Transbaikalia, and Eastern Sayan). Differences between volumes of individual <b>ice</b> <b>massifs</b> and the recorded maximal values change from 2 – 3 to 95 – 100 %, and they do not depend on sizes of ice fields and their geographical locations. No statistically significant dependence of the aufeis volumes on the atmospheric precipitation amount and the air temperature was revealed in the most of the above areas. However, a general tendency for decreasing of the annual maxima of the ice reserves due to the climate warming was noticed. The long-term variations of the aufeises show existence of cycles of increase and decrease in their maximum sizes with their durations of 3, 7 and 11  years with the 25 – 30 % amplitude of variations relative to the mean long-term values. In the Arctic areas, some of the giant aufeises do not melt completely during the summer and remain for a next winter. The volume of pereletoks (shortterm permafrost) varies within the range of 5 – 25 %, averaging 16 % of the spring ice reserves. In the southern geocryological zone, a clearly pronounced dependence of activity of the aufeis processes on the snow thickness was found: when the snow depth increased from 70 to 100  cm, volumes of aufeises decreased by a factor of three, and the aufeises disappeared completely under the thickness larger 120  cm. It {{should be noted that the}} processes producing the aufeis-forming sources of subsurface water, and the factors of their layered-ice accumulation remain almost unexplored...|$|R
5000|$|Ice caps are not {{constrained}} by topographical features (i.e., they will lie {{over the top}} of mountains). By contrast, ice masses of similar size that are {{constrained by}} topographical features are known as ice fields. The dome of an ice cap is usually centred on the highest point of a <b>massif.</b> <b>Ice</b> flows away from this high point (the ice divide) towards the ice cap's periphery. [...] Ice caps have significant effects on the geomorphology of the area they occupy. Plastic moulding, gouging and other glacial erosional features become present upon the glacier's retreat. Many lakes, such as the Great Lakes in North America, as well as numerous valleys have been formed by glacial action over hundreds of thousands of years.|$|R
40|$|An 8 -man oversnow {{traverse}} {{party of}} the 20 th Japanese Antarctic Research Expedition (JARE- 20) visited the Yamato Mountains in the 1979 - 1980 field season to search for Antarctic meteorites. After 991 meteorite specimens were collected by previous searches in the bare ice field near the Yamato Mountains in the eastern Queen Maud Land, existence of over 7000 meteorites was expected in the entire bare ice field. The {{party of the}} JARE- 20 planned to collect about 1000 meteorites of them in one field season. In less than one month of actual activities, over 3300 meteorite specimens were collected on the bare ice between October 1979 and January 1980. About 2000 meteorites were concentrated in very small areas of the bare <b>ice</b> around <b>massif</b> A and JARE IV Nunataks, and over 1000 meteorites were also concentrated around the Minami-Yamato Nunataks. But in the bare ice areas northwest of the Yamato Mountains meteorites were not numerous. The collected specimens are chondritic metorites for the most part, and the finds included less than ten iron, over twenty carbonaceous chondrites (type 2 in majority), about one hundred achondrites (eucrites and diogenite in majority), and also included possibly many unique specimens. This collection was officially named Yamato- 79 meteorites and each specimen was designated as Yamato- 790001 to Yamato- 79 XXXX respectively in order of finding...|$|R
