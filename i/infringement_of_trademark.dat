40|$|Abstract:- Today, {{the number}} <b>of</b> {{registered}} <b>trademarks</b> is huge and is increasing rapidly. Thus, the job <b>of</b> identifying <b>infringement</b> <b>of</b> <b>trademarks</b> by solely using manual inspection is tiring, laborious and time consuming. To {{cope with the}} tremendous amount <b>of</b> available registered <b>trademarks</b> {{and to protect the}} <b>infringement</b> <b>of</b> <b>trademarks,</b> a new automatic and efficient trademark retrieval system is necessary and urgent. This paper presents an efficient content-based trademark retrieval based on the synergy between the color-spatial technique and zernike moment method. Zernike moments could be used as an effective descriptor of global shape <b>of</b> a <b>trademark</b> while the color-spatial feature could be used to obtain color spatial distribution in the trademark image. To retrieve visually similarly look trademark, we use a weight Euclidean distance measure. Experimental evaluations conducted on a database containing 1000 trademark images shows that the proposed methodology is very effective in retrieving visually similar look trademarks. Key-Words:- Zernike moments, color-spatial, content-based, image retrieval and trademark...|$|R

But the Court's opinion curiously left open a leeway, allowing for possible future reversal depending on the shift in popular convention. Seirogan is one of few pharmaceutical drugs names thus given public domain status, aspirin being another immediately called to mind.|$|E

50|$|Tengen {{along with}} Spectrum HoloByte later {{licensed}} {{the rights to}} Henk Rogers on behalf of Nintendo to distribute Tetris in Japan, and Rogers traveled to Moscow to secure permission to distribute Tetris with the Game Boy. Around this same time, Nintendo approached Spectrum HoloByte on the prospects of developing a version of Tetris for the Game Boy, and a representative of Mirrorsoft, Kevin Maxwell, traveled to Russia to secure permission on their behalf. However, because Stein had secured the rights from Pajitnov directly and not from the Russian authorities, the USSR's Ministry of Software and Hardware Export stated that the console rights to Tetris had been licensed to nobody, and that Atari Games had only been licensed the rights to produce arcade games with the property. They sent a fax to Maxwell in England with 48 hours to respond; Maxwell however was still in Russia {{at the time and}} received the fax late, resulting in licensing being distributed to Nintendo. In April 1989, Tengen, who had previously filed an anti-trust suit against Nintendo, sued Nintendo again claiming rights to distribute Tetris on the NES, and Nintendo counter-sued citing <b>infringement</b> <b>of</b> <b>trademark.</b> In June 1989, a month after the release of Tengen's Tetris, a U.S. District Court Judge issued an injunction barring Tengen from further distributing the game, and further ordered all existing copies of the game be destroyed. As a result, 268,000 Tetris cartridges were recalled and destroyed.|$|E
40|$|Internet service {{providers}} {{are on the}} agenda, when considering their involvement in and responsibility for <b>infringement</b> <b>of</b> <b>trademark</b> rights. The keyword advertising by search engines and the activity of internet auction sites constitute {{the top of the}} iceberg, while the use of trademarks on social network sites and particularly in virtual worlds are up and coming issues. While the first two are entering trademark law through the door of criminally sanctioned trademark counterfeiting, there is no trade in physical goods in virtual worlds. The issue of trademark infringement might be raised, when virtual goods replicating physical goods are sold in-world under someone else's trademark. Similarly, the use of service marks for competing services seems like free-riding. But who owns rights in trademarks in virtual worlds?

40|$|The {{use of a}} sign on the Internet {{has caused}} <b>infringement</b> <b>of</b> <b>trademark</b> rights in the {{territory}} of a particular state, if its use has a commercial effect in that state. States may adopt different standards for consideration factors for establishing such a connection with a particular state. The first step in harmonization of applicable law at the international level represents the WIPO Joint Recommendation, which contains provisions on relevant factors determining the commercial effect, infringement and liability, remedies, etc. The Czech law does not determine the factors- whether the use of the sign on the Internet is in the course of trade in the Czech Republic. Due to the strict procedural rules, Czech courts may not proceed flexibly at imposing measures. Criteria concerning jurisdiction and applicable law should be set at the international level in order to foresee in which state the use of signs on the Internet might become legally relevant...|$|E
40|$|Supreme Court has {{followed}} lower courts' decisions on parallel importation of trademark goods by ruling as follows: If (1) the trademarks are legally {{put on the}} goods by the authentic trademark owner in that country or by its licensee, (2) said trademark owner {{and the owner of}} the same trademark in Japan is the same or is deemed to be the same due to the legal or economic relations of them, and (3) the quality of the trademark goods to be imported is deemed to be substantially the same with those of the trademark goods sold by the trademark owner in Japan owing to its capability to directly or indirectly control the quality of the goods, parallel importation of such goods is not substantially illegal as it will not harm the functions of trademark, namely representing the trademark owner and guaranteeing the quality of goods, and will not impair the reputation of the trademark owner and/or the interests of consumers. Supreme Court has also ruled that putting trademark on the goods manufactured in violation of the restriction of the territory and the prohibition of subcontracting of the License Agreement is not a legal use of trademark and jeopardizes the quality guarantee function of trademark as it deprives of the capability to control the quality of the trademark goods from the trademark owner. Use of trademark shall not be legal with respect to the goods manufactured in violation of restriction on the territory of manufacture. Violation of restriction on subcontracting will not make the use of trademark illegal. The restriction of subcontracting is not eligible for registration in case of the sole and exclusive license, without which use of trademark in violation of such restriction is considered not to be the <b>infringement</b> <b>of</b> <b>trademark</b> rights. The same shall apply to all licenses. Harm to the quality guarantee function of trademark shall be measured by more objective standards, such as the qualities or characteristics of the goods in stream, than internal relations of trademark owners, such as the violation of the terms of the license agreements...|$|E

5000|$|Prior to {{specifically}} targeted laws being adopted, dilution protection {{was used in}} some U.S. jurisdictions to attack domain name <b>infringement</b> <b>of</b> <b>trademarks</b> (see Cybersquatting). For example, in the 1998 case of Panavision International v. Toeppen, defendant Dennis Toeppen registered the domain name www.panavision.com, and posted aerial views {{of the city of}} Pana, Illinois on the site. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals found that trademark dilution occurred when potential customers of Panavision could not find its web site at panavision.com, and instead were forced to search through other (less obvious) domain names. The fact that potential customers might be discouraged from locating Panavision's legitimate website, coupled with evidence that Toeppen was in the business of registering domain names for profit, led the court to find that Toeppen's conduct [...] "diminished the capacity of the Panavision marks to identify and distinguish Panavision's goods and services on the Internet", and thus constituted dilution.|$|R
