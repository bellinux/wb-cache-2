5|$|Later British super-dreadnoughts, principally the , {{dispensed}} with the midships turret, so weight and volume were freed for larger, oil-fired boilers. The new 15-inch (381-mm) gun gave greater firepower {{in spite of}} the loss of a turret, and there were a thicker armour belt and improved underwater protection. The class had a 25-knot (46-km/h) <b>design</b> <b>speed,</b> and they were considered the first fast battleships.|$|E
5|$|Bismarck {{left the}} Kiel Fjord {{on the morning}} of 28 September 1940 heading east. After an uneventful voyage through rough seas, Bismarck reached Gotenhafen (now Gdynia) the next day. Here Bismarck {{conducted}} a number of sea trials in the relative safety of the Bay of Danzig (now Gdańsk Bay). By 30 November 1940, Lindemann had set a number of tests for the crew, which they passed easily. During high speed trials, Bismarck reached a top speed of , exceeding the <b>design</b> <b>speed.</b> However, one weakness quickly became apparent: without using the rudders but only the screws, Bismarck was almost impossible to steer.|$|E

5|$|Agordat {{was built}} at the Castellammare shipyard; her keel was laid down on 18 February 1897 and her {{completed}} hull was launched on 11 October 1899. After completing fitting-out work, the new cruiser was commissioned into the Italian fleet on 26 September 1900. Sea trials lasted from 11 February 1901 to 6 March, and during the final speed trial she exceeded her <b>design</b> <b>speed</b> by a knot. She nevertheless proved to be too slow and short-legged to be useful as a fleet scout, which limited her active duty career. She served in the main fleet in 19031904, during which time the fleet was kept {{in a state of}} readiness for seven months. For the remaining five months, the ships had reduced crews. During the 1908 fleet maneuvers, Agordat was assigned to the hostile force that was tasked with simulating an attempt to land troops on Sicily.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the lengthy}} design process, the ships {{proved to be}} {{failures}} in service, primarily {{as a result of}} their low speed. Intended to reach a speed of at least , none of the vessels were able to steam that fast. The changes made to Sebenico during construction were meant to address the problem, but she was unable to reach her <b>design</b> <b>speed</b> either. As a result, they saw very little active service, spending much of their careers in reserve. By the 1890s, they were reactivated for training ship duties, and in 1897 Sebenico took part in an international naval demonstration off Crete, where she sank a Greek blockade runner. Training ship duties continued through the early 1910s. During World War I, all three vessels were used as guard ships, but none saw action. After the war, they were seized as war prizes by the Allies and awarded to Italy in 1920; all were broken up immediately thereafter.|$|E
