50|$|Many {{researchers}} have explored {{the etiology of}} recreational drug use. Some {{of the most common}} theories are: genetics, personality type, psychological problems, self-medication, gender, age, instant gratification, basic human need, curiosity, rebelliousness, a sense of belonging to a group, family and attachment issues, history of trauma, <b>failure</b> <b>at</b> <b>school</b> or work, socioeconomic stressors, peer pressure, juvenile delinquency, availability, historical factors, or sociocultural influences. There has not been agreement around any one single cause. Instead, experts tend to apply the biopsychosocial model. Any number of these factors are likely to influence an individual’s drug use as they are not mutually exclusive. Regardless of genetics, mental health or traumatic experiences, social factors play a large role in exposure to and availability of certain types of drugs and patterns of drug use.|$|E
5000|$|On January 18, 2005, President Jacques Chirac {{announced}} {{the introduction of}} a law on a programme for social cohesion comprising the three pillars of employment, housing and equal opportunities. The French government pledged to further develop apprenticeship as a path to success at school and to employment, based on its success: in 2005, 80% of young French people who had completed an apprenticeship entered employment. In France, the term apprenticeship often denotes manual labor but it also includes other jobs like secretary, manager, engineer, shop assistant... The plan aimed to raise the number of apprentices from 365,000 in 2005 to 500,000 in 2009. To achieve this aim, the government is, for example, granting tax relief for companies when they take on apprentices. (Since 1925 a tax has been levied to pay for apprenticeships.) The minister in charge of the campaign, Jean-Louis Borloo, also hoped to improve the image of apprenticeships with an information campaign, as they are often connected with academic <b>failure</b> <b>at</b> <b>school</b> and an ability to grasp only practical skills and not theory. After the civil unrest end of 2005, the government, led by prime minister Dominique de Villepin, announced a new law. Dubbed [...] "law on equality of chances", it created the First Employment Contract as well as manual apprenticeship from as early as 14 years of age. From this age, students are allowed to quit the compulsory school system in order to quickly learn a vocation. This measure has long been a policy of conservative French political parties, and was met by tough opposition from trade unions and students.|$|E

Creativity was measured by the test for creative thinking - drawing production of Urban and Jellen, academic performance by general achievement, and academic preferences by a questionnaire. The sample comprised final primary school graders. Low and statistically significant positive correlation was found between creativity and school achievement in the sub-sample of girls. However, girls have a significantly better school achievement and prefer art as a school subject and the test administered demands visual art expression.

Over the last 10 years, the female prison population has increased by 60 per cent (Australian Bureau of Statistics 2013). Aboriginal women are massively overrepresented in the prison population. While approximately {{two percent of the}} Australian female population identify as being of Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander descent, Indigenous women make up one third of the female prison population. Offences committed by Aboriginal women are commonly those associated with extreme poverty, such as non-payment of fines, shop-lifting, driving and alcohol related offences and welfare fraud (Baldry 2013). Over the last 10 years there have been, however, significant increases in imprisonment for offences such as robbery, theft, assault and homicide. Almost all Aboriginal women in prison come from economically and disadvantaged backgrounds. The majority of women prisoners are themselves victims of crime, with many being the survivors of physical and sexual abuse. Most were in care as a child, with many having experienced childhood sexual assault and imprisonment. Most women were unemployed prior to incarceration with few having completed secondary education. Many Aboriginal women experience sexual abuse and racism at an early age, have repeated <b>failures</b> <b>at</b> <b>school</b> and come from families where excessive alcohol use, substance abuse, offending and violence are behavioural norms (Baldry et al. 2009).

40|$|The {{most common}} neuropsychiatric {{condition}} {{in the in}} children is {{attention deficit hyperactivity disorder}} (ADHD), affecting approximately 6 - 9 % of the population. ADHD is distinguished by inattention and hyperactive, impulsive behaviors as well as poor performance in various cognitive tasks often leading to <b>failures</b> <b>at</b> <b>school.</b> Sensory and perceptual dysfunctions have also been noticed. Prior research has mainly focused on limitations in executive functioning where differences are often explained by deficits in pre-frontal cortex activation. Less notice has been given to sensory perception and subcortical functioning in ADHD. Recent research has shown that children with ADHD diagnosis have a deviant auditory brain stem response compared to healthy controls. The aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate if the speech recognition threshold differs between attentive and children with ADHD symptoms in two environmental sound conditions, with and without external noise. Previous research has namely shown that children with attention deficits can benefit from white noise exposure during cognitive tasks and here we investigate if noise benefit is present during an auditory perceptual task. For this purpose we used a modified Hagerman’s speech recognition test where children with and without attention deficits performed a binaural speech recognition task to assess the speech recognition threshold in no noise and noise conditions (65 dB). Results showed that the inattentive group displayed a higher speech recognition threshold than typically developed children (TDC) and that the difference in speech recognition threshold disappeared when exposed to noise at supra threshold level. From this we conclude that inattention can partly be explained by sensory perceptual limitations that can possibly be ameliorated through noise exposure...|$|R

40|$|The thesis reports {{studies of}} {{adolescent}} boys of I. Q. 135 and above, with relatively low school achievement. Twenty-three Subjects were {{submitted to a}} questionnaire and interview which were designed to reveal their reactions to various aspects of school routine {{and the degree of}} their dependency on their home environment. And equal number of Controls were chosen from the tops of classes and the same number of teachers were asked to give their forecasts of the answers to the questions. The Subjects' responses showed that, contrary to theoretical expectations, these adolescent boys showed few feelings of resentment against authority, and that they were almost unanimous in blaming factors within themselves, such as lack of intellectual ambition or plain laziness, for their <b>failure</b> <b>at</b> <b>school.</b> The Controls, too, showed little sign of the rebelliousness usually associated with adolescence, although the teachers had anticipated that this problem would be paramount. Work, however, conducted at equal levels through daily psychotherapy or once-weekly Child Guidance revealed that lack of ambition and laziness were largely a result of feelings of resentment against teachers or parents, who were blamed {{in one way or another}} for the boys' <b>failure</b> <b>at</b> <b>school.</b> This would tend to confirm that the feelings of adolescents are so mixed that it is impossible for them to decipher them clearly and give them expression. Although the majority of both Subjects and Controls were without manifest resentment against their parents and teachers, it was noticeable that disagreements between the two parents or between parents and teachers in such areas as ambition for the child were much more in evidence among the Subjects than among the Controls. The questionnaire itself was designed in three sections, with the same questions being asked in various contexts in each of them.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{addresses the}} subjective well-being of school pupils and considers the associated factors which either promote or inhibit their well-being <b>at</b> <b>school.</b> The significance of well-being <b>at</b> <b>school</b> particularly {{comes to the}} fore where schools {{face the challenge of}} developing lasting and measurable knowledge and skills in pupils with the aim of preparing them for the tasks of later life. Well-being <b>at</b> <b>school</b> can also play a key role inasmuch as the pupils’ acquisition of skills is supported by their positive feelings and attitudes towards school because these emotions and mindsets provide a stabilising and trusting basis for learning and development (cf. e. g. Hascher, Hagenauer & Schaffer, 2011). The identification of influential variables is called for, particularly for the purposes of providing targeted support for well-being <b>at</b> <b>school</b> and preventing unwanted regressions – which have, however, been empirically demonstrated in pupils in later school years (cf. Czerwenka et al, 1990). This study therefore explores which factors at the school/school administration level, the lesson level and the individual level are significant to the subjective well-being <b>at</b> <b>school</b> {{from the perspective of the}} secondary school pupils that were surveyed, and whether differences between boys and girls can be established in these respects. The response to the research questions is based on a methodologically qualitative approach. Male and female secondary-level pupils (year 8) from schools in the Swiss Canton of Bern were asked questions in 16 single-sex group discussions. Their comments and opinions were evaluated using the qualitative content analysis method set out by Mayring (2010). In this regard, the following main conclusions were drawn as an overview: At the school/school administration level, both boys and girls find that the high frequency of examinations and the poor scheduling of the examinations that they are required to pass put a strain on them. According to their comments, the generally long school days and the amount of homework, exam preparation and apprenticeship applications that they are required to do at the same time also lead to stress and a feeling among the pupils of being overloaded. At the lesson level, well-being among pupils is promoted by lessons that are not boring (in terms of subject matter) and are sufficiently varied in their methodological format. With regard to a teacher’s character and personality traits, both sexes feel that a teacher has a positive impact on their well-being <b>at</b> <b>school</b> when he or she is sociable, close to the pupils, kind, and self-critical with an open, relaxed and humorous manner around the pupils. It is striking, however, that the groups of boys cite the aspect of the teacher’s character and personality traits and the quality of the relationship between the teacher and the pupils as a factor relevant to their level of well-being much more frequently and in more detail than the girls. At the individual level, girls link their well-being <b>at</b> <b>school</b> to a high degree to their learning-related emotions and motivational orientation. In contrast to the boys, the girls emphasise the importance of achieving good grades much more frequently, which also plays a crucial role in girls experiencing positive emotions. The micro-social environment of pupils – their peers and their parents – is also a relevant factor governing their well-being. Whereas boys see their peers as an important motivator in coming to school and as a significant factor in their enjoyment of school, girls emphasise the importance of their peers as an important emotional crutch for problems (<b>at</b> <b>school)</b> and <b>failures</b> <b>at</b> <b>school</b> (e. g. bad grades). Both boys and girls see their parents as an important and reliable source of support for learning which also contributes to their sense of well-being <b>at</b> <b>school...</b>|$|R

The findings show that left-handers differ greatly in their mental development by havingsome peculiarities of intelligence, world’s perception and prevailing thinking strategies, ways of memorization, specificity ofemotional-affective expression. The main problems of left-handed children in school performance are academic failure, lack ofperseverance, anxiety neurosis, and extreme emotional lability. Integrated development of the left hemisphere and the righthemisphere thinking of left-handed schoolchildren is a favorable condition for harmonious personal and intellectualdevelopment and effective mastering of various modules of the school curriculum.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} {{relationships between}} firesetting, antisocial behaviour, individual, family and parenting factors {{in a large}} community sample of adolescents. METHOD: A cross-sectional study of students (n = 2596) aged 13 years on average, from 27 schools in South Australia with a questionnaire on firesetting, antisocial behaviour (adapted 21 -item Self Report Delinquency Scale), risk-taking, drug use, suicidality, physical and sexual abuse, depressive symptomatology, hopelessness, anxiety, locus of control, self-esteem, family functioning (McMaster Family Assessment Device) and parenting style (Influential Relationships Questionnaire). Data analysis included chi 2, anova and logistic regression. RESULTS: Large significant differences are found between firesetters and non-firesetters on all measures.
