Winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is the most grown cereal in the Czech republic, {{represented}} almost in all growing areas and covers more than a quarter of arable land and over half of grain surfaces. This bachelors's thesis,,Factors affecting seeds development and maturation" is a compilation based on scientific literature concerning environmental influcences on the development, maturation and germination of seeds. The thesis also describes the basic physiological processes such as germination and dormancy and knowledges about seed vitality and effects of phytohormones. The main point of this thesis was to determine whether the arrangement of grains per spikelet affect their germination and other seed parametres. The thesis practically deals mainly with the seed germination in 30 ml and 20 ml of water. The experiment was created with the variety of winter wheat named Bohemia and new genotype of winter wheat called MRS or multi row spike. Seeds were gained by manual scaling out of the spikes and categorized into fractions, according to the position of seed in a spikelet (i. e. first, seconad, third, fourth or fifth). Seed tests were performed on the <b>folded</b> <b>filter</b> paper Hahnemühle in 30 ml and 20 ml of water. Germination took place at constatnt temperature of 20 °C in air - conditionted box. Measured values were germination percent, mean time of germination and germinating energy. Gained results were statistically evaluated. Seeds were also analyse with the OmegAnalyzer G, where the point was to determine wheter the position of the grain spikelet affects the content of the seed (nitrogen, gluten, strach). Seed parametres were different not only depending on the position of the seed on the grain spikelet, but also on the variety and amount of water. Comparing the different categories of grains among themselves differences were found. Both in optimal and stress moisture conditions were registred the best results in the Bohemia breed. MRS wheat genotype fared significantly worse in both conditions. The highest average seed germination in 30 ml of water showed third grains of Bohemia breed, which also was the only one able to achieve 100 % germination. First grains had the lowest average germination (94 %). MRS in 30 ml of water reached lower values than Bohemia breed. The highest average germination reached the first grains (94 %), but neither one grain fraction MRS did not reach 100 % germination. The worst levels of seed germination reached second and fifth grains (93 %). In 20 ml of water had Bohemia breed lower average germination than average germination in 30 ml of water, even so it still achieved relatively high values. The highest average germination achieved first grains with 98 % and the second grains showed the worst germination value (95 %). The fastest average germinating had third and fourth grains, second grains had the slowest germination. In 20 ml of water fifth grains germinated the fastest, and also reached the highest germination (95 %). Grains of the first fraction were the worst and ended with very low germination (88 %). Fifth grains had the highest germination energy (90 %) fifth day in 20 ml of water. The lowest values, only 1 % were reached by the first and second grains third day. The fourth and fifth grains showed higher values of germination energy under stressful conditions than in optimal. The first and second grains conversly germinated faster in optimal conditions. In experimental part of this bachelors's thesis was found that the position of the grains, its weight and size togehter with the different amout of water affects germination.

40|$|RNA {{secondary}} structure consists of {{elements such as}} stems, bulges, loops. The most obvious and important scalar number that can be attached to an RNA structure is its free energy, with a landscape that governs the folding pathway. However, because of the unique geometry of RNA {{secondary structure}}, another interesting single-signed scalar number based on geometrical scales exists that can assist in RNA structure computations. This scalar number is the second eigenvalue of the Laplacian matrix corresponding to a tree-graph representation of the RNA secondary structure. Because of the mathematical properties of the Laplacian matrix, the first eigenvalue is always zero, and the second eigenvalue (often denoted as the Fiedler eigenvalue) {{is a measure of}} the compactness of the associated tree-graph. The concept of using the Fiedler eigenvalue/eigenvector is borrowed from domain decomposition in parallel computing. Thus, along with the free energy, the Fiedler eigenvalue can be used as a signature in a clever search among a collection of structures by providing a similarity measure between RNA secondary structures. This can also be used for mutation predictions, classification of RNA secondary <b>folds,</b> <b>filtering</b> and clustering. Furthermore, the Fiedler eigenvector may be used to chop large RNAs into smaller fragments by using spectral graph partitioning, based on the geometry of the secondary structure. Each fragment may then be treated differently for the folding prediction of the entire domain. 1.

40|$|Abstract Background In high-dimensional data {{analysis}} such as differential gene expression analysis, people often use filtering methods like fold-change or variance filters {{in an attempt}} to reduce the multiple testing penalty and improve power. However, filtering may introduce a bias on the multiple testing correction. The precise amount of bias depends on many quantities, such as fraction of probes filtered out, filter statistic and test statistic used. Results We show that a biased multiple testing correction results if non-differentially expressed probes are not filtered out with equal probability from the entire range of p-values. We illustrate our results using both a simulation study and an experimental dataset, where the FDR is shown to be biased mostly by filters that are associated with the hypothesis being tested, such as the <b>fold</b> change. <b>Filters</b> that induce little bias on the FDR yield less additional power of detecting differentially expressed genes. Finally, we propose a statistical test {{that can be used in}} practice to determine whether any chosen filter introduces bias on the FDR estimate used, given a general experimental setup. Conclusions Filtering out of probes must be used with care as it may bias the multiple testing correction. Researchers can use our test for FDR bias to guide their choice of filter and amount of filtering in practice. </p...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the benefits of}} a temporal data model for debugging and run-time visualization of object-oriented software. Current debugging models generally only provide access to the current program state and support manual exploration of the state to uncover the cause of program errors. However, often the cause of an error lies in distant previous states, and a more comprehensive view of the execution history is necessary to uncover such errors. This is achieved through our proposed temporal data model and query language. This paper also shows the benefits of UML-like object and sequence diagrams for representing respectively the current run-time state and execution history. The main contribution of this paper lies in showing that declarative temporal queries and (run-time) object/sequence diagrams work in a symbiotic manner to achieve a more effective debugging system: queries help the user to focus on specific regions of the diagrams, while the diagrams provide a framework for reporting the answers to queries. Since run-time visualizations become unwieldy for large executions, we propose two broad classes of techniques to achieve compact sequence diagrams: folding operations, for nested calls and also a sequence of calls; and filtering operations, to remove unnecessary or irrelevant calls relative to a debugging task. We introduce a refinement of the sequence diagram to account for missing calls, and regular-expression labels for compacted execution sequences. Together, these techniques have proven to be effective and they form part of Jive, a state-of-the-art debugging system for Java.

Only forty-one genes (2. 3 %) were shown to be continuously expressed across the infection period, indicating that the majority of genes were transient and unique to a particular time point during infection. A significant number of pathogen-responsive genes were suppressed during the late stages of pathogenesis, while during active systemic infection (14 to 24 dpi), there was an increase in up-regulated genes in several GO functional categories. An adaptive response was initiated to divert energy from growth-related processes to defense, leading to disruption of normal biological host processes. Similarities in cell-cycle regulation correlated between SACMV and Cabbage leaf curl virus (CaLCuV), but differences were also evident. Differences in gene expression between the two geminiviruses clearly demonstrated that, while some global transcriptome responses are generally common in plant virus infections, temporal host-specific interactions are required for successful geminivirus infection. To our knowledge this is the first geminivirus microarray study identifying global differentially expressed transcripts at 3 time points...|$|R
40|$|Although {{substrate}} {{integrated waveguide}} (SIW) technology {{is well established}} for the fabrication of microwave circuits on rigid printed circuit boards, and the first implementations of textile SIW antennas have recently appeared in literature, up to now, no complete set of SIW microwave components has been presented. Therefore, this paper describes the design, manufacturing, and testing of {{a new class of}} textile microwave components for wearable applications, implemented in SIW technology. After characterizing the adopted textile fabrics material in terms of electrical properties, it is shown that folded textile SIW components, such as interconnections, filters, and antennas form excellent building blocks for wearable microwave circuits, given their low profile, flexibility, and stable characteristics under bending and in proximity of the human body. Hence, they allow the full exploitation of the large area garments offered for the deployment of wearable electronics. Besides SIW interconnections, a <b>folded</b> textile SIW <b>filter</b> operating at 2. 45 GHz is designed and tested. The filter combines excellent performance in the band of interest with good out-of-band rejection, even when accounting for the tolerances in the fabrication process. Finally, a folded SIW cavity-backed patch antenna is fabricated and experimentally verified in realistic operating conditions...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{introduces}} {{an effective}} way to buildefficient miniature C-band filters using high-permittivityceramics. The objective was to evaluate the feasibility ofsuch filters using commercial electromagnetic simulators anda conventional fabrication process. For the demonstration,the substrate integrated waveguide (SIW) technology waschosen. Compared with planar solutions, this configurationoffers good quality factors and good electrical performancesas a consequence. However, its dimensions are large, leadingto unacceptably large footprints for many applications. Thesolution proposed in this paper is based on a ceramic substratewith a permittivity of 90, which allowed us to work with shorterwavelengths. In comparison with a standard alumina substrate(permittivity εr = 9. 9), this approach makes it possible to reducethe footprint up to nine times. Two prototypes were realized on aTrans-Tech ceramic substrate (thickness = 635 μm, εr = 90, andtanδ = 9 · 10 − 4). The first prototype is a folded sixth-order SIWfilter including a cross coupling combining coplanar waveguideprobes and a thin microstrip line on an InterVia substrate. Thesecond one is a <b>folded</b> eighth-order SIW <b>filter</b> without crosscouplings. Here, we compare the sixth-order prototype with anidentical one built on alumina. The eighth-order filter, which hadno alumina counterpart, is a potentially useful alternative forsituations where complex technological steps must be avoided...|$|R
40|$|Reduction {{of power}} {{consumption}} is significantly {{important for all}} high-performance digital VLSI systems. This paper reviews several approaches for low-power implementations of building blocks for digital subscriber line (DSL) systems. Low-power implementations of Reedâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 3 Solomon (RS) coders, fast Fourier transforms (FFTs), FIR filters, and equalizers, and reduction of power consumption by use of dual supply voltages are addressed. It is shown that use of separate Galois Field functional units for multiply-accumulate and degree reduction can reduce the energy consumption of RS coders dramatically. A hybrid feedforward and feedback commutator scheme-based FFT is shown to require less area and full hardware utilization efficiency. Reduction of switching activity at one or both inputs of the multipliers {{is a key to}} reduction of power consumption in FIR filters and equalizers. The switching activity can be reduced by use of transpose structure and by time-multiplexing of an unfolded filter. A well established retiming approach can be generalized to find those noncritical gates which can be operated with lower supply voltages to reduce the overall system power consumption.
