5|$|On 13 April 1948, {{the goods}} hoist to the Waterloo and City line began to sink while a M7 class tank engine was pushing loaded coal wagons onto it. The engine <b>dropped</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> hoist's shaft, ending up {{upside-down}} and spurting steam over it. The driver and fireman managed to jump free, and the locomotive was rescued piecemeal {{and used for}} spares.|$|E
5|$|Australia toured New Zealand {{before the}} World Cup, and Poulton was <b>dropped</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> middle-order. She made {{four in the}} first two matches, both of which the hosts won. She {{struggled}} in these matches, taking 15 and 18 balls to score the four runs in either ODI, was omitted for the third match. She then returned to her customary opening position and scored 81 from 97 balls, including 11 fours, in the fourth match, helping to set up an Australia victory by 44 runs. The fifth match of the series was abandoned.|$|E
5|$|Both Titus and Domitian were fond of gladiatorial games, and {{realised}} {{its importance}} {{to appease the}} citizens of Rome. In the newly constructed Colosseum, the Flavians provided for spectacular entertainments. The Inaugural games of the Flavian Amphitheatre lasted for a hundred days and {{were said to be}} extremely elaborate, including gladiatorial combat, fights between wild animals (elephants and cranes), mock naval battles for which the theatre was flooded, horse races and chariot races. During the games, wooden balls were <b>dropped</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> audience, inscribed with various prizes (clothing, gold, or even slaves), which could then be traded for the designated item.|$|E

5|$|Celtic {{began the}} 2015–16 season again {{attempting}} {{to qualify for}} the Champions League. They knocked out Stjarnan from Iceland and Qarabağ from Azerbaijan in the early qualifying rounds, but lost 4–3 on aggregate to Swedish side Malmö FF in the final play-off round. This meant for the second successive season, Celtic <b>dropped</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Europa League. Celtic's Europa League campaign was poor and littered with individual errors which contributed to dropped points in every match. Celtic failed to qualify after finishing bottom of their group, and was the first time Celtic went through a group stage of a European competition without recording a single victory.|$|E
5|$|In early 1943, the Nazis {{decided to}} {{increase}} greatly the gassing capacity of Birkenau. Crematorium II, {{which had been}} designed as a mortuary with morgues {{in the basement and}} ground-level incinerators, was converted into a killing factory by installing gas-tight doors, vents for the Zyklon B (a highly lethal cyanide-based pesticide) to be <b>dropped</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> chamber, and ventilation equipment to remove the gas thereafter. It went into operation in March. Crematorium III was built using the same design. Crematoria IV and V, designed from the start as gassing centers, were also constructed that spring. By June 1943, all four crematoria were operational. Most of the victims were killed using these four structures.|$|E
5|$|On 8 May 2012, a 20-year-old man {{climbed over}} safety fences and {{accessed}} the underground ride area.

Neither he nor any guests on the ride were harmed following the ride cars being held at the boarding station. He was arrested for a public order offence, and the ride returned to normal operation the following day.|$|E

They beat Rushden & Diamonds over two legs to advance to the play-off final against York City on 16 May 2010. Oxford won the final 3–1, to return to the Football League for the 2010–11 season. The attendance was 42,669, a new record for the final, with around 33,000 being United fans.|$|E
5|$|Rodríguez {{made his}} European {{debut in the}} first-leg of their third {{qualifying}} round tie against Standard Liège on 27 July 2011. He played the entire match and provided the cross for fellow Zürich youth team graduate Admir Mehmedi as the Swiss secured a 1–1 draw at the Stade Maurice Dufrasne in Belgium. In the second leg, Rodríguez missed from an open goal from close range but Zürich won 1–0 to earn {{a spot in the}} play-off round against Bayern Munich. He played the entirety of both play-off matches against Bayern, but the Swiss side fell 0–3 on aggregate and <b>dropped</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Europa League.|$|E
5|$|The 2nd Brigade's next {{parachute}} {{operation was}} Operation Hasty in June 1944. This {{was a small}} diversionary raid carried out by sixty men from the 6th Parachute Battalion. They were <b>dropped</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> area between Sora and Avezzano, their objective being to harass the Germans withdrawing to the Gothic Line. The mission was a success: a German brigade was diverted to hunt the small force, and a German division was retained on rear-area security duties instead of going into the front line. In June 1944, the brigade {{was released from the}} Eighth Army and joined the 1st Airborne Task Force for airborne operations in the south of France.|$|E

5|$|After the Second World War Millwall's {{form was}} {{poor and the}} club <b>dropped</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Third and Fourth Division of the Football League. West Ham have never played below the Second Division in their history and often played a league or two above Millwall. The two sides did not play each other {{competitively}} between 13 October 1959 and 7 October 1978, making the 1960s the only decade the teams have not met. Despite the infrequency of their meetings, both sets of supporters still consider the other club their major rival. During these years, the Hammers enjoyed considerable success, winning the FA Cup in 1964, 1975 and 1980. They also won the European Cup Winners' Cup in 1965. Over four decades the sides were only in the same tier of the Football League for three seasons, in 1946–47, 1947–48 and 1978–79. They played two cup games {{against each other in}} the Southern Professional Floodlit Cup in 1959 and the Full Members Cup in 1987.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{recruitment}} of Tomáš Ujfaluši and Johnny Heitinga pushed Pablo down the pecking order, he finished the 2008–09 season with 21 league appearances. An offer from Real Zaragoza of less than €5m {{was rejected by the}} club as insufficient, but despite the arrival of Juanito adding to the defensive competition, Pablo said he was happy to see out the remaining year of his contract. In that final season, he played rarely. He took part in the early rounds of the Copa del Rey and in the group stage of the Champions League as Atlético finished third in their group and <b>dropped</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Europa League, but made his last appearance for the club, as a late substitute, on 20 December 2009.|$|E
5|$|As {{they entered}} the 2013 season, the Crimson Tide were ranked No.1 in both the AP and Coaches' Preseason Polls. As they were still undefeated {{at the time of}} the initial Bowl Championship Series (BCS) standings, the Crimson Tide were ranked first by the BCS on October 21. Alabama {{remained}} in the No.1 position through their final regular season game against Auburn. After their 34–28 loss against the Tigers, Alabama dropped to No.4 in all of the standings. The Crimson Tide closed the regular season in the No.3 position in all of the standings and failed to qualify for their third consecutive BCS National Championship Game. In the final poll of the season, Alabama <b>dropped</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> No.7 position in the AP and No.8 position in the Coaches' Polls after their loss against Oklahoma in the Sugar Bowl.|$|E

5|$|Celtic manager Gordon Strachan {{left at the}} end of {{the season}} and was {{replaced}} by Tony Mowbray. On 5 August, Samaras scored in injury time of Celtic's Champions League third qualifying round tie against Dynamo Moscow. This goal won Celtic the tie, 2–1 on aggregate, and helped them to their first European away win in six years. Celtic then drew English Premier League club Arsenal, but lost 5–1 on aggregate and subsequently <b>dropped</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Europa League. On 13 December, Samaras scored in Celtic's 3–2 win over Motherwell, this was his fifth goal in the club's previous four matches. He scored in Celtic's 2–1 defeat against Hearts on 19 December. This left Celtic four points behind rivals Rangers going into Christmas. From February onwards, Samaras was mainly played out of position on the left of midfield.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{resignation}} of Strachan {{at the end of}} the 2008–09 season, Brown's former Hibs boss Tony Mowbray became Celtic manager. Brown underwent surgery during pre-season in an attempt to rectify his ankle problem, but this didn't work, and he played matches despite not being fully fit. Celtic had a fairly good start to their league campaign, going into the first Old Firm match four points ahead of Rangers, but they lost 2–1. Celtic beat Dynamo Moscow in Champions League qualifying, but then lost the play-off to Arsenal, which meant that they <b>dropped</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Europa League group stage. The 1–0 home defeat by Hamburg on 22 October 2009 was Brown's last action of the year, as Celtic initially chose to rest him in another effort to heal the ankle injury. This proved unsuccessful, and he underwent a second operation in Rotterdam to try and clear up his ankle injury.|$|E
5|$|He joined Swansea City for a £160,000 fee in January 1982 {{and added}} a Welsh Cup winners medal to his {{collection}} four months later. However the effects of Parkinson's disease began to reduce his effectiveness on the pitch, and he <b>dropped</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Fourth Division with Hartlepool United in November 1983. During the 1984–85 season he spent a brief time as player-manager of Cyprus club Pezoporikos and later played for Northern League club Ashington. He was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease in November 1984. His life after football was tough, as he {{had to deal with}} the effects of Parkinson's, the loss of his business, and the breakdown of his 15-year marriage. He remained reliant on charity to fund his medical expenses, and was forced to sell his medal collection and caps in 1993.|$|E

5|$|In January 1970 Sabo and {{his unit}} {{departed}} for Vietnam {{to fight in}} the Vietnam War and he began corresponding with his wife regularly via letter. The unit came into contact with North Vietnamese troops frequently for the first several months of its deployment, but most of these were small hit-and-run attacks. On 5 May 1970 Sabo's platoon was attached to the U.S. 4th Infantry Division for a secret mission into Cambodia and <b>dropped</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> country on a UH-1 Huey helicopter. They were to conduct a series of interdiction missions against the Ho Chi Minh Trail with the assistance of heavy air support. For five days they came into constant, heavy contact with North Vietnamese forces that were often of superior size.|$|E
5|$|In March 1967, Dougan <b>dropped</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Second Division {{after being}} signed by Wolverhampton Wanderers manager Ronnie Allen for a £50,000 fee. He marked his home debut on 25 March by scoring a hat-trick against Hull City. He ended the 1966–67 season with nine goals in 11 games for Wolves, {{and helped the}} club to secure {{promotion}} to the First Division. He spent the summer of 1967 in the United States playing for the Los Angeles Wolves in the United Soccer Association, scoring three goals in eleven games to help Wolves to win the West Division title and then captained the side and scored a goal as they beat the Washington Whips 6–5 in the USA Final at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.|$|E
5|$|Lacking any {{reserves}} and possessing only limited artillery support, the division's engineers prepared the bridges over the rivers for detonation. From 27 March onwards minor actions were fought {{along the line}} as the German advance began to reach the Australians. On 30 March a serious attempt at penetrating the line around Sailly-Laurette was held and broken up by the 11th Brigade, with German losses being assessed at around {{one and a half}} brigades, or roughly between 3 and 4,000 men. On 6 April further attempts were made and in the confusion the charges that had been placed on the Bouzencourt Bridge were fired and it was <b>dropped</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Somme Canal. Nevertheless, the attempt was beaten off by the 10th Brigade. Following this the Australians were able to begin taking the initiative and throughout May they began to slowly recapture some of the ground that had been lost earlier as they undertook a series of peaceful penetration operations.|$|E
