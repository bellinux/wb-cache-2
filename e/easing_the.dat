Michael awkwardly tries his hand at karaoke but Jim then joins in, <b>easing</b> <b>the</b> tension considerably. The {{documentary}} crew catches Angela and Dwight making out in Jim's backyard.|$|E
5|$|Despite the accident, a {{pre-production}} {{batch of}} ten aircraft was ordered on 27 July 1945 {{as it was}} felt that mixed-power aircraft would be of some use <b>easing</b> <b>the</b> transition of pilots from piston-engine fighters to jet-engined ones. At the same time Sukhoi's Su-5 was cancelled as it was judged inferior to the I-250.|$|E
5|$|Another {{factor was}} the weather within the {{operational}} theater. The cyclical monsoon patterns {{meant that the}} weather was deplorable for flight operations eight {{months of the year}} (from late September to early May) when rain and fog tended to conceal targets. Lack of adequate all-weather and night-bombing capability made it necessary for the majority of U.S. missions to be conducted during daylight hours, thereby <b>easing</b> <b>the</b> burden on the air defense forces of North Vietnam.|$|E

5|$|Ford {{continued}} the détente policy {{with both the}} Soviet Union and China, <b>easing</b> <b>the</b> tensions of the Cold War. Still in place from the Nixon Administration was the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty (SALT). The thawing relationship brought about by Nixon's visit to China was reinforced by Ford's December 1975 visit to that communist country. In 1975, the Administration entered into the Helsinki Accords with the Soviet Union, creating {{the framework of the}} Helsinki Watch, an independent non-governmental organization created to monitor compliance that later evolved into Human Rights Watch.|$|E
5|$|Recognising their {{financial}} predicament, the LNC lobbied Parliament {{for a new}} Act of Parliament to allow the venture to survive. On 23 July 1855 the London Necropolis & National Mausoleum Amendment Act 1855 received Royal Assent. This Act released the LNC from those compulsory purchases of land which had been mandated by the 1852 Act but {{had not yet been}} completed, <b>easing</b> <b>the</b> immediate financial burden. It also allowed a ten-year window for the LNC to sell certain parts of the land bought from Lord Onslow which were not required for the cemetery, to provide a source of income.|$|E
5|$|Although {{assembled}} in the United States, the UK's Phantoms were a special batch built separately and containing {{a significant amount of}} British technology as a means of <b>easing</b> <b>the</b> pressure on the domestic aerospace industry in the wake of major project cancellations. Two variants were initially built for the UK: the F-4K variant was designed from the outset as an air defence interceptor to be operated by the Fleet Air Arm from the Royal Navy's aircraft carriers; the F-4M version was procured for the RAF to serve in the tactical strike and reconnaissance roles. In the mid-1980s, a third Phantom variant was obtained when a quantity of second-hand F-4J aircraft were purchased to augment the UK's air defences following the Falklands War.|$|E

5|$|Henry {{responded by}} {{mounting}} campaigns against the rebel barons and deepening his alliance with Theobald. Baldwin of Flanders {{was wounded in}} battle and died in September 1118, <b>easing</b> <b>the</b> pressure on Normandy from the north-east. Henry attempted to crush a revolt {{in the city of}} Alençon, but was defeated by Fulk and the Angevin army. Forced to retreat from Alençon, Henry's position deteriorated alarmingly, as his resources became overstretched and more barons abandoned his cause. Early in 1119, Eustace of Breteuil and Henry's daughter, Juliana, threatened to join the baronial revolt. Hostages were exchanged in a bid to avoid conflict, but relations broke down and both sides mutilated their captives. Henry attacked and took the town of Breteuil, despite Juliana's attempt to kill her father with a crossbow. In the aftermath, Henry dispossessed the couple of almost all of their lands in Normandy.|$|E
5|$|Although the U.S. {{administration}} has denied that devaluing their currency {{was part of}} their objectives for implementing quantitative <b>easing,</b> <b>the</b> practice can act to devalue a country's currency in two indirect ways. Firstly, it can encourage speculators to bet that the currency will decline in value. Secondly, the large increase in the domestic money supply will lower domestic interest rates, often they will become much lower than interest rates in countries not practising quantitative easing. This creates the conditions for a carry trade, where market participants can engage in a form of arbitrage, borrowing in the currency of the country practising quantitative easing, and lending {{in a country with}} a relatively high rate of interest. Because they are effectively selling the currency being used for quantitative easing on the international markets, this can increase the supply of the currency and hence push down its value. By October 2010 expectations in the markets were high that the United States, UK, and Japan would soon embark on a second round of QE, with the prospects for the Eurozone to join them less certain.|$|E
5|$|Despite Shinwell's actions {{the fuel}} supply {{remained}} insufficient and blackouts occurred across large swathes of the country, forcing even {{the staff at}} Buckingham Palace, the Houses of Parliament and London's Central Electricity Board to work by candlelight. A trade meeting with representatives from Russia and Iceland was also held without light or heating; one of the items discussed was the purchase of coal from Britain. The public was reduced to queuing at gasworks to collect coke for use as fuel. Supplies of aspirin also ran low {{as it was then}} a product of coal-tar, thousands of chickens in poultry farms died of the cold, and public transport services were cut to save fuel. Shinwell became increasingly unpopular with the general public and received a bomb threat, after which a four-man police guard was stationed at his house in Tooting. Despite this, he remained very popular with the miners, which made the government wary of dismissing him in case it caused industrial action. By 27February sea conditions had improved and more than 100 coal ships had managed to unload their cargoes at the power stations, <b>easing</b> <b>the</b> fuel crisis.|$|E

5|$|James Bennett McCreary (July 8, 1838 – October 8, 1918) was an American {{lawyer and}} {{politician}} from the US state of Kentucky. He represented {{the state in}} both houses of the U.S. Congress and served as its 27th and 37th governor. Shortly after graduating from law school, he was commissioned as the only major in the 11th Kentucky Cavalry, serving under Confederate Brigadier General John Hunt Morgan during the American Civil War. He returned to his legal practice after the war. In 1869, {{he was elected to the}} Kentucky House of Representatives where he served until 1875; he was twice chosen Speaker of the House. At their 1875 nominating convention, state Democrats chose McCreary as their nominee for governor, and he won an easy victory over Republican John Marshall Harlan. With the state still feeling the effects of the Panic of 1873, most of McCreary's actions as governor were aimed at <b>easing</b> <b>the</b> plight of the state's poor farmers.|$|E
5|$|The {{new town}} of Caernarfon was {{populated}} by English settlers, particularly from nearby Cheshire and Lancashire, {{and the town}} walls were in part designed to encourage immigrants and royal officials to settle there in safety. The town of Caernarfon did not prove a successful settlement, however; by 1298 it had only 59 burgage tenementsproperties paying rent to the kingmaking it far less prosperous than either neighbouring Conwy or Beaumaris, and the situation did not improve during the 14th century. In 1400 Welsh prince Owain Glyndŵr rose in rebellion against English rule, but despite attempts to take Caernarfon in 1403 and 1404, the town's defences held out. The ascension of the Tudor dynasty to the English throne resulted in {{a change in the}} way Wales was administered. The Tudors were Welsh in origin, and their rule lessened hostilities between the Welsh and English, reducing the need to maintain Caernarfon's castle and walls and <b>easing</b> <b>the</b> restrictions on Welsh access to the townthe Welsh were finally allowed to live inside Caernarfon in 1507.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970–71 NBA season, the Lakers made {{a notable}} move by signing future Hall-of-Fame guard Gail Goodrich, who {{came back from}} the Phoenix Suns after playing for L.A. until 1968. Chamberlain {{averaged}} 20.7 points, 18.2 rebounds and 4.3 assists, once again led the NBA in rebounding and the Lakers won the Pacific Division title. After losing Elgin Baylor to an Achilles tendon rupture that effectively ended his career, and especially after losing Jerry West after a knee injury, the handicapped Lakers were seen as underdogs against the Milwaukee Bucks of freshly crowned MVP Lew Alcindor, and veteran Hall-of-Fame guard Oscar Robertson in the Western Conference Finals. Winning the regular season with 66 wins, the Bucks were seen as favourites against the depleted Lakers; still, many pundits were looking forward to the matchup between the 34-year-old Chamberlain and the 24-year-old Alcindor. In Game 1, Abdul-Jabbar outscored Chamberlain 32–22, and the Bucks won 106–85. In Game 2, the Bucks won again despite the Lakers center scoring 26 points, four more than his Milwaukee counterpart. Prior to Game 3, things became even worse for the Lakers when Keith Erickson, West's stand-in, had an appendectomy and was out for the season; with rookie Jim McMillian <b>easing</b> <b>the</b> scoring pressure, Chamberlain scored 24 points and grabbed 24 rebounds in a 118–107 victory, but the Bucks defeated the Lakers 117–94 in Game 4 to take a 3–1 series lead. Milwaukee closed out the series at home with a 116–98 victory in Game 5. Although Chamberlain lost, he was lauded for holding his own against MVP Alcindor, who was not only 10 years younger, but healthy.|$|E
