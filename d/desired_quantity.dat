Polyethelene bladders of 1 gallon (4.5 litres) were put into corrugated boxes for sale to consumers.

50|$|One {{problem with}} such {{composite}} fish culture {{is that many}} of these fish breed only during monsoon. Even if fish are collected from the wild, they can be mixed with other species, as well. So, a major problem in fish farming is the lack of availability of good-quality stock. To overcome this problem, ways have now been worked out to breed these fish in ponds using hormonal stimulation. This has ensured the supply of pure fish stock in <b>desired</b> <b>quantities.</b>|$|R

50|$|Measurements in {{scientific}} work are also usually accompanied by estimates of their uncertainty. The uncertainty is often estimated by making repeated {{measurements of the}} <b>desired</b> <b>quantity.</b> Uncertainties may also be calculated by consideration of the uncertainties of the individual underlying quantities used. Counts of things, such {{as the number of}} people in a nation at a particular time, may also have an uncertainty due to data collection limitations.

50|$|In {{more general}} use, a {{calibration}} curve is a curve or {{table for a}} measuring instrument which measures some parameter indirectly, giving values for the <b>desired</b> <b>quantity</b> {{as a function of}} values of sensor output. For example, a calibration curve can be made for a particular pressure transducer to determine applied pressure from transducer output (a voltage). Such a curve is typically used when an instrument uses a sensor whose calibration varies from one sample to another, or changes with time or use; if sensor output is consistent the instrument would be marked directly in terms of the measured unit.|$|E
50|$|An {{hydraulic}} tanker is an {{oil tanker}} designed to use water as an incompressible fluid for {{loading and unloading}} petroleum cargo. Each cargo tank is kept full at all times so oil floating on water will be pressed against {{the top of the}} tank. A cargo tank initially filled with water is loaded with the <b>desired</b> <b>quantity</b> of oil by pumping oil into the top of the tank displacing water which overflows through an opening {{at the bottom of the}} tank. The cargo tank is unloaded by removing oil from the top of the tank as water is admitted at the bottom.|$|E

50|$|By mid-1983 Yankee Group {{estimated}} that ten new IBM PC-related products appeared every day. In August 1983 the Chess IBU, with 4,000 employees, became the Entry Systems Division, which observers believed {{indicated that the}} PC was significantly important to IBM overall, and no longer an experiment. The PC surpassed the Apple II as the best-selling personal computer with more than 750,000 sold {{by the end of}} the year, while DEC only sold 69,000 microcomputers in the first nine months of the year despite offering three models for different markets. Retailers also benefited, with 65% of BusinessLand's revenue coming from the PC. Demand still so exceeded supply two years after its debut that, despite IBM shipping 40,000 PCs a month, dealers reportedly received 60% or less of their <b>desired</b> <b>quantity.</b> Pournelle received the PC he paid for in early July 1983 on 1 November, and IBM Boca Raton employees and neighbors had to wait five weeks to buy the computers assembled there.|$|E
50|$|The ink {{fountain}} holds {{a pool of}} ink and controls the amount of ink that enters the inking system. The {{most common type of}} fountain consists of a metal blade that is held in place near the fountain roller. The gap between the blade and the {{ink fountain}} roller can be controlled by adjusting screw keys to vary the amount of ink on the fountain roller. The printer adjusts the keys in or out as the ink fountain roller turns to obtain the <b>desired</b> <b>quantity</b> of ink. In simple presses, the printer must turn these screws by hand. In modern presses, the adjusting screws are moved by servomotors which are controlled by the printer at a press console. Thus the printer can make ink adjustments electronically. If the printer needs to increase or decrease ink in an area of the plate (print), he need only adjust the needed keys to allow more or less ink flow through the blade. The ink flow can also be controlled by the rotation velocity of the ink fountain roller.|$|E
40|$|In {{engineering}} applications, {{we need to}} {{make decisions}} under uncertainty. Traditionally, in engineering, statistical methods are used, methods assuming that we know the probability distribution of different uncertain parameters. Usually, we can safely linearize the dependence of the <b>desired</b> <b>quantities</b> y (e. g., stress at different structural points) on the uncertain parameters xi - thus enabling sensitivity analysis. Often, the number n of uncertain parameters is huge, so sensitivity analysis leads to a lot of computation time.

50|$|A modern wad {{consists}} of three parts, the powder wad, the cushion, and the shot cup, which may be separate pieces or be one part. The powder wad acts as the gas seal (known as obturation), and is placed firmly over the powder; {{it may be a}} paper or plastic part. The cushion comes next, and it is designed to compress under pressure, to act as a shock absorber and minimize the deformation of the shot; it also serves to take up as much space as is needed between the powder wad and the shot. Cushions are almost universally made of plastic with crumple zones, although for game shooting in areas grazed by farm stock or wildlife biodegradable fibre wads are often preferred. The shot cup is {{the last part of the}} shell, and it serves to hold the shot together as it moves down the barrel. Shot cups have slits on the sides so that they peel open after leaving the barrel, allowing the shot to continue on in flight undisturbed. Shot cups, where used, are also almost universally plastic. The shot fills the shot cup (which must be of the correct length to hold the <b>desired</b> <b>quantity</b> of shot), and the shotgun shell is then crimped, or rolled closed.|$|E
5000|$|The {{bandwidth}} {{characteristics of}} a resonant antenna element can be characterized according to its Q, just as one uses to characterize the sharpness of an L-C resonant circuit. A common mistake is to assume {{that there is an}} advantage in an antenna having a high Q (the so-called [...] "quality factor"). In the context of electronic circuitry a low Q generally signifies greater loss (due to unwanted resistance) in a resonant L-C circuit, and poorer receiver selectivity. However this understanding does not apply to resonant antennas where the resistance involved is the radiation resistance, a <b>desired</b> <b>quantity</b> which removes energy from the resonant element in order to radiate it (the purpose of an antenna, after all!). The Q of an L-C-R circuit is defined as the ratio of the inductor's (or capacitor's) reactance to the resistance, so for a certain radiation resistance (the radiation resistance at resonance does not vary greatly with diameter) the greater reactance off-resonance causes the poorer bandwidth of an antenna employing a very thin conductor. The Q of such a narrowband antenna can be as high as 15. On the other hand, the reactance at the same off-resonant frequency of one using thick elements is much less, consequently resulting in a Q as low as 5. These two antennas may perform equivalently at the resonant frequency, but the second antenna will perform over a bandwidth 3 times as wide as the antenna consisting of a thin conductor.|$|E
