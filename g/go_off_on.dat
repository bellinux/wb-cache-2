5|$|Jet Force Gemini {{revolves}} around the Jet Force Gemini team attempting to defeat the dark insectoid tyrant Mizar and his horde of drones. The team is composed of Juno, Vela, and their wardog mascot Lupus. The game begins with the three characters in orbit around the planet Goldwood after barely escaping {{the destruction of the}} entire Jet Force fleet at the hands of Mizar, who has been capturing and enslaving a race of survivors known as the Tribals. When Juno, Vela and Lupus are attacked by several drones, the three decide to abandon their ship and <b>go</b> <b>off</b> <b>on</b> their own separate paths to stop the invasion. Ultimately, the heroes find themselves reunited at Mizar's Palace and face to face with Mizar, who escapes to a nearby asteroid where he sets course to impact with Earth. To help the heroes, Tribals leader King Jeff provides them with an ancient starship that can quickly catch up to Mizar's asteroid. In return, the team must rescue all the Tribals throughout the galaxy.|$|E
5|$|Mulder goes {{to visit}} Madame Zirinka again, who {{tells him that}} the planets come into {{alignment}} like this only once every 84 years, and additional alignments will cause anyone born on January 12, 1979 (Margi and Terri's birthdate) {{to have all the}} energy in the cosmos focused on them. Margi goes to see Scott alone but an angry Terri arrives. The two argue with each other and end up accidentally killing Scott. Margi goes to Mulder, telling him that Terri is responsible for the murders, while Terri goes to see Scully and tells her the opposite. The agents call each other and bring both girls to the police station, where the place starts shaking and all the guns <b>go</b> <b>off</b> <b>on</b> their own. Mulder locks the girls in a room together and their power goes away once the clock ticks midnight. When the town mob and Detective White finally see Terri and Margi as the culprits, Spitz claims it was the work of Satan, oblivious to the cosmic alignment's energy. Mulder and Scully drive home, arguing again over directions; when Scully defiantly runs a stop sign, Mulder notifies her but she tells him to shut up, which he does.|$|E
5|$|The vampires include: the Fool (voiced by Ron Funches), the Empress Eyes (voiced by Rebecca Romijn), the Hierophant (voiced by Paul Williams), the Moon (voiced by Beau Billingslea), and the Vampire King himself (voiced by Billy Brown). The vampires are {{surprised}} {{that they are}} alive again, but quickly disagree {{on what to do}} next and <b>go</b> <b>off</b> <b>on</b> their separate ways. Witnessing this, Jake warns Finn and Marceline. Upon realizing the Vampire King is alive again, Marceline flashes back to her previous battle with him. In order to preserve the vampire race, the Vampire King sacrificed himself to bite Marceline, making her the last vampire. Marceline manages to track down and confront the resurrected Vampire King, killing the Fool and reabsorbing his power of flight. However, before she can battle the still weak Vampire King, he warns her that the Empress is headed for the Ice Kingdom. Fearing {{for the safety of the}} Ice King (voiced by Tom Kenny), Marceline gives chase. The Empress arrives at the Ice Kingdom and uses her powers to hypnotize the Ice King, ordering him to bring her the blood of Finn. Marceline attempts to attack the Empress right as the Ice King returns with a captured Finn. Finn escapes, and the Empress orders Ice King to capture them. In an attempt to jog the Ice King's memory, Marceline tells him that she was motivated to start hunting vampires when she killed one trying to attack a human family. However, it's revealed that the Ice King was never hypnotized by the Empress, but merely acting as he always does around women. Marceline then attacks the Empress, but the Empress quickly gains the upper hand until she is paralyzed by a special gun Bubblegum developed. Marceline kills the Empress and reabsorbs her power of invisibility. She then apologizes to her friends for trying to fight the vampires alone and tells them they will hunt the remaining vampires together.|$|E

25|$|The {{squadron}} {{consisted of}} three vessels, Butterworth, a full-rigged ship that four or six {{times the size of}} the two sloops that accompanied her. The role of each of the two sloops, Jackal and Prince Lee Boo, was to act as a ship's tender, to scout ahead in shallower waters, or to <b>go</b> <b>off</b> <b>on</b> errands. A man named Priestly owned both sloops.|$|E
25|$|Rogers was an idol {{for many}} {{children}} through his films and television shows. Most of his postwar films were in Trucolor during {{an era when}} almost all other B westerns were black and white. Some of his movies would segue into animal adventures, in which Rogers's horse, Trigger, would <b>go</b> <b>off</b> <b>on</b> his own for a while with the camera following him.|$|E
25|$|On 14 July 2008, {{a caller}} rang up the police main control room around 1030 hrs and {{informed}} about bombs placed at Secunderabad railway station, passport office, Swathi tiffin centre and a bus stop, all {{within the limits}} of Secunderabad. Between 1 pm to 1:15 p.m of 15 July four smoke bombs were said to be about to <b>go</b> <b>off</b> <b>on</b> platforms one, six and seven. The railway authorities immediately alerted the EMRI 108 service, but nothing happened on that day.|$|E

25|$|Most Danes {{are active}} cyclists, often using their bikes to commute {{to work or}} to <b>go</b> <b>off</b> <b>on</b> trips at the weekend. With its well-engineered cycle paths, Copenhagen is {{especially}} suited to city cycling. Every day 1.3 million km are cycled in the city, with 36% of all citizens commuting to work, school or university by bicycle. Cycling is generally perceived as a healthier, environmentally friendlier, cheaper and often quicker way around town than by public transport or car and it is therefore municipal policy {{for the number of}} commuters by bike to go up to 40% by 2012 and 50% by 2015.|$|E
25|$|Among Native Hawaiians, {{the goal}} of {{learning}} is to transform participation to encompass conscientious accountability as active contributing members of the community, like that found in LOPI. For example, in some Native Hawaiian communities, parent(s) teach the older siblings the necessary skills of care taking. Sibling care-taking skills can relate to Indigenous American ways of learning by the children becoming considerate of their parents and taking on the responsibility when needed {{in case of a}} tragic incident with the parents. Within the classroom and home settings, adults are present but are not always directly monitoring the children. Children ask for help when necessary, but adults appear to rarely interject. Children appeared to adapt to tasks and situations by observations and <b>go</b> <b>off</b> <b>on</b> their own to collectively work out how and what to do to complete the task.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, Coach McGuirk {{volunteers to}} {{assemble}} Paula's large and complicated new grill, but he {{proves to be}} both incredibly inexperienced and largely incompetent at performing such a task. When McGuirk believes that he has finally completed the grill, he gathers Paula and the three kids together to witness its first ignition, but he ultimately causes a large explosion. The five <b>go</b> <b>off</b> <b>on</b> a drive, covered in soot, and Brendon accidentally drops his camera on the road, where it is {{run over by a}} car. He groans [...] "oh no," [...] and almost begins to tell the others about what had just happened, but ends up getting drawn into a conversation about where to go for dinner.|$|E

500|$|American metalcore band, Memphis May Fire {{covered the}} track for the {{compilation}} album Punk Goes Pop 5, which {{was released on}} November 6, 2012. The song was officially released for digital download on October 2, 2012. In order to celebrate its fifteen years in the music industry, Dutch symphonic rock band, Within Temptation covered several songs by other artists, including [...] "Grenade", during a special program on the Belgian radio station Q music, called Within Temptation Friday. The band chose this song because [...] "It's a really good song and instead of making a grenade <b>go</b> <b>off</b> <b>on</b> stage, we figured we’d make a bomb of astonishment go off in the studio", {{in the words of}} the lead vocalist Sharon den Adel. On April 19, 2013 Within Temptation's cover was released and available for download as part of their cover album The Q-Music Sessions. Nevertheless, the song peaked at number 73, in their home country, on the Dutch Charts.|$|E
500|$|The {{story was}} {{originally}} pitched by Hannah Louise Shearer and Deborah Dean Davis, {{who were also}} given the job of developing the script. The writing of the episode suffered from {{the timing of the}} 1988 Writers Guild of America strike, with Shearer and Dean Davis completing the script in five days. The premise of the story was a combination of their idea of a story [...] "about a professor whose work wasn't appreciated and had to <b>go</b> <b>off</b> <b>on</b> his own" [...] and that of Maurice Hurley who wanted a story with a time anomaly. The final draft was dated 22 February and featured numerous differences from the filmed version, including Jenice being called Laura, a number of different interactions for the crew, and Riker, Worf and Data all being involved in shutting down Manheim's equipment. The script was finalised a week before the episode was filmed, but the writers strike caused further issues when it was discovered during filming that the scene where Data was to fix the time distortions hadn't been completed.|$|E
500|$|Not all reviews were positive. George Avalos and Michael Liedtke of the Knight Ridder Tribune {{wrote that}} the episode's slug [...] "continued the series' fine {{tradition}} of monsters that made us queasy as we squirmed in our seats". Despite enjoying the gore {{and the reality of}} Scully's isolation, the two were critical of the cult's motivations, writing that [...] "we were given absolutely no clue as to why the Utah cult members believed the slug represented the Second Coming of Jesus Christ." [...] The two ultimately concluded that [...] "Roadrunners" [...] fell [...] "well short of a classic." [...] Sarah Stegall highly criticized the episode, calling it [...] "a bad mix of The Fly and , with plenty of X-Files classic paranoia but none of the finesse we've seen before." [...] Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a scathing review and awarded it no stars out of four. She heavily derided the plot, sarcastically referring to Doggett as a [...] "man's man" [...] and the parasite a [...] "phallic-shaped giant slug". Furthermore, she criticized Scully's actions to <b>go</b> <b>off</b> <b>on</b> an assignment without telling her partner. Dave Golder from SFX criticized the episode and called it a retread of the first season episode [...] "Ice".|$|E

500|$|Six months later, {{a race of}} villainous robots {{known as}} the Metarex attempt to steal the Emeralds from Sonic, but he {{scatters}} them across the galaxy. Meanwhile, on Earth, where six years have passed and Chris is now eighteen, Chris builds another device {{to return to his}} friends' world; he is twelve again when he arrives. A sick plant-like girl named Cosmo lands on their planet and they nurse her back to health, so she joins them, and they all board Tails' new spaceship, the Blue Typhoon. On the Typhoon, they scour the galaxy for the Emeralds and [...] "Planet Eggs" [...] (objects that allow life to flourish on planets, which the Metarex have stolen to depopulate the galaxy) and fight the Metarex at every turn. Along the way, Tails and Cosmo slowly fall in love with each other. Rouge finds Shadow alive in a capsule on Eggman's ship and he is later released (though he has lost his memory.) [...] At first, he and Rouge assist Eggman (even saving Chris on one occasion) but after Shadow witnesses the death of resistance fighter who reminded him of Maria, both he and Rouge <b>go</b> <b>off</b> <b>on</b> their own to fight the Metered independently. Eggman eventually joins the Metarex though this is a ruse to gather more information. After discovering the origins, methods, and goals of the Metarex, Shadow reappears and tries to kill Cosmo, much to Tails' anger. The Metarex's leader, Dark Oak, appears and reveals that the Metarex and Cosmo are of the same species and that they secretly implanted a tracking device in her brain while extinguishing the rest of their kind; she has been an unwitting spy ever since. It was for this reason Shadow wanted Cosmo dead. Chris, Knuckles, and Tails notice that removing the device will likely destroy her sight and hearing forever. Knuckles pushes for it to be removed anyway (In the Japanese version he stresses {{to find a way to}} remove it without damaging her), but Tails can't make any decisions at the present time so the surgery is called off and the battle against the Metarex continues.|$|E
2500|$|... 'Mad' {{provides}} a pretty concise focus {{on only one}} story.

'Mad' isn’t the most inspired tale, but it does fine for itself." ...|$|E

During this period Stieglitz and O'Keeffe continued to live together, although she would <b>go</b> <b>off</b> <b>on</b> her own {{from time to time to}} create art.

2500|$|In January 1993, he {{returned}} to BBC Radio 2, replacing Brian Hayes to present the breakfast show, then called Wake Up to Wogan. His tendency to <b>go</b> <b>off</b> <b>on</b> rambling, esoteric tangents, often including banter with his then producer, Paul Walters, became popular with both younger and older listeners. Much of the entertainment came from letters and emails sent in by listeners, many of whom adopted punning pseudonyms. One occasion involved Wogan reading out an email from someone using the name [...] "Tess Tickles", without realising what the name was referring to, prompting Paul Walters' standard reply in such situations – [...] "I only print 'em!" ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{short-range}} radios were reasonably {{light and}} very reliable; most importantly they {{were easy to}} use. In most cases headsets were not the first choice; a telehand was just tied to a shoulder strap. An extremely efficient form of radio speech known as [...] "voice procedure" [...] was used. Troopers were {{expected to have a}} high degree of self-initiative and reliance; case in point, if a stop-commander desired, the two riflemen would be detached to perform a mini-sweep or stop position of their own (and perhaps even an individual <b>go</b> <b>off</b> <b>on</b> his own). The introduction of the second radio in 1979 merely confirmed this practice.|$|E
2500|$|According to Hutchence, [...] "Most of {{the songs}} on Underneath the Colours were written in a {{relatively}} short space of time. Most bands shudder at the prospect of having 20 years to write their first album and four days to write their second. For us, though, it was good. It left less room for us to <b>go</b> <b>off</b> <b>on</b> all sorts of tangents". Soon after recording sessions for Underneath the Colours – produced by Richard Clapton – had finished, band members started work on outside projects. Hutchence recorded [...] "Speed Kills", written by Don Walker of hard rockers Cold Chisel, for the Freedom (1982) film soundtrack, directed by Scott Hicks. It was Hutchence's first solo single and was released by WEA in early 1982.|$|E
