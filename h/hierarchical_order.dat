25|$|Traditionally, DGs {{have had}} a {{different}} approach to linear order (word order) than constituency grammars. Dependency-based structures are minimal compared to their constituency-based counterparts, and these minimal structures allow one to focus intently on the two ordering dimensions. Separating the vertical dimension (<b>hierarchical</b> <b>order)</b> from the horizontal dimension (linear order) is easily accomplished. This aspect of dependency-based structures has allowed DGs, starting with Tesnière (1959), to focus on <b>hierarchical</b> <b>order</b> {{in a manner that is}} hardly possible for constituency grammars. For Tesnière, linear order was secondary to <b>hierarchical</b> <b>order</b> insofar as <b>hierarchical</b> <b>order</b> preceded linear order in the mind of a speaker. The stemmas (trees) that Tesnière produced reflected this view; they abstracted away from linear order to focus almost entirely on <b>hierarchical</b> <b>order.</b> Many DGs that followed Tesnière adopted this practice, that is, they produced tree structures that reflect <b>hierarchical</b> <b>order</b> alone, e.g.|$|E
25|$|The {{traditional}} {{focus on}} <b>hierarchical</b> <b>order</b> generated {{the impression that}} DGs have little to say about linear order, and it {{has contributed to the}} view that DGs are particularly well-suited to examine languages with free word order. A negative result of this focus on <b>hierarchical</b> <b>order,</b> however, {{is that there is a}} dearth of dependency-based explorations of particular word order phenomena, such as of standard discontinuities. Comprehensive dependency grammar accounts of topicalization, wh-fronting, scrambling, and extraposition are mostly absent from many established dependency-based frameworks. This situation can be contrasted with constituency grammars, which have devoted tremendous effort to exploring these phenomena.|$|E

Incomplete ordered partitions and coverings are often used in expert information analysis. These structures should be useful when an expert has to classify elements of a set into given classes, but referring to several elements {{he does not know}} to which classes they should belong. The <b>hierarchical</b> <b>ordered</b> partition is a more general structure than incomplete ordered partition. In this chapter we present definitions of the notion of <b>hierarchical</b> incomplete <b>ordered</b> partitions and coverings of sets. The distance functions between <b>hierarchical</b> incomplete <b>ordered</b> partitions and coverings are defined. We present also algorithms of consensus determining for a finite set of <b>hierarchical</b> incomplete <b>ordered</b> partitions and coverings...|$|R

25|$|The {{representations}} in (a–d) are trees, {{whereby the}} specific conventions employed in each tree vary. Solid lines are dependency edges and lightly dotted lines are projection lines. The {{only difference between}} tree (a) and tree (b) is that tree (a) employs the category class to label the nodes whereas tree (b) employs the words themselves as the node labels. Tree (c) is a reduced tree insofar as the string of words below and projection lines are deemed unnecessary and are hence omitted. Tree (d) abstracts away from linear order and reflects just <b>hierarchical</b> <b>order.</b> The arrow arcs in (e) are an alternative convention used to show dependencies and are favored by Word Grammar. The brackets in (f) are seldom used, but are nevertheless quite capable of reflecting the dependency hierarchy; dependents appear enclosed in more brackets than their heads. And finally, the indentations like those in (g) are another convention that is sometimes employed to indicate the hierarchy of words. Dependents are placed underneath their heads and indented. Like tree (d), the indentations in (g) abstract away from linear order.|$|E

The Motor-Free Visual Perception Test-Revised (MVPT-R) {{is one of the}} most frequently used tests with school-age children even though its construct validity has not been thoroughly evaluated. Aim/Purpose: The purpose of the study was to evaluate the scalability/interval level measurement, unidimensionality, lack of differential item functioning (DIF), and <b>hierarchical</b> <b>ordering</b> of items of the MVPT-R. Method: The visual perceptual performance scores from a sample of 356 normally developing children (171 boys and 185 girls) ranging in age from 5 to 11 years were used to complete a Rasch Measurement Model (RMM) analysis of the MVPT-R. Results: When the MVPT-R was analyzed using the RMM, it exhibited adequate measurement properties (scalability/interval level measurement, unidimensionality, lack of DIF, and <b>hierarchical</b> <b>ordering).</b> However, many MVPT-R scale items exhibited RMM misfit or DIF. Conclusion: The construct validity, scalability, <b>hierarchical</b> <b>ordering,</b> and lack of DIF requirements were met by the final version of the of the MVPT-R scale. However, given the fact that a number of items exhibited RMM misfit or DIF, clinicians need to take this into consideration when using the MVPT-R in its current form...|$|R

25|$|Another rather strange {{chapter of}} nineteenth century science that is {{relevant}} {{with regard to}} Egyptomania is Craniology, {{the study of the}} human cranium that claimed to be able to determine an individual's intelligence and even character.

Craniology was especially important with regard of the question, whether Egyptians were black or white, a debate lead in light of the justification of slavery. The key figure for this period seems to be Samuel George Morton who founded the American School of Ethnology. He put forward the theory of Polygenesis claiming that there is not one but several human races who are in a <b>hierarchical</b> <b>order</b> with whites at the top and blacks at the bottom end of the scale.

25|$|Interactions of cMyBP-C {{with its}} binding {{partners}} vary with its posttranslational modification status. At least three extensively characterized phosphorylation sites (Ser273, 282 and 302; numbering {{refers to the}} mouse sequence) are localized in the M motif of cMyBP-C and are targeted by protein kinases in a <b>hierarchical</b> <b>order</b> of events. In its dephosphorylated state, cMyBP-C binds predominantly to myosin S2 and brakes crossbridge formation, however, when phosphorylated in response to β-adrenergic stimulation through activating cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), it favours binding to actin, then accelerating crossbridge formation, enhancing force development and promoting relaxation. Protein kinases identified thus far to phosphorylate cMyBP-C in the M motif are PKA, Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII), ribosomal s6 kinase (RSK),protein kinase D (PKD), and protein kinase C (PKC). Furthermore, GSK3β was described as another protein kinase to phosphorylate cMyBP-C outside the M-domain in the proline-alanine-rich actin-binding site at Ser133 in human myocardium (mouse Ser131). Phosphorylation is required for normal cardiac function and cMyBP-C stability, and overall phosphorylation levels of cMyBP-C are reduced in human and experimental heart failure. Other posttranslational modifications of cMyBP-C exist, which occur throughout the protein and are not thoroughly characterised yet, such as acetylation, citrullination, S-glutathiolation, S-nitrosylation and carbonylation.|$|E

30|$|The {{analysis}} revealed that past editing events have two distinct effects on future interaction among Wikipedians: on the frequency {{of events in the}} undirected dyad {A,B}, dyad and on the relative dominance of the directed dyad (A,B) over (B,A). The effects on the undirected dyads are often more consistent with structural balance theory according to which undo events and third-party edits may be interpreted as revealing negative ties. The effects on the directed dyads are often more consistent with a hierarchical interpretation. This finding is similar to that reported in Leskovec et al. (2010) in a study of voting behavior among Wikipedians. We also showed that the effect on the event frequency may obfuscate effects on the <b>hierarchical</b> <b>ordering.</b> This finding is similar to that reported in Lerner (2016) where effects on the interaction frequency were separated from effects influencing the sign of ties. The analysis in our paper also revealed that the three different types of events show different levels of consistency with the linear <b>hierarchical</b> <b>ordering</b> hypothesis. Most notably, third-party edits are the only type of event that is anti-reciprocal, irrespective of whether we control for a change in the interaction frequency. When third-party interventions are ignored, dyadic undo events are inconsistent with linear <b>hierarchical</b> <b>ordering.</b>|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND The {{statistical}} analysis of nasal provocation tests is very complex. We compared the conventional analysis with the maximally selected test statistics and the <b>hierarchical</b> <b>ordered</b> logistic model. METHODS We re-analyzed data from a trial with 112 patients suffering from grass pollen allergy. The patients had been randomized to receive either intralymphatic immunotherapy (ILIT) or subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT). RESULTS The conventional analysis indicated that the logarithmized ratio between the pre- and the post-treatment threshold concentration was significantly lower for ILIT than for SCIT. The maximally selected test statistics {{was used to test}} different threshold symptom scores that would imply positive clinical symptoms at the given allergen concentration. A threshold score of 3 maximised the difference in improvement between the ILIT and the SCIT groups. The <b>hierarchical</b> <b>ordered</b> logistic model does not take threshold allergen concentrations as the basis for analysis, but the single scores measured at each concentration. This approach simultaneously considers the treatment effect (ILIT versus SCIT), the time effect (pre- versus post-treatment), and the dose effect (different allergen concentrations). The <b>hierarchical</b> <b>ordered</b> logistic model revealed that the clinical improvement was greater after ILIT than after SCIT. CONCLUSION As the choice of method can affect the outcome, guidelines for analysis are highly needed...|$|R
40|$|Although {{numerous}} studies have examined habitat use by raccoons (Procyon lotor), information regarding seasonal habitat selection related to resource availability in agricultural landscapes is lacking for this species. Additionally, few studies using radiotelemetry have investigated habitat selection at multiple spatial scales or core-use areas by raccoons. We examined seasonal habitat selection of 55 (31 M, 24 F) adult raccoons at 3 <b>hierarchical</b> <b>orders</b> defined by the movement behavior of this species (second-order home range, second-order core-use area, and third-order home range) in northern Indiana, USA, from May 2003 to June 2005. Using compositional analysis, we assessed whether habitat selection differed from random and ranked habitat types in order of selection during the crop growing period (season 1) and corn maturation period (season 2), which represented substantial shifts in resource availability to raccoons. Habitat rankings differed across <b>hierarchical</b> <b>orders,</b> between seasons within <b>hierarchical</b> <b>orders,</b> and between sexes within seasons; however, seasonal and intersexual patterns of habitat selection were not consistent across <b>hierarchical</b> <b>orders</b> of spatial scale. When nonrandom utilization was detected, both sexes consistently selected forest cover over other available habitats. Seasonal differences in habitat selection were most evident at the core-area scale, where raccoon selection of agricultural lands was highest during the maturation season when corn was available as a direct food source. Habitat use {{did not differ from}} availability for either sex in either season at the third-order scale. The selection of forest cover across both seasons and all spatial orders suggested that raccoon distribution and abundance in fragmented landscapes is likely dependent on the availability and distribution of forest cover, or habitats associated with forest (i. e., water), within the landscape. The lack of consistency in habitat selection across hierarchical scales further exemplifies the need to examine multiple biological scales in habitat-selection studies...|$|R
