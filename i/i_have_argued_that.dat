6000|$|As to {{the second}} part of the book, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> the first dim surmises as to a Supreme Being need not have arisen (as on the current anthropological theory) in the notion of spirits at all. (See chapter xi.) Here I have been said to draw a mere [...] "verbal {{distinction}}" [...] but no distinction can be more essential. If such a Supreme Being as many savages acknowledge is not envisaged by them as a [...] "spirit," [...] then the theories and processes by which he is derived from a ghost of a dead man are invalid, and remote from the point. As to the origin of a belief in a kind of germinal Supreme Being (say the Australian Baiame), I do not, in this book, offer any opinion. I again and again decline to offer an opinion. Critics, none the less, have said that I attribute the belief to revelation! I shall therefore here indicate what I think probable in so obscure a field.|$|E

He argues that it is formed within the mass of cooled hydrogen drawn from the chromosphere into the vortex of the cyclone. Speaking of the cyclones he says:--"Dans leur embouchure évasée ils entraîneront l'hydrogène froid de la chromosphère, produisant partout sur leur trajet vertical un abaissement notable de température et une obscurité relative, due à l'opacité de l'hydrogène froid englouti." [...] (Revue Scientifique, 24 March 1883.) Considering the intense cold required to reduce hydrogen to the [...] "critical point," [...] it is a strong supposition that the motion given to it by fluid friction on entering the vortex of the cyclone, can produce a rotation, rarefaction, and cooling, great enough to produce precipitation in a region so intensely heated.] ...|$|E

5000|$|Paul Feyerabend {{argued that}} Lakatos's {{methodology}} {{was not a}} methodology at all, but merely [...] "words that sound like {{the elements of a}} methodology." [...] He argued that Lakatos's methodology was no different in practice from epistemological anarchism, Feyerabend's own position. He wrote in Science in a Free Society (after Lakatos's death) that: Lakatos realized and admitted that the existing standards of rationality, standards of logic included, were too restrictive and would have hindered science had they been applied with determination. He therefore permitted the scientist to violate them (he admits that science is not [...] "rational" [...] in the sense of these standards). However, he demanded that research programmes show certain features in the long run — they must be progressive.... <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> this demand no longer restricts scientific practice. Any development agrees with it. Lakatos and Feyerabend planned to produce a joint work in which Lakatos would develop a rationalist description of science and Feyerabend would attack it. The correspondence between Lakatos and Feyerabend, where the two discussed the project, has since been reproduced, with commentary, by Matteo Motterlini.|$|E

Perhaps we should put special efforts into helping those who start from a position of disadvantage, so that we end with a more egalitarian result.Second, the fact that the average IQ of one racial group is a few points higher than that of another does not allow anyone to say that all members of the higher IQ group have higher IQs... The point is that these figures are averages and say nothing about individuals...The third reason... is simply that, as we saw earlier, the principle of equality is not based on any actual equality that all people share. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> the only defensible basis for the principle of equality is equal consideration of interests... Equal status does not depend on intelligence. Racists who maintain the contrary are in peril of being forced to kneel before the next genius they encounter.|$|E

40|$|The {{thesis is}} an attempt to develop a {{speculative}} (Hegelian) critique of the ethical and political questions raised by Jean-Francois Lyotard's book The Differend. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> these questions are dependent upon the reading of Kant's three Critiques, and his political essays, which Lyotard develops in The Differend's four `notices' on Kant, and that it is this reading which opens up his concept of difference (`heterogeneity') to the possibility of a speculative critique. Chapter one comprises an examination of Lyotard's attempt to establish speculative thinking's dependence upon a metaphysical idea of the self as the possibility of ethical sublation. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> Lyotard's appropriation of Adorno's idea of "Auschwitz" as blocking dialectical sublation, fails to recognize the speculative significance of the concrete conditions which produced the historical emergence of Nazism. The following three chapters are concerned to develop the argument that Lyotard's misrepresentation of the spirituality of Hegel's philosophy, conditions his reading of the critical philosophy as disclosing the possibility of a spontaneous (ethical) judgement of difference. Chapter two argues that Lyotard's claim to show critical subjectivity to be a `litigation' of self-conscious faculties, fails to recognize the actual lack of unity which characterizes Kant's `transcendental unity of apperception'. The exclusion of `otherness', which Lyotard claims is disclosed and suppressed in Kant's notion of cognitive experience, actually necessitates concrete selfrecognition. In chapter three, Lyotard's attempt to abstract an ethical `obligation without conditions' from Kant's critical morality is interrogated. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> the aporias constituted through the spontaneity of practical reason, are reinforced through Lyotard's concept of `ethical time'. The final chapter develops a speculative approach to the notions of ethics and politics which Lyotard abstracts from the Third Critique. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> the notion of an `unpredetermined' judgement which Lyotard articulates in the final sections of The Differend, constitutes a subjective `culture' which is ultimately non-ethical and apolitical...|$|E

The Judge replied that the Constitution requires the suppression of the foreign slave trade, but does not require the prohibition of slavery in the Territories. That is a mistake in point of fact.
