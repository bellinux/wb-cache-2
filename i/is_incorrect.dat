5|$|The 1910 {{edition of}} St. Elmo by Hurst & Company is {{sometimes}} marked {{as having been}} drawn from a movie. This <b>is</b> <b>incorrect,</b> {{it was designed to}} appeal to theater patrons and copyrighted in January 1910. Another 1910 publication by M.A Donahue includes photographs marked as having been produced by Lawrence Co. of Chicago. It does not indicate that it is from the Thanhouser production.|$|E
5|$|The {{battle has}} been widely {{described}} as the largest tank engagement or battle in military history, involving 1,200–1,500 tanks and sometimes up to 2,000, but this <b>is</b> <b>incorrect</b> as the battle did not involve that many tanks. The exaggerated figures originated from erroneous Soviet intelligence estimates of German armour reported {{during and after the}} battle, and subsequent postwar accounts that furthered this erroneous narrative. Some of these Soviet estimates reported figures as high as 800 German tanks and assault guns attacking Prokhorovka on 12 July.|$|E

Consequently, Propositions 5. 1 and 6. 1 introduced in Bayoumi and Ibedou (2002) [2] <b>are</b> <b>incorrect.</b> In addition, one implication from Theorems 5. 1 and 6. 1, made in Bayoumi and Ibedou (2002) [2] <b>are</b> <b>incorrect.</b> We give some counterexamples to support our claim...|$|R
5|$|All {{but two of}} the Hydrobatidae {{are mostly}} dark in colour with varying amounts of white on the rump. Two species have {{different}} plumage entirely, the Hornby's storm petrel which has white undersides and facial markings, and the fork-tailed storm petrel which has pale grey plumage. This is a notoriously difficult group to identify at sea. Onley and Scofield (2007) state that much published information <b>is</b> <b>incorrect,</b> and that photographs in the major seabird books and websites are frequently incorrectly ascribed as to species. They also consider that several national bird lists include species which have been incorrectly identified or have been accepted on inadequate evidence.|$|E
5|$|Historians {{of science}} have noted that, while Darwin {{considered}} the ideas in Wallace's paper to be {{essentially the same}} as his own, there were differences. Darwin emphasised competition between individuals of the same species to survive and reproduce, whereas Wallace emphasised environmental pressures on varieties and species forcing them to become adapted to their local conditions, leading populations in different locations to diverge. Some historians, notably Peter J. Bowler, have suggested the possibility that in the paper he mailed to Darwin, Wallace was not discussing selection of individual variations at all but rather group selection. However, Malcolm Kottler has shown that this notion <b>is</b> <b>incorrect</b> and Wallace was indeed discussing individual variations.|$|E
5|$|The Brandenburg-class {{ships were}} the {{foundation}} of what eventually became the High Seas Fleet. As they represented {{a shift in the}} strategic outlook of the German navy, the traditional method of ship construction, which relied heavily on foreign models, was abandoned. Some experimentation was implemented in the design process, particularly in the armor types that were installed on the ships. Brandenburg and Wörth were equipped with compound armor that consisted of several layers of different materials, while the latter two ships received Harvey nickel-steel alloy armor plating. The addition of a third main battery turret was also a significant innovation. While a novel concept, the midships turret caused prohibitive blast damage to the surrounding superstructure when fired, which led to the idea being abandoned. This arrangement has led some authors to characterize the ships as proto-dreadnoughts. This <b>is</b> <b>incorrect,</b> as the guns were not of the same length, and the ships were designed to fight at close range, unlike the later dreadnought battleships.|$|E

5|$|The {{national}} emblem of Belarus, which replaced the historic Pahonia {{arms in a}} 1995 referendum, features a ribbon in the colours of the national flag, a map of Belarus, wheat ears and a red star. It is {{sometimes referred to as}} the coat of arms of Belarus, although this <b>is</b> <b>incorrect</b> {{due to the lack of}} several heraldic elements. The emblem is an allusion to one that was used by the Belorussian SSR, designed by Ivan Dubasov in 1950, with the biggest change being a replacement of the hammer and sickle with an outline map of Belarus. Emblems reminiscent of the times of the Soviet Union are also used in Macedonia, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and the region of Transnistria.|$|E
5|$|Warelwast went {{blind in}} his later years, {{starting}} in about 1120, which William of Malmesbury regarded as a fitting punishment for Warelwast's alleged attempts to remove his predecessor from office early. He died about 26 September 1137, and {{was buried in the}} priory at Plympton. He may have resigned his see prior to his death. The 16th-century antiquary John Leland thought that Warelwast resigned his see before 1127, became a canon at Plympton, and died in 1127. Although Leland's year of death <b>is</b> <b>incorrect,</b> it is possible that Warelwast became a canon shortly before his death. The Annales Plymptonienses records that Robert of Bath, the Bishop of Bath, gave Warelwast his last rites on 26 September 1137, and records that the dying bishop was made a member of the collegiate church at Plympton. Warelwast's nephew Robert Warelwast succeeded as Bishop at Exeter in 1138; Robert had been appointed archdeacon of Exeter by his uncle.|$|E
5|$|The {{first story}} is about the opening of Shiva's third eye when he visits Madurai, {{the capital city of}} the Pandya Kingdom, ruled at that time by Shenbagapandian. Shenbagapandian wants to find the answer to a {{question}} posed by his wife— whether the fragrance from a woman's hair is natural or artificial— and announces a reward of 1000gold coins to anyone who can come up with the answer. A poor poet named Dharumi desperately wants the reward and starts to break down in the Meenakshi Amman Temple. Shiva, hearing his cries, {{takes the form of a}} poet and gives Dharumi a poem containing the answer. Overjoyed, Dharumi takes the poem to Shenbagapandian's court and recites it, but Nakkeerar, the court's head poet, claims the poem's meaning <b>is</b> <b>incorrect.</b> On hearing this, Shiva argues with Nakkeerar about the poem's accuracy, burning him to ashes when he refuses to relent. Later, Shiva revives Nakkeerar, and says that he only wanted to test his knowledge. Nakkeerar asks the king to give the reward to Dharumi.|$|E
