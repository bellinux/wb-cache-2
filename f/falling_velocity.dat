40|$|A large {{proportion}} of solid material transported within the atmosphere during volcanic eruptions consists of particles less than 500 mum in diameter. The majority of these particles become incorporated into {{a wide range of}} aggregate types, the aerodynamic behaviour of which has not been determined by either direct observation or in the laboratory. In the absence of such data, theoretical models of fallout from volcanic plumes make necessarily crude assumptions about aggregate densities and <b>fall</b> <b>velocities.</b> Larger volcanic ejecta often consists of pumice of lower than bulk density. Experimental data are presented for the <b>fall</b> <b>velocities</b> of porous aggregates and single particles, determined in systems analogous to that of ejecta falling from a volcanic plume. It is demonstrated that the fall of aggregates may be modelled in identical fashion to single particles by using a reduced aggregate density dependent on the porosity, and a size corresponding to an enclosing sphere. Particles incorporated into aggregates attain a substantially higher <b>fall</b> <b>velocity</b> than single particles. This is due to the larger physical dimensions of the aggregate, which overcomes the effect of lower aggregate density. Additionally, the internal porosity of the aggregate allows some flow of fluid through the aggregate and this results in a small increase in <b>fall</b> <b>velocity.</b> The increase in <b>fall</b> <b>velocity</b> of particles incorporated into aggregates, rather than falling individually, results in the enhanced removal of fine material from volcanic plumes...|$|R

40|$|The {{current study}} aims to {{investigate}} the physical mechanisms controlling fine sediment transport within open channel shear flows over porous beds, with particular emphasis {{on the role of}} flow turbulence in particle settling and deposition processes. Preliminary visualisation experiments used a VHS camera to observe the near-bed motion of sand particles and their behaviour within the surface layer of a rhombically-packed bed of uniform spheres. Measurement of near-bed particle trajectories indicate that turbulent particle <b>fall</b> <b>velocities</b> w's are generally larger than <b>fall</b> <b>velocities</b> measured in still water ws, most notably for finer sand grades. Distinctive modes of particle behaviour observed at the bed interface also suggest that flow-separation eddies, generated within surface interstices, have a primary influence on subsequent particle motion, i. e. deposition or re-entrainment. Similar particle behaviour is also displayed in a natural gravel bed. A more detailed analysis of sand particle motion in turbulent open channel flow was carried out employing a high-speed camera and particle-tracking technique to record and analyse particle trajectories within different flow regions. The non-dimensional ratio of measured particle <b>fall</b> <b>velocity</b> w's and still water <b>fall</b> <b>velocity</b> ws was used to indicate the relative enhancement of vertical particle motion within the turbulent flow conditions. Experiment-averaged values of this ratio reveal that particle <b>fall</b> <b>velocities</b> are generally enhanced (i. e. w's/ws > 1) in recorded near-bed and intermediate flow regions (z/H 0. 5) and hindered (i. e. w's/ws < 1) in a recorded outer flow region (z/H 0. 5). The ratio w's/ws also reveals a general tendency to increase with decreasing grain size di. Vertical profiles of the normalised particle <b>fall</b> <b>velocity</b> w's/u* are shown to be analogous to turbulence intensity distributions (u' rms/u* and w'rms/u*), with the highest values of w's/u* occurring in the near-bed region and coinciding approximately with the regions of highest turbulence activity. This clearly implies the existence of turbulence-enhanced particle <b>fall</b> <b>velocities</b> within the flow conditions considered. Application of a quadrant analysis technique reinforces this notion, revealing further similarities between conditioned turbulent fluid fluctuations and particle motions, in particle, the dominance of 'inrush' events (quadrant 4) in the near-bed flow and 'ejection' events (quadrant 2) away from the bed...|$|R

As had been cited previously the angle of impact was generally underestimated, especially at acute angles {{and the reason for}} this was determined to be due to an overestimation of the length of a bloodstain. The surface type was found to significantly affect the accuracy of an angle of impact calculation and as the <b>falling</b> <b>velocity</b> increased, the angle of impact calculation became more accurate. High-speed photography was used to further investigate the formation of bloodstains on surfaces. It was found that the formation of the bloodstain varied depending on the surface type and the angle of the surface. Bloodstain pattern analysis involves the application of scientific techniques to reconstruct events that resulted in a bloodstain pattern.

Currently {{little is known about the}} methods used by bloodstain pattern analysts to select bloodstains when determining the region of origin.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a unified treatment of cloud particle <b>fall</b> <b>velocities</b> for both liquid and crystalline cloud particles {{over the entire}} size range observed in the atmosphere. The <b>fall</b> <b>velocity</b> representation is formulated {{in terms of the}} Best (or Davies) number X, and the Reynolds number Re. For the power-law representations used in many applications, the coefficients are found as the continuous analytical functions of X (or diameter) over the entire hydrometeor size range. Analytical asymptotic solutions are obtained for these coefficients for the two regimes that represent large and small particles and correspond to potential and aerodynamical flows, respectively. The new formulation is compared with experimental data and previous formulations for small drops, large nonspherical drops, and various ice crystal habits. For ice crystals, published mass–dimension and area– dimension relationships are used. The advantage of the new representation of <b>fall</b> <b>velocities</b> over previous representations is that the continuous representation avoids inaccuracy at the points of discontinuity for different size regimes, allows easier parameterization of the hydrometeor size spectra, and allows for continuous integration over the size spectrum. The new <b>fall</b> <b>velocity</b> formulation may be applied to bin-resolving and bulk microphysical models, as well as to remote sensing. 1...|$|R
