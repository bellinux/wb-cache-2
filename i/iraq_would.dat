In 2005, Clinton criticized the Bush administration for its handling of emissions control, while speaking at the United Nations Climate Change conference in Montreal.|$|E
5|$|After the {{invasion}} was over, the brigade {{was supposed to}} support the operation with bridging and infrastructure support. During the planning for {{the invasion}}, the engineers of the brigade were told that reconstruction in <b>Iraq</b> <b>would</b> be conducted by Department of Defense contractors and Iraqi civilians. They were not originally prepared to conduct major reconstruction efforts. When V Corps became the commanding element for the task force to rebuild Iraq, much of the invasion force, including the 130th Engineer Brigade, was sent to do jobs {{they had not been}} originally planned for, as basic utilities and sanitation conditions in Iraq were far below what was expected. Throughout the rest of 2003 and 2004, the engineers engaged in a large number of initial reconstruction projects on basic utilities, including schools, water treatment plants, waste removal, and the nation's power grid. It was determined that the scale of these projects was much greater than what the US had expected or what had been encountered in previous contingencies. It was also decided that reconstruction was essential to the coalition since it would help win over the Iraqi people. By May 2003, the brigade had been completely repurposed. Though originally tasked with demolishing obstacles, building fortifications, and bridging operations, the brigade was tasked entirely with construction projects. This conversion was a difficult process, as the brigade did not have the equipment and specialist units designed to handle reconstruction on a national scale. As more US military reconstruction units arrived in Iraq, the brigade grew to eight battalions and three groups.|$|E
5|$|Initially {{believing the}} Iraqi Army would only {{advance to the}} Ramallah oil field, Schwarzkopf was {{surprised}} when the Iraqis captured Kuwait City. Fearing <b>Iraq</b> <b>would</b> next invade Saudi Arabia, Schwarzkopf ordered contingency plans put in motion, with the 82nd Airborne Division, 101st Airborne Division and 24th Infantry Division put on alert. He was then called to an emergency meeting with President George H. W. Bush, where his Internal Look '90 strategic plans were made {{the basis of a}} potential counteroffensive plan. By August 5, Bush opted for an aggressive response to the invasion. Schwarzkopf then accompanied Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney to meet with Saudi King Fahd to convince him to allow U.S. troops into Saudi Arabia to counter the Iraqi military. With Fahd's consent, Bush ordered troops into Saudi Arabia on August 7, initially tasked to defend Saudi Arabia should Iraq attack. U.S. commanders from the beginning wanted a quick conflict characterized by decisive, overwhelming force, as opposed to the gradual escalation of U.S. involvement as had been seen in Vietnam. Schwarzkopf in particular was very adamant that many of the policies governing military operations in Vietnam, especially slow escalation of air power and troop force, not reoccur. His plan for direct and overwhelming force was initially criticized in Washington as uncreative. By August 13, the news media began to closely cover Schwarzkopf, who had been named to lead the operation.|$|E

Following Garner's dismissal, it was planned that an <b>Iraq</b> government <b>would</b> take power in June 2004. Iyad Allawi was designated to lead the Iraqi interim authority.

At this conference, attended by professionals, NGOs and Provincial Reconstruction Teams from all over Iraq, he announced that <b>Iraq</b> <b>would</b> direct its own health reconstruction, funding it with Iraqi money according to Iraqi priorities.

25|$|During the 1991 Gulf War, Israel {{feared that}} <b>Iraq</b> <b>would</b> attack {{the country with}} {{missiles}} carrying chemical weapons and prepared accordingly. Four million gas masks were distributed to citizens across the country, {{as well as to}} residents of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, and chemical-proof sealed rooms were prepared in homes. No chemical weapons were actually launched by Iraq, but Iraq did fire 39 conventional Scud missiles on Israel {{during the course of the}} war, hitting neighborhoods around Tel Aviv and elsewhere and causing extensive property damage. As soon as the first missile fell, Israel declared a chemical-weapons civil defense alert. Upon missile attacks, air-raid sirens sounded nationwide and civil defense authorities instructed the public, via radio, to don gas masks and close themselves in sealed rooms.|$|E
25|$|Because of the {{importance}} of Iraq, the potential for catastrophe, and the role and commitments of the United States in initiating events that have led to the current situation, we believe it would be wrong for the United States to abandon the country through a precipitate withdrawal of troops and support. A premature American departure from <b>Iraq</b> <b>would</b> almost certainly produce greater sectarian violence and further deterioration of conditions, leading to a number of the adverse consequences outlined above. The near-term results would be a significant power vacuum, greater human suffering, regional destabilization, and a threat to the global economy. Al Qaeda would depict our withdrawal as a historic victory. If we leave and Iraq descends into chaos, the long-range consequences could eventually require the United States to return.|$|E

500|$|After the Iraq War began, Clinton made {{trips to}} Iraq and Afghanistan to visit American troops {{stationed}} there. On {{a visit to}} Iraq in February 2005, Clinton noted that the insurgency had failed to disrupt the democratic elections held earlier and that {{parts of the country}} were functioning well. Observing that war deployments were draining regular and reserve forces, she co-introduced legislation to increase the size of the regular U.S. Army by 80,000soldiers to ease the strain. In late 2005, Clinton said that while immediate withdrawal from <b>Iraq</b> <b>would</b> be a mistake, Bush's pledge to stay [...] "until the job is done" [...] was also misguided, as it gave Iraqis [...] "an open-ended invitation not to take care of themselves". Her stance caused frustration among those in the Democratic Party who favored quick withdrawal. Clinton supported retaining and improving health benefits for reservists and lobbied against the closure of several military bases, especially those in New York. She used her position on the Armed Services Committee to forge close relationships with a number of high-ranking military officers. (By 2014 and 2015 Clinton had fully reversed herself on the Iraq War Resolution, saying that she [...] "got it wrong" [...] and the vote in support had been a [...] "mistake".) ...|$|E
500|$|The {{quick and}} decisive {{results of the}} Gulf War were {{attributed}} to Schwarzkopf's leadership. Historian Rick Atkinson considered Schwarzkopf [...] "the most theatrical American in uniform since Douglas MacArthur." [...] Atkinson further contended that in his leadership during the Gulf War, Schwarzkopf conducted {{one of the greatest}} military campaigns of all time, providing the United States with its [...] "first battlefield hero in decades." [...] His accomplishments were later compared favorably to those of General Tommy Franks during Operation Enduring Freedom. However, in an analysis {{of the effects of the}} Gulf War, several historians, including Spencer C. Tucker, contended that Schwarzkopf's ceasefire agreement allowed Iraq to continue to fly armed helicopters, which allowed it to later conduct operations against its Shia Arab and Kurdish populations. Schwarzkopf later wrote it would have been a mistake to continue the offensive and capture all of Iraq, noting that the U.S. would likely have had to pay the entire cost of rebuilding the country. In a 2012 book, historian Thomas E. Ricks wrote Schwarzkopf's lack of experience with politics were disadvantageous to his conduct of the war. Ricks said that Schwarzkopf was overly cautious in the execution of his plans because of his fear of repeating mistakes in Vietnam, which meant his troops failed to destroy the Iraqi Republican Guard. Ricks further criticized Schwarzkopf for failing to relieve General Frederick M. Franks Jr., as well as other subordinates who Schwarzkopf later said in his memoirs were ineffective. Ricks concluded that the Gulf War was a [...] "tactical triumph but a strategic draw at best." [...] In his memoirs, Schwarzkopf responded to these kinds of criticisms by saying his mandate had only been to liberate and safeguard Kuwait, and that an invasion of <b>Iraq</b> <b>would</b> have been highly controversial, particularly among Middle Eastern military allies.|$|E
