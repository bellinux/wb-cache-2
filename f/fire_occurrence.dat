Lantana camara, a pervasive invasive species, is hypothesized to alter fire regimes to greater extent causing damage to ecosystem properties. Thus, to elucidate its relationship with fire, if any, study on species presence and <b>fire</b> <b>occurrences</b> were carried out in present study. Venn diagrams and distance matrix analysis were employed to discern relationship between the two. The study revealed that more than 75 % of the <b>fire</b> <b>occurrences</b> overlapped with Lantana camara presence with overlapping percentage exceeding 50 %. Also, these regions were characterized with open forest canopy and dense Lantana camara infestations. The distance matrices of <b>fire</b> <b>occurrences</b> and Lantana camara presence ascertained that around 63. 33 % of measured distances between the two varied between 0 - 15 km only in both national parks. This confirms that reported <b>occurrences</b> of <b>fire</b> were found to be in close vicinity of species presence. Also, due to Lantana camara close proximity to <b>fire</b> <b>occurrences,</b> propulsion of further fire by providing fuel loads cannot be ruled out. These empirical evidences to some extent support the hypothesis that fire may be driven under presence of invasive species such as Lantana camara and vice versa holds true. The information presented in this research along with further comprehension of the relationship dynamics will allow for better management of Lantana camara invasions that have major ecological, economic and societal implications...|$|R

30|$|From {{the results}} of the study, it is posited that fire {{frequency}} and loss (fire fatalities) count data in the regions in Ghana are best modelled with similar distribution. Fire risk events in Ghana have been modelled with negative binomial. This is identified in the literature to be the best for modelling stochastic variation of ecological count data around a theoretical expectation data by taking into account the over-dispersion that arises from the data. Although the Poisson Model is the simplest count data model, it is highly restrictive, as the variance of the outcome is equal to its expectation. Fire count data exhibit over-dispersion. Therefore, the Negative Binomial Distribution that offers a dispersion parameter is argued to cogently explain positive count fire data. In this study, our negative binomial model was limited because it did not contain covariates. Future studies should focus on building models that capture several local covariates among regions. Considering the events of fatality and <b>fire</b> <b>occurrences,</b> we observed from the spatial graph and the sequence plot that frequency of <b>fire</b> <b>occurrences</b> and <b>fire</b> fatality are closely related. Future studies should focus on determining the relationship of capacities built among these regions to help mitigate <b>fire</b> <b>occurrences.</b> An extension of this work will focus on studying whether the efforts of Government of Ghana have succeeded in fire prevention.|$|R

We constructed models for all fires and for large fires only and generated predictive maps to quantify <b>fire</b> <b>occurrence</b> probabilities. Areas with high <b>fire</b> <b>occurrence</b> probabilities were widespread in the Southeast, and localized in the Mountain West, particularly in southern California, Arizona, and New Mexico.

As wildfire dynamics are mainly controlled by regional climatic patterns in boreal forests (Flannigan and Wotton 2001; Ali et al. 2009; Boulanger et al. 2013), we expected to find a regional fire history similar to that reported by Oris et al.

Having {{a clear understanding of}} the Holocene regional variability in <b>fire</b> <b>occurrence</b> is mandatory to adjust forest harvesting levels so that the total disturbance rate does not exceed the Holocene maximum.
