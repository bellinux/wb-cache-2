40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{voluntary}} provision of public goods that is partially {{driven by a}} desire to offset for individual polluting activities. We first extend existing theory and show that offsets allow a reduction in effective environmental pollution levels while not necessarily extending the consumption of a polluting good. We further show a nonmonotonic income-pollution relationship and derive comparative static results for the impact f an increasing environmental preference on purchases of offsets and mitigation activities. Several theoretical results are then econometrically tested using a novel data set on activities to reduce CO 2 emissions for the case of vehicle purchases in the U. S. and Germany. We show that an increased environmental preference triggers the use of CO 2 offsetting and mitigation channels in both countries. However, we find strong country differences for the purchase of CO 2 offsets. While such activities are already triggered by a high general awareness of the climate change problem in the U. <b>S.,</b> <b>driver's</b> <b>license</b> holders in Germany need to additionally perceive road traffic as being responsible for CO 2 emissions to a large extent...|$|R

A state challenge under the Tenth Amendment is more likely than modern individual rights jurisprudence to succeed in striking down Real ID. Arguing {{that the federal government}} impermissibly coerces state action under the Act will better protect both states and individual rights and succeed in having the Act overturned. Part II of this Comment provides a historical context for the enactment of Real ID and describes its reception by the states. Part III surveys relevant principles of constitutional federalism and discusses three Supreme Court cases commonly cited by states opposing the Act. Part IV argues that the statutory scheme under Real ID interferes with state sovereignty protected by the Tenth Amendment and potentially violates fundamental individual constitutional rights. Finally, Part V concludes that judicial enforcement of the Tenth Amendment in the context of Real ID vindicates both the integrity of state governments and important rights of state citizens...|$|R
