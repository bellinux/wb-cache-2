5|$|In another story, Stowe and Calvin {{meet a man}} on a Mandarin dock who {{has been}} cheated out of much the land he was given by the government. Named Old Cudjo, <b>he</b> <b>worked</b> <b>the</b> small {{homestead}} on which he grew cotton for years. Where at first the neighbors surrounding the colony of former slaves from South Carolina were hesitant and suspicious, Old Cudjo and his colony were so industrious and honest that they won their white neighbors over. One who was a justice of the peace intervened on his behalf and Old Cudjo's land was returned to him. Stowe's final chapter is dedicated to defending the notion that blacks should be employed to help build the state of Florida to transform it from a wilderness into a civilization. They are better suited for work in the hot sun, more resistant to malaria, and are trustworthy and extremely eager to learn. She also dedicates a few pages to her interested observations on their culture as she details overhearing their festivities at night and sitting outside an informal church service.|$|E
25|$|In 1866, {{at the age}} of 19, Edison {{moved to}} Louisville, Kentucky, where, as an {{employee}} of Western Union, <b>he</b> <b>worked</b> <b>the</b> Associated Press bureau news wire. Edison requested the night shift, which allowed him plenty of time to spend at his two favorite pastimes—reading and experimenting. Eventually, the latter pre-occupation cost him his job. One night in 1867, he was working with a lead–acid battery when he spilled sulfuric acid onto the floor. It ran between the floorboards and onto his boss's desk below. The next morning Edison was fired.|$|E
25|$|The {{colliery}} had a {{very close}} association with the canal {{as it was the}} means by which the colliery transported its coal to Bury, Radcliffe, Manchester and Salford. As the colliery developed, it started to build its own canal boats. The canal boats used by the colliery were horse-drawn, former collier Sid Dyer described his role and how <b>he</b> <b>worked</b> <b>the</b> horse-drawn boats when he started working at the colliery in 1938. The colliery had its own boat-building yard situated on the canal near Nob End. The boat builders were skilled tradesmen and usually passed the trade down from father to son. Alex Waterson who was the last of five generations of Ladyshore canal boat builders described the building process in his book. Following the breach of the canal at Nob End in 1936, the arm to Bury was kept open to transport coal, until the colliery closed.|$|E

25|$|Towards {{the middle}} of the 19th century the first {{positive}} descriptions of the heath emerged, initially inspired by the romantic movement. With the Industrial Revolution in Germany, unspoilt nature became more important for people, providing a welcome contrast with the rapidly burgeoning cities. Because the heathlands of North Germany were being increasingly decimated by cultivation and reforestation, they now appeared to be worth protecting. Numerous writers and painters portrayed the beauty of the heath, particularly when it was in bloom in August and September. One important heathland artist was Eugen Bracht. The most famous heath poet was the local writer Hermann Löns (1866–1914), who spent some time living in a hunting lodge near Westenholz. <b>He</b> <b>worked</b> <b>the</b> heath countryside into his books and promoted the foundation of the first German nature reserve on Lüneburg Heath. His purported remains were buried in a juniper copse at Tietlingen near Walsrode in 1935. His works were a source for Heimatfilme that were shot on Lüneburg Heath, such as Grün ist die Heide ("The Heath Is Green") from 1932 and remade in 1951 and 1972, as well as Rot ist die Liebe ("Red is Love") from 1956.|$|E
25|$|Wives of many Decembrists {{followed}} their husbands into exile. The expression Decembrist {{wife is a}} Russian symbol of the devotion of a wife to her husband. Maria Volkonskaya, {{the wife of the}} Decembrist leader Sergei Volkonsky, notably followed her husband to his exile in Irkutsk. Despite the spartan conditions of this banishment, Sergei Volkonsky and his wife, Maria, took opportunities to celebrate the liberalising mode of their exile. Sergei took to wearing an untrimmed beard (rejecting Peter the Great's reforms and salon fashion), wearing peasant dress and socialising with many of his peasant associates with whom <b>he</b> <b>worked</b> <b>the</b> land at his farm in Urik. Maria, equally, established schools, a foundling hospital and a theater for the local population. Sergei returned after thirty years of his exile had elapsed, though his titles and land remained under royal possession. Other exiles preferred to remain in Siberia after their sentences were served, preferring its relative freedom to the stifling intrigues of Moscow and St. Petersburg, and after years of exile there was not much for them to return to. Many Decembrists thrived in exile, in time becoming landowners and farmers. In later years, they would become idols of the populist movement of the 1860s and the 1870s, as the Decembrists' advocacy of reform (including the abolition of serfdom) won them many admirers, the writer Leo Tolstoy among them.|$|E

500|$|Shero's introverted, enigmatic {{personality}} had {{an effect}} on the way in which he coached players. Shero often communicated with his players by way of notes left in their lockers. When he did talk to them, he was known for never yelling. He believed that when coaches yell they do it for their own sake. He always defended his player whether it was in the press or even against management. He always tried to make sure his players were focused during the game. He often asked them how much time was left in the period to force them to pay attention. He had a unique take on practice as well. If the team was winning then <b>he</b> <b>worked</b> <b>the</b> team hard. If they were losing then there would be a low key practice. He believed that he could get more out of players when they were winning. He often had drills designed to let the players have fun, stating that [...] "Hockey is a child's game played by men. Since it's a child's game it ought to be fun". To have fun the Flyers occasionally had 12-on-12 games with the winning team earning a small monetary reward. He sometimes had the players perform drills that lacked purpose which the team performed until a player questioned the validity of the drill. At that point Shero stopped the drill and praised the player for being alert. Shero was notoriously bad with names. On one occasion it led to him trading for the wrong player. While GM of the Rangers Shero traded for Cam Connor believing it was Colin Campbell. Upon his arrival Conner had to explain that he was a winger and not a defenceman.|$|E

2500|$|The next {{companion}} Dorothy meets on {{the yellow}} brick road is the Tin Woodman {{who has been}} cursed by the now deceased Wicked Witch of the East. He was once a hard worker yearning to earn money {{to start a family}} with a Munchkin girl. The witch enchanted his axe so that the Woodman chopped off each of his limbs and eventually his body. Each time a tinner healed the Woodman by replacing his body with tin, however once the Tin Woodman's heart was removed he could no longer love. The Tin Woodman symbolizes the Eastern working man competing in an industrialized society. The 19th-century man had {{to keep up with the}} machine in order to be useful and relevant. In this way the Witch of the East's curse [...] "dehumanized a simple laborer so that the faster and better <b>he</b> <b>worked</b> <b>the</b> more quickly he became a kind of machine." [...] The Tin Woodman was caught in the rain and rusted in the same position for one year before Dorothy oils his joints to set him free. The Tin Woodman's year of waiting is parallel to the unemployment of Eastern workers during the severe depression of 1893-1897. His calls of help that were never heard relate to President Grover Cleveland's [...] "hard-hearted refusal" [...] to take action during this time to reinstate the economy. While the Tin Woodman stood still for a year, he finally slowed down enough to ponder life. During this time, he discovers that [...] "the greatest loss [...] had known was the loss of [...] heart" [...] for without it he cannot love. Baum portrays the Tin Woodman as an Eastern worker who lost sight of family values for a moment. [...] Part of the Progressive movement in the 19th century was to reestablish the family as the center of American life. The curse of the Tin Woodman by the Wicked Witch of the East is consistent with the depiction of the witch representing Wall Street and other Eastern big businesses during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.|$|E

Later he also became a landed property speculator as well as merchant successively in partnership with Fergusson Brothers & Co., Oswald Seal & Co. and Tulloh & Co. and in these three firms he was said to have lost some thirty lacs of rupees. He got into exporting of indigo, silk, sugar, rice, saltpetre to Europe and importing of iron and cotton-piece goods from England. He got up a number of cargo boats which were then a new speculation in the market. <b>He</b> <b>worked</b> <b>the</b> old Flour Mills, and shipped whole cargoes of biscuits to Australia for the first emigrants to its newly discovered gold fields. Later he put up a mill to refine sugar on the centrifugal principle. He was the first to use steamships for internal trade in Calcutta, and he prospered in competition with Europeans. In due course he amassed around thirteen trade ships including a steam tug named 'Banian'. He made a vast fortune in a single generation through money-dealing, a phrase which does not merely refer to money-lending, bill discounting and other banking business. There was scarcely a speculation into which he did not enter, and for which he did not supply a portion of funds. From dealings in internal exchanges to contracts for station-building, for the erection of new bazaars to revival of transit companies, there was scarcely an undertaking in which he was not an important, though a quiet shareholder.

2500|$|When Mr. Niebla {{returned}} to CMLL in July 2008, he quickly formed {{a group with}} Negro Casas and Heavy Metal called La Peste Negra (Spanish for [...] "the Black Plague), a Rudo group that had a more comical approach to wrestling. The trio started wearing large afro wigs, painting their faces black and dancing during their entrances and generally worked a less serious style of match than was unusual, especially for a serious wrestler like Negro Casas. On September 2, 2008 the last Casas brother, El Felino turned Rudo as well and joined La Peste Negra. After Felino joined the group Heavy Metal was quietly phased out as he was not comfortable working the comedic style. Felino's wife Princesa Blanca joined the group in early 2009, turning Rudo to work with La Pestra, the turn led to Princesa Blanca winning the Mexican National Women's Championship from Marcela on January 30, 2009. La Pesta Negra's biggest triumf to date is Negro Casas' title win over Místico that brought the CMLL World Welterweight Championship into the group. In March 2010 Mr. Niebla suffered a knee injury that {{kept him out of}} the ring for over three months. In early June, 2010 CMLL announced that after recuperating in Europe Mr. Niebla was ready to return to the ring, reuniniting La Peste Negra {{for the first time in}} several months. After making only a few in ring appearances Mr. Niebla disappeared from the CMLL booking sheets once again, replaced with Rey Bucanero. It was later revealed that his body had rejected the implant he had been given during his previous time away from the ring and it had to be replaced, putting him out of action for approximately a month before he was able to wrestle again. On August 16, 2010 it was announced that the recently returned Mr. Niebla would be one of 14 men putting their mask on the line in a Luchas de Apuestas steel cage match, the main event of the CMLL 77th Anniversary Show. Mr. Niebla was the sixth man to leave the steel cage, keeping his mask safe. The match came down to La Sombra pinning Olímpico to unmask him. On July 29, 2011, Mr. Niebla defeated 15 other men to win the 2011 Leyenda de Azul. On March 2, 2012, at Homenaje a Dos Leyendas, Mr. Niebla and Atlantis defeated Rush and El Terrible to win the Torneo Nacional de Parejas Increibles tournament, where rivals teamed together. In late 2012 the long dormant rivalry between Mr. Niebla and his former tag team partner Shocker rose to the surface again as the two began to work on opposite sides of a number of matches, with increasing intensity and animosity from both wrestlers. The two were paired up for the 2013 Torneo Nacional de Parejas Increibles as a way to continue the storyline between the two. The team worked together without too many problems in the initial rounds as they defeated the teams of Marco Corleone and Kraneo and the team of Máscara Dorada and Mephisto to qualify for the semi-finals. In the semi-finals they lost to eventual tournament winners La Sombra and Volador, Jr. Following the loss Mr. Niebla and Shocker argued and almost came to blows over who was responsible for losing the match. In January 2014, Niebla launched a new Peste Negra with Bárbaro Cavernario and Herodes, Jr. On February 14, Niebla and Cavernario defeated Soberano Jr. and Volador Jr. in the finals to win the 2014 Torneo Gran Alternativa. On February 18, Niebla, El Felino and Negro Casas defeated La Máscara, Rush and Titán to win the Mexican National Trios Championship. In January 2015, Niebla made his New Japan Pro Wrestling (NJPW) debut, when <b>he</b> <b>worked</b> <b>the</b> Fantastica Mania 2015 tour, co-produced by CMLL and NJPW. Mr. Niebla did not wrestle on the last two stops of the tour. According to the Wrestling Observer Newsletter, Niebla had disappeared on the third night and was the following morning found passed out in his hotel room, after which he was rushed to a local hospital for the next three days. NJPW, reportedly furious at the event, made CMLL pay for the hospital bill, leading to CMLL firing Niebla upon their return to Mexico. CMLL confirmed Niebla's departure from the promotion in February 2015.|$|E
