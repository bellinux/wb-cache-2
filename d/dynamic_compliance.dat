In normal subjects {{with a single}} ventilatory component (by multiple breath nitrogen washout method) a change of respiratory frequency did not affect <b>dynamic</b> lung <b>compliance.</b> Other normal sub-jects had two ventilatory components; in them and in the patients with bronchial obstruction, an increase of respiratory frequency decreased <b>dynamic</b> pulmonary <b>compliance.</b> A change of respiratory rate caused a greater change of <b>dynamic</b> lung <b>compliance</b> in the patients with bronchial obstruction than in normal subjects with two-component lungs.

Pneumoperitoneum and Trendelenburg position {{may influence}} intraoperative respiratory mechanics in anesthetic management. This {{study was conducted}} to investigate the influence of pneumoperitoneum and Trendelenburg position on respiratory compliance and ventilation pressure. Methods: Twenty-five patients scheduled for elective gynecologic laparoscopy were evaluated. The patients had no preexisting lung or heart disease or pathologic lung function. Conventional general anesthesia with thiopental sodium, lidocaine, rocuronium, and sevoflurane was administered. The peak inspiratory pressure, plateau pressure, and end-tidal CO 2 were measured before and after creation of pneumoperitoneum with an intraabdominal pressure of 12 mmHg, then after 10 minutes and 30 minutes in the 20 o Trendelenburg position, and after deflation of pneumoperitoneum.

Design: a prospective, randomized, controlled, multiple group study. Setting: an animal research centre laboratory in a university burns centre. Subjects: New Zealand rabbits (n = 30; 2. 25 ± 0. 25 kg) of either sex. Interventions: the animals were ventilated by HFOV with a mean airway pressure of 10 cm H 					 2 O, a frequency of 10 Hz, an amplitude of 20 cm H 					 2 O, an I:E ratio of 1 : 1, and an FiO 					 2 of 1. 0. After the induction of acute lung injury by steam inhalation, the animals {{were randomly assigned to}} receive either HFOV alone or a combined therapy of HFOV + PLV. The animals were grouped as HFOV, HFOV + PLV, and control group (without ventilation after recovery from muscular relaxation).

Lung mechanics were recorded for five minutes before and five minutes after a standardised suctioning procedure in 78 patients intubated with endotracheal tubes ≤ 4. 0 mm internal diameter.

This indeed often limits the accuracy of the RCSA techniques presented in other scientific works.

ObjectiveWe performed a prospective, single-center study to investigate the efficacy of lung recruitment maneuver (RM) with high-level positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) in patients with the 2009 influenza A (H 1 N 1) -associated acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). MethodsEighty-four patients with H 1 N 1 -associated ARDS were admitted to emergency intensive care units between October 2009 and February 2012. During pressure control ventilation, if arterial oxygen saturation (SpO 2) is consistently 30 minutes, an RM with high-level PEEP is performed to normalize lung volume at 30 cmH 2 O for 60 seconds. The RM was considered initially a responder if SpO 2 increased > 3 % within 15 minutes; otherwise, an SpO 2 increase < 3 % would be considered initially a nonresponder. Variations on oxygen metabolism and hemodynamic parameters were also measured before and after initial RM with high-level PEEP. ResultsAfter the initial RM, 40 patients (47. 6 %) with influenza-associated ARDS displayed an increase (≥ 3 %) in SpO 2 (the responder group), and 44 patients (52. 4 %) had no significant improvement (< 3 %) in SpO 2 (the nonresponder group). Among 84 patients with influenza-associated ARDS, 56 patients survived and 28 patients died. There was significant difference in mortality rate between the responder group and the nonresponder group (7 out of 40 vs 18 out of 44; P = 0. 019). The initial PEEP level in the responder group was lower than that of the nonresponder group (P = 0. 028). The initial mean duration of mechanical ventilation in the responder group was also shorter than that of the nonresponder group (P = 0. 011). Furthermore, the initial <b>dynamic</b> lung-thorax <b>compliance</b> was obviously higher in the initially responder group than in the nonresponder group (P = 0. 038).

Design: A prospective, randomized, controlled, multigroup study. Setting. An animal research laboratory at a medical center. Subjects. Newborn piglets (n = 29; 1. 80 +/- 0. 06 kg) of either sex. Interventions: Animals were ventilated with a tidal volume of 15 mL/kg, {{a rate of}} 30 breaths/min, a positive end-expiratory pressure of 5 cm H 2 O, and an FIO 2 of 1. 0. After the induction of acute lung injury by wood smoke inhalation, animals {{were randomly assigned to}} receive either conventional mechanical ventilation (CMV) or PLV with or without ESS pretreatment. Animals were grouped as CMV, ESS-CMV, PLV, and ESS-PLV. Measurements and Main Results., Arterial blood gases, cardiovascular hemodynamics, <b>dynamic</b> lung <b>compliance,</b> and total lung injury scores were measured. After smoke inhalation, all four groups displayed similar high arterial carboxyhemoglobin levels, low Pao(2) (< 150 mm Hg), and low <b>dynamic</b> lung <b>compliance</b> (< 66 % of its baseline). In the CMV group, these deleterious conditions remained during the 4 -hr observation period, and severe lung injury was noted histologically, All treatment groups demonstrated a significant increase in Pao(2) compared with the CMV group. In addition, both the PLV and ESS-PLV groups displayed significant improvements in <b>dynamic</b> lung <b>compliance</b> and in their histologic outcomes. Nevertheless, none of the variables measured in the PLV group differed from those measured in the ESS-PLV group. Conclusions. In a newborn piglet model of smoke inhalation injury, PLV or ESS improved oxygenation. PLV compared favorably with ESS in its greater improvements in lung compliance and lung pathology. However, the combined therapy of ESS and PLV was not clearly superior to PLV alone during the observation period...|$|R
