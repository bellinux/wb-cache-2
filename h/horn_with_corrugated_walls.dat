In this paper, {{attention is focused on}} replacing the rectangular shaped corrugation with a V-shaped corrugation. The properties of the V corrugations are obtained using an integral equation solution; the results of the computational studies indicate that for operation of the V corrugations in the forbidden zone the depth of the corrugations lie between 0. 3125 to 0. 625 times the wavelength in contrast to the rectangular corrugations where the corresponding depth is 0. 25 to 0. 5 times the wavelength.

We consider in detail {{the case of a}} cylindrically symmetric corrugated configuration, presenting two alternative techniques for modelling such few-moded systems.

40|$|By {{using two}} scalar eigenfunctions, {{electric}} and magnetic {{fields in the}} rectangular (or square) corrugated waveguide are analyzed. In a rectangular corrugated waveguide, the boundary conditions on two corrugated and two smooth walls can be satisfied to excite the hybrid mode. In a highly oversized waveguide where the wavelength of dominant mode is close to that in vacuum, two smooth walls can be exchanged <b>with</b> the <b>corrugated</b> <b>walls</b> because the boundary condition at this walls is satisfied approximately. The replacement is possible due to almost no penetration of the electromagnetic fields into the gap of the replaced walls when the direction of main electric field {{is parallel to the}} gap of replaced walls. This characteristic enables us to rotate th polarization of the hybrid mode in the oversized square waveguide <b>with</b> all four <b>corrugated</b> <b>walls</b> and is applicable to the remote steering antenna for electron cyclotron heating in the ITER. For a beam injection larger than the critical angle in this antenna, excited higher modes are at a considerably different wavelength from that in vacuum and result in thedissatisfaction of boundary conditions due to millimeter-wave penetration into corrugation gaps in replaced walls. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the fuzzy logic expert system (FLES) for heat transfer performance investigation in helically coiled heat exchanger <b>with</b> spirally <b>corrugated</b> <b>wall</b> operated <b>with</b> water and CuO/water nanofluids. Compared with traditional logic model, fuzzy logic {{is more efficient}} in connecting the multiple units to a single output and is invaluable supplements to classical hard computing techniques. Hence, the main objective of this analysis is to investigate the relationship between heat exchanger working parameters and performance characteristics, and to determine how fuzzy logic expert system {{plays a significant role}} in prediction of heat transfer performance. Analytical values are taken in helically coiled heat exchanger <b>with</b> spirally <b>corrugated</b> <b>wall</b> operated <b>with</b> water and CuO/water nanofluids for investigation of heat transfer performance. The heat transfer coefficients of CuO/water nanofluids significantly increased about 5. 90 - 14. 24 with the increase of volume concentrations compared to water and while the values of the friction factor decreased with the increase in volume flow rate and volume concentration by using nanofluid instead of water. A fuzzy logic expert system model has developed for the prediction of heat transfer coefficient and friction factor. Verification of the developed fuzzy logic model was carried out through various numerical error criteria. For all parameters, the relative error of predicted values are found to be less than and/or slightly above the acceptable limit (5). The goodnesses of fit of the prediction values from the fuzzy logic expert system model are found to be close to 1. 0 as expected, and hence demonstrated the good performance of the developed system.

Oxygen atom density profiles have been calculated by various authors from simulations using different water models in contact with hard walls, Lennard-Jones type walls of various powers, and polarixable walls where the polarixability is described by image charges. These results for smooth walls are compared with the density profiles obtained for the vicinity of a corrugated platinum crystal. There is general agreement that the dipole vectors of the water molecules near the walls are preferentially oriented parallel to the interface.
