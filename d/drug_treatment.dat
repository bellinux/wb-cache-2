The {{purpose of this}} study was to determine whether smoking cessation after entering <b>drug</b> abuse <b>treatment</b> influenced <b>drug</b> use 12 months after <b>drug</b> abuse <b>treatment.</b> We analyzed 2316 cigarette smokers in the <b>Drug</b> Abuse <b>Treatment</b> Outcome Study (DATOS), a national, longitudinal study of <b>drug</b> abuse <b>treatment.</b> Heckman probit selection models assessed the association of self-reported smoking cessation while in <b>drug</b> abuse <b>treatment</b> on self-reported <b>drug</b> abstinence in the year after treatment completion, while simultaneously accounting for possible nonparticipation bias. Controlling for multiple factors, smoking cessation was associated with greater abstinence from drug use after completion of <b>drug</b> abuse <b>treatment</b> (P=. 04).

5|$|Antidiabetic {{therapy has}} been {{proposed}} {{as a treatment for}} polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a condition frequently associated with insulin resistance, since the late 1980s. The use of metformin in PCOS was first reported in 1994, in a small study conducted at the University of the Andes, Venezuela. The United Kingdom's National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence recommended in 2004 that women with PCOS and a body mass index above 25 be given metformin for anovulation and infertility when other therapies fail to produce results. However, two clinical studies completed in 2006–2007 returned mostly negative results, with metformin performing no better than placebo, and a metformin-clomifene combination no better than clomifene alone. Reflecting this, subsequent reviews large randomized controlled trials in general have not shown the promise suggested by the early studies. UK and international clinical practice guidelines do not recommend metformin as a first-line treatment or do not recommend it at all, except for women with glucose intolerance. The guidelines suggest clomiphene as the first medication option and emphasize lifestyle modification independently from the <b>drug</b> <b>treatment.</b>|$|E
5|$|Making {{his acting}} debut {{at the age}} of five, {{appearing}} in his father's film Pound (1970), Downey Jr. appeared in roles associated with the Brat Pack, such as the teen sci-fi comedy Weird Science (1985) and the drama Less Than Zero (1987). He starred as the title character in the 1992 film Chaplin, which earned him a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actor and won him the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role. After being released in 2000 from the California Substance Abuse Treatment Facility and State Prison where he was on drug charges, Downey joined the cast of the TV series Ally McBeal playing Calista Flockhart's love interest. This earned him a Golden Globe Award. His character was written out when Downey was fired after two drug arrests in late 2000 and early 2001.

40|$|In {{a simple}} {{representative}} consumer model, vaccines and <b>drug</b> <b>treatments</b> yield the same revenue for a pharmaceutical manufacturer, {{implying that the}} firm {{would have the same}} incentive to develop either ceteris paribus. We provide more realistic models in which the revenue equivalence breaks down for two reasons. First, <b>drug</b> <b>treatments</b> are sold after the firm has learned who has contracted the disease; in the case of heterogeneous consumers who vary with respect to the probability of contracting the disease, there is less asymmetric information to prevent the firm from extracting consumer surplus with <b>drug</b> <b>treatments</b> than with vaccines. We prove that, due to this aspect of pharmaceutical pricing, the ratio of drug-treatment to vaccine revenue can be arbitrarily high; we calculate that the ratio is about two to one for empirical distributions of HIV risk. The second reason for the breakdown of revenue equivalence is that vaccines are more likely to interfere with the spread of the disease than are <b>drug</b> <b>treatments,</b> thus reducing demand for the product. By embedding an economic model within a standard dynamic epidemiological model, we show that the steady-state flow of revenue is greater for dru...|$|R
