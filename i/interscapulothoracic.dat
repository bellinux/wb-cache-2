40|$|ABSTRACTRadical {{surgeries}} {{for treatment}} of scapular and pelvic girdle tumors (hemipelvectomy and <b>interscapulothoracic</b> amputation) are generally extended procedures, with large areas of local tissue loss after tumor resection. The use of a flap that includes all the anterior and posterior thigh musculature after femur dissection, pedicled in the superficial femoral vessels, has been described was only once in the medical literature, {{and there have been}} no reports on a similar flap using the whole anterior and posterior musculature of the arm after humerus dissection, pedicled in the subclavian vessels, for reconstruction after <b>interscapulothoracic</b> amputation. Here, we describe two cases – one hemipelvectomy and one interscapulothoracicl amputation - using these two the flaps to close the defect...|$|E
40|$|On {{the basis}} of 25 years of {{experience}} with the managment of extremity sarcomas at the University Hospital Groningen, the Netherlands, this thesis aimed: to discuss the development and results of multidisciplinary treatment in extremity soft tissue sarcoma and osteosarcoma; to investigate the long-term results of the combined treatment of high-dose methotrexate-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy and surgery in malignant fibrous histiocytoma of bone; to assess the long-term oncological and functional outcome of endoprosthetic reconstructions after tumour resection of the lower extremity; to investigate the indications and oncological results of hindfoot amputation as a limb-sparing alternative to below-knee amputation; to inventorize the indications and oncological results of two major amputations in surgical oncology: <b>interscapulothoracic</b> amputation and hemipelvectomy; to analyse the experience with Tikhoff-Linberg resection {{as an alternative to}} <b>interscapulothoracic</b> amputation, as well as internal hemipelvectomy with or without reconstruction and buttockectomy as alternatives to hemipelvectomy; to investigate the oncological outcome of pelvic osteosarcoma, which is a rare location for these tumours.

40|$|Forequarter (<b>interscapulothoracic)</b> {{amputation}} {{is a major}} ablative {{surgical procedure}} that was originally described to manage traumatic injuries of the upper extremity. Currently, it is most commonly used {{in the treatment of}} malignant tumours of the arm. With the advent of limb-sparing techniques, primary forequarter amputation is performed less frequently, but remains a powerful surgical option in managing malignant tumours of the upper extremity; therefore, surgeons should be familiar with this procedure. A classic case report of forequarter amputation, with emphasis on indications and surgical techniques, is presented...|$|E
40|$|The {{majority}} of patients with soft tissue or bone sarcomas of the upper extremity can be treated today with limb-saving procedures using combined modality therapies. For patients with a tumor in the shoulder area, sometimes an <b>interscapulothoracic</b> amputation is the only radical surgical treatment. However, in selected cases, in which the tumor does not involve the neurovascular bundle, a limb-sparing alternative might be the Tikhoff-Linberg resection. Normal function of the hand and forearm, with reasonable function of the elbow, can be maintained by this procedure. Four case histories are reported...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to {{describe}} an alternative switching option for the higher-level upper limb amputee. Currently available body powered switches allow for only one function which can become quite cumbersome when multiple control methods are used. A multi-functional switch that can activate many different controls either independently or simultaneously could greatly reduce the amount of hardware required to operate all of these devices. When working with bilateral shoulder or <b>interscapulothoracic</b> amputees one of the main goals is to provide as much function as possible while maintaining simplicity in the design. The first patient that was fit with the actuator was currently wearing bilateral shoulder prostheses with seven switches. The result was a reduction in the amount of switches necessary to operate the different controls from seven to two. The switch can also be configured to operate Force Sensing Resistors (FSR’s) or linear transducers to provide proportional control...|$|E
40|$|INAIL and DIEM prototyped a new externally-powered {{prosthetic}} shoulder {{developed for}} <b>interscapulothoracic</b> and first-proximal trans-humeral amputees. The articulation consist of two connected powered joints {{that allow the}} elevation of the upper arm in any vertical plane passing through the shoulder centre of rotation. The development of the mechanism {{is the result of}} a rigorous approach, which made it possible to systematically combine both the technical and the clinical aspects involved in the design of a prosthetic device. The prototype underwent laboratory tests needed to evaluate the mechanism’s performance (e. g. the maximum payload) and the electrical requirements (e. g. the current draining). Based also on the results retrieved from these tests, an on-board embedded controller was implemented. The electronic unit can control a prosthesis with up to five powered joints and can manage different control strategies, according to the amputees’ preferences. The prototype with the embedded control system has been recently integrated within the prosthesis, provided with hand, wrist and elbow, of a proximal trans-humeral amputee who firstly tested the new device. This paper provides an overview of the development of the actual prosthesis, reports the main patient’s feedback and outlines the future developments...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Proximal major limb amputations due to {{malignant}} tumors {{have become}} rare {{but are still}} a valuable treatment option in palliation {{and in some cases}} can even cure. The aim of this retrospective study was to analyse outcome in those patients, including the postoperative course, survival, pain, quality of life, and prosthesis usage. Methods Data of 45 consecutive patients was acquired from patient's charts and contact to patients, and general practitioners. Patients with <b>interscapulothoracic</b> amputation (n = 14), shoulder disarticulation (n = 13), hemipelvectomy (n = 3) or hip disarticulation (n = 15) were included. Results The rate of proximal major limb amputations in patients treated for sarcoma was 2. 3 % (37 out of 1597). Survival for all patients was 42. 9 % after one year and 12. 7 % after five years. Survival was significantly better in patients with complete tumor resections. Postoperative chemotherapy and radiation did not prolong survival. Eighteen percent of the patients with malignant disease developed local recurrence. In 44 %, postoperative complications were observed. Different modalities of postoperative pain management and the site of the amputation had no significant influence on long-term pain assessment and quality of life. Eighty-seven percent suffered from phantom pain, 15. 6 % considered their quality of life worse than before the operation. Thirty-two percent of the patients who received a prosthesis used it regularly. Conclusion Proximal major limb amputations severely interfere with patients' body function and are the last, albeit valuable, option within the treatment concept of extremity malignancies or severe infections. Besides short survival, high complication rates, and postoperative pain, patients' quality of life can be improved for the time they have remaining. </p...|$|E
