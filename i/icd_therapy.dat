40|$|AbstractOBJECTIVESThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} whether clinical or electrophysiologic characteristics could predict initial and subsequent implantable cardioverter defibrillator (<b>ICD)</b> <b>therapy.</b> BACKGROUNDIdentification of markers to predict subsequent <b>ICD</b> <b>therapy</b> and symptoms after the first event could affect patient management. METHODSWe analyzed baseline and follow-up data on 125 ICD patients followed for 408 ± 321 days. Medications and ICD programming were not changed after first <b>ICD</b> <b>therapy.</b> RESULTSImplantable cardioverter defibrillator therapy occurred in 58 patients (46 %). Clinical features were as follows: mean left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) 29 % ± 15 %; coronary artery disease 84 %; presenting arrhythmia with sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (SMVT) in 68 %. In a multivariate analysis the relative risk for <b>ICD</b> <b>therapy</b> in patients presenting with SMVT versus cardiac arrest (CA) was 2. 57 (range, 1. 32 to 5. 01), and for patients with LVEF ≤ 25 %, 1. 95 (1. 11 to 3. 45), respectively (p < 0. 05). Implantable cardioverter defibrillator therapy was not predicted by any other variable. Forty-six patients had second <b>ICD</b> <b>therapy.</b> Mean time to second <b>ICD</b> <b>therapy</b> was only 66 ± 93 days compared with 138 ± 168 days for first <b>ICD</b> <b>therapy</b> (p < 0. 05). No predictor for second <b>ICD</b> <b>therapy</b> was found. Regarding symptoms, impaired consciousness during initial <b>ICD</b> <b>therapy</b> was predicted only by SMVT cycle length < 250 ms at electrophysiologic testing. In contrast, symptoms were similar between first and second <b>ICD</b> <b>therapy</b> (p = 0. 0001). Of note, ventricular tachycardia cycle length preceding first and second <b>ICD</b> <b>therapy</b> was similar (r = 0. 76, p = 0. 001). CONCLUSIONSFirst <b>ICD</b> <b>therapy</b> tends to occur in patients presenting with SMVT and LVEF ≤ 25 %. Subsequent therapy occurs sooner and is unpredictable, suggesting that antiarrhythmic drug therapy should be considered after the first symptomatic <b>ICD</b> <b>therapy.</b> Symptoms during first <b>ICD</b> <b>therapy</b> predict subsequent symptoms, and patients presenting with SMVT and asymptomatic first <b>ICD</b> <b>therapy</b> are at very low risk for future syncopal <b>ICD</b> <b>therapy...</b>|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) improve {{survival}} in selected patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction in randomized trials. Competing death without prior appropriate <b>ICD</b> <b>therapy</b> might preclude benefit from ICD implantation {{in a less}} selected routine-care population. METHODS AND RESULTS: We selected all patients with ischemic or dilated cardiomyopathy with an ICD implanted for primary or secondary prevention from a single-center prospective registry between 1994 and 2006. The end point was time to first appropriate ICD therapy/confirmed ventricular fibrillation or death without prior appropriate <b>ICD</b> <b>therapy.</b> We analyzed cumulative incidence functions and used competing risk regression to study predictors of appropriate <b>ICD</b> <b>therapy</b> or prior death. In 442 patients, 73 deaths occurred during a median follow-up of 3. 6 years (maximum, 12. 7 years). The cumulative incidence of first appropriate <b>ICD</b> <b>therapy</b> until year 7 was 52 %, whereas 11 % died without prior <b>ICD</b> <b>therapy.</b> The cumulative incidence of appropriate <b>ICD</b> <b>therapy</b> for ventricular fibrillation was 13 %, whereas 23 % died without prior therapy for ventricular fibrillation. Appropriate <b>ICD</b> <b>therapy</b> was twice as likely in secondary prevention compared with primary prevention, whereas death rates before <b>ICD</b> <b>therapy</b> were similar in both groups. Diuretic use for heart failure compared with nonuse predicted a 4 -fold-increased risk of death prior to <b>ICD</b> <b>therapy,</b> although the incidence of appropriate <b>ICD</b> <b>therapy</b> was similar in both groups.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Arrhythmogenic right {{ventricular}} cardiomyopathy (ARVC) {{is a rare}} genetically {{transmitted disease}} prone to ventricular arrhythmias. We therefore investigated the clinical, echocardiographical and electrophysiological predictors of appropriate implantable cardioverter defibrillator (<b>ICD)</b> <b>therapy</b> in patients with ARVC. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed in 26 patients (median age of 40 years at diagnosis, 21 males and 5 females) with ARVC who underwent ICD implantation. RESULTS: Over a median (range) follow-up period of 10 (2. 7, 37) years, appropriate <b>ICD</b> <b>therapy</b> for ventricular arrhythmias was documented in 12 (46 %) out of 26 patients. In all patients with appropriate <b>ICD</b> <b>therapy</b> the ICD was originally inserted for secondary prevention. Median time from ICD implantation to <b>ICD</b> <b>therapy</b> was 9 months (range 3. 6, 54 months). History of heart failure {{was a significant predictor}} of appropriate <b>ICD</b> <b>therapy</b> (p = 0. 033). Left ventricular disease involvement (p = 0. 059) and age at implantation (p = 0. 063) were borderline significant predictors. Patients with syncope at time of diagnosis were significantly less likely to receive <b>ICD</b> <b>therapy</b> (p = 0. 02). Invasive electrophysiological testing was not significantly associated with appropriate <b>ICD</b> <b>therapy.</b> CONCLUSION: In our cohort of patients with ARVC, history of heart failure {{was a significant predictor of}} appropriate <b>ICD</b> <b>therapy,</b> whereas left ventricular involvement and age at time of ICD implantation were of borderline significance.

Here we present the long-term follow-up data and results of preplanned subgroup exploratory analyses from MCL- 002 to evaluate {{the potential impact of}} demographic factors, baseline clinical characteristics and prior therapies on PFS. In MCL- 002, patients with relapsed/refractory MCL were randomized 2 : 1 to receive lenalidomide (25  mg/day orally on days 1 - 21; 28 -day cycles) or single-agent <b>IC</b> <b>therapy</b> (rituximab, gemcitabine, fludarabine, chlorambucil or cytarabine). The intent-to-treat population comprised 254 patients (lenalidomide, n =  170; IC, n =  84). Subgroup analyses of PFS favoured lenalidomide over IC across most characteristics, including risk factors, such as high MCL International Prognostic Index score, age ≥ 65  years, high lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), stage III/IV disease, high tumour burden, and refractoriness to last prior therapy. By multivariate Cox regression analysis, factors associated with significantly longer PFS (other than lenalidomide treatment) included normal LDH levels (P <  0 · 001), nonbulky disease (P =  0 · 045), < 3 prior antilymphoma treatments (P =  0 · 005), and ≥ 6  months since last prior treatment (P =  0 · 032).

40|$|ObjectivesThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} whether 123 -iodine metaiodobenzylguanidine (123 -I MIBG) imaging predicts ventricular arrhythmias causing appropriate implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (<b>ICD)</b> <b>therapy</b> (primary end point) and the composite of appropriate <b>ICD</b> <b>therapy</b> or cardiac death (secondary end point). BackgroundAlthough cardiac sympathetic denervation is associated with ventricular arrhythmias, limited data are available on the predictive value of sympathetic nerve imaging with 123 -I MIBG on the occurrence of arrhythmias. MethodsBefore ICD implantation, patients underwent 123 -I MIBG and myocardial perfusion imaging. Early and late 123 -I MIBG (planar and single-photon emission computed tomography [SPECT]) imaging was performed to assess cardiac innervation (heart-to-mediastinum ratio, cardiac washout rate, and 123 -I MIBG SPECT defect score). Stress-rest myocardial perfusion imaging was performed to assess myocardial infarction and perfusion abnormalities (perfusion defect scores). During follow-up, appropriate <b>ICD</b> <b>therapy</b> and cardiac death were documented. ResultsOne-hundred sixteen heart failure patients referred for <b>ICD</b> <b>therapy</b> were enrolled. During a mean follow-up of 23 ± 15 months, appropriate <b>ICD</b> <b>therapy</b> (primary end point) was documented in 24 (21 %) patients and appropriate <b>ICD</b> <b>therapy</b> or cardiac death (secondary end point) in 32 (28 %) patients. Late 123 -I MIBG SPECT defect score was an independent predictor for both end points.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Interstitial {{cystitis}} (IC) or bladder pain syndrome (BPS) {{is defined}} as supra-pubic pain related to bladder filling. IC {{is characterized by a}} particular symptom complex with no identifiable causes; as with bladder hypersensitivity it is usually associated with urinary frequency and urgency with bladder pain.

This article reviews material obtained via Medline, PubMed, and EMBASE literature searches up to October 2013. EXPERT OPINION: The correct approach to IC should consider a multidisciplinary team of specialists and a multimodal treatment package that include psychotherapy, behavior change, physical activation, and analgesic treatment. Unfortunately, a single therapeutic target for IC is not yet known. With regard to pathophysiology and therapy, there is more to discover.

40|$|Purpose: To compare intralesional {{corticosteroid}} (IC) injections with oral propranolol {{in children}} with periorbital infantile hemangioma (IH). Methods: Children were diagnosed with IH and treated with IC (n = 29) or propranolol (n = 14). In cases in which no further improvement was seen, treatment was stopped and the outcome measured. Type, duration, and complications of treatment and supportive or additional therapies were scored, along with outcomes of visual measurements, at the start and end of therapy. Results: Twenty-one of the 29 children (72 %) treated with IC injections were given a second injection and 16 (55 %) were given more than two. Median duration of <b>IC</b> <b>therapy</b> was 15. 9 months (interquartile range (IQR) 10. 28), compared with 6. 5 months (IQR 4. 87) for propranolol (p < 0. 001).

AIMS: To compare EBT with other non-invasive measurements in unselected schoolchildren {{in relation to}} respiratory symptoms and IC-therapy, {{as well as to}} assess reproducibility, and potentially influencing factors. METHODS: In 298 Italian schoolchildren, we assessed tidal-EBT, FENO, spirometry, skin-prick tests, questionnaires on chronic respiratory symptoms, and medication.

Little {{data are available}} regarding the prognostic value of hs-CRP and BNP serum levels and future ventricular arrhythmic events triggering implantable cardioverter defibrillator (<b>ICD)</b> <b>therapy.</b> Methods: A total of 100 patients eligible for ICD implantation were enrolled in a prospective cohort study. Serum levels of hs-CRP and BNP were obtained the day before ICD implantation and at scheduled follow-up visits. For risk analysis, the study cohort was dichotomized based on serum level of hs-CRP using a cut-off value of 3 mg/L. The endpoint was appropriate <b>ICD</b> <b>therapy</b> triggered by ventricular arrhythmias during a follow-up of 24 months. Results: Appropriate <b>ICD</b> <b>therapy</b> was delivered in 20 % of patients. Median baseline serum level of hsCRP was significantly higher in patients with appropriate <b>ICD</b> <b>therapy</b> than in those without appropriate <b>ICD</b> <b>therapy</b> (5. 33 mg/L vs 2. 19 mg/L; P = 0. 002). The same was true for median serum levels of hs-CRP and BNP during follow-up (5. 43 mg/L vs 2. 61 mg/L, P = 0. 001 and 261. 0 pg/mL vs 80. 1 pg/mL, P = 0. 01, respectively).

40|$|Aims: Implantable cardioverter {{defibrillator}} (<b>ICD)</b> <b>therapy</b> improves {{survival in}} patients at high {{sudden cardiac death}} (SCD) risk. However, some patient groups fulfilling indications for <b>ICD</b> <b>therapy</b> may not gain significant benefit: patients whose absolute risk of SCD is low and patients whose risk of death even with an ICD is high. The value of biomarkers in identifying patients’ potential for survival benefit from <b>ICD</b> <b>therapy</b> is unknown. We performed a pilot study to investigate this. Methods and results: Five established cardiovascular biomarkers were measured in patients with ICDs on the background of left ventricular dysfunction: N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide [NT-proBNP], soluble ST 2 [sST 2], growth differentiation factor- 15, C-reactive protein, and interleukin- 6. The endpoints were all-cause mortality and survival with appropriate <b>ICD</b> <b>therapy.</b> One hundred and fifty-six patients were enrolled (age 69 years [Q 1 –Q 3 62 – 77], 85 % male, 76 % ischaemic aetiology). During a follow-up of 15 ± 3 months, 12 patients died and 43 survived with appropriate <b>ICD</b> <b>therapy.</b> In a Cox proportional hazards model, the strongest predictors of death were Log sST 2 (P< 0. 001), serum creatinine (P< 0. 001), and Log NT-proBNP (P= 0. 002). The strongest predictor of survival with appropriate <b>ICD</b> <b>therapy</b> was Log NT-proBNP (P= 0. 01). Conclusion: The biomarkers NT-proBNP and sST 2 are promising biomarkers for identifying patients with little potential to gain significant survival benefit from <b>ICD</b> <b>therapy.</b> However, their incremental benefit, in addition to currently available clinical risk prediction models, remains unclear.

Methods and results Sixty patients with DCM and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) at referral of ≤ 45 %, New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification ≥ 2 and no secondary cause for the cardiomyopathy were randomized equally into four groups: peripheral placebo (saline), peripheral G-CSF, peripheral G-CSF and IC serum, and peripheral G-CSF and IC BMC. All patients, except the peripheral placebo group, received 5 days of G-CSF. In the IC groups, {{this was followed by}} bone marrow harvest and IC infusion of cells or serum on Day 6. The primary endpoint was LVEF change from baseline to 3 months, determined by advanced cardiac imaging. At 3 months, peripheral G-CSF combined with <b>IC</b> BMC <b>therapy</b> was associated with a 5. 37 % point increase in LVEF (38. 30 % ± 12. 97 from 32. 93 % ± 16. 46 P = 0. 0138), which was maintained to 1 year.

40|$|The sudden {{cardiac death}} (scd) due to malign cardiac arrhythmias (mca) with 100. 000 deaths per year in Germany {{represents}} {{a major problem in}} the health care system. In recent years the therapy of mca constantly advanced. Special emphasise is to be put on the implantable cardioverter/defibrillator (<b>icd)</b> as <b>therapy</b> of malign cardiac arrhythmias and as option for prevention of scd. Due to the high costs of the icd, only patients with well known high risk of scd can be treated with this form of therapy. For detecting these high risk patients we need a practicable and significant diagnostic instrument. Previous studies identified the t-wave-alternans-test (twa-test) - e. g. in the group of post-myocard-infarct-patients – to be a non invasive, easy to apply and significant diagnostic tool for detecting high risk patients (positive twa-test: high risk for scd/mca). The present study placed empasis on patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (dcm) due to their prevalent malign cardiac arrhythmias, thus great benefit of significant diagnostics and a target-oriented <b>therapy</b> like an <b>icd.</b> We performed the twa-test on 147 dcm-patients. 33 of these 147 patients already had an implantation of icd before the onset of the study and hence built the highrisk group.

40|$|Traditional spirometry, while of {{unquestionable}} diagnostic utility, provides imprecise {{information about}} {{the nature and extent of}} physiological impairment or the resultant clinical consequences in any given patient with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The corollary is that exclusive reliance on spirometric forced expiratory flow rates as the primary outcome measure for the evaluation of therapeutic efficacy can lead to significant underestimation of clinical benefit. Recognition of the limitations of routinely used physiological parameters has prompted a search for additional simple and reliable tests for use in clinical trials. Among these, the spirometric inspiratory capacity (IC) shows early promise as a useful, clinically relevant outcome measure that complements traditional expiratory flow measurements. Consistent improvements in <b>IC</b> after bronchodilator <b>therapy</b> signify reduction in lung hyperinflation and can occur in the setting of minimal or no change in maximal expiratory flow rates, particularly in patients with more severe disease. Moreover, improved IC has been shown to correlate well with improvement in important clinical outcomes such as dyspnea and exercise endurance in patients with moderate to severe COPD. This review charts the evolving experience with this novel parameter in the clinical trial setting. Chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease, Outcomes-research...|$|R

40|$|Aims For {{patients}} undergoing cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) with implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD; CRT-D), {{the effect}} of an improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) on appropriate <b>ICD</b> <b>therapy</b> may have significant implications regarding management {{at the time of}} ICD generator replacement. Methods and results We conducted a meta-analysis to determine {{the effect of}} LVEF recovery following CRT on the incidence of appropriate <b>ICD</b> <b>therapy.</b> A search of multiple electronic databases identified 709 reports, of which 6 retrospective cohort studies were included (n = 1740). In patients with post-CRT LVEF ≥ 35 % (study n = 4), the pooled estimated rate of <b>ICD</b> <b>therapy</b> (5. 5 / 100 person-years) was significantly lower than patients with post-CRT LVEF < 35 % [incidence rate difference (IRD) : − 6. 5 / 100 person-years, 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) : − 8. 8 to − 4. 2, P < 0. 001]. Similarly, patients with post-CRT LVEF ≥ 45 % (study n = 4) demonstrated lower estimated rates of <b>ICD</b> <b>therapy</b> (2. 3 / 100 person-years) compared with patients without such recovery (IRD: − 5. 8 / 100 person-years, 95 % CI: − 7. 6 to − 4. 0, P < 0. 001). Restricting analysis to studies discounting ICD therapies during LVEF recovery (study n = 3), patients with LVEF recovery (≥ 35 or ≥ 45 %) had significantly lower rates of <b>ICD</b> <b>therapy</b> compared with patients without such recovery (P for both < 0. 001). Patients with primary prevention indication for ICD, regardless of LVEF recovery definition, had very low rates of <b>ICD</b> <b>therapy</b> (0. 4 to 0. 8 / 100 -person years).

40|$|Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (<b>ICD)</b> <b>therapy</b> {{decreases}} arrhythmic and all-cause {{mortality in}} patients {{at high risk}} of sudden death. However, its clinical benefit in elderly patients is uncertain. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the long-term efficacy of ICD treatment in elderly patients and to identify markers of successful <b>ICD</b> <b>therapy</b> and risk factors of mortality. We performed multivariate analysis of a prospective long-term database from 2 tertiary care centers including 936 consecutive patients with an ICD. Predictors of <b>ICD</b> <b>therapy</b> and risk factors for mortality were assessed in patients ≥ 75 years old at ICD implantation compared to younger patients. Mean follow-up time was 43 ± 40 months. Rates of <b>ICD</b> <b>therapy</b> were similar in the 2 age groups. No significant predictors of <b>ICD</b> <b>therapy</b> could be identified in older patients. Median estimated survival was 132 months in patients < 75 years and 81 months in those ≥ 75 years old (p = 0. 006). Decreased ejection fraction (hazard ratio 1. 62 per 10 % decrease, p = 0. 03) and impaired renal function (hazard ratio 1. 57 per 10 ml/kg/m(2) decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate, p = 0. 02) were independent risk factors of mortality in patients ≥ 75 years old. However, mortality of older patients was similar to that of the age-matched general population irrespective of delivery of <b>ICD</b> <b>therapy.</b> In conclusion, <b>ICD</b> <b>therapy</b> is effective for treatment of life-threatening arrhythmias in all age groups. However, prevention of sudden cardiac death may have limited impact on overall mortality in older patients. Despite a similar rate of appropriate ICD therapies, risk of death is increased 1. 6 -fold in ICD recipients ≥ 75 years old compared to younger patients.

40|$|Despite {{the wide}} use of {{intravenous}} cyclophosphamide (IC) in lupus nephritis (LN), {{there are few}} published studies showing {{the effect of this}} treatment on renal histology. In this prospective study, we report the effect of IC on the evolution of histopathologic features in successive renal biopsies in patients with LN. Thirty patients with class IV or V LN were started on IC (10 - 15 mg/kg) administered once every month for six months followed by three monthly for another six doses making a total of two years of therapy. The clinical course of the disease, serum creatinine and 24 hours urinary protein and creatinine clearance were tested at entry and subsequently during each follow-up visit. Repeat renal biopsy was performed after completion of two years of therapy. The mean serum creatinine of the study patients was 166. 3 &#x 002 B; 42 tmol/L at entry which decreased to 104 &#x 002 B; 46. 4 tmol/L at two years (P 200 tmol/L, of whom six progressed to variable degrees of chronic renal failure. Repeat renal biopsy was performed in 21 patients. The original biopsy of these patients showed class IV in 17 and class V in four patients. On repeat biopsy, five of class IV disease had progressed to advanced sclerosis, four to class V, and five remained unchanged. The remaining three patients with class IV LN changed to one each of class I, II and III. Of the four patients with class V, one progressed to advanced sclerosis, one changed to class III and two remained the same. There was a significant decrease (P < 0. 05) in the activity index although there was {{a significant increase in the}} chronicity index (P < 0. 001). Multivariat analysis for possible risk factors for progression to chronic renal failure showed initial high serum creatinine to be a powerful predictor of renal failure. In conclusion, <b>IC</b> pulse <b>therapy</b> is effective in improving or stabilizing renal function in patients with class IV or V LN.

We aimed to determine the level of serum IL- 5 in partly controlled atopic asthma in children and to assess the effect of different therapies on their levels. METHODS: The study included 40 children aged 6 - 12 years with partly controlled asthma. Cases were randomly divided into two groups; group ‘A’ receiving Leukotriene modifiers and group ‘B’ receiving inhaled corticosteroids; each for two months. They were compared to 20 healthy non-asthmatic, matched controls. Serum IL- 5 was measured for cases on the first visit and two months after therapy. Absolute eosinophilic count and serum Ig-E were determined. Pulmonary function testing was performed using spirometer at the beginning and two months after regular therapy. RESULTS: Serum Interleukin- 5 was significantly increased in asthmatic children during exacerbation and was significantly decreased after treatment. ROC curve analysis showed significant difference of IgE and PEFR after treatment with leukotriene modifier only. CONCLUSION: Serum IL- 5 seems to have a role in asthma pathogenesis. Efficiency of the two <b>therapies</b> (<b>ICs</b> & LTA) was similar in this group of patients. Both treatments led to significant decline in serum IL- 5, IgE levels and eosinophilic count...|$|R
40|$|Globoid cell {{leukodystrophy}} (GLD) is a lysosomal {{storage disease}} caused by deficient activity of β-galactocerebrosidase (GALC). The infantile forms manifest with rapid and progressive central and peripheral demyelination, which represent a major hurdle for any treatment approach. We demonstrate here that neonatal lentiviral vector-mediated intracerebral gene <b>therapy</b> (<b>IC</b> GT) or transplantation of GALC-overexpressing neural stem cells (NSC) synergize with {{bone marrow transplant}} (BMT) providing dramatic extension of lifespan and global clinical-pathological rescue in a relevant GLD murine model. We show that timely and long-lasting delivery of functional GALC in affected tissues ensured by the exclusive complementary mode of action of the treatments underlies the outstanding benefit. In particular, the contribution of neural stem cell transplantation and IC GT during the early asymptomatic stage of the disease is instrumental to enhance long-term advantage upon BMT. We clarify the input of central nervous system, peripheral nervous system and periphery to the disease, and the relative contribution of treatments to the final therapeutic outcome, with important implications for treatment strategies to be tried in human patients. This study gives proof-of-concept of efficacy, tolerability and clinical relevance of the combined gene/cell therapies proposed here, which may constitute a feasible and effective therapeutic opportunity for children affected by GL...|$|R

It features a comprehensive overview of the technical concepts, the practical application and current developments of IC. Pubmed-referenced publications were analyzed to generate an overview about the basic knowledge of IC, to describe {{advantages and disadvantages of}} the current technology, to clarify technical issues and provide pragmatic solutions for clinical practice and metabolic research. The International Multicentric Study Group for Indirect Calorimetry (ICALIC) has generated this position paper. IC can be performed in in- and out-patients, including those in the intensive care unit, to measure energy expenditure (EE). Optimal nutritional therapy, defined as energy prescription based on measured EE by IC has been associated with better clinical outcome. Equations based on simple anthropometric measurements to predict EE are inaccurate when applied to individual patients. An ongoing international academic initiative to develop a new indirect calorimeter aims at providing innovative and affordable technical solutions for many of the current limitations of IC. Indirect calorimetry is a tool of paramount importance, necessary to optimize the nutrition therapy of patients with various pathologies and conditions.

These patients had received hydrodistension on an average of 2. 3 ± 1. 8 times. Moxa needles were applied to Ciliao in bladder meridian 32 and Xialiao in bladder meridian 34, and electroacupuncture was performed on Zhongliao in bladder meridian 33 at 3 Hz for 20 min once a week. The bladder condition was assessed by the visual analogue scale (VAS) score, the O'Leary-Sant Interstitial Cystitis Symptom Index (ICSI), the Interstitial Cystitis Problem Index (ICPI), and the maximum voided volume (MVV). After 3 months, patients who showed a reduction of > 2 in their VAS score, reduction of 100 ml MVV were considered responders. There were three responders, and after repeated therapy to maintain these effects, they no longer required hydrodistension. Two responders had no recurrence for 48 months or more.

Studies conducted in IC patients have shown that sacral neuromodulation reduces <b>IC</b> symptoms. Both <b>therapies</b> have documents reduction in IC symptoms, but no studies have compared these therapies to see which is more effective. Methods: An evidence-based systematic literature review was conducted using Pubmed, Medline, and Proquest nursing journals. Inclusion criteria for the studies were a peer-reviewed article, publish date of 1990 or later, level 1 or 2 evidence, were diagnosed with IC, and were only treated with either oral PPS or sacral neuromodulation during the study. Patients were excluded if they were on multiple <b>therapies</b> for <b>IC</b> or a non-IC diagnosis. Results: Three PPS studies fit all inclusion criteria. With successful treatment being defined as a 50 % overall improvement in symptoms, studies had a success rate of 26 - 32 %. Four studies fit the criteria for sacral neuormodulation. In these studies 40 - 94 % of the patients had a 50 % improvement in {{one or more of the}} presenting symptoms of IC. Conclusions: PPS and sacral neuromodulation have both been shown to reduce IC symptoms. Sacral neuromodualtion has been shown to have a higher rate of symptom relief in IC patients.
