The 8-year cycle originally employed was replaced by (or by the time of) Augustalis's treatise on the measurement of Easter, after which Rome used his 84-year lunisolar calendar cycle until 457.

25|$|Toyota {{surprised}} the Formula One community by dropping Mike Gascoyne from their technical department after the Melbourne race, {{especially as the}} Englishman had contributed to their rise in competitiveness during 2005. However, the poor performances of the TF106 in the opening two races of the season, particularly in Bahrain where the team had finished on the podium 12 months earlier, prompted disagreement over the team's technical direction. Gascoyne disliked the corporate way the team's management operated while team management were unimpressed by the TF106 car Gascoyne had produced and he was duly dismissed. <b>It</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>for</b> Toyota to replace the technical director, eventually promoting Pascal Vasselon to the role, saying that a technical department run by one man alone was becoming old fashioned.|$|E

25|$|On April 27, 1920, the {{government}} of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic (ADR) received a notice that the Soviet army was about to cross the northern border and invade the ADR. In the west, there was a war over Karbakh with Armenia; in the east, the local Azeri communists were rebelling against {{the government}}; and to the north the Russian Red Army was steadily moving southward having defeated Denikin's White Russian forces. ADR officially surrendered to the Soviets, but many generals and local Azeri militias kept resisting the advance of the Soviet forces and <b>it</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>for</b> the Soviets to stabilize the newly proclaimed Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic.

On December 6, Felix Dzerzhinsky's dreaded secret police, Cheka entered Yerevan, thus effectively ending all existence of the DRA. The Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic was proclaimed, under the leadership of Aleksandr Miasnikyan. On February 25, 1921, the Soviet destruction of the Democratic Republic of Georgia happened.|$|E

500|$|At {{the end of}} the season, Goldman graded it an 8.2 out of 10, {{saying the}} season [...] "found the show much-improved, as it moved faster and delved deeper into the Marvel Cinematic Universe." [...] Compared to the first season, Goldman felt the [...] "pacing was hugely improved, with storylines no longer taking forever to bubble up again and secrets no longer being kept both from the {{audience}} and the characters," [...] with content from the first season being resolved, while still introducing new plot lines and mysteries to play out over the season. He also praised the characterization improvement and called the season [...] "less restrained" [...] in connecting to its comics roots. While he appreciated the new characters that join the series, specifically MacLachlan's portrayal of Cal, he felt Triplett was [...] "never fully utilized", which made his death in the midseason finale less impactful. Additionally, Goldman criticized the tie-in to Age of Ultron, calling it [...] "forced" [...] and distracting from the Inhuman/S.H.I.E.L.D. 2.0 storylines. Nick Hogan at TV Overmind rated the season 9 out of 10 stars, calling it, [...] "for the most part, a very enjoyable season of television." [...] Hogan praised that cast and characters, particularly MacLachlan's portrayal of Calvin Zabo, saying [...] "He had perhaps the strongest character arc of anyone this season, and it was such a pleasure to watch." [...] He did criticize some of the story direction, feeling that <b>it</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>for</b> the Inhumans to connect {{to the rest of the}} series, and that the way the Age of Ultron tie-in concluded the S.H.I.E.L.D. vs. S.H.I.E.L.D. storyline was [...] "rushed and choppy".|$|E
500|$|Atlus's senior {{project manager}} Masaru Nanba commented {{it was decided}} that [...] "Shin Megami Tensei" [...] was to be kept in the title of Persona 3 and Persona 4, as it was {{believed}} that {{they were part of the}} same series as however, the [...] "Shin Megami Tensei" [...] title was omitted from both Persona 4 Golden and Persona 4 Arena, as it would have been much too long. Similarly, Persona 4: The Ultimate in Mayonaka Arena and Persona 4: The Golden were shortened to the previously stated titles. As with Persona 3, the honorifics used in the Japanese voice track were retained in the English dub, despite proving contentions among series fans. This was done as part of an intended trend to remain faithful to the original source material. The pronunciations of honorifics, along with the sounds of names, were a point that was carefully considered by the localization team and <b>it</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>for</b> the English cast to get used to them. A member of the English dub that also appeared in Persona 3 was Yuri Lowenthal. Though he had dubbed characters in Persona 3, Namba wanted him to have a larger part. His role as Yosuke ended up featuring 1000 more lines of dialogue than the other major characters. Important roles for the localization team were Teddie and Rise, as they would be the party's supports. Another element in the English script was that the use of swear words was increased over Persona 3: the first draft featured very strong language which was cut as it did not seem suited. The character Kanji was given a lot of swearing in his dialogue, due to his volatile nature. The use of swearing was carefully considered depending on the emotional situation.|$|E
