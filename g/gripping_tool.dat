40|$|Danielle Christine Bentley, Scott Gordon Thomas Faculty of Kinesiology and Physical Education, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada Abstract: Handgrip (HG) {{exercise}} {{has been}} prescribed as a lifestyle intervention to successfully reduce resting blood pressure (BP) among heterogeneous groups of participants. Current HG protocols have limited accessibility due to complicated exercise prescriptions and sophisticated required equipment. Therefore, this research describes {{the design and}} evaluation of the maximal intermittent (MINT) HG exercise strategy, consisting of both a novel exercise protocol (32 × 5  seconds maximal grip squeezes separated by 5  seconds of rest between sets) and an original <b>grip</b> <b>tool.</b> This research was a multistep progressive design that included 51 postmenopausal women as participants in three separate research studies. Part 1 of this research focuses on the MINT exercise protocol. A literature-informed rationale {{for the design of}} the protocol is described. This includes exercise intensity, work-to-rest ratio, and total exercise duration with reference to the unique physiology (mechanoreflex and metaboreflex) of postmenopausal women. Subsequent experimental analyses of acute responses to the MINT protocol revealed that women produced 50 % of their maximum grip force with moderate cardiovascular responses (increases of systolic BP: 41. 6  mmHg, diastolic BP: 20. 1  mmHg, heart rate: 35. 1  bpm) that remained far below the thresholds of concern identified by the American College of Sports Medicine. Part 2 of this research describes the creation of a novel <b>grip</b> <b>tool,</b> beginning with a mixed-methods assessment of participant opinions regarding two distinct in-laboratory <b>grip</b> <b>tools,</b> leading to the creation of four prototype MINT tools. Structured focus groups revealed a strong preference for MINT prototype  1 for all tool design features, including color, shape, size, and foam grip. Collectively, the result of this multistep research is a novel HG exercise strategy with enhanced accessibility by being easy to understand and simple to execute. The long-term training effectiveness of MINT as an exercise intervention for the reduction of resting BP has yet to be determined.

Also, the specific air {{resistance of the}} shuttlecock is large and its mass is lightweight, weighing approximately 5. 2 g. When the shuttlecock is hit with a racket or launched by a machine at speeds higher than an initial velocity of 30 m/s, the feather parts of the shuttlecock are typically damaged or broken by large impulse load. In this study, a badminton launching machine using a revolving launch arm has been developed with a new launcher mechanism that can discharge at high speeds to reduce {{the damage to the}} shuttlecock feathers.

But how exactly movies manage to get large audiences absorbed, or what is their <b>gripping</b> <b>tool</b> is still a mystery. Research makes use of different concepts pointing to narrative absorption, {{but it is not clear}} how they differ from each other. Moreover, these concepts seem to overlap to a large extent. The present dissertation aims to come up with a clear taxonomy of absorbing experiential states in film, and to identify their textual determinants. This dissertation starts with the assumption that there must be two main forms of narrative absorption in film: 1) story-world and 2) artifact absorption. Story-world absorption involves the feeling of being transported into the story of the film, and feeling with/for the characters; artifact absorption covers being absorbed with understanding film devices from outside the story, like an observer in an art exhibition. While forms of story-world absorption have already been found to strongly correlate with enjoyment and entertainment, artifact absorption is expected to be related to aesthetic appreciation. The dissertation empirically identifies textual determinants of story-world absorption in film, brings light over a vaguely known absorbing experience that is artifact absorption, and introduces the first instrument to measure aesthetic appreciation of film...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of solutions for different handling and assembly processes, used for manipulation of real three dimensional micro objects {{has been investigated}} in this thesis work. The individual micro parts were studied with respect to materials, weight, geometry and dimensions. Handling and assembly at a micro scale are challenging because these processes are dominated by surface forces and not the gravity force, which gives problems such as stiction to the <b>gripping</b> <b>tool.</b> As a consequence, high precision centering and alignment, as well as high accuracy micro assembly with low tolerance are difficult to achieve. A literature survey about handling of micro objects was carried out and {{it was found that}} it is possible to use structured surface to grasp and release micro objects. At DTU a mould with a pyramidal microstructure was available and replicas with two different polymeric materials were produced. A smooth membrane with the same materials used with the pyramid structured one was also manufactured for comparison. It was designed a system to move the membrane and grasp and release micro objects; the system is composed by a piston with spherical end, it slides in a cylinder where at the end the membrane is glued. The system is moved and regulated by a micrometer. The piston bends the membrane so that the desired curvature to achieve grasping and releasing of micro objects is obtained. To understand if the different membranes were influenced by humidity, a drop of water was applied to the surface and, through a digital micro camera, it has been possible to measure the quantity of water in touch with membrane. The membranes were tested. A particular material with both the smooth surface and the grey pyramidal was investigated; the results show that the pyramid structured membrane is more hydrophilic than the grey smooth membrane. Lastly the grasp and release tests with the grey smooth membrane and with the grey pyramidal one, showed that the micro object is grasped equally with two membranes, while it is released with less deformation with the smooth membrane that with the pyramidal one...|$|E

In the literature, many different types of the socalled microgrippers have been presented, based on different working principles, to cope with the issues related to the gripping, the handling and the release of different microcomponents. Depending on the component properties, the task requirements and the system constraints, a microgripper could be more suitable than another and allow the achievement of higher performance. However, the performance assessment of the microgrippers lacks of a standardized and quantitative methodology. Many authors declare the good capabilities of their tools in a qualitative way or according to the results obtained executing specific and different tasks.

Normally, <b>gripping</b> <b>tools</b> provide a rigid connection between a robot and a target. However, {{if there is no}} graspable area on the target, the gripper cannot perform well. To overcome this problem, we proposed a deformable device that works as a universal suction pad and that can hold an ungraspable target by utilizing the jamming transition phenomenon. We determined the effect of the type of grains on the jamming transition phenomenon in terms of stability under jammed conditions. By comparing the four types of grains, we found that the tetrahedral-shaped grains performed the best. Subsequently, we evaluated the performance of the device. The suction force was 166 -N when the proposed device was affixed to a curved target. Next, we evaluated the stiffness of the device. The average deformations of the device were 0. 10 [*]mm, 0. 35 [*]mm, and 0. 04 [*]mm, respectively, when 50 -N downward vertical, horizontal, and upward vertical directional loads were applied to the device, which was affixed to the curved target.
