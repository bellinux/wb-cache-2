5|$|Game Capture HD, which {{connects to}} gaming {{consoles}} to record gameplay, {{was introduced in}} 2012. It was created in response to gamers that were hacking EyeTV products for gameplay recording. The device connects between a <b>gaming</b> <b>console</b> and the TV and {{is powered by a}} USB connection. It captures video as the console sends it to the television, compresses and stores it. A review in iPhone Life gave it 4 out of 5 stars and noted that it could also be used to record iPad games with the right setup.|$|E

25|$|Ubisoft was {{approached}} by Nintendo to develop a mature game for its <b>gaming</b> <b>console,</b> Wii U. Originally envisioned as a spin-off of the Raving Rabbids franchise and a fast-paced first-person shooter, Killer Freaks from Outer Space (with small, agile monsters), the game was retooled as ZombiU after the development team realized that the Wii U GamePad was suitable for slower-paced games. It was influenced by Resident Evil, Demon's Souls, Dark Souls, Left 4 Dead 2, , Metroid, and Montpellier's Peter Jackson's King Kong. London {{was chosen as the}} game's setting because of its blend of modern and medieval architecture and its rich history. Ubisoft Bucharest led development of the game's multiplayer feature.|$|E

25|$|The Nintendo Entertainment System (abbreviated as NES) is an 8-bit {{video game}} console, which {{released}} in North America in 1985, and in Europe throughout 1986 and 1987. The console was initially released in Japan as the Family Computer (abbreviated as Famicom) in 1983. The best-selling <b>gaming</b> <b>console</b> of its time, the NES helped revitalize the US video game industry following {{the video game}} crash of 1983. With the NES, Nintendo introduced a now-standard business model of licensing third-party developers, authorizing them to produce and distribute titles for Nintendo's platform. The NES was bundled with Super Mario Bros., one of the best-selling video games of all time, and received ports of Nintendo's most popular arcade titles.|$|E
25|$|Microsoft DirectX is a {{collection}} of application programming interfaces (APIs) for handling tasks related to multimedia, especially game programming and video, on Microsoft platforms. Originally, the names of these APIs all began with Direct, such as Direct3D, DirectDraw, DirectMusic, DirectPlay, DirectSound, and so forth. The name DirectX was coined as a shorthand term for all of these APIs (the X standing in for the particular API names) and soon became the name of the collection. When Microsoft later set out to develop a <b>gaming</b> <b>console,</b> the X was used as the basis of the name Xbox to indicate that the console was based on DirectX technology. The X initial has been carried forward in the naming of APIs designed for the Xbox such as XInput and the Cross-platform Audio Creation Tool (XACT), while the DirectX pattern has been continued for Windows APIs such as Direct2D and DirectWrite.|$|E

500|$|In 1999, Team Ninja {{started work}} on the [...] "Next-Generation Ninja Gaiden Project". The first stage of {{development}} was to create the game on the Sega NAOMI arcade system board. They then planned to move the project to the Dreamcast console for further development and release, but this was abandoned when Sega announced the end of Dreamcast product line in 2001. At this point, Tecmo decided to release Ninja Gaiden as a launch title for the Sony PlayStation 2 in the United States. Itagaki, however, had other plans; the Team Ninja Leader {{was impressed with the}} software development kits for the Xbox and pushed for his team to develop for the Microsoft console. The company kept silent on this change in direction, and surprised both the games industry and fans when they announced at E3 2002 that Ninja Gaiden would be released exclusively on the Xbox <b>gaming</b> <b>console.</b> Most fans who voted on Tecmo's poll wanted the game on the Nintendo GameCube.|$|E
500|$|The {{decision}} for cooperative gameplay was made part-way through development, {{for a new}} experience in a Resident Evil game. Despite initial concern that a second player would dampen the game's tension and horror, it was later realized that this could actually increase such factors where one player had to be rescued. The decision to retain wide-screen proportions in two-player mode was made to avoid having the first player's screen directly {{on top of the}} second, which might be distracting, and the restriction on simultaneously moving and shooting was retained to increase player tension by not allowing them to maneuver freely. Takeuchi cited the film Black Hawk Down as an influence on the setting of [...] Resident Evil 5 and his experience working on Lost Planet: Extreme Condition as an influence on its development. When questioned as to why the game was not being released on the Wii, which was the most popular <b>gaming</b> <b>console</b> at the time, Takeuchi responded that although that may have been a good decision [...] "from a business perspective", the Wii was not the best choice in terms of power and visual quality, concluding that he was happy with the console choices they had made.|$|E
500|$|Similar to the Genesis and the Mega Jet, the Nomad's main CPU is a Motorola 68000. Possessing similar memory, graphics, {{and sound}} capabilities, the Nomad is nearly {{identical}} to the full-size console; the only variation {{is that it is}} completely self-sufficient. The Nomad has a 3.25 inch backlit color screen and an A/V output that allows the Nomad to be played on a television screen. Design elements of the handheld were made similar to the Game Gear, but included six buttons for full compatibility with later Genesis releases. Also included were a red power switch, headphone jack, volume dial, and separate controller input for multiplayer games. The controller port functions as player 2, so single-player games cannot be played with a Genesis controller. The Nomad could be powered by an AC adapter, a battery recharger known as the Genesis Nomad PowerBack, or six AA batteries, which provide a battery life of two to three hours. The Nomad consumed more power (DC 9V, 3.5W) than Sega's earlier portable <b>gaming</b> <b>console,</b> the Game Gear (DC 9V, 3W). The Nomad also lacks a [...] "Reset" [...] button, which makes it impossible to complete certain games, such as the X-Men video game, which require pressing the button to finish certain objectives.|$|E

In June 1995, Dennis Lynch of the Chicago Tribune and Albert Kim of Entertainment Weekly both praised the Saturn as the most advanced <b>gaming</b> <b>console</b> available, with the former complimenting its double-speed CD-ROM drive and [...] "intense surround-sound capabilities" [...] and the latter citing Panzer Dragoon as a [...] "lyrical and exhilarating epic" [...] demonstrating the ability of new technology to [...] "transform" [...] the industry. In December 1995, Next Generation evaluated the system with three and a half stars out of a possible five, highlighting Sega's marketing and arcade background as strengths but the system's complexity as a weakness. Electronic Gaming Monthlys December 1996 Buyer's Guide had four reviewers rate the Saturn 8, 6, 7, and 8 out of 10; these ratings were inferior to those of the PlayStation, which was scored 9, 10, 9, and 9 in the same review. By December 1998, Electronic Gaming Monthlys reviews were more mixed, with reviewers citing the lack of titles for the system as a major issue.

500|$|At a pre-E3 2005 press conference, the {{president}} of Nintendo, Satoru Iwata, announced the next installment of Super Smash Bros. was not only already in development for their next <b>gaming</b> <b>console,</b> but {{hoped it would be}} a launch title with Wiâ€“Fi compatibility for online play. The announcement was unexpected to the creator of the Super Smash Bros. series, Masahiro Sakurai. Back in 2003, he had left HAL Laboratory, the company that was in charge with the franchises' development and was never informed of this announcement despite the fact shortly after resigning from the company, Iwata said if a new game was to be made, he would be in charge. It was not until after the conference Sakurai was called to Satoru Iwata's room {{on the top floor of}} a Los Angeles hotel, where he was told by Iwata [...] "We'd like you to be involved in the production of the new Smash Bros., if possible near the level of director". Although Iwata had said he was hoping for it to be a launch title, Sakurai stated [...] "I decided to become director. And as of May 2005, I was the only member of the new Smash Bros. development team". Development of the game never actually started until October 2005, when Nintendo opened a new office in Tokyo just for its production. Nintendo also enlisted outside help from various developer studios, mainly Game Arts. Sakurai also stated that these people had spent excessive amounts of time playing Super Smash Bros. Melee. This team was given access to all the original material and tools from the development of Melee, courtesy of HAL Laboratory. Also, several Smash Bros. staff members that reside around the area of the new office joined the project's development.|$|E
500|$|DJ Hero {{primarily}} simulates turntablism, {{a musical}} style used by disc jockeys {{to create a}} new mashup song by incorporating one or more previously recorded songs played on record players along with sound effect generators. The game features score attack gameplay similar to the Guitar Hero games. The controller consists of a wireless deck consisting of a movable turntable that supports 3 [...] "stream" [...] buttons, an effects dial, a crossfader, and a [...] "Euphoria" [...] button; a hidden panel contains additional controller buttons to interact with the <b>gaming</b> <b>console</b> outside of the game. A portion of the controller can be detached and reattached to adapt the unit for left-handed players. Notes travel in an arc across a spinning record on screen, and the player holds down one of the 3 stream buttons to play notes; two buttons reflect the two songs used in that particular mix, and the third represents samples to add to the mix which can be adjusted with the effects dial. The player must also constantly adjust the crossfader to match onscreen symbols, which alters the relative volume of the songs as to bring one song to the forefront of the mix for a short time. Certain tracks are shown on screen as a series of up or down arrow, representing scratching sections, requiring the player to turn the turntable {{in the direction of the}} arrows while holding down the button to score points, mimicking the scratching of the record needle on vinyl albums. [...] "Euphoria" [...] is equivalent to Guitar Heros Star Power, collected by successfully completing specific phrases in the song mix, called Perfect Regions, and can be released by pressing the Euphoria button, doubling the player's current multiplier as well as automatic crossfading when active. There is also a [...] "Rewind" [...] meter that builds through consistent successful playing, and once full, allows the player to rewind the song to fix errors in their performance. The player must continue to perform well or their performance meter will drop and the music track will cut out. Failing the song is not possible, unlike in Guitar Hero games.|$|E
