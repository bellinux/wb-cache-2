40|$|WOMEN ENTREPRENEURSHIP: ASSESSING DATA AVAILABILITY AND FUTURE NEEDS This study {{addresses}} {{an important}} but neglected topic by investigating {{the role of}} women entrepreneurship in the economy. The purpose is twofold. First, based on published research, we have tried to estimate the economic impact of women entrepreneurship. Second, based on this assessment of the current state and in comparison with our needs to better understand this topic, we suggest a number of ways of improving data and statistics on the topic. We find that women entrepreneurship, independent of which economy is examined, represents an important source of new job creation both in terms of self-employment and waged employment. Thus, women entrepreneurs also create jobs for others, and can be very successful in doing so. We have also found that important caveats in our statistics still exist. We therefore encourage policy makers to actively work for the creation of better data, especially those that lend themselves to longitudinal analyses.

40|$|Paper by {{an ad hoc}} TAC Agroforestry Panel on {{institutional}} {{options for}} incorporating agroforestry into {{the mandate of the}} CGIAR. It has a particular focus on ICRAF, one of the non associated centers under consideration for CGIAR support. The paper is complementary to a similar one on forestry research, and a desk study on natural resources conservation and management. It outlines the arguments made about the importance of agroforestry and the changing role of ICRAF, reviews past research, and provides a stocktaking of what institutions are doing in the field, drawn largely from the work of the TAC Forestry Panel. Three possible options are identified: carrying out agroforestry research through existing IARCs, restructuring the CGIAR system into a series of regional/agroecological centers; and combining either of the first two options with a role for ICRAF as a focal point, also continuing hands on research in Africa. The paper addresses the interface between agroforestry and forestry research.

The Agenda, representing the first time a TWH-specific NORA has been created, builds on an earlier draft (Proposed National TWH Agenda) released by NIOSH’s Office for Total Worker Health in September 2014. NIOSH invited stakeholders to provide comment on this <b>draft</b> <b>agenda</b> related to the top priority research, practice, and policy issues to help advance worker safety, health, and well-being. In 2015, in response to stakeholder input received, the TWH definition was expanded and the TWH approach was more finely focused in the final Agenda. The refined description now present in the published Agenda better reflects the priorities of the program and helps to overcome the equating of TWH with traditional workplace wellness programs that fail to integrate worker protection elements. TWH continues to place priority upon a hazard-free work environment that protects the safety and health of all workers. The National Total Worker Health Agenda and NIOSH Response to Summarized Stakeholders’ Comments can be found online.|$|R

More particularly, according to the article 22 of the mentioned law, add-hoc committees are created by {{the decision of the}} National Assembly. The decision should contain information relating to the tasks, terms and procedures of an add-hoc committee, meaning that the committee should operate only in very strict limitations set to the spheres of its investigation, the resources it may gain access to and also to the timeframes.The ultimate reason for existence of such committees is to deliver a report on its finding during a session of the National Assembly.

The agenda of this meeting consisted of an initial session discussing general issues such as the structure of the manual, dissemination formats, etc., followed by a detailed review of the draft chapters. General issues The dual role of the new Manual was discussed once again. It was recognised that the manual would have at least two audiences – it should represent a reference document on CPI theory and practice for all compilers and users of CPIs and a practical guidebook and manual for practitioners not only from developing countries but also from developed countries. Therefore, several participants thought that a high degree of readability must be ensured and maintained throughout the Manual in order to preserve readership. It was also noted that Part II is likely to be more important (at least for less advanced statistical offices) as for many the main purpose of the Manual would be a practical guide for CPI compilation, calculation and dissemination...|$|R

A Disability Caucus consisting of six disability advocacy and stakeholder groups was organized. The work of the Disability Caucus during this time period was instrumental in advocating for references to people with disabilities and disability-related concepts in the Pre-Zero Draft and subsequent documents. In a strongly worded statement leading up {{to the development of the}} Pre-Zero Draft, the Caucus stated “persons with disabilities have remained largely invisible within member states’ disaster risk reduction (DRR) policies and practices under the HFA” (UNISDR 2014 a). In addition, the Disability Caucus pointed out the importance of aligning the SFDRR with Articles 11 and 32 of the United Nations Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) as an international agreement. These recommendations included a call for data disaggregated by disability, the integration of universal design, and accessibility of information and communication for all disaster survivors, including those with disabilities.|$|R

40|$|Thank {{you for the}} {{opportunity}} to review and provide comments on the <b>Draft</b> 2020 Action <b>Agenda</b> for Puget Sound. This is a very comprehensive document with significant and achievable actions in each of the priority areas. Many of the priority areas identified in the <b>Draft</b> Action <b>Agenda</b> are of course priorities for Environment Canada and other agencies north of the border. Given that the Puget Sound and Georgia Basin share a common airshed, common watersheds, a common home for migratory birds and fish, and common urban growth pressures, we recognize the importance of continued transboundary collaboration in addressing our shared challenges. To this end, we are pleased to see that one of the actions under Priority D is to “work cooperatively with Canada on management and scientific investigations to increase collaborative problem solving and information sharing ” (D. 3. 8). A good example of this collaboration is the Joint Statement of Cooperation on the Georgia Basin and Puget Sound Ecosystem, signed in 2000 by Environment Canada and the US Environmental Protection Agency (Region 10). We are also encouraged by the efforts to engage other “partners ” (cities, state agencies, Puget Sound tribes, etc.) in implementing Action Agenda priorities and look forward to exploring opportunities to share information and lessons learned with agencies and groups on this side o...|$|R
