5|$|NY37 was {{assigned}} in 1930 to {{the portion of}} the Theodore Roosevelt International Highway between Redwood and Malone as well as to a previously unnumbered roadway between Watertown and Redwood. The Redwood–Malone portion was originally part of NY3 when the <b>first</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> posted routes in New York were assigned in 1924. NY37 has since been rerouted in areas, primarily near Ogdensburg and Massena.|$|E
5|$|Past {{servicing}} missions have exchanged old {{instruments for}} new ones, both avoiding failure and making possible {{new types of}} science. Without servicing missions, all of the instruments will eventually fail. In August 2004, the power system of the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) failed, rendering the instrument inoperable. The electronics had originally been fully redundant, but the <b>first</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> electronics failed in May 2001. This power supply was fixed during Servicing Mission 4 in May 2009.|$|E
5|$|What is now NY86 from Paul Smiths to Jay via Saranac Lake and Lake Placid was {{originally}} {{part of the}} Theodore Roosevelt International Highway, an auto trail extending across the North American continent from the Pacific Ocean to the Atlantic Ocean.

NY6 was replaced by US9 while NY30 was co-designated as US4 between Glens Falls and Whitehall in 1927 following {{the creation of the}} U.S. Highway System in late 1926. The remainder of modern NY149 was unnumbered prior to 1930.|$|E
5|$|When the <b>first</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> posted {{routes in}} New York were {{assigned}} in 1924, much of Route4—including the Olean–Hinsdale segment—was designated as NY17 while legislative Route17 {{became part of}} NY16, which began in Olean and overlapped with NY17 along former legislative Route4 between Olean and Hinsdale.|$|E

5|$|After {{being trapped}} in the harbour {{for more than a}} year, Great Britain was at last floated out in December 1844, but not before causing more anxiety for her proprietors. After passing {{successfully}} through the <b>first</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> lock gates, she jammed on her passage through the second, which led to the River Avon. Only the seamanship of Captain Claxton (who after Naval service held the position of Quay Warden (Harbour Master) at Bristol) enabled her to be pulled back and severe structural damage avoided. The following day an army of workmen, under the direct control of Brunel, took advantage of the slightly higher tide and removed coping stones and lock gate platforms from the Junction Lock, allowing the tug Samson, again under Claxton's supervision, to tow the ship safely into the Avon that midnight.|$|E
5|$|After the {{outbreak}} of World War II in September 1939, a degaussing coil was installed just above the waterline to protect the ship from magnetic mines. Her first wartime operation saw her participating in laying a minefield off the German coast in the North Sea on 3 September. She conducted the operation with the other light cruisers Nürnberg, Leipzig, Köln, and Königsberg and sixteen destroyers. After laying her <b>first</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> mines, she returned to Wilhelmshaven to restock her mines. While moored in the harbor, she was attacked by British bombers on 4 September; German anti-aircraft gunners shot down {{four of the five}} Blenheim bombers, one of which inadvertently crashed into the ship. Twenty-nine men were killed or wounded in the crash.|$|E

5|$|As a child, Andriantsimitoviaminiandriana {{was sent}} {{to live in a}} village that his father named Ambohimanga. As a young man, his father granted him the region of Avaradrano {{surrounding}} the village, and while his father still lived he managed the daily affairs of state in Avaradrano without taking the title of king. He declared Ambohimanga the capital of the region, building numerous structures on the site and adding its <b>first</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> defensive walls, ditches and gates. The site's historic and cultural significance was recognized in 2001 when UNESCO declared it a World Heritage Site, {{the only one in the}} cultural category in Madagascar. He became an independent king upon his father's death and the resulting partition of the Kingdom of Imerina in 1710, from which he received Avaradrano, the easternmost and largest territory. He died around 1730 and was buried at Ambohimanga.|$|E
5|$|As {{the highest}} award for valour of the United Kingdom, the Victoria Cross {{is always the}} first award to be {{presented}} at an investiture, even before knighthoods, as was shown at the investiture of Private Johnson Beharry, who received his medal before General Sir Mike Jackson received his knighthood. Owing to its status, the VC is always the first decoration worn {{in a row of}} medals and it is the <b>first</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> post-nominal letters used to indicate any decoration or order. Similar acts of extreme valour that do not take place {{in the face of the}} enemy are honoured with the George Cross, which has equal precedence but is awarded second because the GC is newer.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} 12, she {{switched}} to golf, sharing her <b>first</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> golf clubs with her sister—Annika got the odd numbered clubs and Charlotta the even—and earned her first handicap of 54. She was so shy as a junior she used to deliberately three-putt {{at the end of}} a tournament to avoid giving the victory speech. The coaches noticed and at the next tournament both the winner and the runner-up had to give a speech. Sörenstam decided that if she were going to have to face the crowd anyway she might as well win and the deliberate misses stopped.|$|E
50|$|The Australians {{issued a}} <b>first</b> <b>setting</b> <b>of</b> the {{overprint}} on 17 October 1914, {{followed by a}} second setting (with slightly different spacing) on 16 December. In all, they produced some 50 distinct stamps.|$|R

5000|$|... ("The noble heart"), WAB 66, {{is a song}} {{composed}} by Anton Bruckner in December 1857 during his stay in Linz. During his stay in St. Florian, Bruckner had already composed a <b>first</b> <b>setting</b> <b>of</b> the song for men's choir, WAB 65.|$|R
5|$|By {{the late}} 12th century the Bigod family {{had come to}} {{dominate}} Suffolk, holding {{the title of the}} Earl of Norfolk and owning Framlingham and three other major castles at Bungay, Walton and Thetford. The <b>first</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> stone buildings, including the first hall, were built within the castle during the 1160s. Tensions persisted throughout the period, however, between the Crown and the Bigods. Hugh Bigod was {{one of a group of}} dissenting barons during the Anarchy in the reign of King Stephen, and after coming to power Henry II attempted to re-establish royal influence across the region. As part of this effort, Henry confiscated the four Bigod castles from Hugh in 1157, but returned both Framlingham and Bungay in 1165, on payment of a large fine of £666.|$|E
5|$|Commander Keen in Invasion of the Vorticons is {{a three-part}} episodic side-scrolling {{platform}} video game developed by Ideas from the Deep (a precursor to id Software) {{and published by}} Apogee Software in 1990 for MS-DOS. It is the <b>first</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> episodes of the Commander Keen series. The game follows the titular Commander Keen, an eight-year-old child genius, as he retrieves the stolen parts of his spaceship from the cities of Mars, prevents a recently arrived alien mothership from destroying landmarks on Earth, and hunts down {{the leader of the}} aliens, the Grand Intellect, on the alien home planet. The three episodes feature Keen running, jumping, and shooting through various levels while opposed by aliens, robots, and other hazards.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{awarding}} of the contract, a preliminary design review {{was carried out in}} September 1972, followed by a critical design review in September 1976 after which the engine's design was set and construction of the <b>first</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> flight-capable engines began. Final review of all the Space Shuttle's components, including the engines, was conducted in 1979. The design reviews operated in parallel with several test milestones, initial tests consisting of individual engine components which identified shortcomings with various areas of the design, including the HPFTP, HPOTP, valves, nozzle and fuel preburners. The individual engine component tests were followed by the first test of a complete engine (0002) on March 16, 1977. NASA specified that, prior to the Shuttle's first flight, the engines must have undergone at least 65,000 seconds of testing, a milestone that was reached on March 23, 1980, with the engine having undergone 110,253 seconds of testing by the time of STS-1 both on test stands at Stennis Space Center and installed on the Main Propulsion Test Article (MPTA). The <b>first</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> engines (2005, 2006 and 2007) were delivered to Kennedy Space Center in 1979 and installed on , before being removed in 1980 for further testing and reinstalled on the orbiter. The engines, which were of the first manned orbital flight (FMOF) configuration and certified for operation at 100% rated power level (RPL), were operated in a twenty-second flight readiness firing on February 20, 1981, and, after inspection, declared ready for flight.|$|E
