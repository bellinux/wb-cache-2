40|$|ABSTRACT OBJECTIVE To {{characterize}} the workforce in the pharmaceutical {{services in the}} primary care of the Brazilian Unified Health System (SUS). METHODS This is a cross-sectional and quantitative study, with data from the Pesquisa Nacional sobre Acesso, Utilização e Promoção do Uso Racional de Medicamentos – Serviços, 2015 (PNAUM – National Survey on Access, Use and Promotion of Rational Use of Medicines – Services, 2015). For the analysis, we considered the data stratification into geographical regions. We analyzed the data on workers in the municipal pharmaceutical services management and in the medicine <b>dispensing</b> <b>units,</b> according to the country’s regions. For the statistical association analysis, we carried out a Pearson correlation test for the categorical variables. RESULTS We analyzed 1, 175 pharmacies/dispensing units, 507 phone interviews (495 pharmaceutical services coordinators), and 1, 139 professionals responsible for medicine delivery. The workforce in pharmaceutical services was mostly constituted by women, aged from 18 to 39 years, with higher education (90. 7 % in coordination and 45. 5 % in <b>dispensing</b> <b>units),</b> having permanent employment bonds (public tender), being {{for more than one}} year in the position or duty, and with weekly work hours above 30 h, working both in municipal management and in medicine <b>dispensing</b> <b>units.</b> We observed regional differences in the workforce composition in <b>dispensing</b> <b>units,</b> with higher percentage of pharmacists in the Southeast and Midwest regions. CONCLUSIONS The professionalization of municipal management posts in primary health care is an achievement in the organization of the workforce in pharmaceutical services. However, significant deficiencies exist in the workforce composition in medicine <b>dispensing</b> <b>units,</b> which may compromise the medicine use quality and its results in population health...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT OBJECTIVE To {{characterize}} the medicine dispensing {{services in the}} primary health care network in Brazil and in its different regions, aiming to promote the access and rational use of medicines. METHODS This is a cross-sectional, quantitative study with data obtained from the Pesquisa Nacional sobre Acesso, Utilização e Uso Racional de Medicamentos (PNAUM – National Survey on Access, Use and Promotion of Rational Use of Medicines), 2015. Observation visits were carried out in 1, 175 <b>dispensing</b> <b>units,</b> and interviews were held with 1, 139 professionals responsible for the dispensation of medicines in the <b>dispensing</b> <b>units</b> and 495 municipal coordinators of pharmaceutical services. RESULTS More than half (53 %) of the units presented a space smaller than 10 m 2 for dispensing of medicines; 23. 8 % had bars or barriers between users and dispenser; 41. 7 % had computerized system; and 23. 7 % had counters for individual care. Among those responsible for dispensation, 87. 4 % said they always or repeatedly inform users {{how to use the}} medicines, and 18. 1 % reported developing some type of clinical activity. Isolated pharmacies presented a more developed physical and personal structure than those belonging to health units, but we found no significant differences regarding the information provided and the development of clinical activities. CONCLUSIONS There are major differences in the organization models of dispensation between cities, with regional differences regarding the physical structure and professionals involved. The centralization of medicine dispensing in pharmacies separated from the health services is associated with better structural and professional conditions, as in the <b>dispensing</b> <b>units</b> of the South, Southeast, and Midwest regions.

5000|$|A Satellite Bale Wrapper usually {{consists}} of hydraulic driven bale supporting rollers and a Hydraulic driven rotating satellite arm which carries the plastic film roll and <b>Dispensing</b> <b>unit.</b> The {{rotation of the}} support rollers and the satellite arm are synchronized so that an even cover of plastic film {{is applied to the}} bale as the wrapping process takes place. High speed satellite wrappers have two rotating satellite arms which effectively halves the time taken to wrap a bale.|$|E
50|$|The wrapper has a loading arm, {{much like}} a bale handler, at the side, that scoops up a bale and places it on the {{wrapping}} table. The wrapping table usually consists of two rollers, and four belts which slowly spin the bales while the table itself revolves. As the bale turns, plastic film is pulled through the <b>dispensing</b> <b>unit</b> and wrapped tightly on the bale. When the table has revolved at least 16 times, the bale can be ejected. This is done by a hydraulic ram which tilts the wrapping table, so that the bale can be tipped off. The film is cut and then tied to the wrapper for the next bale. All this is controlled via a computer inside the cab of the tractor.|$|E
5000|$|Sarvajal is {{a social}} {{enterprise}} that provides clean water through Water ATM’s. The Water ATM is in essence a modular RFID controlled standalone water <b>dispensing</b> <b>unit.</b> It is very simple to use, and like any usual ATM the customer swipes a prepaid card {{on the screen and}} chooses the amount of water one wishes to dispense. The RFID device sends a GPRS message to the SEMS server (Sarvajal Enterprise Management System) which authorizes the transaction instantly. This server keeps a record of the user’s transaction and deducts the amount used on the card. The plant works on a reverse osmosis and UV based filtration technology. The water is filtered through 5 stages and the quality is in accordance with the international drinking water quality standard, IS 10500. Two patents for this technological innovation has been filed - one for the RFID based remote sensing & quality control and the second for the ATM dispensing system. Sarvajal presently operates in Gujarat, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh.|$|E

50|$|The main {{obstacle}} to adoption of immersion lithography systems has been defects and other possible sources of yield loss. Early studies {{focused on the}} elimination of bubbles in the immersion fluid, temperature and pressure variations in the immersion fluid, and immersion fluid absorption by the photoresist. Degassing the fluid, carefully constraining the fluid thermodynamics and carefully treating {{the top layer of}} photoresist have been key to the implementation of immersion lithography. Defects intrinsic to immersion lithography have been identified. Reducing particle generation due to the water <b>dispensing</b> <b>unit</b> was found to reduce the incidence of defects. Water also has been shown to extract acid from photoresist. Specifically, photoacid generators (PAGs) are extracted into the water, which produce acid upon radiation exposure. This must be managed to ensure the lens is not corroded by the acid or contaminated by the extracted agents, and the photoresist is not chemically altered {{to the point of being}} defective. Still, since diffusion of contaminants is expected to be much slower in water than in air or vacuum, consideration of optics contamination actually favors immersion lithography. Water-soaked photoresist also has been demonstrated to produce very satisfactory images.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT OBJECTIVE To {{characterize}} {{the infrastructure of}} the primary health care pharmacies of the Brazilian Unified Health System, aiming at humanizing the offered services. METHODS This is a cross-sectional study, of quantitative approach, from data obtained in the Pesquisa Nacional de Acesso, Utilização e Promoção do Uso Racional de Medicamentos – Serviços, 2015 (PNAUM – National Survey on Access, Use and Promotion of Rational Use of Medicines – Services, 2015). Information on 1, 175 pharmacies/dispensing units were gathered from direct observation and assessment of <b>dispensing</b> <b>units</b> installations conducted by trained researchers who used a standardized form. The analyzed variables refer to the physical structure of pharmacies or medicine <b>dispensing</b> <b>units</b> of the health units under research. RESULTS The pharmacy area was greater than 14 m 2 in 40. 3 % of the sampled units, highlighting those from Midwest (56. 9 %) and Southeast (56. 2 %) regions and those of Northeast, with only 23. 3 %. About 80. 2 % units had waiting rooms with chairs for patients, 31. 8 % of them had dispensing areas inferior to 5 m 2, while in 46. 2 % these areas were superior to 10 m 2. Bars were found in service counters in 23. 8 % of health units, thus separating the patient from the professional; 44. 1 % had internet access. In most units, the area of medicine storage had no refrigerator or freezer for their exclusive storage and 13. 7 % had a specific room for pharmaceutical consultation. CONCLUSION Aiming at achieving care humanization and improving working conditions for professionals, the structuring of the environment of pharmacy services is necessary. This would contribute to the better qualification of pharmacy services, comprising more than medicine delivery. Data on the Northeast region indicated less favorable conditions {{to the development of}} adequate dispensing services.

25|$|Although {{the capital}} outlay can be high, it is {{desirable}} to use a meter-mix or <b>dispense</b> <b>unit</b> for even low-volume production operations that require a steady output of finished parts. Dispense equipment consists of material holding (day) tanks, metering pumps, a mix head, and a control unit. Often, a conditioning or heater-chiller unit is added to control material temperature {{in order to improve}} mix efficiency, cure rate, and to reduce process variability. Choice of dispense equipment components depends on shot size, throughput, material characteristics such as viscosity and filler content, and process control. Material day tanks may be single to hundreds of gallons in size, and may be supplied directly from drums, IBCs (intermediate bulk containers, such as totes), or bulk storage tanks. They may incorporate level sensors, conditioning jackets, and mixers. Pumps can be sized to meter in single grams per second up to hundreds of pounds per minute.

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} the {{development}} of active liquid aspiration and <b>dispensing</b> <b>units</b> designed for vertical, as well as lateral, liquid aspiration. The devices {{are based on a}} single-use thermally expanding polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) composite, which allows altering its surface topography by means of individually addressable integrated heaters. Devices are designed in order to create an enclosed cavity in the system, due to locally expanding the initially unstructured composite. This enables negative volume displacement and leads to the event of liquid aspiration. To enable this device functionality, two different techniques of selectively creating permanent PDMS bonds have been developed. One approach utilizes the plasma-assisted PDMS bonding technique, together with a patterned antistiction layer to form reversibly, as well as irreversibly, bonded regions. Another approach utilizes microcontact printing of PDMS curing agent, which serves as a patterned intermediate layer for adhesive bonding. Fabricated prototype devices successfully demonstrated the aspiration and release of liquid volumes ranging from 28 to 815 nL. The devices are entirely fabricated from low-cost materials, using wafer-level processes only and do not require external means for liquid actuation. QC 20100817 </p...|$|R

50|$|Continuous reinforcement: A single operant {{response}} triggers the dispense {{of a single}} dose of reinforcer. A time-out period may follow each {{operant response}} that successfully yields a dose of reinforcer; during this period the lever used in training may be retracted preventing the animal from making further responses. Alternatively operant responses will fail to produce drug administration allowing previous injections to take effect. Moreover, time-outs also help prevent subjects from overdosing during self-administration experiments. Fixed-ratio studies require a predefined number of operant responses to <b>dispense</b> one <b>unit</b> of reinforcer. Standard fixed ratio reinforcement schedules include FR5 and FR10, requiring 5 and 10 operant responses to <b>dispense</b> a <b>unit</b> of reinforcer, respectively.Progressive ratio reinforcement schedules utilize a multiplicative {{increase in the number}} of operant responses required to <b>dispense</b> a <b>unit</b> of reinforcer. For example, successive trials might require 5 operant responses per unit of reward, then 10 responses per unit of reward, then 15, and so on. The number of operant responses required per unit of reinforcer may be altered after each trial, each session, or any other time period as defined by the experimenter. Progressive ratio reinforcement schedules provide information about the extent that a pharmacological agent is reinforcing through the breakpoint. The breakpoint is the number of operant responses at which the subject ceases engaging in self-administration, defined by some period of time between operant responses (generally up to an hour).Fixed interval (FI) schedules require that a set amount of time pass between drug infusions, regardless of the number of times that the desired response is performed. This “refractory” period can prevent the animal from overdosing on a drug.Variable interval (VI) schedules of reinforcement are identical to FI schedules, except that the amount of time between reinforced operant responses varies, making it more difficult for the animal to predict when the drug will be delivered.|$|R
