5|$|The Senne/Zenne (French/Dutch) was {{historically}} {{the main}} waterway of Brussels, {{but it became}} more polluted and less navigable as the city grew. By {{the second half of}} the 19th century, <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>become</b> <b>a</b> serious health hazard and was filled with pollution, garbage and decaying organic matter. It flooded frequently, inundating the lower town and the working class neighbourhoods which surrounded it.|$|E

5|$|The city of Vijithapura, {{which the}} Mahavamsa {{refers to as}} Vijitha Nagara, had been founded nearly three hundred {{years ago by the}} brother in law of king Panduvasudeva.

It {{is said to have been}} {{surrounded}} by three moats and a wall with a height of 18 cubits. The wall had four wrought iron gates on the north, south, east and west. The Rajavaliya describes Vijithapura as a fortress second only to Anuradhapura.|$|E

5|$|By 1654 a small open-air fruit-and-vegetable {{market had}} {{developed}} {{on the south}} side of the fashionable square. Gradually, both the market and the surrounding area fell into disrepute, as taverns, theatres, coffee-houses and brothels opened up. By the 18th century <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>become</b> <b>a</b> well-known red-light district. An Act of Parliament was drawn up to control the area, and Charles Fowler's neo-classical building was erected in 1830 to cover and help organise the market. The market grew and further buildings were added: the Floral Hall, Charter Market, and in 1904 the Jubilee Market. By the end of the 1960s traffic congestion was causing problems, and in 1974 the market relocated to the New Covent Garden Market about three miles (5km) south-west at Nine Elms. The central building re-opened as a shopping centre in 1980 and is now a tourist location containing cafes, pubs, small shops, and a craft market called the Apple Market, along with another market held in the Jubilee Hall.|$|E
5|$|During 26 December, the Fiji Meteorological Service {{started to}} monitor a {{tropical}} depression that had developed within the Intertropical Convergence Zone, about 575km (355mi) to the south-east of Nauru. Over {{the next few}} days the depression gradually developed and organised further, as it moved towards the west-southwest under the influence of a north-easterly steering flow. During 28 December, the JTWC classified the depression as Tropical Cyclone 05P, before the FMS named it Rewa as <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>become</b> <b>a</b> category 1 tropical cyclone on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale. Over {{the next few days}}, the system gradually intensified under the influence of favourable upper-level winds while it moved towards the south-southwest, passing through the Solomon Islands on 29December and affecting the southeastern islands of Papua New Guinea. As it moved through the Solomon Islands, Rewa moved out of the South Pacific basin and into the Australian region, where the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) took the primary warning responsibility for the system.|$|E

5|$|Initially, Cecil was {{forecast}} {{to maintain}} a northward track into a weakness in a subtropical ridge left behind by Typhoon Brenda; however, Cecil turned westward on May23 due to another ridge over China. With favorable atmospheric conditions, Cecil continued to intensify through May24. By 0600UTC, a ragged 75km (45mi) wide eye developed over the center of circulation, indicating <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>become</b> <b>a</b> typhoon. The storm ultimately attained peak winds of 140km/h (85mph) while situated just {{off the coast of}} central Vietnam. However, the JMA reported Cecil to have been slightly weaker, classifying it as a severe tropical storm with ten-minute sustained winds of 110km/h (70mph). Around 1800UTC, the storm made landfall near Hoi An with winds of 130km/h (80mph). Once onshore, Cecil quickly weakened to a tropical depression. Turning slightly to the west-northwest, the remnants of Cecil continued inland before dissipating over eastern Laos early on May26.|$|E
5|$|Matilda {{helped to}} deal with several {{diplomatic}} crises. The first of these involved the Hand of St James, the relic which Matilda had brought back with her from Germany many years before. Frederick I, the Holy Roman Emperor, considered the hand {{to be part of}} the imperial regalia and requested that Henry return it to Germany. Matilda and Henry were equally insistent that it should remain at Reading Abbey, where <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>become</b> <b>a</b> popular attraction for visiting pilgrims. Frederick was bought off with an alternative set of expensive gifts from England, including a huge, luxurious tent, probably chosen by Matilda, which Frederick used for court events in Italy. She was also approached by Louis VII of France, in 1164, and helped to defuse a growing diplomatic row over the handling of Crusading funds.|$|E
5|$|Multi-purpose types {{like the}} Charolais and the Morvan were slowly supplanted in farmers' favor by draft horses. The Nivernais breed, in particular, was {{preferred}} by farmers and threatened {{the existence of}} the Charolais. Thus, the original small multi-purpose strain of Charolais gave way to a type of small draft horse that was next crossed with purebred and crossbred Thoroughbreds until, by 1850, <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>become</b> <b>a</b> horse for cavalry purposes. It was thought by some enthusiasts, however, that this outcrossing reduced the quality of the breed, and many missed the old-style Charolais, which had disappeared {{due to a lack of}} demand and use. However, others thought that the outcrossings had benefited the Charolais breed: in 1919, one author stated that the breeding of the Charolais type was in excellent condition, and a report from the time stated that the favorite horse of King Albert I of Belgium was a Charolais named Titanic.|$|E

5|$|TSS did not became {{operational}} {{again until}} 1982, when the International Cospas-Sarsat Programme {{made use of}} the station. The Ministry of Trade and Industry took {{a renewed interest in}} the satellite station in the early in 1980s and proposed in 1982 that Norway join ESA's European Remote-Sensing Satellite (ERS) program. This started the process of Norway becoming a full member of ESA in 1987. The telemetry station received investments of NOK100 million during the 1980s and was organized as a foundation in 1984. It took the name Tromsø Satellite Station in 1988. Part of the goal of the project was to create technical spin-offs; the one successful company was Spacetec, which had 45 employees {{at the time it was}} bought by Kongsberg Defence & Aerospace in 1994. By then <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>become</b> <b>a</b> global manufacturer of Earth observation ground stations.|$|E
5|$|The {{arrival of}} the {{railways}} in 1870 precipitated a massive growth in seaside and summer visitors to the town, especially from the Midlands and London. In 1880 the town had a population of 17,000, but by 1900, when railway connections to Bournemouth were at their most developed, the town's population had risen to 60,000 and <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>become</b> <b>a</b> favourite location for visiting artists and writers. The town was improved greatly during this period {{through the efforts of}} Sir Merton Russell-Cotes, the town's mayor and a local philanthropist, who helped to establish the town's first library and museum. The Russell-Cotes Art Gallery & Museum was housed in his mansion, and after his death it was given to the town. Bournemouth became a municipal borough in 1890 and a county borough in 1900.|$|E
5|$|The marked {{spread of}} dengue {{during and after}} the Second World War has been {{attributed}} to ecologic disruption. The same trends also led to the spread of different serotypes of the disease to new areas, and to the emergence of dengue hemorrhagic fever. This severe form of the disease was first reported in the Philippines in 1953; by the 1970s, <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>become</b> <b>a</b> major cause of child mortality and had emerged in the Pacific and the Americas. Dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome were first noted in Central and South America in 1981, as DENV-2 was contracted by people who had previously been infected with DENV-1 several years earlier.|$|E

5|$|During October 20, 2006 the Fiji Meteorological Service and the United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center {{started to}} monitor a {{tropical}} depression, that had developed within the South Pacific Convergence Zone {{to the north}} of Temotu Province in the Solomon Islands. The system was located within an area of low to moderate vertical wind shear and had a good outflow in its northern and eastern quadrants. Over the next day conditions surrounding the system rapidly became favourable for further development, with convection starting to wrap into a well defined low level circulation centre. As a result, the depression rapidly developed further and was named Xavier by the FMS during October 22, after <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>become</b> <b>a</b> category 1 tropical cyclone on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale. After the system was named the JTWC initiated advisories on the system and designated it as Tropical Cyclone 01P, while it was located over the Santa Cruz Islands. Throughout October 22, Xavier's rapid intensification continued with it developing an eye feature and becoming a category 3 severe tropical cyclone. During that day the system performed a small cyclonic loop over Temotu Province and passed near or over the Santa Cruz Island of Tikopia.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1900s, Wye Road {{followed}} the alignment of present-day 76Avenue out of Edmonton to the east, enroute to North Cooking Lake. By the 1920s <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>become</b> <b>a</b> secondary unsurfaced thoroughfare, {{and was later}} named Highway 14. As Edmonton and the newly developed Sherwood Park grew in the late 1960s, a free-flowing road, Sherwood Park Freeway, was built to link the two on a new alignment of Highway14 several hundred meters north of Wye Road. The cloverleaf interchange at the freeway's east end was completed in 1965, and the remaining interchanges were completed in 1968. It was four lanes wide and included an additional interchange immediately east of 17Street that has since been removed. After completion of Sherwood Park Freeway, the existing Highway14 (76Avenue) was renamed to Highway14A. Further south, Whitemud Drive was constructed and eventually extended east to reach Highway14. It then assumed the designation of Highway14 to a new terminus at Calgary Trail. The Highway14A designation has since been removed from 76Avenue, and the portion of Sherwood Park Freeway within Strathcona County was eventually renumbered Highway100.|$|E
5|$|The {{site where}} Mysore Palace now stands was {{occupied}} by a village named Puragere {{at the beginning of}} the 16th century. The Mahishūru Fort was constructed in 1524 by Chamaraja Wodeyar III (1513–1553), who passed on the dominion of Puragere to his son Chamaraja Wodeyar IV (1572–1576). Since the 16th century, the name of Mahishūru has commonly been used to denote the city. The Mysore Kingdom, governed by the Wodeyar family, initially served as a vassal state of the Vijayanagara Empire. With the decline of the Vijayanagara Empire after the Battle of Talikota in 1565, the Mysore Kingdom gradually achieved independence, and by the time of King Narasaraja Wodeyar (1637) <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>become</b> <b>a</b> sovereign state. Seringapatam (modern-day Srirangapatna), near Mysore, was the capital of the kingdom from 1610. The 17th century saw a steady expansion of its territory and, under Narasaraja Wodeyar I and Chikka Devaraja Wodeyar, the kingdom annexed large expanses of what is now southern Karnataka and parts of Tamil Nadu, to become a powerful state in the southern Deccan.|$|E

5|$|By the 1920s, in bottled form, Worthington {{was one of}} {{only three}} nationally {{distributed}} beer brands, alongside Bass and Guinness. Product rationalisation began after the Second World War and although Worthington occasionally overtook Bass in sales, the decision was taken to prioritise Bass products. Arthur Manners took the chairmanship of Bass in 1947, and was instrumental in driving the company forward. Brewing industry mergers from the late 1950s onwards damaged Worthington sales, as tied house ownership became increasingly concentrated with brewers intent on promoting their own products. At the same time, bottled beer sales suffered as drinkers in search of consistency opted for the new keg beers instead. In 1965, the original Worthington brewery was closed, although production of the Worthington beers continued, consisting of White Shield, Green Shield (a filtered version of White Shield) and the draught product, E. Worthington E became the main keg bitter offered by Bass from 1967, and <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>become</b> <b>a</b> leading bitter brand by the 1970s, boosted by the company's network of 11,000 public houses. Worthington E was replaced as Bass' leading keg bitter by Worthington Best Bitter in the 1980s, and by Worthington Smoothflow from the mid-1990s. In 2000, Bass was bought by the Belgian brewer Interbrew. The Competition Commission ordered Interbrew to divest itself of a number of its recently acquired brands, and Worthington was bought by the American brewer Coors, who later became Molson Coors in 2005. In 2004 Coors announced that they would no longer advertise Worthington on a large scale.|$|E
