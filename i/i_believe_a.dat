500|$|The {{composer}} (and former Sibelius pupil) Leevi Madetoja further {{praised the}} score upon review, writing in Uusi Suometar in July 1914 that Sibelius, rather than [...] "repeat endlessly" [...] {{the style of}} his previous works, had yet again shown his penchant for [...] "renewing himself musically... always forward, striving for new aims". The Finnish critic Karl Wasenius (aka BIS), writing in Hufvudstadsbladet after the birthday celebration performances of 1915, wrote approvingly of Sibelius's [...] "refined mastery" [...] of technique. [...] "Not a single note is wasted on brash effects", Wasenius continued. [...] "Yet mighty things are still achieved. Sibelius gives us the expanse and magnitude of the ocean, its powerful wave-song but without boastful gestures. He is too noble for that". In Tidning för musik, Otto Anderssen interpreted Sibelius's latest compositions (among them The Oceanides) as yet another indicator that {{he was among the}} most forward-looking modernists: [...] "Sibelius is, <b>I</b> <b>believe,</b> <b>a</b> man of the future... constantly ahead of his time. Now he stands at the heights where the horizon stretches out over fields which the rest of us cannot yet see". Cecil Gray, moreover, calls the piece [...] "daring" [...] and applauds the score's [...] "exceptional complexity and refinement", challenging critics who see Sibelius as a [...] "primitive artist".|$|E
500|$|Livingstone {{describes}} himself as a socialist. In 1987, he stated that [...] "politics is my religion. It's my moral framework. <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>a</b> socialist society is inherently the best thing, and that's like an act of faith." [...] In 2007, he stated that [...] "I still believe one day that the idea that the main means of production are owned by private individuals... will be considered as anti-democratic as the idea serfs could be tied to the land. But I will not be alive when that day comes." [...] Livingstone had always worked towards a unified socialist front on the British left, and disliked the tendency towards splintering and forming rival factions, usually over issues of political theory, among the socialist community. Although rejecting Marxism, throughout his political career he has worked alongside Marxist far-left groups and has become involved with the [...] "politics of the street". He has not worked with those Marxist groups, such as the Socialist Workers Party and the Revolutionary Communist Party, who advocate the destruction of the Labour Party as the way forward for socialism, seeing their beliefs as incompatible with his own. Livingstone has consistently opposed the actions of the Israeli government. In a 2005 interview {{he said that he was}} not against the existence of Israel, but rather Ariel Sharon's government; he recalled that on his 1986 visit to the country he got on well with its left-wing politicians.|$|E

Whether we win or lose in the South, we cannot afford to ignore public opinion in the southern states, because it influences national public opinion, and that opinion finally decides the election.... It is said that southern Democrats will not vote for a Republican candidate. They have frequently done so. They did so in Little Rock last November [...] when they elected Pratt Remmel mayor. I refuse to admit that if the issues are clearly presented, the southern voters will not vote on the basis of principle....|$|E

2500|$|This {{allegation}} surfaced after Stone {{announced he}} would no longer direct the Weinstein Company's Guantanamo TV series following the revelation of the Harvey Weinstein sexual misconduct allegations. Stone also drew criticism for defending Weinstein the day before he announced his departure from Guantanamo at the Busan International Film Festival as well, claiming [...] "I'm a believer that you wait until this thing gets to trial. <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>a</b> man shouldn't be condemned by a vigilante system. It's not easy what he's going through, either. During that period he was a rival. I never did business with him and didn't really know him. I've heard horror stories on everyone in the business, so I'm not going to comment on gossip. I'll wait and see, which {{is the right thing to}} do." ...|$|E
2500|$|An entirely {{different}} type of person was Virendranath Chattopadhyay, member of a famous family in India. Popularly known as Chatto {{he was a very}} able and a very delightful person. He was always hard up, his clothes were very much the worse for wear and often he found it difficult to raise the wherewithal for a meal. But his humour and light heartedness never left him. He had been some years senior to me during my educational days in England. He was at Oxford when I was at Harrow. Since those days he had not returned to India and sometimes a fit of homesickness came to him when he longed to be back. All his home-ties had long been severed and it is quite certain that if he came to India he would feel unhappy and out of joint. But in spite of the passage of time the home pull remains. No exile can escape the malady of his tribe, that consumption of the soul, as Mazzini called it ... Of the few I met, the only persons who impressed me intellectually were Virendranath Chattopadhyay and M.N. Roy. Chatto was not, <b>I</b> <b>believe,</b> <b>a</b> regular communist, but he was communistically inclined.|$|E
