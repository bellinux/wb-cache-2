The current study examined whether dismissal and its follow-up for the employee (re-employment versus unemployment) could be predicted from workers' employment contract and age, and their health status, work ability, work performance, work satisfaction and <b>employee</b> <b>investments</b> at baseline. METHODS: Our sample comprised a selection of participants from the Netherlands Working Conditions Survey 2010 who participated in a follow-up questionnaire in 2012 (N= 2, 644). We used logistic regression analyses to test our hypotheses. RESULTS: Temporary employment, low health status, low work ability, poor work performance, low work satisfaction and no <b>employee</b> <b>investments</b> in terms of training predicted future dismissal. Furthermore, older workers and workers reporting decreased work performance due to impaired health at baseline had a lower chance of re-employment after being dismissed. Interestingly, after taking into account all predictors, former temporary workers without permanent employment prospects had much better chances of re-employment after their dismissal than former permanent workers. CONCLUSIONS: Temporary, less healthy, low work ability, poor performing, dissatisfied and "under-invested" workers are at risk for dismissal, whereas older and less healthy workers are (also) at risk for long-term unemployment after being dismissed...|$|R

40|$|We {{focus on}} the {{regulatory}} use of finance theory, particularly the efficient market hypothesis (EMH), in two related areas where securities pricing is at issue: shareholder appraisal cases {{and the use of}} employer stock in company-sponsored <b>employee</b> <b>investment</b> plans. Regarding shareholder appraisal cases we find that the Delaware courts seem to implicitly respect the principles of EMH when ascertaining the fair value of stock, but recognize that markets cannot operate efficiently if information is withheld. In addition, the concurrent fiduciary duty claims often brought in these cases involve high levels of scrutiny where conflicts of interest are raised. Regarding employer stock in company-sponsored <b>employee</b> <b>investment</b> plans our focus is on the explicit adoption of EMH by the Department of Labor (DOL) to exempt directed trustees from historic duties of inquiry regarding the prudence of investment directions. Our inquiry finds that the Delaware courts and legislators believe that informational problems can necessitate fact-specific analyses of whether market price reflects fair value. In contrast, the DOL appears to believe, almost without exception, in the efficiency of markets for all publicly traded securities. As a result, its policies protect from liability fiduciaries who otherwise would have incentives to engage in reviews that could be expected to bring additional information to the markets...|$|E

40|$|Previous {{studies of}} <b>employee</b> <b>investment</b> in {{retirement}} plans suggest that people typically "naively diversify " their investment funds, tending to allocate 1 /n {{of the total}} to each of n available instruments (Benartzi & Thaler, 2001). In this paper we provide experimental evidence that this bias extends to allocation among simple chance prospects and demonstrate three new violations of rational choice theory implied by use of the naïve diversification strategy. Study 1 demonstrates “partition dependence ” in which participants ' allocations among a fixed set of investments varies with the hierarchical structure of the option set (e. g., by vendor and instrument). Study 2 demonstrates “unit dependence ” in which participants ' preferred allocations vary with the metric in which the investment is reported (dollars versus number of shares). Study 3 demonstrates “procedure dependence ” in which the bias toward even allocation disappears if participants are asked to choose from a menu of possible portfolios. We show that these results extend to sophisticated participants, simple well-specified gambles and incentivecompatible payoffs.

40|$|Strategy {{research}} suggests that firm-specific human capital {{is a source of}} sustained competitive advantage, at least in part because it may constrain employee mobility. However, it is also typically assumed that employees are reluctant to invest in firm-specific skills because such investments may come at the cost of developing general skills, thereby reducing their attractiveness in the labor market. This creates a theoret-ical paradox: <b>Employee</b> <b>investment</b> in firm-specific human capital is crucial for value creation and appropriation, yet there is believed to be global underinvestment in firm-specific skills. We argue that the logic behind this theory depends on the assumption that firm-specific human capital is accurately and objectively perceived among labor market participants and that relaxing this assumption significantly limits conclusions that can be drawn about competitive advantage. The key takeaway is that perceptions of firm specificity, even if inaccurate, can be more important than objective firm-specific hu-man capital in determining the likelihood that firm-specific human capital can be a source of sustained advantage. By relaxing the assumption of strong-form labormarket efficiency, we develop propositions regarding how firms can facilitate and manag...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: We {{study the}} {{relationship}} between past returns on a company’s stock {{and the level of}} investment in that stock by the participants in that company’s 401 (k) plan. Using data on 94, 191 plan participants, we analyze several different decision points: the initial fraction of savings allocated to company stock, the changes in this fraction, and the reallocations of portfolio holdings across different asset classes. Like Benartzi (2001), we find that high past returns on company stock induce participants to allocate more of their contributions to company stock. We also find, however, that high returns on company stock have the opposite effect on reallocations of portfolio holdings, with high returns leading to shifts away from company stock and into other forms of equity. Overall, for company stock decisions, participants in our sample appear to be momentum investors when making contribution decisions and contrarian investors when making Recent high-profile cases have illustrated the dangers of <b>employee</b> <b>investment</b> in company stock.

40|$|In this paper, {{employees}} {{are considered to}} be able to invest into certain forms of their own human capital, one of those being specific to their organization (‘firm specific’), and the other specific to their current managers (‘manager specific’).

As relationships between the enterprise and the {{employees are}} becoming more cooperative, the presented model of <b>employee</b> <b>investment</b> in human capital includes the variables of enterprise preference, the investment cost and the proportion of the investment output which the enterprise distributes to the employees. By using the mechanisms of the cooperative game, this paper studies the problems of the output proportion which the enterprise distributes to the employees and the optimal investment ratio of the employees’ investments into the forms of human capital specific to the firm and managerial environment.

40|$|This paper derives a {{statistical}} discrimination model {{that includes the}} self selection that results when employees optimally choose which jobs to apply for. We show that in such a model, a simple yardstick like di®erences in average quali¯cations does not guarantee {{that members of the}} worse quali¯ed group are always discriminated against. Strong conditions on group di®erences (MLRP must hold) are required to ensure that statistical discrimination against members of a single group will result. Furthermore, the resulting statistical discrimination is smaller than what would result in an economy in which employees do not select the jobs they apply for. It is possible that the statistical discrimination can be a factor in reducing group di®erences because when the statistical discrimination favors the group that is worse quali¯ed on average there is an incentive for the members of such a group to invest in education. When employers ' ability to measure quali¯cations di®ers from one group to another, we show that the group employers know least about is favored. Consequently any endogenous quality di®erences that might result from <b>employee</b> <b>investment</b> decisions favors the less familiar group.

40|$|With {{the rising}} {{share of the}} service sector in the global economy, best {{practices}} in production, human resource management (HRM) and marketing are copied from manufacturing and applied to service industries. As the production and marketing of services involve human interaction between producer and consumer, the question is relevant {{to what extent the}} marketing function intersects with production and HRM functions. A particular strand of research deals with the relationship between employee versus customer satisfaction. If the two are found to be mutually reinforcing, then company policies should take that fact into consideration. Motivation of staff hinges on a joint effort of production, HRM and marketing managers. And in reverse, staff motivation is a key element in successful marketing. The empirical study of a leading Chinese securities firm on which this article is based, tests the relationship between employee satisfaction, customer satisfaction, and their joint impact on profitability. The findings indicate that employee satisfaction and customer satisfaction are positive correlated, and both of them {{have a positive impact on}} profitability.

40|$|The {{potential}} {{significance of}} employers' collective action for economic performance is widely acknowledged, {{but has not}} been complemented with corresponding theory-guided research on the probability of collective action and the conditions for effective action. This thesis examines the nature of, the conditions for, {{and the consequences of}} employers' collective action on further training, a crucial component of a successful high-skill strategy for industries and nations. The study addresses three core issues of labour economics: transferability of training, skill shortages, and sharing of training costs between employer and employees. The enquiry builds on and adds to previous contributions that analyse transferable training as a collective good. It scrutinises the theoretical foundation and compares its implications with those of human capital theory. Finally, the empirical study of further education and training in four Norwegian industries is offered as a strategic test of these two alternative theories. The collective action perspective shares core assumptions of human capital theory, but integrates the possibility of collective action as a solution to some of the market failures associated with investment in transferable human capital. This alternative view also predicts in what labour market settings such action is likely to occur, building on Olson's work and theories of employers' collective action. The collective action perspective differs crucially from human capital theory by predicting that transferability is endogenous i. e. significantly shaped by employers' individual and collective action, and not simply by technology. Thus, 'endogenous transferability' is a principal link between the constitution of labour markets and employers' choice of training and skill supply strategies. The results confirm the prediction that transferability is 'endogenous'. Moreover, they suggest that employers' collective action is more likely to succeed in ensuring transferability and encouraging <b>employee</b> <b>investment</b> than is using sanctions against employers to promote employer-financed transferable training...|$|E
40|$|Financial {{researchers}} {{agree that}} allocating money to employer stock in a 401 (k) {{plan is a}} poor strategy, yet many employees do so. Not only does this investment strategy bear unrewarded idiosyncratic risk, but it also correlates employees' retirement portfolios with their human capital. I find evidence that this selection {{is influenced by the}} investment preferences of peers, which includes both management at the firm and employees at other firms headquartered in the same city. Specifically, the percentage allocated to company stock by employees in the 401 (k) plan is positively related to both the net open-market purchases of company stock by management and the average allocation to company stock in 401 (k) plans by employees at other firms headquartered in the same city. Surprisingly, the allocation to company stock in 401 (k) plans increases with investment in employee stock ownership plans (ESOPs), which are a dominant substitute since they often offer stock at a discount. To identify the cause of this relationship between employees and management, I provide additional support for the peer effects hypothesis through interaction tests. The relationship between employees and management is influenced by distance between peers and trust within the firm - two factors that alter group cohesion and, in turn, the effect of peer influence. These results are robust to size of the firm and also exist for the subsample of firms that have only made matching contributions in cash. Consistent with our understanding of the inertia that exists in <b>employee</b> <b>investment</b> decisions, employee allocations to company stock are influenced for many years by management's initial investment choices made near the time of going public. Lastly, alternative methodologies, including propensity score matched samples and panel regressions, yield the same conclusions...|$|E

We test whether WTA also influence investments because innovations are expressed by investments and the latter affect productivity. Influence on firms’ costs is also relevant, especially for employee wages. Our last step is to test a relationship between profits and WTA. If there is a significantly positive correlation between these two indicators, we have strong evidence that WTA are beneficial for firms. As a supplement, interaction models are estimated. This means the WTA dummy is multiplied by specific firm’s characteristics and incorporated in the profit function. So we can prove whether WTA effects differ in establishments with typical characteristics from others.|$|R
