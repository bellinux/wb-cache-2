5|$|Fossils {{from the}} Pleistocene {{suggest that this}} species bred further south in Europe in the cool periods between glaciations than <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>now.</b> Its {{sensitivity}} to changing climate {{as well as to}} water table levels and the speed of vegetation growth has led to suggestions that its range is affected by global warming, and the ruff might act as an indicator species for monitoring climate change. Potential threats to this species may also include outbreaks of diseases to which it is susceptible such as influenza, botulism and avian malaria.|$|E
5|$|When US12 was {{designated}} in Michigan on November 11, 1926, {{along with the}} other original US Highways, it ran along a more northerly course. It originally replaced sections of the original M-11 and M-17 along Michigan Avenue in the state, the route of the much older St. Joseph Trail, a footpath used by Native Americans before European settlement in the area. It entered from Indiana as <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>now,</b> but it followed the Lake Michigan shoreline farther north to Benton Harbor–St. Joseph before turning eastward to run through Kalamazoo, Battle Creek and Jackson. In the Ann Arbor area, it followed a more northerly path into Detroit before terminating downtown. In the 1940s and 1950s, sections of the highway were converted into expressways and freeways. Starting in 1959, these freeway segments were renumbered as part of I-94, and in January 1962, US12 was shifted to replace US Highway112 (US112). That highway, when it {{was designated}} in 1926 replaced the original M-23 along the Chicago Road. Later, US112 replaced the first M-151 when the former was extended to New Buffalo in the mid-1930s. Since 1962, the highway has remained relatively unchanged aside from minor truncations in the city of Detroit. US112 previously had two business loops, both of which were renumbered Business US12 (Bus. US12) in 1962. In 2010, the Niles business loop was decommissioned, but the one in Ypsilanti remains. One section of the former US112 was renumbered US112S for a few years in the 1930s.|$|E
25|$|For some time, the Regiment of Artillery {{commanded}} a significantly {{larger share of}} the Army's personnel than <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>now,</b> as it was also responsible for air defense artillery and some aviation assets. The 1990s saw the formation of the Corps of Army Air Defence and the coalescing of all aviation assets into the Army Aviation Corps. The arm is now focused on field artillery, and supplies regiments and batteries to each of the operational commands. The home of the Regiment is in Nashik, Maharashtra, where their headquarters is located along with the service's museum. The School of Artillery of the Indian Army is located nearby in Devlali.|$|E

25|$|SH-67 {{was first}} {{commissioned}} on May 21, 1936, {{serving in the}} same capacity—connecting US 75 to US 64 south of Tulsa—as <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>now,</b> though with a much different route. The original SH-67 began at US-75 in Mounds (US-75 at the time using the present-day route of US-75ALT) and continuing east through far southern Tulsa County, reaching US-64 south of Bixby. The first extension to SH-67 occurred just over one month into the highway's life, on June 23, 1936. This extended the designation north along US-75 to Sapulpa. From here, it ran concurrent with US-66 out of town, splitting from US-66 to follow present-day SH-33 (which at this time followed SH-51 en route to downtown Tulsa) and {{coming to an end}} in Drumright.|$|E
25|$|Further {{expansion}} of US 1 Alternate occurred {{as a result}} of Interstate highway construction. The alternate route was expanded to a divided highway on either side of its interchange with I-695 when that interchange was constructed between 1956 and 1958. This interchange included all of the ramps {{on the east side of}} the interchange, but on the west side it also included ramps from southbound US 1 Alternate to westbound I-695, from southbound US 1 Alternate to eastbound I-695, and from eastbound I-695 to Sulphur Spring Road, which passed closer to the Interstate than <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>now.</b> The I-695–US 1 Alternate interchange was reduced to its present ramps after the I-95–I-695 interchange, including that interchange's ramp to relocated Sulphur Spring Road, was completed in 1971. Most of the Caton Avenue portion of US 1 Alternate was expanded to a divided highway in 1972 in conjunction with the completion of the western half of I-95's interchange with US 1 Alternate. The eastern half of the I-95 interchange was completed in 1977 when I-95 was extended east to Russell Street.|$|E
25|$|The PLA Navy {{was ranked}} in 1987 {{as the third}} largest navy in the world, {{although}} naval personnel had comprised only 12 percent of PLA strength. In 1987 the Navy consisted (as <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>now)</b> of the naval headquarters in Beijing; three fleet commands – the North Sea Fleet, based at Qingdao, Shandong; the East Sea Fleet, based at Ningbo; and the South Sea Fleet, based at Zhanjiang, Guangdong – and about 2,000 ships. The 350,000-person Navy included Naval Air Force units of 34,000 men, the Coastal Defense Forces of 38,000, and the Marine Corps of 56,500. Navy Headquarters, which controlled the three fleet commands, was subordinate to the PLA General Staff Department. In 1987, China's 1,500km coastline was protected by more than 100 diesel-powered Romeo- and Whiskey-class submarines, which could remain at sea only a limited time. Inside this protective ring and within range of shore-based aircraft were destroyers and frigates mounting Styx anti-ship missiles, depth-charge projectors, and guns up to 130mm. Any invader penetrating the destroyer and frigate protection would have been swarmed by almost 900 fast-attack craft. Stormy weather limited the range of these small boats, however, and curtailed air support. Behind the inner ring were Coastal Defense Force personnel operating naval shore batteries of Styx missiles and guns, backed by ground force units deployed in depth.|$|E

2500|$|The {{ball was}} also hard to hit because {{pitchers}} could manipulate it before a pitch. For example, the spitball pitch was permitted in baseball until 1921.

2500|$|When then may {{this change}} be {{supposed}} to have been made? It was not made in the time of Innocent I (401-417); it had already occurred when the Gelasian Sacramentary was written (7th century); it may be taken for certain that in the time of St. Gregory I (590-604) the Canon already stood as <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>now.</b> The reason for believing that Innocent I still knew only the old arrangement is that in his letter to Decentius of Eugubium (Patrologia Latina, XX, 553-554) he implies that the Intercession comes after the Consecration. He says that the people for whom we pray [...] "should be named {{in the middle of the}} holy mysteries, not during the things that go before, that by the very mysteries we should open the way for the prayers that follow". If the diptychs are read after the way has been opened by the holy mysteries, the Roman Canon must follow the same order as the Church of Antioch, and at any rate place the [...] "Commemoratio vivorum" [...] after the Consecration.
