This wasn’t a parody, it was “Good God, how can I find a <b>different</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> gunslinger?” Right away, I thought of a woman gunslinger, and the idea for the script came to me all of a sudden. It was the sheriff’s wife. He’s killed and she takes over for her husband. It was logical when it wasn’t, but that was enough for a six-or seven-day western.|$|E
5|$|During 1929, most of {{the major}} European filmmaking {{countries}} began joining Hollywood in the changeover to sound. Many of the trend-setting European talkies were shot abroad as production companies leased studios while their own were being converted or as they deliberately targeted markets speaking different languages. One of Europe's first two feature-length dramatic talkies was created in still a <b>different</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> twist on multinational moviemaking: The Crimson Circle was a coproduction between director Friedrich Zelnik's Efzet-Film company and British Sound Film Productions (BSFP). In 1928, the film had been released as the silent Der Rote Kreis in Germany, where it was shot; English dialogue was apparently dubbed in much later using the De Forest Phonofilm process controlled by BSFP's corporate parent. It was given a British trade screening in March 1929, as was a part-talking film made entirely in the UK: The Clue of the New Pin, a British Lion production using the sound-on-disc British Photophone system. In May, Black Waters, a British and Dominions Film Corporation promoted as the first UK all-talker, received its initial trade screening; it had been shot completely in Hollywood with a Western Electric sound-on-film system. None of these pictures made much impact.|$|E

25|$|Islamic {{scholarship}} {{had inherited}} Aristotelian physics from the Greeks {{and during the}} Islamic Golden Age developed it further, especially placing emphasis on observation and a priori reasoning, developing early forms of the scientific method. With Aristotelian physics, physics was seen as lower than demonstrative mathematical sciences, {{but in terms of}} a larger theory of knowledge, physics was higher than astronomy; many of whose principles derive from physics and metaphysics. The primary subject of physics, according to Aristotle, was motion or change; there were three factors involved with this change, underlying thing, privation, and form. In his Metaphysics, Aristotle believed that the Unmoved Mover was responsible for the movement of the cosmos, which Neoplatonists later generalized as the cosmos were eternal. Al-Kindi argued against the idea of the cosmos being eternal by claiming that the eternality of the world lands one in a <b>different</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> absurdity involving the infinite; Al-Kindi asserted that the cosmos must have a temporal origin because traversing an infinite was impossible.|$|E

Woese argued that this group of prokaryotes is a fundamentally <b>different</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> life.

Though an animal, the Gravemind's somewhat plantlike appearance has drawn comparisons to Audrey II from the 1986 film Little Shop of Horrors due to the tentacles about a central mouth. For Halo 2: Anniversary, the Gravemind now has three flesh-flaps that protrude and dangle towards the front of its head, each one decorated with teeth.

The sprinters' teams worked to chase down the morning breakaway, but the only effect this actually had was allowing Van Avermaet, and others, a shorter distance to bridge from the main field up {{to the front of the}} race. The leading group's advantage over the peloton never exceeded two minutes, but it proved to be enough as Van Avermaet took the win ahead of 's Marco Marcato, with the next rider a further 15 seconds down. Van Avermaet was also the team's best finisher at the Italian races which traditionally conclude the season. He just missed out on victory at the Giro del Piemonte, finishing second of 11 riders in a breakaway sprint behind Daniel Moreno of [...] He was more distant, 12th, in the Giro di Lombardia, though this was nonetheless a strong result for him due to that race's much hillier profile.|$|E
500|$|In {{the final}} section Heilmann seeks to {{synthesize}} {{the information in the}} previous three sections to uncover the probable origins in a particular group of ancestors. In doing so he discusses the specific morphology of a hypothetical creature, which he refers to as [...] "the proavian", that must have existed between modern birds and their reptilian ancestors. After making a bold assertion that birds are descended from reptiles, Heilmann cites Dollo's Law as the primary reason why he believes birds cannot be descended from theropod dinosaurs, despite their many morphological similarities. Dollo's Law states that a feature or organ once lost by evolution cannot be regained. One consistently confounding issue Heilmann had encountered in his research into the bird-reptile link was that modern birds possess a wishbone and theropod dinosaurs, by his observations, did not. Since ancient reptilian fossils that predated dinosaurs clearly possessed a <b>different</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> wishbone, Heilmann concluded that this feature could not have been lost and regained again over the course of evolution. Based on this law, he therefore rejected the possibility of a direct theropod ancestor of birds, though he acknowledged that theropods and birds must have shared a close relationship.|$|E

She explained that the most [...] "amazing" [...] element was not the [...] "blockbuster wow!" [...] but instead the [...] "intimate awww." [...] Claudia Puig of USA Today explained that [...] "as {{a new chapter in}} the superpowered arachnid saga, it stands on its own quite nicely, focusing more on human emotions than on a panoply of special effects." [...] She said [...] "where Tobey Maguire in the original Spider-Man trilogy was earnest, Garfield's Spider-Man is whip-smart and likably cheeky, with an undercurrent of teenage angst." [...] She also called the film [...] "as much a coming-of-age story as a crime-fighting action saga." [...] Christy Lemire of the Associated Press described Garfield's Spider-Man as an arrogant and misunderstood outsider, giving the film a [...] "restless, reckless energy and a welcome sense of danger." [...] She also concluded that Webb was a <b>different</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> director, saying that while Webb's big set pieces lacked Raimi's imagination, they conveyed [...] "emotional truth" [...] and [...] "a pervasive sense of humanity". However, Ty Burr of The Boston Globe felt that the film lacked the original's pop grace and the pulpy joy, saying the film was [...] "dumbed down, tarted up" [...] and [...] "almost shockingly uninspired". Burr evaluated it as [...] "the worst superhero film since Green Lantern". Colin Covert of the Star Tribune also felt that The Amazing Spider-Man is weaker than its predecessor and described it as [...] "The Notebook in spandex". Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times felt that the reboot provided better reasons for why Peter Parker adopts his superhero role, even if the origin story didn't need to be told once again. He also remarked that it was [...] "probably the second best" [...] of the four Spider-Man films after Spider-Man 2, explaining that Lizard was lackluster compared to that film's villain, Doctor Octopus, and had the dramatic range of Godzilla.|$|E
