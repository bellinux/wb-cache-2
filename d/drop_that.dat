5|$|Discussion about {{splitting}} the route into two {{started in the}} early in 1960s. The Public Roads Administration {{felt that it was}} unnecessary to have a cross-fjord service, as at the time there was a road from Vangshylla to Levanger which sufficed. The administration was also in the process of building a road from Kjerringvik to Venneshamn, which would allow the ferry to <b>drop</b> <b>that</b> service. On 1 June 1964, the service was split in two: Vangshylla–Kjerringvik and Hokstad–Levanger. At the same time, the service was upgraded to a national road connection, and the full responsibility for funding was transferred to the ministry. The Vangshylla–Kjerringvik service was taken over by Innherredsferja, while the Hokstad–Levanger service was taken over by Innherredsferja II. In 1968, the state granted sufficient guarantees to allow a new ferry to be purchased. In the same year, the road from Framverran via Venneshamn to Kjerringvik was opened. The new ferry was similar to Innherredsferja II; it was built in Kristiansund for NOK1,555,000 and originally named Skarnsund. Innherredsferja was sold to an operator in Agder for NOK50,000. At the same time, Fremverran and Venneshamn were transferred from the municipality of Verran to Mosvik, while Ytterøy, Skogn and Frol merged with Levanger.|$|E

From the intersection with Woodcalm Street southward, the eastbound direction branched off to follow Cass Avenue two blocks to the south of Oakland Avenue. At the northern end of downtown, Bus.

The loop is shaped like an upside-down tear <b>drop</b> <b>that</b> is about four blocks wide at the northern end tapering to a single intersection at the south. Wide Track Drive also carried the two directions of Business Loop Interstate 75 (BL I-75) around downtown Pontiac between Woodward Avenue and Perry Street. The two directions of BL I-75/Bus.

Upon discovering the object, a deactivated robotic creature called a [...] "golem", the three adventurers escort Emma and their discovery back to Adlehyde to exhibit it at the town's Ruin Festival.

In order to spare the remaining people of Adlehyde, Cecilia gives Belselk her family heirloom, a pendant called the Tear <b>Drop</b> <b>that</b> has magical properties which the demons believe can be used as a catalyst for reviving their leader. Gurdijeff: With the Tear Drop, it is possible. The demons, however, are trying to use it to revive their master, the Mother.

40|$|Drag {{and drop}} {{operation}} {{is one of}} the key capabilities of any Graphical User Interface. The user can do quite complex operations simply by visually dragging and dropping objects from one location to another. It saves user from remembering and typing a lot of commands. The result of a drag and drop operation may vary depending the type of source object and type of destination object. For example dragging a file and dropping on a folder may copy or move the file to the destination folder, <b>dropping</b> <b>that</b> file to a remote FTP location may upload that file using internet, <b>dropping</b> <b>that</b> file on a printer icon may print <b>that</b> file, <b>dropping</b> <b>that</b> file on the trash can may delete <b>that</b> file, and <b>dropping</b> <b>that</b> file on an executable may play or open or compute or manipulate that file. Although a drag and drop operation prima facie seems to be a simple operation, it can become extremely complicated depending on the type of source objects dragged and the type of destination objects selected for dropping. There are many limitations of a conventional drag and drop operation. This article points out the difficulties of a drag and drop operation and illustrates the solutions disclosed by various inventions to overcome those difficulties.
