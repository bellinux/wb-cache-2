Our studies suggest that FRTL 5 cells contain 2 principal types of cell surface TSH receptors. One form, probably a precursor, consists of a single polypeptide chain (Mr 120 000) with an intrachain loop of amino acids formed by a <b>disulphide</b> <b>bridge.</b> The other type of receptor consists of a water-soluble A chain (Mr 55000) linked to an amphiphilic B chain (Mr 35000) by a <b>disulphide</b> <b>bridge.</b> The 2 chain structure is probably derived from the single chain 120 000 protein by enzymatic cleavage of peptide sequences within the loop of amino acids formed by the intrachain <b>disulphide</b> <b>bridge...</b>|$|R
40|$|Native enzyme and a mutant {{containing}} {{an extra}} <b>disulphide</b> <b>bridge</b> of recombinant Saccharomycopsis fibuligera R 64 α-amylase, designated as Sfamy 01 and Sfamy 02, respectively, have successfully been overexpressed in the yeast Pichia pastoris KM 71 H. The purified α-amylase variants demonstrated starch hydrolysis {{resulting in a}} mixture of maltose, maltotriose, and glucose, similar to the wild type enzyme. Introduction of the <b>disulphide</b> <b>bridge</b> shifted the melting temperature (TM) from 54. 5 to 56 °C and nearly tripled the enzyme half-life time at 65 °C. The two variants have similar kcat/KM values. Similarly, inhibition by acarbose was only slightly affected, with the IC 50 of Sfamy 02 for acarbose being 40 ± 3. 4 μM, while that of Sfamy 01 was 31 ± 3. 9 μM. On the other hand, the IC 50 of Sfamy 02 for EDTA was 0. 45 mM, nearly two times lower than that of Sfamy 01 at 0. 77 mM. These results show that the introduction of a <b>disulphide</b> <b>bridge</b> had little effect on the enzyme activity, but made the enzyme more susceptible to calcium ion extraction. Altogether, the new <b>disulphide</b> <b>bridge</b> improved the enzyme stability without affecting its activity, although minor changes in the active site environment cannot be excluded...|$|R

40|$|The {{activity}} of the chloroplast H+-ATPase (CFoCF 1) is regulated by the proton electrochemical membrane potential and the reduction or {{the formation of the}} <b>disulphide</b> <b>bridge</b> on the gamma-subunit mediated by chloroplast thioredoxins (Trx). The latter regulation also applies to the water-soluble portion of CFoCF 1 (CF 1) and includes two successive steps, namely the binding of Trx to CF 1 and the subsequent reduction or oxidation of CF 1. To study this process thoroughly, a new expression system for spinach Trx-f and Trx-m was designed. In the presence of dithiothreitol (DTT) both forms of the expressed Trx could reduce the <b>disulphide</b> <b>bridge</b> on the gamma-subunit of CF 1 and thus activate the ATPase. Trx mutants deficient in the internal, or both, cysteines of the active site were designed to study the details of the interaction. The Trx mutant proteins could still activate CF 1 -ATPase in the presence of DTT and they also increased the apparent affinity of CF 1 for DTT. This implies that the binding of Trx to the CF 1 gamma-subunit induces a conformational change facilitating the reduction of the <b>disulphide</b> <b>bridge,</b> and partially explains the high efficiency of Trx as a reductant in vivo...|$|R

40|$|Lepidopteran insects show {{remarkable}} {{resistance to}} radiation and chemical stress than insects of other orders. Despite this, the antioxidant machinery of insects of this order is poorly understood. Recently we demonstrated {{the significance of}} cytoplasmic NOS and a stronger mitochondrial antioxidant enzyme system in the stress-resistance of Lepidopteran insects. In the present study, we hypothesize two thioredoxin peroxidase orthologues (Sf-TPx 1 and Sf-TPx 2) in Lepidopteran insect Spodoptera frugiperda and demonstrate their structural/functional features important for cellular antioxidant activity and stress resistance. Results show a higher mitochondrial localization score (WoLFPSORT) of Sf-TPx 2 (mitochondria- 18. 0, cytoplasm- 7. 0, nucleus- 4. 0) than its Drosophila orthologue Jafrac 2 (secretory- 30. 0; mitochondria/nucleus/cytoplasm-no signal), which is important for antioxidant activity, and a higher cytoplasmic localization score of Sf-TPx 1 (mitochondria-no signal; cytoplasm- 22. 0; nucleus- 3. 5) than the Drosophila Jafrac 1 (mitochondria- 17; nucleus- 11; cytoplasm-no signal). Structural modeling data show certain motifs present in Jafrac 1 and Jafrac 2 that affect active site conformation and separate cysteine residues at distances not suitable for <b>disulphide</b> <b>bridge</b> formation (5. 21 Å; 5. 73 Å). These motifs are absent in Sf-TPx 1 and Sf-TPx 2, yielding shorter distance (2. 01 Å; 2. 05 Å) between the cysteine residues suitable for <b>disulphide</b> <b>bridge</b> formation. Taken together, the <b>disulphide</b> <b>bridge</b> as well as mitochondrial and cytoplasmic localization are crucial for peroxidatic activity of TPx's. Therefore,we hypothesize that the Spodoptera TPx's offer potentially stronger anti-oxidant activity than that of Drosophila orthologues, and may contribute in the high radioresistance of Lepidopteran insects...|$|R
40|$|Gaegurin 5 (GGN 5) is a {{cationic}} 24 -residue anti-microbial peptide {{isolated from}} {{the skin of a}} Korean frog, Rana rugosa. It contains a central proline residue and an intra-residue <b>disulphide</b> <b>bridge</b> in its C-terminus, which are common to the anti-microbial peptides found in Ranidae. We determined the solution structure of GGN 5 bound to SDS micelles {{for the first time and}} investigated the role of proline, cysteine and a <b>disulphide</b> <b>bridge</b> on the structure and activity of GGN 5. GGN 5 adopts an amphipathic alpha-helical structure spanning residues 3 - 20 kinked around Pro- 14, which allows the hydrophobic residues to reside in the concave helical region, and a disulphide-bridged loop-like conformation in its C-terminus. By replacement of proline with alanine (PAGGN 5), a straight and rigid helix was formed in the central region and was more stable than the kinked helix. Reduction of a <b>disulphide</b> <b>bridge</b> in the C-terminus (GGN 5 SH) maintained the loosely ordered loop-like conformation, while the replacement of two cysteines with serines (CSGGN 5) caused the C-terminal conformation to be completely disordered. The magnitude of anti-microbial activity of the peptides was closely related to their helical stability in the order PAGGN 5 >GGN 5 >GGN 5 SH>CSGGN 5, suggesting that the helical stability of the peptides is important for anti-microbial activity. On the other hand, the significant increase of haemolytic activity of PAGGN 5 implies that a helical kink of GGN 5 could be involved in the selectivity of target cells. The location of GGN 5 and PAGGN 5, analysed using paramagnetic probes, was mainly at the surface of SDS micelles, although the location of the N-terminal region was slightly different between them...|$|R

The serine-binding reagent diethyl p-nitrophenyl phosphate was a potent inhibitor of PGE.

PGE was not inhibited by the thiol reagents 5, 5 '-dithiobis(2 -nitrobenzoic acid) or 4, 4 '-dithiopyridine. A partial inhibition with dodecyldithio- 5 -(2 -nitrobenzoic acid) was observed, but the same degree of inhibition was caused by the non-esterified fatty acid C(12 : 0). PGE shows a great sequence similarity to gastric lipases. Gastric lipases have three cysteine residues, and two of these form a <b>disulphide</b> <b>bridge.</b> Blocking the remaining free cysteine with thiol reagents inactivates the gastric lipases. The fact that PGE is not inhibited by thiol reagents indicates that PGE has no functional free thiol group.

40|$|Abstract: A weak but {{significant}} similarity {{was found between}} the prion protein (PrP) and some transcription factors and zinc-finger proteins. A possible interpretation of this similarity is that the PrP is a metal- (copper-) binding transcription factor and might behave like a Zn-finger protein, with the Cu 2 + binding to its histidine and serine residues. Copper-binding could create intramolecular bridges in the PrP C (normal, cytoplasmic) molecule, but intermolecular bridges in the PrP Sc (scrapie pathogenic) molecule. A molecular model of the Cu 2 +-binding monomeric PrP C and the Cu 2 +-stabilised polymeric PrP Sc is presented here and named the ‘cuprion model’. In this model, the PrP C has two idioforms. The stable, normal PrP C-idioform-I contains Cu 2 + in- 2 His-Cu 2 +- 2 His- complexes and an intramolecular <b>disulphide</b> <b>bridge.</b> An unstable, transient form, PrP C-idioform-II, contains a- 2 His-Cu 2 +- 2 Cys- complex, which destabilises the intramolecular <b>disulphide</b> <b>bridge</b> and makes the PrP C molecule highly reactive with other PrP C molecules...|$|R
