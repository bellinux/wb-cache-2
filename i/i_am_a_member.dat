2500|$|A lifelong bachelor, Savile {{lived with}} his mother (whom he {{referred}} to as [...] "The Duchess") and kept her bedroom and wardrobe exactly as it was when she died. Every year he had her clothes dry cleaned. Savile's personal relationships were rarely the subject of media report or comment in his lifetime.

The Protestants, Unionists and Loyalists who come from that area are happy to call themselves Derrymen. It was a matter that did not provoke excitement and it certainly was not taken as being an offensive remark {{to say that one}} was from Derry. Then, in the 1960s, as part of a deliberate campaign by Republicans to loosen the London connection, they emphasised that they had dropped the name London from the name of the city. As a result, the Unionist community emphasised the London part of the name." ...|$|E

He says that he [...] "was disgusted and angry. Either <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>a</b> <b>member</b> of the party or I'm not. Do I have a different ideology or different politics because I am an Arab Jew? It's segregation, I thought, just like a Negroes' Department. I turned around and walked out. That was the start of my open protests. That same year I organized a demonstration in Ashkelon against Ben-Gurion's racist policies and 10,000 people turned out." ...|$|E

Jiang Qing produced the anti-communist statement that Bo had signed in 1937 with the Kuomintang in order to secure his release from prison, accusing him of [...] "betraying the party" [...] and making him an easy target for persecution. On February 9, 1967, Kang Sheng and his associates organized a rally in the Beijing Workers Stadium to criticize and [...] "struggle against" [...] Bo. Bo was paraded through the stadium with an iron plaque around his neck describing his [...] "crimes", but he was more defiant than most victims persecuted by Red Guards, and demanded (unsuccessfully) to speak in his own defense. While being paraded he shouted: [...] "I am not a traitor! <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>a</b> <b>member</b> of the Communist Party!" [...] Bo's insistence that he was a loyal Communist Party member and that Mao had approved all of his actions created a chaotic atmosphere, and the rally was cancelled after three minutes.|$|E

[...] Asked what it means to have played an important part in the football traditions at both Minnesota and Michigan, Daley said: [...] "It means a lot to me. Both programs have been so wonderful to me long after I played. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>a</b> <b>member</b> of both Hall of Fames and that is very special." [...] Daley said his one disappointment about his college football career was that he never played on a team that beat Notre Dame. [...] In 1943 Michigan lost to Notre Dame, 35-12.
