30|$|Table  2 {{shows that}} at {{vertical}} {{position of the}} jet pump {{the efficiency of the}} pump decreases if the depth of the pump is decreased. It also shows that the <b>discharge</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> increases when depth is increased. A 10 % increase in flow caters to 15 % increase in head over the pump. This is explained as with larger head it provides larger length of the pipe which carries kinetic energy of the fluid for longer time. Hence, jet pump works better at higher depth and deliver large amount of fluid. At this condition, the corresponding increase in suction flow rate is of order of 30 – 38 %. This means that at greater depth in this case 15 % increase the force due to buoyancy make the valve opening easy accommodating larger flux of fluid to get in. This leads to 6 to 7 basis point increase in efficiency from its base point. Likewise, the efficiency and <b>discharge</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> curiously have nearly the same magnitude at horizontal position and vertical position. It is because once the flow commences through the foot valve, of the two components: vertical and horizontal flows, one component of flow becomes zero while the other is active. But when the jet pump is at 450 both the component remains and there is less fluid loss. This ensures that efficiency is marginally better for 450 at greater depth. In this case it is around 4 % better. All throughout the experiment, the injection rate is kept constant so its influence is not accounted here with. Nevertheless, it is expected that at larger injection power the above outcome will be magnified.|$|E

Several days of traffic data collected at a work zone near Pacific, Missouri with a speed limit of 50 mph were analyzed in both the eastbound and westbound directions. As a result, a total of eleven breakdown events were identified using average speed profiles. The traffic flows prior to and after the onset of congestion were studied. Breakdown <b>flow</b> <b>rates</b> ranged between 1194 to 1404 vphpl, with an average of 1295 vphpl, and a mean queue discharge rate of 1072 vphpl was determined. Mean queue discharge, as used by the Highway Capacity Manual 2000 (HCM), in terms of pcphpl was found to be 1199, well below the HCM’s average capacity of 1600 pcphpl. This reduced capacity found at the site is attributable mainly to narrower lane width and higher percentage of heavy vehicles, around 25 %, in the traffic stream. The difference found between mean breakdown flow (1295 vphpl) and queue-discharge flow (1072 vphpl) has been observed widely, and is due to reduced traffic flow once traffic breaks down and queues start to form. The Missouri DOT currently uses a spreadsheet for work zone planning applications that assumes the same values of breakdown and mean queue <b>discharge</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rates.</b> This study proposes that breakdown <b>flow</b> <b>rates</b> should be used to forecast the onset of congestion, whereas mean queue <b>discharge</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rates</b> should be used to estimate delays under congested conditions.

Findings - The results demonstrated that the occupant loads and the usage patterns of an appliance had significant effects on the sizing of a drainage stack. It was reported that a reduction of 16 per cent in the design <b>discharge</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> for a washroom, at an occupant load of 4. 2 persons per apartment, could be achieved with no more than one appliance discharging at a time.
