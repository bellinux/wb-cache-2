50|$|For in-situ bonded <b>face</b> <b>sheets</b> {{the core}} is {{closed-cell}} foam. The goal of in-situ bonding {{is to create}} a metallic bonding between the foam core and <b>face</b> <b>sheets.</b> This is achieved in three ways.

40|$|Spectral {{elements}} {{are found to}} be extremely resourceful to study the wave propagation characteristics of structures at high frequencies. Most of the aerospace structures use honeycomb sandwich constructions. The existing spectral elements use single layer theories for a sandwich construction wherein the two <b>face</b> <b>sheets</b> vibrate together and this model is sufficient for low frequency excitations. At high frequencies, the two <b>face</b> <b>sheets</b> vibrate independently. The Extended Higher order SAndwich Plate theory (EHSaPT) is suitable for representing the independent motion of the <b>face</b> <b>sheets.</b> A 1 D spectral element based on EHSaPT is developed in this work. The wave number and the wave speed characteristics are obtained using the developed spectral element. It is shown that the developed spectral element is capable of representing independent wave motions of the <b>face</b> <b>sheets.</b> The propagation speeds of a high frequency modulated pulse in the <b>face</b> <b>sheets</b> and the core of a honeycomb sandwich are demonstrated. Responses of a typical honeycomb sandwich beam to high frequency shock loads are obtained using the developed spectral element and the response match very well with the finite element results. It is shown that the developed spectral element is able to represent the flexibility of the core resulting into independent wave motions in the <b>face</b> <b>sheets,</b> for which a finite element method needs huge degrees of freedom.

40|$|ABSTRACT: A bending {{theory is}} {{developed}} for a three-layer sandwich plate {{consisting of a}} weak core and two unequal <b>face</b> <b>sheets.</b> In the model, the core and <b>face</b> <b>sheets</b> are mod-eled as separate homogeneous plates with an assumed stress field, which satisfies equilib-rium point-by-point.

Although the usual assumption of negligible in-plane stresses in con-junction with a weak core is adopted, the effects of interlaminar core shear and normal stresses, along with transverse core flexibility, {{are included in the}} analysis. The corre-sponding displacement field consists of a combination of assumed and weighted displace-ments.

40|$|A {{sandwich}} construction {{consists of a}} low-density core material with high strength <b>face</b> <b>sheets</b> bounded {{to the top and}} bottom surfaces. The construction has been widely used in the aerospace and marine industries due to its outstanding characteristics such as noise absorption, weight minimization, heat insulation, and better bending stiffness. In sandwich structures used in high-performance aircraft, the <b>face</b> <b>sheets</b> are often made of fiber-reinforced composite materials and the core is made of honeycomb. The structures may also have variable thickness so as to satisfy aerodynamic requirements. In the stress analysis, the constant-thickness <b>face</b> <b>sheets</b> are usually considered as membrane and the core is assumed to be inextensible but deformable in the thickness direction. The static behavior of variable-thickness, isotropic and homogeneous sandwich beams was successfully studied by employing a constant-thickness theory but allowing stiffnesses to vary in accordance with local thickness variations. It has been recently found in a refined theory that the analyses based on the constant thickness theory locally can lead to significant errors in structural responses if the sandwich beam is thickness-tapered and the cores are deformable in transverse shear. The errors arise mainly from two factors: (1) the transverse shear components of the membrane forces in the <b>face</b> <b>sheets</b> alter the transverse shears carried by the core; and (2) the face-sheet membrane strains arise from transverse shear deformation of the core. In practice the variable thickness may not only exist in core but also in <b>face</b> <b>sheets.</b> The thickness-variations may even be a type of step function. In this case the transverse shear stress in the <b>face</b> <b>sheets</b> and bending stress in the core should be taken into account in the refined theory mentioned. In the present study, energy principles are employed in deriving governing equations for general bending of anisotropic sandwich beams with variable thickness in both <b>face</b> <b>sheets</b> and cores. Solutions to these equations are based on a finite difference scheme. As an example in application, a simply supported thickness-tapered sandwich beam subject to a concentrated load at its center is considered. Let W' be the maximum deflection of the beam in which <b>face</b> <b>sheets</b> are considered as membrane, while W'' is that based on using the modified refined theory. It is found that W' is always larger than W'', however, the magnitude of (W'- W'') appears to be insensitive to the change of the taper of the beam...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that thin <b>face</b> <b>sheets</b> of wide-aperture deformable mirrors in adaptive-optics systems be made from a composite material consisting of cyanate ester filled with graphite. This composite material appears to offer an attractive alternative to low-thermal-expansion glasses {{that are used in}} some conventional optics and have been considered for adaptive-optics <b>face</b> <b>sheets.</b> Adaptive-optics <b>face</b> <b>sheets</b> are required to have maximum linear dimensions of the order of meters or even tens of meters for some astronomical applications. If the <b>face</b> <b>sheets</b> were to be made from low-thermal-expansion glasses, then they would also be required to have thicknesses of the order of a millimeter so as to obtain the optimum compromise between the stiffness needed for support and the flexibility needed to enable deformation to controlled shapes by use of actuators. It is difficult to make large glass sheets having thicknesses less than 3 mm, and 3 -mm-thick glass sheets are too stiff to be deformable to the shapes typically required for correction of wavefronts of light that has traversed the terrestrial atmosphere. Moreover, the primary commercially produced candidate low-thermal-expansion glass is easily fractured when in the form of thin <b>face</b> <b>sheets.</b> Graphite-filled cyanate ester has relevant properties {{similar to those of the}} low-expansion glasses. These properties include a coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) of the order of a hundredth of the CTEs of other typical mirror materials. The Young s modulus (which quantifies stiffness in tension and compression) of graphite-filled cyanate ester is also similar to the Young's moduli of low-thermal-expansion glasses. However, the fracture toughness of graphite-filled cyanate ester is much greater than that of the primary candidate low-thermal-expansion glass. Therefore, graphite-filled cyanate ester could be made into nearly unbreakable <b>face</b> <b>sheets,</b> having maximum linear dimensions greater than a meter and thicknesses of the order of a millimeter, that would satisfy the requirements for use in adaptive optics...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{two methods}} for predicting the in-plane compression strength of impact damaged sandwich structures. For developing these methods uniaxial in-plane compression tests of impact damaged unsymmetrical sandwich coupons are conducted. The specimens {{were made of}} two CFRP face sheets of different thickness and an embedded honeycomb core. Low velocity impacts from 1 J up to 15 J caused varying amounts of core and <b>face</b> <b>sheet</b> damage and {{a dent in the}} impacted <b>face</b> <b>sheet.</b> While increasing the in-plane compression in the residual strength tests, the dent grew in depth and transverse to the loading direction until final failure of the impacted <b>face</b> <b>sheet</b> occurred. This phenomenological observation is reproduced in computational simulations. The simulations use either an efficient finite element model or a semi-analytical Ritz approach including non-linear displacement-strain relations and progressive damage growth in the core. For the latter stress-based failure criteria and stiffness degradation models are applied. Residual strength criteria are developed depending on the numerical solver. The comparison of simulation and test results demonstrates that the presented methods are able to predict the damage tolerance of unsymmetrical sandwich structures. For damages due a high-energy impact the simulations show that the <b>face</b> <b>sheet</b> damage has {{to be included in the}} model. Including the <b>face</b> <b>sheet</b> damage into the semi-analytical model increases the computational time tremendously.
