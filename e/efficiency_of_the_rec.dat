40|$|Recent {{developments}} in materials technology now {{make it possible}} to fabricate nonthermal thin-film radioisotopic energy converters (REC) with a specific power of 24 W/kg and a 10 year working life at 5 to 10 watts. This creates applications never before possible, such as placing the power supply directly on integrated circuit chips. The <b>efficiency</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>REC</b> is about 25 percent which is two to three times greater than the 6 to 8 percent capabilities of current thermoelectric systems. Radio isotopic energy converters have the potential to meet many future space power requirements {{for a wide variety of}} applications with less mass, better efficiency, and less total area than other power conversion options. These benefits result in significant dollar savings over the projected mission lifetime...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Concerns {{have been}} {{expressed}} regarding <b>the</b> adequacy <b>of</b> ethics review systems in developing countries. Limited {{data are available}} regarding the structural and functional status of Research Ethics Committees (<b>RECs)</b> in <b>the</b> Middle East. <b>The</b> purpose <b>of</b> {{this study was to}} survey <b>the</b> existing <b>RECs</b> in Egypt to better understand their functioning status, perceived resource needs, and challenges. Methods We distributed a self-administered survey tool to Egyptian RECs to collect information on the following domains: general characteristics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>REC,</b> membership composition, ethics training, workload, process of ethics review, perceived challenges to effective functioning, and financial and material resources. We used basic descriptive statistics to evaluate the quantitative data. Results We obtained responses from 67 % (12 / 18) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> identified <b>RECs.</b> Most RECs (10 / 12) have standard operating procedures and many (7 / 12) have established policies to manage conflicts <b>of</b> interests. <b>The</b> average membership was 10. 3 with a range from 7 - 19. The predominant member type was physicians (69. 5 % <b>of</b> all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>REC</b> members) with little lay representation (13. 7 %). Most RECs met at least once/month and <b>the</b> average number <b>of</b> protocols reviewed per meeting was 3. 8 with a range from 1 - 10. Almost three-quarters <b>of</b> <b>the</b> members from all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 12 <b>RECs</b> indicated they received some formal training in ethics. Regarding resources, roughly half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>RECs</b> have dedicated capital equipment (e. g., meeting room, computers, office furniture, etc); none <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>RECs</b> have a formal operating budget. Perceived challenges included <b>the</b> absence <b>of</b> national research ethics guidelines and national standards for RECs and lack of ongoing training of its members in research ethics. Conclusion Our study documents several areas of strengths and areas for improvements in <b>the</b> operations <b>of</b> Egyptian <b>RECs.</b> Regarding strengths, many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> existing <b>RECs</b> meet frequently, have a majority of members with prior training in research ethics, and have written policies. Regarding areas for improvements, many RECs should strive for a more diverse membership and should receive more financial resources and administrative support personnel. We recommend that RECs include more individuals from the community and develop a continuing educational program for its members. Institutional officials should be aware <b>of</b> <b>the</b> resource capacity needs of their RECs. </p...|$|R
