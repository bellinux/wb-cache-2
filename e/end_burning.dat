5000|$|In a dual-thrust {{solid fuel}} rocket motor, the {{propellant}} mass is composed of two different types (densities) of fuel. In {{the case of a}} tandem dual-thrust motor, the fuel closest to the rocket nozzle burns fast and the fuel further into the motor's body burns slower. This has the effect of giving the rocket a lot of thrust initially, accelerating it rapidly to high speed. When all the fast-burning propellant has burnt, the slow-burning propellant delivers a much lower level of thrust. The first phase of acceleration is called [...] "boost" [...] and the second phase [...] "sustain". Not all dual-thrust motors are in a tandem arrangement but non-tandem motors function much the same; they just have a different physical layout of fuel. For example they might burn from the inside to the outside (core burning), rather than from the end in (<b>end</b> <b>burning).</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{film was}} shot almost {{entirely in the}} small Scottish towns of Gatehouse of Fleet, Newton Stewart, Kirkcudbright, and Creetown in Dumfries and Galloway, as well as Plockton in Ross-shire. [...] Some scenes were filmed {{in and around the}} Isle of Whithorn, where the owners of the castle, Elizabeth McAdam McLaughland and David Wheatley, plus several other local people {{featured}} in various scenes. Culzean Castle in Ayrshire and its grounds and Floors Castle were also used for the shooting. Some of the opening flying shoots feature the Isle of Skye, including the pinnacles of The Storr and the Quiraing. The cave scenes were filmed inside Wookey Hole in Somerset. The amphibious aircraft that takes Sergeant Howie from the religious certainties of the mainland to the ancient beliefs of the island was a Thurston Teal, owned and flown in the aerial sequences by Christopher Murphy. The <b>end</b> <b>burning</b> of the Wicker Man occurred at Burrow Head (near a caravan site). According to Britt Ekland, some animals did actually perish inside the Wicker Man, whereas Robin Hardy {{said in an interview that}} great care was taken to ensure that the animals were in no danger of being hurt during this scene and that they were not inside the Wicker Man when it was set on fire.|$|E

40|$|A case bonded <b>end</b> <b>burning</b> solid {{propellant}} rocket motor is described. A propellant with sufficiently low modulus to avoid chamber buckling on cooling from cure and sufficiently high elongation to sustain the stresses induced without cracking is used. The propellant is zone cured within the motor case at high pressures equal to or approaching the pressure at which the motor will operate during combustion. A {{solid propellant}} motor with a burning time long enough that its spacecraft {{would be limited to}} a maximum acceleration of less than 1 g is provided by one version of the case bonded <b>end</b> <b>burning</b> solid propellant motor of the invention...|$|E
40|$|Pulsed {{radiography}} {{was applied}} to observe solid propellant surface regression during rocket motor operation. Using a 150 KV flash X-ray system manufactured by the Field Emission Corporation and two kinds of film suppliers, images of the propellant surface of a 5 cm diameter <b>end</b> <b>burning</b> rocket motor were recorded on film. The repetition frame rate of 8 pulses per second and the pulse train length of 10 pulses are limited by the capability of the power supply and the heat build up within the X-ray tube, respectively. The experiment demonstrated the effectiveness of pulsed radiography for observing solid propellant surface regression. Measuring the position of burning surface images on film with a microdensitometer, quasi-instantaneous burning rate {{as a function of}} pressure and the variation of characteristic velocity with pressure and gas stay time were obtained. Other research items to which pulsed radiography can be applied are also suggested...|$|E
40|$|The {{combustion}} of NH 4 ClO 4 composite propellants {{has been}} studied between 15 and 3000 psi. The emphasis in {{the program has been}} on determining the mechanisms by which the fuel components influence the burning rate of the composites. In order to have flexibility in the choice and concentration of the fuel component all combustion experiments were performed with pressed power strands. The fuels studied included those which affected the combustion mechanism of the composite primarily through their effect on: (1) the oxidizer decomposition mechanism and (2) the composite surface temperature. The combustion of pure and doped NH 4 ClO 4 was studied using both pressed powder strands and pressed <b>end</b> <b>burning</b> motor grains. The experimental approach has been essentially a chemical one with emphasis on perturbing those reactions which occur on or immediately adjacent to the surface (zone of influence) of the composite...|$|E

40|$|The {{feasibility}} of reducing heat transfer rates to inert nozzle walls in solid rockets by addition of silicone oil as a propellant ingredient is explored experimentally. A metallized control propellant and its counterpart with 1 % silicone oil are fired in a 2 1 / 2 -in. diameter <b>end</b> <b>burning</b> all-metal burner. Pressure-time histories are obtained; temperature-time data at the nozzle throat are obtained {{in some of}} the runs. The heat loss by the product gases to the cold inert walls of the nozzle lower the temperature of the gases leading to the condensation of aluminum oxide on the walls. This condensation is used as an index of the heat transfer rate to the nozzle. On a statistical basis it is found that the silicone propellant gives practically no condensation in 70 % of the firings contrasted with 21 % for its counterpart with no silicone oil in it. The gas temperature at the nozzle throat is experimentally seen to be generally higher with the silicone propellant than with its counterpart; this higher temperature is consistent with a preliminary analysis that is used here to relate the nozzle surface temperature to the heat transfer from the product gases...|$|E
40|$|Electrically {{controlled}} extinguishable solid propellants (ESCSP) {{are capable}} of multiple ignitions, extinguishments and throttle control by the application of electrical power. Both core and <b>end</b> <b>burning</b> no moving parts ECESP grains/motors to three inches in diameter have now been tested. Ongoing research {{has led to a}} newer family of even higher performance ECESP providing up to 10 % higher Isp, manufacturing ease, and significantly higher electrical conduction. The high conductivity was not found to be desirable for larger motors; however it is ideal for downward scaling to micro and pico-propulsion applications with a web thickness of less than 0. 125 inch. As a solid solution propellant, this ECESP is molecularly uniform, having no granular structure. Because of this homogeneity and workable viscosity it can be directly cast into thin layers or vacuum cast into complex geometries. Both coaxial and grain stacks have been demonstrated. Combining individual propellant coaxial grains and/or grain stacks together form three-dimensional arrays of modular cluster thrusters. Adoption of fabless manufacturing methods and standards from the electronics industry will provide custom, highly reproducible micro-propulsion arrays and clusters at low costs. These stack and cluster thruster designs provide a small footprint saving spacecraft surface area for solar panels and/or experiments. The simplicity of these thrusters will enable their broad use on micro-pico satellites for primary propulsion, ACS and formation flying applications. Larger spacecraft may find uses for ECESP thrusters on extended booms, on-orbit refueling, pneumatic actuators, and gas generators...|$|E
40|$|Burning Under is a {{cerebral}} literary thriller (68, 000 words) {{set in the}} Rust Belt and {{coal-mining region}} of southwest Pennsylvania. The narrative revolves around a mine explosion, triggered by methane gas, which kills several miners. In the wake of this disaster, the lives of three very different people converge. Larry, a veteran miner, haunted by his tragic past, survives the explosion but cannot avoid he media spotlight or the hero label. Denise, a young nurse, tries to escape her troubled marriage with Luke – another surviving miner – by taking {{a job at a}} Pittsburgh hospital. But when Luke is evacuated to the same hospital, where he slips into a coma, Denise’s job turns into a form of emotional torture. Finally, Simon is a disgruntled lawyer for Faust Coal who suspects the accident was caused by his company’s low safety and ethical standards. Encouraged by his new girlfriend Anita, a Pittsburgh journalist, he digs around and uncovers a trail of evidence and a massive cover-up engineered by the CEO, George Faust. Simon, Larry, and Denise are linked by a common desire to expose Faust Coal, and they form an alliance. But George will do anything conceal the truth and exact revenge, which provokes a violent <b>end.</b> <b>Burning</b> Under blends literary prose, suspense, and dark humor. Finally, the broader themes woven into the narrative – such as wage/wealth inequality and capitalism’s exploitation of the environment in Appalachia and the Rust Belt – reflect my research and scholarship work in areas like Twentieth-Century American Literature, Ecocriticism, Environmental Justice, and Marxist Theory. ...|$|E
