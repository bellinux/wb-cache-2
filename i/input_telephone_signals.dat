50|$|The first {{focus was}} on anti-induction {{telephone}}s. In the 1930s, the telephone infrastructure in Japan was primarily used by the railroad industry, the police, the utility industry and the mining industry. The telecommunications infrastructure was so poor {{that it had to}} rely on power lines and railway cables—upon which <b>telephone</b> <b>signals</b> were superimposed. Because the <b>telephone</b> <b>signals</b> were susceptible to inductive interference and noise and the defective wiring in the long lines caused too much <b>signal</b> loss, normal <b>telephone</b> conversations were difficult. Iwasaki Kogyo set out to develop an anti-induction telephone to solve this problem, whilst running the cable manufacturing operations. Similarly, Iwasaki Kogyo focused on secure, anti-tapping telephones.|$|R
50|$|Because {{the same}} twisted pair carries <b>telephone</b> <b>signals</b> in both directions,echo {{is often a}} problem on these circuits.
