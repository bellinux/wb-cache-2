40|$|In cloud computing, user {{functional}} requirements are satisfied through service composition. However, {{due to the}} process of interaction and sharing among SaaS services, user <b>privacy</b> <b>data</b> tends to be illegally disclosed to the service participants. In this paper, we propose a <b>privacy</b> <b>data</b> decomposition and discretization method for SaaS services. First, according to logic between the data, we classify the <b>privacy</b> <b>data</b> into discrete <b>privacy</b> <b>data</b> and continuous <b>privacy</b> <b>data.</b> Next, {{in order to protect the}} user <b>privacy</b> information, continuous <b>data</b> chains are decomposed into discrete data chain, and discrete data chains are prevented from being synthesized into continuous data chains. Finally, we propose a protection framework for <b>privacy</b> <b>data</b> and demonstrate its correctness and feasibility with experiments...|$|R

When these detected tainted data are sent through the network, the program can judge the existing privacy problems.|$|R

25|$|The {{right to}} privacy is {{protected}} by Article 30 of the Basic Law and Article 14 of the Bill of Rights. At statutory level, protection is mainly offered by the Personal <b>Data</b> (<b>Privacy)</b> Ordinance, which has quite a limited scope. It stipulates six data protection principles which must be adhered to when dealing with personal data. Non-compliance with the principles is not a criminal offence but the party concerned may be served with an enforcement notice by the Privacy Commissioner. Non-compliance with an enforcement notice is punishable by a penalty of a fine at Level 5 and imprisonment for 2 years. The statute also creates a civil cause of action: an individual who suffers damage, including injured feeling, by reason of a contravention of the Ordinance in relation {{to his or her}} personal data may seek compensation from the data user concerned.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Data {{security}} has consistently {{been a major}} issue in information technology. In the cloud computing environment, it becomes particularly serious because the data is located in different places even in all the globe. <b>Data</b> security and <b>privacy</b> protection are the two main factors of user’s concerns about the cloud technology. Though many techniques on the topics in cloud computing have been investigated in both academics and industries, <b>data</b> security and <b>privacy</b> protection are becoming more important for the future development of cloud computing technology in government, industry, and business. <b>Data</b> security and <b>privacy</b> protection issues are relevant to both hardware and software in the cloud architecture. This study is to review different security techniques and challenges from both software and hardware aspects for protecting data in the cloud and aims at enhancing the <b>data</b> security and <b>privacy</b> protection for the trustworthy cloud environment. In this paper, we make a comparative research analysis of the existing research work regarding the <b>data</b> security and <b>privacy</b> protection techniques used in the cloud computing...|$|R
