40|$|ABSTRACT: Our {{ancestor}} {{found that}} some of the Chinese <b>herbal</b> <b>drugs</b> were toxic during their clinical practice. They graded the toxicity of Chinese <b>herbal</b> <b>drugs</b> into three degrees and thought that the term "toxicity of the Chinese herbal drugs" could be used in a broad and a narrow sense. In modern times, toxic components of the Chinese <b>herbal</b> <b>drugs</b> and their toxic mechanisms, especially the toxicity on the kidney, were further revealed. The factors that affect the toxicity of the Chinese <b>herbal</b> <b>drugs</b> include the species, preparation, dose and environment. To prevent the toxicity of the Chinese <b>herbal</b> <b>drugs,</b> we must strengthen the management of the Chinese <b>herbal</b> <b>drugs.</b> On the other hand, doctors' recognition of the toxicity of Chinese <b>herbal</b> <b>drugs</b> should be enhanced. At the same time, patients should be told to decoct and take Chinese <b>herbal</b> <b>drugs</b> correctl...|$|R

40|$|Historically {{because of}} safety of use, efficiency, {{cultural}} acceptability, and fewer side effects, <b>herbal</b> <b>drugs</b> have been frequently used in most communities. In light of acceptability {{of use and}} convenient accessibility to these plants among Iranians as well as possible side effects due to inappropriate use of them, this review article sought to investigate the attitudes toward use of <b>herbal</b> <b>drugs</b> and the used doses and methods of preparation and use of these plants among Iranians. In this review article, firstly 55 articles in Persian and English languages were examined and 30 articles {{were excluded from the}} study because of containing irrelevant content. After detailed analysis of 25 articles, 15 articles were selected and their findings were presented with regards to the purposes of this review article. Overall, 73. 5 % of women and 72 % of men in Iran (totally 71. 5 % of Iranians) use <b>herbal</b> <b>drugs,</b> 82. 9 % of the people consider use of <b>herbal</b> <b>drugs</b> as effective, and 41. 8 % use them as tea.

40|$|Objectives: This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to clarify the analgesic effect of toad cake and toad-cake-containing <b>herbal</b> <b>drugs.</b> Methods: We counted the writhing response of mice after the intraperitoneal administration of acetic acid as a nociceptive pain model and the withdrawal response after the plantar surface stimulation of the hind paw induced by partial sciatic nerve ligation of the mice as a neuropathic pain model to investigate the analgesic effect of toad cake and toad-cake-containing <b>herbal</b> <b>drugs.</b> A co-treatment study with serotonin biosynthesis inhibitory drug 4 -chloro-DL-phenylalanine methyl ester hydrochloride (PCPA), the catecholamine biosynthesis inhibitory drug α-methyl-DL-tyrosine methyl ester hydrochloride (AMPT) or the opioid receptor antagonist naloxone hydrochloride was also conducted. Results: Analgesic effects in a mouse model of nociceptive pain and neuropathic pain were shown by oral administration of toad cake and toad-cake-containing <b>herbal</b> <b>drugs.</b> The effects of toad cake and toad-cake-containing <b>herbal</b> <b>drugs</b> disappeared upon co-treatment with PCPA, but not with AMPT or naloxone in the nociceptive pain model; the analgesic effect of toad-cake-containing <b>herbal</b> <b>drugs</b> also disappeared upon co-treatment with PCPA in the neuropathic pain model. Conclusion: Toad cake and toad-cake-containing <b>herbal</b> <b>drugs</b> have potential for the treatments of nociceptive pain and of neuropathic pain, such as post-herpetic neuralgia, trigeminal neuralgia, diabetic neuralgia, and postoperative or posttraumatic pain, by activation of the central serotonin nervous system. ...|$|R

40|$|Background: Using <b>herbal</b> <b>drugs</b> is {{the common}} way for {{treatment}} of diseases in traditional and alternative medicine. These drugs have important role and strong cultural background among people in treatment of hyper-billirubinemia. It is necessary to evaluate the effect of <b>herbal</b> <b>drugs</b> by scientific methods. The goal {{of this study is}} to investigate the in vitro effect of common <b>herbal</b> <b>drugs</b> used traditionally in management of neonatal hyperbillirubinemia. Methods: in this study 0. 5 cc of 5 common <b>herbal</b> <b>drugs</b> (Cichorium intybus, Fumaria parviflora, Zizyphus jujuba, Alhagi pseudoalhagi and Purgative manna) which are obtained by hydrochloric instillation were added to 1 ml of serum of jaundiced neonates and then the level of billirubin determined by Diazo blank method. Findings: This study revealed that only Cichorium intybus extract decreases the level of bilirubin significantly (p< 0. 05). Conclusion: Other <b>herbal</b> <b>drugs</b> may decrease billirubin level with other mechanisms, for example by cathartic effect or activating of liver enzymes, but this study revealed that Cichorium intybus is the only drug that has direct decreasing effect on billirubin. For further investigation, we recommend to separate the effective substance of Cichorium intybus and determine its effectiveness in vivo...|$|R
