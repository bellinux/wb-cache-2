500|$|Adam Markovitz of Entertainment Weekly {{was also}} positive, writing that Beyoncé [...] "pants and sweats and grunts (<b>except,</b> <b>you</b> know, sexy-like), her voice {{climbing}} ever higher {{in search of}} an octave big enough to hold it". Embling of Tiny Mix Tapes wrote that [...] "" [...] if sung by anyone else, 'I Miss You' would be a thin wisp of a ballad, but Beyoncé allows her voice to crack at the right moments, moving tenuously, self-consciously through the soft, circular melody." [...] He concluded that songs like [...] "I Miss You" [...] and [...] "Start Over" [...] would earn deserved spots in [...] "the Beyoncé pantheon" [...] once fans take the time to grow attached to them. Andrew Unterberger of PopCrush praised the way Beyoncé delivers the line [...] "Why is that?", writing that it is [...] "a nice little nod to the confusion of heartbreak, and a rare, welcome glimpse of vulnerability for an artist who too often seems to have all of the answers." [...] Referring to [...] "I Miss You", Alexis Petridis of The Guardian wrote that [...] "the 80s influence is not always a bad thing." [...] He considered the song to be [...] "a woozy update of an old-fashioned slow jam", further stating that [...] "it is probably pushing it a bit to call it an R equivalent of Ariel Pink's hypnagogic pop, but there's something enveloping and dream-like about it." [...] Ian Walker of AbsolutePunk commented that [...] " [...] hollow beat and dismal synthesizers, allow Beyoncé and her morosely beautiful voice center stage. [...] Beyoncé delivers a believable performance effortlessly." [...] By contrast, Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune was negative, writing that [...] " [...] easily overlooked with its forlorn keyboard and beat-box chintziness." [...] Similarly, Consequence of Sound writer Chris Coplan felt that the ballad is [...] "too-saccharine-for-its-own-good." [...] The Guardians critics Ben Beaumont Thomas and Rebecca Nicholson ranked [...] "I Miss You" [...] at numbers four and nine respectively on their lists of The 10 Best Tracks of 2011.|$|E

2500|$|From {{an early}} stage, Lorrimer and Boucher doubted that Blake's 7 would be renewed for a fifth series. Boucher was disappointed; {{he thought that}} an {{additional}} series would have enabled {{the cast and crew}} to become comfortable with the new format. The first proposal for the series' conclusion, titled Attack, involved Blake returning to lead an assault on the Federation on Earth, finally defeating them. This idea was rejected by Lorrimer, who thought it [...] "...would be like five men trying to defeat the German army". Influenced by the films Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid and The Wild Bunch, Boucher decided that concluding the series in a shoot-out would provide a more memorable ending. Apart from Blake, the characters' fates would be deliberately ambiguous in case a fifth series was commissioned. Blake was to be given the dying words; [...] "Oh Avon, I didn't take any of them on trust... <b>except</b> <b>you...</b> You are my... only friend", but these were removed because Blake's ability to deliver them after the violence of his shooting stretched credibility.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the age of}} 56, {{he married}} Li Shuxian, a {{hospital}} nurse, on 30 April 1962, in a ceremony held at the Banquet Hall of the Consultative Conference. From 1964 until his death he worked as an editor for the literary department of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, where his monthly salary was around 100 yuan. One yuan in the 1960s was equivalent to about 40 cents USD. Li recalled in a 1995 interview that: [...] "I found Pu Yi a honest man, a man who desperately needed my love {{and was ready to}} give me as much love as he could. When I was having even a slight case of flu, he was so worried I would die, that he refused to sleep at night and sat by my bedside until dawn so he could attend to my needs". Li also noted like everybody else who knew him that Puyi was an incredibly clumsy man, leading her to say: [...] "Once in a boiling rage at his clumsiness, I threatened to divorce him. On hearing this, he got down on his knees and, with tears in his eyes, he begged me to forgive him. I shall never forget what he said to me: 'I have nothing in this world <b>except</b> <b>you,</b> and you are my life. If you go, I will die'. But apart from him, what did I ever have in the world?".|$|E
