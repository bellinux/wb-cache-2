By the end of the season, Gould set the all-time franchise record for most points scored (1,207), <b>field</b> <b>goals</b> (276) and <b>field</b> <b>goals</b> made from at least 50 yards (23), along with the most <b>field</b> <b>goals</b> in a season (33). Against the Chargers, Jay Cutler threw his 138th career touchdown pass to Martellus Bennett, breaking a tie with Sid Luckman; the record had stood since September 17, 1950.|$|E

After a scoreless first quarter in which Alabama missed two <b>field</b> <b>goals,</b> both teams scored <b>field</b> <b>goals</b> in the second; Alabama also had another attempt blocked {{early in the second}} quarter, that left the score tied 3–3 at halftime. Alabama took a 6–3 lead in the third, but LSU tied the game at 6–6 in the fourth quarter to send the game into overtime. In the overtime period, Alabama missed a 52-yard field goal. LSU then connected on a 25-yard field goal to win the game 9–6.|$|E
5|$|Epstein {{was drafted}} by the Jacksonville Jaguars in the 2002 NFL Draft and played in six games with the Jaguars in the 2002 NFL season before being picked up off waivers by the Minnesota Vikings on October 23, 2002, {{where he was a}} kickoff {{specialist}} {{for the remainder of the}} season. Epstein tore his anterior cruciate ligament with one week remaining in the 2002 season and had offseason surgery. Despite being reactivated during the 2003 preseason, he was released before the 2003 season. 43-year-old Gary Anderson performed the PATs and <b>field</b> <b>goals</b> for the 2002 Vikings. Anderson, had been brought out of retirement during the season to contribute to the Vikings' special teams efforts as Doug Brien faltered. Epstein replaced Brien. As a Jaguar, Epstein made 5 out of 9 <b>field</b> <b>goals</b> (with a long of 34 yards) and 13 PATs. He was 0–4 on <b>field</b> <b>goals</b> of 39 yards or longer. Of his 72 career kickoffs, 10 of them were touchbacks and his average distance was 61.7 yards. After Epstein was released, the Jaguars continued to have troubles as his successor Tim Seder was cut five games later. 8 of Epstein's 28 career points came in a 28–25 October 6, 2002 Jacksonville victory over Philadelphia. He was 2-for-2 on both <b>field</b> <b>goals</b> and PATs.|$|E

5|$|On special teams, the Hokies {{had several}} highs and lows. Justin Harper's 84-yard punt-return {{touchdown}} sparked a Virginia Tech rally {{that brought the}} Hokies within striking distance, but failures on special teams also ended the rally and turned {{the momentum of the}} game against Virginia Tech. Kicker Jud Dunlevy had been the third-most accurate kicker in the nation heading into the Orange Bowl, having hit 21 of his 24field goal attempts during the season. He only needed two <b>field</b> <b>goals</b> to break Tech's record for most <b>field</b> <b>goals</b> in the season, set at 22 by Shayne Graham in 1998.

5|$|Both teams traded {{touchdowns in}} the third.

Alabama responded with a nine-yard Julio Jones touchdown reception, but was unable to get a defensive stop late in the game preserving the 24–21 LSU victory. Turnovers proved costly for Alabama with LSU scoring <b>field</b> <b>goals</b> on drives after a McElroy interception in the first and fumble in the fourth.

He {{led the league in}} extra points made and attempted in 1941, 1942 and 1945 and in <b>field</b> <b>goals</b> made in 1943. As did almost all players in his day, Hutson played both offense and defense. On defense, he played safety and intercepted 30 passes over the final six years of his career. His highest season total was in 1943, when he intercepted eight passes in ten games. In 1940, he led the NFL with six interceptions.|$|E
5|$|In basketball, {{points are}} {{accumulated}} through free throws or <b>field</b> <b>goals.</b> The National Basketball Association's (NBA) scoring title is {{awarded to the}} player with the highest points per game average in a given season. The scoring title was originally determined by total points scored through the 1968–69 season, after which points per game {{was used to determine}} the leader instead. Players who earned scoring titles before the 1979–80 season did not record any two point <b>field</b> <b>goals</b> because the three-point line was first implemented in the NBA during that season. To qualify for the scoring title, the player must appear in at least 70games (out of 82) or have at least 1,400points. These have been the entry criteria since the 1974–75 season.|$|E

50|$|In American {{football}} teams often opt {{to go for}} a <b>field</b> <b>goal</b> (worth 3 points) rather than attempt a touchdown. The rugby league equivalent, also called a <b>field</b> <b>goal,</b> is worth only one point and is much less common. The key difference between a <b>field</b> <b>goal</b> in the two sports is that an American football <b>field</b> <b>goal</b> attempt is normally kicked with a teammate holding the ball, whereas in rugby league the <b>field</b> <b>goal</b> is attempted using a drop-kick.|$|R
5|$|The highest-scoring {{regular season}} game is the triple-overtime {{game between the}} Detroit Pistons and the Denver Nuggets on December 13, 1983.

An NBA-record four players scored over 40 points in the game, including the Nuggets' Kiki Vandeweghe with a game-high 51. The two teams also set several other NBA records, including the most points scored by one team (186 points), the most points scored by a losing team (184), the most <b>field</b> <b>goals</b> by two teams (142), most <b>field</b> <b>goals</b> by one team (74) and most assists by two teams (93).|$|E

5|$|Virginia Tech's {{special teams}} squad was more highly {{regarded}} than its defense. Overall, Virginia Tech was 14th nationally in net punting and 37th in kickoff returns. Punter Jimmy Kibble was the No. 10 {{player in the}} country at his position, averaging 45.1 yards per kick during the regular season. Because of Virginia Tech's success at blocking kicks—the Hokies blocked seven during the season—North Carolina made a special effort to prepare for Virginia Tech's kick blockers on special teams. Virginia Tech placekicker Shayne Graham set Big East single-season records for <b>field</b> <b>goals</b> made (19) and points scored by kicking (92) during the season. He was 35 of 36 on extra points and 19 for 23 on <b>field</b> <b>goals,</b> but caught the flu prior to the Gator Bowl.|$|E

5|$|Cleveland again {{reached the}} {{championship}} game in 1951, but lost this time in a rematch against the Rams. Groza had a 52-yard field goal in the game, a record for a championship or Super Bowl that stood for 42 years. He was again named to the Pro Bowl after the season. The same scenario was repeated in 1952 and 1953: the Browns reached the championship both years, but lost both times to the Detroit Lions. Groza was playing with cracked ribs in the 1952 championship loss, and he missed three <b>field</b> <b>goals.</b> Groza set a record in 1953 when he made 23 <b>field</b> <b>goals</b> and had an 88.5% success rate, a single-season mark that stood for 28 years. He made the Pro Bowl again in 1952 and 1953, and was a first-team All-Pro selection both years.|$|E
50|$|In {{the third}} quarter, the Dolphins' lead was erased with Brown giving Houston a 43-yard and a 54-yard <b>field</b> <b>goal.</b> In the fourth quarter, Miami {{reclaimed}} the lead with Feely kicking a 48-yard <b>field</b> <b>goal.</b> However, the Texans would {{pull out the}} win with Brown getting not only a 20-yard <b>field</b> <b>goal,</b> but a gut-punching 57-yard <b>field</b> <b>goal.</b>|$|R
