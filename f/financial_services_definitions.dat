40|$|This study {{focuses on}} {{exploring}} {{the determinants of}} the use of <b>financial</b> <b>services</b> in Tanzania with respect to the role of household behavioural factors. This is achieved by attempting three interrelated research questions: i) What are the financial experiences of households in Tanzania? ii) What are beliefs held by households in Tanzania about the use of <b>financial</b> <b>services?</b> iii) What are the effects of household behavioural characteristics for intention to use <b>financial</b> <b>services</b> and subsequent usage of <b>financial</b> <b>services?</b> Both quantitative and qualitative research methods are employed to achieve the research objective. The empirical findings suggest that behavioural factors matter for the use of <b>financial</b> <b>services.</b> Firstly, the examination of household financial experiences on a sample of 30 households through the application of financial diary methodology revealed a variety of household financial experiences that highlight the necessity of <b>financial</b> <b>services</b> to households. Secondly, despite the fact that most households do not use <b>financial</b> <b>services,</b> it is found that households hold positive beliefs about <b>financial</b> <b>services</b> for saving facilities, security, finance, money management and improving economic well-being. Thirdly, structural equations models indicate that attitudes towards <b>financial</b> <b>services,</b> perceived behavioural control and subjective norms significantly impact the intention to use <b>financial</b> <b>services.</b> Perceived behavioural control is observed to prominently influence the use of <b>financial</b> <b>services.</b> The study offers the following contributions: Firstly, it develops a behavioural conceptual framework that integrates financial and psychological perspectives. This framework facilitates a broader understanding of the determinants for the use of <b>financial</b> <b>services</b> from various perspectives. Secondly, it provides distinct insights into the influence of behavioural characteristics in the use of <b>financial</b> <b>services.</b> This adds to the limited empirical literature about the determinants for the use of <b>financial</b> <b>services</b> specifically the effects of behavioural factors.

We offer a framework ‘FraTAct’ for transforming regulation intensive nescient activities of a <b>financial</b> <b>service</b> {{business process}} into intelligent activities. <b>Financial</b> <b>service</b> industries has been experiencing enormous challenges since the last decade. A recent financial crisis has unearthed various weaknesses in terms of administering the <b>financial</b> <b>service</b> industries. In order to prevent the future crisis, the regulators are constantly formulating new rules and also forcing the <b>financial</b> <b>service</b> industry to enact financial regulations in their <b>financial</b> <b>service</b> based application which automates financial operations. A <b>financial</b> <b>service</b> application underpins the <b>financial</b> <b>service</b> business process that contains activities. A nescient activity within a <b>financial</b> <b>service</b> process is prone to the risk of producing an inconsistent outcome that results in severe legal consequences for a financial institute e. g., a bank. In order to avoid these legal consequences, a financial institute should develop their <b>financial</b> <b>service</b> processes by composing activities that should be intelligent to understand and comply with financial regulations. Intelligent activities will produce outcomes that are consistent to financial regulations.
