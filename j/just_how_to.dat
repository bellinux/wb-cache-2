[...] He sings of traveling to New Orleans, Louisiana, to acquire a mojo hand, a hoodoo amulet or talisman; with its magical powers, he hopes [...] "to show all you good lookin' women <b>just</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> treat your man". [...] Similar lyrics appeared in [...] "Hoodoo Hoodoo", a 1946 recording by John Lee [...] "Sonny Boy" [...] Williamson: [...] "Well now I'm goin' down to Louisiana, and buy me another mojo hand".

500|$|Camilla Rhodes (Melissa George, Laura Elena Harring) {{is little}} more than a face in a photo and a name that has {{inspired}} many representatives of some vaguely threatening power to place her in a film against the wishes of Adam. Referred to as a [...] "vapid moll" [...] by one reviewer, she barely makes an impression in the first portion of the film, but after the blue box is opened and she is portrayed by Laura Elena Harring, she becomes a full person who symbolizes [...] "betrayal, humiliation and abandonment", and is the object of Diane's frustration. Diane is a sharp contrast to Camilla, who is more voluptuous than ever, and who appears to have [...] "sucked the life out of Diane". Immediately after telling Diane that she drives her wild, Camilla tells her they must end their affair. On a film set where Adam is directing Camilla, he orders the set cleared, except for Diane—at Camilla's request—where Adam shows another actor <b>just</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> kiss Camilla correctly. Instead of punishing Camilla for such public humiliation, as is suggested by Diane's conversation with the bungling hit man, one critic views Rita as the vulnerable representation of Diane's desire for Camilla.|$|E
500|$|Kwame Opam at The Verge {{chose to}} examine rape {{and the nature}} of consent in the season. Comparing Jessica Jones to other {{television}} series that have depicted rape (Game of Thrones, Orange Is the New Black, and Outlander), Opam felt that [...] "since rape is one of the show’s core themes, we never need to see it... rape is a foundational part of the text, and its presence is constant. Even if it’s invisible, it’s always there." [...] He also felt the season took the time to examine how rape happens and what it means, especially in terms of power and consent, concluding, [...] "Jessica Jones moves the conversation about rape forward by treating it as a complex subject worth investigating, rather than as spice for a story...Maybe we don’t need to see it anymore to grasp how violent it is. Maybe our energies are better spent thinking deeply about why it happens at all." [...] The Guardians Lili Loofbourow also discussed the season's depiction of rape and consent, noting the complications that come with Kilgrave telling his victims how to feel rather than <b>just</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> act, and saying, [...] "however exceptional Kilgrave’s power seems, the moral quagmire it produces is all too common. It’s the condition of the rape victim who had an orgasm during her assault. It’s the condition of the soldier trained to kill when he suspects his targets are innocent. It’s the condition of the battered woman who goes back to her abuser and stays “of her own free will”. It’s the condition of...any person, really, who agrees, whatever the context, to consent to forgo consent in the future." [...] Loofbourow also discussed the character of Simpson, comparing his power-inducing red pill to the anti-feminist [...] "red pillers", and noting that his taking of the pills [...] "renders him not just dangerously delusional, but so utterly at odds with nature and reality of any kind that he will forget to breathe unless he counteracts the pill’s effects." ...|$|E

2500|$|EGCG, a {{polyphenol}} {{in green}} tea, has {{shown in a}} study to inhibit EBV spontaneous lytic infection at the DNA, gene transcription and protein levels in a time and dose-dependent manner; the expression of EBV lytic genes Zta, Rta, and early antigen complex EA-D (induced by Rta), however, the highly stable EBNA-1 gene found across all stages of EBV infection is unaffected. [...] Specific inhibitors (to the pathways) suggest that Ras/MEK/MAPK pathway contributes to EBV lytic infection though BZLF1 and PI3-K pathway through BRLF1, the latter completely abrogating {{the ability of a}} BRLF1 adenovirus vector to induce the lytic form of EBV infection.

2500|$|To further promote [...] "A.K.A.", Lopez shot teaser videos {{for some}} tracks of the album. The first was [...] "Emotions", {{followed}} by [...] "Worry No More" [...] and [...] "Booty". For the video, the singer wore printed leggings and a cherry-colored crop {{top with a}} snapback hat, transitioning into sequin booty shorts and a matching crop top. The one-minute teaser clip for [...] "Booty" [...] sees Lopez {{and a group of}} backup dancers in patterned tights twerking form against an industrial backdrop. Zayda Rivera of New York Daily News further explained the storyline: [...] "Her voluptuous backside takes center stage in the music video as Lopez displays her own take on the dancing craze while instructing other women on <b>just</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> move it." [...] Rivera also commented that the video [...] "quickly confirmed why she's dominated dance in pop music since her big break as a Fly Girl on the hit ’90s sketch comedy series 'In Living Color'." [...] Alex Heigl of People agreed, stating: [...] "This is not some new-to-the-twerking-game rookie. This is how it's done. We hope you're ready." [...] Rachel McRady of US Magazine declared that Lopez [...] "reclaimed her title of most diva-licious derriere in the new teaser video for her upcoming single 'Booty'." [...] Mike Wass of Idolator called the video's visual [...] "hands-down the best thing you will watch today. Or ever." ...|$|E
2500|$|Following {{the release}} and {{prolonged}} touring of fourth album Catalyst (2004), {{which included a}} supporting slot on Green Day's American Idiot Tour, the band were left drained and sought an extended break. They {{were able to take}} two months off and regroup afterward, something they had not previously done during their career. The quintet decided to take on a new approach for the writing process of Coming Home, rather than the usual [...] "tour bus and dressing room jams", they moved into a house together in Malibu, California called the Morning View Mansion to write and demo new material. Despite this, main composer and lead guitarist, Chad Gilbert took a book containing over 40 riff ideas that he had written during the previous tour into the mansion. Drummer Cyrus Bolooki explained that, [...] "The whole idea is that we can be sitting around, watching TV, and suddenly be like, 'Hey, I've got an idea. Let's do this'. We've always wanted to do something like this, but we were never sure <b>just</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> do it. I know all the guys are really excited to get into the house, hang out and make some music." [...] The band spent four months in Malibu with studio engineer and long term friend Paul Miner, from August 2005 through November, eventually leaving with 14 finished demos to present to their record label.|$|E

Spin's Mikael Wood praised Andrew Bird's rendition of [...] "Bein' Green" [...] remarking, [...] "Andrew Bird sidesteps the precious self-pity you'd expect from [...] "Bein' Green": His Kermit gets the clever-to-cuddly ratio just right." [...] Web Behrens of Time Out Chicago spoke highly of OK Go's cover; [...] "Layering in everything from electronica to a perfectly quirky [...] "Flight of the Bumblebees" [...] sample, the homegrown band knows <b>just</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> push the envelope. We loved it even before we saw the video, which {{is sure to be}} another viral hit for Kulash and Company, taking their trippy cover to an even higher level." [...] Peter Chianca of Wicked Local, wrote in regards to Weezer and Hayley Williams' cover; [...] "complete with twittering swamp sounds, approximates the wistfulness that the late Jim Henson brought to the original." [...] Chianca also noted that, [...] "Alkaline Trio's punky take on [...] "Movin' Right Along" [...] is the album's standout, riffing playfully on the Kermit-and-Fozzie banter." [...] John Terauds of the Toronto Star commended the album as a whole, highlighting that, [...] "The finest treats come from two of the gentlest and most memorable melodies brought to us by Kermit the Frog: [...] "Rainbow Connection", where Hayley Williams of Paramore sweetly recaptures the original's innocent wonder and longing, boosted by Weezer's pastel-swampy backdrop; and Andrew Bird's clean, frank delivery of [...] "Bein' Green"." ...|$|E
