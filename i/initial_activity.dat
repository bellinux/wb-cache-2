25|$|Technetium-99m {{has several}} {{features}} {{that make it}} safer than other possible isotopes. Its gamma decay mode can be easily detected by a camera, allowing the use of smaller quantities. And because technetium-99m has a short half-life, its quick decay into the far less radioactive technetium-99 results in relatively low total radiation dose to the patient per unit of <b>initial</b> <b>activity</b> after administration, as compared to other radioisotopes. In the form administered in these medical tests (usually pertechnetate), technetium-99m and technetium-99 are eliminated from the body within a few days.|$|E
500|$|The {{story of}} the Battle of Rossbach is as much the {{story of the}} five days of {{maneuver}} leading to the battle as it is those famous 90 minutes of battle, and the maneuvers were shaped by the terrain. <b>Initial</b> <b>activity</b> focused on the village of Weissenfels, where the middle Saale emerges from the Buntsandstein of the Thuringian Basin in the Leipzig highlands, not far from the modern-day A9 highway; the locale lies [...] from the town of Saale and [...] southwest of Jena. Parts of the valley between Leipzig and Saale were relatively narrow, cut by the river and its tributaries; the hillsides were steep, and there were limited river crossings; this influenced the troop movements leading to the battle, as the various armies competed for sites to cross the river.|$|E
2500|$|Lazarus Hallgarten {{arrived in}} the United States in 1849. His <b>initial</b> <b>activity</b> was as a note and {{exchange}} broker opening an office at 20 Exchange Place in 1850. This yielded a moderate income and enabled him to start as a banker. [...] Initially the firm was called Hallgarten & Herzfeld (the other partners being Joseph Herzfeld, Samuel Neustadt, William Rosenheim and Hallgarten's two sons), which eventually became Hallgarten & Co. from January 1, 1867 after Herzfeld retired. After 1865 the firm developed into a stock and bond dealing house. The founder maintained his connections back in Europe and cultivated the flow of German capital into American railroad investments in the post-Civil War era.|$|E

2500|$|Late in 1933 {{and into}} 1934 the Communists had made overtures to rank-and-file activists in Socialist-led {{unemployed}} worker organizations to [...] "build the united front {{in spite of}} your leaders" [...] and to forge unity [...] "over the heads of...splitting leaders." [...] Now the so-called [...] "united front from below" [...] would be set aside and real efforts made to engage in joint work with Socialist-led organizations, beginning with the convocation of a National Congress for Unemployment and Social Insurance by the CPUSA in January 1935. While this <b>initial</b> <b>activity</b> drew only limited participation from the Socialists early in the planning process and was boycotted by the fledgling American Workers Party headed by A. J.

2500|$|The {{southeast}} panel {{illustrates the}} opening ritual when the principal participant is elaborately dressed {{and is being}} handed a bundle of spears. This {{is part of an}} <b>initial</b> <b>activity</b> before the game itself starts. Overlooking this scene is the death deity who rises from a vat of liquid, perhaps pulque. The glyphs above the deity identify it with the planet Venus. [...] Next is the southwest panel in which a different ceremonial preparation is depicted. The principal participant is supine on a kind of a sofa. Two musicians are playing a turtle shell drum and clay rattles. A figure dressed as an eagle dances in front while a skeletal deity flies above and the death deity rises from liquid. The northwest panel shows the beginning of the ballgame. Two participants are standing {{in the center of the}} court with speech scrolls emerging from their mouths. One holds a large knife in his left hand and gestures with his right. Between them are intertwined slashes, the symbol of the ballgame and a ball. At their waists are the protective and ritual accoutrements which are very similar to the stone yokes, palmas and hachas common in elite burials. Behind the players are two figures, one with a deer head, who are watching from the court walls as well as the death deity again above. The northeast panel indicates that the game has been played and one of the participants is about to be sacrificed by having his head cut off. The three figures are all dressed in the garments and symbols of the ballgame. The center figure has his arms held back by the one on the left. The figure on the right holds a large knife which is at the center figure’s neck. [...] There are scrolls indicating speech from the sacrifice as well as a depiction of the skeletal god.|$|E
