50|$|Wisteria, {{especially}} Wisteria sinensis, is very {{hardy and}} fast-growing. It can grow in fairly poor-quality soils, but prefers fertile, moist, well-drained soil. It thrives in full sun. It can be propagated via <b>hardwood</b> <b>cutting,</b> softwood cuttings, or seed. However, specimens grown from seed can take decades to bloom; for this reason, gardeners usually grow plants {{that have been}} started from rooted cuttings or grafted cultivars known to flower well. Another reason for failure to bloom can be excessive fertilizer (particularly nitrogen). Wisteria has nitrogen fixing capability (provided by Rhizobia bacteria in root nodules), and thus mature plants may benefit from added potassium and phosphate, but not nitrogen. Finally, wisteria can be reluctant to bloom because it has not reached maturity. Maturation may require only a few years, as in Kentucky wisteria, or nearly twenty, as in Chinese wisteria. Maturation can be forced by physically abusing the main trunk, root pruning, or drought stress.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — The {{characteristics}} of cuttings of five cultivars of local malay apple (Syzygium malaccense L.) was studied in Ternate Island, Indonesia. Hardwood cuttings of malay apple were planted in two combinations {{of media and}} hormone treatments. During 5 months experiment, can be found that <b>hardwood</b> <b>cutting</b> of malay apple with top soil+ sand and NAA 1000 ppm had the best performance in producing shoots and roots for cuttings of malay apple in a short period. Although, each of these cultivars has different performance to rooting and shooting, but its can be propagated by cuttings. Therefore, {{the result of this}} research is expected to contribute for conservation of malay apple as a source of germplasm for further research and commercialization of malay apple as new potential fruit in the international market demand...|$|E

40|$|Different {{experimental}} conditions have {{been compared to}} achieve a high efﬁciency in embryogenic calli initiation from 'Macabeo' and 'Tempranillo' anthers. Speciﬁcally, two stages of anther development were tested (corresponding to tetrad cells or uninucleate pollen), and direct culture of anthers was compared to culture after a cold treatment of inﬂorescences (4 °C during 48 h). In addition, two induction media (C 1 P and B 2), mainly differing by microelement and cytokinin levels, were evaluated. Experiment repeatability was also examined with a repetition of anther culture one week later. Callus initiation was similar in all media and treatments for both cultivars, usually starting from the anther ﬁlament. A simple protocol for efﬁcient induction of embryogenesis in 'Macabeo' and 'Tempranillo' consisted in: (i) selecting the ﬁrst inﬂorescence from <b>hardwood</b> <b>cutting,</b> (ii) excising anthers at uninucleate pollen stage without cold treatment of the inﬂorescences, (iii) incubating anthers on C 1 P medium. The procedure used for embryo germination and plant regeneration, allowed to obtain a conversion rate up to 75 % in 'Macabeo' and 60 % in 'Tempranillo'.

40|$|Cover crop is {{important}} for the plantation industry in Malaysia especially for oil palm and rubber plantation due to its high drought tolerance, efficient control against weed, high biomass production and tolerant to pest and diseases. At present, plantation industry had faced problem because the seed of Mucuna bracteata as a cover crop is becoming more expensive, that is about RM 280 /kg. This is because the seed of M bracteata need to be imported from other countries like India and need to apply permit from the Department of Agriculture (Quarantine Department), Malaysia. In order to solve this problem, the study about M. bracteata propagation by seed and stern cutting has been carried out to determine the growth performance of propagation of M bracteata in a peatmoss medium. According to the result obtained, all the crop that propagate through the seed, semi-hardwood and <b>hardwood</b> <b>cutting</b> are growing successfully and the crop prior to planting into the fields. From the results obtained, it showed there is no significant different in term of number of leaves and the number of shoots between the treatments.

While, in term of length of root and leaf area index (LAI), the result had showed there was significant different between the treatment. The seed propagation as a treatment one has the higher average of the length of roots and leaf area index (LAI) compared to the semi-hardwood and hardwood propagation. This study will help the oil palm and rubber industry to maximize their profit by reducing the cost to buy seeds of M bracteata. Besides that, the documentation of this research can provide information to farmers about the suitable technique and methods regarding the propagation of M bracteata either by seed or stern cutting...|$|E

No presente trabalho estudou-se a propagação vegetativa dessa espécie, visando a obtenção de uma forma eficiente de formação de mudas. Foram testados diferentes tipos de estaca (medianas com 4 folhas, medianas com 2 folhas, medianas sem folhas e apicais), tamanhos de estacas lenhosas (5, 10, 15 e 20 cm) e substratos (casca de arroz carbonizada, vermiculita, solo e Plantmax®). Todos os tipos de estaca apresentaram altas taxas de enraizamento, comprovando que a L. alba é uma espécie de fácil enraizamento. As estacas medianas com quatro folhas foram as que apresentaram o maior desenvolvimento radicial, ao contrário das estacas sem folhas. As estacas com duas folhas também apresentaram bom crescimento radicial, facilidade de manuseio e o dobro do rendimento no preparo das estacas em relação as com quatro folhas. Os substratos não afetaram a porcentagem de enraizamento, mas a maior massa de raízes foi obtida com casca de arroz carbonizada. O aumento do tamanho da estaca lenhosa proporcionou um aumento linear em todas as variáveis analisadas. Conclui-se que a produção de mudas de L. alba pode ser realizada com estacas semilenhosas com um par de folhas ou com estacas lenhosas com 20 cm de comprimento em substratos porosos e sem necessidade de irrigação por nebulização. Lippia alba is a {{medicinal plant}} {{native of the}} South America it is used because of its sedative property. In this work the cutting propagation of this species was studied aiming at obtain an efficient protocol of plant production. Different types of cuttings were tested (middle with 4 leaves, middle with two leaves, middle without leaves and apical), length of hardwood cuttings (5, 10, 15 and 20 cm) and substrates (carbonized rice hulls, vermiculite, soil and Plantmax®). All types of cuttings showed high rates of rooting, confirming that L. alba is an easy to root species.
