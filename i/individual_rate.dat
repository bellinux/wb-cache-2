25|$|Dailly was {{the scene}} of an {{ammunition}} explosion on 28 May, 1946, when about 5500 105mm shells, amounting to 449 tons, exploded in three separate magazines successively. The blast threw four 105mm guns from their emplacements and damaged six more. Six construction workers were killed, part of a crew working on a funicular shaft linking Dailly to the upper part of Savatan. The explosion was attributed to decomposition of nitrocellulose propellant. Two similar explosions happened at Grisons in June 1946 and at Blausee-Mitholz in 1947, without loss of life. The damage to Dailly resulted in a comprehensive modernization of the fort, with additions of 81mm and 120mm mortars, removal of obsolete weapons and the installation of two modern 150mm gun turrets. An underground caserne for 650 men was built at this time, with NBC protection. The four 105mm guns of the northern casemates and the two 105mm guns of the central casemate were repaired and upgraded, but the four guns of the south battery were never replaced. The new 150mm gun turrets were mounted on barbettes deep, with an <b>individual</b> <b>rate</b> of fire of 22 rounds per minute in bursts, or 15 rounds per minute sustained. Design began in 1949, with the first test firings in 1960.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{a model of}} a rating agency with multiple clients, in which each client has a separate market that forms a belief {{about the quality of the}} client after the agency issues a rating. When the clients are <b>rated</b> separately (<b>individual</b> <b>rating),</b> the credibility of a good rating in an inflationary equilibrium of the signaling game is limited by the incentive of the agency to exaggerate the quality of the client. In centralized rating, the agency rates all clients together and shares the rating information among all markets. This allows the agency to coordinate the ratings and achieve a higher average level of credibility for its good ratings than in <b>individual</b> <b>rating.</b> In decentralized rating, the ratings are again shared among all markets, but each client is rated by a self-interested rater of the agency with no access to the quality information of other clients. When the underlying qualities of the clients are correlated, decentralized rating leads to a smaller degree of rating inflation and hence a greater level of credibility than in <b>individual</b> <b>rating.</b> Comparing centralized rating with decentralized rating, we find that centralized rating dominates decentralized rating for the agency when the underlying qualities are weakly correlated, but the reverse holds when the qualities are strongly correlated.

5000|$|Number pooling is not {{practiced in}} Canada. Every {{competing}} carrier is issued blocks of 10,000 numbers for every rate centre where it offers service. <b>Individual</b> <b>rate</b> centres exist {{even in the}} smallest villages. Even tiny unincorporated villages receive multiple blocks of 10,000 numbers. Larger cities, particularly [...] "megacities" [...] created through amalgamations in the 1990s and early 2000s, have multiple rate centres which were not combined for years, if at all. For example, Mississauga, Canada's sixth-largest city, is split between five rate centres {{even though it has}} been a single municipality since 1974. Hamilton, the nation's ninth-largest city, is split between nine rate centres, while Ottawa is split between 11. Overlays became the preferred relief solution in Canada in part because {{it is not possible to}} reassign a number from a smaller rate centre to a larger one, even when the smaller rate centre has enough numbers to serve it. As mentioned above, by 2013 seven-digit dialling had been eliminated in all eight of Canada's original numbering plan areas.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of three independent chapters on the elicitation of <b>individual</b> discount <b>rates</b> and on the estimation of gambling prevalence in Denmark. The first chapter, “Discount Rate Sensitivity to Background Consumption and Consumption Smoothing,” studies the sensitivity of <b>individual</b> discount <b>rates</b> with respect to background consumption and consumption smoothing. I use simulated choice data from standard decision tasks in time preference experiments and show that <b>individual</b> discount <b>rates</b> are sensitive to assumptions with respect to background consumption and consumption smoothing if the utility function is non-linear and exogenous. However, if discount rates and the utility function are elicited jointly, discount rates are robust to assumptions on time-invariant background consumption and consumption smoothing.
