25|$|Masoud is a {{graduate}} of the American University in Cairo and has studied Islamic Theology & Sciences under the tutelage of numerous prominent scholars for over ten years. His studies <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> <b>him</b> to many cities in both Muslim and non-Muslim countries in search of all authentic sources that convey the inner, esoteric spirit of Islam as well as the orthodox understanding of its Sacred law. Masoud also holds an MPhil degree in Psychology and Religion from the University of Cambridge, and is currently pursuing a PhD there. Masoud is also known as M. W. Zackie (his initials and middle name) in some academic publications and productions.|$|E
25|$|He was {{a lifelong}} {{supporter}} of the Liberal Party, lining up on the Irish Home Rule and non-imperialist sides of the splits in {{the party of the}} late nineteenth century. He supported temperance, and married into a prominent Liberal, aristocratic and temperance family, the Carlisles. He made a number of moves that might <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> <b>him</b> into parliamentary politics, initially by tentative thoughts about standing in elections during the 1890s. In 1901-2 he was in close contact with the Independent Labour Party. But the overall effect of the Second Boer War was to drive him back into the academic career he had put on hold in 1898, resigning his Glasgow chair (effective from April 1899).|$|E

500|$|Boycott {{attended}} Fitzwilliam Primary School. There {{he won a}} Len Hutton batting {{award for}} scoring 45runs and capturing six wickets for 10runs in a school match. At age 10, he joined Ackworth Cricket Club, demonstrating [...] "outstanding ability." [...] At the age of 11 he failed the examinations that would <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> <b>him</b> to grammar school, and instead went to the local Kinsley Secondary Modern School. A year later, however, he passed his late-entry exams, and transferred to Hemsworth Grammar School. His cricket prowess was such that he captained the school's cricket First XI {{at the age of}} 15. During winters he attended an indoor cricket school, where he was coached by former county professional Johnny Lawrence.|$|E
500|$|There is torrential rain; {{there are}} savages; there are {{dangerous}} trips in small boats. Only {{in the final}} paragraph does Radau reflect on it all: [...] "We have tried, in this study on Wallace's two volumes, to give {{an idea of what}} he saw in his eight year stay in the Far East." [...] He admits he has left out most of the natural history, and regrets not having space for more [...] "charming pages" [...] which would <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> <b>him</b> too far. He joins Wallace in reflecting on the relative state of [...] "civilized" [...] and [...] "savage", wondering which is morally superior, and notes the [...] "nostalgia for the primitive state", concluding that civilisation brings the benefit of reason to restrain hasty action.|$|E

500|$|Bure was {{selected}} 113th {{overall in the}} sixth round Draft by the Vancouver Canucks, following his rookie season with CSKA Moscow. The pick was controversial, as the Canucks had chosen him seemingly a year ahead of his eligible draft season. At the age of 18, he was available to be chosen {{in the first three}} rounds of the draft, but to be selected any later, he would have needed to play at least two seasons—with a minimum of 11 games per season—for his elite-level Soviet club, the Central Red Army. While most teams believed he was ineligible, the Canucks' head scout at the time, Mike Penny, discovered Bure had played in additional exhibition and international games to make him an eligible late-round draft choice a year early. Jack Button, the Washington Capitals' director of player personnel, admitted [...] "everybody would <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> <b>him</b> earlier. We assumed he was not eligible... you've got to give the Canucks credit for doing their homework." ...|$|E
500|$|Some {{writers have}} focused on Mulberry Streets {{connections}} to elements of Geisel's life, particularly his childhood in Springfield, Massachusetts. Geisel probably named the street in his story after a real-life Mulberry Street in Springfield. However, Guy McLain, director of the Springfield Museum, contends that Geisel might have chosen the street {{mainly because of the}} sound and rhythm of its name. Lewis Nichols, writing in 1962 {{on the occasion of the}} book's 25th anniversary, largely confirmed this view, writing that in the book's creation [...] "there was no particular Mulberry Street in view, although there was one of the name in Springfield, Mass., where Mr. Geisel was born, and the subconscious may <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> <b>him</b> back." [...] Other writers have pointed out that the motorcycles the policemen use to escort the parade in Mulberry Street resemble Indian motorcycles, which were manufactured in Springfield during Geisel's childhood. Cori Urban claimed that the mayor in the story resembles Fordis C. Parker, who was mayor of Springfield from 1925 to 1929.|$|E
500|$|Over the {{following}} seasons, Palairet moved to [...] "the front rank of amateur batsmen," [...] according to W. G. Grace. He played for Arthur Shrewsbury's England XI against Australia in 1893, and scored 71 runs as the English side won by an innings and 153 runs. He scored five half-centuries for Somerset that summer, and his batting average of 28.94 in the County Championship was bettered only by Hewett among his teammates. The next year, Palairet {{made a big}} score against his former university. Facing a team that included his brother, Richard Palairet, and was captained by Fry, he made 181 runs in Somerset's second innings, the highest first-class score of his career to that point. He also scored a century against Nottinghamshire, making 119 runs before being out leg before wicket to his old trainer Attewell. He fell just short of 1,000 first-class runs in 1894; though two half-centuries scored against the touring South Africans in matches not considered first-class would <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> <b>him</b> over the milestone.|$|E
