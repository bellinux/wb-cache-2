5|$|A Han kingdom {{was much}} like a commandery in size and administration, <b>except</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> officially, and after 145 BC, nominally, the fief of a {{relative}} to the emperor, including brothers, uncles, nephews, and sons—excluding the heir apparent. The policy of awarding kingdoms only to imperial relatives was gradually adopted by the founder Emperor Gaozu of Han (r. 202–195 BC), {{as many of the}} early kings were non-relatives who were leading officers during the Chu-Han contention (206–202 BC). Kingdoms were usually inherited by the king's eldest son born to his queen.|$|E

Titled 'Most Haunted As Live', the 2-hour special came from HM Prison Shrewsbury. The show was unedited and uncut, showing the Most Haunted team returning to one of their most frightening paranormal locations to date.|$|E
25|$|Grantham, with Stamford, {{had been}} {{earmarked}} for a bypass {{before the war}} in 1939. There were 60 serious accidents a year, with three to four deaths. After the war, on 21 November 1945, {{there was a meeting}} at the Guildhall about the proposed bypass of the London-Edinburgh-Thurso trunk road for Grantham and Great Gonerby. This was the first enquiry into a trunk road scheme in the country after the war. The proposed route followed the current line, from Little Ponton to College Farm, <b>except</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> to be a single carriageway road.|$|E

25|$|Oz was {{not always}} a fairyland, I am told. Once it was much like other lands, <b>except</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> shut in by a dreadful desert of sandy wastes that lay all around it, thus {{preventing}} its people from all contact {{with the rest of}} the world. Seeing this isolation, the fairy band of Queen Lurline, passing over Oz while on a journey, enchanted the country and so made it a Fairyland. And Queen Lurline left one of her fairies to rule this enchanted Land of Oz, and then passed on and forgot all about it.|$|E
25|$|Due to Lionsgate's lack of promotion, {{director}} Bousman and creator Zdunich {{did much}} of their own promotion. To coincide with the film's release, Bousman, Smith, and Zdunich, as well as various cast members, did a Repo! Road Tour version of the film. The tour was set up for one-night screenings of the film in seven different cities across the United States. Principal cast and crew also did extensive Q sessions following each screening. Because of strong ticket sales, a second and third touring session were added, {{in addition to a}} British tour across four locations. A Repo! Road Show was announced on January 28 in 10 cities. This show was similar to the Repo! Road Tour, <b>except</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> almost completely fan-run.|$|E
25|$|The {{draft of}} the L-program was in essence an update of the data {{collected}} for the Commander-in-Chief a year earlier. The S-program, that emerged {{now for the first}} time, was described as a program to develop the knowledge about nuclear weapons which required the creation of Swedish defensive doctrine without nuclear weapons, which would be adopted to fight a war in which a nuclear strike could occur. Despite a completely different description of the purpose, the S-program included similar activities as the L-program, <b>except</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> stripped-down to around 75% of the cost. The S-program fit both the Chief's goal to acquire nuclear weapons and the Social Democratic Government's ambivalence, which the FOA under its new chief director, Martin Fehrm, had apparently realized. Thus, with such a proposition, the Government could fund almost all research activities necessary to pursue the Swedish nuclear weapons program, yet it asserted not to do so.|$|E

25|$|On 1 January 1885 the Malta Post Office was {{separated}} from the British Post Office after this had been consented back in 1883. The first definitives were issued with the values up to 1/-, with the colours reflecting Malta joining the UPU. The halfpenny {{was the same as}} the 1860 stamp <b>except</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> green. The stamps were designs of Queen Victoria like most British colonies, but also used the Maltese cross as a heraldic device. British stamps were no longer valid from this date except for mail from British military zones, where British stamps were used until 1979. A large format 5-shilling value complemented the set in 1886 and this was used until 1911. Also in 1886, the GPO moved to Palazzo Parisio in Merchants Street, Valletta. Police stations in several villages began to sell stamps around 1891. Bollo personale, or postmen's personal handstamps, were used to indicate which postman delivered a particular letter. The earliest recorded use is 16 August 1888 while the latest is 29 September 1949.|$|E
500|$|Another failure, {{identified}} by Bracha, is {{not found in}} what the Statute covered, but in what it did not. The Statute did not provide any means for identifying authors, did not identify what constituted authored works, and covered only [...] "books", even while discussing [...] "property" [...] as a whole. Moreover, the right provided was merely that of [...] "making and selling... exact reprints. To a large extent, the new regime was the old stationer's privilege, <b>except</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> universalised, capped in time, and formally conferred upon authors rather than publishers". The effect of the Statute on authors was also minimal. Previously, publishers would have bought the original manuscript from writers for a lump sum; {{with the passage of}} the Statute, they simply did the same thing, but with the manuscript's copyright as well. The remaining economic power of the Company also allowed them to pressure booksellers and distributors into continuing their past arrangements, meaning that even theoretically [...] "public domain" [...] works were, in practise, still treated as copyrighted.|$|E

60|$|I now {{questioned}} the brigadier touching that peculiar usage {{of his country}} which rendered Leaphigh opinions concerning the Leaplow institutions, society, and manners of so much value in the market of the latter. To this I got but an indifferent answer, <b>except</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> to say, that his countrymen, having cleared the interests connected with the subjects from the rubbish of time, and set everything at work, on the philosophical basis of reason and common sense, were exceedingly desirous of knowing what other people thought {{of the success of}} the experiment.|$|E
