This research focused {{on the influence of}} leadership, organisational values and organisational change on employee engagement within a volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous (VUCA) environment. The construct leadership was further examined using two hierarchical levels, <b>employee</b> <b>s</b> line manager and <b>employee</b> <b>s</b> senior leaders to deepen the understanding of the influence these levels of leadership have on employee engagement A quantitative research approach was followed wherein a non-random convenience sample (N = 969) of permanent staff operating within the Retail Operations Specialities function of South Africa s largest non-food retailer participated in the study. Regression analysis was conducted to determine the strength {{of the relationship between the}} dependent (employee engagement) and independent variables for each research question. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) test was conducted to analyse the differences among group means and their associated procedures. <b>Employee</b> <b>s</b> senior leaders were found to have a stronger influence on <b>employee</b> <b>s</b> engagement levels in comparison to <b>employee</b> <b>s</b> line managers. In addition the study found that the application of organisational values have a positive influence on employee engagement whilst organisational change was found to have the strongest influence on employee engagement explaining 41. 2 % of the variance in employee engagement. The findings of the study challenges the current body of research by identifying that within a VUCA environment when <b>employee</b> <b>s</b> leave the organisation they leave their senior leaders not their line managers.

This {{made it possible to}} change from the original three-color dot system to the simpler vertical color-line system. Most of the color television receivers in the world now use this system. Born in Budapest, Hungary, Parker received his primary and secondary education in Hungary. Following graduation, he immigrated to the United States, becoming a naturalized citizen in 1932. After learning English, he studied at the City College of New York. Parker first gained publicity in 1929 with a hotel radio system that used low-frequency signals to broadcast over the electric wires within the building. This made it possible to receive noiseless reception with one-tube receivers. Later he worked on radio direction finders for airplanes and cathode ray oscilloscopes, which led to work on television and closed circuit television systems. During World War II, Parker designed and manufactured portable radio transmitters for military use. Later he invented electrical instruments operating on somewhat different principles which were greatly superior in performance and which were the bases for the Parker Instrument Corporation. The company was chosen by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to furnish select instruments for use in the manned Apollo flights to the moon. Parker received more than 200 United States and foreign patents. [URL]...|$|R

Noted by many critics for its power and profundity, the sound of this late 1960 <b>s</b> <b>invention</b> perhaps epitomises the idea of a so-called “sublime experience”: it prompts an unnerving moment; a moment that unsettles and overwhelms its listeners; an experience in which words fail and all points of comparison disappear. Drawing upon the ideas of philosophers such as Edmund Burke, Immanuel Kant, and Jean-François Lyotard, this thesis attempts to sketch out a few of the processes through which such feelings of sublimity may arise in the encounter with this sound. The discussion is specifcally centred around three of the author's experiences, each of which focuses on common characteristics of the bow chime's sound. Overall, this thesis will form three proposals as {{to the nature of the}} bow chime's sublimity, which concern, respectively, the terror of the sound's intense loudness, the unimaginable nature of its prolonged duration, and the 'strangeness' of its timbre...|$|R
