Riot police from the Met's TSG, accompanied by City of London police dog handlers, had arrived there from the cordon in Threadneedle Street to <b>help</b> <b>their</b> colleagues.|$|E
5|$|Grouped into cooperatives, women play {{a leading}} role in the island's economy. Notably through microcredit, they engage in fishing-related activities, such as smoking fish and {{processing}} shrimp, oysters, and shellfish in general. As there is no industrial activity on the island (the closest such activity is in Ziguinchor), the island is experiencing a rural exodus of young people. They return to <b>help</b> <b>their</b> parents in the rice fields and participate in religious ceremonies during the dry season, but they tend to settle off the island permanently.|$|E

(in an OWW radio interview Wippleman revealed that the two never got along well) WWF management originally wanted her to have an on-screen feud with Bull Nakano, but there was a change of plans after Nakano was charged with cocaine possession.|$|E

She also said that her retelling, though it was inspired by and maintained the spirit of Ismail's original, featured a new plot as well as new songs by Titiek Puspa: the film follows three sisters who move to Maumere, Flores, to <b>help</b> <b>their</b> father manage a hotel. Ini Kisah Tiga Dara, which stars , Tara Basro, and Tatyana Akman, was released on 1 September 2016.|$|E
5|$|Cleveland and Treasury Secretary Daniel Manning stood {{firmly on}} the side of the gold standard, and tried to reduce the amount of silver that the {{government}} was required to coin under the Bland-Allison Act of 1878. Cleveland unsuccessfully appealed to Congress to repeal this law before he was inaugurated. Angered Westerners and Southerners advocated for cheap money to <b>help</b> <b>their</b> poorer constituents. In reply, one of the foremost silverites, Richard P. Bland, introduced a bill in 1886 that would require the government to coin unlimited amounts of silver, inflating the then-deflating currency. While Bland's bill was defeated, so was a bill the administration favored that would repeal any silver coinage requirement. The result was a retention of the status quo, and a postponement of the resolution of the Free Silver issue.|$|E
5|$|Collectively, {{amateur astronomers}} observe {{a variety of}} {{celestial}} objects and phenomena sometimes with equipment that they build themselves. Common targets of amateur astronomers include the Sun, the Moon, planets, stars, comets, meteor showers, {{and a variety of}} deep-sky objects such as star clusters, galaxies, and nebulae. Astronomy clubs are located throughout the world and many have programs to <b>help</b> <b>their</b> members set up and complete observational programs including those to observe all the objects in the Messier (110 objects) or Herschel 400 catalogues of points of interest in the night sky. One branch of amateur astronomy, amateur astrophotography, involves the taking of photos of the night sky. Many amateurs like to specialize in the observation of particular objects, types of objects, or types of events which interest them.|$|E

5|$|During {{pre-season}} Scarborough manager Nick Henry stated {{his hope}} that Coulson, along with fellow youngster Ryan Blott, would {{fill the gap}} left by some high-profile departures in the summer. His first goal of 2005–06 came after scoring an 87th-minute equaliser in a 1–1 draw away to Altrincham on 20 September 2005, having entered the match as a second-half substitute. He went on trial with League One club Barnsley in January 2006 and the following month manager Andy Ritchie expressed his desire to sign Coulson in the summer. Despite this, Coulson decided against extending his trial at Barnsley, opting {{to return to the}} Scarborough team to <b>help</b> <b>their</b> fight against relegation. He finished the season seven goals from 33 appearances as Scarborough were relegated to the Conference North and was awarded the club's annual Players' Player of the Year and Fans' Player of the Year awards.|$|E

Robert Mitchum plays an American oil tycoon {{who falls in love}} with Kerr and Jean Simmons plays an eccentric American heiress who is Grant's former girlfriend. The film was a financial disappointment in the US, but successful in England where the original stage version had been a West End hit.|$|E
5|$|In 1980, Fonda {{starred in}} 9 to 5 with Lily Tomlin and Dolly Parton. The film {{was a huge}} {{critical}} and box office success, becoming the second highest-grossing release of the year.

She achieved this goal when she purchased the screen rights to the play On Golden Pond, specifically for her father and her. On Golden Pond, which also starred Katharine Hepburn, brought Henry Fonda his only Academy Award for Best Actor, which Jane accepted on his behalf, as he was ill and could not leave home.

5|$|In {{parallel}} with the second investigation, a case was being prepared against Det Ch Supt Melvin and Det Insp Dingle. In July 1992 Melvin was charged with perjury and conspiracy to pervert the course of justice, and Dingle with conspiracy. In 1994 their lawyers applied for access to information from Nove's inquiry, {{on the grounds that}} it might <b>help</b> <b>their</b> clients; anything that implicated Winston Silcott would support the detectives' contention that their interview notes were genuine and that Silcott really had, in effect, confessed.

5|$|Rosecroft {{was sold}} to Mark Vogel in 1987. Vogel made several {{mistakes}} that hurt the horse racing industry in Maryland. Three years later, {{he was arrested for}} possession of cocaine, and his company went into bankruptcy. Rosecroft {{was sold to}} Weisman's Colt Enterprises in 1991. In that same year, the grandstand caught fire and was reconstructed in 1993 for $3.6 million. In 1995, after losing millions, the relatives of Weisman sold Rosecroft to Cloverleaf Enterprises. In the 2000s, Cloverleaf attempted to sell Rosecroft multiple times, but due to lawsuits and politics, all the potential buyers became uninterested. Nearby states legalized casinos to <b>help</b> <b>their</b> racetracks. Money generated from the casinos was used to increase the purses and handle (daily betting turnover), and Rosecroft was unable to produce the same amount of money. After filing for bankruptcy once again, Rosecroft Raceway closed down in 2010. The next year, Penn National Gaming purchased the racetrack with the hope to make it a racino, and Rosecroft reopened in 2011.|$|E
