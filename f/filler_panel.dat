2500|$|The GT350 is a post-title upgrade {{available}} from Shelby. Customers {{can have their}} 2011 Mustangs shipped directly to Shelby's Las Vegas facility to be converted or they can deliver the car themselves. Automatics {{will be available for}} conversion as a naturally aspirated tune producing up to 440 horsepower, and manuals have the option of NA or fitted with a Ford Racing supercharger to produce 525 horsepower, or {{at the expense of the}} warranty, 624 horsepower, a Ford Racing suspension system (The first 100 are being fitted with the Eibach suspension carried over from the GT500 Supersnake), Baer brakes in front and optional in rear, Custom Borla exhaust system, 19" [...] Cragar wheels, and more. For the exterior, Shelby fits a new front fascia, front splitter, functional hood scoop, functional brake cooling ducts, tail light trim, rear deck lid <b>filler</b> <b>panel,</b> and a rear fascia with center exhaust exit. Performance White with Guardsman Blue racing stripes will be the only available color combination for 2011 models. 2012 models will be available in other colors, but will lose the 45th Anniversary badge of the 2011.|$|E
2500|$|The Arab Oil Embargo of October 1973 {{came just}} as the 1974 model year began. AMC {{improved}} the Gremlin's back seat. A deeper front fascia made the car appear longer. A larger front bumper was mounted on self-restoring telescoping gas and oil cylinders. Unlike most other designs, the Gremlin did not use <b>filler</b> <b>panel</b> between bumper and body. A stronger rear bumper was set lower—front and rear passenger car bumpers were now required by NHTSA to have uniform heights, take angle impacts, and sustain [...] impacts with no damage. The rear fascia was modified slightly to blend with the design changes. The Gremlin X stripe pattern was given a [...] "hockey stick" [...] look for 1974: the stripes followed the window line as it tapered aft, and swept up now to include four diagonal lines on the wide C-pillar. A new typeface for nameplates was used by AMC for 1974, including on the Gremlin. With the car's 1974 model year extended into November to delay the need to install catalytic converters required by United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 2004 regulations starting with 1975 models, AMC sold 171,128 1974 Gremlins, an increase of nearly 40% over 1973 and 130% over 1971.|$|E

50|$|A. Except {{in cases}} {{explicitly}} permitted in the NASCAR rules, installation of additional components and/or modifications of existing components {{to affect the}} aerodynamic properties of the vehicle will not be permitted, including but not limited to, safety systems, chassis and roll cage, suspension, steering systems, brake systems, heat shields, body fillers, body sealers, <b>filler</b> <b>panels,</b> drivetrain components and exhaust components.|$|R
30|$|Usually, the infill {{walls of}} a {{building}} are not considered as elements of the force-resisting system. In many instances, structural walls are assumed to resist racking loads due to wind and earthquake. Such walls are generally known as shear walls and can also carry vertical loads and are designed {{as an integral part}} of the structures. Other types of walls are called <b>filler</b> <b>panels,</b> which are used to partition space or to enclose structures. Such panels occupy a rectangular space between two adjacent columns and two successive stories. But these <b>filler</b> <b>panels</b> can have considerable influences on the lateral response of a building. Nowadays, soft story in buildings is common at the parking level as there is absence of infill walls, whereas the stories above are filled with partition walls. Such frames have less capacity to bear lateral loads. Portal frames tested up to collapse have drawn attention of several investigators in the recent past for inherent structural advantage of such frames.|$|R
50|$|In {{his rookie}} season of 2016, Self was penalized two times {{in the first three}} races. After the first race at Daytona, he was given a warning for an illegal {{triangular}} <b>filler</b> <b>panel.</b> After the third race at Martinsville, he was given a warning for trailing arm infractions.|$|E
5000|$|As the B-pillar {{design of}} the Fairmont Futura coupe lent itself to the {{conversion}} on an unofficial basis, there are several unique features to the Durango that identify it as a vehicle converted by National Coach. [...] With {{the exception of a}} prototype based upon a 1979 Mercury Z-7, all examples were based upon the Fairmont Futura. [...] Conversions by National Coach, which are the only versions with a functioning tailgate, feature a fiberglass <b>filler</b> <b>panel</b> between the cargo bed and the tailgate; the {{design of the}} panel stores the tailgate hinges when it is folded down.|$|E
50|$|Available wheelbases were; 135.5 inches, 159.5 inches, and 183.5 inches. The C3500 HD {{frames are}} very {{different}} from the C/K3500 cab and chassis. The C/K3500 cab and chassis and C3500 HD rear frame rails are spaced at industry standard 34 inches for easy fitment of bodies but that is where the similarity ends. The HD frame is much heavier and exits straight out behind the high mounted cab necessitating the unmistakable HD <b>filler</b> <b>panel</b> between the bumper and grille. The front fenders were also equipped with the same flares used on 4x4 models of the lighter trucks to cover the increased track width and larger tires.|$|E
50|$|Much {{attention}} {{was given to}} aerodynamic considerations, with the body being de-guttered/seam welded {{and the use of}} <b>filler</b> <b>panels</b> for the door pillars and 935-style mirrors. Prototype models had NACA-style intercooler intake ducts over the rear fenders (later dropped, as it was discovered that air was pulled out, rather than in, at speed due to a low-pressure area), while later models had additional slots in the rear bumper corners for the air to exit.|$|R
5000|$|Cars for the US market were {{equipped}} with bulky, massive, heavy, protruding bumpers {{to comply with}} the 5-mile-per-hour bumper standard in effect from 1973 to 1982. This often meant additional overall vehicle length, as well as new front and rear designs to incorporate the stronger energy absorbing bumpers. Passenger cars featured gap-concealing flexible <b>filler</b> <b>panels</b> between the bumpers and the car's bodywork causing them to have a [...] "massive, blockish look". A notable exception that year was the new AMC Matador coupe that featured [...] "free standing" [...] bumpers with rubber gaiters alone to conceal the retractable shock absorbers.|$|R
50|$|These newer cars can be {{identified}} by their silver sight shields (bumper <b>filler</b> <b>panels)</b> which Ford used on specially painted fleet-ordered cars. They also had the luxury chrome mirrors {{like one of the}} pilot cars. Even though the body-colored sport mirrors were still a Torino option in 1976, they could not be installed on a fleet-ordered specialty-painted car, as Ford had no provision for producing those mirrors in anything other than the regular production colors listed for that year; since the 2B bright red was a special fleet-ordered color for the '76 model year, the cars came equipped with the chrome mirrors. The body-side mouldings were installed on these cars and the stripe was, unlike the pilot cars, integrated with the mouldings.|$|R
5000|$|While a {{rack unit}} {{is defined as}} 44.50 mm, a front panel or <b>filler</b> <b>panel</b> in a rack is not an exact {{multiple}} of this height. To allow space between adjacent rack-mounted components, a panel is [...] inch (0.03125 in) less in height than the full number of rack units would imply. Thus, a 1U front panel would be 1.721 in tall. If n is number of rack units, the ideal formula for panel height is h = (1.752n − 0.031) for calculating in inches, and h = (44.5n − 0.794) for calculating in mm. Note, however, that manufacturing allows for dimensions with less precision.|$|E
50|$|Dodge {{pioneered the}} American 15-passenger van genre with the {{introduction}} of the Maxiwagon along with the other front engine B series vans that were new for 1971. Ford didn't produce a 15-passenger van until 1978, and GM did not introduce theirs until 1990. Little changed on Dodge vans produced between 1971 and 1977, with only a grille change from metal to plastic for the 1974 model year. 1978 was a transition year for B series vans, consisting of the nose from 1977 and earlier vans (with a one-year only Dodge symbol in the grille) but with a completely new dashboard and rear end cap. On the standard length vans, the rear end cap just contained new larger tail lamps, but the extended length Maxivan and Maxiwagon had a completely redesigned rear extension which was longer and had large windows that wrapped around the corners for better visibility. This was unique to the B vans, and this same extension was used until the B vans were discontinued in 2003. On the 1971-77 models, the rear side doors were set back about two feet towards the rear wheelwells, with a <b>filler</b> <b>panel</b> between them and the front doors. Passenger models had a small window between the front and rear doors. Early 1971 vans had black plastic door push buttons, an inlaid pentastar logo low right front fender, drum brakes and points type ignition. 1972 model year began a phase in of chrome door push buttons, electronic ignition, and front disc brakes. In 1978, the <b>filler</b> <b>panel</b> was removed and the doors were moved forward to be next to the front passenger door, similar to the Ford and Chevrolet vans.|$|E
5000|$|For 1971, {{the lineup}} was trimmed {{down to just}} one Sixty Special model, the Sixty Special Brougham. It still rode on an {{exclusive}} 133.0 in wheelbase, but with all-new sheet metal and a distinctive roof design. The formal new roof was clearly reminiscent of Bill Mitchell's original 1938 Sixty Special, with individually framed, rounded-corner side glass (outlined by a thin chrome bead). Also new on the vinyl top were C-pillar mounted opera lamps and a thick B-pillar - all of which heightened the limousine effect. To complete the [...] "custom-body" [...] look, {{the front and rear}} side doors had a narrow body <b>filler</b> <b>panel</b> between them. Despite the formal new look and higher levels of luxury, sales dropped slightly from last year, down to 15,200 units.|$|E
40|$|The {{technique}} {{of finding a}} finite number of first natural frequencies for geometrically nonlinear vibrations of layered elongated cylindrical panels at discrete consideration of components is proposed and verified. The influence of the radius of curvature on the natural frequencies of three- and five-layered panels is investigated. The dependence between the volume of <b>filler</b> three-layer <b>panels</b> and the lowest natural frequency has been established...|$|R
50|$|For 1983, slight reworkings {{under the}} hood added 10 {{horsepower}} (now rated at 135) to the standard 4.1-liter powerplant. Meanwhile, the Buick V6 credit-option was dropped. The biggest visible change was hardly noticeable - while the grille design was a carry-over {{from the previous year}} (and would be through 1986), the Cadillac script moved from the chrome header onto the grille itself. The wide parking lamps below the quad headlamps now had clear frosted lenses (previous years they were amber), with satin gold-colored winged Cadillac emblems centered on each lense. A very minor change in the rear was the deletion of the chrome tips {{on both sides of the}} lower deck lid trim. These little chrome corner pieces, mounted on the <b>filler</b> <b>panels,</b> were prone to pitting as they were made of a different material than the bright aluminum trunk trim and upper license late surround. Coupe de Ville's popular Cabriolet roof package added $415 to its $15,970 sticker price. While both models, including the $16,441 Sedan de Ville, could be ordered with the $1,150 d'Elegance package. 1983 was supposed to be the last year for the rear-drive DeVille, as new front-drive models would take over for 1984. However, numerous developmental delays caused DeVille to stay in rear-drive form for another year. Sales figures looked healthy, with a total of 109,004 sedans and 65,670 coupes (figures include DeVille and Fleetwood models).|$|R
2500|$|The 1979 Chevrolet Nova {{marked the}} end of the line for the rear-wheel-drive Nova. The front end was revised with square {{headlights}} and a new grille for the short run; [...] a modified horizontal-bar grille contained vertical parking lights. New chromed hood and fender moldings were installed, and new front-bumper <b>filler</b> <b>panels</b> gave the front end a more finished look. The lineup was the same as in 1978; the base-level hatchback, coupe, and sedan, plus the Custom coupe and sedan. As usual, base coupe and sedan proved to be the best sellers. Nova Customs had a special acoustical package including improved headlining and full hood insulation, along with other luxury extras, while the Rally Package returned, this time using the same grille as other '79 Novas. These final Novas were promoted for their [...] "solid value" [...] and [...] "reputation for dependability," [...] capitalizing upon a 17-year heritage that had begun with the Chevy II. Fewer than 98,000 examples were produced. [...] Regular production ended on December 22, 1978 but some cars badged [...] "Nova Custom" [...] were built on special order with luxury amenities in early 1979. The final Chevrolet Nova (Custom) built on special order would roll off the line in March 15, 1979 and this would be the end of the rear-drive Nova for good. Chevrolet's compact models were headed into the front-wheel-drive age and for 1980, Nova's place in the lineup would be taken over by the new and very different Chevrolet Citation.|$|R
50|$|The curved design scheme carried {{further to}} the rear of the Town Car, in the C-pillar (losing its opera windows) into the trunklid. To better {{differentiate}} itself from its Mercury counterpart, the Town Car switched to individual taillamps, deleting the <b>filler</b> <b>panel</b> on the trunklid; a large chrome surround was used on the trunklid to mount the license plate.In 2001, the stretched Town Car L was introduced, with a six-inch stretch in its wheelbase. To produce the variant at the lowest cost possible, the B-pillar was widened on 2001-2002 versions to use the existing rear door glass of the standard Town Car. In 2003, the Town Car L was redesigned, giving it model-specific doors proportioned to the longer roofline; these versions are distinguished by wider rear quarter glass in the doors.|$|E
50|$|The Carriage Roof option (still only {{available}} in white canvas-embossed vinyl; but now standard on Bill Blass Designer Series) received new interior rear {{quarter trim panel}} inserts (a blanked off, color-keyed padded vinyl insert <b>filler</b> <b>panel</b> covering {{the area where the}} deleted opera windows were - with round (non-switch-operated) reading/courtesy lights in the center of these panels on each side; thus effectively replacing 1978's rear quarter panel vanity mirrors). These new interior quarter trim panel inserts would also appear on the Collector's Series, (in color-keyed vinyl, or cloth - depending on the seat trim color) as the exterior landau roof design also eliminated the opera windows on this model. Here, though, the reading/courtesy lights in these quarter panel inserts had control switches above the rear seat quarter armrests, to allow them to operate as customary door-jamb activated interior courtesy lights, as well as rear seat passengers being able to switch them on and off independently as true reading lamps.|$|E
50|$|In March 1990, 4-door {{versions}} of the S-10 Blazer and Jimmy were introduced as a 1991 model; the 4-door had a 6.5in longer wheelbase (2-doors had a 100.5 in wheelbase - six inches (152 mm) longer than the Ford Bronco II) and a one-piece front grille with a painted black insert (1990 2-door S-10 Blazers and Jimmies had the 3-piece grille). This new grille also did away with the separate metal <b>filler</b> <b>panel</b> under the grille, since the grille is taller and took its place. Early production models between March and August 1990 were initially available as a four-wheel drive only; 2WD versions commenced production around Summer 1990. This came just months ahead of {{the introduction of the}} Ford Explorer, which replaced the Bronco II; six-and-a-half years after the segment-leading Cherokee debuted with four doors. Snowflake alloy wheels (similar to the ones used on the Chevrolet Astro/GMC Safari) were introduced, either painted charcoal gray or argent silver.|$|E
5000|$|The ten book series format was {{dictated}} by {{the limitations of the}} printing equipment used to print the bibles, which made it convenient to print a set of ten titles at a time, side by side on a large sheet which was then cut into strips, collated, folded, and stapled. Typically, a new set of ten would be issued every couple of months, all drawn by the same artist, featuring ten different cartoon characters or celebrities. For several months in 1935, Elmer Zilch and his publishers experimented with a ten-page format, issued with two-tone covers in four sets of eight, plus one set of ten (the [...] "Salesmen" [...] series) in the eight-page format. Each panel in this series was surrounded by an intricate engraved arabesque border, possibly intended as an anti-counterfeiting device as it was hard to reproduce, and the series became known to collectors as the [...] "Ornate Borders" [...] series. Only 42 bibles are known by collectors to have been issued in this style, and most of them were soon being reprinted in truncated 8-page versions. Often the added two pages were simply <b>filler</b> gag <b>panels</b> drawn by Zilch.|$|R
5000|$|In the {{freestyle}} footbag discipline, a 32 panel bag is {{the generally}} accepted standard (the number of panels on commercially available bags {{can range from}} 2 to 120 panels). Stitchers generally use Plastic Poly Pellets, sand, BB's, steel shot, lead shot, seed bead, or tungsten shot as filler. Most professional stitchers use a custom combination of different fillers to make the bag play better. Bags usually weigh between 40 and 65 grams, {{depending on the type}} of filler and amount of <b>filler</b> used. 32 <b>panel</b> bags do not stall as easily as a [...] "dirt bag" [...] or [...] "sand hack," [...] but set truer from the foot, allowing for more complex tricks. Professional footbags are usually made out of the fabrics ultrasuede light, facile, or amaretta. While these bags can last a long time with proper care, they are quite fragile relative to their more common crocheted cousins.|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{repeated}} weld repairs on the metallurgical characteristics, {{high cycle fatigue}} (HCF), and tensile properties of Inconel 718 butt weld joints were determined. A 1 / 4 in thick plate and a 1 / 2 in thick plate were used as well as tungsten inert gas welding, and Inconel 718 <b>filler</b> wire. Weld <b>panels</b> were subjected to 2, 6, and 12 repeated repairs and were made in a highly restrained condition. Post weld heat treatments were also conducted with the welded panel in the highly restrained condition. Results indicate that no significant metallurgical anomaly is evident {{as a result of}} up to twelve repeated weld repairs. No degradation in fatigue life is noted for up to twelve repeated repairs. Tensile results from specimens which contained up to twelve repeated weld repairs revealed no significant degradation in UTS and YS. However, a significant decrease in elongation is evident with specimens (solution treated and age hardened after welding) which contained twelve repeated repairs. The elongation loss is attributed to the presence of a severe notch on each side (fusion line) of the repair weld bead reinforcement...|$|R

5000|$|For 1973, 300 changes {{included}} new {{exterior and}} interior colors and new standard interior trim. Front and rear nameplate scripts [...] "Chevrolet Vega 2300" [...] were changed to [...] "Vega by Chevrolet". To meet the 1973 5 mph front bumper standards the front bumper, on stronger brackets, was extended 3 in, with a steel body-color <b>filler</b> <b>panel.</b> US-built Saginaw manual transmissions and a new shift linkage replaced the Opel units. The RPO L11 engine had a new Holley 5210C progressive two-barrel carburetor. New options included BR70-13 white-stripe steel-belted radial tires, full wheel covers, and body side molding with black rubber insert. Two new models were introduced mid-year: the estate wagon with DI-NOC wood grain sides and rear trim, and the LX notchback with vinyl roof finish. On May 17, 1973, the millionth Vega left the Lordstown Assembly plant - an orange GT hatchback with white sport stripes, power steering and neutral custom vinyl interior including exclusive vinyl door panels. A limited-edition [...] "Millionth Vega" [...] was introduced replicating the milestone car, with orange carpeting and Millionth Vega door handle accents.

With the car's 1974 model year extended into November to delay the need to install catalytic converters required by United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 2004 regulations starting with 1975 models, AMC sold 171,128 1974 Gremlins, an increase of nearly 40% over 1973 and 130% over 1971.|$|E
40|$|Precast {{concrete}} structure such as precast {{wall is a}} concept that is growing rapidly these days. However, the earthquake resistance is believed to be one of its drawbacks. Additionally, the large weight of solid elements also increase the building weight significantly which consequently increase the earthquake base shear force as well. Therefore, investigation on the seismic performance of precast concrete wall has been carried out. Three RC wall specimens using wire mesh reinforcement and EPS (Extended Polystyrene System) panel have been tested. This wall was designed as a structural wall that was capable in sustaining lateral loads (in-plane) yet were lightweight to reduce the total weight of the building. Parameter observed was the ratio of height to width (aspect ratio) of wall of 1. 0, 1. 5 and 2. 0 respectively with the aim to study the behaviour of brittle to ductile transition of the wall. Incremental static load tests were conducted until reaching peak load and then followed by displacement control until failure. Several data were measured at every stage of loading comprising lateral load-displacement behaviour, ultimate strength and collapse mechanism. The outcomes showed that precast concrete walls with a steel wire and EPS <b>panel</b> <b>filler</b> provided considerably good resistance against lateral load...|$|R
5000|$|From 1970 to 1978, the Capri {{was sold}} in North America through Ford's Lincoln-Mercury Division. All were German-produced. Headlamps were four round sealed-beams (shared with the Capri RS3000), and turn signal lamps were grille-mounted on all US-spec 1971-74 Capris and 1976-78 Capri IIs. Full {{instrumentation}} wasn't available on 1971-72 four-cylinder models but was made standard equipment from 1973 on. An optional interior decor package, changed by name to the [...] "Ghia" [...] package for the Capri II, featured deluxe interior trim and features. 1973 Ford Capris were the Mk I face-lift models featuring the new grille, larger taillights and new interior and dash. The 1973 model had the federally mandated 2.5 mph front bumper for '73. The bumper was extended, the gap closed with a silver <b>filler</b> <b>panel.</b> 1974 models had larger bumpers front and rear with wraparound urethane, body-color bumper covers to meet the revised Federal front and rear 5 mph standard. 1976-78 models were the re-designed hatchback models offered worldwide since 1974, fitted with the grille-mounted turn signal lamps and the required round sealed-beam headlamps, 5 mph body-color bumpers and catalytic converter, requiring no-lead fuel. In 1976, an 'S' (JPS) special edition featured black or white paint with gold-coloured wheels, gold pin-striping, and upgraded two-tone interior in beige and black. Due to late production of Capri IIs, there were no 1975 models sold in the USA.|$|E
40|$|This project {{investigated}} factors {{relating to}} tether use and misuse. Volunteer testing was performed with 37 subjects on 16 different vehicles using 2 forward-facing child restraints (Britax Marathon 70 or the Evenflo Triumph), with each subject performing 8 child restraint installations {{on a set}} of four vehicles. Vehicles were selected to provide a variety of general tether locations (<b>filler</b> <b>panel,</b> upper seatback, lower seatback, floor, or roof), as well as a variety of recommended tether routings with respect to the head restraint: under, over, around. Simple instruction regarding the LATCH system was provided after the fourth trial. Subjects used the tether in 89 % of the 294 forward-facing trials and attached the tether correctly in 57 % of installations. Subjects were more likely to use the tether if they were less than age 40, had previous tether experience, if the tether was located on a <b>filler</b> <b>panel,</b> and if the vehicle did not have any potentially confusing hardware. In addition, tether use was 83 % in the first four trials and increased to 95 % in the last four trials after instruction was provided. Subjects had the greatest difficulty in the pickup truck, which use loops of webbing as a router for the installed position and the tether anchor for the adjacent position; the tether was attached correctly in only 11 percent of installations. Tethers {{were more likely to be}} used when the tether anchor was located on the <b>filler</b> <b>panel</b> of sedans, which had a use rate of 95 percent, compared to when the anchor was located on the floor, roof, or seatback, which had use rates ranging from 79 to 89 percent. Tethers were less likely to be attached correctly when there was potentially confusing hardware present, 47 percent, compared to 70 percent. In addition, tether anchors located on the <b>filler</b> <b>panel</b> or mid seatback had higher rates of correct attachment, 60 and 69 percent, respectively, than those on the floor, roof, or lower seatback, which all had correct attachment rates lower than 50 percent. No vehicle tether hardware characteristics or vehicle manual directions were associated specifically with correct tether routing and head restraint position. Installations involving the single tether strap were 10 times as likely to have the tether attached correctly and 1. 7 times as likely to be routed correctly and have the head restraint positioned correctly, compared with installations with the v-shaped tether. Lack of instruction in most vehicle owner’s manuals regarding the routing of a V-style tether more challenging to use. With the single strap-style tether, it was more straightforward to have the tether strap flat and pull it tight, as well as to route it as directed. With the V-style tether, the adjustment hardware was often located underneath or close to the head restraint when installed in the vehicle, making it difficult to tighten. Recommendations to reduce tether misuse include labeling tether anchors, eliminating confusing hardware, allowing any head restraint position (including removal), providing instruction for routing V-style tethers, allowing options in tether routing, and redesigning tether anchors/routers found in pickup trucks...|$|E
