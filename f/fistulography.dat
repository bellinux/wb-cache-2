40|$|Background: Perianal fistula is a {{commonly}} encountered condition in routine surgical practice. Accurate presurgical mapping of these tracts {{is vital to}} prevent recurrence. We have assessed the effectiveness of percutaneous instillation of aqueous jelly prior to magnetic resonance (MR) <b>fistulography.</b> Aims and Objectives: To study the role of percutaneous instillation of aqueous jelly in fistulous tracts prior to MR <b>fistulography.</b> Materials and Methods: All patients with active discharge, referred for MR <b>fistulography</b> between January 2014 and April 2016, were included in this study. Approximately 3 – 5 ml of sterile aqueous jelly was percutaneously instilled into the external openings prior to MR <b>fistulography.</b> Post MR <b>fistulography,</b> patients were monitored till surgery for pain, fever, or bleeding. The type of fistulae, location of internal openings, lateral ramifications, and presence of abscess were compared with per operative findings for diagnostic accuracy. Results: Sixty-four patients enrolled in our study had undergone preoperative MR <b>fistulography</b> with aqueous jelly instillation. MR <b>fistulography</b> revealed a total of 77 tracts and showed a sensitivity and specificity of 100 % in delineation of type of tract. Forty-nine internal openings were identified with 94. 2 % sensitivity, 100 % specificity, and 95. 3 % accuracy. 90. 5 % sensitivity, 100 % specificity, and accuracy of 97 % were observed in delineation of lateral ramifications. None of the patients reported pain, fever, or bleeding post procedure till surgery. Conclusion: Percutaneous instillation of aqueous jelly prior to MR <b>fistulography</b> is a safe, cost effective, and accurate technique to provide a comprehensive delineation of the complex anatomy of perianal fistulae...|$|E

La estenosis es {{a su vez}} la principal causa de disfunción del acceso vascular protésico, y cuando éste problema no se logra detectar a tiempo, puede derivar en trombosis. Existen múltiples procedimientos para la detección de disfunción del acceso vascular desde la exploración física, mediciones de presión y flujo, así como pruebas de imagen no invasivas e invasivas. La Presión Venosa Dinámica inicial, es una herramienta sencilla de seguimiento del acceso vascular. Objetivos: El objetivo del estudio es correlacionar la presión venosa dinámica inicial y la recirculación como métodos de vigilancia del acceso vascular en pacientes en hemodiálisis. Material y métodos: Se evaluaron de forma prospectiva 21 pacientes con prótesis durante 1 año. Se registraron signos clínicos y parámetros de medición objetivos como recirculación por termodilución, presión venosa dinámica inicial con flujo de sangre de 200 ml/min, tiempo de hemostasia, y KT/V por OCM, contrastándose con los hallazgos de las pruebas de imagen. Se realizaron mediciones mensualmente, con un total de 244. Resultados: La prótesis de PTFE representó el 16, 6 % de los accesos vasculares en nuestra unidad durante el periodo de estudio. La media de edad fue de 63 años con un 57 % de mujeres. El tiempo medio de diálisis fue de 225 min con un Kt/V por OCM de 1, 44. De los signos clínicos, la mayor incidencia fue presencia de pseudoaneurismas, en un 42, 8 %. La media de recirculación fue 10, 46 ± 2, 68 % y la presión venosa dinámica inicial 94, 51 ± 19, 58 mmHg. Se registraron en total 21 eventos: 14 fistulografías+ angioplastia, 4 trombosis con reparación quirúrgica, 2 fistulografías sin necesidad de angioplastia y una trombosis no recuperada. Cuando se compararon las mediciones de recirculación y presión venosa dinámica inicial, con la aparición de eventos, se encontró relación significativa con la presión venosa dinámica inicial (p Introduction: Vascular access problems {{represent the}} highest cause of morbility and mortality in haemodialysis patients. In turn, stenosis is {{the main cause of}} dysfunctions of the prosthetic vascular access, and when this problem is not detected in time, it may lead to thrombosis. There are a number of procedures for the detection of vascular access dysfunction, ranging from physical examination, pressure and flow measurements, and non-invasive and invasive imaging tests. Initial Dynamic Venous Pressure is a simple tool for monitoring vascular access. Aims: The aim of the study is to correlate initial dynamic venous pressure and recirculation as vascular access monitoring methods in haemodialysis patients. Material and methods: A prospective assessment of 21 patients with prostheses was carried out over 1 year. Clinical signs and objective measurement parameters were recorded such as recirculation by thermodilution, initial dynamic venous pressure with a blood flow of 200 ml/min, haemostasis time and KT/V by OCM, which were compared with the findings of the imaging tests. Measurements were taken monthly, with a total of 244. Results: PTFE prostheses represented 16. 6 % of the vascular accesses in our unit during the period of study. The average age was 63 years, and 57 % of the patients studied were women. The mean dialysis time was 225 minutes with a Kt/V by OCM of 1. 44. Of the clinical signs, the one with the highest incidence was the presence of pseudoaneurysms, in 42. 8 %. The mean recirculation was 10. 46 ± 2. 68 % and initial dynamic venous pressure 94. 51 ± 19. 58 mmHg. A total of 21 events were recorded: 14 <b>fistulographies</b> + angioplasty, 4 thromboses with surgical repair, 2 <b>fistulographies</b> that did not require angioplasty and one thrombosis that was not recovered. When the recirculation and initial dynamic venous pressure measurements are compared with the appearance of adverse events, a significant relationship was found with initial dynamic venous pressure (p< 0. 05) : the higher it is, the greater the likelihood of events. We did not find a correlation between initial dynamic venous pressure and recirculation. Conclusions: In light of these results, we can conclude that initial dynamic venous pressure is a useful and easy to measure parameter related to the appearance of adverse events in PTFE prostheses. However, we did not find any relationship between initial dynamic venous pressure and vascular access recirculation...|$|R

METHODS: 84 consecutive fistulographies were performed for clinical suspicion of PF and retrospectively analysed. We radiologically defined two types of PF by means of <b>fistulography,</b> PF 1 {{in the case of}} primary filling with contrast agent of the jejunal loop or stomach and PF 2 in the case of secondary filling of the jejunal loop or stomach through a fistulous tract or a fluid collection. RESULTS: In 35 / 84 (41. 7 %) of the fistulograms, a PF 1 was demonstrated owing to an instantaneous opacification of the intestinal lumen or the stomach, without evidence of a fistulous tract or fluid collection. In 49 / 84 (58. 3 %) fistulograms, a PF 2 was demonstrated by the depiction of a fluid collection and/or a fistulous tract and a communication with the intestinal loop or the stomach anastomised with the pancreas. The mean healing time of a PF after PD was 2. 7 days for PF 1, and 9. 8 days for PF 2.

Parks’ fistulae classification demonstrates the biggest practical significance and divides fistulae into: intersphincteric, trans-sphincteric, suprasphincteric and extrasphincteric. Etiology of perianal fistulae is most commonly linked with the in-flammation of anal glands in Crohn’s disease, tuberculosis, pelvic infections, pelvic malignant tumours, and with the radiotherapy. Diagnostic method options are: RTG <b>fistulography,</b> CT <b>fistulography</b> and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of pelvic organs. Patients and methods. We have included 24 patients with perirectal fistulae in the prospective study. X-rays fistu-lography, CT <b>fistulography,</b> and then MRI of the pelvic cavity have been performed on all patients. Accuracy of each procedure in regards to the patients and the etiologic cause have been statistically determined.

40|$|Fistula-in-ano, or perianal fistula, is a {{challenging}} clinical condition for both diagnosis and treatment. Imaging modalities such as <b>fistulography,</b> anal endosonography, perineal sonography, {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (MRI), and computed tomography (CT) are available for its evaluation. MRI is considered as the modality of choice for an accurate delineation of the tract {{in relation to the}} sphincter complex and for the detection of associated complications. However, its availability and affordability is always an issue. Moreover, the requirement to obtain multiple sequences to depict the fistula in detail is cumbersome and confusing for the clinicians to interpret. The inability to show the fistula in relation to normal anatomical structures in a single image is also a limitation. Multi detector computed tomography <b>fistulography</b> (MDCTF) is an underutilized technique for defining perianal fistulas. Acquisition of iso-volumetric data sets with instillation of contrast intothe fistula delineates the tract and its components. Post-processing with thin sections allows for a generation of good quality images for presentation in various planes (multi-planar reconstructions) and formats (volume rendered technique, maximum intensity projection). MDCTF demonstrates the type of fistula, its extent, whether it is simple or complex, and shows the site of internal opening and associated complications; all in easy to understand images that can be used by the surgeons. Its capability to represent the entire pathology in relation to normal anatomical structures in few images is a definite advantage. MDCTF can be utilized when MRI is contraindicated or not feasible.

RESULTS: The intraoperative blood flow measurement greater than 120 ml/min in autologous fistula and less than 320 ml/min in arteriovenous graft was described as predictive factors for early failure. CONCLUSIONS: The blood flow measurement should be performed after the confection of the anastomosis. When blood flow is limited, <b>fistulography</b> is an essential step to assess patency...|$|E
40|$|The {{clinical}} {{course of}} sigmoidovesical and ileovesical fistula due to rupture of colonic diverticulitis is reported. The patient, a 41 -year-old male, {{who had been}} suffering from intestinocutaneous fistula for 16 months since drainage of abdominal abscess had chief complaints of cloudy urine and fecaluria. Cystoscopic examination revealed bladder papilloma land edema at the apex area of the bladder. Abscess and fistula were identified with transurethral ultrasonotomography and <b>fistulography,</b> respectively. Primary resection was performed after intravesical instillation of mitomycin-C and postoperative course was uneventful. Histological findings of the specimen revealed disappearance of bladder papilloma for the instillation therapy. Statistical analysis was made on 73 cases of sigmoidovesical fistula due to colonic diverticulitis reported in Japan including my own case...|$|E
40|$|A 56 - year-old man {{underwent}} a laparoscopic low anterior resection for rectal cancer (cT 3 bN 0 M 0). Postoperatively, he was fairly well and started oral intake on postoperative day (POD) 9. On POD 14, {{he had an}} uncomfortable feeling during urination and noticed pneumaturia, and urinalysis revealed hematopyuria. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) showed air collection in the left seminal vesicle and bladder, and colonoscopy demonstrated a fistula at the anastomotic site. Abdominal CT following the <b>fistulography</b> under colonoscopy demonstrated fistulous communication between the rectum and left seminal vesicle. Under the diagnosis of seminal vesicle-rectal fistula, the patient was successfully treated by filling the fistula with fibrin glue by colonoscopy. No obvious recurrence of the fistula has been observed for 6 months after the treatment...|$|E
