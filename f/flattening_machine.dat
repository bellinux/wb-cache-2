40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{the design and}} testing of tension control prototype systems to minimise these tension variations, which includes a fluidic muscle powered take up arm, a fluidic muscle wire accumulator and felt pad. First the model and their limitations for existing tensioning systems are identified. Then, they are theoretically analysed in simulations. The simulation {{results show that the}} acceleration and deceleration of the wire due to the changing wire path length causes a cyclic tension fluctuation. An online tension sensor verified the predictions of the model. The key for a successful design is to remove tension variations. We propose to add a wire <b>flattening</b> <b>machine</b> which includes an accumulator and tensioning device, and replace the conventional pneumatic cylinder powering the accumulator with a fluidic muscle. The simulation shows that the new prototype system almost doubles the winding speed with a tolerable tension fluctuation...|$|E
40|$|Investigations were on {{physical}} and mechanical {{properties of the}} bio- composite boards made from compressed oil palm fronds. The bio-composites board consits of young, intermediate and mature fronds, which were divided to three portions respectively. They were the bottom, middle and top portions for each maturity age group of the fronds. The fronds were sliced longitudinal into the thin sheet after their skins were removed. The sheets were later compressed by running them through a <b>flattening</b> <b>machine.</b> Two types of resins namely phenol formaldehyde and urea formaldehyde were used to bind the fronds's sheets together forming parallel bio-composite board from compressed oil palm fronds. The physical and mechanical properties of this bio-composite board were later studied. the physical and mechanical properties of this bio-composite board were later studied. The physical properties such as density and basic density were investigated. The mechanical properties such as static bending for modulus of elasticity and mudulus of rupture {{as well as the}} compression strengh for modulus of rupture were studied in order to investigate their strength properties in structural application. All tests were made in accordance to the International Organizational for Standardization (ISO) standards. The results indicate that the bio-composite boards with higher basic density possess higher bending and compression strenght compares to those with lower values. The bio-composite board from bottom portion oil palm frond shows to have the higher basic density follows by the middle and top portion for each maturity age group, meanwhile matured maturity group possess the higher basic density for each portion compare to the intermediate and young maturity group. Thus, the bending and compression strength show to have higher results for bio-composite board from bottom portion and decrease for the middle and top portion for each maturity age group, while the matured maturity group posses the higher strenght result for each portion follows then by intermediate and young maturity group...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} {{a technique to}} model check UML specifications by translating UML models to the model checker SPIN. Our models consist of active UML classes, whose behavior is defined by hierarchical state machines. The intended application is to find errors in protocols communicating using asynchronous message passing. Compared to previous efforts using a similar approach, our novel points are the following. First, we consider a subset of UML that in our opinion is expressive enough for protocol models but allows a simpler translation to SPIN than existing work. Preliminary analysis of simple industrial models support our conclusions on the expressivity of our UML subset. Second, we present a powerful action language that is still amenable to automatic analysis. The action language is used to specify the effects of transitions, which may include dynamic creation of new objects. Finally, we discuss an even simpler SPIN translation for <b>flattened</b> UML state <b>machines</b> and {{compare it to the}} translation that supports hierarchy. ...|$|R
40|$|UML-B is a UML-like {{graphical}} {{front end}} for Event-B that provides support for object- oriented modelling concepts. In particular, UML-B supports class diagrams and state machines, concepts {{that are not}} explicitly supported in plain Event-B. In Event-B, refinement is used to relate system models at different abstraction levels. The same abstraction-refinement concepts can also be applied in UML-B. This work introduces the notions of refined classes, refined state machines and extended classtypes to en- able refinement of classes and state machines in UML-B. This work makes explicit the structures of class and state machine refinement in UML-B. This work also introduces seven refinement techniques which are, adding new attributes and associations, adding new classes, elaborating state, elaborating transition, moving a class event (or a state machine transition), adding new attributes and associations, and adding new classtypes. In Event-B, decomposition is used to decompose a system into components. The same decomposition concepts can be applied in UML-B. This work introduces the techniques of <b>flattening</b> state <b>machines</b> and state grouping to facilitate a decomposition of a UML-B machine. This work also introduces the notion of composed machine which composes the component machines. The composed machine refines a machine which is being decomposed. The composed machine is used to ensure {{the composition of the}} component machines is a valid refinement. Together with the composed UML-B machine, the notions of included machine, composed event and constituent event are introduced. The UML-B drawing tool and Event-B translator are extended to support the new refinement and decomposition concepts. A case study of an auto teller machine (ATM) is presented to validate the extensions of UML-B with regards to the above notions. The ATM case study also demonstrates the above techniques introduced in refinement and decomposition. In addition, this work provides guidelines for performing refinement and decomposition in UML-B and presents a number of generic invariants that may be used when refining a middleware. The middleware is a component via which a requesting component such as an ATM and a responding component such as bank interact in a distributed system.
