40|$|The JERICO European {{research}} infrastructure (RI) is integrating diverse platform types such as fixed buoys, piles, moorings, drifters, FerryBoxes, gliders, HF radars, coastal cable observatories {{and the associated}} technologies dedicated to observe and monitor <b>coastal</b> <b>European</b> seas. The first steps of setting up, coordination and harmonization were done during 2011 to 2015 {{in the framework of}} FP 7 -JERICO (www. jerico-fp 7. eu), a 4 -year long infrastructure project co-funded by the European Commission with 27 partners from 17 European countries under the coordination of IFREMER. Next steps are driven in the H 2020 -JERICO-NEXT European project until 2019, involving 33 partners. The main objective of the JERICO consortium is to establish a Pan European approach for a <b>European</b> <b>coastal</b> marine observatory <b>network.</b> This is a dynamic activity going beyond a project’s lifetime including continuous efforts towards harmonization in terms of design, operation, and maintenance, the evolution and extension of the current systems as well as the delivery of data and products to the users. Our scope here is to present the work done towards the harmonization of operation and maintenance methods, in FP 7 -JERICO and the next steps in JERICO-NEXT. As a starting point of harmonization assessment, the priority was given to the most pressing issues like calibration and biofouling, while {{it is the first time}} that a Best Practice report on all phases of the system from first installation to operation and maintenance is attempted adopting a platform based approach...|$|R

40|$|Amongst {{the various}} {{functions}} of <b>European</b> <b>coastal</b> ecosystems the information functions {{are by far}} the most important. Information is provided mainly through the various aspects of biodiversity: taxon diversity, genetic diversity, community (P) diversity, phylogentic distinctiveness, rarity and endemism. Coastal ecosystems are relatively rich in coastal ecotypes of species with a broader amplitude and in endemic species. Phylogenetically distinctive taxa occur in saline waters, and some on beaches and in foredunes. These particular features of coastal ecosystems are related to the long geological history of European, especially eastern Mediterranean, coasts. Information functions are threatened through the use of <b>European</b> <b>coastal</b> ecosystems for other purposes, notably urbanization and recreational development...|$|R

This dissertation suggests and describes a methodology for the re-planning of the <b>coastal</b> <b>network</b> of Greece and aims to develop a new model of the <b>coastal</b> shipping <b>network</b> in Greece.

40|$|The {{definition}} of coastal waters {{in relation to}} EU environmental legislation was clearly stated in the Water Framework Directive. In compliance with this Directive, most of the EU Member States delineated their coastal waters¿ boundaries. However, these delineations are not as complete and homogeneous as could be expected. A clear identification of <b>European</b> <b>coastal</b> waters boundaries is crucial {{for the implementation of}} the Water Framework Directive and the Marine Strategy Framework Directive, which depend on an accurate ecological/environmental assessment of those waters. Hence, {{there is a need for}} a comprehensive and unambiguous delimitation of <b>European</b> <b>coastal</b> waters. This report aims at bridging this gap providing a pan-European mapping of coastal waters, which cover 553, 817 km 2 in 30 seaside countries, 340, 524 km 2 of which pertain to the 22 EU Member States connected to the sea. For this purpose, a comprehensive geographical analysis of the national baselines and transitional waters distribution was performed. A pan-European baseline of 63, 340 km was delineated as a basis for the <b>European</b> <b>coastal</b> waters delimitation. The <b>European</b> <b>coastal</b> waters identified in this work show significant differences with the available national declarations (almost 12 % of the compared area), the latter defining an additional area of 29, 337 km 2 with respect to the former. The largest deviations seem to be due to misinterpretations of the {{definition of}} coastal waters in the Water Framework Directive, although a number of one-sided national modifications to that definition are also observed. This work provides the geographical basis for a full consultation process and discussion about this subject. Our recommendations include setting a clear geographical limit between the Water Framework Directive and the Marine Strategy Framework Directive jurisdiction, revise the possible exemptions in the definition of coastal waters, and discuss their consequences in the assessment of ecological/environmental status.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the risk}} of extreme coastal events in major <b>European</b> <b>coastal</b> cities using a stochastic diffusion model that is calibrated with the worst case emission scenario from the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change (IPCC), i. e. the representative concentration pathway (RCP) 8. 5. The model incorporates uncertainty in the sea-level rise distribution. Expected mean annual losses are calculated for 19 <b>European</b> <b>coastal</b> cities, together with two risk measures: the Value at Risk (VaR) and the Expected Shortfall (ES). Both measures are well-known in financial economics and enable us to calculate {{the impact of the}} worst SLR paths under uncertainty. The results presented here can serve as valuable inputs for cities in deciding how much risk they are willing to accept, and consequently how much adaptation they need depending on the risk aversion of their decision-makers...|$|R

The current extent of <b>European</b> <b>coastal</b> blue carbon has an accounting stock value of about US$ 180 million.

40|$|Abstract Sand {{mobility}} in <b>European</b> <b>coastal</b> dunes was traditional {{viewed as}} a problem to be solved and literally ‘fixed’. These attitudes were challenged {{by the emergence of}} the dynamic approach to coastal dune management, a concept proposed at the 1987 European Dune Symposium in Leiden, The Netherlands. This meeting led to the launch of the European Union for Dune Conservation and Coastal Management (EUDC) and was followed by a series of international dune conferences across Europe. In 1993 the interests of the EUDC were broadened to consider a wider agenda based on Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM). This meant that there was no longer a dedicated European resource for sand dunes. In the UK the Sand Dune and Shingle Network was formed in 2006, and its work is described here in addition {{to the development of a}} European Dune Network. The current challenges and responses for <b>European</b> <b>coastal</b> dune conservation are outlined, and examples provided. The paper concludes with a call for a strong European Dune Network to support the urgent actions required for the conservation of dunes as dynamic landscapes...|$|R
