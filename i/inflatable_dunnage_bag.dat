50|$|In earlier {{days before}} the {{introduction}} of containerization, men who loaded and unloaded ships had to tie down cargoes with rope. A type of stopper knot is called the stevedore knot. The methods of securely tying up parcels of goods is called stevedore lashing or stevedore knotting. While loading a general cargo vessel, they use dunnage, which are pieces of wood (or nowadays sometimes strong <b>inflatable</b> <b>dunnage</b> <b>bags)</b> set down to keep the cargo out of any water that might be lying in the hold or are placed as shims between cargo crates for load securing.|$|R
50|$|<b>Dunnage</b> <b>bags</b> are air-filled pouches {{that can}} be used to stabilize, secure and protect cargo during transportation. <b>Dunnage</b> <b>bags</b> are placed in the voids between the cargo items. <b>Dunnage</b> <b>bags</b> can be used in all modes of transportation; road, railway, ocean or air.|$|R
50|$|The {{quantity}} of inflation air may be varied {{in accordance with}} the particular properties and requirements of the package contents. <b>Dunnage</b> <b>bags</b> are commercially available in various sizes and designs, ranging from spheres, standard cushions to corner and edge cushioning and tubular cushioning. <b>Dunnage</b> <b>bags</b> can be used to stabilize, secure, and protect cargo during all sorts of transportation. <b>Dunnage</b> <b>bags</b> are placed in the void between the cargo. <b>Dunnage</b> <b>bags</b> can be used in all modes of transportation. Besides being usable in all modes of transportation, almost every type of cargo can be secured with the use of <b>dunnage</b> <b>bags,</b> including break bulk and palletized cargo, coils, barrels, cases, and crates.|$|R
50|$|Whereas {{strapping}} and lashing {{is often}} used to secure odd-shaped cargo such as machinery, structures, and vehicles. <b>Dunnage</b> <b>bags</b> are mostly used for homogeneous shaped cargo such as food & beverage products, electronics and appliances and roll paper. Often, strapping/lashing and <b>dunnage</b> <b>bags</b> are used in combination to secure chemical products. <b>Dunnage</b> <b>Bags</b> are not approved for rail transportation of hazardous materials in the United States.|$|R
50|$|Paper <b>dunnage</b> <b>bags</b> {{are made}} out of two {{component}}s, an inner component that consists of a polyethylene inner bag, the outer component is a paper bag. The outer bag is made of the highest quality, light weight kraft paper of high tensile strength. Paper <b>dunnage</b> <b>bags</b> come in different strengths and varieties and {{can be made in}} any special size. The inner component provides optimum pressure and the outer component provides optimum strength. For use in the chemical industry paper <b>dunnage</b> <b>bags</b> can be polycoated. A polycoat will make the <b>dunnage</b> <b>bag</b> resistant to specific chemicals.|$|R
50|$|<b>Dunnage</b> <b>bags,</b> {{also known}} as air bags, were {{introduced}} some 40 {{years ago as a}} convenient, fast and cost effective alternative to secure and stabilize cargo in ISO sea containers, closed rail cars, trucks and (ocean-going) vessels. The purpose of <b>dunnage</b> <b>bags</b> is often misunderstood when they are considered as a void filler only to prevent lateral movement of cargo. When properly applied however, <b>dunnage</b> <b>bags</b> form a 3-dimensional bulkhead of the cargo itself preventing both lateral and longitudinal movement.|$|R

5000|$|Introduced around 1970, <b>dunnage</b> <b>bags</b> provide {{convenient}} and cost-effective cargo stabilization in ISO sea containers, closed railcars, trucks, and oceangoing vessels. As improperly secured cargo is a safety hazard, <b>dunnage</b> <b>bags</b> improve road safety.

50|$|In the 21st century, Amazon began air-filling <b>dunnage</b> <b>bags</b> on site {{during packing}} {{in order to}} {{minimize}} environmental impact, shipping weight, and cost of packing materials.|$|R
50|$|<b>Dunnage</b> <b>bags</b> {{are very}} {{safe to use}} for both the {{shipping}} and receiving end of transportation, and are waterproof. They inflate rapidly with compressed air, and are easy to install; compressed air is often available through an outlet in the truck's compressed air system.|$|R
50|$|Some bags can be reused, and are {{ultimately}} recyclable. To reuse the <b>dunnage</b> <b>bag</b> {{it needs to}} be undamaged and equipped with a screw-on quick fill valve. For single use, the bag is equipped with a quick-fill one-way safety valve. Inflatable air cushions are available both as disposable items and as recyclable products.|$|R
50|$|Break {{bulk cargo}} is {{typically}} material stacked on pallets and lifted {{into and out}} of the hold of a vessel by cranes on the dock or aboard the ship itself. The volume of break bulk cargo has declined dramatically worldwide as containerization has grown. One way to secure break bulk and freight in intermodal containers is by using <b>Dunnage</b> <b>Bags.</b>|$|R
50|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} ways and materials available to stabilize and secure cargo in various modes of transport. Conventional load securing methods and materials such as steel strapping and plastic/wood blocking & bracing {{have been used for}} decades and are still widely used. Present load securing methods offer several other options including polyester strapping and lashing, synthetic webbings and <b>dunnage</b> <b>bags,</b> also known as air bags or inflatable bags.|$|R
50|$|Important {{in the use}} of <b>dunnage</b> <b>bags</b> is {{that the}} size of the bag is {{determined}} by the void. If this does not match, the bags will not do their work properly with potential large damage to cargo and people. For air cushions it is important to avoid damage as a result of wear and tear. Air cushions should never be used as fillers against doors or any non-rigid surfaces or partitions.|$|R
