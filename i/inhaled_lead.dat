During the past decade there has been international agreement on the definitions for the inhalable, thoracic, and respirable fractions and instruments have been developed to collect samples according to these conventions.

40|$|Fortunately {{there has}} been a steady fall in the {{incidence}} of lead toxicity in recent decades. Lead toxicity is a notifiable condition, with laboratories undertaking the notification process. Nonoccupational toxicity is notifiable at a lower level (0. 73 µmol/L) than for occupational cases (2. 41 µmol/L), the latter being stipulated by the National code of practice for the control and safe use of inorganic lead at work. 1 These levels are the equivalent of 15 µg/dL and 50 µg/dL set by the American National Institute for Occupational Health and Safety. Annual occupational exposure notif ications in Queensland have fallen from 32 in the year 2000 to 12 in 2005, with nonoccupational notifications falling from 54 to 29. Nonoccupational notifications included childhood notifications, which fell from 11 to one in the same period. 2 There has been {{an increase in the number}} of specimens tested by laboratories (both from occupational and nonoccupational sources) but a fall in the incidence of lead toxicity, despite well publicised environmental concerns in a few Australian industrial cities. Recent nonoccupational exposures in Queensland occurred most commonly by exposure to old lead (contained in paint) during demolitions, renovations and maintenance. Occupational exposures occurred most commonly in battery manufacturing, foundry work, and radiator manufacture and repair. 2 Toxicology In order to suffer the ill effects of a toxicant, one must be exposed to a sufficient dose, which must in turn be absorbed into the blood. Ingestion and inhalation are both important. Approximately 10 – 15 % of the ingested quantity is absorbed, although this can be higher in the presence of iron deficiency, pregnancy, and fasting. 3, 4 For lead to be absorbed by inhalation, the dose must be delivered in a form that is respirable, ie. can be delivered to the alveolus. The particulate size of fume can be as small as 0. 1 micron, and almost all of this is absorbed. Lead dust is also respirable as particles may be as small as 0. 5 – 1 microns, well within the range capable of alveolar deposition. 5 It is estimated that approximately 35 – 40 % of <b>inhaled</b> <b>lead</b> dust is actually absorbed into the blood. 3 Upon absorption, lead binds to erythrocytes, and over a period of weeks is distributed predominantly to bone, liver, kidney, marrow and brain.

40|$|AbstractThe {{beneficial}} effects of inhaled corticosteroids {{in the treatment}} of asthma are well established. A potent topical anti-inflammatory action is assumed to underlie the therapeutic effect, given that these agents alter the number and function of a range of inflammatory cells and markers in airway biopsies. This activity profile is shown by all inhaled corticosteroids, in a variety of patient types and study designs. Thus, treatment with <b>inhaled</b> corticosteroids <b>leads</b> to consistent reductions in the number and activation of mast cells and eosinophils in biopsy specimens. Other relevant findings include reductions in T-lymphocytes, which contribute to chronic inflammation via the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines (some of which are responsible for eosinophil accumulation and activation). Inhaled corticosteroids may therefore act by down-regulating immunoreactivity, so reducing activation of T lymphocytes and (consequently) eosinophils. There is considerable interest in whether corticosteroids can inhibit or reverse some structural changes in the airways, including basement membrane thickening, collagen deposition and increased airway vascularity; {{it has been suggested that}} these changes may contribute towards airway hyperresponsiveness and irreversible airway obstruction. In summary, inhaled corticosteroids have a broad spectrum of anti-inflammatory activity in asthma patients, but the relationship between changes in clinical and immunopathological parameters, particularly in the long-term, requires further study...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Addition of {{the long}} acting beta 2 agonist {{salmeterol}} to <b>inhaled</b> corticosteroids <b>leads</b> to better symptomatic asthma control than increasing the dose of inhaled corticosteroids. However, {{little is known about}} the long term effects of adding salmeterol on the asthmatic inflammatory process, control of which is considered important for the long term outcome of asthma. METHODS: After a 4 week fluticasone run-in period, 54 patients with allergic asthma were randomised to receive twice daily treatment with fluticasone 250 microg with or without salmeterol 50 microg for 1 year in a double blind, parallel group design (total daily dose of fluticasone 500 microg in both treatment groups). Primary outcomes were sputum eosinophil numbers and eosinophil cationic protein concentrations. Secondary outcomes were neutrophil associated sputum parameters and a respiratory membrane permeability marker. The effects on allergen induced changes were determined before and at the end of the treatment period. RESULTS: Adding salmeterol to fluticasone resulted in improved peak expiratory flow, symptom scores, rescue medication usage, and bronchial hyperresponsiveness (p 0. 05). However, adding salmeterol significantly reduced sputum ratios of alpha 2 -macroglobulin and albumin during the treatment period (p = 0. 001). CONCLUSIONS: The addition of salmeterol to fluticasone produces no sustained effect on allergen induced cellular bronchial inflammation but leads to a significant improvement in size selectivity of plasma protein permeation across the respiratory membrane. This may contribute to the improved clinical outcome seen in patients with allergic asthma when a long acting beta 2 agonist is combined with inhaled corticosteroid...|$|R

Further, complement activation during allergen challenge in sensitized animals {{is necessary for the}} development of AHR and airway inflammation. To define the complement pathway involved, we studied mice deficient in complement factor 4 (C 4 −/−), a critical component of the classical pathway, or factor B (fB−/−), an essential protein in the alternative complement pathway. WT, C 4 −/−, and fB−/− mice were sensitized to ovalbumin and subsequently exposed to nebulized ovalbumin (1 % in saline) on 3 consecutive days. After allergen sensitization and challenge, fB−/− mice demonstrated significantly lower airway responsiveness to methacholine and less airway inflammation. In contrast, C 4 −/− mice showed no reduction in AHR and airway inflammation compared with WT mice. Tissue inflammation, goblet cell hyperplasia, and IL- 4, IL- 5, and IL- 13 levels in BAL fluid were significantly reduced in fB−/− mice compared with C 4 −/− and WT mice. The development of AHR and airway inflammation in sensitized fB−/− mice could be restored after intranasal administration of purified factor B before the airway challenge. In addition, administration of a neutralizing anti-factor B mAb to sensitized mice before airway challenge reduced the development of AHR and airway inflammation. These results demonstrate that in sensitized hosts complement activation through the alternative pathway after allergen exposure is critical to the development of AHR and airway inflammation...|$|R

This meta-analysis aimed to assess the cardiovascular safety of inhaled LABAs in COPD. A meta-analysis of randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled trials for LABA treatment of COPD with at least 3 months of follow-up was performed. The fixed-effects model was used to evaluate the effects of LABAs on fatal cardiovascular adverse events. Adverse events were collected for each trial, and the relative risk (RR) and 95 % confidence intervals (CI) for LABA/placebo were estimated. There were 24 trials included in this meta-analysis. Compared with placebo, inhaled LABAs significantly decreased fatal cardiovascular adverse events in COPD patients (RR 0. 65, 95 % CI 0. 50 to 0. 86, P = 0. 002). In sensitivity analysis, there was still no increased risk of fatal cardiovascular events (RR 0. 68, 95 %CI 0. 46 to 1. 01, P = 0. 06) after excluding the trial with the largest weight.

40|$|Introduction and {{objective}} Firefighters {{are considered a}} healthy and fit group of individuals, well-prepared for taking action in disaster situations. While working, they suffer from exposure to certain toxic agents, especially combustion products generated when a fire takes place. Among them, the most frequent and the most toxic are: carbon monoxide, hydrogen cyanide, ammonia, and those resulting from PVC combustion – hydrochloride, phosgene and chloride. Additionally, fire-extinguisher powder can be <b>inhaled</b> and <b>lead</b> to certain lesion in the airways. The aim of study was to ascertain the influence of toxic agents present {{at the scene of}} fire on the lung tissue of firefighters, and also to study this on an animal model. Material and Methods The study group consisted of firefighters who had a minimum of 10 years service. After completing a questionnaire, their clinical status was ascertained based on a general examination, laboratory tests and lung function tests. Results Questionnaire analysis showed a high percentage of pathological symptoms in the studied group. The incidence of the symptoms correlated with the duration of occupational exposure to toxic agents. Among other results, obstruction of flow in medium airways in about 30 % of the studied individuals represented the most important finding. Experimental tests were next performed on male Wistar rats, aged 3 months. They were insufflated with the solution of powdered fire-extinguisher, after which morphology specimens of lung tissue were studied. Evidence for disseminated fibrosis was obtained, which supported the previous clinical findings in the firefighters. Conclusions The above shows correlation between occupational exposure and respiratory system involvement in firefighters. This justifies covering the group of firefighters with special medical care focused on prophilaxis, early detection and therapy of pulmonary diseases...|$|R

This trauma can contribute {{to a loss of}} reproductive success and harm to developing embryos. An oil spill occurring in winter, when the puffins are far out at sea, may affect them less than inshore birds as the crude oil slicks soon get broken up and dispersed by the churning of the waves. When oiled birds get washed up on beaches around Atlantic coasts, only about 1.5% of the dead auks are puffins, but many others may have died far from land and sunk. After the oil tanker [...] shipwreck and oil spill in 1967, few dead puffins were recovered, but the number of puffins breeding in France the following year was reduced to 16% of its previous level.|$|R
40|$|At least 10 % of the {{population}} of the western world is suffering from respiratory syndromes with characteristics of asthma or COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease). In addition to inheritable components, it is well known that exaggerated immune responses against <b>inhaled</b> compounds can <b>lead</b> to respiratory allergy. More than 50 % of the number of asthma cases are induced by type I hypersensitivity immune reactions (i. e. allergic or extrinsic asthma). The asthma cases that are not induced by these type I hypersensitivity reactions can be non-immunologically mediated (i. e. intrinsic asthma) or induced by other types of hypersensitivity reactions such as type III or IV hypersensitivity. Predictive tests with respect to the capacity of chemicals to induce one or more types of respiratory hypersensitivity are necessary in order to estimate the risk for exposure to these chemicals. The majority of the predictive tests are restricted to tests which are aimed to test the capacity of chemicals to induce skin-type hypersensitivity reactions (type IV). The applicability of these tests for predictive testing regarding the capacity of chemicals to induce respiratory hypersensitivity is restricted. In the present report a step-by-step approach is proposed for the identification and characterization of small molecular weight compounds as potential allergens, pertaining to the skin and the respiratory tract...|$|R
40|$|At least 10 % of the {{population}} of the western world is suffering from respiratory syndroms with characteristics of asthma or COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). The prevalence and severity of asthma like diseases is increasing and even in some countries mortality has risen. In the United Kingdom asthma is responsible for about 2000 deaths per year. In addition to inheritable components, it is known that exaggerated immune responses against <b>inhaled</b> compounds can <b>lead</b> to pulmonary diseases (respiratory allergy). More than half of the number of asthma cases are induced by type I hypersensitivity immune reactions (i. e. extrinsic asthma). The asthma cases that are not induced by these type I hypersensitivity reactions can be non-immunological mediated (i. e. intrinsic asthma) or induced by other subtypes of hypersensitivity reac- tions such as type III or IV hypersensitivity. Predictive tests with respect to the capacity of chemicals to induce one or more types of respiratory hypersensitivity are necessary. Unfortunately there are almost no tests available in order to test the sensitizing capacity of compounds leading to respiratory allergy. The majority of the predictive tests are restricted to the capacity of chemicals to induce skin-type hypersensitivity reactions. The applicability of these tests for predictive testing regarding the capacity of compounds/chemicals to induce respiratory hypersensitivity is restricted...|$|R
