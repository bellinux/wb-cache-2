Global Navigation <b>Satellite</b> <b>System</b> (GNSS) {{interoperability}} {{could make}} use of the information from different navigation <b>satellite</b> <b>systems.</b> To estimate GNSS interoperability at the system level, an innovative assessment algorithm was presented in this paper. First of all, three assessment parameters, namely, Dilution Of Precision (DOP), Navigation <b>Satellite</b> <b>System</b> Precision (NSSP) and Navigation <b>Satellite</b> <b>System</b> Integrity (NSSI) were introduced. Secondly, availability and continuity of the assessment parameters were adopted to quantify the GNSS performance. A further step was then taken to focus on the assessment rule for GNSS performance by employing the weighted sum of availability and continuity. Simulation results demonstrate that GNSS performance could be improved significantly by interoperability. ...|$|R

40|$|A {{method to}} control the librational motion of a {{tethered}} <b>satellite</b> <b>system</b> in an elliptic orbit is presented. To simplify the analysis, gravity is treated as the only external force affecting the tethered <b>satellite</b> <b>system,</b> only in-plane motion is considered, and the flexibility and mass of tethers are neglected. The tethered <b>satellite</b> <b>system</b> treated in this paper consists of two subsatellites and a mother satellite, such as the space shuttle, connected together in series via massless tethers. This type of tethered <b>satellite</b> <b>system</b> has very important applications in Earth observation, space observation, communications, and satellite constellations. The librational motion of the tethered <b>satellite</b> <b>system</b> in an elliptic orbit {{is known to be}} chaotic and can be stabilized to undergo periodic motion by the delayed feedback control method. The periodic motion of a tethered satellite in a circular orbit is employed as the reference trajectory for tracking by the actual tethered satellite, which is in an elliptic orbit. The decoupling and model tracking control methods, based on differential geometric control theory are combined with the delayed feedback control method in a new approach to controlling the librational motion of the tethered <b>satellite</b> <b>system</b> in elliptic orbits. The results of numerical simulations show that the proposed control scheme has good performance in controlling the librational motion of a tethered <b>satellite</b> <b>system</b> in an elliptic orbit...|$|R
