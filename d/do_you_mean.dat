Glenn is the name I was brought up with, Divine is the name I've been using for the past 23 years. I guess it's always Glenn and it's always Divine. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> the character Divine or the person Divine? You see, it gets very complicated. There's the Divine you're talking to now and there's the character Divine, which is just something I do to make a living. She doesn't really exist at all." [...] At one point he had the name [...] "Divine" [...] officially recognized, as it appeared on his passport, and {{in keeping with his}} personal use of the name, his close friends nicknamed him [...] "Divy".|$|E
500|$|Orville {{followed}} his brother's success by demonstrating another nearly identical Flyer to the United States Army at Fort Myer, Virginia, starting on September 3, 1908. On September 9, {{he made the}} first hour-long flight, lasting 62 minutes and 15 seconds. On September 17, Army lieutenant Thomas Selfridge rode along as his passenger, serving as an official observer. A few minutes into the flight {{at an altitude of}} about , a propeller split and shattered, sending the Flyer out of control. Selfridge suffered a fractured skull in the crash and died that evening in the nearby Army hospital, becoming the first airplane crash fatality. Orville was badly injured, suffering a broken left leg and four broken ribs. Twelve years later, after he suffered increasingly severe pains, X-rays revealed the accident had also caused three hip bone fractures and a dislocated hip. The brothers' sister Katharine, a school teacher, rushed from Dayton to Virginia and stayed by Orville's side for the seven weeks of his hospitalization. She helped negotiate a one-year extension of the Army contract. A friend visiting Orville in the hospital asked, [...] "Has it got your nerve?" [...] "Nerve?" [...] repeated Orville, slightly puzzled. [...] "Oh, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> will I be afraid to fly again? The only thing I'm afraid of is that I can't get well soon enough to finish those tests next year." ...|$|E
500|$|On 21 March 1816, {{at the age}} {{of seven}} years, Mendelssohn was baptised with his brother and sisters in a home {{ceremony}} by Johann Jakob Stegemann, minister of the Evangelical congregation of Berlin's Jerusalem Church and New Church. Although Mendelssohn was a conforming Christian {{as a member of the}} Reformed Church, he was both conscious and proud of his Jewish ancestry and notably of his connection with his grandfather Moses Mendelssohn. He was the prime mover in proposing to the publisher Heinrich Brockhaus a complete edition of Moses's works, which continued with the support of his uncle Joseph Mendelssohn. Mendelssohn was notably reluctant, either in his letters or conversation, to comment on his innermost beliefs; his friend Devrient wrote that [...] " [...] deep convictions were never uttered in intercourse with the world; only in rare and intimate moments did they ever appear, and then only in the slightest and most humorous allusions". Thus for example in a letter to his sister Rebecka, Mendelssohn rebukes her complaint about an unpleasant relative: [...] "What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> by saying you are not hostile to Jews? I hope this was a joke It is really sweet of you that you do not despise your family, isn't it?" [...] Some modern scholars have devoted considerable energy to demonstrate either that Mendelssohn was deeply sympathetic to his ancestors' Jewish beliefs, or that he was hostile to this and sincere in his Christian beliefs.|$|E

What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> I can't order $100 of lobster every day?' I mean, like, bad. But it was too late. It was already public. The album was going out. So I did what I always did: try {{to make the best of}} a situation and start covering up. Put on a good face. And honestly, I'm glad the thing didn't sell, because if it had sold well it would have been really tough. I would look like I was going to walk away from something that I'd just built." ...|$|E

[...] Or, to just apply Occam's Razor, to go, [...] "Is it more likely that souls do circus tricks, or more likely that they're talking to dead people? And if the latter, by what process? What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> talking to dead people? Aren't their voice boxes rotten? So without a voice box, how do they talk, and by what means?"

2500|$|The second specimen, {{found in}} 1952 by Comoran {{fisherman}} Ahamadi Abdallah, {{was described as}} a different species, first as Malania hunti and later as Malania anjounae, after Daniel François Malan, the South African Prime Minister who had dispatched an SAAF Dakota at the behest of Professor Smith to fetch the specimen. It was later discovered that the lack of a first dorsal fin, at first thought to be significant, was caused by an injury early in the specimen's life. Ironically, Malan was a staunch creationist; when he was first shown the primitive creature, he exclaimed, with a twinkle, [...] "My, it is ugly. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> to say we once looked like that?" [...] The specimen retrieved by Smith is on display at the SAIAB in Grahamstown, South Africa where he worked.|$|E
2500|$|His stories also {{included}} several book-length fairy tales, such as The White Deer (1945), The 13 Clocks (1950) and The Wonderful O (1957). The latter {{was one of}} several of Thurber's works illustrated by Marc Simont. Thurber's prose for The New Yorker and other venues included numerous humorous essays. A favorite subject, especially {{toward the end of his}} life, was the English language. Pieces on this subject included [...] "The Spreading 'You Know'," [...] which decried the overuse of that pair of words in conversation, [...] "The New Vocabularianism", [...] "What <b>Do</b> <b>You</b> <b>Mean</b> It Was Brillig?", and many others.

2500|$|New {{cast members}} were told before being hired {{that they would}} be sworn to secrecy about the plot. According to {{producer}} Richard Stokes, some of the new cast were surprised at the requirement. [...] "What was really interesting was the new cast members saying 'what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> we won't know'. Some lead actors want to know what happens at the end so they can pitch their performance to it. In this they have to trust Chris and have to trust the directors." [...] Cast members swore not to reveal any details of series two, and were required to sign legally binding non-disclosure agreements. (The Daily Mail called them [...] "the most rigorous confidentiality agreements in the industry.") Daily call sheets used pseudonyms for cast members and characters. Scripts were individually watermarked to prevent them from being photocopied, used pseudonyms for characters, and were locked away by security guards when not in use by the actors. Each actor's or crew member's script had the individual's name watermarked across the page as well, so that leaks could {{be traced back to the}} person responsible.|$|E
2500|$|Many of George's predicaments {{were based}} on David's past real-life experiences. In [...] "The Revenge", for example, when George quits his job in a fury only to realize {{he has made a}} mistake, he goes back the next day as if nothing happened; this mirrors David's actions while working as a writer for Saturday Night Live, when he quit and then {{returned}} to his job in the same manner. [...] As the show progressed, Alexander discovered that the character was based on David. As Alexander explains in an interview for the Seinfeld DVD, during an early conversation with David, Alexander questioned a script, saying, [...] "This could never happen to anyone, and even if it did, no human being would react like this." [...] David replied, [...] "What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean?</b> This happened to me once, and this is exactly how I reacted." [...] After that, Alexander changed his performance from an imitation of Woody Allen to what he has called a [...] "shameless imitation of Larry David." ...|$|E

I want haliotis. I want soapstone, agate, redstone, and jet. Because I will live there alone while you are gone each day, I want animals to keep me company.
