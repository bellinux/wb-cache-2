5|$|A {{hypothesis}} for {{the high}} metal content in SMR dwarf stars is that material enriched in heavy elements <b>fell</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> atmosphere from a protoplanetary disk. This would pollute the star's external layers, resulting in a higher than normal metallicity. The lack of a deep convection zone {{would mean that the}} outer layers would retain higher abundance ratios of these heavy elements.|$|E
5|$|Before {{leading the}} final sortie by the castle garrison, Zrinski ordered a fuse be lit to the powder magazine. After cutting {{down the last}} of the {{defenders}} the besiegers poured into the fortress. The Ottoman Army entered the remains of Szigetvár and <b>fell</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> booby trap; thousands perished in the blast when the castle's magazine exploded.|$|E

5|$|In December 2016, a homebrew remake was {{released}} that, {{for the most}} part, kept the original game the same. However, the mechanic of E.T. falling into the pit was amended so that a keypress was required before the player <b>fell</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> pit. The holes were also visually removed and were discovered with an indicator at the bottom left of the screen.|$|E
5|$|In May 1944, a Junkers JU188 {{was shot}} down by a Mosquito nearby and its debris was {{scattered}} across the nearby village of West Worldham, including the church wall.

5|$|In {{advance of}} the system, {{officials}} issued storm warnings for coastal areas of Alabama and western Florida, and residents in low-lying areas were advised to seek higher ground. Damage associated with the cyclone was generally minor, and only one life was lost when a boy <b>fell</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> swollen waters of a river and drowned.|$|E
5|$|On September 22, 1915, {{there was}} an {{explosion}} during construction of the 23rd Street subway station that caused the tunnel to collapse. Seven people were killed after a blast of dynamite in the subway tunnel destroyed the plank roadway over Seventh Avenue. As a result, a crowded trolley car, and a brewery truck <b>fell</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> excavation, accounting for most of the injuries.|$|E
5|$|The 10th Century Saint Conrad of Constance is {{sometimes}} {{represented as a}} bishop holding a chalice with a spider. According to this story, while he was celebrating Easter Mass, a spider <b>fell</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> chalice. Ignoring the commonly-held belief {{of the time that}} all or most spiders were poisonous; as a token of faith, Conrad nevertheless drank the wine with the spider in it.|$|E

5|$|When the {{two sons}} of {{the chief of the}} gods {{fell in love with a}} {{beautiful}} maiden named Loowit, she could not choose between them.

5|$|After the {{surrender}} of General Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia on April 9, 1865, {{the primary reason for}} manned defenses protecting Washington ceased to exist. Initial recommendations by Col. Alexander, chief engineer of the Washington defenses, were to divide the defenses into three classes: those that should be kept active (first-class), those that should be mothballed and kept in a reserve state (second-class), and those that should be abandoned entirely (third-class). Fort Corcoran <b>fell</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> third-class category.|$|E

Initial recommendations by Colonel Barton S. Alexander, then-chief engineer of the Washington defenses, were to divide the defenses into three classes: those that should be kept active (first-class), those that should be mothballed and kept in a reserve state (second-class), and those that should be abandoned entirely (third-class). Due to its rear-area nature and the fact that inspections were no longer needed to protect the Long Bridge against sabotage, Fort Jackson <b>fell</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> third-class category.|$|E

5|$|Alternative {{theories}} were advanced. Some {{surmised that}} the money had been found at a distant location by someone (or possibly even a wild animal), carried to the river bank, and reburied there. The sheriff of Cowlitz County proposed that Cooper accidentally dropped a few bundles on the airstair, which then blew off the aircraft and <b>fell</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Columbia River. One local newspaper editor theorized that Cooper, knowing he could never spend the money, dumped it in the river, or buried portions of it at Tina Bar (and possibly elsewhere) himself. No hypothesis offered to date satisfactorily explains all of the existing evidence.|$|E
5|$|Antigonus entered Sparta triumphantly, {{its first}} foreign conqueror. Nevertheless, he treated the {{population}} generously and humanely. He ordered that the reforms of Cleomenes be revoked, and restored the ephors, {{although he did}} not force Sparta to join the League. However, Antigonus' failure to restore the Spartan Kings suggests to historian Graham Shipley that this restoration of laws was a sham. Within three days, he left Sparta and returned to Macedon to deal with a Dardani invasion, leaving a garrison in Acrocorinth and Orchomenos. With Cleomenes' defeat, Sparta's power collapsed and it <b>fell</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> hands of successive tyrants.|$|E
5|$|Construction was {{not without}} incident. In May 1860, a GNR train {{overshot}} the platform at King's Cross and <b>fell</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> workings. Later in 1860, a boiler explosion on an engine pulling contractor's wagons killed the driver and his assistant. In May 1861, the excavation collapsed at Euston causing considerable damage to the neighbouring buildings. The final accident occurred in June 1862 when the Fleet sewer burst following a heavy rainstorm and flooded the excavations. The Met and the Metropolitan Board of Works managed to stem and divert {{the water and the}} construction was delayed by only a few months.|$|E
