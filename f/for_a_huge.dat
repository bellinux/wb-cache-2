At Oxford, representatives of Brasenose and All Souls opened a fund for an {{appropriate}} memorial; this idea {{was taken over}} by Williams-Wynn, who wanted a national rather than an Oxford-based monument. From the large sum collected, Chantrey was paid £3,000 <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> marble sculpture that was placed in St Paul's Cathedral, London.

25|$|A {{distinctive}} {{feature of the}} period, compared to earlier European painting, was {{the small amount of}} religious painting. Dutch Calvinism forbade religious painting in churches, and though biblical subjects were acceptable in private homes, relatively few were produced.

The development of many of these types of painting was decisively influenced by 17th-century Dutch artists.|$|E

Stephen finally renounced Tyrol to the Habsburgs with the Peace of Schärding <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> financial compensation {{after the death of}} Margarete Maultasch in 1369.

For example, Medicare promoted the adaptation of prospective payments based on DRG’s, which prevents unscrupulous providers from setting their own exorbitant prices. Meanwhile, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act has given Medicare the mandate to promote cost-containment throughout the health care system, for example, by promoting the creation of accountable care organizations or by replacing fee-for-service payments with bundled payments.|$|E
