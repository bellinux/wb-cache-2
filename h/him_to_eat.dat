5|$|Shepard died {{unexpectedly}} {{during the}} afternoon of March 24, 1893 at his Manhattan residence. Two doctors were attempting to remove a bladder stone from him. They instructed <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> lightly, only well before the operation. They gave him the anesthetic ether at 12:45p.m. For a few minutes Shepard {{did not seem to}} react, though soon afterward his color started changing and his respiration and pulse dimmed, so administration of ether was stopped, however not enough ether was given to continue with the operation. His condition started to worsen again; the doctors suspected food or vomit was blocking his windpipe or bronchial tubes. The doctors then administered oxygen, which helped temporarily; however, at 4:00p.m. his pulse became steadily more feeble, he fell unconscious, and died at 4:10p.m. His cause of death was edema and congestion of the lungs, after the administration of ether, but due to an unknown cause.|$|E

25|$|However, {{the rule}} change about two victors is {{suddenly}} revoked. Peeta urges Katniss to shoot him, but she convinces <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> nightlock in a suicide pact, as a protest of the Games. Just before they do, they are hastily named co-winners of the 74th Hunger Games. Afterward, Haymitch warns Katniss {{that she has}} made many enemies by her acts of defiance. Snow has Crane locked {{in a room with}} nightlock. Katniss encourages Peeta to forget what happened between them, devastating him, and the two arrive home to their district.|$|E

[...] "'Faith! when he's in health, I'd back <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>ate</b> a cow, barrin' the horns and teel." [...] I sent a {{decanter}} at the rogue's head, {{by way of}} answer to his impertinence.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is {{hospitality}} {{turned upside}} down," [...] I answered feebly. [...] "In our country we entertain a stranger, and give <b>him</b> food <b>to</b> <b>eat.</b> Here ye eat him, and are entertained." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He's hungry; give <b>him</b> {{something}} <b>to</b> <b>eat,</b> {{and then}} he'll {{see that we}} don't want to hurt him," [...] suggested Sally, starting a contribution with her last bit of bread and butter.|$|R
25|$|During this ceremony, {{the king}} {{also had to}} participate, {{although}} he was a Christian, {{and he had to}} drink of the mead that was offered and consecrated for Odin, Njord and Freyja. The peasants also wanted <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> of the meat, but he only gaped over the handle of the cauldron and held a linen cloth between his mouth and the meat. The peasants were not at all satisfied with a king who would not participate fully in the blót. The King had however, been seriously humiliated and later he converted to the old faith. The tradition says that he was buried in the old ways.|$|E
25|$|The Meigs family {{returned}} to Washington, D.C., on November 3, 1852, after Montgomery Meigs {{was assigned to}} design and finish the Washington Aqueduct (a public works project which brought large amounts of fresh water to Washington, D.C., for the first time). His parents finally enrolled him in school (public or private is not clear). But his discipline problems continued. After one particularly violent temper tantrum, his father tied John's wrists together, tied him to a chest of drawers, and left him there all afternoon without allowing <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> lunch. When Meigs learned that his son had untied himself, he spanked him with the rope.|$|E
25|$|Jackson {{returns with}} his entire gang. Using {{a machine gun}} {{contained}} in his coffin, Django guns down much of the Klan, allowing Jackson {{and a handful of}} men to escape. While helping Nathaniel bury the corpses, Django visits the grave of Mercedes Zaro, his former lover who was killed by Jackson. Hugo and his revolutionaries arrive and capture Jackson's spy, Brother Jonathan. As punishment, Hugo cuts off Jonathan's ear, forces <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> it, and shoots him in the back. Later, Django proposes to Hugo, who he had once saved in prison, that they steal Jackson’s gold, currently lodged in the Mexican Army’s Fort Charriba.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then I {{will make}} him a new blood-trail, of his own blood, if I can, and give <b>him</b> dirt <b>to</b> <b>eat.</b> Thou wilt stay here, Kaa, till I come again with my dholes?" ...|$|R
60|$|Martin stood quietly {{listening}} to all this, not quite understanding the old man's kind intentions. Then old Jacob, promising <b>to</b> give <b>him</b> something <b>to</b> <b>eat,</b> pulled <b>him</b> up on <b>to</b> his horse, and started home at a gallop.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{said the}} old lady, [...] "you will have to bear up under {{it as well as}} you can, and I hope they will give <b>him</b> {{something}} <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> wherever he is going." ...|$|R
25|$|Jezebel, enraged that Elijah {{had ordered}} the deaths of her priests, threatens to kill Elijah. Later Elijah would prophesy about Jezebel's death, because of her sin. Elijah flees to Beersheba in Judah, {{continues}} alone into the wilderness, and finally sits down under a shrub, praying for death. He falls asleep under the tree; the angel of the Lord touches him and tells him {{to wake up and}} eat. When he awakens he finds bread and a jar of water. He eats, drinks, and goes back to sleep. The angel comes a second time and tells <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> and drink because he has a long journey ahead of him.|$|E
25|$|Later, Charlie Brown {{comes across}} Lucy {{teaching}} Linus about nature {{the way she}} views it with such as bugs pulling the grass to make it grow or snow growing {{out of the ground}} in winter. Charlie Brown tries to correct her, but she retaliates with a false explanation, and Charlie Brown bangs his head against a tree in frustration ("Little Known Facts"). That evening, Snoopy complains that he hasn't been fed yet, and begins to overcomplicate and dramaticize the matter until Charlie Brown shows up with his dinner. Snoopy bursts into song about his craving for supper until Charlie Brown firmly tells <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> his meal ("Suppertime").|$|E
25|$|In 1861 Bummer rescued another dog from a {{fight with}} a larger canine opponent. The rescued dog was badly injured, with a deep wound on his leg, and was not {{expected}} to live. Bummer coaxed <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat,</b> brought back scraps from his scavenging missions and huddled next to him to keep him warm during the night. The injured dog quickly recovered and within days was following Bummer {{as he made his}} begging rounds in the streets. His remarkable recovery earned him the name Lazarus, and he proved to be an even more prodigious ratter than Bummer. As a team {{they turned out to be}} exceptional, once finishing off 85 rats in 20 minutes.|$|E
60|$|Harry thought, of course, {{that this}} {{seemed like a}} {{reflection}} on his motives in proposing that Harvey could ask Aunt Judy <b>to</b> give <b>him</b> something <b>to</b> <b>eat,</b> and so, of course, {{there had to be}} explanations.|$|R
50|$|During {{a forest}} fire, he saves a drunken moonshiner, Salosensaari, whose factory has burned down. He finds refuge in a cabin, but is chased off by its owners, who {{threaten}} <b>to</b> shoot <b>him,</b> wanting <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> his hare.|$|R

25|$|In 1996, it {{is alleged}} Higgins threw a tea trolley at a tabloid {{journalist}} whilst {{sleeping in a}} caravan belonging to Holly Haise. After his cancer diagnosis in 1998 he moved back to Belfast and lived in sheltered housing. In April 2010 Higgins's friends announced that they {{had set up a}} campaign to help raise the £20,000 he needed for teeth implants, to enable <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> properly again and put on weight. Higgins had lost his teeth after intensive radiotherapy used to treat his throat cancer. It was reported that since losing them he had been living on liquid food, and had become increasingly depressed, even contemplating suicide. He was too ill to have the implants fitted. Despite his illness, Higgins continued to smoke cigarettes and drink heavily until the end of his life.|$|E
25|$|A {{demolition}} team {{is about}} to bring down a building when one worker is drawn to an area not marked on the blueprints. Inside the area they find a path to the building's foundation, and in the darkness, a boy (Spencer List). The boy is taken to a children's hospital and the Fringe division is contacted. The construction workers examined where the boy was found and determined it had been sealed off for seventy years and could not determine how the boy got inside. The boy does not speak, and Walter Bishop (John Noble) explains some of his medical conditions {{as a result of}} living underground for several years. Olivia Dunham (Anna Torv) seems to be the only person that the boy reacts to, and she helps to coax him to help in his treatment. At one point, she encourages <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> by sharing candy with him, but he only places the yellow pieces {{in the form of an}} arrow for her.|$|E
500|$|Pike's party {{reached the}} Kitkehahki village on September 25, 1806, shortly after Melgares's departure.

The Pawnees {{presented}} eight horses to the Osages accompanying Pike, {{and members of the}} two tribes smoked pipes together. Pike's party established a camp fortified with rifle pits on a hill on the north bank of the Republican opposite the village.|$|E

500|$|... "I Never Met the Dead Man" [...] is {{the second}} episode of the first season of the {{animated}} comedy series Family Guy. It originally aired on Fox in the United States on April 11, 1999. The episode follows Peter Griffin as he teaches his daughter Meg how to drive. Due to his horrible advice they crash into a satellite dish, knocking out the city's cable. Peter begins to suffer from television withdrawal but finds new life in outdoor activities, driving his family to exhaustion. Meanwhile, Stewie plots to destroy the world's supply of broccoli with a weather control device so Lois cannot force <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> the vegetable.|$|E
500|$|The rapid {{advancement}} {{and personal}} arrogance of the Munshi would inevitably {{have led to}} his unpopularity, {{but the fact of}} his race made all emotions run hotter against him. [...] Racialism was a scourge of the age; it went hand in hand with belief in the appropriateness of Britain's global dominion. [...] For a dark-skinned Indian to be put very nearly on a level with the queen's white servants was all but intolerable, for <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> at the same table as them, to share in their daily lives was viewed as an outrage. [...] Yet the queen was determined to impose harmony on her household. [...] Race hatred was intolerable to her, and the [...] "dear good Munshi" [...] deserving of nothing but respect.|$|E
500|$|Ryan White {{attended}} Western Middle School for {{eighth grade}} {{for the entire}} 1986–87 school year, but was deeply unhappy and had few friends. The school required <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> with disposable utensils, use separate bathrooms, and waived his requirement to enroll in a gym class. Threats continued. When a bullet was fired through the White's living room window (no one was home at the time), the family decided to leave Kokomo. After finishing the school year, {{his family moved to}} Cicero, Indiana, where the school district required him to enroll at Hamilton Heights High School, located in Arcadia, Indiana. On August 31, 1987, a [...] "very nervous" [...] Ryan White was greeted by school principal Tony Cook, school system superintendent Bob G. Carnal, and a handful of students who had been educated about AIDS and were unafraid to shake Ryan's hand.|$|E
50|$|The plot of {{the poem}} {{revolves}} around a fable within a fable. A calf has been caught by a wolf on Easter. The wolf has a dream, warning <b>him</b> not <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> the calf. Meanwhile, the other animals come to the wolf's cave.|$|R

6000|$|... "He {{has been}} knocked about a bit, sir; {{and he is}} done up with travelling. The poor fellow can hardly crawl, and was half starved; so I set <b>him</b> <b>to</b> work <b>eating,</b> and came off to fetch you." ...|$|R
500|$|Annoyed that Peter {{spends more}} time {{watching}} television than with his own family, Lois suggests he teach Meg how to drive. Peter reluctantly agrees, and unwittingly gives Meg a series of bad driving tips, including instructing her to [...] "rev" [...] her engine twice at stop lights and challenge other drivers to a race, which causes her to ultimately fail her driving test. As Peter drives them home from the DMV he notices that a show he wanted to watch is on television in a nearby house. Distracted by the show, he crashes the car into the main cable television transmitter, knocking out reception for the whole entire town of Quahog. Panicking, Peter makes a promise to Meg so that if she takes the blame for knocking down the cable transmitter, she would get a new convertible when she finally gets her licence. Once they arrive home with the transmitter still attached to the car, Lois becomes furious with Peter for placing the blame on his own daughter. Meg, of course, is blamed, {{and is about to}} admit the truth, but then decides to keep quiet, reflecting with an inner voice, a reference to The Wonder Years, at school. This shows an incredible lack of good judgment and morals by Peter. Meanwhile, Stewie, (seeing the opportunity of the dish attached to car), steals the satellite dish in a plan to create a weather control device capable of destroying the world's supply of broccoli, since Lois had forced <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> the vegetable earlier that day.|$|E
