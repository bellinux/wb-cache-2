50|$|The Vištinės goose (Lithuanian: Vištinės žąsys) is a {{breed of}} {{domestic}} goose originating in Lithuania. The Vištinės Goose {{was created by}} crossing ancient local geese with the East Prussian Goose, <b>Embden</b> <b>Goose,</b> and partly Pomeranian Goose {{in the first half}} of the 20th century. There were two local selected goose breeds: Vištinės Goose and Flock Goose. Flock Geese have died out as a breed.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Genomic DNA {{from four}} strains of geese was {{analyzed}} {{for the presence}} of endogenous viral elements using a probe that can detect over 20 Rous-associated endogenous viral genes (ev genes) in chickens, as well as a probe and protocol that detects endogenous avian viruses (EAV). Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA did not reveal any ev genes in DNA of 15 geese from Chinese, Synthetic, or two <b>Embden</b> <b>goose</b> strains. Even under low stringency conditions, using a probe that covered most of the polymerase (pol) gene of the Rous-associated virus (RAV) and that revealed EAV elements in a chicken without ev genes, no viral loci were evident in goose DNA.

40|$|Two {{structurally}} distinct {{forms of}} eggwhite lysozyme (EC 3. 2. 1. 17) are known. The egg white of some species contains {{both of these}} forms, while the egg white of other species appears to contain only {{one or the other}} of them. We have immunological and electrophoretic evidence that the chicken, which has only one lysozyme type in its egg white, contains both types in its polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Experiments on <b>Embden</b> <b>goose</b> bone marrow showed that this tissue also contains both lysozymes, even though the egg white of this species contains only one of them. Our studies suggest that many avian species have the genetic loci that code for both forms of lysozyme, but that a species-specific regulatory mechanism controls whether one or the other or both of them are expressed during egg white production. The fact that two distinct lysozymes are present in chicken leukocytes may be of significance to the antibacterial mechanism of these cells, especially in light of the fact that they lack myeloperoxidase, an important leukocyte enzyme in mammals...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Mature, nonlaying, female <b>Embden</b> <b>geese</b> {{were fed}} either a 12 % protein corn-soybean meal diet or alfalfa haylage for 5 months. Excreta {{collections}} over a 48 -hr fasting period {{indicated that there}} was no difference in quantitative excretion due to previous diet and that 12 hr were sufficient to empty the digestive tract of a goose. However, cecal droppings were noted up to 48 hr of collection. In the second experiment, the true metabolizable energy (TME) value of corn was found to increase significantly between 6 and 12 -hr periods of fasting prior to force-feeding 50 g of corn. Fasting up to 24 hr resulted in nonsignificant increases in the TME of corn. The TME of corn for geese previously fasted 24 hr was 4. 169 kcal/g dry matter. Total metabolic fecal and endogenous urinary energy excretion of mature female geese, ranging from 3817 to 4857 g, was not correlated with body weight. The coefficient of variation was high. The mean metabolic fecal and endogenous urinary energy excretion of female <b>Embden</b> <b>geese</b> for a 24 -hr period following an initial 24 -hr fast was found to be 8. 476 ±. 822 kcal of energy per goose.

40|$|ABSTRACT Mature, nonlaying, female <b>Embden</b> <b>geese</b> {{were used}} to {{determine}} the effect of level of intake on the apparent and true metabolizable energy (AME and TME) of corn, wheat, and oats. The AME values showed a significant quadratic increase as level of intake increased; however, TME values showed a decreasing trend as input levels increased from 10 to 70 g. In the second experiment, corn, wheat, oats, and rice hulls were determined to have similar and rapid passage rates through the goose. The gross energy and proximate composition of 18 feedstuffs along with corresponding AME and TME values for geese are reported.

40|$|ABSTRACT Four {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} examine the riboflavin, pantothenic acid, nicotinic acid, and choline requirements of young <b>Embden</b> <b>geese</b> fed purified diets. Goslings fed diets deficient in either riboflavin, pantothenic acid, nicotinic acid, or choline grew poorly. Feeding a panthothenic acid-deficient diet resulted in 100 % mortality. Goslings fed diets containing 530 mg/kg of choline or less developed perosis. Under the conditions of these experiments it was found that: 1) goslings require no more than 3. 84 mg/kg of riboflavin and 31. 2 mg/kg of nicotinic acid in the diet for rapid growth and normal development, 2) the pantothenic acid requirement of goslings {{is no more than}} 12. 6 mg/kg of diet, and 3) a dietary choline level of 1530 mg/kg is adequate for both the prevention of perosis and rapid growth of goslings. The levels of vitamins found to support normal growth and development of goslings appear to be similar to requirements of other species that have been examined...|$|R
