25|$|The oil sales losses Iran is {{experiencing}} {{are likely to}} produce over $50 billion in hard currency revenue losses in a one-year period at current oil prices. The IMF estimated Iran’s hard currency reserves to be $106 billion as {{of the end of}} 2011, and some economists say that figure may have fallen to about $80 billion as of November 2012. Analysts at one outside group, the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, believe Iran’s hard currency reserves might be exhausted entirely by July 2014 at current rates of depletion.

Here we describe a simple ecological model with emigration/depletion that shows behavior in contrast to this. This model displays unusual dynamics of extinction and survival, where populations growing beyond a critical rate can persist within a band of high <b>depletion</b> <b>rates,</b> whereas extinction occurs for lower <b>depletion</b> <b>rates.</b> Though prior to extinction at lower <b>depletion</b> <b>rates</b> the population exhibits chaotic dynamics with large amplitudes of variation and very low minima, at higher <b>depletion</b> <b>rates</b> the population persists at chaos but with reduced variation and increased minima.

5000|$|Elymus lanceolatus is {{a species}} of grass known by the common names thickspike wheatgrass and streamside wheatgrass. It is native to North America, where it is {{widespread}} and abundant in much of Canada and the western and central United States. There are two subspecies, ssp. lanceolatus occurring throughout the species' range and ssp. psammophilus occurring in the Great Lakes region. [...] Elymus lanceolatus is a perennial, low growing, rhizomatous grass that actively grows in summer and spring. This plant is native to semiarid regions of the United States. Elymus lanceolatus is polymorphic, capable of growing in high altitude regions of the Rocky Mountains or at sea level near the Great Lakes in the United States. The bloom period for E. lanceolatus is mid-spring, and it is available commercially. Elymus lanceolatus is characterized by its yellow flowers, green or grey leaves, and brown seeds. According to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), it has a moderate harvest regrowth rate. Wheatgrass is unique in that in can adapt to fine, medium, and coarsely textured soils in the environment. However, it is shade intolerant, has a medium fertility requirement, and has a medium salinity tolerance. Studies suggest that amounts of soil needed for wheatgrass harvest can be approximated by understanding the plant’s water <b>depletion</b> <b>rate</b> and rainfall amount in the region, which consequently helps reduce drainage.|$|E

It requires strong computation capability and is thus usually deployed on powerful machine. However, as mobile platforms become more advanced and more popular, the potential has been studied to combine POMDP and mobile {{in order to provide}} a broader range of services. And yet a question comes with this trend: how should we implement POMDP on mobile platform so that we can take advantages of mobile features {{while at the same time}} avoid being restricted by mobile limitations, such as short battery life, weak CPU, unstable networking connection, and other limited resources. In response to the above question, we first point out that the cases vary by problem nature, accuracy requirements and mobile device models. Rather than pure mathematical analysis, our approach is to run experiments on a mobile device and concentrate on a more specific question: which POMDP implementation is the ``best'' for a particular problem on a particular kind of device. Second, we propose and justify a POMDP implementation criterion mainly based on battery consumption that quantifies ``goodness'' of POMDP implementations in terms of mobile battery <b>depletion</b> <b>rate.</b> Then, we present a mobile battery consumption model that translates CPU and WIFI usage into part of the battery <b>depletion</b> <b>rate</b> in order to greatly accelerate the experiment process. With our mobile battery consumption model, we combine a set of simple benchmark experiments with CPU and WIFI usage data from each POMDP implementation candidate to generate estimated battery depletion rates, as opposed to conducting hours of real battery experiments for each implementation individually. The final result is a ranking of POMDP implementations based on their estimated battery depletion rates. It serves as a guidance for on POMDP implementation selection for mobile developers. We develop a mobile software toolkit to automate the above process. Given basic POMDP problem specifications, a set of POMDP implementation candidates and a simple press on the ``start'' button, the toolkit automatically performs benchmark experiments on the target device on which it is installed, and records CPU and WIFI statistics for each POMDP implementation candidate. It then feeds the data to its embedded mobile battery consumption model and produces an estimated battery <b>depletion</b> <b>rate</b> for each candidate. Finally, the toolkit visualizes the ranking of POMDP implementations for mobile developers' reference. Evaluation is assessed through comparsion between the ranking from estimated battery <b>depletion</b> <b>rate</b> and that from real experimental battery <b>depletion</b> <b>rate.</b> We observe the same ranking out of both, which is also our expectation.

40|$|The {{bioavailability}} of naphthalene {{present as}} a component of a complex nonaqueous phase liquid (NAPL) comprised by nine aromatic compounds was investigated. Specifically, the effects of naphthalene mass transfer from the NAPL to the aqueous phase on rates of its microbial degradation were examined. The investigations were conducted using a pure culture, ATCC 17484, and a mixed culture of naphthalene-degrading bacteria, the former having been implicated previously in the direct uptake of sorbed naphthalene. The studies were conducted in mass-transfer-limited, segregated-phase reactors (SPRs) in which both the NAPL and aqueous phases were internally well-mixed. A 30 -day active biodegradation period was preceded and followed by a 5 – 7 -day period devoid of bioactivity, during which time the rates and extents of mass transfer of components from the NAPL to the aqueous phase were quantified. The NAPL-phase naphthalene mass depletion profiles during biodegradation were compared to those predicted by assuming maximum mass depletion under mass-transfer-limited conditions using both pre- and post-biodegradation dissolution rate and equilibrium parameters. The observed mass <b>depletion</b> <b>rates</b> were high during the initial stages of biodegradation but decreased significantly in later stages. Throughout biodegradation, even in the initial rapid stage, mass <b>depletion</b> <b>rates</b> never exceeded maximum predicted rates based on pre-biodegradation mass transfer parameters.

40|$|A {{computational}} {{algorithm is}} developed and executed {{to calculate the}} <b>rate</b> of <b>depletion</b> of magnetospheric ions by an electrostatic tether at various altitudes. This computation relies upon past studies in the OML regime of charged tethers to determine the deflection angles incurred upon incoming ions at any given incident velocity. Calculated <b>depletion</b> <b>rates</b> are used to computationally estimate {{the time required to}} deplete a given range of the magnetosphere. by Christopher F. Zeineh. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|Annual {{nutrient}} (N, P, and K) balances for Republic of Korea (ROK), Vietnam, and China for {{the period}} 1961 - 1998 were established using a recently-developed nutrient audit model. A current annual surplus of all three nutrients was found for ROK, with potentially serious <b>depletion</b> <b>rates</b> for K (approximately 60 kg ha) obtained in both Vietnam and China. Year-to-year fluctuations in the annual nutrient balances were often large, indicating that `one-off' or `snapshot-in-time' data can give misleading information for nutrient depletion. To avoid this, time series data are required...|$|R

Upgrades are also acquired via experience points, which are earned through level advancement, {{which in turn is}} gradually achieved with each scored hit on enemies, depending on quality; as well as through hacking successfully, achieving mission objectives, and even being attacked. Experience points can be spent to upgrade various character stats, such as health (hit points), potency of psionic abilities, and energy <b>depletion</b> <b>rates.</b>|$|R
