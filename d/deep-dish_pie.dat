6000|$|That {{morning he}} had {{advocated}} lighter lunches {{and now he}} ordered nothing but English mutton chop, radishes, peas, <b>deep-dish</b> apple <b>pie,</b> a bit of cheese, and {{a pot of coffee}} with cream, adding, as he did invariably, [...] "And uh--Oh, and you might give me an order of French fried potatoes." [...] When the chop came he vigorously peppered it and salted it. He always peppered and salted his meat, and vigorously, before tasting it.|$|R
5000|$|The {{company was}} founded by Amanda Smith, a {{homemaker}} from Pottstown, Pennsylvania. Her son Robert P. started selling slices of Amanda's own <b>deep-dish,</b> fruit-filled <b>pies</b> door-to-door, and at the local YMCA lunch counter. Later he added a mobile route and a small store. The demand for her pies {{led to the formation}} of the company [...] "Mrs. Smith's Delicious Home Made Pies, Inc." [...] in 1925. [...] There were four Mrs. Smith's Pies bakeries serving the Northeast United States by 1930, including one in Logan, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.|$|R
50|$|An apple pie, {{regional}} variation apple tart, is a fruit pie, {{in which}} the principal filling ingredient is apple. It is, on occasion, served with whipped cream or ice cream on top, or alongside cheddar cheese. The pastry is generally used top-and-bottom, making it a double-crust pie; the upper crust may be a circular or a pastry lattice woven of crosswise strips. Depending on the baker's preference, {{the bottom of the}} double-crust may be baked first (before baking the whole pie) to prevent the bottom from getting soggy. Exceptions are <b>deep-dish</b> apple <b>pie,</b> with a top crust only, and open-face Tarte Tatin.|$|R
