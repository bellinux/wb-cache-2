25|$|As {{a part of}} a {{sedimentary}} or metamorphic rock, fossils {{undergo the}} same diagenetic processes as does the containing rock. A shell consisting of calcite can, for example, dissolve while a cement of silica then <b>fills</b> the <b>cavity.</b> In the same way, precipitating minerals can <b>fill</b> <b>cavities</b> formerly occupied by blood vessels, vascular tissue or other soft tissues. This preserves the form of the organism but changes the chemical composition, a process called permineralization. The most common minerals involved in permineralization are cements of carbonates (especially calcite), forms of amorphous silica (chalcedony, flint, chert) and pyrite. In the case of silica cements, the process is called lithification.|$|R
50|$|During human embryogenesis, the blastomeres of the morula {{continue}} mitosis and compaction to {{form the}} blastula - a hollow sphere of cells surrounding a fluid <b>filled</b> <b>cavity.</b> Approximately 5-6 days after fertilization the blastomeres of the blastula begin to undergo cell differentiation and its structure changes to become the blastocyst. In the uterus the zona pellucida of the blastocyst breaks down allowing it to implant into the uterine wall approximately 6 days after fertilization.

5000|$|As {{primary mesenchyme}} cells detach from the vegetal pole in the {{gastrula}} {{and enter the}} fluid <b>filled</b> <b>cavity</b> in the center (the blastocoel), the remaining cells at the vegetal pole flatten to form a vegetal plate. This buckles inwards towards the blastocoel in a process called invagination. The cells continue to be rearranged until the shallow dip formed by invagination transforms into a deeper, narrower pouch formed by the gastrula's endoderm. This narrowing and lengthening of the archenteron is driven by convergent extension. The open end of the archenteron is called the blastopore.|$|E

5000|$|A crackle tube {{is a type}} of plasma lamp that is {{used most}} {{commonly}} in museums, night clubs, movie sets, and other applications where its appearance may be appealing for entertainment. Such a device consists of a double walled glass tube with a hollow center. The cavity between the inner and outer glass tubes is filled with thousands of small phosphor coated glass beads. A 5-14 kV transformer sends a very low power, high frequency electrostatic discharge into the bead <b>filled</b> <b>cavity,</b> producing filaments of light that simulate lightning. Crackle tubes get their name not because of the sound they produce but rather because of the appearance of their internal behavior. The [...] "lightning" [...] (filaments or streamers) is forced around and in between the phosphor-coated glass beads, due to the beads' dielectric nature. In so doing, the phosphor is excited by the electrical energy and fluoresces producing visible light. Like plasma globes, crackle tubes respond to touch; the filaments appear to be [...] "attracted" [...] toward the point of contact and usually become more luminous (brighter) as the electricity is grounded. The tubes are also filled with a noble gas like neon, argon, or xenon which acts as the electron transfer medium of the cavity. The gas is typically kept at only slightly above atmospheric pressure.|$|E
