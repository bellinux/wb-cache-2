After 30 minutes, each team had to let one player let go of their weight. The Blue Team chose Vicky, and The Black Team chose Michelle.

50|$|At the Challenge, Dolvett, Jessie and Jen sit on diving boards {{high above}} a pool. Three members from each team must hold up 15% of their {{combined}} weight {{in order to}} keep their trainers from falling in. If the entire team lets go of the rope, the weight hits a target and the trainer falls into the water. The first team to drop their trainer loses him or her for the whole week. The second team to drop their trainer only gets to see them for the Last Chance Workout. The White Team sits out Sonya and Woody, which means Toma, Rondalee and JJ are competing and must <b>hold</b> up 126 <b>pounds.</b> The Red Team sits out Blake, meaning Rob, Scott and Jordan will <b>hold</b> up 145 <b>pounds.</b> The Blue Team only has three players, so Damien, Jackie and Lori are all competing, and have to <b>hold</b> up 127 <b>pounds.</b> Scott is the first to drop after 34 minutes, followed by Jordan. This leaves the Red Team's fate in Rob's hands. Unfortunately, Rob can't hold on anymore and Dolvett drops. Rob freaks out - he thinks without Dolvett this week, he'll be the one going home. JJ and Toma drop next, leaving just Rondalee for the White Team. But she can't hold on any longer and drops, which means the Blue Team wins! Not one of their members let go of their rope, and they finally take down the undefeated White Team.|$|R

The interior of the house had two fireplaces built of brick and coquina, plastered walls and paneled doors.

500|$|In {{order for}} a {{domestic}} or commercial customer to use ice, however, it was typically necessary {{to be able to}} store it for a period away from an ice house. As a result, Ice boxes and domestic refrigerators were a critical final stage in the storage process: without them, most households could not use and consume ice. By 1816, Tudor was selling Boston refrigerators called [...] "Little Ice Houses" [...] to households in Charleston; these were made of wood, lined with iron and designed to <b>hold</b> three <b>pounds</b> (1.4kg) of ice. Household refrigerators were manufactured in the 1840s on the east coast, most notably by Darius Eddy of Massachusetts and Winship of Boston; many of these were shipped west. The degree to which natural ice was adopted by local communities in the 19th century heavily depended on the availability and up-take of ice boxes.|$|R

A flux was added, and they were covered and heated by means of coke for about three hours. The molten steel was then poured into moulds and the crucibles reused. The local cutlery manufacturers refused to buy Huntsman's cast steel, as it was harder than the German steel they were accustomed to using. For a long time Huntsman exported his whole output to France.|$|R

5000|$|Due to {{the onslaught}} of {{publicity}} he received for his win over Hunt, McCorkle's next fight was the Co-Main Event of UFC 124. He fought 6'11" [...] Dutch fighter Stefan Struve in Montreal, Quebec. Struve and McCorkle traded trash talk on the Internet in {{the weeks leading up}} to the bout, which was a new experience for the usually reserved Struve. After McCorkle unleashed a continual barrage of taunts via his Twitter account, Struve issued a contest in which fans would Photoshop insulting pictures of McCorkle. The winner of the contest was promised the bloodstained fight gloves Struve was to use against McCorkle. The eventual winner of the contest submitted a picture of McCorkle as Justin Bieber, which led McCorkle to show up at the weigh-ins wearing a Bieber-style wig for photographers. When the fight began, McCorkle came out strong in the opening minutes, forcefully slamming Struve onto the ground and securing a kimura on him that nearly led to a tap out. After a struggle that sapped McCorkle of his energy, Struve was able to reverse the <b>hold</b> and <b>pound</b> him out, winning the fight by TKO.|$|R

Despite the name, Phonse’s fish store is never used to store fish; it is exclusively intended for the storage of fishing paraphernalia.
