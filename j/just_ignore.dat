Sometimes they were also prominent people in the local Jewish community and could use their influence to protect and influence their brethren.

The Washington Blade printed a guest editorial from a long-time HRC supporter who claimed that neither recipient had done enough to deserve the award and that The Human Rights Campaign was simply capitalizing on Bass's fame to sell tickets. The Human Rights Campaign stood by Bass and defended his award, responding to critics by saying, [...] "Bass is the biggest music star since Melissa Etheridge to come out, and maybe some people think HRC should <b>just</b> <b>ignore</b> these moments of cultural significance, but his declaration did initiate a positive, national conversation that continues today." ...|$|E

500|$|Many reviewers noted {{glitches}} {{while playing}} Skyrim, some game-breaking. Nick Cowen of The Guardian {{pointed out that}} the game's glitches were a trade-off for its ambitious scope, and that he had experienced glitches that forced him to reload earlier saves. Edge began their review by criticizing the lack of polish, while still acknowledging many areas in the game which made up for it. In addition, the quality of the main quest divided some reviewers. While Reiner praised the main quest as [...] "superbly penned" [...] and [...] "Bethesda's best effort to date", Butts and Francis criticized the fact that the story was delivered primarily through conversations and quest journals, rather than through the player's own interactions. While the dragon battles were well-received, some reviewers observed flaws in the AI for dragons. Onyett pointed out their [...] "predictable attack patterns", which Francis agreed with, claiming that [...] "fighting them never changes much: you can <b>just</b> <b>ignore</b> them until they land, then shoot them from a distance when they do". Reiner felt that, due to the repetitiveness of their attack patterns, the dragons were not challenging enough for low-level players. Edge pointed out a curve in difficulty for players who favored archery and magic, as dragons were difficult to attack while airborne.|$|E

2500|$|This {{conflict}} {{raised the}} important question {{of what happens when}} an Act of Congress conflicts with the Constitution. Marshall answered that Acts of Congress that conflict with the Constitution are not law and the Courts are bound instead to follow the Constitution, affirming the principle of judicial review. In support of this position Marshall looked {{to the nature of the}} written Constitution‚Äîthere would be no point of having a written Constitution if the courts could <b>just</b> <b>ignore</b> it. [...] "To what purpose are powers limited, and to what purpose is that limitation committed to writing, if these limits may, at any time, be passed by those intended to be restrained?" [...] Marshall also argued that the very nature of the judicial function requires courts to make this determination. Since it is a court's duty to decide cases, courts have to be able to decide what law applies to each case. Therefore, if two laws conflict with each other, a court must decide which law applies. Finally, Marshall pointed to the judge's oath requiring them to uphold the Constitution, and to the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution, which lists the [...] "Constitution" [...] before the [...] "laws of the United States". Part of the core of this reasoning is found in the following statements from the decision: ...|$|E
