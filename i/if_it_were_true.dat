5|$|Dawson relayed {{this story}} to Bulawayo, where Company {{authorities}} made enquiries. No {{man who had been}} attached to the column corroborated the account. The Company thought it unlikely that a Matabele inDuna would simply invent a story such as this, however, and angrily speculated that <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>were</b> <b>true,</b> then negotiations with Lobengula might have been opened and the war ended before Wilson crossed the river, and the entire episode of the Shangani Patrol avoided (though, as historian Robert Cary writes, this surmision ignores the fact that Forbes had been ordered to capture Lobengula, not end the war). Lawyers appointed by the Company launched a formal investigation early in 1894.|$|E
5|$|Putnam himself {{may be his}} own most {{formidable}} philosophical adversary. His frequent changes of mind have led him to attack his previous positions. However, many significant criticisms of his views have come from other philosophers and scientists. For example, multiple realizability has been criticized on the grounds that, <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>were</b> <b>true,</b> research and experimentation in the neurosciences would be impossible. According to William Bechtel and Jennifer Mundale, {{to be able to}} conduct such research in the neurosciences, universal consistencies must either exist or be assumed to exist in brain structures. It is the similarity (or homology) of brain structures that allows us to generalize across species. If multiple realizability were an empirical fact, results from experiments conducted on one species of animal (or one organism) would not be meaningful when generalized to explain the behavior of another species (or organism of the same species). Other criticisms of metaphysical realism have been proposed by Jaegwon Kim, David Lewis, Robert Richardson and Patricia Churchland.|$|E

25|$|According {{to federal}} prosecutors, Peter Milano once {{discussed}} in the 1980s {{with members of the}} Cleveland crime family a plot to have Dragna murdered for violating the oath of Omertà. During Milano’s arrest in 1987, prosecutors were going to call Cleveland crime family underboss-turned-government witness Angelo Lonardo to testify to this allegation. Milano’s lawyer strongly denied these allegations, stating that <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>were</b> <b>true,</b> Dragna would have received a formal warning from the FBI. Milano pleaded guilty to racketeering charges and a trial never took place.|$|E
25|$|A. L. Goodhart, Professor at Oxford, {{opposed the}} view that, because the judges were {{appointed}} by the victors, the Tribunal was not impartial {{and could not be}} regarded as a court in the true sense. He wrote: Attractive as this argument may sound in theory, it ignores the fact that it runs counter to the administration of law in every country. <b>If</b> <b>it</b> <b>were</b> <b>true</b> then no spy could be given a legal trial, because his case is always heard by judges representing the enemy country. Yet no one has ever argued that in such cases it was necessary to call on neutral judges. The prisoner has the right to demand that his judges shall be fair, but not that they shall be neutral. As Lord Writ has pointed out, the same principle is applicable to ordinary criminal law because 'a burglar cannot complain that he is being tried by a jury of honest citizens'.|$|E

500|$|An {{alternative}} {{explanation for}} the birthday-number effect {{that had to be}} tested is mere exposure. <b>If</b> <b>it</b> <b>were</b> <b>true</b> that the numbers in one's birthday are used disproportionately in one's daily life, then the preference for numbers in one's birthday could simply be a preference for what is most frequent. Zajonc found in his 1960s and 1980s lab studies that familiarity can strongly influence preference, and coined the term [...] "mere exposure effect". But Kitayama and Karasawa argued that even if people did see numbers from their own birthday more, this would still be negligible in comparison to the overall quantity of numbers they encounter in daily life. This is in line with the argument other researchers have used to rule out mere exposure as an {{explanation for the}} name-letter effect.|$|E
500|$|The writers {{also use}} the {{newsgroup}} to test how observant the fans are. In the seventh-season episode [...] "Treehouse of Horror VI", the writer of segment Homer3, David S. Cohen, deliberately inserted a false equation into the background of one scene. The equation that appears is 178212 + 184112 = 192212. Although a false statement, {{it appears to be}} true when evaluated on a typical calculator with 10 digits of precision. <b>If</b> <b>it</b> <b>were</b> <b>true,</b> it would disprove Fermat's last theorem, which had just been proven when this episode first aired. Cohen generated this [...] "Fermat near-miss" [...] with a computer program. After the episode aired, Cohen lurked on the newsgroup to see the response; at first there was astonishment when users tested it, but later there was despair when they found out it was only accurate to eight decimal places when expressed in scientific notation.|$|E
500|$|Abductive logic {{has three}} parts. First, {{there is the}} {{surprising}} fact—also called the result—that both Mulder and Scully are hallucinating, despite not taking any drugs. Second, there is Scully's hypothesis—the rule—that, <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>were</b> <b>true</b> the hallucination [...] "would {{be a matter of}} course". Third, there is the conclusion—the case—that [...] "there is a reason to suspect [...] as true." [...] This abduction, Abrams and Cooke point out, is an example of creative abduction, because Scully manages to pull three, separate ideas [...] "creatively" [...] together. Mulder, however, next makes an abductive conclusion. While discussing the events with Skinner, he states that he is not convinced, because drugs do not wear off only when one notices their effects. This abduction also has three parts. The result is the surprising fact that Mulder and Scully's escape seems problematic. The rule is that Mulder and Scully only think that they have escaped, but they really are still underground and being digested. Finally, the case states that [...] "there is reason to suspect that" [...] Mulder and Scully have not escaped from the mushroom. This type of logic is an example of undercoded abduction, because it is the most plausible rule among many.|$|E

500|$|Another {{suggestion}} is that the Cheyenne warriors, pressed to recount details of the Custer battle, were still reluctant to admit to killing soldiers for fear of punishment. A simple {{way out of this}} dilemma was to say when questioned by non-Indians that most of the soldiers died at their own hands. Researchers Fox and Thom Hatch say that Wooden Leg retracted the claim in later life; this would have been in extreme old age, as he had still not recanted at the age of 73 when the book was written, other than to say it was whisky that was the cause rather than prayer. In his book Cheyenne Memories, John Stands In Timber, tribal historian for the Northern Cheyenne, agrees: [...] "Wooden Leg said some other things (in his book) he took back later. One was that the soldiers were drunk, and many killed themselves. I went with two army men to see him one time. They wanted to find out about it. I interpreted... and we asked him <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>were</b> <b>true</b> that the Indians said the soldiers did that. He laughed and said there were just too many Indians. The soldiers did their best. He said if they had been drunk they would not have killed as many as they did. But it was in the book." ...|$|E
500|$|When {{the trades}} {{indicated}} production on Antz, Lasseter, feeling betrayed, called Katzenberg {{and asked him}} bluntly <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>were</b> <b>true,</b> who in turn asked him where {{he had heard the}} rumor. Lasseter asked again, and Katzenberg admitted it was true. Lasseter raised his voice and would not believe Katzenberg's story that a development director had pitched him the idea long ago. Katzenberg claimed Antz came from a 1991 story pitch by Tim Johnson that was related to Katzenberg in October 1994. Another source gives Nina Jacobson, one of Katzenberg's executives, as the person responsible for the Antz pitch. Lasseter, who normally did not use profane language, cursed at Katzenberg and hung up the phone. Lasseter recalled that Katzenberg began explaining that Disney was [...] "out to get him" [...] and that he realized that he was just cannon fodder in Katzenberg's fight with Disney. In truth, Katzenberg was the victim of a conspiracy: Eisner had decided not to pay him his contract-required bonus, convincing Disney's board not to give him anything. Katzenberg was further angered by the fact that Eisner scheduled Bugs to open the same week as The Prince of Egypt, which was then intended to be DreamWorks' first animated release. Lasseter grimly relayed the news to Pixar employees but kept morale high. Privately, Lasseter told other Pixar executives that he and Stanton felt terribly let down by Katzenberg.|$|E
2500|$|In a post-trial interview, one juror {{said that}} the defense {{provided}} a confusing checklist of events, e.g., that there were multiple locations of where the alleged punch occurred from the defense witnesses and that the defense witnesses were {{under the influence of}} alcohol at the time the alleged fight occurred. The juror also stated that Kyle's using a pseudonym for Ventura in the book was to keep it [...] "under wraps" [...] and that, <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>were</b> <b>true,</b> then the juror thought Kyle should have used Ventura's name. Additionally, the juror found it compelling from photographs in the days after the alleged punch that Kyle, who was over 6 feet tall, over 200 pounds and in top physical shape, could punch Ventura, who was on blood-thinners, knock him to the ground, and not leave a facial mark.|$|E

In May 2004, the Supreme Court overturned its precedent decision, and ruled that {{he was capable of}} standing trial. In arguing their case, the prosecution presented a recent TV interview Pinochet had given for a Miami-based television network, which raised doubts about his alleged mental incapacity. In December 2004 he was charged with several crimes, including the 1974 assassination of General Prats and the Operation Colombo case in which 119 died, and was again placed under house arrest. He suffered a stroke on 18 December 2004. Questioned by his judges in order to know if, as President, he was the direct head of DINA, he answered: [...] "I don't remember, but it's not true.

[...] "Don't go too far out on Wilson," [...] Cooper recalled Rove saying, adding that Wilson's wife worked at [...] "the agency."

[...] Cooper testified that when he spoke to Libby, he told Libby that he had heard that Joe Wilson's wife worked at the C.I.A. According to Cooper, Libby responded, [...] "I heard that too." [...] In Libby's grand jury testimony, Libby recalled telling Cooper that he'd heard something to that effect but that he didn't know for sure <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>were</b> <b>true.</b> In Libby's trial, Cooper's notes became the subject of intense scrutiny by the defense.|$|E

Peter Lampe, professor of New Testament Studies at the University of Heidelberg and working in archaeology, pointed out that in the 120s/130s C.E. in the port town of Maoza {{at the southern end of}} the Dead Sea, one Jewish household comprised the following names: Jesus, Simon, Mariame, Jacobus and Judah (Papyri Babatha 17 from 128 C.E.; 25-26 and 34 from 131 C.E.).

2500|$|In 323BC, Zhongshan {{formed a}} {{vertical}} alliance, allying itself with Wei, Han, Zhao, and Yan, {{in order to}} defend themselves against larger states like Qin, Qi, and Chu. This alliance allowed the states in it to claim the title of wang (a title roughly equivalent to King). King Wei of Qi, who had 11 years earlier taken the title of wang for himself, objected to this, saying: [...] "I am ashamed to be a king if the ruler of Zhongshan can be one too". He later went on to say: [...] "I am a state of ten thousand chariots and Zhongshan {{is one of a}} thousand chariots, how dare she [...] assume a title the equal of mine?". An important part of this statement can be seen in his reason for denouncing them claiming kingship is not that they were non-Chinese (Huaxi), which would very likely have been mentioned in the insult <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>were</b> <b>true.</b> The fact that Zhongshan was invited to the five state alliance is seen as another proof of them being Chinese, as a barbarian (Yi) country would never be invited to such an alliance. After this, King Wei of Qi asked Wei and Zhao to join him in attacking Zhongshan, to force them to abolish their title of wang, however, King Cuo sent an advisor, Zhang Deng, to these states, and successfully sowed discord and distrust amongst them, and no such alliance was formed.|$|E
