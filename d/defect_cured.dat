40|$|It is {{not unusual}} for {{practitioners}} reviewing a Delaware corporation's stock records to find omissions or procedural defects raising questions as to the valid authorization of some of the outstanding stock. Examples of such omissions and defects are limitless, but not infrequently found examples include the absence of board resolutions authorizing the issuance of stock shown by the transfer books as having been issued, the absence of evidence that issuances were properly authorized by the requisite votes of the board or, if required, by the stockholders, the absence of evidence that the consideration to have been received by the corporation in exchange for the stock was in fact received, the issuance of more shares than were authorized by the certificate of incorporation at the time, the issuance of stock prior to the filing of the charter amendment or certificate of designations authorizing or creating the stock, and similar procedural and substantive irregularities. Not infrequently, these defects occurred some time ago, and the stock in question may have changed hands multiple times since issuance. Confronted with such irregularities, most corporate lawyers' first instinct would be to attempt to correct the defect through board and, if necessary, stockholder, ratification of the defective issuance, with the intent of putting the parties in the positions they thought they were in prior to discovering the irregularity. However, Delaware courts have not always viewed defects in stock issuances as being curable by ratification. In a number of leading cases, the Delaware Supreme Court has treated the statutory formalities for the issuance of stock as substantive prerequisites to the validity of the stock being issued, and has determined that failure to comply with such formalities renders the stock in question void. A finding that stock is void means that defects in it cannot be cured, whether by ratification or otherwise. Thus, practitioners finding defects in stock issuances are put in the uncomfortable position of having to make a judgment whether the defect is one that renders the stock void, in which case ratification is not an option, or voidable, in which case ratification is an option. Unfortunately, the decisions issued by the Delaware courts have not afforded certainty in this critical area. Indeed, a recent decision of the Court of Chancery acknowledges that although "Delaware law is replete with cases" discussing the void-voidable distinction, the law as to when and whether a defective stock issuance can be cured "is not as clear as it could be. " This article analyzes the reasons for this lack of clarity, and proposes some solutions which would benefit buyers and sellers of corporate stock. We begin by examining the legal requirements applicable to stock issuances. Next, we discuss the foundation of the doctrinal distinction between void and voidable stock. We then discuss the cases where courts have found stock to have not been issued in accordance with these legal requirements, and whether such finding has resulted in the stock being found void or voidable. We also consider the purposes, principles and policies of certain provisions of Article 8 of the Uniform Commercial Code, designed to validate, in most circumstances, certain defects in stock in the hands of innocent purchasers for value. Interestingly, these provisions of the UCC have not been frequently discussed in the court cases that have considered whether stock is void or voidable, and the cases that have discussed them refer to them as setting forth an equitable rather than a legal principle - which is ultimately not helpful to corporate lawyers who opine on legal, not equitable, matters. In conclusion, we suggest that the policy underlying Article 8 of the Uniform Commercial Code to validate stock in the hands of innocent purchasers for value, notwithstanding technical defects in its issuance, should be recognized as a principle of law, not solely as a principle of equity, and should be applied by the Delaware courts as such. As a result, technical defects relating to statutory formalities should not lead to a finding of void stock, but at worst to voidable stock. Cure or ratification should be permitted except in cases where the issuance violates the directors' duty of loyalty or otherwise would be inequitable. Such a rule would allow practitioners to opine as to the validity of a corporation's outstanding stock where the stock was issued defectively but the <b>defect</b> <b>cured,</b> subject to a standard exception for fiduciary duties and other equitable matters, and would eliminate the risk that stock held in the trading markets or otherwise held by innocent purchasers for value might be deemed void...|$|E

Because of the inhomogeneity in the MWs (see Additional file  1 : Figure S 2), we measured ten different MWs (nine MWs the last week) chosen randomly each week, thus obtaining a general view about {{the response of the}} spontaneous emission at different stages of moisture exposure. In the first 4  weeks, the RH in the sample storage place was the same as the local weather conditions, being 45  ±  5 % in the first 3  weeks and rising to 55  ±  5 % in the fourth week. Then, from the fifth to the 11 th week, the RH of 80  ±  2 % was controlled with a salt-saturated solution (as described in the “Experimental” section). PL measurements were carried out with a red laser (λ =[*] 633  nm) and at low excitation power (~[*] 5  μW) {{in order to avoid the}} local heating and damage of the MWs by high laser intensities. The degradation by high laser intensities has been observed in polycrystalline MAPbI 3 films [28, 29], which is mainly due to the low thermal conductivity of MAPbI 3 [30]. Moreover, short acquisition time (10  s) was used to reduce the sample exposure to the laser light to avoid thermal decomposition and to minimize light soaking (<b>defects</b> <b>curing</b> effect) by trap filling from photogenerated free-charge carriers and O 2, which could reduce the nonradiative recombination channels and increases the PL intensity [10].

Hernia recurrence, adhesions, and histology (for inflammation and remodelling) were assessed at 4 and 8 weeks after implantation. Two large abdominal eventrations were cured by a human acellular matrix in human patients.

40|$|Graduation date: 1996 Raw {{material}} costs and limited material availability and quality have created significant {{interest in and}} opportunities {{for the application of}} nondestructive evaluation techniques to improve wood processing technologies. The incentives come from the desire to 1) manufacture the highest valued product, 2) conserve the amount of raw material used, 3) use lower priced and often, lower quality raw materials, and 4) meet future demands for wood products in an economy with stark contrasts of a declining wood supply and increasing pressure from environmental concerns. Developing appropriate non-destructive evaluation techniques requires research and development of new concepts and extending the usability of known principles. Dielectrics is one such technique that offers a number of potential applications in areas such as moisture detection, drying and re-drying, grading and sorting, <b>defect</b> detection, <b>curing</b> and gluing of engineered products, repairing and patching of laminated panel products, monitoring of adhesive curing, and manufacturing of aligned fiber products. The objective of this research was to fill the void in knowledge that existed about the dielectric properties of typical features found on Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) wood. Features investigated included clearwood, various sizes of loose and tight knots, knot holes, pitch pockets, pitch streaks, and blue stain. The dielectric constant and loss tangent were analyzed on a global (whole-feature) basis under a range of excitation frequencies and moisture content conditions typically found in wood processing. This research required the development of specialized instrumentation, because measuring the dielectric properties of wood over a broad full range of moisture and excitation frequency conditions is particularly challenging. Results suggested that there are optimal combinations of moisture and excitation frequencies suitable for applications where it is necessary to distinguish between certain wood features. Simple classifications of features measured at such optimal working conditions are presented in addition to global data on the expected dielectric properties of each feature. These results form a fundamental basis for the development of future stand-alone, dielectric-based applications or applications using dielectric-based in conjunction with and other sensing methods...|$|R

The development of radio frequency (RF) eddy current technology with frequency ranges up to 100  MHz {{made it possible to}} extend the classical fields of application even towards less conductive materials like CFRP [2][3](Table  2). It turns out that RF eddy current technology on CFRP generates a growing number of valuable information for comprehensive material diagnostic. Both permittivity and conductivity of CFRP influence the complex impedance measured with RF eddy current devices. The electrical conductivity contains information about fiber texture like orientations, gaps or undulations in a multilayered material. The permittivity characterization influenced by dielectric properties allows the determination of local <b>curing</b> <b>defects</b> on CFRP e. g. hot spots, thermal impacts or polymer degradation. An explanation for that effect is seen in the measurement frequency range and the capacitive structure of the carbon rovings. Using radio wave frequencies for testing, the effect of displacement currents cannot be neglected anymore. The capacitive structures formed by the carbon rovings is supposed to further strengthen the dielectric influences on eddy current measurement signal [3].

We cast the Einstein equations into their "relaxed" form of a flat-spacetime wave equation together with a harmonic gauge condition, and solve the equations formally as a retarded integral over the past null cone of the field point (chosen to be within the near zone when calculating equations of motion, and in the far zone when calculating gravitational radiation). The "inner" part of this integral(within a sphere of radius R ∼ one gravitational wavelength) is approximated in a slow-motion expansion using standard techniques; the "outer" part, extending over the radiation zone, is evaluated using a null integration variable. We show generally and explicitly that all contributions to the inner integrals that depend on R cancel corresponding terms from the outer integrals, and that the outer integrals converge at infinity, subject only to reasonable assumptions about the past behavior of the source. The method <b>cures</b> <b>defects</b> that plagued previous "brute-force" slow-motion approaches to motion and gravitational radiation for isolated systems.

The nuclear structure information are obtained in the Random Phase Approximation (RPA) framework with the Gogny force, which provides accurate descriptions of spherical nuclei without pairing. For medium energy (50 - 200 MeV) proton induced reactions, this approach gives very good predictions for direct inelastic scattering and for the first-step in direct preequilibrium emission. The one-step preequilibrium model has also been extended to fast neutron scattering (10 - 20 MeV) for the 90 Zr target described with RPA theory, and for axially deformed nuclei with a simpler description of the excited states (i. e. particle-hole excitations). Predictions of the reaction model reproduce well experimental data for 90 Zr. For deformed targets (232 Th and 238 U), our calculations underestimate the data at high emission energy.

For medium energy (50 - 200 MeV) proton in-duced reactions, this approach gives very good predictions for direct inelastic scattering and for the first-step in direct preequilibrium emission. The one-step preequilibrium model has also been extended to fast neutron scat-tering (10 - 20 MeV) for the 90 Zr target described with RPA theory, and for axially deformed nuclei with a simpler description of the excited states (i. e. particle-hole excitations). Predictions of the reaction model reproduce well experimental data for 90 Zr. For deformed targets (232 Th and 238 U), our calculations underestimate the data at high emission energy. The cross section missing for both actinides may stem from the excitation of vibrational states with excitation energies lower than 5 MeV which are not described with incoherent particle-hole excitations. This <b>defect</b> might be <b>cured</b> if the target spectra are described within the Quasi-particle-RPA (QRPA) theory recently implemented with the Gogny force. ...|$|R

In particular, 0. 3 %– 0. 5 % bioremediation reagents were fully mixed with the waste drilling sludge according to its wet and dry degree, and 1. 5 folds to twice weight of more finely ground soil was added in the mix, which was covered by soil of 5 – 15  cm thick and thereby grasses or greeneries were planted on the soil. The process was successfully applied to some fields of Well Danqian 001 - 8, Well Lianhua 000 -X 8, etc. After three months of such treatment, the main indexes of the drilling solid waste such as the degradation of COD and the oil-degrading ratio reached more than 90 %, the index of leaching solution met the requirement of the first grade in the national “Integrated Wastewater Discharge Standard”; heavy metal ion concentration in soil did not change significantly with the indicators meeting the requirement of the third grade in the national “Soil Environmental Quality Standard” (Dry Land); and no harmful effects of heavy metals have ever been found on the planted grasses and greeneries. In conclusion, with this microbe-soil technology, the soil property will recover its background values without any other chemical additives, realizing the ecological restoration and reuse of land covered by wellsite wastes, so it is in line with the energy-saving and environmentally-friendly treatment way...|$|R
40|$|Colloidal {{semiconductor}} {{quantum dots}} (QDs) have gained substantial interest as adjustable, bright and spectrally tunable fluorophores {{in the past}} decades. Besides their in-depth analyses in the scientific community, first industrial applications as color conversion and color enrichment materials were implemented. However, stability and processability are essential for their successful use in these and further applications. Methods to embed QDs into oxides or polymers can only partially solve this challenge. Recently, our group introduced the embedding of QDs into ionic salts, which holds several advantages in comparison to polymer or oxide-based counterparts. Both gas permeability and environmental-related degradation processes are negligible, making these composites an almost perfect choice of material. To evaluate this new class of QD-salt mixed crystals, {{a thorough understanding of}} the formation procedure and the final composites is needed. The present work is focused on embedding both aqueous-based and oil-based metal-chalcogenide QDs into several ionic salts and the investigations of their optical and chemical properties upon incorporation into the mixed crystals. QDs with well-known, reproducible and high-quality synthetic protocols are chosen as emissive species. CdTe QDs were incorporated into NaCl as host matrix by using the straightforward "classical" method. The resulting mixed crystals of various shapes and beautiful colors preserve the strong luminescence of the incorporated QDs. Besides NaCl, also borax and other salts are used as host matrices. Mercaptopropionic acid stabilized CdTe QDs can easily be co-crystallized with NaCl, while thioglycolic acid as stabilizing agent results in only weakly emitting powder-like mixed crystals. This challenge was overcome by adjusting the pH, the amount of free stabilizer and the type of salt used, demonstrating the reproducible incorporation of highest-quality CdTe QDs capped with thioglycolic acid into NaCl and KCl salt crystals. A disadvantage of the "classical" mixed crystallization procedure was its long duration which prevents a straightforward transfer of the protocol to less stable QD colloids, e. g., initially oil-based, ligand exchanged QDs. To address this challenge, the "Liquid-liquid-diffusion-assisted-crystallization" (LLDC) method is introduced. By applying the LLDC, a substantially accelerated ionic crystallization of the QDs is shown, reducing the crystallization time needed by one order of magnitude. This fast process opens the field of incorporating ligand-exchanged Cd-free QDs into NaCl matrices. To overcome the need for a ligand exchange, the LLDC can also be extended towards a two-step approach. In this modified version, the seed-mediated LLDC provides {{for the first time the}} ability to incorporate oil-based QDs directly into ionic matrices without a prior phase transfer. The ionic salts appear to be very tight matrices, ensuring the protection of the QDs from the environment. As one of the main results, these matrices provide extraordinary high photo- and chemical stability. It is further demonstrated with absolute measurements of photoluminescence quantum yields (PL-QYs), that the PL-QYs of aqueous CdTe QDs can be considerably increased upon incorporation into a salt matrix by applying the "classical" crystallization procedure. The achievable PL enhancement factors depend strongly on the PL-QYs of the parent QDs and can be described by the change of the dielectric surrounding as well as the passivation of the QD surface. Studies on CdSe/ZnS in NaCl and CdTe in borax showed a crystal-induced PL-QY increase below the values expected for the respective change of the refractive index, supporting the derived hypothesis of surface <b>defect</b> <b>curing</b> by a CdClx formation as one main factor for PL-QY enhancement. The mixed crystals developed in this work show a high suitability as color conversion materials regarding both their stability and spectral tunability. First proof-of-concept devices provide promising results. However, a combination of the highest figures of merit at the same time is intended. This ambitious goal is reached by implementing a model-experimental feedback approach which ensures the desired high optical performance of the used emitters throughout all intermediate steps. Based on the approach, a white LED combining an incandescent-like warm white with an exceptional high color rendering index and a luminous efficacy of radiation is prepared. It is the first time that a combination of this highly related figures of merit could be reached using QD-based color converters. Furthermore, the idea of embedding QDs into ionic matrices gained considerable interest in the scientific community, resulting in various publications of other research groups based on the results presented here. In summary, the present work provides a profound understanding how this new class of QD-salt mixed crystal composites can be efficiently prepared. Applying the different crystallization methods and by changing the matrix material, mixed crystals emitting from blue to the near infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum can be fabricated using both Cd-containing and Cd-free QDs. The resulting composites show extraordinary optical properties, combining the QDs spectral tunability with the rigid and tight ionic matrix of the salt. Finally, their utilization as a color conversion material resulted in a high-quality white LED that, for the first time, combines an incandescent-like hue with outstanding optical efficacy and color rendering properties. Besides that, the mixed crystals offer huge potential in other high-quality applications which apply photonic and optoelectronic components...|$|R

This biomimetic study presents {{the synthesis of}} a nature-inspired composite membrane, consisting of polydymethylsiloxane (PDMS) as the active hydrophobic layer and hydrophilic polyphenylsulfone membrane as a sublayer. Although the application of PDMS coating on membrane's surface is well-known, the combined usage of both components is very innovative for potentially removing organic matters in wastewater stream in pervaporation (PV). The PPSU membrane was synthesized using a phase inversion-immersion precipitation. It is found that the membranes exhibited diminished macrovoids and contain less finger-like pores with the increasing polymer solution concentration. On the other hand, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the membrane top layer showed the existence of nodular structures, {{with some degree of}} porosity as the PPSU content in the polymer solution decreases. Thus {{it is clear that the}} surface of the membrane containing some <b>defects</b> was effectively <b>cured</b> by the PDMS coating. This artificial surface of PDMS/PPSU membranes was then investigated using sessile drop analysis. Result indicates that the contact angle measurement for the modified surface of the membrane has achieved the range of hydrophobic surface. It was concluded that, surface of the membrane can be further modified to increase the degree of hydrophobicity by applying nano technology to achieve the fascinating effect. status: accepte...|$|R
40|$|The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{is able to}} {{use some}} biotin {{precursors}} for biotin biosynthesis. Insertion of a sulfur atom into desthiobiotin, the final step in the biosynthetic pathway, is catalyzed by biotin synthase (Bio 2). This mitochondrial protein contains two iron-sulfur (Fe/S) clusters that catalyze the reaction and are thought {{to act as a}} sulfur donor. To identify new components of biotin metabolism, we performed a genetic screen and found that Isa 2, a mitochondrial protein involved in the formation of Fe/S proteins, is necessary for the conversion of desthiobiotin to biotin. Depletion of Isa 2 or the related Isa 1, however, did not prevent the de novo synthesis of any of the two Fe/S centers of Bio 2. In contrast, Fe/S cluster assembly on Bio 2 strongly depended on the Isu 1 and Isu 2 proteins. Both isa mutants contained low levels of Bio 2. This phenotype was also found in other mutants impaired in mitochondrial Fe/S protein assembly and in wild-type cells grown under iron limitation. Low Bio 2 levels, however, did not cause the inability of isa mutants to utilize desthiobiotin, since this <b>defect</b> was not <b>cured</b> by overexpression of BIO 2. Thus, the Isa proteins are crucial for the in vivo function of biotin synthase but not for the de novo synthesis of its Fe/S clusters. Our data demonstrate that the Isa proteins are essential for the catalytic activity of Bio 2 in vivo. Biotin is a water-soluble vitamin that functions as a prosthetic group of many carboxylases.

It is a protein isoform that {{has undergone a}} conformational change which converts the normal form of the protein into the infectious form with the same amino acid sequence. Yeast [PSI+] prion is the prion isoform of Sup 35 protein, a translation termination factor eRF 3. It {{has been suggested that}} prion [PSI+] is controlled by the ensemble of chaperones with Hsp 104 playing the major role. The previous work performed in the Chernoffs lab showed that the defective GET pathway caused by get led to the <b>defect</b> in [PSI+] <b>curing</b> by excess Hsp 104. The GET pathway is a system responsible for transporting newly synthesized TA-protein to the ER membrane, and the components which have been proven to be involved in this pathway include: Get 1, Get 2, Get 3, Get 4, Get 5 and Sgt 2. In this study we describe the mechanism underlying the effect of the defective GET pathway on [PSI+]. We demonstrate that Sgt 2, one of the components of GET pathway, interacts with Sup 35 in both [PSI+] and [psi-] strains through its prion domain. Overproduction of Sgt 2 and Hsp 70 -Ssa is triggered by the defective GET pathway and leads to the protection of [PSI+] aggregates from curing by excess Hsp 104. We show that the direct interaction between Sgt 2 and Hsp 70 -Ssa is not required for this protective effect.
