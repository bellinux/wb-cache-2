When one of the player's characters directly attacks an enemy with a weapon, they can repeatedly attack the enemy by pressing the button {{in time with the}} beat of the background music, with each enemy possessing a musical theme with different rhythms. Using this system, the player can attack the enemy up to sixteen times in a row. When the correct beat is not apparent, the player can put the enemy to sleep to isolate the beat from the music.|$|E

A few months later, Brooks mentioned that {{he was working on}} a screenplay called Springtime for Hitler, for which he thought Wilder would be perfect in the role of Leo Bloom. Brooks elicited a promise from Wilder that he would check with him before making any long-term commitments. Months went by, and Wilder toured the country with different theatre productions, participated in a televised CBS presentation of Death of a Salesman, and was cast for his first role in a film—a minor role in Arthur Penn's 1967 Bonnie and Clyde. After three years of not hearing from Brooks, Wilder was called for a reading with Zero Mostel, who was to be the star of Springtime for Hitler and had approval of his co-star. Mostel approved, and Wilder was cast for his first leading role in a feature film, 1968's The Producers.|$|E
5|$|Saddles {{were made}} of wood and were {{designed}} as a standing platform for archers. They were not suited for riding long distances or at high speed. Early saddles of the Nara period were of Chinese style karagura and later modified for local tastes, resulting in Japanese style saddles from the Heian period onward. Artisans and carpenters {{became involved in the}} saddle production as saddles became more elaborate in the Kamakura period, with decorations <b>in</b> <b>mother</b> of pearl inlay, gold leaf and multiple coats of lacquer. Saddles ceased to be primarily utilitarian, instead serving as adornment showing the owner's status in processions. Three Japanese style lacquered wooden saddles and a complete set of a Chinese style ritual saddle, dating to the late Heian and Kamakura periods, have been designated as National Treasures.|$|E

Meanwhile, 49. 9 % of the respondents were not satisfied with technical quality aspect and 67. 1 % were not satisfied with physical environment aspect.

The film drew on both Sirk's melodramas and Weimar era workers' films, connecting the genres to tell a political coming of age story about Mother Küsters, who seeks to understand what led to her husband's actions and how to respond. The film is very critical of the era's politics and media, as the people to whom Emma Küsters turns all exploit her and her experience. The media, communists, anarchists and even her own family members all take advantage of Mother Küsters's tragedy to advance their own agendas.|$|E

Berlin Alexanderplatz was moved to a late night television slot amid widespread complaints that it was unsuitable for children. The most heated criticism came for his play Trash, the City, and Death, whose scheduled performance at the Theater am Turm in Frankfurt was cancelled early in 1975 amid charges of anti-semitism. Though published at the time, and quickly withdrawn, the play was not performed until five years after Fassbinder's death by Thieves Theatre in 1987 at ABC No Rio. In the turmoil, Fassbinder resigned from his directorship of that prestigious theater complex, complaining that the play had been misinterpreted.|$|E

Some autistic-like traits have been reported <b>in</b> <b>mothers</b> of autistic children. We hypothesized that dysregulation of oxytocin (OXT), Arg-vasopressin (AVP) and sex hormones, found in autistic children, may also exist <b>in</b> their <b>mothers.</b> Methods: We determined plasma levels of OXT (40 in autism vs. 26 in control group), AVP (40 vs. 17) and sex hormones (61 vs. 47) <b>in</b> <b>mothers</b> of autistic and normal children by enzyme immunoassay and radioimmunoassay, respectively and investigated their relationships with the children’s autistic behavior scores (Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS) and Autism Behavior Checklist (ABC)).

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{determine}} the prevalence of psychological distress, depression, anxiety, and stress among postpartum Arab mothers of preterm or low birth weight (LBW) infants and to identify maternal characteristics that can predict psychological distress among mothers of preterm infants. Methods: A hospital-based study was conducted. A representative sample of 2, 091 postpartum mothers was surveyed and 1, 659 women (79. 3 %) gave their consent to participate in the study. The study was based on a face-to-face interview with a designed questionnaire covering sociodemographic characteristics, anthropometric measures, medical history, and maternal characteristics. Depression, anxiety, and stress were measured using the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS- 21). Results: In the study sample, 10. 2 % of the postpartum mothers had preterm/LBW infants. Depression (29. 4 vs. 17. 3 %) and anxiety (26. 5 vs. 11. 6 %) were significantly more common among mothers of preterm births compared to mothers of full term infants (p < 0. 001). The risk of depression <b>in</b> <b>mothers</b> of preterm/LBW infants was two times the risk <b>in</b> <b>mothers</b> of full term infants, while the risk of anxiety was 2. 7 times <b>in</b> <b>mothers</b> of preterm/LBW infants than <b>in</b> <b>mothers</b> of full term infants. Young mothers and those who had less than secondary education (42. 0 vs. 21. 7 %; p = 0. 007) and lower monthly household income (72. 0 vs. 53. 3 %; p = 0. 024) were more depressed and anxious after the preterm birth when compared with mothers of full term infants. Psychological distress was higher <b>in</b> <b>mothers</b> with history of preterm birth (30. 0 vs. 21. 7 %) and delivery complications (52. 0 vs. 33. 3 %). Conclusions: We found a greater risk of depression and anxiety <b>in</b> <b>mothers</b> of preterm births than <b>in</b> <b>mothers</b> of full term infants. Our analysis revealed that depressed and anxious women of preterm infants were younger, less educated, had a lower body weight and low household income than non-depressed and non-anxious women...|$|R

EarthBound characters such as Mr. Saturn recur, and RPGamer wrote that Mother 3 final chapter is [...] "full of blatant links" [...] between the games of the series. Mother also shares similarities with its sequel, such as the game save option through phoning Ninten's father, an option to store items with Ninten's sister at home, and an automated teller machine for banking money.
