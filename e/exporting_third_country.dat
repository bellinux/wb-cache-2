40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{a method to}} consolidate national supply-use tables (SUTs) into a single supra-regional SUT. The method deals with mirror trade statistics problems, such as the different valuation of imports and exports, and it corrects for the double-counting of re-exports. To test {{the contribution of the}} various construction steps, the paper decomposes the EU value added that is embodied in the EU <b>exports</b> to <b>third</b> <b>countries</b> into seven components. When the national SUTs for the period 2000 - 2007 are used, neglecting intra-EU spillover and feedback effects between the 27 EU-members results in an underestimation of the embodied value added of 12 - 15 %. Not consolidating the national tables leads to a further under-estimation of 11 - 16 %. Both types of errors are substantial. With these underestimations removed, the <b>exports</b> to <b>third</b> <b>countries</b> still only explain around 11 % of the EU 27 GDP. ...|$|R

With three exporting countries, the lowest-quality exporting country gains from taxing domestic R&D and the middle-quality exporting country gains from subsidizing domestic R&D under both Bertrand and Cournot competition. As in the duopoly case, however, the unilaterally optimal policy for the highest-quality exporting country depends on the mode of competition.

Using a conditional logit model, and trade data at the SITC 5 -digit level, we estimate the effect of new within-PTA exports on the subsequent exports to thirdnation markets.

Israeli firms purchased production rights and entered into joint ventures with foreign companies to manufacture both end products and components. Nearly every electronics firm had links of some sort with United States producers. Purchase agreements for foreign military equipment frequently specified that production data and design information, together with coproduction rights, be accorded to Israel. Nevertheless, American firms often were reluctant to supply advanced technology because of fears that Israel would adapt the technology for use in items to be <b>exported</b> to <b>third</b> <b>countries</b> on an unrestricted basis. Some American firms also feared that collaboration would encourage Israeli competition in already saturated world markets.|$|R
40|$|An {{interesting}} empirical {{phenomenon is}} export-platform foreign-direct investment, particularly affiliate production {{for sale in}} <b>third</b> <b>countries</b> {{rather than in the}} parent or host countries. This is rather poorly understood because our theoretical understanding of multinationals is largely derived from two-country models. Our model shows how affiliate production solely for <b>third</b> <b>countries</b> can occur when a firm in each of two large, high-income countries has a domestic plant to serve its own market, and uses a plant in a small, low-cost country to serve the other highincome country. Third-country export-platform FDI can also occur when the host and <b>third</b> <b>countries</b> are inside a free-trade area and the parent is outside. Our empirical section shows that US affiliates located inside a free-trade area concentrate their exports to other free-trade member countries, consistent with parameterizations of our model in which the outside firm is the chief beneficiary of the free-trade area. Affiliates located outside of free-trade areas such as those in Southeast Asia show a balance between exports to the parent and <b>exports</b> to <b>third</b> <b>countries,</b> consistent with parameterizations that generate “global export-platform” production.

40|$|This paper explores China's {{competitive}} threat to Latin America in trade in manufactured goods. The {{direct threat to}} <b>exports</b> to <b>third</b> <b>country</b> markets appears small: Latin America and the Caribbean's (LAC's) trade structure is largely complementary to that of China. In bilateral trade, several LAC countries are increasing primary and resource-based exports to China. However, the pattern of trade, with LAC specializing increasingly in resource-based products and China in manufactured goods, seems worrying. Given cumulative capability building, China's success in increasingly technology-based products with strong learning externalities can place it on a higher growth path than specialization in "simpler" goods, as in LAC. China may thus affect LAC's technological upgrading in exports and industrial production. The issue {{is not so much}} current competition as the "spaces" open for LAC in the emerging technology-based world...|$|R

Firms first compete in qualities and then <b>export</b> to a <b>third</b> <b>country</b> market based on Bertrand or Cournot competition.

Under Bertrand competition, the low-quality country subsidizes investment to raise export quality, while the high-quality country imposes a tax so as to reduce {{the quality of its}} already high quality exports.

Transshipment and re-exports through Hong Kong seem no longer to be the major explanation of the discrepancies, especially in recent years.

Whereas the joint gravity equation provides evidence on the aggregate effect of the euro on intra-European trade, by isolating the individual countries, we assess which of the member countries have obtained a larger benefit from the euro. The results show that the euro has had a positive though small effect on trade. Belgium and Luxembourg, France and Italy are the countries more benefited from the introduction of the euro.
