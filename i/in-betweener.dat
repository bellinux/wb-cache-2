He worked as an <b>in-betweener</b> and inker on the 1939 animated film Gulliver's Travels, and later became a gag writer for the Popeye and Betty Boop cartoon series, among others. [...] He also anonymously produced comic strips for Jerry Iger under the Fiction House label.|$|E

50|$|The <b>In-Betweener</b> later {{attempts}} to supplant Galactus' {{role in the}} universe and allies with the Elders of the Universe in their plan against Galactus. However, the <b>In-Betweener</b> betrays the Elders during a confrontation with the entity Death and compels Death to wipe three of the Elders from existence. Soon after this the <b>In-Betweener</b> also battles Galactus and his robotic servant the Punisher, but the stalemated battle is interrupted by his masters, who subsequently imprison him.|$|E

The Nowhere-at-all is filled with Magic, while the Static has Science. Traveling from world to world takes weeks or days, except through the <b>In-Between.</b> However, only Walkers can go there.

40|$|In {{previous}} mesh morphing techniques, the vertex set and connectivity of an <b>in-between</b> mesh {{are fixed}} {{and only the}} vertex positions are interpolated between input meshes. With this restriction, to accurately represent both source and target shapes, an <b>in-between</b> mesh should contain a much larger number of vertices than input meshes. This paper proposes a novel approach for mesh morphing, which includes connectivity changes in a metamorphosis. With the approach, an <b>in-between</b> mesh contains only the vertices from the input meshes and so the <b>in-between</b> vertex count does not exceed the sum of source and target vertex counts. The connectivity changes are realized by a sequence of edge swap operations, determined by considering the geometric errors from the input meshes. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach generates almost same <b>in-between</b> shapes as the metamesh-based approach with a much smaller number of vertices...|$|R
40|$|Our {{research}} {{begins with}} understanding human experience {{and continues to}} inquire on, what we refer to, as the iterated window metaphor that frames the <b>in-between</b> to inform the practice of business design. Our exploration first attempts to understand human experience by exploring how humans perceive and inform their experience through the philosophies of Pragmatism and Hermeneutics. Then, through a method of action research, we tested a set of assumptions that built {{an understanding of the}} research question: how might the <b>in-between</b> inform designers to enable embodied meaning in an experience at an organization. Along our journey, we found that the term <b>in-between</b> is defined as a physical state of <b>in-between,</b> where one stands in the middle and it is the phase of a transition in understanding. This transition of understanding, or interpretation becoming meaning, starts in the present and transitions from one’s past experience to a new understanding. As researchers, we personally are situated in the <b>in-between</b> as we are between our two different human experiences that have led us to this collaboration, the two fields of business and design, academia and the organization, and our stakeholders of Microwave and Packet Core at Ericsson Site Lindholmen. Specifically, the aim of this research is testing the use of the <b>in-between</b> (metaphorically, philosophically and literally) in creating design criteria for an Experience Center at Site Lindholmen. Our process inquires through a documentation of a spectrum of events and experiences, both inside and outside Ericsson. The aesthetic events proved to inform how meaning is interpreted, or misinterpreted. The Ericsson events informed the communication of the organization, but also included the practice of working with our stakeholders. This co-creation required a collective sense-making dialogue and using designerly methods, such as externalization and visualization. Hence, embodying the <b>in-between</b> throughout this research we found and understood the importance of the process: doing, reflecting, framing and iterating. As practitioners of business design we realized through this research that the <b>in-between</b> informs the practice as our proposed notion of the <b>in-between</b> stance. The <b>in-between</b> stance is an active balancing act that navigates uncertainty and finds peaceful moments of understanding. Applying the <b>in-between</b> stance when designing an intended experience with other humans at an organization, enables embodied meaning...|$|R

5000|$|By the In-Betweener's own admission, he {{represents}} duality itself, specifically {{in respect to}} concepts such as good and evil, reason and emotion, truth and illusion, and life and death. The <b>In-Betweener</b> is also {{an agent of the}} conceptual beings Lord Chaos and Master Order, although his loyalty is usually to himself rather than to them. In addition to being an incarnation of balance and duality, the <b>In-Betweener</b> is possibly a metaphysical counterpart of Galactus.|$|E
5000|$|Despite this setback, {{the eight}} Elders {{continue}} their plot against Galactus. While the five Elders within Galactus inflict a fatal case of [...] "cosmic indigestion" [...] upon him, the three Elders in the mystical realm conspire with the cosmic entity the <b>In-Betweener</b> to restore him {{in exchange for}} him returning them to their home reality and his promise to kill Galactus. Using the Silver Surfer, Mister Fantastic, and the Invisible Woman (whom Galactus had sent {{in search of the}} Infinity Gems), the <b>In-Betweener</b> is restored and he brings the Elders back to their own reality. Once there, the <b>In-Betweener</b> attempts to kill Galactus but discovers that he cannot do so. When he announces his intention to hurl Galactus into the black hole instead, the three Elders, who wanted to rescue their brother Elders from within Galactus, threaten him with the other five Infinity Gems to stop him. The <b>In-Betweener</b> responds by summoning Death and forcing her to negate them despite her vow. As a result, the Astronomer, the Trader and the Possessor and his Runestaff are apparently disintegrated. The ship carrying Galactus is then thrown into the black hole and passes through to the mystical realm where the In-Betweeners's creators, Master Order and Lord Chaos, force the five Elders within Galactus to exit his body, restoring the world-devourer. During the subsequent battle between Galactus and the <b>In-Betweener,</b> the quintet are eventually persuaded to help Galactus defeat his foe. Moments later, the five Elders use their Infinity Gems to instantaneously travel very far away from Galactus and his vengeance.|$|E
