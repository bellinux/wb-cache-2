2500|$|At {{the same}} time as Merton's work and with Merton's assistance, Fischer Black and Myron Scholes {{developed}} the Black–Scholes model, which was awarded the 1997 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences. [...] It provided a solution for a practical problem, that of finding a fair price for a European call option, i.e., the right to buy one share of a given stock at a specified price and time. [...] Such options are frequently purchased by investors as a risk-hedging device. In 1981, Harrison and Pliska used the general theory of continuous-time stochastic processes to put the Black–Scholes model on a solid theoretical basis, and showed how to price numerous other <b>derivative</b> <b>securities.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Behavioral {{psychology}} {{approaches to}} stock market trading are {{among some of}} the more promising alternatives to EMH (and some investment strategies seek to exploit exactly such inefficiencies). But Nobel Laureate co-founder of the programme Daniel Kahneman —announced his skepticism of investors beating the market: [...] "They're [...] just {{not going to do it}} [...] It's just not going to happen." [...] Indeed, defenders of EMH maintain that Behavioral Finance strengthens the case for EMH in that it highlights biases in individuals and committees and not competitive markets. For example, one prominent finding in Behaviorial Finance is that individuals employ hyperbolic discounting. It is demonstrably true that bonds, mortgages, annuities and other similar financial instruments subject to competitive market forces do not. Any manifestation of hyperbolic discounting in the pricing of these obligations would invite arbitrage thereby quickly eliminating any vestige of individual biases. Similarly, diversification, <b>derivative</b> <b>securities</b> and other hedging strategies assuage if not eliminate potential mispricings from the severe risk-intolerance (loss aversion) of individuals underscored by behavioral finance. On the other hand, economists, behaviorial psychologists and mutual fund managers are drawn from the human population and are therefore subject to the biases that behavioralists showcase. By contrast, the price signals in markets are far less subject to individual biases highlighted by the Behavioral Finance programme. Richard Thaler has started a fund based on his research on cognitive biases. In a 2008 report he identified complexity and herd behavior as central to the global financial crisis of 2008.|$|E

40|$|When {{the market}} is {{incomplete}} a new non-redundant <b>derivative</b> <b>security</b> cannot be priced by no arbitrage arguments alone. Moreover {{there will be a}} multiplicity of stochastic discount factors and each of them may give a different price for the new <b>derivative</b> <b>security.</b> This paper develops an approach to the selection of a stochastic discount factor for pricing a new <b>derivative</b> <b>security.</b> The approach is {{based on the idea that}} the price of a <b>derivative</b> <b>security</b> should not vary too much when the payoff of the primitive security is slightly perturbed, i. e., the price of the derivative should be robust to model misspecification. The paper develops two metrics of robustness. The first is based on robustness in expectation. The second is based on robustness in probability and draws on tools from the theory of large deviations. We show that in a stochastic volatility model, the two metrics yield analytically tractable bounds for the derivative price as the underlying stochastic volatility model is perturbed. The bounds can be readily used for numerical examination of the sensitivity of the price of the derivativ...|$|R

40|$|In {{this thesis}} we have {{explored}} {{a new class}} of measures ν_theta on configuration spaces Γ_X (of countable subsets of Euclidean space X=R^d), obtained as a push-forward of "lattice" Gibbs measure θ on X^Z^d.

It has also been proved that the generator of the Dirichlet form of ν_θ satisfies log-Sobolev inequality, which is not typical for measures on configuration spaces. Stochastic dynamics of a particle in random environment distributed according to the measure ν_θ, is presented as an example of possible application of this construction. We consider a toy model of a market, where this stochastic dynamics represents the volatility process of certain European <b>derivative</b> <b>security.</b> We have derived the "Black-Scholes type" pricing partial differential equation for this <b>derivative</b> <b>security.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} family of hedging {{strategies}} for a European <b>derivative</b> <b>security</b> in a stochastic volatility environment. The strategies are robust to specification of the volatility process and do not need a parametric description of it or estimation of the volatility risk premium.

The formula exploits the separation between the time scale of asset price fluctuation (ticks) and the longer time scale over which volatility fluctuates, that is, the observed "persistence" of volatility. We run simulations that demonstrate {{the effectiveness of the}} strategies over the classical Black-Scholes strategy. 1 Introduction In this article we present {{a family of}} hedging strategies for a European <b>derivative</b> <b>security</b> that super-replicate the claim with a controllable success probability, in a stochastic volatility environment.

40|$|The {{essential}} idea of {{this paper}} is that one should not separate the method of computing the expected present value of a derivative from its ultimate computing topology. In the following sections, we discuss the costbenefit issues involved with implementing several methods for computing derivative statistics on alternate computing topologies. We show how the choice of topology impacts the computing time for a particular example of a time consuming derivative valuation. We conclude by showing how all these factors can be represented as a case-based expert system, which can be used to help an organization assess its computing alternatives. 1. Background: Algorithm Tradeoffs in Computing Derivatives We are concerned with the computational problem of deriving the expected value and other statistics of a <b>derivative</b> <b>security</b> f at time T 0.
