Different self-organizing streams can be coupled, yielding complex, self-organizing information processing systems. These associeties can span the entire periphery-centre axis of an agent.

For this reason, it is essential that WSNs always work to reduce the power consumption as much as possible in order to maximize its lifetime. In this context, this paper presents SITRUS (semantic infrastructure for wireless sensor networks), which aims to reduce the power consumption of WSN nodes using ontologies. SITRUS consists of two major parts: a message-oriented middleware responsible for both an oriented message communication service and a reconfiguration service; and a semantic <b>information</b> <b>processing</b> <b>module</b> whose purpose is to generate a semantic database that provides the basis to decide whether a WSN node needs to be reconfigurated or not.

Normally, analysis of land potentiality and feasibility study for investment are necessary pre-processed for supporting urban planning, developing and architectural designing.

In this research, we propose a policy making support system for urban planning project development providing several {{functions such as}} testing land use and its physical character which are important to urban expansion and architectural design based on impact analysis of urban comprehensive plan. The proposed integrated system consists of a topological analysis module, constraint checking module and geographical <b>information</b> <b>processing</b> <b>module.</b> First, Geographical information stored in 3 D graphic file format is converted to object-oriented data model and stored in a database.

While controlling building properties, the software can model the buildings and generate urban physical character. The result is then checked by several urban landscape planning experts.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{functions}} of a eukaryotic cell are largely performed by multi-subunit protein complexes {{that act as}} molecular machines or <b>information</b> <b>processing</b> <b>modules</b> in cellular networks. An important problem in systems biology is to understand how, in general, these molecular machines respond to perturbations. Results In yeast, genes that inhibit growth when their expression is reduced are strongly enriched amongst the subunits of multi-subunit protein complexes. This applies to both the core and peripheral subunits of protein complexes, and the subunits of each complex normally have the same loss-of-function phenotypes. In contrast, genes that inhibit growth when their expression is increased are not enriched amongst the core or peripheral subunits of protein complexes, and the behaviour of one subunit of a complex is not predictive for the other subunits with respect to over-expression phenotypes. Conclusion We propose the principle that the overall activity of a protein complex is in general robust to an increase, but not to {{a decrease in the}} expression of its subunits. This means that whereas phenotypes resulting from a decrease in gene expression can be predicted because they cluster on networks of protein complexes, over-expression phenotypes cannot be predicted in this way. We discuss the implications of these findings for understanding how cells are regulated, how they evolve, and how genetic perturbations connect to disease in humans. </p...|$|R

40|$|The general {{principle}} of combining <b>information</b> <b>processing</b> <b>modules</b> in a feed-forward manner, to sequentially process input until the desired output has been generated, is well understood and widely used.

The representation of semantic knowledge in a teenage child (S.

These <b>modules</b> are “wired” together in large networks that control major processes such as development; they constitute “genomic computers. ” Each control module receives multiple inputs {{in the form of}} the incident transcription factors which bind to them.

Here we consider the operating principles of the genomic computer, the product of evolution, in comparison to those of electronic computers. For example, in the genomic computer intra-machine communication occurs by means of diffusion (of transcription factors), while in electronic computers it occurs by electron transit along pre-organized wires. There follow fundamental differences in design principle in respect to the meaning of time, speed, multiplicity of processors, memory, robustness of computation and hardware and software.
