60|$|Thinking such {{thoughts}} as these, Juanna strolled {{back towards the}} camp along a little pathway in the reeds, and suddenly {{came face to face}} with Leonard. She was clad in a white Arab robe, part of the loot, which she had adapted cleverly to the purposes of a dress, fastening it round her slender waist with an embroidered scarf. She wore no hat, and her rich dark hair was twisted into a <b>great</b> <b>knot</b> that shone in the sunlight. In her hand she held some crimson lilies which she had gathered, that made a spot of colour on the whiteness of her dress. The look of haunting terror was gone from her face, whose beauty had come back during her sleep; her changing eyes shone beneath their dark lashes, and she moved with the grace of a fawn.|$|E
40|$|Following {{the closure}} of the Saemangeum seawall in South Korea in 2006 the Yalu jiang National Nature Reserve, Liaoning, China became the most {{important}} staging site in the EAAF for <b>Great</b> <b>Knots</b> Calidris tenuirostris on northward migration.

60|$|She {{was very}} oddly dressed; {{she was quite}} naked from her head to below her breasts; her breasts were plump and round, not flaggy and hanging down, as it {{generally}} is with the Indian women, some of whose breasts hang as low as their bellies, but projecting as beautifully {{as if they had}} been laced up with stays round her body; and below her breast she had a broad piece of a skin of some curious creature, spotted like a leopard, probably of some fine spotted deer. This was wrapped round her very tight, like a body-girt to a horse; and under this she had a kind of petticoat, as before described, hanging down to her ankles. As for shoes or stockings, they were only such as nature had furnished. Her hair was black, and, as supposed, very long, being wreathed up and twisted in long locks about the plate of gold she wore; for when she pulled off the plate above mentioned, it hung down her back and upon her shoulders very gracefully; but it seems she did not think so, for, as soon as she found it so fallen down, she caused one of her women to roll it up, and tie it in a <b>great</b> <b>knot</b> which hung down in her neck, and did not look so well as when it was loose.|$|E
60|$|A feeble, white-haired old man entered, {{leaning on}} the arm of an indescribably {{beautiful}} woman. Not thirty yet, tall and nobly molded, with straight black brows over magnificent eyes; rippling dark hair gathered up in a <b>great</b> <b>knot,</b> and ornamented with a single band of gold. A sweeping dress of wine-colored velvet, set off with a dazzling neck and arms decorated like her stately head with ornaments of Roman gold. At the first glance she seemed a cold, haughty creature, born to dazzle but not to win. A deeper scrutiny detected lines of suffering in that lovely face, and behind the veil of reserve, which pride forced her to wear, appeared the anguish of a strong-willed woman burdened by a heavy cross. No one would dare express pity or offer sympathy, for her whole air repelled it, and in her gloomy eyes sat scorn of herself mingled with defiance of the scorn of others. A strange, almost tragical-looking woman, in spite of beauty, grace, and the cold sweetness of her manner. A faint smile parted her lips as she greeted those about her, and as her husband seated himself beside Lady Treherne, she lifted her head with a long breath, and a singular expression of relief, as if a burden was removed, and for the time being she was free. Sir Jasper was at her side, and as she listened, her eye glanced from face to face.|$|E

40|$|Stopover ecology is the {{scientific}} study of the behaviour of migrants, the interrelationships among migrants, and between migrants and their environment, at stopping sites. Many shorebird species are long-distance migrants and require high quality stopping sites to rest and refuel during migration. The suitability of a stopping site depends mostly on food availability, level of competition, and predation or disturbance pressure. Events at stopover may not only affect migration performance, but also the subsequent reproduction or survival, and therefore become the limiting factor for the population sizes of migrants. The stopping sites in the Yellow Sea along the East Asian-Australasian Flyway are used extensively by long-distance migratory shorebirds along the flyway, but very {{little is known about the}} stopover ecology of these birds. Moreover, the stopping sites within the Yellow Sea region are under serious threats; some of them are being lost before their importance to shorebirds is fully understood. In this thesis, my aim was to study the stopover ecology of Bar-tailed Godwits Limosa lapponica and <b>Great</b> <b>Knots</b> Calidris tenuirostris at an important stopping site in the northern Yellow Sea, the Yalu Jiang coastal wetland, during northward migration between 2010 and 2012. I estimated the number of these shorebirds transiting and their passage dates using repeated counts incorporated with Thompson’s modelling approach. I described the type, abundance and characteristics of their benthos resources by benthos sampling. I investigated their dietary compositions, foraging patterns and mechanisms of coexistence by behaviour scans, focal bird observations and faecal dropping analysis. Finally, I studied their predation impact on their main bivalve prey, Potamocorbula laevis, using exclosures. My results indicated that at least 42 % of the East Asian-Australasian Flyway’s northward migrating L. l. baueri godwits, 19 % of L. l. menzbieri godwits, and 22 % of the <b>Great</b> <b>Knots</b> used Yalu Jiang coastal wetland, thereby indicating the importance of the study area to these species. Polychaetes and bivalves numerically dominated the benthic communities, while one bivalve species, P. laevis, constituted more than three quarters of total macrobenthic biomass during the study period. <b>Great</b> <b>Knots,</b> Red Knots Calidris canutus and Far Eastern Oystercatchers Haematopus ostralegus osculans selected mostly the bivalve P. laevis while Bar-tailed Godwits had a broader diet and selected mostly polychaetes, even though most of their intake was of P. laevis. Moreover, the size of P. laevis preferred by godwits and <b>Great</b> <b>Knots</b> overlapped. Their coexistence seems to be enabled by high resource availability rather than niche separation. The different dietary selections between godwits and knots possibly led to different foraging patterns on the tidal flats. There was clear behavioural evidence that a digestive bottleneck existed in the bivalve-feeding shorebirds. Such digestive constraints of hard-shelled prey, decreased prey quality (amount of energy per dry mass of shell taken), and increased handling and searching time were potential reasons behind a decline in total biomass intake rate in godwits and <b>Great</b> <b>Knots</b> from 2011 to 2012, despite similar numerical and biomass density of their main prey in both years. Finally, there was evidence that predation by shorebirds had a significant impact on the number of P. laevis in one of the years studied. My thesis showed the importance of Yalu Jiang coastal wetland to Bar-tailed Godwits and <b>Great</b> <b>Knots</b> during northward migration. These two species competed for the same bivalve prey and their coexistence in the years of study was enhanced by ample food resources rather than niche differentiation. The lack of young P. laevis recruitment in the final year of study and the significant predation impact detected indicated a potential decline in food resources after my study. Long-term monitoring will reveal how these species respond to the changes in prey availability. My study provided important scientific information on the numbers of birds using Yalu Jiang coastal wetland, their prey resource availability, their dietary compositions, and behaviours that are crucial for their conservation management in the reserve and potentially in other stopping sites in the Yellow Sea...|$|R
