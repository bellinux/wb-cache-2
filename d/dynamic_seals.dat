50|$|CDC films {{obtained}} by vacuum annealing (ESK) or chlorine treatment of SiC ceramics yield a low friction coefficient. The friction coefficient of SiC, which {{is widely used}} in tribological applications for its high mechanical strength and hardness, can therefore decrease from ~0.7 to ~0.2 or less under dry conditions. It’s important to mention that graphite cannot operate in dry environments. The porous 3-dimensional network of CDC allows for high ductility and an increased mechanical strength, minimizing fracture of the film under an applied force. Those coatings find applications in <b>dynamic</b> <b>seals.</b> The friction properties can be further tailored with high-temperature hydrogen annealing and subsequent hydrogen termination of dangling bonds.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} reduce the failure {{probability}} of rubber sealing rings in reciprocating <b>dynamic</b> <b>seal,</b> a new structure of sealing ring based on bionics was designed. The biomimetic ring has three concave ridges and convex bulges on each side which are very similar to earthworms. Bulges were circularly designed and sealing performances of the biomimetic ring in both static <b>seal</b> and <b>dynamic</b> <b>seal</b> were simulated by FEM. In addition, effects of precompression, medium pressure, speed, friction coefficient, and material parameters on sealing performances were discussed. The results show that von Mises stress of the biomimetic sealing ring distributed symmetrically in no-pressure static sealing. The maximum von Mises stress appears on the second bulge of the inner side. High contact stress concentrates on left bulges. Von Mises stress distribution becomes uneven under medium pressure. Both von Mises stress and contact stress increase when precompression, medium pressure, and rubber hardness increase in static sealing. Biomimetic ring can avoid rolling and distortion in reciprocating <b>dynamic</b> <b>seal,</b> and its working life is much longer than O-ring and rectangular ring.

5000|$|Inductive pumps {{use both}} sides of the piston to pump and suction simultaneously. This means that {{both sides of}} the pump piston are always {{experiencing}} the inlet pressure at a minimum until the pressure cycle that would exceed the inlet pressure. This may be interpreted as meaning the net head pressure in a close circuit, {{at the beginning of a}} stroke cycle, is always zero. Therefore, inductive pumps may be used in very high pressure closed circuits to circulate liquids at very low differential pressures. Essentially the inductive pump does not have to overcome the closed system pressure in order to move liquid in the system. This results in far less use of energy to move liquid with the circuit. This also provides additional circulation without any <b>dynamic</b> <b>seals</b> that could eventually leek to the outside of the system.|$|E

40|$|Flow {{chemistry}} is an emerging approach to chemical synthesis in which chemical processes are performed on reactants as they continuously flow through reactors. In order to drive such flows, low flow rate, high pressure pumps are used. The standard pump in use is the displacement pump. However, {{it tends to}} be expensive and produces a discontinuous flow. The goal of this investigation is to prototype a miniature multistage centrifugal pump and assess whether or not such pumps can perform in flow chemistry applications in the place of displacement pumps. This thesis explores the design features implemented in the development of this pump and how they contributed to its performance as pertaining to use in flow chemistry. Specifically, the pump was designed to be comprised of modularly stackable pump stages and to be thermochemically stable, operating without the use of <b>dynamic</b> <b>seals.</b> Ultimately, the device designed succeeded in being modularly stackable and in operating without <b>dynamic</b> <b>seals.</b> However, the target pressure rise per stage was not fully met. Moreover, testing of the pump revealed a high sensitivity in flow rate to changes in generated pressure head. Thus, it is not yet deemed a viable alternative to the current standard of displacement pumps. by Brian Yue. Thesis: S.

40|$|Two {{methods are}} studied for proving {{equivalence}} of programs involving {{two forms of}} information hiding.

Type abstraction is the most foundational form of information hiding in programming languages.

30|$|Reservoir {{compartmentalization}} is {{the segregation}} of petroleum accumulation {{into a number}} of individual fluid or pressure compartments by bounding features which prevent hydrocarbon crossflow (Caine et al. 1996). These features are seals and may be of two types: static seals which are capable of holding petroleum over geologic time and <b>dynamic</b> <b>seals</b> that are low to very low permeability flow baffles. <b>Dynamic</b> <b>seals</b> can reduce petroleum crossflow to infinitesimally slow rates, and allow fluids and pressures to equilibrate over geological timescales, but act as seals over production timescales (Jolley et al. 2010). Reservoir compartmentalizing features are also classified into tectonic, stratigraphic, or a combination of both, according their origin. Tectonic generated features include folds, faults, fractures, and diapirs (salt and shale), which confine hydrocarbon. Faults can separate reservoirs into compartments, particularly when a fault offset juxtaposes sandstone against shale or a significant amount of fault gouge within the fault zone during faulting. The industry’s knowledge of sealing potential of faults in the Niger Delta is mainly based on information about normal faults (Bretan et al. 2003). In general, the maximum seal capacity of a fault is directly proportional to the shale gouge ratio (SGR) and is inversely proportional to the net-to-gross (NTG) ratio of the faulted section (Smith 1980; Yielding et al. 1997; Bretan et al. 2003). Stratigraphic compartmentalizations are caused by stratigraphic heterogeneities and can be classified into microscopic (pore/grain-scale), mesoscopic (well-scale), and macroscopic (interwell-scale) heterogeneities (Krause et al. 1987) based on the types and scales of the heterogeneities. Interwell-scale heterogeneities include lateral bed discontinuity as a result of stratigraphic pinch-out and erosional cut-out.|$|E
