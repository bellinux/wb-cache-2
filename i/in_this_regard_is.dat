Due to its size and short arms it is unlikely that Zhenyuanlong was capable of powered flight (though the importance of biomechanical modelling <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>regard</b> <b>is</b> stressed), but it may suggest a relatively close descendance from flying ancestors, or even some capacity for gliding or wing-assisted incline running.|$|E

5|$|Syme {{argued that}} {{it was a mistake to}} regard it as a {{historical}} work at all and that no clear propaganda purpose could be determined. He theorized that the History is primarily a literary product – an exercise in satire produced by a 'rogue scholiast' catering to (and making fun of or parodying) the antiquarian tendencies of the Theodosian age, in which Suetonius and Marius Maximus were fashionable reading and Ammianus Marcellinus was producing sober history in the manner of Tacitus. (The History implausibly makes the Emperor Tacitus (275–276) a descendant and connoisseur of the historian). In fact in a passage on the Quadriga tyrannorum — the 'four-horse chariot of usurpers' said to have aspired to the purple in the reign of Probus — the History itself accuses Marius Maximus of being a producer of 'mythical history': homo omnium verbosissimus, qui et mythistoricis se voluminibis implicavit ('the most long-winded of men, who furthermore wrapped himself up in volumes of historical fiction'). The term mythistoricis occurs nowhere else in Latin. Of considerable significance <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>regard</b> <b>is</b> the opening section of the life of Aurelian, in which 'Flavius Vopiscus' records a supposed conversation he had with the City Prefect of Rome during the festival of Hilaria in which the Prefect urges him to write as he chooses and invent what he does not know.|$|E

See the article on rate–distortion theory for a mathematical explanation of this threshold effect.

However, many others point to the fact that Longbang had died before Luoneng was born, or when Luoneng was quite young. Combined with the fact that Luoneng only arrived at Dai territory as a traveling adult, others argue {{that it would have been}} impossible for him to have studied under Longbang, and suggest his teacher was actually Longbang's student, Guo Weihan.|$|E
25|$|Planetary {{habitability}} is {{the measure}} of a planet's or a natural satellite's potential to have habitable environments hospitable to life, or its ability to generate life endogenously. A planet in the habitable zone has no guarantee of actually being habitable, and habitable environments {{do not need to}} contain life. Life may develop directly on a planet or satellite or be transferred to it from another body, a hypothetical process known as panspermia. As the existence of life beyond Earth is unknown, planetary habitability is largely an extrapolation of conditions on Earth and the characteristics of the Sun and Solar System which appear favorable to life's flourishing—in particular those factors that have sustained complex, multicellular organisms and not just simpler, unicellular creatures.

Nothing is harder to play than virtue, and Pfeiffer is smart enough not to try. Instead, she embodies it.

500|$|The Sixth Amendment also {{regulates the}} {{availability}} and use of cause and peremptory challenges. For example, it precludes a jurisdiction from granting the prosecution for-cause removal of jurors who oppose the death penalty. [...] "The most that can be demanded of a venireman <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>regard</b> <b>is</b> that he be willing to consider all of the penalties provided by state law, and that he not be irrevocably committed, before the trial has begun, {{to vote against the}} penalty of death regardless of the facts and circumstances that might emerge {{in the course of the}} proceedings."

500|$|Despite {{efforts to}} step up {{maintenance}} efforts, on 8 October 2017, a poorly maintained float and pump system at Bishan Station caused a tunnel flood from a torrential rainstorm. It was the worst train disruption since 2011 and the first ever flooding incident in MRT history that lasted almost a day, disrupting services underground. This also resulted in further loss of public confidence and a huge debate among netizens and Singaporeans about the “high rankings” that manage the system, with calls being made for the resignation of Transport Minister Khaw Boon Wan. Urban transport expert Dr Park Byung Joon {{has said that the}} negligence displayed by SMRT <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>regard</b> <b>is</b> tantamount to a criminal offence, after an internal investigation found that the maintenance crew of the Bishan Station's pump system had submitted maintenance records for nearly a year without actually carrying out the works.|$|E
500|$|These {{physical}} variations {{create a}} distinctive set of playing conditions at each ballpark. Other local factors, such as altitude and climate, can also significantly affect play. A given stadium may acquire {{a reputation as}} a pitcher's park or a hitter's park, if one or the other discipline notably benefits from its unique mix of elements. The most exceptional park <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>regard</b> <b>is</b> Coors Field, home of the Colorado Rockies. Its high altitude— above sea level—is responsible for giving it the strongest hitter's park effect in the major leagues. Wrigley Field, home of the Chicago Cubs, is known for its fickle disposition: a hitter's park when the strong winds off Lake Michigan are blowing out, it becomes more of a pitcher's park when they are blowing in. The absence of a standardized field affects not only how particular games play out, but the nature of team rosters and players' statistical records. For example, hitting a fly ball [...] into right field might result in an easy catch on the warning track at one park, and a home run at another. A team that plays in a park with a relatively short right field, such as the New York Yankees, will tend to stock its roster with left-handed pull hitters, who can best exploit it. On the individual level, a player who spends most of his career with a team that plays in a hitter's park will gain an advantage in batting statistics over time—even more so if his talents are especially suited to the park.|$|E

500|$|However, {{at other}} times, Kyle is an {{enthusiastic}} participant in Cartman's schemes and Cartman is sometimes seen actually being nice to Kyle in some instances; {{although this is}} generally to put aside their hatred momentarily for a common goal, or for manipulation. Parker and Stone have compared the relationship to the one shared by Archie Bunker and Michael [...] "Meathead" [...] Stivic on the 1970s sitcom All in the Family. Kyle {{has a tendency to}} make what he thinks are safe bets with Cartman, and often loses these bets when the improbable actions promised by Cartman are accomplished. Cartman's motivation <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>regard</b> <b>is</b> not merely monetary gain, but an obsession with scoring a victory over Kyle, a fixation that ultimately plays a major part in a subplot to the three-part episode [...] "" [...] (season 11, 2007). This obsession has also proven itself to actually trump other goals Cartman wishes to achieve, for instance, in [...] "Christian Rock Hard" [...] Cartman makes a bet with Kyle that he can make a platinum album before Kyle can. After recruiting Butters and Token, Cartman creates a Christian rock band called [...] "Faith+1" [...] and [...] "writes" [...] Christian songs by merely taking love songs and replacing words such as [...] "baby" [...] with [...] "Jesus" [...] (which humorously implicates sexual relations with Jesus). Against all odds, the band becomes largely successful, managing to sell over a million copies (and potentially gain millions of dollars). However, since Christian rock bands cannot truly get a platinum album (which is not true in real life), Cartman loses the bet. Despite having amassed a large fan base as well as a large, steady income, Cartman only becomes enraged since he was unable to win a bet with Kyle. Careless in his anger accepting the [...] "Myrrh" [...] album in front of a large Christian crowd, Cartman goes into an Anti-Christian rant which drives away all of the fans as well as profits. Cartman has also been shown to have a high sadistic streak when concerning Kyle. He has repeatedly expressed desire in seeing him suffer.|$|E
