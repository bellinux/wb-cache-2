50|$|Most of GSM {{wireless}} modems {{come with}} an integrated SIM cardholder (i.e., Huawei E220, Sierra 881, etc.) and some models are also {{provided with a}} microSD memory slot and/or jack for additional external antenna such as Huawei E1762 and Sierra Wireless Compass 885. The CDMA (EVDO) versions do not use R-UIM cards, but use <b>Electronic</b> <b>Serial</b> <b>Number</b> (<b>ESN)</b> instead.|$|E
5000|$|It {{acts as a}} fake {{cell phone}} tower, and {{utilizes}} IMSI-catcher technology, which stands for [...] "international mobile subscriber identity". Phone networks use this system to identify an individual subscriber. The device emits a pilot signal made to appear stronger than that from the service provider cell tower, which forces all phones within its range to broadcast their IMSI number and <b>electronic</b> <b>serial</b> <b>number</b> (<b>ESN).</b> Encryption does not prevent this process. Furthermore, the devices can retrieve the encryption session keys for a cellphone {{in less than a}} second with success rates of 50 to 75% (in real world conditions)".|$|E
50|$|<b>Electronic</b> <b>serial</b> <b>numbers</b> (<b>ESNs)</b> {{were created}} by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to uniquely {{identify}} mobile devices, {{from the days of}} AMPS in the United States starting in the early 1980s. The administrative role was taken over by the Telecommunications Industry Association in 1997 and is still maintained by them. ESNs are currently mainly used with CDMA phones (and were previously used by AMPS and TDMA phones), compared to International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) numbers used by all GSM phones.|$|R
50|$|Analogue mobile {{telephones}} were notorious for {{their lack of}} security. Casual listeners easily heard conversations as plain narrowband FM; eavesdroppers with specialized equipment readily intercepted handset <b>Electronic</b> <b>Serial</b> <b>Numbers</b> (<b>ESN)</b> and Mobile Directory Numbers (MDN or CTN, the Cellular Telephone Number) over the air. The intercepted ESN/MDN pairs would be cloned onto another handset and used in other regions for making calls. Due to widespread fraud, some carriers required a PIN before making calls or used a system of radio fingerprinting to detect the clones.|$|R
50|$|Cellebrite {{claims the}} UFED {{has the ability}} to extract data from nearly 8200 devices as of June 2012. These include smartphones, PDA devices, cell phones, GPS devices and tablet computers. The UFED can extract, decrypt, parse and analyze phonebook contacts, all types of {{multimedia}} content, SMS and MMS messages, call logs, <b>electronic</b> <b>serial</b> <b>numbers</b> (<b>ESN),</b> International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) and SIM location information from both non-volatile memory and volatile storage alike. The UFED supports all cellular protocols including CDMA, GSM, IDEN, and TDMA, and can also interface with different operating systems' file systems such as iOS, Android OS, BlackBerry, Symbian, Windows Mobile and Palm as well as legacy and feature cell phones' operating systems.|$|R
50|$|Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) mobile {{telephone}} cloning involves {{gaining access to}} the device's embedded file system /nvm/num directory via specialized software or placing a modified EEPROM into the target {{mobile telephone}}, allowing the <b>Electronic</b> <b>serial</b> <b>number</b> (<b>ESN)</b> and/or Mobile Equipment Identifier (MEID) of the mobile phone to be changed. The ESN or MEID is typically transmitted to the cellular company's Mobile Telephone Switching Office (MTSO) in order to authenticate a device onto the mobile network. Modifying these, {{as well as the}} phone's Preferred Roaming List (PRL) and the mobile identification number, or MIN, can pave the way for fraudulent calls, as the target telephone is now a clone of the telephone from which the original ESN and MIN data were obtained.|$|E
50|$|A UIMID (user {{identity}} module identifier) is a 32-bit <b>Electronic</b> <b>Serial</b> <b>Number</b> (<b>ESN)</b> {{stored in}} a R-UIM or CSIM ('smart card') used for TDMA or CDMA2000 phones (mainly the latter). It is given a different name to avoid confusion with the hardware ESN stored in the phone. In all known systems the UIMID displaces the ESN in signaling (based on setting bit 1 of the 'UsgInd' field to '1' in the card). Because the UIMID is allocated from the same numbering space as ESN its existence is transparent to the network. The reason the UIMID is transmitted instead of the ESN is because the card contains the MIN or IMSI and devices such as the HLR running the ANSI-41 mobility management protocol insist on a static association between these identifiers for subscription validation. The HLR will store the MIN or IMSI alongside the ESN in each record, and if an ANSI-41 message is received containing a different pair it will be rejected as invalid.|$|E
40|$|Access (CDMA) mobile phones, no {{one could}} ever imagine a day would arise,when {{more than a billion}} mobile phones would be {{manufactured}} and used worldwide over a short span of time. Each mobilephone is required to have a unique serial number burned into its chips in order to prevent fraud. Without a unique number, the phone can't be sold. So initially in order to identify phones on a network, engineers developed a 32 -bit code called the <b>Electronic</b> <b>Serial</b> <b>Number</b> (<b>ESN).</b> This code was used for billing and to make sure the right call went to the right phone. But 32 bits only allowed 4 billion unique numbers; engineers probably didn't forecasted ESN to be a long-term solution. IfESNs ran out and there was no standard to replace them, manufacturers would literally have to shut down production of CDMA phones. Certainly a technology was required which could provide a long term solution to the current problem and bring about a change before ESNs were exhausted. Thuscamethe role of Mobile Equipment Identifier (MEID). This paper aims to present the need, role, future, issues and challenges CDMA phones face due to 32 bit ESN and how 56 bit MEID is going to rectify it...|$|E
50|$|Verizon Wireless {{disabled}} certain {{features on}} the V3m including the ability to transfer data files {{to and from the}} phone via Bluetooth (a specific protocol called OBEX). Verizon has also blocked the transfer of most data over USB, such as ringtones. These phones also run Binary Runtime Environment for Wireless (BREW), which signs each application to the phones <b>Electronic</b> <b>Serial</b> <b>Number,</b> or <b>ESN,</b> thus preventing the use of free applications (including Back Up Assistant). The equivalent models offered by competitors (such as the V3t by T-Mobile) still retain these features.|$|R

5000|$|In the 1990s an {{epidemic}} of [...] "cloning" [...] cost the cellular carriers millions of dollars. An eavesdropper with specialized equipment could intercept a handset's <b>ESN</b> (<b>Electronic</b> <b>Serial</b> <b>Number)</b> and MDN or CTN (Mobile Directory Number or Cellular Telephone <b>Number).</b> The <b>Electronic</b> <b>Serial</b> <b>Number,</b> a 12-digit number sent by the handset to the cellular system for billing purposes, uniquely identified that phone on the network. The system then allowed or disallowed calls and or features based on its customer file. A person intercepting an ESN/MDN pair could clone the combination onto a different phone and use it in other areas for making calls without paying.|$|R

40|$|Rochelle Municipal Utilities (RMU) was {{selected}} for the field evaluation site and placed an order for the first Mercury 50 generator set in November 1997. Field evaluation of the Mercury 50 package at Rochelle began in June 2000 and ran through December 2003. A total of 4, 749 package hours were achieved on two generation 2 -design engines. Engine <b>Serial</b> <b>Number</b> (<b>ESN)</b> 6 was installed in April 2000 and accumulated 2, 324 hours and 267 starts until it was exchanged for ESN 7 in April 2001. ESN 7 ran until completion of the field evaluation period accumulating 2, 426 hours and 292 starts. While the 4, 749 hours of package operation falls short of the 8, 000 -hour goal, important lessons were learned at the Rochelle site that resulted in bringing a far superior generation 3 Mercury 50 package to commercialization.

2500|$|At {{the heart}} of a Sirius {{receiver}} is a custom application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) chip called the Baseband Integrated Circuit currently the STA240, which is produced by STMicroelectronics. The chip contains embedded ARM7TDMI and ARM946E-S microprocessors synthesized from IP cores. Every baseband has a unique <b>Electronic</b> <b>Serial</b> <b>Number</b> (or Sirius ID). Another major section of a Sirius receiver is the tuner. The tuner is also a custom ASIC, the STA210. The tuner connects to the antenna, and receives the incoming satellite and terrestrial signals at 2.315GHz and downconverts them to intermediate frequency signals at around 75MHz. The strength of the signals is approximately −50dBm in clear-sky conditions. The IF signals are fed to the STA240, which are digitized, demodulated, error-corrected, de-interleaved, and decrypted using specialized circuits on the chip. The baseband processor utilizes a 16 MB SDRAM memory to buffer four seconds of one of the satellite signals in order to bring it into time coincidence with the other for Maximal-ratio combining. On newer receivers with a [...] "pause" [...] feature, a dual-port PSRAM is employed to store up to 60 minutes of the selected channel. The baseband processor outputs digital audio over a Serial Peripheral Interface, which is fed to a D/A converter to produce the analog audio signal. The front-end of a Sirius receiver is called the head unit, required to display descriptive text (such as the category, channel, artist, and song name) and provide controls to the user. This is implemented by the third-party designers of Sirius-ready receivers, using a microprocessor of their choice.|$|R
40|$|This study {{about the}} {{electronic}} journals listed in Electronic Publishing System of Journals in Rio Grande do Sul {{provides an overview}} of its situation about the extrinsic aspects such as periodicity, the existence of <b>electronic</b> International Standard <b>Serial</b> <b>Number,</b> Digital Object Identifier, editorial board, time of existence and presence in indexation mechanisms. The research aim was to investigate the situation of a periodic broadly, looking for the maintenance of quality of these productions, by the analysis of certain quality criteria. It is an applied research, exploratory, and as “way to approach”, the research is quantitative. The results showed that in the periodicity criterion, 37 of them are semiannual, but 21 of the total does not keep the established periodicity; in the criterion “presence of Digital Object Identifier”, it was found that no publication has it or reports it; about the presence of <b>electronic</b> International Standard <b>Serial</b> <b>Number,</b> 45 haven’t yet; about the indexing, 44 of them do not report if it is indexed or not; and 53 journals have an editorial committee structured and 16 do not have.
