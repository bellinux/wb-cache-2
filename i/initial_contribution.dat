After {{the family moved to}} Queensland he {{was commissioned}} as a second lieutenant in the Queensland Mounted Infantry in 1890, and saw service during the 1891 Australian shearers' strike. He became a regular officer in 1896, and went to the United Kingdom as part of the Queensland contingent for the 1897 Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria. In 1899 he commanded one of two companies of Queensland Mounted Infantry that were Queensland's <b>initial</b> <b>contribution</b> to the Boer War. After the war, he was closely involved with the training of the Australian Light Horse.|$|E

The <b>initial</b> <b>contribution</b> {{was also a}} modest one, consisting of just 2,058 personnel—codenamed Operation Falconer.

The Australian Special Forces Task Force was one of the first coalition units forces to cross the border into Iraq, while for a few days, the closest ground troops to Baghdad were from the SASR. During the invasion the RAAF also flew its first combat missions since the Vietnam War, with No. 75 Squadron flying a total of 350 sorties and dropping 122 laser-guided bombs.|$|E

No.37 Squadron was strengthened to create a [...] "super squadron" [...] on 17November 2006, when its force of twelve C-130Js was augmented by No.36 Squadron's twelve C-130Hs, prior to the latter re-equipping with Boeing C-17 Globemasters and relocating to RAAF Base Amberley, Queensland. Two of the C-130s joined DHC-4 Caribous from No.38 Squadron {{as part of the}} RAAF's <b>initial</b> <b>contribution</b> to Operation Papua New Guinea Assist following Cyclone Guba in November 2007. No.37 Squadron took over full responsibility for the Hercules detachment to the MEAO in mid-2008, and in March 2010 one of its C-130Js completed the detachment's 20,000th hour of flying operations. The squadron was transferred from No.86 Wing to No.84 Wing on 1October 2010, as part of a restructure of Air Lift Group. It was presented with the Gloucester Cup for its proficiency in 2011 at a ceremony on 31May 2012. The C-130Hs were retired the same year, the last pair at Richmond on 30November. In January 2013, No.37 Squadron undertook a successful search-and-rescue mission for Alain Delord, a missing round-the-world yachtsman who was found approximately [...] south of Tasmania.

2500|$|The essays {{contained}} in Nietzsche and Asian Thought were collected to illustrate both {{the influence that}} Asian (specifically, Indian) philosophy had on Nietzsche, and the influence that Nietzsche's thought subsequently had on Asian schools (in particular, Chinese and Japanese philosophy).

Further, only a very small portion of works written in Western languages on Nietzsche had addressed the response his works had provoked in Asia, especially Japan, after his death.

2500|$|The transpersonal {{psychology}} of Ken Wilber is often mentioned as an influential theoretical {{framework for the}} field. Wilber is often regarded as a leading theorist and pioneer of the transpersonal movement, {{but he has not}} been actively associated with the label for quite some time. Several commentators note that he has distanced himself from the transpersonal field in favour of a new model that he calls integral. However, his psychological model still remains [...] influential to the practice and development of transpersonal psychology, and transpersonal themes remain a central part of his own work. His <b>initial</b> <b>contribution</b> to the understanding of human development was a spectrum-model of psychology, originally outlined in his first books, The Spectrum of Consciousness (1977) and The Atman Project - A Transpersonal View of Human Development (1980). The books might superficially be described as a synthesis of east and west; an integration of the spiritual philosophies of Hindu-Buddhist traditions with the developmental and spiritual psychologies of western academia.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{becoming}} less common, direct and intentional killings by humans have occurred. On October 23, 2007 Lonnie W.

Skaggs re-entered the cave {{three days later}} and killed another 82 endangered Indiana bats. An investigation began when Carter Caves State Park employees discovered at least [...] The two men admitted to knowingly slaughtering an endangered species, using flashlights and rocks to knock hibernating bats off their roosts and smash their bodies with rocks. Bats that attempted to escape by flying away were knocked down from the air. The men stomped bats to death, bludgeoned them with flashlights, and crushed their bodies with rocks in several areas of the hibernaculum. BCI worked with the Kentucky Department of Fish & Wildlife Resources (KDFWR) to establish a reward fund and provided the <b>initial</b> <b>contribution.</b> The reward quickly grew to $5,000 {{with support from the}} Southeastern Bat Diversity Network and Defenders of Wildlife and was widely reported, and the two men were caught following an anonymous tip. This incident was called a [...] "senseless killing" [...] by James Gale, Special Agent-in-Charge for the USFWS Southeast Region, and resulted in conviction. They pleaded guilty to violating the federal Endangered Species Act. U.S. Magistrate Judge Edward Atkins sentenced Skaggs to eight-months in federal prison, and placed Carpenter on three years' probation. The case marks the first time nationwide that individuals were sentenced for killing endangered Indiana Bats. BCI thanked members and donors for allowing them to help protect these bats and work toward a time when such killings finally cease.|$|E
