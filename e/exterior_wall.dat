5|$|The Woodstock Neighborhood Association (WNA) {{originally}} {{made plans}} for a mural on the <b>exterior</b> <b>wall</b> of Lutz Tavern. Following an outreach effort to identify an artist, Lawrence and WNA met for a brainstorming session, during which they agreed on theme's for the proposed public artwork. Even after some funding was secured, efforts stalled. The association later proposed a mural for the nearby Red Fox Vintage building.|$|E
5|$|Archaeological {{excavations}} {{were done}} by ASI {{in part of}} the fort walls at its junction with the eastern wall of Qila Rai Pithora. The excavations revealed rough and small stones in the foundations followed by an ashlar face in the <b>exterior</b> <b>wall</b> above ground. The ASI is presently involved in conservation activities of the wall, providing railings, environmental improvements and lighting of the area, {{at a cost of}} Rs 15 lakhs (US$30,000).|$|E
5|$|Copper {{has been}} used since ancient times as a durable, {{corrosion}} resistant, and weatherproof architectural material. Roofs, flashings, rain gutters, downspouts, domes, spires, vaults, and doors have been made from copper for {{hundreds or thousands of}} years. Copper's architectural use has been expanded in modern times to include interior and <b>exterior</b> <b>wall</b> cladding, building expansion joints, radio frequency shielding, and antimicrobial and decorative indoor products such as attractive handrails, bathroom fixtures, and counter tops. Some of copper's other important benefits as an architectural material include low thermal movement, light weight, lightning protection, and recyclability.|$|E
40|$|Many {{types of}} {{insulated}} <b>exterior</b> <b>walls</b> {{are widely used}} in China. The selection of the most appropriate walls requires a simple method suitable for evaluating wall alternatives both as a design tool and a regulatory measure. In this paper, a method was proposed to assess cost-effectiveness of insulated <b>exterior</b> <b>walls</b> of residential buildings in cold climate. By considering energy savings, increased usable floor area, construction costs, insulation replacement and salvage values, the method calculated the main cost or benefit difference of using insulated <b>exterior</b> <b>walls</b> throughout a building lifecycle compared with the typical non-insulated solid clay brick walls, and subsequently defined a cost-effectiveness indicator (CEI) for measuring the overall cost efficiency of insulated <b>exterior</b> <b>walls.</b> The proposed method was applied to assessing insulated <b>exterior</b> <b>walls</b> of a residential building in Harbin, China. The application {{results show that the}} method can evaluate insulated <b>exterior</b> <b>walls</b> easily and properly, and enable designers and governors to assess different walls quickly.

50|$|Foundations: The {{interior}} {{supporting walls}} {{were made of}} brick without proper foundations, unlike the thick <b>exterior</b> sandstone <b>walls</b> supported on relatively deep and wide foundations. By 1948 the interior walls were settling significantly into the underlying clay soils and thin rubble base, causing them {{to pull away from}} the <b>exterior</b> <b>walls.</b> In time the <b>exterior</b> <b>walls</b> would have been pulled in and collapsed.|$|R
50|$|The <b>exterior</b> <b>walls</b> were paneled in 1760.|$|R
5|$|Upstream {{from the}} bridge is a grotto and bath house, built in a similar rustic style and presumably by the same architect. The bath house is a square vaulted chamber, with a plunge pool fed by river water. The upper chamber {{comprises}} a circular saloon with windows, although this is now roofless and in poor condition. The original roof was a conical thatched structure, and a niche on the <b>exterior</b> <b>wall</b> may have housed a statue.|$|E
5|$|A {{memorial}} to Ball, {{along with his}} parents, and a sister who died in infancy, appears on the <b>exterior</b> <b>wall</b> of {{the southwest corner of}} Holy Trinity Church in Lenton. Another memorial tablet is present inside the same church, mounted on the north wall and bearing the RFC and RAF motto Per Ardua ad Astra, along with decorations of medals and royal arms. In 1967, the Albert Ball VC Scholarships were instituted at his alma mater, Trent College. A propeller from one of Ball's aircraft and the original cross from his grave in France are displayed at the college's library and chapel, respectively. One of the houses at Nottingham High's Junior School is also named after Ball.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, {{city hall}} was {{partially}} destroyed. Along {{the northwest corner}} of the building, the <b>exterior</b> <b>wall</b> in its entirely collapsed, while the north tower was destroyed. The bay at the northeastern side of the building was removed. Additionally, the roof suffered complete destruction. As a result, Lake Worth was without a functional center for city government. A temporary city hall was established at the Lauriston building. Damage in Lake Worth reached approximately $4million. Three deaths occurred in Lake Worth, two from illnesses related to exposure to the storm; the other was a man who suffered from apoplexy, blamed on excessive exertion {{in the aftermath of the}} hurricane.|$|E
50|$|Buildings were {{constructed}} with the <b>exterior</b> <b>walls</b> {{of the building}} (bearing walls, typically masonry) supporting the load of the entire structure. The development and widespread use of structural steel and later reinforced concrete allowed relatively small columns to support large loads and the <b>exterior</b> <b>walls</b> of buildings were no longer required for structural support. The <b>exterior</b> <b>walls</b> could be non-load-bearing and thus much lighter and more open than the masonry load-bearing walls of the past. This gave way to increased use of glass as an exterior fa√ßade, and the modern-day curtain wall was born.|$|R
50|$|The {{farmhouse}} {{is built}} of local stone in random rubble, with a porch and gable ends of brick, and <b>exterior</b> <b>walls</b> in lime mortar. It {{is the only}} stone house of the 17th century in New England to survive with <b>exterior</b> <b>walls</b> intact. Floors and roof are timber framed, with major framing beams and joists set in pockets of the <b>exterior</b> <b>walls.</b> Molded bricks {{in a variety of}} shapes and fabrications embellish the entrance niche and arched openings. The original arched windows were replaced with smaller, Georgian windows By Nathaniel Tracy in the 18th century.|$|R
50|$|Some of the {{original}} <b>exterior</b> <b>walls</b> have been modified; for example, some of the brick <b>exterior</b> <b>walls</b> have been covered with cement plaster, while the western porch has {{been converted into a}} bay window in order to expand the interior space, although {{the original}} columns have been saved. The foundation is of limestone, carefully dressed. Like the <b>exterior</b> <b>walls,</b> most of the interior walls are brick, while some framing is yellow poplar with occasional pine floorboards in addition to the extensive ash on the floors and in the lintels.|$|R
5|$|Several {{other rooms}} {{neighbored}} the sanctuary. Many of these rooms {{were used to}} store ceremonial equipment, ritual texts, or temple valuables; others had specific ritual functions. The room where offerings {{were given to the}} deity was often separate from the sanctuary itself, and in temples without a barque in the sanctuary, there was a separate shrine to store the barque. In late temples the ritual areas could extend to chapels on the roof and crypts below the floor. Finally, in the <b>exterior</b> <b>wall</b> {{at the back of the}} temple, there were often niches for laymen to pray to the temple god, as close as they could come to its dwelling place.|$|E
5|$|The {{bell tower}} rises , and halfway up its length {{is a large}} round sign. The sign denotes the school district, Pine Rock, and {{the year of the}} school's foundation. Originally, the sign graced the front <b>exterior</b> <b>wall</b> of the larger of the two rooms. The tower rises above the roof by about fifteen feet and at its top are four arches, one on each side. Wooden {{construction}} is found throughout the tower, its arches, {{and the rest of the}} schoolhouse, save the limestone and cement foundation. At the bottom of each of the four arches are balustrades decorated with spindles. Inside the tower is the school bell. The bell house is topped with a multi-gabled roof. The roof of the overall schoolhouse is covered with cedar shingles and features chimneys rising from each of the classrooms.|$|E
5|$|On {{the north}} side of the bailey are the remains of the Norman chapel, which {{comprised}} a nave, a square tower and an apsidal chancel, 12.7 metres by 6 metres (42ft by 20ft), 4 metres square (13ft square) and 4.6 metres by 4 metres (15ft by 13ft) respectively. It was built from local grey sandstone, and Roman tiles from one of the nearby villas were used to construct its roof and incorporated into the walls. Originally the tower would have had a church bell, and the casting pit for this is buried under the floor of the nave. A stone bench runs around the base of the walls, and in the 19th century there was also a stone base for a font in the nave, but this has since been lost. A piece of early medieval graffiti, possibly depicting a Norman soldier, has survived on the south <b>exterior</b> <b>wall.</b> A fireplace was added to the chapel during the Tudor period, although this was only in use for a few years before being abandoned.|$|E

5|$|The IRA {{immediately}} began {{making plans to}} break Twomey, O'Hagan and Mallon out of the prison. The first attempt involved explosives that had been smuggled into the prison, which were {{to be used to}} blow a hole in a door which would give the prisoners access to the exercise yard. From there, they would scale a rope ladder thrown over the <b>exterior</b> <b>wall</b> by members of the IRA's Dublin Brigade who would have a getaway car waiting to complete the escape. The plan failed when the prisoners could not gain access to the exercise yard and the rope ladder was spotted, so the IRA began making new escape plans. The idea of using a helicopter in an escape had been discussed before, an idea to break Gerry Adams out of Long Kesh internment camp had been ruled out because of faster and more sophisticated British Army helicopters being stationed at a nearby base. The IRA's GHQ staff approved the plan to break out Twomey, O'Hagan and Mallon, and arrangements were made to obtain a helicopter. A man with an American accent calling himself Mr. Leonard approached the manager of Irish Helicopters at Dublin Airport, with a view to hiring a helicopter for an aerial photographic shoot in County Laois. After being shown the company's fleet of helicopters, Leonard arranged to hire a five-seater Alouette II for 31 October.|$|E
5|$|Among the {{buildings}} extant {{at the royal}} city {{during the time of}} King Andrianampoinimerina (1787‚Äì1810), only the original Mahandrihono palace remains intact. The Mahandrihono palace, which served as the home of Andrianampoinimerina before he relocated the political capital of Imerina to Antananarivo, has been preserved in its original state since construction, excepting the replacement of the original roof thatch with wooden shingles. The simple wooden structure is constructed in the traditional style of the aristocracy of Imerina: the walls are made of solid rosewood and topped by a peaked roof that is supported by 10-meter central rosewood pillar, much like the one that had originally supported the roof of the Rova Manjakamiadana of Antananarivo before it was destroyed by fire in 1995. The roof horns (tandrotrano) formed {{at each end of the}} roof peak by the crossing of the gable beams were originally silver-plated, and a silver eagle was affixed in the middle of the roof peak. Silver ornaments were also hung from the corners of the roof in the interior of the house. The building's name is inscribed on a white marble plaque affixed to an <b>exterior</b> <b>wall</b> near one of the building's two entrances. This house contains a number of items that belonged to Andrianampoinimerina, including weapons, drums, talismans and a bed raised on stilts. During Andrianampoinimerina's time, his wives were allowed to visit this building but not allowed to sleep there overnight. The site is highly sacred: Queen Rasoherina and her successors often sat on the stepping stone at its threshold to address their audience, and many pilgrims come here to connect with the spirits of Andrianampoinimerina and his ancestors. Visitors are asked to enter the house by stepping in with their right foot and exiting backwards, according to custom, in order to show respect for the spirit of Andrianampoinimerina.|$|E
5|$|The temple is {{enclosed}} in the cave, it has interior walls but no <b>exterior</b> <b>wall.</b> The pillars create {{the space and}} symmetric rhythm as they support the weight of hill above. The main mandapa recesses into a pillared vestibule (ardha-mandapa) on the south side, while a pillared portico (mukha-mandapa) connects it to the main entrance. Embedded within the Great Cave are dedicated shrines, the largest {{of which is the}} square plan Linga shrine (see 16 in plan). It is a square garbha-griya (womb house) with four entrances, located in the right section of the main hall. Steps lead from the four doorways into the sanctum, which has a linga in the mulavigraha style. Each doorway is guarded by a dvarapala on each side, for a total of eight dvarapalas, their heights spanning floor to the ceiling. These were badly damaged when the Portuguese ceded control of this region to the British. The linga shrine is surrounded by a mandapa and circumambulation path (pradakshina-patha) as in other Hindu temples. The pillars are similarly aligned east-west to this shrine, and have an east entrance. Overlaid, as if fused, on the architecture of this temple is another open temple aligned to the north-south direction with three faced Sadashiva as its focal center. One features the abstract, unmanifest, aniconic symbol of Shiva, the other anthropomorphic, manifest, iconic symbol of Shiva. The mandapa pillars of the two align up.|$|E

25|$|Each {{receiver}} must {{be connected}} to an external antenna, which is included with the receiver. Antenna placement is crucial to receiving a clear signal. In some locations users have experienced difficulty receiving the Sirius programming because the signal is not consistently strong. For best reception, antennas should be placed such {{that they have an}} unobstructed view of the sky (preferably on rooftops without overhanging eaves or trees). If this is not an option, the antenna should be placed on an <b>exterior</b> <b>wall.</b> When placing on an <b>exterior</b> <b>wall,</b> the antenna should be mounted to a wall which faces the center of the continental United States in order to minimize the likelihood of the building itself blocking the signal.|$|E
