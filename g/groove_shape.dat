5000|$|An echelle grating (from French, échelle, meaning ladder) {{is a type}} of {{diffraction}} grating characterised by a relatively low groove density, but a <b>groove</b> <b>shape</b> which is optimized for use at high incidence angles and therefore in high diffraction orders. Higher diffraction orders allow for increased dispersion (spacing) of spectral features at the detector, enabling increased differentiation of these features. Echelle gratings are, like other types of {{diffraction grating}}s, used in spectrometers and similar instruments. They are most useful in cross-dispersed high resolution spectrographs, such as HARPS, PARAS (PRL Advanced Radial Velocity Abu Sky Search) and numerous other astronomical instruments.|$|E

As the {{necessary}} information for planning tool path, or determining {{the parameters of}} machining processes, the <b>groove</b> <b>shape</b> of impellers should be extracted exactly. A Z-map based approach is proposed to extract the <b>groove</b> <b>shape</b> of the impeller, which is formed by hub and blades in STL models. The bottom boundaries of the groove surface are computed with its Z-map models and the polygons of the groove surface are selected with the boundaries. An experimental system is implemented and some computational experiments are performed to verify the practical applicability of the approach...|$|E
40|$|The bicipital groove of the {{proximal}} humerus is {{formed by the}} medial and lateral tuberosities and serves to retain the long biceps tendon in its proper place as the arm moves. Bicipital root and proximal tendon disorders are an important symptom generator in the shoulder. The accuracy of the diagnosis of many shoulder disorders visually without quantitative shape analysis is limited, motivating a clinical need for some ancillary method to assess {{the proximal}} biceps. In previous studies, measurements of bicipital <b>groove</b> <b>shape</b> were 2 -dimensional (2 D), taken from a single axial slice. Because of significant variations in <b>groove</b> <b>shape</b> from one axial slice to another in a single patient, such approaches risk overlooking shape features important to long biceps tendon pathology. In this paper, we present {{a study of the}} relationship between bicipital <b>groove</b> <b>shape</b> and long biceps tendon pathology using a novel 3 -dimensional (3 D) shape descriptor for the bicipital groove. In addition to providing quantitative measures of the shape of the groove and its relation to tendopathy, the new descriptor allows for intuitive, descriptive visualization of the shape of the groove...|$|E

The radial load capacity of the bearing using the rl. 1 inner ring was improved 150 % over {{the capacity of the}} bearing using the r 1. 0 inner ring.

40|$|Abstract: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the head losses in several type metal body disc filters manufactured by domestic companies. In order to meet the objective, three different filter designs (L, LT and Y type), each at four different inlet and outlet pipe diameters, were used to measure the head losses at different flow rates in the laboratory. A total of sixteen filters manufactured by three domestic companies (A, B and C) and two different disc elements (linear and curly) were taken into consideration in this study. A comparison of the different filter designs in terms of measured the head losses indicated that in all cases while the L type filters gave the highest head loss, the other two designs provided less head losses at the same flow rate. Furthermore, the head losses in C−LT type filters with curly <b>groove</b> <b>shape</b> discs were less than B−LT type filters with linear <b>groove</b> <b>shape</b> discs in comparing with the LT type filters produced by two different manufacturers even though the design and the size of the filter body were similar. The differences in the head loss can be clarified with the help of the results obtained from the structural characteristic of filtering elements. As a result, in drip irrigation systems, the use of Y and LT type disc filters with curly groove shaped discs are recommended in order to obtain less head losses and low energy requirements when compared with filters used in this study.
