5|$|Hoover was {{defeated}} for re-election by Roosevelt in the 1932 presidential election. Roosevelt {{was convinced that}} federal activism was needed to reverse the country's economic decline. In his first hundred days in office, the Congress enacted at Roosevelt's request a series of bills designed to strengthen the banking system, including the Emergency Banking Act, the Glass–Steagall Act (which created the <b>Federal</b> <b>Deposit</b> <b>Insurance</b> Corporation), and the 1933 Banking Act. The Congress also passed the Agricultural Adjustment Act to stabilize the nation's agricultural industry.|$|E

5|$|In 1990, facing {{financial}} collapse, Bain & Company asked Romney to return. Announced as its new CEO in January 1991, he drew {{a symbolic}} salary of one dollar (remaining managing general partner of Bain Capital during this time). He oversaw an effort to restructure Bain & Company's employee stock-ownership plan and real-estate deals, while rallying the firm's one thousand employees, imposing a new governing structure that excluded Bain and the other founding partners from control, and increasing fiscal transparency. He got Bain and other initial owners who had removed excessive amounts of money from the firm to return substantial amounts, and persuaded creditors, including the <b>Federal</b> <b>Deposit</b> <b>Insurance</b> Corporation, to accept less than full payment. Within about a year, he had led Bain & Company to a return to profitability. He turned Bain & Company over to new leadership and returned to Bain Capital in December 1992.|$|E
5|$|The National Bureau of Economic Research dates recessions on {{a monthly}} basis back to 1854; {{according}} to their chronology, from 1854 to 1919, there were 16 cycles. The average recession lasted 22 months, and the average expansion 27. From 1919 to 1945, there were six cycles; recessions lasted an average 18 months and expansions for 35. From 1945 to 2001, and 10 cycles, recessions lasted an average 10 months and expansions an average of 57 months. This has prompted some economists to declare that the business cycle has become less severe. Factors that may have contributed to this moderation include the creation of a central bank and lender of last resort, like the Federal Reserve System in 1913, the establishment of deposit insurance {{in the form of the}} <b>Federal</b> <b>Deposit</b> <b>Insurance</b> Corporation in 1933, increased regulation of the banking sector, the adoption of interventionist Keynesian economics, and the increase in automatic stabilizers in the form of government programs (unemployment insurance, social security, and later Medicare and Medicaid).

Additionally, according to emails uncovered by the Oversight investigation, Mark Pearce (former CRL president and current director of FDIC’s Division of Depositor and Consumer Protection), was exploring ways for FDIC to “get at payday lending.” The report found Pearce used his position to push for stringent regulations on the payday lending industry. [...] CRL praised efforts by Operation Choke Point to increase regulations on payday lenders.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} how international depositors respond to national <b>deposit</b> <b>insurance</b> policies.

The sensitivity of non-bank <b>deposits</b> to <b>deposit</b> <b>insurance</b> policies opens up the possibility of international regulatory competition in this area. The EU directive on <b>deposit</b> <b>insurance</b> imposes minimum standards on national <b>deposit</b> <b>insurance</b> policies.

40|$|Losses may {{accrue to}} depositors at {{insolvent}} banks both at {{and after the}} time of official resolution. Losses at resolution occur because of poor closure rules and regulatory forbearance. Losses after resolution occur if depositors'' access to their claims is delayed or "frozen.

This paper examines the causes of delayed depositors'' access to their funds at resolved banks, describes how the FDIC provides immediate access, reports on a special survey of access practices in other countries, and analyzes {{the costs and benefits}} of delayed access in terms of both the effects on market discipline and depositor pressure to protect all deposits.
