40|$|This study {{provides}} empirical {{evidence on the}} relative performances of <b>Foreign</b> <b>Controlled</b> Domestic Companies operating in the United Kingdom as compared to those of United Kingdom Controlled Domestic Dompanies. One hundred and fifty (150) <b>Foreign</b> <b>Controlled</b> Domestic Companies, selected from the Times 1000 (1995), were matched with 150 United Kingdom Domestic Companies on the bases of size and industry. The reported performance data of the two sub samples for five years were extracted from the FT Extel secured database. Statistical tests were then carried out, on five year average and annual bases, to establish whether there were differences in the performances {{of the two groups}} of firms. Results revealed statistically significant differences in the reported performances of <b>Foreign</b> <b>Controlled</b> Domestic Companies and United Kingdom Domestic Companies operating in the United Kingdom over the five year period. <b>Foreign</b> <b>controlled</b> firms significantly under performed United Kingdom Domestic Companies of comparable size and industry. The lower profitability figures reported by these firms were {{partly as a result of}} higher trading expenses. The study also found differences in the year to year magnitude of under performance by <b>Foreign</b> <b>Controlled</b> Domestic Companies. While findings in this study corroborate those of earlier United States based studies, the management and owners of <b>Foreign</b> <b>Controlled</b> Domestic Companies’ parents should be interested in the apparent underperformance of their United Kingdom based assets. It is possible, however, that the figures reported do not reflect real asset performance. In which case, the United Kingdom tax authorities may want to take a closer look at <b>Foreign</b> <b>Controlled</b> Domestic Ccompanies’ reported performances to establish whether they are the outcome of income shifting practices. Future studies could examine how the performances of the managers of these foreign located assets are evaluated and rewarded and explore other possible explanatory factors for their reported under performance...|$|R
40|$|The article {{analyzes}} infl ux {{of foreign}} direct investment into the Czech Republic from the territorial {{point of view and}} partly from the perspective of receiving branches. However, it is primarily focused on impacts of this infl ux, i. e. creation of an institutional sub-sector of <b>foreign</b> <b>controlled</b> companies. They operate mainlyin the sector of non-fi nancial corporations and dominate in sector of fi nancial institutions in the Czech Republic. This analysis is concentrated on the weight of <b>foreign</b> <b>controlled</b> companies on the performance and income characteristics of these two sectors and Czech economy as a whole, as well. Development of output, intermediate consumption and gross value added is used for non-financial <b>foreign</b> <b>controlled</b> companies as the performance characteristics and then profi ts and paid-out wages as the income characteristics. Problem oftaxes paid by these companies to the state budget is mentioned and development of their investment in fixed assets, as well. Financial <b>foreign</b> <b>controlled</b> companies are viewed in terms of their proportion of total assets, loans and deposits, capital and reserves and capital adequacy ratio. Finally, impact of {{foreign direct investment}} on employment and gross value added in branches of economy is analyzed and double-tracking in industry is identified. Conclusion summarizes benefits and negative effects of the <b>foreign</b> <b>controlled</b> companies in the Czech Republic within their existing presence in 1995 – 2009...|$|R

This trilogy comprises three novels: Viento fuerte (Strong Wind; 1950), El Papa Verde (The Green Pope; 1954), and Los ojos de los enterrados (The Eyes of the Interred; 1960). It is a fictional account {{of the results of}} <b>foreign</b> <b>control</b> over the Central American banana industry.

40|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} to explore the myth that <b>foreign</b> <b>controlled</b> banks were supposed to be more profitable and efficient than local controlled ones. Two out of three financial indicators, understudy, pointed out that the overall performance of the foreign commercial banks, operating in Pakistan, was 24. 44 % better than the local controlled banks.      At the end of Year 2007, <b>foreign</b> investors were <b>controlling</b> 58. 22 % of the outstanding shares in the commercial banks, in Pakistan,. Despite the fact that 40 % of the <b>foreign</b> <b>controlled</b> commercial banks were running into deficit, the bank and the capital efficiency of the <b>foreign</b> <b>controlled</b> banks running into profit was better than locally controlled commercial banks. CEOs & directors are having substantial control on the financial affairs of the banks and have a direct relationship with the earning per share and bank efficiency but less control on the profit before tax.

40|$|Under profit-based {{transfer}} pricing methods, {{the selection of}} comparable companies is essential if detection of transfer price manipulation is to be reliable. Comparative advantage as embedded in internalisation theory argues that <b>foreign</b> <b>controlled</b> companies should, in the long run, display greater profitability than domestic controlled companies. In high tax host countries {{transfer pricing}} manipulation theory predicts an opposite effect on profitability. Applying a refined set of tests to a large sample of firms operating in a high tax country such as Italy offers {{strong support for the}} internalisation prediction. Furthermore, the analysis of the inter-quartile range of our measure of profitability indicates that only a low percentage of <b>foreign</b> <b>controlled</b> companies would be subject to fiscal enquires, as implied by the OECD guidelines, under the suspicious of transfer pricing manipulation. These results suggest that current comparability tests are likely to fail the identification of transfer pricing practices in countries where the comparative advantage of <b>foreign</b> <b>controlled</b> companies is particularly pronounced and question the reliability of these tests...|$|R
5000|$|The Division of <b>Foreign</b> Assets <b>Control,</b> the {{immediate}} predecessor to OFAC, {{was established in}} December 1950. Predecessor agencies of the Division of <b>Foreign</b> Assets <b>Control</b> include <b>Foreign</b> Funds <b>Control,</b> which existed from 1940 to 1947, and the Office of International Finance (1947 to 1950). OFAC's earliest predecessor, <b>Foreign</b> Funds <b>Control,</b> was established by Executive Order 8389 as {{a unit of the}} Office of the Secretary of the Treasury on April 10, 1940. The authority to establish <b>Foreign</b> Funds <b>Control</b> was derived from the Trading with the Enemy Act 1917. Among other operations, <b>Foreign</b> Funds <b>Control</b> administered wartime import controls over enemy assets and restrictions on trade with enemy states. It also participated in administering the Proclaimed List of Certain Blocked Nationals, or the [...] "Black List", and took censuses of foreign-owned assets in the United States and American-owned assets abroad. <b>Foreign</b> Funds <b>Control</b> was abolished in 1947, with its functions transferred to the newly established Office of International Finance (OIF).

Christianity apparently gained its strongest foothold in the ancient center of Semitic civilization in South-west Arabia or Yemen, (sometimes known as Seba or Sheba, whose queen visited Solomon). Because of geographic proximity, acculturation with Ethiopia was always strong, and the royal family traces its ancestry to this queen.|$|E
