5|$|In {{the first}} Rurouni Kenshin kanzenban, {{published}} in Japan in July 2006, Watsuki included a draft page featuring a redesign of Kenshin's character. To make his X-shaped scar more notable, Watsuki made <b>it</b> <b>long</b> <b>enough</b> to cross his nose. Kenshin's hair is tied in two tails, which are flowing {{to make him}} look younger, and shorter, and less androgynous. Watsuki also added a Habaki to Kenshin's sword {{to make it easier to}} draw by simplifying its structure, while also emphasizing strength. Kenshin's hitokiri look was also redesigned slightly, by making his clothes more worn and giving him Yukishiro Tomoe's neck scarf.|$|E
500|$|Jackson {{released}} her fourth album, Rhythm Nation 1814, in September 1989. Although her record label desired a direct sequel to Control, Jackson chose {{to include a}} socially conscious theme among various musical styles. She stated, [...] "I know an album or a song can't change the world. I just want my music and my dance to catch the audience's attention, and to hold <b>it</b> <b>long</b> <b>enough</b> for them {{to listen to the}} lyrics." [...] The album's central theme of unity was developed in response to various crimes and tragedies reported in the media.|$|E
500|$|As the Polish–Soviet War grew in intensity, in late April 1920 the Red Army of Russia's new Soviet regime {{pushed back}} Polish forces and invaded Poland. Subsequently Sikorski {{successfully}} defended Mozyr and Kalenkowicze until 29 June, but later failed {{to hold the}} Brest fortress, although he defended <b>it</b> <b>long</b> <b>enough</b> to allow the Polish forces {{in the region to}} retreat in an orderly manner. On 6 August he was named the commander of the newly formed Polish 5th Army, which was tasked with holding the front to the north of Modlin, between Narew and Wkra rivers. He distinguished himself commanding the 5th Army on the Lower Vistula front during the Battle of Warsaw. At that time Soviet forces, expecting an easy final victory, were surprised and crippled by the Polish counter-attack. During that battle (sometimes referred to as [...] "the Miracle at the Vistula") Sikorski stopped the Bolshevik advance north of Warsaw and gave Piłsudski, the Polish commander-in-chief, the time he needed for his counter-offensive; beginning with the 15 August his forces successfully engaged the Soviet 5th and 15th Armies. After the Battle of Warsaw, from 30 August, Sikorski commanded the 3rd Army. His forces took Pińsk, and fought during the latter stages of the Battle of Lwów and the Battle of Zamość, and then after Battle of Niemen advanced with his forces toward Latvia and deep into Belarus. The Poles defeated the Soviets, and the Polish–Soviet Treaty of Riga (March 1921) gave Poland substantial areas of Belarus and Ukraine's (Kresy). Sikorski's fame was enhanced as he became known to the Polish public as one of the heroes of the Polish–Soviet War. He also kept publishing military science articles during the war itself. For his valorous achievements Sikorski was promoted to divisional general on 28 February 1921, and was awarded Poland's highest military decoration, the order of Virtuti Militari, on 15 March that year.|$|E

2500|$|Compute!'s Apple Applications in 1987 {{stated that}} HyperCard [...] "may make Macintosh the {{personal}} computer of choice". While noting that its large memory requirement made it best suited for computers with 2MB of memory and hard drives, the magazine predicted that [...] "the smallest programming shop {{should be able to}} turn out stackware", especially for using CD-ROMs. Compute! predicted in 1988 that most future Mac software would be developed using HyperCard, if only because using it was so addictive that developers [...] "won't be able to tear themselves away from <b>it</b> <b>long</b> <b>enough</b> to create anything else". Byte in 1989 listed it as among the [...] "Excellence" [...] winners of the Byte Awards. While stating that [...] "like any first entry, it has some flaws", the magazine wrote that [...] "HyperCard opened up a new category of software", and praised Apple for bundling it with every Mac. In 2001 Steve Wozniak called HyperCard [...] "the best program ever written".|$|E
2500|$|Several reviewers compare Berg's telling unfavorably to John M. Cooper's. From the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette: [...] "He brings {{nothing new}} to the {{conventional}} evaluation of Wilson the president (for the best treatment, read John M. Cooper's 2009 [...] "Woodrow Wilson")."Publishers Weekly also makes this comparison: [...] "This won’t replace John Milton Cooper Jr.’s superb 2009 biography..." [...] Bob Blaisdell writing for The Christian Science Monitor goes further: [...] "He (Berg) lacks what Cooper repeatedly credits Wilson with having: boldness" [...] and [...] "Given a choice of reading, take Cooper’s fine and authoritative [...] "Woodrow Wilson: A Biography," [...] which is still in print." [...] Jill Lepore writes [...] "A sharp, subtle, and more squarely political biography is Woodrow Wilson by American historian John M. Cooper. When asked about Cooper's book, Berg admitted he had not read it, but did glance at <b>it</b> <b>long</b> <b>enough</b> {{to ensure that the}} two books began and finished differently.|$|E
2500|$|Tyrande Whisperwind, {{leader of}} the Night Elves, is outraged to find the Humans and Orcs violating the forests and blames them for Cenarius' death, so she {{initially}} vows to destroy both. However, she soon finds out that the Burning Legion has arrived on Kalimdor. In order to oppose the Burning Legion, Tyrande reawakens the sleeping Elf Druids, starting with her lover, Malfurion Stormrage, and frees his brother Illidan Stormrage from prison, against Malfurion's will.

[...] The Humans, Orcs, and Night Elves form a reluctant alliance to spring a trap on the Burning Legion, and delay <b>it</b> <b>long</b> <b>enough</b> for many ancestral spirits to destroy Archimonde at Mount Hyjal.
