5|$|Millet cultivation: The {{discovery}} in northern China of domesticated varieties of broomcorn and <b>foxtail</b> <b>millet</b> from 8500 BC, or earlier, suggests that millet cultivation might have predated that of rice {{in parts of}} Asia. Clear evidence of millet began to cultivate by 6500 BC at sites of Cishan, Peiligang and Jiahu. Archaeological remains from Cishan sum up to over 300 storage pits, 80 with millet remains, with a total millet storage capacity estimated for the site of about 100,000kg of grain. By 4000 BC, most Yangshao areas were using an intensive form of <b>foxtail</b> <b>millet</b> cultivation, complete with storage pits and finely prepared tools for digging and harvesting the crop. The success of the early Chinese millet farmers is still reflected today in the DNA of many modern East Asian populations, such {{studies have shown that}} the ancestors of those farmers probably arrived in the area between 30,000 and 20,000 BP, and their bacterial haplotypes are still found in today populations throughout East Asia.|$|E

5|$|The {{most common}} {{agricultural}} food staples during Han were wheat, barley, rice, <b>foxtail</b> <b>millet,</b> proso millet, and beans. People of the Han also consumed sorghum, Job's tears, taro, mallow, mustard green, melon, bottle gourd, bamboo shoot, {{the roots of}} lotus plants, and ginger. Some of the fruits the Han ate included the chestnut, jujube, pear, peach, plum (including the plum of Prunus salicina and Prunus mume), melon, apricot, red bayberry, and strawberry. The Han Chinese domesticated and ate chickens, Mandarin ducks, geese, camels, cows, sheep, pigs, and dogs. The type of game animals hunted during the Han included rabbit, sika deer, turtle dove, goose, owl, Chinese bamboo partridge, magpie, common pheasant, and cranes, while fish and turtles were taken from streams and lakes. Beer—which could be an unfermented malt drink with low alcohol content or a stronger brew fermented with yeast—was commonly consumed alongside meat, but virtually never consumed alongside grains such as rice. Wine was also regularly consumed.|$|E

40|$|Prehistoric groundstone tools {{including}} slabs (metate, mo-pan) and mullers (mano, mo-bang) {{are often}} {{considered to be}} tools {{that were used to}} process cereals in ancient China. Most archaeologists believe that groundstone tools are indicators of an agrarian economy. This study employed starch grain analysis to examine a slab and a muller excavated from the Shangzhai Site (7500 - 7000 cal a BP), Beijing. Identifiable starch grains recovered from the stone tools were classified into 9 genera and 12 species, most of which were from acorns and <b>foxtail</b> <b>millets.</b> Remains from the oak species Q. mongolicus, Q. acuttssima, and Q. dentate were identified as well as a few starch grains from broomcorn (Panicum miliaseum) and bean (Vigna sp.). Other starch grains were from unidentifiable roots and grasses. A variety of starch grains indicates that the grinding stone tools were used to process not only cereals, but also other seeds or roots that had to be ground or husked, thus bringing into question the aforementioned cereal hypothesis. Because the numbers of starch grains from nuts and millets were so large, both gathering and cultivation might have been important economic patterns before 7000 years ago in Beijing area. Moreover, the starch remains are derived from plants that indicate that the paleoclimate of Beijing was wetter and warmer than today's. © Science in China Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH 2009...|$|R

50|$|During the winter, the longspur {{feeds on}} seeds. They pick {{them on the}} ground, rarely feeding {{directly}} on plants. They will forage around the same area for a period varying between {{a few minutes and}} an hour, then fly away looking for a new foraging area. Their seed diet is composed mainly of seeds from grass, <b>foxtail,</b> cultivated <b>millet,</b> crabgrass and wheat. During the breeding season, the birds migrate to the north, where their diet switches to arthropods. Nestlings are only fed arthropods, which also constitute the diet of the parents at that time of the year (June to July). The birds often catch insects in mid-air, but do forage through vegetation when climatic conditions prevent the insects from flying. Longspurs can consume between 3000 and 10,000 prey items (insects or seeds) per day, depending on their energy needs. Dipteran larvae and adults form the major part of their insectivorous diet.|$|R

30|$|In {{addition}} to potential coastal spread from Fujian or Taiwan, {{there appears to}} be the spread of upland rain-fed rice and <b>foxtail</b> <b>millets</b> through the hills of south China (Guangdong, Guangxi) and into the upland zones of Southeast Asia, perhaps 2500 to 2000 BC (Castillo and Fuller 2010; Castillo 2011), ultimately from the Daxi-Qiujialing tradition of the middle Yangtze (Figs.  5, 6 and 7). In some regions, hinted at by recent archaeobotanical evidence from central Thailand (Weber et al. 2010), rice may have been abandoned for a focus on millets, with rice only becoming important again later on, as social complexity increased (see Castillo 2011). Whether this early spread included some early Austroasiatic speakers (AA) is unclear, but as suggested by Blench (2005) much of their shared vocabulary points to a hill cultivation and swidden culture, in which taro (Colocasia esculenta) would have been present alongside rice. This would seem at odds with the notion that they spread mainly along rivers (as per Higham 2003), but it may be that there were several different waves of Austroasiatic with a rice–millet wave overlying an earlier vegecultural wave, which might help to account for their widespread diversity. Might we also see some early Tai-Kadai speakers in this area? It is presumably to this period that western Austroasiatics, as pre-Proto-Munda speakers (the westward AA arrow in Fig.  7), also focused on islands of hill forest habitat and shifting cultivation moved into India towards the hills of Orissa (Fuller 2003). Once into areas near the Indian peninsula (perhaps broadly around 2000 BC or the centuries after), these farmers picked up native Indian millets and pulses and domesticated sheep, goat and zebu, in some cases apparently with connected early Dravidian vocabulary. At this time the plains were already occupied by more intensive, and probably denser, rice farmers. The potential role of a distinct domestication of aus rices connected to {{all or part of the}} Austroasiatic expansion needs research. The genetic evidence of McNally et al. (2009) indicates that aus genomes have seen substantial hybridization both with japonica and indica rice, which hints at a complex history of dispersal and cultural interactions involved in the spread of rice within and through the greater Bengal–Assam–Burma region.|$|R
30|$|Millet agriculturalists (and {{possibly}} earlier hunter–gatherer populations) on the peripheries of the Sichuan Basin {{played an}} important role in the spread of agriculture into Southwest China. Both <b>foxtail</b> and broomcorn <b>millet</b> have short growing seasons, are arid adapted, and can survive in a wide array of climatic conditions, making them well suited to mobility and expansion, especially landscapes with highly variable and vertical topography such as the mountainous foothills of western Sichuan. Shared cultural attributes with sites in northwestern China also suggest that millet agriculturalists in the Southwest China highlands could have played a role in the spread of populations, languages, and genes.|$|R

The experiment was conducted in pot experiment at Dryland Agriculture Institute, West Texas A&M University, Canyon, Texas, USA, during spring 2010. The objective {{of this study was}} to know whether the differences in the competitive ability of different crop species influence WUE or not? The planned mean comparison indicated that the corn WUE was 20, 11, and 6 % higher in the mixed stand than in pure stand at 30, 60, and 90  days after emergence (DAE), respectively. The corn plants in pure stand had 91, 72, and 81 % higher WUE than the average WUE of sorghum and millets in pure stand at 30, 60, and 90 DAE, respectively. Grain sorghum in pure stand had 70, 32, and 36 % higher WUE than that of millets in pure stand at 30, 60, and 90 DAE, respectively. The WUE of three crops in mixed stand was 10 and 8 % higher than the two crops mixed stand at the two early stages; but the WUE was 24 % less in the three crops mixed stand than the two crops mixed stand at 90 DAE. Corn-mixed stand in two crops (average of corn + sorghum and corn + millets) had 78, 74, and 74 % higher WUE than the mixed stand of sorghum and millets at 30, 60, and 90 DAE, respectively. Corn and millets mixed stand had 14, 10, and 26 % higher WUE than the corn and sorghum mixed stand at 30, 60, and 90 DAE, respectively. The increase in water level decreased WUE at the two late growth stages in all three crop plants. At the early growth stage (30 DAE), WUE increased in all crops at the higher water level. On the basis of CR, corn was found the best competitor, while millets was declared the least competitor in the mixed stands (corn > sorghum > millets). It was concluded that the higher the compatibility of a species in a mixed stands, the greater will be total biomass accumulation (corn > sorghum > millets) and hence WUE (corn > sorghum > millets) ...|$|R
30|$|There {{are strong}} {{linguistic}} reasons for why cultivation {{of rice and}} <b>foxtail</b> and broomcorn <b>millet</b> in Taiwan cannot have been interrupted from at least 2000  BCE. It is generally agreed that the Austronesian languages outside of Taiwan (‘Malayo-Polynesian’) were founded in a single out-of-Taiwan migration event, c. 2000  BCE. Phonetically matching words {{for each of the}} cereals occur in both the Austronesian languages of Taiwan and outside of Taiwan. The regular pattern of correspondence in their vowels and consonants indicates that the Taiwanese and non-Taiwanese words are vertically inherited from a single prototype, which cannot be more recent than the out-of-Taiwan event. The ancestral Proto-Austronesian words for foxtail, broomcorn and rice have been reconstructed as *beCeŋ, *baCaR and *pajay, respectively (Wolff 2010; Tsuchida 1976; Blust and Trussel 2016; Shomura et al. 2008). In addition, the ancestral Proto-Austronesian language has also been shown to have had words for the boat, house, hunting, fishnet, domesticated dog, and field (Wolff 2010; Tsuchida 1976; Blust and Trussel 2016).|$|R
30|$|With the {{transition}} to the Majiayao phase (ca 3500 BC), sites become widely spread across western Sichuan. In this region, two radiocarbon dates place this phase at approximately 3300 – 2600 cal. BC (Aba et al. 2008). Sites of this period show clear cultural affinities with the Majiayao heartland. This is clearest in the painted pottery excavated from these sites. Recent analysis of this pottery has shown that it was traded into Western Sichuan from the Majiayao heartland in Gansu and Qinghai (Cui et al. 2011; Hong et al. 2011). Archaeobotanical analysis of two sites relating to this phase is currently in progress at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (Zhao 2008). Remains from the site of Haxiu (ca 3300 – 2700 BC) show that subsistence was based on both broomcorn (Panicum miliaceum) and <b>foxtail</b> (Setaria italica) <b>millet</b> (Aba et al. 2008, 2007; Zhao 2008). Remains from the site of Yingpanshan (ca 3300 – 2500 BC) show a similar pattern (Chengdu et al. 2002; Zhao 2008). The movement of millet agriculture into this region is also accompanied by pig husbandry, and the bones of domestic pigs have been uncovered at nearly all Majiayao sites in Western Sichuan (He et al. 2009).|$|R
