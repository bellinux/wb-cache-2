40|$|The Early Warning System gives {{national}} parliaments {{the right to}} intervene in European Union policy-making. This article investigates their incentives to submit reasoned opinions. It analyses the reactions of 40 parliamentary chambers to 411 <b>draft</b> <b>legislative</b> <b>acts</b> between 1 January 2010 and 31 December 2013 by ReLogit models. The article argues that, beyond institutional capacity, political motivation explains cross-chamber and inter-temporal variation. Higher levels of party political contestation over EU integration have a positive effect, but greater party dispersion on the left-right dimension negatively affects submissions. Furthermore, salient and urgent <b>draft</b> <b>legislative</b> <b>acts</b> incentivise parliaments to become active in the Early Warning System.

40|$|We {{appraise}} the new EU supervisory architecture {{presented by}} the Commission in a package of five ‘draft legislative acts’. Two would establish a European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) to undertake macro-prudential issues. Three would establish the system of European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs) : Banking, Securities and Insurance. The theoretical case for this package of <b>draft</b> <b>legislative</b> <b>acts</b> has {{been made by the}} High-Level Group on Financial Supervision in the EU. The package has been examined by the ECOFIN of 2 December 2009, which has introduced changes to the Commission's three <b>draft</b> <b>legislative</b> <b>acts</b> concerning the ESAs. We examine the theoretical approach underlying the <b>draft</b> <b>legislative</b> <b>acts,</b> which is based on the State theory of money. We find it incomplete {{in the case of the}} ESRB because the mission of ECB in 'mitigating system risks within the financial system' cannot be attained without real powers and tools; it is in essence a macro-economic phenomenon. We also arrive at another conclusion relating to the three proposals on the ESAs. The theoretical underpinning of the three is based on the premise of the school of regulation. Today's evolution of the EU cannot allow ESAs to go beyond their Treaty competence. Nor could the ESAs attain their objective of 'setting the common rules for supervising national entities'. Thus, the conception of the EU system of financial supervision is deficient, in need of repair. We propose an alternative approach to the new EU supervisory architecture consisting of three elements. First, we restate the case for the Central Banks to assume responsibility for the ‘last resort of managing risk', and be endowed with real power. Second, the role of the national central banks in ‘micro-supervision’ should be enhanced; amongst other things, credit rating should be their responsibility. Third, a structure for the budgetary burden is proposed by the establishment of the ‘European Fund for Financial Stability’ endowed with its own capital resource...|$|R

40|$|The essay aims at {{analysing}} how {{the relationship}} between parliaments in the European Union (EU) – the European, the national and the regional parliaments – are shaped after the coming into force of the Treaty of Lisbon and how the early warning mechanism can contribute to promoting {{their participation in the}} EU decision-making. Indeed, the control of compliance of <b>draft</b> <b>legislative</b> <b>acts</b> with the principle of subsidiarity appears as a key-element for enhancing the parliamentary involvement in EU affairs, as it is the opportunity to develop new institutional mechanisms, like the 'political dialogue', in spite of the political nature and function of this control. This essay is based on Neil MacCormick’s theory on the subsidiarity principle and, in particular, on the assumptions that what is called 'democratic deficit' in the EU is in reality a 'subsidiarity deficit'. Here it is argued that the 'subsidiarity deficit' can be contrasted by the early warning mechanism introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon and by the cooperation among the Parliaments of the EU.

40|$|The EU {{has most}} {{frequently}} resorted to harmonisation {{as a model}} to achieve its in-ternal market. This contribution examines the dynamics of legal differentiation in EU’s internal market law laid down in Article 114 TFEU and secondary laws. It con-cludes {{that there has been}} a modest number of invocations of the derogation possibili-ties under Article 114 (4) and (5) TFEU and the safeguard clauses. The low number may be due to the fact that may both the Commission and the Courts have a very rig-id reading of the procedure whilst the grounds for invocation are very limited. This low number nevertheless does not automatically imply that Member States agree with the level of protection laid down in the EU’s harmonisation measures or that the opt out mechanisms are not relevant. Derogation mechanisms may play an important role in the negotiations of the level of protection in the <b>draft</b> <b>legislative</b> <b>acts.</b> This study moreover reveals that the derogation mechanisms may be important devices of regulatory adjustment and learning in the fields of public health and environmental protection in the EU. They ultimately may rather strengthen the uniformity of regula-tory requirements in the EU internal market instead of leading to regulatory diversity...|$|R
