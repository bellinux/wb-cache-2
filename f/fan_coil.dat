50|$|<b>Fan</b> <b>coil</b> {{units are}} divided into two types: Two-pipe <b>fan</b> <b>coil</b> units or four-pipe <b>fan</b> <b>coil</b> units. Two-pipe <b>fan</b> <b>coil</b> units have one (1) supply and one (1) return pipe. The supply pipe {{supplies}} either cold or hot water to the unit depending {{on the time of}} year. Four-pipe <b>fan</b> <b>coil</b> units have two (2) supply pipes and two (2) return pipes. This allows either hot or cold water to enter the unit at any given time. Since it is often necessary to heat and cool different areas of a building at the same time, due to differences in internal heat loss or heat gains, the four-pipe <b>fan</b> <b>coil</b> unit is most commonly used.|$|E

40|$|This work aims {{to present}} an {{analysis}} of architectural repercussions involved in choosing a certain climatic system for an office block. The intention is to unite techniques and the building itself. Independently of the bioclimatic design criteria for office work, these buildings require active technical systems for their air conditioning. We should only consider the air conditioning option that allows for regulation of areas and the maximum energetic effectiveness (VAV, <b>fan</b> <b>coils,</b> ducted <b>fan</b> <b>coils,</b> etc). The choice of the final system has serious considerations for both the architect and the building. In this study a representative office floor plan is proposed. Among its features are: an open-plan, certain height, core services and glass retaining wall. For this plan, the different air conditioning systems are analysed focusing on the consequences on the architecture (space occupied, spatial distribution, visual impact, user comfort, etc). These aspects will be studied afterwards for the whole building. This work {{will allow us to}} have a summary of the architectural repercussions of each system so that the architect can take decisions before designing the installation...|$|R

Pressure independent control valves are {{an essential part of the}} hydronic control in chilled water applications. They are simple to select and easy to set.

50|$|Depending {{upon the}} {{selected}} chilled water temperatures {{and the relative}} humidity of the space, {{it is likely that}} the cooling coil will dehumidify the entering air stream, and as a by product of this process, it will at times produce a condensate which will need to be carried to drain.

The simplest means to drain the condensate from multiple <b>fan</b> <b>coil</b> units will be by a network of pipework laid to falls to a suitable point.

For a better optimisation of the global energy consumption of the building, the interaction between natural and artificial lighting is taken into account, with energy characteristics of the lighting system. Different stages are chained: calculation of energy needs of the building, calculation of the air handling unit energy rates for different components: humidifier, cooling and heating coils, calculation of primary energy rates demanded by chillers or boilers.

5000|$|Speed {{control of}} the fan motors within a <b>fan</b> <b>coil</b> unit is partly used to control the heating and cooling output desired from the unit. Some {{manufacturers}} accomplish speed control by adjusting the taps on an AC transformer supplying the power to the fan motor. Typically this would require adjustment at the commissioning stage of the building construction process and is therefore set for life at a fixed speed. Other manufacturers provide custom-wound Permanent Split Capacitor (PSC) motors with speed taps in the windings, set to the desired speed levels for the <b>fan</b> <b>coil</b> unit design. A simple speed selector switch (Off-High-Medium-Low) is provided for the local room occupant to control the fan speed. Typically this speed selector switch is integral to the room thermostat, and is set manually or is controlled automatically by the digital room thermostat. Building Energy Management Systems {{can be used for}} automatic fan speed and temperature control. Fan motors are typically AC Shaded Pole or Permanent Split Capacitor. More recent developments include brushless DC designs with electronic commutation.

40|$|Heating, {{ventilating}} and air-conditioning (HVAC) {{systems are}} typical non-linear time-variable multivariate systems with disturbances and uncertainties. In this paper, an approach {{based on a}} combined neuro-fuzzy model for dynamic and automatic regulation of indoor temperature is proposed.

Moreover, the used neural network is optimized by the analytical calculation of the embedding parameters, and the goodness of this approach is tested through MATLAB. The fuzzy controller is driven by the indoor temperature forecasted by the neural network module and is able to adjust the membership functions dynamically, since thermal comfort is a very subjective factor and may vary even in the same subject.
