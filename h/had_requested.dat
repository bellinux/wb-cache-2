5|$|Dave Pear, the Buccaneers' first Pro Bowl {{selection}} and most popular player, {{was traded to}} the Oakland Raiders for two draft picks. This was partly to get extra help in what was expected to be a strong offensive draft, but also because Pear <b>had</b> <b>requested</b> that he be traded if his contract could not be renegotiated. Dave Green, the punter and kicker through the first three seasons, had to be replaced when he tore his achilles tendon stepping over a tackling dummy in training camp.|$|E

Once {{the petition}}s were submitted, Morse and Giron challenged the effort in court, but were denied the injunction that they <b>had</b> <b>requested</b> from the court. A further court hearing resulted in the election being conducted in-person rather than by mail, which also led to Giron complaining of voter suppression.|$|E
5|$|During the season, the Rangers were {{interested}} in acquiring Vancouver Canucks forward Pavel Bure. It was reported that Canucks general manager Brian Burke <b>had</b> <b>requested</b> Malhotra {{to be involved in}} a trade that would have sent him along with Niklas Sundstrom, Dan Cloutier and the Rangers' first-round pick in the 1999 draft in exchange for Bure.

5|$|However, {{the plans}} {{did not fully}} work as intended. The native populations that joined Arenales could not resist the royalist counter-attacks, and the slaves did not join the army in the {{expected}} numbers. The Argentine provinces could not send the supporting army that San Martín <b>had</b> <b>requested</b> earlier, and the Army of the North no longer existed. As a result, he wrote to Simón Bolívar, trying to coordinate actions with him.|$|E

5|$|In {{parallel}} with the efforts of Pierce, Silcott's lawyers <b>had</b> <b>requested</b> access in November 1990 to his original interview notes, so that the seven pages from his crucial fifth interview – the notes he said were fabricated– could be submitted for an electrostatic detection analysis (ESDA).
