5|$|Chapter 2 {{examines}} {{productivity in}} the contemporary economy. Cowen describes spurts in productivity growth, 2.8% between 1996 and 2000 and 3.8% from 2000 to 2004, and he asks if they disprove the stagnation thesis. He concedes {{that there have been}} gains in certain areas, such as information technology, but argues that in other important areas such as finance, which is 8% of GDP, there <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>less</b> value created.|$|E
5|$|The {{record was}} well {{received}} among contemporary music critics, although retrospective analysis <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>less</b> favorable. It managed {{to enter the}} top 30 on the Billboard 200 with no commercial radio play; it charted in several other countries as well. The album was eventually certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and indicated Megadeth's forthcoming emergence from the underground scene. A remixed and remastered edition of the album, including several bonus tracks, was released in August 2004.|$|E
5|$|There <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>less</b> {{critique}} of Bray’s musical work, but Victor Fell Yellin tried to recreate {{what he felt}} was the score's melodic expressiveness and sonorous grandeur in his 1978 recording of it. In the liner notes, {{he points out that}} the music does not critically compare with the great musical masters of its time, but its success is derived from its charm. While it lacks modulation, it contains well-turned melodic and rhythmic phrases, and syncopations that add to its American style.|$|E

5|$|From {{the late}} 1990s, the town {{experienced}} severe flooding problems from the Severn and Rea Brook. In {{the autumn of}} 2000 large swathes of the town were underwater, notably Frankwell, which flooded three times in six weeks. The Frankwell flood defences were completed in 2003, along with the new offices of the borough council. More recently, such as in 2005 and 2007, flooding <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>less</b> severe, and the defences have generally held back floodwaters from the town centre areas. However, the town car parks are often left to be flooded in the winter, which reduces trade in the town, most evidenced in the run up to Christmas in 2007.|$|E
5|$|The Court {{made clear}} that the {{interests}} of children should be assumed to be covered as part of the interests of the parent, not treated as separate, but this doctrine <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>less</b> clear in practice as termination proceedings still focus on the fitness of the parent. This has resulted in further constitutional protections for parents and increasingly formal termination proceedings that limit the contribution of the child's interests in the proceedings. Santosky has also contributed to the role of parental rights of undocumented immigrants as the constitutionally protected parental rights may apply to non-citizens as well as United States citizens.|$|E
5|$|The first beat 'em up was 1984's Kung-Fu Master, with 1986's Renegade {{introducing}} the urban settings and underworld revenge themes employed extensively by later games. The genre then saw {{a period of}} high popularity between the release of Double Dragon in 1987, which defined the two-player cooperative mode central to classic beat 'em ups, and 1991's Street Fighter II, which drew gamers towards one-on-one fighting games. Games such as Streets of Rage, Final Fight and Golden Axe are other classics to emerge from this period. The genre <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>less</b> popular since the emergence of 3D-based mass-market games, but still some beat 'em ups adapted the simple formula to utilize large-scale 3D environments.|$|E

5|$|The band {{continued}} to release commercially successful albums, including Some Girls (1978) and Tattoo You (1981), which were their most popular albums worldwide. From 1983 to 1987, tensions between Jagger and Richards almost caused the band to split. However, {{they managed to}} patch up their friendship after they separated temporarily to work on solo projects, and experienced a comeback with Steel Wheels (1989), which {{was followed by a}} large stadium and arena tour. Since the 1990s, new recorded material from the group <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>less</b> well-received and less frequent. Despite this, the Rolling Stones have {{continued to}} be a huge attraction on the live circuit, with stadium tours in the 1990s and 2000s. By 2007, the band had four of the top five highest-grossing concert tours of all time: Voodoo Lounge Tour (1994–1995), Bridges to Babylon Tour (1997–1998), Licks Tour (2002–2003) and A Bigger Bang Tour (2005–2007).|$|E

25|$|Because Blake's later poetry {{contains}} a private mythology with complex symbolism, his late work <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>less</b> published than his earlier more accessible work. The Vintage anthology of Blake edited by Patti Smith focuses {{heavily on the}} earlier work, as do many critical studies such as William Blake by D. G. Gillham.|$|E

25|$|Although local {{extinction}} {{of one or}} more competitors <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>less</b> documented than niche separation or competitive exclusion, it does occur. In an experiment involving zooplankton in artificial rock pools, local extinction rates were significantly higher in areas of interspecific competition. In these cases, therefore, the negative effects are not only at the population level but also species richness of communities.|$|E
25|$|Omari Ahmed Clement Banks (born 17 July 1982) is an Anguillan {{musician}} and former cricketer, {{who appeared in}} 10 Test matches for the West Indies, as well as domestic matches for the Leeward Islands. In 2011, Banks began to pursue his musical career professionally and <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>less</b> involved in playing regional cricket, and officially retired from cricket on 31 January 2012.|$|E
25|$|The {{first decade}} of the 2000s saw the peak of this new rivalry, with the Longhorns at one point {{trailing}} Kansas only 5–7 in games played over an almost-nine-season period, and with many of the contests being closely contested classics. Since the beginning of the 2008–09 season, Texas <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>less</b> competitive both nationally and in the rivalry, trailing Kansas 2–14 in games played since that time.|$|E

25|$|Among {{the most}} notable post-Soviet authors are H. L. Oldie, Sergey Lukyanenko, Alexander Zorich and Vadim Panov. Russia's film industry, however, <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>less</b> {{successful}} recently, producing only a few science fiction films, {{most of them are}} adaptations of books by the Strugatskys (The Inhabited Island, The Ugly Swans) or Bulychov (Alice's Birthday). Science fiction media in Russia is represented with such magazines as Mir Fantastiki and Esli.|$|E
25|$|Clinically, a {{combination}} of psychotherapy and medication can often produce good results, although research evidence of this approach <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>less</b> robust. Some improvement may be noticed in a fairly short period of time, about 6 to 8 weeks. Psychotherapy can improve the effectiveness of medication, {{reduce the likelihood of}} relapse for someone who has discontinued medication, and offer help for people with panic disorder who do not respond at all to medication.|$|E
25|$|The Islamic {{resurgence}} <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>less</b> {{a renewal}} of faith and dedication than a public resurfacing of perspectives and ideals previously relegated to less public, informal relations under impact of European secular influences. They are not medieval Islamic ideals, but ideas from the past that remained vital to many of these peoples, and now are used to interpret the problems of contemporary times. The Turco-Persian Islamic tradition provided the elements they have used to express their shared concerns.|$|E

25|$|Eli Lilly has {{manufactured}} Secobarbital, a barbiturate derivative with anaesthetic, anticonvulsant, sedative and hypnotic properties. Lilly marketed Secobarbital {{under the}} brand name Seconal. Secobarbital is indicated {{for the treatment of}} epilepsy, temporary insomnia and as a pre-operative medication to produce anaesthesia and anxiolysis in short surgical, diagnostic, or therapeutic procedures which are minimally painful. With the onset of new therapies for the treatment of these conditions, Secobarbital <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>less</b> utilized, and Lilly ceased manufacturing it in 2001.|$|E
25|$|Clinical {{trials of}} protein kinase inhibitors, which block the {{abnormal}} kinase proteins {{involved in the}} development and growth of medullary cancer cells, showed clear evidence of response in 10-30% of patients. In the majority of responders there <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>less</b> than a 30% decrease in tumor mass, yet the responses have been durable; responses have been stable for periods exceeding 3 years. The major side effects of this class of drug include hypertension, nausea, diarrhea, some cardiac electrical abnormalities, and thrombotic or bleeding episodes.|$|E
25|$|Common {{side effects}} when taken by mouth include nausea and itchiness. When {{applied to the}} skin common side effects include redness and burning.

When used by mouth, greater care should be taken in those with liver problems. It is in the azole class of medications and works by disrupting the cell membrane.|$|E
