To this end, the article focuses {{on the right to}} health care and undertakes a comparative study of irregular migrants' access to health care in France, the United Kingdom and Canada. The study shows that states perceive the conferment of social rights on irregular migrants as an erosion of the government's immigration power notwithstanding their characterisation as human rights. The resource-intensive nature of the right to health care further heightens states' reluctance to extend this right to irregular migrants. Yet compliance with international human rights law and respect for human dignity require that states reinstate personhood as a source of rights and therefore reassess the relevance of their immigration power...|$|R

40|$|Islands play a {{significant}} role in international irregular maritime migration. Frequently they are part of maritime interstitial spaces between states, and their location, combined with institutional membership, makes them part of international migration routes and subject to border management strategies. In this paper borders are analysed as social institutions used for regulating relative permeability through rules of entry and exit for persons, goods and capital. Borders institutionalize territoriality and are politically implemented by states. They are selective, also in migration, and irregular border transit is not always indicative of an inability to control. The Canary Islands are used as an illustrative example of how border management at the southern edge of the European Union has evolved towards more coercive deterrence and tighter surveillance. The Canary Islands experienced <b>irregular</b> maritime <b>immigration</b> from the west African coasts during the first decade of the 21 st century and most of these migrants intended to use the islands as transit space towards the European continent. Increasing surveillance in countries of origin, enforcement of border controls and stricter return policies were used to stop flows. The so-called “cayuco crisis” in 2006 induced institutional change in border management and forced the active involvement of the EU through FRONTEX...|$|R
40|$|Sweden {{is said to}} be one of {{the most}} {{restrictive}} countries in all of Europe when it comes to the right to health for irregular migrants. The UN and civil society have called on the Swedish Government to revise its domestic legislation in order to meet what it deems the States’ human rights obligation. This paper seeks to examine whether the Swedish Government is in fact violating international human rights law with its position to provide only ‘immediate’ health care services to irregular migrants. Furthermore, the paper conducts a comparative analysis with five other European nations to garner insight into factors that may influence State health care policy for irregular migrants. The paper argues that a lack of a concrete definition of health itself and the degree of the right to health, together with the conflict of the sovereign nation state rights and the challenges to the practical enjoyment of rights for irregular migrants, leaves room for interpretation of international human rights documents. The paper therefore concludes that the responsibility set under European level legislation, requiring emergency health services be provided to irregular migrants, offers the most tangible description of responsibility. As such, Sweden appears to be within its obligations. A number of factors, including the number and type of <b>irregular</b> migrants, <b>immigration</b> history and current policy, the welfare state system, as well as the economic impact and public opinion, play a role in determining health care policies. While the results point to relationships between the factors and health care policy for irregular migrants, the complex and dynamic nature of irregular migration makes it difficult to conclusively conclude the degree of the impact...|$|R
40|$|The current {{qualitative}} research {{is focused on}} the <b>irregular</b> asylum <b>immigration</b> into the European Union (EU) within a context of securitization practices. The case study is the Trampoline House - a small NGO in Copenhagen, Denmark that aims to facilitate a wider public dialogue within the field of asylum immigration. Adopting an ethnographic approach (in-depth interviews and participant observation, I tried to reveal the complexity of asylum migration in the light of restrictive immigration regimes and shed light on the shortcomings of the Danish asylum system that is considered among the fair ones in Europe. The asylum seekers’ personal meaning-making process is of crucial importance, especially in the interdisciplinary field of international migration. The thesis argues that because of the ongoing attempts to restrict the legal options for people fleeing conflict zones to seek international protection, labeling asylum seekers “illegal” contributes to their further criminalization and/or victimization. Therefore the term “irregular” was employed in the current research. The Results section is organized into three thematic parts. In the first one, attention is paid to what Carling (2002) calls “the aspiration-ability” model, i. e. the desire to migrate and the ability to fulfill this wish. That includes, among others, choice and coercion in the decision-making process and financing and organizing “the trip” to Europe. The second part reveals interesting details about informants’ personal experiences with the EU border control regimes and their evaluation on the matter of the overall difficulty to enter EU. The third part {{is focused on the}} ways asylum seekers are experiencing and evaluating the Danish asylum system. Interesting are the reflections of the informants on the question of staying underground. Thesis concludes that the recent European immigration restriction policies have created a profitable international business for people smugglers and that the expensive surveillance technologies and better trained police officers at the external borders have little to no success in preventing people to enter the EU...|$|R

The Author tries to demonstrate how {{a lot of the}} apparent failures of migration policies depend {{of the fact that the}} official aims of them often does not correspond to the latent one. In fact, the empirical phenomenology of migration rarely coincides with that represented by the policies that pretend to control it. At the centre of this plot of contradictions there are the ethnic networks, the role of which in structuring migration processes and in addressing insertion in society and in labour market is too often undervalued by policies. It is also stressed another problematic feature of immigration policies, that is the low finalisation to a circular process between economic inclusion and social integration, with relevant consequences on both aspects (increase of <b>irregular</b> work, temporary <b>immigration,</b> discrimination, etc.). The principal problem is recognised in an absence of a strategic vision of the policies that aim to create an integrated society and to carry on economic programs and social measures at the same time. The capacity of the society to recognise the link between immigrant labour and local development and competitiveness plans is estimated as the key for success policies...|$|R

Such a boarding-house may well cease to be attractive to short-term lodgers, and the residents may remain in unsatisfactory accommodation for long periods.

For example, in Japan, minshuku are an almost exact equivalent although the normal arrangement would be the equivalent of the English half-board. In Hawaii, where the cost of living is high and incomes barely keep pace, it is common to take in lodgers (who are boarders in English terminology) that share the burden of the overall rent or mortgage payable.|$|E

40|$|The {{topic of}} this thesis is the EU’s policy on <b>irregular</b> <b>immigration.</b> At {{the centre of}} the inquiry is the externally-oriented and externalizing {{approach}} to <b>irregular</b> <b>immigration</b> that has been adopted in the EU and the predominant use of external measures in the EU’s policy to deal with <b>irregular</b> <b>immigration</b> at the cost of internal and protective measures. The EU’s policy is questioned as the external measures that the EU has adopted are shown to be both ineffective in actually preventing irregular migrants from entering Europe and detrimental to the safety and human rights of irregular migrants and asylum-seekers. While the internal and protective measures are lacking in the EU’s policy, it also seems that the EU treats the considerable challenges that occur within Europe, and which are estimated to involve several million people, with a complete ambivalence. In explaining the EU’s policy on <b>irregular</b> <b>immigration</b> the vertical and horizontal venue-shopping theory is tested in the thesis. This subsequently opens up further questions regarding the national approaches to <b>irregular</b> <b>immigration</b> in the member states...|$|E
40|$|This article {{addresses}} the issues {{pertaining to the}} adoption and development of legislation on irregular migration {{in the context of}} uncontrolled {{growth in the number of}} immigrants from North Africa and the Middle East to the EU. The article attempts at studying the EU legislation on irregular migration, classifying it, and analysing the prospects of EU migration legislation in the light of an increase in <b>irregular</b> <b>immigration</b> into the EU. The author systematises, classifies the current EU legislation on <b>irregular</b> <b>immigration,</b> and analyses the conditions, in which this legislation was developed. Using the legislation analysis method, the author proposes the following system of EU legislation on irregular immigration: rules preventing assistance to <b>irregular</b> <b>immigration,</b> rules preventing employment of irregular immigrants, rules on the return of irregular migrants and readmission, rules on border control, and rules on collaboration with third countries. The author pays special attention to analysing the current state of <b>irregular</b> <b>immigration</b> to the EU, which was dubbed the "greatest migration crisis in Europe". The conclusion is that the European Union succeeded in the development of pioneering legislation on <b>irregular</b> <b>immigration,</b> which can serve as the basis for reception by other states. However, changes in the political and economic situation in the EU's southern borderlands made the current legal mechanisms incapable of withstanding new threats.

40|$|Victims of {{domestic}} violence may commonly be constructed as ‘deserving’ of state support, however the intersection of migration and domestic violence complicates such matters, often rendering migrant women with an <b>irregular</b> <b>immigration</b> status as ‘undeserving’. This thesis bridges the gap between literatures on migration and domestic violence by using the framework of ‘(un) deservingness’ to explore {{the lives of women}} with an <b>irregular</b> <b>immigration</b> status who experience domestic violence. Interviews were conducted with women with an <b>irregular</b> <b>immigration</b> status, primarily focusing on those who overstay their visas, as well as professionals who provide support to women. Drawing on interview data, the thesis explores the nuanced ways in which the intersection of migration and domestic violence plays out in the lives of women. It considers how abusive partners use the label and political context around having an <b>irregular</b> <b>immigration</b> status in the UK, as a tool to exacerbate the domestic violence. By focusing on lived experiences, the study also draws attention to women’s fears in managing the complexity around holding this immigration status in their daily lives. Moreover, the thesis explores the structural violence and other barriers which this sub-group of migrant women encounter when seeking support, which is often shaped by their social position and the nature of their immigration status, particularly for those who have No Recourse to Public Funds (NRPF). The NRPF label signals that the state construes such women as ‘undeserving’, and this has very real consequences particularly in the context {{of domestic}} violence...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines how}} we construct security threats. Theoretically, {{it contributes to}} the literature on securitization and threat construction, which has hitherto overlooked how influential bureaucracies that – in contrast to the police and the military – have little to gain from widened threat perceptions, may still contribute to threat construction. The dissertation studies the European Commission and the issue of <b>irregular</b> <b>immigration.</b> By using frame analysis, it firstly explores what constructions of <b>irregular</b> <b>immigration</b> that the Commission generates and to what extent these contribute to threat construction. Using the Bourdieusian concepts of field, capital and habitus, it secondly analyzes how certain constructions of <b>irregular</b> <b>immigration</b> are authorized at the expense of others, due to the inner bureaucratic logic of the Commission. The empirical result reveals that the Commission mostly defines irregular immigrants as victims, yet simultaneously favors policy solutions that mainly seek to avert immigration. The Commission thus contributes to threat construction primarily through its policy solutions. Studying the inner logic of the Commission field highlights how informal routines and tacit power relations between Commission departments authorize certain frames over others. Importantly, the analysis shows how the naming of irregular immigrants as victims tends not to cost the officials anything in terms of symbolic capital, whereas the suggesting of less restrictive solutions tends to do so. Definitions and policy solutions thus follow different bureaucratic logics, which enables a mismatch between them. Moreover, the threat construction appears not because Commission officials believe that restrictive measures are the only way to solve problems linked to <b>irregular</b> <b>immigration.</b> On the contrary, officials believe that a multitude of solutions are needed. Instead, the threat construction is an unintended consequence of the logic of the field.

The paper analyses whether there is an adequate human rights framework for protection of irregular immigrants or whether the irregular status exempts the migrants from the protection of international human rights law.

It is divided into three main sections.

This paper examines the role that detention has played in the Maltese government's response to the flows of <b>irregular</b> <b>immigration</b> to the island in the 21 st century. It argues that detention is symbolic of the crisis narrative that the Maltese government has constructed as a response to these immigration flows in order to gain more practical and financial support from the European Union. The detention policy also serves to reinforce this interpretation of <b>irregular</b> <b>immigration.</b> Such a portrayal, combined with the use of detention as a deterrent, produces detrimental consequences for the migrant population, as well as the wider Maltese society.

40|$|This article {{examines}} how the power relationships between Malta and the Republic of Cyprus, {{on the one}} hand, and the European Union, on the other, shape <b>irregular</b> <b>immigration</b> policies in these two sovereign outpost island states in the Mediterranean. As member states on the EU's southern periphery, Malta and Cyprus have faced new institutional structures since their accession in 2004 within which they now construct their migration policies. Here, I examine how the new structures influence the discourse and logic of migration policies and politics and also how the seemingly small and powerless states affect regional policies. My contention is that, within this EU framework and with limited material power, the two outpost states have developed strategies based on nonmaterial power in order to defend and promote their interests. Such strategies have resulted in treating <b>irregular</b> <b>immigration</b> as a crisis {{in order to attract}} support. The new dynamics have thus resulted in more barriers to migration, and in negative consequences for the individual migrants and refugees on the islands. Although the strategies of Malta and Cyprus have been surprisingly successful in influencing regional migration governance, their long-term effectiveness is questionable, and their effects on the migrant and local population problematic...|$|E
