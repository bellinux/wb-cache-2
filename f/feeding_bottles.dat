25|$|Terracotta <b>feeding</b> <b>bottles</b> {{surviving}} {{from the}} third millennium BC in Sumeria indicate that children who were not being breastfed were receiving animal milk, probably from cows.

Unless another lactating woman was available, a mother who lacked enough breast milk was likely to lose her child. To avert that possibility if a wet nurse was not available, an animal such as a donkey, cow, goat, sheep or dog could be employed. Suckling directly was preferable to milking an animal and giving the milk, as contamination by microbes during the milking process could lead to the infant contracting a deadly diarrheal disease. It was not until as late as the 1870s that stored animal milk became safe to drink due to the invention of pasteurisation and sterilisation.|$|E

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the extent to which dental prevention among Turkish parents differs from that among Moroccan parents in one of the large cities in the Netherlands. Design: Turkish and Moroccan mothers with a child of approximately six months old, who visited the well baby clinics in the Schilderswijk area of The Hague, were asked to participate in a dental care project. As part of the initial data collection in this project, 170 Turkish and 153 Moroccan mothers were interviewed at home by a woman who spoke their native languages. The interview contained questions about dental prevention, such as fluoride use, <b>feeding</b> <b>bottle</b> use, visits to the dentist, brushing, information about oral care, and about relevant background characteristics. Results: More Moroccan than Turkish mothers reported that they did not use a <b>feeding</b> <b>bottle</b> for the baby, went to the dentist twice a year, brushed their own teeth at least twice a day and started to brush their children's teeth at an early age. The Moroccan mothers were more committed to dental prevention than Turkish mothers, even after correction for background characteristics such as education, language skills and the number of years spent in the Netherlands. Conclusions: Ethnic groups should not be seen as a single group for dental prevention. It is recommended that Turkish parents in particular be encouraged to go to the dentist twice a year, to start brushing their children's teeth at an early age and to wean their children off use of a <b>feeding</b> <b>bottle</b> in bed...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: In {{intensive}} care patients, enteral feeding requires sterile feedings because of infectious complications and adequate supplements to meet nutritional needs. Heretofore, prepacked, large-volume formula containers were developed, but bacterial contamination occurred in 4 % to 15 %. Our {{objective was to}} investigate the microbial contamination rate of 1 -L <b>feeding</b> <b>bottles</b> and newly designed administration sets over hanging times of 24 hrs in the {{intensive care}} unit (ICU). DESIGN AND SETTING: A prospective observational cohort study of patients admitted to the ICU of a university hospital. PATIENTS: All consecutive patients fed via a nasojejunal tube for at least 4 days. MEASUREMENTS: Cultures of <b>feeding</b> <b>bottles,</b> administration sets, and gastric and tracheobronchial aspirates at day 0, 1, 2, 4, and 7. RESULTS: A total of 4 % of <b>feeding</b> <b>bottles</b> and 74 % of infusion sets contained > 10 (2) colony forming units (CFU) /mL. Gastric and bronchial aspirates were positive in 90 % and 92 %, respectively. Bacterial counts of <b>feeding</b> <b>bottles</b> were 10 (2) - 10 (5) CFU/mL, and the main bacteria isolated included Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella oxytoca, and enterococci. One third of all cultured bacteria in <b>feeding</b> <b>bottles,</b> administration sets, stomach, and lungs belonged to the Enterobacteriaceae family, which was held responsible for the nosocomial infections in the ICU. None of the 1 -L <b>feeding</b> <b>bottles</b> with a hanging time of 19 - 24 hrs was contaminated. Only bottles that had to be exchanged because of need for a faster rate of infusion proved to be contaminated, apparently without clinical consequences. With time and the increasing severity of disease, the administration sets became contaminated at an increasingly faster rate and with higher bacterial counts mainly through retrograde growth of endogenous bacteria. The final step of bottle contamination might have been the bacterial transfer by nurses' hands.
