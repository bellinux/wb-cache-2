Therefore, the actual protection characteristics and operation behavior has to be analyzed by the actual fault and the material protecting conditions. Digital <b>fault</b> <b>recorder</b> device real-timely records the change of the relative electrical varieties when fault occur, which provide the strong evidence for operating characteristics analysis of relay protection.
