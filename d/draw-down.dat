5|$|The Regia Marina demobilized {{after the}} end of the war in 1918 and the <b>draw-down</b> {{continued}} into the 1920s in large part due to severe budgetary shortfalls in the postwar period. The engines installed on Nino Bixio and her sister proved to be problematic throughout her time in service, which ultimately cut her career short. She was stricken from the naval register on 15 March 1929 and subsequently broken up for scrap; in contrast, the much more efficient Quarto, which had been built before Nino Bixio, remained in service for another decade.|$|E
5|$|In 1922, Kinkaid became Assistant Chief of Staff to the Commander U.S. Naval Detachment in Turkish Waters, Rear Admiral Mark L. Bristol. This tour saw {{the end of}} the Greek {{occupation}} of Smyrna. The ratification of the Treaty of Lausanne by Turkey resulted in a <b>draw-down</b> of U.S. naval forces in the region, reducing Bristol's post to a primarily diplomatic one. In 1924, Kinkaid, whose father had died in August 1920, requested a posting back to the United States owing to his mother's ill-health. The ship taking him back, the light cruiser , had to sail by way of Iran in order to collect the body of Vice Consul Robert Imbrie, who had been killed by an angry mob in Tehran.|$|E

The 2/1st Machine Gun Battalion remained stationed around Gaza until October, when it was sent to Syria to bolster the garrison that had been established there following the defeat of Vichy French forces. At this time, the 2/1st effectively became assigned to the 7th Division, and received a new commanding officer, as Lieutenant Colonel Cyril Fidock, a World War I veteran, replaced Gooch. The battalion was subsequently stationed in Damascus and at Zaboud, remaining there until early 1942, when it was moved back to Gaza as part of the <b>draw-down</b> of Australian forces in the Middle East and their return to Australia in response to Japan's entry into the war. The battalion embarked upon an American troop transport, USS West Point, in mid-March 1942, completing the voyage to Port Adelaide, via Fremantle, in just 19 days.|$|E

5|$|Concorde {{was bought}} into the navy and {{commissioned}} in the West Indies {{for a return to}} Britain later in the year, though her commander for this voyage is unknown. She arrived in Britain and was paid off in September at Chatham. With the end of the American War of Independence and the <b>draw-down</b> in the navy, Concorde was not brought into immediate service but remained laid up at Chatham until November 1790, when a great repair was begun by Wilson, of Frindsbury. The work, which cost a total of £18,259, was completed by April 1793, by which time the French Revolutionary Wars had broken out. She was fitted for service at Chatham between April and May 1793, at a cost of £6,600, and was commissioned in April under Captain Thomas Wells.|$|E
5|$|In 1991 the Base Realignment and Closure Commission {{recommended}} {{the closing of}} Fort Ord due to the escalating cost of living on the Central California coastline.

Meanwhile, as DCGS Graham was second only to Daly in the daily running of the Australian Army. During this time Graham unsuccessfully sought the retention of national service following the eventual Australian withdrawal from Vietnam, arguing that it was necessary to further expand the Regular Army. He later managed the <b>draw-down</b> of Australian forces in Vietnam, and played a leading role in shaping the post-war Army. Graham was appointed General Officer Commanding (GOC) Northern Command in 1973 and later Commander 1st Division. He subsequently filled the position of head of the Australian Defence Staff in London over the period 1974–76. Graham was made an Officer of the Order of Australia (AO) in the 1975 Queen's Birthday Honours. He retired in March 1977.|$|E

40|$|The {{value of}} stocks varies {{from day to}} day, both {{relative}} to each other but also due to collective movements of the overall market. These variations of the market presumably reflect the psychological state of the surrounding society as affected by current events. One illuminating way to monitor the consequences of stock market changes is to consider the typical waiting time needed for a price variation to reach a predetermined level. Through this procedure {{it has been found}} that there is an up-down asymmetry in the market index {{in the sense that the}} time span for a given gain level is about twice that of a loss of the same magnitude. Surprisingly, this feature is not observed for the case of individual stocks, which exhibit complete symmetry between gain and loss waiting times. The key problem thus is to understand how an index, like the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), can possess a gain-loss asymmetry, while the individual stocks from which it is composed, do not. To explain this, we introduce an asymmetric synchronous market model consisting of a number of randomly fluctuating stocks that occasionally synchronize their short term <b>draw-downs.</b> These synchronous events are parameterized by a ``fear factor'', that reflects the occurrence of dramatic external events which affect the financial market. This model explains empirical findings, indicating that synchronous events between (symmetric) stocks are an important ingredient in understanding the partly asymmetric stock index dynamics. In particular, it demonstrates that local single stock symmetry and global asymmetry in the index can be explained by occasional, shortly lived, synchronous <b>draw-downs</b> of the stocks in the index...|$|R
5|$|When the United States entered World War I in April 1917, {{the ship}} was tasked with {{training}} naval recruits for the expanding wartime fleet.

25|$|When {{river flow}} wasn't quite {{enough for two}} turbines, {{operation}} was cycled between running one and both turbines, based on a daily reservoir <b>draw-down</b> and refill cycle. The cycling was timed to meet peak electrical demands. That is, both turbines operated during hours of high electrical demand and the reservoir was drawn down. A single turbine operated during low electrical demand hours while the reservoir refilled. A similar cycle was used when inflow was less than enough for a single turbine. A weekly cycle was superimposed on the daily cycle that tended to draw down the reservoir during the week and allowed it refill during the weekend. In these cases, known as load factoring, the plant operated as a peaking plant. This mode of operation was greatly reduced through the 1980s and 1990s to appease lakefront cabin owners.|$|E

25|$|The phased {{withdrawal}} of the Gannet AEW, {{as part of the}} <b>draw-down</b> of fixed wing aviation in the Fleet Air Arm, led to a need for the Royal Air Force to take over the provision of Airborne Early Warning for the UK Air Defence Region.

40|$|There is {{a growing}} {{interest}} to restore Bay of Fundy salt marshes diked for agriculture. Marshes recovering for several decades from storm-breached dikes can serve as analogues for restored marshes. In this study I examine factors driving sub-surface hydrology and vegetation at recovering and reference Bay of Fundy salt marshes. In Fundy marshes, groundwater at channel edges is insensitive to tidal flooding (< 10 cm change in depth) and deep <b>draw-downs</b> (40 - 100 cm) occur. Sub-surface hydrology here differs from organogenic, microtidal marshes due to low saturated hydraulic conductivity, infrequent flooding of marsh interiors, and larger hydraulic gradients imposed at channel edges.

40|$|The current {{financial}} crisis {{has given rise}} to a new type of bank run, one that affects both the banks' assets and liabilities. In this paper we combine information from the commercial paper market with loan level data from the Survey of Terms of Business Loans to show that during the 2007 - 2008 financial crises banks suffered a run on credit lines. First, as in previous crises, we find an increase in the usage of credit lines as commercial spreads widen, especially among the lowest quality firms. Second, as the crises deepened, firms drew down their credit lines out of fear that the weakened health of their financial institution might affect the availability of the funds going forward. In particular, we show that these precautionary <b>draw-downs</b> are strongly correlated with the perceived default risk of their bank. Finally, we conclude that these runs on credit lines have weakened banks further, curtailing their ability to effectively fulfill their role as financial intermediaries.

40|$|PURPOSE: This {{technical}} note describes modifications of simulation models for growth of four submersed aquatic vegetation (SAV) types, greatly expanding their application potential. The modifications include {{descriptions of the}} vegetation responses to daily changes in current velocity and epiphyte shading, and accommodation of daily changes in water level. These models {{can be used to}} evaluate key environmental conditions in which SAV would persist under a variety of management scenarios within the watershed. The models are available as stand-alone versions, and can be used singly and in combination with hydrodynamic and sediment transport models. BACKGROUND: SAV {{plays an important role in}} aquatic ecosystems. Desirable species stabilize sediment, ameliorate transparency and regulate nutrient availability in the water column, and serve as habitat and food sources for invertebrates, fish, and waterfowl. Many SAV communities in freshwater and marine environments have experienced dramatic losses during the past three to five decades. Declines are attributed to decreases in water transparency due to anthropogenic influences, but often they have been attributed to other factors such as high water levels, extended <b>draw-downs,</b> changes in current velocity, and epiphyte shading, or t...|$|R
40|$|The {{measurement}} of performance {{is the cornerstone}} of the evaluation of an investment. Since the advent of modern finance theory, this task has been performed within the risk-return framework. While return is easy to define, the notion of risk is much more complex. The most used measure, namely the Sharpe ratio, assumes that the standard deviation of the return distribution provides the full description of risk. However, risk averse investors tend to strongly dislike negative returns and large <b>draw-downs.</b> They would even prefer to partly sacrifice positive returns in order to avoid negative ones. This asymmetric behaviour is not captured by the Sharpe ratio, which may be “gamed ” using simple derivative strategies (see Spurgin (2001)). As an alternative, the Sortino ratio has been advocated in order to capture the asymmetry of the return distribution. It replaces the standard deviation in the Sharpe ratio by the downside deviation which captures only the downside risk. However, higher moments are incorporated only implicitly. In this article, we present the advantages of two new performance measures which take into account higher moments.

Synchrotron FT-IR microspectroscopy of thin paint cross-sections maps metal carboxylate distributions at high spatial resolution and resolves broad concentration gradients and micrometer-scale phase separation of carboxylate species. Aluminum stearate, a common paint additive, is found to influence the distribution of zinc carboxylates more strongly than pigment composition or oil type. The presence of aluminum stearate results in higher concentrations and more pronounced separation of saturated C 16 and C 18 chain zinc carboxylates in the margin of paint nearest the polyester substrate. The presence of aluminum stearate in association with zinc oxide has a clear influence on zinc carboxylate formation and distribution, with potential implications for long term stability of vulnerable paintings...|$|R
