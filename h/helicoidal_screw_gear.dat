40|$|A grape mashing {{machine has}} been set up to use during the mashing process, that is able to operate in {{continuous}} way and to act with a pressure distribution in according to the oenological requirements. Besides the methodology used, it has allowed to design mashing machines with conic <b>helicoidal</b> <b>screws</b> that realize any preset pressure distribution required during the mashing process. The mashing work is performed by mean a device with conical screws with changing pitch, that cause on the elementary control volumes, with which they interact, a pressure increasing Dp that depended by the helicoidal surfaces geometry and by how it changed along the machine axis. Insofar it has been necessary to study of the conical helicoidal surfaces that interact with the control volume of the considered product, as well as, how these change along the machine axis. In such way it has been possible to determine both the pressure at which the control volume is submitted and the pressure gradient that is obtained along the machine axis. Insofar conical <b>helicoidal</b> <b>screws</b> with changing pitch have been examined and the elementary control volume that is ranged between the considered helicoidal surface, it has been studied, and following a “Lagrangian” procedure type, its characteristic has been studied during the rotatory - translatory motion that happened along the machine axis, determining the conical helicoidal geometry to use to mash the considered grapes according to the pressure distribution assigned during the operative phase...|$|R

50|$|The {{valve gear}} {{of the outside}} and inside sets of motion could each be {{separately}} reversed by its own <b>screw</b> <b>gear,</b> while each set also had its own independent regulators, injectors and feed pumps. The locomotive had steam brakes on all coupled wheels as well as both bogies, {{the first and last}} South African steam locomotive to be equipped with braked bogies. The coupled wheels and the rack engine's crank disks had separate hand brakes and the inside and outside piston pairs had separate counter-pressure air brakes. In addition, the locomotive had a combination ejector to work the train's vacuum brakes.|$|R
50|$|To {{negotiate}} sharp curves, {{both the}} first and fifth pairs of coupled wheels were flangeless. The cylinders were arranged outside the plate frame, while the Richardson balanced type slide valves were placed between the frames. The locomotive used saturated steam and was equipped with Allan straight link valve gear, which was reversed by hand-wheel and quick <b>screw</b> <b>gear.</b> Allan valve gear was chosen chiefly because it required less space than the more usual Stephenson lifting link gear and was simpler in construction. The trailing Bissel truck was of the Cartazzi type which allowed the axle some lateral movement.|$|R

25|$|A TEM {{stage is}} {{required}} {{to have the ability}} to hold a specimen and be manipulated to bring the region of interest into the path of the electron beam. As the TEM can operate over a wide range of magnifications, the stage must simultaneously be highly resistant to mechanical drift, with drift requirements as low as a few nm/minute while being able to move several μm/minute, with repositioning accuracy on the order of nanometers. Earlier designs of TEM accomplished this with a complex set of mechanical downgearing devices, allowing the operator to finely control the motion of the stage by several rotating rods. Modern devices may use electrical stage designs, using <b>screw</b> <b>gearing</b> in concert with stepper motors, providing the operator with a computer-based stage input, such as a joystick or trackball.|$|R

50|$|In the {{presence}} of a cross-wind, as the aircraft flies forward the wind will push it sideways, away from the drop point. The solution is to calculate the angle that the aircraft should fly in order to cancel out this drift, the difference between the course and the heading. Calculating the proper drift angle is a simple task of basic vector addition, and is commonly carried out on a circular slide rule like the E6B. This is a somewhat time consuming process. The CSBS solved this problem by reproducing the basic vector math in a mechanical system. The vectors that would normally be drawn by hand were duplicated in a series of <b>screws,</b> <b>gears</b> and sliding components. By dialling in the four inputs, altitude, airspeed, wind speed and wind direction, the mechanism moved the aiming pippers so they directly represented the required heading and range angle for the current airspeed and altitude.|$|R
50|$|Molded nylon {{is used in}} hair combs and {{mechanical}} parts such as machine <b>screws,</b> <b>gears</b> and other low- to medium-stress components previously cast in metal. Engineering-grade nylon is processed by extrusion, casting, and injection molding. Type 6,6 Nylon 101 {{is the most common}} commercial grade of nylon, and Nylon 6 is the most common commercial grade of molded nylon. For use in tools such as spudgers, nylon is available in glass-filled variants which increase structural and impact strength and rigidity, and molybdenum disulfide-filled variants which increase lubricity. Its various properties also make it very useful as a material in additive manufacturing; specifically as a filament in consumer and professional grade fused deposition modeling 3D printers. Nylon can be used as the matrix material in composite materials, with reinforcing fibers like glass or carbon fiber; such a composite has a higher density than pure nylon. Such thermoplastic composites (25% to 30% glass fiber) are frequently used in car components next to the engine, such as intake manifolds, where the good heat resistance of such materials makes them feasible competitors to metals.|$|R
