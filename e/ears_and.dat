5|$|All {{elephants}} {{have several}} distinctive features, {{the most notable}} {{of which is a}} long trunk or proboscis, used for many purposes, particularly breathing, lifting water, and grasping objects. Their incisors grow into tusks, which can serve as weapons and as tools for moving objects and digging. Elephants' large ear flaps help to control their body temperature. Their pillar-like legs can carry their great weight. African elephants have larger <b>ears</b> <b>and</b> concave backs while Asian elephants have smaller <b>ears</b> <b>and</b> convex or level backs.|$|E

5|$|Equines {{produce a}} number of vocalizations and noises. Loud {{snorting}} is associated with alarm. Squealing is usually made when in pain, but bachelors will also squeal while play fighting. The contact calls of equines vary from the whinnying and nickering of the horse, the barking of plains zebras, and the braying of asses and Grévy's zebras. Equines also communicate with visual displays and the flexibility of their lips allows them to make complex facial expressions. Visual displays also incorporate {{the positions of the}} head, <b>ears</b> <b>and</b> tail. An equine may signal an intention to kick by laying back its <b>ears</b> <b>and</b> sometimes lashing the tail. Flattened ears, bared teeth and abrupt movement of the heads may be used as threatening gestures, particularly among stallions.|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Primary Schneiderian papillomatosis of {{the middle}} <b>ear</b> <b>and</b> mastoid cavity is {{extremely}} rare. It is frequently associated with intermittent unilateral otorrhoea and mass in the middle <b>ear</b> <b>and</b> mastoid cavity. METHODS: Case presentation, symptoms, diagnostic criteria, management and literature review are discussed. CONCLUSION: Schneiderian papillomatosis is an important differential diagnosis of mass in the middle <b>ear</b> <b>and</b> mastoid cavity, and tinnitus as a presenting symptom has not been reported before.

5|$|The Russian Spaniel is a small, sturdy {{dog with}} a short, tight, silky coat with {{feathering}} on the <b>ears</b> <b>and</b> legs.

5|$|The U.S. Institute of Medicine (IOM) sets Estimated Average Requirements (<b>EARs)</b> <b>and</b> Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs), or Adequate Intakes (AIs) {{for when}} there is not {{sufficient}} information to set <b>EARs</b> <b>and</b> RDAs. Collectively the EARs, RDAs, AIs and ULs {{are referred to as}} Dietary Reference Intakes. The current AI for potassium for women and men ages 14 and up is 4700mg. AI for pregnancy equals 4700mg/day. AI for lactation equals 5100mg/day. For infants 0–6 months 400mg, 6–12 months 700mg, 1–13 years increasing from 3000 to 4500 mg/day. As for safety, the IOM also sets Tolerable upper intake levels (ULs) for vitamins and minerals, but for potassium the evidence was insufficient, so no UL established.|$|E

5|$|Campbell's dwarf hamster (Phodopus campbelli) is {{a species}} of hamster in the genus Phodopus. It was given its common name by Oldfield Thomas in honour of C. W.

It is distinguished from the closely related Djungarian hamster as it has smaller <b>ears</b> <b>and</b> no dark fur on its crown. Campbell's dwarf hamster typically has a narrow dorsal stripe compared to the Djungarian hamster and grey fur on the stomach.|$|E
5|$|Falco peregrinus madens, {{described}} by Ripley and Watson in 1963, {{is unusual in}} having some sexual dichromatism. If the Barbary falcon (see below) is considered a distinct species, it is sometimes placed therein. It {{is found in the}} Cape Verde Islands, and is non-migratory; it is endangered with only six to eight pairs surviving. Males have a rufous wash on crown, nape, <b>ears,</b> <b>and</b> back; underside conspicuously washed pinkish-brown. Females are tinged rich brown overall, especially on the crown and nape.|$|E
40|$|<b>Ear</b> <b>and</b> kernel rots {{can reduce}} yield, quality and feed value of grain. Toxins {{produced}} by the fungi in corn can also have serious implications on the end use of the grain.

The aim {{of this paper is}} to test health of mercantile maize seed belonging to different hybrids. Seed health testing was done using filter paper and nutritive media (PDA) method. Fungi from genera Fusarium, Penicillium, Aspergillus and Alternaria were isolated from tested corn seed by both methods. Two species from the genus Fusarium were found in the tested corn samples F. graminearum and F. monilirome.
