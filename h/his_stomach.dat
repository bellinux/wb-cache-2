6000|$|... "There's {{one thing}} I'll bet you," [...] he said, [...] "and {{it is that}} Mr. Butler is nothin' gay-hearted now in his fat days. He fed himself like that for years an' years, on a boy's stomach, an' I bet <b>his</b> <b>stomach's</b> none too good now for it." ...|$|R
6000|$|Bastin {{swallowed}} {{it every}} drop, murmuring something {{about taking a}} little wine for <b>his</b> <b>stomach's</b> sake, [...] "one of the Pauline injunctions, you know," [...] after which he was much more cheerful. Then we hunted about and found some more of the biscuits and other food with which we filled ourselves after a fashion.|$|R
5|$|Gilkeson {{resided in}} Romney for the {{majority}} of his life and was involved in most of the community's organizations as either a leader, officer, or stockholder. Gilkeson's son Henry Bell Gilkeson, Jr., died on November 16, 1901, from injuries sustained by falling against a piece of sharp iron, which penetrated <b>his</b> <b>stomach.</b> Gilkeson's wife, Mary Katherine, predeceased him in February 1910 following the effects of a surgical procedure she had undergone in Cumberland, Maryland.|$|E
5|$|In a {{makeshift}} hospital at Plateros, Scout Alfonso and Ranger Fisher were quickly put into surgery. The shrapnel {{was removed from}} Alfonso's abdomen, and {{he was expected to}} recover if returned to American lines. Fisher's shrapnel was also removed, but with limited supplies and widespread damage to both <b>his</b> <b>stomach</b> and intestines, it was decided more extensive surgery would need to be completed in an American hospital. Mucci ordered that an airstrip be built in a field next to Plateros so that a plane could airlift him to American lines. Some Scouts and freed prisoners stayed behind to construct the airstrip.|$|E
5|$|Mulder {{calls the}} medical {{examiner}} who tells him that Scully has taken Lyle Parker back to the ranch and that Parker's blood test has revealed his father's blood type in <b>his</b> <b>stomach.</b> Mulder and Tskany hurry to the Parker ranch. After firing on the creature which escapes unharmed, Mulder finds Scully hiding upstairs. They search for the creature, and as it lunges to attack them, Tskany shoots it. Scully expresses disbelief on seeing Parker’s body, saying that Parker was in the bathroom, sick, {{and then they were}} attacked by the mountain lion. But Tskany says that the lion is still in its cage.|$|E

5|$|Necrid's {{alternate}} appearance differs heavily, {{and features}} scaly, reddish–orange skin. Additional differences include teal eyes, black pants, {{and a blue}} jewel.

He wears a fauld on his abdomen, and bandages wrap around <b>his</b> <b>stomach.</b> A mask covers his face and is {{held in place by}} two straps around his head.|$|E
5|$|The corpse rotted quickly; the {{surgeons}} {{of the hospital}} refused to dissect it. Tessier, however, {{wanted to find out}} how Tarrare differed from the norm internally, and was also curious as to whether the gold fork was actually lodged inside him. At the autopsy, Tarrare's gullet was found to be abnormally wide and when his jaws were opened, surgeons could see down a broad canal into the stomach. His body was found to be filled with pus, his liver and gallbladder were abnormally large, and <b>his</b> <b>stomach</b> was enormous, covered in ulcers and filling most of his abdominal cavity.|$|E
5|$|The {{first case}} against Acton, before Mr. Baron Carter, {{was for the}} murder in 1726 of Thomas Bliss, a {{carpenter}} and debtor. Unable to pay the prison fees, Bliss had been left with so little to eat that {{he had tried to}} escape by throwing a rope over the wall, but his pursuers severed it and he fell 20feet into the prison yard. Wanting to know who had supplied the rope, Acton beat him with a bull's pizzle, stamped on <b>his</b> <b>stomach,</b> placed him in the hole (a damp space under the stairs), then in the strong room.|$|E

5|$|The next match {{featured}} Chris Benoit {{defending the}} United States Championship against Chavo Guerrero (accompanied by Vickie Guerrero). Before {{the bell rang}} to start the match, Chavo tried to attack Benoit, but as the match began, Benoit retaliated by delivering a clothesline. Benoit and Guerrero wrestled inconclusively until Benoit covered Chavo to try to pin him. Chavo managed to place his foot {{on top of the}} bottom rope, which forced Benoit to break the pin per official wrestling match rules. While Guerrero was lying on <b>his</b> <b>stomach,</b> Benoit applied the Sharpshooter, and made Chavo submit to retain the championship.|$|E
5|$|They {{maintained}} that the potassium tartrate used in his treatment prevented <b>his</b> <b>stomach</b> from expelling these compounds and that his thirst was {{a symptom of the}} poison. Their hypothesis was that the calomel given to Napoleon became an overdose, which killed him and left extensive tissue damage behind. According to a 2007 article, the type of arsenic found in Napoleon's hair shafts was mineral, the most toxic, and according to toxicologist Patrick Kintz, this supported the conclusion that he was murdered.|$|E
5|$|While on his journey, Nilkanth Varni {{mastered}} Astanga yoga (eightfold yoga) in {{a span of}} 9 months {{under the}} guidance of an aged yogic master named Gopal Yogi. In Nepal, it is said that he met King Rana Bahadur Shah and cured him of <b>his</b> <b>stomach</b> illness. As a result, the king freed all the ascetics he had imprisoned. Nilkanth Varni visited the Jagannath Temple in Puri as well as temples in Badrinath, Rameshwaram, Nashik, Dwarka and Pandharpur.|$|E

5000|$|We are {{compelled}} {{to conclude that the}} proceedings by which this conviction was obtained do more than offend some fastidious squeamishness or private sentimentalism about combatting crime too energetically. This is conduct that shocks the conscience. Illegally breaking into the privacy of the petitioner, the struggle to open his mouth and remove what was there, the forcible extraction of <b>his</b> <b>stomach's</b> contents — this course of proceeding by agents of government to obtain evidence is bound to offend even hardened sensibilities. They are methods too close to the rack and the screw to permit of constitutional differentiation.|$|R
5000|$|Belly Boing is {{constantly}} thinking of food. He likes eating sweets, {{and he can}} create a drum sound by pounding on <b>his</b> large <b>stomach.</b> When he walks he says [...] " [...] 1,2,3, boing.1,2,3,boing." ...|$|R
5|$|A Czech woman went to Heydrich's aid and flagged down a {{delivery}} van. He was first {{placed in the}} driver's cab, but complained the van's movement was causing him pain. He {{was placed in the}} back of the van, on <b>his</b> <b>stomach,</b> and taken to the emergency room at Bulovka Hospital. He had suffered severe injuries to his left side, with major damage to his diaphragm, spleen, and one of his lungs. He also had a fractured rib. A doctor, Slanina, packed the chest wound, while another doctor, Walter Diek, tried unsuccessfully to remove the splinters. He immediately decided to operate. This was carried out by Diek, Slanina, and Hohlbaum. Heydrich was given several blood transfusions. A splenectomy was performed. The chest wound, left lung, and diaphragm were all debrided and the wounds closed.|$|E
5|$|Although never gaining wide fame, Ali had a {{dedicated}} following on the vaudeville circuit in the United States. He performed for {{heads of state}} including Tsar NicholasII of Russia. Judy Garland named him her favorite vaudevillian and David Blaine identified Ali as his favorite magician. Portions of his act were captured in the short film Strange as It Seems (1930) and in Politiquerias (1931), the Spanish-language version of Laurel and Hardy's Chickens Come Home. Two documentaries contain footage of Ali taken from Politiquerias: 1977's Gizmo!, and 1999's Vaudeville. Ali's unusual gastric abilities led to rumors that the Rockefeller Institute had offered a large sum of money to obtain <b>his</b> <b>stomach</b> post-mortem. After he died in England, his body was offered to Johns Hopkins University for study, though the offer was declined.|$|E
5|$|At the office, Michael Scott (Steve Carell) announces to the {{employees}} that Deangelo Vickers (Will Ferrell) {{will be his}} co-host at the Dundies. The Dundies are an annual award program created by Michael to motivate his employees. The idea of performance is worrisome to Deangelo, but Michael insists he take the job. Michael brings some of the staff together {{in the conference room}} to help Deangelo get prepared for the show, but he struggles to be humorous. Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) tries to help him, saying he should just think of performing like conducting a meeting, but Michael objects, wanting Deangelo to mimic his style. Michael tries a number of different things to help Deangelo, such as sitting on <b>his</b> <b>stomach</b> and making him listen to a Walkman at full volume so he cannot hear himself think, but none are effective.|$|E

5|$|Bond {{travels to}} Kazan, Russia, where he finds Vesper Lynd's former lover, Yusef Kabira (Simon Kassianides), {{a member of}} Quantum who seduces women with {{valuable}} connections, and who is indirectly responsible for her death. Bond tells Kabira's latest target, Corrine Veneau (Stana Katic), a Canadian Intelligence agent, of his true intentions, thus sparing her Vesper's fate. He allows MI6 to arrest Kabira. Outside, M tells Bond that Greene {{was found dead in}} the middle of the desert, shot twice and with engine oil in <b>his</b> <b>stomach.</b> M tells Bond she needs him back; he responds that he never left. Walking away, he drops Vesper's necklace in the snow.|$|E
5|$|Charles XI {{had complained}} of stomach pains since 1694. In {{the summer of}} 1696, he asked his doctors for an opinion on the pain as it had {{continuously}} become worse, {{but they had no}} viable cure or treatment for it. He continued to perform his duties as usual, but, in February 1697, the pains became too severe for him to cope and he returned to Stockholm where the doctors discovered he had a large, hard lump in <b>his</b> <b>stomach.</b> At this point there was little the doctors could do except alleviate the King's pain as best they could. Charles XI died on 5 April 1697, in his forty-first year. An autopsy showed that the King had developed cancer and that it had spread through his entire abdominal cavity.|$|E
5|$|In Serbia, the {{government}} was again favourable towards the Bulgarian revolutionaries' aspirations and allowed them to establish in Belgrade the Second Bulgarian Legion, an organisation similar to its predecessor and its goals. Levski was a prominent member of the Legion, but between February and April 1868 he suffered from a gastric condition that required surgery. Bedridden, he could {{not participate in the}} Legion's training. After the Legion was again disbanded under political pressure, Levski attempted to reunite with his compatriots, but was arrested in Zaječar and briefly imprisoned. Upon his release he went to Romania, where Hadzhi Dimitar and Stefan Karadzha were mobilising revolutionary detachments. For various reasons, including <b>his</b> <b>stomach</b> problems and strategic differences, Levski did not participate. In the winter of 1868, he became acquainted with poet and revolutionary Hristo Botev and lived with him in an abandoned windmill near Bucharest.|$|E
