50|$|<b>Forage</b> <b>harvesters</b> can be {{implements}} {{attached to}} a tractor, or they can be self-propelled units. In either configuration, they have either a drum (cutterhead) or a flywheel {{with a number of}} knives fixed to it that chops and blows the silage out a chute of the harvester into a wagon that is either connected to the harvester or to another vehicle driving alongside. Most larger machines also have paddle accelerators to increase material speed and improve unloading characteristics. Once a wagon is filled up, the wagon can be detached and taken back to a silo for unloading, and another wagon can be attached. Because corn and grass require different types of cutting equipment, there are different heads for each type of silage, and these heads can be connected and disconnected from the harvester. Grass silage is usually cut prior to harvesting to allow it to wilt, before being harvested from swathes with a collection header (windrow pickup). Maize and whole crop silage are cut directly by the header, using reciprocating knives, disc mowers or large saw-like blades. Kernel processors (KP), modules consisting of two mill rolls with teeth pressed together by powerful springs, are frequently used when harvesting cereal crops like corn and sorghum to crack the kernels of these plant heads. Kernel processors are installed between the cutterhead and accelerator. In most <b>forage</b> <b>harvesters,</b> the KP can be quickly removed and replaced with a grass chute for chopping non-cereal crops.|$|E

50|$|A <b>forage</b> <b>harvester</b> (also {{known as}} a silage harvester, forager or chopper) is a farm {{implement}} that harvests forage plants to make silage. Silage is grass, corn or other plant that has been chopped into small pieces, and compacted together in a storage silo, silage bunker, or in silage bags. The silage is then fermented to provide feed for livestock. Haylage is a similar process to silage but using grass which has dried.|$|R
40|$|Master of AgribusinessDepartment of Agricultural EconomicsMajor Professor Not ListedSelf-propelled <b>forage</b> <b>harvesters</b> {{are used}} to make feed for livestock. Producers prefer forage made with these {{machines}} because {{they are able to}} deliver a feed value that enables improved productivity of their animals in terms of milk production for dairy animals and weight gain for beef animals. Self-propelled <b>forage</b> <b>harvesters</b> are able to make a variety of feed from different crops, including whole-plant corn silage, earlage, and haylage, among others. The self-propelled forage harvester is a complex and expensive piece of machinery for a producer to own. The self-propelled forage harvester market in the United States is a growing market, but small when compared to other equipment such as combines. In today’s environment, productivity is crucial {{to the success of the}} agricultural producer. Self-propelled <b>forage</b> <b>harvesters</b> are no exception. Growth of the self-propelled forage harvester market is reflected in increased unit sales, total horsepower sold, and average horsepower of the selfpropelled <b>forage</b> <b>harvesters</b> sold in the United States. This study looks at changes in the number and size of self-propelled <b>forage</b> <b>harvesters</b> being purchased and what factors might be driving those changes. This study found that the amount of milk produced, the type of customer purchasing the equipment, and the average price of milk a producer received explained 81. 2 % of the variation in the number of self-propelled <b>forage</b> <b>harvesters</b> sold from 2000 - 2014. Study results also show that the size of dairy operation, the type of customer purchasing the equipment, and the average price of milk explained 88 % of the variability in total horsepower of self-propelled <b>forage</b> <b>harvesters</b> sold from 2000 - 2014. Finally, the size of dairy operation that a typical cow comes from, the type of customer purchasing the equipment, and the average price of corn were able to explain 98 % of the variation of average horsepower of self-propelled <b>forage</b> <b>harvesters</b> over that same time period. The model and analysis will be shared with product planners from John Deere as they develop new machine specifications for self-propelled <b>forage</b> <b>harvesters</b> in the future...|$|E

40|$|Many field {{experiments}} {{require the}} collection of forage yields in addition to grain yield (small grains). ln smal! plot research, mechanized grain harvest is common. However, forage harvest is often accomplished by hand which is time consuming and labor intensive. Sample heterogeneity increases when forage harvest is obtained by hand. The objectives {{of this study were}} to construct a mechanized <b>forage</b> <b>harvester</b> that would simplify the harvesting process while providing a homogenous sample and to determine forage yield reduction associated with using the harvester compared to hand clipping at the soil surface. A John Deere GT 262 self propelled rotary mower was modified to be used for small plot wheat forage harvesting. Field trials were established at two locations to determine the yield reduction associated with using the <b>forage</b> <b>harvester</b> versus hand clipping at the soil surface. Significant differences in yield were found at both locations. The mean dry matter yield averaged over two years and two Iocations obtained using the harvester was 63. 1 % of that obtained by hand clipping at the soil surface during growth stages Feekes 6 and Feekes 10. Total N in wheat forage collected was significantly different using the harvester versus hand clipping. This is partially explained by decreased N in the lower stems at later stages of reproductive growth. The design of the harvester makes it possible to harvest several plots in {{a short amount of time}} while also allowing a larger area to be harvested which increases experimental accuracy and sample homogeneity. When the efficiency of the <b>forage</b> <b>harvester</b> (0. 631) is used as a correction factor, the difference between the estimated and actual amounts of forage present is S 4 o/" of the total forage present (Feekes 6 through Feekes 10) ...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} goals of precision farming is preparing yield map. Recently in Iran, planting of corn has received special attention. Therefore, among the different methods of yield measurement such as using impact sensor at the outlet port of <b>forage</b> <b>harvester</b> (chopper), displacement sensors at feed rollers of <b>forage</b> <b>harvester,</b> continuous measurement of discharged material to trailing wagon and using the torque meter, the present study made use of the torque meter method. This method consisted of a torque transmitting shaft equipped with laser-based encoders to monitor twist in a real time mode. The unit output could be exported to a computer via a microcontroller installed into the interface device. For calibration of the torque meter output with material feed rate in lab conditions, a conveyor was used to feed homogenous amount of material at a specific rate to the chopper. The experiment was conducted at 3 feed rates of silage corn and at 3 feed roll speeds of the chopper with 3 replications. Correlation between the feed rate and recorded power at different gears of the chopper was established. Relationships between feed rate and recorded power of the chopper at gears 1, 2 and 3 were linear with calculated R 2 of 0. 95, 0, 98 and 0. 98, respectively...|$|R
