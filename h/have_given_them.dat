5|$|Once safely {{established}} on Madagascar, with its limited mammalian population, the lemurs were {{protected from the}} increasing competition from evolving arboreal mammalian groups. Monkeys had evolved by the Oligocene, and their intelligence, aggression, and deceptiveness may <b>have</b> <b>given</b> <b>them</b> the advantage in exploiting the environment over the diurnal adapiform primates in Africa and Asia, ultimately driving them to extinction and leaving only the nocturnal lorisoids.|$|E

Following his departure, Spencer Chamberlain became lead vocalist. The band then released They're Only Chasing Safety and Define the Great Line, gaining a certified gold rating for both. These two albums <b>have</b> <b>given</b> <b>them</b> more mainstream and commercial success.|$|E
5|$|In 1549, Robert Kett led an {{uprising}} in Norfolk; marching on Norwich, his army camped on the north-east {{side of the}} river, overlooking Cow Tower. Two rebel attacks were then made across the river into the Hospital meadows, {{in an attempt to}} take Bishop Bridge, which would <b>have</b> <b>given</b> <b>them</b> access to the city. Kett had brought artillery, which he turned on the Cow Tower, damaging the latter's parapets. The rebellion failed, and the tower {{does not seem to have}} required extensive repairs.|$|E

However, amongst Corbyn supporters, 18% said that it <b>had</b> <b>given</b> <b>them</b> a more positive view of him, against 5% who said that it <b>had</b> <b>given</b> <b>them</b> a more negative view. The Independent suggested that this was due to Corbyn being seen to make a stand against an unpopular operator.|$|R

5|$|Allosaurus coexisted {{with fellow}} large theropods Ceratosaurus and Torvosaurus {{in both the}} United States and Portugal. The three appear to have had {{different}} ecological niches, based on anatomy {{and the location of}} fossils. Ceratosaurs and torvosaurs may have preferred to be active around waterways, and had lower, thinner bodies that would <b>have</b> <b>given</b> <b>them</b> an advantage in forest and underbrush terrains, whereas allosaurs were more compact, with longer legs, faster but less maneuverable, and seem to have preferred dry floodplains. Ceratosaurus, better known than Torvosaurus, differed noticeably from Allosaurus in functional anatomy by having a taller, narrower skull with large, broad teeth. Allosaurus was itself a potential food item to other carnivores, as illustrated by an Allosaurus pubic foot marked by the teeth of another theropod, probably Ceratosaurus or Torvosaurus. The location of the bone in the body (along the bottom margin of the torso and partially shielded by the legs), {{and the fact that it}} was among the most massive in the skeleton, indicates that the Allosaurus was being scavenged.|$|E
5|$|Crowds {{of people}} {{gathered}} in New York {{to witness the}} historic arrival, {{with tens of thousands}} of people crowding Battery Park in Manhattan to have a good view of the Statue of Liberty, where the aircraft was scheduled to touch down. Rumors circulated that L'Oiseau Blanc had been sighted along its route, in Newfoundland, or over Long Island. In France, some newspapers even reported that Nungesser and Coli had arrived safely in New York, evoking a wave of French patriotism. L'Oiseau Blanc had been carrying a sizable load of fuel, , which would <b>have</b> <b>given</b> <b>them</b> approximately 42 hours of flight time. After this time had passed, with no word as to the aircraft's fate, it was realized that the aircraft had been lost. In France, the public was scandalized by the newspapers such as La Presse which had printed false reports about the aircraft's arrival, and outrage was generated against the companies involved, with demonstrations in the streets.|$|E
5|$|The Austro-Hungarian assault {{began at}} Lazarevac, a {{strategically}} located town {{just south of}} Belgrade whose capture would <b>have</b> <b>given</b> <b>them</b> access to the Mladenovac railway line {{and the ability to}} outflank the Serbian forces holding the road to Belgrade. Further south, the Austro-Hungarians attacked the Serbian 1st Army. During this assault, they made the mistake of attacking its stronger right flank and were met with determined Serbian resistance which prevented them from gaining any ground. Military historian David Jordan notes that had the Austro-Hungarians attacked the junction splitting the 1st and Užice armies, they {{might have been able to}} split the Serbs down the centre and gotten hold of an unimpeded passage to the Morava River. The Serbian 1st Army was quick to reinforce its left flank, realizing that any subsequent attack against it would be far less easy to repel.|$|E

5|$|There {{were five}} of them, a {{somewhat}} exceptional number: William P. Halliday, Samuel B. Halliday, Edwin W. Halliday, Henry L. Halliday, and Thomas W. Halliday. Of them all, I may {{be permitted to}} say that while they all differed from each other, they all exhibited features of character and conduct that would <b>have</b> <b>given</b> <b>them</b> prominence anywhere in the business world. No doubt in some one or two important respects, each one excelled the others. This was shown in those matters and things to which they gave their chief attention. Speaking of them and their families, so well represented here with us and elsewhere, {{it can be said}} that they have always stood for better things, not with assumption or pharisaically, but openly and firmly. They pushed their business enterprises with diligence, and had there been more of such men it would have been better for the city and for them also, I have no doubt.|$|E

25|$|Unlike their pliosauroid cousins, plesiosauroids (with the {{exception}} of the Polycotylidae) were probably slow swimmers.

Crump took 8-142 from 76.3 overs in the game, conceding less than two runs an over, and was carried into the pavilion when the final Glamorgan wicket went down, having bowled unchanged in the second innings.|$|E
