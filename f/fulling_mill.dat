5|$|Above the village, on the Afon Daron, stands Bodwrdda, {{an early}} 16th-century stone-built house, {{which had a}} <b>fulling</b> <b>mill</b> adjacent; two large brick-built wings were added later, giving an {{imposing}} three-storey facade containing 17th century windows. To the south, Penrhyn Mawr is a substantial late-18th century gable-fronted farmhouse.|$|E
5|$|There was a <b>fulling</b> <b>mill</b> in {{the town}} by 1394 for the textile industry. After 1820 this {{expanded}} with the town becoming a centre for lace manufacture led by manufacturers who fled from the Luddite resistance they had faced in the English Midlands. Bowden's Old Lace Factory and the Gifford Fox factory are examples of the sites constructed. The Guildhall was built as a Corn Exchange and Guildhall in 1834 {{and is now the}} Town Hall.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of the Domesday Book in 1086 there were two mills in Dunster. One which was called the Lower Mill was {{on the site of the}} present mill. In the 17th century there were both malt and oats mills but by 1721 one of these had been {{converted}} to a <b>fulling</b> <b>mill.</b> The present mill, which was built around 1780 and replaced the two former mills. In 1940 a bakery was added. The mill ground corn until World War II and then animal feed until it closed in 1962.|$|E

5|$|There {{were few}} {{industrial}} buildings pre-1850; those of note include the 17th-century blast furnace at Pontygwaith {{which gave the}} village its name and the <b>fulling</b> <b>mill</b> established by Harri David in 1738, which in turn gave its name to Tonypandy. Corn mills existed sparsely throughout the valleys as did early coal pits, with two early pits recorded as being opened in 1612 at Rhigos and Cwmparc; though these would have mined from exposed rock in the hillside and not deep mined.|$|E
5|$|In 1664 {{the mill}} {{partially}} burned down. It was rebuilt and, {{in order to}} recover from the losses, the miller did not have to pay taxes for the next 15 years. In 1764 another fire destroyed the entire mill, according to an ordenance from the States General after the miller requested assistance. The mill was rebuilt {{with the addition of a}} second water wheel. The larger building was a gristmill and the smaller building an oil mill. In 1909 a sawmill was added to the larger building, and for a period the smaller building also acted as a <b>fulling</b> <b>mill.</b>|$|E
5|$|Local weavers {{specialised}} in {{the production}} of kersey, a hardwearing and inexpensive woollen fabric that was often used for military uniforms; by the 16thcentury Halifax and the surrounding Calder Valley was the largest producer of the material in England. In the final part of the manufacturing process the cloth was hung outdoors on large structures known as tenterframes and left to dry, after having been conditioned by a <b>fulling</b> <b>mill.</b> Daniel Defoe wrote a detailed account of what he had been told of the gibbet's history during his visit to Halifax in Volume 3 of his A tour thro' the whole island of Great Britain, published in 1727.|$|E
50|$|The {{village was}} the site of six <b>fulling</b> <b>mills</b> and was a site for copper mining.|$|R
50|$|Five <b>fulling</b> <b>mills</b> were {{established}} in the village between the 13th and 18th century to support the cloth making industry.|$|R
50|$|Steep-sided valleys with fast flowing streams {{provided}} {{power and}} {{water for the}} area's early mills and factories. Water-powered corn <b>mills</b> and <b>fulling</b> <b>mills</b> were use in medieval times and more <b>fulling</b> <b>mills</b> were built after the mid-16th century as the woollen industry grew. At {{the end of the}} 18th century, water powered mills were vital for industrial expansion of the textile industry, initially for spinning cotton, but subsequently for woollens and worsteds.|$|R
5|$|The last {{stretch of}} Hebden Beck {{before it reaches}} the River Wharfe was used to power a corn mill in the Middle Ages, and corn milling survived {{into the middle of}} the 19th century. In the 14th century Fountains Abbey had a <b>fulling</b> <b>mill</b> in the village. In 1791 a three-storey cotton mill was built {{alongside}} the corn mill. It housed 54 spinning frames and was productive until 1870 when it was driven out of business by the more efficient stream-driven machinery of the industrial revolution. At its peak, the mill employed more than 70 men, women, and children. The building was used for other purposes including a roller skating rink until it was demolished in 1967.|$|E
5|$|Continuing eastwards, {{the river}} is crossed by Iping Bridge at Iping, a narrow stone bridge with five arches dating from the seventeenth century. To {{the west of the}} bridge is the site of Iping watermill. A mill was {{recorded}} there in the Domesday survey, completed in 1086. By 1665, there were the remains of a <b>fulling</b> <b>mill</b> at the site, and a wheat-mill and malt-mill, both part of the same building. It became a paper mill in the eighteenth century, and continued to operate until it was destroyed by fire in 1930. At Stedham, part of the civil parish of Stedham with Iping, Stedham Lane crosses the river on a stone bridge with six segmental arches. Five of them date from the seventeenth century, with one later addition. The river then makes a large loop to the north, where Stedham Mill was situated. The mill building has been demolished, but the mill house is a listed structure. After the loop, Woolbeding Bridge, on the northern Edge of Midhurst, dates from the fifteenth or sixteenth centuries. It has four segmental arches, was restored in 1919, and is a grade II* listed structure.|$|E
5|$|Until the mid-18th century, {{the region}} in and around Chadderton was {{dominated}} by dispersed agricultural settlements. During this period the population was fewer than 1,000, broadly consisting of farmers who were involved with pasture, but who supplemented their incomes by working in cottage industries, particularly fustian and silk weaving. A <b>fulling</b> <b>mill</b> at Chadderton by the River Irk was recorded during the Elizabethan era, and during the Early Modern period the weavers of Chadderton had been using spinning wheels in makeshift weavers' cottages to produce woollens. Primitive early 18th-century industrialisation developed slowly in Chadderton. However, as the demand for cotton goods increased and the technology of cotton-spinning machinery improved during the mid-18th century, the need for larger structures to house bigger, better, and more efficient equipment became apparent. A water-powered cotton mill was built at Chadderton's Stock Brook in 1776. The damp climate below the South Pennines provided ideal conditions for textile production {{to be carried out}} without the thread drying and breaking, and newly developed 19th-century mechanisation optimised cotton spinning for industrial-scale manufacture of yarn and fabric for the global market. As the Industrial Revolution advanced, socioeconomic conditions in the region contributed to Chadderton adopting cotton spinning in the factory system, which became the dominant source of employment in the locality. The construction of multi-storey steam powered mills followed, which initiated a process of urbanisation and cultural transformation in the region; the population increasingly moved away from farming and domestic weaving in favour of the mechanised production of cotton goods.|$|E

25|$|Walk Mill weir {{supplied}} the Upper and Nether Walk mills and wheels. The Nether Walk mill {{is thought to}} have been the site of a <b>fulling</b> <b>mill</b> mentioned in 1332, and was still operating as a <b>fulling</b> <b>mill</b> in 1760, when there were also two cutlers wheels at the lower site and one at the upper. The use of water wheels ceased in 1853, and both sites were recorded as the Albion Iron and Steel Works in 1864. Burton Weir supplied Royds mill and wheels, which also operated on two sites, and included a corn mill and cutlers wheels. Steam power was used from 1860, although a redundant water wheel remained in situ until 1950.|$|E
25|$|From a {{group of}} small mills at Bridge End, John Wood built a complex of mills. Bridge End Mill was {{originally}} built in 1782 as a <b>fulling</b> <b>mill.</b> Today one mill building is being restored, and the Milltown mills lie idle.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are several}} Biblical {{references}} to fulling (2 Kings 18:17; Isaiah 7:3 and 36:2; Malachi 3:2; Mark 9:3). Prior to this, {{at least one}} reference appears in the speeches of Lysias, written in Athens during the 5th century BCE. The first references to <b>fulling</b> <b>mills</b> are reported in Persia.

25|$|In 1703, Benjamin Church, {{a hero of}} King Philip's War {{established}} a saw mill, grist mill, and a <b>fulling</b> <b>mill</b> on the Quequechan River. In 1714, Church sold his land, along with the water rights to Richard Borden of Tiverton and his brother Joseph. This transaction {{would prove to be}} extremely valuable 100 years later, helping to establish the Borden family as the leaders in the development of Fall River's textile industry.|$|E
25|$|By {{the middle}} ages Bradford, had become a small town centred on Kirkgate, Westgate and Ivegate. In 1316 there is mention of a <b>fulling</b> <b>mill,</b> a soke mill where all the manor corn was milled and a market. During the Wars of the Roses the {{inhabitants}} sided with House of Lancaster. Edward IV granted the right to hold two annual fairs and from this time the town began to prosper. In the reign of Henry VIII Bradford exceeded Leeds as a manufacturing centre. Bradford grew slowly over the next two-hundred years as the woollen trade gained in prominence.|$|E
25|$|The {{story of}} {{gunpowder}} production at Waltham Abbey {{begins with a}} <b>fulling</b> <b>mill</b> for cloth production; originally {{set up by the}} monks of the Abbey on the Millhead Stream, an engineered water course tapping the waters of the River Lea. Mills were adaptable and in the early 17th century it was converted to an 'Oyle Mill', i.e. for producing vegetable oils. In the Second Dutch War gunpowder supply shortages were encountered and the oil mill was converted to gunpowder production, possibly in response to this. In 1665 it was acquired by Ralph Hudson using saltpetre made in Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire.|$|E
