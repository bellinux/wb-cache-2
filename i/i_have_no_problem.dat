5|$|I was {{of course}} happy to meet the Hizbullah people, {{because it is a}} point of view that is rarely heard in the United States. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>problem</b> saying that I do want to express {{solidarity}} with them, and I am {{not going to be a}} coward of (sic) a hypocrite about it. I don't care about Hizbullah as a political organization. I don't know much about their politics, and anyhow, it's irrelevant. I don't live in Lebanon. It's a choice that the Lebanese have to make: Who they want to be their leaders, who they want to represent them. But there is a fundamental principle. People have the right to defend their country from foreign occupiers, and people have the right to defend their country from invaders who are destroying their country. That to me is a very basic, elementary and uncomplicated question.|$|E
500|$|The {{day before}} Folie à Deux arrived in stores (December 15), Fall Out Boy had planned on staging an impromptu concert in New York City's Washington Square Park. However, the band did not obtain {{a permit to}} do so. Taking {{inspiration}} from Bob Dylan and similar folk singers from the 1960s, the group {{wanted to do something}} free and spontaneous as a gift to fans. The band and its management argued with the NYPD about allowing the show to go on. In the end, they were told that picking up any instruments would earn them a trip to jail, so the band instead led the audience in a sing-along. Stump sang while Wentz and Trohman played air guitar and Hurley drummed on his knees. Stump later commented in an interview that [...] "Those cops back there—and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>problem</b> with the cops, trust me—but those cops were like the Grinch. They just took all the presents." ...|$|E

Do you want me to be a female Pembleton?' And they were like, 'Well we don't want to say that but that's sort of the idea." [...] Thorne said the producers were looking for [...] "a certain type in terms of a strong woman who could keep up with all the men" [...] and that they incorporated elements of Thorne's own personality into the character, such as the strong amount of trust she has in her instincts. Thorne also said she was treated well by the cast, but upon starting, [...] "I was very aware of the fact that it's predominantly men, and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>problem</b> saying that as a small, dark woman I was terrified. I thought I was going to be put through the ringer." [...] Gerety, when asked about his experience joining the show, said only, [...] "It's interesting. It's really interesting." ...|$|E

It is very boyish. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>problems</b> in my mind then, but it is worth while. I am going to rewrite it and send it on to you, for I can't be idle. I believe you'll like it. It is a love drama pure and simple." ...|$|R
500|$|Sunderland lost 1–0 away to Manchester City on 5 November after a goal from Stephen Ireland. Manager, Roy Keane, {{expressed}} his frustration in a post match interview saying [...] "We didn't deserve anything. I don't feel we did {{enough to get}} {{anything out of the}} game. I don't think their keeper had too many saves to make, did he?". 10 November was the first Tyne–Wear derby of the season. Danny Higginbotham put Sunderland into the lead shortly after half time, but James Milner drew Newcastle level on the 68th minute after his cross beat goalkeeper Craig Gordon into the far post. Sunderland had a chance to win the game when ex-Newcastle forward Michael Chopra headed against the bar minutes from full-time. Sunderland ended the month on a low as they were beaten 7–1 away to Everton on 24 November. Dwight Yorke scored Sunderland's only goal just before half time. Roy Keane said [...] "It's hard to take, but we lose as a team and I picked the team and sorted the tactics so <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>problem</b> taking responsibility for what happened." ...|$|E
2500|$|Sometimes {{criticized by}} rivals for his {{perceived}} levels of wealth, Bajatović once remarked, [...] "I am a Socialist, but I {{do not want}} to be a social case." [...] On another occasion, he said, [...] "I have no doubt that I am one of the most strongly attacked and criticized figures in the country, who is believed to be immensely rich. Sometimes I am accused of being overbearing because I am opinionated and do not flinch from expressing my views. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>problem</b> with all the criticism nor the harsh accusations in some media against me. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>problem</b> with my big mouth either." ...|$|E
2500|$|I was not {{involved}} in the struggle for gay rights as a youth. ...I did not [...] "come out of the closet" [...] voluntarily—circumstances forced me out. While <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>problem</b> with being publicly identified as homosexual, it would be dishonest of me to present myself as one who was in the forefront of the struggle for gay rights. ...I fundamentally consider sexual orientation to be a private matter. As such, it has not been a factor which has greatly influenced my role as an activist.|$|E
5000|$|In 1953, Sheets joined Kiwanis International; in 1965, {{he served}} {{a year as}} {{governor}} of the Missouri-Arkansas District during the golden anniversary of the organization. After he made a Kiwanis presentation to Democratic Governor Orval Faubus, Sheets encountered Faubus on several occasions while Faubus was selling individual copies of his scrapbook memoirs, Down from the Hills: <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>problems</b> with Faubus. He was amicable. Many {{of the things he}} did were what the people of Arkansas then wanted." ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{terms of}} the film's ending, Flynn {{revealed}} that she experimented with a [...] "lot of iterations". One of the aspects that she was certain of was {{the presence of the}} media, which she described as the [...] "third player", alongside Nick and Amy. In Flynn's words: [...] "Once we got to the ending, I wanted it to wrap up quickly. I didn't want 8 million more loop-de-loops... <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>problem</b> tossing stuff out {{and trying to figure out}} the best way to get there." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{sale and}} format change of KKDA-AM stirred {{negative}} {{criticism from the}} station's loyal listeners in the African American community. Dallas City Councilman Dwaine Caraway, who regularly listened to Willis Johnson's morning show on KKDA-AM, said: “This is stripping the voice. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>problems</b> with Koreans at all, but {{as it relates to}} African Americans, this man made millions and to say nothing to us at all?", indicating the loss of Soul 730 had silenced a powerful outlet. Service Broadcasting kept its profitable FM Hip-Hop counterpart, KKDA-FM (K104), but that failed to appease the AM station's listeners.|$|R
2500|$|Although {{her first}} name is Kate, she chooses to go by KT, saying [...] " [...] just {{makes me think of}} a buxom lass baking bread for her man working in the fields. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>problem</b> with that, but it's just not really how I pictured being a rock star." [...] Also, Tunstall spells {{her first name}} KT (as opposed to Katie) to {{differentiate}} herself from fellow singer Katie Melua. She also asserted that she derived [...] "KT" [...] from K-T impact, the name of a geological event that caused extinction of dinosaurs.|$|E
2500|$|In {{a speech}} given at Brooklyn College in 2013 with BDS {{founding}} member Omar Barghouti, prominent American academic Judith Butler {{commented on the}} reasons behind her support of the academic boycott campaign of the BDS movement stating: [...] "Others may interpret the boycott differently, but <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>problem</b> collaborating with Israeli scholars and artists {{as long as we}} do not participate in any Israeli institution or have Israeli state monies support our collaborative work. The reason, of course, is that the academic and cultural boycott seeks to put pressure on all those cultural institutions that have failed to oppose the occupation and struggle for equal rights and the rights of the dispossessed, all those cultural institutions that think it is not their place to criticize their government for these practices, all of them that understand themselves to be above or beyond this intractable political condition." ...|$|E
2500|$|Not all {{settlers}} {{were born}} Jewish; in summer 2002, Peruvian Indians left huts and were welcomed into new trailer homes in this Judean hills settlement. Although these former Christians have taken Hebrew names, {{they do not}} yet know the difference between Herzl and Hamas. The [...] "Inca Jews" [...] already have been taught the [...] "holy trinity": the Torah, the People, the Land. And they call the West Bank of the Jordan river by its Biblical names, Judea and Samaria. [...] "We knew we were coming to a place called 'territories' because we know other Peruvians who immigrated earlier and are living in the settlements," [...] said a kippa-wearing convert who carried a Spanish-Hebrew prayer book. [...] "But <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>problem</b> because I don't consider the territories to be occupied.

5000|$|Huff {{enrolled}} at the University of Michigan on a football scholarship in 1967. He played fullback for the freshman team in 1967, but switched to linebacker in his sophomore year. He recalled the transition from fullback to linebacker as follows:"As a freshman you were there to be meat. One day in practice I'm playing fullback and, when I {{go out for a}} pass, this little linebacker named Dennis Morgan who had forearms like Popeye just about ripped my head off. Right then and there I said 'I want to be that guy, not this guy.' <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>problem</b> switching to linebacker." ...|$|R
500|$|Blender asked Bowie in 2002 {{whether he}} still {{believed}} his public declaration was his biggest mistake. After a long pause, he said, [...] "I don't {{think it was}} a mistake in Europe, but it was a lot tougher in America. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>problem</b> with people knowing I was bisexual. But <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> inclination to hold any banners nor be a representative of any group of people." [...] Bowie said {{he wanted to be a}} songwriter and performer rather than a headline for his bisexuality, and in [...] "puritanical" [...] America, [...] "I think it stood in the way of so much I wanted to do".|$|R
5000|$|Waild {{added that}} {{with the death of}} Jackie Vance [...] "the tragedy of Ziva and Eli now also extends into the Vance family. Fitting, I think, given Eli and Vance were 'forged in blood.'" [...] The killings {{continue}} the season's theme of fallen heroes. When questioned about the choice to kill off two characters in the same episode, particularly one that was not a finale or set during sweeps Glasberg responded, [...] "I don't necessarily see that as ruthless. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>problems</b> coming up with stuff that keeps audiences on their toes." [...] He concluded that he was very pleased with the final product.|$|R
2500|$|On December 16, 2015, Buffett {{endorsed}} Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton for president. On August 1, 2016, Buffett challenged Donald Trump {{to release}} his tax returns. On October 10, 2016, after another reference {{to him in}} the 2nd 2016 presidential debate, Buffett released his own tax return. He said he had paid $1.85 million in federal income taxes in 2015 on an adjusted gross income of $11.6 million, meaning he had an effective federal income tax rate of around 16 percent. [...] Buffett also said he had made more than $2.8 billion worth of donations last year. Buffett said, [...] "I have been audited by the IRS multiple times and am currently being audited. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>problem</b> in releasing my tax information while under audit. Neither would Mr. Trump -- at least he would have no legal problem." [...] This was a measured response to Trump saying he was unable to release his tax information due to being under audit.|$|E
2500|$|In addition, Hart {{states in}} Hitman, that while conversing with Michaels: [...] "I added, 'I also {{want you to}} know that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>problem</b> {{dropping}} the belt to you if that's what Vince wants.' He glared back at me. 'I appreciate that, but I {{want you to know}} that I'm not willing to do the same for you.' And then he left. Jim [...] snorted, 'I can't believe that he just said that.' There was no way I could ever drop the belt to him now: he'd just shown complete disrespect not only to me, but to the position of champion..." [...] This exchange is confirmed in Dave Meltzer's account: [...] "During the meeting, Hart told Michaels that he'd be happy to put him over at the end of the run, but Michaels told Hart flat-out that he wouldn't return the favor. Michaels and Hart spoke again on the subject on 10/12 in San Jose, when once again Michaels told Hart that he wasn't going to do a job for him." [...] Additionally, in Forgiven Vince Russo stated, [...] "Well - no surprise here - Bret refused to do the job (get pinned) for Shawn in Canada. Not because he was being unprofessional - but because according to Bret, Michaels had said that he wouldn't do business with him (the right thing for the company in the ring), due to the way he felt about him." ...|$|E
5000|$|Butt {{has argued}} that Muslims in Britain should have no {{allegiance}} to Britain, saying, [...] "I feel absolutely nothing for this country. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>problem</b> with the British people...but if someone attacks them, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>problem</b> with that either." ...|$|E
2500|$|Guide Anatoli Boukreev's {{decision}} not to use bottled oxygen was sharply criticised by Jon Krakauer. Boukreev's supporters (who include G. Weston DeWalt, who co-wrote The Climb) state that using bottled oxygen gives {{a false sense of}} security. Krakauer and his supporters point out that, without bottled oxygen, Boukreev could not directly help his clients descend. They state that Boukreev said that he was going down with client Martin Adams, but just below the south summit, Boukreev determined that Adams was doing fine on the descent and so descended at a faster pace, leaving Adams behind. Adams states in The Climb, [...] "For me, it was business as usual, Anatoli's going by, and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>problems</b> with that." ...|$|R

5000|$|The opening {{titles of}} the film credit the story and {{screenplay}} only to Patrizi, the film was rewritten by Valerii and Ernesto Gastaldi. Valerii commented {{that he did not}} remember Patrizi's script word-for-word, but described it as [...] "extremely basic, whereas Gastaldi and I deepened it. We established the essential themes to develop, introduced the character played by Fernando Rey, the banker who is also the assassination's mandator, and so on." [...] Gastaldi stated that [...] "Patrizi's treatment was simply thrown in the bin, but the producer had signed a contract with him which stated that he was to be credited as the sole author of the script. Since I didn't care about my name in the titles, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>problem</b> writing the script and not signing it." ...|$|R

It was fast and quite stable while I was using it. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>problems</b> running any applications and {{the system as a}} whole lived up to its reputation as a great choice for Ubuntu minimalists... The LXDE desktop environment is very different than Unity for Ubuntu or GNOME 3 in Ubuntu GNOME. It’s a traditional desktop which means it’s very quick and easy to learn how to use. And if you are someone that doesn’t like Unity or GNOME then LXDE in Lubuntu 14.04 LTS might be just what the doctor ordered. You’ll get all the benefits of Ubuntu, but without the discomfort of the Unity interface." ...|$|R

5000|$|In {{the liner}} notes for The Complete Global Albums Collection, Mathis commented {{on two of}} the songs he chose. [...] "For this album, I decided to record the 'Hallelujah Chorus' and the 'Carol of the Bells'—I just sang my part, the part that all the tenors sing in these {{particular}} compositions. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>problem</b> about doing it. My only concern was how I would get my voice to be predominant if I sang only one part of the melody." [...] (Mathis is given adaptation credit for these two songs.) [...] He continued, [...] "You know, when you’re young, nothing frightens you. The fact that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> sung these songs in school for years, with all kinds of choirs, I thought, why not, let’s do it.
