25|$|Almodóvar {{achieved}} {{international recognition}} for his black comedy-drama film Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown (1988), which {{was nominated for}} the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, {{and went on to}} more success with the dark romantic comedy film Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down! (1990), the melodrama High Heels (1991) and the romantic drama thriller Live Flesh (1997). His subsequent two films won an Academy Award each: All About My Mother (1999) received the award for Best Foreign Language Film while Talk to Her (2002) earned him the award for Best Original Screenplay. Almodóvar followed this with the drama Volver (2006), the romantic thriller Broken Embraces (2009), the psychological thriller The Skin <b>I</b> <b>Live</b> <b>In</b> (2011) and the drama Julieta (2016), all of which were in competition for the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival.

Desire, passion, family, and identity are among Almodóvar's most prevalent themes.|$|E
500|$|... "Under the Bridge" [...] {{has been}} covered several times since its release in 1992. The song was first {{transcribed}} in 1994 by the a cappella group The Flying Pickets from their album The Original Flying Pickets: Volume 1. Notable jazz musician Frank Bennett covered the song by fusing elements of big bands and bebop in his 1996 album Five O'Clock Shadow. Hip hop artist Mos Def included the beginning verse of [...] "Under the Bridge" [...] {{in the song}} [...] "Brooklyn," [...] from his 1999 record Black on Both Sides. He, however, changed the line [...] "the city <b>I</b> <b>live</b> <b>in,</b> the City of Angels", which refers to Los Angeles, to [...] "the city <b>I</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> is beautiful Brooklyn," [...] to match his song's premise. Tony Hadley covered the song on his 1995 album Obsession. Britain's Royal Philharmonic Orchestra has modified [...] "Under the Bridge" [...] at several concerts—they perform various rock pieces combined into a single orchestral ensemble, often including the Chili Peppers' hit.|$|E

500|$|Nandini Ramnath, {{writing for}} the website Scroll.in, noted that Moondram Pirai {{contains}} elements common in Balu Mahendra's other films: [...] "realism, evocative and naturalistic cinematography, strong performances, and psychosexual themes that drive the characters to make unusual and often tragic choices." [...] Hari Narayan of The Hindu compared Moondram Pirai to another Haasan film, Guna (1991). In both narratives, the protagonist’s image of an ideal dreamgirl animate his antics. Cheenu, according to Narayan, [...] "looks like a melange of [...] Keats’ tragedy and [...] Freud’s psychoanalysis." [...] Narayan explains the idea of Cheenu keeping Bhagyalaskhmi with him not only {{as an act of}} sympathy and love, but also with the intention to preserve her like a portrait. Narayan also states that the character, Robert Ledgard's (Antonio Banderas) attraction to Vera Cruz (Elena Anaya) in Pedro Almodóvar's Spanish film The Skin <b>I</b> <b>Live</b> <b>In</b> (2011), is similar to Cheenu's attraction to Bhagyalakshmi. When Bhagyalakshmi recovers her memory and forgets him, Cheenu is hesitant to come back to his quiet existence, realising that in reality, dreams feel like its antithesis.|$|E
500|$|In the lyrics, Lo compares {{falling in}} love to being under the {{influence}} of drugs. Regarding the track's composition, she stated that [...] "all of the verses are drug references. It is comparing a high to being in love, which I think can be kind of the same thing". According to Scandipop, the artist is saying in the lyrics that [...] "no – she's not on drugs, it's all that amazing love she's in which is making her so high". Carrie Battan of Pitchfork wrote that Lo insists [...] "she's back on her feet and reaching for the stars—she's not on drugs, she's just in love" [...] in the verse, [...] "I'm up with the kites in a dream so blue / <b>I</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> the sky / You come live here, too". The line, [...] "I'm queen of the clouds, make my wish come true" [...] served as the inspiration for the title of the singer's debut album. Both Tim Jonze of The Guardian and Jamieson Cox of Time noted that the track's message contrasted that of [...] "Habits (Stay High)", in which the artist sings about using drugs in order to forget her former boyfriend.|$|E
500|$|In April 1930 Gielgud {{finished}} the season playing Hamlet. Williams's production used the complete {{text of the}} play. This {{was regarded as a}} radical innovation; extensive cuts had been customary for earlier productions. A running time of nearly five hours did not dampen the enthusiasm of the public, the critics or the acting profession. Sybil Thorndike said, [...] "I never hoped to see Hamlet played as in one's dreams... I've had an evening of being swept right off my feet into another life – far more real than the life <b>I</b> <b>live</b> <b>in,</b> and moved, moved beyond words." [...] The production gained such a reputation that the Old Vic began to attract large numbers of West End theatregoers. Demand was so great that the cast moved to the Queen's Theatre in Shaftesbury Avenue, where Williams staged the piece with the text discreetly shortened. The effect of the cuts was to give the title role even more prominence. Gielgud's Hamlet was richly praised by the critics. Ivor Brown called it [...] "a tremendous performance... the best Hamlet of [...] experience." [...] James Agate wrote, [...] "I have no hesitation whatsoever in saying that it is the high water-mark of English Shakespearean acting of our time." ...|$|E

500|$|Kiedis' {{feelings}} of alienation from his bandmates {{led him to}} feel that the city of Los Angeles was his only companion: [...] "I felt an unspoken bond between me and my city. I'd spent so much time wandering through the streets of L.A. and hiking through the Hollywood Hills that I sensed there was a nonhuman entity, maybe the spirit of the hills and the city, who had me in her sights and was looking after me." [...] The lines [...] "Sometimes I feel like / My only friend / Is the city <b>I</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> / The City of Angels / Lonely as I am / Together we cry" [...] show a direct link to Kiedis' isolation and sense of susceptibility. Despite these emotions, Kiedis believed that his life was better without drugs, telling Rolling Stone that [...] "no matter how sad or lonely I got, things were a million percent better than they were two years earlier when I was using drugs all the time. There was no comparison." [...] The optimistic ideology gave birth to the chorus of the song: [...] "I don't ever want to feel / Like I did that day / Take me to the place I love", [...] "the place" [...] meaning his bandmates, friends, and family.|$|E

500|$|Feeder {{returned}} to the studio to record their fifth album Pushing the Senses. The album was seen by Grant as more of an extension to Comfort in Sound, as it focused on the same lyrical themes and musical styles, and also said that it had more of an organic sound, with more upbeat tracks added into the mix. It also seen a number of piano driven tracks, with [...] "Frequency" [...] being an example. [...] "Frequency" [...] was produced by Coldplay producer Ken Nelson, while {{for the rest of}} the album, Gil Norton was on production duties. Grant told Kerrang! in May 2004, [...] "I've done some recording on my own in a little studio up by where <b>I</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> North London. I demo the album in its full form before the rest of the band play on it. Its difficult to know at this stage what it will turn out like, but so far its slightly more mature sounding". Grant later added [...] "Each album is a journey and a reflection of the past, there is some stuff that touches on what has happened, but there are songs about love, songs of loss and songs about the future. I don't want to give too much away but there's one track called [...] "Bitter Glass". Its quite dark but uplifting too. Its about pulling yourself out of a big hole".|$|E

500|$|The {{film has}} {{influenced}} {{a number of}} European films since its release. Spanish director Jesús Franco created films throughout his career that were influenced by the film. Franco's first was the Spanish and French co-production of Gritos en la noche (1962). Franco's variation of the film concerns the efforts of a mad surgeon, Dr. Orloff, to reconstruct {{the face of his}} disfigured daughter Melissa. Inspector Edgar Tanner investigates Orlof using his girlfriend, Wanda Bronsky, as an undercover spy. Franco followed with several sequels to Gritos en la noche. He made one more film strongly influenced by the Franju film, Faceless (1988). Faceless has a similar plot involving beautiful women who are abducted by Dr. Flamand's (Helmut Berger) female assistant and kept hostage. The doctor uses the skin of the women to perform plastic surgery on his disfigured sister, but the experiments leave the victims mutilated and dead. The Italian film Atom Age Vampire (1961) was also influenced by Eyes Without a Face with a doctor attempting to take the faces of other women to repair his daughter's face. These homages are seen in the plot line of a police lieutenant who is investigating the circumstances behind the death of a young girl whose body has scars around the eyes. The lieutenant's investigation eventually leads him to a plastic surgery clinic, a similar plot motivation to Eyes Without a Face. The British film Corruption (1968), starring Peter Cushing [...] adds a variation to the theme: a surgeon tries to restore his fiancée's beauty by repeatedly treating her with fluids extracted from the pituitary glands of murdered female victims. Spanish director Pedro Almodóvar has stated his 2011 film The Skin <b>I</b> <b>Live</b> <b>In,</b> which features a mad scientist who performs skin grafts and surgeries on an unwilling victim, was heavily influenced by Franju's Eyes without a Face.|$|E
500|$|According to MTV News, {{the song}} [...] "touches on Drake {{reaction}} to fame and stardom". Drake told MTV News, that {{the song was}} [...] "definitely" [...] a choice of his for releasing as a single, {{and that it was}} a song he did for himself. [...] Brad Wete of Entertainment Weekly called the song, [...] "a prideful track about a guy who fought for notoriety, gained it, and now struggles with what comes with it: criticism, groupies, and the pressure of expected greatness." [...] The song makes heavy use of an orchestral backdrop, while Drake delivers confident, aggressive raps in a paced fashion. Drake makes references to film critics Roger Ebert & Richard Roeper, as well as actress Jada Pinkett Smith and her 1996 film, Set It Off. According to Michael Craggg of MusicOMH, the song contains three hooks. Several lines in the second verse are actually a flip of hip-hop group Dead Prez's [...] "Hip-Hop", from their 2000 debut, Let's Get Free. Ironically, Dead Prez's track is meant as a jab at media controlled artists like Drake, stating, [...] "One thing about music when it hits you feel no pain/ White folks say it controls your brain/ I know better than that/ It's just game", to which Drake stated when asked about it, [...] "I love that flow. So I took that flow and flipped it in the second verse." [...] He also references Michael Jackson's iconic attire in his [...] "Thriller" [...] video, though the lines, [...] "'Bout to go 'Thriller' Mike Jackson on these niggas/ All I need is a fucking red jacket with some zippers." [...] On the reference, Drake said, [...] "That was sort of my reference point; that phenomenon of Michael. He was young and had the world excited and anticipating his every move. That was my homage to him and the impact that he had on the world that <b>I</b> <b>live</b> <b>in.</b> It's also ... great for people to say. Especially, unfortunately what happened to him, just to honor him was great." ...|$|E
