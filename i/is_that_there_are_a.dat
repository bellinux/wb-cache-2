25|$|Little {{evidence}} supports the claimed effectiveness of zero-tolerance policies. One underlying problem <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> great {{many reasons why}} people hesitate to intervene, or to report behavior they find to be unacceptable or unlawful. Zero-tolerance policies address, at best, {{only a few of}} these reasons.|$|E
25|$|The blade {{geometry}} {{was highly}} {{variable in the}} tests, so {{it is likely that}} the negative dependence of the dimensionless force on Reynolds number is the major factor. This whistle has two features that separate it from the other whistles described here. The first <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> multiplicity of these dipole sources arrayed around the periphery, that most likely are radiating at the same frequency, but incoherently. The second is that blade motion creates a steady, but rotating, pressure field at each blade. The rotating steady force creates a rotating dipole field which has an influence in the geometric near field. The feedback is Class I (hydrodynamic) and there is no indication that stages other than Stage 1 occur.|$|E
2500|$|The {{names of}} the units of measure used in the metric system consist of two parts - a unit name (for example [...] "metre", [...] "gram", [...] "litre") and an {{associated}} multiplier (for example [...] "milli" [...] meaning , [...] "kilo" [...] meaning 1000). The result <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> variety of different named units available to measure the same quantity (for example 10 millimetres = 1 centimetre, 100 centimetres = 1 metre, 1000 metres = 1 kilometre). Each unit and each prefix has a symbol (not abbreviation) associated with it.|$|E

2500|$|Hillary Clinton {{described}} the remarks as [...] "elitist, out of touch, and frankly patronizing." [...] Noting {{he had not}} chosen his words well, Obama subsequently explained his remarks, [...] "Lately {{there has been a}} little typical sort of political flare-up, because I said something that everybody knows is true, which <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> whole bunch of folks in small towns in Pennsylvania, in towns right here in Indiana, in my hometown in Illinois, who are bitter." [...] Obama had addressed similar themes in a 2004 interview with Charlie Rose, and his strategists countered that Bill Clinton had made similar comments in 1991.|$|E
2500|$|An on-line abuse panel (itself {{the subject}} of controversy) at the 2016 SXSW festival {{said that there was}} no {{technological}} {{solution to the problem of}} harassment given human nature; although policy changes have been made, the larger issue is more societal than platform-specific. Referring to the discussion at SXSW in a speech for Women's History Month, President of the United States Barack Obama said that [...] "We know that women gamers face harassment and stalking and threats of violence from other players. When they speak out about their experiences, they're attacked on Twitter and other social media outlets, even threatened in their homes." [...] Obama urged targets of harassment to speak out, praising the courage of those who had resisted online harassment. [...] "And what's brought these issues to light <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> lot of women out there, especially young women, who are speaking out bravely about their experiences, even when they know they'll be attacked for it".|$|E

Winter's not far off, and I can't spend very much time over this search. As soon as the man we put in charge of the mine has tried his present system long enough to give us {{something}} to figure on, I want to see {{what can be done to}} increase our output. We haven't marketed very much refined metal yet." ...|$|E

50|$|Psalm 150 is a psalm in the Hebrew Bible/Old Testament. In it, {{the writer}} urges the {{congregation}} to praise God {{with music and}} dancing.

50|$|One belief <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> {{total of}} nine types of Datuks, {{and that each}} of them were once great warriors and expert in Malay local martial arts, the Silat except for the last Datuk. They were also known to possess great magical powers. Worshippers usually pray to Datuks for protection, good health, and good luck, and {{sometimes}} seek divine help to overcome their problems.|$|E

50|$|Yacht {{transport}} generally eliminates costly, time consuming, {{and dangerous}} difficult ocean crossings, opening up cruising to more people. Container cruising, one approach to yacht transport, is significantly {{less expensive and}} has greater flexibility with respect to timing and destinations. The drawback to container cruising <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> limited number of yachts that have the necessary 7.5 ft to fit in the 8 ft standard container.|$|E
50|$|The true M. ornata {{is found}} in India and is a small species. From its home in India it reached Central and South America early in the 19th century where it became naturalized. M. ornata is not an {{especially}} variable plant in itself but it hybridizes freely with other species. The result <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> number of hybrids derived from it in the tropical regions of America.|$|E

50|$|The highest {{summit is}} Pachnes with 2453 m {{and there are}} over 30 summits that are over 2000 m high. The Lefka Ori also have about 50 gorges, the most famous being the Samaria Gorge. Another {{characteristic}} of the mountain range <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> number of plateaus that exist at heights of 500 - 1100 m, such at those of Askifou, Impros, Kallikratis, Anopolis, and Omalos which are all surrounded by mountains.|$|E
50|$|There {{have been}} rumours that say that Arab traders {{played a major}} role in the {{construction}} of Great Zimbabwe. The proof given for this <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> number of indigenous people, in the city of Masvingo, who have Muslim names and whose culture is similar to that of Muslims. A great number of Muslims have also arrived since the discovery of diamonds in the Manicaland area from north and western African regions.The Islamic migrants are largely coming from the Yao tribe of neighboring Malawi.|$|E

50|$|There are two {{strategies}} {{to handle the}} suspend/resume problem. The first is a global stall signal. This signal, when activated, prevents instructions from advancing down the pipeline, generally by gating off the clock to the flip-flops {{at the start of}} each stage. The disadvantage of this strategy <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> large number of flip flops, so the global stall signal {{takes a long time to}} propagate. Since the machine generally has to stall in the same cycle that it identifies the condition requiring the stall, the stall signal becomes a speed-limiting critical path.|$|E
5000|$|The second {{important}} prehistoric Thai ceramics is the Ban Kao {{which was}} in Kanchanburi Province. Unlike Ban Chiang, Ban Kao's wares were thinner and had a glossy surface finish. What is interesting <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> wide range of forms and shapes, {{some of which are}} similar to bronze wares of Han China. After the prehistoric period the kingdom that emerged at about 1st century CE was the Mons. They made considerable ceramics uses in relation to religious symbols in the form of figurines. Ceramics were also used as a building decorations.|$|E
