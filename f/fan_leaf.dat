5000|$|Sabal {{palmetto}} {{grows up}} to 65 ft. Starting at ½ to ⅔ the height the tree develops into a rounded, costapalmate fan of numerous leaflets. A costapalmate leaf has a definite costa (midrib) unlike the typical palmate or <b>fan</b> <b>leaf,</b> but the leaflets are arranged radially {{like in a}} palmate leaf. All costapalmate leaves are about 0.20 in across, produced in large compound panicles up to 8.2 ft in radius, extending out beyond the leaves. The fruit is a black drupe about [...]5 in long containing a single seed. It is extremely salt-tolerant and is often seen growing near both the Atlantic Ocean coast and the Gulf of Mexico coast.|$|E
50|$|Sabal 'Birmingham' {{grows up}} to 40 ft (12 m) in height, with a trunk up to 2 ft (60 cm) diameter. Like Sabal palmetto, it is a {{distinct}} fan palm (Arecaceae tribe Corypheae), with a bare petiole which extends as a center spine or midrib, (costa) 1/2 to 2/3 the length into a rounded, costapalmate fan of numerous leaflets. A costapalmate leaf has a definite costa (midrib) unlike the typical palmate or <b>fan</b> <b>leaf,</b> but the leaflets are arranged radially like in a palmate leaf. All costapalmate leaves are markedly recurved or arched backwards. Each leaf is 5 to 6.5 ft (1.5-2 m) long, with 40-60 leaflets up to 2.6 ft (80 cm) long. It was originally speculated that Sabal birmingham was a hybrid between Sabal palmetto and Sabal mexicana, however its slow growth rate and increased cold hardiness point more toward a hybrid between Sabal palmetto and Sabal minor.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT This {{research}} thesis {{offers a}} small but comprehensive scholarly catalogue raisonné of the surviving unmounted fan leaves designed and printed by the late eighteenth-century English <b>fan</b> <b>leaf</b> engraver, George Wilson (active before 1795 -after 1801). Wilson’s extant output of nineteen <b>fan</b> <b>leaf</b> engravings published in London now exist in storage within the Prints and Drawing Department of the British Museum, after the receipt of two bequests from Lady Charlotte Schreiber (1812 - 1895) {{in the late nineteenth}} century. The individual <b>fan</b> <b>leaf</b> designs discussed in this catalogue raisonné include a number of reprinted fan leaves from the same engraving design. There follows a chronological catalogue listing, and discussion of, all the different fan leaves designed by Wilson, collected by Lady Schreiber and subsequently bequeathed to the British Museum. The variety of subject matter depicted on these <b>fan</b> <b>leaf</b> designs underscore the differing types of themes Wilson engaged with in his engraved production. Analysis of the three main areas of Wilson’s <b>fan</b> <b>leaf</b> design work, female ‘advisory’ fan leaves, overtly satirical, and nationalistic fan leaves, reveal that Wilson’s <b>fan</b> <b>leaf</b> imagery engaged, to a great extent, with cultural concerns about the turbulences of late eighteenth-century life in London, as well as effectively modernising aesthetic precedents and contemporary graphic design. In particular, it becomes apparent that Wilson’s fan leaves effectively engage with late eighteenth-century feminine pre-occupations of choosing the right moral path to happiness, moderation in daily life, marriage and bearing children, in addition to illustrating the perceived multitude of follies translated from contemporary literary and pictorial sources. One of the predominant concerns in his catalogue of work is revealed to be the age old theme of the cycle of birth, reproduction and death, alongside a sustained pictorial focus upon feminine concerns and pre-occupations. ...|$|E

40|$|Notwithstanding nematology is {{a rather}} new science, in Italy the first {{observations}} and publications on nematodes date back to several centuries ago and are from physicians and botanists. Among them are U. Aldrovandi (1522 - 1605), {{who was the first}} in the word to observe nematodes in insects, and F. Redi, who published in 1684 his observations about “living animals occurring in living animals”. However, the first observations on plant parasitic nematodes were made from the second half of 1800 to early 1900. They refer to Anguina tritici in wheat kernels (1867), Meloidogyne spp. (1875 - 1904) on several host plants, Ditylenchus dipsaci (1897) in oats. The sugar beet cyst nematode, Heterodera schachtii, was reported in 1931 and the citrus nematode, Tylenchulus semipenetrans, in 1940. The turning point in Italian plant nematology occurred during 1950 - 1970, when investigations and control trials started on Xiphinema index, the natural vector of the Grape <b>fan</b> <b>leaf</b> virus.

40|$|The {{biodiversity}} of the viticultural ecosystem comprise: the primary, {{the first}} rank consumers {{and the second}} rank consumers. In the Oltenia vineyard the covering degree of soil with weeds is high, almost 80 - 85 %. After analysing the floristic composition of the weeds, {{it turned out that}} from the 15 species of weeds 5 species are annual monocotiledonated, 3 species perennial monocotiledonated, 5 species annual dicotiledonated and 2 species perennial dicotiledonated. Within the Oltenia viticultural ecosystem the complex of pathogens, for which there must be applied prevention and control measures, is made from key species (Plasmopara viticola, Uncinula necator, Botrytis cinerea) species of minor importance (Agrobacterium tumefaciens, Elsinoё ampelina, Pseudopeziza tracheiphilla), and potential pathogens (Septoria ampelina, Court noué <b>fan</b> <b>leaf</b> virus). The entomofauna from the Oltenia vineyards is represented by 86 arthropods species.

40|$|Abstract: The {{transmission}} of North American nepoviruses by putative species {{belonging to the}} Xiphinem ~ americanum-group is reviewed. Xiphinema americanum sensu stricto, X. californicum, and X. rivesi each transmit cherry rasp leaf (CRLV), tobacco ringspot (TobRSV), and tomato ringspot nepovirus (TomRSV), and X. bricolensis i a vector of TomRSV. The apparent lack of specificity in the {{transmission of}} North American nepoviruses by X. ame~qcanum-group species markedly contrasts with the specific associations between European epoviruses and their vector nematode species. Two complementary projects are described examining the taxonomic identity of putative species in the X. ame~canum-group, their morphological nd genetic relationships, their ontogeny, {{and their ability to}} transmit viruses. Key words: cherry rasp leaf virus, nematode, peach rosette mosaic virus, specificity, taxonomy, tobacco ringspot virus, tomato ringspot virus, Xiphinema. Interest in the transmission of plant vi-ruses by plant-parasitic nematodes devel-oped after the initial report, in 1958, that grapevine <b>fan</b> <b>leaf</b> nepovirus was naturally transmitted by Xiphinema index in Califor-nian vineyards (14). The following year, X. americanum was reported as a natural vec-tor of tomato ringspot nepovirus (2). Sub-sequently, this species was reported to transmit obacco ringspot, peach rosette mosaic and cherry rasp leaf nepoviruses (9, 16, 22). Xiphinema americanum-group nematodes reproduce by parthenogenesis (males are rare), which reduces genetic variability. The taxonomy of the group is based on the morpho-species concept, with species distinguished on relatively minor morphological differences (13). In 1979, Lamberti and Bleve-Zacheo (18) redefine...|$|E
40|$|Scorch of rhizomatous iris, Iris spp., occurs {{throughout}} much of the United States (Black, 1984). It is characterized as a rustcolored browning that starts on the tips of the youngest leaves {{in the center of the}} <b>fan.</b> <b>Leaf</b> necrosis progresses downward on the leaves and outward on the fan until the entire fan is affected. Roots shrivel and decay. Root cortical tissue completely deteriorates, but the epidermis and stele remain intact. The rhizome appears unaffected (Wadekamper, 1972). Because of the sporadic occurrence of scorch and the difficulty of artificially reproducing scorch symptoms, little is known about the etiology, epidemiology, or the pathogenicity of organism(s) involved in its development (Black, 1984). Attempts to identify a predominant causal organism or transmit scorch through inoculation with various fungi and bacteria recovered from scorched iris have failed to reproduce the disease (Wadekamper, 1972). Bald (1971) implicated the bacterium Pseudomonas gladioli pv. gladioli (Severini) as the probable cause of iris scorch. He obtained evidence of pathogenicity by inoculating wounded iris tissue with cell suspensions of the Pseudomonas bacterium. However, symptoms were less severe than those that occurred in the field under natural disease development. Rainio (1936) reported that P. marginata, synonymous with P. g. pv. gladioli, entered the iris leaf through wounds, where it caused a localized watersoaked wet rot but not the characteristic scorch symptoms. Since the pathogenicity of P. g. pv. gladioli to rhizomatous iris is not clear, the present study was undertaken to determine if P. g. pv. gladioli could be recovered from scorched iris and to characterize the symptoms produced by inoculation of rhizomatous iris with P. g. pv. gladioli...|$|E
