5|$|The {{big game}} starts with six players, {{including}} Howard and the <b>Kid,</b> <b>with</b> Shooter playing as he deals and Lady Fingers relieving him whenever Shooter needs a break. In {{the first big}} confrontation between the Kid and Howard, the Kid is short $2,000 and Slade steps in to stake him. Several hours later, Howard busts a player called Pig, perhaps with a bluff, and the remaining players take a break. Following the break, Lady Fingers, who has been delighting in needling Howard all evening, takes over as dealer and continues to needle him.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{developed}} by <b>KID,</b> <b>with</b> direction by Takumi Nakazawa, planning and scenario writing by Kotaro Uchikoshi, character design by Yuu Takigawa, and music by Takeshi Abo. Nakazawa and Uchikoshi were appointed to their respective positions as they had worked on the previous game in the Infinity series, , which had been well received. As Ever 17 was to be released on consoles, it was required to be finished {{two months before the}} planned August release, meaning that after the scenario's completion in May, there was only time for debugging until late June. Uchikoshi and Nakazawa described this as a tight development schedule, and said that the game was only possible through the staff working very hard, and a lot of things being worked on at the same time.|$|E

Araki designed him with a mustache, drawing inspiration from the appearances of the painter Salvador Dalí and the Osomatsu-kun character Iyami; this was considered a gamble, as mustachioed characters in shōnen magazines were considered to appear old and untrusthworthy, potentially turning readers off. His name comes from the rock band Led Zeppelin, and was chosen to balance out the large amount of names in the series beginning with [...] "J"; the character Speedwagon was given his name for the same reason.|$|E

As the final chorus breaks into dance grooves, Madonna comes out of the theater and gives the boy a quick kiss on his lips. Both are clad in loose-fitting gray suits, which gives Madonna an androgynous look. They stroll away playfully in the sunrise, reminiscent of Charlie Chaplin and Jack Coogan in The <b>Kid</b> <b>with</b> the old boss pursuing them and shouting [...] "Come back, come back, we still need you" [...] in Italian. The tension between the visual and the musical dimensions of the video is extremely unsettling according to author Nicholas B. Dirks.

After the dinner, when Jerry's parents are leaving, his father soothes: [...] "Hey, I agree with him. Nobody likes a <b>kid</b> <b>with</b> a pony."

She then transferred to Moreno High School, an alternative school, where she became a [...] "punk outsider," [...] wearing all-black clothing, going out moshing, and experimenting with knife play with her live-in boyfriend. She dropped out of her acting classes and aspired to become a funeral director, taking at-home courses to study embalming. At age 16, after the relationship had ended, Jolie graduated from high school and rented her own apartment, before returning to theater studies, though in 2004 she referred to this period with the observation, [...] "I am still at heart—and always will be—just a punk <b>kid</b> <b>with</b> tattoos." ...|$|E

Author Karina Longworth described her as a [...] "gawky <b>kid</b> <b>with</b> glasses and frizzy hair", yet noted that she liked to show off {{in front of the camera}} in family home movies from a young age. At the age of 12, Streep was selected to sing at a school recital, leading to her having opera lessons from Estelle Liebling. However, despite her talent, she remarked that [...] "I was singing something I didn't feel and understand. That was an important lesson—not to do that. To find the thing that I could feel through".

500|$|Before a meal, {{the stomach}} would preferably be [...] "opened" [...] with an apéritif (from Latin aperire, [...] "to open") that was preferably {{of a hot}} and dry nature: {{confections}} made from sugar- or honey-coated spices like ginger, caraway and seeds of anise, fennel or cumin, wine and sweetened fortified milk drinks. As the stomach had been opened, it should then be [...] "closed" [...] {{at the end of}} the meal with the help of a digestive, most commonly a dragée, which during the Middle Ages consisted of lumps of spiced sugar, or hypocras, a wine flavoured with fragrant spices, along with aged cheese. A meal would ideally begin with easily digestible fruit, such as apples. It would then be followed by vegetables such as lettuce, cabbage, purslane, herbs, moist fruits, light meats, such as chicken or goat <b>kid,</b> <b>with</b> potages and broths.
