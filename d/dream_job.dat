5|$|The Simpsons uses a {{floating}} timeline {{in which the}} characters do not physically age, and as such the show {{is assumed to be}} set in the current year. In several episodes, events have been linked to specific times, though sometimes this timeline has been contradicted in subsequent episodes. Maggie is the youngest child of Marge and Homer, and sister to Bart and Lisa. When Marge became pregnant with Bart, she and Homer got married at a chapel in Las Vegas. To support his impending family, Homer all but demanded a job at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, impressing its owner, Mr. Burns, with his aggressive submissiveness. When Marge became pregnant with Lisa, two years later, she and Homer bought their first house. Another six years later, Homer felt financially secure enough to finally quit his job at the Power Plant and take his <b>dream</b> <b>job</b> at Barney's Bowlarama. However, Marge became pregnant with Maggie, so Homer, once again unable to support his family, was forced to reapply for his old job. By the time Maggie was born, Homer had shown great signs of distress, but he managed to find motivation in the form of his newborn baby girl.|$|E

40|$|Digital disruption, {{changes in}} the labour market and the shift from {{students}} as consumers to creators of knowledge are fundamentally changing the higher education landscape. While some voices still call for preparing employable graduates, {{there is a growing}} realisation that in a knowledge economy career ready graduates need to be proactive, entrepreneurial and resilient to self-manage their careers. This paper presents an entrepreneurial learning model as a useful framework for higher education professionals. We argue that viewing entrepreneurship as a human problem-solving method, applicable across disciplinary boundaries, enables the design of innovative solutions to organisational, social and economic challenges as well as the creation of engaged and empowered graduates. We use a qualitative research design, drawing on multiple data sources such as student perspectives, observation, researcher journals and field notes from a multi-disciplinary experiential entrepreneurship model (MEEM) at USC (2014 - 2015). These data sources were thematically analysed to determine how entrepreneurial principles were used in creating start-up ventures in the MEEM case and the student outcomes and skills developed. We find that five entrepreneurial principles were instrumental in the process, namely drawing on readily available resources of the students involved, adhering to a non-predictive learning mindset that favours experimentation above elaborate planning, risk minimisation through iterative design, co-creation with pre-committed stakeholders and leveraging contingencies, thus embedding resilience. Student outcomes ranged from the creation of start-ups, to confident, empowered graduates finding their <b>dream</b> <b>jobs.</b> Future work skills such as novel and adaptive thinking, transdisciplinarity, collaboration and a design mindset were cultivated. We demonstrate the transferability of this entrepreneurial learning model from business, journalism and design to other disciplines such as education, engineering and sport science. In conclusion an entrepreneurial approach is fundamental to enacting innovation and developing resilient graduates who can proactively self-manage their careers...|$|R

[...] Gleiberman also praised Jennifer Garner's performance, writing: [...] "She cuts out all traces of adult consciousness, of irony and flirtation and manipulation, reducing herself to a keen, goggle-eyed earnestness that's utterly beguiling." [...] Joe Leydon of Variety also praised her performance, writing [...] "Garner throws herself so fully and effectively into the role {{that in a few}} key scenes, she vividly conveys Jenna's high spirits and giddy pleasure through the graceful curling of her toes." [...] Leydon praised the director Gary Winick for [...] " [...] bringing a fresh spin to most of the script's cliches and emphasizing nuggets of emotional truth provided by Goldsmith and Yuspa." [...] Wesley Morris of the Boston Globe wrote that [...] "The movie is tailor-made for women who openly lust for <b>dream</b> houses, <b>dream</b> <b>jobs,</b> and <b>dream</b> hubbies." [...] He also wrote that [...] "the best stuff involves the childhood preamble. (The young actors playing Jenna, Matt, and Lucy are terrific.) Those moments feel painfully, comically true." [...] Claudia Puig of USA Today gave the film 3 out of 4 stars, commenting, [...] "This romantic comedy is intended as a cautionary fairy tale. The silly humor works with the movie's gentle message of self-empowerment and avoids sappiness in a tender interlude where the adult Jenna returns to her childhood home. Amusing, charming and pleasantly nostalgic, 13 Going on 30 should fall easily onto moviegoers' wish lists." [...] It is written: [...] "This shameless rip-off of the Tom Hanks Classic Big is weak, but predictable and is sparked by the excellent performance of Jennifer Garner".|$|R
