40|$|This paper covers how the SAS System {{utilizes}} UNIX utilities for printing. This {{is important}} in order to generate text output from SAS. This article discusses basic <b>file</b> <b>printing</b> under UNIX, interfacing the SAS System with UNIX print utilities {{through the use of}} the PIPE device type, and using the SAS Forms Subsystem. With Release 6. 12, the SAS System added the Host Printing facility to provide additional options for printing from within SAS. Host Printing allows end users to change printer settings without having to know the Printer Control Language (PCL) being used behind the scenes. It is the assumption of this paper that you are not using Host Printing (i. e. Xprinter). You can confirm that host printing is turned off by checking a toggle switch. Go to Viewà Preferences, click on the Display Manager tab, and check the Host Printing radio button to make sure it is not selected. If you are interested in the features offered by the new Host Printing facility, they are documented in the Online Help as well as in TS 543 (a technical paper available from our web site or by calling Technical Support and requesting a copy). Unix <b>File</b> <b>Printing</b> In the Unix environment, file I/O is done directly by a device that is defined in the /dev directory. These devices can be terminals, floppy drives, tapes, and printers. When printing a file, you can send a file directly to a device in the /dev directory, but this would tie up the device, and restrict the sharing of the resource by multiple users. In order to allow several users to share the print devices, the lp and lpr commands are used. These print commands take advantag...|$|E

50|$|A third {{methodology}} is {{to combine}} the static and variable elements into <b>print</b> <b>files,</b> prior to <b>printing,</b> using specialized VDP software. This produces optimized <b>print</b> <b>files,</b> such as PDF/VT, PostScript or PPML, that maximize print speed since the RIP only needs to process static elements once.|$|R
50|$|The NCP is used {{to access}} <b>file,</b> <b>print,</b> directory, clock synchronization, messaging, remote command {{execution}} and other network service functions.

50|$|In {{order to}} {{retrieve}} the desired data the user present a set of criteria by a query. Then the Database Management System (DBMS), software for managing databases, selects the demanded data from the database.

50|$|A second {{methodology}} is {{to combine}} the static and variable elements into <b>print</b> <b>files,</b> prior to <b>printing,</b> using standard software. This produces a conventional (and potentially huge) <b>print</b> <b>file</b> with every image being merged into every page. A shortcoming of this methodology is that running many very large <b>print</b> <b>files</b> can overwhelm the RIP’s processing capability. When this happens, printing speeds might become slow enough to be impractical for a print job {{of more than a}} few hundred pages.|$|R
