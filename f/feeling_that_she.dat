5|$|LeHand {{had a brief}} {{romance with}} Eleanor's {{bodyguard}} (and rumored love) Earl Miller in 1931.

5|$|Towards {{the end of}} 1918 Holst {{had asked}} Joseph to provide a {{libretto}} for his opera The Perfect Fool, <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> might possess the required light touch that he thought his own writing lacked. It {{is not clear whether}} she declined, or whether Holst changed his mind, but he eventually wrote the text himself. Joseph did, however, write the story for a ballet based on Holst's music The Sneezing Charm; the ballet, entitled A Magic Hour, was performed at Morley in October 1920. Meantime, Joseph's works were being performed at SWM concerts: two songs, probably from her Mirage cycle, in January 1920, and some of her settings of Walter de la Mare poems in December.|$|E
5|$|For {{the part}} of bordello-keeper Fauna, the duo fixed on the famous diva, Helen Traubel. There was {{precedent}} for such casting—former opera star Ezio Pinza had starred as suave Frenchman Emile de Becque in South Pacific, and had received rave reviews for his performance. Traubel, {{in addition to being}} well known for her Wagnerian roles, was also noted for her nightclub singing. In 1953, the new Metropolitan Opera impresario, Rudolf Bing, <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was lowering the tone of the house, declined to renew her contract. Hammerstein had seen Traubel at her first appearance at the Copacabana nightclub in New York, and afterwards had gone backstage to predict to Traubel that she would be coming straight to Broadway. He saw her show again in Las Vegas several months later, and offered her the part. When offered the role, Traubel eagerly accepted, though she later noted that she had never represented herself as much of an actress.|$|E

5000|$|... "Armastuse ABC" [...] is {{a comforting}} song about a lonely, broken-hearted {{woman in a}} bar, {{watching}} others dance and {{waiting for someone to}} take her for a dance, <b>feeling,</b> <b>that</b> <b>she's</b> the only one with such problems.|$|R
5|$|Janeway {{begins to}} share Seven's suspicions and warns {{the crew to}} stay alert, but remains optimistic. The new engine system is {{compatible}} with Voyager, but the ship wouldn't {{be able to stand}} the stresses of the slipstream for long. The crew would have to abandon the ship to use the Dauntless to travel home. Seven states to Janeway that she would opt to stay behind, <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> {{would not be able to}} integrate back on Earth. Janeway reviews the message decoded by Arturis, and discovers the message to be fake. She transports to the Dauntless to confront Arturis. He tries to pin the blame on Seven, but Janeway rejects his claims. Arturis activates a panel on the ship, igniting the engines. All but Janeway and Seven are able to be transported out before the ship enters the slipstream.|$|E

In retaliation for ruining their plans, the Skedar launch a strike on the Carrington Institute, capturing Joanna and taking her to their homeworld. While in their spaceship, she is met by De Vries, who has also been imprisoned due to her failure {{to comply with the}} deal. <b>Feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> has been used, De Vries redeems herself by making a distraction and sacrificing herself, freeing Joanna and therefore giving herself a chance for revenge. Joanna is later assisted by Elvis and the pair manage to land on the Skedar planet. There, she defeats the Skedar High Priest, leaving the Skedar in disarray. The game ends with Elvis and Joanna leaving the planet just prior to an orbital bombardment from the Maian navy.|$|E

50|$|Another point {{worth noting}} {{is that both}} Martha and Mrs. Peters express guilt over not having visited Minnie more often— which opens up the {{possibility}} that Martha's reading of the evidence is skewed by her own <b>feelings</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> should have helped Minnie.|$|R
50|$|Shima and Kaori {{are hired}} by Fuyuko Kasumi to {{investigate}} a series of creepy e-mails she’s been receiving, {{as well as the}} <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>she’s</b> being watched. In this chapter we get to learn a little about Yoichi and Shima-san (senior)’s past.|$|R
50|$|Two {{minister}}s, Sheffield born Deborah Darby and Rebecca Young, visited from Coalbrookdale {{and their}} example matched Ann's <b>feelings</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> {{was called to}} minister too.

25|$|Portrayed as the anti-heroine and femme fatale of the series, Atia is greedy and ambitious, {{and will}} do {{virtually}} anything to get what she wants. Seduction, humiliation and violence (including murder) are all tools acceptable to her; Atia's occasional hypocrisy is overshadowed by her general acceptance of her own extremely corrupt and unethical nature. Fiercely protective of her family and their social status, Atia's motives usually involve advancement or self-preservation for the Julii. Her manipulations often extend to her own relatives; <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> knows best, Atia will not let even her children thwart her plans. Seeing a more advantageous match, Atia forcibly divorces her daughter Octavia from her first husband (and later has him eliminated).|$|E
25|$|At {{the start}} of the summer term at Meadowbank School for Girls, the most prestigious prep school in England, Miss Bulstrode, the popular but aging headmistress, has {{no reason to believe that}} the {{challenges}} facing her on parent's day will be more than the occasional irate or inebriated parent. She scarcely listens when Mrs Upjohn, a parent, who just happened to have worked in military intelligence, looks out of the window and notices on the school campus someone whom she recognises and whose presence at the school apparently surprises but does not alarm her. Mrs Upjohn is still talking but the crucial moment has passed. After Mrs Upjohn leaves, Miss Bulstrode has a sudden <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> has missed something to which she should have paid attention but then dismisses the notion.|$|E

50|$|Lanham {{says that}} after her first loss, <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was anxious about another child. <b>She</b> thought <b>that</b> he would end up just like her miscarriage. She covers all the <b>feelings</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> felt and being {{pregnant}} with her second son Andrew. There is also a dads view in the story. It covers many things such as, gaining the courage to try again, Trying Again, {{and waiting for the}} new baby.|$|R

25|$|On 8 December 1854 (the date Pope Pius IX {{proclaimed the}} dogma of the Immaculate Conception) - while {{reflecting}} at a chapel in Bauffe - she experienced {{a vision of}} the Madonna. <b>Feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> had been called to religious life she moved to Paris in 1854 and set up a small religious group in her home in 1855. In 1857 she established a convent at Strasbourg and she later founded the Sisters of Mary Reparatrix later on 1 May 1857; she made her vows on 2 May 1858.

25|$|Davidson {{moved to}} East York in 1947 {{after the death}} of her mother.

It turned out that the cancer diagnosis was incorrect but she continued her involvement. She established a neighbourhood kindergarten which led to her being elected as a school trustee in 1948. In 1952 she became the first woman to chair the East York Board of Education. In 1958, she was elected to East York's town council. In 1960 she ran for the position of Reeve of the Township of East York against incumbent Jack Allen.

She beat Allen by 5,065 votes to 3,458. Davidson was a dedicated politician, often attending community meetings, up to 40 per month. She was also a formidable debater, with an abrupt and abrasive style that annoyed her fellow council members. Yet the voters loved her and she was re-elected six times.|$|E

500|$|A Billboard {{reviewer}} praised [...] "What Now" [...] {{and called}} the song an [...] "emotional highlight on an album filled with moments of resonance in its second half." [...] Giovanny Caquias of Culture Blues wrote that the song feels like the first [...] "candid" [...] and [...] "insightful" [...] track on Unapologetic. He continued, [...] "Rihanna gets a little introspective on What Now, and doesn’t resort to being overtly sexual or defiantly callous (more on that later), which gave me the <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> stripped away her armor {{for a moment and}} actually allowed herself to be 'real'." [...] Daily News Jim Farber wrote that the song shows a heft.|$|E
500|$|She is then spun by the slippers' charm into Kansas, and, {{much to her}} surprise, {{she finds}} out that Kermit was looking for her, saying {{that she had the}} best voice they heard on the whole search, and that she has been chosen to go on the Star Hunt.

500|$|After the 1956 Olympics, Leech {{retired from}} {{competitive}} swimming {{at the age}} of 15. She was the first person from Bendigo to win an Olympic medal and was [...] upon returning to her hometown. She regarded the experience of living in the Olympic Village as an unusual one; in addition to the large crowds and the pressure of an Olympics, {{it was the first time}} that she had been away from the family home. Physicians endorsed her decision to retire, <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> became too nervous prior to races. Leech briefly worked in Melbourne as a model, before returning to Bendigo to help run the family jewellery business. She took a leading role in the business after the death of her father in the 1970s, before handing control of the firm to her son.|$|E
5000|$|She is troubled about lot {{of things}} like the strange <b>{{feelings}}</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> has around Nemoto, the [...] "indecent things" [...] that her parents have done to make a baby, and her feelings towards Saya when she gets close to Nemoto.

60|$|Amiable as was Mr. Rivers, this, merely from indulgence {{and want}} of reflection, was his principle; and his {{daughter}} had only been acting on it, though {{she did not know}} it, till the <b>feelings</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> had never thought of were thus displayed before her. These were her first practical lessons that life was not meant to be passed in pleasing ourselves, and being good-natured at small cost.|$|R

A few months after the wedding, Daphne became pregnant. Her pregnancy lasted over the usual nine months and Smith explained that the producers had stretched it out for longer, so they could tie it into other storylines. Daphne and Des's son, Jamie (S.J. Dey), arrived in July 1987 and became the first baby to be born in Neighbours.|$|E
500|$|On {{the other}} hand, Sean Elliott of IFMagazine disliked the [...] "Scrappy-Doo {{qualities of the}} character". He {{compared}} Jo to Dawn Summers of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> [...] "is always trying to help and always gets in the way". Fan reaction to the character was generally negative as well. Ackles summed up the response as, [...] "No, no, we just {{want this to be}} about the boys." [...] Though Kripke believed that Tal was a [...] "terrific actress" [...] who [...] "did valiantly and beautifully with the part [...] gave her", he felt that introducing her as a love interest was a mistake and came to believe that women should only be introduced into the series as antagonists. The failure with Jo prompted the series writers to introduce Ruby the following season in an attempt to [...] "course-correct".|$|E
500|$|Tal's {{return for}} the seventh season was {{announced}} at the 2011 Comic-Con. On the choice to bring Jo back for [...] "Defending Your Life", writer and co-executive producer Adam Glass explained, [...] "Knowing the history there, knowing the emotion that Dean would feel for her, we knew it'd be great. Jo's a favorite, too, {{so we wanted to}} see her back on the show." [...] Tal was happy to return to the show, saying, [...] "I didn't care that it took me over a season to come back. Just to be back at all was a blessing." [...] <b>Feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> herself had grown as a person since her appearance in the fifth season, Tal tried to mirror that in her performance. She noted, however, [...] "Obviously, [...] died. So there’s been some issues." [...] Singer called her work in the episode [...] "terrific." ...|$|E

50|$|In her autobiography, McCormick {{wrote that}} her {{grandmother}} died from syphilis {{in a mental}} institution, infected by her husband, who caught it in Europe during World War I (and who committed suicide a week after his wife's death). McCormick's mother contracted syphilis in utero, and McCormick dealt with a lifelong but unfounded fear <b>that</b> <b>she</b> would also get the disease, and stated that her favorite scenes in The Brady Bunch were those that called for her to cry, since this allowed her to release <b>feelings</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> drew upon from those fears.|$|R
