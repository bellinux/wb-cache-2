The very fact that she belonged to a purer and better age in America disqualified her to conceive of Altruria; her daughter, who had lived into a full recognition of the terrible anarchy in which the conditions have ultimated here, could far more vitally imagine us, and to her, I believe, we were at once a living reality. Her perception, her sympathy, her intelligence, became more and more to me, and I escaped to them oftener and oftener, from a world where an Altrurian must be so painfully at odds.

40|$|Family {{involvement}} {{is a critical}} predictor of student success in an academic setting, but many parents, teachers, and school communities are unaware of the benefits each party receives from the partnership. Involving families in education improves social skills, confidence, test scores, school attendance, and academic skills. As a future educator, I have made it a career-long goal to encourage families to participate and {{become a part of}} my classrooms. I will seek out and provide a variety of diverse opportunities for various family members to become active members in my classrooms. Initiating and establishing relationships with families from the onset of school is crucial to the success of family involvement. The sooner families become active members of the school community, the greater the benefits to all parties will be. An orientation packet {{is a great way to}} make families feel welcome in my classroom right away. A letter introducing myself, a brief questionnaire allowing me to learn important information about my students from their parents, a survey about involven 1 ent, and the first newsletters are all instrumental tools <b>I</b> can <b>use</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the first step in establishing important relationships with families. Once relationships have been formed in individual classrooms, it is important to implement a school-wide family involvement program. Several popular programs such as Epstein's Model, the FIT model, and "the Levels of Family Involvement Model, are all great prototypes <b>to</b> <b>use</b> when creating and putting into action a family involvement plan.

If not a literary lion, what was that Somebody to be? Such an environment as mine was woefully lacking in heroic figures to satisfy the romantic soul. In view of the experience I have just related, {{it is not surprising that}} the notion of becoming a statesman did not appeal to me; nor is it to be wondered at, despite the somewhat exaggerated respect and awe in which Ralph's grandfather was held by my father and other influential persons, that I failed to be stirred by the elements of greatness in the grim personality of our first citizen, the iron-master. For he possessed such elements. He lived alone in Ingrain Street in an uncompromising mansion I always associated with the Sabbath, not only because <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> be <b>taken</b> there on decorous Sunday visits by my father, but because it was the very quintessence of Presbyterianism. The moment I entered its [...] "portals"--as Mr. Hawthorne appropriately would have called them--my spirit was overwhelmed and suffocated by its formality and orderliness.

It was a world from which I was determined to escape at any cost.|$|R

Edward would never hit Caesar, but instead tell him off by shaking his walking stick at him while calling him a [...] "naughty dog". Charles Hardinge, 1st Baron Hardinge of Penshurst, reminisced about {{spending}} time with the dog whilst on the royal yacht, [...] "Whenever I went into the King's cabin, this dog always went for my trousers and worried them, much to the King's delight. <b>I</b> <b>used</b> not <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the slightest notice and went on talking all the time to the King which I think amused His Majesty still more." [...] Caesar frequently caused problems for the King, escaping in Marienbad whilst chasing white peafowl and on another occasion killing rabbits owned by Lord Redesdale's daughters. The King even considered Caesar to be an obstacle to the Entente Cordiale. He asked his personal attendant, Lawrence Wrightson, to look after Caesar should he die before the dog.The King ordered hardstone models of his favourite dogs and racehorses from the House of Fabergé. Caesar was at the King's side on the Norfolk estate when the initial wax models were revealed by the company. The model of Caesar was made of chalcedony, rubies, enamel and gold, and included Caesar's collar in the design. The finished model did not arrive until after the King's death, and was purchased by Dame Margaret Greville, who gave the figure to Queen Alexandra. A painting of the dog was also created by Reuben Ward Binks for the King.|$|R

But {{it was not the}} theological studies that I loved, it was the mathematics and their practical application, and among the classics I loved best the poets and the historians.

You know the wonderful things that are there: the flags and the guns captured from the Turks; the strange weapons of all devices; the famous suits of armor. I came back half-crazed; I wept that I must leave the place. But I set to work the best I could to carve out in wood an invention which the model of one of the antique galleys had suggested to me. They found it,--nothing can be concealed outside of your own breast in such a school,--and they carried me with my contrivance before the superior. He looked kindly but gravely at me: 'My son,' said he, 'do you wish to be a priest?' 'Surely, reverend father,' I answered in alarm, 'why not?' 'Because these things are not for priests. Their thoughts must be upon other things. Consider well of it, my son, while there is yet time,' he said, and he addressed me a long and serious discourse upon the life on which I was to enter. He was a just and conscientious and affectionate man; but every word fell like burning fire in my heart. At the end, he took my poor plaything, and thrust it down among the coals of his scaldino. It made the scaldino smoke, and he bade me carry it out with me, and so turned again to his book.|$|R
