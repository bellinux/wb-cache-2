50|$|The {{biology of}} the heteromorph ammonites is not clear, but one {{certainty}} {{is that their}} uncoiled shells would have made these forms very poor swimmers. Open shells, particularly ones with spines and ribs, {{create a lot of}} drag; but more importantly, the orientation of the shell, with the body hanging below the buoyant part of the shell, would have created a serious impediment to efficient swimming. It's more likely these ammonites either drifted in the plankton, collecting small animals on long tentacles like modern jellyfish, or else they crawled along the sea <b>floor</b> <b>feeding</b> on sessile or slow-moving animals such as clams.|$|E

40|$|Litho cells, are {{the most}} {{expensive}} equipment in a wafer fab. To support decision-making on this equipment, accurate simulation models for throughput and cycle time are helpful. The simulation models that are typically developed incorporate various shopfloor details. To properly model these details, they should be quantified, which is difficult and time-consuming. In this paper, a lumped parameter model is proposed for the litho cell. The model consists of two parts: a detailed representation of the processing inside the track and scanner, and an aggregate representation of the factory <b>floor</b> <b>feeding</b> the loadport. The track-scanner is modeled as a tandem flow line with blocking. The shop floor is represented by a delay distribution that incorporates all contributions outside the machine.

40|$|In 1992, two {{independent}} reports based on small-subunit rRNA gene (SSU rDNA) cloning revealed {{the presence of}} novel Archaea among marine bacterioplankton. Here, we report the presence of further novel Archaea SSU rDNA sequences recovered from the midgut contents of a deep-sea marine holothurian. Phylogenetic analyses show that these abyssal Archaea are a paraphyletic component of a highly divergent clade that also includes some planktonic sequences. Our data confirm that this clade is a deep-branching lineage in the tree of life. Holothurians, commonly known as sea cucumbers, {{are probably the most}} typical animal of the deep oceans and dominate, both numerically and by biomass (1), invertebrate megafauna in the abyss. Most are mobile epibenthic animals that wander over the sea <b>floor</b> <b>feeding</b> on the uppermost few millimeters of sediment.

40|$|The {{burden of}} Salmonella {{entering}} pig slaughterhouses across the European Union (EU) {{is considered a}} primary food safety concern. In order to assist EU Member States {{with the development of}} National Control Plans, we have developed a farm transmission model applicable to all Member States. It is an individual-based stochastic Susceptible-Infected model, that takes into account four different sources of infection of pigs (sows, feed, external contaminants such as rodents and new stock) and various management practices linked to Salmonella transmission/protection (housing, <b>flooring,</b> <b>feed,</b> All-In-All-Out production). A novel development within the model is the assessment of dynamic shedding rates. The results of the model, parameterized for two case study Member States (one high and one low prevalence) suggest that breeding herd prevalence is a strong indicator of slaughter pig prevalence. Until a Member States’ breeding herd prevalence is brought below 10 % then the sow will be the dominant source of infection to pigs raised for meat production; below this level of breeding herd prevalence, feed becomes the dominant force of infection...|$|R
40|$|The factors (farm type descriptions) {{obtained}} from a previous factor analysis study were analysed using regression with prevalence estimates of enzootic pneumonia on 69 pig farms. Farms were divided on enzootic pneumonia prevalence greater or less than 10 %. Multiple logistic regression analysis of the dichotomized data revealed that 3 farm types had {{an increased risk of}} having enzootic pneumonia. Multiple source feeder barns (farm Type 4) with low emphasis on disease entry and control had an odds ratio of 2. 38, meaning that farms closely matching this farm type were over twice as likely to have enzootic pneumonia for every one unit increase in the factor score. Family farms using <b>floor</b> <b>feeding</b> methods (Factor 5) had an odds ratio of 3. 31, suggesting that this combination of management styles may be a contributing factor in enzootic pneumonia. Integrated farms (Factor 6) had an odds ratio of 2. 31 for having the condition, suggesting that larger farms that mill their own feed and are closer in proximity to other pig farms have a greater chance of having enzootic pneumonia. A linear regression of the prevalence estimates of enzootic pneumonia on positive farms revealed that only farms with multiple source feeder barns and floor fed family farms were associated with a higher prevalence of enzootic pneumonia. Farms with extensive pig housing (Factor 1) were associated with a lower prevalence, suggesting that farms with ample pen space and air volume had fewer pigs with enzootic pneumonia. A similar analysis for pleuritis found a lower odds of lesions on farms with extensively housed pigs. This study confirmed that many commonly accepted risk factors, in combination, did indeed increase the likelihood of enzootic pneumonia. One previously unrecognized risk factor involved family farms that tended to floor feed. Factors affecting enzootic pneumonia appeared to be different than those affecting pleuritis, and it is concluded that the environment-disease interactions are different for the two diseases [...] RE: 21 ref.; SC: AG; CA; VE; BE; 0 I; ZA; EC; 0 V; 7 DSource type: Electronic(1...|$|E

Myiasis in humans is clinically categorized in six ways: dermal and subdermal, facial cavity, wound or traumatic, gastrointestinal, vaginal, and generalized. If found in humans, the dipteran larvae are usually in their first instar. The only treatment necessary is just to remove the maggots, and the patient heals naturally.

40|$|FEW {{studies of}} the protein {{requirement}} of Coturnix quail have been reported; however, the protein requirements of other experimental birds have been determined. Results of studies on the protein require-ment of Bobwhite quail by Norris (1935), Nestler et al. (1942), Nestler (1949), Bal-dini et al. (1950) and Scott et al. (1963) suggested that a protein level of approxi-mately 28 percent in a practical-type diet gave maximum growth. Lower protein lev-els of 20 to 24 % were adequate for the Bobwhite quail provided supplemental ly-sine and methionine were fed, Baldini et al. (1953). Studies with young Ringnecked pheasants by Callenbach and Hiller (1953), Norris et al. (1936), Scott and Reynolds (1949) and Scott et al.

40|$|Abstract: An {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} evaluate the effect of <b>floor</b> density and <b>feeding</b> system on the weight of bursa of Fabricius and spleen {{as well as the}} plasma Triiodothyronine level of Bayang Duck. Objective of the {{experiment was}} to know the effect of <b>floor</b> density and <b>feeding</b> system on the weights of bursa of Fabricius and spleen as well as the plasma triiodothyronine level in the Ducks. As animal materials in the experiment were used Bayang Ducks, a localized kind of domestic water poultry. Bayang Ducks have been being reared traditionally by small farmers in District Pesisir Selatan of The Province of West Sumatera-Indonesia. In amount of 80 ducks treated since they were 2 weeks age and average body weight 135 ± 0. 39 g until finishing of six weeks experimental period. The experiment was arranged into Split Plot Design in CRD with factors Floor density D 1 0. 48 sq m/duck, D 2 0. 08 sq m/duck and feeding systems F 1 ration and F 2 free choice. Every treatment had five replications and every experimental unit consisted of four ducks. The measured variables were relative weight of bursa of Fabricius and spleen as well as level of triiodothyronine in blood plasma. Data were analyzed statistically with Split Plot Design in CRD.

50|$|Most {{molluscs}} are herbivorous, grazing on algae or filter feeders. For those grazing, two feeding {{strategies are}} predominant.

To employ this strategy, the plant has to be large enough for the mollusc to 'sit' on, so smaller macroscopic plants are not as often eaten as their larger counterparts.Filter feeders are molluscs that feed by straining suspended matter and food particle from water, typically by passing the water over their gills.
