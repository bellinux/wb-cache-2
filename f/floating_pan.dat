40|$|From the Proceedings of the 1990 Meetings of the Arizona Section - American Water Resources Association and the Hydrology Section - Arizona-Nevada Academy of Science - April 21, 1990, Arizona State University, Tempe, ArizonaDuring {{the summer}} of 1989, a water balance study was {{conducted}} at Lee Valley Reservoir, located approximately 19 miles southwest {{of the town of}} Eagar in Apache County, Arizona. The objectives of this study were to quantify evaporation and seepage losses from the lake and substantiate the use of a land-based evaporation pan to estimate lake evaporation. Lake level, inflow, controlled releases, precipitation and evaporation were measured on a twice weekly basis for six months from May 1 to October 31. Evaporation was measured in a Class A evaporation pan designed to float in the reservoir. Evaporation was also measured at a Class A land pan near the town of Eagar. A 1. 0 inch difference in the estimated rate and the measured rate for a 147 -day period of common record represents a 3. 6 % error between the land-based pan and the <b>floating</b> <b>pan.</b> Total losses from the lake over the six -month period were 224 acre-feet. Of this loss controlled releases accounted for 8. 2 acre-feet, and evaporation was measured at 116 acre-feet. The remaining loss of 100 acre-feet is due to seepage, much of which can be seen as seeps rising within 800 feet downstream from the dam. Using average data from past years, an annual water balance for the lake was also calculated...|$|E

Des pluviomètres et pluviographes ont été installés sur leurs bassins versants (0, 15 à 4, 10 km 2) et répartis sur toute la surface du ranch (450 km 2). Par ailleurs, une soixantaine de petits barrages équipent ce ranch. En période pluvieuse ils complètent l'alimentation en eau du bétail, assurée principalement par des forages. L'objectif général de l'étude menée par le CENID-RASPA est d'analyser quel est et quel pourrait être le rôle de ces petits barrages dans l'alimentation en eau du ranch. À l'échelle des bassins versants, l'analyse des relations entre la hauteur de pluie et la lame ruisselée {{montre que}} la prise en compte de l'intensité de pluie est nécessaire pour expliquer le ruissellement. Dans ce but, un modèle hydrologique global conceptuel a été défini utilisant les notions :- d'intensité de pluie limite du ruissellement (IL),- d'indice des pluies antérieures (IK) - de pluie utile (PUIL), somme des pluies dont l'intensité, pour une même averse, dépasse la valeur limite IL. Les averses sans ruissellement et avec un faible ruissellement servent à définir la relation entre IL et IK. Deux paramètres définissent les relations hydro-pluviométriques : le coefficient de croissance parabolique E et le paramètre de position F, associé à l'origine des ruissellements. Le paramètre de position F varie en fonction de l'indice des pluies antérieures et tend à s'annuler pour une forte valeur de IK. Le paramètre E varie peu pour un même bassin, sauf lorsque deux averses sont espacées de moins de 24 heures et lorsque le couvert végétal herbeux est très dégradé. Dans ces deux cas, le coefficient E est nettement plus élevé, parfois trop élevé pour l'utilisation d'une relation parabolique. Les relations ainsi définies ont été utilisées pour calculer de longues séries d'apports journaliers dans les petits barrages du ranch Atotonilco (ESTRADA AVALOS, 1999). In a co-operative programme between CENID RASPA (Centro National de Investigación Disciplinaria - Relación Agua, Suelo, Planta y Atmosfera, México) and IRD (formerly ORSTOM, France), seven small dams were equipped for hydrological measurements in an extensive breeding system, the ranch Atotonilco, {{located in a}} semi-arid area of northern Mexico. The main aim of the equipment was to follow the surface water in the water supply system of the ranch (ESTRADA AVALOS, 1999). In order to analyse {{the role of the}} seven small dams, it was necessary to understand the hydrological conditions of their filling and emptying. Also, manual and automatic rain gauges were installed on small experimental watersheds (0. 15 to 5 km 2) and on the ranch (450 km 2), and in addition evaporation pans and a <b>floating</b> <b>pan</b> were placed on the banks of a few dams and in a reservoir (THIEBAUX, 2000). The aim {{of this paper is to}} present the overall conceptual hydrological model used to calculate runoff in the small catchments in the Atotonilco ranch, considering that it was necessary to utilise the rainfall intensities to explain the surface runoff. Hydrological observations were made from 1996 to 1998 on the Atotonilco ranch. Spatial analysis of the rainfall demonstrated the existence of several types of storms: those with a small extension (17 km 2), with a middle extension (160 km 2) or with a great extension (more than 450 km 2). The average distance between two isohyets with a deviation of 10 mm varied from 2 to 3 km. In this semi-arid area, obtaining rainfall measurements of good precision requires a dense rain gauge network. On the small catchment scale it was necessary to put three or four rain gauges in each river basin. On the scale of small catchments, the analysis of the relationship between the amount of rainfall and surface runoff showed that rainfall intensity explained very clearly the surface runoff. This led us to the construction of a lumped model using the following criteria:- rainfall intensity limit of surface runoff (IL), with a time step of 30 min,- forward rainfall index (IK),- useful rainfall (PUIL), sum of the depths of rainfall with intensities higher than the limit value of IL. Experimental measures without runoff and with surface runoff have been used to describe the variation of the rainfall intensity limit of the surface runoff (IL), which decreases exponentially with increasing forward rainfall index (IK). This index IK is defined as the sum of the previous rainfall andthe previous index, which decreases in an exponential manner with the time interval ?t expressed in days (and partial days) between two successive showers (LINSLEY et al., 1949). The interval dt, which defines the rainfall intensity, depends on the time of concentration in the small catchments. On the Atotonilco ranch, the correlations between rainfall intensities for different intervals and surface runoff demonstrated that a 30 -min interval provided the best results. However, we did not obtain significant correlations between surface runoff and different values of the exponential decreasing coefficient of IL as a function of IK (a). Considering the results obtained by ESTRADA AVALOS (1999) on the scale of experimental plots (60 m 2), we have chosen the value a ?= 0. 1 day- 1. This value increases IK during the rainy season when increasing soil moisture and grass cover growth, but these two factors have opposite effects on the surface runoff. Two parameters define the quadratic relationships between the useful depth of rainfall and the surface runoff: the parabolic increasing coefficient (E) and the position coefficient (F). It is possible to determine the position coefficient F with the value of the useful rainfall (PUIL 0) which gives a null value to the depth of surface runoff. Using the observations collected from 1996 - 1998, we demonstrated that the position coefficient F decreased linearly with an increasing forward rainfall index IK. In addition, the parabolic increasing coefficient E was constant in the same basin, except when the storms were spaced less than 24 h apart and when the grass cover was low at the beginning of the rainfall season (1996). In these two cases, the runoff aptitude of the watersheds was clearly greater resulting in a higher E coefficient, which was sometimes too high for a parabolic relationship. It would be better to extrapolate above the limit value of PUIL taking into consideration that the additional runoff is equal to the additional useful rainfall. In order to validate the calibration of this model we used the criterion of NASH and SUTCLIFFE (1970). This criterion was calculated only for the year of 1996 but for two scenarios: the first scenario considered the parameter F as a constant and the second scenario allowed for a linear decrease of this parameter with the forward rainfall index IK. The results demonstrated that it was always better to use, for the position parameter F, a linearly decreasing relationship with the index IK. The relationships defined for the seven experimental catchments in the Atotonilco ranch were used to calculate long daily chronic inflows into the little dams (ESTRADA AVALOS, 1999). The hydrological parameters were also mixed with the natural characteristics of the small catchments in order to perform a principal components analysis of the relationships between hydrological parameters and natural criteria. Rules for the transposition of the parameters of this quadratic model on the Atotonilco ranch were established using the results of the analysis...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{analyzes}} {{the suitability of}} radar satellite images for monitoring small reservoir surfaces, the suitability of remotely sensed time series of their surface areas to calibrate hydrological models, and small reservoir evaporation losses. Radar remote sensing of small reservoirs is suitable especially during the rainy season, but is affected by wind and lack of vegetation context during the dry season. Reservoirs could be extracted from the radar images most often with a quasi-manual classification approach, as stringent classification rules often failed under less than optimal conditions. Failure to extract reservoirs {{was due to the}} backscattered radar signal that occurred above wind speeds of 2. 6 m s exp(- 1) (Bragg scattering). Due to lower wind speeds, the use of night time acquisitions was more effective than the use of daytime images. As optical systems perform well under low vegetation contrast, and independent of wind conditions, radar and optical systems can be used complimentary. Time series of remotely sensed small reservoir surface areas, translated into storage volume changes, were successfully used to calibrate hydrological rainfall-runoff models. Eight small reservoirs in the Upper East Region of Ghana, and Togo, were monitored to calibrate modified Thornthwaite-Mather models, in which increasing precipitation leads to exponentially increasing contributing areas. The model results indicate that the overall impact of the reservoirs largely depends on the ratios of reservoir and watershed areas. For this two year study, the reservoirs captured on the average 34 % of quick flow, and 15 % of overall watershed runoff. Reservoir evaporation losses were measured directly with a <b>floating</b> evaporation <b>pan</b> (E sub(o)) and were compared to evaporation rates determined from the reservoir?s energy budget (E sub(B)) and Penman's equation (E sub(t)). The direct E sub(o) measurements were generally lower than E sub(t) and E sub(B). Compared to land based E sub(t) Land, the reservoir evaporation E sub(t) was not excessive. Regional wind patterns influence evaporation dynamics from the reservoir. Northeast winds with a high saturation deficit lead to significant evaporation losses, while the evaporation losses under moister, more prevalent southwest winds were moderate...|$|R
40|$|Un modèle décrivant la température d'équilibre des lagunes a été développé, tenant compte des différents flux de chaleur que celles-ci échangent avec l'air et le sol environnant. Six {{composantes}} différentes ont été inclues dans le calcul de ce bilan thermique: radiation solaire, évaporation, convection, rayonnement atmosphérique, rayonnement de la surface du plan d'eau, échange via les parois en contact avec le sol. Le modèle ainsi obtenu a été testé avec efficacité sur deux lagunes aérées et une lagune naturelle situées sous climat tempéré; sa précision sur l'estimation des températures d'équilibre étant de l'ordre de 0. 7 °C. Des simulations en continu ont également pu être effectuées au moyen d'une variante dynamique, tenant compte de l'inertie thermique qu'entraîne {{le volume}} des bassins. Quelle que soit la saison envisagée, la principale forme d'apport de chaleur est représentée par la radiation solaire tandis que la dissipation d'énergie se partage entre les flux d'évaporation et la balance des deux flux de rayonnement. Les bassins échangeraient en moyenne plus de 250 W/m 2; le maximum de transfert de chaleur correspondant au printemps et à la période estivale. Enfin, l'analyse de sensibilité du modèle nous a permis de mettre en évidence la contribution de chacun des termes intervenant dans le calcul de ce bilan thermique et de révéler sa dépendance vis-à-vis principalement de la température d'entrée, du rayonnement solaire et de la température de l'air. Very {{few studies have}} ever focused on the thermal balance of a wastewater treatment process, despite its major impact on various aspects of sanitary engineering, such as biological growth, oxygen transfer and, most importantly, purification kinetics. This lack of knowledge is particularly worrying {{for the design of}} aerated lagoons and waste stabilization ponds, since these two extensive treatment technologies are extremely dependent on climatic conditions and subject to high thermal variations. In temperate regions, a pond annual temperature range can even exceed 20 °C, while a 10 °C variation will induce a more than 60 % drop or increase in its removal yield. Our paper intends to present a comprehensive temperature prediction model which accounts for the main heat loss and gain terms exchanged through the pond surface and walls. Our approach includes six different energy inputs and outputs, namely: solar radiation, air-water surface convection, atmospheric radiation, back surface radiation, evaporation and ground-water-walls convection. Each of these components was described extensively by means of a literature review of all previous efforts made to predict equilibrium temperature in lakes, rivers, salt-gradient solar ponds, cooling tanks, even outdoor pools. The best aspects of each prediction model were then incorporated into a new computer model developed as two different but complementary variants: one for steady-state conditions and the other for continuous and therefore also transient simulations. The main difference between these two approaches is that the first one neglects enthalpy variation while the second one {{takes the form of a}} differential equation, with basin temperatures being estimated by an iterative calculation procedure and a numerical integration method, respectively. Two hypotheses were necessary to develop this model. The first one posits that pond hydrodynamics correspond to completely mixed conditions. Such hydraulic behavior is extremely frequent in aerated lagoons and waste stabilization ponds in temperate climates, but less so in tropical or Mediterranean regions, where thermal balances appear much more complex since stabilization ponds are often thermally stratified. The second hypothesis is that all radiation fluxes received by the ponds are completely absorbed by the pond's contents and are never reflected, even partially, by their bottoms or walls. This model, which is in fact the thermal balance of the basins, relies mainly on meteorological factors and pond characteristics. Only two out of the six estimated fluxes - evaporation rates and solar radiation - are measured directly in situ. It seemed too difficult to estimate them, since predictive equations found in literature constantly gave unsatisfactory results. To establish the validity of this model, experimental data were collected at a wastewater treatment plant located in the southern part of Belgium. This plant consists of a series of two aerated lagoons and four waste stabilization ponds, designed for a nominal capacity of 7, 500 inhabitant-equivalents. Five rounds of measurements, each lasting from five to twenty days, were conducted at different periods of the year. Meteorological factors were continuously monitored by a data acquisition unit while the pond water temperatures and hydraulic flows were measured hourly. Evaporation rates were determined daily with several <b>floating</b> evaporation <b>pans</b> set at the pond surfaces. Vertical temperature and illumination profiles were also measured in order to verify the strict applicability of the two previous hypotheses. Ninety-three experimental data sets were collected on this particular facility. Predicted temperatures were compared with measured temperatures as well as with the results of three other models previously developed for waste stabilization ponds. Our new model systematically proved more reliable and accurate than previous approaches, since equilibrium temperatures were predicted with a mean absolute error of only 0. 7 °C. More than 52 % of the deviations between calculated and observed temperatures were even below 0. 5 °C, which indicates their relatively low dispersion. Continuous simulations were also conducted during a one-day period to demonstrate the importance of the ponds' large thermal capacities. The steady-state approach, which does not account for this latter phenomenon, failed to give consistent results, unlike our dynamic heat balance approach, which yielded extremely good fits with experimental data. A sensitivity analysis allowed us to show the influence of the various meteorological factors on the basins' equilibrium temperatures. In decreasing order, the fits seemed particularly sensitive to inlet temperature, solar radiation, air temperature and evaporation. Surprisingly, wind speed made only a small contribution to the total heat balance. However, this must be seen as a direct consequence of the fact that in our model this latter parameter is no longer used to calculate the predominant evaporation rates but only to estimate the much smaller convection term. Whatever the season considered, more than 90 % of the ponds' energy inputs come from solar radiation while the dominating loss mechanisms are represented by the balance of the two infrared radiation fluxes (46 %) and evaporation (42 %). The sign of the air-water convection term varies according to the period of the year but never accounts for more than 10 % of the total heat balance. Heat losses or gains from basin walls always remain insignificant and could therefore easily be neglected in order to simplify our approach to basin equilibrium temperatures...|$|R
40|$|Advances in {{scientific}} understanding follow a cyclic pattern where new observational techniques lead to novel theoretical insight. From novel theories, in turn, hypotheses are derived that cannot be tested using current observations and thus create {{a demand for}} even newer observational techniques. Hydrology has recently experienced a period of great advances in theoretical understanding with hydrological models gaining considerably in complexity. Currently, {{the state of the}} hydrological science is at a point where further increases in complexity of hydrological models can no longer be supported by available data. The information content of currently used data is too low to uniquely identify the numerous parameters in hydrological models. Therefore new, and above all, different observational methods are needed to unlock thus far hidden hydrological data. In this thesis it is argued that three developments can be greatly beneficial to help hydrologists unlock new data:  The occurrence of sensors in nearly every (consumer) device and the associated drop in the cost of those sensors  The rise of the “open source hardware” movement, which promotes sharing hardware designs.  The online sharing of research results and large data sets To be able to use these developments successfully in hydrology, pragmatic researchers are needed. Scientists whom, using a “MacGyver” attitude towards science, can show proof-of-concept results of how these new developments can best benefit hydrology. In this thesis, four such proof of concepts are presented, summarised below. Using the Wiimote as a sensor in water research An example of how consumer electronics can be used for hydrology is given in chapter 2. The $ 40 “Wiimote” (an input device belonging with the Nintendo® Wiigame system) is a device that contains three accelerometers and an infrared camera with built-in source tracking. It communicates by Bluetooth®. Because of the efforts of the hacking community it is easy to let the Wiimote communicate with a standard personal computer. Using a <b>floating</b> evaporation <b>pan</b> as an example, it is shown that the Wiimote, although it may have potential drawbacks when used in field campaigns, is a good addition to the hydrologist’s bag of tools. This first proof-of-concept work can inspire other scientists to consider using consumer electronics based sensors in their work. A resonating rainfall and evaporation recorder In chapter 3 a novel method of measuring rainfall and evaporation is presented. The device is basically a collection vessel (bucket) placed on top of a slender rod that is securely fixed at its base. As the vessel is deflected, either by manual perturbation or ambient forcing (for example, wind), its oscillatory response is measured by a miniature accelerometer. This response can be modeled as a damped massspring system. As the mass of water within the collection vessel changes, through either the addition of precipitation or by evaporative loss, the resonant frequency experiences an inverse shift. This shift can be measured and used to estimate the change in mass of water. This concept was tested by creating a simple prototype which was used in field conditions for a period of one month. The instrument was able to detect changes in mass due to precipitation with an accuracy of approximately 1 mm. Design, calibration and field evaluation of an acoustic disdrometer designed for distributed measurements Another novel raingauge is presented in chapter 4. The “Delft-disdrometer” is an acoustic disdrometer: a raingauge that measures the size of individual raindrops by recording the sound that impacting raindrops make when they hit the sensor. The Delft-disdrometer is specifically designed to be low maintenance, thus allowing the installation of dense networks without incurring large upkeep costs. In a field evaluation, the Delft-disdrometer was compared to existing rain gauges and disdrometers. Results show that the Delft-disdrometer is capable of measuring precipitation intensities with comparable uncertainties as those of the industry standard Thies LPM and Ott Parsivel. For drops bigger than 1. 75 mm, the Delft-disdrometer measured drop size distributions similar to the drop size distributions measured by the Thies LPM and Ott Parsivel. The inability of the Delft-disdrometers to measure drops smaller than 1 mm is an issue that should be addressed in future iterations of the design. The experiments with this first prototype show that it is feasible to measure precipitation intensities with the low maintenance Delft-disdrometer. Medicinal Footprint {{of the population of the}} Rhine basin The final example is given in chapter 5. By using freely available demographic data the relation between pharmaceutical residues along the river Rhine and the demographic characteristics of the upstream population was studied. A sampling campaign was performed in which water samples from the Rhine taken at 42 locations. Measurements were compared to a two parameter model with regional demographic data as main input. For 12 out of the 21 studied pharmaceuticals, a significant dominant demographic group could be identified. For 3 out of these 12 pharmaceuticals male elderly were the most contributing demographic group. A Monte Carlo analysis showed a high level of significance for the results of this study (? < 0. 01). By combining environmental water quality data and demographic data, better insight was gained in the interplay between humans and their environment, showing the medicinal footprint of the population of the Rhine basin. Conclusions and look into the future In the ongoing cycle between new observational methods and new theories, hydrology is due for a round of new observational methods. Because of the complexity of current day hydrological models, richer datasets are needed to test the predictions (hypotheses) that those complex models make. More spatially distributed measurements of well known hydrological variables, as well as novel measurements of previously thought unmeasurable, or unimportant, variables are needed. Sensors designed for use in consumer electronics are often cheaper than sensors specifically designed for scientific research, because of the economies of scale achieved in the production of consumer electronics. Using these sensors normally required both hydrological insight as well as skills with (micro) electronics. However, the advent of the open hardware movement, spearheaded by the Arduino platform, has significantly lowered the threshold for hydrologist to build their own sensors. And finally: not all new data need to come from sensors: by looking at data sources outside of hydrology, such as the demographic data used in chapter 5, additional hydrological insight can be obtained. However, before the benefits of low cost sensors, open source hardware and open data can be reaped by all hydrologists three steps need to be taken. Work on innovative measurement techniques should be accompanied by step by step instructions on how to recreate the measurement device. Producers of sensors and open source hardware need to provide plug and play functionality. Geoscientific data needs to be stored in standardised formats, whether online or on local files. The work presented in this thesis shows examples of how lower cost sensors based on consumer electronics, open source hardware and open data sources from outside of hydrology can help hydrology move into the next phase of its ever continuing cycle...|$|R
