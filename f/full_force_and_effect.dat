500|$|A {{second case}} from the Litvinov Agreement, United States v. Pink, [...] also went to the Supreme Court. [...] In Pink, the New York State {{superintendent}} of insurance was ordered to turn over assets belonging to a Russian insurance company pursuant to the Litvinov assignment. The United States sued New York to claim the money held by the Insurance Superintendent, and lost in lower courts. However, the Supreme Court held New York was interfering with the President's exclusive power over foreign affairs, independent of any language in the Constitution, a doctrine it enunciated in United States v. Curtiss-Wright Export Corp. and ordered New York to pay {{the money to the}} Federal Government. The Court declared that [...] "the Fifth Amendment does not {{stand in the way of}} giving <b>full</b> <b>force</b> <b>and</b> <b>effect</b> to the Litvinov Assignment" [...] and ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{language}} of treaties, {{like that of}} any law or contract, must be interpreted when the wording does not seem clear or it is not immediately apparent {{how it should be}} applied in a perhaps unforeseen circumstance. The Vienna Convention states that treaties are to be interpreted [...] "in good faith" [...] according to the [...] "ordinary meaning given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose."

60|$|The {{doctrine}} so {{laid down}} demands that every several circumstance should in itself be conclusive, {{or at least}} should afford a violent presumption: it must, we were told, without question, be material to the charge depending. But, as we conceive, its materiality, more or less, {{is not in the}} first instance to be established. To make it admissible, it is enough to give proof, or to raise a legal inference, of its connection both with the charge depending and the person of the party charged, where it does not appear {{on the face of the}} evidence offered. Besides, by this new doctrine, the materiality required to be shown must be decided from a consideration, not of the whole circumstance, but in truth of one half of the circumstance,--of a demeanor unconnected with and unexplained by that on which it arose, though the connection between the demeanor of the party and the paper is that which must be shown to be material. Your Committee, after all they have heard, is yet to learn how the <b>full</b> <b>force</b> <b>and</b> <b>effect</b> of any demeanor, as evidence of guilt or innocence, can be known, unless it be also fully known to what that demeanor applied,--unless, when a person did or said anything, it be known, not generally and abstractedly, that a paper was read to him, but particularly and specifically what were the contents of that paper: whether they were matters lightly or weightily alleged,--within the power of the party accused to have confuted on the spot, if false,--or such as, though he might have denied, he could not instantly have disproved. The doctrine appeared and still appears to your Committee to be totally abhorrent from the genius of circumstantial evidence, and mischievously subversive of its use. We did, however, offer that extraneous proof which was demanded of us; but it was refused, as well as the office document.|$|E

Costa Rica {{has maintained a}} stable democracy since 1948, while Nicaragua, rocked by authoritarian rule and then revolution in 1979, is still in an unstable growth period. Each country represents an opposing government system that would have varying effects on the emphasis and influence placed on different social situations in each country. Through studying one social aspect, the women 2 ̆ 7 s movement, one is able to examine {{the positive and negative}} aspects of each system and prospects for future success of countries under each type of rule. At the time of revolution in 1948, the Costa Rican government did not put equality of women as one of its main goals, but through time, a consciousness has spread about the need to fight for women 2 ̆ 7 s rights. Slowly women have organized to achieve greater equality in many political, economic and social aspects. In Nicaragua, women played {{an active role in the}} revolution and one of the objectives of the revolutionary forces, the Sandinistas, was to abolish the discrimination that women have faced for years. Shortly after the revolution, the women 2 ̆ 7 s movement was in <b>full</b> <b>force</b> <b>and</b> the <b>effects</b> of this movement are still prevalent throughout the country. In these two neighboring countries, significant advances have been made towards gender equity, but many times these accomplishments are only on the surface and women continue to face discrimination in many private and public social facets...|$|R
