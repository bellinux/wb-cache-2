He had a rhyme he liked to sing: [...] "If thou here wilt let me stay, / Good luck shalt thou have alway; / But if hence thou wilt me chase, / Luck will ne'er come near the place." [...] Three famous kobolds, King Goldemar, Heinzelmann, and Hödekin, all gave {{warnings}} about danger to the owners of the home in which they lived. Heinzelmann once warned a colonel to be careful on his daily hunt. The man ignored the advice, only to have his gun backfire and shoot off his thumb. Heinzelman appeared to him and said, [...] "See, now, you have got what <b>I</b> <b>warned</b> <b>you</b> of! If you had refrained from shooting this time, this mischance would not have befallen you." [...] The kobold Hödekin, who lived with the bishop of Hildesheim in the 12th century, once warned the bishop of a murder. When the bishop acted on the information, he was able to take over the murderer's lands and add them to his bishopric.|$|E
