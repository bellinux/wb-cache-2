40|$|Serum {{kinetics}} of metronidazole and tinidazole {{were compared}} in four separate randomized crossover studies. Single doses of each drug {{were given to}} healthy volunteers through intravenous infusion (500 mg over 20 min, six persons), by mouth (500 mg, nine persons), by rectum (1, 000 mg, six persons), or intravaginally (500 mg, six persons). Concentrations of the unchanged drugs in serum, measured by high-pressure liquid chromatography, were similar after oral and intravenous administration, with mean peaks of 9. 0 and 9. 4 micrograms/ml for metronidazole and 7. 5 and 10. 1 micrograms/ml for tinidazole. Concentrations of tinidazole {{were significantly higher than}} those of metronidazole from 4 h onwards after intravenous infusion, and from 3 h onwards after administration by mouth. After rectal administrations, a significant difference was seen only at 48 h. After vaginal dosing, however, concentrations of metronidazole were significantly higher than those of tinidazole between 1. 5 and 12 h. Bioavailability of either drug, calculated according to the <b>formula</b> (<b>area</b> under the curve for oral administration) /(area under the curve for infusion), was practically complete after oral administration and was poorer after rectal and especially vaginal administration. Whenever the parameters were calculable, the elimination half-life of tinidazole (range of means, 14. 0 to 14. 7 h) was significantly longer and total clearance (40. 3 to 47. 6 ml/min) was lower than the corresponding values of metronidazole (7. 9 to 8. 8 h and 71. 8 to 80. 1 ml/min, respectively) ...|$|E
40|$|O objetivo do presente estudo {{in vitro}} foi avaliar a área ocupada pela guta-percha e cimento, bem como a resistência de união em canais radiculares obturados por diferentes técnicas: Schilder Modificada, Cone único, Thermafil e Híbrida de Tagger. Quarenta incisivos centrais superiores foram preparados com instrumentos rotatórios de NiTi até o diâmetro cirúrgico # 70. 02, e divididos em quatro grupos de acordo com a técnica utilizada para obturação dos canais (n= 10) : GI - Schilder Modificada, GII - Cone Único, GIII - Thermafil e GIV - Híbrida de Tagger. Os canais foram obturados com o cimento AH Plus misturado ao corante Rodamina. Feitas as obturações, realizou-se a remoção coronária e as raízes foram seccionadas no sentido horizontal, obtendo-se 3 fatias (2 mm de espessura) : cervical, médio e apical. Após o preparo, as fatias foram submetidas à mensuração da área total do canal radicular e da área de guta-percha, por meio de objetiva Plan S 1. 0 X acoplada à câmera digital e do {{software}} Axiovision 4. 8. A área do cimento obturador foi determinada pela <b>fórmula</b> <b>Área</b> do cana = Área guta-percha + Área cimento + Área espaços vazios. A resistência de união foi avaliada pelo teste de push-out e as falhas foram observadas em microscópio digital. Os dados foram analisados por Análise de Variância a dois critérios e teste Tukey HSD (p 0, 05). Os canais obturados pelas técnicas Thermafil e Schilder Modificada proporcionaram maiores áreas de guta-percha, diferindo estatisticamente dos obturados pelas técnicas de Cone único e Hibrida de Tagger (p 0. 05). Root′s canal filled by Thermafil and Schilder′s Modified had higher gutta-percha′s area than Single Cone and Tagger′s Hybrid techniques (p < 0. 05). The {{analysis of the}} sealer′s area, proved that the specimens filled by Thermafil and Schilder′s Modified had smaller sealer′s area, differing from Tagger′s Hybrid and Single Cone (p < 0. 05) techniques. Bond strength′s results demonstrated a significant difference for techniques, thirds and the interaction of this factors (p < 0. 05). Roots canals filled by Tagger′s hybrid technique had higher bond strength than Single Cone, Schilder′s Modified Thermafil techniques (p < 0. 05). There was {{a statistically significant difference}} between the thirds (p < 0. 05), and the apical third showed the highest bond strength′s value. The analysis of interaction technique versus third, showed that the specimens filled by Taggers Hybrid in the apical third had the highest bond strength, different from the other techniques and thirds (p < 0. 05). Adhesive failures were more frequent in all groups. It was concluded that the highest area occupied of gutta-percha and the less sealer′s area were found in roots canals filled with Schilder′s Modified and Thermafil techniques. The highest bond strength was found in roots canals filled by Tagger′s Hybrid technique, especially in the apical third...|$|E

40|$|Fourteen patients, aged 1 {{month to}} 13 years, with {{congenital}} semilunar valve stenosis (11 pulmonary and 3 aortic) were studied for orifice area quantification calculated from a Doppler echocardiographic equation: Area = SV/ 0. 88 × V 2 × VET, where SV = stroke volume, V 2 = maximal velocity and VET = ventricular ejection time. Results from individual measurements {{used in this}} formula and derived area were compared with individual results from cardiac catheterization and valve area derived from the Gorlin formula. Ventricular ejection time by cardiac catheterization ranged from 0. 17 to 0. 44 second (mean ± standard deviation [SD] 0. 27 ± 0. 09), and by Doppler study from 0. 20 to 0. 41 second (mean ± SD 0. 29 ± 0. 06) (r = 0. 65, standard error of the estimate [SEE] = 0. 03, y = 0. 149 + 0. 528 x). Pressure gradient by catheterization ranged from 30 to 125 mm Hg (mean ± SD 56. 6 ± 33. 1), and by Doppler study from 17. 6 to 100 mm Hg (mean ± SD 46. 8 ± 27. 9) (r = 0. 91, SEE = 8. 8, y = 1. 23 + 0. 904 x). Stroke volume was measured by Doppler study simultaneously with cardiac catheterization in nine patients; results at cardiac catheterization with thermodilution measurements (cardiac output/heart rate) ranged from 5. 5 to 53. 4 cc (mean ± SD 24. 7 ± 20), and by Doppler study from 5. 8 to 46. 9 cc (mean ± SD 23 ± 18) (r = 0. 96, SEE = 3. 5). Area quantification was performed in two ways. In Group 1, heart rate-matched stroke volumes from cardiac catheterization {{were used in the}} derived equation for Doppler study (all patients). In Group 2, the stroke volume used was that obtained by Doppler study, which was performed simultaneously with cardiac catheterization (nine patients). Results for Gorlin <b>formula</b> <b>area</b> quantification in Group 1 ranged from 0. 05 to 1. 42 cm 2 (mean ± SD 0. 41 ± 0. 36), and for the Doppler-derived equation in this group from 0. 05 to 0. 91 cm 2 (mean ± SD 0. 32 ± 0. 25) (r = 0. 90, SEE = 0. 08, y = 0. 053 ± 0. 665 x). When results were compared in the simultaneously studied patients, catheterization (Gorlin formula) -calculated areas ranged from 0. 05 to 1. 424 cm 2 (mean ± SD 0. 52 ± 0. 42), and for the Doppler-derived equation, areas ranged from 0. 06 to 0. 97 cm 2 (mean ± SD 0. 35 ± 0. 29) (r = 0. 94, SEE = 0. 07, y = 0. 037 ± 0. 656 x).
