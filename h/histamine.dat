5|$|Histamines are {{proteins}} {{associated with}} many allergic reactions. When the UV radiation or light {{comes in contact}} with a person with solar urticaria, <b>histamine</b> is released from mast cells. When this occurs, the permeability of vessels near the area of <b>histamine</b> release is increased. This allows blood fluid to enter the vessels and cause inflammation. Antihistamines suppress {{the activity of the}} <b>histamine.</b>|$|E
5|$|For {{people who}} are not {{eligible}} for a stem cell transplant, immunotherapy with a combination of <b>histamine</b> dihydrochloride (Ceplene) and interleukin 2 (Proleukin) after the completion of consolidation has been shown to reduce the absolute relapse risk by 14%, translating to a 50% increase in the likelihood of maintained remission.|$|E
5|$|An inverse agonist {{can have}} effects {{similar to those}} of an antagonist, but causes a {{distinct}} set of downstream biological responses. Constitutively active receptors that exhibit intrinsic or basal activity can have inverse agonists, which not only block the effects of binding agonists like a classical antagonist but also inhibit the basal activity of the receptor. Many drugs previously classified as antagonists are now beginning to be reclassified as inverse agonists because of the discovery of constitutive active receptors. Antihistamines, originally classified as antagonists of <b>histamine</b> H1 receptors have been reclassified as inverse agonists.|$|E
5|$|Timmy, {{the late}} Jimmy's friend, asks Langly {{to attend a}} Dungeons & Dragons game in Jimmy's honor. The game, however, is a setup to inject Langly with a drug that {{effectively}} controls the subject's mind, much like Scully and Jimmy. Frohike finds an extremely flirtatious Scully at the bar with a large cluster of men around her. He takes {{her back to the}} suite where Susanne recognizes the effects of the drug, which she identifies as anoetic <b>histamine.</b> She reveals that she had not actually made the compound, except for a small batch accessible only to her and Grant, confirming his betrayal.|$|E
5|$|The full {{profile of}} amphetamine's {{short-term}} drug effects in humans is mostly derived through increased cellular communication or neurotransmission of dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine, epinephrine, <b>histamine,</b> CART peptides, endogenous opioids,C]carfentanil binding in several {{regions of the}} human brain, including the basal ganglia, frontal cortex, and thalamus (Colasanti et al. 2012). Oral administration of d-amphetamine, 0.5mg/kg, 3h before carfentanil injection, reduced BPND values by 2–10%. The results were confirmed in another group of subjects (Mick et al. 2014). However, Guterstam and colleagues observed no change in carfentanil binding when d-amphetamine, 0.3mg/kg, was administered intravenously directly before injection of carfentanil (Guterstam et al. 2013). It has been hypothesized that this discrepancy {{may be related to}} delayed increases in extracellular opioid peptide concentrations following amphetamine-evoked monoamine release (Colasanti et al. 2012; Mick et al. 2014).}} adrenocorticotropic hormone, corticosteroids, and glutamate, which it effects through interactions with , , , , , , and possibly other biological targets.|$|E
5|$|Antibodies are glycoproteins {{belonging}} to the immunoglobulin superfamily. They constitute most of the gamma globulin fraction of the blood proteins. They are typically made of basic structural units—each with two large heavy chains and two small light chains. There are several different types of antibody heavy chains that define the five different types of crystallisable fragments (Fc) that may {{be attached to the}} antigen-binding fragments. The five different types of Fc regions allow antibodies to be grouped into five isotypes. Each Fc region of a particular antibody isotype is able to bind to its specific Fc Receptor (except for IgD, which is essentially the BCR), thus allowing the antigen-antibody complex to mediate different roles depending on which FcR it binds. The ability of an antibody to bind to its corresponding FcR is further modulated by the structure of the glycan(s) present at conserved sites within its Fc region. The ability of antibodies to bind to FcRs helps to direct the appropriate immune response for each different type of foreign object they encounter. For example, IgE is responsible for an allergic response consisting of mast cell degranulation and <b>histamine</b> release. IgE's Fab paratope binds to allergic antigen, for example house dust mite particles, while its Fc region binds to Fc receptor ε. The allergen-IgE-FcRε interaction mediates allergic signal transduction to induce conditions such as asthma.|$|E
25|$|Alcohol {{is known}} to have close {{interactions}} with <b>histamine</b> release. Alcohol both stimulates the release of <b>histamine</b> from mast cells and inhibits its degradations by inhibiting diamine oxidase. Though <b>histamine</b> is used by the body to mediate alcohol-induced gastric and intestinal damage as well as alcohol flushing, it is possible that elevated levels of <b>histamine</b> might have a correlation with referred itch (or even itch in general).|$|E
25|$|<b>Histamine</b> H3 receptors are {{expressed}} in {{the central nervous system}} {{and to a lesser extent}} the peripheral nervous system, where they act as autoreceptors in presynaptic histaminergic neurons, and also control <b>histamine</b> turnover by feedback inhibition of <b>histamine</b> synthesis and release. The H3 receptor has also been shown to presynaptically inhibit the release of a number of other neurotransmitters (i.e. it acts as an inhibitory heteroreceptor) including, but probably not limited to dopamine, GABA, acetylcholine, noradrenaline, <b>histamine</b> and serotonin.|$|E
25|$|In 1964, it {{was known}} that <b>histamine</b> stimulated the {{secretion}} of stomach acid, and also that traditional antihistamines {{had no effect on}} acid production. From these facts the SK scientists postulated the existence of two different types of <b>histamine</b> receptors. They designated the one acted upon by the traditional antihistamines as H1, and the one acted upon by <b>histamine</b> to stimulate the secretion of stomach acid as H2.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} (1964), <b>histamine</b> {{was known to}} stimulate the {{secretion}} of stomach acid, but also that traditional antihistamines {{had no effect on}} acid production. In the process, the SK scientists also proved the existence of <b>histamine</b> H2 receptors.|$|E
25|$|The {{hypersensitivity}} {{response is}} mediated by IgE, an antibody {{produced by the}} horse's immune system which binds the allergens, causing a cascade production of <b>histamine</b> and cytokines which make the horse's skin inflamed and itchy. Of these, <b>histamine</b> appears the most important in the initial phase of reaction.|$|E
25|$|Histamine: {{imipramine}} is an antagonist of the <b>histamine</b> H1 receptors.|$|E
25|$|The {{underlying}} mechanism typically involves <b>histamine</b> or bradykinin. The version {{related to}} <b>histamine</b> is to due {{an allergic reaction}} to agents such as insect bites, foods, or medications. The version related to bradykinin may occur due to an inherited problem known as C1 esterase inhibitor deficiency, medications known as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, or a lymphoproliferative disorder.|$|E
25|$|Three other neurotransmitters work centrally. Dopamine may {{accelerate}} vestibular compensation. Norepinephrine modulates {{the intensity}} of central reactions to vestibular stimulation and facilitates compensation. <b>Histamine</b> is present only centrally, but its role is unclear. Dopamine, <b>histamine,</b> serotonin, and acetylcholine are neurotransmitters thought to produce vomiting. It is known that centrally acting antihistamines modulate the symptoms of acute symptomatic vertigo.|$|E
25|$|Cimetidine's {{mechanism}} of action as an antacid is as a <b>histamine</b> H2 receptor antagonist.|$|E
25|$|During REM sleep, {{the release}} of the neurotransmitters norepinephrine, {{serotonin}} and <b>histamine</b> is completely suppressed.|$|E
25|$|In recent research, he {{has shown}} that people with low vitamin C levels have very high blood <b>histamine</b> levels.|$|E
25|$|They excrete two {{chemicals}} that {{aid in the}} body's defenses: <b>histamine</b> and heparin. <b>Histamine</b> is responsible for widening blood vessels and increasing {{the flow of blood}} to injured tissue. It also makes blood vessels more permeable so neutrophils and clotting proteins can get into connective tissue more easily. Heparin is an anticoagulant that inhibits blood clotting and promotes the movement of white blood cells into an area. Basophils can also release chemical signals that attract eosinophils and neutrophils to an infection site.|$|E
25|$|The H2 antagonists are {{competitive}} antagonists of <b>histamine</b> at the parietal cell's H2 receptor. They {{suppress the}} normal secretion of acid by parietal cells and the meal-stimulated secretion of acid. They accomplish this by two mechanisms: <b>Histamine</b> released by ECL {{cells in the}} stomach is blocked from binding on parietal cell H2 receptors, which stimulate acid secretion; therefore, other substances that promote acid secretion (such as gastrin and acetylcholine) have a reduced effect on parietal cells when the H2 receptors are blocked.|$|E
25|$|<b>Histamine</b> H1 receptors: {{effects on}} these receptors account for its {{sedation}} and reduction in vigilance. This may {{also lead to}} drowsiness and weight gain.|$|E
25|$|Mast {{cells are}} {{a type of}} innate immune cell that reside in {{connective}} tissue and in the mucous membranes. They are intimately associated with wound healing and defense against pathogens, but are also often associated with allergy and anaphylaxis. When activated, mast cells rapidly release characteristic granules, rich in <b>histamine</b> and heparin, along with various hormonal mediators and chemokines, or chemotactic cytokines into the environment. <b>Histamine</b> dilates blood vessels, causing the characteristic signs of inflammation, and recruits neutrophils and macrophages.|$|E
25|$|Prostaglandin (PGD2) is {{the primary}} cause of the {{flushing}} reaction, with serotonin appearing to have a secondary role in this reaction. The effect is mediated by prostaglandin E2 and D2 due to GPR109A activation of epidermal Langerhans cells and keratinocytes. Langerhans cells use cyclooxygenase type 1 (COX-1) for PGE2 production and are more responsible for acute flushing, while keratinocytes are COX-2 dependent and are in active continued vasodilation. Flushing was often thought to involve <b>histamine,</b> but <b>histamine</b> has been shown not {{to be involved in the}} reaction.|$|E
25|$|Chlorpromazine {{and other}} {{antipsychotics}} with sedative properties such as promazine and thioridazine {{are among the}} most potent agents at α-adrenergic receptors. Furthermore, they are also among the most potent antipsychotics at <b>histamine</b> H1 receptors. This finding is in agreement with the pharmaceutical development of chlorpromazine and other antipsychotics as anti-histamine agents. Furthermore, the brain has a higher density of <b>histamine</b> H1 receptors than any body organ examined which may account for why chlorpromazine and other phenothiazine antipsychotics are as potent at these sites as the most potent classical antihistamines.|$|E
25|$|Antagonizing H1 <b>histamine</b> receptors causes {{sedation}} and {{may cause}} weight gain, although antagonistic actions at serotonin 5-HT2C and dopamine D2 receptors {{have also been}} associated with weight gain and appetite stimulation.|$|E
25|$|Azelastine is a potent, second-generation, selective, <b>histamine</b> {{antagonist}} (histamine-H1-receptor antagonist) {{used as a}} {{first line}} therapy of mild intermittent, moderate/severe intermittent and mild persistent rhinitis (new classification system for rhinitis).|$|E
25|$|He {{was able}} to relate the above {{observation}} to abruptio placentae, as women with low ascorbate (Vitamin C) and high <b>histamine</b> levels are prone to develop premature separation of the placenta.|$|E
25|$|Food intolerances can {{be caused}} by enzymatic defects in the {{digestive}} system, can also result from pharmacological effects of vasoactive amines present in foods (e.g. <b>Histamine),</b> among other metabolic, pharmacological and digestive abnormalities.|$|E
25|$|Cimetidine, {{sold under}} {{the brand name}} Tagamet among others, is a <b>histamine</b> H2 {{receptor}} antagonist that inhibits stomach acid production. It is available over-the-counter and is mainly used {{in the treatment of}} heartburn and peptic ulcers.|$|E
25|$|The {{therapeutic}} {{effects of}} Nimesulide {{are the result}} of its complex mode of action, which targets a number of key mediators of the inflammatory process such as: COX-2 mediated prostaglandins, free radicals, proteolytic enzymes, and <b>histamine.</b>|$|E
25|$|Because {{dextromethorphan}} {{can trigger}} a <b>histamine</b> release (allergic reaction), atopic children, who are especially susceptible to allergic reactions, should be administered dextromethorphan only if absolutely necessary, and only under the strict supervision of a healthcare professional.|$|E
25|$|Food {{intolerance}} are {{all other}} adverse reactions to food. Subgroups include enzymatic (e.g. lactose intolerance due to lactase deficiency), pharmacological (e.g. reactions against biogenic amines, <b>histamine</b> intolerance), and undefined food intolerance (e.g. against some food additives).|$|E
25|$|In {{anaphylactic shock}} low blood {{pressure}} is related to decreased systemic vascular resistance (SVR) triggered primarily by a massive release of <b>histamine</b> by mast cells activated by antigen-bound immunoglobulin E and also by increased production and release of prostaglandins.|$|E
25|$|There {{is a lot}} of {{interest}} in the <b>histamine</b> H3 receptor as a potential therapeutic target because of its involvement in the neuronal mechanism behind many cognitive H3R-disorders and especially its location in the central nervous system.|$|E
25|$|Food allergies are immune reactions, {{typically}} an IgE reaction {{caused by}} the release of <b>histamine</b> but also encompassing non-IgE immune responses. This mechanism causes allergies to typically give immediate reaction (a few minutes to a few hours) to foods.|$|E
25|$|Diazepam binds {{with high}} {{affinity}} to glial cells in animal cell cultures. Diazepam at high doses {{has been found}} to decrease <b>histamine</b> turnover in mouse brain via diazepam's action at the benzodiazepine-GABA receptor complex. Diazepam also decreases prolactin release in rats.|$|E
25|$|Morphine induced {{pruritus}} syndrome {{may also}} be caused by release of <b>histamine</b> from mast cells in the skin (Gunion et al. (2004). Paus et al. (2006) report that opioid μ-receptors and opioid κ-receptors are located in skin nerves and keratinocytes.|$|E
