60|$|On {{the first}} Tuesday of her visit Miss Mackenzie {{had gone with}} her uncle and aunt, and even she <b>had</b> <b>found</b> the pace to be very slow, and the whole affair to be very dull. Her uncle had once enlivened the thing by asking her whether she <b>had</b> <b>found</b> any lovers since she went to Littlebath, and this {{question}} had perplexed her very much.

Even though phylogenetic analyses recognize Paranthodon as a stegosaurid, the type material actually bears no synapomorphies of Stegosauria. However, the material is likely of stegosaurian nature, and phylogenies by many authors <b>have</b> <b>found</b> it to be within the group.|$|E
