Of course, I don't know that any of these men will apply for reinstatement, but if they do, the above are at least a few of the rules that will be enforced. Just keep in mind that, regardless {{of the verdict}} of juries, baseball is competent to protect itself against crooks, {{both inside and outside the}} game.|$|E
5|$|Wade also {{discusses}} {{the origin of}} Jews; they descend from the Middle East through their Y chromosomes, but their mitochondrial DNA resembles that of their host countries. Citing Gregory Cochran and Henry Harpending, Wade argues that Ashkenazi Jews were historically forced into intellectually demanding occupations by their European hosts, and these selective pressures favoured genes that raised their intelligence. The consequence of this, however, {{was an increase in}} sphingolipid diseases. The final chapter, Evolution, gives a summary of human evolution from its origins to the present, and declares that it is unlikely that <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>ever</b> cease. Wade speculates where evolution will lead humans in the future, suggesting further skeletal gracilisation, increases in intelligence, adaptations to the changing climate, and even the possibility of speciation.|$|E

The Taxation Law Amendment Act of 30 September 2009 commenced on 1 January 2010 and granted a 2-year window period from 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2011, affording a natural person the opportunity to take transfer of the residence with advantage of no transfer duty being payable or CGT consequences. Whilst taxpayers can take advantage of this opening of a window of opportunity, it is not likely that <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>ever</b> become available thereafter.|$|E

25|$|Benambra Primary School was {{the last}} {{surviving}} of the schools on the Omeo Plains, with children transported to the school by a small bus from outlying areas such as The Brothers and Uplands until as recently as 1998. Benambra Primary School continued until 2002 when the enrolment was nine students, and closed {{at the end of}} that year when projected enrolments for the following year dropped to as low as one student. Benambra Primary School is officially still a going concern under the caretakership of the Benambra Neighbourhood House, however it seems unlikely at this stage that <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>ever</b> again open for students.|$|E

He appears to have done no more work on the project until early September, when he confides to his diary that it is [...] "in serious danger of becoming dull", and expresses doubts that <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>ever</b> be finished. However, Waugh apparently found fresh inspiration after reading A Cypress [...] Grove, an essay by the 17th-century Scots poet William Drummond of Hawthornden, and considered retitling his story The Fabulous Paladins after a passage in the essay.|$|E
500|$|Elisenberg Station (...) is an {{unfinished}} railway station within the Oslo Tunnel on the Drammen Line in Oslo, Norway. The ghost station was partially built during {{the construction of}} the tunnel between 1971 and 1980, but has never been put into use. It is located between Nationaltheatret Station and Skøyen Station, at Elisenberg in Frogner. A [...] long center platform and part of the access way has been built, but never completed. While the station initially was not put into use because of lack of funds to complete it, it is now unlikely that <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>ever</b> be completed, as the need for a station has disappeared and an opening would need a large investment of funds.|$|E

500|$|In October 2002, another Nickelodeon series, The Fairly OddParents, {{ranked as}} the No. 2 program for {{children}} between 2 and 11 years old. Its ratings {{at that time}} were almost equal to SpongeBob SquarePants then-average of 2.2 million viewers per episode. The Fairly OddParents even briefly surpassed SpongeBob SquarePants, causing the latter series to drop into second place — at this time, The Fairly OddParents had a 6.2 rating and nearly 2.5 million child viewers, while SpongeBob SquarePants had a 6.0 rating and 2.4 million kids 2–11. Nickelodeon [...] "recognized" [...] The Fairly OddParents for its climbing ratings and installed it into a new 8 P.M. time slot, previously occupied by SpongeBob SquarePants. In an interview, Cyma Zarghami, then-general manager and {{executive vice president of}} Nickelodeon, said, [...] "Are we banking on the fact that Fairly OddParents will be the next SpongeBob? ...

500|$|At the time, {{the use of}} such robust {{force against}} Katanga, {{including}} aircraft, artillery, and armoured vehicles, aroused much controversy. Though personally dismayed by the violence as a Bhuddist, Thant thought the operation was justified. His reasoning for such strong action fell in line with just war theory. Proponents of Katanga argued that the secessionist movement was a legitimate exercise of self-determination. Thant refuted the idea in his memoirs, listing three primary objections: first, the Congo had been admitted into the UN in 1960 as a [...] "unified state" [...] with the written agreement of Tshombe. Second, [...] "no sovereign state in the world ever recognized the independence of Katanga". Third, Tshombe's government was [...] "never able to exercise effective control" [...] over the entirety of the province. Military researcher Walter Dorn speculates that Thant may have been personally sensitive to the issue of secession, having suffered from the bloody Karen conflict in his native Burma and witnessed the consequences of the Partition of India. Holding office during a time of widespread decolonization in Africa and Asia, Thant was mindful of the precedent he was setting; recognizing or encouraging secession in one country could allow it to spread to others with fractious consequences. As late as February 1970, he denounced secession, declaring that the UN [...] "has never accepted and does not accept, and I do not believe <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>ever</b> accept, the principle of secession of a part of its Member State." ...|$|E
500|$|On March 30, 2009, it was {{confirmed}} that Taylor and the Junk Beer Kidnap Band would be performing at Rockfest in 2009. The group performed on April 24, 2009 at People's Court in Des Moines, Iowa, marking Taylor's first official solo show. Taylor performs with his band the Dum Fux, who make covers for 1970s punk rock and 1980s hair metal. Taylor also performs with Audacious P, {{a band that}} is primarily a Tenacious D cover band. Rapper Tech N9ne confirmed that Taylor was to perform on his album K.O.D., but was removed because Taylor did not submit his vocals in time. Taylor recently admitted that he tried out for the vacant singer spot in the band Velvet Revolver, but said that it just did not work out. However, according to a recent Billboard article, it seems likely that he may in fact become the vocalist for Velvet Revolver, though no official confirmation has been made. Duff McKagan added that they can neither [...] "confirm or deny" [...] Taylor's membership in the band but believes that Taylor is the [...] "real deal". Slash has since ruled Corey out as the possible new vocalist explaining that [...] " [...] just wasn't right" [...] although he does love him. He however, has recorded 10 new songs with the band, drummer Matt Sorum stated it's unlikely <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>ever</b> be released. Taylor explained to Mark Hoppus on Hoppus on Music that McKagan and he were writing new music for a possible new supergroup.|$|E
