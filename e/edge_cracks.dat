50|$|Crash cymbals {{are often}} the first ones in a drum set to warp and {{ultimately}} crack, due to repeated striking of the edge. Cymbal cracking is generally {{in the form of}} a fracture along the edge, or across the bow, often originating from the <b>edge.</b> <b>Cracks</b> in cymbals are caused by poor technique or excessive play, or more rarely as a result of a defect originating from manufacture, or damage to the cymbal not caused by playing, for example dropping. If a crack is left untreated, it will begin to follow the lathe grooves around the cymbal, and could potentially spread all the way around the cymbal and back to the point where the crack started, causing the outer portion of a cymbal to simply drop off.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The damage {{process of}} {{transverse}} cracks in cross-ply and quasi-isotropic toughened CFRP laminates under static loading is studied. To investigate specimen configuration effect on width-direction propagation of transverse cracks, coupon specimens with ranges of specimen width and transverse ply thickness are tested. Detailed observations of transverse cracks {{indicate that there}} are consecutive three-stage processes of <b>edge</b> <b>crack</b> initiation, <b>edge</b> <b>crack</b> increase without inward propagation, and crack propagation across the width in quasi-isotropic laminates, whereas simultaneous transverse crack propagation takes place across the width in conjunction with new <b>edge</b> <b>crack</b> formation in cross-ply laminates. The detailed process of transverse cracking is investigated using three-dimensional FEA in order to clarify the difference of damage process between quasi-isotropic and cross-ply laminates. It is shown that damage mode transition from <b>edge</b> <b>cracking</b> to widthwise propagation can be characterized with energy release rates near free-edges and inner regions. Finally, an average propagation model based on the conventional two-dimensional models is presented and verified with experimental results and FEA.

40|$|<b>Edge</b> <b>cracks</b> {{affect the}} quality of rolled strip and the {{efficiency}} of production. The objective {{of this study is to}} improve our understanding of the evolution of <b>edge</b> <b>cracks</b> in cold rolling of thin strip. Experimental research and mechanics analysis were developed to investigate the effects of rolling parameters and initial microstructures on the evolution of <b>edge</b> <b>cracks</b> during rolling. Low carbon steel was prepared for experiments on a Hille 100 experimental rolling mill to examine the characteristics of <b>edge</b> <b>cracks</b> during cold rolling. The characteristics of <b>edge</b> <b>cracks</b> were evaluated by specific instruments, such as the Atomic Force Microscope (AFM), Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) and surface profile-meters. An Electron Backscattered Diffraction (EBSD) technique was also used to analyse the features of rolled strips with <b>edge</b> <b>cracks.</b> The results obtained from the experiments show that rolling parameters such as thickness reduction, rolling speed and lubrication have significant effects on the initiation and propagation of <b>edge</b> <b>cracks.</b> A crack on the break area produced by a worn trimmed edge is much larger than that on the cut area, and the surface quality of the break area affects the growth of the crack. The crack increases with the ratio of edge drop, which indicates that the edge drop has a significant effect on <b>edge</b> <b>cracks.</b> When the total reduction in thickness exceeds 85 % (for this experiment, the thickness is about 0. 15 mm), the crack increases significantly and the reduction distribution also has a significant effect on the <b>edge</b> <b>cracks.</b> AFM and SEM observations have confirmed that the <b>edge</b> <b>cracks</b> originate from the porosity and the grooves of rougher surface. Rougher strip surface increases the concentration of stress and acts as a source of crack initiation during edge cracking. The initial microstructure of the rolled strip affects the initiation and propagation of <b>edge</b> <b>cracks.</b> Edge cracking was found to be sensitive to the size of the grain in the microstructure. The grain boundary is a barrier for edge crack initiation. A finer grain structure can increase the range of threshold stress intensity and also decrease the probability of crack initiation. A coarse microstructure resists crack propagation better due to blunted crack tip. Sheared edges and lubrication can delay the initiation and propagation of <b>edge</b> <b>cracks.</b> TEM shows that there are high density dislocations around the tip of edge crack and the inhomogeneous structure in a non-cracked area is a potential crack propagation direction. The stress intensity factor (SIF) solution to <b>edge</b> <b>cracks</b> has been investigated. The effective range of the stress intensity factor is of importance in defining crack growth rate. The efficiency and reliability of SIF analytical modelling has been demonstrated and the weight function was also applied in edge crack analysis. Three dimensional finite element method (FEM) was proposed to simulate the propagation of <b>edge</b> <b>cracks</b> in cold rolling of thin strip. The increasing pressure around the edge of the strip accelerates the propagation of <b>edge</b> <b>cracks.</b> More reduction causes more inhomogeneous deformation between the centre and the edge of rolled strip, which extends the <b>edge</b> <b>cracks</b> significantly. Light pass reduction and lubrication to reduce the propagation of <b>edge</b> <b>cracks</b> are recommended. The simulation provided further important information for improving the edge quality of rolled strip. The optimum condition to eliminate edge crack has been discussed and the proposed method for predicting edge crack can be utilised to make defect free products from rolling processes. It is recommended that using more lubrication could clarify how rolling conditions affect the evolution of <b>edge</b> <b>cracks.</b> The influence of the diameter of work rolls should be investigated, together with the testing of a wide range of materials including various chemical compositions and other steels. Further research about the effect of surface roughness and oxidation on <b>edge</b> <b>cracks</b> and the Crystal Plastic (CP) application in the analysis of the influence mechanism of microstructure on crack formation is also recommended...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Magnesium alloys show low {{deformability}} at {{low temperature}} because of hcp structure and inactiveness of basal slip. Manufacturing of thin sheet is difficult in industries. Some approaches, such as small-draft multi-pass rolling, intermediate annealing, isothermal rolling and high-speed rolling were proposed {{to overcome the}} deformability. However, small <b>edge</b> <b>cracks</b> are still formed on the sheet. In this study, rolling speed of 1000 m/min was employed to warm-roll AZ 31 B magnesium alloy {{in a single pass}} at different temperatures. The <b>edge</b> <b>cracks</b> formed after the rolling were classified into three main groups: minor, regular and zigzag <b>edge</b> <b>cracks.</b> ‘Crack contact length ’ are introduced to explain the morphology of <b>edge</b> <b>cracks.</b> The results show that the critical reduction for crack initiation depends on the pre-heating temperature. The spacing between <b>edge</b> <b>cracks</b> increases linearly with the crack contact length regardless of roll diameter, speed and reduction.

50|$|<b>Edge</b> <b>cracking</b> is the {{formation}} of crescent-shaped <b>cracks</b> near the <b>edge</b> of a road.
