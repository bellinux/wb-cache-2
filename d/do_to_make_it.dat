500|$|Constantine {{was awarded}} a life peerage in 1969, {{becoming}} the first black man {{to sit in the}} House of Lords; there were rumours that Trinidad had prevented earlier attempts to ennoble him. He took the title of Baron Constantine of Maraval in Trinidad and Nelson in the County Palatine of Lancaster. His investiture attracted widespread media attention; Constantine stated: [...] "I think it must have been for what I have endeavoured to <b>do</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> possible for people of different colour to know each other better and live well together." [...] He sat as a crossbencher in the House, but was well enough to make only one speech in his time there.|$|E
500|$|Of the film's {{success with}} Western audiences, Miike {{states that he}} was not surprised, but that he had [...] "no idea {{what goes on in the}} minds of people in the West and I don't pretend to know what their tastes are. And I don't want to start {{thinking}} about that. It's nice that they liked my movie, but I'm not going to start deliberately worrying about why or what I can <b>do</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> happen again". Actress Eihi Shiina stated that, in Japan, only a certain type of film fan would watch Audition. By comparison, she said, the film was seen by many more people overseas, which she attributed to [...] "good timing".|$|E

I pointed out to them the exact position of the cove, but it was so shut in that even when I showed where it was, it was {{as much as they could}} <b>do</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> out.|$|E

6000|$|The {{kangaroo}} still {{continues to}} grow, {{which is very}} strange and perplexing. I never knew one to be so long getting its growth. It has fur on its head now; not like kangaroo fur, but exactly like our hair, except that it is much finer and softer, and instead of being black is red. I am like to lose my mind over the capricious and harassing developments of this unclassifiable zoological freak. If I could catch another one--but that is hopeless; {{it is a new}} variety, and the only sample; this is plain. But I caught a true kangaroo and brought it in, thinking that this one, being lonesome, would rather have that for company than have no kin at all, or any animal it could feel a nearness to or get sympathy from in its forlorn condition here among strangers who do not know its ways or habits, or what to <b>do</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> feel that it is among friends; but it was a mistake--it went into such fits {{at the sight of the}} kangaroo that I was convinced it had never seen one before. I pity the poor noisy little animal, but there is nothing I can <b>do</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> happy. If I could tame it--but that is out of the question; the more I try, the worse I seem to make it. It grieves me to the heart to see it in its little storms of sorrow and passion. I wanted to let it go, but she wouldn't hear of it. That seemed cruel and not like her; and yet she may be right. It might be lonelier than ever; for since I cannot find another one, how could it? ...|$|E

There!" [...] cried Miss Jillgall, as the cook majestically left the room, without even looking at her, [...] "I have done my best to make it up, and you see how my advances are received. What more could I have done? I really ask you, dear, as a friend, what more could I have done?" ...|$|E

60|$|As {{every one}} knows that {{a great part of}} the {{constitution}} of the Irish House of Commons was formed about the year 1614 expressly for bringing that House into a state of dependence, and that the new representative was at that time seated and installed by force and violence, nothing can be more impolitic than for those who wish the House to stand on its present basis (as, for one, I most sincerely <b>do)</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> appear to have kept too much the principle of its first institution, and to continue to be as little a virtual as it is an actual representative of the commons. It is the degeneracy of such an institution, so vicious in its principle, that is to be wished for. If men have the real benefit of a sympathetic representation, none but those who are heated and intoxicated with theory will look for any other. This sort of representation, my dear Sir, must wholly depend, not on the force with which it is upheld, but upon the prudence of those who have influence upon it. Indeed, without some such prudence in the use of authority, I do not know, at least in the present time, how any power can long continue.|$|E

30|$|We added one space, i.e. â â, to the {{beginning}} and end of each location string.

50|$|Although an {{effective}} and beneficial attribute, this design principle has also led to many of todayâs problems, limitations, and frustrations. Currently, {{it is almost impossible}} for most end-users to know why certain network-based applications do not work well and what they need to <b>do</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> better. Also, network operators who interact with the core in low-level terms such as router configuration have problems expressing their high-level goals into low-level actions. In high-level terms, this may be summarized as a weak coupling between the network and application layers of the overall system.|$|E
