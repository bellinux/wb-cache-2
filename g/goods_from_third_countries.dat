40|$|Recent {{decades have}} {{witnessed}} {{a surge of}} trade in intermediate goods and a proliferation of free trade agreements (FTAs). FTAs use rules of origin (RoO) to distinguish goods originating from member countries from those originating from third countries. In this paper, we show that the sourcing restrictions embedded in RoO greatly distort trade in intermediaries. We focus on the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), the world's largest FTA, and construct a unique dataset {{that allows us to}} map the input‐output linkages in its RoO. Using a difference‐in‐differences approach, we find that RoO on final goods reduced imports of intermediate <b>goods</b> <b>from</b> <b>third</b> <b>countries</b> by around 30 percentage points. Even if external tariffs are unchanged, FTAs may thus violate multilateral trade rules, by substantially increasing the level of protection faced by non‐members. This paper has been revised in July 2016, when it was submitted to the American Economic Review. It has received a Revise and Resubmit decision from this journal in December 2016. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|The European Union’s VAT {{system has}} become {{vulnerable}} to organised fraud schemes. In recent years, these schemes, undergoing {{a change in}} structure, have affected services and imports of <b>goods</b> <b>from</b> <b>third</b> <b>countries</b> and may also have shifted trade in goods among EU countries. Within the EU- 27, organised VAT fraud is estimated to amount to between € 20 billion and € 35 billion a year. The EU institutions and Member States have put forward several measures to tackle this problem, although some of these have placed a disproportionate burden on businesses. The article shows that need to maximise the effectiveness of anti-VAT-fraud strategy cannot be separated from a broad view {{of the problem and}} of the functioning of the VAT system as a whole. A drastic change in the VAT system might provide a robust defence against fraud but produce uncertain effects. Enhancing risk management and exchange of good practices is essential. Technology-based solutions appear to be a pragmatic and politically feasible approach to new challenges, with good prospects of success. VAT, tax evasion, fraud...|$|E
50|$|During {{his tenure}} he reduced the hours by a {{considerable}} number. At {{the beginning of}} his apprenticeship, hours were nominally from 6 am to 9 pm, with frequent extensions to 10 and 11 pm, astounding though it seems now. Samuel worked long and hard to get better organisation and enough staff to shorten these hours. First he got it to 8.30 pm, then seven, then six. Detentions beyond the nominal time still happened but he worked on those too. One way was a rule that everyone must wait until the last man had finished. This led the men themselves to correct inefficiency in the system. Finally the closing time got to 5 or 5.30. Note that, in the UK, we buy <b>goods</b> <b>from</b> <b>Third</b> World <b>countries</b> where long hours are still an issue.|$|R
25|$|International {{cooperation}} {{is an important}} theme for the party. This includes development cooperation with underdeveloped countries. GreenLeft wants to increase spending on development aid to 0.8% of the gross national product. It wants to open the European markets to <b>goods</b> <b>from</b> <b>Third</b> World <b>countries,</b> under conditions of fair trade. In order to ensure free and fair trade, it wants to increase and democratise international economic organisations such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. The party also favours greater international control over financial markets. GreenLeft favours European integration, but is critical about the current policies of the European Commission. It favoured the European Constitution, but after it was voted down in the 2005 referendum, GreenLeft advocated a new treaty which emphasised democracy and subsidiarity. The party is critical about the war against terrorism. It wants to strengthen the peacekeeping powers of the United Nations and reform the Dutch armed forces into a peace force, with the functions of NATO to {{be taken over by}} the European Union and the United Nations.|$|R
50|$|Although {{relations}} remained {{close and}} friendly, the Bhutanese government expressed {{a need to}} renegotiate parts of the treaty to enhance Bhutan's sovereignty. Bhutan began to slowly assert an independent attitude in foreign affairs by joining the United Nations in 1971, recognising Bangladesh and signing a new trade agreement in 1972 that provided an exemption from export duties for <b>goods</b> <b>from</b> Bhutan to <b>third</b> <b>countries.</b> Bhutan exerted its independent stance at the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) summit conference in Havana, Cuba also in 1979, by voting with China and some Southeast Asian countries rather than with India {{on the issue of}} allowing Cambodia's Khmer Rouge to be seated at the conference. Unlike in Nepal, where its 1950 treaty with India {{has been the subject of}} great political controversy and nationalist resentment because of Indian immigrants in Nepal, the nature of Bhutan's relationship with India has not been affected by concerns over the treaty provisions. From 2003 to 2004, the Royal Bhutanese Army conducted operations against anti-India insurgents of the United Liberation Front of Assam (ULFA) that were operating bases in Bhutan and using its territory to carry out attacks on Indian soil.|$|R
40|$|Export legal {{regulation}} of the European Union {{as a part of}} common trade policy The thesis focuses on export of <b>goods</b> <b>from</b> EU to <b>third</b> <b>countries,</b> its {{legal regulation}} on both primary and secondary level and its display in the Czech legal regulation. Subsequently, the legal regulation is compared to export legal regulation of WTO. The aim of this comparison is to find out, whether there are any conflicts between EU and WTO regulations. Hypothesis consists of two thoughts: a) Legal regulation of export of goods as a part of EU common trade policy is embedded in EU law in detail. Export of goods is regulated (special) or banned in comparison to the regular export regime in certain cases; b) EU legal regulation of export of goods is in compliance with WTO legal regulation of export of goods. The descriptive, analytical (in part related to EU legal regulation) and comparative (in part related to WTO export regulation) methods were used when verifying the hypothesis. The thesis consists of two main parts. The first one aims to describe and analyze the EU common trade policy in relation to export of goods and its display in primary and secondary law. The aspects of common trade policy as an external activity is described as well. Based on this analysis, the thesis concludes that hypothesis "a) " is true and [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Does {{regionalism}} negatively impact non-members? To {{answer this}} question, {{we examine the}} effect of regional trade agreements (RTAs) on imports from non‐members and the tariffs that they face. Using data from six RTAs in Latin America and Europe, we do not find evidence that implementation of the regional agreements is associated with trade diversion <b>from</b> <b>third</b> <b>countries</b> to regional members. Using detailed industry data on preference margins and most‐favoured nation (MFN) tariffs for three trade agreements in Latin America over 12 years, we find that greater preference margins do not significantly reduce imports <b>from</b> <b>third</b> <b>countries.</b> We also look at the effect of preferences on external tariffs. We find evidence that preferential tariff reduction tends to precede the reduction of external MFN tariffs in a given sector, offering evidence of tariff complementarity. Overall, the results suggest that regionalism does not significantly harm non‐members. ...|$|R
