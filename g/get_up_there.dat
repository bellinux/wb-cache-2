Ebert endorsed Barack Obama for re-election as President in 2012.|$|E

500|$|The song's {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{was directed by}} Anthony Mandler, and shot on an indoor soundstage in Castaic, California on April 23, 2008. The concept for the video was [...] "high-end erotica". In an interview with James Montgomery for MTV News whilst on set of the music video, Levine provided a summary of what the video would entail, saying: [...] "It's this kind of ultra-glamorous, photography-based, late-'70s/ early-'80s situation. It's really stylish and really beautiful... It's the most choreographed thing I've ever done, because usually I just <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>there</b> and screw around. But with Rihanna, it's completely different and so cool." [...] In response, Rihanna continued to say that [...] "I don't {{do a lot of}} videos where I have so much chemistry with the other artist, and this is only my second duet in a video... It's really intense, because you have to work with each other so much. It's new for me, but I'm enjoying it." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "There's the Stanton place," [...] he said. [...] "Charlie has {{painted the}} house yellow--it {{used to be}} white; and Bob Hollman has cut the trees down behind the {{blacksmith}} forge. Bob never had any poetry in his soul--no romance, as you might say. He was {{what you might call}} a plodder--you might call him that. <b>Get</b> <b>up,</b> my nag, <b>get</b> <b>up.</b> <b>There's</b> the old Harkness place--seems to be spruced up considerable. Folks used to say if ye wanted to see how the world looked the morning after the flood just go into George Harkness's barn-yard on a rainy day. The pond and the old hills ain't changed any. <b>Get</b> <b>up,</b> my nag, <b>get</b> <b>up.</b> <b>There's</b> the Adams homestead. Do I really behold it again?" ...|$|R
60|$|Ulf {{found no}} {{difficulty}} in mounting to the top, {{although he was}} much longer than his companion in <b>getting</b> <b>up.</b> <b>There</b> were several sail following them, and Ulf {{was surprised at the}} knowledge his companion showed of vessels that appeared to him almost precisely similar.|$|R
2500|$|.....so {{nearsighted}} {{he carried}} about four different pairs of glasses with him...but by God, {{if you wanted}} a target bombed, he would hit it. He would hit it when everybody else missed. ...He got furious with me because I wouldn't let him <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>there</b> among the MiGs. I told him, 'Pappy, every fighter pilot in the Air Force knows and loves you, and I {{am not going to}} be the guy that sends you up there to get your butt scragged.' He just could not see anymore.|$|E

Mariah Carey, who was often compared to Houston, said, [...] "She [...] {{has been a}} big influence on me." [...] She later told USA Today that [...] "none of us would sound the same if Aretha Franklin hadn't ever put out a record, or Whitney Houston hadn't." [...] Celine Dion who was the third member of the troika that dominated female pop singing in the 1990s, did a telephone interview with Good Morning America on February 13, 2012, saying [...] "Whitney's been an amazing inspiration for me. I've been singing with her my whole career, actually. I wanted to have a career like hers, sing like her, look beautiful like her." [...] Beyoncé told the Globe and Mail that Houston [...] "inspired [...] to <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>there</b> and do what [...] did". She also wrote on her website on the day after Houston's death, [...] "I, like every singer, always wanted to be just like [...] Her voice was perfect. Strong but soothing. Soulful and classic. Her vibrato, her cadence, her control. So many of my life's memories are attached to a Whitney Houston song. She is our queen and she opened doors and provided a blueprint for all of us." ...|$|E

60|$|The crowd, nonplussed, now {{began to}} argue and shout and whistle. The voices rose in pitch and derision. Steam was <b>getting</b> <b>up.</b> <b>There</b> hung the flag. The {{procession}} crowded forward {{and filled the}} street in a mass below. All {{the rest of the}} street was empty and shut up. And still hung the showy rag, red and white and green, up aloft.|$|R
6000|$|... "They'd <b>get</b> it <b>up</b> <b>there.</b> Bad trails, canyons to head, steep climbs, wind-storms, {{thunder and}} lightning, rain, mountain-lions and wildcats." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "If {{a leader}} was to <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>there,</b> like you, with the {{arguments}} I could put into his hands, {{they would make}} the committee discharge that Pingsquit bill of the Gaylords', and pass it." ...|$|E

50|$|This {{is where}} one wrestler (usually a larger wrestler) backs {{up to the}} corner {{turnbuckles}} and allows another wrestler to climb the turnbuckle then up onto his/her shoulders, this wrestler then jumps off to perform any type of diving splash (i.e. Shooting star press) on a supine opponent. Sometimes this move sees the first wrestler climb up on the turnbuckle himself getting even higher before the second wrestler <b>gets</b> <b>up</b> <b>there</b> and jumps off him.|$|R

5000|$|Joel Stroetzel stated about Adam's stage {{personality}} saying: [...] "Adam {{likes to}} take the piss out of things. Just {{wants to have a}} good time—kind of act like an asshole, but in a funny way. He likes to get people going, egg the crowd on. He <b>gets</b> <b>up</b> <b>there</b> and calls the crowd ‘pussies’ and all this stuff. But coming from a guy wearing short shorts and a cape, you gotta take things like that in stride." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Only {{mention the}} alleviations. No, {{you are not}} to <b>get</b> <b>up</b> yet. <b>There's</b> no place for you to sit in, and the east wind is not greatly mitigated by the sea air. Shall I send Anna to read to you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very well done, lad," [...] {{the sailor}} said approvingly. [...] "You {{would make a}} good sailor, in time, if you took to a {{seafaring}} life. There's not one in ten as would <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>there,</b> the first time of going aloft. You don't feel giddy, do you?" ...|$|E
