5|$|Ann Arbor has a {{long history}} of {{openness}} to marijuana, given Ann Arbor's decriminalization of cannabis, the large number of medical marijuana dispensaries in the city (one dispensary, called People's Co-op, was directly across the street <b>from</b> <b>Michigan</b> Stadium until zoning forced it to move one mile to the west), the large number of pro-marijuana residents, and the annual Hash Bash: an event that is held on the first Saturday of April. Until (at least) the successful passage of Michigan's medical marijuana law, the event had arguably strayed from its initial intent, although for years, a number of attendees have received serious legal responses due to marijuana use on University of Michigan property, which does not fall under the city's progressive and compassionate ticketing program.|$|E
5|$|Boletus rubroflammeus is {{a species}} of bolete fungus in the family Boletaceae. First {{described}} <b>from</b> <b>Michigan</b> in 1971, it {{is found in the}} eastern United States and Mexico, where it grows in a mycorrhizal association with hardwood trees. The fruit bodies (mushrooms) of the fungus have caps that are deep red to purplish red, and dark red pores.

Other similar species can be distinguished by differences in distribution, morphology, staining reaction, and microscopic characteristics. Boletus rubroflammeus mushrooms are poisonous, and can cause gastrointestinal distress if consumed.|$|E

The students' investigation showed that the light comes from headlights of cars on US45 in the Paulding area.|$|E
