30|$|Example  7 {{contains}} an explicit negative appreciation towards the described phenomenon, that is, {{the erosion of}} fundamental rights in some EU member states. However, when studied in context, {{there is also a}} deeper meaning {{in the form of an}} implicit negative judgement towards those member states’ governments and public officials which are letting it happen. Moreover, affect often coincides with <b>engagement</b> as the <b>Committee</b> is alarmed is both an emotional response and a way of taking a stand. As examples  6 and 7 demonstrate, layered codings are necessary to capture all relevant meanings. Monika Bednarek (2007) indicates that lexical items often carry multiple voices (polyphony) and this also applies to systems of appraisal which have a tendency to co-occur within the same wording. Appraisive language is not one-dimensional: there is often more than one evaluative layer at play and the underlying meanings might get lost if we only focus on the superficial layer. Therefore, I assert that layered codings enrich the analysis and help in decoding the overall meaning of the message.|$|R

40|$|In this article, {{we compare}} two {{high-profile}} strategic policy reviews undertaken for the U. K. government on environmental risks: {{radioactive waste management}} and climate change. These reviews took very different forms, {{both in terms of}} analytic approach and deliberation strategy. The Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change was largely an exercise in expert modeling, building, within a cost-benefit framework, an argument for immediate reductions in carbon emissions. The Committee on Radioactive Waste Management, on the other hand, followed a much more explicitly deliberative and participative process, using multicriteria decision analysis to bring together scientific evidence and stakeholder and public values. In this article, we ask why the two reviews were different, and whether the differences are justified. We conclude that the differences were mainly due to political context, rather than the underpinning science, and as a consequence that, while in our view “fit for purpose,” they would both have been stronger had they been less different. Stern's grappling with ethical issues could have been strengthened by a greater degree of public and stakeholder <b>engagement,</b> and the <b>Committee</b> on Radioactive Waste Management's handling of issues of uncertainty could have been strengthened by the explicitly probabilistic framework of Stern...|$|R
