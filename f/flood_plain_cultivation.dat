40|$|The paper {{shows that}} pre-colonial ecologies of {{agricultural}} systems {{in some parts}} of rural Zambia were sustainable and resilient to prevailing environmental conditions, and were therefore able to ensure relative food security, under communal land tenure. However, colonial policies of land alienation and labour migration impacted negatively on food production systems of some ethnic groups like the citemene system of the Bemba and the <b>flood</b> <b>plain</b> <b>cultivation</b> system of the Lozi, making them extremely vulnerable due to the absence of large numbers of males. Paradoxically, the Tonga people in Southern Zambia responded positively to the introduction of modern methods of cultivation, exhibiting resilience by adapting and adopting the cultivation of hybrid maize and the ox-drawn plough. They also began to transform their land tenure system from being communal to become increasingly individualised. At independence in 1964, the UNIP government intervened strongly in promoting rural development (1964 - 1990), by subsidising maize production and by implementing protectionist policies to maintain communal tenure. However, food security could not be guaranteed, and the policies led to over dependence of small-scale farmers on government and on maize {{at the expense of other}} food crops. The introduction of neo-liberal policies (from 1991 to 2001) by the MMD government coupled with adverse weather conditions, made food production systems rather vulnerable to both policy and environmental shocks. However, efforts are being made (from 2001 - to date) with the assistance of cooperating partners or the international community, the United Nations System and Non Governmental Organisations (NGOs), to continue with land tenure empowerment policies to ensure secure land tenure for both men and women, and make targeted interventions with partial subsidies to rebuild the resilience of rural society, so as to promote national and household food security...|$|E

40|$|<b>Flood</b> <b>plain</b> mapping {{has become}} an {{increasingly}} important part of <b>flood</b> <b>plain</b> management. <b>Flood</b> <b>plain</b> mapping employs mapping software and hydraulic calculation packages to efficiently map <b>flood</b> <b>plains.</b> Modelers often utilize automation software to develop the complex geometries required to reduce the time to develop hydraulic models. The Utah Inundation Mapping System (UTIMS) is designed to reduce {{the time required to}} develop complex geometries for use in <b>flood</b> <b>plain</b> mapping studies. The automated geometries developed by UTIMS include: flood specific river centerlines, bank lines, flow path lines, cross sections and areal averaged n-value polygons. UTIMS thus facilitates developing automated input to US Army Corps of Engineer 2 ̆ 7 s HEC-RAS software. Results from HEC-RAS can be imported back to UTIMS for display and mapping. The user can also specify convergence criteria for water surface profile at selected locations along the river and thus run UTIMS and HEC-RAS iteratively till the convergence criterion is met. UTIMS develops a new flood specific geometry file for each iteration, enabling an accurate modeling of flood-plain. Utilizing this robust and easy to operate software within the GIS environment modelers can significantly reduce the time required to develop accurate <b>flood</b> <b>plain</b> maps. The time thus saved in developing the geometries allows modelers to spend more time doing the actual modeling and analyzing results. The time thus saved can also result in faster turn around and potential cost cutting in flood-plain modeling work.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{compared the}} ability of a one-dimensional computer model and a two-dimensional computer model to model water flow over a <b>flood</b> <b>plain.</b> It used observed data from 1986 and 1994 flood events on the 50 km 2 Waihao River <b>Flood</b> <b>Plain.</b> The observed data was collected by a survey of the <b>flood</b> <b>plain</b> residents. The data was generally given at buildings and other easily remembered locations and also from photographs and videos of the flood event. The photographs verified the flood levels given by the residents and provided more flood levels. The Canterbury Regional Council also provided a map of the areas flooded from these floods. Further data from the Canterbury Regional Council on river discharges, stopbank overtopping and breaching was analysed to give flows onto the <b>flood</b> <b>plain.</b> The details of the Waihao River <b>Flood</b> <b>Plain</b> topography were stored in a Digital Terrain Model in a computer package called ARC/INFO. The details of the <b>flood</b> <b>plain</b> flow resistances of the <b>flood</b> <b>plain</b> using Mannings ‘n’ values were digitised into ARC/INFO. This information was imported into the computer models using software designed for this purpose. The dissertation used the Danish Hydraulic Institute MIKE 11 computer model for the onedimensional analysis and for the two-dimensional analysis a computer program under development by C. Beffa of Switzerland. The results showed that the two-dimensional model gave results with less standard error than the one-dimensional model. A calibration to obtain the best fit to the surveyed flooded area was undertaken with the two-dimensional model showed that in this case the observed flood levels were underpredicted. The results showed that for the two-dimensional model the standard error of the differences in the calculated and surveyed flood levels was less than expected error from the digital terrain model and the flood levels. This lesser standard error also validated the collection of observed flood level data from <b>flood</b> <b>plain</b> residents. The dissertation showed that both models MIKE 11 and 2 de could give good results, with the two-dimensional results marginally better, for the flooding in areas where recent flooding had not occurred which could have been used for calibration.

40|$|Graduation date: 1973 Seven {{methods for}} {{delineating}} <b>flood</b> <b>plains</b> were evaluated. The methods are classified : (1) Geomorphic Technique; (2) Soils Technique; (3) Botanical Technique; (4) Hydrologic Technique; (5) Hydrologic- Hydraulic Technique; (6) Historical Technique; and (7) "Combination Method". All of the methods, except the Botanical Technique and the Hydrologic-Hydraulic Technique, were compared on sample <b>flood</b> <b>plain</b> reaches throughout Oregon. Chronological sequences of natural <b>flood</b> <b>plains</b> {{were identified and}} mapped based on: (1) scarps separating two or more <b>flood</b> <b>plain</b> or terrace geomorphic surfaces and (2) the abundance and degree of photographic expression of <b>flood</b> <b>plain</b> features such as meander scrolls, point bars, oxbows, oxbow lakes, sloughs, old channels, natural levees, and sand splays. Soils were useful in delineating <b>flood</b> <b>plain</b> areas since soils cannot be older than the alluvium in which they form or older than the associated geomorphic surface. Since soils exhibit increasing development of genetic horizons with increasing age, delineation of younger bottomland soils from older soils on higher <b>flood</b> <b>plains</b> or terraces, usually results in the delineation of flood prone areas. Since floods scar bark, or prune branches or the tops of trees, botanical studies can provide information about the flood date, flood stage, and area flooded. The number of annual tree rings that have grown since scarring of the bark, or the age of sprouts that have grown since flood damage occurred, are equal {{to the number of}} growing seasons since the trees were damaged. The thickness of sediment above the base of a tree serves as a measure of the rate of sediment accumulation above the surface on which the tree was located. Historically <b>flood</b> <b>plains</b> have been recognized and delineated by (1) aerial or ground photographs taken during floods; (2) high flood marks such as float debris; and (3) locating flooded areas from field interviews. Previous hydrologic studies have related the stage of rivers at gage locations to the adjacent <b>flood</b> <b>plain</b> areas, and in this manner <b>flood</b> <b>plains</b> have been recognized and delineated. In addition, hydraulic studies have been used to determine flood stages at valley cross sections, for specific <b>flood</b> frequencies. <b>Flood</b> <b>plain</b> width therefore may be determined from the valley cross sections. Use of both the gaging stations and the valley cross sections results in a hydrologic-hydraulic procedure for <b>flood</b> <b>plain</b> identification. The particular <b>flood</b> <b>plain</b> mapping technique that is most applicable in any given study depends on the data available, the purpose and scale of mapping, and the field conditions. Each technique has deficiencies; therefore, the "Combination Method" is introduced to utilize the most useful information from each technique. Collective use of two or more techniques is called the "Combination Method". The relative accuracy of the Geomorphic Technique, Soils Technique, Historical Technique, Hydrologic Technique, and "Combination Method" was determined for some representative stream reaches in Oregon. Areas flooded in a 100 year average recurrence interval event were compared for all methods available in 10 study areas, which ranged from semiarid to humid environments. For the areas compared the "Combination Method" was used as the base method. The Geomorphic Technique was the method most consistently comparable with the "Combination Method". The Soils Technique was generally accurate for delimiting <b>flood</b> <b>plains,</b> with some studies showing excellent correlation. The three study areas with comparisons using the Historic Technique were generally good and most discrepancies occurred where approximate historical flood lines were drawn for inaccessible areas. The Hydrologic Technique showed by fax the poorest correlation with the "Combination Method" as well as with all other methods. The differences between the "Combination Method" and the Hydrologic Technique are explained for specific maps, but in general the major problem was the lack of field correlation of crest staff gage flood elevations, with the general <b>flood</b> <b>plain</b> area away from the river. No independent evaluations were made of the Hydraulic Technique, although the Hydrologic-Hydraulic Technique was included as part of the "Combination Method" in one study...|$|R
