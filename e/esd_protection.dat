40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the environmental, {{economic and social}} aspects of ecosystem services (ES) and their interactions with the polluter-pays principle and the provider-gets principle. The paper ends with observations concerning the theoretical and practical relationship of those principles with ES and Payment for Ecosystem Services (PES) programs. ES have attracted increasing interest through PES as a mechanism which translates external, non-market values of the environment into real financial incentives for local actors to provide ES. The PES approach has inspired new incentives, innovative financing for ecosystem protection. The PES seeks to internalize what would otherwise be an externality. Here, we will observe two principles whose characteristics could relate to those of ES. As a principle which makes the responsible of a polluting activity bearing the cost of pollution, the polluter-pays principle has internalizing, redistributive, preventive and curative functions that combine economic, social and environmental objectives. This makes this principle an available tool for directing sustainable activities. However, sustainable activities {{could also result in}} increased environmental quality. In relation to that, the provider-gets principle has been formulated. This principle aims to reward the provider of sustainable activities and needs the description of a desired environmental quality to determinate how much ES are delivered and how they would be compensated. Both principles promote <b>ES</b> <b>protection</b> by means of taxes on pollution or the provision of ES. The provider-gets principle is closer than the polluter- pays principle to ecosystem protection. The polluter-pays principle could be important as an incentive to minimize ecosystem damage through a constraint pollution cost. The polluter-pays principle seeks the right price of an environmental resource through the internalization of the pollution cost of a resource into its price. The interaction of this principle with the ES valuation would depend on the certainty of the internalization of the environmental resource service price into the price of the resource where this service comes from. The counterbalance of ES delivered to rewarded credits inherent to the provider-gets principle confirms its relationship with the ES valuation. There are still uncertainties regarding the rewarded fee as this depends on issues such as consent of parties and the applied law in a PES contract. The social aim of the polluter-pays principle consists of the redistribution of the internalized externality in the community. The internalized pollution costs are, in principle, equally disseminated through public actions for the common interest. The provider-gets principle distributes fees from the ES user to the ES provider and purely environmental benefits to the community depended of ES. We could observe that those two principles could theoretically interact with ES. The provider-gets principle works in practice as PES programs. The polluter-pays principle could complete, PES programs where they are not applied, as an incentive against ecosystem damage and thus, could reduce leakage. Both principles could complementary function with /in PES programs...|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION. N-acetyltransferase 2 is a {{polymorphic}} enzyme in humans. Women {{who possess}} homozygous polymorphic alleles have a slower rate of metabolic activation of aryl aromatic amines, {{one of the}} constituents of tobacco smoke that {{has been identified as}} carcinogenic. We hypothesized that women with breast cancer who were slow acetylators would be at increased risk of breast cancer associated with active and passive exposure to tobacco smoke. METHODS. We used a case-only study design to evaluate departure from multiplicativity between acetylation status and smoking status. We extracted DNA from buccal cell samples collected from 502 women with incident primary breast cancer and assigned acetylation status by genotyping ten single-nucleotide polymorphisms. Information on tobacco use and breast cancer risk factors was obtained by structured interviews. RESULTS. We observed no substantial departure from multiplicativity between acetylation status and history of ever having been an active smoking (adjusted odds ratio estimate of departure from multiplicativity = 0. 9, 95 % confidence interval 0. 5 to 1. 7) or ever having had passive residential exposure to tobacco smoke (adjusted odds ratio = 0. 7, 95 % confidence interval 0. 4 to 1. 5). The estimates for departure from multiplicativity between acetylation status and various measures of intensity, duration, and timing of active and passive tobacco exposure lacked consistency and were generally not supportive of the idea of a gene–environment interaction. CONCLUSION. In this, the largest case-only study to evaluate the interaction between acetylation status and active or passive exposure to tobacco smoke, we found little evidence to support the idea of a departure from multiplicativity.

The main aimof {{this paper is}} {{to assess the impact of}} forest cover on water related ES in Wallonia (Belgium) in termsof quantity and timing. We developed an approach based on easily accessible data, monitored in severalcountries and using straightforward statistical methods. This led us to study ES at “real-life” catchmentsscale: 22 catchments – from 30 to 250 km 2 – with mixed land covers were studied. We approached thewater supply and flood protection services through 5 indicators extracted from 10 hydrological years(2005 – 2014) discharge data series. These were computed annually and seasonally (vegetation periodfrom March to September and “non-vegetation” period the rest of the year). The water supply wasassessed through the specific volume Vs, the baseflow index BFI and the specific discharge exceeded 95 % of the time Q 95 s whereas the flood protection service was approached through the specific dis-charge exceeded 5 % of the time Q 05 s and the flashiness index FI. Our study gives two main insights. First,statistical analyses show that forest cover negatively impact water supply when studying annual and“non-vegetation” period flows in general (Vs) but positively when studying low flows (Q 95 s). Regardingflood protection a slightly negative impact of forest cover on high flows (Q 05 s) was highlighted in the“non-vegetation” period. Results also show a negative impact of forests annually and in the vegetationperiod on the flashy behaviour of the catchment thus a positive impact on the flood <b>protection</b> <b>ES.</b> The“year” effect is overall highly significant testifying the importance of climatic factors. Rainfall is oftensignificant and can be considered as a main driver of these ES.

A first step towards developing a targeted therapy for FSHD is to discover chemical compounds that inhibit the activity of the DUX 4 protein. We have taken advantage of the conditional toxicity of DUX 4 -inducible myoblasts to develop a small molecule screening platform for identifying inhibitors of DUX 4. The assay was based on rapid toxicity of high level DUX 4 expression which leads to myoblast death within 24 hours. High throughput screening (HTS) of more than 200. 000 small molecules as a part of UT Southwestern HTS compound library was done identified approximately 700 compounds with significant rescue effect.

Moreover, in radar ES applications, new information from a battlefield or other sources often becomes available at different points in time. In order to rapidly refiect changes in operational environments, fast incremental learning of SCFG probabilities is therefore an undisputed asset. Several techniques have been developed to accelerate the computation of production rules probabilities of SCFGs. In {{the first part of this}} thesis, three fast alternatives, called graphical EM (gEM), Tree Scanning (TS) and HOLA, are compared from several perspectives - perplexity, state estimation, ability to detect MFRs, time and memory complexity, and convergence time. Estimation of the average-case and worst-case execution time and storage requirements allows for the assessment of complexity, while computer simulations, performed using radar pulse data, facilitates the assessment of the other performance measures. An experimental protocol has been defined such that the impact on performance of factors like training set size and level of ambiguity of grammars may be observed. In addition, since VS is known to have a lower overall computational cost in practice, VS versions of the original 10 -based gEM and TS have also been proposed and compared. Results indicate that both gEM(IO) and TS(IO) provide the same level of accuracy, yet the resource requirements mostly vary as a function of the ambiguity of the grammars. Furthermore, for a similar quality in results, the gEM(VS) and TS(VS) techniques provide significantly lower convergence times and time complexities per iteration in practice than do gEM(IO) and TS(IO). All of these algorithms may provide a greater level of accuracy than HOLA, yet their computational complexity may be orders of magnitude higher. Finally, HOLA is an on-line technique that naturally allows for incremental learning of production rule probabilities. In the second part of this thesis, two new incremental versions of gEM, called Incremental gEM (igEM) and On-Line Incremental gEM (oigEM), are proposed and compared to HOLA. They allow for a SCFG to efficiently learn new training sequences incrementally, without retraining from the start an all training data. An experimental protocol has been defined such that the impact on performance of factors like the size of new data blocks for incremental learning, and the level of ambiguity of MFR grammars, may be observed. Results indicate that, unlike HOLA, incremental learning of training data blocks with igEM and oigEM provides the same level of accuracy as learning from all cumulative data from scratch, even for relatively small data blocks. As expected, incremental leaming significantly reduces the overall time and memory complexities associated with updating SCFG probabilities. Finally, it appears that while the computational complexity and memory requirements of igEM and oigEM may be greater than that of HOLA, they both provide the higher level of accuracy...|$|R
40|$|Economic {{approaches}} through {{ecosystem services}} (ES) valuation are increasingly recommended by conservation organisations to face main market externalities affecting biodiversity {{in general and}} coral reef ecosystems. In this dissertation, we will analyse the experience of two economic valuations of coral reef ecosystems in the Pacific focusing on two aspects. The first is to evaluate if current methods of Coral Reef Ecosystem Services Valuation (CRESV) permits to transmit a correct signal about ES {{and the second is}} to assess the impacts of results on policy-making and market externalities. The first study is the economic valuation of the coral reef ecosystems of New Caledonia. Financed by French Ministries of Environment and Oversea Territories, the main objective was to make visible the value of this ecosystem in the economy of the territory. The second one is a cost-benefit analysis of Marine Protected Areas in Vanuatu. Required by the French Development Bank, the aim was to realize an ex-post valuation of the impacts of marine biodiversity conservation on the economic development of the implicated villages and other stakeholders. More precisely, MPA impacts on the ES were quantified, total costs linked to each MPA were calculated and the C-B (Cost-Benefit) ratio and RoI (Return-on-Investment) were computed. More than 10 ecosystem services have been analysed with methods mainly based on financial values through producer surplus and avoided damage costs. Applied methods are classic ones with some improvements and originality {{such as the use of}} protein content equivalent for subsistence fishery, the larval stomach content to quantify links between reef ecosystem and pelagic fisheries, the application of the Advertising Image Analysis to tune the role of CR in the tourism motivation, the setup of experimental fishery to determine precise improvements in fishery productivity and the adaptation of a bio-physical model for coastal <b>protection</b> <b>ES.</b> Results in New Caledonia have permitted to make visible a contribution comprised between 195 and 330 M!. y- 1 highlighting the importance of the coastal protection, the noncommercial fishery and the underwater tourism. In Vanuatu, for donors and local policymakers, we demonstrated that, after at least 6 years of MPA implementation, all RoI except one were above 0, implying that financial benefits exceed costs. Based on a 25 -year project life, the average expected C-B ratios was 4. 1. We estimate the mean aggregate economic value of MPA impacts to be approximately US 44, 000 per year per km 2. Tourism ES were the largest estimated effect for all MPAs, despite stark differences in tourism development across sites. Impacts on tourism were followed by impacts on fish productivity. CRESV in the South Pacific context are complex exercises, which face a series of specific challenges to transmit a "right" signal about their importance. Some solutions have been proposed and discussed. The results of the 2 reports have mostly been used for "informative" purposes by public organisations and support in an ex-ante decision has been scarce. Different reasons are advanced to explain this lower than expected impact such as the lack of precise definition of the decision making question and the absence of a clear strategy of communication to different audiences. The next step to improve the application of information produced by CRESVs is to directly inform public decisions, play a role in designing instruments such as PES, and be utilised in local development planning. In parallel, the financial approach of ESV can bring concrete information about potential returns for private sources of financing for conservation. Funds such as impact investment may be attracted by the MPA¿s financial ratios as the business case for Vanuatu was convincingly made. Postprint (published version...|$|R

In addition, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) launched its five year strategy ???Delivering the Essentials of Life??? that addressed its vision of sustainable rural communities within the UK being economically and environmentally viable, and socially inclusive. The ???Rural Development Programme for England 2007 - 2013 ??? that was under consultation between April and July 2007 aims to help farmers manage land in a more sustainable way including {{a reduction in the}} impact on climate change. It will increase the funding available for Environmental Stewardship (ES). This project, with its focus on the potential for greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation by ES within England, supports the UK Sustainable Development Strategy and a Defra Strategic Priority 'Climate change and energy', with reduced GHG emissions one strategic outcome. Environmental Stewardship was launched to build on the already successful Environmentally Sensitive Areas (ESA) scheme and the Countryside Stewardship Scheme (CSS). For land within an ES agreement the landowner receives a payment to compensate for any income foregone incurred (for example a reduction in or loss of crop yield or an increase in management costs) to a maximum 100 %. The current objectives of <b>ES</b> include the <b>protection</b> of soil and water, the enhancement of biodiversity and resource protection. The alterations in land use and land management that an ES agreement requires may also have implications for climate change mitigation. An increase in the global mean temperature as a result of increased retention of thermal radiation by the Earth???s atmosphere, has raised concern over global warming and uncertainty over future impacts on the climate. Climate change has been addressed globally by the Framework Convention on Climate Change (FCCC) at the Earth Summit of 1992, then by the Kyoto Treaty of 1997. The Kyoto Treaty commits industrialised nations to a reduction in GHG emissions, in particular carbon dioxide (CO 2), by 5. 2 % below their 1990 levels during the first commitment period, the Quantified Emission Limitation or Reduction Commitments (QELRC), between 2008 and 2012. The EU is required to collectively reduce GHG emissions by 8 % while the UK target is a 12. 5 % reduction. The UK GHG emissions in 2005 were 15. 3 % below 1990 levels although much of the decrease between 2004 and 2005 was due to a 4. 6 % reduction in emissions from the domestic sector. The UK has a target to reduce its emissions by 20 % by 2010 and 60 % by 2050. Carbon dioxide is one of six main GHGs known to act as a barrier to thermal radiation 6. Others include nitrous oxide (N 2 O), methane (CH 4) Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs) and sulphur hexafluoride (SF 6). Each of the GHGs listed has a different potential to cause global warming but may be standardised on a single scale as eq t CO 2 e, its global warming potential (GWP). Within agricultural systems, the main sources of GHG emissions are from: 1. CO 2 released from burning fossil fuel (7. 102 MT CO 2 e from UK agriculture in 20055 (13. 5 % of UK agricultural emissions) either during (a) product manufacture (of pesticides and fertilisers), their packaging and transport (to farm); (b) application by spraying or spreading or fuel consumed by tillage operations and drilling; (c) indirect energy (fuel consumed during machinery manufacture and calculated based on depreciation per operation). Carbon dioxide is also released from high C containing organic (peat) soils (for example lowland raised bog and fen habitats) during decomposition under aerobic conditions following land drainage 5. 2. N 2 O released from soils and from livestock manures and during the manufacture of nitrate fertiliser (26. 961 MT CO 2 e from UK agriculture in 2005 (51. 2 % of UK agricultural emissions). 3. CH 4 released from ruminant animals and from livestock manures (18. 561 MT CO 2 e from UK agriculture in 20055 (35. 3 % of UK agricultural emissions). Environmental stewardship options may include a reduction in or the elimination of for example fertilisers, pesticides and cultivations which will potentially impact upon climate change through a reduction in the GHG emissions(EDP) associated with their manufacture and application. These options may also require that the land is removed from agricultural production and this risks the displacement of that production elsewhere, either on the same farm or outside of the UK. The importance of energy conservation and mitigating climate change in the UK was highlighted in the Energy white paper: our energy future - creating a low carbon economy and more recently the Energy white paper: meeting the energy challenge published in 2007. Further pressure to maximise overall energy efficiency coupled with reduced dependence upon fossil fuels has arisen in light of estimations that a peak in oil supply is imminent. In addition to the reduction in GHG emissions through alternative management strategies, {{it may be possible to}} increase the carbon (C) stored within the soil, the soil organic content (SOC) or above ground, the above ground C (AGC). The SOC and AGC may be increased by a change in land management such as conversion of cultivated land to woodland or grassland, the incorporation of organic manures or through reduced tillage. A major barrier to successful agricultural GHG mitigation has been cited as ???transaction costs??? whereby farmers will not adopt otherwise unprofitable agricultural GHG mitigation practices in the absence of policies or incentives. The payments made under ES may already overcome this barrier should positive GHG mitigation under ES be identified. This project has provided an estimate of the GHG emissions(EDP), both on and off farm, associated with land under the various ES options (and C mitigation through changes in C sequestration) to provide an overall estimate of the net positive or negative change in CO 2 e emissions. A robust, testable and cost-effective methodology to calculate the net CO 2 e emissions of a given management practice on agricultural land requires development. This research has the potential to make an important contribution to developing such a methodology. It first defines a baseline set of conditions in order to provide a reference point against which any changes in land use through management under ES may be compared and the net increase or decrease in C equivalent emissions quantified. Since the aim of the project is to identify changes in CO 2 e emissions, the quantification of stored C that does not change is not within scope. Reference has been made to the C storage potential of each habitat within ES and the importance of its continued maintenance or restoration even though the net change in emissions may be small. The overall impact on a national scale based upon the total area (ha) of uptake of each option within England as supplied by Natural England has then been quantified. The project does not aim to quantify the differences in the changes in C flow at a regional level based upon soil type, annual rainfall and through exact vegetation classification. Mean values have been used in many cases but they do allow comparisons between management scenarios and identify the main mechanisms of change associated with the management of each ES option...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Electrostatic {{discharge}} (<b>ESD)</b> <b>protection</b> {{has been}} a very important reliability issue in microelectronics, especially for integrated circuits (ICs). <b>ESD</b> <b>protection</b> design for giga-Hz high-speed input/output (I/O) circuits {{has been one of the}} key challenges to implement high-speed interface circuits in CMOS technology. Conventional on-chip <b>ESD</b> <b>protection</b> circuits at the I/O pads often cause unacceptable performance degradation to high-speed I/O circuits. Therefore, <b>ESD</b> <b>protection</b> circuits must be designed with minimum negative impact to the high-speed interface circuits and to sustain high enough ESD robustness. In this paper, <b>ESD</b> <b>protection</b> design considerations for high-speed I/O circuits are addressed, and the patents related to on-chip <b>ESD</b> <b>protection</b> designs for high-speed I/O circuits are presented and discussed...|$|E

40|$|For signal {{integrity}} reasons, {{the magnitude of}} the parasitics generated by electrostatic discharge (<b>ESD)</b> <b>protection</b> devices has become budgeted. Such budgets restrict the protection level and implementation options of the <b>ESD</b> <b>protection</b> circuit designer. In this work, the <b>ESD</b> <b>protection</b> on high-speed serial I/O link performance is investigated. Simulations are used to determine the effect of the parasitic ESD capacitance on the equalization required to maintain a specific bit error rate (BER). Then, the simulation results are converted into power estimates to demonstrate the power versus reliability trade-off. Essentially, rather than approaching the effect of <b>ESD</b> <b>protection</b> circuits as harmful, this work approaches the effect of <b>ESD</b> <b>protection</b> circuits as an engineering optimization problem which requires co-design between the printed circuit board (PCB) designer, transmitter and receiver circuit designer, and <b>ESD</b> <b>protection</b> circuit designer...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — The {{resulting}} capacitive load, {{from the}} large electrostatic discharge (<b>ESD)</b> <b>protection</b> device for high ESD robustness, has an adverse effect {{on the performance of}} broadband RF circuits due to the impedance mismatch and bandwidth degradation. The conventional distributed <b>ESD</b> <b>protection</b> scheme using equal four-stage <b>ESD</b> <b>protection</b> can achieve a better impedance match, but degrade the ESD performance. A new distributed <b>ESD</b> <b>protection</b> structure is proposed in this work to achieve both good ESD robustness and RF performance. The proposed <b>ESD</b> <b>protection</b> circuit is constructed by arranging <b>ESD</b> <b>protection</b> stages with decreasing device size, named decreasing-size distributed ESD (DS-DESD) protection scheme, which is beneficial to the ESD level.

By adding a VDD ESD bus {{line and the}} diodes into the <b>ESD</b> <b>protection</b> scheme, the leakage current from the I/O pin to VDD power line can be blocked to avoid malfunction under the power-down-mode operating condition. Under normal circuit operating condition, the proposed <b>ESD</b> <b>protection</b> schemes have no leakage path {{to interfere with the}} normal circuit functions. Power-rail ESD clamp circuit s between VDD ESD bus and VSS power line, or between VDD power line and VSS power line, are used to achieve the whole-chip <b>ESD</b> <b>protection</b> design.
