40|$|This study {{investigated}} eyewitnesses’ memory and confidence accuracy <b>for</b> <b>action</b> information (what {{happened at the}} crime scene), and detail information (descriptions of persons, objects, time and place). In Experiment 1, 89 participants watched a film and participated in one of four conditions: Laboratory discussion, Family discussion, Retell and Control, the first three with five meetings each. Three weeks later all participants open free recalled the events, and confidence judged their answers. The participants showed better free recall and confidence accuracy <b>for</b> <b>action</b> than <b>for</b> detail information. Participants in the two discussion conditions and in the Retell condition recalled more items {{and those in the}} Lab-discussion and Retell conditions more correct items <b>for</b> <b>action</b> information, than those in Control group.

In brief, Experiment 1 showed that witness discussions and retellings of the experienced event with others improved recall <b>for</b> <b>action</b> information but had had no, or small, effects on confidence accuracy. Experiment 2 investigated recall and confidence accuracy performance <b>for</b> <b>action</b> and detail information using focused questions. Seventy-seven participants watched a film, answered and confidence judged 63 questions about action and detail information about the events. Again, participants showed better memory and confidence accuracy <b>for</b> <b>action</b> information.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to, based on {{qualitative}} interviews with managers and group interviews with care providers, understand their interpretation of integrity and also their scope <b>for</b> <b>action</b> to satisfy disable people’s integrity at sheltered housing for adults. The questions of this study are: How do the managers and the care providers interpret the concept of integrity? Which scope <b>for</b> <b>action</b> do they have to satisfy the integrity of disabled people? Method: Individual – and group interviews have been used as methods to gather empirical data. Theory: The theories of scope <b>for</b> <b>action</b> and integrity as a theoretical conception have been used to analyze the empirical material. Results: The informants of this study found it difficult to give a specific definition of integrity. The main aspects we could distinguish were that integrity was interpreted as a personal sphere and self-determination. The result of this study shows that the scope <b>for</b> <b>action</b> to satisfy the integrity of disabled people is affected by many factors. First of all the scope <b>for</b> <b>action</b> is affected by the Swedish law LSS and the assignment within the organization. The scope <b>for</b> <b>action</b> is also affected by individual adaption for each person. This study shows the importance of the relationship between the managers, care providers and the persons.
