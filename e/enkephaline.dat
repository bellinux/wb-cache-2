40|$|On {{the pattern}} of the potent and {{selective}} butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) inhibitors ethopropazine and Astra 1397, sets of quinolizidinyl derivatives of bi- and tricyclic (hetero) aromatic systems were studied as dual, or BChE-selective inhibitors. All compounds exhibited activity against both cholinesterases, but inhibition of BChE was generally stronger, with submicromolar IC 50 values for most of them (e. g. 15 : IC 50 versus BChE = 0. 15 mM; SI = 47). However, in a subset of quinolizidinyl derivatives of 6 -hydroxycoumarin an inverted selectivity for acetylcholinesterase (AChE) was observed (e. g. 46 : IC 50 versus AChE = 0. 35 mM; SI = 0. 06). Docking studies furnished a sound interpretation of the observed different enzyme activity. Several of the studied compounds have shown, in the past, additional pharmacological properties (as antagonism on presynaptic muscarinic autoreceptor; inhibition of <b>enkephaline</b> aminopeptidase and antipsychotic activity) of some relevance in Alzheimer’s disease, and may, therefore, represent hits for the development of interesting single-entity multi-target drugs...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of the opioid peptides on the mechanism of regulation of the kidneys functions and water-salt exchange of the rats of three age groups on {{the background of the}} 5 %-water load was being studied. The physico-chemical indicators of blood, tissue water-salt depout, kidneys functions, the concentrations of ADG and aldosteron after the injection of the synthetic analog of Leu-enkephalint (SAE). For the first time it has been shown, that Leu-enkephaline inserts the modulating action on support of the hydroion balance of the rats with the disturbing effects. In the juvenile age, the high reactivity of hydro- and ionouretic function of kidneys in response to the water load has been revealed. The action of SAE is mediated through the tissue opiate receptors, and by activation GGNS (in particular, by increasing secretion of ADG and aldosteron). The results of the work can be used for the correction of possible deviations with the disturbance of the water-salt balance, give the representation about the formation of the <b>enkephaline</b> system in the mammals' ontogenesis.

40|$|Human mesenchymal {{stem cells}} (hMSCs) {{although}} being potent in repairing injured or ischemic tissues, their success regarding tissue-regenerative approaches are hindered by the paucity in their viability. The {{elevated levels of}} reactive oxygen species (ROS) in damaged sites provoke the pernicious effects of donor MSC survival. In the present study, the effect of delta-opioid receptor (DOR) activation on human umbilical cord-blood borne fibroblasts (hUCB-BFs) survival under oxidative stress (H 2 O 2) was evaluated. Oxidative stress which is known to trigger pathological conditions of the unfolded protein response (UPR) leads to endoplasmic reticulum stress. Upon its activation by D-Alanine 2, Leucine 5 <b>Enkephaline</b> (DADLE, selective DOR agonist) in hUCB-BFs under oxidative stress, a significant down regulation (~ 2 folds) of key UPR genes was observed as determined by qPCR, Thioflavin-T protein aggregation assay and western blot analysis. Concomitantly, the oxidative stress-mediated cell-death was ameliorated and the viable-cells' percentage was enhanced following DOR activation. The intracellular ROS production upon H 2 O 2 treatment as determined by CM-H 2 DCFDA staining was repressed, the anti-apoptotic marker Bcl- 2 was upregulated along with a significant suppression in the expression levels of pro-apoptotic proteins Bax and Bad upon DOR activation. Upon subsequent treatment with naltrindole, the effects of DADLE-induced cytoprotection were reverted significantly. These results propound the role of DADLE-mediated DOR-activation on improvement of the viability, which might succour successful hUCB-BFs transplants and greatly absolve the inefficacy of tissue-specific engineered transplants...|$|E
40|$|Electroacupuncture {{analgesia}} is a {{well established}} phenomenon [42, 43, 44]. In general, the lower the pulse repetition rate of electrical stimulation, the lower {{the time required to}} reach maximum analgesic effect and the longer the effect remains. The higher the pulse repetition rate, the shorter the time required to optain maximum pain threshold, and the effects remain for a shorter time (table 2 and 3). Also, periaqueductal central gray (PAG) stimulation produced analgesia is similar to acupuncture analgesia in many respects. According to other studies Xie-Guo-Xi, Han-Ji Sheng (1985) the high frequency of stimulation of the points of acupuncture has above all metameric local action while, on the contrary, low frequency (1 - 15 HZ) generalized analgesic action. In cases of dissection of the spinal cord all frequencies are inadequate. Electroacupuncture to a frequency of 2 HZ provokes analgesia mainly through methionine- <b>enkephaline,</b> with 100 HZ mainly through A dynorphine while with 15 HZ both neurotransmitting sybstances are detected in almost equal quantities. There is more recent work (especially on high frequency current) in which it is held that the stimulation at a frequency in excess of 10 Hz increases enzymatic degradation of circulating opiate substances reducing the analgesic effect. [45] Also, new electrotherapy techniques (MENS- microcurrent electrical neuromuscular stimulation) and electroacupuncture with current intensities in the order of 400 ìÁ at 10 - 60 Volts (low voltage pulsed microamp stimulation) and extremely long pulse duration with total current equal to 5 x 10 - 6 coulombs/sec, are awaiting the results of the clinical tests to which they are subjected [46, 47]. This technique is based to Arudt-Schulz law that microamperage (ìA) currents are better at enhancing cellular physiology processes than are currents of higher amplitude. Severa...|$|E
40|$|AbstractUsing {{vitellogenin}} (Vtg) gene as a biomarker, {{the possible}} role of selected endocrine modulators (EMs) such as methyl farnesoate (MF), 17 α-hydroxy progesterone (17 α-OHP), biochanin-A, methionine <b>enkephaline</b> (ME) and arachidonic acid on female reproduction in crab Oziothelphusa senex senex (O. senex senex) was elucidated in this study. The injections were given on 1 st and 7 th day of experiment (10 − 8 moles/crab) of each EMs to its respective groups and corresponding concurrent controls (CC) received solvents of EMs and sacrificed on 14 th day of experiment. Found hepatopancreatic Vtg expression in MF and 17 α-OHP injected crabs with significant (p< 0. 05) increase in ovarian index (OI), oocyte diameter (OD) and ovarian Vtg levels {{and this was}} supported by RT-PCR results. Densitometry result of RT-PCR says that the hepatopancreatic Vtg expression is high in MF (74. 51 ng) injected group than 17 α-OHP (48. 62 ng) injected group. Due to this, further group of females were injected with 10 − 8 moles/crab of MF in an alternative day along with the groups of eyestalk ablated (ESX) and CC for 28 days. Significant reduction in length of reproductive cycle (13 ± 2 days) by MF injections than ESX and CC, along with significant (p< 0. 05) increase in OI, OD and ovarian Vtg levels were observed. In in vitro, the isolated hepatopancreas fragments were incubated in M 199 medium with and without MF (at 10 − 8 moles/well) at 25 ± 1 °C in CO 2 incubator. Vtg expression in hepatopancreas was found at 3 rd and 6 th hour of incubation in vitro and observed high density bands at 3 rdh (67. 21 ng) than 6 th hour (56. 90 ng) in RT-PCR. This is the first report stating the direct effect of MF on hepatopancreatic Vtg gene expression in crab O. senex senex. The results clearly suggest that MF and 17 α-OHP have stimulatory effect on vitellogenesis and MF has direct effect on crab O. senex senex hepatopancreatic Vtg expression...|$|E
40|$|The {{striatum}} is {{the main}} input structure of the basal ganglia, a group of subcortical nuclei that {{are central to the}} control of different patterns of motor behaviours and for the selection of actions, a fundamental problem facing all animals. The main focus of this thesis has been to characterize the cellular and synaptic mechanisms of the striatum and its relation to other basal ganglia nuclei in the lamprey. To understand how the basal ganglia input structure, the striatum, processes motor related information we first needed to understand the basic architecture of the striatal microcircuitry. Individual neurons were characterized based on their electrophysiological properties and we showed that there are two main types of striatal neurons: inwardly rectifying neurons (IRNs) that are distinguished by a prominent rectification due to a Kir type K+ conductance, and non-IRNs. IRNs are in this and other respects very similar to the mammalian medium spiny projection neurons (MSNs). IRNs are projection neurons of two types, those that express substance P, dopamine receptors of D 1 type and GABA, or <b>enkephaline</b> and D 2 receptors and GABA. Non- IRNs are a mixed group of neurons and contain neurons similar to the fast-spiking type found in mammals. We then investigated how the striatum is activated by the main excitatory inputs from the lateral pallium (the homolog of the cortex) and from thalamus. As recently demonstrated in mammals, the pallium and thalamus in lamprey provide synaptic inputs with very different dynamic properties to the striatum, as evoked by extracellular stimulation of the respective pathway. Repetitive activation of the synapses from the lateral pallium result in a progressive facilitation over several hundred milliseconds due to a low presynaptic release probability. In contrast, activation of thalamic afferents instead evokes strongly depressing synapses throughout a stimulus train due to a high presynaptic release probability. The conserved difference between the thalamic and pallial inputs most likely has functional implications for processing within striatum. The lamprey striatum receives prominent dopaminergic innervation that, when depleted, leads to hypokinetic symptoms. As dopamine is thought to bias the striatal networks towards selecting actions by differentially modulating the excitability of D 1 and D 2 receptor expressing striatal projection neurons, we investigated this in lamprey. We cloned the lamprey D 2 receptor and demonstrated that it was expressed in striatum. We showed that the neurons that project directly to the basal ganglia output nuclei (the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) and the globus pallidus interna (GPi)) express dopamine D 1 receptors, while separate populations that project to the mixed GPi/GPe nucleus express either dopamine D 1 or D 2 receptors. As in mammals, activation of D 1 receptors furthermore leads to an increase in the excitability, whereas D 2 activation decreases the excitability of IRNs. Lastly, we identified the SNr and pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN) in lamprey and showed that the SNr provides tonic inhibition to downstream motor centers while the cholinergic neurons of the PPN modulates basal ganglia nuclei. In summary, the organization of striatum and the properties of the synaptic input, cellular properties and molecular markers are conserved throughout vertebrate evolution...|$|E
