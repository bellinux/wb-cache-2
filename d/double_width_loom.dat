50|$|Since 1993 Roger Oates {{has sold}} Venetian flatweave, {{designed}} and woven in the United Kingdom on specially adapted narrow <b>width</b> <b>looms</b> for floor runners. The heavy woven fabric is fitted onto staircases by trained fitters, {{and can be}} fitted around corners and on winding stairs. The warp is always striped, and so the company produces a variety of stripe designs. A line of tartan fabrics has also been created.|$|R

5000|$|Custom. Custom face-frame {{cabinets}} {{offer more}} {{efficient use of}} space because <b>double</b> <b>width</b> stiles (see above) can be avoided. They also provide far greater flexibility with regard to materials and design. Every aspect of custom cabinetry {{can be made to}} specifications, which makes it both the most desirable and the most expensive choice in the majority of kitchen installations.|$|R

Also, the ground state properties of all the nuclei are also described well. In the low mass region, the obtained nuclei are less bound but stable.

50|$|The Arway was a single-decker {{coach for}} {{suburban}} routes. The bus {{was designed to}} replace the MyWay (original Iveco model) and the Ares (original Renault model), whence came the name Arway. The Arway was equipped with a {{heating and air conditioning}} (HVAC) system, music and announcement system and also, optionallyk, a wheelchair lift. It has two doors, with the central one available in single or <b>double</b> <b>width.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Originally the Jacquard {{machines}} were mechanical, and the fabric design was {{stored in a}} series of punched cards which were joined to form a continuous chain. The Jacquards often were small and only independently controlled a relatively few warp ends. This required a number of repeats across the <b>loom</b> <b>width.</b> Larger capacity machines, or the use of multiple machines, allowed greater control, with fewer repeats, and hence larger designs could be woven across the <b>loom</b> <b>width.</b>|$|R
50|$|To use AMCs in ATCA-systmes {{a special}} carrier card known as hybrid or cutaway carrier is {{required}} to hold one Full-size Module or two Compact-size (see connectors below). Each height is paired with a <b>width,</b> single or <b>double,</b> describing how many carrier slots the board fills. A <b>double</b> <b>width</b> card allows more component space, but does not provide any additional power or bandwidth because it only uses a single connector.|$|R

25|$|The {{gauge of}} the new iron railway line {{was the same as}} the wooden railway and it was 4.6 miles in length, falling {{continuously}} from Lady Anne pit 440 feet above the track on the pier at St David's. The rails were 28lbs per yard fish-bellied, procured from the Bedlington Iron Company. They were held in 9lb iron chairs secure to whinstone block sleepers by two iron pegs. The joint sleeper blocks were <b>double</b> <b>width</b> and there were no fishplates.|$|R

All of these except those that affected font size and spacing were displayed on the screen. Reverse video was an on-screen reminder to the user and was never printed, while the other effects were printed, except on daisy wheel printers.|$|R

40|$|Substrate {{mediated}} ordering and intermolecular {{interactions are}} {{used to create a}} long-range supramolecular network of perylenetetracarboxylic diimide and melamine on a reconstructed Au (111) - (22 Ã— 3) surface. Scanning tunneling microscopy reveals that the network is composed of a succession of <b>double</b> <b>width</b> honeycomb cell rows separated by a more closely packed row of parallelograms. This periodicity of the supramolecular configuration matches that of the reconstructed gold substrate allowing an epitaxial relationship between network and substrate reconstruction.
