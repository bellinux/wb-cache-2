5|$|The {{species was}} first {{described}} by American mycologists Alexander H. Smith and Harry D. Thiers in their 1978 monograph on the boletes of Michigan.

5|$|Action Film and JIF {{continued}} producing films {{until the}} beginning of the Japanese occupation of the Indies began in early 1942, leading to the closing of all but one film studio. The cast of Srigala Item remained with JIF until the company closed, as did Tan. According to JB Kristanto's Katalog Film Indonesia (Catalogue of Indonesian Films), a copy of Srigala Item <b>is</b> <b>stored</b> at Sinematek Indonesia in Jakarta. The reels have been damaged by acid, leading to part of the film being excised.|$|E
5|$|After mating sperm <b>is</b> <b>stored</b> in the spermathecae, {{organs of}} the female {{reproductive}} tract, {{and can be used}} up to two years later to fertilise several clutches of eggs. Each clutch averages 250 eggs and is housed in a round white silken egg sac. The redback spider has a widespread distribution in Australia, and inadvertent introductions have led to established colonies in including New Zealand, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, Japan and in greenhouses in Belgium.|$|E
5|$|Although {{ytterbium}} {{is fairly}} stable chemically, it <b>is</b> <b>stored</b> {{in airtight containers}} and in an inert atmosphere such as a nitrogen-filled dry box {{to protect it from}} air and moisture. All compounds of ytterbium are treated as highly toxic, although studies appear to indicate that the danger is minimal. However, ytterbium compounds cause irritation to human skin and eyes, and some might be teratogenic. Metallic ytterbium dust can spontaneously combust, and the resulting fumes are hazardous. Ytterbium fires cannot be extinguished using water, and only dry chemical class D fire extinguishers can extinguish the fires.|$|E

5|$|Andjar {{directed}} two further {{films for}} South Pacific, Anggrek Bulan and Gadis Desa (Maiden from the Village; 1949). Ratna had no further acting roles, although in 1950 she became Indonesia's first female director with Sedap Malam (Sweetness of the Night), for Djamaluddin Malik's company Persari. Ali, Iskandar, and Djauhari remained active as actors, Ali and Iskandar through the 1960s and Djauhari until the 1970s. SPFC made another six films before shutting {{down at the}} end of the Indonesian National Revolution in 1949. A 35mm copy of Djaoeh Dimata <b>is</b> <b>stored</b> at Sinematek Indonesia in Jakarta.|$|E
5|$|As with {{previous}} Halo titles, 343 Industries provides a statistic tracking service for players of Halo 4. Player data such as game history, character progression, and various statistics {{can be accessed}} in game or via the Halo Waypoint website. The web services team at 343 Industries utilized the Windows Azure Service Bus messaging infrastructure to relay data from the Xbox Live network to back-end databases, where player data and information <b>is</b> <b>stored.</b> Halo 4 player data can also be accessed via the Xbox SmartGlass application.|$|E
5|$|Boletus edulis {{is known}} to be able to {{tolerate}} and even thrive on soil that is contaminated with toxic heavy metals, such as soil that might be found near metal smelters. The mushroom's resistance to heavy-metal toxicity is conferred by a biochemical called a phytochelatin—an oligopeptide whose production is induced after exposure to metal. Phytochelatins are chelating agents, capable of forming multiple bonds with the metal; in this state, the metal cannot normally react with other elements or ions and <b>is</b> <b>stored</b> in a detoxified form in the mushroom tissue.|$|E

50|$|It is {{important}} that only compatible chemicals <b>are</b> <b>stored</b> within these cabinets. Breakable containers, especially liquids <b>are</b> <b>stored</b> beneath solids to prevent leakage. No more than 250 liters of flammable liquid can <b>be</b> <b>stored</b> in the chemical cabinets and they must never <b>be</b> <b>stored</b> with oxidizing agents or any other incompatible solvents. Chemical storage units should be a restricted area, with entry limited only to trained, authorized personnel {{in order to reduce}} the risk of accident. Lastly, the location of these storages should be far away from ignition sources and must not block exit doorways.|$|R
25|$|Hydrogen storage {{technologies}} can {{be divided}} into physical storage, where hydrogen molecules <b>are</b> <b>stored</b> (including pure hydrogen storage via compression and liquefaction), and chemical storage, where hydrides <b>are</b> <b>stored.</b>|$|R
5|$|End of Ages {{has several}} {{features}} {{designed to help}} players complete puzzles. To recall clues or important items, players can use a camera feature to take screenshots, which are then placed in a journal the player can access at any time. Player interactions with other characters are similarly recalled via another journal; everything a character tells the player <b>is</b> <b>stored</b> and can be viewed at any time. Journal pages are narrated by {{the voice of the}} character, and missing pages of the journal appear translucent in menus.|$|E
5|$|Filler metals {{are also}} used in nearly all {{applications}} of GTAW, the major exception being the welding of thin materials. Filler metals are available with different diameters and are made {{of a variety of}} materials. In most cases, the filler metal {{in the form of a}} rod is added to the weld pool manually, but some applications call for an automatically fed filler metal, which often <b>is</b> <b>stored</b> on spools or coils.|$|E
5|$|In fertilised queens, {{the ovaries}} only become active when the queen starts to lay. An egg passes along the oviduct to the vagina {{where there is}} a chamber called the spermatheca, in which the sperm from the mating <b>is</b> <b>stored.</b> Depending on need, she may allow her egg to be fertilised. Unfertilised eggs become haploid males; fertilised eggs grow into diploid females and queens. The hormones that stimulate the {{development}} of the ovaries are suppressed in female worker bees, while the queen remains dominant.|$|E
