30|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} aspects to understand the internal structure of a volcano is to characterise its magmatic system. Some volcanic hazards, for instance, are strongly related to the size and depth of the magma source. The presence of an active magma chamber generates strong resistivity contrasts with the <b>hosting</b> <b>units,</b> since magmas contain dissolved water in their composition that reduces its resistivity (e.g. Lebedev and Khitarov 1964; Gaillard 2004). This contrast between the magma and the <b>hosting</b> geological <b>units</b> represents an appropriate framework for the application of electromagnetic methods, such as magnetotellurics (MT) (e.g. Newman et al. 1985; Moroz et al. 1988; Park and Torres-Verdin 1988; Spichak 2001, 2012).|$|R
