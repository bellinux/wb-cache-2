50|$|Borrow pits {{containing}} suitable material {{are accessible}} at an elevation {{such that the}} earth can be sluiced to the fill after being washed from the bank by high-pressure nozzles. Hydraulic fill {{is likely to be}} the most economic method of construction. Even when the source material lacks sufficient elevation, it can be elevated to the sluice by a dredge pump. In the construction of a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>fill</b> <b>dam,</b> the edges of the dam are defined by low embankments or dykes which are built upward as the fill progresses. The sluices are carried parallel to, and just inside of, these dykes. The sluices discharge their water-earth mixture at intervals, the water fanning out and flowing towards the central pool which is maintained at the desired level by discharge control. While flowing from the sluices, coarse material is deposited first and then finer material is deposited (fine material has a slower terminal velocity thus takes longer to settle, see Stoke's Law) as the flow velocity is reduced towards the center of the dam. This fine material forms an impervious core to the dam. The water flow must be well controlled at all times, otherwise the central section may be bridged by tongues of coarse material which would facilitate seepage through the dam later.|$|E
50|$|The North Platte {{emerges from}} the {{mountains}} near Casper, where it turns and flows east-southeast, along {{the northern edge of}} the Laramie Mountains onto the Great Plains. The North Platte flows east-southeast across the plains of eastern Wyoming, past the town of Douglas, Wyoming and through Glendo and Guernsey Reservoirs. It then flows past the Fort Laramie National Historic Site (the former site of Fort Laramie), where it is joined by the Laramie River. The North Platte is joined by Horse Creek flowing in from Wyoming near the Wyoming-Nebraska border as its last significant addition. It crosses into western Nebraska, flowing east-southeast between the cities of Scottsbluff, Nebraska and Gering, Nebraska. In Keith County, Nebraska, the Kingsley Dam forms Lake C.W. McConaughy, the largest reservoir in Nebraska and a significant irrigation and recreation facility for the region. Kingsley Dam, constructed in 1935 to 1941, is located {{on the east side of}} Lake McConaughy in central Keith County, Nebraska, and is the second largest <b>hydraulic</b> <b>fill</b> <b>dam</b> in the world. East of the Kingsley dam the North Platte River flows nearly parallel to the South Platte River.

40|$|A {{vast amount}} {{and variety of}} mine {{tailings}} are produced around the world each day. In the gold¬mining industry in South Africa the residue of crushed are is disposed of in large tailings or <b>hydraulic</b> <b>fill</b> <b>dams.</b> The outer walls of these dams are built up of layers of material, {{each of which is}} allowed to dry before the next layer is placed. In order to study the stability of these walls, the appropriate engineering properties of the tailings must be ascertained. Due to the construction technique used in tailings dam construction, the outer walls are in an unsaturated state, which also means that suctions are generated within the tailings. Various techniques exist to measure suction, most of which are indirect methods. The recent development of the mid-¬plane suction probe at the University of Pretoria created the opportunity of measuring suctions directly on desiccating samples of gold mine tailings. A test method has been developed from which soil mechanics parameters can be derived from suction measurements. The experimental programme consisted of a series of these newly developed tests on fine and coarse samples of gold mine tailings, as well as on different particle size ranges. The experimental results were used {{in the development of a}} new method of predicting the air-entry value, with only the grading of the tailings known. A new method of predicting the soil-water characteristic curve up to the air-entry value was also proposed. The results of the research showed that the tailings remain saturated up to the air-entry value. The clay, fine silt and medium silt sized tailings was found to be the controlling particle size ranges in the development of suctions. The vast amount of parameters and information gained through the use of the proposed test method clearly indicates its effectiveness in studying the performance and characteristics of a material drying from saturation. The results also indicated the effectiveness of the mid-plane suction probe for the direct measurement of suction. Dissertation (M Eng (Geotechnical Engineering)) [...] University of Pretoria, 2006.

40|$|The {{static and}} dynamic {{behavior}} of a quartz sand containing various percentages of plastic and nonplastic fines is investigated systematically in the laboratory. A new specimen preparation technique for sands containing fines was developed; the technique is particularly suitable for elemental study of homogeneous specimens of sands with fines deposited in aquatic environments such as those found in alluvial deposits, <b>hydraulic</b> <b>fills,</b> tailings <b>dams,</b> and off-shore deposits. The fabric of sands containing fines was examined using the environmental scanning electron microscope (ESEM). An alternative method to evaluate the minimum density of clean, silty and clayey sands deposited through water is suggested. Static, monotonic, isotropically consolidated drained triaxial tests were performed to evaluate the stress-strain-volumetric response and determine the intrinsic variables of these non-textbook soils. Piezoceramic bender element instrumentation was developed and integrated into a conventional triaxial apparatus; shear-wave velocity measurements were made with this device to evaluate the small-strain stiffness properties of the sands tested at various states. The intrinsic variables that characterize critical state, dilatancy, and small-strain stiffness properties of clean, silty and clayey sands were determined allowing analyses of soil behavior {{to be carried out}} using an appropriate theoretical framework for granular soils. Undrained cyclic triaxial tests were carried out to investigate the effect of fines on the liquefaction resistance of sand. A new approach to evaluate the liquefaction initiation of sands is proposed based on a combination of analysis and laboratory testing. All aspects of the mechanical behavior investigated in this study (e. g. stress-strain-volumetric behavior, shear strength, stiffness at very small strains, and liquefaction resistance) are affected by both the amount and plasticity of the fines present in the sand. Micro-structural evaluation using the ESEM highlighted the importance of soil fabric on overall soil response. The results of this research provide new insights into the evaluation of liquefaction initiation of sands containing fines; the results suggest that fines plasticity and penetration rate effects may be overlooked by current empirical relationships widely-used in practice. ...|$|R

40|$|<b>Hydraulic</b> <b>fill</b> is {{the most}} common type of {{backfill}} used in the underground mines in Australia and world-wide. These fills are granular in nature and are expected to have adequate drainage characteristics when placed underground in the form of slurry, enabling quick discharge of all excess water through the horizontal drives placed at various levels.

40|$|<b>Hydraulic</b> <b>fills</b> {{are quite}} popular as {{backfilling}} materials for underground voids {{created in the}} process of mining. For ease of transport through pipes, they are placed in the form of slurry and allowed to settle freely under self weight.

Porous brick barricades are placed across horizontal access drives to retain the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>fill,</b> allowing free drainage and enabling the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>fill</b> to settle under its self-weight.

An embankment dam is one but important of them and may lead to large financial losses, floods and mortality {{in the case of}} failure. During Earthquake, one of the main dangers that threaten an embankment is liquefaction. The phenomenon of liquefaction summarized as loose of saturated sands, gravels, or silts having a contractive structure and it may occur when such materials are subjected to earthquake`s shear deformations due to increasing pore water pressure. Liquefaction induced ground deformation and building settlements were severe and widespread during the 1990 Manjil, Iran earthquake [1]. But the first fundamental observation of damages attributed to liquefaction was made in the 1964 Niigata, Japan and 1964 Alaska, North America earthquakes.

These backfills provide safe working conditions and increase the strength of the ground. Hydraulic backfills consist of classified mine tailings with not more than 10 % by weight of size less than 10 μm and approximately 70 % by solid weight. These are prepared on the surface by dewatering the mine tailings and transported to the stope transported by gravity through boreholes and pipelines. The solid particles of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>fills</b> settle rapidly after entering the stopes. Excess water initially tends to pond on the surface building up from the lowest corners of a stope and then commences a vertical path of drainage due to gravity. Several miners and equipment had been trapped in mines due to barricade failures and the resulting in rush of mine fills into the drives. An extensive study of drainage and settlement characteristics of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>fills</b> is required to improve design of drainage and barricades. Most permeability measurements reported in the literature are from undisturbed or reconstituted samples in the laboratory under no surcharge. However, in the mine stopes the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>fill</b> is subjected to significant surcharge due to the overburden. In this research, extensive laboratory tests have been performed to measure permeability of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>fill</b> samples subjected to vertical stress. An analytical solution has been developed to estimate vertical stress development in a vertical and inclined mine stope using continuous compression arch of principal stresses. It has been verified with different analytical model discussed in literature. Degree of saturation of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>fills</b> within mine stopes decreases with continuous drainage of water through barricades. Laboratory tests have been performed to study the moisture content variation in a mine stope with depth and time. Soil-water characteristic curves have been developed using Filter Paper Method for <b>hydraulic</b> <b>fills.</b> Permeability of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>fill</b> has been computed using vertical stress and moisture content variation in a stope.
