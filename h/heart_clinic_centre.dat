40|$|Objective: To compare between adult {{patients}} with heart failure after hospital discharge in a <b>heart</b> failure <b>clinic</b> and daily practice {{in terms of}} survival, readmission rate, and quality of life. Material and Method: The authors followed 100 patients who received care in the <b>heart</b> failure <b>clinic</b> (n = 50) or the usual care (n = 50) for twelve months. Results: During follow-up, patients in the <b>heart</b> failure <b>clinic</b> group had fewer readmissions (12 vs. 23; p = 0. 04). There were eight deaths {{in the control group}} and seven deaths in the <b>heart</b> failure <b>clinic</b> group (p = 0. 45). At the end of the present study, mean left ventricular ejection fraction, mean distance of 6 -minute walk test, and mean quality of life scores in the treatment group improved more than in the control group (p = 0. 038; 0. 032; 0. 048, respectively). Conclusion: The <b>heart</b> failure <b>clinic</b> reduces hospital readmission and improves cardiac function and quality of life for heart failure patients...|$|R
5000|$|The Oakland’s Children Hospital farmer’s market aim is {{to offer}} an {{extensive}} variety of fruits, vegetables, plants, seeds, and other treats as cheaply possible. To make the produce as affordable as possible they offer $5 food vouchers (“carrot cash”) and accept food stamps {{in order to help}} get people more interested in exploring healthy food. Its location is also convenient because patients have to walk through the farmer’s market as they leave the hospital. [...] Furthermore, the farmer’s market is on the same day as the Healthy <b>Hearts</b> <b>Clinic,</b> a pediatric program dedicated to preventing and treating childhood diet-related illnesses, so that the patients are more likely to visit the produce stand.

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{the prevalence of}} congenital heart disease (CHD) among the patients who refferred to the <b>heart</b> <b>clinic</b> {{so as to make}} an early and correct diagnosis. Methods: In this descriptive-cross sectional study, all the patients admitted to the <b>heart</b> <b>clinic</b> who had symptoms or signs of CHD were included. The data were collected in one year based on the medical records. The main variables consisted of age, gender, history of folic acid consumption by the mother in pregnancy, clinical signs, symptoms and so on. Results: Among the 763 admitted patients, 498 were males and the rest were females. Infants were the most common group and teenagers were the least one. The most common findings for which the patients had been referred were chest pain and a murmur heard during a normal physical examination. Based on the echocardiography findings, ventricular and atrial septal defects were the most common ones. The history of folic acid consumption was negative in 168 mothers within their pregnancy. Conclusions: Since the causes and risk factors in the incidence of CHD in children are numerous, we recommended that the information about these diseases should be given to the community and strengthen the referral system, design registration system of CHD set up in the country round...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examined}} adherence to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy among 171 <b>heart</b> failure <b>clinic</b> patients. Adherence was monitored over a 3 -month period {{with an electronic}} event monitor housed in a medication bottle cap, which recorded the date and time the cap was opened and closed. The average percentage of days that the prescribed number of doses (regimen adherence) was taken over the observation period was 84 %. Seventy-one percent of patients showed 85 %- 100 % adherence with their daily regimen; 19 % exhibited less than 70 % adherence. The overall high rates of adherence to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy observed among <b>heart</b> failure <b>clinic</b> patients is consistent with research that shows improved outcomes for patients managed in <b>heart</b> failure <b>clinics.</b> Electronic medication monitoring {{can be useful in}} identifying a substantial fraction of patients who are poorly adherent so that interventions to improve adherence can be targeted toward them. Additional research is needed to develop and test adherence-enhancing interventions. Copyright 2002 CHF, Inc...|$|R

40|$|Objecti¤e: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{describe}} the nurse-led heart failure care in Sweden. Methods: A postal questionnaire was sent to all 86 hospitals in Sweden treating heart failure patients. All hospitals completed the questionnaire, which contained 20 questions about heart failure nurses, patient education, <b>heart</b> failure <b>clinics,</b> co-operation with primary. healthcare and care programmes. Results: Sixty-nine percent of all hospitals ns 86 had nurses specialised in taking care of heart failure patients, in total 148 heart failure nurses. The nurses were involved in patient education and follow-up. There were nurse-led <b>heart</b> failure <b>clinics</b> in 66 % of the hospitals. The clinics provided follow-up after hospitalisation, telephone counselling and drug titration. The majority of the heart failure nurses had been delegated the responsibility for making protocol-led changes in medications. Most clinics registered the number of annual visits to the clinic, and the largest clinic had up to 1000 visits. Approximately half of the hospitals had a special care plan for patients with heart failure and an organised co-operation with primary healthcare. Conclusion: The ®rst nurse-led <b>heart</b> failure <b>clinic</b> started in Sweden in 1990 and since then the model has been spread to two-thirds of the Swedish hospitals.
