40|$|Waste is {{produced}} in large quantities in cattle feedlots, {{and this is a}} potential environmental pollutant. Recycling of feedlot waste as livestock feed has been investigated extensively as one means of lowering the disposable waste load. Refeeding fresh manure will only partially alleviate waste disposal problems. In one study, only about one-half <b>of</b> the <b>manure</b> collected daily could be refed, and the remainder was discarded. Currently, there is increased interest {{in the development of a}} microbial process for recycling and utilizing feedlot wastes. Commercial digestors are in operation. In some of these systems, the potential exists for capturing methane as a product <b>of</b> <b>fermentation</b> and recovering a biomass product which has potential feed value. Because of high capital costs associated with the equipment, labor, etc., necessary for the fermentation process, preliminary economic analyses indicate that, for the fermentation system to be profitable at moderate feedlot sizes, the operation must show a reasonable return for the feeding value of the fermentor effluent biomass. Based on its nutrient content (particularly total nitrogen, amino acids, and some essential minerals), fermentor effluent should be a good dietary supplement for ruminant livestock. Thermophilic (high temperature) anaerobic <b>fermentation</b> <b>of</b> livestock <b>manures</b> has several advantages that make it attractive for more detailed investigation. Thermophilic fermentation has the potential for higher methane production rates, and minimizes the potential for disease transmission compared with mesophilic (ambient temperature) systems.

An assessment of the potential <b>of</b> <b>manure</b> to sustain crop production calls for an estimation of the amounts <b>of</b> <b>manure</b> that could be produced and captured and the feed resources required to maintain livestock used for manuring. This paper presents estimates of the amounts <b>of</b> <b>manure</b> produced by cattle, goats and sheep fed ad libitum under confinement. A model is presented to predict the yearly faecal output by grazing ruminants under fluctuating feed supplies. Statistics on livestock population and cultivated areas are used to evaluate the effects of livestock to cropped area ratios and the spatial location <b>of</b> livestock at <b>manuring</b> time, on the potential amounts <b>of</b> <b>manure</b> available for crop production.

The tests confirmed the positive effect of co-fermentation <b>of</b> poultry <b>manure</b> with corn silage. The most favourable ratio for mixing the substrates is the equal percentage of their dry matter in the mixture. With such waste mixing proportions, the degree of degradation of organic substances contained in the manure amounted to 61. 8 % and was higher than in the mono-digestion <b>of</b> <b>manure</b> and corn silage...|$|R

Lycopersicon esculentum), two studies were conducted on randomized complete block design with three replications at Research green house, College of Agriculture, Ferdowsi University of Mashhad and Nemooneh field of Astane Ghods Razavi during two years of 2009 and 2010. Greenhouse study treatments were consist of poultry, cow, sheep manure and spent mushroom compost, which each one applied at four rates (10, 20, 30 and 40 t. ha- 1). Field experiment treatments were included of poultry, cow and sheep manure that each one applied at two rates (20 and 40 t. ha- 1). Result of the greenhouse study indicated that poultry manure significantly reduced orobanch infestation and increase tomato dry weight compared to control. But in the field experiment, the maximum fruit yield (68 t. ha- 1) with the minimum orobanch dry weight were obtained with sheep <b>manure.</b> The effect <b>of</b> cow <b>manure</b> was similar to poultry manure in all measured traits. In the field study, rates <b>of</b> <b>manure</b> application had no significant effect on orobanch fresh and dry weights. The findings indicated that all treatments <b>of</b> animal <b>manure</b> reduced orobanch infestation. But the mechanism of orobanch growth suppression due to animal manures application is unknown. It seems <b>fermentation</b> <b>of</b> different organic matters can produced heat and the resulting toxic compounds such as certain organic acids, ammonia and ammonium salts that may reduce orobanch growth at proper concentrations...|$|R

Preliminary batch tests {{were performed to}} evaluate best conditions for volatile fatty acid (VFA) production from microalgal biomass, {{with respect to the}} inoculum, pH and nutrients. The use <b>of</b> bovine <b>manure</b> as inoculum, the operating pH of 4. 5 and the addition of a nutrient mix, resulted in a high VFA production of up to 222 mg g- 1 total volatile solid (TVS), with a butyrate share of 27...|$|R
40|$|An {{economic}} model {{was developed to}} evaluate cost and value <b>of</b> <b>manure</b> distribution. A 2, 500 head feedlot {{was used as a}} case study to calculate excretion amounts from cattle fed diets with a range of phosphorus. Diet P and subsequent costs <b>of</b> distributing that <b>manure</b> were used to analyze the corresponding costs <b>of</b> <b>manure</b> P distribution, in addition to determining the required acres needed to be in compliance with a nutrient management plan (NMP) based on use <b>of</b> <b>manure</b> P by the crops grown. The model illustrated when animals are fed diets of increasing P concentration, total distribution cost increased, ranging from $ 2. 80 - $ 5. 10 /head finished/year, but the agronomic and market value <b>of</b> <b>manure</b> produced increased at a rate faster than the rate of increasing costs of distribution for a small feedlot...|$|R
