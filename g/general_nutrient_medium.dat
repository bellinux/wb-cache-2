30|$|Bacteriocin {{production}} {{is strongly dependent on}} medium composition (Gänzle et al. 1999). MRS medium {{is a rich}} medium with a mixture of different carbon sources and complex nitrogen sources. BHI is a <b>general</b> purpose <b>nutrient</b> <b>medium</b> recommended for the cultivation of a variety of microorganisms including bacteria, yeasts and mold. Growth kinetics results showed that BHI broth with initial pH 7.4 was an ideal growth condition for LAB (Table  1). However, the bacteriocin activity was not found when LAB strains were cultured in BHI broth with initial pH 7.4 at 37  °C for 16  h. This finding was consistent with the report by Khalil et al. (2009) that the highest bacteriocin inhibitory effect was obtained in MRS broth incubated at 30  °C for 12 – 18  h while BHI medium was not suitable for bacteriocin production. Moreover, the lower antimicrobial activity (200  AU ml− 1) of bacteriocin ST 151 BR was recorded in M 17 broth, BHI broth, soymilk and molasses in comparison to in MRS broth (6400  AU ml− 1) despite relatively good growth (Todorov and Dicks 2004). Similar results were reported by De Kwaadsteniet et al. (2005) that MRS broth was the optimal medium for bacteriocin production of E. mundtii ST 15 compared to BHI broth, M 17 broth, soymilk and molasses. In our previous studies, the bacteriocin activity of LAB was not detected following incubation for 16  h in M 17 medium. Therefore, some culture media used for the cultivation of microorganisms may not be suitable medium for bacteriocins production.|$|R

40|$|Remediation {{processes}} for recovery and reuse of chromated-copper-arsenate- (CCA) treated wood are not gaining wide acceptance {{because they are}} more expensive than landfill disposal. One reason is the high cost of the <b>nutrient</b> <b>medium</b> used to culture the metal-tolerant bacterium, Bacillus licheniformis, which removes 70 - 100 % of the copper, chromium, and arsenic from CCA-treated southern yellow pine (CCA-SYP) in a two-step process involving oxalic acid extraction and bacterial culture. To reduce this cost, the nutrient concentration in the culture medium and the ratio of wood to <b>nutrient</b> <b>medium</b> were optimized. Maximum metal removal occurred when B. licheniformis was cultured in 1. 0 % <b>nutrient</b> <b>medium</b> and at a wood to <b>nutrient</b> <b>medium</b> ratio of 1 : 10. Also, malted barley, an abundant by-product of brewing, was evaluated as an alternative <b>nutrient</b> <b>medium.</b> Tests were done to determine absorption of metals by barley, and the results indicate that the barley acted as a biosorbent, removing heavy metals from the liquid culture after their release from CCA to SYP.

It is established that the fungi L. cyathiformis IX, when is grown for 30 days in the <b>nutrient</b> <b>medium</b> of Czapek’s (control) has a most physiological activity. It is shown that the organic addition in the mineral <b>nutrient</b> <b>medium</b> of Czapek’s decreases an ability of fungi to accumulate the biomass (0, 43 - 0, 42 mg/ml), but all fungi studied had different ability to produce extracelluar proteins in the <b>nutrient</b> <b>medium.</b> The spectrophotometry method to define ligninolitic activity of the studied basidiomycetes has been used. It is shown that the increase of the optical density (D 380 D 440) in the cultural liquid against control <b>nutrient</b> <b>medium</b> presupposes that lignolitic ferments in the CL are available. But the ligninolitic activity of conifer affecting is determined not only by their appertaining to certain species but also depends upon {{the nature of the}} organic addition.

40|$|The green alga, Selenastrum capricornutum, was cultured in {{artificial}} <b>nutrient</b> <b>medium</b> utilizing five-gallon carboys, each {{of which}} contained 16 1. of culture. The algal cells were separated from the <b>nutrient</b> <b>medium</b> by continuous-flow centrifugation at 7500 RPM, and were then lyophilized. The lyophilized cells were extracted by refluxing with ether, acetone, and chloroform:methanol (2 : 1). Free sterols and sterol esters were separated from the crude extract using preparative thin-layer chromatography. Sterol esters were saponified and both the sterols and the fatty acids were recovered. Individual sterols were separated from the free sterol fraction using argentation thin-layer chromatography. Gas chromatograms, mass spectra, and ultraviolet spectra were obtained for these sterols. The free sterol fraction was found to contain approximately 40 % 24 -methylcholesta- 5, 7 -dien- 3 B-ol and 60 % 24 -ethylcholesta- 5, 7 -dien- 3 B-ol. The sterol ester fraction also contained these two sterols; however, the composition and amount of esterified sterols varied {{as a function of}} culture age. Sterol ester content was higher for older cultures, and in older cultures the composition of the esterified sterols more closely resembled that of the free sterols. The fatty acids obtained from the saponification of the sterol esters were methylated and were analyzed using gas chromatography. Tentative identifications, based upon comparative retention times, were made for several of these acids. Sterols were extracted from the <b>nutrient</b> <b>medium</b> after harvest of the algal cells. Extraction was accomplished by mixing large quantities of <b>nutrient</b> <b>medium</b> with ether for several days, or by shaking small aliquots with ether. 24 -methylcholesta- 5, 7 -dien- 3 B-ol and 24 ethylcholesta- 5, 7 -dien- 3 B-ol were isolated from the <b>nutrient</b> <b>medium</b> in approximately the same relative amounts as from the algal cells. The concentration of sterols in the <b>nutrient</b> <b>medium</b> was approximately equal to the water-solubility of cholesterol (25 - 29) t g. /l.). Extraction procedures which release sterols from water soluble complexes were carried out on extracted cells and on extracted <b>nutrient</b> <b>medium.</b> These procedures failed to yield measurable quantities of sterols. Treatment of extracted cells with strong base and subsequent extraction showed that all sterols had been extracted without prior cell lysis or pretreatment.

40|$|Fresh {{allograft}} valves {{stored in}} a <b>nutrient</b> <b>medium</b> at + 4 degrees C have a limited storage time of eight weeks. Dura mater has been stored in glycerol for longer periods, and this paper presents work on the glycerol storage of allograft heart valves. The elastic properties of the valve cusps showed a fall during storage in glycerol that was associated with an altered histological appearance of the cusp tissue. The loss in nuclearity in the histological sections of stored tissue was partially responsible for the observed decrease in viability during storage. All these changes during storage in glycerol, or glycerol and subsequent antibiotic treatment, were similar to the changes seen in valves {{stored in a}} <b>nutrient</b> <b>medium.</b> Glycerol therefore offers an alternative storage system to the cold <b>nutrient</b> <b>medium</b> but has no practical advantages.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a bench-scale {{study on the}} transport in highly permeable porous rock of three bacterial species—Bacillus subtilis, Pseudomonas putida, and Clostridium acetobutylicum—potentially applicable in microbial-enhanced oil recovery processes. The transport of cells during the injection of bacterial suspension and <b>nutrient</b> <b>medium</b> was simulated by a deep bed filtration model. Deep bed filtration coefficients and the maximum capacity of cells in porous rock were measured. Low to intermediate (∼ 106 /ml) injection concentrations of cellular suspensions are recommended because plugging of inlet surface {{is less likely to}} occur. In addition to their resistance to adverse environments, spores of clostridia are strongly recommended for use in microbial-enhanced oil recovery processes since they are easiest among the species tested to push through porous rock.

However, the mechanisms by which the activities of individual cells are coordinated to manifest this collective behaviour are currently unclear. Here we have developed a novel assay that enables detailed microscopic examination of M. xanthus motility at the interstitial interface between solidified <b>nutrient</b> <b>medium</b> and a glass coverslip. Under these conditions, M. xanthus motility is characterised by extensive micro-morphological patterning that is considerably more elaborate than occurs at an air-surface interface. We have found that during motility on solidified <b>nutrient</b> <b>medium,</b> M. xanthus forges an interconnected furrow network that is lined with an extracellular matrix comprised of exopolysaccharides, extracellular lipids, membrane vesicles and an unidentified slime.

Five-hundred thirty-three of these genes had transcripts that were {{at least four times}} more abundant during growth on at least one wood <b>medium</b> than on <b>nutrient</b> <b>medium.</b> The 30 transcripts that were on average over 100 times more abundant during growth on wood than on <b>nutrient</b> <b>medium</b> included 6 manganese peroxidases, 5 cellulases, 2 hemicellulases, a lignin peroxidase, glyoxal oxidase, and a P 450 monooxygenase. Notably, among the genes encoding putative cellulases, one encoding a glycosyl hydrolase family 61 protein had the highest relative transcript abundance during growth on wood. Overall, transcripts predicted to encode lignin-degrading activities were more abundant than those predicted to encode carbohydrate-active enzymes. Transcripts predicted to encode three MnPs represented the most highly abundant transcripts in wood-grown cultivations compared to <b>nutrient</b> <b>medium</b> cultivations.
