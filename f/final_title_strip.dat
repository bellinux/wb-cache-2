50|$|The {{first meeting}} {{between the two sides}} was played on 23 September 1945 and ended in a 1-1 draw. Following Jean-Michel Aulas's {{acquisition}} of Olympique Lyonnais in 1987, the rivalry entered a more competitive environment. In 1989, Marseille began an impressive streak of five consecutive French league titles, though the fifth and <b>final</b> <b>title</b> was <b>stripped,</b> due to the Bernard Tapie scandal, which saw the club relegated to the second division. Marseille also won the 1993 edition of the European Cup. One notable match during the streak was a 7-0 thrashing of Lyon by Marseille during the 1990-91 season.|$|R
