5|$|BitLocker {{is a full}} disk <b>encryption</b> feature {{included}} with Windows Vista and later. It is designed to protect data by providing <b>encryption</b> for entire volumes. By default it uses the AES <b>encryption</b> algorithm in cipher block chaining (CBC) or XTS mode with a 128-bit or 256-bit key. CBC is not used over the whole disk; it is applied to each individual sector.|$|E
5|$|Windows Mobile 6.5, Windows RT {{and core}} edition of Windows 8.1 include device <b>encryption,</b> a feature-limited version of BitLocker that encrypts the whole system. Logging {{in with a}} Microsoft account with {{administrative}} privileges automatically begins the <b>encryption</b> process. The recovery key is stored to either the Microsoft account or Active Directory, allowing it to be retrieved from any computer. While device <b>encryption</b> is offered on all versions of 8.1, unlike BitLocker, device <b>encryption</b> requires that the device meet the InstantGo (formerly Connected Standby) specifications, which requires solid-state drives, non-removable RAM (to protect against cold boot attacks) and a TPM 2.0 chip.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} forms of malware, {{security}} software (antivirus software) might not detect a ransomware payload, or, {{especially in the case}} of encrypting payloads, only after <b>encryption</b> is under way or complete, particularly if a new version unknown to the protective software is distributed. If an attack is suspected or detected in its early stages, it takes some time for <b>encryption</b> to take place; immediate removal of the malware (a relatively simple process) before it has completed would stop further damage to data, without salvaging any already lost.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} constructions for {{cryptographic hash}} functions based on m-bit block ciphers. First {{we present a}} new attack on the LOKIDBH mode: the attack finds collisions in 2 3 m= 4 <b>encryptions,</b> which should be compared to 2 m <b>encryptions</b> for a brute force attack. This attack breaks the last remaining subclass in a wide class of efficient hash functions which have been proposed in the literature. We then analyze hash functions based on a collision resistant compression function for which finding a collision requires at least 2 m <b>encryptions,</b> providing a lower bound {{of the complexity of}} collisions of the hash function. A new class of constructions is proposed, based on error correcting codes over GF(2 2) and a proof of security is given, which relates their security to that of single block hash functions. For example, a compression function is presented which requires about 4 <b>encryptions</b> to hash an m-bit block, and for which finding a collision requires at least 2 m <b>encryptions</b> [...] ...|$|R

5|$|The Nintendo DSi {{connects to}} the Internet via either its {{built-in}} 802.11b/g Wi-Fi or a Nintendo Wi-Fi USB Connector; both methods grant access to the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection service.

Up to six wireless Internet connection profiles can be saved; using the traditional setup method, the first three profiles support WEP <b>encryption,</b> while the remaining three are selectable under a more advanced option, which supports WPA <b>encryption.</b> Under this advanced option, users may access the Wi-Fi Protected Setup method and configure proxy settings. The DSi can automatically detect Nintendo Zone service areas thus preventing the need to manually setup Wi-Fi connections.

Comparing these two examples we find that the presented voting system based on verifiable secret sharing is more secure then the one based on homomorphic <b>encryptions,</b> both in regard to privacy and robustness.

40|$|Abstract. DEAL is a six- or eight-round Luby-Rackoff cipher {{that uses}} DES as its round function, with allowed key lengths of 128, 192, and 256 bits. In this paper, we discuss two new {{results on the}} DEAL key schedule. First, we discuss the {{existence}} of equivalent keys for all three key lengths; pairs of equivalent keys in DEAL- 128 require about 2 64 DES <b>encryptions</b> to find, while equivalent keys in DEAL- 192 and DEAL- 256 require only six or eight DES <b>encryptions</b> to find. Second, we discuss a new related-key attack on DEAL- 192 and DEAL- 256. This attack requires 2 33 related key queries, the same 3 plaintexts encrypted under each key, and may be implemented {{with a variety of}} time-memory tradeoffs; Given 3 × 2 69 bytes of memory, the attack requires 2 113 DES <b>encryptions,</b> and given 3 × 2 45 bytes of memory, the attack requires 2 137 DES <b>encryptions.</b> We conclude with some questions raised by the analysis...|$|R
