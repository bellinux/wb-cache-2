5|$|In 1788, {{he married}} Maria <b>Francisca</b> Cabrera y Saavedra, his cousin. <b>Francisca</b> was rich, {{and it is}} likely that it was an {{arranged}} marriage. They had three sons, Diego, Mariano and Manuel. <b>Francisca</b> died in 1798. Saavedra began his political career in 1797, working at the Buenos Aires Cabildo, assuming various administrative roles. By then, the city had become the capital of the Viceroyalty of the Rio de la Plata. His first political appointment was as fourth alderman, and third alderman the following year. In 1801, he was appointed Mayor of First Vote. That same year he married his second wife, Doña Saturnina Otárola del Rivero. In 1805, he was appointed to the position of Grain manager, within a local governmental body that dealt with the provision of wheat and other cereals in the city. It is considered that Saavedra supported the proposals of Manuel Belgrano at the Commerce Consulate of Buenos Aires, which promoted agriculture, education and industrialization, but there is no definitive evidence of it.|$|E
5|$|Ana <b>Francisca</b> Pérez García, Don Baltasar's wife, was a {{noteworthy}} {{woman in}} El Hatillo, attending to community children, elders and ill citizens. She donated {{a considerable amount}} of money {{for the construction of a}} hospital in Petare after the 1812 earthquake; this hospital is currently known as the Pérez de León de Petare Hospital.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, a 21.5 hectare plot of land in the Sulucan Hills of Sampaloc, Manila was donated by <b>Francisca</b> Bustamante Bayot to the Dominican fathers for the University's expansion outside Intramuros. In 1927, Main Building, the first earthquake-proof building in the Philippines, was then inaugurated at the Sulucan site.|$|E

5|$|Miguel feigned {{compliance}} with PedroI's plans. As {{soon as he}} was declared regent in early 1828, and backed by Carlota Joaquina, he abrogated the Constitution and, supported by those Portuguese in favor of absolutism, was acclaimed King Dom MiguelI. As painful as was his beloved brother's betrayal, PedroI also endured the defection of his surviving sisters, Maria Teresa, Maria <b>Francisca,</b> Isabel Maria and Maria da Assunção, to MiguelI's faction. Only his youngest sister, Ana de Jesus, remained faithful to him, and she later traveled to Rio de Janeiro to be close to him. Consumed by hatred and beginning to believe rumors that MiguelI had murdered their father, PedroI turned his focus on Portugal and tried in vain to garner international support for MariaII's rights.|$|E
5|$|Following {{a fire at}} the Ajuda Palace in 1794, the Prince Regent John VI and {{his wife}} Carlotta Joaquina began to use Queluz themselves. The Robillon wing was {{enlarged}} and given an upper floor {{for the use of}} the princess and her nine children. These additions were destroyed in the fire of 1934. To escape the forces of Napoleon I in 1807, the Portuguese royal family abandoned Queluz and fled to Brazil. The French occupational forces took control of the palace, and their commander, General Junot, made several alterations to the building. On the royal family's return from exile in 1821, the King preferred to live at Mafra, leaving his wife, the Spanish Queen Carlotta Joaquina, to occupy Queluz with her aunt Princess Maria <b>Francisca</b> Benedita. The King visited Queluz infrequently. It was on one of these rare visits that João VI died in the circular domed King's Bedroom in 1826.|$|E

5|$|Her {{aspiration}} for fame commenced after she met Angel Anden and {{was asked to}} be a cover girl of the Valentine issue of the magazine (printed on Feb 15, 1953) called This Week (now, Chronical Magazine), where Anden was the editor. Imelda {{was not able to}} get an approval and acquire a sponsorship to participate in the Miss Manila contest from her cousins (Danieling, Eduardo, and Loreto), but, with the help of Adoracion, gained a sponsorship from Philippine Women's University after a meeting {{with the president of the}} university, Mrs. <b>Francisca</b> Benitez. The controversial Miss Manila beauty pageant dawned on Mar 1, 1953, when Imelda and the Reyes spouses were in great despair after hearing news that Norma Jimenez became the candidate of Miss Philippines and the winner of Miss Manila, and sought to meet the mayor of Manila, Aresenio Lacson, who revoked the decision and made Imelda Romualdez the winner of Miss Manila. The mayor announced that there were violations of rules by the International Fair Board, and it is the mayor's authority to nominate the candidate of the City of Manila for the beauty contest. It turned out that Imelda won 655 points whereas Norma Jimenez acquired 453 points. Both Imelda and Norma participated in Miss Philippines; however, the winner of Miss Philippines was Cristina Galang (Caedo, now) from Tarlac, who became one of the members of Imelda's band of women campaigners, Blue Ladies.|$|E

50|$|Mopsechiniscus <b>franciscae</b> is {{a species}} of tardigrade native to Antarctica. One of the most {{resilient}} species on Earth, it can survive conditions such as extreme temperatures, high pressure, poison, dehydration, radioactivity, and even vacuum, partly due to its ability to go into hibernation when deprived of water. Found in samples of moss growing on gravel along the shore of Victoria Land, the species has a reddish color but appears green after feeding due to being transparent. Males measure {{a quarter of a}} millimeter in length, and females are 50 percent larger.|$|R
50|$|The {{length of}} the {{forewings}} is about 60 mm. It is similar to Manduca <b>franciscae</b> and Manduca florestan, but longer winged than the latter. The forewing upperside ground colour is white with no discal spot. The markings are generally faint. The forewing underside is unicolorous brown and the marginal black band is very narrow. The fringe is mostly white but brown at the veins. The hindwing upperside is black, but suffused with white toward the anal angle. The hindwing underside is brown, with the basal third heavily suffused with white.|$|R

40|$|Despite the {{importance}} and regular occurrence of tardigrades in the Antarctic terrestrial ecosystem, taxonomic studies of, in particular, continental Antarctica species have advanced very slowly. During a large survey to study tardigrade biodiversity along the Victoria Land coastal line, a new species was found belonging to the rare heterotardigrade genus Mopsechiniscus. The new species Mopsechiniscus <b>franciscae</b> is described using an integrative taxonomy approach, combining morphological description (with light and electron microscopy techniques) and molecular characterisation (analysing portions of the 18 S and 28 S genes). The new species differed from other congeners by clear morphological characters related to shape and sculpture of cuticular plates, presence of papillae on legs, and length and number of body filaments. The results of the combined (18 S + 28 S) phylogenetic analyses (Bayesian and maximum likelihood) on Echiniscoidea indicate two main lineages: one incorporating the genus Echiniscoides (Echiniscoididae) and the other the current data on Echiniscidae and Oreellidae genera. Although the resolution of relationships within the latter line is not clear, there is a well-defined evolutionary line for Mopsechiniscus. The addition of continental Antarctic M. <b>franciscae</b> sp. nov. to the genus broadened the distributional range of Mopsechiniscus southwards and supported {{the hypothesis that the}} genus represents a Gondwanan faunal element. Our report of a new Antarctic species, belonging to this rare heterotardigrade genus, increases our knowledge of the underreported terrestrial meiofaunal communities within continental Antarctica...|$|R

5000|$|The Confraternitas Historica, or Confraternitas Historica Dominae <b>Franciscae</b> Comitis Sussexiae, is {{the history}} society of Sidney Sussex College and is reputed to be the longest-running student history society in Europe, having existed since 1910. In fact, no {{meetings}} were held from 1914 to 1919 but since, during the First World War, [...] "the University itself almost ceased to function ... the hiatus of 1914-19 is not counted as {{a break in the}} continuity of the society". The Latin name of the society reflects the tastes of Jack Reynolds, the High Church Fellow who presided over its creation, who also [...] "endowed the Society with an elaborate Latin initiation ceremony". Similarly, rather than being led by a President, the student in charge of the society is instead 'Princeps'. Other society roles include the 'Magister' and 'Comes'. Further, during society meetings all attendees are referred to in an egalitarian, though still Latinate, manner. Regardless of academic standing or stitle, all attendees are given the title of 'soror' (sister) or 'frater' (brother).|$|R
