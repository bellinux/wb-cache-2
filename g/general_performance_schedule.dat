40|$|Scheduling {{is crucial}} to the {{operation}} of logistics service supply chain (LSSC), so scientific performance evaluation method is required to evaluate the <b>scheduling</b> <b>performance.</b> Different from <b>general</b> project <b>performance</b> evaluation, <b>scheduling</b> activities are usually continuous and multiperiod. Therefore, the weight of <b>scheduling</b> <b>performance</b> evaluation index is not unchanged, but dynamically varied. In this paper, the factors that influence the <b>scheduling</b> <b>performance</b> are analyzed in three levels which are strategic environment, operating process, and scheduling results. Based on these three levels, the <b>scheduling</b> <b>performance</b> evaluation index system of LSSC is established. In all, a new performance evaluation method proposed based on dynamic index weight will have three innovation points. Firstly, a multiphase dynamic interaction method is introduced {{to improve the quality of}} quantification. Secondly, due to the large quantity of second-level indexes and the requirements of dynamic weight adjustment, the maximum attribute deviation method is introduced to determine weight of second-level indexes, which can remove the uncertainty of subjective factors. Thirdly, an adjustment coefficient method based on set-valued statistics is introduced to determine the first-level indexes weight. In the end, an application example from a logistics company in China is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method...|$|R

40|$|Proceedings Paper (for Acquisition Research Program) Naval ship {{acquisition}} {{is widely}} {{thought to be}} too expensive, too long, too uncertain, and too risky. Throughout the ship development process, decision makers at all levels are afflicted by unreliable estimates and projections of cost, <b>performance,</b> <b>schedule,</b> and risk of competing alternatives. In this context, ''decision makers'' includes senior Navy leadership, program officers, and ship design managers, all of whom make decisions affecting the eventual product. How can estimates and projections of cost, <b>performance,</b> <b>schedule,</b> and risk be improved? To some extent, decision making {{in the face of}} uncertainty is an inescapable part of the development of naval warships due to their unrivaled complexity. This is especially true {{in the early stages of}} ship development. However, analysis indicates that the quality of cost, <b>performance,</b> <b>schedule,</b> and risk estimates could be substantially improved by actions addressing the root causes of poor estimates. This paper examines four root causes of poor cost, <b>performance,</b> <b>schedule,</b> and risk estimates and projections in the context of ship information development and flow. Eight solution vectors are identified that can provide higher quality estimates and projections earlier in the design process, reducing the uncertainties faced by decision makers, saving expensive engineering labor, and increasing assurance that the delivered ship will satisfy requirements. The relationship of particular solution vectors to the particular root causes is provided in tabular and discussion form. Acquisition Research Progra...|$|R
