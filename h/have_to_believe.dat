500|$|A {{large crowd}} had started {{gathering}} around the paddock {{hours before the}} Belmont, many missing the races run {{earlier in the day}} for a chance to see the horses up close. Secretariat and Chenery were greeted with an enthusiasm that Chenery responded to with a wave or smile; Secretariat was imperturbable. A large cheer went up at the break, but as the race went on, the two most commonly reported reactions were disbelief and fear that Secretariat had gone too fast. When it was clear that Secretariat would win, the sound reached a crescendo that reportedly made the grandstand shake. Blood-Horse magazine editor Kent Hollingsworth described the impact: [...] "Two twenty-four flat! I don't believe it. Impossible. But I saw it. I can't breathe. He won by a sixteenth of a mile! I saw it. I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> it." ...|$|E
500|$|The story's central {{location}} {{was set at}} Steventon rectory where Austen was raised. While it had been demolished in 1824, Jarrold and his crew [...] "fortunately found a wonderful house that was very like the original... We honed the script as well {{to make it as}} practical as possible." [...] Stewart believed that the Austen house expressed their status and wealth, [...] "I think that you will lose the central thrust of the story unless you understand the status of the Austen's and that they are pretty poor. Jane spent all her formative years there and that was the place that influenced her view of the world. You <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that the family live in that house because that is a crucial piece of the jigsaw." [...] Scenes at Steventon rectory were filmed in Higginsbrook House, a few miles off Trim in County Meath. Later in fall 2006, it appeared again as the house of the Morlands in Northanger Abbey.|$|E
500|$|Southampton's fifth round {{match was}} against Norwich City {{at home on}} 5 February 2003. Two goals {{in the space of}} three minutes, scored by Svensson and Tessem was enough to take the team into the quarter-finals. Southampton defender Claus Lundekvam was pleased with the win and said {{following}} the match: [...] "When you get to this stage in the competition you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> you can win it." [...] The club then faced Wolverhampton Wanderers at home in the following round. Former Wolves player Chris Marsden gave Southampton the lead in the 56th minute and with nine minutes remaining of normal time, the team added a second goal when Tessem's shot took a deflection off Paul Butler's legs to go inside the goal net. The victory meant Southampton reached the semi-finals of the FA Cup {{for the first time in}} 17 years. At Villa Park, Southampton played First Division team Watford on 13 April 2003. Brett Ormerod opened the scoring two minutes before half time and set up the second goal which the ball was taken over the line by Watford defender Paul Robinson. Despite Marcus Gayle scoring a late header to half the scoreline Southampton won the match.|$|E

500|$|Writers Glen Morgan and James Wong {{developed}} the episode specially for Kristen Cloke, both for her experience as {{the protagonist of}} their series , to translate Morgan's feelings as his friendship with Cloke became an emotional relationship, and for showcasing her acting. Morgan stated, [...] "I knew she {{did a lot of}} characters and voices, so I wanted to incorporate that ... I wanted to write something for her that challenged her". Cloke did research on multiple personality disorders before filming, and based the various personalities on people she knew. Morgan also stated that he [...] "wanted to write something for David Duchovny that challenged him." [...] When pitching the idea to director Rob Bowman, the writers stated they wanted [...] "this episode to feel like the part in Ken Burns' Civil War documentary where they read the Sullivan Ballou letter." [...] Michael Massee wanted his characterization of Ephesian to be [...] "normal looking" [...] and [...] "nondemonic", explaining, [...] "You <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that he believes his own rap.

[...] Ebert and his colleague, Gene Siskel, gave the film a [...] "Two Thumbs Up" [...] rating on their syndicated television program, Siskel and Ebert and the Movies. Rita Kempley of The Washington Post praised the film's director, writing that [...] "Glimcher shows an epicure's taste in his choice of both cast and crew. The look of [...] "The Mambo Kings" [...] is doubtless richer than the text, which is, however, strengthened by Glimcher's nostalgia for the teenage, eager America of the 1950s." [...] Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly wrote, [...] "The Mambo Kings is most fun when it practically dares you to swoon. It's a movie you don't <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> to enjoy." [...] Betty Goodwin of the Los Angeles Times praised the film's visual style: [...] "The innocence of the pre-MTV '50s mambo scene is expressed through meticulously real details and honest styling." ...|$|E
500|$|Another media {{incident}} started {{during the}} New Hampshire primary September 27, 2003, when Clark {{was asked by}} space shuttle astronaut Jay C. Buckey what his vision for the space program was after the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster. Clark responded {{he was a great}} believer in the exploration of space but wanted a vision well beyond that of a new shuttle or space plane. [...] "I would like to see mankind get off this planet. I'd like to know what's out there beyond the solar system." [...] Clark thought such a vision could probably require a lifetime of research and development in various fields of science and technology. Then {{at the end of his}} remarks, Clark dropped a bombshell when he said [...] "I still believe in [...] But I can't believe that in all of human history we'll never ever be able to go beyond the speed of light to reach where we want to go. I happen to believe that mankind can do it. I've argued with physicists about it. I've argued with best friends about it. I just <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> it.

[...] These comments prompted a series of derisive headlines, such as [...] "Beam Us Up, General Clark" [...] in The New York Times, [...] "Clark is Light-Years Ahead of the Competition" [...] in The Washington Post, [...] "General Relativity (Retired)" [...] on the U.S. News & World Report website, and [...] "Clark Campaigns at Light Speed" [...] in Wired magazine.|$|E

500|$|Vlasic {{spent the}} 1989 {{off-season}} recovering form his injury, while the Chargers added another quarterback to the roster upon drafting Billy Joe Tolliver. After {{working out with}} the team during the preseason, he started the season on the Physically Unable to Perform list. With the Chargers having a reliable starter in Jim McMahon, who had been signed to the team, Vlasic was kept on the list for the season. In 1990, McMahon was released and John Friesz was drafted out of the University of Idaho, leaving Vlasic to compete with Friesz and David Archer for the backup quarterback job. As the preseason began for the 1990 San Diego Chargers season, the team released Archer, and the plan was for Friesz to split backup quarterback duties during the preseason. After an impressive preseason by Vlasic and only a pedestrian one by Tolliver, Chargers coach Dan Henning named Vlasic as the starting quarterback against the Dallas Cowboys in the season opener, citing that he was [...] "steadier" [...] than Tolliver. After losing the game 1714, the switch was made back to Tolliver as the starting quarterback, and was eventually named starter {{for the rest of}} the season. Despite this, Vlasic remained optimistic, saying, [...] "I feel confident in my ability, and I always have. I know I can get the job done whatever the situation. I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that." [...] Over the course of the 1990 season, Vlasic played in six games, completing 19 of 40 passes for 168 yards, one touchdown, two interceptions, and a passer rating of 46.7.|$|E
500|$|Nikita and Maggie Q's {{portrayal}} of the character was met with generally positive reactions from television critics. Nikita was included in TV Guides lists of [...] "TV's Sexiest Crime Fighters" [...] and [...] "TV's Toughest Ladies". Alessandra Stanley of The New York Times felt that Q was suited for the role, stating [...] "she has a solemn, exotic beauty and hauteur that echo the heroine's self-possession and cool relentlessness," [...] adding [...] "Nikita is noticeably more hard-boiled and less girlish than the undercover agent played by Jennifer Garner on Alias, or the C.I.A. rookie that Piper Perabo plays on Covert Affairs." [...] Troy Patterson of Slate felt that [...] "Ms. Q's Nikita is only half so crush-worthy as Bionic Woman's Jaime Sommers or Dollhouse's what's-her-name, but her predicament is no less tasty." [...] Robert Bianco of USA Today believed Q's performance was [...] "a fairly sizable incentive" [...] to watch the show, adding she [...] "combines stunt-fighting chops and lithe beauty with an unusual-for-the-genre air of somber intelligence. Her Nikita is not above cracking a joke, but it's clear from Q's eyes and bearing that she has suffered {{at the hands of}} evil men, and she's {{not going to take it}} anymore." [...] Alan Sepinwall of HitFix believed that Q [...] "carries herself in a way that makes it believable she could be a hard-core killer, and she has the requisite dramatic chops and charisma for the part." [...] Maureen Ryan of AOL TV said [...] "Maggie Q, has real charisma and presence; she invests Nikita's drive to bring down the secretive Division with potent energy. You <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that Nikita would devote her life to wreaking vengeance on the people she views as her former captors, and you also have to buy her as a butt-kicking, gun-toting action heroine who also looks great in a cocktail gown. Maggie Q makes all those things look easy." ...|$|E

John O'Hara remarked: [...] "George Gershwin died on July 11, 1937, but I don't <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> it if I don't want to." [...] He was interred at Westchester Hills Cemetery in Hastings-on-Hudson, New York.

2500|$|Voltaire (another {{prominent}} French {{writer of}} the Enlightenment), a generation after Pascal, rejected {{the idea that the}} wager was [...] "proof of God" [...] as [...] "indecent and childish", adding, [...] "the interest I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> a thing is no proof that such a thing exists". Pascal, however, did not advance the wager as a proof of God's existence but rather as a necessary pragmatic decision which is [...] "impossible to avoid" [...] for any living person. He argued that abstaining from making a wager is not an option and that [...] "reason is incapable of divining the truth"; thus, a decision of whether or not to believe in the existence of God must be made by [...] "considering the consequences of each possibility".|$|E
2500|$|He {{had his own}} {{idiosyncratic}} vocabulary: Although an agnostic atheist, {{he spoke}} of [...] "The Book", a visualization of a book in which God had written down {{the best and most}} elegant proofs for mathematical theorems.

[...] He himself doubted the existence of God, whom he called the [...] "Supreme Fascist" [...] (SF). He accused SF of hiding his socks and Hungarian passports, and of keeping the most elegant mathematical proofs to Himself. When he saw a particularly beautiful mathematical proof he would exclaim, [...] "This one's from The Book!" [...] This later inspired a book titled Proofs from the Book.|$|E
2500|$|John Hick {{used the}} term [...] "soul-making" [...] in his theodicy Evil and the God of Love to {{describe}} the kind of spiritual development that he believes justifies the existence of evil. This defense is employed by Michael Murray, who explains how, in his view, divine hiddenness is essential to soul-making. It may seem {{that it is not}} hard to imagine a world where God is known and yet believers act freely with ample opportunities for spiritual development. But Murray gives a deep and careful analysis of the argument, concluding that if God's existence were revealed in such a way as to remove reasonable non-belief, then [...] "any desire that we might <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> or act in ways contrary to that which has been revealed would be overwhelmed." ...|$|E

It also diversified Reform {{to a degree that}} made it hard to formulate a clear definition of it. Early and [...] "Classical" [...] Reform were characterized by a move away from traditional forms of Judaism combined with a coherent theology; [...] "New Reform" [...] sought, to a certain level, the reincorporation of many formerly discarded elements within the framework established during the [...] "Classical" [...] stage, though this very doctrinal basis became increasingly obfuscated. Critics, like Rabbi Dana Evan Kaplan, warned that Reform became more of a Jewish activities club, a means to demonstrate some affinity to one's heritage in which even rabbinical students do not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> in any specific theology or engage in any particular practice, rather than a defined belief system.|$|E
