5|$|In 1938 {{he played}} eight games for England, {{starting}} with defeat to a Scotland team containing a young Bill Shankly. He then travelled to Berlin for another encounter with Münzenberg, where pre-match he witnessed first hand the foreboding devotion the people showed the Führer when his motorcade <b>drove</b> <b>past</b> a café the England team were dining in. The game became infamous as The FA, themselves under instruction from the British government, informed the England team {{that they had}} to perform the Nazi salute as part of the strategy of appeasement. England won 6–3 with Matthews himself getting on the scoreboard having got the better of Münzenberg this time. The next game was a shock 2–1 defeat to Switzerland, which in turn was followed by a 4–2 win over France in Paris. Following the conclusion of this summer tour of the continent, Matthews scored in a 4–2 defeat to Wales in Cardiff, and then played in England's 3–0 win over a Europe XI at Highbury, their 4–0 win over Norway in Newcastle, and their 7–0 win over Ireland at Old Trafford.|$|E
25|$|Hariri {{was assassinated}} on 14 February 2005 when {{explosives}} equivalent to around 1800 kg of TNT were detonated as his motorcade <b>drove</b> <b>past</b> the St. George Hotel in Beirut.

The driver of another {{approaching}} vehicle saw this and reversed back up the road. Bryant also fired at this car, hitting it but not injuring anyone. Bryant then {{got back into the}} BMW and drove down the Seascape driveway to the house where the Martins, his first victims, lay dead.|$|E
500|$|On {{the morning}} of November 29, Clemmons drove a white pickup truck to Allen's home, and then Allen <b>drove</b> him <b>past</b> the Forza Coffee Co. coffee shop in Parkland, Washington, a suburb of Tacoma. After they saw marked police patrol cars in the parking lot, Allen <b>drove</b> back <b>past</b> the coffee shop and parked nearby. Some reports from {{witnesses}} said Clemmons parked his truck in a car wash north of the coffee shop and pretended to clean the vehicle, but never turned the hose on. Around 8 a.m, Clemmons walked into the Forza Coffee Co. coffee shop, where four police officers were working on laptops before their shift. Clemmons opened fire on the officers, shooting them to death.|$|R
50|$|On {{the morning}} of Sunday, November 29, 2009, the four {{officers}} were working on their laptop computers {{prior to the start}} of their shift inside a Forza Coffee Company coffee shop in nearby Parkland, adjacent to McChord Air Force Base. All four were in full uniform, armed, and wearing bulletproof vests. Clemmons drove a white pickup truck to Allen's home, then Allen <b>drove</b> him <b>past</b> the coffee shop. After they saw marked police patrol cars in the parking lot, Allen <b>drove</b> back <b>past</b> the coffee shop and parked nearby. Some reports from witnesses said Clemmons parked his truck in a car wash stall at the coffee shop and pretended to clean the vehicle, but never turned the hose on.|$|R

25|$|On 28 June 1914, Austrian Archduke Franz Ferdinand {{visited the}} Bosnian capital, Sarajevo. A {{group of six}} assassins (Cvjetko Popović, Gavrilo Princip, Muhamed Mehmedbašić, Nedeljko Čabrinović, Trifko Grabež, Vaso Čubrilović) from the Yugoslavist group Mlada Bosna, {{supplied}} by the Serbian Black Hand, had gathered on the street where the Archduke's motorcade would pass, {{with the intention of}} assassinating him. Čabrinović threw a grenade at the car, but missed. Some nearby were injured by the blast, but Ferdinand's convoy carried on. The other assassins failed to act as the cars <b>drove</b> <b>past</b> them.|$|E
25|$|Fouke {{estimated}} {{the man to}} be 35–45 years old, while the kids who observed the killer in Stine's cab mentioned he was 25–30 year old white male adult at about 5'8"-5'9". The radio dispatcher had alerted {{to be on the}} lookout for a black suspect, so they <b>drove</b> <b>past</b> him without stopping; the mix-up in descriptions remains unexplained to this day. A search ensued, but no possible suspects were found. The three teen witnesses worked with a police artist to prepare a composite sketch of Stine's killer; then, a few days later, this police artist returned, working with the witnesses to prepare a second composite sketch of the killer.|$|E
25|$|As the European season began, {{new cars}} were {{launched}} as organisers {{were due to}} start enforcing new regulations for 1976 having allowed an easing in period over the first three races. There was a big talking point as the Tyrrell team entered a new P34 six-wheeler for Patrick Depailler. Depailler was on the pace and qualified third, behind Hunt and Lauda. Lauda, driving with broken ribs after an accident driving a tractor once again beat Hunt off {{the line at the}} start and led for the first third of the race. Depailler, after a slow start, was running fourth behind Mass when he spun off and crashed with brake problems. Just before mid-race, the McLarens of Hunt and Mass found another gear and <b>drove</b> <b>past</b> Lauda, but {{towards the end of the}} race, Mass had to retire with an engine failure. Hunt took his first win of the season, with Lauda second and Gunnar Nilsson's Lotus third.|$|E
60|$|The {{talk that}} {{followed}} was quick and abbreviated to terms of understanding between {{two men who}} knew. Grass was the subject. Mention {{was made of the}} winter rainfall and of the chance for late spring rains to come. Names occurred, such as the Little Coyote and Los Cuatos creeks, the Yolo and the Miramar hills, the Big Basin, Round Valley, and the San Anselmo and Los Banos ranges. Movements of herds and <b>droves,</b> <b>past,</b> present, and to come, were discussed, as well as the outlook for cultivated hay in far upland pastures and the estimates of such hay that still remained over the winter in remote barns in the sheltered mountain valleys where herds had wintered and been fed.|$|R
50|$|By 1825, the Meiteis had repulsed the Burmese and <b>drove</b> them <b>past</b> the Chindwin river. The {{occupation}} led {{to frequent}} contacts between the Burmese and the British {{and finally to}} the First Burmese war and the Treaty of Yandaboo in 1826. This treaty {{marked the end of}} Burmese rule and the beginning of British rule in Assam.|$|R
6000|$|We {{left the}} Old Town on our right hand, and <b>drove</b> on, <b>past</b> a little colony of {{suburban}} villas, {{to a house}} standing by itself, surrounded by a stone wall.

25|$|The 1980 parade, {{held at the}} National Stadium, almost rained at the start, but the {{performances}} went on as planned as the weather improved later. This was the first parade in which the feu de joie of the Guard-of-Honour contingents made its inaugural appearance. 1981's NDP was the very first parade appearance of the then SPF Civil Defense Command, presently the Singapore Civil Defense Force, later combined with the SFS in 1989. (The SCDF of today showed itself {{for the first time}} in the 1982 NDP held in the Padang.) They were held in two decentralised venues, Jurong and Queenstown Sports Stadiums for further increase public attendance and participation in the celebrations. 1982's parade, back at the Padang site, featured more contingents and for the first time the mobile column <b>drove</b> <b>past</b> after the marchpast had concluded, thus making it a predecessor to the parades at the Padang from 1995 onward (every 5 years).|$|E
25|$|On Sunday, May 2, 2004, Hatuel {{picked up}} her three oldest daughters from school and drove with them and their 2-year-old sister in the family station wagon towards her husband's {{workplace}} in Ashkelon to campaign against Israel's unilateral disengagement plan. Likud party members were voting that day in a legally non-binding, advisory referendum being conducted across Israel and in Jewish settlements in the Palestinian territories on Ariel Sharon's disengagement proposal. While traveling {{in the vicinity of}} the Kissufim Crossing at 12:40 pm, two armed Palestinian militants, who had prepared an ambush near the highway, opened fire at the car, causing the car to spin off the road. The attackers, who were armed with automatic rifles, then approached the vehicle and fired their weapons from close range at Hatuel and her daughters repeatedly. The gunmen also opened fire on an Israeli civilian from Ohad in southern Israel traveling in a separate car. He managed to reverse and drive away injured. A CNN film crew working near Gush Katif who had come under fire by the militants earlier had attempted to warn and stop Israeli civilian vehicles leaving Gush Katif, among them Hatuel and her four daughters who <b>drove</b> <b>past</b> the armored CNN car.|$|E
500|$|Although {{the loss}} limited Monk as a performer, he {{recorded}} several albums of original music and received much {{attention from the}} press, which led Colomby to argue to the SLA that he was [...] "a drug-free, law-abiding citizen, whose productivity and growing popularity as a recording artist demonstrates his standing as a responsible working musician". In May 1957, the SLA said Monk needed to get a club owner to hire him first, so Colomby considered the Five Spot Café: [...] "I {{wanted to find a}} place that was small. I once <b>drove</b> <b>past</b> this place in the Village and there was a bar and I heard music ... A place where poets hung out." [...] Joe Termini, who co-owned the venue with his brother Iggy, testified at Monk's police hearing, which resulted in his card being reinstated.|$|E
50|$|The DS's beloved {{place in}} French society was {{demonstrated}} in Paris on 9 October 2005 with {{a celebration of}} the 50th anniversary of its launch. 1,600 DS cars <b>drove</b> in procession <b>past</b> the Arc de Triomphe.|$|R

5000|$|It {{would be}} many months before Army {{investigators}} learned a final horrific detail: Most of the interrogators had believed Mr. Dilawar was {{an innocent man}} who simply <b>drove</b> his taxi <b>past</b> the American base at the wrong time.|$|R
500|$|In the town, {{the tanks}} of the 4th CLY Regimental Headquarters tried to escape, but their reverse speed was [...] "painfully slow" [...] and one tank fired two shots before being {{destroyed}} by the Tiger. Two tanks reversed off the road into gardens, the 4th CLY Adjutant Captain Pat Dyas parked behind a barn; the Tiger <b>drove</b> <b>past</b> a wrecked Stuart towards the centre of town, knocking out another tank but missed Dyas. Lieutenant Charles Pearce took his scout car and warned {{the rest of the}} reconnaissance troop in the town centre and Pearce continued westwards to alert B Squadron of the 4th CLY. Wittmann knocked out another Cromwell and [...] on the main street, destroyed two artillery observation post (OP) tanks of the 5th RHA, the intelligence officer's scout car and the medical officer's half-track.|$|E
500|$|Despite these problems, {{from late}} October 1974 his {{demeanour}} appeared {{to change for}} the better. His best man, John Wilbraham, remarked that Lucan's apparent obsession over regaining his children had diminished. While having dinner with his mother he cast aside talk of his family problems and turned instead to politics. On 6November he met his uncle John Bevan, apparently in good spirits. Later that day he met 21-year-old Charlotte Andrina Colquhoun, who said that [...] "he seemed very happy, just his usual self, {{and there was nothing}} to suggest that he was worried or depressed". He also dined at the Clermont with racing driver Graham Hill. At the time, casinos could open only between 2:00pm and 4:00am, so Lucan often gambled into {{the early hours of the}} morning. He took tablets to deal with his insomnia and therefore usually awoke around lunchtime. On 7November though, he broke routine and called his solicitor early that morning, and at 10:30am took a call from Colquhoun. They arranged to eat at the Clermont at about 3:00pm, but Lucan failed to appear. Colquhoun <b>drove</b> <b>past</b> the Clermont and Ladbroke clubs, and past Elizabeth Street, but could not find his car anywhere. Lucan also failed to arrive for his 1:00pm lunch appointment with artist Dominic Elwes and banker Daniel Meinertzhagen, again at the Clermont.|$|E
500|$|Once {{the album}} was complete, work began on its cover. Hipgnosis, {{designer}} of the band's previous album covers, offered three ideas, {{one of which was}} a small child entering his parents' bedroom to find them having sex: [...] "copulating, like animals!" [...] The final concept was, unusually, designed by Waters. At the time he lived near Clapham Common, and regularly <b>drove</b> <b>past</b> Battersea Power Station, which was by then approaching the end of its useful life. A view of the building was chosen for the cover image, and the band commissioned German company Ballon Fabrik (who had previously constructed Zeppelin airships) and Australian artist Jeffrey Shaw to build a [...] porcine balloon (known as Algie). The balloon was inflated with helium and maneuvered into position on 2December 1976, with a marksman ready to fire if it escaped. Inclement weather delayed work, and the band's manager Steve O'Rourke neglected to book the marksman for a second day; the balloon broke free of its moorings and disappeared from view. The pig flew over Heathrow, resulting in panic and cancelled flights; pilots also spotted the pig in the air. It eventually landed in Kent and was recovered by a local farmer, who was apparently furious that it had scared his cows. The balloon was recovered and filming continued for a third day, but as the early photographs of the power station were considered better, the image of the pig was later superimposed onto one of those.|$|E
50|$|After {{defeat in}} 1956, Ring {{set out to}} atone by giving a masterful display against Leinster in the 1957 Railway Cup final. His tally of 3-5 was enough to beat the eastern {{province}} on his own. His first goal came after he grabbed the sliotar some 40 yards out and <b>drove</b> it <b>past</b> Art Foley. His second was a ground snap shot, while his third goal was a cut which he took on the turn after Foley lost the sliotar. The 5-7 to 2-5 victory gave Ring his thirteenth Railway Cup medal.|$|R
50|$|Lyons {{was still}} {{regarded}} as the best full-back in the province in 1957 {{and was on the}} starting fifteen once again. Christy Ring's tally of 3-5 was enough to beat the eastern province on his own. His first goal came after he grabbed the sliotar some 40 yards out and <b>drove</b> it <b>past</b> Art Foley. His second was a ground snap shot, while his third goal was a cut which he took on the turn after Foley lost the sliotar. The 5-7 to 2-5 victory gave Lyons his second Railway Cup medal.|$|R
5000|$|Around 9 October 2003 Adnan Darwiche told Taleb that he {{had learned}} where Gehad and Ziad Razzak were staying. According to Taleb, he {{accompanied}} Adnan Darwiche on a drive past the house. A man later given the pseudonym [...] "Mr W" [...] testified that Osman <b>drove</b> him <b>past</b> the house, saying [...] "Just drive past, I don't want the Razzaks to recognise the car or me. That's not {{the way they are}} going to do it. I am going to be in the hotty waiting for them on Roberts Road. Eddie, Fidel and Erdt are going to run down, they are soldiers." ...|$|R
500|$|In September 2009, he {{appealed to}} party activists for £150,000 of extra {{funding for the}} BNP. In the letter, {{he said that the}} party's ailing {{fortunes}} were a direct result of [...] "attacks on the party". He also defended questions by the Electoral Commission about the transparency of BNP funding. In November 2009, Griffin was a witness at the trial of an Asian man, Tauriq Khalid, at Preston Crown Court. The prosecution claimed that in November 2008 Khalid repeatedly <b>drove</b> <b>past</b> a demonstration that Griffin was attending, and on the second occasion shouted [...] "white bastards". Khalid admitted shouting derisory comments at Griffin and other demonstrators, telling the jury he shouted [...] "Nick Griffin, you fucking wanker" [...] and [...] "Get the fuck out of Burnley, you're not welcome here", but denied shouting [...] "white bastard". Griffin gave evidence against Khalid, and affirmed that Khalid had shouted [...] "white bastard" [...] at him. Griffin said the man [...] "leaned {{out of the car and}} pointed at me and made a gun and gang gesture", and that he threatened him by shouting [...] "I'm going to...". Griffin said he had left the demonstration early, fearing for his safety. The 23-year-old defendant denied his comments had any racial intent, and was found not guilty. Griffin later commented [...] "I think it's unfortunate and I think it's wrong, but that's the jury's right. They saw all the evidence, I accept their decision. I'm not going to lose any sleep over it." ...|$|E

60|$|In {{another few}} minutes Colonel Barrington {{took up the}} reins, and as they <b>drove</b> slowly <b>past</b> the wheat his niece had another view of the toiling teams. They were moving on tirelessly with their leader in front of them, and the rasp of the knives, trample of hoofs, and clash of the binders' wooden arms once more stirred her. She had heard those sounds often before, and {{attached}} no significance to them; but now she knew {{a little of the}} stress and effort that preceded them; she could hear through the turmoil the exultant note of victory.|$|R
6000|$|... "The leader {{stopped and}} growled, {{at the edge}} of an open crack. His {{instinct}} warned him of danger, but I knew I could not get up the rough bank with my lame foot, and <b>drove</b> him <b>past.</b> As I limped by his side with the whip, I thought I heard the current gurgle under the ice, but we went on, the dogs snuffing and treading cautiously. Then there was a soft thud and a splash, the team was jerked back and I saw that the sledge had vanished. I suppose it had broken through a snow-bridge that our weight had shaken.|$|R
50|$|In February 1993, a man <b>drove</b> his car <b>past</b> a {{checkpoint}} at the TMI nuclear plant, then broke through an entry gate.
