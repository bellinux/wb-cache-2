5|$|In western societies, {{voluntary}} {{blood donation}} is a common, yet less extreme, form of risk taking. Costs {{associated with these}} donations include pain and risk of infection. If blood donation <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> send costly signals, then donors will be perceived by others as generous and physically healthy. In a survey, both donors and non-donors expressed perceptions of the health, generosity, and ability of blood donors to operate in stressful situations.|$|E

Reindeer meat is an important staple in most households, and the populace waits with great anticipation for the autumn hunting season to begin.

25|$|Dancers {{at social}} events {{usually have a}} wide range of skill levels, so {{cooperating}} with one's partner matters as much as dancing skill. Dancing with a new partner is a study in flexibility and calibration. What can the new partner do? What are his or her limitations? What does he or she like to do? Dancing with a regular partner <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> play and practice difficult moves, such as aerials (which are dangerous without regular practice).|$|E
25|$|At first, {{observers}} of Kwanzaa avoided {{the mixing of}} the holiday or its symbols, values, and practice with other holidays, as doing so would violate the principle of kujichagulia (self-determination) and thus violate {{the integrity of the}} holiday, which is partially intended as a reclamation of important African values. Today, many African American families celebrate Kwanzaa along with Christmas and New Year's. Frequently, both Christmas trees and kinaras, the traditional candle holder symbolic of African American roots, share space in Kwanzaa-celebrating households. For people who celebrate both holidays, Kwanzaa <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> incorporate elements of their particular ethnic heritage into holiday observances and celebrations of Christmas.|$|E
25|$|The story often {{provides}} much of {{the entertainment}} in the game. Because these games have strong storylines, they can often make effective use of recorded dialog and voiceover narration. Players of these games tend to appreciate long cutscenes more than players of faster action games. While most games advance the plot when the player defeats an enemy or completes a level, role-playing games often progress the plot based on other important decisions. For example, a player may {{make the decision to}} join a guild, thus triggering a progression in the storyline that is usually irreversible. New elements in the story may also be triggered by mere arrival in an area, rather than completing a specific challenge. The plot is usually divided so that each game location <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> reveal a new chapter in the story.|$|E

25|$|This {{election}} {{is the last}} election - presidential, local and general - scheduled in Turkey until 2019. Arguments as to whether this is by chance, {{or whether it was}} planned by the Justice and Development Party (AKP) government when they proposed to reduce the parliamentary terms from five years to four in the 2007 constitutional referendum, are still ongoing. Speculation as to what the AKP government will do during four years of electorally unchecked power should they win generated both favourable predictions and concerns. While four years without elections may allow the government to undertake widespread necessary economic reforms, critics of the AKP argue that it <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> further erode the diminishing checks and balances and separation of powers in the Turkish political and legal systems. The AKP also support a presidential system, which would give greater powers to President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.|$|E
25|$|Addressing is {{generally}} done by hand, and <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> demonstrate one's handwriting (see shodō). The postcards may have spaces for the sender {{to write a}} personal message. Blank cards are available, so people can hand-write or draw their own. Rubber stamps with conventional messages and with the annual animal are on sale at department stores and other outlets, and many people buy ink brushes for personal greetings. Special printing devices are popular, especially among people who practice crafts. Software also lets artists create their own designs and output them using their computer's color printer. Because a gregarious individual might have hundreds to write, print shops offer {{a wide variety of}} sample postcards with short messages so that the sender has only to write addresses. Even with the rise in popularity of email, the nengajō remains very popular in Japan, although the younger generation hardly send any cards, preferring to exchange digital greetings using their mobile phones. In recent years this digital greeting preference is gradually accepted among the society.|$|E

Visitors to the Jet Propulsion Laboratory's website were invited to submit their name between May 2003 and January 2004, and the names gathered—some 625,000 in all—were then burnt onto a mini-CD, which was {{attached}} to the impactor. Dr. Don Yeomans, a member of the spacecraft's scientific team, stated [...] "this <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> become part of an extraordinary space mission... when the craft is launched in December 2004, yours and the names of your loved-ones can hitch along for the ride and be part of what may be the best space fireworks show in history."

500|$|On {{the same}} day the letter was written, the three party leaders held a joint press conference at which they {{expressed}} their intent to co-operate on changing parliamentary rules, and to request that the Governor General consult with them before deciding to call an election. At the news conference, Harper said [...] "It is the Parliament that's supposed to run the country, not just the largest party and the single leader of that party. That's a criticism I've had and that we've had and that most Canadians have had for a long, long time now so this <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> start to change that." [...] However, at the time, Harper and the two other opposition leaders denied trying to form a coalition government.

I didn't tear something in my knee, but I strained it. Knees are very sensitive, I've learned. It's crazy, because I've been dancing since I was three on my toes and all these things. And you should never say this, but I've never injured myself ever. I'd seen gnarly injuries with dance and all these things. You shouldn't say that, though, because every day <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> fall, hurt yourself, so that was my experience." ...|$|E
500|$|Schwimmer {{starred in}} his first leading film role in the 1996 romantic comedy film, The Pallbearer with Gwyneth Paltrow. In the film, Schwimmer plays a man asked to deliver the eulogy for a high school friend he cannot remember, and begins an affair with the friend's mother. Critics {{dismissed}} The Pallbearer as a poor imitation of the 1967 film The Graduate. Varietys film reviewer complimented the actor, writing that he had enjoyed his performance, stating that he displayed [...] "a winning, if rather deadpan, personality along with good comic timing". It also concluded that Schwimmer had a [...] "promising bigscreen future". Janet Maslin of The New York Times cited that his first film [...] "relegates him to a drab role". When asked why he decided to accept the role, Schwimmer admitted the decision was to [...] "make {{an effort to find}} roles that are as far away from the character of Ross as possible". He was offered a role to star alongside Tommy Lee Jones in the 1997 science-fiction comedy Men in Black, but turned it down in favor of starring in The Pallbearer, explaining, [...] "This <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> grow rather than go for the quick cash".|$|E
