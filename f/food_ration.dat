Similar to the aftermath of other natural disasters, the distribution of the aid raised concerns and accusations over the amount of food and material, or lack thereof, for the affected citizens.

40|$|Phenotypic {{flexibility}} {{is critical in}} determining fitness. As conditions change during ontogeny, continued responsiveness is necessary {{to meet the demands}} of the environment. Studies have shown that subsequent ontogenetic periods of development can interact with one another and shape developmental outcomes. The role genetic variation within populations plays in shaping these outcomes remains unclear. Four full-sub families of zebrafish Danio rerio were raised under for dietary regimes: high <b>food</b> <b>rations</b> for 60 days (HH), low <b>food</b> <b>rations</b> for 60 days (LL), high <b>food</b> <b>rations</b> for 30 days followed by low <b>food</b> <b>rations</b> for 30 (HL), and low <b>food</b> <b>rations</b> for 30 days followed by high <b>food</b> <b>rations</b> for 30 (LH). While diet significantly altered size at 30 days (high vs. low <b>food</b> <b>rations),</b> subsequent dietary change resulted equal sizes across all four feeding treatments. Swimming performance showed variation due to interactions between dietary treatments. Furthermore, there was significant family level variation in the manner in which swimming performance responded to fluctuating dietary conditions. These results suggest that plastic responsiveness to subsequent environmental changes can be trait specific and vary significantly within populations...|$|R

Two nights after their arrival in Tomsk a disturbance broke out, as they demanded drinking water, which was put down by mounted troops.|$|E
25|$|Under-reporting {{of deaths}} {{was also a}} problem. The death {{registration}} system, which was inadequate before the famine, was completely overwhelmed by {{the large number of}} deaths during the famine. In addition, many deaths went unreported so that family members of the deceased could continue to draw the deceased's <b>food</b> <b>ration.</b> Counting the number of children who both were born and died between the 1953 and 1964 censuses is problematic. However, Ashton, et al. believe that because the reported number of births during the GLF seems accurate, the reported number of deaths should be accurate as well. Massive internal migration made both population counts and registering deaths problematic, though Yang believes the degree of unofficial internal migration was small and Cao's estimate takes internal migration into account.|$|E

25|$|During {{the siege}} of 1941 – 1944, the only ways to supply the city and suburbs, {{inhabited}} by several millions, were by aircraft or by cars crossing the frozen Lake Ladoga. The German military systematically shelled this route, called the Road of Life, so thousands of cars with people and food supplies had sank in the lake. The situation in the city was especially horrible {{in the winter of}} 1941 – 1942. The German bombing raids destroyed most of the food reserves. Daily <b>food</b> <b>ration</b> was cut in October to 400grams of bread for a worker and 200grams for a woman or child. On 20 November 1941, the rations were reduced to 250 and 125grams respectively. Those grams of bread were the bulk of a daily meal for a person in the city. The water supply was destroyed. The situation further worsened in winter due to lack of heating fuel. In December 1941 alone some 53,000 people in Leningrad died of starvation, many corpses were scattered in the streets all over the city.|$|E
25|$|Food was {{prepared}} by cooks {{drawn from the}} prison ranks. The cooks, one for every 12 prisoners, were paid a small allowance by the British government. The initial daily <b>food</b> <b>ration</b> for each prisoner was 1lb of beef, 1lb of bread, 1lb of potatoes, and 1lb of cabbage or pease. As the majority of prisoners were Roman Catholic, herrings or cod was substituted for beef on Fridays. Each prisoner was also allowed 2oz of soap per week. In November 1797 the British and French governments agreed that each should feed their own citizens in their enemy's prisons. The French provided a daily ration of 1 pint of beer, 8oz of beef or fish, 26oz of bread, 2oz of cheese and 1lb of potato or fresh vegetables. They were also allowed 1lb of soap and 1lb of tobacco per month. Patients in the prison hospital were given a daily ration of 1 pint of tea morning and evening, 16oz of bread, 16oz of beef, mutton or fish, 1 pint of broth, 16oz of green vegetables or potato, and 2 pints of beer.|$|E
500|$|On 8 December 2014, the {{military}} approved the phased repatriation of the IDPs. The Pakistani army chief said the early {{return of the}} IDPs was his top priority. According to senior military officials, civilian authorities were directed to plan {{the return of the}} IDPs to their homes in areas which have been cleared of terrorists. On 31 March 2015, the repatriation started. On the first day, 219 IDPs belonging to 62 families left Bannu for Spinwam and Shahmeri in North Waziristan. In the first phase till 24 April, about 1,200 families were {{to return to their homes}} in Sinwam, Shamiri, Mirali and Bubali areas of NWA. Each family was given [...] as cash assistance and [...] as transportation expenses at Mirzail. <b>Food</b> <b>ration</b> for six months and non-food items would also be given to each household. For effective disease control, children under five years of age were administered anti-polio vaccines and under 10 years of age were administered anti-measles vaccines. As of 4 May 2015, only 230 displaced families had returned since the launch of the repatriation programme. [...] "The civil administration can send entire displaced population back to their homes within a month if the area is de-notified as conflict zone," [...] said an official dealing with IDPs repatriation. According to the official sources, the cut-off date for the return of IDPs was December 2016.|$|E

500|$|As {{a result}} of the 1970 worker {{rebellion}} food prices remained frozen and were artificially low. The demand for food products exceeded the supply also because of the higher real wages, which already {{in the first two years}} of Gierek's government increased more than during the entire decade of the 1960s. In June 1976, in an attempt to reduce consumption, the government introduced a long-announced and several times delayed, but radical price increase: basic foodstuffs had their prices raised by an average of 60%, three times the rate of Gomułka'a increases from six years before. The associated wage rises were skewed toward the better-off part of the population. The result was an immediate nationwide wave of strikes, with violent demonstrations, looting and labor unrest at the Ursus Factory near Warsaw, in Radom, Płock and other places. The government quickly backed down and repealed the price rises, but the strike leaders were arrested and put on trial. A series of [...] "spontaneous" [...] large scale public gatherings, intended to convey the [...] "anger of the people" [...] at the [...] "trouble-makers" [...] was staged by the party leadership in a number of cities, but the Soviet pressure prevented further attempts at raising prices. Gierek's cordial in the past relations with Leonid Brezhnev were now seriously damaged. <b>Food</b> <b>ration</b> cards, introduced because of the destabilized market in August 1976, were to remain a feature of life in Poland for the duration of the People's Republic. The regime's retreat, having occurred for the second time in several years, amounted to an unprecedented defeat. Within the rigid political system, the government was neither able to reform (it would lose control and power), nor to satisfy society's staple needs, because it had to sell abroad all it could to make foreign debt and interests payments. This quandary, combined with the daily reality of the lack of necessities, facilitated the consolidation of organized opposition.|$|E
