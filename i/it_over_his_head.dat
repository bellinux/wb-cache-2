5|$|Late in the 1999–2000 season, Niedermayer was {{involved}} in a violent incident with Peter Worell of the Florida Panthers. After being elbowed by Worell, Niedermayer responded by swinging his stick at his opponents head. Worell suffered a concussion and missed six games, while Niedermayer was suspended for ten games – nine in the regular season, and New Jersey's first playoff game. After returning from his ban, Niedermayer's steady defensive contributions in the playoffs helped the Devils win their second Stanley Cup by defeating the Dallas Stars in six games in the 2000 Stanley Cup Final. While celebrating his day with the Cup, Niedermayer took the trophy to Fisher Peak, overlooking his hometown of Cranbrook and was famously pictured hoisting <b>it</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>head.</b>|$|E
25|$|The next {{match was}} the {{encounter}} of Jerry Lawler and Tazz. The match began as Tazz gained the advantage, but Lawler retaliated by delivering a piledriver on Tazz. As Tazz recuperated, he applied the Tazzmission on Lawler; in desperation, Jim Ross, the commentating partner of Lawler, hit Tazz {{with a glass}} jar, breaking <b>it</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> and allowing Lawler to pin Tazz for the win.|$|E
25|$|Ambrose's acrobatic {{saxophone}} playing, {{along with}} Lytle on the double bass – literally on it, riding {{it like a}} pony, and holding <b>it</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> –were highlights of the band's live performances during this time. Their music and their act {{were part of a}} tradition in jazz and rhythm and blues, but it all came like a thunderclap to most of their audience. In late 1954, Haley and His Comets appeared in a short subject entitled Round Up of Rhythm, performing three songs. This was the earliest known theatrical rock and roll film release.|$|E
60|$|The toast was drunk. Then Clarke {{refilled}} his cup {{and holding}} <b>it</b> high <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> {{he looked at}} Betty.|$|R
60|$|Mr Riderhood next demands his shirt; {{and draws}} <b>it</b> on <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> (with <b>his</b> daughter's help) exactly {{as if he}} had just had a Fight.|$|R
60|$|Then he {{snatched}} the cloak from him, and, wrapping <b>it</b> quickly <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> and shoulders, he called wildly to his guard and fled incontinently from the spot.|$|R
500|$|The 12th Man Towel {{was created}} in the fall of 1985 by Rusty Riley and Kyle Harris, then {{president}} {{and vice president of the}} 12th Man Student Aggie Club, respectively, with the help of Gary Leach and Larry Leach, then club secretary and treasurer. The concept was presented to the Aggie Club faculty managers Harry Green Jr., executive director of the 12th Man Foundation, and Jackie Sherrill, Texas A University athletic director and head football coach. Once their approval was given, Rusty and Kyle found a manufacturer in New York City through a local distributor in Bryan, Texas, and authorization was given to sell the towels on campus by school management and Chic Sell, who had the concession rights in Kyle Field. [...] The first 1,000 towels were purchased and delivered in time for the first home game of the 1985 college football season. Kyle and Rusty, along with a handful of Aggie Club members, sold the towels for $2 each in makeshift booths at strategic locations within Kyle Field. It was an immediate success, with all towels being sold at the first game. [...] The A Yell Leaders initially resisted the towels, claiming the Aggie Club was breaking tradition, but the Battalion staff supported the concept and began a successful selling and media campaign to help the towel gain acceptance throughout the A student body. Rusty worked with the Head Yell Leader on accepting the towel and once the Yell Leaders accepted it, a press conference was held with Rusty, Coach Sherrill, and the Head Yell Leader. [...] As the football season carried on, the 12th Man Towel continued selling in large quantities. The Aggie Club hired students to sell the towels at the MSC and on Aggie Club property, which at the time was located right outside of the main entrance to Kyle Field. The towel also gained an important supporting cast when Coach Sherrill's 12th man kick-off team squad began carrying them to motivate the student body in the stands. The 1985 regular college football season ended with a home game versus the Texas Longhorns. At that game, a sea of white 12th Man Towels filled the stadium, cheering the Aggies to a 42-10 victory. The Aggies went on to win the Southwest Conference Title and defeat Auburn in the Cotton Bowl on January 1, 1986, with the 12th Man Towels proudly displayed to a national audience. Tony Pollacia (15), a member of the 12th man squad, and his towel-waving antics became legendary. When Texas A won its first Cotton Bowl under Coach Jackie Sherrill in 1986, the Dallas Morning News chose to run his photograph, in color, on the front page of its Sunday paper. During the 1988 Cotton Bowl Classic, which A played against Notre Dame, another towel was a point of contention. [...] Twice during that game, Warren Barhorst, a member of Sherrill's 12th Man Kickoff Team, tackled Heisman Trophy winner Tim Brown, and then grabbed Brown's towel and waved <b>it</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>head.</b> [...] An infuriated Brown tackled Barhorst, earning himself a 15-yard unsportsman-like conduct penalty.|$|E
2500|$|Maccabi Tel Aviv went on {{to defeat}} Mobilgirgi Varese by one point, 78–77, in the European Cup finals. [...] Brody, as the team captain, {{received}} the European Cup from FIBA's Secretary General, and lifted <b>it</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>head.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The Pigeon Detectives's {{performance}} was also memorable as frontman Matt Bowman informed {{the crowd that}} he was too clean and then asked if anyone in the audience had any mud or muddy trainers that they could throw at him. This request was readily carried out by the crowd. Bowman himself then proceeded to pick up an armful of mud from the stage and rubbed <b>it</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>head.</b> Later he ran down to the crowd, inviting fans to rub his hair, whilst {{at the end of their}} popular single [...] "I'm Not Sorry", he jumped off the stage into the crowd. This performance left Stage 2/NME noticeably caked in mud for the rest of the festival.|$|E
60|$|A snake {{tried to}} shed his skin by pulling <b>it</b> off <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> but, {{being unable to}} do so, was advised by a woodman to slip out {{of it in the}} usual way.|$|R
50|$|The spacesuits {{in these}} {{drawings}} differ much, but all depict the helmet base as being {{wide enough for}} the wearer to get <b>it</b> on <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> showing that their artists had {{paid little attention to}} the writer's detailed descriptions.|$|R
5000|$|If {{a wrestler}} is a current champion, he {{will attempt to}} {{visually}} draw attention to his championship belt by either holding <b>it</b> high <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> or (if the belt is worn around the waist) moving his hands across it or pointing to it.|$|R
60|$|Mart {{caught up}} a chair, and raising <b>it</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> brought {{it down on}} Porler’s back.|$|E
60|$|Quintal {{could not}} stand this in his roused condition. Leaping up, he sprang towards Timoa, {{snatched}} the flute from his hand, broke <b>it</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> and kicked {{him out of the}} hut.|$|E
60|$|He put {{his hand}} down to his waist and felt for the lariat. It was still there, and he brought it up and swung <b>it</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> to free it from the quicksand.|$|E
60|$|Bladud {{grasped the}} stone and hurled <b>it</b> back <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> with all <b>his</b> force. Up and up it went {{as if it had}} {{resolved}} to become an aerolite and visit the moon! Then down it came with a mighty thud ten yards beyond Gunrig's mark.|$|R
5000|$|Giant Dumbbell Press — Single-handed {{dumbbells}} are hoisted {{from the}} ground onto the competitor's shoulder, from where, with one hand, he must raise <b>it</b> vertically <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> and lockout <b>his</b> arm. With four weights between 100 and 115 kg, scoring is based on time and number of successful lifts.|$|R
60|$|The stage peasant {{is fond of}} drinking, {{and when}} he drinks he likes {{to let you know}} he is drinking. None of your quiet half-pint inside the bar for him. He likes to come out in the street and sing about it and do tricks with it, such as turning <b>it</b> topsy-turvy <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>head.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... 'Mark ye {{the long}} thin man behind him?' cried Reuben. 'He hath drawn his sword, and waves <b>it</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>head.</b> 'Tis a strange {{time and place}} for the broadsword exercise. He is surely mad.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What!" [...] {{cried the}} Prince, [...] "where is it? Where is her cave? I will go {{instantly}} and rescue my beloved Princess!" [...] and {{he drew his}} sword of adamant and waved <b>it</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>head.</b>|$|E
60|$|The cowboy, {{riding a}} little behind the two others, had unlimbered his lariat, and, while they watched, swung <b>it</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> and secured the runaway. Quest galloped {{up to where}} Laura and the Professor were waving frantically.|$|E
6000|$|... "Come now, Buckskin," [...] said Roy, soothingly, and {{he slowly}} {{approached}} the quivering animal. He went closer, hand over hand, on the lasso. Buckskin showed {{the whites of}} his eyes and also his white teeth. But he stood while Roy loosened the loop and, slipping <b>it</b> down <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> fastened <b>it</b> in a complicated knot round his nose.|$|R
6000|$|... ‘It is a privilege,’ I said. He {{thought a}} while upon the word, turning <b>it</b> <b>over</b> in <b>his</b> Scots <b>head,</b> and then {{answered}} with conviction, ‘Yes, a privilege.’ ...|$|R
60|$|After many failures, he at last {{caught the}} line. This he {{fastened}} to the spar, and signaled to those on shore to pull it in; then, {{side by side with}} the dog, he followed. Looking round behind him, he watched a great breaker rolling in and, as before, dived as <b>it</b> passed <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> and rode forward on the swell towards the shore.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not on your life!" [...] exclaimed Ken. [...] "Not if we're quick. Now {{you roll}} up the sweater so--and stretch {{it on your}} hands--so--and when I lift Kel up you slip <b>it</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>head.</b> It'll be like pie." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, Master, but not easily. Remember, {{it was on}} a chain {{about the}} man's neck, and I could not draw <b>it</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> for, like his hands, his throat was tied by a cord, as you {{remember}} yours was." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thy dagger!--infidel dog!" [...] {{said the}} figure in the goat-skins, [...] "hold it in thy gripe if thou canst!" [...] and in an instant he {{wrenched}} the Saracen's weapon out of its owner's hand, and brandished <b>it</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>head.</b>|$|E
60|$|All was well. The {{match was}} a draw now {{whatever}} happened to him. He hit out, almost at a venture, at the last ball, and mid-off, jumping, just failed to reach <b>it.</b> <b>It</b> hummed <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> and ran like a streak along the turf and up the bank, and a great howl of delight went up from the school as the umpire took off the bails.|$|R
60|$|For a while Mavovo {{sat with}} his eyes shut. Then he opened them, studied the ashes and what {{remained}} of the picture, and taking a blanket that lay near by, threw <b>it</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> own <b>head</b> and <b>over</b> the ashes. Withdrawing it again presently he cast it aside and pointed to the picture which was now quite changed. Indeed, in the moonlight, it looked more like a landscape than anything else.|$|R
6000|$|There was the {{scratching}} of a match upon {{a silver}} box, a feeble flame gradually developing into a sure illumination. Wolfenden carefully lit the lamp and raised <b>it</b> high <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>head.</b> The room was empty! There {{was no doubt}} about it! They two were alone. But the window was wide open and a {{chair in front of}} it had been thrown over. The Admiral strode to the casement and called out angrily-- ...|$|R
60|$|So {{thinking}} {{that this was an}} occasion on which I might properly do so, for the first time I took off the talisman which I had worn for so long, and Umslopogaas put <b>it</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> and hid it beneath his blanket.|$|E
60|$|Anxious to {{obey the}} command {{of the man who}} held him {{completely}} under his thumb, Casey ran forward. Seeing him coming, Jerry fled behind a large screen. Here rested a heavy cane, and he picked it up and brandished <b>it</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>head.</b>|$|E
60|$|Thumbelina trembled, {{she was so}} frightened; for {{the bird}} was very large in {{comparison}} with herself--only an inch high. But she took courage, piled up the down more closely over the poor swallow, fetched her own coverlid and laid <b>it</b> <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>head.</b>|$|E
50|$|On December 19, 2003 Jarod Bennett was {{attending}} an after school YMCA program at Louisa Wright elementary school. Jarod {{was hit by}} a 290 lbs. cafeteria table when <b>it</b> tipped <b>over</b> onto <b>his</b> <b>head.</b> Jarod died minutes later in his mother's arms.|$|R
60|$|Without a cry, Bill's {{grasp on}} the oar loosened; he fell <b>over</b> <b>it</b> limply, <b>his</b> <b>head</b> {{striking}} the almost submerged log. A dark-red fluid colored the water; then <b>his</b> body slipped <b>over</b> the oar {{and into the}} river, where it sank.|$|R
500|$|In the episode, {{after the}} {{creation}} of the Bear Patrol, bear sightings decrease to zero, so Homer concludes that the Bear Patrol must be working. Lisa attempts to demonstrate Homer's logical fallacy by the example of a tiger-repellent rock, but <b>it</b> goes <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>head.</b> Scott Anthony of the Harvard Business Review describes this scene as a [...] "classic example" [...] of the informal fallacy of assuming that correlation implies causation. Mike Moffatt also called it [...] "the best all-time discussion of faulty reasoning".|$|R
