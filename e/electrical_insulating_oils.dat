40|$|Recent {{years have}} {{witnessed}} {{a relatively large}} number of power transformer and shunt reactor failures, which were attributed {{to the presence of}} corrosive sulfur compounds in the insulating oils and their attending reactions with copper to form electrically conductive copper sulphides. The associated problems appeared to be initially resolved by the addition to the insulating oil small amounts of a metal deactivator (more commonly called passivator), a derivative of 1, 2, 3 benzotriazole (BTA). However, over the past four years, additional problems arose that were principally associated with the evolution of gases from the <b>electrical</b> <b>insulating</b> <b>oils,</b> containing the metal deactivator. These observations, recorded in the field as well as reproduced in laboratories, are examined in this paper...|$|E
40|$|Electrical {{insulating}} {{mineral oils}} are mainly manufactured from naphthenic crude sources, {{with a small}} number being produced from paraffinic crudes and gas-to-liquids technology. The resulting products are most frequently free of additives, except for certain types of phenol-based oxidation inhibitors, and of a very low percentage by weight, only up to 0. 4 %. The main specifications for <b>electrical</b> <b>insulating</b> <b>oils,</b> Doble TOPS, ASTM D 3487 and IEC 60296, only allow oxidation inhibitors and any other additives must be agreed upon by the entities involved in the selling and purchasing of the product. Over the years, other additives have been used, sometimes unbeknownst to the purchaser, some of which include pour point depressants, gassing tendency additives, other types of oxidation inhibitors, passivators and metal deactivators. This paper discusses the uses of passivators and how they work in transformer systems. Presently, passivators {{are being used to}} control issues with corrosive sulfur but they have also been used to control oxidation stability of the oil and streaming (static) electrification. This paper will focus mainly on the use of passivators to control corrosive sulfur...|$|E

40|$|Esters of {{palm kernel}} oil have been {{synthesized}} and characterized for application as <b>electrical</b> <b>insulating</b> <b>oil.</b> Since such fluids serve both as insulants and coolants, tests were performed to characterize the chemical, physical and dielectric properties. Accelerated ageing tests were carried out to mimic conditions in a power transformer. Alkyl esters were synthesized from laboratory purified {{palm kernel oil}}: methyl ester was prepared through a transesterification reaction; an epoxidation reaction involving the methyl ester produced with insitu per-acetic acid {{in the presence of}} a catalyst to produce corresponding epoxy alkyl ester. This was then reacted with acid anhydrides under nitrogen in the presence of catalyst. This opened the epoxy rings of the epoxy alkyl oleate and linoleate components to attach side hydrocarbon chains. The characteristics and composition of the products were monitored using GC-MS and FTIR spectroscopy. The synthesized ester possessed a flash point that satisfied the specified minimum flash point for mineral oil, higher thermo-oxidative stability, and high and reliable breakdown strength from the distribution of breakdown data (43 kV/mm). It has a melting point of about - 7 ˚C which is higher than mineral oil. An ester-paper sample which was aged in a pressure vessel under nitrogen and metal catalysts exhibited improved performance compared with the mineral oil-paper system. The rate of decrease in the tensile strength of alkyl ester-paper within the ageing condition was significantly lower than mineral oil-paper. Impregnation of cellulose paper with ester increased the charge storage capacity of the insulating paper. A strong low frequency dielectric dispersion (LFD) was observed which became more pronounced with ageing. Quasi-DC conduction was deduced to have dominated the low frequency response of alkyl ester-paper. The characteristic breakdown strength of the aged paper samples in comparison with the unaged sample did not show any significant difference. It is suggested that the synthesized ester is as good as mineral oil in many ways and a viable alternative fluid for cooling and insulating power transformers.

40|$|Dissolved gas {{analysis}} (DGA) is attracting {{greater and greater}} interest from researchers as a fault diagnostic tool for power transformers filled with vegetable <b>insulating</b> <b>oils.</b> This paper presents experimental results of dissolved gases in <b>insulating</b> <b>oils</b> under typical <b>electrical</b> and thermal faults in transformers. The tests covered three types of <b>insulating</b> <b>oils,</b> including two types of vegetable oil, which are camellia <b>insulating</b> <b>oil,</b> Envirotemp FR 3, and a type of mineral <b>insulating</b> <b>oil,</b> to simulate thermal faults in oils from 90 °C to 800 °C and electrical faults including breakdown and partial discharges in oils. The experimental results reveal that the content and proportion of dissolved gases in different types of <b>insulating</b> <b>oils</b> under the same fault condition are different, especially under thermal faults due to the obvious differences of their chemical compositions. Four different classic diagnosis methods were applied: ratio method, graphic method, and Duval’s triangle and Duval’s pentagon method. These confirmed that the diagnosis methods developed for mineral oil were not fully appropriate for diagnosis of electrical and thermal faults in vegetable <b>insulating</b> <b>oils</b> and needs some modification. Therefore, some modification aiming at different types of vegetable oils based on Duval Triangle 3 were proposed in this paper and obtained a good diagnostic result. Furthermore, gas formation mechanisms {{of different types of}} vegetable <b>insulating</b> <b>oils</b> under thermal stress are interpreted by means of unimolecular pyrolysis simulation and reaction enthalpies calculation...|$|R
40|$|This {{experimental}} study {{was performed to}} obtain thermal energy from the combustion of synthetic gas, produced by the pyrolysis of <b>insulating</b> <b>oil</b> containing polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in a high temperature and high pressure reactor. The average synthetic gas generated was 59. 67 Am 3 /hr via the steady state gasification of <b>insulating</b> <b>oil</b> waste (20 kg/hr) with average concentrations (standard deviation) of CO 2, CO, and H 2 in the synthetic gas of 38. 63 ± 3. 11 %, 35. 18 ± 1. 93 %, and 28. 42 ± 1. 68 %, respectively. The concentrations of the PCBs in the transformer <b>insulating</b> <b>oil</b> and synthetic gas after its gasification, and the concentrations of the dioxins that could be produced from the incomplete degradation of PCBs were measured. It was revealed that the PCBs in the <b>insulating</b> <b>oil</b> were composed of the series from tetrachlorobiphenyl to octachlorobiphenyl. However, only the # 49, # 44, # 52, and # 47 / 75 / 48 congeners were detected from the synthetic gas after gasification of the <b>insulating</b> <b>oil</b> and in the flue gas from the combustor.
