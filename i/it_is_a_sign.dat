5|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> of Edward's {{high regard}} for Lancaster {{that he would}} bestow such {{extensive}} privileges on him. The two men were second cousins through their great-grandfather Henry III and practically coeval (Edward was born in 1312), so it is natural to assume that {{a strong sense of}} camaraderie existed between them. Another factor that might have influenced the king's decision was the fact that Henry had no male heir, so the grant was made for the Earl's lifetime only, and not intended to be hereditary.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Jack's Valentine's dinner {{plans with}} his girlfriend Elisa (Salma Hayek) are {{postponed}} {{when they have to}} attend church. Jack calls his office assistant, Jonathan (Maulik Pancholy), telling him to hold his dinner reservations. Before they can leave church, Elisa tells Jack that they need to go to confession. After horrifying the priest (Zak Orth) with his admissions, Elisa becomes furious with Jack and breaks up with him. Later, however, she laments her fight with Jack. After finding a McFlurry coupon in the collection plate, she believes <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> from God because both she and Jack love the McDonald's dessert. The two reconcile their relationship as a result, and spend Valentine's Day together at a McDonald's.|$|E
25|$|The Scapular of the Holy Trinity is a devotional {{scapular}} {{associated with}} the Confraternity of The Holy Trinity and the Third Order Secular of the Most Holy Trinity. It is a white scapular with a cross of which the transverse shaft is blue and the longitudinal shaft red. It is worn by Tertiaries as well {{as members of the}} Confraternity of the Blessed Trinity (or other Trinitarian associations that make use of the scapular) after investment with this scapular. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> of consecration to the Holy Trinity and of fraternity.|$|E

25|$|It is {{acceptable}} to transfer food to closely related people (e.g. grandparents, parents, spouse, children, or significant others) if they are having difficulty picking up the food. Also <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> of respect to pass food to the elderly first before the dinner starts. Often, family members will transfer a choice piece of food from a dish to a relative's bowl {{as a sign of}} caring. A variation of this is to transfer the food whilst using one's own bowl as a support, underneath the food and chopsticks to keep food from falling or dripping, then transferring from there to a relative's bowl.|$|E
25|$|A similar custom {{is celebrated}} among Orthodox Christians in Serbia on 15 February (2 February {{according}} to the local religious Julian calendar) during the feast of celebration of Sretenje or The Meeting of the Lord (Candlemas). It is believed that the bear will awaken from winter dormancy on this day, and if it sees (meets) its own shadow in this sleepy and confused state, it will get scared {{and go back to}} sleep for an additional 40 days, thus prolonging the winter. Thus, if it is sunny on Sretenje, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> that the winter is not over yet. If it is cloudy, it is a good sign that the winter is about to end.|$|E
25|$|Susan G. Larson et al. {{analyzed}} the upper limb of LB1. They {{found that in}} LB1 the angle of humeral torsion is much less than in modern humans. This had been previously studied by Richards et al., who declared that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> of modern pygmy populations, and T. Jacob et al., who pointed out that muscle attachments on the bone suggest LB1 had weak muscles which resulted in little development of humeral torsion. Larson et al. rejected Richards' conclusion, arguing that the humeral torsion of pygmy populations is usually {{similar to that of}} peoples of average stature. They argued that Richards et al. cited a 1972 paper which had studied a sample of six female Eastern Central African pygmies and this sample was too small to represent the whole population. Larson et al. also failed to find signs of microcephaly on the studied bones.|$|E

25|$|In {{the issues}} of Green Lantern and Green Lantern Corps serving as preludes to the Blackest Night event, the Star Sapphires {{continue}} to make preparations for the predicted conflict. After undergoing treatment within a violet conversion crystal, Fatality emerges as a newly transformed Star Sapphire. Her first thoughts upon being released are to seek out John Stewart (a Green Lantern she'd been trying to kill for causing the destruction of her home planet). Upon finding him, however, she saves him from Agent Orange's attacking Orange Lantern constructs, demonstrating that {{they are unable to}} absorb constructs made from violet light. She admits that revenge is no longer her goal, and that she has other plans. In the following issue, she reveals that she's attracted to Stewart, may have always been, and the Star Sapphire has given her the ability to finally absolve herself of her survivor's guilt. After Fatality's successful conversion, Miri and Queen Aga'po observe that Kryb appears to be crying inside of her crystal (seemingly distraught over being separated from the children she kept imprisoned on her back). Queen Aga'po remarks that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> the treatment is working.|$|E
25|$|The proverb Ngam jam, o yas jam (rain in peace! Sow in peace) is {{the first}} word Serer farmers utter during the first rain. It is also the way the Serers wish each other happy New Year. As well as an expression, it also a {{religious}} prayer. The first rain of the season is a pact between the transcendent power and humanity. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> of life which continues to be transmitted by this tutelary power, which has long respected the pact. Custom dictates that, the first three steps on the damp earth of the first rain to be made barefooted in order to connect with mother nature. The father or {{the mother of the}} family would be given a calabash of the water of the first rain, for the whole family to drink. This water is holy and is viewed as sacred which would protect them from all misfortunes that may occur during the rainy season. Under the Saas tree, containers were placed under it to collect the water that touches the tree. This water was used for bathing as a sign of protection.|$|E
25|$|Pohick Church {{was photographed}} by Frances Benjamin Johnston in 1930 {{as part of}} the Carnegie Survey of the Architecture of the South; it was {{documented}} by the Historic American Buildings Survey in 1941. A historical marker was erected by the state of Virginia commemorating the history of the structure in 1934, and can still be seen today, located just outside the church property itself. Next to <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> placed by the Civil War Trails Program in 2014 and detailing the Civil War-era history of the church and grounds. Also at the site is a marker detailing the history of the old telegraph line, one of the first in the world, which ran nearby and which is today memorialized in the name of Telegraph Road. The church is the centerpiece of a historic overlay district established by Fairfax County in 1970; it was the first such district designated by the county. It was added to the Virginia Landmarks Register in 1968, and to the National Register of Historic Places the following year. Restoration and maintenance of the church property is currently overseen by the Historic Pohick Church Foundation, formally known as the Pohick Church Endowment Fund Inc., a nonprofit organization established in 1983.|$|E

500|$|Courtship {{begins with}} the {{dominant}} male approaching the female, who then assumes a low-head posture and urinates. Unresponsive females run away on being pursued by a male. A male keen on sniffing the female's vulva keeps flicking his tongue. As they continue their [...] "mating march", the male licks the female's rump and persistently attempts mounting her. On mounting, the males tries to clasp her flanks tightly. If she stands firmly, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> that she is ready to mate.

500|$|At {{a prison}} in Marion, Illinois, an inmate loses {{his fingers in}} a {{workshop}} accident. Time seems to slow slow down as another inmate, Donnie Pfaster (Nick Chinlund)a [...] "death fetishist" [...] and serial killer who kidnapped Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) five years earlierwalks {{out of the room}} and leaves the prison. Hearing about the escape, Scully and Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) investigate. They learn that three men escaped from three prisons, all of whom had contact with a prison chaplain named Reverend Orison (Scott Wilson). Eventually, the US Marshals corner Pfaster and Orison at a diner, but Orison uses his power of persuasion to distract the Marshals, allowing the two to escape. Pfaster takes Orison's car and runs him over. Meanwhile, Scully keeps hearing the song [...] "Don't Look Any Further" [...] everywhere she goes, soon believing <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign.</b> The agents find and question Orison, who is himself an ex-convict and claims that he is doing the work of God.|$|E
500|$|In the World Championship, O'Sullivan {{defeated}} Craig Steadman 10–3 in {{the first}} round and Matthew Stevens 13–5 in the second round, but suffered a surprise 9–13 defeat to Stuart Bingham in the quarter-finals. O'Sullivan was involved in many incidents during the tournament. While playing Steadman, he breached snooker's dress code when he removed a pair of uncomfortable shoes and played briefly in his socks, before borrowing shoes from tournament director Mike Ganley. In his match with Stevens, frustrated at missing a shot, he almost snapped his cue in half by hitting it against the table. In his quarter-final match, O'Sullivan placed his chalk on the table and used it to line up a shot. Controversially, referee Terry Camilleri did not penalize him for the incident, even though many commentators, including former world champion Ken Doherty and former tour referee Michaela Tabb, argued that under the rules of snooker the referee should have called a 7-point foul. These incidents led Stephen Hendry to say that O'Sullivan was not fully focused. [...] "Personally I think <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> he has got other things on his mind," [...] said Hendry. [...] "He is not focused properly on winning the World Championship." ...|$|E

50|$|During the Great Patriotic War, Zhukov {{was one of}} only a {{few people}} who {{understood}} Stalin's personality. As the Chief of Staff and later Deputy Supreme Commander, Zhukov had hundreds of meetings with Stalin, both private and during Stavka conferences. Consequently, Zhukov well understood Stalin's personality and methods. According to Zhukov, Stalin <b>was</b> <b>a</b> strong and secretive person, but he was also hot-tempered and skeptical. Zhukov was able to gauge Stalin's mood; for example, when Stalin drew deeply on his tobacco pipe, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> of <b>a</b> good mood. Conversely, if Stalin failed to light his pipe once <b>it</b> <b>was</b> out of tobacco, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> of <b>an</b> imminent rage. An outstanding knowledge of Stalin's personality was very helpful to Zhukov, and it assisted him to deal with Stalin's rages in a way other Soviet generals could not. Both Zhukov and Stalin were hot-tempered, but, at different times, each of them made concessions in order to sustain their relationship.|$|R
50|$|During his {{interrogation}} by Irish Military Intelligence (G2) he {{was told}} about the German agents Wilhelm Preetz and Walter Simon who had also <b>been</b> caught - <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> of his unpreparedness that he was entirely unaware of these men. Through the interrogation of Schütz, G2 were able to arrest Unland although they had been aware of his activities in Dublin previously.|$|R
500|$|Having served {{just over}} three years as Commander-in-Chief, Walker was {{appointed}} Chief of the General Staff (CGS)—the professional head of the British Army—on 17 April 2000, taking over from General Sir Roger Wheeler. He remained CGS for three years, after which {{he was promoted to}} Chief of the Defence Staff (CDS)—the professional head of all the British Armed Forces—on 2 May 2003, succeeding Admiral Sir Michael Boyce (later Lord Boyce). As CDS, Walker criticised some of the media coverage of British deployments in Iraq. In particular, he claimed that attacks on the Black Watch were [...] "enhanced" [...] due to news reports on their location. He {{went on to say that}} [...] ", there could well have been a response by those who wished us ill to go and meet us with something like a bomb". His comments were rejected by a spokesman for the National Union of Journalists, who retaliated [...] "When generals turn around and start blaming reporters for their own mistakes, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> they aren't doing their own jobs properly". Also in 2004, Walker, along with General Sir Mike Jackson, then Chief of the General Staff, attracted controversy over reforms of the armed forces, which included the amalgamation of several army regiments to form larger regiments, leading to the loss of historic names.|$|E
500|$|Andrew Hanson {{from the}} Los Angeles Times thought the [...] "premise {{was a little}} thinly {{stretched}} over the hour" [...] and believed {{it would have been}} overshadowed by stronger episodes in season one, but was glad to have another hour of Fringe regardless. SFScope contributor Sarah Stegall disliked that the network failed to issue a [...] "disclaimer" [...] about the episode's production date, stating [...] "...maybe the producers assume that all their audiences are brand new to the franchise. Or perhaps, unhappily, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> that Fox has given up on this show, and no longer cares whether its lingering audience is confused." [...] She concluded, [...] "As a standalone episode, this one was of middling interest, and I can see why Fox would have dropped it from the Season One lineup. Fans looking eagerly for more 'mythology' episodes, where the links between the Fringe team, Massive Dynamics, Nina Sharpe, William Bell and, for all I know, the Illuminati are explored, may be disappointed." [...] Jane Boursaw of AOL TV was also critical of Fox for giving no warning about the episode and thought it should actually have been titled 'Walter vs. The Priest.'" [...] She continued, [...] "The whole episode was an interesting intersect between science and faith, not to mention the whole 'being possessed by a dead person because your brain waves crossed during life and death' thing. You can tell it was vintage Fringe -- if indeed it was -- because the storylines are more complex than that these days, what with the alternate universe and Leonard Nimoy and all." [...] Various critics noted guest actress Alice Kremelberg's performance, particularly when she had to give the impression she was possessed by a male ghost; most reviews were negative, though Boursaw praised it, giving Kremelberg [...] "high fives".|$|E
2500|$|The {{number of}} priestly vocations {{declined}} under Mahony's leadership. [...] By contrast, lay ministries grew and Mahony has said, [...] "What some {{refer to as}} a 'vocations crisis' is, rather, {{one of the many}} fruits of the Second Vatican Council. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> of God's deep love for the Church, and an invitation to a more creative and effective ordering of gifts and energy in the Body of Christ." ...|$|E
50|$|Fogarty {{first came}} to {{prominence}} on the inter-county scene {{as a member of}} the Offaly minor hurling team in the mid-1970s. He played at this level for his native-county in both 1975 and 1976, however, success eluded him on both occasions. Fogarty later joined the county under-21 team where he did win a Leinster title in 1978. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> of things to come for Offaly.|$|R
2500|$|Between 1968 and 1971, the John Birch Society {{circulated}} rumours {{about the}} origin and meaning of the symbol, claiming <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> of the devil and a Nazi [...] "rune". In 1971, Peggy Duff, {{who had been the}} general secretary of CND, re-affirmed Eric Austen's explanation of the symbol, saying that the inside <b>was</b> <b>a</b> [...] "runic symbol for death of man" [...] and the circle the [...] "symbol for the unborn child".|$|R
2500|$|On December 11, 1811, the New Madrid {{earthquake}} {{shook the}} Muscogee lands and the Midwest. While {{the interpretation of}} this event varied from tribe to tribe, they agreed that the powerful earthquake had to have meant something. [...] The earthquake and its aftershocks helped the Tecumseh resistance movement as the Muscogee and other Native American tribes believed <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> that the Shawnee must be supported {{and that this was}} the sign Tecumseh had prophesied.|$|R
2500|$|Eclampsia is the {{development}} of new convulsions in a pre-eclamptic patient that may not be attributed to other cause. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> that the underlying pre-eclamptic condition is severe and is associated with high rates of perinatal and maternal morbidity and mortality. [...] Warning symptoms for eclampsia in an individual with current pre-eclampsia may include headaches, visual disturbances, and right upper quadrant or epigastric abdominal pain, with a headache being the most consistent symptom. Magnesium sulfate is used to prevent convulsions in cases of severe pre-eclampsia.|$|E
2500|$|Since {{the demonstrations}} against the refusal by the {{government}} to renew the broadcasting license of RCTV (a major TV network), the upside-down flag of Venezuela has been adopted as a symbol of protest for this and other alleged threats to civil liberties. Demonstrators claim that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> of distress and a call for help. However, government and ruling-party officials insist that these demonstrators are desecrating the flag, manipulated by the enemies of the people. An official video sharply criticizing this practice as disrespectful and traitorous was produced. Globovisión prepended to the video a statement denouncing the message as violative of the Law on Social Responsibility on Radio and Television, [...] "for constituting anonymous official propaganda".|$|E
2500|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> of a {{pathologic}} state, {{usually a}} failing or hypertrophic left ventricle, as in systemic hypertension, severe valvular aortic stenosis, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The sound occurs just after atrial contraction {{at the end}} of diastole and immediately before S1, producing a rhythm sometimes referred to as the [...] "Tennessee" [...] gallop where S4 represents the [...] "Ten-" [...] syllable. It is best heard at the cardiac apex with the patient in the left lateral decubitus position and holding his breath. [...] The combined presence of S3 and S4 is a quadruple gallop, also known as the [...] "Hello-Goodbye" [...] gallop. At rapid heart rates, S3 and S4 may merge to produce a summation gallop, sometimes referred to as S7.|$|E
50|$|A ring {{given to}} Barahir by the Elven Lord Finrod Felagund, in reward for saving {{his life in}} Dagor Bragollach. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> of eternal {{friendship}} between Finrod and the House of Barahir. Barahir's hand and ring were taken by the orcs that killed him, but were retrieved by his son Beren when he avenged his father.

Trimble and Democratic Unionist Party Leader Ian Paisley walked hand-in-hand as the march, banned since 1997, proceeded down the road. Many Irish Catholics viewed it as insensitive, while many Protestants felt that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> that Trimble <b>was</b> defending them.|$|R
25|$|Timur {{himself had}} divided his territories among Pir Muhammad, Miran Shah, Khalil Sultan and Shah Rukh, which {{resulted}} in inter-family warfare. Upon Babur's death, Humayun's territories were the least secure. He had ruled only four years, and not all umarah (nobles) viewed Humayun as the rightful ruler. Indeed, earlier, when Babur had become ill, some of the nobles had tried to install his uncle, Mahdi Khwaja, as ruler. Although this attempt failed, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> of problems to come.|$|R
