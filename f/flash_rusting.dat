It {{is also important to}} check the surface for oil deposited during chipping, and if necessary, clean the area with solvents. Since bare metal surfaces will flash rust soon after exposure to the atmosphere, paint should be applied as soon as possible after [...] chipping. [...] If <b>flash</b> <b>rusting</b> occurs prior to coating, further chipping, cleaning and sanding may be necessary.|$|E

Their use {{is on the rise}} as their results have proven to be in many cases as good or better than hydrocarbon cleaners. Additionally, the wastes generated are less hazardous resulting in less costly disposal.|$|E

As part of EPAâ€™s National Partnership for Environmental Priorities http://www.epa.gov/npep (NPEP) program, Crown set a partnership goal of eliminating chromium from its paints. Crown reduced its hazardous waste emissions by more than 300,000 pounds by removing chromium (in the form of ammonium dichromate as a <b>flash</b> <b>rust</b> inhibitor) from water-based paint formulations. By installing a new powder coat paint line, Crown eliminated more than 65 percent of wastewater from its water curtain paint booths, cutting more than 200,000 pounds of wastewater and sludge. The results included reduced air emissions, a better work environment and a savings of $65,000 a year.|$|R

5000|$|Once the {{interior}} scaffolding was installed, a thorough evaluative survey of {{the interior}} coatings was executed. The acknowledged presumption of most involved in the restoration was that all coatings would {{be removed from the}} interior metals, that repairs would be made, that metals would be recoated, and the interior would be adequately weatherproofed. The preexisting interior coatings on both the secondary wrought iron framework and the wrought iron central pylon would be removed along with the multiple layers of coal tar and paint that had been applied to the internal copper sheathing. A New York Times article from February 8, 1984, mentioned that the interior copper which was at that time painted [...] "government green" [...] would be cleaned to resemble the salmon color of a new penny. That outermost [...] "government green" [...] layer was a vinyl paint applied in 1975. Because certain sections that had corroded were hidden beneath the layers of coatings, no attempt was made to salvage any of the seven layers of paint, (consisting of a base coat of red lead primer plus six additional coats) and the two layers of bituminous paint (a coal tar coating) that had been used as a water sealant in the statues interior around 1911. The three available coating removal methods tested, developed (or not) and implemented (or not) were: thermal coating removal, abrasive coating removal and chemical coating removal. The methods contemplated for the removal of the coatings on the interior copper differed from that of the other interior metals. For the preparation of the wrought iron parts of the statue, an abrasive removal method also known as dry sandblasting was implemented in order to prevent against <b>flash</b> <b>rusting,</b> The low dusting abrasive material used in the dry sandblasting technique was aluminum oxide.|$|E

The results of the tests show that the DS Provides very good scouring action and cleaning effectiveness, suggesting its applicability {{to a wide range of}} uses, mainly the cleaning and preparation of metal surfaces before coating. Moreover, the DS is proven to offer temporary anti-corrosive protection, successfully combating one of the most crucial problems, that of <b>flash</b> <b>rusting</b> of the blast-cleaned surface. The DS, by not containing any toxic substances, limits harmful impacts of blast-cleaning on both the health of workers and on the environmen...|$|E
40|$|IN THIS STUDY, THE POSSIBILITIES OF THE INDUSTRIAL UTILISATION OF A PURE DOLOMITE OF THE STEFANI AREA, VIOTIA, GREECE, ARE EXAMINED. THE MAIN OBJECT OF THESTUDY IS THE APPLICABILITY OF THE DOLOMITE OF STEFANI (DS) AS AN EXPANDABLE ABRASIVE TO SEVERAL APPLICATIONS OF THE SHIP-BUILDING INDUSTRY. THE USE OF DS, AS BLASTING MATERIAL, CAUSES THE CONSIDERABLE INHIBITION OF <b>FLASH</b> <b>RUSTING,</b> THAT CAN BE OBSERVED ON THE BLAST-CLEANED SURFACE, IN COMPARISON WITH THE RATES OF RUSTING, THAT FOLLOW THE USE OF CLASSICAL ABRASIVES. DS, WITH RESPECT TO EFFECTIVENESS AND ROUGHNESS CHARACTERISTICS OF THE SAND-BLASTED SURFACE, ALSO GIVES VERY GOOD RESULTS. DS IS TOTALLY FREE OF ANY TOXIC SUBSTANCES. THE APPLICABILITY OF DS AS A FILLER IN PAINT INDUSTRY, AS A HIGH PURITY MATERIALFOR GLASS INDUSTRY, AS A MATERIAL FOR THE CONSERVATION AND RESTORATION OF ANCIENT MONUMENT ETC., IS ALSO EXAMINED. ...|$|E
