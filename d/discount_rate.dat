5|$|Caulfield was {{chairman}} of the committee that drafted the policies, standards and procedures for water resources planning that became known as Senate Document 97, subjecting new federal water projects to benefit/cost analysis for the first time. He was the staff leader in drafting the Water Resources Planning Act of 1965 and was instrumental in its passage through the U.S. Congress; becoming the first Director of the Water Resources Council, a cabinet-level interagency advisory committee created by that Act. From October 1961 to August 1969 he was the leading professional official within the United States government developing and implementing policies for comprehensive river basin planning. In 1968 he drafted and gained political acceptance of a Water Resources Councils' regulation changing the <b>discount</b> <b>rate</b> used in planning water projects from a formula based on the coupon rate of government bonds to one based on the yield rate—a substantial and important policy change. He also had a leading role in early development of the Water Resources Council's Principles and Standards for water project planning promulgated in September 1973.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of three independent chapters on the elicitation of individual <b>discount</b> <b>rates</b> and on the estimation of gambling prevalence in Denmark. The first chapter, “Discount Rate Sensitivity to Background Consumption and Consumption Smoothing,” studies the sensitivity of individual <b>discount</b> <b>rates</b> with respect to background consumption and consumption smoothing. I use simulated choice data from standard decision tasks in time preference experiments and show that individual <b>discount</b> <b>rates</b> are sensitive to assumptions with respect to background consumption and consumption smoothing if the utility function is non-linear and exogenous. However, if <b>discount</b> <b>rates</b> and the utility function are elicited jointly, <b>discount</b> <b>rates</b> are robust to assumptions on time-invariant background consumption and consumption smoothing. The analysis clarifies mixed conclusions from previous studies and indicates which elicitation methods provide robust estimates of individual <b>discount</b> <b>rates...</b>|$|R

40|$|Inferences about {{individual}} <b>discount</b> <b>rates</b> {{are drawn from}} two sets of field experiments. One was a natural field experiment in the United States, undertaken by the U. S.

The other was an “un-natural ” field experiment in Denmark, where laboratory methods were applied in the field by the Danish Ministry of Business and Industry in a deliberate effort to elicit <b>discount</b> <b>rates</b> for policy purposes. In the Danish study, Harrison, Lau and Williams [2000] estimate individual <b>discount</b> <b>rates</b> with respect to time streams of money using controlled laboratory experiments.

40|$|Social <b>discounting</b> <b>rates</b> were {{compared}} between Japanese and American college students. In {{a series of}} psychophysical questionnaire tasks, participants chose between a hypothetical unshared monetary reward and a hypothetical monetary reward to be shared with other people (relatives or strangers), to determine amounts of the unshared reward subjectively equivalent to the shared reward. The participants also chose between sharing and not-sharing options in a one-shot dilemma game. <b>Discount</b> <b>rates</b> estimated by a hyperbolic function were higher among the Japanese students than among the American students. Moreover, the <b>discount</b> <b>rates</b> obtained in the relative condition were lower than in the stranger condition.

40|$|We elicit {{measures}} of individual <b>discount</b> <b>rates</b> from {{a representative sample}} of the Danish population and test two substantive hypotheses. The first hypothesis is that smokers have higher individual <b>discount</b> <b>rates</b> than non-smokers. The second hypothesis is that smokers {{are more likely to have}} time inconsistent preferences than non-smokers, where time inconsistency is indicated by a hyperbolic discounting function. We control for the concavity of the utility function in our estimates of individual <b>discount</b> <b>rates</b> and find that male smokers have significantly higher <b>discount</b> <b>rates</b> than male non-smokers. However, smoking has no significant association with <b>discount</b> <b>rates</b> among women. This result is robust across exponential and hyperbolic discounting functions. We consider the sensitivity of our conclusions to a statistical specification that allows each observation to potentially be generated by more than one latent data-generating process. ...|$|R
25|$|Careful {{matching}} of the <b>discount</b> <b>rate</b> to {{the appropriate}} measure of economic income {{is critical to the}} accuracy of the business valuation results. Net cash flow is a frequent choice in professionally conducted business appraisals. The rationale behind this choice is that this earnings basis corresponds to the equity <b>discount</b> <b>rate</b> derived from the Build-Up or CAPM models: the returns obtained from investments in publicly traded companies can easily be represented in terms of net cash flows. At the same time, the discount rates are generally also derived from the public capital markets data.|$|E
25|$|The {{alternate}} case {{is where}} the government receives more taxes on a particular day than it spends. In this case, {{there may be a}} system-wide deficit of reserves. As a result, surplus funds will be in demand on the interbank market, and thus the short-term interest rate will rise towards the <b>discount</b> <b>rate.</b> Thus, if the central bank wants to maintain a target interest rate somewhere between the support rate and the <b>discount</b> <b>rate,</b> it must manage the liquidity in the system to ensure that there is the correct amount of reserves in the banking system.|$|E

25|$|The {{choice of}} <b>discount</b> <b>rate</b> is subjective. A smaller rate values future generations equally {{with the current}} generation. Larger rates (e.g. a market rate of return) {{reflects}} humans' attraction to time inconsistency—valuing money that they receive today more than money {{they get in the}} future. The choice makes a large difference in assessing interventions with long-term effects. One issue is the equity premium puzzle, in which long-term returns on equities may be rather higher than they should be. If so then arguably market rates of return should not be used to determine a <b>discount</b> <b>rate,</b> as doing so would have the effect of undervaluing the distant future (e.g. climate change).|$|E

25|$|Banks {{with more}} {{reserves}} {{than they need}} {{will be willing to}} lend to banks with a reserve shortage on the interbank lending market.

Thus they will lend to each other until each bank has reached their reserve requirement. In a balanced system, where there are just enough total reserves for all the banks to meet requirements, the short-term interbank lending rate will be in between the support rate and the <b>discount</b> <b>rate.</b>|$|E
