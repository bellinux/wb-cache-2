The film {{tells the story of}} Elliott, a boy who befriends a good-natured extraterrestrial called E.T., who is stranded on Earth.

Released in 1995, Toy Story opened to critical acclaim and commercial success, leading to Pixar signing a five-film deal with Disney, which bore critically and financially successful computer animated films such as A Bug's Life (1998), Toy Story 2 (1999), and Monsters, Inc.

5|$|The 1940 film Florian stars two Lipizzan stallions. It {{was based}} on a 1934 novel written by Felix Salten. The wife of the film's {{producer}} owned the only Lipizzans in the US {{at the time that the}} movie was made. The rescue during World War II of the Lipizzan stallions is depicted in the 1963 Walt Disney movie Miracle of the White Stallions. The movie was the only live-action, relatively realistic film set against a World War II backdrop that Disney has <b>ever</b> <b>produced.</b>|$|E
5|$|Universal Studios, {{which had}} won the bidding war for the film, was hoping to take {{advantage}} of Belushi's popularity in the wake of Saturday Night Live, Animal House, and the Blues Brothers' musical success; it soon found itself unable to control production costs. The start of filming was delayed when Aykroyd, new to film screenwriting, took six months to deliver a long and unconventional script that Landis had to rewrite before production, which began without a final budget. On location in Chicago, Belushi's partying and drug use caused lengthy and costly delays that, along with the destructive car chases depicted onscreen, made the final film {{one of the most expensive}} comedies <b>ever</b> <b>produced.</b>|$|E
5|$|By mid-1941, {{officials}} in the War Office and the British Army had taken the decision that light tanks were no longer {{to be used by}} the British Army due to their inferior weapons and armour, as well as their poor performance during the conflict. Consequently, the Mk VIII was obsolete by the time that any significant number of the tanks had been produced, and none ever saw combat. A number of plans were made by the War Office for the design in light of this decision, including equipping reconnaissance units with them, or the unsuccessful idea of attaching wings to them so that aircraft could tow them as gliders into position to support airborne forces; eventually it was decided to hand over those tanks that had been built to the Royal Air Force for use in airfield defence. One variant on the Mk VIII was designed, the Alecto self-propelled gun which was to have mounted a howitzer and used as a close-support vehicle by airborne forces; however only a few were <b>ever</b> <b>produced</b> and they were never used in combat.|$|E

5|$|By {{the late}} 1950s, the consent decree of 1948 forcing film studios to divest {{themselves}} of theater chains and the competitive pressure of television had caused significant financial distress at MGM. In a gamble {{to save the}} studio, and inspired {{by the success of}} Paramount Pictures' 1956 Biblical epic The Ten Commandments, studio head Joseph Vogel announced in 1957 that MGM would again move forward on a remake of Ben-Hur. Filming started in May 1958 and wrapped in January 1959, and post-production took six months. Although the budget for Ben-Hur was initially $7 million, it was reported to be $10 million by February 1958, reaching $15.175 million by the time shooting began—making it the costliest film <b>ever</b> <b>produced</b> up to that time. When adjusted for inflation, the budget of Ben Hur was approximately $ in constant dollars.|$|E
5|$|In 1940, {{frustrated}} with the perceived lack of success against RAF Fighter Command, Göring was keen on infusing the fighter force leadership with younger blood. He perceived a lack of aggressiveness in the Jagdgeschwader leadership. The likes of Theo Osterkamp were the first victim of this policy, handing over JG 51 to Werner Mölders. Oesau {{was considered to be}} one such rising star. However, being a star and staying in Göring's favor required keeping up the kill rate and promotions were invariably linked to scores. According to Dr. Kurt Tank, the Focke–Wulf designer, although many of the younger generation were good flyers, they were unable to cope with problems of overall planning and broader strategic aspects. However, Oesau was one of the outstanding leaders <b>ever</b> <b>produced</b> by Luftwaffe fighter wings with the likes of Werner Mölders and Adolf Galland.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, the term neo-Lamarckism {{came to be}} {{associated}} with the position of naturalists who viewed the inheritance of acquired characteristics as the most important evolutionary mechanism. Advocates of this position included the British writer and Darwin critic Samuel Butler, the German biologist Ernst Haeckel, and the American paleontologist Edward Drinker Cope. They considered Lamarckism to be philosophically superior to Darwin's idea of selection acting on random variation. Cope looked for, and thought he found, patterns of linear progression in the fossil record. Inheritance of acquired characteristics was part of Haeckel's recapitulation theory of evolution, which held that the embryological development of an organism repeats its evolutionary history. Critics of neo-Lamarckism, such as the German biologist August Weismann and Alfred Russel Wallace, pointed out that no one had <b>ever</b> <b>produced</b> solid evidence for the inheritance of acquired characteristics. Despite these criticisms, neo-Lamarckism remained the most popular alternative to natural selection at the end of the 19th century, and would remain the position of some naturalists well into the 20th century.|$|E
