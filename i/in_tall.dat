5|$|Australian ravens begin {{breeding}} {{once they}} are three years old. Breeding season is from July to September, with no substantial difference in timing across its range around the country despite it inhabiting a range of diverse climates and habitats across 19 degrees of latitude. Rowley has pointed out this is unusual for a bird species {{with a wide range}} and has postulated that breeding is initiated by day length. Rarely, breeding can take place in May, June or October. Australian ravens generally nest <b>in</b> <b>tall</b> trees, never near to the ground as some species do. The nest also functions as a lookout post and so tall or emergent trees are selected. The ravens occasionally nest on buildings, telegraph poles, or tall windmills which allow the species to occupy areas lacking <b>in</b> <b>tall</b> trees. Windmills may have assisted the spread of the species in North Queensland and the Northern Territory. The highest recorded corvid nest in Australia was found atop the AWA Tower in Sydney.|$|E
5|$|Folklorists see the jackalope {{as one of}} a {{group of}} fabled creatures common to American culture since Colonial days. These appear <b>in</b> <b>tall</b> tales about hodags, giant turtles, Bigfoot, and many other mysterious beasts and in novels like Moby-Dick. The tales lend {{themselves}} to comic hoaxing by entrepreneurs who seek attention for their products, their persons, or their towns.|$|E
5|$|Before {{technology}} in wineries could stabilize temperatures, the low temperatures in winter {{of the northern}} German regions would halt fermentation and leave the resulting wines with natural sugars and a low alcohol content. According to local tradition, in the Mosel region the wine would then be bottled <b>in</b> <b>tall,</b> tapered, and green hock bottles. Similar bottles, although brown, are used for Riesling produced in the Rhine region.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{never having}} played a {{national}} league game, Kydd was {{selected in the}} national under-21 (U-21) team in 1999, which, {{as a result of}} reforms made that year, automatically saw her admitted to the Australian Institute of Sport (AIS). She spent the 1999 season playing for the AIS team in the Victorian state league, before switching to their South Australian counterparts for the 2000 season.

5|$|The drop bear is an {{imaginary}} creature in contemporary Australian folklore featuring a predatory, carnivorous {{version of the}} koala. This hoax animal is commonly spoken about <b>in</b> <b>tall</b> tales designed to scare tourists. While koalas are typically docile herbivores, drop bears are described as unusually large and vicious marsupials that inhabit treetops and attack unsuspecting people (or other prey) that walk beneath them by dropping onto their heads from above.|$|E
5|$|The jackalope {{is subject}} to many outlandish and largely tongue-in-cheek claims {{embedded}} <b>in</b> <b>tall</b> tales about its habits. Jackalopes {{are said to be}} so dangerous that hunters are advised to wear stovepipes on their legs to keep from being gored. Stores in Douglas sell jackalope milk, but The New York Times questions its authenticity on grounds that milking a jackalope is known to be fraught with risk. One of the ways to catch a jackalope is to entice it with whiskey, the jackalope's beverage of choice.|$|E
50|$|The largest height {{difference}} between two presidential candidates (out {{of the candidates}} whose heights are known) was in the 1860 election, when Abraham Lincoln stood 12 <b>in</b> <b>taller</b> than opponent Stephen A. Douglas. The second-largest difference was in the 1812 election, with De Witt Clinton standing 11 <b>in</b> <b>taller</b> than incumbent James Madison. The 2016 election between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton has the third largest difference at 9 in, and is notable for being the first time two candidates from major parties are of different genders.|$|R

In Crisis Core, Zack has two attires; his Final Fantasy VII outfit and a different outfit worn during the start of the game, which he changes after fighting Angeal Hewley. Zack's full name was first revealed in an article in Dengeki PlayStation. Nomura stated that Zack's name was derived from 'fair weather' and specifically chosen because it contrasted with Cloud Strife's name.|$|E
5|$|Above {{the third}} setback, {{consisting}} of the 24th through 27th floors, the facade contains horizontal bands and zigzagged gray-and-black brick motifs. Above the fourth setback, between the 27th and 31st floors, the shaft starts to appear. At each corner of the 31st floor, large car-hood ornaments made of Nirosta steel serve as visually striking objects that make the base look larger. These corner extensions alleviate a common optical illusion seen <b>in</b> <b>tall</b> buildings with horizontal bands, whose taller floors would normally look larger. The 31st floor also contains a gray and white frieze of hubcaps and fenders, which both symbolizes the Chrysler Corporation {{and serves as a}} visual effect for the building's Art Deco design. The bonnet embellishments take the shape of Mercury's winged helmet, which was modeled after the hood ornament installed on Chrysler vehicles at the time.|$|E
5|$|Ale {{have several}} adversaries, {{including}} dragons, zmajeviti (dragon-like) men, eagles, St. Elijah, and St. Sava. The principal {{enemy of the}} ala is the dragon; {{he is able to}} defeat her and eliminate her harmful effects. Dragons are thus seen as guardians of the fields and harvest, and as protectors against bad weather. When an ala threatens by bringing hail clouds, a dragon comes out to fight with her and drive her away. His main weapon is lightning; thunder represents a fight between ale and dragons (during which ale hide <b>in</b> <b>tall</b> trees). An instance of a more abundant crop at a particular point is explained in the Pƒçinja region {{as a result of a}} dragon having struck an ala with lightning just over that place, making her drop the looted grains she had been carrying in her huge ears. If an ala finds a dragon in a hollow tree, however, she can destroy him by burning the tree.|$|E

5|$|Fonda {{made her}} Broadway {{debut in the}} 1960 play There Was a Little Girl, for which she {{received}} {{the first of two}} Tony Award nominations, and made her screen debut later the same year <b>in</b> <b>Tall</b> Story. She rose to fame in 1960s films such as Period of Adjustment (1962), Sunday in New York (1963), Cat Ballou (1965), Barefoot in the Park (1967) and Barbarella (1968). Her first husband was Barbarella director Roger Vadim. A seven-time Academy Award nominee, she received her first nomination for They Shoot Horses, Don't They (1969) and went on to win two Best Actress Oscars in the 1970s for Klute (1971) and Coming Home (1978). Her other nominations were for Julia (1977), The China Syndrome (1979), On Golden Pond (1981) and The Morning After (1986). Her other major competitive awards include an Emmy Award for the 1984 TV film The Dollmaker, two BAFTA Awards for Julia and The China Syndrome and four Golden Globe Awards.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} about this species' behavior. The Congo serpent eagle lives in the {{understory}} of its habitat and occasionally perches on lower boughs <b>in</b> <b>tall</b> trees. It lives either alone or in pairs. This species is known to hunt snakes, lizards, especially chameleons, toads, and potentially small mammals. It hunts by dropping to the ground from its perch in the understory, where it may strike its prey repeatedly with its feet; this serpent eagle may also grab prey from the foliage while hunting. Its large eyes enable this species to hunt in low light, though it is diurnal. Studies on the species' eyes have shown that they have about two times the visual resolution of a human's. It may breed from October to December in Gabon and from June to November in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.|$|E
5|$|The {{antelope}} is shy and elusive. When alarmed, {{it stands}} motionless and may nervously leap {{away from the}} danger or even sprint. It often conceals itself <b>in</b> <b>tall</b> grasses to escape predators. The use of alarm calls to alert others is not common because the antelope tries to avoid the attention of predators. However, in extreme cases, these calls {{may be used to}} warn predators that they have been identified. Adults mark vegetation in their territories with a colourless secretion of preorbital glands, that soon condenses to form a white film. They maintain multiple latrine sites where piles of their pellet droppings are formed by regular use. Latrine sites can be confused with those of the barking deer but the pellets are longer and larger in four-horned antelopes. Submissive display consists of shrinking the body, lowering the head and pulling the ears back. Predators of four-horned antelopes include tigers, leopards, and dholes.|$|E

40|$|In this research, {{buildings}} with 2 - 15 stories and different heights were put together using GAP joint element and nonlinear time-history analyses were done for Tabas, Elcentro and Sakaria accelerographs. The responses of both impact and non-impact cases were compared. With results analyzing, {{we found out}} that the impact increased the responses <b>in</b> <b>taller</b> buildings but decreased them in shorter ones. The largest increase was occurred when the height difference was 3 stories. Then the effective parameters in impact phenomenon, hardness and the distance between the structures were studied.

5|$|The fruiting {{body has}} a convex-shaped cap, at first small in {{relation}} to its stipe, expanding in volume as it matures. The skin of the cap is dry, matte and can be coloured from maroon to chocolate brown with a reddish tint. These characteristics distinguish it visually from relatives such as Boletus edulis, Boletus reticulatus and Boletus aereus. The young, immature cap may have a pale pink colour and a white, powdery flush. Measuring 410cm (1.64 <b>in)</b> <b>tall</b> by 38 (1.22.2in) cm wide, the bulbous stipe is often large, swollen and imposing, bearing a network. The overall colour may have an orange-red tinge which is more obvious in the lowest parts, although this is also common in other species. As with all boletes, {{the size of the}} fruiting body can be very variable. The cap diameter can be as much as 30cm (12in) and stem height 15cm (6in).|$|E
