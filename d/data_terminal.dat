5|$|Mobile <b>data</b> <b>terminal</b> – Some {{ambulances}} are {{fitted with}} Mobile data terminals (or MDTs), which are connected wirelessly {{to a central}} computer, usually at the control center. These terminals can function instead of or alongside the two-way radio {{and can be used}} to pass details of jobs to the crew, and can log the time the crew was mobile to a patient, arrived, and left scene, or fulfill any other computer based function.|$|E
5|$|Police cars lack GPS {{navigation}} {{devices and}} mobile <b>data</b> <b>terminal.</b> Instead, all communication must be radioed to the dispatcher at the joint operations center, and officers {{must rely on}} printed road atlases for navigation. In contrast, GPS navigation and terminal equipment was finished installed in ambulances and fire trucks in 2003. The Norwegian Public Safety Radio is scheduled for completion in 2015.|$|E
25|$|Hayes Microcomputer Products was a U.S.-based {{manufacturer}} of modems. The company {{is well known}} for the Smartmodem, which introduced a control language for operating the functions of the modem via the serial interface to the <b>data</b> <b>terminal</b> equipment, in contrast to manual operation with front-panel switches. This smart modem approach dramatically simplified and automated operation. Today almost all modems use a variant of the Hayes command set.|$|E
5000|$|PSC Inc. was a {{manufacturer}} of portable <b>data</b> <b>terminals,</b> mobile <b>data</b> <b>terminals,</b> wireless terminals, bar code scanners, linear bar code verifiers, and RFID readers.

25|$|The primary {{communication}} tool carried by each officer {{is through a}} common digital radio set used by Home Team organizations. In {{the first half of}} the 21st century, this was provided by Matra Nortel Communications/EADS based on TETRAPOL technology. In 2013, a contract was awarded to Motorola Communications for a replacement communication network (MCN2) using TETRA technology (Motorola Dimetra) with the first units being deployed in 2015. Whereas for secondary communication, officers are given the option to utilise the Mobile <b>Data</b> <b>Terminal</b> (MDT) or their personal issued Personal Digital Assistant, also known as Cubicon 2 in which real time information can be communicated between the officer and command center or ops room.|$|E
25|$|The {{microkernel}} {{concept was}} introduced {{in an effort to}} reverse the trend towards larger kernels and return to a system in which most tasks were completed by smaller utilities. In an era when a standard computer consisted of a hard disk for storage and a <b>data</b> <b>terminal</b> for input and output (I/O), the Unix file model worked quite well, as most I/O was linear. However, modern systems include networking and other new devices. As graphical user interfaces developed, the file model proved inadequate to the task of handling asynchronous events such as those generated by a mouse. In the 1980s, non-blocking I/O and the set of inter-process communication mechanisms were augmented with Unix domain sockets, shared memory, message queues, and semaphores. In microkernel implementations, functions such as network protocols could be moved out of the kernel, while conventional (monolithic) Unix implementations have network protocol stacks as part of the kernel.|$|E
25|$|Many {{phones are}} able to decode {{barcodes}} using their built-in camera, as well. Google's mobile Android operating system uses both their own Google Goggles application or third party barcode scanners like Scan. Nokia's Symbian operating system features a barcode scanner, while mbarcode is a QR code reader for the Maemo operating system. In Apple iOS 11, the native camera app can decode QR Codes and can link to URLs, join wireless networks, or perform other operations depending on the QR Code contents. Other paid and free apps are available with scanning capabilities for other symbologies or for earlier iOS versions. With BlackBerry devices, the App World application can natively scan barcodes and load any recognized Web URLs on the device's Web browser. Windows Phone 7.5 is able to scan barcodes through the Bing search app. However, these devices are not designed specifically for the capturing of barcodes. As a result, they do not decode nearly as quickly or accurately as a dedicated barcode scanner or portable <b>data</b> <b>terminal.</b>|$|E

50|$|<b>Data</b> <b>terminals</b> {{are partly}} {{purchased}} and installed to reduce load on dispatch staff {{and to reduce}} traffic on voice channels. When they work properly, they have a significant operational benefit. A data outage during an occurrence of high call traffic can quickly overrun dispatch and voice channel capacity in cases where a routine level of calls for service requires both <b>data</b> <b>terminals</b> and voice channels.|$|R

DTOs fulfilled a position that was the rough equivalent of a black secretary, and the workforce was composed exclusively of women. [...] The DTOs at Duke felt as though their wages were unreasonably low and that this implied a {{lack of respect for}} their skills. Furthermore, they were fed up with the prevalent racism they encountered on a daily basis in the hospital. [...] After several meetings, the DTOs successfully organized a walkout that not only demonstrated to the hospital their necessity, but also allowed the women to realize their own power. In response, the administration raised their wages, gave them days off, and increased the size of the DTO workforce. [...] The walkout proved extremely effective and marked the first instance of collective action supporting the rights of hospital workers at Duke Medical Center.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Packet Reservation Multiple Access (PRMA) can {{be viewed}} as a {{combination}} of TDMA and slotted ALOHA protocols. In PRMA, there are speech and <b>data</b> <b>terminals</b> that communicate with a base station. Downlink packets are scheduled by the base station, but for uplink access (first packet of a talkspurt or any <b>data</b> packet), <b>terminals</b> use slotted ALOHA. Speech <b>terminals</b> (and some <b>data</b> <b>terminals,</b> too) can make slot reservations for future frames. PRMA can also be seen as a kind of statistical multiplexing scheme. Statistical multiplexing gain comes from the fact that speech terminals are equipped with speech activity detectors and thus they transmit packets only during talkspurts...|$|R
