The HUD displays video communications and relevant data on the ship's status and performance, weapons, objectives, and targets. It can also warn players from which direction missiles are locking onto them from, thus becoming an aide for launching countermeasures or taking evasive maneuvers. Players have to maneuver into position and shoot through both shields and hull to destroy enemy ships. While hull damage is unrecoverable, shields recharge over time. With the game supporting <b>force</b> <b>feedback</b> technology, joystick players will find their controllers vibrating or putting up resistance when they engage the afterburners or collide with objects. Similarly, certain events, such as engaging afterburners and firing powerful weapons, will shake the screen {{as a form of}} visual feedback.|$|E
5|$|Uncharted {{uses the}} Cell {{microprocessor}} to generate dozens of layered character animations to portray realistic expressions and fluid movements, which allow for responsive player control. The PlayStation 3's graphics processing unit, the RSX Reality Synthesizer, employed several functions to provide graphical details that helped immerse the player {{into the game}} world: lighting models, pixel shaders, dynamic real-time shadowing, and advanced water simulation. The new hardware allowed for processes which the team had never used in PlayStation 2 game development and required them to quickly familiarize with the new techniques; for example, parallel processing and pixel shaders. While Blu-ray afforded greater storage space, the team became concerned with running out of room several times—Uncharted used more and bigger textures than previous games, and included several languages on the disc. Gameplay elements requiring motion sensing, such as throwing grenades and walking across beams, were implemented {{to take advantage of}} the Sixaxis controller. A new PlayStation 3 controller, the DualShock 3, was unveiled at the 2007 Tokyo Game Show, and featured <b>force</b> <b>feedback</b> vibration. Uncharted was also on display at the show with demonstrations that implemented limited support for vibration.|$|E

The approach is to evaluate <b>feedback</b> <b>forces</b> provided by the welding process using the discrete Fourier transform and a multilayer neural network. It is asserted here that the oscillations of the <b>feedback</b> <b>forces</b> {{are related to the}} dynamics of the plasticized material flow, so that the frequency spectra of the <b>feedback</b> <b>forces</b> can be used for detecting wormhole defects. A one-hidden-layer neural network trained with the backpropagation algorithm is used for classifying the frequency patterns of the <b>feedback</b> <b>forces.</b> The neural network is trained and optimized with a data set of forge-load control welds, and the generality is tested with novel data set of position control welds.

500|$|Shoot 'em ups such as SNK's Ikari Warriors (1986) {{featuring}} {{characters on}} foot, rather than spacecraft, became {{popular in the}} mid-1980s {{in the wake of}} action movies such as [...] The origins of this type go back to Sheriff by Nintendo, released in 1979. Taito's Front Line (1982) established the upwards-scrolling formula later popularized by Commando, in 1985. Commando also drew comparisons to Rambo and indeed contemporary critics considered military themes and protagonists similar to Rambo or Schwarzenegger prerequisites for a shoot 'em up, as opposed to an action-adventure game. In 1986, Arsys Software released WiBArm, a shooter that switched between a 2D side-scrolling view in outdoor areas to a fully 3D polygonal third-person perspective inside buildings, while bosses were fought in an arena-style 2D battle, with the game featuring a variety of weapons and equipment. In 1987, Square's 3-D WorldRunner was an early stereoscopic 3-D shooter played from a third-person perspective, followed later that year by its sequel JJ, and the following year by Space Harrier 3-D which used the SegaScope 3-D shutter glasses. That same year, Sega's Thunder Blade switched between both a top-down view and a third-person view, and introduced the use of <b>force</b> <b>feedback,</b> where the joystick vibrates. Also in 1987, Konami created Contra as an coin-op arcade game that was particularly acclaimed for its multi-directional aiming and two player cooperative gameplay. However, by the early 1990s and the popularity of 16-bit consoles, the scrolling shooter genre was overcrowded, with developers struggling to make their games stand out (one exception being the inventive Gunstar Heroes, by Treasure).|$|E
500|$|The Dreamcast {{controller}} {{includes both}} an analog stick and a digital pad, four action buttons, and two analog triggers.

[...] The staff of IGN wrote that [...] "unlike most controllers, Sega's pad forces the user's hands into an uncomfortable parallel position." [...] In contrast to the Sega CD and Sega Saturn, which included internal backup memory, the Dreamcast uses a 128 kbyte memory card called the VMU (or [...] "Visual Memory Unit") for data storage. The VMU features a small LCD screen, audio output from a one-channel PWM sound source, non-volatile memory, a directional pad, and four buttons. The VMU can present game information, {{be used as a}} minimal handheld gaming device, and connect to certain Sega arcade machines. [...] For example, players use the VMU to call plays in NFL 2K or raise virtual pets in Sonic Adventure. Sega officials noted that the VMU could be used [...] "as a private viewing area, the absence of which has prevented effective implementation of many types of games in the past." [...] After a VMU slot was incorporated into the controller's design, Sega's engineers found many additional uses for it, so a second slot was added. This slot was generally used for vibration packs providing <b>force</b> <b>feedback</b> like Sega's [...] "Jump Pack" [...] and Performance's [...] "Tremor Pack", although it could also be used for other peripherals including a microphone enabling voice control and player communication.

2500|$|With purely {{mechanical}} {{flight control}} systems, the aerodynamic {{forces on the}} control surfaces are transmitted through the mechanisms and are felt directly by the pilot, allowing tactile feedback of airspeed. With hydromechanical flight control systems, however, the load on the surfaces cannot be felt {{and there is a}} risk of overstressing the aircraft through excessive control surface movement. To overcome this problem, artificial feel systems can be used.
