5000|$|Looking {{to address}} the {{problems}} found in the sandwich motor, starting in 1967 Eric Laithwaite and his team at Imperial College London began experimenting with single-sided LIM arrangements. In this arrangement there is no corresponding set of magnetic fields on the [...] "far side" [...] of the stator, which requires some other system to be used to create a complete <b>flux</b> <b>path.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Later [...] "traverse-flux" [...] {{systems at}} his Imperial College laboratory, such as Magnetic river avoided {{most of the}} {{problems}} of needing to have long, thick iron backing plates when having very long poles, by closing the <b>flux</b> <b>path</b> laterally by arranging the two opposite long poles side-by-side. They were also able to break the levitator primary into convenient sections which made it easier to build and transport.|$|E

25|$|The relay's {{primary winding}} is {{supplied}} {{from the power}} systems current transformer via a plug bridge, which is called the plug setting multiplier (psm). Usually seven equally spaced tappings or operating bands determine the relays sensitivity. The primary winding {{is located on the}} upper electromagnet. The secondary winding has connections on the upper electromagnet that are energised from the primary winding and connected to the lower electromagnet. Once the upper and lower electromagnets are energised they produce eddy currents that are induced onto the metal disc and flow through the <b>flux</b> <b>paths.</b> This relationship of eddy currents and fluxes creates torque proportional to the input current of the primary winding, due to the two <b>flux</b> <b>paths</b> being out of phase by 90°.|$|R

A combination of an equivalent magnetic circuit approach with improved description of relevant <b>flux</b> <b>paths</b> allows for a computationally efficient algorithm suitable for design optimization. The method is illustrated using an example of a linear switched reluctance motor and validated using finite element simulations...|$|R
5000|$|For most core materials, [...] [...] So in {{equation}} (1) above, {{the second}} term dominates. Therefore, in magnetic circuits with an air gap, {{the strength of the}} magnetic field B depends strongly on the length of the air gap, and the length of the <b>flux</b> <b>path</b> in the core doesn't matter much. Given an air gap of 1mm, a magnetomotive force of about 796 Ampere-turns is required to produce a magnetic field of 1T.|$|E
5000|$|... where Io is {{the initial}} <b>flux,</b> <b>path</b> length Δx ≡ x &minus; xo, the second {{equality}} defines an interaction {{mean free path}} λ, the third uses the number of targets per unit volume η to define an area cross-section σ, and the last uses the target mass density ρ to define a density mean free path τ. Hence one converts between these quantities via Q = 1/&lambda; = &eta;&sigma; = &rho;/&tau;, {{as shown in the}} figure at left.|$|E
50|$|It can be {{seen that}} to {{maximize}} the force, a core with a short <b>flux</b> <b>path</b> L and a wide cross sectional area A is preferred (this also applies to magnets with an air gap). To achieve this, in applications like lifting magnets (see photo above) and loudspeakers a flat cylindrical design is often used. The winding is wrapped around a short wide cylindrical core that forms one pole, and a thick metal housing that wraps around the outside of the windings forms {{the other part of the}} magnetic circuit, bringing the magnetic field to the front to form the other pole.|$|E

40|$|A {{magnetic}} bearing for passively suspending a rotatable element subjected to axial and radial thrust forces is disclosed. The {{magnetic bearing}} employs a taut wire stretched along the longitudinal {{axis of the}} bearing between opposed end pieces and an intermediate magnetic section. The intermediate section is segmented to provide oppositely directed magnetic <b>flux</b> <b>paths</b> between the end pieces and may include either an axially polarized magnets interposed between the segments. The end pieces, separated from the intermediate section by air gaps, control distribution of magnetic flux between the intermediate section segments. Coaxial alignment of the end pieces with the intermediate section minimizes magnetic reluctance in the <b>flux</b> <b>paths</b> endowing the bearing with self-centering characteristics when subjected to radial loads. In an alternative embodiment, pairs of oppositely wound armature coils are concentrically interposed between segments of the intermediate section in concentric arcs adjacent to radially polarized magnets to equip a magnetic bearing as a torsion drive motor. The magnetic suspension bearing disclosed provides long term reliability without maintenance with application to long term space missions such as the VISSR/VAS scanning mirror instrument in the GOES program...|$|R
50|$|The {{electromagnetic}} {{lines of}} flux have {{to attract and}} pull the armature in contact with it to complete engagement. Most industrial couplings use {{what is called a}} single flux, two pole design (A-2). Mobile clutches of other specialty electromagnetic clutches can use a double or triple flux rotor (A-4). The double or trip flux refers to the number of north/south flux paths (A-6), in the rotor and armature. These slots (banana slots) (A-7) create an air gap which causes the <b>flux</b> <b>path</b> to take {{the path of least resistance}} when the faces are engaged. This means that, if the armature is designed properly and has similar banana slots, what occurs is a leaping of the <b>flux</b> <b>path,</b> which goes north south, north south (A-6). By having more points of contact, the torque can be greatly increased. In theory, if there were 2 sets of poles at the same diameter, the torque would double in a clutch. Obviously, that is not possible to do, so the points of contact have to be at a smaller inner diameter. Also, there are magnetic flux losses because of the bridges between the banana slots. But by using a double flux design, a 30%-50% increase in torque, can be achieved, and by using a triple flux design, a 40%-90% in torque can be achieved. This is important in applications where size and weight are critical, such as automotive requirements.|$|E
5000|$|This is a {{nonlinear}} equation, {{because the}} permeability of the core, μ, {{varies with the}} magnetic field B. For an exact solution, the value of μ at the B value used must {{be obtained from the}} core material hysteresis curve. [...] If B is unknown, the equation must be solved by numerical methods. However, if the magnetomotive force is well above saturation, so the core material is in saturation, the magnetic field will be approximately the saturation value Bsat for the material, and won't vary much with changes in NI. For a closed magnetic circuit (no air gap) most core materials saturate at a magnetomotive force of roughly 800 ampere-turns per meter of <b>flux</b> <b>path.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract — In many variable-torque {{applications}} of induction machines, {{it is desirable}} to operate the machine at high flux levels, thus allowing the machine to produce higher torques. This can lead to saturation of the main <b>flux</b> <b>path,</b> introducing crosscoupling effects which can severely disrupt the performance of controllers dependent on knowledge of the machine’s magnetic parameters. Stator-flux-oriented torque-control schemes need {{not depend on the}} magnetic parameters of the machine and, hence, are potentially more robust and easier to implement in magnetic saturation than rotor-flux-oriented control. In this paper, we present and analyze a stator-flux-oriented torque-control scheme. This controller only requires knowledge of the stator voltage, stator current, and stator resistance. An analytical expression for the maximum achievable torque output of the machine using a linear magnetics model is compared with values calculated using a nonlinear magnetics model incorporating saturation of the main <b>flux</b> <b>path</b> and is shown to be a good approximation at high flux levels, when the main <b>flux</b> <b>path</b> is heavily saturated. Experiments carried out on a 3 -hp 1800 -r/min wound-rotor induction machine show smooth operation of the control scheme at torque levels up to at least four times rated torque.
