40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the concept of}} resourcism' {{as an alternative to}} the capability approach. It argues that the term economic resources covers too many different concepts for the term resourcism to be useful when analysing distributional justice. In particular, the resourcism of Dworkin is radically different from that of Rawls, because resources in Dworkin's usage are not the same as Rawls's income and wealth. The term <b>economic</b> <b>goods</b> is proposed as a more precise term than resources. Furthermore, it is argued that, since all theories of distributional justice concern the distribution of <b>economic</b> <b>goods,</b> they are all in some sense resourcist. The paper then discusses in the concept of resourcism defined by Thomas Pogge (2004), and concludes that his concept of resourcism is not logically consistent. Pogge also maintains that the just distribution of <b>economic</b> <b>goods</b> should take into account only standard human needs. The paper argues that taking natural human diversity into account is both possible and desirable as far as valuable human functionings are concerned, and that Pogge's criticism of the capability approach in this respect therefore is unfounded.

25|$|In {{the absence}} of {{negative}} externalities, the introduction of taxes into a market reduces economic efficiency by causing deadweight loss. In a competitive market {{the price of a}} particular <b>economic</b> <b>good</b> adjusts to ensure that all trades which benefit both the buyer and the seller of a good occur. The introduction of a tax causes the price received by the seller to be less than the cost to the buyer by the amount of the tax. This causes fewer transactions to occur, which reduces economic welfare; the individuals or businesses involved are less well off than before the tax. The tax burden and the amount of deadweight cost is dependent on the elasticity of supply and demand for the good taxed.|$|E

However, some institutions foreseen under the law, such as the River Basin Councils, remain to be created. The water law also establishes priority uses of water, re-defines water user rights, understands water as an <b>economic</b> <b>good,</b> defines sanctions, considers river basins as management units and incorporates groundwater management considerations. It is foreseen that subsidiary legislation (reglamentos) will complement the water law by specifying, for instance, the roles of each institution within the National Water Resources System.|$|E
25|$|The {{government}} of Peru is currently undertaking a major transformation of its {{water resources management}} from a centralized approach focused on irrigation development in the coastal area to a river basin integrated water resources management for the entire country. The 2009 Water Resources Law (Ley de Recursos Hídricos) and the draft National Water Resources Management Strategy of 2004 (Estrategia Nacional para la Gestión de los Recursos Hídricos Continentales del Perú) contain the necessary elements for Integrated Water Resources Management as stated in international good practices namely, integration of sectoral policies, participation of stakeholders, decentralization of management to the river basin level and recognition of water as a social and <b>economic</b> <b>good.</b> Despite the new law, several key challenges remain, including limited institutional capacity, increasing water stress in the coastal region, deteriorating water quality, poor efficiency in the irrigation sector, as well as inadequate access to and poor quality of water supply and sanitation.|$|E

It argues that the term economic resources covers too many different concepts for the term "resourcism" to be useful when analysing distributional justice. In particular, the "resourcism" of Dworkin is radically different from that of Rawls, because resources in Dworkin's usage are not the same as Rawls's "income and wealth".

Furthermore, it is argued that, since all theories of distributional justice concern the distribution of <b>economic</b> <b>goods,</b> they are all in some sense "resourcist.
