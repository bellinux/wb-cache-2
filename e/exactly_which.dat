5|$|On Gisa's {{arrival in}} the see he found the church there quite poor. He {{constructed}} cloisters {{to the north of}} Wells Cathedral and communal buildings to the south for the canons. He ordered the canons to live together under a rule, but <b>exactly</b> <b>which</b> rule it was is unknown. After the Conquest, he introduced the veneration of new saints into his cathedral, as well as setting up an archdeacon in the diocese for the first time. He also wrote a history of the church. He worked to restore lands formerly held by the bishop or cathedral that had been unjustly acquired by others.|$|E
5|$|A remorseful Leslie (Amy Poehler) tells a {{group of}} Recreation Center {{teachers}} the Pawnee budget has been cut by $1,000, and five of their classes {{will have to be}} cut, but <b>exactly</b> <b>which</b> classes has not yet been determined. Later, Leslie and Justin Anderson (Justin Theroux), who have been dating for weeks, have another excellent date in Indianapolis. At the end of the night, they decide their next date will be in Pawnee, and Leslie feels pressure to make their date equally exciting. While talking later with Ann (Rashida Jones), Leslie decides to host a dinner party at her home with all her interesting friends. She invites Mark (Paul Schneider), Tom (Aziz Ansari) and Ron (Nick Offerman), specifically excludes Jerry (Jim O'Heir), and asks Andy (Chris Pratt) to work as the waiter. Andy agrees, even though he hates Justin, Ann's former crush, and Mark, her current boyfriend.|$|E

25|$|When {{construction}} {{began on}} the B in the 1820s, railroad engineering was in its infancy. Unsure <b>exactly</b> <b>which</b> materials would suffice, the B erred {{on the side of}} sturdiness and built many of its early structures of granite. Even the track bed to which iron strap rail was affixed consisted of the stone.|$|E

25|$|Cobergher {{began his}} career as an {{architect}} in Italy, designing fountains and canals (not confirmed by surviving documents). He is reported to have overseen the construction of palaces and fortifications, but it is not <b>exactly</b> known <b>which</b> ones.|$|R
25|$|A crude border {{had already}} been drawn up by Lord Wavell, the Viceroy of India prior to his {{replacement}} as Viceroy, in February 1947, by Lord Louis Mountbatten. In order to determine <b>exactly</b> <b>which</b> territories to assign to each country, in June 1947, Britain appointed Sir Cyril Radcliffe to chair two Boundary Commissions—one for Bengal and one for Punjab.|$|E
25|$|The {{approach}} using Bohmian trajectories and {{the quantum}} potential {{is used for}} calculating properties of quantum systems which cannot be solved <b>exactly,</b> <b>which</b> are often approximated using semi-classical approaches. Whereas in mean field approaches {{the potential for the}} classical motion results from an average over wave functions, this approach does not require the computation of an integral over wave functions.|$|E
25|$|In February 2006, {{an unnamed}} former chemist at the FDA {{publicly}} revealed that benzene may be created {{as part of}} a chemical reaction during production of soft drinks, particularly those having an orange flavor. Full-scale investigations immediately started at the Food Standards Agency (UK) and in Germany to reveal <b>exactly</b> <b>which</b> amounts of benzene, if any, were present, with several other organizations awaiting their findings.|$|E

50|$|During {{the fourteenth}} century, the {{emergence}} of the foliot replaced the high-maintenance water clocks. It is not known when that happened <b>exactly</b> and <b>which</b> of the early 14th century clocks were water clocks and which ones use a foliot.|$|R
25|$|Once the faulty {{stage is}} found, further probing can usually tell a skilled {{technician}} <b>exactly</b> <b>which</b> component has failed. Once the component is replaced, the unit can {{be restored to}} service, {{or at least the}} next fault can be isolated. This sort of troubleshooting is typical of radio and TVreceivers, as well as audio amplifiers, but can apply to quite-different devices such as electronic motor drives.|$|E
25|$|SCO {{claims that}} Linux infringes SCO's copyright, trade secrets, and {{contractual}} rights. This claim {{is fundamental to}} the SCOsource program, where SCO has demanded that Linux users obtain licenses from SCOsource to be properly licensed to use the code in question. <b>Exactly</b> <b>which</b> parts of Linux are involved remains unclear as many of their claims are still under seal in the SCO v. IBM lawsuit.|$|E
25|$|When it {{was first}} discovered, the {{scientists}} who studied Anchiornis conducted a phylogenetic analysis and concluded {{that it was an}} early member of the group Avialae, along with Archaeopteryx. Members of Avialae, called avialans, are all more closely related to modern birds than they are to dromaeosaurid and troodontid dinosaurs, though the earliest and most primitive members of all three groups are extremely similar to each other, which makes it difficult to sort out <b>exactly</b> <b>which</b> of these three main paravian branches they belong to.|$|E

50|$|Whether {{the medieval}} chronicles really do {{refer to the}} same regalia which are kept in Vienna today depends {{on a variety of}} factors. Descriptions of the {{emperors}} only spoke of them being “clothed in imperial regalia” without <b>exactly</b> describing <b>which</b> items they were.|$|R

25|$|The Parthenon {{became the}} fourth most {{important}} Christian pilgrimage destination in the Eastern Roman Empire after Constantinople, Ephesos, and Thessalonica. In 1018, the emperor Basil II {{went on a}} pilgrimage to Athens directly after his final victory over the Bulgarians {{for the sole purpose of}} worshipping at the Parthenon. In medieval Greek accounts it is called the Temple of Theotokos Atheniotissa and often indirectly referred to as famous without explaining <b>exactly</b> <b>which</b> temple they were referring to, thus establishing that it was indeed well known.|$|E
25|$|Diadochi (Διάδοχοι) is {{an ancient}} Greek word that {{currently}} modern scholars use to refer primarily to persons acting a role that existed only for a limited time period and within a limited geographic range. As there are no modern equivalents, it has been necessary to reconstruct the role from the ancient sources. There is no uniform agreement concerning <b>exactly</b> <b>which</b> historical persons fit the description, or the territorial range over which the role was in effect, or the calendar dates of the period. A certain basic meaning is included in all definitions, however.|$|E
25|$|Most {{authorities}} {{agree that}} Mark 15:40 and 16:1 {{refer to the}} same person, but traditions and authorities differ as to the Matthew and Luke passages. Some regard them all as a single person, some as two (in various combinations), and some even as three different people. If three, then the Matthew and Luke passages are the only explicit references to either of these other two. There is a similar variety of opinions as to <b>exactly</b> <b>which</b> person {{is referred to as}} James on each occasion.|$|E

25|$|Conservation of the {{external}} masonry, particularly on the northern side of the building, is equally important. The cathedral is in part built of Caen stone. Detailed archaeological studies are undertaken to identify <b>exactly</b> <b>which</b> stones {{need to be replaced}} or repaired. In addition, specialist cleaning techniques are used to remove accumulated chemical deposits which are very damaging to the building. As regards the interior, priorities include decoration of the vaults of the Trinity Chapel, major improvements to the Treasury building which contains, amongst other things, the choir practice rooms, and conservation work in several other chapels.|$|E
25|$|Orthodox {{and some}} Conservative {{authorities}} rule that turning electric devices {{on or off}} is prohibited as a melakhah; however, authorities are not in agreement about <b>exactly</b> <b>which</b> one(s). One view is that tiny sparks are created in a switch when the circuit is closed, and this would constitute lighting a fire (category 37). If the appliance is purposed for light or heat (such as an incandescent bulb or electric oven), then the lighting or heating elements may {{be considered as a}} type of fire that falls under both lighting a fire (category 37) and cooking (i.e., baking, category 11). Turning lights off would be extinguishing a fire (category 36).|$|E
25|$|A {{declaration}} was {{sought in}} Chee Siok Chin v. Attorney-General (2006), where the plaintiffs {{claimed that the}} repeal of O.14, r.1(2) of the Rules of the Supreme Court 1970 {{by way of the}} Rules of the Supreme Court (Amendment No. 2) Rules 1991 ("the 1991 amendment") was unconstitutional and in breach of the principles of natural justice. However, the assertion was held to be groundless as counsel for the plaintiffs had failed to identify <b>exactly</b> <b>which</b> part of the Constitution had been violated by the 1991 amendment and explain how the plaintiffs' constitutional rights had been abrogated. As such, no declaratory order was granted to render the amended O.14 summary judgment procedure unconstitutional.|$|E

50|$|Some supersymmetric {{theories}} {{require a}} cosmological constant that is <b>exactly</b> zero, <b>which</b> further complicates things.

5000|$|So [...] "0" [...] {{will have}} <b>exactly</b> one successor, <b>which</b> for {{convenience}} {{can be called}} [...] "1". In turn, [...] "1" [...] will have <b>exactly</b> one successor, <b>which</b> could be called [...] "2", and so on. Notice that the second condition in the definition itself refers to natural numbers, and hence involves self-reference. Although this sort of definition involves a form of circularity, it is not vicious, and the definition has been quite successful.|$|R
