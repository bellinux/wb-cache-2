5|$|Following the {{introduction}} of the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) of many coastal nations was increased from 12 to 200 Nmi. The sudden expansion of responsibility dramatically increased the area of ocean requiring surveillance, monitoring and policing by these nations, increasing the strain on existing maritime patrol resources, and highlighting the need <b>for</b> <b>countries</b> without a maritime patrol force to obtain one, especially in the South West Pacific area.|$|E
5|$|The {{absence of}} {{distinct}} currencies also theoretically removes exchange rate risks, although {{the imposition of}} transfer restrictions in 2012–13 Cypriot financial crisis means {{that the situation is}} not quite so simple. The risk of unanticipated exchange rate movement has always added an additional risk or uncertainty for companies or individuals that invest or trade outside their own currency zones. Companies that hedge against this risk will no longer need to shoulder this additional cost. This is particularly important <b>for</b> <b>countries</b> whose currencies had traditionally fluctuated a great deal, particularly the Mediterranean nations.|$|E

5|$|As the Allied victory {{began to}} look certain, Keynes was heavily involved, {{as leader of the}} British {{delegation}} and chairman of the World Bank commission, in the mid-1944 negotiations that established the Bretton Woods system. The Keynes-plan, concerning an international clearing-union, argued for a radical system for the management of currencies. He proposed the creation of a common world unit of currency, the bancor, and new global institutions – a world central bank and the International Clearing Union. Keynes envisaged these institutions managing an international trade and payments system with strong incentives <b>for</b> <b>countries</b> to avoid substantial trade deficits or surpluses. The USA's greater negotiating strength, however, meant that the final outcomes accorded more closely to the more conservative plans of Harry Dexter White. According to US economist J. Bradford DeLong, on almost every point where he was overruled by the Americans, Keynes was later proved correct by events.|$|E
5|$|Member states remain optimistic of {{the union}} and key {{partners}} in the region, namely China, Iran, Turkey remain interested in it. A common belief is that the Eurasian Economic Union has significant potential {{over the next two}} decades, with experts predicting a 25 percent growth in the member states' GDP by 2030, which equates to over US$600 billion. The agreement will give member state citizens access to employment and education across the union. It will also entail collaborative policies in many sectors, including agriculture, energy, technology and transportation. These collaborative policies are particularly interesting <b>for</b> <b>countries</b> in Asia seeking access to energy, trade routes in Central Asia and Siberia, and agricultural goods.|$|E
5|$|The {{sale of the}} Olympic brand {{has been}} controversial. The {{argument}} is that the Games have become indistinguishable from any other commercialised sporting spectacle. Specific criticism was levelled at the IOC for market saturation during the 1996 Atlanta and 2000 Sydney Games. The cities were awash in corporations and merchants attempting to sell Olympic-related wares. The IOC {{indicated that they would}} address this to prevent spectacles of over-marketing at future Games. Another criticism is that the Games are funded by host cities and national governments; the IOC incurs none of the cost, yet controls all the rights and profits from the Olympic symbols. The IOC also takes a percentage of all sponsorship and broadcast income. Host cities continue to compete ardently for the right to host the Games, even though there is no certainty that they will earn back their investments. Research has shown that trade is around 30 percent higher <b>for</b> <b>countries</b> that have hosted the Olympics.|$|E
40|$|Background 2 ̆ 7 Caring <b>for</b> <b>Country</b> 2 ̆ 7 {{is defined}} as Indigenous {{participation}} in interrelated activities {{with the objective of}} promoting ecological and human health. Ecological services on Indigenous-owned lands are belatedly attracting some institutional investment. However, the health outcomes associated with Indigenous participation in 2 ̆ 7 caring <b>for</b> <b>country</b> 2 ̆ 7 activities have never been investigated. The aims of this study were to pilot and validate a questionnaire measuring caring <b>for</b> <b>country</b> as an Indigenous health determinant and to relate it to an external reference, obesity. MethodsPurposively sampled participants were 301 Indigenous adults aged 15 to 54 years, recruited during a cross-sectional program of preventive health checks in a remote Australian community. Questionnaire validation was undertaken with psychometric tests of internal consistency, reliability, exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory one-factor congeneric modelling. Accurate item weightings were derived from the model and used to create a single weighted composite score <b>for</b> caring <b>for</b> <b>country.</b> Multiple linear regression modelling was used to test associations between the caring <b>for</b> <b>country</b> score and body mass index adjusting for socio-demographic factors and health behaviours. ResultsThe questionnaire demonstrated adequate internal consistency, test-retest validity and proxy-respondent validity. Exploratory factor analysis of the 2 ̆ 7 caring <b>for</b> <b>country</b> 2 ̆ 7 items produced a single factor solution that was confirmed via one-factor congeneric modelling. A significant and substantial association between greater participation in caring <b>for</b> <b>country</b> activities and lower body mass index was demonstrated. Adjusting for socio-demographic factors and health behaviours, an inter-quartile range rise in caring <b>for</b> <b>country</b> scores was associated with 6. 1 Kg and 5. 3 Kg less body weight for non-pregnant women and men respectively. ConclusionThis study indicates preliminary support for the validity of the caring <b>for</b> <b>country</b> concept and a questionnaire designed to measure it. This study also highlights the importance of investigating Indigenous-asserted health promotion activities. Further studies in similar populations are merited to test the generalisability of this questionnaire and to explore associations with other important Indigenous health outcomes...|$|R
