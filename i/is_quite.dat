5|$|It {{is often}} {{difficult}} to find P. fimbriata in the wild, as its shape and movements are well disguised. The Queensland variety <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> easy to raise, while the Northern Territory variety <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> troublesome to maintain.|$|E
5|$|Faramir is also {{featured}} as a playable character in Lego Lord of the Rings, {{in which his}} role <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> similar to that played in the Peter Jackson films.|$|E
5|$|Infection {{of coastal}} stands of B.sessilis by the fungus Armillaria luteobubalina {{has also been}} recorded. The {{apparent}} infection rate of 0.31 <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> slow compared to the progress of other Armillaria species through pine plantations.|$|E
50|$|He <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> outspoken {{and could}} <b>be</b> <b>quite</b> blunt and {{sometimes}} inconsiderate with people he disagreed with. He {{was known to}} have <b>been</b> <b>quite</b> opinionated, sharp of tongue, and occasionally obnoxious, though he tried to portray himself as a strict religious figure.|$|R
60|$|The prince <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> {{captivated by}} the {{beautiful}} princess, and <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> {{willing to do anything}} whatsoever to get her for himself.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh, I <b>am</b> <b>quite</b> well,' she answered, {{with her}} sweetest, kindest voice; 'I <b>am</b> <b>quite</b> well, only {{sometimes}} I {{am a little}} weak.' ...|$|R
5|$|SQL null is a state, not a value. This usage <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> {{different}} from most programming languages, where null {{value of a}} reference means it is not pointing to any object.|$|E
5|$|The {{distribution}} of power plants around the country <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> broad, with the highest concentration in the Gobi desert and connected to the Northwest China Power Grid.|$|E
5|$|The {{mistle thrush}} <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> terrestrial, hopping with its head held up and body erect; when excited, it will flick its wings and tail. The flight {{consists}} of undulating bounds interspersed with glides.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I don't think I like American inventions, Arthur. I <b>am</b> <b>quite</b> sure I don't. I {{read some}} American novels lately, and they <b>were</b> <b>quite</b> nonsensical.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I <b>am</b> <b>quite</b> sure,' {{repeated}} Sissy, 'that it is {{the only}} reparation in your power, sir. I <b>am</b> <b>quite</b> sure, or I would not have come here.' ...|$|R
60|$|Maggie held Lucy's hands {{tightly in}} silence a little while. Her own hands <b>were</b> <b>quite</b> cold. But when she spoke, her voice <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> clear and distinct.|$|R
5|$|The rare Pacific Northwest morel Morchella hotsonii, {{known only}} from its type collection, <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> similar in {{appearance}} to M.importuna. The former species is distinguished by its finely velvety surface.|$|E
5|$|Timothy Spall as Mr. Poe, a stuffy banker {{whose job}} is to take the Baudelaire {{children}} to their guardians, but <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> incompetent at keeping them safe.|$|E
5|$|Archaeologists have {{discovered}} traces of platinum {{in the gold}} used in ancient Egyptian tombs and hieroglyphs as early as 1200 BC. However, the extent of early Egyptians' knowledge of the metal is unclear. It <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> possible they did not recognize there was platinum in their gold.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's in two words," [...] {{said the}} other. [...] "The new squire <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> poor when he bought. The old squire <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> rich when he sold." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{results of}} this first day <b>were</b> <b>quite</b> minor, the Allies could not bite {{significantly}} into the enemy's defensive system, and the casualties <b>were</b> <b>quite</b> severe: 66 killed and wounded.|$|R
60|$|P.S.--I <b>am</b> <b>quite</b> well; I {{hope you}} <b>are</b> <b>quite</b> well. The world {{is too much}} with us, and my mother bids me bind my hair and lace my bodice blue.|$|R
5|$|As a metal, {{titanium}} {{is recognized}} for its high strength-to-weight ratio. It {{is a strong}} metal with low density that <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> ductile (especially in an oxygen-free environment), lustrous, and metallic-white in color. The relatively high melting point (more than 1,650°C or 3,000°F) makes it useful as a refractory metal. It is paramagnetic and has fairly low electrical and thermal conductivity.|$|E
5|$|Elaborate body {{structures}} of many modern-day animals usually serve to attract {{members of the}} opposite sex during mating. It <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> possible that the sails or humps of these dinosaurs were used for courtship, in a way similar to a peacock's tail. Stromer speculated that males and females may have differed {{in the size of the}} neural spine.|$|E
5|$|Finally, it <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> {{possible}} that the sail or hump combined these functions, acting normally as a heat regulator, becoming a courting aid during the mating season, being used to cool itself and, on occasions, turning into an intimidating device when an animal was feeling threatened.|$|E
6000|$|I laughed, of course, {{but he had}} the air {{of being}} {{perfectly}} serious. [...] "It would <b>be</b> <b>quite</b> the best thing we could do. I should <b>be</b> <b>quite</b> ready to do it." ...|$|R
6000|$|But Lucy only cast {{a frightened}} glance around, and rising {{up with the}} accents of perfect sincerity, said, 'No, papa; I <b>am</b> <b>quite</b> ready; I <b>am</b> <b>quite</b> happy. I <b>was</b> only silly.' ...|$|R
60|$|Karl again {{shook his}} head. With Karl Bender, Harry <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> sure of his man, {{but not on}} that account need he <b>be</b> <b>quite</b> sure of the {{correctness}} of the man's opinion.|$|R
5|$|I {{sent the}} {{libretto}} of Suor Angelica to Maestro Puccini some days ago. He has declared himself– kind as he is– very satisfied... I have also finished a brief {{outline of a}} plot based on Gianni Schicchi. You know the Maestro's opinion of this subject, which is rich in possibilities and whose comic nature <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> out of the ordinary.|$|E
5|$|In 2015 and 2016 David had {{multiple}} guest appearances portraying 2016 U.S. presidential candidate Bernie Sanders on Saturday Night Live; he also hosted {{the show on}} February 6, 2016, with musical guest The 1975 and a cameo from Sanders himself. In the summer of 2017, it became known that through genealogical research, that Larry David <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> likely to actually be related to Bernie Sanders in some manner.|$|E
5|$|Ireland's Odonata fauna <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> {{different}} from that of Britain, with many fewer breeding species, but one additional species not found in Britain, Irish Damselfly Coenagrion lunulatum – see List of Odonata species of Ireland for more information.|$|E
60|$|If five-year-old Nellie had <b>been</b> <b>quite</b> well Mrs. Campbell {{would have}} taken both her and Mary Margaret and locked up the house. But Nellie had a very bad cold and <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> unfit to go sailing across the harbour on a raw, chilly November day. So {{there was nothing to}} do but leave Mary Margaret in charge, and Mary Margaret <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> pleased at the prospect.|$|R
30|$|Tibiofibula: {{slender and}} {{proportionally}} long tibiofibulae <b>are</b> <b>quite</b> {{abundant in the}} Grotta di Equi. They <b>are</b> <b>quite</b> elongated and clearly show the two sulci, sulcus proximalis and sulcus distalis, and the foramina nutritia.|$|R
6000|$|... 'You're a good fellow, Varden,' said Mr Haredale, 'and <b>are</b> <b>quite</b> right. I have brooded on {{that subject}} so long, that every breath of {{suspicion}} carries me back to it. You <b>are</b> <b>quite</b> right.' ...|$|R
5|$|Iron is {{the most}} widely used of all the metals, {{accounting}} for over 90% of worldwide metal production. Its low cost and high strength make it indispensable in engineering applications such as the construction of machinery and machine tools, automobiles, the hulls of large ships, and structural components for buildings. Since pure iron <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> soft, it is most commonly combined with alloying elements to make steel.|$|E
5|$|Lanthanum {{chemistry}} tends not {{to involve}} π bonding {{due to the}} electron configuration of the element: thus its organometallic chemistry <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> limited. The best characterized organolanthanum compounds are the cyclopentadienyl complex La(C5H5)3, which is produced by reacting anhydrous LaCl3 with NaC5H5 in tetrahydrofuran, and its methyl-substituted derivatives.|$|E
5|$|Like other platinum-group metal, bulk Pd <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> inert. Although contact {{dermatitis}} has been reported, {{data on the}} effects are limited. It {{has been shown that}} people with an allergic reaction to palladium also react to nickel, making it advisable to avoid the use of dental alloys containing palladium on those so allergic.|$|E

60|$|But Paddy the Beaver {{never is}} careless. He always chooses just {{the very best}} place. He makes {{sure that it is}} best before he begins. So now, {{although}} he <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> positive just where his house should be, he swam around the pond to make doubly sure. Then, when he <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> satisfied, he swam over to the place he had chosen. It was where the water <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> deep.|$|R
