40|$|Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is {{considered}} one of the most important infectious diseases of livestock because of the devastating economic consequences that it inflicts in affected regions. The value of critical parameters, such as the duration of the latency or the duration of the <b>infectious</b> <b>periods,</b> which affect the transmission rate of the FMD virus (FMDV), are believed to be influenced by characteristics of the host and the virus. Disease control and surveillance strategies, as well as FMD simulation models, will benefit from improved parameter estimation. The objective of this study was to quantify the distributions of variables associated with the duration of the latency, subclinical, incubation, and infectiousness periods of FMDV transmission. A double independent, systematic review of 19 retrieved publications reporting results from experimental trials, using 295 animals in four reference laboratories, was performed to extract individual values related to FMDV transmission. Probability density functions were fitted to data and a set of regression models were used to identify factors associated with the assessed parameters. Latent, subclinical, incubation, and <b>infectious</b> <b>periods</b> ranged from 3. 1 to 4. 8, 2 to 2. 3, 5. 5 to 6. 6, and 3. 3 to 5. 7 days, respectively.

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} a great {{increase}} in work on epidemiological modelling, driven partly by the increase in the availability and power of computers, but also by the desire to improve standards of public and animal health. Through modelling, understanding of the mechanisms of previous epidemics can be gained, and the lessons learnt applied to make predictions about future epidemics, or emerging diseases. The standard SIR model is in some sense quite a simplistic model, and can lack realism. One solution to this problem is to increase the complexity of the model, or to perform full scale simulation—an experiment in silico. This thesis, however, takes a different approach and makes an in depth analysis of one small improvement to the model: the replacement of a constant birth rate with a birth pulse. This more accurately describes the seasonal birth patterns observed in many animal populations. The combination of the nonlinearities of the SIR model and the strong seasonal forcing provided by the birth pulse necessitate the use of numerical methods. The model shows complex multi annual cycles of epidemics and even chaos for shorter <b>infectious</b> <b>periods.</b> The robustness of these results are proven with respect to a wide range or perturbations: in phase space, in the shape and temporal extent of the birth pulse and in the underlying model to which the pulsing is applied. To complement the numerics, analytic methods are used to gain further understanding of the dynamics in particular areas of the chosen parameter space where the numerics can be challenging.

Such diseases tend to occur in cycles of outbreaks due to the variation in number of susceptibles (S(t)) over time.

The disease cannot break out again until the number of susceptibles has built back up as a result of offspring being born into the susceptible compartment.Each member of the population typically progresses from susceptible to infectious to removed.

When an increasing number of local health authorities began using the rapid HIV test, Checkpoint had served its purpose and could be closed down. The rapid HIV test enabled a reliable outcome to be generated within 15 to 20 minutes, which in practice lowered the threshold for such testing. Because in this way more people opted for testing, more HIV-positive people could be reached. A clear advantage is that the diagnosis is made at the earliest possible stage of the infection, facilitating adequate treatment. In addition, through successful early treatment, the <b>infectious</b> <b>period</b> for HIV-positive people can be reduced.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The flaviviruses causing tick-borne {{encephalitis}} (TBE) persist at low but consistent levels in tick populations, despite short <b>infectious</b> <b>periods</b> in their mammalian hosts and transmission periods constrained by distinctly seasonal tick life cycles. In addition to systemic and vertical transmission, cofeeding transmission {{has been proposed}} as an important route for the persistence of TBE-causing viruses. Because cofeeding transmission requires ticks to feed simultaneously, the timing of tick activity may be critical to pathogen persistence. Existing models of tick-borne diseases do not incorporate all transmission routes and tick seasonality. Our aim is to evaluate the influence of seasonality on {{the relative importance of}} different transmission routes by using a comprehensive mathematical model. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We developed a stage-structured population model that includes tick seasonality and evaluated the relative importance of the transmission routes for pathogens with short <b>infectious</b> <b>periods,</b> in particular Powassan virus (POWV) and the related "deer tick virus," emergent encephalitis-causing flaviviruses in North America. We used the next generation matrix method to calculate the basic reproductive ratio and performed elasticity analyses. We confirmed that cofeeding transmission is critically important for such pathogens to persist in seasonal tick populations over the reasonable range of parameter values. At higher but still plausible rates of vertical transmission, our model suggests that vertical transmission can strongly enhance pathogen prevalence when it operates in combination with cofeeding transmission. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results demonstrate that the consistent prevalence of POWV observed in tick populations could be maintained by a combination of low vertical, intermediate cofeeding and high systemic transmission rates. When vertical transmission is weak, nymphal ticks support integral parts of the transmission cycle that are critical for maintaining the pathogen. We also extended the model to pathogens that cause chronic infections in hosts and found that cofeeding transmission could contribute to elevating prevalence even in these systems. Therefore, the common assumption that cofeeding transmission is not relevant in models of chronic host infection, such as Lyme disease, could lead to underestimating pathogen prevalence...|$|R
