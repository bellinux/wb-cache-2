25|$|Gibbs {{made his}} {{first-class}} debut in 1953–54, playing for British Guiana against MCC {{at his home}} ground of Bourda. In MCC's first (and indeed only) innings, he bowled Denis Compton for 18 to leave the tourists precariously poised at 51/3. Gibbs also took the wicket of Tom Graveney – but by then a mammoth fourth-wicket partnership of 402 between Graveney and Willie Watson had propelled MCC towards an innings victory, so Gibbs did not <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>chance</b> to bowl.|$|E
25|$|On February 16, 1926, the 20-year-old Wills met Suzanne Lenglen, six-time Wimbledon champion, in {{the final}} of a tournament at the Carlton Club in Cannes. It {{was the only time}} they played each other. Public {{anticipation}} of their match was immense, resulting in high scalper ticket prices. Roofs and windows of nearby buildings were crowded with spectators, including the King Gustaf V of Sweden. Both players were nervous, with Lenglen drinking brandy and water at one point to calm her nerves. Lenglen won the match 6–3, 8–6 after being down 2–1 in the first set and 5–4 in the second set. Wills had a set point in the second set and believed she had won the point, but a linesman disagreed. In {{one of the few times}} she showed emotion on court, she spoke angrily to the linesman over the call. After the match, Lenglen's father advised her that she would lose her next match to Wills if they met again soon, and Lenglen avoided Wills for the remainder of the spring. Wills did not <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>chance</b> to meet Lenglen. Wills had an emergency appendectomy during the 1926 French Championships, which caused her to default her second round match and withdraw from Wimbledon, which also was considered a default. Lenglen turned professional after the 1926 season.|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} to {{the episode}} was moderately positive, although several reviewers criticized the episode's monologues. Television Without Pity writer Jessica Morgan rated the episode a [...] "B+". Morgan criticized the episode's narrative, sardonically noting that Martin Wells was a [...] "man who may <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>chance.</b> At life. At truth. At pretentious, overlong monologues." [...] Juliette Harrisson of Den of Geek wrote positively of the episode, calling it [...] "an excellent backwards episode, {{in which the}} audience is left satisfied that the horrific event that sparked it off has been prevented, but the guest protagonist has to pay {{a high price for}} the happy outcome." [...] However, she was slightly critical that the episode [...] "barely features the regular characters at all". Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a moderately positive review and awarded it three stars out of four. She called the episode [...] "a double mystery: on one hand Martin's investigation of his wife's murder; and on the other, an investigation into the workings of his own soul." [...] Vitaris, too, was critical of the ending monologue, noting that [...] "the voiceover ruins the mood of the final shot." ...|$|E
