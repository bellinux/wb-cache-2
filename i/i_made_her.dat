2500|$|By September 1943, Disney {{assigned}} Dick Huemer and Joe Grant {{to begin}} work on Cinderella as story supervisors and given a preliminary budget of $1 million. However, by 1945, their preliminary story work was halted. During the writing stages of Song of the South, Dalton S. Reymond and Maurice Rapf entered into a personal dispute, in which Raft was reassigned to write for Cinderella. In his version, Cinderella was written to be a less passive character than Snow White, and more rebellious against her stepfamily. Raft explained, [...] "My thinking was you can't have somebody who comes in and changes everything for you. You can't be delivered it on a platter. You've got to earn it. So in my version, the Fairy Godmother said, 'It's okay till midnight but from then in it's up to you.' <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>her</b> earn it, and {{what she had to}} do achieve it was to rebel against her stepmother and stepsisters, to stop being a slave in her own home. So I had a scene where they're ordering her around and she throws the stuff back at them. She revolts, so they lock her up in the attic. I don't think anyone took (my idea) very seriously." ...|$|E

2500|$|Melkman, Mor-Salwo, Mangold, Zeller, & Benbenishty (2015) used a {{grounded}} theory approach to understand 1) the motivations and experiences which led young adult [...] "careleavers" [...] (N = 28, aged 18–26) in Israel and Germany {{to assume a}} helper role and 2) the benefits they report enjoying {{as a result of}} helping others through volunteerism and/or human-service focused careers. Participants reported that observing role models involved in helping roles, being exposed to prosocial values, and having opportunities to volunteer within the system in which they were simultaneously receiving care all contributed to later assumption of more stable and regular helping roles. These participants felt obliged to provide assistance to others, desired to provide this assistance to others, and felt sufficiently competent to carry out the tasks required of them in their helping role. These participants reported that helping others provided them with a sense of purpose in their lives, and also increased self-efficacy, social connectedness, and ability to cope with personal issues. Additionally, participants reported that assuming a helping role provided a sense of normalcy to their lives, as well as providing a sense of perspective on their own journey and outcomes. As one participant (a volunteer with a police department who was assigned to work with at-risk youth) shared with the researchers:"The fact that I could bring a runaway girl back to her home and <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>her</b> trust me, the fact that I located a missing girl, the fact that I escorted a rape victim to hospital and I managed to give her strength and support her, {{these are the things that}} give me meaning, tell me that I'm in a much better situation than others" [...] (p. 45).|$|E
