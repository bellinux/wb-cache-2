Later that same year, Shahrbaraz advanced on Chalcedon on the Bosphoros {{and attempted to}} capture Constantinople {{with the help of}} Persia's Avar and Slavic allies. In this siege of Constantinople in 626, the combined Sassanid, Slavic and Avar forces failed to capture the Byzantine capital city. The Avars did not <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>patience</b> or technology to conquer the city. On top of that, the Persians, who were siege warfare experts, were unable to transport their troops and equipment {{to the other side of}} the Bosphorus where their Slavic and Avar allies were located, due to heavy guarding of the strait by the Byzantine navy. Furthermore, the walls of Constantinople easily defended against the siege towers and engines. Another reason was that the Persians and Slavs did not have a strong enough navy to ignore the sea walls and establish a channel of communication. The lack of supplies for the Avars eventually caused them to abandon the siege. As this maneuver failed, his forces were defeated, and he withdrew his army from Anatolia later in 628.|$|E

25|$|Journalists {{were able}} to play The Last Guardian at the Electronic Entertainment Expo 2016 and the 2016 Tokyo Game Show {{in the months before}} the game's release, and several {{expressed}} further concerns {{about the nature of the}} game's lengthy development period. Patrick Garrett, writing for VG247, found that the visuals felt flat and aged considering modern hardware capabilities, and expressed concern that while older gamers would readily purchase the title, The Last Guardian may not draw in enough newer gamers to be a commercial success. Philip Kollar for Polygon, though still impressed with the characters, graphics, and core gameplay, found controlling the character difficult and managing the game's camera tricky, elements that made the game feel like a PlayStation 2 title rather than something on modern hardware. Wireds Chris Kohler found much of the demo to require patient observation of Trico's movements and puzzle solving, which, he commented, some players would appreciate but were elements that have slowly been phased out of action games over the last console generation, and other players may not <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>patience</b> for these. Brian Ashcroft of Kotaku also noted that the demo's pace was often set by how fast Trico would respond or react, which may test the patience of players looking for a more action-based experience.|$|E

500|$|The game's mission {{design and}} {{progression}} system received mixed reviews. According to Parkin, the chaos system {{did not make}} sense; Rico sometimes destroys properties which help local citizens.

Parkin and VanOrd criticized the stronghold-takeover missions. Parkin added that most players probably would not <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>patience</b> to complete the settlements, since the island's appeal wanes after hours of play. Marchiafava praised the game's side activities, saying that the diversions increased its replayability. Davis criticized the missions' repetition, but liked their quantity.|$|E

He cited surrealist films Eraserhead and Un Chien Andalou (as mentioned in [...] "Debaser") as major influences on his work with the Pixies; however, surrealism was less of an influence in his solo career.

500|$|According to biographer John Baxter, Kubrick {{had shown}} an {{interest}} in directing a pornographic film based on a satirical novel written by Terry Southern, entitled Blue Movie, about a director who makes Hollywood's first big-budget porn film. However, Baxter claims that Kubrick concluded {{that he did not}} <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>patience</b> or temperament to become involved in the porn industry, and Southern stated that Kubrick was [...] "too ultra conservative" [...] towards sexuality to have seriously gone ahead with it, but liked the idea. Kubrick was unable to direct a film of Umberto Eco's Foucault's Pendulum as Eco had given his publisher instructions to never sell the film rights to any of his books after his dissatisfaction with the film version of The Name of the Rose. Also, when the film rights to Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings were sold to United Artists, the Beatles approached Kubrick to direct them in a film based on the books, but Kubrick was unwilling to produce a film based on a very popular book. Director Peter Jackson has reported that Tolkien was against the involvement of the Beatles.|$|E

500|$|Reviewers also {{praised the}} game's varied {{scenarios}} and replayability. Dora from Jay Is Games praised the game, saying that [...] "with {{a huge amount}} of replay value, creativity to burn, and some of the most shocking plot lines you could ever hope to encounter, Hatoful Boyfriend is a fascinating and surprising text adventure well worth checking out", though she also observes that [...] "the delayed payoff and the abruptness of some of the endings combined with the oddball concept may not appeal to every fan of the visual novel genre". Alexa Ray Corriea's Polygon review of the remake gave it an 8 out of 10, concluding that the [...] "witty dialogue and absolutely bonkers scenarios are genuinely fun to discover, and the handful of different storylines make repeated playthroughs worthwhile". Some critics however expressed concerns over the presence of some repetitive aspects of gameplay—noted as being especially apparent when attempting multiple playthroughs—as well as the accessibility of the game's Bad Boys Love scenario to casual players: in his review of the remake for PC Gamer, Julian Murdoch states that [...] "I suspect few will <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>patience</b> to ride the fast forward button and suss out the romantic proclivities of each cast member to get to the extended ending—really a second half—of the game".|$|E
500|$|Carnivàle {{was often}} {{compared}} to David Lynch's 1990s mystery TV series Twin Peaks and John Steinbeck's 1939 novel The Grapes of Wrath.

[...] She argued that a [...] "surreal Twin Peaks-style shockfest [...] hardly bears repeating," [...] especially if it [...] "avoid the 'hugging and learning' of mainstream television [...] such a steady diet of anguish and dashed hopes that viewers refuse to take the risk of making an emotional connection."

2500|$|In the United States, {{the special}} was rated TV-MA, while {{the series is}} rated TV-14.

[...] According to Neely and Weidenfeld, the network forced them to cut smoking out of the show; Jack Falgot, a character in the series, was planned to smoke on a cigarette in every scene he appeared in.

[...] All of this is to say that the Christian must <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>patience</b> to get through tough times. To him, the ultimate display of courage is through the martyr, who is “required to patiently persevere, since they have the confidence that enduring wrong is the gift of charity." [...] The philosopher also highlighted that true courage is a gift of the Holy Spirit when he said that “courage is a gift of the Spirit that protects the martyr from the ‘dread of danger.’" [...] The martyr is the best example because they believe that “God will complete God’s work in [...] even if [...] lives are taken by [...] enemies."

2500|$|Bankhead {{returned}} to the United States in 1931, but Hollywood success eluded her in her first four films of the 1930s. She rented a home at 1712 Stanley Street, in Hollywood, and began hosting parties that were said to [...] "have no boundaries". Bankhead's first film was Tarnished Lady (1931), directed by George Cukor and the pair became fast friends. Bankhead behaved herself on the set and filming went smoothly, but she found film-making to be very boring and did not <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>patience</b> for it. She did not like Hollywood, either; when she met producer Irving Thalberg, she asked him, [...] "How do you get laid in this dreadful place?" [...] Thalberg retorted, [...] "I'm sure you'll have no problem. Ask anyone." [...] Although Bankhead was not very interested in making films, {{the opportunity to make}} $50,000 per film was too good to pass up. Her 1932 movie Devil and the Deep is notable for the presence of three major co-stars, with Bankhead receiving top billing over Gary Cooper, Charles Laughton, and Cary Grant; it is the only film with Cooper and Grant as the film's leading men. She later said, [...] "Dahling, the main reason I accepted [...] was to fuck that divine Gary Cooper!" [...] Later in 1932, Bankhead starred opposite Robert Montgomery in Faithless.|$|E

In many ways it's a typical effort from the guitarist Omar Rodriguez-Lopez and the vocalist Cedric Bixler-Zavala, {{who make up the}} Mars Volta's core. But that's not to discredit the more measured side of Octahedron. Presented as an eight-song suite, the album delivers a panoramic range of intensity, sliding along that range in ways both gradual and startling." [...] BBC Music gave it an average review and said that the album [...] "shows the band maintaining a frighteningly productive work rate... while continuing to mature. [...] Its vaulting ambition demands over-inflated self-confidence. And MV have that in spades." [...] Uncut also gave it a score of three stars out of five and said, [...] "As ever with The Mars Volta, there are enough flashes of brilliance {{to make up for the}} wearying material elsewhere." [...] Q likewise gave the album three stars out of five and said it [...] "bucks the band's trend for obfuscation, though; conventional song structures are very much in evidence, while its relatively trim 49-minute running time is on par with some of Mars Volta's more involved live jams."
