30|$|A {{review on}} CMOS delay lines {{with a focus}} on the most {{frequently}} used techniques for high-resolution delay step is presented. The primary types, specifications, <b>delay</b> <b>circuits,</b> and operating principles are presented. The <b>delay</b> <b>circuits</b> reported in this paper are used for delaying digital inputs and clock signals. The most common analog and digitally-controlled delay elements topologies are presented, focusing on the main delay-tuning strategies. IC variables, namely, process, supply voltage, temperature, and noise sources that affect delay resolution through timing jitter are discussed. The design specifications of these delay elements are also discussed and compared for the common <b>delay</b> line <b>circuits.</b> As a result, the main findings of this paper are highlighting and discussing the followings: the most efficient high-resolution delay line techniques, the trade-off challenge found between CMOS delay lines designed using either analog or digitally-controlled delay elements, the trade-off challenge between delay resolution and delay range and the proposed solutions for this challenge, and how CMOS technology scaling can affect the performance of CMOS delay lines. Moreover, the current trends and efforts used in order to generate output delayed signal with low jitter in the sub-picosecond range are presented.|$|R

The essential ingredients of the ISI Reading Unit (IRU) are (i) a tunable time <b>delay</b> <b>circuit</b> modelled after one found in the anterior forebrain pathway of the birdsong system and (ii) a recently observed rule for inhibitory synaptic plasticity.

We investigate the ability of this IRU to learn in the presence of two kinds of noise: jitter in the time of each spike and random spikes occurring in the ideal spike sequence. We also discuss how the circuit can be detuned by removing the selected ISI sequence and replacing it by an ISI sequence with ISIs drawn from a probability distribution.
