40|$|This thesis {{considers}} {{the concept of}} Quality of Experience (QoE) {{in the context of}} mobile electronic consumer devices, such as smartphones. The modern smartphone is expected to deliver a high level of <b>user</b> <b>experience</b> across a wide variety of tasks, whilst remaining as power efficient as possible. Commonly, mobile devices undergo runtime optimisation to achieve the required level of performance, with the energy consumption being a secondary concern. In this thesis, we stress that it is vital to not focus on the raw performance of the device, but instead to concentrate on the needs and desires of the end user. This approach ensures that the end-user is satisfied at all times, and that the power consumption for a given level of <b>user</b> <b>experience</b> is minimised. Hence, we advocate user-experience-aware system optimisation. We introduce the concept of Quality of Experience, which has traditionally been used only in the telecommunications industry, to mobile system optimisation. We <b>develop</b> <b>user</b> <b>experience</b> models in the form of utility functions, and use these to translate lowlevel metrics into the delivered <b>user</b> <b>experience.</b> Upon these models we build simple, yet effective, QoE-aware Central Processing Unit (CPU) and Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) governing algorithms which adjust the performance and power consumption at runtime to meet <b>user</b> <b>experience</b> requirements. When creating our algorithms, we first analyse and characterise the operation of both CPU and GPU workloads. Specifically, we investigate how the level of compute-boundedness or memory-boundedness of CPU workloads affects frequency scalability, as well as determining how the available bandwidth and core count for a GPU affects the rendering performance. We combine both gem 5 -based simulation driven analysis and hardware-based verification in order to validate our QoE-aware governing algorithms. Additionally, we validate the operation of our algorithms using a variety of common mobile workloads. As part of this work, we have also extended the gem 5 simulator to allow use to investigate the potential for finegrained Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) adjustment, and use this as a platform to investigate the operation of the Linux CPUFreq governors used on modern mobile platforms...|$|R

40|$|Cloud gaming {{architecture}} {{has been}} proposed and deployed in large-scale com- mercial systems in recent years. It renders and encodes video views on cloud servers, with the resulting video streamed through network to end devices. This approach {{has the advantage of}} relieving high computation, power and storage requirements of gaming from end devices. The challenge therefore shifts to streaming high quality video with low latency through fluctuating network. In this thesis, we extend the basic cloud gaming architecture in three aspects. First, we consider not only gaming as target application, but also consider much more virtual immersive applications, such as virtual classroom and virtual art gallery, etc. Second, with the development of ubiquitous wireless network for mobile devices, we specifically consider streaming the video through mobile wireless network. Third, with the growing popularity of mobile auto-stereoscopic 3 D displays, we consider capture, record and stream two views (left and right views) in the virtual world so that it can render 3 D views on mobile 3 D displays. To conclude, we term our extended architecture as cloud mobile 3 D display virtual immersive application architecture. Because 3 D videos contain two views that doubles video bit rate requirement for the same quality versus 2 D video, and also because mobile wireless network is much more fluctuating than wired and WiFi network, streaming high quality 3 D video with low latency becomes much more challenging. In this thesis, based on prior research results that show human brain can compensate perceived video quality automatically when one of the views is of inferior quality, we propose asymmetric rendering where we tune graphics rendering quality to be asymmetric in rendering engine. We <b>develop</b> both <b>user</b> <b>experience</b> models and bit rate models by applying different rendering settings and conducting subjective tests. We further develop optimization algorithms which use the above two models to automatically decide the optimal rendering settings for left view and right view to ensure the best <b>user</b> <b>experience</b> given the network conditions. Experiments conducted using real 4 G-LTE network profiles on commercial cloud service with different genres of applications demonstrate significant improvement in <b>user</b> <b>experience</b> when the proposed technology is applied...|$|R

There {{has been a great}} attempt to study and design <b>user</b> <b>experiences.</b> This thesis gives a practical view to <b>user</b> <b>experience</b> studies and methods by reporting test settings and results of the ADAMOS case studies. The goal of the ADAMOS project was to investigate context- and action-sensitive services in terms of how <b>users</b> <b>experience</b> when the system can detect one’s location and actions, and then adjust according to this information. The aim of this thesis is to investigate problems and issues in studying <b>user</b> <b>experiences</b> of mobile services and to find out in which conditions the study of <b>user</b> <b>experience</b> is possible and meaningful. As a contribution this thesis provides practical information for conducting <b>user</b> <b>experience</b> studies and evaluating experiences. The first contribution is a framework (U 2 E-Frame), which I created and improved iteratively in each test case. The framework is method-independent and it can be used for planning and conducting tests. The second contribution of the thesis is the practical view to all methods that are created, applied, presented and evaluated in this thesis. Especially during this thesis work three novel methods (Mobile Feedback, 3 E-Diary and SUE methodology) have been developed and evaluated. The evaluation of the research methods illustrates that the best practice to study <b>user</b> <b>experience</b> is to use several methods together. This enables deeper understanding of <b>user</b> <b>experiences.</b> As the third contribution of this thesis I introduce a proposal of ten <b>user</b> <b>experience</b> heuristics for design and evaluation of <b>user</b> <b>experiences.</b> The aim of these heuristics is to enable designers to understand what meaning <b>user</b> <b>experience</b> has in product design. Developers can use these heuristics for designing and evaluating <b>user</b> <b>experience</b> aspects in product design. This thesis presents the main challenges in <b>user</b> <b>experience</b> research: know what to study (comprehensive <b>user</b> <b>experience),</b> know how to study it (find appropriate methods) and know how to evaluate and design it (<b>user</b> <b>experience</b> heuristics). An answer to the research problem is that it is both possible and meaningful to study <b>user</b> <b>experience</b> when we know <b>user</b> <b>experience</b> targets, and features of the services we want to investigate, and we can use the most appropriate methods, ensure the participant’s commitment to the test and ensure analysing relationships between results collected with different methods...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the past}} few years, {{there has been an}} {{increased}} number of media applications that have migrated to the cloud, which will enable mobile users to engage in rich media experiences from any mobile platform. In this research, we develop techniques to model and enhance the quality of service for two cloud mobile media applications: Cloud Mobile Rendering (CMR) application and HTTP-based adaptive video streaming. In CMR application, compute intensive graphic rendering is performed on cloud servers, and the rendered video is encoded and transmitted through wireless network to mobile devices. Although promising to address the computation and battery limits of mobile devices, this approach suffers from challenges posed by limited and unstable wireless bandwidth, such {{that it is difficult to}} ensure the quality of service. In this research, we first develop a model to quantitatively measure the <b>user</b> <b>experience</b> of CMR application, considering rendering factors, encoding factors and network factors simultaneously. Secondly we derive several techniques to enhance the quality of service, including a) an adaptive rendering technique which dynamically select the optimal rendering factor based on network condition; b) a prioritized encoding technique which allocates bits among different regions of video frame depending on their priorities; c) an encoding acceleration technique which utilizes rendering information to reduce the computation complexity of video encoding while maintaining the video quality. In HTTP-based adaptive video streaming, video content are split into a sequence of small segments, which are encoded into several versions with different bit rates and quality, and streamed according to the requests from streaming client. The version of video segments will keep varying according to the available bandwidth. Flucating bandwidth will lead to temporal artifacts such as video rebuffering (freezing), and spatial artifacts such as visual quality variation. In this thesis, we <b>develop</b> the first <b>user</b> <b>experience</b> model for this application through extensive subjective experiments. We validate with high accuracy the <b>user</b> <b>experience</b> model, and demonstrates its applicability to video with different length and motion characteristics...|$|R

It provides key research findings which inform the improvement of systems for the people. Human-computer interaction extends its study towards more integrated interactions, such as tangible interactions, which is generally not covered {{in the practice of}} <b>user</b> <b>experience.</b> <b>User</b> <b>experience</b> cannot be manufactured or designed; it has to be incorporated in the design. Understanding the user's emotional quotient plays a key role while designing a <b>user</b> <b>experience.</b> The first step while designing the <b>user</b> <b>experience</b> is determining the reason a visitor will be visiting the website or use the application in question. Then the <b>user</b> <b>experience</b> can be designed accordingly.|$|R
