50|$|On July 7, 2010, Toyota {{recalled}} 270,000 Lexus and Crown vehicles worldwide for improperly manufactured valve springs. According to Toyota, {{the condition}} can cause rough idling and potential <b>engine</b> <b>stalling.</b>|$|E
50|$|Toyota {{announced}} a voluntary recall of 2005 to 2008 Toyota Corollas and Matrixes equipped with 1ZZ-FE engines. The issue involves the engine control module, and includes {{the potential for}} it to develop a crack on the module's circuit board, which can result in the car not starting, the transmission shifting harshly, or the <b>engine</b> <b>stalling.</b> Additionally, Pontiac {{announced a}} voluntary recall of Pontiac Vibes from years 2005 to 2008 for the same issue.|$|E
50|$|The {{benefits}} of turbine engines as explained by Chrysler engineers were reduced maintenance, longer engine life expectancy, large development potential, overall parts reduction of approximately 80% (60 parts rather than 300)., requirements for tune ups nearly eliminated, low temperature starting difficulties eliminated and no warm up needed, antifreeze not required, interior heat is available instantly in winter, no <b>engine</b> <b>stalling</b> with sudden overload, engine operates without vibration, oil consumption is negligible, reduced engine weight, exhaust gases are cool and less pollutant, and most importantly, {{a wide range}} of combustible fuels may be employed as a replacement for petroleum gasoline.|$|E
50|$|In June 1999, Cochrane was {{involved}} in a light plane crash in Montreal, after his plane's <b>engine</b> <b>stalled</b> just after take-off. No one was injured.|$|R

50|$|Worldwide:June 2005: <b>Engine</b> <b>stalls</b> {{linked to}} faulty wirings on 6.0L Powerstroke Diesel engines have caused {{hundreds}} of thousands of 2004-2005 Ford Super Duty, Excursion, and Econoline models to be recalled.|$|R
50|$|Refuelling was {{permitted}} from the 1994 season {{until the end}} of the 2009 season. During this period, a pit stop involved about twenty mechanics, with the aim of completing the stop as quickly as possible. Stops generally lasted for six to twelve seconds depending on how much fuel is put into the car. However, if there is a problem, such as a fuel pump failing or the <b>engine</b> <b>stalling,</b> or repairs having to be made, it can take much longer. Cars were fuelled at a rate of more than 12 litres per second. This was accomplished by a fairly complex closed system that pumped air out of the car's fuel tank as the fuel was being pumped in.|$|E
50|$|Childers {{boarding}} party arrived aboard SIEV 36 at 06:15. Shortly after, {{the passengers}} found the notice, and, assuming {{that they would}} be sent back to Indonesia, became agitated. Salt was poured into the boat's diesel <b>engine,</b> <b>stalling</b> it, and one of the petrol canisters was spread on the deck. Reinforcements were sent from Childers to restore control, and boarded shortly before the petrol was ignited; the resulting explosion tore the boat apart. RHIBs from the two patrol boats focused on recovering the nine Australian Defence Force personnel first, then began recovering others. Five passengers were killed, and many of the survivors were heavily burned; the two patrol boats sailed to the tanker Front Puffin, from where the wounded were heli-lifted to hospitals ashore.|$|E
50|$|On October 21, 2010, Toyota {{announced}} a recall of 1.53 million vehicles (740,000 in the U.S., 599,000 in Japan, and 191,000 in Europe and other markets) worldwide; the recall effects MY 2005 and 2006 Avalon, MY 2004 to 2006 Highlander (non-hybrid) and Lexus RX330 and MY 2006 Lexus GS300, IS250 and IS350; the models affected in Japan and elsewhere (except the U.S.) include MY 2002 to 2006 Toyota Crown, Crown Majesta, Harrier, Mark X, Alphard, Kluger and Lexus GS350, IS250 and IS350. The recall concerns brake fluid leakage from the master cylinder (U.S. market and non U.S. marketed Toyota Crown and Lexus GS350) and an electrical {{problem with the}} fuel pump, which would cause <b>engine</b> <b>stalling</b> (all markets except the U.S.).|$|E
50|$|In {{the case}} of a petrol (gasoline) or Diesel <b>engine,</b> the <b>stall</b> torque may refer to the torque load that causes the <b>engine</b> to <b>stall.</b> The actual amount of torque is {{dependent}} on engine RPM and throttle opening.|$|R
40|$|Turbocharger {{has been}} widely {{implemented}} for internal combustion engine to increase an engine's power output and reduce fuel consumption. However, its operating temperature would rise to 340 °C when <b>engine</b> <b>stalls.</b> This higher temperature may results in bearing wear, run-out, and stick, due to oil coking and insufficient lubrication. In order to overcome these problems, this paper employs Electric Water Pump (EWP) to supply cool liquid to turbocharger actively when the <b>engine</b> <b>stalls.</b> The system layout, operating timing, and duration of EWP are investigated for obtaining optimal performance. The primarily experimental {{results show that the}} proposed layout and control strategy have a lower temperature of 100 °C than the conventional temperature 225 °C...|$|R
40|$|The highly {{integrated}} digital {{electronic control}} (HIDEC) program will demonstrate {{and evaluate the}} improvements in performance and mission effectiveness that result from integrated engine-airframe control systems. Performance improvements will result from an adaptive <b>engine</b> <b>stall</b> margin mode, a highly integrated mode that uses the airplane flight conditions and the resulting inlet distortion to continuously compute <b>engine</b> <b>stall</b> margin. When there is excessive <b>stall</b> margin, the <b>engine</b> is uptrimmed for more thrust by increasing engine pressure ratio (EPR). The EPR uptrim logic has been evaluated and implemente into computer simulations. Thrust improvements over 10 percent are predicted for subsonic flight conditions. The EPR uptrim was successfully demonstrated during engine ground tests. Test results verify model predictions at the conditions tested...|$|R
5000|$|Some manumatic and {{semi-automatic}} transmissions {{allow the}} driver to have full control of gear selection, though most will intervene to prevent <b>engine</b> <b>stalling</b> and redlining by shifting automatically {{at the low end}} and/or high end of the engine's normal operating range. Hydraulically-coupled Manumatics and most semi-automatic transmissions also provide the option of operating {{in the same manner as}} a conventional automatic transmission, by allowing the transmission's computer to select gear changes. A few manumatics also allow an alternate automatic mode, often called [...] "sport" [...] mode, where gear selection is still fully automatic but the transmission will favor higher engine speeds (at which the engine will produce the highest horsepower and/or torque) by upshifting later when accelerating and downshifting earlier when slowing.|$|E
50|$|The {{force of}} the moving water may {{be strong enough to}} {{physically}} push the vehicle off the bridge: the higher the percentage of the vehicle in the water, the more likely the water's force will take the vehicle off the bridge and send it downriver with substantial damage. An additional risk for trying to cross a bridge under water, especially when {{more than a couple of}} feet deep, is the possibilty of the vehicle's <b>engine</b> <b>stalling.</b> As people will typically try to then get out of the vehicle, they may step into water currents that cause them to fall or be pulled down into the water. As the current during floods is often quite strong, it may sweep them downriver and carry them into debris, possibly causing injury or death.|$|E
5000|$|In 1995, General Motors {{was ordered}} to recall 470,000 model year 1991 through 1995 Cadillacs and pay an $11 million fine for {{programming}} the car's electronic control unit (ECU) to enrich the fuel mixture any time the car's air conditioning or cabin heat was operating, since the EPA tests are conducted with those systems turned off. The richer fuel mixture was needed to address an <b>engine</b> <b>stalling</b> problem, resulting in emissions of up to 10 grams per mile of carbon monoxide (CO), nearly three times the limit of 3.4 g/mi. While the EPA and Justice Department contended that GM intentionally violated emissions standards, GM said that was [...] "a matter of interpretation." [...] Besides the fine, the second largest Clean Air Act penalty to date in 1995, GM had to spend up to $34 million for anti-pollution programs and recall 470,000 Cadillac 4.9 liter Eldorados, Fleetwoods, DeVilles, and Sevilles. The largest civil penalty under the Clean Air Act was $11.1 million paid by Louisiana-Pacific lumber and paper company.|$|E
50|$|On lap 131, Tom Sneva, {{who fell}} 35 laps down after his <b>engine</b> <b>stall</b> on lap 58, got {{taken out of}} the race by a blown engine. He stopped his car in turn 4, {{entering}} the pit lane. He climbed out of his car and his car was towed off. Sneva, after having the best car, was frustratedly out of the race with a broken clutch in his engine. In an interview with Chris Economaki minutes later, Sneva said that the <b>engine</b> <b>stall</b> happened because he couldn't get the car in gear and once the problem was fixed the engine began to have problems and finally came apart on Sneva's 96th lap completed.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{discloses}} {{opportunities of}} how information recorded by on-board recorders of flight parameters {{can be used}} for investigation of avionic events. An example of the methodical approach is presented of how to verify data acquired from flight recorders, which unambiguously indicates the feasibility of further investigation and analyses of avionic events that may happen to aircrafts. Subsequently the effect of the <b>engine</b> <b>stall</b> is outlined, which enables analysis of those avionic events when the effect of <b>engine(s)</b> <b>stall</b> took place. The paper discloses two cases of avionic events when <b>engine</b> <b>stall</b> was the underlying reason of problems, i. e. when a helicopter entered a stream of exhaust gases produced by a missile launched by that helicopter and when icing of the intake channel occurred in a turbojet engine installed on a helicopter. Investigations of that type are indispensable due to operation constraints and technical conditions of aircrafts operations, where meeting these conditions is the principal requirements in terms of flight safety. This study confirms that opportunities to use data from on-board recorders of flight parameters {{to find out what was}} going on with the aircrafts during avionic events are considerable...|$|R
50|$|As Jake {{was making}} an {{emergency}} run, his plane's <b>engines</b> <b>stalls,</b> {{causing him to}} lose control and crash in the Alaska wilderness. Frustrated {{by the lack of}} search effort by the police, Sean and Jessie went out to find their father on their own.|$|R
50|$|After finally {{making it}} out of the Delta, Clarkson and May removed their animal {{protection}} from their cars, at which point the Lancia suffered another problem - the starter solenoid had packed in and thus had to be repaired for the car to start up again. Although it was able to move off, it was now unable to drive in anything other than second gear. Eventually, the car suffered another breakdown along the road, resulting in much of the support team and film crew choosing to leave it behind after being so fed up with the constant problems it had caused (some of the breakdowns were not aired in the broadcast), leaving Clarkson with only two bush mechanics staying behind to fix several issues that had developed, including the <b>engine</b> <b>stalling</b> after it started up every time by going into third gear. Miraculously, the Lancia was able to move off again, and reached the border with Namibia, behind Hammond and May. Upon deciding which was best, Clarkson ruled out the Lancia as the winner because of the issues it had caused, May's Mercedes was ruled out for having had to be modified to shed weight, while Hammond was shocked to learn the Beetle was declared the best choice for Surrey, after it was pointed out that it had not needed repairs or any modifications, compared to the Opel which had needed repairs.|$|E
50|$|The wet {{qualifying}} for the French Grand Prix saw him qualify 15th after the Williams team misread conditions and aquaplaned during the race. At Silverstone, Zanardi qualified 13th and finished 11th. In Austria, he started 14th. In {{the first part}} of the race, Zanardi's radio communications failed and around lap 33, his team hung out pit boards calling him in to pit but a battle with Pedro Diniz distracted the Italian and twice missed the board and eventually ran out of fuel. At the German Grand Prix, Zanardi qualified 14th due to a miscalculation for his position and incurred another pit lane speeding fine. In the race, a differential failure affected the engine and brakes forced a retirement. At Hungary, Zanardi reverted to using left-foot braking but suffered a third consecutive retirement from a differential failure, having run off the road earlier in the race. In Belgium, Zanardi started from 8th and the start saw him overtake Rubens Barrichello and Damon Hill into La Source. Zanardi ran as high as 4th before pitting and eventually finished 8th.In Monza, Zanardi qualified 4th ahead of teammate Ralf Schumacher. He overtook David Coulthard and Heinz-Harald Frentzen at the start. Frentzen took over 2nd from Zanardi at the Roggia chicane. On the third lap, the floor on the Williams became loose and he was forced to wave his rivals past but managed to finish 7th. At the next round at the Nürburgring, Zanardi qualified in 18th, placing blame on traffic. He performed well at the start but was forced to take avoiding action when Alexander Wurz clipped Pedro Diniz. The incident left Zanardi in last position but he regained positions before his car succumbed to his <b>engine</b> <b>stalling.</b> The penultimate round in Malaysia had seen Zanardi start from 16th with a first-lap collision that damaged his front rim with a pit-stop preventing better progress. He later ran wide which caused damage to the car radiators and forced another pit-stop with Zanardi finishing 10th.|$|E

50|$|A car {{fitted with}} an {{automatic}} transmission could also have its <b>engine</b> <b>stalled</b> when the vehicle is travelling {{in the opposite direction}} to the selected gear. For example, if the selector is in the 'D' position and the car is moving backwards, (on a steep enough hill to overcome the torque from the torque converter) the <b>engine</b> will <b>stall.</b> This is because, hypothetically, if the car is rolling backward fast enough, the force from the rotating wheels will be transmitted backward through the transmission and act as a sudden load on the engine.|$|R
50|$|Also in April 2014, federal safety {{regulators}} {{testified before}} Congress {{that they had}} expected the airbags in the defective cars {{to be able to}} deploy for 60 seconds after the <b>engine</b> <b>stalled,</b> but General Motors later told the Associated Press that they actually can only do so for 150 milliseconds.|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} of flow instabilities in the inlet ducts of a two-engine vertical takeoff and landing aircraft DP- 1 C {{is described in}} this report. Recent tests revealed that the <b>engines</b> <b>stall</b> during run ups while the aircraft is operating on the ground. These pop stalls occurred at relatively low power levels, sometimes as low as 60 percent of the engine full speed. Inability to run the engines up to the full speed level is attributed to in-ground effects associated with hot gas ingestion. Such pop stalls were never experienced when the aircraft was tested on a elevated grid platform, which ensured that the aircraft was operating in out-of-the-ground-effect conditions. Based on available information on problems experienced with other vertical takeoff and landing aircraft designs, {{it was assumed that}} the <b>engine</b> <b>stalls</b> were caused by partial ingestion of hot gases streaming forward from the main exit nozzle under the aircraft inlets, which are very close to the ground. It was also suggested that the nose wheel undercarriage, located between the inlets, may generate vortices or an unstable wake causing intense mixing of hot exit gases with incoming inlet flow, which would enhance the hot gas ingestion. After running a short three-day series of tests with fully instrumented engine inlets, it is now believed the most probable reason for <b>engine</b> pop <b>stalls</b> are random ingestions of a vortex generated between the two streams moving in opposite directions: outbound hot gas stream from the main nozzle close to the ground and inbound inlet flow above. Originally, the vortex is in a horizontal plane. However, at a certain velocity ratio of these two streams, the vortex attaches either to the ground or the aircraft surface at one end and the other end is swallowed by one of the aircraft inlets. Once the vortex enters the inlet duct, a puff of hot air can be sucked through the vortex core into the engine, which causes a serious inlet flow field distortion followed by an <b>engine</b> <b>stall.</b> Once the <b>engine</b> <b>stalls,</b> the outflow from the inlet pushes the vortex away and the engine resumes normal operation. This hypothesis needs to be verified experimentally; e. g., by extensive smoke flow visualization ahead of the aircraft inlets...|$|R
