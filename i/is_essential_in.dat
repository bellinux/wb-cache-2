In mitochondria, {{it is found}} in cytochrome c oxidase, which is the last protein in oxidative phosphorylation. Cytochrome c oxidase is the protein that binds the O2 between a copper and an iron; the protein transfers 8 electrons to the O2 molecule to reduce it to two molecules of water.|$|E
5|$|Portia labiata is a {{jumping spider}} (family Salticidae) found in Sri Lanka, India, {{southern}} China, Burma (Myanmar), Malaysia, Singapore, Java, Sumatra and the Philippines. In this medium-sized jumping spider, the front part is orange-brown {{and the back}} part is brownish. The conspicuous main eyes provide vision more acute than a cat's {{during the day and}} 10times more acute than a dragonfly's, and this <b>is</b> <b>essential</b> <b>in</b> P. labiata′s navigation, hunting and mating.|$|E
5|$|Partner {{communication}} <b>is</b> <b>essential</b> <b>in</b> a good defense. When {{one partner}} is under attack, the other partner {{should be aware}} of which pieces hurt most. Sitting strategies might be necessary, and it is therefore important to play the defense fast. Accepting a sacrifice can be lethal. On the other hand, it results in the attacker having a piece less to play with, with the defender's partner having a piece more. Sacrifices therefore give the partner of the defender an opportunity to take initiative.|$|E

5|$|A {{narrative}} rational for {{the concept}} of Hell {{can be found in}} the Hindu epic, Mahabharata. This narrative ends with Yudhishthira's visit to hell after being offered acceptance into heaven. This journey creates a scene for the audience that helps illustrate the importance of understanding hell as well as heaven before accepting either extreme. This idea provides an essential lesson regarding Dharma, a primary theme within the Mahabharata. Dharma is not a black and white concept, and all people are not entirely good or entirely evil. As such, tolerance <b>is</b> <b>essential</b> <b>in</b> order to truly understand the “right way of living”. We all must understand the worst to truly understand and appreciate the best just as we must experience the best before we can experience the worst. This narrative utilizes the Hindu religion in order to teach lessons on tolerance and acceptance of one another's faults as well as virtues.|$|E

25|$|Learning about PCD {{in various}} species <b>is</b> <b>essential</b> <b>in</b> {{understanding}} the evolutionary basis and reason for apoptosis in {{development of the}} nervous system. During {{the development of the}} invertebrate nervous system, PCD plays different roles in different species. The similarity of the asymmetric cell death mechanism in the nematode and the leech indicates that PCD may have an evolutionary significance {{in the development of the}} nervous system. In the nematode, PCD occurs in the first hour of development leading to the elimination of 12% of non-gonadal cells including neuronal lineages. Cell death in arthropods occurs first in the nervous system when ectoderm cells differentiate and one daughter cell becomes a neuroblast and the other undergoes apoptosis. Furthermore, sex targeted cell death leads to different neuronal innervation of specific organs in males and females. In Drosophila, PCD <b>is</b> <b>essential</b> <b>in</b> segmentation and specification during development.|$|E
