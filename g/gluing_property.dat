40|$|The time {{evolution}} {{operator of}} {{quantum field theory}} (Schrödinger functional) can be written in terms of particles moving on S(^ 1) /Z(_ 2 -). By deriving the 'gluing property’ which joins two propagators across fixed time surfaces, we show that the Feynman diagram expansion of the free Schrödinger functional is determined once we know the field propagator. We generalise the <b>gluing</b> <b>property</b> to a new method of sewing string field propagators and construct the string field Schrödinger functional in terms of strings moving on S(^ 1) /Z(_ 2 -). Timelike T-duality in string theory then appears as a large/small time symmetry of string field theory with an exchange of boundary states and string backgrounds. All of our arguments apply equally to the open and closed string. The addition of interactions to quantum field theory bring no complication to our arguments, but modifications are required when the interaction is non-local. As application of these methods we construct the interacting string field vacuum wave functional using knowledge of the vacuum expectation values it must generate.

40|$|We {{provide a}} {{complete}} generators and relations {{presentation of the}} 2 -dimensional extended unoriented and oriented bordism bicategories as symmetric monoidal bicategories. Thereby we classify these types of 2 -dimensional extended topological field theories with arbitrary target bicategory. As an immediate corollary we obtain a concrete classification when the target is the symmetric monoidal bicategory of algebras, bimodules, and intertwiners over a fixed commutative ground ring. In the oriented case, such an extended topological field theory is equivalent to specifying a (non-commutative) separable symmetric Frobenius algebra. We review the notion of symmetric monoidal bicategory, giving also a precise notion of generators and relations in this context. We provide several supporting lemmas, one of which provides a simple list of criteria for determining when a morphism of symmetric monoidal bicategories is an equivalence. We introduce the symmetric monoidal bicategory of bordisms with structure, where the allowed structures have a suitable sheaf or stack <b>gluing</b> <b>property.</b> We modify standard techniques of Cerf theory to obtain a bicategorical decomposition theorem for surfaces. Moreover these techniques produce a finite list of local relations which are sufficient to pass between any two decompositions. We deliberately avoid {{the use of the}} classification of surfaces, and consequently our techniques are readily adaptable to higher dimensions. Although constructed for the unoriented case, our decomposition theorem is engineered to generalize to the case of bordisms with structure. We demonstrate this for the case of bordisms with orientations, which leads to a similar classification theorem. This is the author's 2009 Ph. D. dissertation, with minor alterations...|$|E

30|$|To reduce {{negative}} aspects of lignocellulosic materials, chemical processes, such as etherification, esterification, and phenylation as well as heat treatment methods, have been proposed for improving the physical properties of timber materials [4, 5]. Spruce wood (Picea abies) had degraded hemicellulose, softened lignin, and hence reduced hydrophilicity of cellulose after treated with high temperature [6]. The other similar effect of heat treatment was found to improve hydrophobicity of spruce wood [7], and ameliorating the susceptibility of wood to microbial decomposition component, thus enhancing their dimensional stability and durability [8]. Furthermore, studies confirmed that the contents of major chemical constituents, including cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin of moso bamboo (Phyllostachys pubescens), and spruce wood, were reduced by heat treatment, and it significantly affected durability, surface properties, physical properties, and mechanical properties of wooden materials [9, 10].

This is a space of smooth maps from a finite graph to M, which, when restricted to each edge, is a gradient flow line of a smooth (and generically Morse) function on M. Using the model of Gromov-Witten theory, with this moduli space replacing the space of stable holomorphic curves in a symplectic manifold, we obtain invariants, which are (co) homology operations in M.

If critical process parameters like e. g. emulsification of the monomers, particle formation, colloidal stability during processing, heat flux, and viscosity are monitored inline and continuously, an increased understanding of the polymerization process is achieved, resulting in safe and cost-optimal processes and feedback control strategies. For example, polyvinylacetate based dispersion adhesives (white glues) are usually modified with functionalized comonomers to control <b>glue</b> <b>properties</b> like viscosity, pH, film formation, hydrophobicity, and adhesive strength (via crosslinking).

Hamiltonian observable currents are those satisfying d_vF=-ι_VΩ_L+ d_hσ^F and a certain boundary condition.

Lafforgue who obtained a Fields medal for his work. G. Laumon gave a geometric translation of a part of the theorem, called 'geometric Langlands correspondence'. The latter was proved by E. Frenkel, D. Gaitsgory and K. Vilonen for the case of finite fields and the group GL-n- of invertible matrices. A statement and a proof of the complex case should be obtained by mimicking the proof for finite fields. However, it does not appear anywhere in the literature. In this thesis, we chose a different approach. Our first aim was to make a correct statement and proof for simple cases. More precisely, we deal with cases where the two difficult objects "stacks" and "perverse sheaves", which appear in the original statement, are not involved. We also state and prove the correspondence in a new context, namely the case of singular curves. A large part of the thesis is devoted to making the objects appearing in the geometric statement, such as stacks, mor explicit. These objects are categories with <b>glueing</b> <b>properties.</b> They are now widely used but references are rare and often difficult to read. We thus give numerous examples of stacks and treat in detail explicit ones. We chose for instance to work on the case of trangles {{in order to get a}} better understanding of the interest of stacks. Another important example is the stack Bun-n-x of vector bundles or rank -n- over curve x. This is an interesting stack which plays an important role in the geometric Langlands correspondance. ...|$|R
40|$|Gluing of {{wood with}} great {{moisture}} content has challenge of water interaction with glue to give unwanted changes in <b>glue</b> <b>properties</b> and formed bond-line. Rheological measurements of polyurethane glues are sufficiently effective method {{to understand the}} polymer curing process and viscoelastic properties. Gel formation point is important parameter for a glue {{from the point of}} its application. When glue reaches the gel formation point, its viscosity drastically increases so that it could not properly wet the wood and it can result in poor bonds. One-component moisture curing polyurethane glues require water molecules for the polyadditional reaction. When water is involved in the curing reaction, it reacts with the isocyanate groups of glue and can lead to the formation of excessive carbon dioxide and thus can lead to glue penetration out of bond-line, additional backpressure. The dynamic viscoelastic parameters such as complex dynamic viscosity (ή), phase angle (δ), elastic storage modulus (G”), the viscous loss modulus (G”) of two kinds of polyurethane glues depending on added water amount (from 0. 9 % to 10. 0 %) at a constant frequency and deformation (oscillation mode) were determined using rheometer. The aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate impact of added water on rheological behavior of polyurethane glues. At the end of this study it was concluded that tested glues indicated various behavior depending on chemical composition and added water content. Gel formation point is higher in case of GlueI. However, gel formation time was higher in case of GlueII and was not dependent on added water content. Gel formation time was faster for GlueII. Nevertheless, faster formed gel is stronger than longer formed gel of GlueI...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We {{discuss a}} simplicial {{dimension}} shift which associates to each n-manifold an n− 1 -manifold. As a corollary {{we show that}} an invariant which was recently proposed by Ooguri and by Crane and Yetter {{for the construction of}} 4 -dimensional quantum field theories out of 3 -dimensional theories is trivial. Ooguri [1] proposed recently a method for obtaining 4 -manifold invariants and studying quantum gravity, with a construction inspired statistical mechanics. This procedure was further formalized by Crane and Yetter [2]. Their method is associating a 3 -manifold with boundary to every 4 -simplex ∆ 4. Given 4 -manifold M with a triangulation τ and an invariant for 3 -manifolds with boundary, they evaluate the invariant on the 3 -manifolds with boundary coming from each 4 -simplex, they match boundary conditions according to the triangulation and then they compute a partition function. They mention that the proof of the invariance of the result to the choice of the triangulation is long and technical. In fact the matching and summation of boundary conditions is equivalent to the glueing together of the corresponding portions of the boundary and then computing the invariant of the 3 -manifold without boundary obtained this way. With this observation the choice of the 3 -manifold invariant becomes irrelevant. One obtains a topological construction, which associates to each triangulated 4 -manifold a 3 -manifold, which we call the dimension shift of M. The aim of this note is to prove that the dimension shift of a 4 -manifold is essentially trivial, and that for a singular triangulated 4 -manifold the dimension shift yields essentially the direct sum of the 3 -singularities of M. In particular, the invariants of Ooguri, Crane and Yetter are always 1. We were led independently to the same construction in a different context [3]. We showed an equivalence between systems of n-modules over operator algebras and simplicial invariants for n + 1 -manifolds which have the <b>glueing</b> <b>property.</b> Working with subfactors, or 2 -modules, an asymptotic construction produces naturally some 3 -modules. The 4 -manifold invariants associated to these 3 -modules ar...|$|R
