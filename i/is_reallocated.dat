5|$|MLS teams {{also play}} in other competitions. Every year, {{up to five}} MLS teams play in the CONCACAF Champions League against other clubs from the CONCACAF region (Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean). Two U.S.-based MLS teams qualify based on MLS regular-season results: {{the winner of the}} Western conference and the winner of the Eastern conference. The third U.S. team to qualify is the winner of the MLS Cup. A fourth U.S.-based MLS team can qualify via the U.S. Open Cup, where U.S. based teams compete against lower {{division}} U.S. clubs. If a team qualifies through multiple berths, or if any of the MLS berths are taken by a Canada-based MLS team, the berth <b>is</b> <b>reallocated</b> to the best U.S.-based team in the Supporters' Shield table which has failed to otherwise qualify. Canadian MLS clubs play against lower division Canadian clubs in the Canadian Championship for the one Champions League spot allocated to Canada. No MLS club has won the Champions League since it began its current format in 2008, with Mexican clubs dominating the competition, but MLS teams have twice reached the final: Real Salt Lake in 2011 and the Montreal Impact in 2015.|$|E

Saved by Hiro, Noah intercepts Claire and Peter shortly after their encounter with Sylar and assists in convincing the Secret Service to help Peter save the President. Later, once Sylar is defeated, he works with Angela Petrelli and Matt Parkman to bring Nathan's personality {{to the forefront of}} Sylar's mind, thereby allowing Sylar to assume Nathan's life posthumously.

50|$|Temporary {{controls}} may complement {{a recession}} {{as a way}} to fight inflation: the controls make the recession more efficient {{as a way to}} fight inflation (reducing the need to increase unemployment), while the recession prevents the kinds of distortions that controls cause when demand is high. However, in general the advice of economists is not to impose price controls but to liberalize prices by assuming that the economy will adjust and abandon unprofitable economic activity. The lower activity will place fewer demands on whatever commodities were driving inflation, whether labor or resources, and inflation will fall with total economic output. This often produces a severe recession, as productive capacity <b>is</b> <b>reallocated</b> and is thus often very unpopular with the people whose livelihoods are destroyed (see creative destruction).|$|E
