This is recognized by the machine vendors, who have moved aggressively to sell imaging machines to physicians who are not board-certified or specialized in radiology. One vendor of medical imaging equipment marketing to physicians states: Are you dissatisfied with declining reimbursement rates, escalating <b>demands</b> <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>time</b> and increased competition? You can counteract these prevailing trends by capturing new revenue opportunities through providing diagnostic imaging services, such as MRI and CT, in your own office. Instead of sending your patients—and revenue—to another provider, your patients will appreciate the convenience, while you increase your bottom line.|$|E

This cannot be more wrong! Keeping good records {{is part of the}} nursing care we give to our patients. It is nearly impossible to remember everything you did and everything that happened on a shift. Without clear and accurate nursing records for each patient, our handover to the next team of nurses will be incomplete. Needless to say, this can affect the well being of patients...|$|E

This is unfortunate, because the benefits of participation in committees, round tables, and other groups early in your career cannot be overstated. With only a small time commitment, local professional service can provide you with an invaluable - and underrated - way to meet people, gain experience in the profession, and land yourself the job or promotion you want...|$|E

60|$|A {{wise man}} will extend this lesson to {{all parts of}} life, and {{know that it is}} the part of {{prudence}} to face every claimant and pay every just <b>demand</b> <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>time,</b> <b>your</b> talents, or your heart. Always pay; for first or last you must pay your entire debt. Persons and events may stand for a time between you and justice, but it is only a postponement. You must pay at last your own debt. If you are wise you will dread a prosperity which only loads you with more. Benefit is the end of nature. But for every benefit which you receive, a tax is levied. He is great who confers the most benefits. He is base,--and that is the one base thing in the universe,--to receive favors and render none. In the order of nature we cannot render benefits to those from whom we receive them, or only seldom. But the benefit we receive must be rendered again, line for line, deed for deed, cent for cent, to somebody. Beware of too much good staying in your hand. It will fast corrupt and worm worms. Pay it away quickly in some sort.|$|R
40|$|Marketing” is a {{ubiquitous}} term {{applied to}} almost anything. Market your brand. Market your name. Market your product. Market your library. “Market your library” {{sounds a bit}} odd – maybe because in academia we don’t {{think we need to}} market our library. We’re a firmly established part of the institution. We may change over time, but it’s unlikely we’ll disappear, and any “marketing” we do probably will not result in more funding from our parent institution. But marketing, even in academia, is important because it helps advertise the value we bring to our institutions. We’ve been talking about Marketing a lot {{over the past few years}} in presentations (e. g., “Twenty Dollars a Day: Marketing Your Library in Challenging Economic Times”, Marcia Dority Baker and Stefanie Pearlman, MAALL Annual Meeting, 2009) and in articles (e. g., “Tweet Treats”, 14 AALL Spectrum 18, 2009) and would like to revisit the topic and offer new suggestions. Marketing is frequently associated with large outputs of money and long, highly strategized advertising campaigns. Are there ways to market without investing large sums of cash and placing high <b>demands</b> <b>on</b> <b>your</b> library’s <b>time</b> or space? Sure. At the Schmid Law Library we market our library in a number of relatively inexpensive – money, time and space – ways. Our marketing has helped us establish ourselves as an important part of our law school community. We’d like to share some of our strategies. Borrowing from review services like Yelp and TripAdvisor, we’ll briefly outline what we do, then provide codes indicating how much money ($), library space (⌂), and staff time (·) was involved to help you decide if any of these activities could help you market your library...|$|R
40|$|Library Techs work in {{a highly}} {{technological}} industry and online learning nicely complements skill building for the future. Students generally have few problems using webct to its full capacity and many necessary skills such as database searching skills and cataloguing are taught online mirroring workplace practices. It also offers the flexibility to study whilst working or juggling other commitments. Think about many <b>demands</b> <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>time</b> when you are working. Commitments such as children, spouse, running a household, finding time for exercise {{and trying to find}} that work life balance. Some enlightened employers may offer release time or study leave but often for workers further study does require an individual effort. Workplace experience can also make the learning so much more relevant to the student as knowledge is learned within the library context. Being able to access a course using communication technologies can enable the student to do their coursework when the opportunity arises such as lunchtimes and in the evening and weekends. To supplement the online learning weekend workshops are often offered to support student learning. Gaining the most up to date qualification, the Diploma Library/Information Services can only enhance workplace performance and credibility with staff. Keeping skills up to date is of great importance...|$|E
40|$|Sustainable online {{education}} {{is characterized by}} its ability to persist when extraordinary internal or external funding stops. Unfortunately, {{it seems to be}} a rare phenomenon. In most cases {{online education}} is sustainable when it generates an economic surplus or reduces costs. (Page 27) Today’s students often have full-time jobs and families to take care of and many are reluctant to participate if it means relinquishing high-quality family life and job achievements. They need flexible education: education that allows them to combine job, family, and education in a manageable way. (Page 42) Both studies show that online students have better average grades and a lower percentage of failing grades. This does not necessarily show that online courses were better than traditional part-time courses, but it shows that online learning seems to work very well for students who have chosen to study online. (Page 55) In correspondence courses, teachers are accustomed to mail carriers who deliver mail once a day. Online teachers, however, may receive e-mail 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. This online immediacy results in student demand for swifter responses and, hence, a heavier workload for teachers. (Page 70) In traditional education and training allocation of resources is controlled by the “ringing of the bell”. (Page 70) You are going to work harder in teaching a course online, at least the first time [...] Being a “virtual ” professor is a little bit like parenthood. You are “on duty ” all the time, and there seems to be no end to the <b>demands</b> <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>time</b> and energy. (Page 70) Figure 2. The online teacher's workload Online education offers students excellent opportunities for individual communication with their tutors. They can be contacted via e-mail 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. Few learning environments provide such opportunities for individual access to teachers. It is obvious that online students appreciate always having a personal tutor available. It is the students’ dream, but it could soon become a nightmare for the tutors...|$|E
