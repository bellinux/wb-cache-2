50|$|Barbara Walters, {{though not}} the first to cross the line between news and {{personality}} stories, is for many the quintessential news-media icon. Her career dates back to the 1950s, and her current prominence at ABC is largely due to celebrity interviews, with a long running co-anchorship on 20/20 with <b>Hugh</b> <b>Downs</b> <b>and,</b> later, John Stossel until 2004, and her overlapping morning infotainment show The View.|$|R

In addition to continuing with his technical and production innovations, Eddy initiated many highly popular programs, including Junior Jamboree (puppeteers, later becoming Kukla, Fran and Ollie), the Chicago Zoo with Marlin Perkins (later Wild Kingdom), news with <b>Hugh</b> <b>Downs,</b> <b>and</b> the first live broadcasts of many sports: baseball (Chicago Cubs remote from Wrigley Field), college football (Notre Dame remote from South Bend), boxing, wrestling, and golf.|$|R

In the next two U.S. Opens, in 1970 and 1971, she placed 4th and 3rd, respectively. By that time she was already fairly well known, having had additional television appearances alongside such billiard stars and celebrities as Willie Mosconi, Sammy Davis Jr., Peter Falk, <b>Hugh</b> <b>Downs</b> <b>and</b> Sonny Fox. [...] She would later appear on television many more times, in addition to broadcasts of pool matches, including an interview on The Mike Douglas Show airing on January 11, 1977 with Bernadette Peters and David Niven.|$|R

It was a relief when it was over {{and he was able to}} take his leave, but, as it happened, he forgot the plan he had laid <b>down,</b> <b>and</b> <b>Barbara,</b> who noticed it, overtook him in the log-hall.

50|$|The {{show was}} {{broadcast}} {{on and off}} from 1958 to 1991, presented by various hosts, and {{has been made in}} several different versions. The original network daytime series, Concentration, appeared on NBC for 14 years, 7 months, and 3,770 telecasts (August 25, 1958 - March 23, 1973), the longest run of any game show on that network (Wheel of Fortune was a month shy of tying that record when the initial NBC run ended on June 30, 1989). This series was hosted by <b>Hugh</b> <b>Downs</b> <b>and</b> later by Bob Clayton, but for a six-month period in 1969, Ed McMahon hosted the series. The series began at 11:30 AM Eastern, then moved to 11:00 and finally to 10:30. Nearly all episodes of the NBC daytime version were produced at 30 Rockefeller Plaza, New York City.|$|R

[...] Some {{of these individuals}} organized a write-in campaign on behalf of Ellis Arnall, {{who said that he}} neither encouraged nor discouraged their undertaking. Maddox likened the write-in to an attempt to [...] "slip into the back door like a thief in the night" [...] and called upon Arnall to renounce the drive. Several celebrities endorsed the Arnall write-in, including television personality <b>Hugh</b> <b>Downs</b> <b>and</b> singers Peter, Paul, and Mary, Frank Sinatra, and Sammy Davis, Jr. The Georgia civil rights activist Hosea Williams challenged Callaway on a myriad of issues important to liberals and claimed that the Republican nominee had purchased the endorsement of the Atlanta Journal.|$|R
2500|$|From 1952 to 1964, {{a notable}} {{member of the}} cast was a woman, often an entertainer, the Today Girl.

Estelle Parsons {{was the first to}} hold the job, though her title at the time was [...] "Women's Editor". Upon her departure in 1955, the Today Girl name was adopted. The last to hold the position, Barbara Walters, discussed the job in her autobiography [...] She wrote that the era was before the Women's Movement, and it was believed that nobody would take a woman seriously reporting [...] "hard news"; Walters described the position as a [...] "tea pourer". In 1966, Walters was promoted to co-host alongside <b>Hugh</b> <b>Downs,</b> <b>and</b> the Today Girl position was eliminated. Those who held the position were: ...|$|R

2500|$|When casting {{about for}} the role of Norma Desmond for the 1950 film Sunset Boulevard, Billy Wilder offered West the role. Still smarting from the {{censorship}} debacle of The Heat's On, [...] and the constraints placed on her characterization, she declined. The theme of the Wilder film, she noted, [...] was pure pathos, while her brand of comedy was always [...] "about uplifting the audience". [...] Mae West had a unique comic character that was timeless, in the same way Charlie Chaplin did. After Mary Pickford also declined the role, Gloria Swanson was cast. In subsequent years, West was offered the role of Vera Simpson, opposite Marlon Brando, in the 1957 film adaptation of Pal Joey, which she turned down, with the role going to Rita Hayworth. [...] In 1964, West was offered a leading role in Roustabout, starring Elvis Presley. She turned the role <b>down,</b> <b>and</b> <b>Barbara</b> Stanwyck was cast in her place. West was also approached for roles in Frederico Fellini's Juliet of the Spirits and Satyricon, but rejected both offers.|$|R

5000|$|However 1988 will {{be remembered}} for the Ulster title win over Tyrone when a [...] "Nudie" [...] Hughes goal {{following}} a fumble by Tyrone keeper Aidan Skelton saw Monaghan win by 1-10 to 0-11. An interesting facet of this particular game was that all Monaghan's scores came from play. Previous wins over Cavan (0-16 to 0-14), again marked by a 5 star performance from Nudie <b>Hughes</b> <b>and</b> <b>Down</b> (1-11 to 0-09) had brought Monaghan to the Ulster final.|$|R
2500|$|With expiring enlistments leaving {{fewer than}} 100 men {{remaining}} in his regiment, Haslet crossed the Delaware with Washington {{and joined the}} attack on Trenton {{on the morning of}} December 26, 1776. However, on January 3, 1777, in a skirmish {{at the beginning of the}} Battle of Princeton, with General <b>Hugh</b> Mercer <b>down</b> <b>and</b> wounded, Haslet tried to rally Mercer's brigade and was himself shot in the head and killed instantly. Nevertheless, they did rally and a surprising victory was won to complement the earlier one at Trenton. The [...] "corps of loyalists" [...] he defeated at Mamaroneck was led by the famous Indian fighter Robert Rogers (soldier). Legend has it that Washington wept over his corpse on the battlefield and notes by Washington's stepson confirm that Washington did come across Haslet's body at Princeton, but does not mention any shedding of tears.|$|R

Phyllis convinced Damon not to kill him but, when she stepped between them, Hughes went for the gun. Damon jumped between them as Hughes fired and Damon took the bullet. With a last surge of rage, Damon ran Dominic through with the sword.|$|R

When Riggs was contacted to take Parisyan's place he jumped at the chance, despite having fought at UFC 55 just a month earlier. However, Riggs {{did not make the}} required weight and the fight was declared a non-title event, due to Hughes allowing Riggs to fight him (if a fighter does not make weight for a match, the match may still take place if their opponent allows it). Despite his efforts, Riggs could not mount a significant challenge; <b>Hughes</b> took him <b>down</b> <b>and</b> submitted him with a kimura from half-guard just minutes into {{the first round of the}} fight.|$|R

[...] In 1947, <b>Hugh</b> <b>Downs</b> (Today Show <b>and</b> 20/20), Garry Moore (1915–1993) and Durward Kirby (1912–2000) were on the WMAQ staff, as was Mike Wallace, later of 60 Minutes fame. Dave Garroway (1913–1982) also arrived on the NBC airwaves via WMAQ with his 1160 Club playing big band and jazz in the 1940s. Garroway was also responsible for organizing a series of local jazz concerts and establishing a Chicago lounge [...] "Jazz Circuit" [...] in 1947 which revived interest in the music genre. In 1948 and 1949, Garroway was voted the nation's top Disk Jockey by his peers in Billboard's annual poll.|$|R

He returned to action for the 2007-08 season, going on to sign a one-year contract extension in March 2008. After three operations and later being informed that his injury had been misdiagnosed, Barrett left Falkirk after manager John <b>Hughes</b> sat him <b>down</b> <b>and</b> {{told him he would}} never be the player he was before suffering his injuries.
