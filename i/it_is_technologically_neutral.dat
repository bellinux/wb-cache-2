40|$|Public Lending Right (PLR) and Educational Lending Right (ELR) schemes are remunerating Australian {{authors and}} {{publishers}} for making available their books in Australian libraries.

After an extensive analysis of the technological neutrality principle, this article concludes this principle does not impose a legal obligation to extend PLR and ELR to e-books since traditional lending and e-lending are not functionally and economically equivalent services.

40|$|This document, {{published}} {{as a first}} draft in November 2000, presents a set of 16 voting system requirements that support fail-safe privacy, verifiable security and tamper-proof ballots.

30|$|Such {{standards}} incorporate schemas (i.e. {{data structure}} templates) to organize {{various aspects of}} the data, but there exist many kinds of schemas at different levels of abstraction and for different purposes. Well-established data modelling principles suggest the deployment of three schemas that vary by technological neutrality: physical, logical, and conceptual [27, 37]. Conceptual schemas <b>are</b> <b>technologically</b> <b>neutral</b> and describe the world as it is; logical schemas describe the world from the viewpoint of a specific technological paradigm, such as logical, functional, or object-oriented; and physical schemas are aimed at specific system implementations, such as for a particular database system or data transfer language. Significantly, these schemas are interdependent, as the physical depends on the logical, which depends on the conceptual. A dependent schema then implements all the schemas on which it depends, even if those schemas are not explicitly and separately expressed – i.e. every logical schema reflects some conceptual schema, even if the conceptual schema is not stated; likewise every physical schema reflects some (possibly unstated) logical schema, and thus also some (possibly unstated) conceptual schema.|$|R
