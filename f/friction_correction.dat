40|$|This {{paper is}} the fourth in a series on {{friction}} factors for sprinkler laterals. The widely used <b>friction</b> <b>correction</b> factor F was developed by Christiansen for the hydraulic analysis of sprinkler laterals. A significant modification to this factor was the adjusted <b>friction</b> <b>correction</b> factor Fa. The adjusted <b>friction</b> <b>correction</b> factor can be used when the first sprinkler is {{a fraction of a}} full spacing from the lateral inlet. To design laterals with outlets and outflow at the downstream end, <b>friction</b> <b>correction</b> factor G was developed with the corresponding adjusted <b>friction</b> <b>correction</b> factor Ga. To calculate the average pressure head along a lateral, the average correction factors FAVG and GAVG were developed. These average correction factors can be used where <b>friction</b> <b>correction</b> factors F and G are used to analyze a lateral. This paper introduces two final adjusted average correction factors FaAVG and GaAVG, which can be used to determine the average pressure head in laterals analyzed using Fa or Ga. Use of these factors is demonstrated in an example...|$|E
40|$|Analytical {{equations}} for <b>friction</b> <b>correction</b> {{factors for}} center-pivot laterals without end guns are developed. This work illustrates a discrepancy when earlier equations {{are applied to}} center-pivots with small numbers of outlets. Earlier equations were also limited to center-pivots with constant outlet spacing. Equations presented in the current work are developed for center-pivots with constant outlet spacing and also for center-pivots with constant outlet discharge. When the equations developed in the current work are applied to center-pivots {{with a large number}} of outlets, the results are in good agreement with previous work for center-pivot laterals with an infinite number of outlets. When applied to smaller number of outlets the equations presented here provide a more precise estimate of the <b>friction</b> <b>correction</b> factor. Using the current equations, the <b>friction</b> <b>correction</b> factor for center-pivots with constant outlet spacing was found to be very similar to the <b>friction</b> <b>correction</b> factor for center-pivots with constant outlet discharge. Useful simple equations are also presented for calculating the discharge of each outlet or for calculating the spacing between outlets...|$|E
40|$|The end-gun {{discharge}} of center pivots is {{expressed as a}} ratio of the discharge at the pivot. Using this ratio, equations are developed for the <b>friction</b> <b>correction</b> factor and pressure distribution factor. If end-gun discharge is reduced to zero, then these equations reduce to the well-established equation for the <b>friction</b> <b>correction</b> factor and pressure distribution factor. For an end-gun ratio of unity, the <b>friction</b> <b>correction</b> factor also becomes unity, reflecting that the lateral {{is in fact a}} pipeline without outlets. The pressure distribution factor becomes linear, reflecting that head loss varies linearly with length. For a lateral of constant diameter and typical end- gun discharge there is a significant increase in head loss due to friction. However, there is insignificant difference in the estimate using either this technique or the effective radius technique. The pressure distribution factor is slightly higher, indicating that in laterals with end guns the pressure head {{toward the center of the}} lateral is higher. The equations presented can be used to design center-pivot laterals with end guns or the first segment of a tapered center pivot lateral...|$|E

40|$|Background: National {{working groups}} {{identify}} {{the need for}} return on investment research conducted from the purchaser perspective; however, the field has not developed standardized methods for measuring the basic components of return on investment, including costing out the value of work productivity loss due to illness. Recent literature is divided on whether {{the most commonly used}} method underestimates or overestimates this loss. The goal of this manuscript is to characterize between and within variation in the cost of work productivity loss from illness estimated by the most commonly used method and its two refinements. Methods: One senior health benefit specialist from each of 325 companies employing 100 + workers completed a cross-sectional survey describing their company size, industry and policies/practices regarding work loss which allowed the research team to derive the variables needed to estimate work productivity loss from illness using three methods. Compensation estimates were derived by multiplying lost work hours from presenteeism and absenteeism by wage/fringe. Disruption correction adjusted this estimate to account for co-worker disruption, while <b>friction</b> <b>correction</b> accounted for labor substitution. The analysis compared bootstrapped means and medians between and within these three methods. Results: The average company realized an annual 617 (SD[*]=[*] 75) per capita loss from depression by compensation methods and a 649 (SD[*]=[*] 78) loss by disruption correction, compared to a 316 (SD[*]=[*] 58) loss by <b>friction</b> <b>correction</b> (p[*] 3 Ì†c[*]. 0001).

Both correction factors are applied to free convection along a vertical flat porous plate for values of the Prandtl number of 0. 73, 1 and 7. Subsequently, the film theory predictions are compared with the numerical and asymptotic results of a boundary layer analysis, performed by previous investigators.

40|$|The {{adjusted}} factor Ga is {{a generic}} <b>friction</b> loss <b>correction</b> factor for pipelines with multiple outlets. The adjusted factor Ga {{can be applied}} to pipelines with or without outflow at the downstream end. Furthermore, this factor {{can be applied to}} a pipeline where the first outlet is at a full outlet spacing or a fractional outlet spacing from the pipeline inlet. When the outflow at the downstream end is reduced to zero, the adjusted factor Ga reduces to the adjusted factor Fa. If the first outlet is positioned one outlet spacing from the pipeline inlet, the factor Ga reduces to G. Finally, if both the outflow is zero and the first outlet is one outlet spacing from the pipeline inlet, the adjusted factor Ga reduces to a close approximation of the well known factor F. The adjusted factor Ga {{is a function of the}} number of outlets along the pipeline, the location of the first outlet from the pipeline inlet, the outflow ratio, and the velocity exponent of the head loss formula...|$|R

30|$|Corrections for {{membrane}} resistance, {{area correction}} and enlarged/lubricated platens resulted in cumulative reductions of about 11 Â % and 3.5 Â° of {{undrained shear strength}} and critical state <b>friction</b> angle, while <b>correction</b> for specimen volume and cross sectional area change during saturation increased these strength parameters by about 1.5 Â % and 0.9 Â°, respectively. Membrane penetration resulted only in an average of 0.36 Â % decrease in void ratio during isotropic consolidation and undrained shear tests as the fine gradation of the tested sand limited the amount of membrane penetration into the surface irregularities of the specimen. The bedding errors due to the application of lubricated ends led to a maximum increase in volumetric strain of 1.7 Â % during isotropic compression and an additional 0.38 Â mm or 2.5 Â % increase in the measured axial strain during shearing. The corrected results are presented to compare the responses for different specimen sizes during isotropic compression and shearing in the following paragraphs.|$|R
40|$|Hydrothermal melting {{reactions}} {{in the system}} NaAlSiO_ 4 -SiO_ 2 -H_ 2 O have been extended into the coesite stability field using piston-cylinder apparatus, and the quartz-coesite transition has been bracketed at 735 Â° (28. 0 Â± 0. 9 Kb) and at 800 Â° C (28. 15 Â± 0. 9 Kb) {{in the presence of}} a silicate liquid phase; this provided favorable kinetic conditions. The results agree closely with previous piston-cylinder determinations employing a correction for pressure loss due to friction.

40|$|Discharge {{predictions}} using four codes {{suitable to}} modelling flood extent are compared to predictions derived using {{theoretical and empirical}} methods. The model codes vary in complexity but represent the types of code used in practical application due to their easy integration with available GIS data formats. Common to the codes is that turbulent momentum interaction between main channel and over-bank floodplain flow is not explicitly taken into account. It is shown for different configurations of a hypothetical channel that the codes significantly overestimate discharge capacity as a result. Applying these codes to flood extent modelling therefore requires calibration of roughness values to account for this additional momentum transfer, resulting in roughness factors derived no longer representing physical friction values only, but combined <b>friction</b> and momentum <b>correction</b> factors. As a consequence of calibration being required even in more complex models where turbulence is explicitly modelled, these simpler models that are easier in application may, however, be equally viable.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to model the {{interaction}} between the loan market and real activity, while financial frictions are explicitly taken into account. The econometric methodology used is VECM. Johansenâ€™s approach is employed to allow for multiple cointegration. Financial frictions are captured by including balance sheet indicators of firms and banks (cash flow and the VIX index) which move the loan supply curve. For the non-financial corporate sector 3 long-run equilibrium relationships were found, each corresponding to a reduced form investment, a loan demand and a loan supply equation, where loan supply is determined by the cost of borrowing, and the cash flow of firms or the VIX index. In contrast, for manufacturing no evidence was found concerning the significance of financial frictions. Impulse response analysis is used to calculate the real effects of a loan supply shock.

The adjusted average <b>friction</b> <b>correction</b> factor, FaAVG, provides the possibility of calculating the inlet pressure to mutli-outlet pressurized irrigation pipelines when the first outlet spacing from the pipe entrance is arbitrary. To investigate the effect of allowable head-loss in the lateral pipeline on inlet pressure, a new equation was developed for calculating this factor. A progression coefficient was assumed for variable discharge of the outlets. The results showed that though the inlet pressure of the lateral depends on the head loss between the outlets, it is negligible when more than 15 outlets are used. It was also concluded that when N is less than 15 and the ratio of distance between inlet and first outlet to outlet spacing is less than 1, the conventional approaches overestimate the inlet pressure. In this research, a new equation was also developed for Christiansen friction factor in which the first outlet is located {{at a fraction of}} outlet spacing.

We have determined <b>friction</b> <b>correction</b> factors for a range of cell assemblies commonly used in our laboratory relative to select well-characterized phase equilibria. Single-sleeve NaCl cells require, using the piston-in technique, very small corrections of the order - 0. 05 GPa for 12. 7 mm diameter, and less for larger diameter assemblies. Four separate calibrations of the single sleeve 12. 7 mm BaCO 3 cell show that it requires a correction of - 9 %.

Friction coefficients between positive and negative ions are much larger, especially between ions with multiple charges. They decrease with increasing concentrations. Ions of like charge usually have negative friction coefficients; their behaviour mirrors that of ions with unlike charges. The many coefficients in the solid can only be obtained by combining data on ion exchange and electrodialysis membranes. In the matrix, we can estimate friction coefficients with water from free solution values and a 'tortuosity' <b>correction.</b> <b>Friction</b> between counter-ions and the charged matrix is important. It is much larger than the (free solution with tortuosity) prediction. This is especially so for ions with multiple charges. This type of friction also seems to depend on the polymer morphology. At the high concentrations in the matrix, friction coefficients between different counter-ions with a like charge are usually positive. The friction can be appreciable. Our knowledge of friction coefficients within the solid is still incomplete; we end with a few remarks on this...|$|R
40|$|Pipelines with {{multiple}} outlets are used extensively for irrigation under {{various types of}} surface, sprinkler and trickle irrigation systems. In this research, a lateral pipeline with two diameters (tapered), laid on horizontal, uphill and downhill slopes that usually faced in design were investigated using back stepwise method. Effect of different parameters such as variation of friction factor along the pipeline, variation of discharge with head and velocity head on the total head loss and pressure along the pipeline was studied. Location of average operating pressure head along the pipeline for different slopes and tapering length ratios, which is important for computing the inlet and end pressures head, was estimated. Furthermore, empirical equations for estimating the ratio of head loss at location of average pressure head to the total head loss were developed. Then the pressure head at the upstream end or downstream end can be computed using <b>friction</b> <b>correction</b> factor method. The results showed that neglecting the effect of variation of friction factor underestimate the value of head loss along the lateral and neglecting the effect of variation in discharge overestimate the value of head loss, therefore, neglecting effects of the two parameters {{at the same time}} leads to a value of head loss very near to the value of exact solution. The velocity head have small effect on the head loss and can be neglected at sprinkler laterals but it has effect on the total head. Finally, example is given to show how to use the proposed empirical equations at inlet and end pressure computation...|$|E
40|$|The piston {{cylinder}} apparatus {{is one of}} the most versatile instruments operating in laboratories of experimental petrology because it provides a safe, inexpensive, and easy-to-use technique for accessing high-pressure and high-temperature phases and processes. The operating pressure of the {{piston cylinder}} usually ranges between 0. 5 and 5 GPa, which allows Earth scientists to investigate materials and processes occurring at deep crustal to upper mantle levels. Incomplete compaction of the assembly and thermocouple failure are typical problems in experiments performed at pressures lower than 0. 5 GPa. In this work, we present new calibration data that demonstrates that the piston cylinder apparatus is suitable for experiments at pressure as low as to 150 MPa. Two new designs for the 25 mm assembly have been developed and calibrated using two different calibration methods: the NaCl melting curve and the solubility of H 2 O in albite and rhyolite melts. NaCl calibration data shows that positive friction corrections of 45, 55, and 60 MPa applied to the force of the piston are necessary to establish sample pressures of 300, 200, and 150 MPa respectively. The H 2 O solubility experiments in albite and rhyolite not only confirm the corrections determined using the NaCl calibration method, but also indicate that the <b>friction</b> <b>correction</b> is the same even when operating at temperatures higher than 800 Â°C and for 24 -hour durations. The accuracy of the pressure estimate associated with the calibration methods is Â± 25 MPa. The major advantage of using the new design assemblies in the piston cylinder apparatus is that experiments for which low-pressure conditions as well as very fast heating and quenching rates are required (e. g. volcanic and hydrothermal systems), can be performed with the same ease and precision as for the pressure ranges for which piston cylinders are routinely employed...|$|E
40|$|The main {{driver of}} {{developments}} in the wind energy sector is not the absolute maximization of energy capture, but {{the reduction of the}} Cost of Energy (CoE). More and more research is carried out to investigate control of the air flow to reduce fatigue loads, structural requirements, and apply novel control strategies to ultimately reduce this important CoE. Plasma actuators {{have been the subject of}} an increasing amount of research in recent years in the field of Active Flow Control (AFC). Of particular interest to the present study is the alternating current Dielectric Barrier Discharge (DBD) plasma actuator, which is widely used due to the low mass, low power consumption, fast response time, absence of moving parts and large actuation bandwidth. Successful applications of the technique include postponement and control of flow separation, transition delay by Tollmien-Schlichting wave cancellation, stream-wise vortex generation and the control of dynamic stall on oscillating airfoils. To fully take advantage of the potential performance increase DBD actuators can offer, its effect should be accounted for as early as possible in the aerodynamic design phase. Previous work at TU Delft incorporated the DBD plasma body force in the integral boundary layer formulations. In the light of discrepancies between the existing model and experimental observations, attention is focused on the skin friction. An experimental campaign was designed and conducted at the open jet facility to acquire high resolution PIV of the turbulent boundary layer during various states of boundary layer development, for both actuated and non-actuated cases. The velocity fields were post-processed to obtain the variation in skin friction induced by the DBD plasma. Major conclusion from the observations is the fact that the increase in skin friction due to actuation occurs downstream of the actual plasma body force region, and extents for approximately 2. 6 body force lengths. A semi-elliptical fit is employed to model the variation in skin friction due to DBD plasma actuation dCf. The steps to be taken to implement the dCf in a numerical boundary layer solver are investigated. The work includes a first approach in Matlab, to pave the way for future work to include the skin <b>friction</b> <b>correction</b> in rapid-analysis, viscous-inviscid panel codes based on integral boundary layer formulation such as Rfoil.

40|$|Thermal engine {{encapsulation}} is {{an increasingly}} popular design choice, which insulates the engine from {{the external environment}} and retains heat in the engine after it is turned off. This decelerates motor cool-down and increases the probability for high initial temperature at a subsequent engine start, resulting in shorter warm-up and reduced friction between engine parts. Â This work investigates thermal engine encapsulation (TEE) {{as a means to}} reduce engine friction and fuel consumption during engine warm-up. In order to predict the effects of TEE on the fuel consumption, it is necessary to model a wide range of thermal phenomena in different subsystems of the powertrain. The presented work proposes an integrated simulation methodology that enables efficient numerical simulations of heat transfer in the powertrain cooling systems and the engine structures not only during dynamic driving but also during the process of engine cool-down when the vehicle is parked. The integrated simulation includes a number sub-models that capture relevant phenomena in the vehicle powertrain and underhood. Presented in detail is the simulation procedure, which ultimately predicts the continuous development of the temperatures of the engine oil and the coolant as well as the temperatures of the different engine parts and components from the powertrain cooling system. An automated coupling between the one-dimensional (1 D) thermal representation of the engine and powertrain cooling systems with a three-dimensional (3 D) CFD model of buoyancy-driven flow in the engine bay computes the heat rejection during engine cool-down. By use of an integrated <b>friction</b> <b>correction</b> map the engine model computes the variation of friction losses at different engine temperatures. The integrated simulation model makes possible to predict the temperature of engine structures after a long period of engine inactivity preceded by dynamic driving, the exact temperature development of engine structures and cooling fluids after a recurring engine start, as well as the variations in the instantaneous fuel consumption. Â Furthermore, a TEE concept for a passenger vehicle has been designed. The presented simulation method is applied to evaluate the effect of the proposed encapsulation on the development of engine temperatures during cool-down and their effect on the fuel consumption during a sequence of two Worldwide harmonized light vehicle test cycles (WLTC) separated with a period of inactivity. The results indicate a significant capability of encapsulations with high degree of coverage to retain engine heat for long time periods after key-off. The obtained results show that the encapsulated engine setup has potential for up to 3. 1 % savings of the fuel burned during a WLTC by a non-encapsulated engine in a cold environment. The amount of fuel saved depends primarily on the specific engine (mass, size and geometry), encapsulation design (geometry, thickness and degree of coverage), ambient temperature, and time of inactivity between engine shut-down and start-up. For periods of inactivity between 2 to 8 hours the potential for fuel saving is at least 2. 5 % of the total fuel burned during WLTC at ambient temperature of 5 Â°C for encapsulation with 97 % coverage...|$|E
