5|$|Parish and Shaw did {{not mention}} what time of year the {{tradition}} took place on or its geographical location. They also made no reference to a sack concealing the person carrying the horse. Doel thought it likely that neither Parish or Shaw had <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> <b>a</b> hooden horse, and that instead their information was based on older written sources. He also thought it noteworthy that they described the tradition using the past tense, indicating that they considered it to be either dead or dying {{at the time of}} writing. However, Maylam believed that the information regarding the decline of the tradition was erroneous, because hoodeners were still active in St. Nicholas-at-Wade during the early twentieth century and various locals living in the area at the time could recall it taking place in the area back to the 1840s.|$|E
5|$|The {{increasing}} {{population of}} Catholics in the Indies led Mgr. Petrus Willekens, then Vicar Apostolic of Batavia, {{to suggest that}} a new apostolic vicariate be established in Central Java, headquartered in Semarang, as the area was culturally different and geographically separate from Batavia. The Apolistic Vicariate of Batavia was split in two on 25June 1940; the eastern half became the Apostolic Vicariate of Semarang. On 1August 1940 Willekens received a telegram from Pro-Secretary of State Giovanni Battista Montini ordering that Soegijapranata be put in charge of the newly established apostolic vicariate. This was forwarded to Soegijapranata in Yogyakarta, who agreed to the appointment, despite being surprised and nervous. His assistant Hardjosoewarno later recalled that Soegijapranata cried after reading the telegram– an uncharacteristic response– and, when eating a bowl of soto, asked if Hardjosoewarno had <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> <b>a</b> bishop eating the dish.|$|E

500|$|Described as [...] "one of {{the most}} talented footballers of his generation", Enda Muldoon has played in {{virtually}} all positions in the forward line, as well as midfield for both his club and county. He is regarded as the complete footballer in that he has impressive high-fielding skills, is hard to dispossess, is very accurate in front of the posts with both feet and covers a lot of ground often tracking back to help in defence. Muldoon has been praised for his vision and ability to pick out pin-point passes, and he is also regarded as a great reader of the game. Ballinderry and Derry team-mate Kevin McGuckin described him as [...] "a magician on the ball and can do anything with it or put it anywhere with his passing". GAA journalist and former Derry player Joe Brolly said of him: [...] "I cannot say I have <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> <b>a</b> more elegant footballer" [...] and compared him to Kerry football legend Maurice Fitzgerald.|$|E
500|$|As sound {{pictures}} {{became the}} norm in Hollywood, the [...] "backstage" [...] film musical was a natural subject for the new medium. [...] Not only could the studios present singing and dancing to their audiences [...] {{many of whom were}} unlikely to have <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> <b>a</b> stage musical before [...] but the Pre-Code film musicals also tended to feature shapely young female chorus [...] "girls" [...] wearing skimpy rehearsal clothing which revealed parts of the body which were still not normal to see on the street, and hinted at other parts in a way that normal fashion did not allow. But even if this could be considered to be exploitative use of the female body, the Pre-Code movie musicals were generally not derogatory in their presentation of the physical virtues of their women, but celebratory, with Busby Berkeley's spectacular musical numbers being especially, and wittily, so; Berkeley avoided fetishizing his female performers.|$|E

[...] Several critics compared the female characters to Jane Austen's novels. The Weekly Standard editor John Podhoretz opined, [...] "I don't know when I've <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> <b>a</b> film as eerily perfect in tone and taste as Fill the Void...There isn't {{a moment when}} Burshtein goes wrong, goes melodramatic, goes didactic, goes false. Working as a woman of faith in a medium looked on with understandable suspicion and skepticism by those who believe as she does, Rama Burshtein has made {{a work of art}} of overwhelming beauty and impact." [...] The New York Post critic Farran Smith Nehme disagreed, writing, [...] "While the social milieu is nicely realized, other parts of the drama are not.

500|$|Baggio is {{considered}} one of the best players of his generation, and one of Italy's greatest players; he is regarded by many as the best Italian player of all-time. Italian journalist Gianni Brera, who had observed both Giuseppe Meazza and Gianni Rivera, stated Baggio was the best Italian player he had <b>ever</b> <b>seen.</b> <b>A</b> world class playmaker with an eye for goal, he was renowned for his vision, creativity and passing ability, but usually played as a second forward throughout his career, as he was known for scoring goals as well as creating them. This led Michel Platini to describe him as a [...] "9 and a half", as he was not a true number 9 striker, due to his creative ability, but he scored more than a number 10 playmaker. He also stated Baggio's playing style coincided with the re-emergence of the attacking midfielder in Italy during the early 2000s. While at Juventus, Gianni Agnelli referred to Baggio as an artist, comparing his elegance to the painter Raffaello, while he described the emerging talent Alessandro Del Piero as Pinturicchio.|$|E
500|$|The {{film was}} {{interpreted}} as tackling a topical, ecologically-minded agenda, though McCarthy {{said it did}} so with a lightness of touch that granted the viewer the ability to accept or ignore the message. Kyle Smith of the New York Post, wrote that by depicting future humans as [...] "a flabby mass of peabrained idiots who are literally too fat to walk", WALL-E was darker and more cynical than any major Disney feature film he could recall. He compared the humans to the patrons of Disney's Parks and Resorts, adding, [...] "I'm also not sure I've <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> <b>a</b> major corporation spend so much money to issue an insult to its customers." [...] Maura Judkis of U.S. News & World Report questioned whether this depiction of [...] "frighteningly obese humans" [...] would resonate with children and make them prefer to [...] "play outside rather than {{in front of the}} computer, to avoid a similar fate". The interpretation led to criticism of the film by conservative commentators such as Glenn Beck, and contributors to National Review Online including Shannen W. Coffin and Jonah Goldberg (although he admitted it was a [...] "fascinating" [...] and occasionally [...] "brilliant" [...] production).|$|E

500|$|After {{graduating from}} high school, Junkin played college {{football}} with the Duke Blue Devils. He played in three games for the Blue Devils as a freshman. In one game against North Carolina State, Junkin had 25 tackles {{en route to a}} 27–26 Duke victory; head coach Steve Sloan stated afterwards that it was [...] "one of the best games I have <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> <b>a</b> freshman play." [...] Between his freshman and sophomore seasons, Junkin went from 205 pounds to 240 to help get more playing time. As a sophomore, he spent the 1984 season as one of five starting linebackers on a modified Duke defense, which normally would have three or four linebackers. In his junior season, he was again a starting linebacker and finished the season with 162 tackles despite playing on an injured knee. Junkin started off his senior year with 15 tackles against Northwestern despite battling a head cold. Three weeks later in a game against Virginia, Junkin had 18 tackles and was named Atlantic Coast Conference defensive player of the week. Junkin graduated from Duke after the 1986 season as the school record-holder for career tackles with 512. Due to his performance his senior year, Junkin was named to the Second Team College Football All-American.|$|E
500|$|The [...] "Pony" [...] Johnson {{murder trial}} {{is based on}} a real-life trial {{featured}} in , the 1991 David Simon non-fiction book about a Baltimore Police Department, which was adapted into the Homicide series. In that real-life trial, a Baltimore detective misspeaks during his testimony and nearly jeopardizes the outcome of the case. This is mirrored by the actions of Kay Howard, who accidentally says the victim was dead at least 24 hours when she meant to say 12 hours, leaving an opening for defense attorney Darin Russom to question her recollection and expertise. The defense attorney in the real-life trial lost the case for himself with a procedural misstep similar to the one portrayed in [...] "And the Rockets Dead Glare". In the episode, Russom asks Howard whether she had <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> <b>a</b> murder victim killed by both a knife and a gun. This allows Howard to mention a second victim police suspect [...] "Pony" [...] Johnson murdered, which she would not have been allowed to mention had Russom not asked her. Homicide filmmakers sought to portray the trial scenes in a far more realistic light than most police drama shows, particularly with the inclusion of less dramatic courtroom elements such as Howard's waiting anxiously to testify and the awkward pauses during her testimony.|$|E
500|$|On 12 October, {{there was}} another TV debate on RTÉ, this time on the Prime Time programme, with the seven {{candidates}} and Miriam O'Callaghan as moderator. The debate, lasting 90 minutes, took place on a Wednesday night, though Prime Time usually aired on a Tuesday and Thursday, and was announced a week in advance. Dana Rosemary Scallon read out a prepared statement {{towards the end of}} the debate, announcing that a [...] "malicious" [...] and [...] "false" [...] accusation has been made against her and her family in the United States and, while refusing to divulge any details, she said she would leave [...] "no stone unturned" [...] in her mission to track down the person or organisation responsible. Scallon was visibly upset and was comforted by other candidates. She met with her lawyers the next day. David Norris expressed sorrow for Scallon and comforted her, also expressing frustration at the general tone of the election campaign and saying the media had libelled him in some of its reports. Scallon told TV3 News on 14 October that a freelance journalist had told her the allegations would appear through the media. Miriam O'Callaghan's treatment of Martin McGuinness resulted in more than 100 complaints to RTÉ. O'Callaghan's RTÉ colleague Pat Kenny said he watched on [...] "with shock and horror because I don't think I've <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> <b>a</b> politician ever interviewed on radio before and more or less called a murderer.
