5|$|Battle for Zendikar was {{a return}} to the plane of Zendikar, which had been ravaged by the Eldrazi horrors. This marks a change in Magics storytelling, where each block's story is shown from the {{perspective}} of a group of planeswalkers called the Gatewatch. Shadows Over Innistrad is {{a return to}} Innistrad, where Avacyn has been corrupted. The next set, Eldritch Moon, focuses on the fact that Emrakul, the most powerful Eldrazi titan who had been missing from the Battle for Zendikar storyline, is now on Innistrad. Together, the Gatewatch must find a way to save the plane from Emrakul's influence. This story also focuses on cosmic horror instead of the traditional gothic <b>horror</b> <b>of</b> old Innistrad.|$|E
5|$|In March 2001, the {{official}} website was set up, which revealed the film's original October 26, 2001 release and a redirect to the film's distributor Constantin Films. The website was fully opened in July 2001, and composed of images, plot info, character biographies and downloads. The film was {{planned to have}} an R-rated classification which is what Anderson wanted since he knew the film had to be Rated-R in order to capture the <b>horror</b> <b>of</b> the games. In January 2002, the film was officially announced to contain an R rating.|$|E

5|$|Revelations {{emphasizes}} survival, evasion, {{and exploration}} over fast-paced combat {{by providing the}} player with limited ammunition, health, and movement speed. It was designed {{to bring back the}} content and <b>horror</b> <b>of</b> the series' roots, {{while at the same time}} trying to modernize the gameplay. Revelations was also the first game to support the Nintendo 3DS Circle Pad Pro outside Japan. The game was a moderate commercial success and received generally positive reviews from video game publications. Several critics praised its graphics, sound effects, and horror setting, but some criticized its inconsistent gameplay between scenarios.|$|E

5|$|The final scene, {{in which}} Radar informs {{everyone}} {{of the death}} of Henry Blake was unprecedented: {{it was the first time}} in American television history that a main character departing a comedy series was killed off in a tragic way. When Stevenson decided to leave the series part way through the third season, Gene Reynolds and Larry Gelbart, the show's producers, decided to make a statement regarding the unexpectedness and <b>horror</b> <b>of</b> war, especially with the Vietnam War fresh in people's minds.|$|E
5|$|The series {{tells the}} story of the {{citizens}} of Kurōzu-cho, a fictional city which is plagued by a supernatural curse involving spirals. The story for Uzumaki originated when Ito attempted to write a story about people living in a very long terraced house, and he was inspired to use a spiral shape to achieve the desired length. Ito believes the <b>horror</b> <b>of</b> Uzumaki is effective due to its subversion of symbols which are normally positively portrayed in Japanese media, and its theme of protagonists struggling against a mysterious force stronger than themselves.|$|E
5|$|Sercey retired {{with his}} frigates to Île de France, {{where he learned}} to his <b>horror</b> <b>of</b> the {{opportunity}} he had missed in the Bali Strait. His squadron required extensive repairs, but the Colonial Committee on Île de France remained rebellious over attempts to abolish slavery and denied his ships men and food supplies. Eventually Sercey was forced to disband his squadron, sending four frigates back to France. Seven years after the Bali Strait Incident, in 1804, early in the Napoleonic Wars, another strong French naval squadron encountered a much larger China Fleet at the Battle of Pulo Aura. As in 1797, Nathaniel Dance, the EIC Commodore, managed to bluff the French admiral into believing there were warships among his convoy and the French retired after a brief exchange of gunfire.|$|E

5|$|Well-established {{stars like}} Peter O'Toole and {{sporting}} legends like Stirling Moss took uncredited {{parts in the}} film {{just to be able}} to work with the other members of the cast. Stunt director Richard Talmadge employed Geraldine Chaplin to appear in a brief Keystone Cops insert. The film also proved to be young Anjelica Huston's first experience in the film industry as she was called upon by her father, John Huston, to cover the screen shots of Deborah Kerr's hands. The film also marks the debut of Dave Prowse, later the physical form of Darth Vader in the Star Wars series, as Frankenstein's monster, a role he would later play again in the Hammer films The <b>Horror</b> <b>of</b> Frankenstein and Frankenstein and the Monster from Hell. John Le Mesurier features in the early scenes of the film as M's driver.|$|E
5|$|Caracalla's {{memory was}} revived {{in the art}} of late {{eighteenth-century}} French painters. His tyrannical career became the subject of the work of several French painters such as Greuze, , David, Bonvoisin, J.A.C. Pajou, and Lethière. Their fascination with Caracalla was a reflection of the growing discontent of the French people with the French monarchy. Caracalla's visibility was influenced by the existence of several literary sources in French that included both translations of ancient works and contemporary works of the time. Caracalla's likeness was readily available to the painters due to the distinct style of his portraiture and his unusual soldier-like choice of fashion that distinguished him from other emperors. The artworks may have served as a warning that absolute monarchy could become the <b>horror</b> <b>of</b> tyranny and that disaster could come about if the regime failed to reform. Art historian Susan Wood suggests that this reform was for the absolute monarchy to become a constitutional monarchy, as per the original goal of revolution, rather than the republic that it eventually became. Wood also notes the similarity between Caracalla and his crimes leading to his assassination and the eventual uprising against, and death of, King Louis XVI: both rulers had {{died as a result of}} their apparent tyranny.|$|E
5|$|Latin American {{novels that}} explore {{political}} themes, but {{that do not}} centre upon the rule of a particular dictator, are informally classified as “not quite dictator novels”. For example, Libro de Manuel (A Manual for Manuel, 1973), by Julio Cortázar, is a postmodern novel about urban guerrillas and their revolutionary struggle, which asks the reader to examine the broader societal matters of language, sexuality, and the modes of interpretation. In the Time of the Butterflies (1994), by Julia Álvarez, {{tells the story of}} the Mirabal sisters, whom patriotism transformed from well-behaved Catholic débutantes to political dissenters against the thirty-year dictatorship of the Trujillo régime in the Dominican Republic. The novel sought to illuminate the officially-obscured-history of the deaths of the Mirabal sisters, not to determine what happened to them, but to determine how the Mirabal sisters happened to the national politics of the Dominican Republic. In the mock-diary “Intimate Diary of Solitude” (third part of El imperio de los sueños 1988; Empire of Dreams, 1994), by Giannina Braschi, the protagonist is Mariquita Samper, the diarist who shoots the narrator of the Latin American Boom in revolt against his dictatorial control of the fictional narration. Moreover, in Braschi’s most recent work “United States of Banana” (2011), the Puerto Rican prisoner Segismundo overthrows his father, the King of the United States of Banana, who had imprisoned him for more than a hundred years in the dungeon of the Statue of Liberty, for the crime of having been born. The story of Distant Star (1996), by Roberto Bolaño, begins on 11 September 1973, with the coup d’état by General Augusto Pinochet against Salvador Allende, the President of Chile. The writer and professor of literature Raymond Leslie Williams describes the aforementioned novels as not-quite-dictator-novels, which are reminiscent of the genre for being “acutely and subtly political fiction” that addresses themes different from those of the dictator novel, which cannot be divorced from the politics of the stories, and so each “can be read as a meditation on the <b>horror</b> <b>of</b> absolute power”.|$|E

5|$|Megan Hunt (Dana Delany) and Todd Fleming (Jeffrey Nordling) {{are called}} to Lacey's (Mary Mouser) school when she is seen looking at photos of a young woman, Nikki Parkson (Mary Fegreus) who died, after battling a {{terminal}} illness. When Megan looks at a photo, she sees irregularities and without permission from Kate Murphy (Jeri Ryan), Megan and Peter Dunlop (Nicholas Bishop) stop Nikki being buried, so they can look at her body, much to the <b>horror</b> <b>of</b> Nikki's mother Lillian (Jill Eikenberry). Although Nikki's family say that she committed suicide, Megan finds evidence to suggest otherwise; Nikki's neck has bruising on the bottom, showing that she was strangled. Nikki was being given pills to help her illness by Lillian, though these made her worse, but this kept Lillian in the social limelight, getting sympathy from friends; however Lillian did not kill her. Samantha Baker (Sonja Sohn), Megan, Ethan Gross (Geoffrey Arend) and Curtis Brumfield (Windell Middlebrooks) find out that Nikki's boyfriend Shane (Charlie Semine) was actually working together with Nikki's sister Sara (Jo Armeniox). It is revealed that Shane and Sara killed Nikki, as in Nikki's will she was giving all her money to a fake wildlife foundation which Sara had set up. However, Nikki wanted to switch charities, so Sara killed her to stop her from doing this, with Shane helping her to stage it as suicide, so they could both get the money.|$|E
5|$|The {{boys and}} the backpackers visit a water park, where Jay intends to find his ex-girlfriend, Jane. The park staff tell Jay that Jane has found a new job in the vast Outback, which leaves Jay feeling very dejected. Lucy tells Simon via Skype that Jane {{is working on a}} stud farm in the remote {{settlement}} of Birdsville, and the boys intend to drive there. Their car runs out of petrol {{in the middle of the}} desert. The group hold hands together as they realise that they will most likely die, but are rescued by Jane and her co-workers. She realises how far Jay came to win her over again, and although she is touched by the gesture, she does not take him back. Back at Jay's uncle's house, the boys find that their parents have travelled to find them after hearing of their near-death experience. The boys are shocked to find Mr Gilbert (their old head of sixth form and Will's nemesis) there too, and Will's mother announces that she and Gilbert are in a relationship, to the abject <b>horror</b> <b>of</b> Will and amusement of the other three friends. Over Skype, Lucy breaks-up with Simon because she is now in a relationship with his university 'best friend' Pete, which Simon responds to by cheering and abruptly hanging-up on her.|$|E
5|$|The game {{begins with}} Nowe {{becoming}} a fully-fledged Knight of the Seal. During his first mission, Nowe begins {{to doubt the}} ethics of the Knights' methods, as the seals require human sacrifices to remain strong. During a second mission to ensure {{the protection of the}} seal in the District of Soul Flame, Nowe encounters Manah, who kills the guardian Zhangpo and destroys the seal. Manah is sentenced to be burnt at the stake, but uses her magic to escape. After returning from the mission, Nowe is poisoned by Gismor, who reveals to have killed Nowe's adoptive father Oror. Surviving and escaping with Legna, Nowe is pursued by the Knights, including Eris, who wishes to persuade him to return. Nowe and Legna eventually meet up with Manah and join her on her quest to destroy the seals and, in her mind, free the people from the Knights' oppression. On their way to the second seal, Manah shows Nowe the true <b>horror</b> <b>of</b> the Knights' oppression, fully winning him over. The two then fight and kill Lieutenant Hanch, destroying the seal in the District of Hallowed Water. After this, they are joined by Urick, a former Lieutenant of the Knights, to rout a group of bandits. Attacked by the Knights, they are unexpectedly saved by Caim, who is also working to destroy the seals and free his dragon Angelus from the pain of being the Goddess Seal. After taking down Lieutenant Yaha and destroying the seal in the District of Precious Light, Manah is captured by the Knights and sentenced to death. Nowe manages to rescue her and heads for the seal in the District of Shining Life, which was once guarded by Urick before he fled in fear when Caim attacked the district. Urick and Nowe face off against Caim, who mortally wounds Urick before being driven off. Urick dies content and the seal is destroyed.|$|E
