The formation of MACs for cyclohexanol and cyclopentanol also suggest the existence of similar species for sterols. Carbonate adducts of fructose, glucose, and sucrose were also detected, which suggests that these counterparts of the well-known phosphates can also occur in the cytosol.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Double-cation <b>hydroxy</b> <b>compounds,</b> {{generally}} {{with the}} pyroaurite-type structure, were synthesized by a reaction involving the hydrolysis of a cation in solution by a fully hydrolysed and precipitated hydroxide {{of a second}} metallic ation. Synthesis {{of this type of}} compound is not limited to reactions between di- and trivalent cations as previously thought but can, in this process, involve divalent-divalent, divalent-tetravalent and trivalent-trivalent cations. Crystalline compounds with reasonably sharp XRD patterns formed generally within a few hours at 25 ~ at pH 4 - 8. 5 depending on the cations involved. The technique presents a more rapid method of formation of these compounds than previously described syntheses, and has been called induced hydrolysis because the fully hydrolysed cation causes complete hydrolysis of the second cation at a pH below that at which this would normally occur. The minerals takovite, Ni 6 A 12 (OH) I 6 CO 39 H 20, and hydrotalcite, Mg 6 A 12 (OH) 16 CO 3 9 H 20, were amongst some of the compounds formed and the reaction is considered to be more realistic in terms of conditions encountered in natural environments than previous yntheses. The reactions described could also be expected to affect the mobility of heavy elements in the environment. These double <b>hydroxy</b> <b>compounds</b> convert on heating between 300 - 500 ~ to double-metal oxides with the spinel structure.

These three alkaloids nuclei are widespread in nature and have shown many potential pharmaceutical properties. The cyclic imines were typically synthesised by thionation and alkylation of their corresponding lactams, although other cyclic imines were investigated. The imines were then reacted with diphenylcyclopropenone (DPP). The pyrrolizidine, indolizidine and pyrroloazepine reactivity was exploited by oxidising the bridgehead group (X = S) with m-CPBA, giving rise to new products, including a sulfoxide elimination product, and an unexpected <b>hydroxy</b> <b>compound.</b> This was a useful discovery, given the presence of such a bridgehead OH in the jenamidine natural products.

Hydroxypiperaquine (HPQ) is an antimalarial bisquinoline compound related to the emerging antimalarial drug Piperaquine (PQ). 2 Various research programs are being conducted internationally in efforts to prepare PQ for possible clinical use in combination with artemisinin derivatives. The <b>hydroxy</b> <b>compound</b> (HPQ) has been described in the Chinese literature but no data exists for this compound within the Western literature. 3 The primary aim of this research project was to synthesise Hydroxypiperaquine via alternative synthetic pathways to that briefly described by Xu et al 3 by exploring various synthetic strategies based on literature synthetic procedures involving similar compounds. HPQ was synthesised through a three step synthetic process. In the first step, tertiary butoxy carbonyl (tBOC) piperazine was coupled with 4, 7 -dichloroquine (4, 7 -DCQ) to produce the intermediate 7 -chloro- 4 -(tBOC piperazin- 1 -yl) quinoline. The second synthetic step involved the deprotection of 7 -chloro- 4 -(tBOCpiperazinyl) quinoline to remove the tertiary butoxy carbonyl (tBOC) protecting group. The deprotected intermediate, 7 -chloro- 4 -(piperazin- 1 -yl) quinoline, was subsequently reacted with 1, 3 -dichloropropanol in 1 -pentanol to yield HPQ in the third step.

The Fe(II) -AI(III) hydroxy-chloride and-sulfate compounds are isostructural with Fe(II) -Fe(III) "green rust " compounds with AI essentially substituting for Fe(III). Where CO 3 ~ is the only anion in the system, an Fe(II) -AI(III) compound isostructural with hydrotalcite is formed. Either in the dried or wet state, these compounds are unstable in air due to oxidation of Fe(II). Oxidation of the dried sample in air yields akaganeite oraluminous ferrihydrite, whereas, if the sample is maintained ina moist condition and oxidized by air under water, lepidocrocite or aluminous goethite is produced along with small amounts of ferfihydrite.

Therefore the inhibition of phospholipase A by autoxidized lipid was studied was observed in linolenate which was oxidized at 40 ℃ for four days. By method-A in which the phospholipase A activity was determined after preincubation of the enzyme with the autoxidized linolenate at 25 ℃ for 30 min, 0. 8 μg of phospholipase A was brought to 30 % loss of the activity by 1. 2 μg of the autoxidized linolenate, while by method-B in which the activity was determined {{in the presence of}} the autoxidized linolenate without the preincubation, the same loss rate of the enzyme activity (0. 8 μg) required 800 μg of the autoxidized linolenate.

40|$|Prostate {{diseases}} are {{a serious threat}} to the health and quality of life of ageing males. Prostate cells are hormone-dependent and as such are stimulated by androgens, for example testosterone (T) and dlhydrotestcsterone (DHT). Of the androgens, it is DHT that is the more potent. DHT is formed through the enzyme catalysed reduction of T by 5 a-reductase (5 AR) and requires NADPH as a co-factor. This enzyme {{is one of the major}} targets in androgen therapy for the treatment of prostate diseáses since a reduction in DHT levels would result in a subsequent decrease in the stimulation of hormone-dependent prostate cells without affecting the amount of T produced by the prostate or the testes. As such, 5 AR inhibitors would be expected to possess less side-effects, such as loss of libido. A number of compounds (steroidal and non-steroidal) have previously been reported as potent inhibitors of 5 AR but only a few have entered clinical trials and even fewer have entered the clinic. As such, the development 'of a potent non-steroidal inhibitor is crucial in the fight against hormone-dependent prostatic diseases. In the current study, we have reviewed the strategy for the treatment of hormone¬dependent prostate diseases and, in particular, we have considered the reported inhibitors of two of the most important enzymes, namely 17 a-hydroxylase/ 17, 20 - lyase (P 45017 a) and 5 AR. Within the research group, we have undertaken extensive studies into the molecular modelling of compounds against 5 AR and therefore gained an insight into the active site of this enzyme. From our studies we determined the mimicking of the steroid A-ring was an important feature of a potential inhibitor. Furthermore, we determined that the coumarin backbone would undergo a reduction reaction (i. e. mimic the natural substrate) and therefore possess inhibitory activity. We have therefore synthesised a number of coumarin based compounds. In particular, we have synthesised a wide range of esters of the hydroxylated coumarin backbone. That is, using 4 - and 7 - hydroxycoumarin as starting material we reacted the. <b>hydroxy</b> <b>compound</b> with a range of acyl chlorides (from acetyl to decanoyl). In general, the reactions using 7 -hydroxycoumarin proceeded in good yield and without major problems, although the larger alkyl chain containing acyl chlorides proved to be slow in reacting with 7 -hydroxycoumarin, and the time of reaction needed to be extended. The esters resulting from the use of 4 -hydroxycoumarin proved to be relatively unstable and were observed to undergo hydrolysis with standing, however, it was possible to undertake spectral analysis (except elemental analysis) prior to degradation of the esters. The range of potential inhibitors were purified and fully characterised. A second aim of the study was to evaluate the synthesised compounds against 5 AR, however, due to a lack of time, this was not achieved...|$|E
40|$|That the dissociated o-carboxyl radical {{renders the}} {{adjacent}} ester bond unstable is similarly observable {{in the case}} of Aspirin. On the other hand, the fact that PS becomes more stable with the decrease of pH values from 5. 6 to 1 {{may be due to the}} decrease of dissociation of o-carboxyl group (pKa= 3. 8), and also due to the gradual depression in the pH range beyound 4. 0 of dissociation of primary phosphoric acid radical. However, the fact that at pH 1 phosphosalicylic acid is more labile than phenyl phosphate indicates the effect of o-carboxyl group even at its undissociated state. With respect to the stability of phosphosalicylic acid at alkaline pH, despite the dissociated carboxyl group, it must be assumed that dissociation of both primary and secondary acid radicals of phosphate is related. Sulfate ester of salicylic acid is revealed also to be stable in an alkaline solution. However, it hydrolyzes with ease at pH lower than 5 where it begins to change into monoionic form. Therefore this ester is labile when its sujfate group is dissociated while the o-carboxyl group remains undissociated. Some metal ions enhanced the rate of the non-enzymatic hydrolysis of phosphosalicylic acid. Cu^ was shown to accerelate the hydrolysis at the optimum pH of 5. 6. However, in the solution simply buffered, without any addition of heavy metal ions, the spontaneous hydrolysis observed was not due to a contamination with some metal ions, since even previous treatment of each solution used, PS and buffer solutions, with Amberlite IR 120 and successive pH adjusting did not cause a change of the rate of hydrolysis as well the optimum pH, and also it was observed that the enhancing influence of added Cu^ was counteracted by the simultaneous presence of EDTA or rubeanic acid, so that the hydrolysis went on as in the case without any addition. Fe^ facilitated markedly the hydrolysis of phosphosalicylic acid; however, in this case at optimum pH 2 where the compound is otherwise fairly stable. The hydrolysis at 37 ° of the sulfate ester of salicylic acid was facilitated also by Fe^ and in this case again at optimum pH 2; but Cu^ has no effect at all pH values. On the other hand, Cu^ facilitated the hydrolysis of salicylaldehyde phosphate at optimum pH 5. 6, but Fe^ has no influence of its hydrolysis. However, Cu^ and Few were effective neither to cause hydrolysis of salicylaldehyde sufate nor to enhance the ester cleavage of acetyl salicylic acid (Aspirin). Phenyl sulfate, phenyl phosphate, p-nitrophenyl phosphate, and glycero phosphate remained uneffected by the presence of Fe^ or Cu^. The enhancing action of ferric and cupric ions should be attributed to a production of chelate compounds which make labile the ester bonds. Then the result shown above seems to indicate that when a monoester composed of an aromatic <b>hydroxy</b> <b>compound</b> and an inorganic acid, be it phosphoric or sulfuric acid ester, is substituted at o-position by carboxyl, the chelate formation with Fe^ is maximum at pH 2, while when substituted by o-aldehyde group, the monoesters do not form Fe-chelate compound. On the otherhand, aromatic phosphate esters with o-carbonyl groups (o-carboxyl or o-aldehyde group) reveal the maximum chelation with Cu^ at pH 5. 6, but not that of sulfate ester with o-aldehyde. Acetyl salicylate seems unlikely to form a chelate compound with Fe^ or Cu^. When the rare earth metal ions such as Ce^ and La^ were used as catalyst, the hydrolysis of PS was most rapid at pH 7. This reflects the overlapping of two factors, namely of their catalytic effect which should be at most in alkaline medium {{in the case of}} other phosphate esters, such as p-nitrophenyl phosphate, phenyl phosphate, and glycero phosphate, and of the inherent maximal instability above discussed of PS at pH 5. 6. However, Ce^ was contrary to other rare metal ions, most effective for phosphosalicylic acid hydrolysis in pH range 3 - 6. Phosphosalicyl酸(PS) はsalicyl酸の燐酸エステルであるが,これが水溶液中にて非酵素的に燐酸とsalicyl酸とに氷解される速度がpH 5. 6 で甚だ大であり,溶液のpHがこれよりもアルカリ性また酸性になるにつれて氷解度は次第に小となり,強アルカリ性また強酸性では氷解をうけないと云う興味ある現象が間中により発見された。そののち間中新井はphosphosalicyl酸の誘導体の被氷解性に関する実験成績を報告したが,最近Chanley,Gindler,Sobotkaは上述の成績を確認し,それら化合物の自然氷解の機構に関し論している。著者はこの燐酸エステル氷解の特殊なpH依存性は燐酸酵素作用機構に関し何等かの示唆を与えないかとの興味から再びこの問題をとり上げ,この特殊な氷解機構について検討した。本論文にその実験成績について報告する。The rate of spontaneous hydrolysis at 37 ℃ of phosphosalicylic acid (PS), the phosphate ester of salicylic acid, is most rapid at pH 5. 6. It slows down as the pH value of the solution becomes larger or smaller and thus the compound is stable in an alkaline as well as in a strongly acidic solution. In general, phosphate esters undergo hydrolysis with ease when they exist in monoionic form (in the range of pH 3 - 5) as was demonstrated this time with p-nitrophenyl phosphate (at 37 °, in 24 hours) and phenyl phosphate (at 100 °, in 2 hours). However hydrolysis at pH 4 - 6 of PS proceeds by far the faster than those other aromatic phosphate esters. Hence, it may be said that the ester bond with phenolic OH is made unstable through the introduction of carboxyl group at o-position. This assumption could be ascertained by the observation that the sulfate ester of salicylic acid hydrolyzes in acid medium much faster than phenyl sulfate. o-Aldehyde group has also similar action of making ester bonds unstable, though to a less extent than arised by introduction of 0 -cardoxyl radical: with respect to the ease of spontaneous hydrolysis at acid medium, phosphosalicylaldehyde- and the sulfate ester of salicylaldehyde situate between PS and phenyl phosphate, and between the sulfate ester of salicylic acid and phenyl sulfate, respectively. Though the o-aldehyde group of phosphosalicylaldehyde causes as above mentioned the lability of adjacent ester bond, it does not exhibit snch a peculiar pH dependency, as observed in the case of PS. The enhancement of hydrolysis of PS by approaching of pH of the solution from alkaline values to the optimum 5. 6 may be accounted by that the secondary dissociation of its phosphate radical becomes gradually depressed and the general property of phosphate esters to be thermolabile in their monoionic state, is revealed now by the dissociation of o-carboxyl group even at a low temperature as 37 °...|$|E

These <b>hydroxy</b> <b>compounds</b> are then reacted with methacryloyl chloride to lead to novel amino-diphosphonate methacrylates MACnNP 2 (with 2 6 n 6 11). These highly pure methacrylate monomers were obtained with yields higher than 75 %. Radical copolymerizations of MACnNP 2 (with 2 6 n 6 11) with MMA have been conducted and the r 1 values (related to MACnNP 2) {{are in the range}} of 1. 1 – 1. 3, and r 2 values (related to MMA) about 0. 8; this shows that the diphosphonate groups are statistically bonded to the methacrylic backbone...|$|R
40|$|The {{aquatic fern}} Azolla {{is one of}} the {{fastest-growing}} nitrogen-fixing plants on Earth and therefore considered as a potential source of biomass for bioenergy production. The lipid fraction from Azolla filiculoides was analyzed to investigate whether it suited biodiesel production. Since the productivity of Azolla is further increased at higher CO 2 concentrations, A. filiculoides biomass was produced at 800 ppm CO 2 mimicking a cultivation system utilizing CO 2 waste from industry. The harvested biomass contained 7. 92 [*]±[*] 0. 14 % dry weight (dw) crude lipids. Drying conditions did not significantly affect lipid composition or yields, indicating that drying conditions may be energetically optimized without the risk of product loss. Total lipid extracts contained 4. 2 [*]±[*] 0. 38 % free fatty acids. Of the crude lipid fraction, 41 [*]±[*] 13 % consisted of fatty acids that were converted into fatty acid methyl esters upon saponification in methanol. Unique mid-chain (di) <b>hydroxy</b> <b>compounds</b> constituted 7. 2 [*]±[*] 2. 8 % of the crude lipids. Based on the fatty acid profile, it was estimated that Azolla biodiesel meets requirements set by the EN 14214 standard on fuel density, cetane number, and iodine value. The cold filter plugging point (CFPP), however, is expected to be too high due to relatively high concentrations of lignoceric acid and the presence of the mid-chain (di) <b>hydroxy</b> <b>compounds.</b> To produce high-quality biodiesel from Azolla lipids, therefore, a fractionation step will be required removing these compounds. As an advantage, the long-chain alcohols and (di) hydroxy fatty acids obtained after fractionation may provide a valuable secondary product stream with applications to chemical industry and nutrition...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} alpha- and delta-tocopherol on {{inhibition}} of hydroperoxides, keto and <b>hydroxy</b> <b>compounds</b> at Rancimat conditions, i. e. 100 ºC and air bubbling, were studied in samples of fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) obtained from high linoleic (HL) and high oleic (HO) sunflower oils. Simple hydroperoxides from methyl linoleate and oleate and keto and <b>hydroxy</b> <b>compounds</b> derived from methyl linoleate hydroperoxides {{were analyzed by}} HPLC-UV-ELS. Different tocopherol concentrations, namely, 10, 50, 100, 500 and 1000 mg/kg, were tested. Irrespective of the lipid substrate and the initial concentration of tocopherol, {{results showed that the}} content of hydroperoxides accumulated during the induction period was remarkably higher in the samples containing delta-tocopherol. The relative concentrations of oleate hydroperoxides in the HO samples were also higher in the presence of delta-tocopherol. Alpha-tocopherol was more effective in inhibiting hydroperoxides at low levels, being 100 mg/kg its optimal concentration, while delta-tocopherol displayed optimal protection at 1000 mg/kg. Under the oxidation conditions applied, neither alpha- nor delta-tocopherol showed a protective effect on hydroperoxide decomposition at any level assayed. Formation of keto- and hydroxy-dienes was more related to the concentration of their hydroperoxide precursors. Furthermore, both tocopherols gave rise to increased concentrations of ketodienes at 500 and 1000 mg/kg compared to the controls. Such an effect was more pronounced for alpha-tocopherol and in the HL samples.

All of the experimental conditions for the degradation tests were carried out according to the response of the surface modeling methods developed. The direct photolysis and the UV/H 2 O 2 processes were capable to degrade more than 99 % of the initial concentrations of total phenolic components of produced water. The main by-product found was 2, 6 -di-tert-butylbenzoquinone (DBQ). The presence of DBQ and other <b>hydroxy</b> <b>compounds,</b> constituting the major fraction of by-products identified, demonstrates that the degradations are initiated by the oxidation of the aromatic phenolic ring generating quinones, diphenols, benzoic acids and phenones...|$|R
40|$|Alicyclic diols can {{hydrogen}} bond {{in many different}} ways and yield most interesting structures. In this thesis, eight C 2 -symmetric diols 48 - 50, 78, 79 and 81 - 83 were synthesized and their crystal structures were determined. No less than seven of these show unusual solid state behaviour: 48 and 78 are inclusion hosts; 49, 50 and 78 form doubly-stranded hydrogen-bonded ladder structures, where there is a strong preference for each strand to be homochiral; 78, 81 and 82 undergo self-resolution during recrystallization; and 83 forms chirally pure crystals (but the material is still racemic). - One of the favourable supramolecular synthons for <b>hydroxy</b> <b>compounds</b> is the (O-H) 6 cycle of {{hydrogen bond}}s. When this cycle is formed by a racemic compound, its enantiomers alternate down-up-down etc. around the cycle. No case of an (O-H) 6 cycle involving chirally pure <b>hydroxy</b> <b>compounds</b> is known. These observations indicate a strong preference for the (O-H) 6 cycle being constructed from achiral or racemic molecules rather than from chirally pure hydroxyl compounds. Racemic (±) - 48 and (±) - 92 which are already known to form (O-H) 6 cycles in the solid state were prepared in chirally pure form and their X-ray crystal structures determined. No (O-H) 6 cycles were observed for these homochiral diols. These findings confirm that the (O-H) 6 motif occurs only for achiral or racemic compounds. - Similarly, the edge-to-edge eight-membered aryl C-HN dimer involves either achiral molecules or those of opposite chirality. No chirally pure dimers of this type are reported. Racemic compounds 42 - 44 that are known to pack using the C-HN dimer were synthesized in chirally pure form. No edge-to-edge eight-membered aryl C-HN dimers were formed in the solid state. Hence this supramolecular synthon is only favoured for achiral or racemic compounds only. - Other major conclusions are that the cause of self-resolution is due to packing energy. In some cases it is likely that solvent choice, or solvent plus temperature selection, can be used to control self-resolution...|$|R
30|$|S. cerevisiae GRE 2 is {{currently}} {{being used as a}} versatile biocatalyst for the stereoselective synthesis of <b>hydroxy</b> <b>compounds,</b> which serve as building blocks in the production of pharmaceuticals and other fine chemicals (Choi et al. 2010; Ema et al. 2008; Müller et al. 2010; Park et al. 2010). Another advantageous feature of GRE 2 is a decomposer in bacteria. For example, GRE 2 is used for glycolaldehyde degradation during bioethanol production in S. cerevisiae (Jayakody et al. 2013). In addition, a S. cerevisiae strain overexpressing a GRE 2 with site-directed mutagenesis exhibited enhanced furfural and 5 -hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) detoxification (Moon and Liu 2012). Conversely, in a S. cerevisiae GRE 2 knockout strain growth was suppressed by environmental stress (Warringer and Blomberg 2006), and filament formation was increased in the presence of isoamyl alcohol (Hauser et al. 2007). Hence, GRE 2 is regarded as a key enzyme necessary for inhibitor and stress tolerance in S. cerevisiae.|$|R

Selected Baylis-Hillman products have been brominated, hydrolysed and acetylated to afford substrates for the synthesis of necic acid analogues. The diastereo- and regioselectivity of nucleophilic attack, using sodium methylmercaptan, on the Baylis-Hillman products and selected brominated derivatives was investigated. The allylic <b>hydroxy</b> <b>compounds</b> favour conjugate addition with the generation of a new chiral centre, while the allylic bromo derivatives favour substitution (SN and SN) with consequent loss of chirality. (E) - 2 -Isopropylcrotonic acid, a vital precursor in the synthesis of all stereoisomers of trachelanthic and viridifloric acid, was synthesised {{in an attempt to}} obtain the necic acid components required for total alkaloid synthesis of lycopsamine and its derivatives.

40|$|International audienceSyntheses of new phosphonated methacrylates with 2 or 3 {{hydrocarbon}} methylene spacers {{were investigated}} {{in order to}} avoid the conventional methacrylation of hydroxyphosphonate compounds with methacryloyl chloride. The first possibility concerns the esterification of methacrylic anhydride in the presence of either 2 -hydroxyethylphosphonate or 3 -hydroxypropylphosphonate. This reaction was proved to be quantitative when a basic catalyst, i. e. n-methylimidazole, was used at 60 °C. However, this reaction also generates a side product, i. e. methacrylic acid, which was difficult to remove due to it having similar solubility to both dimethyl(2 -methacryloyloxyethyl) phosphonate and dimethyl(2 -methacryloyloxypropyl) phosphonate. The second process was based on the alcoholysis of MMA in the presence of the above <b>hydroxy</b> <b>compounds.</b> This reaction also proceeded quantitatively with Zr(AcAc) 4 as acid catalyst. Unlike esterification of methacrylic anhydride, this second process did not require any solvent. The final phosphonated methacrylates were obtained with high purity, as the side product of the reaction (i. e., methanol) could be easily removed due to the azeotropic behavior of MMA/Methanol...|$|R

The interaction of the pyridyl moiety of PyNI with hexafluoro- 2 -propanol (HFIP) {{gave rise to a}} hydrogen-bonded complex, whereas a more stable, hydrogen-bonded ion pair was formed with trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). Time-resolved fluorescence measurements demonstrate that hydrogen bonding with HFIP is a reversible process, even in the excited state, and revealed the rate constants of the various energy dissipation processes. The fluorescence yield enhancement of about one order of magnitude upon the 1 : 1 binding of PyNI to HFIP or TFA is primarily attributed to the deceleration of the internal conversion, and the fluorescence proved to be the dominant deactivation pathway of the singlet excited complexes. Both PyNI and its TFA complex produced fluorescent exciplexes with naphthalene. Protonation of PyNI markedly decreases the energy of the exciplex, leading to faster radiationless energy dissipation as well as to slow dissociation into an excited PyNI–TFA complex and ground-state naphthalene...|$|R
