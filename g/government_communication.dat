5|$|While {{the party}} was in power, press {{secretary}} Alastair Campbell installed a centralised organisation to co-ordinate <b>government</b> <b>communication</b> and impose a united message to be delivered by ministers. Charlie Whelan, Gordon Brown's press officer, was often in conflict with Campbell because of the former's attempts to brief the press by his own initiatives; this continued until his resignation in 1999. Campbell followed a professional approach to media relations {{to ensure that a}} clear message was presented, and the party planned stories in advance to ensure a positive media reaction. Campbell used his own experience in journalism; he was known for his attention to detail and effective use of sound bites. Campbell developed a relationship with News International, providing their newspapers with early information in return for positive media coverage.|$|E

2500|$|Despite initial {{resistance}} to {{recognition of this}} doctrine by the courts, the landmark GCHQ case firmly established procedural protection of legitimate expectations. In the case, strikes by civil servants at the <b>Government</b> <b>Communication</b> Headquarters had destabilized operations and were seen {{as a threat to}} national security. The Government of the United Kingdom took swift action to limit the rights of GCHQ employees to join unions, permitting them only to belong to an approved departmental staff association. The applicant organization challenged this decision by arguing that it should have been consulted because of a long-standing practice of doing so. In his judgment, Lord Fraser regarded the term legitimate as synonymous to [...] "reasonable" [...] and identified two ways in which a legitimate expectation could arise, namely, [...] "either from an express promise given on behalf of a public authority or from the existence of a regular practice which the claimant can reasonably expect to continue." ...|$|E

40|$|This master thesis {{studies the}} current Danish <b>Government’s</b> <b>communication.</b> We {{believe that there}} is a {{connection}} between the <b>government’s</b> <b>communication</b> and why the media claim that the government is more liberal than socialistic. This master thesis is based on a rhetorical study of excerpts of the Danish Prime Minister’s speeches as well as excerpts of the government platform. The aim is to find out whether or not the Danish Government itself expresses a more “liberal” than “socialist” communication and as a conclusion, perhaps mislead the population and voters. The master thesis starts by elaborating the theoretical foundation which we have been inspired by in the process of studying the <b>government’s</b> <b>communication.</b> Within a hermeneutic and social constructivist rhetorical understanding the theoretical foundation of this master thesis is based on both rhetorical topics theory and framing theory. To study whether or not the Danish Government itself express a liberal communication we need to define the difference in how liberal and socialist politicians typically talk about specific political topics such as education, environmental issues and foreign policy. To do so, we have interviewed three Danish political experts for the purpose of defining typical liberal and socialist communication. Based on the interview study as well as the theoretical foundation we have carefully examined a number of selected speeches as well as the government platform. We conclude that the Danish Government has a tendency to fluctuate between a socialist and a liberal communication, which may be misleading the population and voters, as there is a risk that they do not understand the political statement of the government. We find that the <b>government’s</b> <b>communication</b> is not consistent to what people expect from a left-wing government, which can be a problem, as the voters may become confused. The current Danish Government is found to be an accomplice in misrepresenting itself as being a socialistic government. We conclude that the Government must rethink its communication in order to appear as a more left-wing government. We believe that the first step for the Danish Government is to standardise a socialist communication and leave out all arguments that can be categorized as liberal <b>communication.</b> Furthermore the <b>government</b> must focus on exemplifying more core socialist values so that the left-wing voters can identify themselves with the Government’s politics. By reconsidering the communication, we conclude that the Government would be able to appear more socialist and re-create a socialist storytelling about its politics...|$|R

A model of <b>government</b> crisis <b>communication</b> transparency was developed to identify known antecedents. The authors collected and analyzed special issue news reports on the 2014 AirAsia QZ 8501 crash from the detik. com website. There were 328 articles citing government as the information source, which the authors used to construct a framework to guide their media content analysis of these articles. Our findings strongly indicate that openness of the search and rescue process is the most salient antecedent to the media 2 ̆ 7 s positive perceptions of government transparency in crisis communication on ongoing search and rescue operations. Other antecedents of importance are management and structure, information quality, government leadership, and ICT use. A revised model of government transparency in crisis communication is constructed which {{underscores the importance of}} implementing open government policy to enhance transparent <b>government</b> crisis <b>communication.</b> The research contribution of this paper is this revised model of government transparency that considers the unique context of crisis communication, something the literature has not fully explored...|$|R
