30|$|Central to {{the concept}} of {{sustainable}} agriculture is the reduction of environmental costs associated with farming. Among others, it requires responsible use of chemical fertilizers. This can be achieved through use of suitable fertilizer types and application rates timed to crop demand, seasons, and weather conditions with low risk of fertilizer loss to the environment. Responsible use of chemical fertilizers also requires utilization of effective fertilizer application techniques. In contrast to conventional fertilizer application by even broadcast on the soil surface (with or without incorporation), several innovative <b>fertilizer</b> <b>placement</b> techniques have been developed, through which fertilizer can be targeted to the seed, root, or canopy of young crop plants. Furthermore, <b>fertilizer</b> <b>placement</b> in soil improves fertilizer acquisition by target crop plants as opposed to weeds [16, 17] and reduces the risk of nutrient loss to the environment. Based on fertilizer composition, application technique and timing, effective <b>fertilizer</b> <b>placement</b> can lead to reduced leaching of nitrate to ground waters [18], low emission of nitrous oxide [19], methane [20], and ammonia [21] originating from fertilizer applied in soil. <b>Fertilizer</b> <b>placement</b> can also improve nutrient content in crop above-ground biomass as well as crop yield in comparison to conventional fertilizer broadcast (meta-analysis with 40 field studies, Nkebiwe et al. 2016, submitted unpublished observation).|$|R

Ruiz Diaz SuarezThe {{effect of}} tillage on crop yield, early growth, and soil {{nutrient}} stratification can {{be influenced by}} <b>fertilizer</b> <b>placement.</b> In addition, deeper root systems can enhance the crop ability to uptake water and nutrients. A thorough understanding of how these factors interact can result in increased grain yields and profitability for the producer. Three studies were completed to describe and evaluate different aspects of crop root system and response to <b>fertilizer</b> <b>placement</b> and tillage. The objective of the first study was to characterize the root system of two genotypes of corn (Zea mays) and soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) using image analysis in the greenhouse and in the field, as well as evaluate dry weight accumulation and nutrient uptake patterns by shoot and root plant parts for both crops. Two different genotypes of each crop were sampled {{during the growing season}} to access root characteristics such as biomass, length, surface area, average diameter and volume. Significant differences were found in corn where the P 1151 AM hybrid had greater root length, surface area and volume than the P 1105 AM hybrid. In soybean, the differences were found in nutrient uptake with overall greater nutrient uptake values for the poor drainage variety (PD) compared to the good drainage variety (GD). The objective of the second study was to evaluate the effect of <b>fertilizer</b> <b>placement</b> and tillage system on corn with different genotypes. Three fertilizer treatments were combined with two different corn genotypes selected based on contrasting root systems and two different tillage systems. The three <b>fertilizer</b> <b>placements</b> were sub-surface band, broadcast, and control. The two hybrids of corn used were a P 1151 AM hybrid and P 1105 AM hybrid. The two tillage systems were no-till (NT) and strip-till (ST). Corn hybrids showed different response in root biomass but did not show a consistent response in other characteristics evaluated. Broadcast and sub-surface band increased nutrient uptake and grain yields over the control but were not significantly different from each other. Tillage showed no difference in corn response. The objective of the third study was to evaluate the effect of <b>fertilizer</b> <b>placement</b> and tillage system on contrasting soybean genotypes.

Studies in Kansas have evaluated different management systems to determine best management practices (BMP). The first component of this dissertation is {{a comprehensive review of}} tillage system and P <b>fertilizer</b> <b>placement</b> interaction. This review included studies completed in the U. S. Midwest. Results of this review showed greater corn yields with conventional tillage and broadcast applications when soil test P levels (STP) were below 20 mg P kg⁻¹. However, soybean yield was highest in no-till systems with broadcast P fertilizer applications. The second component if this dissertation was a long-term study conducted in Kansas to evaluate the effect of P <b>fertilizer</b> <b>placement</b> on corn and soybean production. Results showed that under strip-tillage, P <b>fertilizer</b> <b>placement</b> significantly affected corn growth, but, seldom resulted in yield response difference among placement methods. Phosphorus application as starter fertilizer at planting showed the most consistent yield response. In addition to the agronomic aspect of this study, the third component of this dissertation consisted of an economic analysis using partial budgets calculated using both fixed and varying prices and costs to compare management practices. With decreased application costs associated with deep banding in strip-tillage system, net returns are greater than broadcast applications. The highest net responses were observed with starter P fertilizer applications. The fourth component of this dissertation included a study evaluating the effects of chelated fertilizer on nutrients, such as P, Fe, Mn, and Zn in soybean. Results from our study showed that both ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) +P and hydroxyethyl ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (HEDTA) +P resulted in greater concentrations and uptake of Fe and lower Mn uptake in soybean. However, the application of glucoheptonate (GCH) +P had no negative effect on Mn uptake compared to EDTA+P and HEDTA+P. Across locations, EDTA+P and HEDTA+P showed higher yield than GCH+P. The use of long-term studies and comprehensive reviews can provide a unique perspective and better understanding of the most appropriate BMPs for P fertilizer management.

[ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] Agricultural {{soils are}} {{responsible}} {{for a majority of}} human caused greenhouse gas (GHG) production, such as N₂O and carbon dioxide (CO₂). Nitrous oxide is a potent GHG that stays in the atmosphere for at least 100 years. It is also an ozone-depleting gas. Carbon dioxide is problematic due to its abundance in the atmosphere. These GHGs, along with methane, have {{had a significant impact on}} climate change. Claypan soils are characterized as having a significantly higher clay content deeper in the soil profile compared to the layers directly above it. The goal of this research was to investigate the impact N <b>fertilizer</b> <b>placement</b> has on GHG emissions and corn growth. The specific research objectives were to determine the effects of urea <b>fertilizer</b> <b>placement</b> with and without a nitrification inhibitor (NI) on cumulative soil GHG emissions (N₂O and CO₂) and to assess the effects of urea <b>fertilizer</b> <b>placement</b> with and without a NI on plant N uptake, N use efficiency (NUE), and corn (Zea mays L.) production, on a poorly drained claypan soil in Northeastern Missouri. A NI helps reduce the amount of nitrous oxide produced. Field studies were conducted in 2014 and 2015. Soil greenhouse gas emissions were measured frequently throughout the growing season to determine flux and cumulative N₂O and CO₂ emissions. Soil water content and soil temperature were also assessed at each gas sampling event. Rainfall was higher than the 10 -year average over the growing season for both 2014 and 2015 and possibly resulted in increased environmental N loss. Soil N₂O and CO₂ emissions were higher during the 2015 growing season. The UDB treatment produced the greatest amount of cumulative soil N₂O emissions during both growth seasons at 100 and 354 g N₂O-N ha⁻¹. Deep banded urea without a NI resulted in the highest soil CO₂ production in 2014 and UAA had the greatest cumulative CO₂ emissions in 2015 at approximately 11 and 17 kg CO₂-C ha⁻¹, respectively. Incorporating urea to a depth of 8 cm, deep banding urea, and deep banding urea with a NI all resulted in significantly higher yields of corn by as much as much as 10 %. Deep banding urea with a NI provided as high as a 48 % increase in grain yield compared to other treatments in 2015. The highest yields occurred in 2014 when there were lower N₂O emissions. In 2015, there were higher N₂O emissions and lower yields. This research suggests that urea <b>fertilizer</b> <b>placement</b> has an impact on GHG emissions and corn growth and this information should be provided to farmers who are interested in producing more corn and losing less N. The amount of rainfall during the growing season may also influence soil GHG emissions and corn growth.

In the field experiment, we applied fertilizer both homogeneously and heterogeneously under monocropping and intercropping conditions. The heterogeneous nutrient treatment in intercropping was designed with different <b>fertilizer</b> <b>placements,</b> at intraspecific and interspecific rows, respectively. In the pot experiment, crops were grown under both homogeneous and heterogeneous nitrogen conditions with single plant, intraspecific and interspecific competition. Shoot and root biomass and yield were measured to analyse crop performance. Results In the field experiment, the heterogeneous nitrogen, compared with the homogenous one, enhanced {{the performance of the}} intercropped crop. Importantly, this effect of heterogeneous nitrogen was greater when fertilizer was applied at interspecific rows, rather than at intraspecific rows. Moreover, in pot experiments, the root foraging precision of the two crops was increased by interspecific neighbours, but only that of potatoes was increased by intraspecific neighbours. Conclusions The integrated responses of plants to heterogeneous neighbours and nutrients depend on the position of nutrient-rich patches, which deepen our understanding of the function of plant diversity, and show that <b>fertilizer</b> <b>placement</b> within multi-cropping systems merits more attention. Moreover, the enhanced utilization of heterogeneous nitrogen could drive overyielding in multi-cropping systems...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{initiated}} in 1994 to study phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) <b>fertilizer</b> <b>placement</b> for {{corn and soybeans}} managed with no-till and chisel-plow tillage. No-till management involves less incorporation of residues and fertilizers with soil than other systems. Broadcast fertilization could result in low fertilizer use efficiency in no-tilled soils because P and K accumulate {{at or near the}} soil surface. Banding fertilizers with the planter could be an effective practice but planter attachments apply low rates of fertilizer to shallow bands. Deeper and larger fertilizer applications may be needed. This study is being replicated at four other research farms to obtain data from various soils and climatic conditions...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Contamination of {{groundwater}} {{is a great}} concern in many irrigated areas of the world. In irrigated areas of world, about 90 % of land is irrigated with furrow irrigation method. It {{is said to be}} water use efficient method than the conventional methods but is said to be capable of leaching large quantities of nitrogen to the groundwater. It is said that about 40 % of the nitrogen applied percolate below the vadose zone of a clay loam soil which can even more leach from sandy soils. HYDRUS- 2 D model was used to analyse different <b>fertilizer</b> <b>placement</b> strategies in the furrow in order to reduce nitrogen leaching from a furrows prepared in different soil textures. Strategies of soil management included controlled or normal (Sn), compacting furrow bottom (Sc) and covering bottom of furrow with plastic sheet (Sp). Soils used for analysis consisted, sandy loam, loam and clay. Considered <b>placements</b> of <b>fertilizer</b> included fertilizer at the sides and bottom of furrow (P 1) near ridge the ridge top (P 2). Results of simulations obtained with HYDRUS showed that for the considered soil textures 25 % to 60 % water can be saved Sc, which can further be enhanced from 50 % to 95 % using Sp. Simulated results revealed that 15 % to 99 % nitrogen leaching can be reduced by using <b>fertilizer</b> <b>placement</b> P 2. About 10 % to 98 % reduction in nitrogen leaching can be achieved if we adopt soil management strategies reported in this study.
