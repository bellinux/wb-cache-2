40|$|This essay {{concerns}} the hill <b>forts</b> <b>in</b> Halland. The hill <b>forts</b> <b>in</b> Halland haven’t been archaeologically examined and they haven’t been studied {{as well as}} hill <b>forts</b> <b>in</b> other parts of Sweden. The focus of this essay {{is to determine the}} use of the hill <b>forts</b> <b>in</b> Halland.   Comparative studies will be made between Halland’s hill forts and the hill forts of Bohuslän and the hill forts of the Eastern part of Sweden. The results of the research have yielded that the hill <b>forts</b> <b>in</b> Halland strongly reminiscent of the hill <b>forts</b> <b>in</b> Bohuslän {{when it comes to the}} positioning in the landscape, as well as the general appearance of the hill forts. There are remains of houses in some of the hill <b>forts</b> <b>in</b> Bohuslän. Because of the similarities with the hill <b>forts</b> <b>in</b> Bohuslän, there is a possibility that there have been houses on top of the hill <b>forts</b> <b>in</b> Halland. It is not possible to say whether the hill <b>forts</b> <b>in</b> Halland have been places of “safe haven” and/or permanent residents. Most of the hill <b>forts</b> <b>in</b> Halland have great view over seas or the ocean, as well as over the inland. They tend to be located close to old roads and would have had a great overview of them. It’s possible that the hill forts were connected to trading posts. Signaling between the hill <b>forts</b> <b>in</b> the northern part of Halland is possible because of the closeness of them. Drawings of the hill forts have been made successfully; they show roughly where the walls of the hill fort are situated and where the precipices and inclinations are situated. The drawings make it easier to compare the hill <b>forts</b> <b>in</b> Halland to hill <b>forts</b> <b>in</b> other parts of Sweden...|$|R
