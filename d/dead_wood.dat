5|$|Peniophora quercina {{typically}} grows upon <b>dead</b> <b>wood,</b> {{which can}} {{be attached to the}} tree or fallen, where it causes white rot. It favours oak, but can also be found on other deciduous trees, such as beech. P.quercina is known to be a pioneer species on <b>dead</b> <b>wood,</b> which means it can be the first species to grow. It is found in Europe, where it is very common. Though it can be encountered all year, it produces spores in late summer and autumn. It has also been recorded in Amur, in eastern Asia.|$|E
5|$|Indriids {{such as the}} sifakas {{use their}} toothcombs to gouge bark or <b>dead</b> <b>wood</b> (bark-prising), which is done prior to scent-marking with the gland on their chest. The more robust {{structure}} of their toothcomb is thought to help it withstand the compressive forces experienced during regular bark-prising.|$|E
5|$|This species {{lives on}} hard benthic substrates, {{typically}} rocks. It lives on pebbles, sometimes on boulders, and rarely on <b>dead</b> <b>wood.</b> It tolerates mild organic pollution, low oxygen content (down to below 2mg/liter) {{but it does}} not tolerate long periods of droughts, or ice. It lives in mesotrophic waters, and sometimes in oligotrophic waters.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to study the relationship between presence of termite and environmental variables in primary forest and adjacent oil palm plantation located in Sabah province, Malaysia. Termite sampling was conducted with manually dug and sorted soil pits (25 cm × 25 cm × 10 cm) at a minimum extent of 64 m and lag of 2 m. Logistic regression technique was used to analyze the collected data. In general, termite species richness and relative abundances are lower in oil palm plantation in comparison with primary forest. The result showed that probability of termite occurrences in primary forest are mainly related to <b>dead</b> <b>woods,</b> trees and non-predatory ants. Likewise, probability of termite occurrences in oil palm plantation was affected with the appearance of <b>dead</b> <b>woods,</b> pruned stacked fronds, non- predatory ants and earthworms. This result indicated that pruned stacked fronds and <b>dead</b> <b>woods</b> play an important role of recovery of termite assemblages in oil palm plantation...|$|R

5|$|Although data on Russulaceae {{themselves}} are scarce, more {{is known about}} the habitats they occur in, especially for the ectomycorrhizal species which depend on their host plants: Several of these habitats are affected by loss or degradation, such as peatlands, Mediterranean forests and scrub or tropical African dry woodland. Similarly, <b>dead</b> <b>wood,</b> the habitat of the corticioid Russulaceae, is rare in many exploited forests and needs special management.|$|E
5|$|Amylostereum is {{the single}} genus in the fungal family Amylostereaceae. The genus {{currently}} comprises four saprotrophic and parasitic species, which live off living or <b>dead</b> <b>wood.</b> The Amylostereaceae cause white rot in the wood by disintegrating the tissue component lignin. They produce crust-like, partially wavy fruit bodies {{on the surface of}} infested trees, which are similar to those produced by Stereum species.|$|E
5|$|Gymnopils maritimus {{is clearly}} a {{different}} species from other members of its clade, despite their close relation. All other species in the clade grow upon <b>dead</b> <b>wood</b> and have well-developed rings on their stems. The spores also differ; {{in the case of}} G.junonius and G.spectabilis (often considered synonymous), as well as G.pampeanus, they are narrower, {{and in the case of}} G.imperialis, they are wider. Of the other members of the clade, only G.junonius and G.spectabilis also grow in Europe.|$|E

5|$|Theodoxus fluviatilis serves an {{indicator}} species for river monitoring (in Germany); however the spreading populations {{also have a}} high tolerance for degraded habitats. Theodoxus fluviatilis has a large phenotypic plasticity: it was found living on stones and on <b>dead</b> <b>wood</b> in freshwater environments; whereas it lives on stones and on Fucus vesiculosus, Potamogeton spp. and Zostera marina in brackish water in the Baltic Sea. The species {{can also be found}} on aggregates of Mytilus.|$|E
5|$|Armillaria is a genus of fungi {{commonly}} known as honey mushrooms. First treated by Elias Magnus Fries in 1821, and later assigned generic rank by Friedrich Staude in 1857, Armillaria is classified in the Physalacriaceae family of the Agaricales, the gilled mushrooms. The majority of species in Armillaria are saprotrophic and live mainly on <b>dead</b> <b>wood,</b> but some are parasites that can cause root and butt rot in over 600 species of woody plants. Some Armillaria species form mycorrhizae with orchids; others, such as A.gallica, A.mellea, and A.tabescens, are bioluminescent.|$|E
5|$|Breeding densities {{have been}} {{recorded}} as between 0.1–6.6pairs/10ha (0.04–2.7pairs/10acres), with the greatest densities in mature forest growing on alluvium. Numbers have increased in Europe due to the planting of forests, which provides breeding habitat, and more available <b>dead</b> <b>wood,</b> and this species has profited from its flexibility with regard to types of woodland {{and its ability to}} thrive in proximity to humans. Harsh winters are a problem, and fragmentation of woodland can cause local difficulties. The Canary Islands populations of D. m. canariensis on Tenerife and D. m. thanneri on Gran Canaria face a potential threat from exploitation of the local pine forests.|$|E

40|$|The {{influence}} of industrial pollution on mortality values (<b>dead</b> fallen <b>wood</b> and <b>dead</b> standing trees) and its distribution by degrees of decomposition were investigated in spruce-fir forest {{stands in the}} vicinity of the Middle Ural copper smelter (the city of Revda, Sverdlovsk region). The total mortality and mortality in each size category did not depend on the distance to the source of pollution. At the same time, the amount of <b>dead</b> fallen <b>wood</b> was significantly greater (1. 9 times) in the polluted area (2 and 4 km from the smelter) as compared with the background territory (30 km from the smelter). Mortality proportion out of the total number of the trees (both live and dead) did not differ significantly between the sites, although this parameter tended to increase nearer the smelter. The distribution of mortality by size categories revealed significant differences between background territory and site with average level of contamination, as well as background territory and highly contaminated site. Observed differences are associated with an increased proportion of lesser mortality near the smelter (by 15 % and 12 % as compared with areas of background and middle levels of contamination, respectively), as well as because of double-declining of medium- and large-sized mortality near the smelter. The distribution of the living tree stands by size categories also has a connection with level of contamination. The average diameters of the living tree stand and the elements of coarse woody debris (<b>dead</b> fallen <b>wood</b> and <b>dead</b> standing trees) do not differ significantly between sites with different levels of contamination. For the small-sized <b>dead</b> fallen <b>wood,</b> the proportion of weakly decomposed stems increased with the level of pollution, while proportion of strongly decomposed stems decreased. The distribution of medium- and large-sized <b>dead</b> fallen <b>wood</b> on the stages of decomposition does not vary between sites with different levels of pollution...|$|R

5|$|E.J.H. Corner {{defined the}} {{varieties}} M.inclinata var. kinabaluensis and var. subglobospora in his 1994 publication on Agaric mushrooms of Malesia, a biogeographical region straddling {{the boundary of}} the Indomalaya and Australasia ecozones. The variety kinabaluensis (named after its type locality, Kinabalu) has a cap margin that is not scalloped, little or no odor, and cheilocystidia with shorter processes. It was found growing on the <b>dead</b> <b>wood</b> of Lithocarpus havilandii, a stone oak tree in the beech family. Variety subglobospora, found in Sabah, has spores that are almost spherical.|$|E
5|$|Like many ink caps, {{it grows}} in tufts. It is {{commonly}} associated with buried wood and is found in grassland, meadows, disturbed ground, and open terrain from late spring to autumn. Fruiting bodies {{have been known to}} push their way up through asphalt and even tennis courts. It is also common in urban areas and appears in vacant lots, and tufts of fungi can be quite large and fruit several times a year. If dug up, the mycelium can often be found originating on buried <b>dead</b> <b>wood.</b>|$|E
5|$|Lycoperdon echinatum can {{be found}} either solitary or in small groups. It {{typically}} grows {{on the ground in}} deciduous forests and grassy areas, glades and pastures, on moss, humus, or woody debris. The fungus has been noted to have a preference for beech woods. Fruit bodies may make their appearance anytime from the late spring to autumn. Older specimens {{are more likely to be}} overlooked, as their brown color blends into the surrounding environment of dead leaves and <b>dead</b> <b>wood.</b> The puffball is used by various species of scuttle flies (family Phoridae) as larval food.|$|E

5|$|Mycena arcangeliana (commonly {{known as}} the angel's bonnet or the late-season bonnet) is a species of Mycenaceae fungus. It has been known {{by a number of}} {{scientific}} names, and its taxonomy is still somewhat disputed. It produces small mushrooms with caps varying in colour from whitish to a darker grey-brown, and stems of an olive-greyish that fade with age. The mushrooms can be mistaken for the similar Mycena flavescens. They have a mild taste, but a strong smell of iodoform; they are not edible. The species grows on <b>dead</b> <b>wood</b> in autumn months, and can be found throughout Europe.|$|E
5|$|The {{species has}} also been {{identified}} in living sapwood, though it is latent at this time, and {{it is probable that}} it waits until the wood begins to die (when it is drier, but contains more oxygen) before the mycelia begin to grow. When the species was inoculated into living wood, it did grow, but only around the inoculation wound; the species did not spread as it would have done on <b>dead</b> <b>wood.</b> Another study found that the species actively colonised partially living branches, causing white rot. However, the species had little effect on the cambium, and was mostly limited to the ends of branches.|$|E
5|$|Thrips are {{believed}} to have descended from a fungus-feeding ancestor during the Mesozoic, and many groups still feed upon and inadvertently redistribute fungal spores. These live among leaf litter or on <b>dead</b> <b>wood</b> and are important members of the ecosystem, their diet often being supplemented with pollen. Other species are primitively eusocial and form plant galls and still others are predatory on mites and other thrips. Two species of Aulacothrips, A. tenuis and A. levinotus, {{have been found to be}} ectoparasites on aetalionid and membracid plant-hoppers in Brazil.|$|E

5|$|Hapalopilus nidulans (also {{known as}} Hapalopilus rutilans) is {{a species of}} polypore fungus in the family Polyporaceae. Officially {{described}} in 1821, it was transferred to its current genus Hapalopilus six decades later. It {{is commonly known as}} the tender nesting polypore, purple dye polypore, or the cinnamon bracket. This widely distributed species is found on five continents. It grows on the fallen or standing <b>dead</b> <b>wood</b> of deciduous trees, in which it fruits singly, in groups, fused, or in overlapping clusters. Fruit bodies are in the form of kidney-shaped to semicircular, cinnamon-orange-brown brackets. The underside of the fruit body features a yellowish to brownish pore surface with tiny angular pores, from which spores are released.|$|E
5|$|Like all Phallaceae species, C.columnatus is saprobic, {{and uses}} {{extracellular}} digestion to acquire nutrients from dead and decaying organic matter, like wood. As {{a consequence of}} its predilection for <b>dead</b> <b>wood,</b> the fungus {{is often associated with}} disturbed habitats. It can often be found growing in and around gardens and residences where areas of cultivation or landscaping have resulted in accumulations of mulch, wood chips or other cellulose-rich materials. The mycelial cords can be traced to buried roots, stumps, and other woody material. The species grows in sandy soil, near woody debris, in lawns, gardens, and cultivated soil. Fruit bodies appear singly, or scattered, and can arise in the summer, autumn, and early winter, especially after wet weather.|$|E
5|$|Marasmius rotula is a {{saprobic}} {{species and}} as such obtains nutrients by decomposing dead organic matter. It grows in deciduous forests and fruits in groups or clusters on <b>dead</b> <b>wood</b> (especially beech), woody debris such as twigs or sticks, and occasionally on rotting leaves. The fruit bodies, which are easily overlooked because of their diminutive size, are often present in abundance after rains. The species is relatively intolerant of low water potentials, and will grow poorly {{or not at all}} under water stress conditions. It is unable to degrade leaf litter until it becomes more fragmented and more compacted so that the water-holding capacity increases in the deeper layers of the soil. The magnolia warbler has been noted to line its nests with the fruit bodies' stems.|$|E
5|$|Ascocoryne sarcoides is {{a species}} of fungus in the family Helotiaceae. The species name {{is derived from the}} Greek sarkodes (fleshy). Formerly known as Coryne sarcoides, its taxonomical history has been {{complicated}} by the fact that it may adopt both sexual and asexual forms. Colloquially known as jelly drops or the purple jellydisc, this common fungus appears as a gelatinous mass of pinkish or purple-colored discs. Distributed widely in North America, Europe and Asia, A.sarcoides is a saprobic fungus and grows in clusters on the trunks and branches of a variety of <b>dead</b> <b>woods.</b> Field studies suggest that colonization by A.sarcoides of the heartwood of black spruce confers some resistance to further infection by rot-causing fungi. A.sarcoides contains the antibiotic compound ascocorynin, shown in the laboratory to inhibit the growth of several Gram-positive bacteria.|$|R
40|$|It is {{a certain}} fact for the forest {{ecosystem}} that {{the death of a}} tree gives way to other lives. Survival of many insects, birds, fungi, lichens, Liverworts and Mosses within life circle depend partly or mainly on those dead trees. That is why dead trees are also named as ‘Biotope Tree’, ‘a living space with high biological diversity’ or ‘a hotspot’; the center for biological diversity in forest. Research area has been assigned as ‘Research Forest’ to Çankırı Faculty of Forestry of Ankara University by the decision of Council of Ministers. However, research studies that have been carried out so far in the area are insufficient. It is aimed to get more information from the area by this study and similar ones.
