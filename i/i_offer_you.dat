500|$|Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times {{gave the}} film 2 out of 4 stars, saying that [...] "After scrutinizing the film, <b>I</b> <b>offer</b> <b>you</b> my {{summary of the}} story: Guy dies, finds himself resurrected, meets others, fights. That lasts for almost two hours." [...] Michael Rechtshaffen of The Hollywood Reporter wrote that the film isn't the same without Arnold Schwarzenegger and that it misses its {{dramatic}} element. Likewise, Claudia Puig of USA Today gave the film a 2/4 and called it [...] "predictable" [...] with the [...] "dramatic elements flat-lin". She considered Christian Bale's performance [...] "one-dimensional", but found his co-stars to [...] "come off better", saying Sam Worthington had [...] "a quiet intensity marred only by yelling [...] "Nooooo!" [...] three times in about 10 minutes" [...] and that Anton Yelchin had [...] "some of the best lines".|$|E

In a January 2015 interview with The Times of India, playwright Y. G. Mahendra said, [...] "most character artists today lack variety [...] Show me one actor in India currently who can do a Kattabomman, a VOC, a Vietnam Veedu, a Galatta Kalyanam and a Thiruvilayadal."

2500|$|Aleister Crowley {{had great}} admiration {{for the use of}} the ouija board and it played a passing role in his magical workings. Jane Wolfe, who lived with Crowley at Abbey of Thelema, also used the Ouija board. She credits some of her {{greatest}} spiritual communications to use of this implement. Crowley also discussed the Ouija board with another of his students, and the most ardent of them, Frater Achad (Charles Stansfeld Jones): it is frequently mentioned in their unpublished letters. In 1917 Achad experimented with the board as a means of summoning Angels, as opposed to Elementals. In one letter Crowley told Jones: [...] "Your Ouija board experiment is rather fun. You see how very satisfactory it is, but I believe things improve greatly with practice. I think you should keep to one angel, and make the magical preparations more elaborate." [...] Over the years, both became so fascinated by the board that they discussed marketing their own design. Their discourse culminated in a letter, dated February 21, 1919, in which Crowley tells Jones, [...] "Re: Ouija Board. <b>I</b> <b>offer</b> <b>you</b> the basis of ten percent of my net profit. You are, if you accept this, responsible for the legal protection of the ideas, and the marketing of the copyright designs. I trust that this may be satisfactory to you. I hope to let you have the material in the course of a week." [...] In March, Crowley wrote to Achad to inform him,"I'll think up another name for Ouija." [...] But their business venture never came to fruition and Crowley's new design, along with his name for the board, has not survived. Crowley has stated, of the Ouija Board that, ...|$|E
