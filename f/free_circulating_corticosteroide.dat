40|$|The <b>circulating</b> <b>free</b> DNA ("Cell-free DNA",cfDNA) {{is a type}} of {{extracellular}} DNA {{present in}} blood, with clinical use in prenatal diagnosis. The cfDNA is given great emphasis in connection with tumor diseases, where there is a great potential for its use in oncology, where <b>free</b> <b>circulating</b> tumor DNA is the most commonly used type. A suitable alternative to classical biopsy, which is safer and less painful for the patient and reflects the heterogeneity of the tumor is called Liquid biopsy, which can be used to obtain <b>free</b> <b>circulating</b> DNA from the blood. Most studies show that cfDNA provides the same information as tissue DNA, regarding both genetic and epigenetic changes detected in tumor cells and in some cases it enabled more sensitive or earlier detection of relapse in comparison with routinely used examinations. The high specificity and sensitivity of this non-invasive approach can be a great benefit to patients. However, to confirm its diagnostic and prognostic significance, it is necessary to expand the group of patients with individual diagnoses and, not only for the purpose of data comparison, standardize methods for the isolation and detection of cfDNA, The aim of this thesis is to gain a general overview of <b>free</b> <b>circulating</b> DNA and its potential use in oncology.

30|$|Introduction Mitochondria are {{evolutionary}} endosymbionts {{that are}} derived from ancestral aerobic bacteria and so might bear and release bacterial molecular motifs supporting the role of mitochondria in danger signal regulations. <b>Free</b> <b>circulating</b> mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is elevated in a wild range of critical illness observed in intensive care units, and is associated with bad outcomes and mortality. The mtDNA is a molecular pattern that belongs to mitochondrial damage associated molecular patterns (mtDAMPs), and can interact with pattern recognition receptors (PRR) to induce self defense reaction. Free mtDNA activates inflammatory signaling pathways through Toll-like endosomal receptor 9 (TLR 9) interactions. Nevertheless, new evidence advocates a role of the receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE) in mtDNA signaling. Experimental data suggest a role of mtDNA-PRR interaction in systemic inflammation and organ dysfunctions as septic acute kidney injury or pulmonary inflammation. Impact of <b>free</b> <b>circulating</b> mtDNA on endothelial cell is not known.|$|R

40|$|International audienceCancer is {{characterized}} by multiple somatic genetic and epigenetic alterations that could be useful as molecular markers for detecting tumor DNA in different bodily fluids. In patients with various diseases {{as well as in}} healthy subjects, circulating plasma and serum carry small amounts of non-cell-bound DNA. In this <b>free</b> <b>circulating</b> DNA, tumor-associated molecular alterations can be detected in patients who have cancer. In many instances, the alterations identified are the same as those found in the primary tumor tissue, thereby suggesting tumor origin from a fraction of the <b>circulating</b> <b>free</b> DNA. In fact, various types of DNA alterations described in colorectal cancer have been detected in the <b>circulating</b> <b>free</b> DNA of patients with colorectal cancer. These alterations include KRAS 2, APC and TP 53 mutations, DNA hypermethylation, microsatellite instability (MSI) and loss of heterozygosity (LOH). Also, advances in polymerase chain reaction (PCR) -based technology now allow the detection and quantification of extremely small amounts of tumor-derived <b>circulating</b> <b>free</b> DNA in colorectal cancer patients. The present report summarizes the literature available so far on the mechanisms of <b>circulating</b> <b>free</b> DNA, and on the studies aimed at assessing the clinical and biological significance of tumor-derived <b>circulating</b> <b>free</b> DNA in colorectal cancer patients. Thus, tumor-derived <b>circulating</b> <b>free</b> DNA could serve as a marker for the diagnosis, prognosis and early detection of recurrence, thereby significantly improving the monitoring of colorectal cancer patients.

40|$|Background: Non-invasive early {{detection}} of lung cancer could {{reduce the number of}} patients diagnosed with advanced disease, which is associated with a poor prognosis. We analyzed the diagnostic accuracy of a panel of peripheral blood markers in detecting non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Methods: 100 healthy donors and 100 patients with NSCLC were enrolled onto this study. <b>Free</b> <b>circulating</b> DNA, circulating mRNA expression of peptidylarginine deiminase type 4 (PAD 4 /PADI 4), pro-platelet basic protein (PPBP) and haptoglobin were evaluated using a Real-Time PCR-based method. Results: <b>Free</b> <b>circulating</b> DNA, PADI 4, PPBP and haptoglobin levels were significantly higher in NSCLC patients than in healthy donors (p, 0. 0001, p, 0. 0001, p = 0. 0002 and p = 0. 0001, respectively). The fitted logistic regression model demonstrated a significant direct association between marker expression and lung cancer risk. The odds ratios of individual markers were 6. 93 (95 % CI 4. 15 – 11. 58; p, 0. 0001) for free DNA, 6. 99 (95 % CI 3. 75 – 13. 03; p, 0. 0001) for PADI 4, 2. 85 (95 % CI 1. 71 – 4. 75; p, 0. 0001) for PPBP and 1. 16 (95 % CI 1. 01 – 1. 33; p = 0. 031) for haptoglobin. Free DNA in combination with PPBP and PADI 4 gave an area under the ROC curve of 0. 93, 95 % CI = 0. 90 – 0. 97, with sensitivity and specificity over 90 %. Conclusions: <b>Free</b> <b>circulating</b> DNA analysis combined with PPBP and PADI 4 expression determination appears to accurately discriminate between healthy donors and NSCLC patients.

40|$|The {{induction}} {{of resistance}} mechanisms represents an important {{problem for the}} targeted therapy of patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The best-known resistance mechanism induced during treatment with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) -tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) is EGFR T 790 M mutation for which specific drugs are have been developed. However, other molecular alterations have also been reported as induced resistance mechanisms to EGFR-TKIs. Similarly, there is growing evidence of acquired resistance mechanisms to anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) -TKI treatment. A better understanding of these acquired resistance mechanisms is essential in clinical practice as patients could be treated with specific drugs that are active against the induced alterations. The use of <b>free</b> <b>circulating</b> tumor nucleic acids or circulating tumor cells (CTCs) enables resistance mechanisms to be characterized in a non-invasive manner and reduces the need for tumor re-biopsy. This review discusses the main resistance mechanisms to TKIs and provides a comprehensive overview of innovative strategies to evaluate known resistance mechanisms in <b>free</b> <b>circulating</b> nucleic acids or CTCs and potential future orientations for these non-invasive approaches...|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Patients {{with long}} {{standing}} ulcerative colitis (UC) {{have a high}} risk {{for the development of}} colorectal cancer. In order to detect dysplastic or malignant alterations as early as possible, these patients are frequently observed by colonoscopic examination. It is known that the development of a colorectal tumor is asscociated with a number of genetic alterations, belonging to different molecular pathways. For the detection of such alterations we used microsatellites, which are short interspersed, highly repetitive and polymorphic sequences, mostly located in non-coding sequences. AIMS & METHODS: The aim of this study was i) to establish a panel of genetic alterations which might be useful markers for diagnostic purposes, staging, or follow up, and ii) to examine whether these alterations are also detectable in <b>free</b> <b>circulating</b> nucleic acid and DNA derived from stool. We used a set of 11 microsatellites located on different chromosomes for the detection of alterations in <b>free</b> <b>circulating</b> serum DNA and stool DNA in comparison to DNA from white blood cells (WBC) from 59 patients with UC. PCR primers were radiolabeled using T 4 kinase, the PCR products from amplified serum and WBC DNA were separated by running through a denaturing polyacrylamide gel and analyzed by autoradiography. Furthermore, we collected clinical and paraclinical data (time and severity of the disease, and parameters of inflammation). RESULTS: Seven out of 59 patients showed one or more microsatellite alteration/s in their serum DNA. Four of them had an alteration in more than one marker. From 27 out of our 59 patients we could isolate DNA from stool. In 9 patients we found microsatellite alterations; 4 showed alterations in more than one marker. We could not find any correlation between alterations in serum or stool DNA nor to the clinical and paraclinical data. CONCLUSION: With the panel of 11 microsatellite markers used for these studies we could find microsatellite alterations in <b>free</b> <b>circulating</b> acid from serum DNA and in stool DNA. If these detections {{has anything to do with}} a higher risk for development of UC-associated cancer is still unclear...|$|R

40|$|Background. Vascular endothelial {{growth factor}} (VEGF) is a {{powerful}} enhancer of vascular permeability and inflammatory response; however its significance in chronic urticaria is poorly recognised. Aim. To compare <b>free</b> <b>circulating</b> levels of VEGF and its soluble receptors (sVEGFR 1 and VEGFR 2) in patients with different forms of chronic urticaria. Methods. The concentrations of VEGF and its receptors in plateletpoor plasma (PPP) /plasma were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in chronic urticaria: (1) chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) with positive autologous serum skin test (ASST), (2) CSU with negative response to ASST, (3) CSU with concomitant euthyroid Hashimoto’s thyroiditis (CSU/Hashimoto), (4) delayed pressure urticaria (DPU), and the healthy subjects. Results. There {{were no significant differences}} in VEGF concentration in PPP between CSU groups and the healthy subjects. Contrary, VEGF concentration was significantly higher in DPU and CSU/Hashimoto patients as compared with the healthy subjects and CSU groups. Furthermore, VEGF value in CSU/Hashimoto patients during the remission was similar to that of the active period and significantly higher than the healthy subjects; VEGF concentration was significantly correlated with TSH. Plasma concentrations of sVEGF 1 and sVEGF 2 were similar in chronic urticaria patients and the healthy subjects. Conclusions.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to determine the}} effect of prior sensitization on the removal of antigen and the development of allergic lesions in animals receiving a single large intravenous injection of foreign protein. When a purified protein such as crystallized bovine albumin is injected intravenously into normal rabbits, it is cleared from the blood in a predictable fashion, requiring approximately 2 weeks (1 - 3). Thereafter, for several days, <b>free</b> <b>circulating</b> antibody is demonstrable in increasing titer (3). The blood clearance of antigen occurs in three phases: an early phase of rapid equilibration of antigen between the intravascular and extravascular compartments; a second phase of slow catabolism of antigen; and a final or "immune " phase of rapid antigen elimination by antibody. Since during the "immune " phase of antigen clearance the newly formed antibody is present with excess antigen, <b>free</b> <b>circulating</b> antibody is not demonstrable during this phase. However, the effects of antibody production can be accurately measured by the increased rate at which the antigen is eliminated (4).

In this study, <b>free</b> <b>circulating</b> mtDNA was quantified in plasma samples from 37 suicide attempters, who had undergone a dexamethasone suppression test (DST), and 37 healthy controls. We hypothesized that <b>free</b> <b>circulating</b> mtDNA would be elevated in the suicide attempters and would be associated with hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) -axis hyperactivity. Suicide attempters had significantly higher plasma levels of free-circulating mtDNA compared with healthy controls at different time points (pre- and post-DST; all P-values< 2. 98 E- 12, Cohen's d ranging from 2. 55 to 4. 01). Pre-DST plasma levels of mtDNA were positively correlated with post-DST cortisol levels (rho= 0. 49, P< 0. 003). Suicide attempters may have elevated plasma levels of free-circulating mtDNA, which are related to impaired HPA-axis negative feedback. This peripheral index is consistent with an increased cellular or mitochondrial damage.
