5000|$|In March 1906, the Utah <b>Fire</b> <b>Proofing</b> Company {{began work}} on the Boise River Diversion Dam with the {{provision}} that the structure would be completed within one year. It soon became apparent that the dam would not be finished on time. With little experience in such endeavors, Utah <b>Fire</b> <b>Proofing</b> failed to provide adequate foremen for the project. At least nineteen superintendents worked on the dam and their incompetence led to an extraordinary turnover in labor. Inclement weather and flooding caused at least two months' worth of delays and forced the crews to rebuild part of the structure. By April 16, 1907, the dam was only 41% complete. It would take another year and a half before the diversion works were ready to unload into the New York Canal. The company eventually lost $90,000 on the contract. And to make matters worse in March 1909, a log foreman [...] "maliciously" [...] removed the boom above the dam and allowed timber roll over the embankment causing $73,000 worth of damage. Yet when the structure was completed it worked famously. The Diversion Dam is 68 ft high and 500 ft in length with an overall capacity of [...]|$|E
5000|$|During the {{original}} construction, {{large amounts of}} asbestos were used to ensure the structural integrity of the buildings' steel frames {{in the event of}} a fire. Despite contemporary concerns over the suitability of the nature of the <b>fire</b> <b>proofing</b> solution used in the buildings, Bunton vehemently defended it, stating in an article to the International Asbestos Cement Review in 1966; [...] "steel and asbestos in partnership with social others operate as the collective that stabilises Red Road and holds it together, albeit provisionally, as a viable, safe housing solution".|$|E
50|$|Using these {{metal frames}} for taller buildings, however, meant exposing {{them to the}} {{potentially}} devastating effects of wind pressure. As a consequence, protective wind bracing had to be introduced, enabled {{by the work of}} Augustin-Jean Fresnel who produced equations for calculating the loads and moments on larger buildings. Metal-framed buildings were also particularly vulnerable to fire and required special fireproofing. French engineers had made advances in this area in the early 19th century, but major breakthroughs only came with the work of architect Peter Wight in the 1860s. Spurred on by the catastrophic fires in Chicago in 1871 and Boston in 1872, his findings were turned into a wide variety of patented <b>fire</b> <b>proofing</b> products during the 1870s.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the normal engineering tools several items of test equipment was made or procured.

Furthermore, the Main stand was starting to develop rust in its supports that gave the club the dilemma of whether to pay the high maintenance costs of keeping Huish alive, or whether to sell up and move to another site. Gradual safety restrictions had pulled the official ground capacity down to around 10,000 in its later years. With the last capacity attendance came in January 1988, when Queens Park Rangers visited for an FA Cup third round match, and 9,717 spectators watched a 0-3 defeat against the First Division side.|$|E
