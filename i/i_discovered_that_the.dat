At first we had been giving out relief at such a rate that I had to tell the chairman that he was providing the smelter men with more than they had had while at work. Then he cut down the rations until the wives of the smelter men began to complain {{that they were not}} getting enough to eat. Years later, when his letters were published in The Pinkerton Labor Spy, <b>I</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> chairman of the relief committe (sic) was a Pinkerton detective, who was carrying out the instructions of the agency...|$|E

Banks said, [...] "If I'd stayed on, I probably would have gone down the acting route instead of writing.

Hume is depicted in a [...] philosopher's toga, representing the timelessness of philosophical thought, a decision which was criticised as atavistic after the unveiling in 1996, though Stoddart remained stoic, [...] "So here <b>I</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> right thing, done in public, will often earn one great disapproval: a lesson for life – in the modern age at least." [...] Local philosophy students soon began a tradition of rubbing the statue's toe to absorb some of his knowledge. Though Stoddart placed the foot {{over the edge of}} the plinth to encourage such engagement, the irony of the practice given Hume's critiques of superstition has been remarked upon.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, I study various {{characteristics}} of five countries’ bubbles, {{including those in}} Australia, Denmark, Ireland, the United Kingdom, and the United States, {{in order to better}} understand how these bubbles began and how they subsequently developed. I conclude that these bubble markets are often characterized by a rising home ownership rate, rapidly increasing housing starts, and quickly declining affordability. In addition, <b>I</b> <b>discover</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> size of a U. S. city’s bubble can largely be explained by its median multiple, percentage of renters, and coastal location...|$|R
2500|$|As {{recounted in}} his 1952 memoir Witness, Whittaker Chambers {{came to know}} Lore because they both {{reported}} to rezident Markin: [...] He described him as follows: [...] Lore was an old Bolshevik. He had been a Socialist before the Russian Revolution. In those pre-revolutionary days, {{he had been the}} friend of Trotsky, then a New York Socialist journalist. After the Revolution, Lore had managed an American speaking trip for Alexandra Kollontai, the author of Red Love, later the Soviet ambassador to Sweden. [...] Bukharin, in his New York days, had eaten and slept in the apartment on 55th Street in Brooklyn, where Lore, his outspokenly anti-Communist wife and three wholly American sons still lived. [...] He describes the Lore family with some detail: [...] I was introduced to Lillian Lore, Ludwig's remarkable wife, who in large part provided those meals, and, by some economic miracle, had kept that amazing household together during the long, lean years, had fed the endless procession of guests. [...] "Die unvergessliche Lores-the unforgettable Lores," [...] a German friend had called them... I have seldom seen a happy family life so explicit in the characters of all who shared it... I soon came to regard the Lores' house as a kind of second home. [...] For Ludwig I developed an almost filial feeling as of a younger for an older revolutionist. [...] The kindness of all the Lores to me was personal, and in spite of politics, for all {{the other members of the}} family, except Ludwig, were outspoken in their detestation of the Communist Party. [...] Chambers also describes a defector's fear of retribution from the Soviet Underground, which Lore and he shared: [...] I did not know that at the very time I was visiting him most frequently, Lore was under surveillance. [...] He was being watched, not by the American authorities, but by the Russian secret police... I discovered that he was afraid to walk alone with me on the street at night and that he was terrified to get into an automobile alone with me. Then I knew that there was something seriously amiss. But I had been out of the Communist Party six or seven years, and Lore was dead, before <b>I</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> old Bolshevik, in whom, as a younger man, I respected the older revolutionist, had denounced me (around 1941) to the F.B.I. I learned it not from the FBI, but from another security agency of the Government. [...] I respected Lore all the more for that act. My feeling for him and for all the Lores remained unchanged.|$|E

40|$|In this {{bachelor}} thesis I concern {{myself with}} {{the relationship between the}} height of social benefits and the rate of property crime.

Subsequently I examine this effect by regression analysis with data from 14 districts of the Czech Republic from the years 2005 to 2010. <b>I</b> <b>discover</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> height of social benefits did influence the number of burglary in a positive way - <b>that</b> is, <b>the</b> higher the social benefits, the higher criminality rate there was. I did not prove any infulence of the height of the social benefits on the number of thefts...|$|R

40|$|This paper uses {{high-frequency}} data {{to model}} the volatility of asset prices over the period 2007 to 2014 for 28 individual stocks and 19 exchange-traded funds. I use the Heston (1993) model to characterize the evolution of 100 -second sampled quadratic variation over a trading day and apply generalized method of moments(GMM) to estimate three parameters of the model: the asymptotic mean, speed of mean reversion and the volatility of volatility. <b>I</b> <b>discover</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Heston model performs well in most cases regardless of the trade volume. I also find common patterns in the estimates: The speed of mean reversion is nearly time invariant, the volatility of volatility is {{much larger than the}} mean volatility and the asymptotic mean moves slowly over time but can vary a lot in times of large market uncertainty...|$|R
