5|$|I {{must confess}} that, like many others, I {{did not come}} painlessly to the Natural History. For years I was {{put off by the}} aura of {{sanctity}} and bluffness which seemed to surround it. It was the kind of book presented on prize-giving days, and <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> a work, in all senses, of the old school. Even when I eventually came to read it, I cannot say my opinion changed dramatically. I could not cope at first with its rambling disorder, its sudden plunges into thickets of taxonomic Latin, and, for a while, I failed to notice the feeling behind the often dispassionate prose.|$|E
25|$|I confess that, as {{a student}} unaware {{of the history of}} the subject and unaware of the {{connection}} with cyclotomy, I did not find the law or its so-called elementary proofs appealing. I suppose, although I would not have (and could not have) expressed myself in this way that <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> little more than a mathematical curiosity, fit more for amateurs than for the attention of the serious mathematician that I then hoped to become. It was only in Hermann Weyl's book on the algebraic theory of numbers that I appreciated it as anything more.|$|E
500|$|Caesar's niece, Atia, {{was portrayed}} by actress Polly Walker. According to Heller, while most auditioning actresses {{assumed that the}} {{character}} was the series' villainess, Walker made [...] " [...] bigger than life but completely real...She could read the phone book {{with that kind of}} brio and joy." [...] Rather than a villain, Heller wrote her to be [...] "a real life force. Everything she's doing is for the good of her family, her children. No matter how evil it gets, it's always for good reason." [...] Walker was pleased with her [...] "very complex character. I found it exciting to play such massive emotions and deal with such interesting, to say the least, situations. <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> a huge challenge, and I have huge admiration for this character. A lot of people might consider her to be sort of evil or bad, but I think she's wonderful. She's just a survivor, doing what she's got to do." ...|$|E
60|$|As I {{passed down}} the Thames I seemed {{in a new}} and {{parallel}} manner to be passing all England in review. <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> then <b>as</b> <b>I</b> had wanted my readers to see it. The thought came to me slowly as I picked my way through the Pool; it stood out clear as I went dreaming into the night out upon the wide North Sea.|$|R
50|$|<b>I</b> <b>Saw</b> <b>It</b> premiered <b>as</b> a {{one-shot}} {{work in a}} September 30, 1972 special issue of Weekly Shōnen Jump, entitled Monthly Shōnen Jump featuring manga based on various creators' biographies. Monthly Shōnen Jump later split into its own manga anthology. Nakazawa's editor later urged him to write a longer series based on <b>I</b> <b>Saw</b> <b>It,</b> Barefoot Gen was what became of this. <b>I</b> <b>Saw</b> <b>It</b> was later published {{as a part of}} a compilation of Nakazawa's short stories by Holp Shuppan, entitled Heiwa no Kane Series (平和の鐘シリーズ).|$|R
50|$|The prophet Ezekiel {{writes in}} his vision: And upward from what had the {{appearance}} of his waist <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> were gleaming metal, like the appearance of fire enclosed all around. And downward from what had the appearance of his waist <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> were the appearance of fire, and there was brightness around him. Like {{the appearance of the}} bow that is in the cloud on the day of rain, so was the appearance of the brightness all around.Such was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the Lord. And when <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it,</b> <b>I</b> fell on my face, and I heard the voice of one speaking.|$|R
2500|$|In {{the same}} {{interview}} with SheWired.com, Michael K {{was asked to}} name {{the reason for the}} blog's success. He said, [...] "I don't know. I never promoted it. I never advertised. That was never my goal. I think it was that my friends would read it and they'd send it to their friends. I used to post personal pictures and stuff because <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> both a personal blog and a blog about just things that I like. So that's when I decided I wasn't going to make it personal. I was just going to cover this and focus on that." ...|$|E
2500|$|During an {{interview}} with Lopez, journalist Diane Sawyer of ABC News noted that people [...] "in the abuse counseling industry, have said you can't tell women that, they can't do that. That something that's dangerous, even {{to see it in}} their minds." [...] Lopez responded by stating: [...] "Well, you know, this is a movie that has the touches upon those themes, but really, it's a thriller [...] it's about empowering yourself in any situation, you know, that you have. When I read the script, <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> <b>as,</b> you have the power within yourself, no matter how severe the situation can be, to change whatever that is, to find that power within yourself to change any negative situation." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hanks {{followed}} Philadelphia {{with the}} 1994 hit Forrest Gump which grossed a worldwide total of over $600 {{million at the}} box office. Hanks remarked: [...] "When I read the script for Gump, <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> one of those kind of grand, hopeful movies that the audience can go to and feel... some hope for their lot and their position in life... I got that from the movies a hundred million times when I was a kid. I still do." [...] Hanks won his second Best Actor Academy Award {{for his role in}} Forrest Gump, becoming only the second actor to have accomplished the feat of winning consecutive Best Actor Oscars. (Spencer Tracy was the first, winning in 1937–38. Hanks and Tracy were the same age at the time they received their Academy Awards: 37 for the first and 38 for the second.) ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am not scientist, worse luck," [...] Granet replied impatiently, [...] "but <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> {{enough to}} {{convince}} me that they've got the right idea. Sir Meyville thought I was the man commanding the escort they've given him,--actually rowed me out to the workshop and showed me the whole thing. I tell you <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> just <b>as</b> you described it,--saw the bottom of the sea, even the colour of the seaweed, the holes in the rocks." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{should say}} that the {{marriage}} must not be decided on until she was of age. And depend upon it, in that case, it would never come off. <b>I</b> wish you <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> do--I wish you would talk to Brooke about it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Indeed you injure me if {{you suppose}} me unconvinced. Your reasonings carry my {{judgment}} along with them entirely. At first, while I supposed you satisfied that Colonel Campbell was the giver, <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> only <b>as</b> paternal kindness, and thought it {{the most natural thing}} in the world. But when you mentioned Mrs. Dixon, I felt how much more probable that it should be the tribute of warm female friendship. And now I can see it in no other light than as an offering of love." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not a bit, sir. Out with it! I {{have faced}} death too often to flinch from it now, though <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> near me as you are." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Silly thing!" [...] he {{observed}} as {{he glanced up}} for a moment. [...] "That little diamond charm of mine has slipped off my fob. <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> we crossed the foyer from the restaurant." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> soon as decency permitted, {{and thanked}} him sincerely. According to my now {{well-developed}} theory he had certainly misappropriated his aged cousins' monies under power of attorney, and had probably driven poor Agnes Moultrie {{out of her}} wits, but I wished {{that he was not}} so gentle, and good-tempered, and innocent eyed.|$|E
25|$|<b>I</b> <b>saw</b> as my {{farewell}} to the major stage of cricket, {{and it would be}} dishonest to say <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> sentimentally <b>as</b> an actor or an opera singer who wants to leave the stage with a memorable performance...I hoped to return to Australia for the fifth time, this time as England captain, and win the Ashes with the team I had built, nutured and encouraged. I was to learn, or course, that such romantic conceptions are not only born in the minds of fiction writers, but can die there as well.|$|R
6000|$|... "'Tis {{the only}} place to spend money--so the boys tell me. I've never been there but once, and then only for three days. I went on to get a man when I was sheriff in San Juan. <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> then mostly <b>as</b> a {{wonderful}} fine swamp to lose a thief in." ...|$|R
2500|$|Cahill later reflected: [...] "They {{asked if}} I would take part, even though I was only 14 {{at the time}} and it was an under-20 tournament. <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> simply <b>as</b> a chance to go on holiday because my {{grandmother}} was ill at the time in Samoa. It was a chance to go back and see her on expenses as the Samoans were paying for all my flights, accommodation and living expenses. I could not have cared less about playing for them. It was a men's tournament and I never expected to play." ...|$|R
60|$|Tono-Bungay {{shouted at}} me from a {{hoarding}} near Adelphi Terrace; I saw it afar off near Carfax Street; it cried out again upon me in Kensington High Street, and burst into a perfect clamour; six or seven times <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> I drew near my diggings. It certainly had an air of being {{something more than a}} dream.|$|E
6000|$|... "I didn't guess it, lad; <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> {{plain as}} the nose {{on your own}} face. Anybody could see it with half an eye. Why, I've seen it for years past; but that's not the point. The first {{question}} is, Are you able to feed your wives without requirin' them to work too hard in the fields?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, don't {{speak of}} it," [...] said Kate. [...] "I {{am afraid that}} I have given you a great fright. I was feeling far from well, and I suppose that I must have {{imagined}} all about that dreadful monk. Yet, at the time, I assure you that <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> plainly as I see you now." ...|$|E
5000|$|The album sold poorly, {{possibly}} {{as a result}} of poor advertising. In an interview Jones stated that “I just plain didn’t care to put that much energy into promoting. Perhaps I should have. <b>I</b> just <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> something to do for personal enjoyment and for the fans. Lord knows I spent enough money producing it. But the 80s were so busy for us. A lot of good things were set aside. My mind was on performing in 41,000 seat stadiums and having Monkees records all over the Top 40.” ...|$|R
5000|$|Williams creates {{paintings}} and painted sculpture from found objects, references to pop culture and rhythmic patterns {{inspired by the}} geometric forms found in nature. His work was included in Reverb: Past, Present, Future, at the Contemporary Arts Center (New Orleans), where New York curator, Isolde Brielmaier, unpacked the tenth anniversary of Hurricane Katrina through the survey show. [...] "I had this old chair that sat in my bathroom for the longest time, and <b>I</b> always <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> a piece of sculpture. It looks like a hanger, but it almost looked {{like a piece of}} African sculpture to me." ...|$|R
50|$|Housman {{wrote the}} poem in 1896, perhaps {{inspired}} {{by the death of}} his close friend Adalbert Jackson in 1892. Published in the period between the two Boer Wars, the poem gained even more popularity during World War <b>I,</b> <b>as</b> many <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> a poignant lament for the lost generation of so many bright, young men, cut down in their prime.|$|R
6000|$|... "A long race-ship, sir, from Guayaquil, {{with an old}} gentleman on board,--Don Francisco de Xararte was his name, and by token, he had a gold falcon hanging to a chain round his neck, and a green {{stone in}} the breast of it. <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> we rowed him aboard. O tell me, sir, tell me {{for the love of}} God, did you take that ship?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I tell you, sir. I {{held the}} maid, and big John Beer (Gentleman Jan they call him) held me; and the maid had both her hands tight in your belt. <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> plain as I see you, {{just before the}} wave covered us, though little I thought what was in it; and should never have remembered you had a belt at all, if I hadn't thought over things {{in the last five}} minutes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I read no further. When I had got on, line by line, {{to those}} words, it burst on {{me like a}} flash of lightning. In an instant <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> plainly as I see it now. It is horrible, it is unheard of, it outdares all daring; but, if I can only nerve myself to face one terrible necessity, {{it is to be}} done. I may personate the richly {{provided}} widow of Allan Armadale of Thorpe Ambrose, if I can count on Allan Armadale's death in a given time.|$|E
5000|$|She first {{develops}} {{a crush on}} Derek Shepherd in season six. Carina MacKenzie from The Los Angeles Times called it [...] "ridiculous" [...] and added: [...] "April is drooling all over Chief McDreamy. Vomit. (...) She's {{been reduced to a}} 12-year-old with hearts in her eyes and a painful inability to be subtle." [...] Drew herself was skeptical about it, saying: [...] "The biggest thing that people did not like about my character was they thought I was a threat for the Mer/Der relationship, which I kind of found was super ridiculous (...) <b>I</b> never <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> anything that would ever transpire into something that might threaten them. <b>I</b> only <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> a really pathetic little crush." [...] She briefly has feelings for Alex Karev who almost makes her lose her virginity when he tries to sleep with her in Something's Gotta Give. Wetpaint commented that he made her feel [...] "worthless and unwanted when she was at her most vulnerable." [...] Kepner also briefly dates Dr. Robert Stark, a senior pediatric surgical attending. After her fellow residents make fun of her, she breaks up with him, creating a coldness between them. However, it is Stark who recommends her as chief resident to Dr. Hunt. Drew stated: “She sees a side to Dr. Stark that he doesn’t show to anyone else at the hospital, and she finds that part endearing...I think they enjoy the companionship.” ...|$|R
5000|$|The more {{permanent}} foundation of [...] "the Maasdam" [...] around 1270 created {{a connection between}} the areas known as Poelwijk in the Tiesselijnswaard (north of the river) and Weede in the Grote Hollandse Waard (south of the river). The establishment of the Maasdam took place during the reign of [...] Floris V. It was part of the establishment of the Grote Hollandse Waard which in itself was part of the long term policy of land reclamation by the Counts of Holland (since the reign of [...] William <b>I)</b> who <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> a way to strengthen their political and territorial powers in the region.|$|R
40|$|From the Introduction]. The European Year of Intercultural Dialogue was {{initially}} conceived as the Barroso Commission came into office. When I brought this idea {{to the audience}} during my introductory hearing in the European Parliament, <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> mainly <b>as</b> {{a response to the}} substantial changes in EU composition and the internal perceptions of people. Towards the end of 2004 {{it was clear that the}} European institutions should use their influence and visibility to put the issue of intercultural dialogue firmly on the table of European and national debates. A co-ordinated initiative was deemed necessary and even urgent because the social and cultural landscape had changed dramatically in many parts of Europe in the few preceding years...|$|R
60|$|I {{remember}} it all even now with horrible distinctness. Each item in it photographed itself vividly on my mind's eye. <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> in a picture--just as clearly, just as visually. And the effect, now I look back upon {{it with a}} maturer judgment, was precisely like a photograph in another way too. It was wholly unrelated in time and space: it stood alone by itself, lighted up by a single spark, without rational connection before or after it. What led up to it all, I hadn't the very faintest idea. I only knew the Event itself took place; and I, like a statue, stood rooted {{in the midst of}} it.|$|E
60|$|At {{last the}} sign I {{had been waiting}} for was given. <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> plainly {{as if it had been}} meant for me; I believe I saw it before the man for whom it was intended, and but for my fears {{concerning}} Madonna Paola, I could have laughed outright at their clumsy assurance. The man who rode on Madonna's right turned in his saddle and put up his hand as if to beckon Stefano. I was regaling him with one of the choicest of Messer Sacchetti's paradoxes, gurgling, myself, at the humour of the thing I told. I paid no heed to the sign. I continued to expound my quip, as though we had the night before us in which to make its elusive humour clear. But out of the tail of my eye I watched my good friend Stefano, and I saw his right hand steal round to the region of his back where I knew his dagger to be slung. Yet was I patient. There should be no blundering through an excessive precipitancy. I talked on until I saw that my suspicions were amply realised. I caught the cold gleam of steel in the hand that he brought back as stealthily as he had carried it to his poniard. Sant' Iddio! What a coward he was for all his bulk, to go so slyly about the business of stabbing a poor, helpless, defenceless Fool.|$|E
60|$|I took up my muff {{and walked}} on. The {{incident}} had occurred {{and was gone}} for me: it was an incident of no moment, no romance, no interest in a sense; yet it marked with change one single hour of a monotonous life. My help had been needed and claimed; I had given it: I was pleased to have done something; trivial, transitory though the deed was, it was yet an active thing, and I was weary of an existence all passive. The new face, too, was like a new picture introduced to the gallery of memory; and it was dissimilar to all the others hanging there: firstly, because it was masculine; and, secondly, because it was dark, strong, and stern. I had it still before me when I entered Hay, and slipped the letter into the post-office; <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> I walked fast down-hill all the way home. When I came to the stile, I stopped a minute, looked round and listened, with an idea that a horse's hoofs might ring on the causeway again, and that a rider in a cloak, and a Gytrash-like Newfoundland dog, might be again apparent: I saw only the hedge and a pollard willow before me, rising up still and straight to meet the moonbeams; I heard only the faintest waft of wind roaming fitful among the trees round Thornfield, a mile distant; and when I glanced down {{in the direction of}} the murmur, my eye, traversing the hall-front, caught a light kindling in a window: it reminded me that I was late, and I hurried on.|$|E
