5|$|During their {{relatively}} short tenure, the Ayyubids ushered {{in an era}} of economic prosperity in the lands they ruled, and the facilities and patronage provided by the Ayyubids led to a resurgence in intellectual activity in the Islamic world. This period was also marked by an Ayyubid process of vigorously strengthening Sunni Muslim <b>dominance</b> <b>in</b> the region by constructing numerous madrasas (Islamic schools of law) in their major cities.|$|E

5|$|Egyptian rule in Palestine {{resulted}} {{in the destruction of}} Acre and thus, the political importance of Nablus was further elevated. The Ottomans wrested back control of Palestine from Egypt in 1840–41.

His successor was Russian-French Alexander Alekhine, a strong attacking player who died as the World champion in 1946. He briefly lost the title to Dutch player Max Euwe in 1935 and regained it two years later.|$|E

A member of Henry Clay's National Republican Party, Morehead entered politics just as his party was beginning to challenge the Democratic Party's <b>dominance</b> <b>in</b> the state.|$|E

40|$|CP-net (Conditional Preference Network) {{is one of}} the {{extensively}} studied languages for representing {{and reasoning}} with preferences. The fundamental operation of <b>dominance</b> testing <b>in</b> CP-nets, i. e. determining whether an outcome is preferred to another, is very important in many real-world applications. Current techniques for solving general dominance queries is to search for improving flipping sequence from one outcome to another as a proof of the <b>dominance</b> relation <b>in</b> all rankings satisfying the given CP-net. However, it is generally a hard problem even for binary-valued, acyclic CPnets and tractable search algorithms exist only for specific problem classes. Hence, {{there is a need for}} efficient algorithms and techniques for <b>dominance</b> testing <b>in</b> more general problem settings. In this paper, we propose a heuristic approach, called DT*, to <b>dominance</b> testing <b>in</b> arbitrary acyclic multi-valued CP-nets. Our proposed approach guides the search process efficiently and allows significant reduction of search effort without impacting soundness or completeness of the search process. We present results of experiments that demonstrate the computational efficiency and feasibility of our approach to dominance testing...|$|R

Crittenden, was the last governor elected from the party of the Commonwealth's favorite son, Henry Clay.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{founding}} of Sandakan, Sulu Archipelago {{was the source of}} dispute between Spain and the Sultanate of Sulu for economic <b>dominance</b> <b>in</b> the region. By 1864, Spain had blockaded the Sultanate possessions in the Sulu Archipelago. The Sultanate of Sulu awarded a German consular service ex-member a piece of land in the Sandakan Bay to seek protection from Germany. In 1878, the Sultanate sold north-eastern Borneo to an Austro-Hungarian consul who later left the territory to a British colonial merchant. The German presence over the area raised concern among the British. As a result, a protocol was signed between the British, German and the Spanish to recognise Spanish sovereignty over the Sulu Archipelago, in return for the Spanish not intervening in British affairs in northern Borneo.|$|E

5|$|Crittenden {{ordered the}} {{refurbishing}} {{of the state}} penitentiary, which had been damaged by a fire, and called for an extensive state geological survey. He also advised {{the creation of a}} sinking fund to retire the state's debt. The state adopted a new constitution during Crittenden's term, though Crittenden was not a delegate to the constitutional convention and apparently had little influence on the drafting of the document. Most Whigs opposed the calling of a constitutional convention because it would necessarily involve reapportionment of the state's legislative districts and threaten Whig <b>dominance</b> <b>in</b> the General Assembly; nevertheless, Crittenden belatedly supported the call for a convention during his 1848 gubernatorial campaign.|$|E
5|$|Gia Long's {{rule was}} {{noted for its}} Confucian orthodoxy. He overcame the Tây Sơn {{rebellion}} and reinstated the classical Confucian education and civil service system. He moved the capital from Hanoi south to Huế as the country's populace had also shifted south over the preceding centuries, and built up fortresses and a palace in his new capital. Using French expertise, he modernized Vietnam's defensive capabilities. In deference to the assistance of his French friends, he tolerated the activities of Roman Catholic missionaries, something that became increasingly restricted under his successors. Under his rule, Vietnam strengthened its military <b>dominance</b> <b>in</b> Indochina, expelling Siamese forces from Cambodia and {{turning it into a}} vassal state.|$|E

At the 1991 World Aquatics Championships in Perth, Western Australia, Haislett won the 100-meter freestyle, and swam the anchor legs for the winning U.S. teams in the 4×100-meter freestyle and the 4×100-meter medley relays, ending the East German women's eighteen years of overwhelming <b>dominance</b> <b>in</b> the 100-meter freestyle at the world championships. Haislett also endured the emotional agony of disqualifying her team on an early exchange in the 4×200-meter freestyle relay – a relay race that the American women won in the water.|$|E

He retired from politics in 1811, declining nomination to the Supreme Court because of his health. His descendants were a major influence in Worcester for much of the 19th century.|$|E
5|$|In 1111, {{according}} to the eleventhfourteenth-century Annals of Inisfallen, Domnall mac Taidc seized the kingship of the Isles by force. This annal-entry is the only notice of Domnall's lordship in the Isles preserved by Irish sources. This could indicate that the chronicle's aforesaid account of the petitioning of Muirchertach is incorrectly dated, and actually refers to about 1111. However, {{the fact that the}} chronicle places the petitioning during a period of new-found Uí Briain <b>dominance</b> <b>in</b> the region, before Magnús' arrival in the Isles, and {{at about the same time}} as Amlaíb's death, suggests that the chronicle's chronology concerning these events is sound, and that Domnall's seizure of the kingship in 1111 was indeed a return to the Isles.|$|E
5|$|Initially, oil {{production}} {{was conducted by}} many small producers. The early exploration and production frenzy produced an unstable supply of oil, which often resulted in overproduction. In the early years, a few major finds led to easy availability and major drops in prices, but were followed by limited exploration and a sudden spike in prices as production dwindled. The situation led exploration to spread into the neighboring states of Oklahoma, Louisiana, and Arkansas, who competed with Texas for <b>dominance</b> <b>in</b> {{oil production}}. The strike at Glenn Pool near Tulsa, Oklahoma in 1905 established Tulsa as the leading U.S. oil production center until the 1930s. Though Texas soon lagged behind Oklahoma and California, {{it was still a}} major producer.|$|E
