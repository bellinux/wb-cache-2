5|$|The {{ship was}} then {{taken off the}} pontoon, in {{preparation}} for her re-entry into Bristol, now truly afloat. On Sunday 5 July, amidst considerable media interest, the ship was towed up the River Avon to Bristol. Perhaps the most memorable moment for the crowds that lined the final few miles was her passage under the Clifton Suspension Bridge, another Brunel design. She waited for {{two weeks in the}} Cumberland Basin for a tide high enough to <b>get</b> <b>her</b> <b>back</b> through the locks to the Floating Harbour and her birthplace, the dry dock in the Great Western Dockyard (now a grade II* listed building, disused since bomb damage in the Second World War).|$|E
5|$|However, out at {{the site}} of the accident, it was {{discovered}} that the bags of cement had solidified and had to be separated before the BX could be raised and the salvage could not be completed before freeze-up. In the spring of 1920, the salvage work was completed and at a cost of $40,000 the BX was raised and patched sufficiently to <b>get</b> <b>her</b> <b>back</b> to Fort George. The newly overhauled BC Express pushed her back upstream through the Fort George Canyon and to the shipyard at Fort George. This would be the first time in the history of sternwheelers that one would push another upriver through a canyon. That it could be accomplished was a fitting testament to the craftsmanship of Alexander Watson Jr and the skill of Captain Browne and Captain Bucey.|$|E

It is never shown or said what Edgerton did during the interrogation, but it is heavily implied {{that he may have}} used physical force, up to and including applying pressure to the gunshot wound through the teen's wrist; Don expressed concern to his father over being willing to go that far, even if he wasn't doing it himself. After this discussion, he convinced his father that it is good to have someone to come home to, and that is why he comes around the Craftsman house so often rather than staying at his apartment.|$|E

25|$|In March 1911, Captain Ritchie {{returned}} to the Chilco with his crew and began the salvage operations and temporary repairs that were necessary to <b>get</b> <b>her</b> <b>back</b> to Quesnel where she could be properly made ready for the season. In late April, Ritchie decided that the river was clear and started the trip downstream to Quesnel. Upon entering {{the head of the}} Cottonwood Canyon, he saw that the foot of the canyon was blocked solid with ice. The Chilco was rapidly speeding towards the deadly obstacle and {{it was too late to}} turn back. Fortunately, the captain and the crew escaped to the shore on the lifeboat and there were no injuries or loss of life. (Other reports were made in the local paper, then the Fort George Herald, that the escape was made onto the ice). Nonetheless, the end result was the same, the crew survived, but the Chilco did not. She was torn apart in the icy waters and not one piece of her was ever recovered.|$|E

The two become a couple until Navid reveals to Adrianna that he has never stopped loving her, and she dumps Javier for Navid. Although he initially resolves to <b>get</b> <b>her</b> <b>back,</b> Javier becomes angered by this. He tells her that her singing career is over, before dying in a car crash, which Adrianna survives. She steals Javier's song book and performs one of his songs at his memorial service, which becomes a hit. She is then blackmailed by Javier's uncle, Victor, who becomes her manager and takes a huge portion of her earnings and forces her to do some things she finds uncomfortable, such as taking half naked photos and forming a snobby famous image that did not exist before. Navid, realizing the blackmail, asks Adrianna not to give in to the threats of Victor. Adrianna decides to take control of her career from Victor after seeing herself on the cover of a magazine.
