Like all members of the genus Paenibacillus, its predominant fatty acid is anteiso-C15:0 (a straight chain of 15 carbon atoms, without any double bonds). Other abundant fatty acids are iso-C16:0, iso-C15:0 and n-C16:0. The bacterium has a GC-content of 44.3%. Its cell wall contains the <b>diamino</b> acid meso-2,6-diaminopimelic acid.|$|E
50|$|Like other Gram-positive microbes, S. haemolyticus has a thick, rather homogenous, {{cell wall}} (60-80 nm) {{composed}} of peptidoglycan, teichoic acid, and protein. Peptidoglycan of group A3 (with L-lysine as the <b>diamino</b> acid in position 3 of the peptide subunit and a glycine-rich interpeptide bridge) is a characteristic {{feature of this}} microbe, and the two predominant cross-bridges are COOH-Gly-Gly-Ser-Gly-Gly-NH2 and COOH-Ala-Gly-Ser-Gly-Gly-NH2. Alterations of these cross-bridges are implicated in glycopeptide resistance. S. haemolyticus teichoic acids are water-soluble polymers with repeating phosphodiester groups covalently linked to peptidoglycan. Peptidoglycan type L-Lys-Gly 3.5-4.0, L-Ser0.9-1.5 Teichoic acid contains both glycerol and N-acetylglucosamine. The major cell wall fatty acids are CBr-15, CBr-17, C18, and C20.|$|E

Our results show that <b>diamino</b> diphenyl sulfone interacts quite strongly with the headgroups of dipalmitoyl phosphatidyl choline whereas the <b>diamino</b> monophenyl sulfone-dipalmitoyl phosphatidyl choline interaction is quite weak.

40|$|Lysinuric protein {{intolerance}} (LPI) is an {{autosomal recessive}} defect of <b>diamino</b> acid transport characterised by massive diaminoaciduria, especially lysinuria, with hyperammonaemia after heavy nitrogen intake. The defect {{has previously been}} demonstrated in the kidney, and is probably present in the liver cells. To evaluate {{the effect of the}} LPI gene on the net intestinal absorption of the <b>diamino</b> acids and citrulline, separate oral loads of each were given to controls, and to subjects heterozygous and homozygous for LPI. In the affected subjects the plasma concentrations of the loaded <b>diamino</b> acids showed lower increments after the loads than in the controls, the difference being marked in the homozygotes and moderate in the heterozygotes. Urinary excretion failed to explain these differences. Thus, the <b>diamino</b> acid transport defect of LPI is also present in the intestine. After citrulline loads, in contrast, plasma citrulline levels rose similarly in controls and homozygotes. Thus, LPI is associated with intact citrulline absorption. The ornithinopenic hyperammonaemia of LPI is probably preventable by supplementing dietary protein with the ornithine precursor citrulline...|$|E

(1961) Nature 190, 389 – 390; Chyba, C. F. & Sagan, C. (1992) Nature 355, 125 – 132]. We report the identification of <b>diamino</b> acids in the Murchison meteorite by new enantioselective GC-MS analyses. dl- 2, 3 -diaminopropanoic acid, dl- 2, 4 -diaminobutanoic acid, 4, 4 ′-diaminoisopentanoic acid, 3, 3 ′-diaminoisobutanoic acid, and 2, 3 -diaminobutanoic acid were detected in the parts per billion range after chemical transformation into N,N-diethoxycarbonyl ethyl ester derivatives.

40|$|A {{new method}} for the {{chemical}} labelling of nucleic acid with biotin to produce non-radioactive probes has been developed. NN'-Bis-(3 -aminopropyl) butane- 1, 4 -diamine (spermine) and long-chain <b>diamino</b> compounds (diaminohexane, diaminodecane and diaminododecane) were linked covalently to biotin {{and the resultant}} conjugates were attached to nucleic acid by using a cross-linking reagent (glutaraldehyde or diepoxyoctane). Iodoacetylation and biotinylation of the long-chain <b>diamino</b> compounds produced modified biotinylated conjugates that {{can be linked to}} DNA without the use of a cross-linking reagent. These types of probes attach one biotin molecule to each linker arm of spermine, <b>diamino</b> and iodoacetylated amino derivatives.

40|$|In {{patients}} with an autosomal recessive <b>diamino</b> acid transport disorder, lysinuric protein intolerance (LPI), we measured plasma and urinary amino acids basally, and during intravenous infusion of citrulline at two rates. Compared with controls, the patients' plasma citrulline concentrations rose similarly, but urinary citrulline excretion increased excessively. Their plasma arginine and ornithine levels rose subnormally, but massive argininuria and moderate ornithinuria appeared. The excretion {{rates of the}} third <b>diamino</b> acid lysine and other amino acids remained practically unaltered, thus excluding mutual competition as the cause for the increases. The results suggest that (a) in the normal kidney reabsorption involves partial conversion of citrulline to arginine and ornithine (metabolic run-out), (b) in LPI, the <b>diamino</b> acid transport defect {{is located at the}} basolateral cell membrane of the renal tubules; this inhibits the efflux of arginine and ornithine, increasing their cellular concentration, which in turn inhibits the metabolic disposal of citrulline, and causes leakage of arginine, ornithine, and citrulline into the tubular lumen...|$|E

With these applications in mind the polymers were characterised by infra red spectroscopy, gel permeation chromatography {{and in the case of}} aqueous soluble polymers by potentiometric titration. Thin films of poly (lysine ethyl ester isophthalamide) plasticised with poly (caprolactone) were cast from DMSO/chloroform solutions and their mechanical properties measured on a Hounsfield Hti tensiometer. Interfacial synthesis was investigated as a synthetic route for the production of linear functional polyamides. High molecular weight polymer was obtained only when esterified <b>diamino</b> acids were condensed with aromatic diacid chlorides.

A novel miscible mixed solvent single phase reaction was investigated for production of copolymers of esterified and non-esterified amino acids with diacid chlorides. Aliphatic diacid chlorides were unsuitable for condensing <b>diamino</b> acids using this technique because of high rates of hydrolysis.

Electron-with-drawing substituents on the aldehyde favor enol formation, the same holds for N,N'-Dipp [2, 6 -di(2 -propyl) phenyl] and N,N'-Mes [2, 4, 6 -trimethylphenyl] substitution on the carbene component. The latter effect rests on stabilization of the <b>diamino</b> enol tautomer by Dipp substitution, and could be-attributed to dispersive interaction of the 2 -propyl groups with the enol moiety. For three enol-ketone pairs, equilibration of the, thermodynamically disfavored tautomer was attempted, with acids and bases but could not be effected, indicating kinetic inhibition of proton transfer...|$|E
