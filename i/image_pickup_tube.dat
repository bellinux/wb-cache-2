40|$|A {{method for}} obtaining {{electronic}} chroma signals {{with a single}} scanning-type image device is described. A color multiplexed light signal is produced using an arrangement of dichroic filter stripes. In the particular system described, a two layer filter is used to color modulate external light which is then detected by an <b>image</b> <b>pickup</b> <b>tube.</b> The resulting time division multiplexed electronic signal from the pickup tube is converted by a decoder into a green color signal, and a single red-blue multiplexed signal, which is demultiplexed to produce red and blue color signals. The three primary color signals can be encoded as standard NTSC color signals...|$|E

Two types of blocking contacts, homojunction and heterophase blocking, {{have been proposed}} to sustain the sufficient charges on the photoreceptor and a low current level of vidicon target in the dark. An "intrisic" a-Si : H prepared in the optimized conditions is applicable as the photoconductive layer of the both devices. Excellent photoresponse can be achieved in the charge depletion devices with the blocking contacts in whole visible region. With {{in the framework of}} our laboratory scale study, we conclude that a-Si : H is a promising material as a photoconductor of image devices...|$|E
50|$|The Apollo TV Camera {{refers to}} several {{television}} cameras {{used in the}} Apollo program's space missions, and on the later Skylab and Apollo-Soyuz Test Project missions, in the late 1960s and 1970s. These cameras varied in design, with image quality improving significantly with each successive model. Two companies made these various camera systems: RCA and Westinghouse. Originally, these slow-scan television (SSTV) cameras, running at 10 frames-per-second (fps), produced only black-and-white pictures and first flew on the Apollo 7 mission in October 1968. A color camera — using a field-sequential color system — flew on the Apollo 10 mission in May 1969, and every mission after that. The Color Camera ran at the North American standard 30 fps. The cameras all used <b>image</b> <b>pickup</b> <b>tubes</b> that were initially fragile, as one was irreparably damaged during the live broadcast of the Apollo 12 mission's first moonwalk. Starting with the Apollo 15 mission, a more robust, damage-resistant camera was used on the lunar surface. All of these cameras required signal processing back on Earth to make the frame rate and color encoding compatible with analog broadcast television standards.|$|R
5000|$|The Link 125 {{camera was}} {{purchased}} in quantity by the BBC and deployed {{to most of}} the studios at Television Centre, Pebble Mill in Birmingham and Belfast as well as several other BBC studios. It was also the camera of choice at Limehouse Television. As well as ITV company Television South (TVS) used the model in its Maidstone studios, which were still in use by those studios when they were sold off as an independent studio facility following the loss of TVS's franchise at the end of 1992.The 125 was a well thought out and well-built studio and OB camera developed from the Link 120 portable camera system. It also contained a comprehensive communications system and used a camera control unit (CCU) based around the 110's but updated with auto black, white, iris and centering functions.The BBC preferred to use a mid range Schneider-Kreuznach lens as it gave good zoom angles. Some believed it produced one of the best <b>images</b> for a <b>pickup</b> <b>tube</b> camera, others believed it could never match the quality of the EMI 2001. Many BBC users felt that the image was soft and not easy to focus, it also produced an unusual image effect that formed the shape of a 'teardrop'The Link 125 was the most successful of all of Links cameras and the last studio to use them was BBC Pebble Mill which decommissioned the last four in 1994 from the news studio having upgraded to Sony BVP-375's and Ikegami HL-55's a few years before. These cameras have become collectable vintage items.|$|R
25|$|In color {{television}} and video cameras manufactured before the 1990s, the incoming light was separated by prisms and filters into the three RGB primary colors feeding each color {{into a separate}} video camera <b>tube</b> (or <b>pickup</b> <b>tube).</b> These tubes are a type of cathode ray tube, {{not to be confused}} with that of CRT displays.|$|R

50|$|Digital {{and film}} cameras share an optical system, {{typically}} using a lens with a variable diaphragm to focus light onto an <b>image</b> <b>pickup</b> device. The diaphragm and shutter admit {{the correct amount}} of light to the imager, just as with film but the <b>image</b> <b>pickup</b> device is electronic rather than chemical. However, unlike film cameras, digital cameras can display images on a screen immediately after being recorded, and store and delete images from memory. Most digital cameras can also record moving videos with sound. Some digital cameras can crop and stitch pictures and perform other elementary image editing.|$|R
50|$|Historically, flying-spot {{scanners}} {{were also}} used as primitive live-action studio cameras {{at the dawn of}} electronic television, in the 1920s.A projector equipped with a spinning perforated Nipkow disc created the spot that scanned the stage. Scanning a subject this way required a completely dark stage, and was impractical for production use, but gave early researchers a way to generate live images before practical imaging <b>pickup</b> <b>tubes</b> were perfected.|$|R
25|$|With {{the arrival}} of commercially viable {{charge-coupled}} device (CCD) technology in the 1980s, first the <b>pickup</b> <b>tubes</b> were replaced {{with this kind of}} sensor. Later, higher scale integration electronics was applied (mainly by Sony), simplifying and even removing the intermediate optics, thereby reducing the size of home video cameras and eventually leading to the development of full camcorders. Current webcams and mobile phones with cameras are the most miniaturized commercial forms of such technology.|$|R

Dry-sump designs are not susceptible to the oil movement problems from high cornering forces that wet-sump systems can suffer where {{the force of the}} vehicle cornering can cause the oil to pool {{on one side of the}} oil pan, possibly uncovering the oil pump <b>pickup</b> <b>tube</b> and causing cavitation and loss of oil pressure.|$|R
50|$|Due to Apollo 12's camera failure, a new {{contract}} was awarded to the RCA Astro Electronics facility in East Windsor, NJ. The RCA system used a new, more sensitive and durable TV camera tube. The design team was headed by Robert G. Horner. The team used the newly developed SIT <b>pickup</b> <b>tube.</b> The improved image-quality was obvious to the public with the RCA camera's better tonal detail in the mid-range, {{and the lack of}} blooming that was apparent in the previous missions.|$|R
50|$|The {{concept of}} cameras using three <b>image</b> <b>pickups,</b> {{one for each}} primary color, was first {{developed}} for color photography on three glass plates {{in the late nineteenth}} century, and in the 1960s through 1980s was the dominant method to record color images in television, as other possibilities to record more than one color on the video camera tube were difficult.|$|R
50|$|Lebar and his Westinghouse team {{wanted to}} add color to their camera as early as 1967, and {{they knew that the}} CBS system would likely be the best system to study. The Westinghouse Lunar Color Camera used a {{modified}} version of CBS's field-sequential color system. A color wheel, with six filter segments, was placed behind the lens mount. It rotated at 9.99 revolutions per second, producing a scan rate of 59.94 fields per second, the same as NTSC video. Synchronization between the color wheel and <b>pickup</b> <b>tube's</b> scan rate was provided by a magnet on the wheel, which controlled the sync pulse generator that governed the tube's timing.|$|R
50|$|Upon {{return to}} the United States from Munich, Ramberg {{returned}} to Cornell and continued the work on which he based his thesis: X-ray satellites and line widths. In 1935, he left Cornell {{to take a position}} at RCA to work on both theoretical and experimental work on secondary emission, <b>pickup</b> <b>tubes,</b> and field electron emission. He later took part {{in the development of the}} theory of thermoelectric refrigeration and image tube aberrations and in demonstrating the mathematical operability of a multistage electrostatic electron multiplier. He also took part in construction of one of the first electron microscopes in the mid-1940s. He remained at RCA until 1972.|$|R
5000|$|However, Vitascan cameras only worked indoors, due to Vitascan {{being in}} essence a flying-spot scanner based system. The system's camera {{basically}} worked in reverse by projecting a {{light through the}} camera's lens onto the subject from a cathode ray tube, or CRT, mounted behind the lens (instead of a <b>pickup</b> <b>tube</b> like conventional television cameras), providing the [...] "flying spot". Four photomultiplier tubes (two for red, one for green, and one for blue) mounted inside special [...] "scoops" [...] placed {{in the studio and}} pointed at the subject would pick up the light from the camera's CRT and produce the final image to be televised.|$|R
50|$|Apollo 12 was {{the first}} mission to use the color camera on the lunar surface. About 42 minutes into telecasting the first EVA, {{astronaut}} Alan Bean inadvertently pointed the camera at the Sun while preparing to mount it on the tripod. The Sun's extreme brightness burned out the video <b>pickup</b> <b>tube,</b> rendering the camera useless. When the camera was returned to Earth, it was shipped to Westinghouse, {{and they were able}} to get an image on the section of the tube that wasn't damaged. Procedures were re-written in order to prevent such damage in the future, including the addition of a lens cap to protect the tube when the camera was repositioned off the MESA.|$|R

50|$|The 130 was {{designed}} in the mid 1980s as a high tech modern camera with aspirations of quality and high tech design {{through the use of}} microprocessors for full auto setup. Unfortunately it soon became apparent that there were several hardware and/or software errors made during the design and manufacture of this model, which seriously affected the manufacturer's reputation with its broadcast customer base, much in the same way the 2005 had done for EMI around 15 years before.This was compounded by competition from high quality camera systems from Japanese manufacturers including Sony, Ikegami and Hitachi and by the Dutch manufacturer Philips. Also at this time RCA had started to use CCDs in its cameras which produced what was considered a superior picture to the then prevailing technology of camera <b>pickup</b> <b>tubes,</b> which necessitated not so many regular adjustments in their setup procedures.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: A {{numerical}} model is {{developed for the}} complete oil supply system of a scroll com-pressor. The system includes oil sump, <b>pickup</b> <b>tube,</b> oil gallery, bearings, and associated oil feed holes, vent, and port. There are two fluids, oil and gas, inside the system. The flow is numerically simulated as a heterogeneous Eulerian–Eulerian turbulent multi-phase flow. The investigation covers the entire working process of the scroll compressor from dry-start to steady state. Two design parameters, initial oil sump depth and viscosity, are studied comparatively. The detailed oil–gas flow inside the oil supply system {{is characterized by the}} field quantities. The physical mechanisms controlling oil supply rate are defined. The oil supply rate and the bearing prime time (the time after which oil is flowing through a bearing) are obtained. The results can be used to design and optimize the oil supply system to improve the reliability and efficiency of scroll compressors...|$|R

50|$|Series 1 (2004-2008) RX-8 Renesis {{commonly}} {{suffer from}} engine failures between 80,000 and 120,000 miles due to premature apex seal wear from {{the lack of}} a center/middle oil injector which gets its oil from the oil metering pump. The rotor main bearing can also fail due to various problems like low oil pressure, and a lower viscosity oil was recommended in the North American market. The oil pan has a common problem of being crushed or bent during maintenance and can decrease the oil <b>pickup</b> <b>tube</b> flow causing main bearing failures as well. Modified Renesis engines can experience side seal failures due to a combination of exhaust back pressure and higher exhaust temperature. Overheating and heat expansion of housings can cause seals in the rotary engine to fail as well. Most of the issues can be circumvented by using a higher viscosity oil and adding 2 cycle oil to the gas.Flooding can occur in the RX-8 as in previous generations of rotary engine cars.|$|R

5000|$|The {{earliest}} {{video cameras}} were mechanical flying-spot scanners {{which were in}} use in the 1920s and 1930s {{during the period of}} mechanical television. Improvements in video camera tubes in the 1930s ushered in the era of electronic television. Earlier, cameras were very large devices, almost always in two sections. The camera section held the lens and tube pre-amplifiers and other necessary electronics, and was connected to a large diameter multicore cable to the remainder of the camera electronics, usually mounted in a separate room in the studio, or a remote truck. The camera head could not generate a video picture signal on its own. The video signal was output to the studio for switching and transmission. By the fifties, electronic miniaturization had progressed to the point where some monochrome cameras could operate stand alone and even be handheld. But the studio configuration remained, with the large cable bundle transmitting the signals back to the camera control unit (CCU). The CCU in turn was used to align and operate the camera's functions, such as exposure, system timing, video and black levels.The first color cameras (1950s in the US, early 1960s in Europe), notably the RCA TK-40/41 series, were much more complex with their three (and in some models four) <b>pickup</b> <b>tubes,</b> and their size and weight drastically increased. Handheld color cameras did not come into general use until the early 1970s - the first generation of cameras were split into a camera head unit (the body of the camera, containing the lens and <b>pickup</b> <b>tubes,</b> and held on the shoulder or a body brace in front of the operator) connected via a cable bundle to a backpack CCU. The Ikegami HL-33, the RCA TK45 and the Thomson Microcam were portable two piece color cameras introduced in the early 1970s. For field work a separate VTR was still required to record the camera's video output. Typically this was either a portable 1" [...] reel to reel VTR, or a portable 3/4" [...] U-matic VCR. Typically, the two camera units would be carried by the camera operator, while a tape operator would carry the portable recorder. With the introduction of the RCA TK76 in 1976, camera operators were finally able to carry on their shoulders a one piece camera containing all the electronics to output a broadcast quality composite video signal. A separate videotape recording unit was still required.|$|R

In design methodological analyses these factors {{and their impact on}} the way a chain of designs is developed are studied. In a piecemeal rationality insight into the combination of these factors in a certain situation leads to decisions about {{the next step in the}} design process. This concept is illustrated by three case studies: the Brabantia corkscrew, the Philips Stirling (hot air) engine and the Philips Plumbicon (a television camera <b>pickup</b> <b>tube).</b> Differences between these three designs show the need to differentiate between the following kinds of technologies: experience-based technologies, macrotechnologies and microtechnologies. This distinction gives us insight into the level of abstraction of the knowledge that is used in the various technologies and thus can be useful for determining the order in which the various technologies should be dealt with in education. If we accept that one of the aims of Technology Education is to give a realistic idea of how technological developments take place in the industrial practice, these design methodological analysis can serve as a tool for teaching this school subject. This requires a didactical transformation of the academic way in which design methodological analyses are made into a more practical approach that fits with the abilities of pupils...|$|R
50|$|At first {{all these}} cameras used tube based sensors, but Charge-Coupled Device (CCD) imagers {{came on the}} scene in the mid-80s, {{bringing}} numerous benefits. Early CCD cameras could not match the colour or resolution of their tube counterparts, but the benefits of CCD technology, such as introducing smaller and lightweight cameras, a better and more stable image (that was not prone to image burn in or lag) and no need for calibration meant development on CCD imagers quickly took off and, once rivaling and offering a superior image to a tube sensor, began displacing tube-based cameras - the latter of which were all but disused by the early 1990s. Eventually, cameras with the recorder permanently mated to the camera head became the norm for ENG. In studio cameras, the camera electronics shrank, and CCD imagers replaced the <b>pickup</b> <b>tubes.</b> The thick multi-core cables connecting the camera head to the CCU were replaced in the late seventies with triax connections, a slender video cable that carried multiple video signals, intercom audio, and control circuits, and could be run for a mile or more. As the camera innards shrunk, the electronics no longer dictated the size of the enclosure, however the box shape remained, as it is necessary to hold the large studio lenses, teleprompters, electronic viewfinder (EVF), and other paraphernalia needed for studio and sports production. Electronic Field Production cameras were often mounted in studio configurations inside a mounting cage. This cage supported the additional studio accessories.|$|R
