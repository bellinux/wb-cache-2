50|$|Almost all oil {{reservoirs}} have a water zone {{below the}} oil leg, {{and some have}} also a gas cap above the oil leg. When the reservoir pressure drops due to oil production, water flows into the oil zone from below, and gas flows into the oil zone from above (if the gas cap exists), and we get a simultaneous flow and immiscible mixing of all fluid phases in the oil zone. The operator of the oil field may also inject water (and/or gas) {{in order to improve}} oil production. The petroleum industry is therefore using a generalized Darcy equation <b>for</b> <b>multiphase</b> flow that was developed by Muskat et alios. Because Darcy's name is so widespread and strongly associated with flow in porous media, the multiphase equation is denoted Darcy's law <b>for</b> <b>multiphase</b> flow or generalized Darcy equation (or law) or simply Darcy's equation (or law) or simply flow equation if the context says that the text is discussing the multiphase equation of Muskat et alios.

50|$|The {{driving force}} for mass {{transfer}} is typically {{a difference in}} chemical potential, when it can be defined, though other thermodynamic gradients may couple to the flow of mass and drive it as well. A chemical species moves from areas of high chemical potential to areas of low chemical potential. Thus, the maximum theoretical extent of a given mass transfer is typically determined by {{the point at which}} the chemical potential is uniform. For single phase-systems, this usually translates to uniform concentration throughout the phase, while <b>for</b> <b>multiphase</b> systems chemical species will often prefer one phase over the others and reach a uniform chemical potential only when most of the chemical species has been absorbed into the preferred phase, as in liquid-liquid extraction.|$|E

With the simulated results {{in terms of the}} pole topology, flux linkage, back EMF and converters, it can be concluded that the pole numbers of the new five-phase WFDSM are very large. The high accuracy position sensors should be required to make the five-phase WFDSM commutate frequently and accurately at a high speed. The four-phase and the six-phase WFDSM can be divided into two isolated channels, and both of them have a good performance as a fault-tolerant machine.

5000|$|Stokesian dynamicsis a {{solution}} technique for the Langevin equation, {{which is the}} relevant form of Newton's 2nd law for a Brownian particle. The method treats the suspended particles in a discrete sense while the continuum approximation remains valid for the surrounding fluid, i.e., the suspended particles are generally assumed to be significantly larger than the molecules of the solvent. The particles then interact through hydrodynamic forces transmitted via the continuum fluid, and when the particle Reynolds number is small, these forces are determined through the linear Stokes equations (hence {{the name of the}} method). In addition, the method can also resolve non-hydrodynamic forces, such as Brownian forces, arising from the fluctuating motion of the fluid, and interparticle or external forces. Stokesian Dynamics can thus be applied to a variety of problems, including sedimentation, diffusion and rheology, and it aims to provide the same level of understanding <b>for</b> <b>multiphase</b> particulate systems as molecular dynamics does for statistical properties of matter. For N rigid particles of radius a suspended in an incompressible Newtonian fluid of viscosity [...] and density , the motion of the fluid is governed by the Navier-Stokes equations, while the motion of the particles is described by the coupled equation of motion:In the above equation [...] is the particle translational/rotational velocity vector of dimension 6N. [...] is the hydrodynamic force, i.e., force exerted by the fluid on the particle due to relative motion between them. [...] is the stochastic Brownian force due to thermal motion of fluid particles. [...] is the deterministic nonhydrodynamic force, which may be almost any form of interparticle or external force, e.g. electrostatic repulsion between like charged particles. Brownian dynamics is one of the popular techniques of solving the Langevin equation, but the hydrodynamic interaction in Brownian dynamics is highly simplified and normally includes only the isolated body resistance. On the other hand, Stokesian dynamics includes the many body hydrodynamic interactions. Hydrodynamic interaction is very important for non-equilibrium suspensions, like a sheared suspension, where it plays a vital role in its microstructure and hence its properties. Stokesian dynamics is used primarily for non-equilibrium suspensions where it has been shown to provide results which agree with experiments.|$|E
