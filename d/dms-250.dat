50|$|There {{are also}} DMS-200 and <b>DMS-250</b> {{variants}} for tandem switches.|$|E
5000|$|The Nortel <b>DMS-250,</b> {{a larger}} {{variant of the}} DMS-100, is a popular {{competitor}} to Lucent's 4ESS, especially among telephone companies that were not previously a part of AT&T. Other DMS switches {{can also be used}} as tandems.|$|E
50|$|Digital Multiplex System (DMS) is {{the name}} shared among several {{different}} telephony product lines from Nortel Networks for wireline and wireless operators. Among them are the DMS-1 (originally named the DMS-256) Rural/Urban digital loop carrier, DMS-10 telephone switch, the DMS SuperNode family of telephone switches (DMS-100, DMS-200, <b>DMS-250,</b> DMS-300, DMS-500, DMS-GSP, DMS-MSC, DMS-MTX), and the S/DMS optical transmission system.|$|E
50|$|DMS is favoured by many European cable {{operators}} as the switching platform for their voice networks. The DMS-10 {{is widely used}} by rural wireline providers. DMS-100 and 200 switches are widely deployed throughout the U.S. and Canada by Regional Bell Operating Companies, Bell Canada and independent telephone companies {{as well as the}} US Military. The <b>DMS-250</b> is the backbone of a number of carriers' long distance networks. The DMS-300 is an international gateway switch, and the DMS-500 is commonly deployed by competitive local exchange carriers because it combines DMS-100 and 250 capabilities.|$|E
50|$|Rapid {{advances}} {{in the implementation of}} digital signal processing allowed echo cancellers to be made smaller and more cost-effective. In the 1990s, echo cancellers were implemented within voice switches for the first time (in the Northern Telecom <b>DMS-250)</b> rather than as standalone devices. The integration of echo cancellation directly into the switch meant that echo cancellers could be reliably turned on or off on a call-by-call basis, removing the need for separate trunk groups for voice and data calls. Today's telephony technology often employs echo cancellers in small or handheld communications devices via a software voice engine, which provides cancellation of either acoustic echo or the residual echo introduced by a far-end PSTN gateway system; such systems typically cancel echo reflections with up to 64 milliseconds delay.|$|E
