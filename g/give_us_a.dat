25|$|The {{struggle}} with the world is framed {{by the idea that}} series of personal and social transformations can increase our share of attributes associated with the divine and <b>give</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> larger life. It emphasizes love over altruism, rejecting the moral of the mastery of self-interest to enhance solidarity, and emphasizing the humility of individual love. This orientation has been articulated in two different voices: the sacred voice of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, and the profane voice of the secular projects of liberation.|$|E

25|$|Although {{there have}} been {{attempts}} at dating the poems of Purananuru based on {{the mention of the}} Mahabharata war, a more reliable source for the period of these poems is based on the mentions one finds on the foreign trade and presence of Greek and Roman merchants in the port of Musiri (poem 343), which <b>give</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> date of between 200 BCE to 150 CE for the period of these poems. This is further strengthened by the mention of Maurya in poem 175 and a reference to Ramayana in poem 378.|$|E

25|$|Many radical {{views of}} transsaccadic memory exist. Some are favoured {{more than others}} because of the {{evidence}} that supports them. One less-accepted theory, Breitmeyer's spatiotopic fusion hypothesis, suggested that successive images are fused based on environmental coordinates and not retinal ones. In other words, our memory stores a sequence of images from our surroundings, and joins the images together to <b>give</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> full representation in our brain. The orientation of our retinas do not have an influence on this form of memory. This theoretical form of memory supposedly stores highly detailed representations of the world in a high capacity spatial buffer. Research and experiments by other psychologists provide empirical evidence against these claims.|$|E
25|$|There {{exists a}} folio of {{drawings}} by Villard de Honnecourt from Picard in France, who between {{the years of}} about 1220 and 1230 travelled, for reasons unknown, in France {{and other parts of}} Europe as far as Hungary, producing drawings of motifs architectural, scientific and figural. The drawings, for the most part, are not original designs. They are drawn from buildings and artworks that he saw on his travels. In order that they might be utilised as designs for students, they were carefully annotated by a skilled calligrapher and placed into a leather portfolio. They <b>give</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> clear indication {{of the way in which}} decorative motifs and figurative subjects could be transferred from one region to another and from one artform to another.|$|E
25|$|The complex {{functioning}} of the CNS, even in the 1-G environment of Earth, has not revealed all its secrets.

Our ability to understand how Earth’s gravitational environment has shaped the evolution of sensory and motor systems can <b>give</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> clearer understanding of the fundamental mechanisms of CNS functions. Knowledge {{of the effects of}} gravity on CNS functions in humans, as well as elucidation of the basic mechanisms by which these effects occur, will be of direct benefit to understanding the impact of, and providing countermeasures for, long-term exposure of humans to the weightlessness of spaceflight and the partial gravity of Moon and Mars bases.|$|E

25|$|The {{first episode}} of Series Three was {{transmitted}} on Monday, 7 January 1980 at 7:15pm. Competition came from Coronation Street, game show <b>Give</b> <b>Us</b> <b>a</b> Clue and sitcom Keep {{it in the}} Family. Coverage of the Winter Olympics meant that the episode Children of Auron was shown on a Tuesday; the series returned to its regular time the following week. The series was watched {{by an average of}} 9.5million viewers. When the final episode, Terminal, was shown on 31 March 1980, the Blake's 7 production office had closed and the cast and crew had dispersed. They were surprised that, during the closing credits of Terminal, the continuity announcer declared that a new series of Blake's 7 would be shown the following year. The Head of BBC Television, Bill Cotton, was impressed by Terminal as he watched its broadcast at home. He telephoned BBC Presentation and instructed that an announcement be made during the end credits that the series would return.|$|E
25|$|Much {{of their}} {{literature}} {{has been lost}} or destroyed by the contemporary Christian Churches. The earliest description of the Bogomils is in a letter from Patriarch Theophylact of Bulgaria to Tsar Peter of Bulgaria, and {{the main source of}} doctrinal information is the work of Euthymius Zigabenus, who says that they believe that God created man's soul but matter was the invention of Satan, God's older son, who in seducing Eve lost his creative power. Concerning the Bogomils, something can be gathered from the polemic Against the Newly-Appeared Heresy of the Bogomils written in Slavonic by Cosmas the Priest, a 10th-century Bulgarian official. The old Slavonic lists of forbidden books of the 15th and 16th century also <b>give</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> clue to the discovery of this heretical literature and of the means the Bogomils employed to carry on their teachings. Much may also be learned from the doctrines of the numerous variations of Bogomilism which spread in Medieval Kievan Rus' after the 11th century.|$|E
25|$|Burmese folk {{religion}} and Buddhism are very {{closely tied to}} each other. Oftentimes {{it is common to}} see a Buddhist offering, and a nat-sin (or nat shrine) besides it. In Burma there are varying degrees of reliance on nats versus Buddhist doctrine. The beliefs and practices of folk faith vary widely across Burma, so it is difficult to define this religion exactly. Several scholars in the 19th and 20th century have done field research in villages in Burma, their findings have then been reported by themselves, as well as recently by others in various books and articles. Although {{it is difficult to determine}} what the precise beliefs and practices are, these anthropologists found several common trends that help <b>give</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> better picture of Burmese folk religion. In many instances folk faith was practised directly alongside Buddhism. It wasn’t uncommon to see families who had both Buddhist shrines and nat shrines in their own homes. There were also plenty of Buddhist monks, who simultaneously believed in the nats. Several quotes from various scholars in Burma exemplify the relationship between Buddhism and nat worship.|$|E

25|$|A modern {{audience}} might admire Batty’s will to {{flee the}} confinements of slavery and perhaps sympathize with his existential struggle to live. Initially, however, his desire to live is subsumed by his desire for power to extend his life. Why? In Heidegger’s view, because death inevitably limits the number of choices we have, freedom is earned by properly concentrating on death. Thoughts of mortality <b>give</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> motive for taking life seriously. Batty’s status as a slave identifies him as an object, but his will to power casts him as an agent and subject in the Nietzschean sense. His physical and psychological courage to rebel is developed as an ethical principle in which he revolts against a social order that has conspired against him at the genetic, cultural, and political levels. In Heidegger’s view, Batty’s willingness to defy social conformity allows for him to authentically pursue the meaning of his existence beyond his programming as a soldier. Confronting his makers becomes part of his quest, but killing them marks his failure to transcend his own nature.|$|E
25|$|The {{more closely}} we look into history, the more clearly shall we {{perceive}} {{that the system}} of chivalry is an invention almost entirely poetical. It is impossible to distinguish the countries {{in which it is}} said to have prevailed. It is always represented as distant from us both in time and place, and whilst the contemporary historians <b>give</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> clear, detailed, and complete account of the vices of the court and the great, of the ferocity or corruption of the nobles, and of the servility of the people, we are astonished to find the poets, after a long lapse of time, adorning the very same ages with the most splendid fictions of grace, virtue, and loyalty. The Romance writers of the twelfth century placed the age of chivalry in the time of Charlemagne. The period when these writers existed, is the time pointed out by Francis I. At the present day , we imagine we can still see chivalry flourishing in the persons of Du Guesclin and Bayard, under Charles V and Francis I. But when we come to examine either the one period or the other, although we find in each some heroic spirits, we are forced to confess {{that it is necessary to}} antedate the age of chivalry, at least three or four centuries before any period of authentic history.|$|E

[...] He also defended his decision to players such as Gerrard and Alonso on the bench: [...] "It was my idea to start with the players that had the most fitness and have played the most minutes. Then I wanted to bring the other players on towards the end. It worked and it showed that we have a great squad – better than last season." [...] Crouch, scorer of the winning goal, was also confident the result would boost the Liverpool squad: [...] "There is a bit of rivalry between the sides and it is great to get an early one over them. Make no bones about it, this is a big game to win and it certainly could <b>give</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> psychological edge this season." ...|$|E
