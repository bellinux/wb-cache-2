Their numbers, as both football players and fans, increased with the lifting of bans on women playing football and attending matches.The first FIFA Women's World Cup was held in 1991, and has drawn worldwide television interest. Football matches now tend to have increased numbers of women supporters at the match, as well as watching matches at home or in pubs and bars. In the United States, the Women's United Soccer Association League was formed in 2001 in response to growing interest in women's football around that country. The league collapsed in 2003, but <b>grassroots</b> <b>football</b> was not affected, and the league relaunched in 2009 as Women's Professional Soccer.

40|$|The Icelandic {{football}} club Sterken is a <b>grassroots</b> LGBT <b>football</b> team whose motto is ‘role models, not stereotypes’. Sterken propose an enlarged {{range of possible}} gay identities, where playing football is just another channel through which young adults socialise and construct legitimate gay selves. Sterken’s practices intersect and support Icelandic gender-mainstreaming. In this article we describe our ethnographic research that sought to understand {{the impact of this}} gender mainstreaming through a short immersion in the research field. We show how Sterken's motto of ‘role models, not stereotypes’ produced a tension between the club’s endeavours towards mainstreaming (e. g. ‘we are just like you’) and their activist identity politics. We conclude that Sterken's tactics constitute both a challenge to traditional hegemonic masculinities, while feeding back into an equality discourse that was deemed palatable to the mainstream, in the larger context of political discourse that lends itself toward (hetero) normative social structures...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the current study was to explore the {{influences}} Evolution Sports and Health Academy (ESHA), a <b>grassroots</b> community <b>football,</b> has on their players, coaches, associates and non-UK citizens. Western societies have grown increasingly engaged in community sport organisations due to the notion that sport {{can be used as a}} tool to enhance development within communities through their accumulation of social, economic and cultural capital. Sociology aids this study to understand how social worlds are formed and changed in society, and their influence towards groups and individuals. This case study is guided by Pierre Bourdieu’s critical social theory focussing on his concepts on capital, field and habitus. The data collection method for this study entailed six face-to-face semi-structured interviews with associates of ESHA, which were recorded on a Dictaphone, transcribed and evaluated through a thematic analysis. The themes within the data collected was that ESHA assisted the physical and social development of players whilst breaking down barriers between cultures and social classes. Associates of ESHA also expressed their frustration with the lack of stable funding and the indistinct foundations of the organisation. This case study offers an in depth understanding in how a community sport project is governed and the impacts it has on all affiliated with it...|$|R

40|$|SAVE IT is an European {{collaborative}} partnership project, {{which allows}} to several groups of stakeholders with di erent backgrounds on sports, education or computer engineering, to collaborate in this experi- ence whose main {{goal is to}} support innovative and educational approaches to reduce and prevent violence and tackle racism, discrimination, and intolerance in <b>grassroots</b> sports as <b>football.</b> This general goal is a relevant issue with an international dimension (e. g. discrimination episodes at grassroots level have taken places in virtually all Member States in the European Union). Reducing violence in sports {{is an important issue}} that has been incorporated into the European politics, and {{it is also clear that}} large disparities exist between Member States about how to handle these problems. The SAVE IT project will design a learning methodology oriented to grassroots sports in order to reduce violence, racism and dis- crimination, by promoting the recognition of sports values and teaching to the main target groups (kids, youngsters, coaches). For this purpose, it will be designed two kind of learning materials; on the one hand, develop- ment of learning modules to educate on values to be used to by coaches. On the other hand, development of contents for serious games with the goal of being used by kids and young practitioners. The innovative aspect of this project is based on the designing of new didactic materials to teach sport values, and new educational tools based on gami cation, that will be used to reach these target groups through training activities.

40|$|In recent years, China {{has been}} in the {{spotlight}} for its determination to develop a relatively unexpected industry within its boundaries, football. The idea was introduced by the current President of the People’s Republic of China, Mr Xi Jinping, who intends to turn China into a top football nation. This is rather surprising considering that China has never been successful in football and has also never had a domestic football star. Thus, the Chinese government, the Chinese Football Association and local clubs have launched several considerable projects and concluded deals where large amounts of money were involved in order to help develop football in China. The Chinese large financial investments in football have made the headlines of many newspapers, notably The Financial Times and The Economist. These investments have led the football community to wonder whether the development of football in China is worthwhile. Many football professionals mainly criticised the lack of investments in <b>grassroots</b> of Chinese <b>football</b> and the surplus of money paid by Chinese clubs to attract foreign football players. Hence, this study aims to analyse the Chinese football business model and compare it with other nations’ football business models to see if Chinese financial investments in football are reasonable. It is shown later in this document that the Chinese financial investments in football are actually guided by a well thought-out strategy. Chinese are surely financially investing a lot but when compared to other nations, Chinese financial investments in football are far from excessive. In addition, the Chinese Football Association and some Chinese football clubs have succeeded to build a strong network with top football nations and clubs in order to improve their knowledge in the sport. The main challenge for the Chinese leaders of the national football project will be to create a football culture in China, which is essential if they want their country to succeed in this sport. The Chinese government, businesses, and national football association are already financing many projects to positively influence the growth of a football culture within the country. Nonetheless, a football culture cannot simply be bought and consequently results that are expected from this spending are not immediate. The main recommendation for the Chinese authorities involved in the national football project is to keep investing in football youth development while controlling overspending. In addition, they need to remain patient in order to see emerging generations of local football stars that will have benefited from the investments currently being made...|$|R
