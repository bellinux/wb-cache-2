5|$|Great {{white sharks}} were {{previously}} thought to reach sexual maturity at around 15 years of age, but are now believed to take far longer; male great white sharks reach sexual maturity at age 26, while females take 33 {{years to reach}} sexual maturity. Maximum life span was originally believed {{to be more than}} 30 years, but a study by the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution placed it at upwards of 70 years. <b>Examinations</b> <b>of</b> vertebral growth ring count gave a maximum male age of 73 years and a maximum female age of 40 years for the specimens studied. The shark's late sexual maturity, low reproductive rate and slow growth make it vulnerable to pressures such as overfishing and environmental change.|$|E
5|$|In 1973, a {{biochemical}} polymorphism {{study was}} conducted in four sample areas of the species. Electrophoretically demonstrable variation was found in one or more populations at 15 of 39 (38%) of the loci examined, and two and sometimes three alleles per locus were detected. At the least, the findings give an indication of the kind of genetic variation that may be found between populations within a species.

5|$|Loss of cell {{viability}} in the jack jumper's venom was researched through cytometry, which measures {{the proportions of}} cells that glow {{in the presence of}} fluorescent dye and 7-Aminoactinomycin D. <b>Examinations</b> <b>of</b> the rapidly reproducing Epstein–Barr B-cells showed that the cells lost viability within minutes when exposed to pilosulin 1. Normal white blood cells were also found to alter easily when exposed to pilosulin 1. However, partial peptides of pilosulin 1 were less efficient at lowering {{cell viability}}; the residue 22 N-terminal plays a critical role in the cytotoxic activity of pilosulin 1.|$|E
5|$|Orwell wrote six novels: Burmese Days, A Clergyman's Daughter, Keep the Aspidistra Flying, Coming Up for Air, Animal Farm and Nineteen Eighty-Four. Most {{of these}} were semi-autobiographical. Burmese Days was {{inspired}} by his period working as an imperial policeman and is fictionalized; A Clergyman's Daughter follows {{a young woman who}} passes out from overwork and wakes up an amnesiac, forced to wander the countryside as she finds herself, eventually losing her belief in God, despite being the daughter of a clergyman. Keep the Aspidistra Flying and Coming Up for Air are <b>examinations</b> <b>of</b> the British class system. Animal Farm and Nineteen Eighty-Four are his most famous novels: both are anti-totalitarian books which criticize the Soviet Union in particular.|$|E

5|$|The Antarctic scallop {{was first}} {{described}} by the British zoologist Edgar Albert Smith in 1902 as Pecten colbecki. He worked at the British Museum and was responsible for examining and describing shells from collections made {{over the years that}} had been deposited there. The German malacologist Johannes Thiele determined in 1934 that the characteristics of the Antarctic scallop were sufficiently different from those of other members of the genus Pecten to warrant its inclusion in a separate genus, Adamussium. More recently, <b>examinations</b> <b>of</b> the chromosome structure and of the mitochondrial DNA of A. colbecki have been undertaken, but the exact phylogenetic relationship it has with other pectinids is still unclear.|$|E
5|$|The {{porbeagle}} is {{an active}} predator that predominantly ingests small to medium-sized bony fishes. It chases down pelagic fishes such as lancet fish, mackerel, pilchards, herring, and sauries, and forages near the bottom for groundfishes such as cod, hake, icefish, dories, sand lances, lumpsuckers, and flatfish. Cephalopods, particularly squid, also form {{an important component of}} its diet, while smaller sharks such as spiny dogfish (Squalus acanthias) and tope sharks (Galeorhinus galeus) are rarely taken. <b>Examinations</b> <b>of</b> porbeagle stomach contents have also found small shelled molluscs, crustaceans, echinoderms, and other invertebrates, which were likely ingested incidentally, as well as inedible debris such as small stones, feathers, and garbage fragments.|$|E

5|$|Caprellamutica are {{omnivorous}} highly adaptable opportunistic feeders. <b>Examinations</b> <b>of</b> their stomach contents {{reveal a}} highly varied diet that {{depended on the}} particular substrate they are found on. They are predominantly detritivores, but have the remarkable ability of adjusting feeding methods from being grazers, scavengers, filter feeders, and even predators depending on the conditions of their environments. C.mutica sieve food particles or small organisms from the water by waving their bodies back and forth, with the comb-like setae on their second pair of antennae extended. They then clean off trapped particles by bending their antennae down to their mouthparts. They also use their antennae to scrape food particles from surfaces of their bodies or the substrate that they are clinging to. The large gnathopods are used for striking at and grasping both mobile and sessile prey. Known prey organisms of C.mutica include algae (both planktonic and macroalgae), dinoflagellates, hydrozoans, bryozoans, diatoms, copepods, brine shrimps, and other amphipods. They are capable of feeding on suspended organic particles, including fish feed and decaying organic matter. C.mutica are also known to engage in cannibalistic behavior on dead and dying individuals of their own species or genus.|$|E
5|$|Djedkare {{was buried}} in a pyramid in Saqqara named Nefer Djedkare ("Djedkare is perfect"), which is now ruined owing to theft of stone from its outer casing during antiquity. The burial chamber still held Djedkare's mummy when it was {{excavated}} in the 1940s. <b>Examinations</b> <b>of</b> the mummy revealed that he died in his fifties. Following his death, Djedkare was {{the object of a}} cult that lasted at least {{until the end of the}} Old Kingdom. He seemed to have been held in particularly high esteem during the mid-Sixth Dynasty, whose pharaohs lavished rich offerings on his cult. Archaeological evidence suggests the continuing existence of this funerary cult throughout the much later New Kingdom period (c. 1550–1077 BC). Djedkare was also remembered by the Ancient Egyptians as the king of vizier Ptahhotep, the purported author of The Maxims of Ptahhotep, one of the earliest pieces of philosophic wisdom literature.|$|E
