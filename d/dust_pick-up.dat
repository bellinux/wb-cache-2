5000|$|Heat {{exchange}} in a rotary kiln may be by conduction, convection and radiation, {{in descending order}} of efficiency. In low-temperature processes, and in the cooler parts of long kilns lacking preheaters, the kiln is often furnished with internal heat exchangers to encourage heat exchange between the gas and the feed. These may consist of scoops or [...] "lifters" [...] that cascade the feed through the gas stream, or may be metallic inserts that heat up in {{the upper part of}} the kiln, and impart the heat to the feed as they dip below the feed surface as the kiln rotates. The latter are favoured where lifters would cause excessive <b>dust</b> <b>pick-up.</b> The most common heat exchanger consists of chains hanging in curtains across the gas stream.|$|E
40|$|In {{my paper}} [l] {{of the above}} title, I {{referred}} to a preliminary draft of “Notes on Martian Yellow Clouds, ” by J. A. Ryan. This important paper has now been published [2]. Ryan’s paper contains a quite extensive treatment of the mechanics of sand and <b>dust</b> <b>pick-up</b> from IItLrs ’ surface, a subject that I also discussed more briefly. Ryan correctly points out that I used the critical Reynolds number for transition from smooth to turbulent flow around sand grains, Re= 3. 5, to calculate the threshold friction velocity, v*, for the initiation of sand motion, namely Re=v*(Ilv, equation (2) in my paper. I {{should point out that}} the actual value of Re used doesn’t alter the numerical values arrived at, and is not an essential assumption. What is essential is that, because of similarity of the two phenomena, particle motion at Rlars...|$|E
40|$|The loss of {{dust from}} the mining, processing, storage, handling, {{transportation}} and loading of bulk materials is creating {{an increasing number of}} problems for industry and the community. This includes loss of valuable material and export income, increasing workplace dust emissions (e. g. from mine sites, loading, receival, ports, bulk berths) and decreasing ambient air quality and human health, especially for nearby communities. It is virtually impossible to estimate the total cost of these problems to industry and the community. An initial key step in addressing dust problems is to quantify the dustiness or dustability of bulk materials. This paper examines three different methods for testing dustiness. The first two methods are the rotating drum style dustiness testers {{that can be used to}} determine the Dust Extinction Moisture (DEM) for a bulk solid. They are the Australian standard AS 4156. 6 2 ̆ 2 Determination of Dust/moisture Relationship for Coal [1] and the International standard I. S. EN 15051 2 ̆ 2 Measurement of the Dustiness of Bulk Materials - Requirements and Reference Test Methods 2 ̆ 2 [2]. The third method is simulating conveyor belt conditions in a wind tunnel to determine <b>dust</b> <b>pick-up</b> or lift-off velocity. All three methods can be useful tools in the design of new plant and also the modification of existing plant to reduce dust generation...|$|E
50|$|Non-stop winds on this ridge are {{concentrated}} and compressed {{at the top}} of the hill and are very fast as a result. These strong winds <b>pick-up</b> <b>dust</b> and sand (mostly from the two closest alluvial fans), which literally sand-blast exposed surfaces. Winds strong enough for sandblasting come from the north and the south.|$|R
40|$|In {{the plasma}} and {{radiation}} environment of space, small dust grains from the Moon s surface can become charged. This has the consequence that their motion {{is determined by}} electromagnetic as well as gravitational forces. The result is a plasma-like condition known as "dusty plasmas" with the consequence that lunar dust can migrate and be transported by magnetic, electric, and gravitational fields into places where heavier, neutral debris cannot. Dust on the Moon can exhibit unusual behavior, being accelerated into orbit by electrostatic surface potentials as blow-off dust, or being swept away by moving magnetic fields like the solar wind as <b>pick-up</b> <b>dust.</b> Hence, lunar dust must necessarily {{be treated as a}} dusty plasma subject to the physics of magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). A review of this subject has been given before [1], but a synopsis will be presented here to make it more readily available for lunar scientists...|$|R
40|$|Rotorcraft {{operating}} {{in ground effect}} {{have been known to}} experience beneficial performance effects as well as operational difficulties during low speed forward flight. While these have been attributed to the formation of the ground induced wake, limited experimental investigations of the wake have been conducted. Difficulties in re-creating representative forward flight ground boundary conditions in wind tunnels have meant a lack of quantitative information on the ground effect wake. This research is based on experimentally investigating the ground effect wakes of rotors in forward flight, to detail the fluid mechanics associated with the ground effect wake and to identify the influence of rotor parameters and ground boundary conditions on the formation of the ground effect wake. Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) tests were conducted on wide regions of the ground effect wake produced by a rotor model in a wind tunnel fitted with a moving ground. Results from this research showed the ground effect wake to consist of a flow separation boundary and a region of recirculation, formed by the rotor tip vortex system trailing along the ground plane. Unsteadiness of the wake was seen to result in a constantly evolving wake, and this was observed to affect the classification of the ground effect flow regimes. Flow visualisation experiments conducted on the brownout phenomenon showed the ground effect wake features to influence the <b>dust</b> <b>pick-up</b> and transport mechanisms involved in the dust cloud formation. Experimental testing showed rotor parameters such as collective angles, rotor trim settings, rotor ground distance and root cut-out ratios to cause insignificant changes to the fluid mechanics of the ground effect wake, affecting only the location of the wake features. Effects of ground boundary conditions on the ground effect wake fluid mechanics were observed to be most significant, affecting both the location and detailed structure of the wake features. Results from this research show that ground effect experimental testing can be conducted in the wind tunnel environment and highlight the importance of accurately representing the ground boundary conditions during ground effect experimental testing.
