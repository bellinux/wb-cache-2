Even if a child does not have beta thalassemia major, they can still be a carrier resulting in future offspring having beta thalassemia. Another risk factor is because of certain ancestry. Beta thalassemia occurs most often in people of Italian, Greek, Middle Eastern, Southern Asian, and African ancestry.|$|E

Recently, however, some have claimed that what you ought to believe <b>depends</b> not <b>on</b> <b>your</b> evidence but simply on what is true: you ought to believe (only) the truth. In this paper, we present and defend two arguments against this latter view.

25|$|It is {{interesting}} to note that, <b>depending</b> <b>on</b> <b>your</b> political point of view, such government payments for offsetting the housing charge could be considered a subsidy of the low-income members, or a contractual business arrangement {{between the government and the}} co-op, which helps to stabilize revenue to the co-op in exchange for accomplishing a social goal for the government for a specific period. This dichotomy is typical of the fact that a housing co-op is somewhere between a private business corporation and a social agency, and where one places it depends on one's viewpoint—and the collective viewpoint of each housing co-op. Some observers would now simply categorize these co-op as a form of social enterprise.|$|E

With MNIMN standing at a lean 12 songs, these missteps are hard to gloss over. Regardless, Pusha T accomplishes a lot here, crafting a record that is big in concept but is still rooted in the longstanding hip-hop tradition that lyricism is king." [...] Brandon Soderberg of Spin said, [...] "Don't tell King Push, but My Name Is My Name bears a weird resemblance to Drake's Nothing Was the Same: Here is another deeply considered collection of top-shelf beats and uncompromising-though-still-pop-enough raps that justifies the fairly awful personalities driving it, which, <b>depending</b> <b>on</b> <b>your</b> tolerance for wounded narcissism and a complete lack of insight, is either fascinating or frustrating." ...|$|E

According to writer Gary Younge of The Guardian, most of the essays [...] "end with the kind of wisdom that, <b>depending</b> <b>on</b> <b>your</b> taste, qualifies as either homespun or hokey". For example, she uses what has been called her most famous statement, when speaking of Cuban artist Celia Cruz: [...] "We are more alike than unalike". Although Angelou discounts the idea when he brings it up to her, Younge thinks Letter reads like an extended farewell; in her 500-word introduction she mentions death twice.|$|E
