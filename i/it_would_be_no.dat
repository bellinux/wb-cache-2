5|$|R.I.P. 35E {{and other}} citizens' groups {{continued}} to oppose a direct connection, arguing that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> {{different from a}} typical freeway, since drivers {{would be more likely}} to exceed the speed limit if it was a continuous roadway to I-94. Saint Paul changed its mind again in September 1981, supporting a direct connection, along with Mn/DOT and the Metropolitan Council. A bill passed in March 1982 removed the stipulation that the parkway shall not connect to I-94, and allowed Route390 (I-35E) to use Route382 (the parkway). The final EIS was approved at about that time, and several groups including R.I.P. 35E filed suit in early 1983.|$|E
5|$|The Mycenaean Greeks {{were also}} pioneers {{in the field}} of engineering, {{launching}} large-scale projects unmatched in Europe until the Roman period, such as fortifications, bridges, culverts, aqueducts, dams and roads suitable for wheeled traffic. They also made several architectural innovations, such as the relieving triangle. They were also responsible for transmitting a wide range of arts and crafts, especially of Minoan origin. The Mycenaean civilization was in general more advanced compared to the Late Bronze Age cultures of the rest of Europe. Several Mycenaean attributes and achievements were borrowed or held in high regard in later periods; so, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> exaggeration to consider Mycenaean Greece as a cradle of civilization.|$|E
5|$|A {{partial eclipse}} {{occurs when the}} Sun and Moon are not exactly {{in line with the}} Earth and the Moon only {{partially}} obscures the Sun. This phenomenon can usually be seen from {{a large part of the}} Earth outside of the track of an annular or total eclipse. However, some eclipses can only be seen as a partial eclipse, because the umbra passes above the Earth's polar regions and never intersects the Earth's surface. Partial eclipses are virtually unnoticeable in terms of the sun's brightness, as it takes well over 90% coverage to notice any darkening at all. Even at 99%, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> darker than civil twilight. Of course, partial eclipses (and partial stages of other eclipses) can be observed if one is viewing the sun through a darkening filter (which should always be used for safety).|$|E

Hence the Republican leadership's new willingness to pursue immigration reform, even if it angers the conservative base.|$|E
25|$|The state {{put down}} the rebellion—but {{if it had been}} too weak to do so <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> help to call on the {{ineffective}} federal government. The event led nationalists like George Washington to redouble efforts to strengthen the weak national government as necessary for survival in a dangerous world. Massachusetts, divided along class lines polarized by the rebellion, only narrowly ratified the United States Constitution in 1788.|$|E
25|$|During {{the period}} 1886–90, Parnell {{continued}} to pursue Home Rule, striving to reassure English voters that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> threat to them. In Ireland, unionist resistance (especially after the Irish Unionist Party was formed) became increasingly organised. Parnell pursued moderate and conciliatory tenant land purchase and still hoped {{to retain a}} sizeable landlord support for home rule. During the agrarian crisis, which intensified in 1886 and launched the Plan of Campaign organised by Parnell's lieutenants, he chose {{in the interest of}} Home Rule not to associate himself with it.|$|E

25|$|Now {{regarded}} as a classic film noir, The Maltese Falcon (1941) was John Huston's directorial debut. Originally a novel written by Dashiell Hammett, it {{was first published in}} the pulp magazine Black Mask in 1929, and had also served as the basis of two other movie versions including Satan Met a Lady (1936) starring Bette Davis. Producer Hal Wallis initially offered the leading man role to George Raft, a more established box office name than Bogart, whose contract stipulated {{he did not have to}} appear in remakes. Fearing <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> more than a cleaned-up version of the pre-Production Code The Maltese Falcon (1931), Raft turned it down in order to make Manpower with director Raoul Walsh and cast members Edward G. Robinson and Marlene Dietrich. Eagerly, Huston accepted Bogart as his Sam Spade.|$|E
25|$|After {{the peace}} {{concluded}} with China, the Burmese king sent another {{small army of}} 5,000 to attack Siam in 1774. But it was completely surrounded by the Thais at Bangkeo in Ratchaburi, and eventually starvation compelled the Burmese to capitulate to King Taksin. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> {{exaggeration to say that}} he could have massacred all of them if he wished to do so, but the fact that he took them alive was to promote the morale of the Thai people. The Burmese reinforcements who had encamped themselves in the province of Kanchanaburi were then mopped up. Undaunted by this defeat, King Hsinbyushin tried again to conquer Siam, and in October 1775 the greatest Burmese invasion in the Thonburi period began under Maha Thiha Thura, known in Thai history as Azaewunky. He had distinguished himself as a first rate general in the wars with China and in the suppression of a recent Peguan rising.|$|E

500|$|At {{the age of}} 10, Trenchard {{was sent}} to board at Allens Preparatory School near Botley in Hampshire. Although he did well at arithmetic, he {{struggled}} {{with the rest of}} the curriculum. [...] However, Trenchard's parents were not greatly concerned by his educational difficulties, believing that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> impediment to him following a military career. Georgina Trenchard wanted her son to follow her father's profession and enter the Royal Navy. In 1884, Trenchard was moved to Dover where he attended Hammond's, a cramming school for prospective entrants to HMS Britannia. Trenchard failed the Navy's entrance papers, and at the age of 13 he was sent to the Reverend Albert Pritchard's crammer, Hill Lands in Wargrave, Berkshire. [...] Hill Lands prepared its pupils for Army commissions and as before Trenchard did not apply himself to his studies, preferring sports (rugby in particular) and practical joking.|$|E
500|$|St. John was {{instructed}} by the show's directors to watch about fifteen episodes of Howarth's performances of Todd {{because they wanted}} him to portray Todd like Howarth did. St. John reported that he watched two episodes, but never tried to mimic Howarth's style because he felt that it was limiting, uncreative, and destructive. He said, [...] "I needed {{to get a sense of}} who Todd was first, and that has to happen organically." [...] He did not care if Marlon Brando portrayed the role before him, and said that even actors who portray Hamlet do it differently, adding, [...] "I don't care what the other guy did.

500|$|The {{accepted}} cover, {{designed by}} Aimee Macauley, features {{a photo of}} Nas as a child superimposed over a backdrop of a New York city block, taken by Danny Clinch. In a 1994 interview, Nas discussed the concept behind the photo of him at age 7, stating [...] "That was the year I started to acknowledge everything [...] That's the year everything set off. That's the year I started seeing the future for myself and doing what was right. The ghetto makes you think. The world is ours. I used to think I couldn't leave my projects.

The projects {{used to be my}} world until I educated myself to see there's more out there." [...] As yet, Nas has not pointed to any outside influence for the artwork of his album cover. Yet according to Ego Trip, the cover of Illmatic is [...] "reputedly" [...] believed to have been inspired by a jazz album, Howard Hanger Trio's A Child Is Born (1974) [...] whose cover also features a photograph of a child, superimposed on an urban landscape.|$|E

2500|$|Lula's {{second term}} {{was much more}} confident; Lula was then not only the undisputed master of popular affection, as the first {{president}} to bring a modest well-being to many people, but also in complete control of his own administration. His two leading ministers were gone. Palocci was no longer needed to calm the nerves of overseas investors and Lula had never liked and somewhat feared José Dirceu, a virtuoso of cold political calculation and intrigue. Their joint elimination freed Lula for sole command in Brasilia. When, midway through his second term its test came, he handled it with aplomb. The crash of Wall Street in 2008 might be a tsunami in the US and Europe, he declared, but in Brazil <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> {{more than a little}} 'ripple' ("uma marolinha"). The phrase was seized on by the Brazilian press as proof of reckless economic ignorance and irresponsibility. Lula proved that the media (PiG) was wrong.

2500|$|Parallel {{to these}} renewed efforts on The Ring was Wagner's {{work on a}} lengthy essay {{entitled}} Oper und Drama ("Opera and Drama"), which musicologist Deryck Cooke (1979) has described as, [...] "essentially a blueprint [...] ". Wagner's principal theoretical work, Oper und Drama {{grew out of a}} draft of an essay on Das Wesen der Oper ("The Essence of Opera"), which, preparatory to the composition of Siegfried's Tod, he wrote in an attempt [...] "to tidy up a whole life that now lay behind me, to articulate each half-formed intuition on a conscious level....". First mentioned in a letter to Theodor Uhlig on 20 September 1850, the work was begun by 9 October. Wagner, it seems, anticipated that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> longer than the other essays he had recently completed; but over the winter of 1850–1851, it grew into a book of some considerable size. Completed by 20 January 1851, just four months after Wagner conceived it, it was first published in 1852 by J. J. Weber of Leipzig. It was in the pages of Opera and Drama that Wagner's nebulous or half-conscious ideas on artistic method and the relationship between music and drama were first given concrete expression.|$|E
