Even though Scipio was elected consul for 205 BC, he had to endure hard political wrangling before the Senate approved his intentions. His main opponent was Quintus Fabius Maximus Cunctator (the <b>Delayer),</b> who argued that the expedition to Africa was too risky and that the primary objective was to fight Hannibal in Bruttium. Scipio managed to persuade the senators that his plan was the perfect way to force the Carthaginians out of Italy. Nevertheless, he was not given enough resources and had to spend a whole year in preparations.|$|E

40|$|Redundancy, <b>delayering,</b> downsizing, {{and various}} other forms of {{organizational}} change have become increasingly prevalent. This article focuses {{on the impact of}} different forms of organizational change on managers' perceptions of the organizations they work within and the comparison between changes that involve redundancy and/or <b>delayering</b> and those that do not involve such changes. The literature has many accounts of the negative effects associated with redundancy and <b>delayering,</b> but are these effects unique to these types of change or are they a consequence of negative experiences of a range of organizational changes? Hypotheses were tested to assess, first, whether there are differences between different levels of management, notably between directors and nondirectors in the way they perceive organizational change, second, to assess how change has affected managers' perceptions of their organizations and their working lives, and third, to explore if different forms of change are associated with differences in managers' perceptions of their organizations “as a place to work”. Hypotheses were tested with data from a cross-sectional survey with 830 managers from the UK. Organizational changes include cost reduction and culture change programmes, <b>delayering,</b> mergers/demergers, outsourcing, redundancy programmes, and contract/ temporary workers. The analyses reported here indicate clearly that specific forms of change are associated with managers' reports of their experiences at work; some forms of change (notably redundancy and <b>delayering)</b> seem to have particularly damaging implications for managers' experiences in the workplace. The analyses also show that there is a difference in the way directors and nondirectors perceive the changes.

500|$|Forty {{years after}} the first {{marshmallow}} test studies, neuroimaging data has shed light on the neural correlates of delayed gratification. A team led by B. J. Casey, of Cornell University, recruited 59 of the original participants – who are now in their mid-40s – and gave them a delayed gratification task. Instead of resisting marshmallows, these adults were instructed to suppress responses to images of happy faces, but not to neutral or fearful faces. Those who had been high <b>delayers</b> as pre-schoolers were more successful at controlling their impulses in response to the emotional faces (i.e., not pressing the button in response to happy faces), suggesting that the high <b>delayers</b> continued to show better ability to dampen or resist impulses. Casey and colleagues also scanned the brains of 26 participants using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) as they completed the task. The researchers hypothesized that high <b>delayers</b> {{would be more likely to}} use [...] "cool" [...] regulation strategies to control their responses, which would manifest as activation of the right prefrontal cortex, whereas low <b>delayers</b> would use [...] "hot" [...] strategies, which would activate the ventral striatum, an area also linked to addiction. Indeed, results showed this differential brain activity. This mirrors other fMRI research of delayed gratification conducted by Noah Shamosh and Jeremy Gray, of Yale University, demonstrating that individuals who chose larger delayed rewards over smaller immediate rewards (in hypothetical situations) showed greater brain activation in the anterior prefrontal cortex.|$|R

40|$|We {{examined}} the neural basis of self-regulation in individuals from {{a cohort of}} preschoolers who performed the delay-of-gratification task 4 decades ago. Nearly 60 individuals, now in their mid-forties, were tested on “hot” and “cool” versions of a go/nogo task to assess whether delay of gratification in childhood predicts impulse control abilities and sensitivity to alluring cues (happy faces). Individuals who were less able to delay gratification in preschool and consistently showed low self-control abilities in their twenties and thirties performed more poorly than did high <b>delayers</b> when having to suppress {{a response to a}} happy face but not to a neutral or fearful face. This finding suggests that sensitivity to environmental hot cues plays a significant role in individuals’ ability to suppress actions toward such stimuli. A subset of these participants (n = 26) underwent functional imaging {{for the first time to}} test for biased recruitment of frontostriatal circuitry when required to suppress responses to alluring cues. Whereas the prefrontal cortex differentiated between nogo and go trials to a greater extent in high <b>delayers,</b> the ventral striatum showed exaggerated recruitment in low <b>delayers.</b> Thus, resistance to temptation as measured originally by the delay-of-gratification task is a relatively stable individual difference that predicts reliable biases in frontostriatal circuitries that integrate motivational and control processes...|$|R
40|$|We {{typically}} {{judge that}} hasteners are causes {{of what they}} hasten, while <b>delayers</b> are not causes of what they delay.

Latent profile analysis based on 554 university students' reasons for academic delay revealed four distinct types: inconspicuous, successful pressure-seeking, worried/anxious, and discontent with studies. The types were validated with respect to variables associated with dilatory behavior (e. g., academic procrastination and academic performance). The inconspicuous and successful pressure-seeking types showed low academic procrastination and were not negatively affected by academic delay, whereas the worried/anxious and discontent with studies types showed high academic procrastination and were under psychological pressure. Thus, two types appeared to be purposeful <b>delayers</b> and two types appeared to be academic procrastinators. The deficiencies in self-regulation skills observed in the worried/anxious and discontent with studies types underpin the notion of academic procrastination as a failure in self-regulation. Interventions designed to overcome academic procrastination should address these skills and should be tailored to the type-specific reasons. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. ...|$|R
