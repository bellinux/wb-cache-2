2500|$|Independent Democrats leader Patricia de Lille, said Zuma {{was asking}} people [...] "to <b>do</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>say</b> {{and not as}} I do".|$|E
6000|$|... "Better <b>do</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>say.</b> Leave matters {{alone for}} the present. But mind! no speculating on my {{changing}} my intentions. I wont marry her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{certainly}} aren't much more. But {{that is not}} my reason. Never {{mind the}} reason. <b>Do</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>say</b> or do not go," [...] said Colonel Zane.|$|E
6000|$|... "Take a dozen men, Shandy, {{and search}} yon hellhole. Bring out to me, alive, Peter of Colfax, and My Lady's cloak and a palfrey--and Shandy, {{when all is}} <b>done</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>say,</b> you may apply the torch! But no looting, Shandy." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Because I don't {{trust your}} majesty," [...] replied the American. [...] "It must be <b>done</b> {{precisely}} <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>say</b> {{or not at}} all. Are you agreeable?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Leave {{the room}} at once," [...] I said. [...] "You can push the screen on one side, and you are within a yard of the door then. Please <b>do</b> exactly <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>say,</b> and don't reply." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I've an idea!" [...] exclaimed Dorothy. [...] "I'm no wizard, and no fairy, {{but if you}} <b>do</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>say,</b> we needn't fear {{these people}} at all." ...|$|E
6000|$|Pray for him, Monseigneur, [...] Morning {{and evening}} just the same! They plan [...] To take you off from me. But don't forget-- [...] <b>Do</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>say!</b> ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hush, lass! I'm {{not one to}} bless.... An' now {{you must}} <b>do</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>say.</b> Go home an' tell them you'll marry Jack in August. Say August thirteenth." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If you {{conclude}} {{to let me}} settle it, {{you must}} <b>do</b> just <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>say.</b> But <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not pretend that I have any right to decide such a case, unless you consent. So I will take you home, if you prefer." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I don't mind it!" [...] said Lillie. [...] "I {{shall have}} things my own way, I know. One isn't obliged {{to live in}} Springdale, nor with pokey old sisters, you know; and John will <b>do</b> just <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>say,</b> and live where I please." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I will do my best, heedin' not my own safety, givin' {{no thought}} to the labor or difficulties, if it so be you lads are minded to <b>do</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> shall <b>say,</b> without questionin' when it seems <b>as</b> if <b>I</b> might be goin' wrong--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{sometimes}} {{the truth will}} out in spite of one!" [...] Ah, yes, that's the worst of it. <b>Do</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>say,</b> not as I do. If possible, repress it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Do not apologize, Roberts; it {{was natural}} enough {{that you should be}} surprised. Well, you see I can <b>do</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>say.</b> We will now go on with our talk." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "See here, Peg. Don't {{talk back}} to me. <b>Do</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>say.</b> We'll peg a little nerve into this bunch. Now I'll go {{back of the}} plate and make a bluff." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Get out at once, Tuppence. Take {{her with}} you, and <b>do</b> just <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>say.</b> No one will do you any harm. You're safe. Take {{the train to}} London. Go {{straight}} to Sir James Peel Edgerton. Mr. Carter lives out of town, but you'll be safe with him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'He's very good-natured, my dear, and <b>as</b> he <b>does</b> not {{interfere}} with me, I don't interfere with him. <b>I</b> hope you'll <b>do</b> <b>as</b> well. <b>I</b> dare <b>say</b> Mr Brehgert is good-natured.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very well," [...] he said, [...] "I will <b>do</b> <b>as</b> you <b>say.</b> <b>I</b> {{will not}} go near your rooms. I will get you a few things somewhere to start with." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{have always}} obeyed me heretofore," [...] the captain said, quietly, [...] "and {{you will do}} so now. Go forward at once, and <b>do</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>say.</b> God bless you, my boy." ...|$|E
60|$|AUNT MARY (sternly). Agnes, <b>do</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>say.</b> [MRS. ROBERTS crouches down on {{the lower}} berth.] I don't choose that any member of my family shall witness my contortions. Don't you look.|$|E
6000|$|... "We'll not {{get caught}} if you'll <b>do</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>say.</b> Listen, Gus, {{all you need}} to do is to stand on guard, to give me warning if anybody comes. I'll do the rest." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, you see, Pip, {{and here}} we are! That's about where it lights; here we are! Now, when you take me in hand in my learning, Pip (and I tell you {{beforehand}} I am awful dull, most awful dull), Mrs. Joe mustn't see too much of what we're up to. It must be <b>done,</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> may <b>say,</b> on the sly. And why on the sly? I'll tell you why, Pip." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'That is true,' said Felix, {{not at all}} offended, 'and I had {{my father}} and Edgar; but indeed, Lance, nothing ever was so hard to me to <b>do</b> <b>as</b> this. <b>I</b> cannot <b>say</b> how sorry <b>I</b> am.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I don't see {{why they}} should be foolish. It is what we all must come to. Grown-up people <b>do,</b> <b>as</b> Lois <b>says.</b> <b>I</b> heard Aunt Ada going on ever so long about Beatrice Varley and that gentleman.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We shall see. But {{at present}} you must believe that I am right, and <b>do</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>say.</b> Mount that horse--I {{will help you}} if you are too weak--and--leave a space for me behind you!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Soup be damned! Ye've many a steak to {{eat with}} me, ye {{contrary}} little baboon. 'Tis a pity if I can't do as I like with me own. <b>Do</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>say,</b> and be gay." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If you <b>do</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>say,</b> I won't tell anybody," [...] Janet replied, in that odd, impersonal tone {{her voice}} had acquired. [...] "You must write me as soon--as soon as it is over. Do you understand?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, it must {{be right}} for you to <b>do</b> <b>as</b> you <b>say.</b> <b>I</b> shall be very happy when I hear that you have made your value felt. But you must have patience. It will perhaps be a long while." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No--and {{she will}} not forget her rank and her money; for that must now be hers. Julia can be quite as hard and as {{stubborn}} as he can. But <b>I</b> <b>did</b> write <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>say,</b> and <b>I</b> think {{that if she had}} got my letter before she had written herself, she would perhaps have stayed. But here is a letter from her, declaring that she will come at once. She will be starting almost as soon as my letter gets there, and I am sure {{she will not}} alter her purpose now." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>do</b> not, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>say,</b> {{suppose that}} Buck, whose forte was action rather than brain-work, had thought all this out. He had trusted to luck, and luck had stood by him. There {{would be no}} raising of the {{countryside}} in his case. On the contrary, I could see Mr Abney {{becoming one of the}} busiest persons on record in his endeavour to hush the thing up and prevent it getting into the papers. The man with the pistol spoke. He sighted me--I was standing with my back to the mantelpiece, parallel with the door--made a sharp turn, and raised his weapon.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then let me <b>do</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>say.</b> Why {{should you}} throw away a chance, {{even if it}} be a bad one? But here the chance is all in your favour. Let me manage it for you at Barchester." ...|$|E
6000|$|The old man stamped {{his foot}} angrily. [...] "Come here, as I tell you," [...] he repeated. [...] "If {{you do not}} <b>do</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>say</b> you shall not {{accompany}} the ape to Dover--I will take no chances upon his escaping." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do not {{threaten}} me," [...] he said. [...] "You {{should know better}} than that. You should know exactly of how much account I hold my life {{when it comes to}} a question of adding to the sum of human knowledge. I shall <b>do</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>say.</b> My decision is unalterable." ...|$|E
6000|$|Calvin spoke up. [...] "I reckon the Major's right, sheriff. How ye goin' {{to arrest}} a man if you don't {{know who he}} is? I reckon you better <b>do</b> <b>as</b> he <b>says.</b> <b>I</b> ain't a-lookin' fer no fuss with the agent, and the United States army only fifty miles off." ...|$|R
6000|$|Soon {{after this}} George bade him good-night and went away. The {{next day he}} told Egbert not to be {{discouraged}} at his not having yet learned to obey. [...] "There are a great many boys older than you," [...] he said, [...] "who have not learned this lesson; but you will learn in time. I can't go a-fishing with you, or undertake any other great expeditions, till I find I can trust you entirely to <b>do</b> exactly <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>say</b> in cases where I {{have a right to}} decide; but you will learn before long, and then we can do a great many things together which we can not do now." ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{poor girl}} clung to him harder still, with a ghastly shudder. [...] "Oh, it's terrible, terrible," [...] she cried, turning deadly pale. Then, {{after a short}} pause, she added, [...] "But I would rather have it so. <b>Do</b> <b>as</b> you <b>say.</b> <b>I</b> could bear it from you. Promise me that, rather than that those creatures should kill me." ...|$|R
