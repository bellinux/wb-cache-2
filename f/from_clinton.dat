5|$|Even before Cornwallis's {{surrender}} in October, Benedict Arnold {{had requested}} permission <b>from</b> <b>Clinton</b> {{to go to}} England to give Lord George Germain his thoughts {{on the war in}} person. When word of the surrender reached New York, Arnold renewed the request, which Clinton then granted. On December 8, 1781, Arnold and his family left New York for England.|$|E
5|$|DiBiase {{was born}} in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and was raised in Clinton, Mississippi. He knew fellow {{professional}} wrestler Christie Ricci as a child, as they attended a Sunday school class together. He graduated <b>from</b> <b>Clinton</b> High School in 2001. At Clinton, DiBiase was the football team's starting quarterback. He enrolled at Mississippi College in Clinton and was a starting wide receiver for Mississippi College's football team before leaving the squad following his freshman season. He also played soccer in college, and received awards in both sports. He graduated in 2005 with a Bachelor of Science and Bachelor of Business Administration. During his time in college, DiBiase considered becoming a minister.|$|E
5|$|On October 10, the Americans {{spotted a}} large house in Yorktown. Believing that Cornwallis might be {{stationed}} there, they aimed {{at it and}} quickly destroyed it. Cornwallis sank {{more than a dozen}} of his ships in the harbor. The French began to fire at the British ships and scored a hit on the British HMS Charon, which caught fire, and in turn set two or three other ships on fire. Cornwallis received word <b>from</b> <b>Clinton</b> that the British fleet was to depart on October 12, however Cornwallis responded by saying {{that he would not be}} able to hold out for long.|$|E

5|$|The British gave Benedict Arnold a brigadier general's commission, with {{an annual}} income of several hundred pounds, but paid him only £6,315 plus an annual pension of £360 because his plot had failed. In December 1780, Arnold led a force of 1,600 troops into Virginia under orders <b>from</b> <b>Clinton,</b> where he {{captured}} Richmond by surprise {{and then went on}} a rampage through Virginia, destroying supply houses, foundries, and mills. This activity brought out Virginia's militia, led by Colonel Sampson Mathews, and Arnold eventually retreated to Portsmouth to either be evacuated or reinforced.|$|E
5|$|Cornwallis {{pulled back}} from all of his outer defenses, except for the Fusilier's redoubt {{on the west side}} of the town and redoubts 9 and 10 in the east. Cornwallis had his forces occupy the {{earthworks}} immediately surrounding the town because he had received a letter <b>from</b> <b>Clinton</b> that promised relief force of 5,000 men within a week and he wished to tighten his lines. The Americans and the French occupied the abandoned defenses and began to establish their own batteries there. With the British outer defenses in their hands, allied engineers began to lay out positions for the artillery. The men improved their works and deepened their trenches. The British also worked on improving their defenses.|$|E
5|$|The race {{began in}} November 1998 when four-term {{incumbent}} New York Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan announced his retirement. Both the Democratic Party and Republican Party sought high-profile candidates {{to compete for}} the open seat. By early 1999 Clinton and Mayor of New York City Rudolph Giuliani were the likely respective nominees. Clinton and her husband, President Bill Clinton, purchased a house in Chappaqua, New York, in September 1999; she thereby became eligible for the election, although she faced characterizations of carpetbagging since she had never resided in the state before. The lead in statewide polls swung <b>from</b> <b>Clinton</b> to Giuliani and back to Clinton as the campaigns featured both successful strategies and mistakes as well as dealing with current events. In late April and May 2000, Giuliani's medical, romantic, marital, and political lives all collided in a tumultuous four-week period, culminating in his withdrawing from the race on May 19.|$|E

25|$|On March 21, former primary {{candidate}} Bill Richardson, who {{has previously}} held important {{posts in the}} Clinton Administration, endorsed Barack Obama, a move that drew intense criticism <b>from</b> <b>Clinton</b> allies, including James Carville's Eastertime comparison of Richardson with Judas Iscariot.

25|$|As the Franco-American army {{approached}} Cornwallis at Yorktown, he made {{no attempt}} to sally out and engage before siege lines could be erected, despite the repeated urging of his subordinate officers. Expecting relief to soon arrive <b>from</b> <b>Clinton,</b> Cornwallis prematurely abandoned all of his outer defences, which were then promptly occupied by the besiegers, serving to hasten the British defeat. These factors contributed to the eventual surrender of Cornwallis' entire army, and the end of major operations in North America.|$|E
25|$|The Clinton {{health care}} plan remains the most {{prominent}} national proposal associated with Hillary Clinton and may have influenced her prospects in the 2008 presidential election. There are some similarities between Clinton's plan and Republican Mitt Romney's {{health care plan}}, which has been implemented in Massachusetts, though Romney has since distanced himself <b>from</b> <b>Clinton</b> on the issue, in particular arguing that his plan calls for more control {{at the state level}} and the private market, not from the federal government.|$|E
25|$|On 17 August an {{additional}} motorbus service was commenced <b>from</b> <b>Clinton</b> Street to Sneinton Dale. The decision to operate followed an application {{by a local}} operator to run a similar service. A 30-minute headway was operated at off-peak periods, increased to 15 minutes at peak periods. In September, an alternative service to Beeston was instituted via University Boulevard. In view of the operation of motorbuses along Hucknall Lane and to Beeston, powers in respect of tramway operation along these routes were allowed to lapse.|$|E

25|$|A {{detailed}} analysis of voting demographics revealed that Perot's support drew heavily from across the political spectrum, with 20% of his votes coming from self-described liberals, 27% from self-described conservatives, and 53% coming from self-described moderates. Economically, however, the majority of Perot voters (57%) were middle class, earning between $15,000 and $49,000 annually, with {{the bulk of the}} remainder drawing from the upper middle class (29% earning more than $50,000 annually). Exit polls also showed that Ross Perot drew 38% of his vote from Bush, and 38% of his vote <b>from</b> <b>Clinton,</b> though it's generally considered that he aided Clinton in defeating Bush.|$|E
25|$|On September 28, the Franco-American army laid siege to Yorktown. Believing relief <b>from</b> <b>Clinton</b> was imminent, Cornwallis prematurely {{abandoned}} {{all of his}} outer defences, {{which were}} then occupied by the Franco-American troops, serving to hasten his subsequent defeat. A British attempt {{to break out of}} the siege across the river at Gloucester Point failed when a storm hit. Under increasing bombardment and with dwindling supplies, Cornwallis and his subordinates agreed their situation was untenable, and negotiated a surrender on October 17. Some 7,685 soldiers became prisoners of the Franco-American army. The same day as the surrender, 6,000 troops under Clinton had departed New York, sailing to relieve Yorktown.|$|E
25|$|Coulter later {{stated that}} she would come to mistrust the motives of Jones' head lawyer, Joseph Cammaratta, who by August or September 1997 was advising Jones that her case was weak and to settle, if a {{favorable}} settlement could be negotiated. From the outset, Jones had sought an apology <b>from</b> <b>Clinton</b> at least as eagerly as she sought a settlement. However, in a later interview Coulter recounted that she herself had believed that the case was strong, that Jones was telling the truth, that Clinton should be held publicly accountable for his misconduct, and that a settlement would {{give the impression that}} Jones was merely interested in extorting money from the President.|$|E
