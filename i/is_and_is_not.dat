5|$|Like humans, {{but unlike}} most other mammals, guinea pigs cannot {{synthesize}} their own vitamin C and must obtain this vital nutrient from food. If guinea pigs do not ingest enough vitamin C, they can suffer from potentially fatal scurvy. Guinea pigs require about 10mg of vitamin C daily (20mg if pregnant), {{which can be}} obtained through fresh, raw fruits and vegetables (such as broccoli, apple, cabbage, carrot, celery, and spinach) or through dietary supplements. Healthy diets for guinea pigs require a complex balance of calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, and hydrogen ions; adequate amounts of vitamins E, A, and D are also necessary. Imbalanced diets {{have been associated with}} muscular dystrophy, metastatic calcification, difficulties with pregnancy, vitamin deficiencies, and teeth problems. Guinea pigs tend to be fickle eaters when it comes to fresh fruits and vegetables, having learned early in life what <b>is</b> <b>and</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> appropriate to consume, and their habits are difficult to change after maturity. They do not respond well to sudden changes in diet; they may stop eating and starve rather than accept new food types. A constant supply of hay or other food is generally recommended, as guinea pigs feed continuously and may develop habits such as chewing on their own hair if food is not present. Because guinea pigs' teeth grow constantly, they routinely , lest their teeth become too large for their mouths, a common problem in rodents. Guinea pigs also chew on cloth, paper, plastic, and rubber.|$|E
5|$|Thus, Palmer {{argues that}} humans are not {{normally}} required to aid wild animals in need. The philosopher Joel MacClellan, a critic of intervention, challenges Palmer on three grounds: first, {{he says that the}} difference between our obligations to domestic and wild animals in Palmer's thought experiments could be justified on scientific, rather than moral, grounds; second, he challenges Palmer's characterisation of wildness as a relationship, rather than a capacity, arguing that a description of an animal as wild likely conveys that the animal has certain capacities lacked by domestic animals; and, third, he suggests that just as a utilitarian approach to wild animal suffering may demand too much, Palmer's contextual approach may permit too much, by allowing the policing of nature. The affinities between utilitarian and contextualist approaches, MacClellan argues, come from their shared idea of what <b>is</b> <b>and</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> valuable. The pro-intervention philosopher Catia Faria criticises Palmer's argument from the other direction. Faria challenges Palmer's account by pointing to the counter-intuitive conclusions it would reach, Faria claims, in cases of assisting humans with whom an individual does not have significant relationships. Unless Palmer is willing to deny that humans have obligations to help suffering distant humans, Faria argues, the account cannot justify not aiding animals.|$|E

2500|$|The {{period in}} which salons were {{dominant}} has been labeled the 'age of conversation'. The topics of conversation within the salons - that <b>is,</b> what <b>was</b> <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> 'polite' to talk about - are thus vital when trying to determine {{the form of the}} salons. The salonnières were expected, ideally, to run and moderate the conversation (See Women in the salon). There is, however, no universal agreement among historians as to what <b>was</b> <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> appropriate conversation. Marcel Proust 'insisted that politics was scrupulously avoided'. Others suggested that little other than government was ever discussed. [...] The disagreements that surround the content of discussion partly explain why the salon's relationship with the public sphere is so heavily contested. Oppositional politics were frowned upon within the salon, thus whether the salons can be classed as within the public sphere is debatable.|$|R
25|$|In theory, {{sales tax}} is {{normally}} charged on end users (consumers). The VAT mechanism {{means that the}} end-user tax {{is the same as}} it would be with a sales tax. The main disadvantage of VAT is the extra accounting required by those {{in the middle of the}} supply chain; this is balanced by the simplicity of not requiring a set of rules to determine who <b>is</b> <b>and</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> considered an end user. When the VAT system has few, if any, exemptions such as with GST in New Zealand, payment of VAT is even simpler.|$|E

A CD-R recorder included as part of a personal computer would not be a digital audio recording device under the Act, since the personal computer was not marketed primarily for making copies of music.

25|$|The early nineties {{were a very}} chaotic, but {{exciting}} and optimistic era in terms of comics. Because no one was told what <b>is</b> <b>and</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> to be published, many saw great opportunities in releasing comics. In these years a large variety of comics came into the country (not as direct import, but {{in the form of}} translations): all kinds of European, American comics. Although most companies were full of enthusiasm, but only few were strong in capital. In the meantime, the whole newspaper and magazine distribution system went through major changes, leaving magazines in a worse situation. Magazine print numbers dropped by 1 or 2 orders of magnitude. Therefore, most of them disappeared after a few months or years. By 1992 such great series as Menő Manó (Italian comics for teenage readers), Krampusz (Italian comics for adult readers), Hepiend Magazin (Conan, Punisher), Vampi (European and American horror, fantasy, erotic comics) vanished. Besides the inexperience of the small publishing companies, the comics-reading audience might not have been ready for these type of comics. In many cases their true value was only discovered in recent years.|$|E
500|$|On 18 March, {{the three}} {{opposition}} parties united {{in a bid}} to force the government to let them look at uncensored documents on the Afghan detainees affair or face parliamentary contempt proceedings.

500|$|Spiegelman {{suffers from}} a lazy eye, and thus lacks depth perception. [...] He says his art style is [...] "really a result of [...] deficiencies". [...] His is a style of labored simplicity, with dense visual motifs which often go unnoticed upon first viewing. [...] He sees comics as [...] "very {{condensed}} thought structures", more akin to poetry than prose, which need careful, time-consuming planning that their seeming simplicity belies.Spiegelman's work prominently displays his concern with form, and pushing the boundaries of what <b>is</b> <b>and</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> comics. [...] Early in the underground comix era, Spiegelman proclaimed to Robert Crumb, [...] "Time is an illusion that can be shattered in comics! [...] Showing the same scene from different angles freezes it in time by turning the page into a diagram—an orthographic projection!" [...] His comics experiment with time, space, recursion, and representation. [...] He uses the word [...] "decode" [...] to express the action of reading comics and sees comics as functioning best when expressed as diagrams, icons, or symbols.|$|E

500|$|The {{analogy of}} games– most {{commonly}} associated with Ludwig Wittgenstein– has been proposed {{as a way of}} establishing meaning in religious language. The theory asserts that language must be understood in terms of a game: just as each game has its own rules determining what can and cannot be done, so each context of language has its own rules determining what <b>is</b> <b>and</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> meaningful. Religion is classified as a possible and legitimate language game which is meaningful within its own context. Various parables have also been proposed {{to solve the problem of}} meaning in religious language. R. M. Hare used his parable of a lunatic to introduce the concept of [...] "bliks"– unfalsifiable beliefs according to which a worldview is established– which are not necessarily meaningless. Basil Mitchell used a parable to show that faith can be logical, even if it seems unverifiable. John Hick used his parable of the Celestial City to propose his theory of eschatological verification, the view that if there is an afterlife, then religious statements will be verifiable after death.|$|E
500|$|According to Dean Biron of Overland, [...] "Nightcrawler is a {{shattering}} {{critique of}} both modern-day media practice and consumer culture." [...] Throughout the film, Nina sensationalizes news headlines {{in an attempt}} to increase viewership. PopMatters Jon Lisi believes that, because of Nina's actions, the film specifically targets journalists who exaggerate headlines in order to combat a decline in viewership. Ed Rampell of The Progressive offers similar commentary, stating: [...] "Nightcrawler contends that ethnic and class biases are used to determine what <b>is,</b> <b>and</b> <b>is</b> <b>not,</b> deemed 'worthy' of news coverage. Local politics and related matters that actually affect viewers' lives get short shrift." [...] As much as the film indicts modern journalism, Nightcrawler director Dan Gilroy noted that his goal was for audiences to realize that by watching sensationalized news stories, they themselves are encouraging unethical journalism. Biron argues that Lou's character in the film is created because of consumer demand, and that he is a [...] "reflection of the symbiotic relationship between commercial imperatives and audience desire". Some critics argue that Nightcrawler {{is not so much a}} critique of journalism, but instead a depiction of Lou's entitlement.|$|E
