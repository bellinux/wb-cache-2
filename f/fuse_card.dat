50|$|Here, {{players can}} change around their Cards {{that they would}} like to use in their deck when playing battles and matches. A deck must be at least 25 cards. Players can also upgrade their cards using Giggitywatts giving them better stats or more abilities. Unwanted cards can be placed in the 'Recycle' section to trade in for 'Giggitywatts'. The player can also <b>fuse</b> <b>cards</b> by max {{upgrading}} two of the same card, making a stronger version of that card.|$|R
40|$|Abstract â€” <b>Fused</b> Identity <b>card</b> aims to {{make the}} process of {{identification}} of an individual easier. It is a Web Based Solution for an employer to find the employees of the required profile. Employer looks at the fused ids of the employees and analyzes them for interpretation. Using this we can get various useful information about an employee working within an organization such as the information access rights, Designation, certifications experience {{and the number of}} years spend by him/her working in the same post without having any written data using color coding, along with the information which we obtain from a basic identity card like name, photo identification...|$|R
50|$|The Nothing and the nameless <b>card</b> <b>fuse</b> into one, {{becoming}} the Hope Card as Sakura tearfully confesses to Syaoran. She is shocked when he replies {{that he feels}} the same, discovering that the fusion averted the toll. The Nothing's powers are then reversed, reviving Tomoeda and its inhabitants. Sakura springs across the reforming clock tower to Syaoran's arms, together at last.|$|R
5|$|Talking to a demon has {{different}} effects {{based on its}} personality, responding in a specific way to certain actions. There are four emotional responses that the player can elicit from a demon: anger, fear, joy, and interest. Triggering one of these emotions three times will cause the demon to perform an action: an angry demon will attack the party, a frightened demon will flee the battle, a joyful demon will give the player an item, and an interested demon will either leave the battle, give the player an item, or give the player a special spell card (tarot cards aligned with a particular Persona family or Arcanum). Functions related to the customization of Personas are performed in a special place called the Velvet Room: there, the character Igor can summon new Personas from among the various enemies defeated for a fee. He can also use two spell cards along with a special item {{to create a new}} Persona, which can inherit skills from the Personas used in the fusion. A Persona can only be <b>fused</b> using <b>cards</b> from certain Persona families. Personas can also be deleted if the player so chooses.|$|R
50|$|The children's unusual psionic {{and mental}} {{abilities}} and Emma's attachment to Mimzy alert their parents, especially their mother, and Larry White, Noah's science schoolteacher, to the devices. Later, Noah accidentally <b>fuses</b> the <b>card</b> {{with a blue}} blob, {{turning it into a}} Generator that causes a power black-out over half the state of Washington, alerting the FBI to their activities. The family is held for questioning by Special Agent Nathaniel Broadman (Michael Clarke Duncan), and it is revealed that Mimzy is actually a highly advanced form of artificial life utilizing nanotechnology created by Intel. Emma tells everyone that Mimzy has a message from humanity's distant future. She explains that pollution has corrupted humanity's DNA, and many rabbits like Mimzy have been sent to the past, since no natural life forms can survive time travel, but none have successfully returned. Mimzy is the last one remaining, but is now dying. The reason for the other Mimzys' deaths is that the Chosen Ones before Emma had no Engineers (like Noah) to help build the bridge across time. Mimzy explains to Emma that she and Noah must use the toys as a time machine to return it to the future with uncorrupted 21st century human DNA, which the people of the future can use to correct the damage to their DNA caused by ecological problems.|$|R
50|$|During battles, {{players can}} {{converse}} with most enemies: {{depending on which}} character talks with which enemy, they will trigger a different response. If the enemy is talked with in the right way, they will leave either items or spell cards (tarot cards linked to a certain Arcanum or Persona family group), items used to summon new Personas: certain cards give access to different Persona family groups. After a Persona is summoned and assigned to a character, that character's stats and abilities change. Active Personas can also be <b>fused</b> with spell <b>cards</b> to create more powerful versions. These Persona summonings and fusions {{take place in the}} Velvet Room, a special location separate {{from the rest of the}} game's environments. In addition to pre-set spell cards, the player can also obtain blank skill cards by forming contracts with enemies through the right conversation. These blank skill cards can be tailored to fit a chosen Persona family.|$|R
500|$|To get a {{new version}} of Spider-Man as a [...] "card", players can use their vials or ISO-8 to open portals to an {{alternate}} dimension from which a randomly selected Spider-Man arrives. Each card can be leveled up and has a star rating called the level cap. To level up a card, players can earn experience points during a run. A card can also be sacrificed to level up another, and by <b>fusing</b> two equal <b>cards,</b> players can increase a card's level cap. By using vials, which usually gives players a 3- or 4-star character, players have a small chance of acquiring a rare version of Spider-Man, while ISO-8 ensures they get a rare one. Each card has a score multiplier that is raised once a Spider is leveled up and a special ability. For example, Spider-Armor increases by 30% the score earned by running. Each card occupies a character slot, of which six are available. Players can unlock slots by completing an issue, or can buy it using vials and, as the price increases, ISO-8s.|$|R
40|$|We have {{identified}} and characterized ARC, apoptosis repressor with caspase recruitment domain (CARD). Sequence {{analysis revealed that}} ARC contains an N-terminal <b>CARD</b> <b>fused</b> to a C-terminal region rich in proline/glutamic acid residues. The CARD domain of ARC exhibited significant homology to the prodomains of apical caspases and the CARDs present in the cell death regulators Apaf- 1 and RAIDD. Immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that ARC interacts with caspase- 2, - 8, and Caenorhabditis elegans CED- 3, but not with caspase- 1, - 3, or - 9. ARC inhibited apoptosis induced by caspase- 8 and CED- 3 but not that mediated by caspase- 9. Further analysis showed that the enzymatic activity of caspase- 8 was inhibited by ARC in 293 T cells. Consistent with the inhibition of caspase- 8, ARC attenuated apoptosis induced by FADD and TRADD and that triggered by stimulation of death receptors coupled to caspase- 8, including CD 95 /Fas, tumor necrosis factor-R 1, and TRAMP/DR 3. Remarkably, the expression of human ARC was primarily restricted to skeletal muscle and cardiac tissue. Thus, ARC represents an inhibitor of apoptosis expressed in muscle that appears to selectively target caspases. Delivery of ARC by gene transfer or enhancement of its endogenous activity may provide a strategy {{for the treatment of}} diseases that are characterized by inappropriately increased cell death in muscle tissue...|$|R
