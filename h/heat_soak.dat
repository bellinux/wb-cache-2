50|$|Thermal soak {{is a part}} {{of almost}} all TPS schemes. For example, an {{ablative}} heat shield loses most of its thermal protection effectiveness when the outer wall temperature drops below the minimum necessary for pyrolysis. From that time {{to the end of the}} heat pulse, heat from the shock layer convects into the heat shield's outer wall and would eventually conduct to the payload.

50|$|Centrifugal superchargers are {{typically}} mounted {{off to the}} side {{on the front of the}} engine.

By comparison, a twin screw or roots blower which is nested in the center (valley) of the engine, will absorb heat (<b>heat</b> <b>soak)</b> during operation due to thermal transfer from the engine block and heads. Elevated temperature levels in the supercharger directly influence discharge air temperatures that next enter the engine. Higher engine inlet air temperatures result in reduced power increases and an increased likelihood of engine damage resulting from detonation within the cylinders.|$|E

30|$|Application Various {{heavy oil}} {{components}} {{of interest to}} the petroleum industry become accessible if they are produced exploiting more than merely the heating properties of hot water. The sources include oil sands, kerogenic deposits (“oil shales”) and indeed normal oil reservoirs with high viscosity oils. The enablers are the properties of near critical water: enhanced solubility and higher cracking potential due to higher water dissociation near the critical point. The optimum points of operation are not the same for the solubilisation and cracking processes. Whereas many oil shales schemes require long term <b>heat</b> <b>soaking</b> to stimulate and simulate the maturation associated with traditional catagenesis, exploitation of the enhanced properties associated with near critical water indicate that judicious p, T operation would achieve this with shorter times and lower energy inputs. This may enable increased efficiency of operation and yields from many more reservoirs than are currently considered viable.|$|R

50|$|The car by {{then became}} known as RHAM/1 (its chassis number, Robin Hamilton Aston Martin #1) as it was unrecognisable from the {{original}} car. RHAM/1 made its debut at the Silverstone Six Hours a pre event to the Le Mans race, on 15 May 1977.

5000|$|Unique tower {{envelope}} made of cold-bent glass {{emphasizes the}} lightness and {{dynamic of the}} form visually denying the gravity force. Two hundred meters high sculpture, crafted of materials traditionally believed to be fragile and inflexible, symbolizes the idea of evolution spiral as the pinnacle of progress {{and the power of}} human intellect, challenging the forces of nature and the laws of physics. Original façade concept and innovative construction technology allow to create visually organic and flowing 3D form. Double curved tower envelope is provided by the cold bending of reflective glass units. The innovative cold-bent glazing in the curtain wall uses flat double glazed units cold-formed in 3D within the aluminum frame to avoid stepping in geometry. This approach appeared to be both more energy-efficient and more cost-efficient solution in comparison to the stepped curtain wall units previously applied in some twisted unitized facades. During factory fabrication the glass unit is placed in the twisted aluminum frame horizontally and then takes curved shape by its own weight without any thermal treatment. Maximum corner deformation does not exceed 50 mm relative to the opposite corner of the unit. Finally façade looks like continuously twisted spiral glass surface. Currently this curtain wall is the world’s largest cold bent façade in terms of the area in one building. Organic cold-bent glazed ribbon with constant leaning angle at the corners (approx. 14 degrees vertically) creates a stunning optical illusion reflecting the surrounding cityscape vertically with 90-degree twist.Evolution tower total façade area is 40,500 sq m, including 34,500 sq m of the typical facade areas from 3-rd to 51-st level. On each floor the curtain wall consists of 108 parallelogram façade panels 4.3 m high and 1.5m wide. 27 of them have 2 types of different sizes that vary with twist angle from +14 to -14 that largely complicated the construction logistics. However the implementation of this façade structure was successful due to involvement of German façade company Joseph Gartner (Permasteelisa Group) in design and production of tower curtain wall, atrium glazing and canopies /entrances. The company was selected through the tender with 30 façade manufacturers competing for a prestigious contract. The aluminum profiles were extruded in Russia at a specially arranged production line. Despite glass units fabrication in Germany with all associated delivery and customs duties the overall façade cost per m2 remained within the budget of a ‘standard’ benchmark high-rise tower, that was an achievement of German logistics. Double glazed units with energy-efficient multi-functional glass (manufactured by Guardian) provide the energy efficiency and thermal insulation parameters (U-Value) similar to those of standard triple glazed units but with less weight in panoramic floor to ceiling application. The units themselves were assembled in Germany by BGT, who provided long-time warranty for cold bent heat-strengthened glass in a result of multiple tests. Transparent double glazed units consist of triplex 8+6mm from heat-strengthened glass from the outside and 8mm Guardian Standard HP Neutral 60/40 tempered glass on the inside with application of energy efficient coating, significantly reducing the solar gain whilst providing the double glazed unit thermal performance equal to a standard triple glazed unit normally used in Moscow to withstand harsh winter conditions. Guardian SunGuard production technology allows to create almost perfect combination of transparent and spandrel façade areas. Guardian magnetron coating has a special feature - it is colored outside and transparent on the inside, which does not distort the view color unlike tinted glass in mass. With no color filter (color is from the coating, not from coloured glass) the high color quality provides comfortable environment inside the building given that the glass panel is 3m high (floor to ceiling) the perfect daylighting is provided in the office spaces. Glass unit formula with heat-strengthened triplex outside and tempered glass inside allows bending of the unit in installation position to achieve required façade geometry providing additional safety of envelope structure , as in case of destruction the tempered glass (5 times stronger than usual) is fractured in small pieces and triplex lamination film protects it from falling out. Heat strengthened glass triplex gains additional strength and reduces the risk of glass destruction via associated <b>heat</b> <b>soak</b> tests as part of the production process.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of the present research {{is to develop a}} method for inhibition of damaged cooked rice (DCR) by using vacuum infusion technique, <b>heated</b> water <b>soaking,</b> and tempering treatment. Firstly, open cracked rice (OCR) grains were sorted by crack direction, then a composition rate of DCR grain, included in cooked rice was measured. As a result, transverse and longitudinal cracked grains were derived from the OCR grain. In addition, it was suggested that unevenness of water distribution within soaked rice kernel caused a difference in swelling distribution between central part and periphery of the kernel, according generated it flatly-broadened grain. Secondly, the composition rate of DCR grain in milled rice with low moisture content was measured for each treatment. As a result, the tempering treatment clearly inhibited to generate flatly-broadened grain, and vacuum infusion combined with processes of <b>heated</b> water <b>soaking</b> and tempering suppressed to generate transverse and longitudinal cracked grain. Finally, the hardness, stickiness and balance of cooked rice were measured. The value of balance for the treatment of vacuum infusion combined with <b>heated</b> water <b>soaking</b> and tempering which is positive by correlating with eating quality was the highest among all treatments, so it appeared that this treatment maintained the eating quality of low moisture content rice. Therefore, tempering treatment was considered as the best way for keeping the appearance and eating quality of low moisture content rice. Further experiment for investigating the optimization of tempering condition and finding the generation mechanism of flatly-broadened grain by using a morphologic approach is needed. 本研究は，減圧含浸処理に温水浸潰処理とテンパリング処理を組み合わせて低水分白米に施し，炊飯崩壊粒の発生を抑制することを目的とした．まず，浸漬後の白米を裂傷の有無および裂傷の方向別に分類して炊飯した際の炊飯米の形状別の構成割合を測定した．その結果，横割れ炊飯粒および縦割れ炊飯粒の多くは水浸裂傷粒から発生し，また，扁平炊飯粒は，炊飯直前の米粒中心部における水分不足によって炊飯時に米粒部位による膨潤率の差が生じ，変形を引き起こしたものと推察された．次に，減圧含浸処理に温水浸漬およびテンパリングを組み合わせて低水分白米を調製した後，炊飯して得られた炊飯米の形状別の構成割合を測定した．その結果テンパリング処理は扁平炊飯粒の抑制効果があり，また，減圧含浸と温水浸漬の組み合わせ処理により横割れ炊飯粒および縦割れ炊飯粒の抑制効果が見られた．最後に，低水分米にそれぞれの処理を施した後の炊飯米の硬さおよび粘りを測定し，バランス度を算出した．その結果，食味と正の相関があるバランス度が，最も高い値を示したのはテンパリング区であったことから，テンパリング処理は低水分米の食味低下を抑制する効果が認められた．これらの結果から，炊飯米の形状および食味に関し，テンパリング区が最も良好な結果を得た．今後は，テンパリング処理の最適処理条件の究明および形態学的なアプローチによる扁平炊飯粒の発生機構の解明を行う予定である...|$|R

40|$|LectureHeat soak {{is defined}} as heat {{transfer}} from the metal of a seal chamber to the fluid within the seal chamber. Many variables affect <b>heat</b> <b>soak</b> including materials, surface configurations, and film coefficients. <b>Heat</b> <b>soak</b> can be from the seal chamber to the fluid within, or from the fluid to the seal chamber. Typically, the term <b>heat</b> <b>soak</b> is used to describe heat transfer from a hot pump to a cooler liquid within the seal chamber. During {{the development of the}} API 682 seal standard (2004), the API 682 Task Force adopted an equation for estimating <b>heat</b> <b>soak</b> but recommended that the coefficients in the equation should be based on tests. However, there are still little data available and most users simply estimate <b>heat</b> <b>soak</b> using the API 682 default values. For a number of service conditions, the API 682 default equation produces unnecessarily high estimates for <b>heat</b> <b>soak</b> but default estimates are not always high. As a result, auxiliary systems can be incorrectly sized by using the API 682 default equation for <b>heat</b> <b>soak.</b> Improvements are needed in the API 682 <b>heat</b> <b>soak</b> equation. The first step toward improving the API 682 <b>heat</b> <b>soak</b> equation was to use simple one-dimensional find theory to derive a heat transfer equation. Surprisingly, this one-dimensional fin equation could be recast into a form that approximated the API equation but included additional parameters. The theoretical fin equation was checked and further improved using two-dimensional finite element analysis and again by using computational fluid dynamics. The predicted heat transfer compares favorably to measurements in the test lab. Based on these studies, the authors have prepared and offer a table of adjustment factors to be applied to the default API 682 <b>heat</b> <b>soak</b> equation...|$|E
