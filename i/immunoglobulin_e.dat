25|$|A major {{breakthrough}} {{in understanding the}} mechanisms of allergy was {{the discovery of the}} antibody class labeled <b>immunoglobulin</b> <b>E</b> (IgE). IgE was simultaneously discovered in 1966–67 by two independent groups: Ishizaka's team at the Children's Asthma Research Institute and Hospital in Denver, Colorado, and by Gunnar Johansson and Hans Bennich in Uppsala, Sweden. Their joint paper was published in April 1969.|$|E

25|$|Common foods {{involved}} include cow's milk, peanuts, eggs, shellfish, fish, tree nuts, soy, wheat, rice, and fruit. The common allergies {{vary depending}} on the country. Risk factors include a family history of allergies, vitamin D deficiency, obesity, and high levels of cleanliness. Allergies occur when <b>immunoglobulin</b> <b>E</b> (IgE), part of the body's immune system, binds to food molecules. A protein in the food is usually the problem. This triggers the release of inflammatory chemicals such as histamine. Diagnosis is usually based on a medical history, elimination diet, skin prick test, blood tests for food-specific IgE antibodies, or oral food challenge.|$|E
25|$|There are {{hypersensitivity}} responses, both a type I response (atopic, with {{formation of}} <b>immunoglobulin</b> <b>E,</b> or IgE) and a type III hypersensitivity response (with formation of immunoglobulin G, or IgG). The reaction of IgE with Aspergillus antigens results in mast cell degranulation with bronchoconstriction and increased capillary permeability. Immune complexes (a type III reaction) and inflammatory cells are deposited within the mucous membranes of the airways, leading to necrosis (tissue death) and eosinophilic infiltration. Type 2 T helper cells appear {{to play an}} important role in ABPA due to an increased sensitivity to interleukin (IL) 4 and IL-5. These cytokines up-regulate mast cell degranulation, exacerbating respiratory decline.|$|E

40|$|Saliva is {{the product}} of {{multiple}} salivary glands lyingbeneath the oral mucosa. Each day, the humansalivary glands produce almost 600 mL of serous and mucinous saliva 1 containing minerals, electrolytes, buffers, enzymes and enzyme inhibitors, growth factors and cytokines, <b>immunoglobulins</b> (<b>e.</b> g., secretory immunoglob-ulin A [sIgA]), mucins and other glycoproteins. 1 - 5 Once saliva passes through the ducts and enters the oral cavity, it mixes with blood cells, microorganisms (viruses, bacteria and yeast) and microbial products, oral epithelial cells and cell products, food debris and upper-airway secretions. Although saliva consists mostly of water, it plays a key phys-iologic role in the lubrication and repair of the oral mucosa, the formation and swallowing of food boluses, the diges-tion of starch, the facilitation of food tasting and the control of oropharyngeal microbial populations. Saliva also aids in the formation of plaque and, through its supersatu...|$|R
40|$|The immune {{response}} {{consists of two}} main components: humoral immunity represented by B lymphocytes and cellular immunity maintained by the T lymphocytes. Immunoglobulins, produced by B– lymphocytes, are the main mediators of humoral immunity, and deficiencies at this level affect the body's response to infection. Plasmocytes produce nine antibody izotypes: immunoglobulins G (IgG 1, lgG 2, lgG 3, lgG 4), immunoglobulins M (IgM), immunoglobulins A (lgA 1, lgA 2), immunoglobulins D (IGD) and <b>immunoglobulins</b> <b>E</b> (IgE). Primary hypogammaglobulinemias are characterized by the occurrence of recurrent infections and, paradoxically, by the occurrence of autoimmune diseases. Characteristic for these diseases is that symptoms occur at 7 – 9 months after birth, when transplacental antibody titers transmitted from the mother decrease, and the infant's body is unable to synthesize them to normal levels. Primary hypogammaglobulinemias are transmitted genetically, but mutations {{at the molecular level}} are still not fully understood. The most common are: Bruton agammaglobulinemia, transient newborn hypogammaglobulinemia, selective immunoglobulin deficiency and variable common immunodeficiency. Treatment consists of monthly antibiotics and immunoglobulins, depending on antibody titers (except for IgA deficiency) ...|$|R
25|$|Common allergens include pollen {{and certain}} food. Metals and other {{substances}} may also cause problems. Food, insect stings, and medications are common causes of severe reactions.

Diagnosis is typically based on a person's medical history. Further testing of the skin or blood may be useful in certain cases. Positive tests, however, may not mean there is a significant allergy to the substance in question.|$|E

40|$|Background: Amazonian {{populations are}} exposed to diverse parasites and pathogens, {{including}} protozoal, bacterial, fungal and helminthic infections. Yet much knowledge {{of the immune system}} is based on industrialised populations where these infections are relatively rare. Aim: This study examines distributions and age-related differences in 22 measures of immune function for Bolivian forager-horticulturalists and US and European populations. Subjects and methods: Subjects were 6338 Tsimane aged 0 – 90 years. Blood samples collected between 2004 – 2014 were analysed for 5 -part blood differentials, C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and total <b>immunoglobulins</b> <b>E,</b> G, A and M.

Results: Compared to reference populations, Tsimane have elevated levels of most immunological parameters, particularly immunoglobulins, eosinophils, ESR, B cells, and natural killer cells. However, monocytes and basophils are reduced and naïve CD 4 cells depleted in older age groups. Conclusion: Tsimane ecology leads to lymphocyte repertoires and immunoglobulin profiles that differ from those observed in industrialised populations.

40|$|The humanized {{monoclonal}} anti-IgE antibody omalizumab {{is currently}} the only biologic drug approved for asthma treatment. Omalizumab inhibits allergic responses by binding to serum <b>immunoglobulins</b> <b>E</b> (IgE), thus preventing their interactions with cellular IgE receptors. Omalizumab is also capable of down-regulating the expression of high affinity IgE receptors on inflammatory cells, {{as well as the}} numbers of eosinophils in both peripheral blood and induced sputum. The clinical effects of omalizumab include relevant improvements in respiratory symptoms and quality of life, paralleled by a marked reduction of asthma exacerbations, emergency room visits, and use of systemic corticosteroids and rescue bronchodilators. Moreover, some recent studies suggest potential benefits of omalizumab also in non allergic phenotypes of severe asthma. Very interesting are also further recent reports referring to the potential inhibitory effect of omalizumab with regard to bronchial structural changes, especially occurring in severe asthma and globally defined as airway remodeling. Omalizumab is relatively well tolerated, and only very rarely induces anaphylactic reactions. Therefore, this drug represents a valid option as add-on therapy for patients with severe persistent asthma, inadequately controlled by high doses of standard inhaled treatments...|$|R

All infants excreted CMV in the urine. It was demonstrated that the CMV IgE test was more sensitive than the CMV IgM test in diagnosing CMV infection in neonates by serology. Thus, the sensitivity for the IgE test was 82 %, whereas for the IgM test it was only 66 %. Furthermore, the CMV-specific IgE response, expressed as absorbance, was higher than the specific IgM response in 91 % of the 76 sera which contained antibodies of either one or both immunoglobulin classes. Forty-six control sera, including 18 umbilical cord sera, from 46 neonates from whom CMV was not isolated were also tested. Most sera were negative. Three infants, however, had CMV antibodies of one or both classes, indicating infection.

2500|$|Wheat allergy is {{an allergy}} which {{typically}} presents {{itself as a}} food allergy, but {{can also be a}} contact allergy resulting from occupational exposure to wheat. Like all allergies, wheat allergy involves <b>immunoglobulin</b> <b>E</b> and mast cell response. [...] Typically the allergy is limited to the seed storage proteins of wheat, some reactions are restricted to wheat proteins, while others can react across many varieties of seeds and other plant tissues. Wheat allergy may be a misnomer since there are many allergenic components in wheat, for example serine protease inhibitors, glutelins and prolamins and different responses are often attributed to different proteins. Twenty-seven potential wheat allergens have been successfully identified. The most severe response is exercise/aspirin induced anaphylaxis attributed to one omega gliadin that is a relative of the protein that causes celiac disease. Other more common symptoms include nausea, urticaria, atopy. Gluten sensitivity is not usually classified as a wheat allergy.|$|E

40|$|Background: The authors had a goal {{to assess}} {{clinical}} efficacy of adapted goat milk formula and its possibilities for usage in nutrition of infants during {{first six months of}} life. Patients and methods : Seventy three healthy infants at the age from 1 to 4 months were  followed-up, among them 42 — on artificial feeding and received the investigated formula, and 31 — breast-fed (comparative group). The duration of follow-up was 30 – 40 days. The criteria of efficacy of the investigated formula were: tolerability, dynamics of weight and height and laboratory characteristics (hemoglobin concentration in erythrocytes and equivalent of hemoglobin in reticulocytes, concentrations of blood iron, ferritin, prealbumin, active metabolites of vitamin D 3 (25 OH) in capillary blood, revealing of specific <b>immunoglobulins</b> <b>E</b> to cow and goat milk proteins with the help of express-method and coprological test), assessment of actual nutrition of infants with calculation of the main macro- and micronutrients, energetic value of the diet and protein efficacy coefficient.
