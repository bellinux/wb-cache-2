5|$|There are {{concerns}} {{as to whether}} breeding hairless and tailless rats is ethical. The tail is vital for rats' balance and for adjusting body temperature. Tailless rats have greater risk of <b>heat</b> <b>exhaustion,</b> poor bowel and bladder control, falling from heights, and can {{be at risk for}} life-threatening deformities in the pelvic region like hind leg paralysis and megacolon. Similarly, hairless rats are less protected from scratches and the cold without their coat. Groups such as the NFRS prohibit the showing of these varieties at their events and forbid advertisement through affiliated services.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{increasingly}} squalid conditions, {{the population}} inside continued to grow. The situation {{inside the building}} was described as chaotic; reports of rampant drug use, fights, rape, and filthy living conditions were widespread. At the time, as many as 100 {{were reported to have}} died in the Superdome, with most deaths resulting from <b>heat</b> <b>exhaustion,</b> but other reported incidents included an accused rapist who was beaten to death by a crowd and an apparent suicide. Despite these reports, though, the final official death toll was significantly less: six people inside (4 of natural causes, one overdose, and an apparent suicide) and a few more in the general area outside the stadium.|$|E
5|$|The New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade {{had moved}} out at dawn, {{followed}} by the 5th Mounted Brigade without ambulance support, as the New Zealand Field Ambulance had not returned from Romani and the 5th Mounted Field Ambulance had not yet arrived. Fortunately, casualties were light, and both ambulances arrived in the evening. The 3rd Light Horse Field Ambulance, had formed a dressing station at Bir Nagid {{to the south of}} Romani, treating wounded from 3rd Light Horse Brigade's engagement at Bir el Hamisah, a convoy brought in wounded Ottomans from a hod to the south of Romani, and 150 cases of <b>heat</b> <b>exhaustion</b> from infantry in the 42nd Division were treated during the day.|$|E
40|$|Catalytic resistojets {{are small}} {{thrusters}} that use electric {{power and a}} catalyst to heat and decompose a propellant before exhaustion through a nozzle. This paper describes the design and construction of a bench for testing electrothermal catalytic thrusters, and the design, construction and tests of a 0. 2 N thruster using self-pressurized nitrous oxide (N 2 O) as propellant. The systems for fuel storage, ducting, injection, <b>heating,</b> <b>exhaustion,</b> instrumentation and data aquisition are described. Preliminary tests with no propellant decomposition and power input from 100 to 400 W have reached specific impulses from 70 to 120 s with thrust levels from 150 to 250 mN. The N 2 O decomposition was achieved by a pre-heated Ru/Al 2 O 3 catalyst...|$|R

5|$|Caracciola {{regained his}} German Grand Prix title at the Nürburgring at the 1928 German Grand Prix, driving the new 7.1-litre Mercedes-Benz SS. He shared the driving with Christian Werner, {{who took over}} Caracciola's car when the latter {{collapsed}} with <b>heat</b> <b>exhaustion</b> at a pit stop. The German Grand Prix, like many other races at the time, ignored the official Grand Prix racing rules set by the Association Internationale des Automobile Clubs Reconnus (International Association of Recognized Auto Clubs, or AIACR), which limited weight and fuel consumption, and instead ran races under a Formula Libre, or free formula. As a result, Mercedes-Benz focused less on producing Grand Prix cars and more on sports cars, and Caracciola drove the latest incarnation of this line, the SSK, at the Semmering hillclimb, and further reduced his own record on the course by half a second.|$|E
5|$|The {{enhanced}} A Company group—approximately 130 {{troops in}} total—arrived {{in the country}} in several groups and joined the SAS, who had already established a base in Hastings, a village 30 miles (50 kilometres) south of Freetown, where several of the paras recognised former colleagues among the troopers from D Squadron. At Hastings, the paras focused on live firing exercises and rehearsed various scenarios in a scale replica of Magbeni which had been constructed at the camp. As well as learning the layout of the village and refining battle technique, the rehearsals allowed the soldiers to acclimatise to the tropical heat, and led commanders to the decision that the paras would go into battle with minimal equipment {{to reduce the risk of}} heat exhaustion—excluding weapons and ammunition, they would carry only water and field dressings. Some officers feared that the weight of body armour would increase the risk of <b>heat</b> <b>exhaustion,</b> but commanders hoped that the cooler temperatures of the early morning (when the operation was planned to be launched) would mitigate the effects of the weight, and decided to order its use.|$|E

50|$|Temperature {{extremes}} {{can also}} pose {{a danger to}} workers. Heat stress can cause <b>heat</b> stroke, <b>exhaustion,</b> cramps, and rashes. Heat can also fog up safety glasses or cause sweaty palms or dizziness, all of which {{increase the risk of}} other injuries. Workers near hot surfaces or steam also are at risk for burns. Dehydration may also result from overexposure to heat. Cold stress also poses a danger to many workers. Overexposure to cold conditions or extreme cold can lead to hypothermia, frostbite, trench foot, or chilblains.|$|R

She testified that, after abducting Reso, she and her husband confined him to a pine box in a metal storage facility, giving him very little food and water, and no medical treatment for his bullet wound. Three days after the kidnapping, Reso died from <b>heat</b> and <b>exhaustion.</b> The couple dumped his body in Bass River State Park. It would be discovered on June 28. Irene was sentenced to 20 years in prison and released in November 2009.|$|R
25|$|Through late 1990, The Screaming Jets became infamous for {{a series}} of raucous, {{sometimes}} violent, live shows. During shows to launch the debut EP, fights often broke out as the band's faithful Newcastle fans mixed with the new Sydney fans.

25|$|Humans, {{like most}} of the other apes, lack {{external}} tails, have several blood type systems, have opposable thumbs, and are sexually dimorphic. The comparatively minor anatomical differences between humans and chimpanzees are a result of human bipedalism. One difference is that humans have a far faster and more accurate throw than other animals. Humans are also among the best long-distance runners in the animal kingdom, but slower over short distances. Humans' thinner body hair and more productive sweat glands help avoid <b>heat</b> <b>exhaustion</b> while running for long distances.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, {{thousands}} of boys {{were employed in}} glass making industries. Glass making was a dangerous and tough job especially without the current technologies. The process of making glass includes intense heat to melt glass (3133°F). When the boys are at work, {{they are exposed to}} this heat. This could cause eye trouble, lung ailments, <b>heat</b> <b>exhaustion,</b> cut, and burns. Since workers were paid by the piece, they had to work productively for hours without a break. Since furnaces had to be constantly burning, there were night shifts from 5:00pm to 3:00am. Many factory owners preferred boys under 16 years of age.|$|E
25|$|After {{the middle}} of May and in {{particular}} from mid June {{to the end of}} July the heat in the Sinai desert ranged from extreme to fierce. Even worse were the Khamsin dust storms which blow once every 50 days for a few hours or several days, turning the atmosphere into a haze of floating sand particles flung about by a hot southerly wind. The troops and their commanders, unused to the conditions, suffered considerably from heatstroke and thirst during these early patrols. One such patrol, returning during the hottest part of the day after a sleepless night far from base, and very little water, suffered casualties of 160 men who collapsed from <b>heat</b> <b>exhaustion.</b>|$|E
