The decision sparked about a demonstration by about 200-300 NRMA men in Prince George, although none from the Division's Defence and Employment Platoon took part. For a few days, there were demonstrations at several camps along the coast.

40|$|We {{address the}} problem of extracting single-nucleon {{momentum}} distributions $n(p) $ from inclusice scattering data. A model for these relates nuclear and nucleon structure functions (SF) through an intermediate SF $f^{PN}$ for a nucleus of point-particles. In addition to the asymptotic limit (AL) which depends on $n(p), f^{PN}$ contains, generally $q$-dependent Final State Interactions (FSI) parts. In the inverse problem one wishes to separate $q$-dependent FSI from the AL. In general it suffices to know the structure of the theory, but not numerical results. It appears, that in the $q$-range of the analyzed electron scattering data, FSI are only weakly $q$-dependent, making it virtually impossible to obtain parameters in a <b>free</b> <b>fit</b> of the parametrized components of $f$.

A rope is modelled as an array of metallic nanotubes, taking into account phonon-mediated as well as Coulomb interactions, and arbitrary Cooper pair hopping amplitudes (Josephson couplings) between different tubes. We use a systematic cumulant expansion to construct the Ginzburg-Landau action including quantum fluctuations. The regime of validity is carefully established, {{and the effect of}} phase slips is assessed. Quantum phase slips are shown to cause a depression of the critical temperature T_c below the mean-field value, and a temperature-dependent resistance below T_c.

30|$|Of course, we do {{not claim}} that our method is {{generally}} superior to other approaches such as matrix-product states (MPS) or the density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG). As always, different approaches have their own advantages and drawbacks. Apart from the aforementioned applicability to higher-dimensional lattices {{and the ability to}} treat long-range correlations, the advantages of our method are the following: Most importantly, the computational complexity of our method scales polynomially (instead of exponentially) with system size - even in the presence of long-range correlations. Note that this is different for matrix-product states, for example, where the required internal matrix dimension scales exponentially with the entanglement entropy which is proportional to the system size in these non-equilibrium situations [4]. Furthermore, our method can be applied to general lattice structures with periodic or open boundary conditions and does not contain any <b>free</b> <b>fit</b> parameter.

40|$|An {{algorithm}} for {{the detection}} of visually relevant luminance features is presented. The algorithm is motivated and directed by current models of the visual system. The algorithm detects edges (sharp luminance transitions) and narrow bars (luminance cusps) and marks them with the proper polarity. The image is first bandpass filtered with oriented filters at a number of scales an octave apart. The suprathreshold image contrast details at each scale are then identified and are compared across scales to find locations in which the signal polarity (sign) is identical at all scales, representing a minimal level of phase congruence across scales. These locations maintain the polarity of the bandpass-filtered image. The result is a polarity-preserving features map representing the edges with pairs of light and dark lines or curves on corresponding sides of the contour. Similarly, bar features are detected and represented with single curves of the proper polarity. The algorithm is implemented without <b>free</b> (<b>fitted)</b> parameters. All parameters are directly derived from visual models and from measurements on human observers. The algorithm is shown to be robust with respect to variations in filter parameters and requires no use of quadrature filters or Hilbert transforms.

Three component, <b>free</b> <b>fit</b> {{analysis was used}} for the lifetime spectra. It is found that I- 3 drops sharply on initial iodine doping, whereas decrease in tau(3) is small, indicating inhibition of positronium formation by the dopant. The S parameter, on iodine doping, initially shows a drastic increase due to the decrease in crystallinity of the doped sample. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and x-ray diffraction curves confirm that doping results in decreased crystallinity of the sample. tau(3) increases beyond 23 wt% doping level due to structural changes induced by formation of polyiodide complexes, which is confirmed by UV-Vis spectra, for moderately and highly doped samples. The drop in tau(3) at higher levels of doping (> 44 wt %) suggests chemical quenching of positronium, probably due to iodine aggregation.

40|$|Abstract: We {{report on}} the {{pressure}} dependence of time-resolved femtosecond coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (fs-CARS). Fs-CARS {{has been found to}} provide a powerful tool for the investigation of collision-induced line broadening and mixing effects appearing in coherent scattering processes. From these results a new model for describing collision induced intra molecular energy transfer based on only two <b>free</b> <b>fit</b> parameters has been formulated and found to be in excellent agreement with the experiment. A variety of spectroscopic approaches has been used to study collision dynamics in gases. These methods might be classified into incoherent and coherent scattering processes. The scattering amplitude of the latter process depends on the squared number of molecules in the interaction region and the radiation is directional (phase matched). In four wave mixing processes, such as CARS, where pairs of molecules contribute coherently, the scattering rate is related to the product of the third order nonlinear susceptibility (χa(3)) *(χb(3)) of distinct molecules (a,b). For homogeneous gases the time dependent molecular response becomes proportional to |χ(3) | 2. The temporal structure of the CARS signal arises from the interference between the multiple transitions covered by the broad bandwidth of the fs excitation pulses [1, 2]. if ifif 2 ifi i(3...|$|E
40|$|In {{combustion}} {{processes of}} metal or metal containing energetic materials the combustion temperature {{is one of}} the most critical physical parameters for thermodynamic calculations and necessary for a better understanding of the involved phenomena. Thereby the temperature of the vapor phase is a special challenge. A fit of the continuum radiation with a grey body function provides the temperature of the burning bulk material. One of the methods to determine the temperature of the vapor phase is to observe the emission of the atom lines or diatomic molecules, calculate their spectra and fit them to the experimental spectra. In most cases this process requires a high resolution spectrometer, high computing efforts and a lot of knowledge about the properties of the spectra. To avoid these requirements a parameterized function modeling only the vibrational bands was developed from calculated high resolution spectra. Therein, the temperature is a <b>free</b> <b>fit</b> parameter. The full width at half maximum of the lines was adapted to the resolution of an overview spectrometer (delta lambda about 3 nm).
