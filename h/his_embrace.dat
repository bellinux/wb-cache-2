5|$|By the {{following}} year Aij Tjeng and Gwat Nio have mostly recovered, having moved far away and turned to religion. Bian Koen, however, remains suicidal, and intends {{to go to war}} in China to find death; the only thing restraining him is his promise to wait for the anniversary of Lily's death. One day, as he is passing through the village of Cikembang, he finds a well-kept grave. As he examines the area, he sees a woman who he thinks is Lily. She rejects <b>his</b> <b>embrace</b> and runs away. When Bian Koen chases her, he falls and passes out.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the value}} placed by the Hohenzollern family on a {{traditional}} military education, Augusta insisted {{that her son}} also receive a classical education. Accordingly, Frederick was thoroughly tutored in both military traditions and the liberal arts. His private tutor was Ernst Curtius, a famous archaeologist. Frederick was a talented student, particularly good at foreign languages, becoming fluent in English and French, and studying Latin. He also studied history, geography, physics, music and religion, and excelled at gymnastics; as required of a Prussian prince, he became a very good rider. Hohenzollern princes were made familiar with the military traditions of their dynasty at an early age; Frederick was ten when he was commissioned as a second lieutenant into the First Infantry Regiment of Guards and invested with the Order of the Black Eagle. As he grew older, {{he was expected to}} maintain an active involvement in military affairs. But, at the age of 18, he broke with family tradition and entered the University of Bonn where he studied history, law and governance and public policy. During his time at Bonn (1850-1852), his teachers included Ernst Moritz Arndt and Friedrich Christoph Dahlmann. His time spent at the university, coupled with the influence of less conservative family members, were instrumental in <b>his</b> <b>embrace</b> of liberal beliefs.|$|E

A study in African Affairs in 2008 found that Mbeki's government could have prevented the deaths of 343,000 South Africans during his tenure, had it followed the more sensible public health policies then applied in the Western Cape province.|$|E
25|$|Anawrahta's legacy {{went far}} {{beyond the borders of}} modern Burma. <b>His</b> <b>embrace</b> of Theravada Buddhism and his success in {{stopping}} the advance of Khmer Empire, a Hindu state, provided the Buddhist school, which had been in retreat elsewhere in South and Southeast Asia, a much needed reprieve and a safe shelter. He helped restart Theravada Buddhism in Ceylon, the Buddhist school's original home. The success of Pagan dynasty made Theravada Buddhism's later growth in Lan Na (northern Thailand), Siam (central Thailand), Lan Xang (Laos), and Khmer Empire (Cambodia) in the 13th and 14th centuries possible.|$|E
25|$|The 1896 {{realignment}} cemented the Republicans as {{the party}} of big business, while Theodore Roosevelt added more small business support by <b>his</b> <b>embrace</b> of trust busting. He handpicked his successor William Howard Taft in 1908, but they became enemies on economic issues. Defeated by Taft for the 1912 nomination, Roosevelt bolted the party and led the third party ticket of the Progressive Party. The Republicans returned to the White House throughout the 1920s, running on platforms of normalcy, business-oriented efficiency, and high tariffs. The national party avoided the prohibition issue after it became law in 1920.|$|E

25|$|His {{controversial}} {{reassessment of}} global warming theory in 2009 outlined his concern that the remedies for climate change might prove more damaging to the environment than the ailment itself. Taylor argued that his work with the CRI {{had given him a}} deeper insight into the impacts associated with powering a modern economy from renewable sources. Despite an endorsement by the drafting author of the Kyoto Protocol – Professor Jackson Davis, with whom he worked at the UN and who had played a role in setting up the Framework Climate Convention, the book received little publicity at first – but in the lead up to the Copenhagen summit, his views were widely publicized. However, Taylor is critical of how the environmental movement and left-liberal press have ignored the book - it was not reviewed in The Guardian, The Independent, The Observer, nor in New Scientist, all of which had previously covered his work. He has become a target of ad hominem attacks focussed either on whether he is adequately qualified to review climate science or on <b>his</b> <b>embrace</b> of mystical philosophy and shamanism.|$|E
25|$|At home, Liza {{plays the}} spinet {{as she and}} her friend Pauline sing a duet about evening in the countryside. Their girlfriends ask to hear more, so Pauline {{launches}} into a sad ballad, followed by a dancelike song. As the merriment increases, Liza remains pensively apart. A Governess chides the girls for indulging in unbecoming folk dancing and asks the visitors to leave. Pauline, the last to go, urges Liza to cheer up; Liza replies that after a storm there is a beautiful night and asks the maid, Masha, not to close the French windows to the balcony. Alone, Liza voices her unhappiness with her engagement; she has been stirred by the romantic look {{of the young man}} in the park. To her shock, Herman appears on the balcony. Claiming he is about to shoot himself over her betrothal to another, he begs her to take pity on him. When the Countess is heard knocking, Liza hides Herman and opens the door to the old woman, who tells her to shut the windows and go to bed. After the Countess retires, Liza asks Herman to leave but is betrayed by her feelings and falls into <b>his</b> <b>embrace.</b>|$|E
500|$|The {{events that}} caused Bucer {{to leave the}} Dominican Order arose from <b>his</b> <b>embrace</b> of new ideas and his growing contact with other humanists and reformers. A fellow Dominican, Jacob van Hoogstraaten, the Grand Inquisitor of Cologne, tried to prosecute Johann Reuchlin, a humanist scholar. Other humanists, {{including}} the nobles Ulrich von Hutten and Imperial Knight Franz von Sickingen, took Reuchlin's side. Hoogstraten was thwarted, but he now planned to target Bucer. [...] On 11 November 1520, Bucer told the reformer Wolfgang Capito in a letter that Hoogstraaten was threatening to make an example {{of him as a}} follower of Luther. [...] To escape Dominican jurisdiction, Bucer needed to be freed of his monastic vows. [...] Capito and others were able to expedite the annulment of his vows, and on 29 April 1521 he was formally released from the Dominican order.|$|E

500|$|Harrison {{wrote the}} chord {{progression}} {{of his first}} published song, [...] "Don't Bother Me" [...] (1963), almost exclusively in the Dorian mode, demonstrating an interest in exotic tones that eventually culminated in <b>his</b> <b>embrace</b> of Indian music. The dark timbre of his guitar playing on the track was accentuated by his use of uncomplicated yet effective C+9 chord voicings and a solo in the minor pentatonic scale. By 1964 {{he had begun to}} develop a distinctive personal style as a guitarist, writing parts that featured the use of nonresolving tones, as with the ending chord arpeggios on [...] "A Hard Day's Night". In 1965 he used an expression pedal to control his guitar's volume on [...] "I Need You", creating a syncopated flautando effect with the melody resolving its dissonance through tonal displacements. He used the same volume-swell technique on [...] "Yes It Is", applying what Everett described as [...] "ghostly articulation" [...] to the song's natural harmonics.|$|E
500|$|Archaeologist Niall Finneran {{asserted}} that Lethbridge had a [...] "distinguished if fairly unspectacular reputation" [...] within British archaeology {{prior to his}} adoption of fringe theories. Various colleagues expressed critical praise of his work in this field; for instance, Lethbridge's fellow Anglo-Saxon archaeologist Audrey Meaney noted that his [...] "observations on features in the cemeteries he excavated around Cambridge were perspicacious but in advance of his time". Another Anglo-Saxon archaeologist, Sam Lucy, later noted that Lethbridge's observation that those buried with Anglo-Saxon material culture need not have been ethnically descended from continental migrants was [...] while largely ignored by his contemporaries [...] widely accepted in scholarship {{by the end of}} the 20th century. However, <b>his</b> <b>embrace</b> of unorthodox and pseudo-scientific views later led to professional archaeologists becoming increasingly critical of his work; as his biographer Terry Welbourn noted, Lethbridge's peers came to view him as being [...] "too radical... a loose cannon and maverick".|$|E
500|$|In a 1994 {{interview}} held at Shankar's home in California, Harrison {{spoke of}} the reluctance he used to feel before visiting India or meeting with friends such as A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada of the Hare Krishna movement, due to the [...] "craziness" [...] taking place in {{his life as a}} rock musician. Written during a period when his marriage to Pattie Boyd was ending, [...] "Simply Shady" [...] was inspired by the decadent lifestyle that Harrison had been leading at his Friar Park home in England. Over this period, he had immersed himself in his work, while returning to the worldly ways he had mostly abandoned in 1967, following <b>his</b> <b>embrace</b> of Indian philosophy, particularly meditation. Boyd has written of their overindulgence with drugs and alcohol over 1973–74 and highlighted Harrison's excessive use of cocaine, about which she says: [...] "I think it changed him... it froze George's emotions and hardened his heart." [...] In I, Me, Mine, Harrison describes the song as being [...] "about what happens to naughty boys in the music business". While recognising a disparity between its subject matter and his surroundings at the time, he says he most likely came up with the theme before leaving for India.|$|E

500|$|Fearing that {{he would}} be killed, Lenin and fellow senior Bolshevik Grigory Zinoviev then escaped Petrograd in disguise, {{relocating}} to a house in Razliv owned by Bolshevik metalworker Nikolai Yemelyanov. Concerned about being discovered, they soon left the house for a rural thatchet hut, where they were plagued by mosquitos and torrential rain. It was here that Lenin began work on the book that became The State and Revolution, an exposition on how he believed the socialist state would develop following the proletarian revolution, and how from that point on the state would gradually wither away leaving a pure communist society. The book also represented an attack on other Marxist and far left groups which did not share <b>his</b> <b>embrace</b> of violence as the primary means of achieving proletarian revolution, an attitude that he blamed on the influence of Kautsky. At this point he also dramatic altered his approach to the soviets, declaring them to be counter-revolutionary for their support of the Provisional Government, which he now lambasted as a [...] "military dictatorship". He began arguing for a Bolshevik-led armed insurrection to topple the government, although at a clandestine meeting of the party's central committee this idea was rejected. Lenin then headed by train and by foot to Finland, arriving at Helsinki on 10 August, where he hid away in safe houses belonging to Bolshevik sympathisers. Due to this geographical isolation, Lenin was unable to attend the party's sixth congress, held in secret during July and August.|$|E
500|$|Mandela {{generated}} controversy {{throughout his}} career as an activist and politician, having detractors on both {{the right and the}} radical left. During the 1980s, Mandela was widely labelled a terrorist by prominent political figures in the Western world for <b>his</b> <b>embrace</b> of political violence. According to Thatcher, for instance, the ANC was [...] "a typical terrorist organisation". The US government's State and Defense departments officially designated the ANC as a terrorist organisation, resulting in Mandela remaining on their terrorism watch-list until 2008. On the left, some voices in the ANC—among them Frank B. Wilderson III—accused him of selling out for agreeing to enter negotiations with the apartheid government and for not implementing the reforms of the Freedom Charter during his Presidency. According to Barnard, [...] "there is also a sense in which his chiefly bearing and mode of conduct, the very respect and authority he accrued in representing his nation in his own person, went against the spirit of democracy", and concerns were similarly expressed that he placed his own status and celebrity above the transformation of his country. His government would be criticised for its failure to deal with both the HIV/AIDS pandemic and the high levels of poverty in South Africa. Mandela was also criticised for his friendship with political leaders such as Castro, Gaddafi, and Suharto—deemed dictators by critics—as well as his refusal to condemn their governments' human rights violations.|$|E
500|$|In 1843, Marx became {{co-editor of}} a new, radical leftist Parisian newspaper, the Deutsch-Französische Jahrbücher (German-French Annals), then {{being set up}} by the German socialist Arnold Ruge to bring {{together}} German and French radicals and thus Marx and his wife moved to Paris in October 1843. Initially living with Ruge and his wife communally at 23 Rue Vaneau, they found the living conditions difficult, so moved out following the birth of their daughter Jenny in 1844. Although intended to attract writers from both France and the German states, the Jahrbücher was dominated by the latter and the only non-German writer was the exiled Russian anarchist collectivist Mikhail Bakunin. Marx contributed two essays to the paper, [...] "Introduction to a Contribution to the Critique of Hegel's Philosophy of Right" [...] and [...] "On the Jewish Question", [...] the latter introducing his belief that the proletariat were a revolutionary force and marking <b>his</b> <b>embrace</b> of communism. Only one issue was published, but it was relatively successful, largely owing to the inclusion of Heinrich Heine's satirical odes on King Ludwig of Bavaria, leading the German states to ban it and seize imported copies (Ruge nevertheless refused to fund the publication of further issues and his friendship with Marx broke down). After the paper's collapse, Marx began writing for the only uncensored German-language radical newspaper left, Vorwärts! (Forward!). Based in Paris, the paper was connected to the League of the Just, a utopian socialist secret society of workers and artisans. Marx attended some of their meetings, but did not join. In Vorwärts!, Marx refined his views on socialism based upon Hegelian and Feuerbachian ideas of dialectical materialism, at the same time criticising liberals and other socialists operating in Europe.|$|E
