When using this technique, the fire engine draws water for fire fighting from an unpressurized supply, such as a portable water tank, pool, or other static water source, instead of drawing water from a pressurized water supply, such as a fire hydrant. Under complete vacuum conditions, a pump would lift water , however pumps on fire apparatus are not capable of producing a high vacuum. Due to this limitation and <b>friction</b> <b>loss,</b> fire services do not recommend attempting to lift water more than [...]|$|E

It proves more useful to define the Reynolds number in terms of the mean flow velocity because this quantity remains well defined even in the case of turbulent flow, whereas the maximal flow velocity may not be, or in any case, {{it may be difficult to}} infer. In this form the law approximates the Darcy friction factor, the energy (head) loss factor, <b>friction</b> <b>loss</b> factor or Darcy (friction) factor [...] in the laminar flow at very low velocities in cylindrical tube. The theoretical derivation of a slightly different form of the law was made independently by Wiedman in 1856 and Neumann and E. Hagenbach in 1858 (1859, 1860). Hagenbach was the first who called this law the Poiseuille's law.|$|E

40|$|International audienceUnderstanding the <b>friction</b> <b>losses</b> of {{automotive}} turbochargers {{is a key}} parameter in assessing properly the mechanical efficiency of these machines. Current turbochargers are mostly equipped with oil bearings: two journal bearings and one double-acting axial thrust bearing. In order to know on which element improvement efforts have to be focused, {{it is important to}} determine their contribution to the total <b>friction</b> <b>losses.</b> This will also make it possible to calibrate the computation models of <b>friction</b> <b>losses</b> of the bearings separately. Measuring the <b>friction</b> <b>losses</b> of a turbocharger is not easy and existing methods measure only the total losses due to the association of journal and thrust bearings. A novel turbocharger test bench equipped with a highly accurate torquemeter and a magnetic axial load device has been developed. Measuring methodologies have been fine-tuned to measure the total <b>friction</b> <b>losses,</b> the influence of axial load on the thrust bearing, and the mechanical <b>friction</b> <b>losses</b> of the journal bearings alone. The experimental device and measuring methods are detailed in this paper. Experimental results are presented and analysed.
