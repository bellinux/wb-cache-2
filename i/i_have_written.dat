But the cheerfulness of my mind, which comes from the recollection of all my philosophical contemplation, counterbalances all these afflictions. And I beg you {{to take care of the}} children of Metrodorus, in a manner worthy of the devotion shown by the young man to me, and to philosophy.|$|E

[...] Palencia-Roth suggests that this novel is a [...] "labyrinthine summation... of García Márquez's long-standing obsessions and ever-present topics: love, death, solitude, power, fate".|$|E

500|$|Fleming wrote Diamonds Are Forever at his Goldeneye {{estate in}} Jamaica in January and February 1955. He {{followed}} his usual practice, which he later outlined in Books and Bookmen magazine, {{in which he}} said: [...] "I write for about three hours in the morning... and I do another hour's work between six and seven in the evening. I never correct anything and I {{never go back to}} see what <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>written...</b> By following my formula, you write 2,000 words a day."

Titled Career of Evil, it was released on 20 October 2015 in the United States, and on 22 October 2015 in the United Kingdom.|$|E
500|$|Arthur J. Burks, the President of the American Fiction Guild, {{wrote that}} an excited Hubbard {{called him and}} said: [...] "I {{want to see you}} right away. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>written</b> THE book." [...] Hubbard {{believed}} that Excalibur would [...] "revolutionize everything" [...] and that [...] "it was somewhat more important, and would have a greater impact upon people, than the Bible." [...] It proposed that all human behavior could be explained in terms of survival and that to understand survival was to understand life. As Hubbard biographer Jon Atack notes, [...] "the notion that everything that exists is trying to survive became the basis of Dianetics and Scientology." ...|$|E

5000|$|Shyamalan {{conceived}} {{the idea for}} Split years before he actually wrote the screenplay. He explained, [...] "In this case <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>written</b> the character a while ago, and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>written</b> out a few scenes of it, so <b>I</b> even <b>had</b> dialogue <b>written</b> out, which is really unusual for me. It {{sat there for a}} long time, and <b>I</b> really don't <b>have</b> a clear reason why I didn't pull the trigger earlier. But this felt like the perfect time to do it, with the type of movies I'm doing now, and the type of tones I am interested in - humor and suspense." ...|$|R
500|$|In May 1963 Fleming wrote a {{piece for}} Books and Bookmen {{magazine}} in which he described his approach to writing Bond books: [...] "I write for about three hours in the morning... and I do another hour's work between six and seven in the evening. I never correct anything and I {{never go back to}} see what <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>written...</b> By following my formula, you write 2,000 words a day." [...] Benson identified what he described as the [...] "Fleming Sweep", the use of [...] "hooks" [...] at the end of chapters to heighten tension and pull the reader into the next. The hooks combine with what Anthony Burgess calls [...] "a heightened journalistic style" [...] to produce [...] "a speed of narrative, which hustles the reader past each danger point of mockery".|$|E
500|$|Fleming had {{previously}} mentioned to friends {{that he wanted}} to write a spy novel, {{but it was not until}} early 1952, to distract himself from his forthcoming nuptials, that he began to write Casino Royale at his Goldeneye estate in Jamaica on 17 February; he typed out 2,000 words in the morning, directly from his own experiences and imagination, and finished work on the manuscript in March 1952. It was a pattern he retained for future Bond books. In May 1963 he wrote a piece for Books and Bookmen magazine in which he said: [...] "I write for about three hours in the morning... and I do another hour's work between six and seven in the evening. I never correct anything and I never go back to see what <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>written...</b> By following my formula, you write 2,000 words a day." ...|$|E
500|$|Orwell is {{best remembered}} for his {{political}} commentary as a left-wing anti-totalitarian. As he explained in the essay [...] "Why I Write" [...] (1946), [...] "Every line of serious work that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>written</b> since 1936 has been written, directly or indirectly, against totalitarianism and for democratic socialism, as I understand it." [...] To that end Orwell used his fiction {{as well as his}} journalism to defend his political convictions. He first achieved widespread acclaim with his fictional novella Animal Farm and cemented his place in history with the publication of Nineteen Eighty-Four shortly before his death. While fiction accounts for a small fraction of his total output, these two novels are his best-selling works, having sold almost fifty million copies in sixty-two languages by 2007—more than any other pair of books by a twentieth-century author.|$|E

500|$|If {{they and}} their shepherds go, that {{is the end of}} the Lakeland where I have climbed, walked, skied and skated for nearly 80 years; of the Lakeland <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>written</b> about nearly all my life. The {{destruction}} of entire flocks meant that the shepherds were forced to undergo the process of again heafing (the local term for hefting) their new sheep to the hills. Normally, ewes teach this behaviour to their lambs, but with no more ewes left acquainted with a particular heaf the behavior had to be taught all over again to new ewes, inevitably involving much rounding up of flocks that had strayed over the often inaccessible fells. Unheafed sheep might also cause overgrazing by wandering if they replaced the original Herdwicks. The Cumbria Hill Sheep Initiative was set up to [...] "reassess the position and circumstances" [...] in the aftermath of the disease; tough government restrictions in order to prevent another outbreak are still in place.|$|E
500|$|Once Fleming and {{his wife}} arrived at Goldeneye, he started work on the second Bond novel. In May 1963 he wrote an article for Books and Bookmen {{magazine}} describing his approach to writing, in which he said: [...] "I write for about three hours in the morning... and I do another hour's work between six and seven in the evening. I never correct anything and I {{never go back to}} see what <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>written...</b> By following my formula, you write 2,000 words a day." [...] As he had done with Casino Royale, Fleming showed the manuscript to his friend, the writer William Plomer, who reacted favourably to the story, telling Fleming that [...] "the new book held this reader like a limpet mine & the denouement was shattering". On a trip to the US in May 1953 Fleming used his five-day travelling time on RMS Queen Elizabeth to correct the proofs of the novel.|$|E
500|$|Hobart was {{a strong}} {{supporter}} of the gold standard; and insisted on it remaining {{a major part of the}} Republican campaign even in the face of Bryan's surge. [...] In his speech responding to the formal notification of his convention victory, Hobart stated, [...] "An honest dollar, worth 100 cents everywhere, cannot be coined out of 53 cents worth of silver plus a legislative fiat. Such a debasement of our currency would inevitably produce incalculable loss, appalling disaster, and National dishonor." [...] McKinley was not as strong a supporter of the gold standard as Hobart, and considered modifying some of Hobart's expressed views on the gold standard before the acceptance was printed for public distribution. [...] Hobart insisted on it being printed without change, writing, [...] "I think I know the sentiment of Eastern men better than you can, and with this knowledge and my convictions I must retain the statements as <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>written</b> them." [...] According to Connolly, [...] "Though a protectionist, Hobart believed the money issue, not tariffs, led to a November Republican victory, and, in denouncing silver, his rhetoric far outstripped [...] William McKinley." ...|$|E

500|$|In June 1956 {{the author}} Ian Fleming began a {{collaboration}} with the producer Henry Morgenthau III on a planned television series, Commander Jamaica, which was to feature the Caribbean-based character James Gunn. [...] When the project foundered, and Fleming could not fashion a new plot for his next Bond novel, he used the idea {{as the basis for}} Dr. No. By January 1957 he had published four Bond novels in successive years from 1953—Casino Royale, Live and Let Die, Moonraker and Diamonds Are Forever. A fifth, From Russia, with Love, was being edited and prepared for production. That month Fleming travelled to his Goldeneye estate in Jamaica to write Dr. No. He followed his usual practice, which he later outlined in Books and Bookmen magazine: [...] "I write for about three hours in the morning... and I do another hour's work between six and seven in the evening. I never correct anything and I never go back to see what <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>written...</b> By following my formula, you write 2,000 words a day." [...] By the time he returned to London in late February, he had completed a 206-page first draft, which he initially titled The Wound Man.|$|E
500|$|Keats {{was never}} a {{professional}} writer. Instead, he supported himself with a small income that he earned as a surgeon for Guy's Hospital. At the age of 23, Keats left the hospital, losing his source of income, in order to devote himself to writing poetry. He lived with Charles Brown, a friend who collected Keats's poetry while supporting him, during spring 1819 and composed poetry. The early products of this effort included La Belle Dame sans Merci and [...] "Ode to Psyche", {{the first of a}} series of odes that he would write that year. It is uncertain as to when the poem was actually completed, but Keats sent the poem to his brother on 3 May 1819 with an attached letter saying, [...] "The following poem, the last <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>written,</b> is the first and only one with which I have taken even moderate pains; I have, for the most part, dashed off my lines in a hurry; this one I have done leisurely; I think it reads the more richly for it, and it will I hope encourage me to write other things in even a more peaceable and healthy spirit." ...|$|E
500|$|In January 1954 Fleming and his wife, Ann, {{travelled}} {{to their}} Goldeneye estate in Jamaica for their annual two-month holiday. He had already written two Bond novels, Casino Royale, {{which had been}} published in April 1953, and Live and Let Die, whose publication was imminent. He began writing Moonraker on his arrival in the Caribbean. He later wrote an article for Books and Bookmen magazine describing his approach to writing, in which he said: [...] "I write for about three hours in the morning... and I do another hour's work between six and seven in the evening. I never correct anything and I {{never go back to}} see what <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>written...</b> By following my formula, you write 2,000 words a day." [...] By 24 February he had written over 30,000 words, although he wrote to a friend that he felt like he was already parodying the two earlier Bond novels. Fleming's own copy bears the following inscription, [...] "This was written in January and February 1954 and published a year later. It is based on a film script I have had in my mind for many years." [...] He later said that the idea for the film had been too short for a full novel, and that he [...] "had to more or less graft {{the first half of the}} book onto my film idea in order to bring it up to the necessary length".|$|E
5000|$|Ramis' {{newspaper}} writing {{led to his}} becoming joke {{editor at}} Playboy magazine. [...] "I called ... just cold and said <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>written</b> several pieces freelance and did they have any openings. And they happened to have their entry-level job, party jokes editor, open. He liked my stuff {{and he gave me}} a stack of jokes that readers had sent in and asked me to rewrite them. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> been in Second City in the workshops already and Michael Shamberg and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>written</b> comedy shows in college". Ramis was eventually promoted to associate editor.|$|R

500|$|By January 1956 {{the author}} Ian Fleming had {{published}} three novels—Casino Royale in 1953, Live and Let Die in 1954 and Moonraker in 1955. A fourth, Diamonds Are Forever, was being edited {{and prepared for}} production. That month Fleming travelled to his Goldeneye estate in Jamaica to write From Russia, with Love. He followed his usual practice, which he later outlined in Books and Bookmen magazine: [...] "I write for about three hours in the morning... and I do another hour's work between six and seven in the evening. I never correct anything and I {{never go back to}} see what <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>written...</b> By following my formula, you write 2,000 words a day." [...] He returned to London in March that year with a 228-page first-draft manuscript that he subsequently altered more heavily than any of his other works. One of the significant re-writes changed Bond's fate; Fleming had become disenchanted with his books and wrote to his friend, the American author Raymond Chandler: [...] "My muse is in a very bad way... I am getting fed up with Bond and it has been very difficult to make him go through his tawdry tricks." [...] Fleming re-wrote {{the end of the novel}} in April 1956 to make Klebb poison Bond, which allowed him to finish the series with the death of the character if he wanted. Fleming's first draft ended with Bond and Romanova enjoying a romance. By January 1957 Fleming had decided he would write another story, and began work on Dr. No in which Bond recovers from his poisoning and is sent to Jamaica.|$|E
500|$|Because rehearsals did {{not start}} until October 1874 and lasted longer than anticipated, the premiere was delayed. The final rehearsals went well, and in a {{generally}} optimistic mood the first night was fixed for 3 March 1875, the day on which, coincidentally, Bizet's appointment as a Chevalier of the Legion of Honour was formally announced. The premiere, which was conducted by Adolphe Deloffre, was attended by many of Paris's leading musical figures, including Massenet, Offenbach, Delibes and Gounod; during the performance the last-named was overheard complaining bitterly that Bizet had stolen the music of Micaëla's act 3 aria from him: [...] "That melody is mine!" [...] Halévy recorded his impressions of the premiere {{in a letter to}} a friend; the first act was evidently well received, with applause for the main numbers and numerous curtain calls. The first part of act 2 also went well, but after the toreador's song there was, Halévy noted, [...] "coldness". In act 3 only Micaëla's aria earned applause as the audience became increasingly disconcerted. The final act was [...] "glacial from first to last", and Bizet was left [...] "only with the consolations of a few friends". The critic Ernest Newman wrote later that the sentimentalist Opéra-Comique audience was [...] "shocked by the drastic realism of the action" [...] and by the low standing and defective morality of most of the characters. According to the composer Benjamin Godard, Bizet retorted, in response to a compliment, [...] "Don't you see that all these bourgeois have not understood a wretched word of the work <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>written</b> for them?" [...] In a different vein, shortly after the work had concluded, Massenet sent Bizet a congratulatory note: [...] "How happy you must be at this time—it's a great success!".|$|E
