2500|$|Povenmire persisted {{and later}} pitched the series to Nickelodeon, {{where it was}} {{considered}} by high-level executives but rejected again as too complicated. Then, after 16 years of trying, Povenmire landed a pitch with Disney. The network did not immediately accept the show, but told Povenmire they would keep the packet. Povenmire assumed this meant an end to negotiations, aware that the phrase usually [...] "means they {{throw it in the}} trash later." [...] Disney then surprised him by accepting. Said Povenmire, [...] "Disney was the first to say, 'Let's see <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> it in 11 minutes.' We did it in the pilot and they said, 'Let's see <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> it for 26 episodes.|$|E

I didn't get it. Later I {{realized}} that if you're just riding a note or trying to play a real straight part, it sounds more pulsating if you play with one finger. So I took every bass line and learned how to do it with one finger, and I started doing it that way as much as I could. Back then I thought I looked goofy, but now here I am using one finger whenever I can. One finger is ultimately the funkiest sound of all. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> it with one finger, you should. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> it with two fingers, you should choose over three.' ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the first}} {{paragraph}} {{of one of his}} books on endgames, Peter Griffiths emphasized the importance of this endgame:There is simply no substitute to a clear understanding of when and how these positions are won or drawn, not only so that one can play them accurately, but in order to recognize in advance what the correct result should be. [...] <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> that, you can exchange off quite confidently from a more complex position [...]|$|E

6000|$|... "It's {{a matter}} of opinion," [...] I replied, [...] "but {{personally}} I {{think you would have}} been unwise to refuse it. Taking the animal as it stands, I don't feel inclined to give you more than a shilling for it. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> think <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> better by taking it elsewhere, you do so." ...|$|R
2500|$|In May 2012, Scott {{confirmed}} that the replicants were biological in nature, and contrasted them to the androids in the Alien series: Roy Batty was an evolved... He wasn't an engine.

2500|$|There, Nicholls said he met Monsier le Docteur Brachie, {{a leading}} {{physician}} and [...] "multimillionaire of the place". Brachie said, [...] "I want {{a golf course}} in Aix-les-Basin. Far up on the mountain side I {{have a piece of}} land. After breakfast we will take the mules and look over this property with a view to building a course there". Nicholls mentioned that difficulties were encountered in viewing the land {{due to the fact that}} it was heavily wooded. [...] "I saw some beautiful olive and fig trees, but more important, I also saw 60 husky Italian laborers equipped and ready to work. After threading our way through this mountainous woodland and taking another look at the 60 huskies, I promised to give Monsier Le Docteur a golf course in six weeks", said Nicholls. Brachie retorted, [...] "Nicholls, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> that the Bank of France is open to you. Moreover, I will have King Leopold of the Belgians and King George of Greece present for the grand opening".|$|E
2500|$|Dean starred for the Cardinals {{as one of}} baseball's premier {{pitchers}} from 1932 to 1937, {{with four}} All-Star Games, leading the NL in wins and shutouts twice, strikeouts four times, complete games and innings pitched three times, while procuring an MVP award with two runner-up finishes. [...] He also carried a distinctive persona when off the mound. [...] Dean was a robust, zany, quasi-Yogi Berra-prototype who uttered such memorable quotes as, [...] "It ain't bragging <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> it", [...] "Son, what kind of pitch {{would you like to}} miss?", [...] "He slud into third", [...] "I ain't what I used to be, but who the hell is?", [...] "The doctors x-rayed my head and found nothing", [...] "The good Lord was good to me. [...] He gave me a strong body, a good right arm, and a weak mind", and [...] "It puzzles me how they know what corners are good for filling stations. [...] Just how did they know gas and oil was under there?" [...] His uninhibited nature and willingness to become a lightning rod for criticism garnered massive popularity with teammates, fans and media alike. [...] After retiring as a player, Dean augmented even more popularity as a sportscaster and was elected to the Hall of Fame in 1953.|$|E

[...] inquired Thurston, and Bransome answered frankly: [...] "Well, just then I had my doubts about you; now I figure that <b>if</b> <b>you</b> say <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> a thing, <b>you</b> <b>can.</b> Come {{over to the}} ranch, and, if we can't make a deal, I'll give you a week's work, any way." ...|$|R

[...] When asked about a possible backlash by fans due to client integration in Auto Tune The News, Michael Gregory said [...] "The audience gets it. It used to be where any type of sponsorship you might have fans say 'they sold out' but nowadays <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> {{it on your own}} terms, your fans are rooting for you." [...] In an interview with Wired, the band said {{they are going to be}} working with Comedy Central to produce a TV pilot for a television series to be aired sometime in 2011.
