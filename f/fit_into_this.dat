5|$|Labels such as Matador Records, Merge Records, and Dischord, and indie rockers like Pavement, Superchunk, Fugazi, and Sleater-Kinney {{dominated}} the American indie scene {{for most of}} the 1990s. One of the main indie rock movements of the 1990s was lo-fi. The movement, which focused on the recording and distribution of music on low-quality cassette tapes, initially emerged in the 1980s. By 1992, Pavement, Guided by Voices and Sebadoh became popular lo-fi cult acts in the United States, while subsequently artists like Beck and Liz Phair brought the aesthetic to mainstream audiences. The period also saw alternative confessional female singer-songwriters. Besides the aforementioned Liz Phair, Lynda Thomas, PJ Harvey and the massively successful Alanis Morissette <b>fit</b> <b>into</b> <b>this</b> sub group.|$|E

25|$|Over {{the first}} two decades of the Fringe, each {{performing}} group used its own performing space, or venue. However, by the late 1960s, the concept of sharing a venue became popular, principally {{as a means of}} cutting costs.

While a motorway reservation still exists, it is now unlikely to be built, having been superseded by the widening of the N7 between Newlands Cross and Naas to three lanes and the grade separation of this section.

25|$|Historically, {{cellular}} receptors {{have been}} {{thought to be}} activated when bound to their ligand, and are relatively inactive when no ligand is present. A number of receptors have been found that do not <b>fit</b> <b>into</b> <b>this</b> conceptual mould, and DCC is one of them. These receptors are active both with ligand bound and unbound, but the signals transmitted are different when the receptors are ligand bound. Collectively, this type of receptor {{is known as a}} dependence receptor because the unbound pathway is usually apoptotic, meaning that cell survival depends on ligand presence. Other receptors also show this functional profile, including p75NTR, the androgen receptor, RET, several integrins and Patched.|$|E
25|$|Indications for bracing: {{people who}} are still growing who present with Cobb angles less than 20 degrees should be closely monitored. People who are still growing who present with Cobb angles of 20 degrees to 29 degrees should be braced {{according}} to the risk of progression by considering age, Cobb angle increase over a six-month period, Risser sign, and clinical presentation. People who are still growing who present with Cobb angles greater than 30 degrees should be braced. However, these are guidelines and not every person will <b>fit</b> <b>into</b> <b>this</b> table. For example, a person who is still growing with a 17-degree Cobb angle and significant thoracic rotation or flatback could be considered for nighttime bracing. On {{the opposite end of the}} growth spectrum, a 29-degree Cobb angle and a Risser sign three or four might not need to be braced because there is reduced potential for progression. The Scoliosis Research Society's recommendations for bracing include curves progressing to larger than 25°, curves presenting between 30 and 45°, Risser sign 0, 1, or 2 (an X-ray measurement of a pelvic growth area), and less than six months from the onset of menses in girls.|$|E
25|$|During {{its network}} run, The Lawrence Welk Show aired on ABC on Saturday nights at 9 p.m. (Eastern Time), moving up a half-hour to 8:30p.m. {{in the fall}} of 1963. In fact, Welk headlined two weekly prime-time shows on ABC for three years. From 1956 to 1958, he hosted Top Tunes and New Talent, which aired on Monday nights. The series moved to Wednesdays {{in the fall of}} 1958 and was renamed The Plymouth Show, which ended in May 1959. During that time, the Saturday show was also known as The Dodge Dancing Party. During this period, the {{networks}} {{were in the process of}} eliminating programming that was seen as having either too old an audience, did not appeal to urban residents, or both (the so-called Rural Purge). As The Lawrence Welk Show <b>fit</b> <b>into</b> <b>this</b> category, ABC ended its run in 1971. Welk thanked ABC and the sponsors at the end of the last network show. The Lawrence Welk Show continued on as a first-run syndicated program shown on 250 stations across the country until the final original show was produced in 1982, when Welk decided to retire. While many longtime TV shows suffered a serious ratings drop during the counterculture movement of the late 1960s, The Lawrence Welk Show survived largely intact and even had increased viewership during this time.|$|E

500|$|Because Linx {{was only}} to operate {{profitable}} routes, {{it was decided that}} the company not take over the night train service from Oslo to Copenhagen. NSB stated that they wanted all inter-Scandinavian passenger transport to be operated by the new company, and therefore decided to terminate the night train as of September 2. Although the night trains were filled during the summer and parts of the winter, there was a low ridership {{during the rest of the}} year. However, it was a lack of engineers that forced NSB to terminate the night train service as of 20 June. There were protests against the ending of the service, particularly in Norway. Marketing Director Øyvind Rørslett of Linx stated that [...] "we are concentrating on the day trains. We want to develop a holistic concept, where new modern trains are a major part.

500|$|In {{spite of}} the lull in {{battleship}} building during the World War, the years 1919–1922 saw {{the threat of a}} renewed naval arms race between the United Kingdom, Japan, and the US. The Battle of Jutland exerted a huge influence over the designs produced in this period. The first ships which <b>fit</b> <b>into</b> <b>this</b> picture are the British , designed in 1916. Jutland finally persuaded the Admiralty that lightly armoured battlecruisers were too vulnerable, and therefore the final design of the Admirals incorporated much-increased armour, increasing displacement to 42,000 tons. The initiative in creating the new arms race lay with the Japanese and United States navies. The United States Naval Appropriations Act of 1916 authorized the construction of 156 new ships, including ten battleships and six battlecruisers. For the first time, the United States Navy was threatening the British global lead. This programme was started slowly (in part because of a desire to learn lessons from Jutland), and never fulfilled entirely. The new American ships (the s and s), took a qualitative step beyond the British Queen Elizabeth class and Admiral classes by mounting [...] guns.|$|E
