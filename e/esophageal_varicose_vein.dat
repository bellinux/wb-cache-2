40|$|Because of {{advances}} in the technology of gastrointestinal endoscopy and improvements {{in the quality of}} stents, it has become routine to place a stent as palliative therapy for malignant gastrointestinal obstruction. On the other hand, stent placement for malignant gastrointestinal hemorrhage has scarcely been reported, although it may be performed for hemorrhage of the <b>esophageal</b> <b>varicose</b> <b>vein.</b> We recently experienced a patient with refractory hemorrhage from an unresectable duodenal cancer who underwent placement of a self-expandable metallic stent (SEMS) and thereafter had no recurrence of the hemorrhage. A 46 -year-old man underwent laparotomy to radically resect a cancer in the third portion of the duodenum, which invaded widely to the superior mesenteric vein and its branches and was considered unresectable. After stomach-partitioning gastrojejunostomy was performed, chemotherapy was initiated according to the regimen of chemotherapy of far advanced gastric cancer. One year and 4 months after induction of chemotherapy, gastrointestinal hemorrhage occurred. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed the hemorrhage oozing from the duodenal cancer, and endoscopic hemostasis, such as injection of hypertonic saline epinephrine and argon plasma coagulation, was unsuccessful. Twenty days after emergence of the hemorrhage, an endoscopic covered SEMS was placed with confirmation by fluoroscopy. Immediately after placement of the stent, the tarry stool stopped and the anemia ceased to progress. The recurrence of the hemorrhage has not been confirmed without migration of the stent. SEMS is an effective hemostatic procedure for malignant refractory hemorrhage...|$|E

Purpose. Ascites, <b>esophageal</b> <b>varicose</b> <b>veins,</b> and acute digestive bleeding are unusual in the clinical presentation of chronic pancreatitis; however, these symptoms are frequently observed in patients with liver cirrhosis. Moreover, {{it is unlikely to}} observe chylous ascites in both presentations. Method. We report a patient who presented with chronic pancreatitis with splenic vein thrombosis, necrosis of the pancreatic neck and tail, <b>esophageal</b> <b>varicose</b> <b>veins</b> with previous bleeding, and chylous ascites. After partial pancreatectomy, his treatment was based on low-fat oral diet with medium-chain triglycerides with remarkable resolution of the chylous ascites. After 3 years, he presented with decompensated chronic pancreatitis and underwent plexus alcoholization and biliary-enteric deviation with an unremarkable postoperative course. Conclusion. Ascites is rarely associated with chronic pancreatitis, and chylous ascites is even rarer. The treatment of atraumatic chylous ascites is based on resolution of the obstructive causes and should include drainage and a low-fat diet with medium-chain triglycerides. 1...|$|R

Our proposition is to suggest a new term in Portuguese for this form of treatment: “Injeção Roncoplástica ” (Rhon-choplastic Injection). In medical practice, the term sclerotherapy is well established in naming the esthetic treatment of varices and telangiectasis; it may be used to describe numerous and distinct types of treatment, such as in the approach to thyroid cysts, hydroceles, cystic hygroma, hemangio-mas, venous malformations, <b>esophageal</b> <b>varicose</b> <b>veins...</b>|$|R
40|$|Thirty two {{children}} and adolescents from 14 to 20 years of age, suffering from hepatosplenic schistosomiasis mansoni and bleeding <b>esophageal</b> <b>varicose</b> <b>veins,</b> were evaluated for bone mineral density (BMD), before undergoing medical and surgical treatment. The surgical protocol was splenectomy, autoimplantation of spleen tissue into a pouch of the major omentum and ligature of the left gastric vein. Follow up of these patients? ranges from one to ten years {{with a mean of}} five years. The BMD was measured at the lumbar spine (L 2 - L 4) through the dual energy absorptionmetry X-ray (DEXA), using a LUNAR DPX-L densitometer. The degree of Symmers´ fibrosis was assessed by semiautomatic hystomorphometry. In eleven patients, the serum magnesium was measured before an intravenous overload of this ion and subsequently after eight and twenty four hours. Urine was collected 24 hours before and 24 hours after the magnesium overload. Deficiency of magnesium was considered when the uptake of this ion was greater than 40 %. There was a significant trend of association between the status of bone mineral content and the Symmers´ fibrosis degree (c² = 6. 606 R = 0. 01017). There was also a moderate agreement between the greater fibrosis densities (> the mean percentage) and bone mineral deficits. Although the normal bone mineral content was more found among the patients with better hepatic functional reserve, the results did not reach statistical significance. There was a marked magnesium retention (> 95 %) in one patient who had severe osteoporosis and a slight depletion (< 5 %) in another patient, who presented no bone mineral deficit. It was concluded that the patients included in this series, showed an important BMD deficit, specially among the females which has had a significant improvement after medical and surgical treatment. Bone mineral deficit was associated with the degree of Symmers´ fibrosis. Magnesium depletion was present in two out of eleven patients. It is speculated that magnesium supplementation may be warranted to forestall the progression of bone mineral deficit in patients with more impaired hepatic functional reserve...|$|R
40|$|Splenectomy in {{patients}} with cirrhosis presupposes an increase of blood inflow into portal system to decrease the portal pressure. At {{the same time there}} are different opinions about splenectomy. So it is actual to study the character of changes of blood flow in vessels of abdominal cavity in pre- and postsurgical periods and assessment of an influence of these changes on the clinical course of cirrhosis. Aim of research: To assess an influence of splenectomy on the character of changes of splanchnic hemodynamics {{in patients}} with cirrhosis comparing to non-operated patients with compensated and decompensated clinical course. Materials and methods: There were examined 190 patients with cirrhosis: gastrointestinal bleeding from oesophagus <b>varicose</b> <b>veins</b> took place in 133 patients, diuretic resistant ascites – in 57 ones. 19 patients underwent splenectomy: 7 – in association with sewing of the left gastric vein and artery, 6 – with “skeletonization” of the lesser curvature of stomach with Nessen’s operation, 2 – with Patsiora’s operation, 2 – with application of selective porto-caval shunt between the low mesenteric vein and the left vein of an ovary. 84 patients died during observation. The duration of observation was from 0. 5 to 3. 5 years. All patients underwent fibrogastroscopy every 3 – 4 month. Hemodynamics was assessed on the base of repeated ultrasound of abdominal cavity. There were assessed diameter of hepatic and splenic vessels; qualitative and quantitative characteristics of blood flow in hepatic and splenic arteries, portal and splenic veins. Results of research: Changes of hemodynamics in patients after splenectomy as opposed to non-operative patients are characterized with the decrease of diameter of portal vein at almost stable speed of the linear blood flow in it. The result is some decrease of the volume of portal blood and index of portal blood congestion that indirectly indicates the decrease of portal pressure after splenectomy. At the same time arterial hepatic blood flow stays without essential changes. At fibrogastroscopy there was noticed a decrease of <b>esophageal</b> <b>varicose</b> <b>veins</b> dilatation, its tension, elimination of «red signs” that is a prognostic marker of the menace of bleeding. There were noticed no one relapse of bleeding and the sign of refractory ascites during the period of observation. Conclusio: The changes of splanchnic hemodynamics after splenectomy are characterized with decrease of the volume of splanchnic blood. The result is a decrease of portal pressure that is proved with decrease of congestion index in portal vein, decrease of tension of <b>varicose</b> <b>veins,</b> elimination of “red signs” and consequently elimination of the menace of relapse of bleeding and development of resistant ascites. At the same time splectomy can be done {{in patients with}} decompensated clinical course of cirrhosis that is proved with an absence of lethality in postsurgical period</p...|$|R
40|$|ObjectiveThis {{study was}} {{designed}} to observe the clinical sequelae of <b>varicose</b> <b>veins</b> after great saphenous vein (GSV) ablation and to assess possible predictability of spontaneous <b>varicose</b> <b>vein</b> regression. MethodsPatients with symptomatic <b>varicose</b> <b>veins</b> secondary to GSV insufficiency treated with radiofrequency ablation (RFA) were enrolled in the study. Up to five of the largest <b>varicose</b> <b>veins</b> in each limb were mapped, sized, and documented before RFA. No <b>varicose</b> <b>vein</b> was treated either at the time of RFA or within 6 months postoperatively. <b>Varicose</b> <b>vein</b> status was recorded at follow-up visits. ResultsFifty-four limbs in 45 patients were included. A total of 222 <b>varicose</b> <b>veins</b> were documented before RFA (4. 1 ± 1. 1 <b>varicose</b> <b>veins</b> per limb) with an average size of 11. 4 ± 3. 7 mm. During the follow-up period, complete resolution of visible <b>varicose</b> <b>veins</b> was seen in 13 % of limbs after RFA alone, and 63 (28. 4 %) <b>varicose</b> <b>veins</b> spontaneously resolved. A further 88. 7 % (141 / 159) of <b>varicose</b> <b>veins</b> decreased in size an average of 34. 6 % (4. 3 ± 3. 4 mm). Preoperatively, 19. 4 % of <b>varicose</b> <b>veins</b> were above the knee and 75. 7 % were below the knee. Complete <b>varicose</b> <b>vein</b> resolution was 41. 9 % (18 / 43) above the knee and 25. 6 % (43 / 168) below the knee. For the above-knee <b>varicose</b> <b>veins,</b> 88. 4 % (38 / 43) were located medially, and all the resolved ones (47. 4 %, 18 / 38) were medial <b>varicose</b> <b>veins.</b> Resolution rates of the 168 below-knee <b>varicose</b> <b>veins</b> were 30. 6 % (33 / 108) of medial, 23. 1 % (6 / 26) of anterior, 20. 0 % (3 / 15) of lateral, and 5. 3 % (1 / 19) of posterior. ConclusionsGreat saphenous vein ablation resulted in subsequent resolution or regression of many lower-limb visible <b>varicose</b> <b>veins.</b> With further study, the predictability of <b>varicose</b> <b>vein</b> regression may perhaps be increased, which can then direct the treatment strategy to further leverage the advantages of minimally invasive endovenous procedures...|$|R

The aim was to look for an association between perforators and recurrent <b>varicose</b> <b>veins.</b> Methods: a consecutive group of patients presenting with <b>varicose</b> <b>veins</b> were examined using colour duplex ultrasonography by an experienced vascular technologist. Pathological perforating veins were defined as those exhibiting bi-directional flow and a diameter of 4 mm or greater at the fascia. Results: between September 1998 and July 1999, 204 patients were examined. Primary <b>varicose</b> <b>veins</b> were found in 198 legs (135 patients) and recurrent <b>varicose</b> <b>veins</b> in 91 legs (69 patients). In patients with primary <b>varicose</b> <b>veins,</b> 88 (44 %) had incompetent perforators compared to 57 (63 %) of those with recurrent <b>varicose</b> <b>veins</b> (Chi-squared, p < 0. 005). Also, for recurrent <b>varicose</b> <b>veins,</b> the percentage of patients with any given number of incompetent perforators was higher than for primary <b>varicose</b> <b>veins.</b> Overall, there was a higher number of incompetent perforators in those with recurrent veins compared to primary veins and this difference was significant at 95 % confidence interval.

40|$|Background: The {{cosmetic}} treatment of <b>varicose</b> <b>veins</b> {{is the main}} activity of most vascular surgeons in Brazil. In order to obtain satisfactory cosmetic results, careful planning of <b>varicose</b> <b>vein</b> operations is necessary. Objective: Marking (or "mapping") the <b>varicose</b> <b>veins</b> with indelible ink is an essential step in planning cosmetic surgeries for lower limb <b>varicose</b> <b>veins.</b> In the present study, the role of transcutaneous phleboscopy (TcPh) in planning <b>varicose</b> <b>vein</b> operations is evaluated. Methods: A series of 100 consecutive patients, all female, were evaluated with TcPH {{as part of their}} <b>varicose</b> <b>vein</b> operations planning. A total of 171 limbs with <b>varicose</b> <b>veins</b> (71 bilateral and 29 unilateral) were evaluated. The process of marking the <b>varicose</b> <b>veins</b> followed the same protocol in all cases. Firstly, the <b>varicose</b> <b>veins</b> were marked by inspection and palpation, with the patient standing, using an indelible black ink pen. Secondly, with the patients resting in supine and prone positions, the <b>varicose</b> <b>veins</b> detected with TcPh were marked again with red or blue ink. The marks made by the two methods were then compared. Results: In 41 patients, for a total of 80 limbs (46. 8 %), the marks were altered after use of TcPh. Reasons for such changes were: 1) identification of other varicose veins; 2) identification of reticular veins draining complex telangiectasias; and 3) changes in the position of the marks placed with the patient standing. Conclusions: TcPh has altered the planning of <b>varicose</b> <b>vein</b> surgeries in 46. 8 % of all limbs evaluated, especially when the patients had complex telangiectasias, associated with reticular <b>varicose</b> <b>veins...</b>|$|R

A concomitant decrease in collagen III was observed in cultures of smooth muscle cells from <b>varicose</b> <b>veins.</b> The increase in the synthesis of collagen I in cells from <b>varicose</b> <b>veins</b> was correlated with an over-expression of the gene since mRNAs for collagen I were augmented without change in mRNA-half-life.

40|$|ObjectiveThe {{theory of}} primary venous {{dilatation}} leading to secondary valvular incompetence and <b>varicose</b> <b>vein</b> formation {{has received more}} attention nowadays. Although many studies have investigated {{the role of the}} main components of the venous wall in the development of <b>varicose</b> <b>veins,</b> the leading cause remains unknown. The present study was designed to establish the role of smooth muscle cells (SMCs) of the tunica media on the pathogenesis of <b>varicose</b> <b>veins</b> by analyzing the phenotypic and functional differences between SMCs derived from <b>varicose</b> <b>veins</b> and normal veins. MethodsSMCs were isolated and cultured from saphenous veins of patients with <b>varicose</b> <b>veins</b> and normal veins. Cell proliferation and migration rates were compared. Expression of phenotype-dependent markers and matrix metalloproteinase- 2 (MMP) production were analyzed by immunoblotting. Total collagen synthesis was evaluated by measuring the radioactivity of L-[3, 4 - 3 H]proline in the media and the cell layer. ResultsSMCs derived from <b>varicose</b> <b>veins</b> demonstrated increased proliferation (2 -fold, P 2 -fold, P <. 001), with decreased expression of phenotype-dependent markers compared with SMCs derived from normal veins (P <. 05). ConclusionSMCs derived from <b>varicose</b> <b>veins</b> are more dedifferentiated and demonstrate increased proliferative and synthetic capacity than SMCs derived from normal veins.

50|$|<b>Varicose</b> <b>veins</b> are veins {{that have}} become {{enlarged}} and twisted. The term commonly refers to the veins on the leg, although <b>varicose</b> <b>veins</b> can occur elsewhere. Veins have pairs of leaflet valves to prevent blood from flowing backwards (retrograde flow or venous reflux). Leg muscles pump the veins to return blood to the heart (the skeletal-muscle pump), against the effects of gravity. When <b>veins</b> become <b>varicose,</b> the leaflets of the valves no longer meet properly, and the valves do not work (valvular incompetence). This allows blood to flow backwards and they enlarge even more. <b>Varicose</b> <b>veins</b> are most common in the superficial veins of the legs, which are subject to high pressure when standing. Besides being a cosmetic problem, <b>varicose</b> <b>veins</b> can be painful, especially when standing. Severe long-standing <b>varicose</b> <b>veins</b> can lead to leg swelling, venous eczema, skin thickening (lipodermatosclerosis) and ulceration. Although life-threatening complications are uncommon, <b>varicose</b> <b>veins</b> may be confused with deep vein thrombosis, which may be life-threatening.|$|R

Compared with the control cohort, there was an elevated risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the <b>varicose</b> <b>veins</b> cohort (rate ratio 1. 20; 95 % confidence interval 1. 08 - 1. 33) but not in the haemorrhoids cohort (0. 90; 0. 78 - 1. 03). No other circulatory diseases showed significantly elevated risks associated with <b>varicose</b> <b>veins</b> or haemorrhoids. The rate ratio for coronary heart disease in the <b>varicose</b> <b>veins</b> cohort was 0. 91 (95 % confidence interval 0. 88 - 0. 95) and that in the haemorrhoids cohort was 0. 98 (0. 94 - 1. 03). We conclude that neither <b>varicose</b> <b>veins</b> nor haemorrhoids showed strong association, either positive or negative, with other circulatory diseases. There was a significant, but numerically modest, elevated risk of DVT associated with <b>varicose</b> <b>veins.</b> The risk of coronary heart disease in people with <b>varicose</b> <b>veins</b> was, if anything, a bit low...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: In the {{treatment}} of portal hypertension in pediatric patients, some type of porto-systemic shunt is indicated, which is an unusual surgical procedure in patients under two years of age, due to the low incidence of this disease at this age {{and the increase in}} the number of complications. Objective: We present our experience and results with this procedure in patients under two years of age seen in the Hepatobiliopancreatic general surgery service at Instituto Nacional de PediatríaDiscussion: The causes of portal hypertension in children are varied. Among the extrahepatic causes, the most common is cavernomatous portal degeneration. Children with portal hypertension under two years have severe symptoms such as recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding or anemia; others have hypersplenism data. In many cases medical management is useless and a surgical procedure require such as a portosystemic shunt in order to decrease the size of <b>varicose</b> <b>esophageal</b> <b>veins</b> and prevent bleeding that threatens the patient’s life. Conclusion: The iliac-mesenteric-caval shunt in patients under two years is a feasible alternative that improves the clinical status of the patient, reducing the risk of bleeding. However long-term studies are needed to determine the outcome of these patients. Keywords: Iliac-mesenteric-caval shunt, portal hypertension...|$|R
50|$|<b>Varicose</b> <b>veins</b> {{are more}} common in women than in men, and are linked with heredity. Other related factors are pregnancy, obesity, menopause, aging, {{prolonged}} standing, leg injury and abdominal straining. <b>Varicose</b> <b>veins</b> {{are unlikely to be}} caused by crossing the legs or ankles. Less commonly, but not exceptionally, <b>varicose</b> <b>veins</b> can be due to other causes, as post phlebitic obstruction or incontinence, venous and arteriovenous malformations.|$|R
40|$|Lower limb <b>varicose</b> <b>veins</b> are {{a common}} {{complication}} of bipedal human movement and deep-vein thrombosis. However, they may have unusual causes, e. g. forming as collaterals around an obstruction or resulting from vascular malformations. Surgery in these cases can be inappropriate or harmful. Five cases of lower limb <b>varicose</b> <b>veins</b> {{in which there was}} underlying pathology highlight the fact that cursory examination of patients with <b>varicose</b> <b>veins</b> and inappropriate special investigations can miss rare but significant underlying pathology. Patients should be examined systematically, and <b>varicose</b> <b>veins</b> in unusual situations should alert the clinician. Inappropriate surgery can be harmful. [URL]...|$|R
40|$|In <b>varicose</b> <b>vein</b> surgery, {{significant}} postoperative morbidity {{results from}} subcutaneous haematoma formation and limb swelling after saphenous vein stripping. We investigated {{the effectiveness of}} a high-compression short-stretch adhesive bandage compared with non-adhesive crêpe in reducing haemorrhage after stripping of <b>varicose</b> <b>veins.</b> Using 99 mTc-labelled red blood cells, the degree of postoperative bleeding was assessed in 10 patients with bilateral <b>varicose</b> <b>veins</b> allocated for stripping and ligation. High-compression adhesive bandaging was applied to the experimental limb and a non-adhesive bandage to the contralateral control limb. Results show that adequate compression bandaging can decrease subcutaneous haematoma formation after stripping of <b>varicose</b> <b>veins...</b>|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the contribution of progesterone in the development of primary <b>varicose</b> <b>veins</b> on lower limbs during pregnancy. In 50 primiparae with <b>varicose</b> <b>veins,</b> serum progesterone level was quantitatively determined in the 14 th week of pregnancy and results were compared with those obtained in a control group of 25 primiparae without visible <b>varicose</b> <b>veins.</b> The mean serum progesterone concentration recorded in pregnant women with dilated veins (159. 9 ± 15. 8 nmol/L) was significantly higher as compared with the control group (159. 9 ± 15. 8 nmol/L vs. 40. 4 ± 1. 6 nmol/L; P< 0. 0001). These findings supported the role of hormonal factor in the development of <b>varicose</b> <b>veins</b> in women. KEY WORDS: <b>varicose</b> <b>veins,</b> pregnant women, progesteron...|$|R
40|$|TIPSS (transjugular {{intrahepatic}} portosystemic shunt) may be {{indicated to}} control bleeding from <b>esophageal</b> and gastric <b>varicose</b> <b>veins,</b> to reduce ascites, and to treat patients with Budd-Chiari syndrome and veno-occlusive disease. Numerous measures {{to improve the}} safety and methodology of the procedure have helped to increase the technical and clinical success. Follow-up of TIPSS patients has revealed shunt stenosis to occur more often in patients with preserved liver function (Child A, Child B). In addition, the extent of Liver cirrhosis is the main factor that determines prognosis in the long term. Little {{is known about the}} effects of TIPSS with respect to portosystemic hemodynamics. This report deals with a cirrhotic patient who stopped drinking 7 months prior to admission. He received TIPSS to control ascites and recurrent esophageal bleeding. Two years later remarkable hypertrophy of the left liver lobe and shunt occlusion was observed. The portosysterific pressure gradient dropped from 24 mmHg before TIPSS to 11 mmHg and remained stable after shunt occlusion. The Child's B cirrhosis prior to TIPSS turned into Child's A cirrhosis and remained stable during the follow-up period of 32 months. This indicates that liver function of TIPSS patients may recover due to hypertrophy of the remaining non-cirrhotic liver tissue. In addition the hepatic hemodynamics may return to normal. In conclusion, TIPSS cannot cure cirrhosis but its progress may be halted if the cause can be removed. This may result in a normal portosystemic gradient, leading consequently to shunt occlusion...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjective {{the ability}} of colour duplex to {{accurately}} locate incompetent venous sites has been widely published; its value in pre-operative marking in simple primary <b>varicose</b> <b>vein</b> surgery is evaluated in this study. Design of study prospective randomised controlled trial. Setting regional vascular service, hospital patients. Subjects consecutive patients (149) undergoing primary <b>varicose</b> <b>vein</b> surgery where the only difference was one group of patients received duplex marking prior to surgery. Six weeks and 12 months post-operatively all patients had a colour duplex scan to determine the accuracy of surgery {{and the presence of}} residual/recurrent <b>varicose</b> <b>veins</b> and completed the Aberdeen, SF- 36, and EuroQol quality of life questionnaires. Interventions <b>varicose</b> <b>vein</b> surgery. Main outcome measures Duplex evidence of venous incompetence, quality of life measures using the SF- 36 and Aberdeen <b>Varicose</b> <b>Veins</b> Questionnaire. Results pre-operative marking of primary <b>varicose</b> <b>veins</b> by skilled duplex ultrasonography does not improve the accuracy or recurrence rate following surgery. Quality of life improved significantly following surgery in both groups, however {{there was no difference in}} this improvement between the groups.
