40|$|International audienceThe Northern Mediterranean Current is {{the return}} {{branch of the}} {{cyclonic}} circulation of the northwestern Mediterranean Sea. Because of geostrophic constraints, this warm and oligotrophic current is forced to flow westward along the continental slope <b>of</b> the <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> <b>Lion.</b> But, occasionally, it penetrates on the shelf and strongly impacts the local biogeochemistry and in turn the primary production. By combining in situ observations and high-resolution modelling, it is shown that intrusions on the eastern part <b>of</b> the <b>gulf</b> are mainly forced by easterly or northwesterly wind events, through physical mechanisms that are very different in nature. Easterlies induce a piling of water along the <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> <b>Lion</b> coast that drives, through geostrophy, an alongshore shelf-intruding current. This intrusive current occurs independently of the stratification and is concomitant with the wind forcing. On the other hand, intrusions due to northwesterlies only occur during stratified conditions and {{are related to the}} development of upwellings along the <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> <b>Lion</b> coasts. When the upwelling develops, a northwestward alongshore pressure force balances the Coriolis force associated with the onshore flow at depth. When the winds drop, the upwelling relaxes and the onshore flow weakens. Consequently, the Coriolis force no longer counterbalances the pressure force that ultimately dominates the momentum balance, causing the displacement of the Northern Current on the <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> <b>Lion</b> shelf approximately 1 day after the wind relaxation. This time lag between the northwesterlies decrease and the intrusions permits to anticipate possible changes in the biogeochemistry <b>of</b> the <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> <b>Lion...</b>|$|R

This method consists of a comparison between core and modern sample assemblages assuming that similar planktonic foraminifer assemblages develop under the same ecological conditions and that foraminifer ecological preferences have not changed in time.

It was shown that a pre-modeling period of 7 days before beginning the forecast allows the growth of the small scales. The embedded forecasts have been compared to the MFS observing system. It was basically found that in the North-Western Mediterranean, the MFS basin-scale model and thus the regional model forecasts are characterized by large negative biases of salinity in the first 100 m under the surface leading thus to too light subsurface waters. The underestimation of temperature by the regional model just below the surface and its overestimation at 30 m deep can be associated to an overestimation of the turbulent mixing. The regional and coastal models allow to represent a number of processes especially those induced by the wind as coastal upwelling under stratified conditions, dense water formation over the <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> <b>Lion</b> shelf, deep mixing in the convection zone or influence on the Northern Current penetration in the <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> <b>Lion...</b>|$|R
40|$|The role of eddies on the {{formation}} and spreading of water masses in the Western Mediterranean Sea is studied with an ocean general circulation model. The model is forced with interannually variable surface forcing for the years from 1979 to 1999. It is found that the model reproduces the major features of the observed mesoscale variability in the <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> <b>Lions</b> and the large eddies evolution in the Algerian Basin. The seasonal evolution of circulation in the <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> <b>Lions</b> and processes of spreading of newly formed intermediate deep waters in the postconvection period is studied for years 1987 and 1992. The model results are compared with data from observations. It is shown that the instability of the transition zone between old and newly formed deep waters, which takes place after the violent mixing stages of the deep convection, leads to collapse of the mixed patch and formation of mesoscale eddies. Some of these eddies propagate out of the <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> <b>Lions</b> transporting deep waters into the Algerian Basin. The rest of the mesoscale eddies filled with newly formed deep waters remain in the <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> <b>Lions</b> and tend to merge and enlarge. After the cyclonic eddies reach the Algerian Basin they interact with the intense mesoscale field existing there. The energy analysis shows that the winter and spring are seasons of intensified baroclinic instability of the mean flow in the two regions of interest, the <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> <b>Lions</b> and Algerian Basin. The kinetic energy is released by baroclinic instability in spring and summer. The spring spectra in the two regions have maximums at horizontal scales of about 80 - 100 km which is the typical scale of the eddies in the model. These eddies propagate a cyclonic circuit.

Results show that the 3 main benthic communities identified in 1998 were still present in 2010 although their composition changed. Using only year and station of sampling we found a significant space-time interaction explaining changes in macrofaunal community composition, and, in this study, stations differ primarily in terms of depth and distance to the Rhône river mouth. Temporal changes in benthic macrofauna composition were clearly most important at shallow stations (i. e., in the Littoral Fine Sand community) than at deep ones (i. e., Terrigenous Coastal Mud community). These results are in good agreement with the current paradigm according to which climatic oscillations such as NAO (North Atlantic Oscillation) and WeMO (Western Mediterranean Oscillation) are indirectly (i. e., through changes {{in the frequency of}} occurrence and the intensity of storms) controlling benthic macrofauna composition in the <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> <b>Lions.</b> This hypothesis is further supported by a meta-analysis of changes in the average and maximal yearly abundances of the polychaete Ditrupa arietina.

40|$|International audienceAn {{interdisciplinary}} {{study was}} conducted to evaluate the relationship between geological and paleoenvironmental parameters and the bacterial and archaeal community structure of two contrasting subseafloor sites in the Western Mediterranean Sea (Ligurian Sea and <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> <b>Lion).</b> Both depositional environments in this area are well-documented from paleoclimatic and paleooceanographic point of views. Available data sets allowed us to calibrate the investigated cores with reference and dated cores previously collected in the same area, and notably correlated to Quaternary climate variations. DNA-based fingerprints showed that the archaeal diversity was composed by one group, Miscellaneous Crenarchaeotic Group (MCG), within the <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> <b>Lion</b> sediments and <b>of</b> nine different lineages (dominated by MCG, South African Gold Mine Euryarchaeotal Group (SAGMEG) and Halobacteria) within the Ligurian Sea sediments. Bacterial molecular diversity at both sites revealed mostly the presence of the classes Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria within Proteobacteria phylum, and also members of Bacteroidetes phylum. The second most abundant lineages were Actinobacteria and Firmicutes at the <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> <b>Lion</b> site and Chloroflexi at the Ligurian Sea site. Various substrates and cultivation conditions allowed us to isolate 75 strains belonging to four lineages: Alpha-, Gammaproteobacteria, Firmicutes and Actinobacteria. In molecular surveys, the Betaproteobacteria group was consistently detected in the Ligurian Sea sediments, characterized by a heterolithic facies with numerous turbidites from a deep-sea levee. Analysis of relative betaproteobacterial abundances and turbidite frequency suggested that the microbial diversity was a result of main climatic changes occurring during the last 20 ka. Statistical direct multivariate canonical correspondence analyses (CCA) showed that the availability of electron acceptors and the quality of electron donors (indicated by age) strongly influenced the community structure. In contrast, within the <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> <b>Lion</b> core, characterized by a homogeneous lithological structure of upper-slope environment, most detected groups were Bacteroidetes and, to a lesser extent, Betaproteobacteria. At both site, the detection of Betaproteobacteria coincided with increased terrestrial inputs, as confirmed by the geochemical measurements (Si, Sr, Ti and Ca). In the <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> <b>Lion,</b> geochemical parameters were also found to drive microbial community composition. Taken together, our data suggest that the palaeoenvironmental history of erosion and deposition recorded in the Western Mediterranean Sea sediments has left its imprint on the sedimentological context for microbial habitability, and then indirectly on structure and composition of the microbial communities during the late Quaternary...|$|R

40|$|A coupled hydrodynamic-biogeochemical {{modelling}} {{is developed}} to address main mechanisms that drive the {{particulate organic carbon}} (POC) deposition in the <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> <b>Lions</b> (NW-Mediterranean). Low-salinity water (LSW, salinity < 37. 5) lenses detached from the Rhone River plume under specific wind conditions tend to favour the biological productivity and provide a good opportunity for validating a planktonic ecosystem modelling. A specific calibration dedicated to river plume ecosystems is then proposed and validated using in situ measurements within such LSW lens (BIOPRHOFI cruise – May 2006) and on the <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> <b>Lions.</b> During spring 2006, the POC deposition is maximal on the prodelta area and within the coastal area in the <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> <b>Lions.</b> Organic detritus mostly contribute to the total POC deposition (82 – 92 %) whereas the contribution of living organisms (microphytoplankton) appears lower than 17 %. Exploring both influences of terrestrial inputs from the Rhone River and planktonic ecosystems on the POC deposition on the shelf, we estimated that the contribution of terrestrial POM inputs to the total POC deposition is lower than 17 % at the shelf scale during the study period, with maxima during peak discharges of the Rhone River. The main deposition area of terrestrial POC {{is found in the}} vicinity of the river mouth in agreement with sediment data. On the other hand, a remarkable influence of marine biological processes on the POC deposition is highlighted further on the shelf (from 60 to 80 m depth). A tight feedback between zooplankton and POM contents in the water column is proposed to explain the control of POC deposition by zooplankton: terrestrial POM inputs would favour the development of living organisms through photosynthesis and grazing processes increasing the retention of organic matter within the food web. By favouring the development of large-sized zooplankton, LSW lenses may have paradoxically a negative impact on the carbon deposition on the shelf. In the same way, peak discharges of the Rhone River finally increase the gradient of POC deposition between the prodelta and the offshore area in the <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> <b>Lions.</b> The biogenic elements from the Rhone River are then exported further offshore through advection of zooplankton communities on the <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> <b>Lions</b> shelf...|$|E
40|$|The role of mesoscales on the {{formation}} and spreading of water masses in the Western Mediterranean Sea (WMED) is studied with an ocean general circulation model (OGCM). The model is forced with inter- annually variable surface forcing for the years from 1979 to 1999. The simulations are compared with some recent observational studies of the mesoscale processes in the WMED. It is found that the model reproduces the major features of the observed mesoscale variability during the preconditioning of the deep convection in the <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> <b>Lions</b> and also the large mesoscale eddies evolution in the Algerian Basin. Thus the model is used to study the deep convection in the <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> <b>Lions</b> and the processes of spreading of deep waters after the convection period. The simulations suggest that the flow structure during the preconditioning period {{is dominated by the}} Ligurian- Provencal Current in the surface and intermediate layers, which intensifies, meanders and forms a mesoscale vortex over the Rhone fan. In the deep layers the density structures due to the old deep waters tend to organise in (deep) mesoscale cyclonic eddies. The instability of the transition zone between old and newly formed deep waters, which takes place after the violent mixing stages of the deep convection, leads to collapse of the mixed patch and formation of mesoscale eddies. Some of these eddies propagate out of the <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> <b>Lions</b> transporting deep waters into the Algerian Basin. The rest of the mesoscale eddies filled with newly formed deep waters remain in the <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> <b>Lions,</b> and tend to merge, enlarge and reorganise in an area with two or three large cyclonic eddies. After the cyclonic eddies reach the Algerian Basin they interact with the intense mesoscale field existing there. The model data together with the available satellite SLA data reveal a regular westward propagation of mesoscale eddies in the Northern Algerian Basin. This transport together with southward propagation of mesoscale eddies out of the <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> <b>Lions</b> is suggesting that the intermediate and deep waters of the WMED are transported westward by mesoscale eddies.
