5|$|In 1924, {{the segment}} of the Theodore Roosevelt International Highway within New York was {{designated}} NY3. At that time, it spanned the full eastwest length of the state, extending from the eastern bank of the Niagara River in North Tonawanda to {{the western edge of}} Lake Champlain in Plattsburgh; however, the routing through the North Country was significantly different at that time from <b>its</b> <b>modern</b> alignment. The route was moved onto <b>its</b> <b>modern</b> routing east of Watertown as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York; it was truncated to Sterling on its western end and rerouted to follow its current alignment from Sterling to Watertown roughly five years later.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1940s, US9 was rerouted {{to follow}} <b>its</b> <b>modern</b> {{alignment}} through Champlain, creating a lengthy overlap between NY348 and US9 from Chazy hamlet to Champlain village. The overlaps with both US9 and US11 were eliminated {{in the early}} 1960s after NY348 was truncated on its northern end to its junction with US9 in Chazy.|$|E
5|$|NY86 was {{established}} in the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, largely replacing a realigned NY3. North of Saranac Lake, NY86 initially followed modern NY186 before being rerouted onto <b>its</b> <b>modern</b> alignment. The portion of NY86 north of Harrietstown was once NY192.|$|E

5|$|Other related breeds {{included}} George Campbell, 8th Duke of Argyll's Roseneath Terrier and Dr. Americ Edwin Flaxman's Pittenweem Terriers. This {{breed of}} small white Scottish terriers was given <b>its</b> <b>modern</b> {{name for the}} first time in 1908, with recognition by major kennel clubs occurring around the same time.|$|E
5|$|Sabong or cockfighting {{is another}} popular {{entertainment}} especially among Filipino men, and existed {{prior to the}} arrival of the Spanish. Antonio Pigafetta, Magellan's chronicler, first documented this pastime in the kingdom of Taytay. The yo-yo, a popular toy in the Philippines, was introduced in <b>its</b> <b>modern</b> form by Pedro Flores with its name coming from the Ilocano language.|$|E
5|$|The White House today {{serves as}} a hotel and {{has a number of}} conference rooms on the ground floor, {{following}} extensive renovations in the 1990s.

5|$|The southernmost {{section of}} the road {{was known as the}} White Plains Post Road in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, a major highway {{connecting}} New York City to White Plains, the Westchester county seat. Route22 in <b>its</b> <b>modern</b> form was established in 1930 as one of the principal routes from New York City to Canada.|$|E
5|$|When {{the first}} set of posted routes in New York were {{assigned}} in 1924, the Oneonta–Grand Gorge segment of legislative Route5 and all of Route47 became part of NY23, which continued east from Catskill to the Massachusetts state line southwest of Great Barrington, Massachusetts. It initially overlapped with NY10 (later US9W) northward along modern NY385 to Athens, where it crossed the Hudson River via a ferry to Hudson. It continued east from Hudson on what is now NY23B to Claverack, where it joined <b>its</b> <b>modern</b> alignment to Massachusetts. NY23 was extended westward to NY12 in Norwich in the mid-1920s. In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, NY23 was extended west along a previously unnumbered roadway to NY26 in northwest Chenango County. From Norwich to North Pharsalia, NY23 followed <b>its</b> <b>modern</b> alignment; between North Pharsalia and NY26, NY23 was routed on modern CR42.|$|E

5|$|As a state highway, M-44 {{dates back}} to around July 1, 1919, and it was routed along a section of <b>its</b> <b>modern</b> route at that time. The eastern end was altered in the late 1920s, and the western end was {{extended}} to the Grand Rapids area in the 1970s. For over 20years, M-44 was truncated to remove the M-37 concurrency. Since 2003 though, the highway has terminated at the intersection with 28th Street.|$|E
5|$|British {{nationality}} law as it {{pertains to}} Hong Kong has been unusual ever since Hong Kong became a British colony in 1842. From its beginning as a sparsely populated trading port to <b>its</b> <b>modern</b> role as a cosmopolitan international financial centre of over seven million people, the territory has attracted refugees, immigrants and expatriates alike searching for a new life.|$|E
5|$|Constructed in {{the side}} of a disused chalk quarry, the most {{prominent}} feature of the complex is an immense concrete dome, to which <b>its</b> <b>modern</b> name refers. It was built above a network of tunnels housing storage areas, launch facilities and crew quarters. The facility was designed to store a large stockpile of V-2s, warheads and fuel and was intended to launch V-2s on an industrial scale. Dozens of missiles a day were to be fuelled, prepared and launched in rapid sequence against London and southern England.|$|E

5|$|From {{a base of}} {{territory}} in eastern Scotland north of the River Forth {{and south of the}} River Oykel, the kingdom acquired control of the lands lying to the north and south. By the 12th century, the kings of Alba had added to their territories the English-speaking land in the south-east and attained overlordship of Gaelic-speaking Galloway and Norse-speaking Caithness; {{by the end of the}} 13th century, the kingdom had assumed approximately <b>its</b> <b>modern</b> borders. However, processes of cultural and economic change beginning in the 12th century ensured Scotland looked very different in the later Middle Ages.|$|E
5|$|Hellblazer {{boosted the}} {{popularity}} and {{image of the}} occult detective fiction genre and shaped it to <b>its</b> <b>modern</b> form. Many modern examples of the genre such as Hellboy, Supernatural, Grimm, The Originals, and The Dresden Files {{have been influenced by}} it, and many imitators of both the series and its character flourished such as Criminal Macabre, Gravel, Planetary, and others. Its elements and style have been used countless of times in other works and many analogues of the cynical John Constantine have appeared.|$|E
5|$|In 1929, the routing from Allegan to Martin {{was removed}} and renumbered M-118, and M-40 was {{extended}} to the north out of Allegan along M-89 and <b>its</b> <b>modern</b> routing to a new terminus in Holland ending at US31. By the middle of 1960, the US131 was opened {{as far south as}} Martin; the section of M-118 between the new freeway and the old routing was used as a connector until the next section south to Plainwell opened the next year. After this next freeway segment was opened, M-118 was truncated to end at the freeway.|$|E

5|$|In the 1930 {{renumbering}} {{of state}} highways in New York, NY48 {{was assigned to}} a previously unnumbered roadway between downtown Syracuse and Oswego. From Van Buren north to Oswego, NY48 roughly followed <b>its</b> <b>modern</b> alignment; south of Van Buren, NY48 was routed on State Fair Boulevard and Geddes Street to terminate at NY5, then routed on Erie Boulevard. The route was realigned slightly within Syracuse between 1938 and 1940 to use portions of Hiawatha Boulevard and West Genesee Street (as well as a new portion of State Fair Boulevard) to meet NY5 at the modern intersection of Erie Boulevard and Genesee Street.|$|E
5|$|In the 1930 renumbering, NY28 was {{extended}} south from Colliersville to Kingston largely {{by way of}} its current alignment along the Ulster and Delaware Turnpike. North of Cooperstown, the route was realigned to follow <b>its</b> <b>modern</b> routing between Cooperstown and Mohawk, then extended into the North Country through Wevertown to Warrensburg along its present alignment. Between Colliersville and Cooperstown, the route remained unchanged. The small portion of NY10A that did not become part of NY28 in the renumbering was incorporated into NY10.|$|E
