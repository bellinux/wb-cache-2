5|$|As {{they return}} to the human world, Yusuke is {{stripped}} of his detective title as King Enma orders he be captured and executed in fear that Yusuke's demon blood could cause him {{to go on a}} rampage in the human world. Yusuke, unsettled at having been controlled by his ancestor Raizen, accepts an offer by Raizen's followers to return to the Demon Plane. Raizen, desiring a successor to his territory, is on the brink of dying of starvation, a death that would topple the delicate political balance of the three ruling powers of the Demon Plane. Hiei and Kurama are summoned by the other two rulers, Mukuro and Yomi, respectively, to prepare for an inevitable war. The three protagonists train in the realm for one year, during which time Raizen dies and Yusuke inherits his territory. Yusuke takes initiative and proposes a fighting tournament to name the true ruler of the Demon Plane, which is agreed upon by Mukuro and Yomi. During the tournament, Yusuke and Yomi meet in the second elimination round where Yusuke is defeated and knocked unconscious. Yusuke awakens days later to find that the tournament has ended and that a similar competition is to be held every so often to determine the Demon Plane's ruler. Yusuke stays in the Demon Plane <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>longer,</b> but eventually returns to the human world after several years to be with Keiko.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the treaty}} with France, Turkish forces in {{southern}} Anatolia continued to support Hananu's rebels with arms <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>longer</b> {{to pressure the}} French further and gain more leverage in negotiations over territorial concessions. At {{this point in the}} revolt, the rebels were in control of the villages of the Harim, Antioch, Jisr al-Shughur, Idlib and Maarrat al-Nu'man districts, but not the towns themselves. The French and Hananu entered into negotiations in the village of Kurin near Idlib in April, but they faltered. By order of the French Mandate's High Commissioner, Henri Gouraud, the French reinforced their military presence in the greater Aleppo region in April, and their columns defeated Hananu's rebels in a number of confrontations during this period. By April, the French had over 20,000 troops in southern Anatolia and northern Syria, with over 5,000 troops in Aleppo, 4,500 in the Idlib district, 1,000 in Qatma and 5,000 in the Antioch region. In May, French troops commanded by General Goubeau pursued Mawali and Sbaa Bedouin rebels after they launched several attacks against the highway between Homs and Hama. The Mawali surrendered after French aerial bombardments against their encampments in Qatara on 21 May.|$|E

25|$|Tait {{injured his}} {{shoulder}} {{ahead of the}} Super Series against the ICC World XI, {{and as a result}} was ruled out of playing any of the matches.

25|$|The Kangaroos {{never forgot}} the {{territory}} that {{started it all}} and worked in Canada off and on over the years.

25|$|When the EEF {{advanced}} {{out of the}} Sinai {{and into}} Palestine, the change in terrain led to the disbandment of the ICC. In June 1918, the Australian troops were used to form the 14th and 15th Light Horse Regiments. The New Zealand troops formed the 2nd New Zealand Machine Gun Squadron. All three units {{became part of the}} 5th Light Horse Brigade. The six British companies remained part of the ICC <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>longer.</b> Two of them fought with T.E.

25|$|Build 5048 (built on April 1, 2005) was the {{official}} WinHEC 2005 preview build, {{described as the}} Longhorn Developer Preview, and made available to WinHEC attendees on April 24, 2005. It was the only build from this time period that was made available by Microsoft; it was not officially distributed outside of WinHEC, but the build quickly appeared on file sharing networks. The Aero visual style made its first appearance in this build, and the Desktop Window Manager was present but disabled and hidden by default. At the keynote presentation, Bill Gates also announced {{that many of the}} WinFX developer APIs that were originally planned exclusively for Longhorn were going to be backported to Windows XP and Server 2003, and that the final user interface for Longhorn would not be seen <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>longer.</b> Other features such as device-independent resolutions, rasterized icons, virtual folders, and registry virtualization were discussed as well.|$|E
500|$|Eventually Butler's {{leadership}} {{style and the}} directness of actions undermined his support within the community. His departure seemed imminent. Mayor Kendrick reported to the press, [...] "I {{had the guts to}} bring General Butler to Philadelphia and I have the guts to fire him." [...] Feeling that his duties in Philadelphia were coming to an end, Butler contacted General Lejeune to prepare for his return to the Marine Corps. Not all of the city felt he was doing a bad job, though, and when the news started to break that he would be leaving, people began to gather at the Academy of Music. A group of 4,000 supporters assembled and negotiated a truce between him and the mayor to keep him in Philadelphia <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>longer,</b> and the president authorized a one-year extension.|$|E

500|$|According {{to his own}} account, he {{initially}} hid in a large bush, but decided this was too obvious, and so moved to a smaller one. A German patrol arrived, examined the original bush, and attacked it with bursts of automatic gunfire before leaving. [...] "Somebody was {{keeping an eye on}} me when I thought I'd better get out of that bush..." [...] he later told Phillippa Berlyn. The area in which he had landed was predominantly anti-German, and largely under the control of pro-Allied Italian partisans; one of these saw Smith's descent and retrieved his parachute to stop the Germans from finding it. Smith hid <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>longer</b> before emerging to greet a boy of about 12. The boy, Leo, knew no English; using sign language, he told Smith to sit and wait, and shortly returned with his elder brother, Lorenzo. Lorenzo proposed that Smith come to their home to eat, and Smith accepted. The boys' parents, peasant farmers named Zunino, took him in, but decided it was too risky to keep him at the house so soon after the crash, and hid him in a cave on the mountain. The next day, the Germans came to the Zuninos' house, looking for Smith. After about a week, the danger had subsided, and the Zuninos gave Smith a room in the house.|$|E

2500|$|Owing to {{commercial}} and colonial rivalry in the 16th and 17th centuries between England and the Low Countries, the English cognate of theodisk developed into the exonym Dutch, {{which came to}} refer exclusively {{to the people of}} the Netherlands. Although the wider definition of Dutch that included [...] "German" [...] continued <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>longer</b> in the US and survived there in the name Pennsylvania Dutch, a local German dialect. In the Low Countries on the contrary, Dietsch or Duytsch as endonym for Dutch went out of common use and had been gradually replaced by the Dutch endonym Nederlands. This designation started at the Burgundian court in the 15th century, although the use of neder, laag, bas and inferior ("nether" [...] or [...] "low") to refer to the area known as the Low Counties, goes back further in time. Earlier the Romans have been referring to the region as Germania Inferior ("Lower" [...] Germania). It is a reference to the Low Countries' downriver location at the Rhine–Meuse–Scheldt delta near the North Sea.|$|E

2500|$|The 4th Brigade on {{the right}} took Duchy Farm and Riverside easily, paused to capture Otto Farm and then reached the first {{objective}} (red line) and dug in.

The 1st Brigade attack on the left, veered north beyond the Hanebeek and was fired on from Aviatik Farm and Dear House, which were taken by a trench mortar and grenade attack. Fire from the Winzig, Albatross Farm and Winchester blockhouses, in the 48th (South Midland) Division area further north (and from the Bellevue spur up the Stroombeek valley), delayed the advance until they were captured. More pillboxes at Boetleer were taken by the left flanking battalion of the 4th Brigade and the red line (first objective) was reached. A position near Korek was attacked, despite being beyond the first objective and under British artillery fire. The advance to the final objective, between [...] where it met the Ypres–Roulers railway, north to Kronprinz Farm on the Stroombeek began and a German battalion headquarters was captured in the Waterloo pillboxes.

2500|$|Rumors about a {{potential}} cancellation of One Life to Live arose from TV Guide Canada in late 2009, after ABC {{announced that it}} was moving All My Children from New York City to Los Angeles. One Life to Lives lone presence in New York among the ABC soap operas, along its non-transition to HD and its struggling ratings, made it a program at risk of cancellation. The article from TV Guide Canada also pointed that once One Life to Live is cancelled, some of the actors could be offered to join the cast of All My Children in Los Angeles. In May 2010, rumors of possible cancellation of not only One Life to Live, but this time of also All My Children [...] and General Hospital, resurfaced when Disney–ABC Television Group officially {{announced that it was}} shutting down SOAPnet, effective in 2012. After a failed attempt to give Aisha Tyler a talk show in 2009, ABC restarted auditioning a few pilot shows as candidates for its daytime lineup. At this point, All My Children had the lowest ratings so rumors began heating up in March 2011 about the show's demise, with hints that One Life to Live was safe <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>longer.</b> [...] However, early in April 2011, rumors suggested that both All My Children and One Life to Live were in danger of cancellation.|$|E
2500|$|During the night, Vice-Admiral James Somerville crossed from England and met Nicholson, {{who said}} that with more guns he could hold on <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>longer</b> and they agreed that the ships in the port should return. At dawn on 25 May, the German {{bombardment}} resumed, concentrating on the old town, where buildings fell into streets, high winds fanned fires everywhere and smoke from explosions and the fires blocked the view. The last guns of the 229th Anti-Tank Battery were knocked out and only three tanks of the 3rd RTR remained operational. Distribution of rations and ammunition was difficult and after the water mains were broken, water could only be taken from derelict wells. At [...] Schaal sent the mayor, André Gerschell, to ask Nicholson to surrender but Gerschell was sent back with a refusal. At noon, Schaal offered another opportunity to surrender and extended the [...] deadline to [...] when he found that his emissaries had been delayed, only to be refused again. The German bombardment increased during the day, despite attempts by Allied ships to bombard German gun emplacements. In the east, the 1st Rifle Brigade and parties of the QVR on the outer ramparts and the Marck and Calais canals repulsed a determined attack. The French then eavesdropped on a German wireless message, which disclosed that the Germans were going to attack the perimeter on the west side, held by the 2nd KRRC.|$|E
