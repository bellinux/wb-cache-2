5|$|Nobody {{could call}} {{the whole nation}} a criminal, nor the {{individuals}} that have aired their political views. If the right of conquest belongs by right to the conquering country, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>fair</b> for Spain to quit resisting the French and submit to them, by the same principles {{for which it is}} expected that the Americans submit themselves to the peoples of Pontevedra. The reason and the rule must be equal for everybody. Here there are no conquerors or conquered; here there are only Spaniards. The Spaniards of Spain have lost their land. The Spaniards of America are trying to save theirs. Let the ones from Spain deal with themselves as they can; do not worry, we American Spaniards know what we want and where we go. So I suggest we vote: that we replace the Viceroy with a new authority that will be subject to the parent state if it is saved from the French, and independent if Spain is finally subjugated.|$|E
25|$|As {{she grew}} older her {{determination}} to make literature her profession became very strong, and no discouragements ever altered her purpose. As {{she was the}} oldest of four children, her father {{did not feel that}} <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>fair</b> to the others to give her more than her just proportion of aid, since the others might also, in time, require assistance. Consequently, when at eighteen years old Miss Booth decided that it was necessary for her work that she should be in New York, she could not depend entirely upon her father. While not disregarding any expressed wish of her parents, she made her own decision as to the chief aim of her life. She was now obliged to leave them, and in some way to earn the difference between the sum her father could allow her and her expenses, and also to find time and opportunity for that other work to which she meant to make everything subordinate.|$|E

Despite the years of animosity during Blur and Oasis' respective heyday, Albarn said: [...] "We’re talking. It’s not anything {{to get excited about}} yet. I mean, he’s doing his thing. He’s finishing a new record. I’ve got my record coming out, but the principle of us making music together is something, you know. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>fair</b> to say, we have discussed it at least once." ...|$|E
500|$|Voss {{returned}} from leave on 23 September 1917 {{not yet fully}} rested; as fellow pilot Leutnant Alois Heldmann observed: [...] "He had the nervous instability of a cat. I think <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>fair</b> {{to say he was}} flying on his nerves." [...] Nevertheless, Voss flew a morning mission and shot down an Airco DH.4 from 57 Squadron at 09:30 hours. Upon his return to his air base with bullet holes in his Fokker, he took advantage of Richthofen's absence at the Voss family hunting lodge to celebrate with a victory loop before landing. In contrast to Voss's usual tidy flying garb, he was wearing striped gray trousers, a dirty gray sweater, and tall lace-up boots.|$|E

500|$|Famously, when Commander Lord Cochrane {{captured}} the 32-gun Spanish frigate El Gamo in the 14-gun sloop [...] a promotion {{was the usual}} reward for such a feat of skill and seamanship. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>fair</b> to argue {{that it would have}} been expected by both the commander and his friends and family. Unfortunately for Cochrane, the ship carrying the letter of that victory was intercepted and it was only received after he had himself been captured by the French and was facing a court-martial over the loss of his ship. A court-martial for losing one's ship was common practice at the time and in many cases, including Cochrane's, it was only a formality. It was only when Cochrane was cleared by the court that he could be promoted. Unfortunately the commander thought that the First Lord had deliberately withheld the promotion due to an unforeseen grudge; he held this opinion for the rest of his life. Cochrane had many powerful friends and relatives who lobbied continuously on his behalf. These solicitations may have had a negative effect on Cochrane's career as it is possible that Jervis became irritated by them.|$|E

Though the roads and structures are still there and occupied, access to the base is still restricted. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>fair</b> {{to say that the}} two towns are [...] "lost" [...] to Virginia, albeit for purposes of national defense. Also in 1943, the site of another nearby town, Penniman, was acquired and absorbed into the Cheatham Annex complex, which adjoins Camp Peary, and is part of the Naval Weapons Station Yorktown.|$|E

It <b>is</b> proposed that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>fairer</b> and more effective for the government to assume responsibility for fish passages at existing dams, subject to PURPA. While this seems fairer, it may not be politically feasible...|$|R
3000|$|... gPerhaps <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>fairer</b> to talk {{here about}} the ‘beauties’ or ‘non-beauties’ always in the plural form (in {{contrast}} to a ‘singular’ beauty or non-beauty). Depending on the specific context (time, era or society), {{the understanding of the}} beautiful often varied or varies. Also, within a specific context, quite different understandings of the beautiful can co-exist (partly in contradiction to each other). In that sense, beauty obviously depends upon culture.|$|R

2500|$|Tuscan {{sculptor}} Arnolfo di Cambio {{entered the}} service of Charles I in 1277. Prior to arriving in Rome, Arnolfo di Cambio had worked on the pulpit for the Siena Cathedral {{as part of the}} workshop of Nicola Pisano, which was completed in 1268. [...] Arnolfo di Cambio completed a marble statue of the Charles I now housed in the Musei Capitolini. One of the first portrait statues since antiquity, the statue of Charles I helped set the precedent for royal portrait sculpture in the Renaissance. While the exact location of its original placement is not known, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>fair</b> to assume that it stood in a monumental setting where it could be admired by the King’s subjects. The sculpture shows the king sitting stoically with a royal scepter in his right hand and a jeweled crown upon his head. [...] In addition to this medieval iconography, however, King Charles’s royal robes and lion headed curule seat have been borrowed from Roman sculpture. Arnolfo di Cambio portrayed this medieval Neapolitan King as an authoritative Roman Emperor, but has also succeeded in maintaining the individual likeness of his royal patron.|$|E
2500|$|... "Low mass" [...] {{is partly}} a {{relative}} label: the Earth is low mass {{when compared to the}} Solar System's gas giants, but it is the largest, by diameter and mass, and the densest of all terrestrial bodies. It is large enough to retain an atmosphere through gravity alone and large enough that its molten core remains a heat engine, driving the diverse geology of the surface (the decay of radioactive elements within a planet's core is the other significant component of planetary heating). Mars, by contrast, is nearly (or perhaps totally) geologically dead and has lost much of its atmosphere. Thus <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>fair</b> to infer that the lower mass limit for habitability lies somewhere between that of Mars and that of Earth or Venus: 0.3 Earth masses has been offered as a rough dividing line for habitable planets. However, a 2008 study by the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics suggests that the dividing line may be higher. Earth may in fact lie on the lower boundary of habitability: if it were any smaller, plate tectonics would be impossible. Venus, which has 85% of Earth's mass, shows no signs of tectonic activity. Conversely, [...] "super-Earths", terrestrial planets with higher masses than Earth, would have higher levels of plate tectonics and thus be firmly placed in the habitable range.|$|E

30|$|Despite {{the last}} two major reforms of the Spanish pension system, the ageing process is so intense {{that it will be}} {{impossible}} to prevent the replacement rate from decreasing at least 20 to 25 percentage points moving from the current 74 to 50 % in the next decades. 1 As a result, a public debate has arisen, in which it <b>is</b> argued that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>fairer</b> if the inevitable fall in the replacement rate were mainly focused on pensioners with the highest pensions.|$|R
