50|$|Various methods {{had been}} {{investigated}} {{to overcome the}} problem, but heavy grounding skegs and the N.L. pontoon causeways were finally accepted as standard; the pontoon causeways were formed of pontoons 7 ft × 5 ft × 5 ft, made up into strings and rafts. When offloading, the rafts were secured to the <b>fore</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the <b>ship,</b> and the load discharged directly onto the shore, or towed on the raft to the shore.|$|R
60|$|Arrived at that comforting conclusion, I bethought {{myself of}} a cigar and went below to get it. All was still down there. Everybody at the after <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the <b>ship</b> was {{sleeping}} profoundly. I came out {{again on the}} quarter-deck, agreeably at ease in my sleeping suit on that warm breathless night, barefooted, a glowing cigar in my teeth, and, going forward, I was met by the profound silence <b>of</b> the <b>fore</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the <b>ship.</b> Only as I passed {{the door of the}} forecastle, I heard a deep, quiet, trustful sigh of some sleeper inside. And suddenly I rejoiced in the great security of the sea as compared with the unrest of the land, in my choice of that untempted life presenting no disquieting problems, invested with an elementary moral beauty by the absolute straightforwardness of its appeal and by the singleness of its purpose.|$|R
2500|$|HMS Victoria, {{flagship}} of the Mediterranean fleet, was {{in retrospect}} an unlucky ship. In January 1892 {{she was at}} Platea in Greece carrying out exercises firing torpedoes, when she ran aground on Snipe Point. Tryon was not on board, as the fleet ships went individually for torpedo practice. This involved firing torpedoes while travelling at speed, but was made more difficult {{by the need to}} conduct the practices in shallow waters so the torpedoes could be recovered. Captain Bourke had sent men to mark the point where the waters shallowed to ten fathoms, but they had misjudged the buoy's proper position. Victoria ran aground at nine knots, leaving the <b>fore</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the <b>ship</b> seven feet higher out of the water than normal, while the stern still had 66 feet of water beneath it. The ship was secured with anchors and unsuccessful attempts were made by the nearby [...] torpedo-depot ship to tow her free. Tryon arrived from Malta on board the Surprise, having given orders for the dockyard tug Sampson, Phaeton, Edinburgh, Dreadnought, Scout and Humber to come to assist. Victoria was refloated six days after grounding, towed by Dreadnought and Edinburgh, with the tug lashed to her side and her own engines running astern. 1200 tons had been removed from the ship to lighten her. Victoria returned to Malta for repairs to torn plates along her bottom.|$|R
50|$|It was {{estimated}} from survivors reports that initially twelve watertight compartments were affected, causing a buoyance loss of some 680 LT at the <b>fore</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the <b>ship,</b> mostly concentrated {{below the level}} of the armoured deck. Water then spread to other areas, eventually rising to fill the space below the main deck. There were no significant longitudinal bulkheads in the affected areas, which might have had the effect of keeping water out of the port side and thereby accentuating the heel, but the water naturally flooded the holed side first causing the imbalance. No water entered the stokeholds or engine rooms. It was determined that had the gunports and doors at deck level been closed so that water was prevented from entering this way, then the ship would not have capsized. These doors would customarily be closed if the ship was travelling in a heavy sea, but were not part of normal procedure for closure in a collision. She might not have foundered at all, but this would have depended on whether various bulkhead doors had been closed or not, which was unclear. Had all doors been closed initially so that only the breached compartments were flooded, then the ship's deck would have likely remained just above water level with a heel of around 9° and Victoria {{would have been able to}} continue under her own power.|$|R
5000|$|On 29 January 1892, Victoria ran aground at Snipe Point near Platea on the Greek coast. Platea {{had been}} {{selected}} as a convenient friendly port for British ships {{to use as a}} base for exercises with torpedoes and mines, and each <b>ship</b> <b>of</b> the Mediterranean Fleet would go there in turn during the winter. Torpedoes would be launched from fast moving ships in real battle conditions, but it was desirable to practice this in relatively shallow waters so that the torpedoes could be recovered afterwards (they were supposed to float once their motors stopped but sometimes sank). Captain Bourke had appreciated the potential difficulties <b>of</b> operating his <b>ship</b> in shallow waters, and had ordered a crew to set out a buoy offshore at the place where the water shoaled to 60 ft. But the crew missed the shallowest point, and Victoria grounded on the rocky shoal at 9 kn and stuck fast. The <b>fore</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the <b>ship</b> <b>ended</b> up 7 ft higher out of the water than would be normal as momentum drove it up onto the shoal. The ship's bottom was damaged, and three compartments flooded. The stern, however, was still in 66 ft of water. Admiral Tryon was notified and departed for the scene in , also ordering a dockyard tug Sampson with pumping equipment and hawsers. [...] — a torpedo-depot ship — was already at Platea and made two attempts to tow Victoria free. These failed, but she assisted with laying anchors to hold the rear <b>of</b> the <b>ship</b> steady until further help could arrive. , , , [...] and [...] were also called to the scene.|$|R
50|$|It {{was a hot}} afternoon, and a Thursday, {{which was}} {{traditionally}} a rest time for the crew. All hatches and means of ventilation were open to cool the ship. There was a 100 sq ft hole in the side <b>of</b> the <b>ship</b> open to the sea, but initially, Tryon and his navigation officer, Staff Commander Thomas Hawkins-Smith, {{did not believe the}} ship would sink, as the damage was forward and had not affected the engine room or ship's power. Tryon gave orders to turn the ship and head for the shore 5 mi away so she could be beached. Some <b>of</b> the surrounding <b>ships</b> had launched boats for a rescue, but he signalled for them to turn back. Just two minutes after Camperdown backed out of the hole she had created, water was advancing over the deck and spilling into the open hatches. A party under Lieutenant Herbert Heath attempted to unroll a collision mat down the side <b>of</b> the <b>ship</b> to patch the hole and slow the inrush of water, but by the time they could manhandle it into position they were standing in water, and had to abandon the attempt. Five minutes after the collision, the bow had already sunk 15 ft, the ship was listing heavily to starboard and water was coming through the gun ports in the large forward turret. The foredeck became submerged, with the top of the gun turret forming a small island. Although the engineroom was still manned and the engines running, hydraulic power for the helm failed so the ship could not be turned and there was no power to launch the ship's boats. Eight minutes after the collision, the entire <b>fore</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the <b>ship</b> was under water, and the water was lapping the main deck. The stern had risen so that the screws were nearly out of the water.|$|R
