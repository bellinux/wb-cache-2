5|$|Meanwhile, Pete Miller (Jake Lacy) teaches Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) {{about his}} {{favorite}} movie, Die Hard, {{and attempts to}} recite all the dialogue from memory while an impressed Erin checks his accuracy using an online transcript. Andy Bernard (Ed Helms), who is still away in the Caribbean after sailing his family's boat, emails Erin and {{says that he is}} going to stay for a few weeks. Hurt, Erin decides to watch Die Hard with Pete rather than just hear him quote it. While watching the movie, Erin begins to cry and Pete tries to comfort her by placing <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>her.</b> In the meantime, Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) tells Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate) about the Scranton Strangler case he was on. After boring her for what is implied to be several hours, she hushes him, before gently kissing him. Toby then whips off his glasses and kisses her back.|$|E
500|$|Critics {{and fans}} responded {{negatively}} to the episode's final sequence. Taylor described getting adverse fan mail {{about the lack}} of sympathy expressed by Voyagers crew members for Torres in the ending. She clarified that Chakotay's response to Torres was intended to be unresponsive rather than cold, and acknowledged that he should have [...] "put <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> and show some warmth" [...] as suggested by fans. Green was surprised that Torres was not given a pep talk by either Captain Kathryn Janeway (Kate Mulgrew) or Chakotay in the final scene. Epsicokhan, on the other hand, found the lack of answers from Chakotay to be an appropriate ending given the focus on Torres' personal conflicts.|$|E
500|$|Two {{young female}} millworkers in 1873 Maine visit the town's {{carousel}} after work. One of them, Julie Jordan, attracts {{the attention of}} the barker, Billy Bigelow ("The Carousel Waltz"). [...] When Julie lets Billy put <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> during the ride, Mrs. Mullin, the widowed owner of the carousel, tells Julie never to return. Julie and her friend, Carrie Pipperidge, argue with Mrs. Mullin. [...] Billy arrives and, seeing that Mrs. Mullin is jealous, mocks her; he is fired from his job. Billy, unconcerned, invites Julie to join him for a drink. As he goes to get his belongings, Carrie presses Julie about her feelings toward him, but Julie is evasive ("You're a Queer One, Julie Jordan"). Carrie has a beau too, fisherman Enoch Snow ("(When I Marry) Mister Snow"), to whom she is newly engaged. [...] Billy returns for Julie as the departing Carrie warns that staying out late means the loss of Julie's job. Mr. Bascombe, owner of the mill, happens by along with a policeman, and offers to escort Julie to her home, but she refuses and is fired. Left alone, she and Billy talk about what life might be like if they were in love, but neither quite confesses to the growing attraction they feel for each other ("If I Loved You").|$|E

60|$|He put <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> {{and drew}} her head close to his. Their lips met.|$|R
60|$|He wound <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>her,</b> and, {{without a}} word, {{commenced}} dragging {{her across the}} road.|$|R
500|$|When Leigh {{returned}} from the beach, she was bleeding between her legs, distressed, crying and seeking assistance. Some people at the party reported trying to console Leigh {{and find out what}} had happened to her; Leigh [...] "asserted she had been raped", replying [...] " [...] fucked me" [...] and [...] "I hate him". After witnessing Leigh's complaints, Webster is quoted as saying to a group of boys [...] "she's a bit of a slut and why don't all of us have a go". Nineteen-year-old Guy Wilson then approached Leigh, placed <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> and asked her for sex. Wilson pushed Leigh to the ground when she refused, and was joined by Webster and around ten other boys who surrounded Leigh. They yelled abuse, kicked her, poured beer on her and spat both beer and saliva on her. Several people witnessed the assault, yet nobody came to help her or attempted to contact the police, her parents or other adults. The assaults continued for approximately five minutes; Leigh stood up when they stopped and staggered away before picking up an empty beer bottle and throwing it at the group of boys, missing them. Guy Wilson threw a beer bottle back at her as she left, which either hit her in the leg or missed, according to different witness accounts. The group of boys followed her inside the crowded clubhouse where she sought refuge, and similar assaults continued. Leigh was seen leaving the club and walking towards the beach at about 10:30pm. Leigh's stepfather arrived at the party to pick her up at 10:50pm. He and several of the party-goers searched for Leigh, but she could not be found. After repeated search attempts, Leigh's mother and stepfather decided to wait for her to return home, assuming she had gone to a friend's house for the night. Leigh's stepfather recommenced the search for Leigh the following morning, aided by several youths from the party. Her body was found in the sand dunes about [...] north of the surf club. Leigh's invitation to attend the party was still in her pocket.|$|E
2500|$|At first [...] gave no reply. He {{carefully}} weighed {{all that}} she had said. Then slowly he placed <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>her.</b> She allowed him to do so. Then he promised her that {{all the things she}} wished for she would have. She would have a house in the west on the shimmering water. She would have gems, and animals. They would dwell together in harmony.|$|E
2500|$|His {{interest}} in music kept him on friendly terms with female musicians including pianist Moura Lympany. When Heath was Prime Minister she {{was approached by}} the Conservative MP Tufton Beamish, who said: [...] "Moura, Ted must get married. Will you marry him?" [...] She said she would have done but {{was in love with}} someone else. She later said the most intimate thing Heath had done was to put <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> shoulder.|$|E
60|$|And then {{he sort of}} stumbles {{across the}} room, and goes down on his knees, and gets <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>her.</b>|$|R
60|$|He {{drew her}} to him, and, with <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>her,</b> pressed back {{her head and}} covered her lips with kisses.|$|R
60|$|He {{told her}} what more he had to say, but it was with <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> and <b>his</b> eyes close to hers.|$|R
2500|$|He infamously {{identified}} {{a picture of}} a heavily muddied jockey as John Reid, only to be mortified when told it was the Princess Anne. Later in the same series, she came on the programme, made it clear she was not remotely offended by the misidentification, and was put on his team. Hughes caused a minor national debate when he defied protocol and put <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>her.</b> [...] He called her [...] "ma'am" [...] throughout. Hughes later joined her team for the much-criticised It's a Royal Knockout project, the brainchild of her brother the Prince Edward.|$|E
2500|$|In {{matters of}} diplomacy, Elizabeth {{is known to}} be quite formal, and royal {{protocol}} is generally very strict. Though some of the traditional rules for dealing with the monarch have been relaxed during her reign (bowing is no longer required, for example, although it is still frequently performed), other forms of close personal interaction, such as touching, are discouraged by officials. At least six people are known to have broken this rule, the first being a woman named Alice Frazier, who hugged the Queen in 1991 when Elizabeth visited her residence in a government housing project in Washington, D.C. (accompanied by First Lady Barbara Bush and Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Jack Kemp). The second was Paul Keating, Prime Minister of Australia, when he was photographed with his arm around the Queen in 1992. The third was Canadian cyclist Louis Garneau, who did the same thing ten years later when posing for a photograph with the Queen at Rideau Hall (her official residence in Canada). In 1997 during the Cabot 500 celebrations of Newfoundland and Labrador, the then Premier Brian Tobin placed an arm behind her while walking up a staircase. This was frowned upon in the press, but the Premier said that he placed <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> as an effort to help an elderly woman climb the stairs. In 2009, the Queen initiated an affectionate gesture with First Lady Michelle Obama at a palace reception she attended with President Obama. The Queen rested her hand briefly at the small of the First Lady's back, a gesture that Mrs Obama returned. It was remarked at the time as unprecedented and described afterwards by a palace spokeswoman as [...] "a mutual and spontaneous display of affection and appreciation between The Queen and Michelle Obama." ...|$|E
2500|$|Cephalopods are not {{broadcast}} spawners. During {{the process}} of fertilization, the females use sperm provided by the male via external fertilization. Internal fertilization is seen only in octopods. The initiation of copulation begins when the male catches a female and wraps <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>her,</b> either in a [...] "male to female neck" [...] position or mouth to mouth position, depending on the species. The males then initiate {{the process of}} fertilization by contracting their mantle several times to release the spermatozoa. Cephalopods often mate several times, which influences males to mate longer with females that have previously, nearly tripling the amount of contractions of the mantle. To ensure the fertilization of the eggs, female cephalopods release a sperm-attracting peptide through the gelatinous layers of the egg to direct the spermatozoa. Female cephalopods lay eggs in clutches; each egg is composed of a protective coat {{to ensure the safety}} of the developing embryo when released into the water column. Reproductive strategies differ between cephalopod species. In giant pacific octopus, large eggs are laid in a den; it will often take several days to lay all of them. Once the eggs are released and attached to a sheltered substrate the females then die. In some species of cephalopods, egg clutches are anchored to substrates by a mucilaginous adhesive substance. These eggs are swelled with preivitelline fluid (PVF), a hypertonic fluid that prevents premature hatching. Fertilized egg clusters are neutrally buoyant depending at the depth that they were laid but can also be found in substrates such as sand, matrix of corals, or seaweed. Because these species do not provide parental care for their offspring, egg capsules can be injected with ink by the female in order to camouflage the embryos from predators.|$|E
60|$|The {{tears came}} to his eyes, and he put <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> neck. He nestled against her heart as a child might have done.|$|R
6000|$|Happy tears fell fast, as Thistle folded <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>her,</b> crying, [...] "O Lily-Bell, dear Lily-Bell, awake! I {{have been}} true to you, and now my task is done." ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{reply was}} so {{unexpectedly}} mild for Aunt Sally, that Jeff put <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> {{and kissed her}} hard cheek. [...] "And I've got some quail, aunty, knowin' you liked em." ...|$|R
60|$|He passed <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> {{and pulled}} her down on his knees.|$|E
60|$|He passed <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> tiny waist. She {{looked at}} him with frightened eyes.|$|E

60|$|Suddenly Kells {{stepped to}} her from behind and put <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>her.</b> Joan grew stiff. She had been taken off her guard. She was in <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> and could not face him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, Marcia!" [...] he said, [...] "what {{a strange}} girl you are!" [...] He sunk {{into his chair}} again, and, putting <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> waist, drew her upon his knee, like a child.|$|R
60|$|With no gentle hand {{he grasped}} {{her arm and}} forced her to look at him. But the misery in her eyes overcame him, and he roughly threw <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> and held her close.|$|R
60|$|He passed <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>her.</b> A wild {{flash in}} her eyes had {{suddenly}} revealed her thought.|$|E
60|$|He put <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> {{and led her}} to an oak bench {{near the}} big fireplace.|$|E
60|$|The lady's tears {{became her}} vastly. Hardly {{knowing what he}} did, Scrymgeour put <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>her.</b>|$|E
60|$|Clambering {{into the}} wagon, he put <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> neck, {{pressing}} <b>his</b> cheek close against hers, and during {{what seemed a}} very long while the two remained silent, not daring to give words to their fears.|$|R
60|$|Nothing of {{the sort}} happened, however. There was a queer, a mystifying change in Laura's expression. She was {{looking down at the}} floor. Suddenly her face was hidden in her hands. The Inspector threw <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>her.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh no, it is n't!" [...] {{and behind}} her back her fingers slowly crushed the petals of a blood-red poppy. She shook her head, smiling a {{brilliant}} smile. The blossoms fell, he flung <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>her,</b> and {{kissed her on the}} lips.|$|R
60|$|He, however, {{repeated}} the question, touched with her charming preoccupation, and passing <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> little waist.|$|E
60|$|So saying, he put <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>her,</b> {{and half}} leading, half carrying, {{took her to}} her room.|$|E

6000|$|Davy was aghast. Anne crying [...] . he {{had made}} Anne cry! A flood of real remorse rolled like a wave over his warm little heart and engulfed it. He rushed to Anne, hurled himself into <b>her</b> lap, flung <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> neck, and burst into tears.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, Sam," [...] she gasped, [...] "old Jerome Irving and Aunt Anne {{are sitting}} round {{there in the}} dark on the front porch and he had <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>her,</b> kissing her! And they never saw nor heard me, no more'n if they were deaf and blind!" ...|$|R
