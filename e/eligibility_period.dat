40|$|We {{examine the}} tax rules for {{ownership}} of fungible securities {{in light of}} three recent cases addressing this issue, Samueli, Calloway, and Anschutz. We argue that ownership has no economic basis under an income tax because under a pure income tax ownership would not be needed to measure income. Rather than acting as a bedrock principle based in economics, ownership in a realization-based income tax acts as a default rule for assigning tax characteristics to positions. For example, ownership determine characteristics such as holding <b>periods,</b> <b>eligibility</b> for special tax benefits such as the dividends received deduction, counting toward control or as qualifying consideration for various purposes, and so forth. Each of these characteristics, which we label tax attributes, is motivated by different policy considerations. Given {{the wide variety of}} policies behind the various tax attributes, no single concept of ownership can be expected to be appropriate in all cases. Therefore, tax rules for each characteristic start with the default rule of ownership but modify the assignment of the attribute based on the relevant policy considerations. Viewing ownership, as a mere default for assigning tax attributes, we propose a simple and clear rule for ownership of fungible securities which produces results similar to those of current law and yet which avoid the problems created by the recent court decisions on ownership of fungible securities...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Faculty of Engineering Technology of the Open University of Sri Lanka {{has been}} {{offering}} engineering programmes {{at a distance}} {{for the last two}} decades or so. However, completion rates in Faculty of Engineering Technology are lower compared to the other faculties of the University. This paper investigates the reasons for low completion rates in the faculty and suggests ways and means to overcome this problem. The study concludes that increasing student numbers will not necessarily increase percentage of students completing the programme though the number of students completing is increased. It is found that students offering courses {{for the first time in}} the system of distance education in their academic career perform poorer because they are not conversant with distance education techniques. It is recommended that the Faculty must offer an orientation programme on distance education to all the students enrolling for the first time, before they commence their regular programmes. Further, it has been found that considerable percentage of students who obtain eligibility to sit the final examination by completing the continuous assessments do not sit the final examination. This has been found to contribute towards non-completion of programmes as students sitting the final examination in the subsequent years perform poorly in their exams. To overcome this problem, it is recommended that current practise of allowing the student to carry forward their <b>eligibility</b> to unlimited <b>period</b> of time must be disbanded...|$|R

(This is {{the highest percentage of}} students affected among all 50 U.S. states.) In almost all cases, the suspensions of eligibility for aid are based on applicants checking a box saying that they have a drug conviction, or failing to check the box saying that they do not, rather than an actual check of criminal records. Following an amendment in 2006, only students who are enrolled in college and receiving financial aid {{at the time of their}} conviction may have their aid suspended (prior to 2006, the law was applied regardless of when a drug conviction occurred). Students may resume <b>eligibility</b> after a <b>period</b> of time (for example, after one year if convicted of possession of a controlled substance) or if they complete a drug rehabilitation program approved by the U.S. Department of Education. Before the 2006-2007 academic year, the provision could also apply to high school students, but this changed with the passage of the Deficit Reduction Act in 2001.In early 2006, Souder added, to a bill about the office of the drug czar, a provision calling for the fungus Fusarium oxysporum to be used as a biological control agent against drug crops in foreign countries.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Music {{therapy is}} {{frequently}} {{used as a}} palliative therapy. In consonance {{with the goals of}} palliative care, the primary aim of music therapy is to improve people's quality of life by addressing their psychological needs and facilitating communication. To date, primarily because of a paucity of robust research, the evidence for music therapy's effectiveness on patient reported outcomes is positive but weak. This pilot and feasibility study will test procedures, outcomes and validated tools; estimate recruitment and attrition rates; and calculate the sample size required for a phase III randomised trial {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} music therapy in improving the quality of life of palliative care patients. METHODS: A pilot randomised controlled trial supplemented with qualitative methods. The quantitative data collection will involve recruitment of > 52 patients from an inpatient Marie Curie hospice setting over a 12 -month <b>period.</b> <b>Eligibility</b> criteria include all patients with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 03 - indicating they are medically fit to engage with music therapy and an Abbreviated Mental Test (AMT) score of ≥ 7 indicating they are capable of providing meaningful informed consent and accurate responses to outcome measures. Baseline data collection will include the McGill Quality of Life Questionnaire (MQOL); medical and socio-demographic data will be undertaken before randomisation to an intervention or control group. Participants in the intervention arm will be offered two 30 - 45  min sessions of music therapy per week for three consecutive weeks, in addition to care as usual. Participants in the control arm will receive care as usual. Follow-up measures will be administered in 1, 3 and 5  weeks. Qualitative data collection will involve focus group and individual interviews with HCPs and carers. DISCUSSION: This study will ensure a firm methodological grounding for the development of a robust phase III randomised trial of music therapy for improving quality of life in palliative care patients. By undertaking the pilot and feasibility trial under normal clinical conditions in a hospice setting, the trial will result in reliable procedures to overcome some of the difficulties in designing music therapy RCTs for palliative care settings.
