40|$|The {{publication}} of the health strategy document "Shaping a Healthier Future" placed an onus on health service providers to meet the highest possible quality standards within the resources available. This led to enquiries to the National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI) regarding quality management systems standards such as ISO 9000 and how they {{could be used to}} the benefit of health service providers. It became evident that there was a need to clarify how such quality system standards could be applied to the complex and wide range of services provided by health service organisations. It was with this in mind that NSAI decided that it would be beneficial to all concerned if an <b>interpretative</b> <b>document</b> was available for the application of ISO 9000 in the health service sector. After wide consultation with representatives from all areas of the sector a working group was set up comprising of N 5 AI personnel and representatives from the medical, nursing and administrative functions of the health services. The initiative was supported by the Chief Executive Officers of the Health Boards and the voluntary hospitals. Due to the complexity and range of services within the health service sector the terms of reference of the working group was to develop an initial document which provided guidance for the application of ISO 9000 for the administrative aspects of hospital services. The guidelines produced here are complimentary to the ISO 9000 series of standards and are not to be taken as definitive or standards in their own right. It is also important to emphasise that neither the ISO 9000 series nor these guidelines deal with quality in terms of level or grade. They deal with the management and the assurance of quality. Quality levels are the responsibility of each individual service provider taking into account {{the nature and extent of}} their operations...|$|E
40|$|The {{transplantation}} {{of conventional}} human cell and tissue grafts, such as heart valve replacements and skin for severely burnt patients, has saved many lives {{over the last}} decades. The late eighties saw the emergence of tissue engineering with {{the focus on the}} development of biological substitutes that restore or improve tissue function. In the nineties, {{at the height of the}} tissue engineering hype, industry incited policymakers to create a European regulatory environment, which would facilitate the emergence of a strong single market for tissue engineered products and their starting materials (human cells and tissues). In this paper we analyze the elaboration process of this new European Union (EU) human cell and tissue product regulatory regime-i. e. the EU Cell and Tissue Directives (EUCTDs) and the Advanced Therapy Medicinal Product (ATMP) Regulation and evaluate its impact on Member States' health care systems. We demonstrate that the successful lobbying on key areas of regulatory and policy processes by industry, in congruence with Europe's risk aversion and urge to promote growth and jobs, led to excessively business oriented legislation. Expensive industry oriented requirements were introduced and contentious social and ethical issues were excluded. We found indications that this new EU safety and health legislation will adversely impact Member States' health care systems; since 30 December 2012 (the end of the ATMP transitional period) there is a clear threat to the sustainability of some lifesaving and established ATMPs that were provided by public health institutions and small and medium-sized enterprises under the frame of the EUCTDs. In the light of the current economic crisis it is not clear how social security systems will cope with the inflation of costs associated with this new regulatory regime and how priorities will be set with regard to reimbursement decisions. We argue that the ATMP Regulation should urgently be revised to focus on delivering affordable therapies to all who are in need of them and this without necessarily going to the market. The most rapid and elegant way to achieve this would be for the European Commission to publish an <b>interpretative</b> <b>document</b> on "placing on the market of ATMPs," which keeps tailor-made and niche ATMPs outside of the scope of the medicinal product regulation. status: publishe...|$|E

50|$|Changes {{were not}} limited to new designations, as the {{interpretation}} of many existing National Historic Sites did not remain static and evolved over time. For example, the commemoration of National Historic Sites on the Prairies related to the Red River Rebellion and the North-West Rebellion has gone through at least three phases to date. In the 1920s, plaques erected at these sites trumpeted the expansion of Canada and western civilization across North America. Due to local pressures, changes at the HSMBC and evolving historiography, texts introduced in the 1950s avoided the previous triumphalist version of events, but also avoided any analysis of the causes or consequences of the events. Commencing in the 1970s, a changing approach to heritage conservation at Parks Canada, coupled with growing regionalism and a more assertive Aboriginal rights movement, led {{to the next generation}} of <b>interpretative</b> <b>documents,</b> one that included a focus on the societies which Canada's 19th-century expansion had displaced.|$|R

40|$|The {{suggestion}} of a Polyport is argued and interpreted in close relation {{to the notion of}} ‘exchange’. Set at Kew Gardens, the aspect calling for ‘A Royal Botanical Pop-up Garden’ explored the main themes of nature and trade. These design proposals were used to link London and Singapore through the exchange of knowledge and products between the botanical gardens of both countries. This ethos is further enhanced by the notion of Polyport, and most notably the exchange of <b>interpretative</b> <b>documents</b> governing the choices of site in London (and Singapore). The main narrative sees the design work produced for Kew Gardens in London relocating to Gardens by the Bay in Singapore. This allows for the contrasting differences between Kew Garden’s royal and historical lineage and Gardens by the Bay as a twenty-first century botanical garden to be examined. While the first is read as a separate collection of buildings and experiences, the latter serves as an example of mega-scaled architecture which relies on both nature and technology to perform as a sustainable organism. Hence the ‘Pop-up Garden’ is a displaced garden with the capability to ‘pop up’ on both sites, and is able to adapt to suit specific geographical, topographical, climatic and/ or programmatic features as appropriate. The ranges of ideas in the projects presented demonstrate an exceeding wide approach to addressing contextual relationships in the design process. There are proposals which directly reference Kew such as ‘The Wandering Garden’, which concerns the modern picturesque; ‘An Esoteric History of English Landscape’, which explores the notion of palimpsest; and ‘The Imperial Botanist Folly’ which dwells on colonial nostalgia. In contrast, there are proposals that choose to use the futuristic quality of Gardens by the Bay {{as a starting point for}} their narratives. ‘The Floating Archive’ is an utopian proposal; ‘The Water Temple’ has an ecological agenda; and ‘Breeding Chambers: A Living Fungarium’ is best described as sustainable science-fiction. These ‘pop-up’ gardens all result from different readings of Kew Gardens, as well as Gardens by the Bay and more importantly, reflect the diversity of the students’ own research...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{concerns the}} implementation of European environmental directives in national law, {{with a focus on}} transposition. The research question is what role the directives themselves have in the occurrence of implementation problems in the Member States. This is based on the hypothesis that implementation problems are not always the fault of the Member States (as is suggested by the infringement procedure of Article 258 TFEU / Article 226 EC Treaty), but may also be caused by flaws in the directives themselves, such as unclear or impossible obligations, bad coherence between directives etc. Ten environmental directives are selected for further research concerning problems with their implementation. These problems are tested in three different Member States: Denmark, Germany and the Netherlands. This test confirmed the role of these problems in practice. A major problem is the directives’ lack of clarity where it concerns the scope of the directive. Member States tend to opt for a limited interpretation, whereas the Commission usually holds a broader view. Most of the time, the ECJ follows the Commission in her broad interpretation. However, the interpretation of the Member States is not always unreasonable. The ECJ sometimes seems to overstretch the meaning of a directive a bit. Other problems are a lack of coherence between directives in the use of definitions and in the applicability of multiple directives to the same situation and lack of clarity concerning definitions. Different instruments such as area protection, emission standards, environmental quality standards, procedural requirements and the obligation to set up plans or programmes each have their own problems to which attention should be paid when prescribing such instruments. Soft law can be helpful for Member States, especially when filling in technical standards or vague norms, but <b>interpretative</b> <b>documents</b> should be handled with care. They usually reflect the opinion of the European Commission or other stakeholders and are not legally binding. Member States should consider their own preferences on whether or not to follow these documents. However, Member States need not take all the blame for problems with the transposition of directives but they do have their own responsibility as co legislator. Not all problems concerning transposition can be blamed on flaws in directives. Member States are obliged to loyally execute directives, even if this requires amendments of perfectly functioning national legislation or the designation of vulnerable but economically important areas. Better impact assessments with a focus on legal and environmental effects of new legislation, both on the European and the national level, would help to prevent this situation. If the effects of a directive are known beforehand, Member States will be better able to consider whether they wish to commit themselves to these obligations...|$|R
40|$|The Leonardo da Vinci Project CZ/ 08 /LLP-LdV/TOI/ 134020 “Transfer of Innovations Provided in Eurocodes, {{addresses}} {{the urgent need}} to implement the new system of European documents related to design and construction work and products. These documents, called Eurocodes, are systematically based on the recently developed Council Directive 89 / 106 /EEC “The Construction Product Directive” and its <b>Interpretative</b> <b>Documents</b> ID 1 and ID 2. Implementation of Eurocodes in each Member State is a demanding task as each country has its own long-term tradition in design and construction. The project should enable an effective implementation and application of the new methods for designing and verification of buildings and civil engineering works in all the partner countries (CZ, DE, ES, IT, NL) and in other Member States. The need to explain and effectively use the latest principles specified in Eurocodes standards is apparent from enterprises, undertakings and public national authorities involved in construction industry and also from university and colleges. Training materials, manuals and software programmes for education are urgently required. The submitted Guidebook 2 completes the set of two guidebooks intended to provide required manuals and software products for training, education and effective implementation of Eurocodes: Guidebook 1 : Load Effects on Buildings Guidebook 2 : Design of bridges. It is expected that the Guidebooks will address the following intents in further harmonization o f European construction industry: -	reliability improvement and unification {{of the process of}} design, -	development of a single market for product and for construction services, -	new opportunities for trained primary target groups in the labour market. The Guidebook 2 is focused on determining load effects on road, railway and pedestrian bridges and special civil structures. The following main topics are discussed in particular: -	basic requirements on bridges, -	basis of structural design, -	traffic loads for static and fatigue assessment, -	non traffic actions, -	accidental actions, -	combination rules for bridges, -	examples and case studies. Annex A to Guidebook 2 concerns new traffic trends in European traffic and their consequence on bridge design and on assessment of existing bridges, Annex B provides basic information about action and combination rules for special structures, like cranes, masts, towers and pipelines. The Guidebook 2 is written in a user-friendly way employing only basic mathematical tools, supplemented by examples and case studies developed in detail. A wide range of potential users of the Guidebooks and other training materials includes practising engineers, designers, technicians, experts of public authorities, young people – high school and university students. The target groups come from all territorial regions of the partner countries. However, the dissemination of the project results is foreseen to be spread into all Member States of CEN and other interested countries...|$|R

This paper provides an empirical examination of the three discourses of joint commissioning developed from an <b>interpretative</b> analysis of <b>documents</b> by Dickinson et al (2013) and applied to data from our study exploring the role of knowledge in commissioning in England. Based on interviews with 92 participants undertaken between 2011 and 2013 our analysis confirms that the three discourses of prevention or empowerment or efficiency are used by professionals from across health and social care organisations to frame their experiences of joint commissioning. However, contrary to Dickinson et al, we also demonstrate that commissioners and other stakeholders combine and trade off these different discourses in unexpected ways to present a compelling case. Moreover, at sites where the service user experience was central to the commissioning process (joint commissioning as empowerment) a greater sense of agreement about commissioning decisions appeared to have been established, even when the other discourses were also in play...|$|R

40|$|Summary. Energy saving {{has been}} a stated policy {{objective}} of the EU since the 1970 s. Presently, the 2020 target is a 20 % reduction of EU energy consumption in comparison with current projections for 2020. This {{is one of the}} headline targets of the European Energy Strategy 2020 but efforts to achieve it remain slow and insufficient. The aim {{of this paper is to}} understand why this is happening. Firstly, this paper examines the reasons why public measures promoting energy efficiency are needed and what form these measures should optimally take (§ 1). Fortunately, over the last 20 years, much research has been done into the famous ‘energy efficiency gap’ (or ‘the energy efficiency paradox’), even if more remains to be done. Multiple explanations have been given: market failures, modelling flaws and behavioural obstacles. Each encompasses many complex aspects. Several types of instruments can be adopted to encourage energy efficiency: measures guaranteeing the correct pricing of energy are preferred, followed by taxes or tradable white certificates which in turn are preferred to standards or subsidies. Information programmes are also necessary. Secondly, the paper analyzes the evolution of the different programmes from 2000 onwards (§ 2). This reveals the extreme complexity of the subject. It deals with quite diverse topics: buildings, appliances, public sector, industry and transport. The market for energy efficiency is as diffuse as energy consumption patterns themselves. It is composed of many market actors who demand more efficient provision of energy services, and that suppliers of the necessary goods and know-how deliver this greater efficiency. Consumers in this market include individuals, businesses and governments, and market activities cover all energy-consuming sectors of the economy. Additionally, energy efficiency is the perfect example of a shared competence between the EU and the Member States. Lastly, the legal framework has steadily increased in complexity, and despite the successive energy efficiency programmes used to build this framework, it has become clear that the gap between the target and the results remains. The paper then examines whether the 2012 / 27 /EU Directive adopted to improve the situation could bring better results. It briefly describes the content of this framework Directive, which accompanies and implements the latest energy efficiency programme (§ 3). Although the Directive is technically complex and maintains nonbinding energy efficiency targets, it certainly represents an improvement in several aspects. However, it is also saddled with a multiplicity of exemption clauses and <b>interpretative</b> <b>documents</b> (with no binding value) which weaken its provisions. Furthermore, alone, it will allow the achievement of only about 17. 7 % of final energy savings by 2020. The implementation process, which is essential, also remains fairly weak. The paper also gives a glimpse of the various EU instruments for financing energy efficiency projects (§ 4). Though useful, they do not indicate a strong priority. Fourthly, the paper tries to analyze the EU’s limited progress so far and gather a few suggestions for improvement. One thing seems to remain useful: targets which can be defined in various ways (§ 5). Basically, all this indicates that the EU energy efficiency strategy has so far failed to reach its targets, lacks coherence and remains ambiguous. In the new Commission’s proposals of 22 January 2014 – intended to define a new climate/energy package in the period from 2020 to 2030 – the approach to energy efficiency remains unclear. This is regrettable. Energy efficiency is the only instrument which allows the EU to reach simultaneously its three targets: sustainability, competitiveness and security. The final conclusion appears thus paradoxical. On the one hand, all existing studies indicate that the decarbonization of the EU economy will be absolutely impossible without some very serious improvements in energy efficiency. On the other hand, in reality energy efficiency has always been treated as a second zone priority. It is imperative to eliminate this contradiction...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: There is {{no doubt}} that {{entrepreneurs}} are being considered as wealth creators and are considered as catalysts to bring about social change. Emerging economies are dependent on their entrepreneurial flare and robust thinking because of their ability to think and act outside normal practices. However, theories on how entrepreneurs transform from their start-up stage to entrepreneurial leaders in the shortest time possible with minimum risk is relatively absent. Therefore, {{the purpose of this paper}} is firstly, to define entrepreneurial leadership as a concept, provide an overview of Jaques Stratified Systems Theory and Sarasvathy’s effectual reasoning theory. The authors proceed with a conceptual model of Entrepreneurial Leadership Levels and the associated complexities per level. Secondly, the researchers propose different modes of entrepreneurial education and developmental interventions that would best fit during each Entrepreneurial Leadership Level to ensure successful transition to the next Entrepreneurial Leadership Level. The research design was qualitative, explorative and <b>interpretative</b> in nature. <b>Document</b> analysis was used to gain meaning and understanding to enable the researchers to cultivate empirical knowledge.

The digitalisation of printed documents and texts allows them to be easily consulted at distance. It becomes possible to develop a studying and teaching of history approach based on the {{direct access to the}} sources, beside the more traditional methodology oriented exclusively to printed manuals, that explain the sources without making possible to view them directly. Objectives The project has the following main objectives: Facilitate the availability and reproduction of historical sources and <b>interpretative</b> materials (original <b>documents,</b> films, photos, classic text etc.) through their gathering and accessibility through Internet based Data Bases and specifically built up research engines. Promote integration between University history professors researchers, and students of different European countries involving them in a common effort for the development of an Internet Portal that will become the common point of reference for the innovation of materials and methodologies for history studying, teaching and writing. Offer new methods and e-learning materials for history studying and writing that exploiting ICT potential in terms of interactivity and accessibility of the materials, enhances an autonomous process of understanding history events and issues of the reader, through the possibility to verify the interpretation of the sources made by the writer, by accessing them directly. Target Groups The target groups are University history professors, researchers and students. Some will be directly involved {{in the creation of the}} project results. In each of the 7 countries involved in the project: Italy (2 partners), Germany (2 partners), France, Greece, Spain, Romania, Turkey, a team of at least 8 among University professors, researchers and students has been created. Activities The main activities of the History On Line project are: 1. Creation of the Project Portal technical structure and contents. 2. Creation of 2 Database collecting and making available sources on the History of Education. 3. Creation of a comprehensive transnational Webliography and Bibliography 4. Development of a training package, organised in simple and flexible e-learning modules, focusing on the theme on how to use ICT and digital sources for the studying of History. 5. Exploitation of the Portal, during which the workgroups will have the task to create an historical essay using the sources available on the Portal in order to suggest an historical interpretation of a chosen event. The essay will be created as hypertext and providing a direct link between the sources used and their interpretation. Expected Results The main project result is the History On Line Project Portal that makes available, with an user friendly interface, all the project results. The Portal is also a point of reference for the project management, making available for all partners the relevant documents and forms fot the carrying out of the project activities. The Project Portal is structured in 4 main sections: The Project – Containing all the information about the project, the documents and tools needed by the partners to carry out the project activities, the dissemination section giving evidence of all the dissemination activities carried out by the partners, the work in progress section giving evidence of the activities carried out by each partner.

Teve como objetivos identificar e analisar: i) os saberes mobilizados, transformados e produzidos pela professora-pesquisadora e, ii) as contribuições oferecidas por determinados/as interlocutores/as vinculados ao universo escolar ou universitário, para a consolidação de parte destes saberes e para a promoção de processos reflexivos. As principais referências teóricas que iluminaram a pesquisa foram os trabalhos de Zeichner (1992, 1993, 1998); Schön (2000), Tardif (1991, 2000, 2002) e Nóvoa (2000) : Por sua vez, o método construído baseou-se na proposta de autobiografia e em teorias interpretativas de documentos da professora-pesquisadora. As principais atividades e procedimentos incluem: registro de aulas por meio de gravações audiovisuais; registros em diário de bordo e anotações e gravação em áudio dos encontros reflexivos com os/as interlocutores/as. No trabalho, foi possível observar que os saberes docentes em construção, em grande parte, decorrem das influências geradas pela história de formação familiar, escolar e universitária, pelas experiências pessoais/profissionais vividas nas escolas e pelas interações da professora com os mais diversos interlocutores(as) que ela encontra no exercício profissional, em atividades formais de capacitação em serviço e durante a realização da pesquisa. A professora desenvolve sua prática procurando explorar com criatividade os espaços tradicionais de ensino; abarcando conteúdos atitudinais, procedimentais e conceituais; valorizando o diálogo e estimulando as interações e o trabalho coletivo dos/as alunos/as. A condução e sustentação do processo de ensino e aprendizagem caracteriza-se por uma seqüência articulada de atividades, pelo desenvolvimento do contrato didático e da avaliação da disciplina e da progressão das aprendizagens. Alguns dilemas são característicos de seu percurso profissional, como a gestão da matéria no tempo escolar e o desenvolvimento de um ensino que considere a realidade dos/as alunos/as. A partilha da própria prática possibilitou a objetivação de muitas teorias implícitas. As situações desequilibradoras provocadas pelos/as interlocutores geraram um envolvimento intenso da professora com o processo reflexivo sobre a prática, levando-a a algumas descobertas e a revisão de compreensões sobre o ensino. Ainda motivaram a superaração de algumas ilusões pedagógicas e de uma certa perspectiva individualista da atuação docente. A professora-pesquisadora pode compreender que muitos dos seus dilemas se constituem, principalmente, em problemas institucionais do sistema de ensino brasileiro, cujo enfrentamento requer mais do que a reflexão pessoal dos docentes. Este trabalho pode oferecer alguns sinais de que a promoção de pesquisas por professores/as do ensino médio contribui para um maior desenvolvimento profissional, a apropriação e aperfeiçoamento de seus saberes, uma percepção das lacunas a serem revistas num processo continuado e o refinamento no entendimento quanto a tornar-se professor/a. This research, with {{qualitative}} characteristics, {{involves an}} autobiographic study inserted into a perspective of continuous {{formation of the}} teacher, by means of reflexive practice. It aims at identifying and analyzing: i) the knowledge base which was recognized,transformed and produced by the teacher as researcher; and, ii) the contributions offered by certain interlocutors linked to the educational universe, to consolidate part of this knowledge and to promote reflexive processes. The main theory references which orientated this research were the works of Zeichner (1992, 1993, 1998); Schön (2000), Tardif (1991, 2000, 2002) and Nóvoa (2000). On the other hand, the method used {{was based on an}} autobiographic proposal and on <b>interpretative</b> theories of <b>documents</b> of the teacher as researcher. The main activities and procedures include filming the classes, day-by-day written records, and audio record of the reflexive meetings with the interlocutors. During the work, it was possible to observe that the teachers knowledge under development mostly derivate from the background influence generated by family, school and university lives, by the personal/professional experiences in schools, and by the interactions of the teacher and a number of interlocutors she met while working, both in formal training activities and during the research. The teacher developed her practice by creatively exploring the traditional teaching places, bringing up contents of attitude, procedures and concepts, valorizing the discussion and stimulating the interactions and the collective work of the students. The conduction and sustenance of the teachinglearning process is characterized by an articulated sequence of activities, by the development of the didactic contract and by the evaluation of the discipline and progression of learning. Some dilemmas are typical of her professional life, such as the handling of the subject in school time {{and the development of a}} teaching technique which consider the reality of the students. The division of the teaching experience allowed the objectivity of several implicit theories. The unbalancing situations caused by the interlocutors created an intense involvement of the teacher with the reflexive process about practice, leading to some discoveries and to the revision of the understanding of teaching. Moreover, they motivated the overcome of some pedagogical illusions and of an individualist perspective of the teaching activity. The teacher-researcher could understand that many of her dilemmas are especially constituted of institutional problems of the Brazilian educational system, which needs more than just the personal reflection of the teachers. This work may offer some clues that the promotion of researches by high school teachers contribute to an increase of the professional development, to the appropriation and improvement of their knowledge base, to a perception of the gaps to be reviewed in a continued process, and to the refining of the decision about becoming a teacher...|$|R
