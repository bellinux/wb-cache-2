The mechanical properties (i.e., modulus of rupture and elasticity, <b>internal</b> <b>bonding</b> <b>strength)</b> of boards increased with increasing board density and met the requirement for 15 type medium-density fiberboard (MDF) by JIS A 5905 - 1994.

The hole diameter of 1  mm was the best for the <b>internal</b> <b>bond</b> <b>strength</b> when the hole spacing was 25  mm, but there was no specific diameter for the 50 -mm spacing. As shown in Fig.  2, the optimum hole diameter for <b>internal</b> <b>bond</b> <b>strength</b> was demonstrated, and as shown in Figs.  1 and 3, that for modulus of rupture and thickness swelling was not demonstrated.

The mechanism of <b>internal</b> <b>bond</b> <b>strength</b> was very simple, and that of modulus of rupture and thickness swelling was too complex to understand. The <b>internal</b> <b>bond</b> <b>strength</b> depends on only bonding strength, while, for example, the modulus of rupture depends on particle length and density of face layer including bonding strength, and so on.

The physical properties of composite materials are often described by the rule of mixtures, representing the average physical properties of the reinforcement and the matrix resin. However, in practical applications there are situations which arise where the rule of mixtures is not followed.
