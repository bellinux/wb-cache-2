5|$|ATP synthase, {{also called}} complex V, {{is the final}} enzyme in the {{oxidative}} phosphorylation pathway. This enzyme is found in all forms of life and functions {{in the same way}} in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. The enzyme uses the <b>energy</b> <b>stored</b> in a proton gradient across a membrane to drive the synthesis of ATP from ADP and phosphate (Pi). Estimates of the number of protons required to synthesize one ATP have ranged from three to four, with some suggesting cells can vary this ratio, to suit different conditions.|$|E
5|$|In eukaryotes, the enzymes in this {{electron}} {{transport system}} use the energy {{released from the}} oxidation of NADH to pump protons across the inner membrane of the mitochondrion. This causes protons to build up in the intermembrane space, and generates an electrochemical gradient across the membrane. The <b>energy</b> <b>stored</b> in this potential is then used by ATP synthase to produce ATP. Oxidative phosphorylation in the eukaryotic mitochondrion is the best-understood example of this process. The mitochondrion is present in almost all eukaryotes, {{with the exception of}} anaerobic protozoa such as Trichomonas vaginalis that instead reduce protons to hydrogen in a remnant mitochondrion called a hydrogenosome.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Gas Spring is an {{important}} component of an <b>energy</b> <b>storing</b> prosthetic knee. The spring <b>stored</b> <b>energy</b> during flexion and released the energy while in the extension. In this research, we discuss a Monte Carlo simulation model of a gas spring in an Energy Storing Prosthetic Knee (ESPK) using Oracle Crystal Ball software. The simulation is used to predict the effects of three important design variables of a gas spring which are cylinder diameter, cylinder length, and displacement to the <b>energy</b> <b>storing</b> performance of the spring. The results of simulation show that there are two design variables which have significant contribution to the variations of <b>energy</b> <b>storing</b> performance: cylinder diameter and displacement. Those design variables account for 99. 3 % to the total variance of <b>energy</b> <b>storing.</b> Quality improvement must be conducted to lowering the resulted <b>energy</b> <b>storing</b> variance. We proportionally decrease the variance of the design variables to lowering the <b>energy</b> <b>storing</b> variance. The simulation results show a significant quality improvement of about 50 % in term of <b>energy</b> <b>storing</b> standard deviation. The results also show that cylinder diameter is more sensitive than the other two design variables in <b>energy</b> <b>storing</b> quality improvement...|$|R

In the Halobacteria, light-activated ion pumps like bacteriorhodopsin and halorhodopsin generate ion gradients by pumping ions out of the cell across the plasma membrane.

An <b>energy</b> <b>storing</b> and returning composite prosthetic foot was first used in elite competition at the 1988 Paralympic Games. Since its introduction, the prostheses have proven {{to be a source of}} controversy. In 2008, it was concluded that the athletes who use such technology when running are in advantageous position when compared to able-bodied athletes. However, these findings have since been disputed. There still remain unanswered questions regarding the level of contribution of <b>energy</b> <b>storing</b> and returning feet in the performance of amputee athletes. A series of investigations have previously been conducted to study the dynamic characteristics of a number of <b>energy</b> <b>storing</b> and returning composite prosthetic feet. It was found that if a sinusoidal input impulse, with a frequency close to one of the <b>energy</b> <b>storing</b> and returning feetâ€™s natural frequencies, could be applied, it can make the <b>energy</b> <b>storing</b> and returning foot susceptible to resonance, which, in the case of bending mode, if sustained can lead to a gain in height or increased velocity...|$|R

40|$|Tendon is {{composed}} of rope-like fascicles bound together by interfascicular matrix (IFM). The IFM is critical for the function of <b>energy</b> <b>storing</b> tendons, facilitating sliding between fascicles to allow these tendons to cyclically stretch and recoil. This capacity is required {{to a lesser degree}} in positional tendons. We have previously demonstrated that both fascicles and IFM in <b>energy</b> <b>storing</b> tendons have superior fatigue resistance compared with positional tendons, but the effect of ageing on the fatigue properties of these different tendon subunits has not been determined. <b>Energy</b> <b>storing</b> tendons become more injury-prone with ageing, indicating reduced fatigue resistance, hence we tested the hypothesis that the decline in fatigue life with ageing in <b>energy</b> <b>storing</b> tendons would be more pronounced in the IFM than in fascicles. We further hypothesised that tendon subunit fatigue resistance would not alter with ageing in positional tendons. Fascicles and IFM from young and old <b>energy</b> <b>storing</b> and positional tendons were subjected to cyclic fatigue testing until failure, and mechanical properties were calculated. The results show that both IFM and fascicles from the SDFT exhibit a similar magnitude of reduced fatigue life with ageing. By contrast, the fatigue life of positional tendon subunits was unaffected by ageing. The age-related decline in fatigue life of tendon subunits in <b>energy</b> <b>storing</b> tendons is likely to contribute to the increased risk of injury in aged tendons. Full understanding of the mechanisms resulting in this reduced fatigue life will aid in the development of treatments and interventions to prevent age-related tendinopathy...|$|R
