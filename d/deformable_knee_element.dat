40|$|The 1994 Northridge and 1995 Kobe earthquakes, {{which were}} {{moderate}} in seismological terms, showed that many buildings {{were subjected to}} demolition or very expensive repairs because of severe damage in principle members, mainly in the column-beam connections. As a result, the development of dissipative systems was encouraged, which limit the damage parts to easily replaceable elements, in case of moderate earthquakes. One such system is the knee braced frame. Knee braced frames are a modified form of cross bracing in which the brace is cut short and connected to the mid point of a <b>knee</b> <b>element</b> spanning between the adjacent beam and column. The key component is the <b>knee</b> <b>element,</b> which controls both the initial elastic stiffness of the frame, and the onset of yield and subsequent energy dissipation.

30|$|In knee braced frames, the braces are {{attached}} to the <b>knee</b> <b>element</b> rather than the intersection of beams and columns. This bracing system is widely used and preferred over the other commonly used systems for reasons such as having lateral stiffness while having adequate ductility, damage concentration on the second degree convenience of repairing and replacing of these elements after Earthquake. The lateral stiffness of this system is supplied by the bracing member and the ductility of the frame attached to the knee length is supplied through the bending or shear yield of the knee member. In this paper, the nonlinear seismic behavior of knee braced frame systems has been investigated using incremental dynamic analysis (IDA) and the effects of the number of stories in a building, length and the moment of inertia of the knee member on the seismic behavior, elastic stiffness, ductility and the probability of failure of these systems has been determined. In the incremental dynamic analysis, after plotting the IDA diagrams of the accelerograms, the collapse diagrams in the limit states are determined. These diagrams yield that for a constant knee length with reduced moment of inertia, the probability of collapse in limit states heightens and also for a constant knee moment of inertia with increasing length, the probability of collapse in limit states increases.|$|R
40|$|The use {{of steel}} bracing systems for {{upgrading}} seismically insufficient structures is a feasible solution by enhancing the global stiffness {{and strength of}} such structures. Moreover, steel bracing systems have relatively low cost and easy construction phases. For this purpose, several configurations of steel bracing systems can be applied for upgrading the seismic behavior of the structures. The most frequently utilized systems comprise concentrically-braced frames, eccentrically-braced frames, and knee-brace frames [1]. In the last few decades, the seismic behavior and design of new steel structures with knee bracing systems has been studied extensively due to its efficiency as an earthquake resisting system [2 - 8]. Indeed, the structures with knee bracing can be designed to be stiff enough to control structural and nonstructural damage, and ductile enough to prevent sudden collapse. In order to achieve these purposes, the lateral stiffness {{is provided by the}} brace elements and ductility by the <b>knee</b> <b>elements</b> through the formation of plastic behavior for dissipation of the energy under earthquakes.

40|$|Buchanan, Thomas S. Snyder-Mackler, LynnPremature knee {{osteoarthritis}} (OA) after {{anterior cruciate}} ligament reconstruction (ACLR) surgery is a growing concern. Aberrant knee gait mechanics and joint loads are thought to affect cartilage stress distribution and the incidence of knee OA after ACLR. Knee OA occurs more frequently in the medial compartment, compared to the lateral compartment. All subjects with medial compartment knee OA demonstrate a radiographic osteophyte near the medial joint margin. However, not all subjects get knee OA five years after ACLR. Comparing knee gait mechanics and joint loads in subjects with and without knee OA may be key in establishing rehabilitation and treatment strategies to delay the progression of the disease. The first question this proposal evaluates is “what are the differences in knee gait mechanics and joint loads in those with/without medial compartment knee OA after ACLR, and when are these differences present?” To that end, knee OA was evaluated five years after ACLR, while knee gait mechanics and joint loads were evaluated at multiple time points, i. e. before ACLR, six months, one year and five years after ACLR. All parameters were evaluated at the first peak of vertical ground reaction force during the stance phase of gait. Gait analysis and electromyography (EMG) -informed neuromusculoskeletal (NMS) modeling methods were used for this aim. Six months after ACLR, subjects with knee OA demonstrated inter-limb differences in flexion angle/moment, adduction moment and joint loads, with lower values for the involved knee, compared to the uninvolved knee. These inter-limb differences ceased to exist at later time points. These results indicate that an initial period of under-loading of the involved knee is followed by {{an extended period of}} symmetrical loading, in subjects who get medial compartment knee OA five years after ACLR. For the involved knee, five years after ACLR, subjects with knee OA demonstrated lower values for flexion angle/moment, higher value for adduction moment (not statistically significant, but with large effect size) and similar joint loads, compared to subjects without knee OA. These results indicate that while both groups show inter-limb symmetry five years after ACLR, knee gait mechanics are different between these groups. Hence, the uninvolved knee (of subjects with knee OA in the involved knee) may also be at risk of developing knee OA at future time points. The second question this proposal evaluates is “how is cartilage stress distribution near the medial joint margin (region of radiographic osteophyte, under the medial meniscus) affected due to knee gait mechanics and joint loading, in those with/without medial compartment knee OA after ACLR?” Utilizing a combination of knee gait mechanics, joint load and load distribution between <b>deformable</b> <b>knee</b> joint structures is necessary to estimate cartilage stress distribution. Hence, finite element (FE) modeling was used for this aim. Medial tibial cartilage stresses were evaluated at multiple time points, i. e. six months, one year and five years after ACLR, using knee gait mechanics and joint loads from the first aim as inputs. For the involved knee, five years after surgery, subjects with knee OA demonstrated higher values for peak effective stress in the region near the medial joint margin. These results show that stresses are indeed higher in the region where radiographic osteophytes are observed five years after ACLR in subjects with knee OA, compared to subjects without knee OA. These results help to reinforce the link between altered gait and knee OA. The third question this proposal explores is “how soon can changes in cartilage tissue be detected, and is there a relation between joint loading and cartilage tissue level changes?” For inter-limb differences in subjects who get medial compartment knee OA five years after ACLR, evidence of under-loading was present at early time points (six months) after ACLR. Also, cartilage tissue level changes, which may be present at early time points after ACLR, would precede the appearance of radiographic osteophytes. To explore the changes in cartilage at early time points, T 2 maps (using quantitative magnetic resonance imaging, or qMRI) were established for two additional subjects, one with evidence of under-loading in the involved knee, and one with symmetric loading. Both subjects had completed gait analysis one year after ACLR. The subject with under-loading of the involved knee did demonstrate higher T 2 values (indicative of potential collagen matrix degradation) in the involved knee, compared to the uninvolved knee, and also greater inter-limb differences, compared to the subject with symmetric loading. These results, while from {{a very small number of}} subjects, warrant further investigation to establish or reject a potential correlation between early inter-limb loading differences and early cartilage tissue level changes. The sooner that the presence of OA related changes is detected, either directly or indirectly, the greater the potential for intervention to delay the progression of OA. Future studies that implement a combination of the above methodologies (NMS + FE + qMRI) can aid in early detection, prediction and treatment of knee OA.

Although the relationship between obesity and knee OA is well established, the mechanism of pathogenesis is less understood. Excess body weight generates greater joint contact forces at the knee.

Both a peg and stem type geometry were analyzed and compared in order to determine what type geometry causes the least amount of stress shielding.

Regions of interest include the posterior and medial regions, at depths ranging from the resurfaced tibial surface to 100 mm below the surface. It was found that the smallest stem/peg sizes produced the least amount of stress shielding, indicating that the less amount of foreign material within the tibia, the more natural the bending and stress response of the tibia. It was also concluded that for the loading conditions used in this study, peg type geometry yields a decreased amount of stress shielding when compared to stem type geometry. This is due to the fact that the peg type geometry allowed for more natural bending and a distributed loading transfer between two pegs rather than one long central stem. Further studies should be completed on other geometry types in order to understand how to best replicate the natural bending of the tibia...|$|R

A 3 -Dimensional finite <b>element</b> <b>knee</b> joint model, including bones and ligament bundles, was developed. Bone was modeled as rigid, and a transversely isotropic material {{was applied to the}} ligament structures. This study incorporates a novel approach for developing bundle specific prestrain within the ligament structures. The bundles were stretched from their zero load lengths to their reference lengths, producing a strain field mimicking in vivo conditions at full knee extension. A failure locus was created by performing multiple knee joint motion combination simulations until ligament failure. The locus shows which movement combinations of internal/external femoral rotation and varus/valgus angle cause failure within the ACL bundles at 25 ° of knee flexion. The 3 D model provided improved accuracy for locating bundle ruptures. By monitoring stresses and strains within the ligament bundles during knee joint orientation simulations, ruptures were virtually diagnosed. The relationship between knee joint orientation and ligament rupture provides a spectrum for the propensity of ACL injury. The results highlight femoral external rotation relative to the tibia as an important factor related to ACL injury. The results also show the posterolateral bundle to be more susceptible to rupture than the anteromedial bundle. These results have various clinical applications.

Knee implants that allow for higher flexion may be more sensitive to femoral loosening as the knee load is relatively high during deep knee flexion, which could result in an increased failure potential at the implant-cement interface of the femoral component. A 3 D finite <b>element</b> <b>knee</b> model was developed including a posterior-stabilized high-flexion knee replacement to analyze the stress state at the femoral implant-cement interface during a full squatting movement (RoM 120 degrees), tensile and shear stress concentrations were found at the implant-cement interface beneath the proximal part of the anterior flange. Particularly, the shear stresses at this interface location increased during high flexion, from a peak stress of 4. 03 MPa at 90 degrees to 6. 89 MPa at 140 degrees of flexion. Tensile stresses were substantially lower, having a peak stress of 0. 72 MPa at 100 degrees of flexion. Using data from earlier interface strength experiments, none of the interface beneath the anterior flange was predicted to fail in the normal flexion range (RoM </= 120 degrees), whereas the prediction increased to 2. 2 % of the interface during deeper knee flexion. Thigh-calf contact reduced the knee forces, interface load, and failure risk beyond 140 - 145 degrees of flexion. Based on the more critical stresses at the femoral fixation site between 120 degrees and 145 degrees of flexion, we conclude that the femoral component has a higher risk of loosening at high-flexion angles...|$|R
40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{deals with}} the possibility of using physiotherapy in the prevention and correction of muscle imbalances in field cyclists. Off-road cycling is increasingly popular in the Czech Republic. Not only for the general public but also for the competitors, unilateral loading without adequate compensation. Muscular dysbalance leads to increased risk of injuries and muscle damage. The first theoretical part deals with anatomy and kinesiology of the lower limbs. Further, the theoretical part is focused on the description of the correct setting of the wheel, the starting position and, last but not least, the distribution of muscle imbalances. The practical part of the thesis was elaborated by the method of qualitative research. The tracked group was three cyclists. The research was developed on the basis of comparisons of case studies, including the taking of anamnestic probanda data using a controlled interview, initial kinesiological analysis, a short-term therapeutic plan, the course of individual therapies, followed by output kinesiological analysis, and a long-term therapeutic plan. Therapy lasted 6 weeks with incliding each proband twice a week. Within the therapy there were used soft tissue techniques, mobilization, fine traction, joint centrifugation, postisometric contraction, stretching and breathing exercises, activation of deep stabilization system, back school <b>elements,</b> <b>knee</b> stabilization exercises, sensomotor stimulation, Brunkow exercises, MS exercises System, DNS exercises. The aim of the work was to approach the problem of overload of the locomotive apparatus in field cyclists {{from the point of view}} of physiotherapy and to outline the possibilities of specific methods for prevention, restoration and improvement of muscular balance of individual muscles and muscle groups...|$|R
40|$|Background: interpositional {{arthroplasty}} {{is considered}} by many surgeons for the treatment of isolated medial compartment osteoarthritis of the knee. In this procedure, an interpositional spacer is inserted into the medial compartment of the joint with no bone resection and no mechanical fixation. Major problems such as implant dislocation, severe pain or need for revision have been reported post-operatively. Methods: in this study, the kinematics of a knee implanted with an interpositional spacer made of either polyurethane or cobalt–chrome during walking, stair ascent and squatting cycles have been predicted and compared to the normal <b>knee</b> using finite <b>element</b> analysis. In addition, articular cartilage stress histories have been examined to obtain distributions of cumulative stress, a measure of the likelihood of articular cartilage degeneration. Findings: the insertion of a polyurethane interpositional spacer in the medial side of the knee did not affect knee kinematics as compared to the normal knee, but caused an increase of articular cartilage cumulative contact stress exposures in the medial compartment of the joint. The knee implanted with the Co–Cr spacer exhibited similar trends in knee kinematics, however significantly different ranges of motion were observed during some periods of the activity cycles, specifically {{during the first half of}} the walking cycle where lower ranges of motion were predicted. In addition, higher articular cartilage cumulative contact stress exposures were observed in both compartments of the knee. In both cases, cumulative contact stress exposures of the tibial articular cartilage were more affected than those of the femoral articular cartilage. Interpretation: these results suggest implant material as an important parameter in the design phase of interpositional spacer...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectives To {{evaluate}} {{the effects of}} work-related and individual factors {{as well as physical}} activity and sports on the incidence and persistence of knee pain among a working population. Design Employees of a large Finnish forestry company replied to a questionnaire (a modified version of the Nordic Questionnaire) on musculoskeletal pain and its possible risk factors at the baseline of this study. A cohort of 2122 workers free of knee pain and another cohort of 333 workers with severe knee pain were followed up for one year. The effects of the risk factors on the incidence and persistence of knee pain were studied using multivariable logistic regression models. Results A total of 214 (10 %) workers developed knee pain during the follow-up. Significant predictors of incident knee pain in the multivariable model were higher age, overweight, smoking, and previous knee injuries. Also, working with the trunk forward flexed in kneeling or standing position and physically strenuous work were non-significant predictors of incident knee pain. Of those 333 workers with severe knee pain at baseline, 220 (66 %) still reported severe knee pain after one year. Higher age and job dissatisfaction increased the risk of persistent symptoms. General physical exercise and different sports activities did not predict the incidence or persistence of knee pain. Conclusions In this large prospective study, the risk factors for self-reported knee pain seemed to be highly similar to the risk factors for knee osteoarthritis (OA) reported in other papers. Age, previous knee injuries, overweight, and knee-straining work were those risk factors, which contributed to the incidence of <b>knee</b> pain. Psychosocial <b>elements</b> of work were more involved in the persistence of the symptoms in the knee. Copyright 2002 OsteoArthritis Research Society International.

40|$|Total knee {{arthroplasty}} (TKA) is {{a widely}} used and successful orthopaedic procedure. During TKA, the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) can either be retained or substituted by a post-cam mechanism. One of the main functions of the PCL is to facilitate femoral rollback during knee flexion. For adequate PCL functioning, the PCL should be balanced correctly after TKA. A tight PCL leads to more femoral rollback {{at the expense of}} a higher joint compression and potential polyethylene wear. Frequently used surgical techniques to balance a tight PCL are PCL release and increasing the posterior tibial slope. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effects of variations in PCL properties and balancing techniques on the mechanical outcome of a total knee replacement during a weight-bearing squatting movement (flexion range = 45 – 150 °). For this purpose, a prosthetic finite <b>element</b> <b>knee</b> model was developed including a PCL having adjustable properties. Varying the PCL stiffness and PCL steepness (elevation angle) with respect to the tibial plateau considerably affected the TKA loading characteristics. Both a relatively high PCL stiffness and a low elevation angle at the start of the flexion cycle led to a high PCL force (1400 – 1500 N) and a high peak polyethylene contact stress of roughly 52 MPa during deeper knee flexion (120 °). Releasing the PCL with roughly 4 mm or increasing the posterior tibial slope to 7 ° reduced the PCL force to 300 – 400 N and the polyethylene peak contact stress to 35 – 42 MPa at 120 ° of flexion. The femoral rollback patterns during deep knee flexion were only marginally affected when extra posterior tibial slope was added, whereas additional PCL release resulted in paradoxical anterior movement of the femur...|$|R
40|$|SummaryObjectiveAs {{cartilage}} {{loss and}} bone marrow lesions (BMLs) {{are associated with}} knee joint pain and structural worsening, this study assessed whether non-invasive estimates of articular contact stress may longitudinally predict risk for worsening of knee cartilage morphology and BMLs. DesignThis was a longitudinal cohort study of adults aged 50 – 79  years with risk factors for knee osteoarthritis. Baseline and follow-up measures included whole-organ magnetic resonance imaging score (WORMS) classification of knee cartilage morphology and BMLs. Tibiofemoral geometry was manually segmented on baseline magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and three-dimensional (3 D) tibiofemoral point clouds were registered into subject-specific loaded apposition using fixed-flexion <b>knee</b> radiographs. Discrete <b>element</b> analysis (DEA) was used to estimate mean and peak contact stresses for the medial and lateral compartments. The association of baseline contact stress with worsening cartilage and BMLs in the same subregion over 30  months was assessed using conditional logistic regression. ResultsSubjects (N =  38, 60. 5 % female) had a mean ± standard deviation (SD) age and body mass index (BMI) of 63. 5  ±  8. 4  years and 30. 5  ±  3. 7  kg/m 2 respectively. Elevated mean articular contact stress at baseline was associated with worsening cartilage morphology and worsening BMLs by 30  months, with odds ratio (OR) [95 % confidence interval (CI) ] of 4. 0 (2. 5, 6. 4) and 6. 6 (2. 7, 16. 5) respectively. Peak contact stress also {{was significantly associated with}} worsening cartilage morphology and BMLs { 1. 9 (1. 5, 2. 3) and 2. 3 (1. 5, 3. 6) }(all P <  0. 0001). ConclusionsDetection of higher contact stress 30  months prior to structural worsening suggests an etiological role for mechanical loading. Estimation of articular contact stress with DEA is an efficient and accurate means of predicting subregion-specific knee joint worsening and may be useful in guiding prognosis and treatment...|$|R
