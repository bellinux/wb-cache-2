40|$|In the past, Gracilaria tenuistipitata {{was used}} to feed abalone (<b>ear</b> <b>shell),</b> so the {{economic}} value was very low. Recently the price of Gracilaria tenuistipitata increased since it {{was used as an}} edible food material. The objective {{of this study is to}} try to compare the properties of Gracilaria tenuistipitata under 9 different blanching processing and to identify the optimal one. The blanching processes contained adding additives and cooling. This study used 3 different kinds of additives (non-additive, 0. 6 % NaCl, 1 % CaCl 2) and 3 different cooling methods (natural cooling, water cooling, cold water cooling) with a total of 9 different blanching treatments. The products of different blanching processing were measures and evaluated by their crispiness, color, moisture content, flavor, texture. Based on the experimental results, the effect of cooling method on the crispiness was not significant. It seemed that 0. 6 % NaCl additive didn't affect the cutting energy significantly. With 1 % CaCl 2 additive, the cutting force and cutting energy increased significantly. The moisture content of Gracilaria tenuistipitata increased after any blanching processing. Comparing to the natural cooling method, the moisture contents of samples with water cooling were higher. After blanching processing, the L, a and b values for color testing of blanched samples increased dramatically. This meant that the blanched samples turned brighter and yellow-green after the blanching which was more accepted by consumers. The cooling method did not affect the color of blanched samples. However, various additives may make some samples appearing b value and changing their chroma. Besides, the extracts of Gracilaria tenuistipitata samples with various blanching conditions were concentrated, and adjusted their concentration to 2. 5, 3. 0, 5. 0 and 10. 0 mg/ml. Then the reducing properties, the ability to scavenge DPPH (1, 1 -diphenyl- 2 -picrylhydrazyl) free radicals and chelating effect were measured. The experimental results showed that the reduction ability with methanol extracts were not significant. With 10. 0 mg/ml methanol concentration, it can scavenge 15. 75 % DPPH free radicals. In regards of chelating with Fe 2 +, the extract with 10. 0 mg/ml methanol was 39. 90 %, which was higher than 18. 94 % of the control treatment (10. 0 mg/ml citric acid). Based on the sensor evaluation, blanched sample with 0. 6 % NaCl and 5 ℃ cold water cooling method had the highest score. 龍鬚菜過去因為作為九孔養殖之餌料，故經濟價值很低。近年來業者將龍鬚菜作為生機蔬菜之食材，其利用價值可大為提高。本研究以養殖龍鬚菜（Gracilaria tenuistipitata）為原料，依據殺菁條件（添加物及冷卻方式）之不同，將添加物分為不添加任何添加物、添加 0. 6 ％氯化鈉、添加 1 ％氯化鈣；冷卻方式分自然冷卻、 25 ℃冷水冷卻及 5 ℃冰水冷卻等共 9 組處理，進行殺菁作業。評估各種殺菁條件對脆度、顏色、含水率、風味、口感之影響，針對冷凍龍鬚菜提出最佳之殺菁加工條件。實驗結果顯示：冷卻方式對脆度的影響不大，不加添加物及加入 0. 6 %氯化鈉並不影響截切能量，但添加 1 %的氯化鈣，截切力及截切能量明顯變高。可由官能品評驗證。殺菁作業後含水率會提高，殺菁後冷水冷卻比殺菁後自然冷卻其含水率較高。冷卻方式及添加物的不同會明顯地影響產品的含水率。殺菁後其顏色L值、b值與a值比未殺菁的增加較多，表示殺菁後龍鬚菜顏色較明亮且偏黃綠色，一般民眾較能接受。其中不同冷卻方式對顏色之影響不大；但添加物的不同會造成b值及彩度有明顯的改變。 另外，取不同殺菁之龍鬚菜萃取液進行乾燥濃縮，調整其濃度為 2. 5 、 3. 0 、 5. 0 及 10. 0 mg/ml，檢測其還原力、清除DPPH自由基及螯合亞鐵離子之能力。結果顯示：還原力在甲醇萃取物較無顯著能力。甲醇萃取物於 10. 0 mg/ml之濃度，清除DPPH自由基能力可達 15. 75 %。在螯合亞鐵離子能力方面，甲醇萃取物於 10. 0 mg/ml達 39. 90 %，較對照組檸檬酸（ 10. 0 mg/ml）之 18. 94 %為高。 官能品評結果顯示，殺菁添加 0. 6 ％氯化鈉及 5 ℃冰水冷卻之龍鬚菜評比最佳。壹、緒論 ．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．	 01 1. 1 前言 ．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．	 01 1. 2 研究目的 ．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．． 	 02 貳、文獻探討 ．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．	 03 2. 1 龍鬚菜 ．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．	 03 2. 2 龍鬚菜之養殖 ．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．	 04 2. 3 龍鬚菜之成份性質及利用 ．．．．．．．．．．．	 05 2. 4 龍鬚菜之保健功能 ．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．	 08 2. 5 龍鬚菜之加工應用 ．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．	 16 2. 6 殺菁 ．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．	 17 2. 7 脆度測定 ．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．	 19 2. 8 顏色 ．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．	 20 2. 9 抗氧化性質 ．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．	 21 參、材料與方法 ．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．	 32 3. 1 實驗材料與設備 ．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．	 32 3. 1. 1 實驗材料 ．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．	 32 3. 1. 2 實驗設備 ．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．	 32 3. 2 實驗設計 ．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．	 33 3. 2. 1 殺菁實驗 ．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．	 33 3. 2. 2 冷藏環境下之顏色變化實驗 ．．．．．．．．．	 34 3. 2. 3 抗氧化功能實驗 ．．．．．．．．．．．．．．	 35 3. 3 測定項目及方法 ．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．	 35 3. 3. 1 物理特性之量測項目及分析方法	 ．．．．．．．	 35 3. 3. 1. 1 脆度之測定 ．．．．．．．．．．．．．．	 35 3. 3. 1. 2 顏色之測定 ．．．．．．．．．．．．．．	 35 3. 3. 1. 3 含水率之測定 ．．．．．．．．．．．．．	 36 3. 3. 2 抗氧化功能之量測項目及分析方法 ．．．．．．	 36 3. 3. 2. 1 藻體粉末製備 ．．．．．．．．．．．．．	 36 3. 3. 2. 2 樣品萃取 ．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．	 36 3. 3. 2. 3 清除DPPH自由基能力之測定 ．．．．．．	 37 3. 3. 2. 4 螯合亞鐵離子能力之測定 ．．．．．．．．	 38 3. 3. 2. 5 還原能力之測定 ．．．．．．．．．．．．	 39 3. 4 官能品評．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．	 39 3. 5 統計分析 ．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．	 40 肆、結果與討論 ．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．	 41 4. 1 物理特性之量測結果與討論 ．．．．．．．．．．	 41 4. 1. 1 脆度之測定 ．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．	 41 4. 1. 2 顏色之測定 ．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．	 45 4. 1. 3 含水率之測定 ．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．	 54 4. 2 抗氧化功能之量測結果與討論 ．．．．．．．．．	 73 4. 2. 1 清除DPPH自由基能力之測定 ．．．．．．．．	 73 4. 2. 2 螯合亞鐵離子能力之測定 ．．．．．．．．．．	 74 4. 2. 3 還原能力之測定 ．．．．．．．．．．．．．．	 78 4. 3. 官能品評結果與討論．．．．．．．．．．．．．．	 83 伍、結論 ．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．． 92 陸、對今後研究工作之建議 ．．．．．．．．．．．．．． 94 柒、參考文獻 ．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．． 95 附錄 ．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．．． 10...|$|E

40|$|Much of the {{non-irrigated}} corn {{grown in}} Nebraska and surrounding states is frequently subjected to moisture stress. Moisture stress on corn during the vegetative {{stage of growth}} indirectly affects grain yield by reducing plant height and photosynthetic area. During the reproductive stage of growth, moisture stress directly affects corn grain yield by preventing fertilization and/or kernel development. Field studies were conducted at Lincoln, Nebraska in 1968 and Mead, Nebraska, in 1969 {{to determine the effects}} of propanil (3, 4 -dichloropropionanilide) as an antitranspirant on corn (Zea mays, L.).
