40|$|The {{problem of}} {{plagiarism}} {{as the process}} of constructing the imagined secure world by the plagiarist has been studied. The author has attempted to trace the chain from motives {{of the person who}} not only unfairly borrows items and deceives the society, but also objects to its own reality, to means of destroying its illusory world. It has been found that illusory <b>security</b> <b>of</b> the plagiarist is an artificial temporary product, and the person itself, with hedonistic intentions and fear his or her actions are based on, at least does not want to create and perform new assignments professionally. Plagiarism as a phenomenon and illusory world of plagiarism have an ethical base as unfair borrowing breaches scientific (academic) ethics. Duration <b>of</b> illusory <b>security</b> depends on response of the micro environment, society and changes of personal values. The article considers consequences of creation of the illusory system on grounds of plagiarism within the framework <b>of</b> educational <b>security.</b> Ukrainian universities still disregard the security problem, and have only recently begun to abolish plagiarism as a mass phenomenon. Harmfulness of plagiarism and its influence over educational security are also based on the economic factor: costs under principal expenditure items in national education and science. The second part of the article proposes three levels <b>of</b> problem solution: <b>destruction</b> <b>of</b> the illusory world of the plagiarist (consciousness is specified as the base of professional ethics of a party to scientific and educational activity); abilities of multi-directional influence of the micro environment over the non-ethical behaviour of the person by information and warning means is substantiated; the legal framework for struggle against plagiarism in education and science under the Law of Ukraine on Higher Education is described. The author summarizes that the best impulse and most efficient mechanism in elimination of plagiarism itself and <b>destruction</b> <b>of</b> imagined <b>security</b> in plagiarism is response of the person?s environment. ????????? ???????????? ???????? ??????????????? ??? ???????? ?????????? ??????????? ???????? ??????????? ????. ??????? ??????????? ??????? ?????????? ???? ?? ??????? ????????, ??????? ????????? ? ???????????????? ?????????????? ? ?????? ? ??????????? ?? ?????? ????????, ?? ? ???????? ??????????? ??????????, ? ???????? ?????????? ??? ??????????? ????. ????????, ??? ?????????? ???????????? ?????????? ???????? ????????????? ????????? ????????????, ? ???? ???? ? ? ???????????????? ??????????? ? ??????? ? ?????? ????? ???????? ???, ??? ???????, ?? ????? ???????, ??????????????? ????????? ????? ??????. ??????????? ??? ??????? ? ?????????? ??? ???????? ????? ????????? ??????, ???? ???????????????? ????????????? ???????? ???????
