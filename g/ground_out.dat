5|$|After {{getting one}} {{out in the}} top of the 7th, Steve Trachsel allowed a single and a walk to pinch hitters Brent Mayne and Armando Ríos respectively. The Cubs double switched, {{bringing}} in Matt Karchner to relieve Trachsel and Orlando Merced to play left field. Karchner induced another out before loading the bases on a single by Shawon Dunston. Félix Heredia entered in relief of Karchner and got Barry Bonds to <b>ground</b> <b>out</b> to first base to end the inning. The Cubs further extended their lead in the bottom of the 8th inning. After Alvin Morman got Morandini to strike out to open the inning the Giants double switched to bring in José Mesa to pitch and Bill Mueller at third base. Mesa allowed a single to Sammy Sosa and a double to Mark Grace which advanced Sosa to third. Following a <b>ground</b> <b>out</b> Mesa threw a wild pitch while facing Gaetti and Sosa scored to make the game 5–0.|$|E
5|$|Chicago White Sox manager Al López {{watched the}} game {{along with his}} {{pitching}} coach to scout their potential NL opponents for the World Series. The start of Game 1 was delayed 45 minutes due to rain, leaving only 18,297 fans in the stadium once the game was underway. The Dodgers opened the game quickly as Charlie Neal singled with one out, advanced to second base on a <b>ground</b> <b>out,</b> and scored on a single by Norm Larker to give the Dodgers an early 1–0 lead. Dodgers starter Danny McDevitt held the Braves scoreless in the first inning, but was driven from {{the game in the}} second. After a line out to open the inning Johnny Logan walked, Del Crandall singled, and Bill Bruton singled to bring home Logan and tie the game at 1. Larry Sherry entered in relief of McDevitt, who pitched just 1 innings. Carl Willey, the Braves' pitcher, reached base on an error to load the bases. Crandall then scored on a <b>ground</b> <b>out</b> by Bobby Ávila to give the Braves a 2–1 lead before Sherry finished out the second.|$|E
40|$|Recent {{advances}} in SAT solvers {{have made it}} attractive to translate a variety of problems to SAT. In many cases, the source language is a logic that includes quanti ers. <b>Grounding</b> <b>out</b> these quanti ers can be a bottleneck. One way to mitigate the problem is to join isomorphic subtrees of the ground formula, so that the syntax tree becomes a DAG. Because the ground tree is large, detecting isomorphism after <b>grounding</b> <b>out</b> is impractical. However, detecting isomorphism prior to <b>grounding</b> <b>out</b> will miss many isomorphisms in the ground form...|$|R

5|$|The force out: {{recorded}} {{against a}} runner who {{is required to}} attempt to advance—either because the runner is on first base and a batted ball lands in fair territory, or because the runner immediately behind on the basepath is thus required to attempt to advance—but fails to reach the next base before a fielder touches the base while holding the ball. The <b>ground</b> <b>out</b> is technically a special case of the force out.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, {{the metal}} {{used for the}} gandingan was bronze but due to its {{scarcity}} after WWII, gandingan are more commonly made of less valuable metals such as steel sheets. Recently, galvanized steel sheets {{have been used by}} Maguindanaon instrument manufacturers where different parts of the gong (the knob, body and rim) would be made from separate sheets and welded together, then <b>ground</b> <b>out</b> to produce a finished product. Comparatively, these newer gongs have a higher pitch and are smaller in size than those made in older times.|$|E
5|$|On September 27, 1989, the Phillies {{faced the}} Mets {{in their home}} finale at Shea Stadium in New York after a disappointing Mets season. The Mets had won the East in 1988 but were in third place on September 26 behind the Chicago Cubs and St. Louis Cardinals. McDowell was closing out a 5–3 win for the Phillies when, with two outs in the ninth, he induced former {{teammate}} Gregg Jeffries to <b>ground</b> <b>out</b> to second to end the game. As Jeffries was running out the play, McDowell said something to him prompting Jeffries to charge the mound and wrestle McDowell to the ground. The benches cleared and punches were exchanged before the umpires could separate the teams. Jeffries later claimed that McDowell had thrown at him during a 2–1 Phillies victory on September 25.|$|E
2500|$|The Giants {{responded with}} two {{runs in the}} bottom of the inning. Brandon Crawford singled and Michael Morse doubled, scoring Crawford, and causing the Royals to replace Guthrie with Kelvin Herrera. [...] Herrera walked Gregor Blanco to put runners on first and second. After Joe Panik <b>grounded</b> <b>out</b> to advance the runners to second and third, Buster Posey then hit an RBI groundout scoring Morse and cutting the Giants' deficit to one. Pablo Sandoval then <b>grounded</b> <b>out</b> to Hosmer to end the inning.|$|R
5000|$|... 2nd batter, #23 Ellis Burks (the Giants' right fielder) <b>grounded</b> <b>out</b> 5-3 (3rd baseman to 1st baseman). In the process, Snow {{advanced}} to second base.|$|R
50|$|Elston Howard <b>grounded</b> <b>out</b> to Reese for {{the final}} out; the two shared the dubious record for playing in the most losing World Series (six each).|$|R
5|$|The Astros {{took their}} lead early, scoring {{in the top}} of the first inning. Terry Puhl led off the game {{reaching}} base on an error by the second baseman. Enos Cabell followed Puhl with a single and, while Joe Morgan batted, stole second base to put runners at second and third. Morgan struck out and José Cruz appeared to hit into a fielder's choice but a catching error by the catcher allowed Puhl to score, Cabell to advance to third base, and Cruz to reach safely all with no out recorded. Cabell then scored on a César Cedeño <b>ground</b> <b>out</b> to make the game 2–0. Art Howe singled to advance Cruz to third, but Dodgers' starting pitcher Dave Goltz escaped the inning without further scoring.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{scoreless}} {{through the first}} two innings. Detroit took a three-run lead {{in the third inning}} which started when Curtis Granderson walked, advanced on a <b>ground</b> <b>out,</b> and scored on a single by Magglio Ordóñez to center field. Ordóñez was then brought home via a two-run home run by Tigers' first baseman Miguel Cabrera. The Twins responded {{in the bottom of the}} inning, with Matt Tolbert singling to lead off the inning, advancing to second base on a single by Denard Span, and then moving to third on a flyball out. Tigers' starter Rick Porcello attempted a pickoff throw to first which hit the baserunner Span and went past the first baseman Cabrera. Span was out but Tolbert was able to score on Porcello's throwing error.|$|E
5|$|Originally, the Cardinals were {{wavering}} between starting Murry Dickson or Harry Brecheen in game two, {{while the}} Dodgers {{were looking to}} use either Higbe, who had pitched in the previous game, or Joe Hatten; the two clubs went with Dickson and Hatten. Hatten began {{the game in the}} top of the first inning by only allowing one hit to Terry Moore. In the bottom of the first, the Dodgers scored the game's first run. After Eddie Stanky struck out, and Dick Whitman flied out, Augie Galan singled. He was brought home by a walk and another single. After Carl Furillo flied out, the first inning ended with a score of 1–0. In the top of the second, the Cardinals responded when Erv Dusak tripled after a Slaughter <b>ground</b> <b>out.</b> Marty Marion hit a sacrifice fly to score Dusak, and after a single by Clyde Kluttz, Dickson tripled to score another run, giving St. Louis a 2–1 lead, before a fly out ended their half of the inning. Dickson walked Bruce Edwards, but retired the next three batters, leaving the score 2–1 at the end of the second inning.|$|E
50|$|He {{made his}} major league debut on April 9, 1962 for the Phillies in a 12-4 road {{win over the}} Cincinnati Reds at Crosley Field. Pinch-hitting for Wes Covington against Bob Miller, he <b>grounded</b> <b>out</b> but stayed in the game, playing left field. After <b>grounding</b> <b>out</b> again, {{in the seventh inning}} he notched his first major league hit and RBI with a single off pitcher Dave Hillman that drove in Tony Gonzalez. He later had another RBI single that scored Gonzalez again, off pitcher Jim Brosnan.|$|R
5|$|Branca {{began the}} game by {{retiring}} the first three batters; Eddie Stanky and Alvin Dark flied out while Don Mueller <b>grounded</b> <b>out.</b> In {{the bottom of the}} first, Carl Furillo <b>grounded</b> <b>out,</b> and Pee Wee Reese hit a single. After Duke Snider flied out, Reese was caught stealing second base to end the inning. In the second inning, Branca retired all three hitters; when the Dodgers came up to bat, Jackie Robinson flied out and Roy Campanella <b>grounded</b> <b>out.</b> Andy Pafko scored the game's first run with a home run to left field to make the score 1–0. After the third out, Willie Mays walked to start the third inning, and after the first out Stanky got the Giants' first hit, a single. After a fly out by Dark, the Giants remained without a run; Hearn retired all three batters {{in the bottom of the}} third to end the inning.|$|R

5|$|Prior to {{the start}} of the game, Derek Jeter and Albert Pujols were named winners of the Hank Aaron Award for their {{offensive}} performances in 2009. This was the first game to test manager Joe Girardi's decision to use a three-man starting rotation, as CC Sabathia started the game on three days rest, a shorter period than he normally got during the regular season. Jeter led the game off with a single and advanced to third base on a double by Johnny Damon. Jeter scored via a Mark Teixeira <b>ground</b> <b>out</b> and Alex Rodriguez was hit by a pitch. Rodriguez was hit twice the night before and the umpires issued warnings to both benches. Jorge Posada then added to the Yankees lead that inning with a sacrifice fly. The Phillies answered quickly, scoring a run on successive doubles by Shane Victorino and Chase Utley in the bottom of the first. Sabathia intentionally walked Jayson Werth, but escaped the inning without further scoring. The Phillies tied the game in the bottom of the fourth as Ryan Howard singled, stole second, and scored on a single by Pedro Feliz. Although the run counted, instant replay of Howard's slide later showed that he did not touch home plate.|$|E
5|$|Robertson {{held the}} Phillies {{scoreless}} {{for a second}} inning in the fourth. Jorge Posada entered as a pinch hitter in the fifth inning for José Molina and grounded out. Eric Hinske then pinch hit for Robertson and walked, advanced to third on a Derek Jeter single, and scored on a <b>ground</b> <b>out</b> by Damon. Alfredo Aceves entered as the new Yankee pitcher {{in the bottom of}} the fifth. The first batter he faced, Jayson Werth, hit a deep drive to center field but it was caught for an out by Gardner, who collided into the outfield wall to complete the play. Aceves completed the inning without a run scoring, inducing ground outs from Ibáñez and Ruiz. Phil Coke relieved Aceves in the seventh inning and allowed two Phillies players tie World Series records. First, Utley tied Reggie Jackson's record for most home runs in a World Series with a solo home run, his fifth of the series. Coke then struck out Howard, Howard's 12th strikeout in the series, tying Willie Wilson's record for most strikeouts in a World Series. Finally, Coke was driven from the game after allowing another solo home run, this time to Ibáñez, and was relieved by Phil Hughes.|$|E
5|$|The Yankees {{replaced}} Melky Cabrera {{on their}} postseason roster with Ramiro Peña {{due to his}} injury in Game4, while Brett Gardner took Cabrera's place in center field. A. J. Burnett, the Yankees' Game2 starter, started Game5 on three days rest, one less than the Phillies' Cliff Lee. The Yankees scored first in the first inning, with Johnny Damon reaching base with a single and then scoring on a two-out double by Alex Rodriguez. The Phillies responded {{in the bottom of}} the inning with a single by Jimmy Rollins, Shane Victorino reaching after being hit by a pitch, and finally a three-run home run by Chase Utley to take the lead. The Phillies added to their lead in the third inning with Utley and Ryan Howard drawing walks followed by RBI singles by Jayson Werth and Raúl Ibañez. With no outs in the inning, Burnett was relieved by David Robertson, who allowed another run to score on a Carlos Ruiz <b>ground</b> <b>out.</b>|$|E

50|$|Warren Spahn and the National League squad {{held off}} any more offense by the AL {{in the final}} inning, again giving {{them a chance to}} win it in their half of the ninth. Whitey Kurowski <b>grounded</b> <b>out</b> to Bobby Doerr at second and Pee Wee Reese walked to put the tying run on first. Eddie Stanky <b>grounded</b> <b>out</b> to Doerr also, {{preventing}} Reese from advancing. Schoolboy Rowe came to bat, pinch hitting for the pitcher Spahn. Rowe flew out to right fielder Tommy Henrich to give the American League a 2-1 victory.|$|R
50|$|In Royster's four MLB games played, he {{appeared}} as a late-inning defensive replacement and pinch hitter. In his four big-league at bats, he struck <b>out</b> twice and <b>grounded</b> <b>out</b> twice.|$|R
5|$|The Yankees scored {{first for}} the second {{straight}} game, but Utley gave the lead back to Philadelphia on a three-run home run. Werth and Ibáñez drove in Utley and Howard in the third inning, which chased the starter, Burnett. David Robertson allowed another run to score on a Carlos Ruiz groundout. Eric Hinske, who entered as a pinch-hitter, scored on a <b>ground</b> <b>out</b> by Johnny Damon. Utley tied Reggie Jackson's record for most home runs in a World Series with a solo home run in the seventh inning, his fifth of the series. Howard struck out for the 12th time in the series, tying Willie Wilson's 1980 record for most strikeouts in a World Series. Ibáñez hit a solo home run to chase pitcher Phil Coke. After being hit in the hand in the first inning, Victorino was replaced defensively in the eighth inning by Ben Francisco. Lee left the game after allowing two runs to score, and Park gave up a sacrifice fly to Robinson Canó to add another earned run to Lee's line. Ryan Madson entered in the ninth to close the game, allowing one run on a double play but earning his first career World Series save.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{lopsided}} from the start. In {{the top of}} the first inning, Shawkey gave up three runs on three hits, with the runs coming from a Jim Bottomley double and Les Bell single. Alexander encountered a minor setback in the fourth inning. To open up the bottom of the inning, Bob Meusel launched a triple into left field and scored on the following <b>ground</b> <b>out</b> by Lou Gehrig. Alexander shut down the Yankees {{for the rest of the}} inning, and the Cardinals held on to a 3–1 lead. In {{the top of the}} fifth inning, the Cardinals expanded their two-run lead. Tommy Thevenow hit a single to left fielder Babe Ruth. Alexander laid down a sacrifice bunt and was tagged out by first baseman Gehrig, but was successful in advancing Thevenow to second base. Wattie Holm, substituting for Taylor Douthit as center fielder, followed by hitting a single into center field, scoring Thevenow on the play. Billy Southworth and Rogers Hornsby followed with groundouts in the infield to end the inning.|$|E
5|$|The only run of {{the game}} scored when White Sox {{designated}} hitter Jim Thome led off {{the bottom of the}} seventh inning with a solo home run. Blackburn got Paul Konerko to <b>ground</b> <b>out,</b> but allowed a double to Griffey and, following an intentional walk to Alexei Ramírez, José Mijares relieved him. John Danks lasted through eight innings without allowing a run and was relieved by closer Bobby Jenks in the ninth. Jenks recorded three outs, securing the White Sox' 1–0 victory with his 30th save of the season. Twins batters Joe Mauer, Justin Morneau, and Cuddyer had a combined 22 hits in 40 at-bats (.550 batting average) against Danks for their careers but in the tie-breaker they combined to go 1–for-9 (.111) with 3 strikeouts. This game saw the lowest combined score of any tie-breaker game in MLB history, three runs lower than the 3–1 score of {{the first game of the}} 1951 National League tie-breaker series.|$|E
50|$|The Cubs did rally, however, in {{the ninth}} with three {{straight}} singles that made it 3-2. But Sandberg <b>grounded</b> <b>out</b> sending the Giants to their first World Series since 1962.|$|R
25|$|In {{the top of}} the 12th, Drake hit {{the first}} batter he faced, George Johnson. Warfield singled to right, {{advancing}} Johnson to third. After Currie struck out, Briggs singled to left, scoring Johnson, and advanced to second on the throw to the plate. After Stephens struck out, Carr singled and drove in McNair and Warfield. Mackey then struck out to retire the side, but Hilldale was ahead 5 to 2. In the bottom of the inning, Sweatt <b>grounded</b> <b>out</b> to the pitcher, Duncan flew out to left, and Foreman, pinch hitting for Drake, <b>grounded</b> <b>out</b> to second, ending the game.|$|R
50|$|In {{the bottom}} of the sixth, the Giants gave Kansas City some {{pitching}} hiccups of their own. Brandon Crawford scored from first base on a Michael Morse double. Kelvin Herrera was then summoned to replace starter Jeremy Guthrie. Again, as with López {{in the top of the}} inning, the presence of the new pitcher Herrera did not immediately stop the bleeding for Kansas City, as Morse advanced to third base and then scored on respective Joe Panik and Buster Posey <b>ground</b> <b>outs.</b> Herrera kept San Francisco to a two run inning as heavy hitting Pablo Sandoval <b>grounded</b> <b>out.</b>|$|R
5|$|Victorino was {{replaced}} defensively {{in the eighth}} inning by Ben Francisco. Lee was driven from the game after allowing a single to Damon, followed by a double by Mark Teixeira, and then a double by Rodriguez that scored both runners. Chan Ho Park relieved Lee and induced a <b>ground</b> <b>out</b> from Nick Swisher, which advanced Rodriguez to third base. Rodriguez scored on a sacrifice fly by Robinson Canó. Ryan Madson entered in the ninth to close the game, allowing a double to Posada and a single to Hideki Matsui without recording an out. Batting with men on first and third base, Jeter grounded into a double play, allowing Posada to score but emptying the bases. Damon singled to bring Teixeira to bat as the potential tying run, but Madson struck him out to record his first World Series save. Members of the news media, such as Gene Wojciechowski, were critical of the three-man starting rotation strategy following Game3, and contended that Burnett's poor performance was caused by insufficient rest in between starts. However, Burnett had been successful up to this point in such situations, going 4–0 with a 2.33 ERA in four career starts on short rest (less than the normal four days between starts) before this game.|$|E
5|$|Ron Perranoski {{entered as}} the new pitcher for the seventh, Camilli took his place {{as the new}} catcher, and Ron Fairly {{replaced}} Wally Moon at first base. Burright became the new second baseman, replacing Gilliam who moved to third base while the previous third baseman, Tommy Davis, moved to center field. Perranoski allowed singles to Orsino and Pagán after a <b>ground</b> <b>out</b> by Felipe Alou. The Giants pinch hit Harvey Kuenn for Matty Alou and Bob Nieman for Hiller, but both recorded outs to end {{the top of the}} seventh. Ernie Bowman replaced Nieman at second base for the Giants {{in the bottom of the}} inning and no runs scored in the frame. The Giants continued to hit Perranoski in the top of the eighth, with singles by Davenport and Mays to open the inning. Jack Smith entered in relief but allowed a single to Ed Bailey pinch hitting for Larsen which scored Davenport to cut the Dodgers' lead to 7–6. Mays attempted to advance to third on the play but was called out. The play drew arguments from Mays, Alvin Dark, and third base coach Whitey Lockman as third base umpire Jocko Conlan appeared to call Mays safe before changing it to out. Carl Boles pinch ran for Bailey, and Cepeda reached on an error on his fly ball which allowed Boles to move to third. Stan Williams relieved Smith and walked Felipe Alou to load the bases. Orsino hit a sacrifice fly to tie the game at seven runs apiece and Pagán grounded out to end the inning.|$|E
5|$|The Dodgers {{cut into}} {{the lead in the}} fourth, as Snider doubled to lead off, {{advanced}} to third on a Tommy Davis single, and scored on a groundout by Frank Howard. The Giants threatened against Podres {{in the top of the}} sixth with singles by Cepeda, Ed Bailey, and Jim Davenport on a bunt to load the bases. However, Ed Roebuck relieved Podres and escaped the inning without allowing a run. The Dodgers took a 3–2 lead in the bottom of the inning as Snider singled and scored on a home run by Tommy Davis. They extended this lead in the bottom of the seventh as Wills singled and then stole second as Jim Gilliam batted. Manager Alvin Dark had chosen not to try to hold Wills to the first base bag as Dark did not believe his Giants' defense could stop Wills from stealing regardless of their positioning. Gilliam was put out for the second out of the inning, but Wills stole third base and then scored on a throwing error by the catcher trying to catch him. This extended the Dodgers' lead to 4–2. The Dodgers further threatened in the bottom of the eighth. Don Larsen entered in relief of Marichal midway through Davis' at bat but Davis walked to lead off the inning regardless. Ron Fairly sacrificed him to second base and Davis then stole third as Howard struck out. However, Larsen intentionally walked both Roseboro and Willie Davis to load the bases and induced a <b>ground</b> <b>out</b> by Roebuck to end the inning.|$|E
