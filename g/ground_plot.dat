40|$|As {{interest}} in using Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) for forest inventory increases, {{the need for}} information comparing its cost effectiveness to conventional forest inventories is necessary. This project compared costs of a random sample ground inventory with a double sampling approach using LiDAR and fixed radius <b>ground</b> <b>plots.</b> The study examined the role of relative costs for each plot type (LiDAR and <b>ground</b> <b>plots)</b> and the similarity of plot level data (coefficient of determination) in the cost efficient mix of LiDAR and fixed radius <b>ground</b> <b>plots.</b> Because of {{the high cost of}} acquiring LiDAR data, a double sampling approach using LiDAR technology is currently not cost effective for determining timber volumes when compared to traditional ground methods. However, LiDAR inventories can provide additional benefits such as a Digital Elevation Model (DEM), wildlife habitat characteristics, and other applications that require vertical and horizontal vegetation densities. If LiDAR data are already in place, a LiDAR inventory can be performed using a double-sample inventory to reduce cruising costs and improve the accuracy of the cruise volumes, but data must be acquired with the same time frame.

50|$|Via an open wooden runway {{visitors}} {{first had}} to cross a side arm of the moat surrounding a barbican, semi-circle shaped in the Karlstor's case, {{that had to be}} entered through one narrow orifice near one of its corners and with its courtyard forming an outer, wider bailey. Then, passing the outlet at the barbicans backside, they would enter an open stone bridge that crossed a wide moat. The eventual main gates that would be reached {{at the end of the}} respective bridges all had a <b>ground</b> <b>plot</b> either rectangular or triangular, with two sturdy, lower front towers looking towards the bridge and barbican on the outside, the passage being in the center of the front wall, and a strong, taller main gate tower on the inside, oriented towards the town. Those respective three towers were interconnected with walls, thus creating another, small, inner bailey. The whole concept created narrow, winding paths following the given, special architectural conditions that improved defensive and checkpoint functions and gave the guards overall control over who and what was to leave or enter the town.|$|E
5000|$|Samuel Wetherill, Jr. {{refused to}} renounce his {{providing}} {{supplies to the}} Continental Army at Valley Forge, and was [...] "read out of meeting" [...] (disowned) by the Society of Friends in 1779. Free Quakers defied the pacifism of their religion, and supported or fought in the Revolutionary War. Wetherill became a founder of Philadelphia's Free Quaker Meeting (chartered February 20, 1781), and served as its clerk and preacher. With brother-in-law Timothy Matlack, another charter member, he designed its meeting house (1783-84), at 5th and Arch Streets. The meeting established its own burying ground, {{on the south side}} of 5th Street between Locust and Spruce Streets. Membership dwindled as the Free Quakers died off, and their meeting house was closed in 1836. As the turn of the 20th century approached, the Free Quaker Burying <b>Ground</b> <b>plot</b> became attractive for commercial development. It was in anticipation of its sale that Col. John Macomb Wetherill (Samuel Wetherill, Jr.'s great-grandson) directed in his 1895 will that the private cemetery at Fatland be expanded.|$|E
5000|$|Appalled by the abbey's condition, Alexander Beresford Hope MP (a devoted {{and wealthy}} layman) {{purchased}} the abbey’s ruins and <b>ground</b> <b>plot</b> in 1844. Inspired by Edward Coleridge's {{vision of a}} missionary college, the work of establishing the college soon commenced. Funds were raised with Hope as the principal donor {{along with many other}} contributors including Queen Victoria. [...] "New buildings arose, a new life seemed {{to come out of the}} old shadows that lay so long over and around the ruins." [...] Hope was determined to restore the ancient appearance as much as possible and, in accordance with Hope’s desires, “pains were taken to preserve as much as possible of the old work that seemed worth preserving.” The Great Gate was refurbished and the college library was built over the foundation of what had been the abbey’s refectory. Beneath the library, the remains of an abbey crypt were restored and used for teaching carpentry and other handicrafts needed when the missionary graduates ventured into primitive conditions. The dormitories comprised a range of new buildings designed to blend in with the old. The architect for the reconstruction was William Butterfield.|$|E
30|$|While {{this study}} made {{progress}} {{in terms of}} ecologically meaningful variable selection and highlighted model advantages and disadvantages, improvements may be realized in several aspects. First, we found that canopy cover {{as the percentage of}} the sky blocked by tree crowns over a hemispherical view (ĈĈ_HEMI) was a better predictor for AGB than canopy cover as the vertical projection of tree crowns onto the ground (ĈĈ_VERT). However, values of CCVERT, used to predict ĈĈ_VERT, were derived from DBH-crown radius models (Burrows and Strang 1964; Fuller et al. 1997; Isango 2007) that should be updated for conditions in Zambia (Halperin et al. 2016). Once updated, ĈĈ_VERT may prove to be as useful as ĈĈ_HEMI as a predictor of AGB. Second, the highest percent CV pixel values occurred where AGB was predicted to be the lowest, likely because there were very few <b>ground</b> <b>plots</b> with no trees. To accommodate such under-sampled areas, off-grid <b>ground</b> <b>plots</b> could be included along with the NFI <b>ground</b> <b>plots</b> in implementation of the model-based methods. Model-based methods are not restricted to one single sample design as long as the same variable of interest (i.e., AGB) is being sampled according to the same definitions; the main consideration is that sample selection is required to be uninformative in terms of Y (Gregoire 1998).|$|R
40|$|Abstract—A {{reduction}} in variance for estimates of forest area and volume {{in the state}} of Connecticut was accomplished by stratifying FIA <b>ground</b> <b>plots</b> using raw, transformed and classified Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery. A US Geological Survey (USGS) Multi-Resolution Landscape Characterization (MRLC) vegetation cover map for Connecticut was used to produce a forest/non-forest map derived from a classified 1993 TM image. A 1996 TM image was used to provide spectral reflectance variables for each pixel, including the values for all 6 raw TM bands and several transformed layers: normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and Tasseled Cap brightness, greenness, wetness, and “fourth. ” Each pixel in the map was assigned a value indicating how many surrounding pixels within a 3 X 3 or 5 X 5 window were forested. These same windows were used to calculate, for each pixel, a mean, maximum, minimum, and standard deviation of the raw and transformed layers. FIA <b>ground</b> <b>plots</b> (1996) were split into percent timberland classes using a “decision tree ” algorithm that recursively determines the most significant variable and the most significant split of that variable.

Lastly, we gathered GPS line data for roads and point data for village locations.

30|$|Before {{selecting}} pixels {{to match}} with ground plots for all predictor datasets, we masked out major rivers and paved roads by on-screen digitizing using Landsat data at 1 : 10, 000. All spatial data were clipped to the study area boundary. To account for spatial extent mismatches between <b>ground</b> <b>plot</b> size and predictor variables, we resampled all predictor variable spatial data to a 20  m[*]×[*] 50  m pixel size using a nearest neighbor method which maintained the actual pixel values. The values for each predictor variable were assigned to ground plots, based on proximity of the <b>ground</b> <b>plot</b> center to the nearest pixel center for each predictor variable. Preparation of spatial predictor variables was conducted using the R raster package v. 2.3 - 41 (Hijmans et al. 2015) and ArcGIS v. 10.1 (ESRI 2012).|$|E
30|$|Comparing EC flux-tower {{cumulative}} NEP (ΣNEP) {{and inventory}} <b>ground</b> <b>plot</b> measurements of C stock changes (ΔC) {{over the same}} period can help inform forest C processes for several reasons. First, <b>ground</b> <b>plot</b> measurements can serve as an independent validation of ΣNEP measurements made at EC flux-towers. Second, inventory plot data can provide more detailed information about the stand structural changes that may be driving variation stand-level EC C exchange. Third, broad stand inventory measurement datasets are available for a greater spatial extent than the global EC flux-tower network. For example, the Canadian National Forest Inventory (NFI) samples approximately 22, 000 photo plots locations across Canada with detailed ground plots measured at over 1000 locations (Gillis et al. 2005). However, comparing inventory plot changes and EC flux-tower measurements requires comparisons to be made across different spatial and temporal scales. Therefore, such comparisons pose methodological challenges beyond individual inventory plot and EC flux-tower measurements.|$|E

30|$|Research {{on the use}} {{of optical}} sensor {{satellite}} imagery for estimating AGB in the miombo ecoregion is more limited. Næsset et al. (2016) used a linear ordinary least squares model and a stepwise predictor variable selection method. As potential predictor variables, these authors included canopy cover predictions and canopy cover gain or loss from Hansen et al. (2013), raw band values from Landsat 7 ETM+ and Landsat 8 OLI, NDVI calculated from the Landsat data, and square and square root transformations for all of these predictor variables. Based on their stepwise predictor variable selection procedure, squared canopy cover was the only predictor variable chosen. While their finding helps to corroborate our result of canopy cover and squared canopy cover in the sigmoidal model, their model resulted in poor AGB prediction with an RMSPE% of 87  %. It is possible that their model using Landsat data was disadvantaged by two aspects. First, they did not include other commonly used vegetation indices (i.e., NDMI, NBR) or texture variables (i.e. standard deviation in a 3 [*]×[*] 3 window around the <b>ground</b> <b>plot),</b> which we found to be useful in our study, as have others (e.g., Lu et al. 2014).

One hundred five profiling flight lines totaling 9166 km were flown over the entire county; east-west. The lines, spaced 3 km apart north-south, duplicate the systematic pattern of the Norwegian Forest Inventory (NFI) <b>ground</b> <b>plot</b> arrangement, enabling the profiler to transit 1290 circular, 250 square meter fixed-area NFI ground plots while collecting the systematic LiDAR sample. Seven hundred sixty-three plots of the 1290 plots were overflown within 17. 8 m of plot center. Laser measurements of canopy height and crown density are extracted along fixed-length, 17. 8 m segments closest {{to the center of}} the <b>ground</b> <b>plot</b> and related to basal area, timber volume and above- and belowground dry biomass. Linear, nonstratified equations that estimate ground-measured total aboveground dry biomass report an R(sup 2) = 0. 63, with an regression RMSE = 35. 2 t/ha. Nonstratified model results for the other biomass components, volume, and basal area are similar, with R(sup 2) values for all models ranging from 0. 58 (belowground biomass, RMSE = 8. 6 t/ha) to 0. 63. Consistently, the most useful single profiling LiDAR variable is quadratic mean canopy height, h (sup bar) (sub qa). Two-variable models typically include h (sup bar) (sub qa) or mean canopy height, h(sup bar) (sub a), with a canopy density or a canopy height standard deviation measure.

The system dynamics cannot be recovered from the global or local controls alone. Ground forest inventory is able to accurately estimate forest carbon stocks at sample plots, but these sample plots are too sparse to support the spatial simulation of carbon stocks with required accuracy. Satellite observation is an important source of global information for the simulation of carbon stocks. Satellite remote-sensing can supply spatially continuous information about the surface of forest carbon stocks, which is impossible from ground-based investigations, but their description has considerable uncertainty.
