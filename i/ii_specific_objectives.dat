40|$|The task of WP 6 is to {{evaluate}} the CONNECT technologies under realistic situations. To achieve this goal, WP 6 concentrated its 3 rd year effort {{on the development of}} a main scenario in the context of GMES, which requires the connection of highly heterogeneous and independently built systems provided by the industry partners. The resulting scenario allows the consortium to assess the validity of CONNECT claims and to investigate the exploitation of CONNECT technologies {{in the context of the}} integration of real systems. Another objective of this report is to provide a first assessment of CONNECT solutions against the project's objectives stated in the DoW. The proposed assessment spans: (i) the project's overall objective of enabling on-the-fly interoperability among heterogeneous networked systems as well as (<b>ii)</b> the project's <b>specific</b> <b>objectives</b> related to the foundations and associated enablers to be elaborated for learning and reasoning about the interaction behaviours of networked systems and for synthesizing mediators so as to make systems interoperate...|$|R
40|$|The overall {{objective}} of this ERIP program was to make substantial progress in further developing a process for electrolytic regeneration of acid cupric chloride etchant - a process which was initially demonstrated in in-house studies and EPA Phase I and Phase <b>II</b> SBIRs. <b>Specific</b> <b>objectives</b> of the work were: (1) to define optimum system operating conditions by conducting a systematic study of process parameters, (2) to develop or find a superior electrolyic cell separator material, (3) to determine an optimum activation procedure for the flow-through carbon/graphite felt electrodes which are so critical to process performance, (4) to demonstrate - on the pre-prototype scale - electrolytic compensation for oxygen ingress - which causes etchant solution growth, and (5) to begin engineering design work on a prototype-scale regeneration unit. Parametric studies looked at the effect that key plating parameters have on copper deposit quality. Parameters tested included (a) velocity past the plating cathodes, (b) copper concentration in the catholyte solution from which the copper is being plated, (c) plating current density, and (d) catholyte cupric ion concentration. The most significant effects were obtained for velocity changes. The work showed that catholyte velocities above 0. 5 ft/sec were needed to get adequate plating at 77. 5 mA/cm{sup 2 } and higher currents, and that even higher flow was better...|$|R
30|$|With {{the results}} {{obtained}} from this research, we attained our general objective to advance the understanding of how software startups and their ecosystems function. We presented a conceptual framework that depicts software startup ecosystems, their agents, and the relationships among them, accomplishing the <b>specific</b> <b>objective</b> 1. We iteratively evolved this framework until reaching a final version that fitted well in all three analyzed ecosystems (<b>specific</b> <b>objective</b> 2). We created a maturity model to map ecosystem evolution, achieving the <b>specific</b> <b>objective</b> 4. Stakeholders from any existing ecosystem can use the proposed model to evaluate its maturity and also compare to others (<b>specific</b> <b>objective</b> 4).|$|R
