5|$|When Antoine was alive, many {{observers}} {{thought that the}} healings he obtained resulted to suggestion only, and Dr. Schuind, who wrote two articles in The Meuse (La Meuse) on the subject at the time, criticized the lack of control and vague diagnostics surrounding these healings. Sociologist Anne-Cécile Bégot considered the Antoinist healing of the first decades a form of protest against (1) the efficiency of medicine, (2) the traditional representation of disease—the real healing can be attained only through {{a new approach to}} the disease, which is never considered a particular misfortune and thus is not reduced to its biological dimension—and (3) the management of disease—sick are always responsible for their own illness. However, she concluded that this protest has evolved throughout time as (1) the disease is now represented on an endogenous etiological model, which indicates a process of individualization of the religion, and (2) the personal real-life experience is more presented as the cause of the disease than the relation to the <b>global</b> <b>society.</b>|$|E

25|$|According to {{theories}} of postmodernity, economic and technological conditions {{of our age}} {{have given rise to}} a decentralized, media-dominated society in which ideas are only simulacra, inter-referential representations and copies of each other with no real, original, stable or objective source of communication and meaning. Globalization, brought on by innovations in communication, manufacturing and transportation, is often cited as one force which has driven the decentralized modern life, creating a culturally pluralistic and interconnected <b>global</b> <b>society</b> lacking any single dominant center of political power, communication or intellectual production. The postmodernist view is that inter-subjective, not objective, knowledge will be the dominant form of discourse under such conditions and that ubiquity of dissemination fundamentally alters the relationship between reader and that which is read, between observer and the observed, between those who consume and those who produce.|$|E

All other student organizations have the opportunity to spend up to $350 per year on programs from the Student Life budget. The budgets for student organizations are awarded by the Student Activities and Budget Advisory Committee (SABAC), which is a majority student, faculty, and staff run advisory committee to the vice president of students.

While concluding that this is only very partially the case, the final section will suggest that the tortured democracy question is not the only justification for <b>global</b> civil <b>society</b> involvement in international fora. It will discuss the much overlooked and by no means unproblematic 'ethical contribution' of <b>global</b> civil <b>society</b> and offer a qualified defence of more international law, with more <b>global</b> civil <b>society</b> participation, on this basis...|$|R
40|$|Technological advancements in the West {{since the}} last {{millennium}} have contributed to global modernity. Technologies set conditions for {{the closeness of the}} nation-states and for the affinity of the global and the local.

Yet, arguing the new technologies bring a new life and a promising future to <b>global</b> <b>societies</b> remains a questionable thesis. This book attempts to explore the relationship between new technologies and <b>global</b> <b>societies,</b> to gain an understanding of how the positive as well as negative influences of technologies bear on <b>global</b> <b>societies,</b> how their practices of use are resisted or re-interpreted by these societies, and how their social meaning is constituted through the process of negotiation with these societies.

40|$|Many scholars, {{policy-makers}} {{and especially}} activists {{have begun to}} use the term 'global civil society', but despite the great significance that is now attributed to this concept by policy-makers and practitioners alike, it remains highly contested and under-researched. The <b>Global</b> Civil <b>Society</b> Yearbook is envisaged as a landmark publication, which will discuss and clarify the concept of a 'global civil society'. The Yearbook will contribute to the debate about what <b>global</b> civil <b>society</b> is, map and measure it, and examine each year how it is doing. The conceptual chapters, comprehensive case studies and comparative empirical data make this an essential volume for researchers in a number of disciplines, including economics, political science, anthropology and sociology, international law and international relations. Beyond its academic value and impact, however, the Yearbook aspires to make a contribution to <b>global</b> civil <b>society</b> itself. It can give a voice to civil society in the process of globalisation, helping to humanise and democratise this process. It can be a tool for participants in <b>global</b> civil <b>society</b> by shedding light on their strengths and weaknesses, and an aid in agenda-setting. <b>Global</b> Civil <b>Society</b> 2001 provides a genealogy of the concept of civil society, an overview of the growth of <b>global</b> civil <b>society</b> since 1989, and an analysis of current trends.

Further chapters are devoted to the resourcing of <b>global</b> civil <b>society,</b> the relationship between <b>global</b> civil <b>society</b> and information and communications technology, and the phenomenon of parallel NGO forums to international summits.

In the opening general part, special attention is given to problems caused by corporate strategies in production in developing countries.

The agencies of a <b>global</b> civil <b>society</b> have been playing a very important role in these processes.
