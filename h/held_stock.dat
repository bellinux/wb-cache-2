25|$|Beginning {{with the}} {{introduction}} of the original iPhone, iTunes can activate an iPhone through their mobile carrier. The original plan for the iPhone 3G was to have the carrier authenticate it at the point of sale, either through iTunes or through the carrier's own activation interface. However, a worldwide crash of iTunes' authentication servers on July 11, 2008, the day that the iPhone 3G was released, caused major issues. In some cases, AT and Apple Store employees told iPhone buyers to attempt to activate it at home. Also affected were original iPhone users attempting to upgrade to the 2.0 firmware. UK Apple, O2 and Carphone Warehouse stores were further impacted, as carrier O2's contract processing servers (known as Gateway) could not handle the number of new contracts and upgrades happening on launch day. Some stores reverted to hand written contracts, while others <b>held</b> <b>stock.</b> With the launch of the iPhone 3GS on June 19, 2009, iTunes at home activation was available for people purchasing their iPhone from AT Mobility and Apple. This allowed them to activate their new iPhone 3G/iPhone 3GS at home when they arrived.|$|E
500|$|On May 13, 1981, the Casino Control Commission {{found that}} Frank Gerace, {{president}} of Local 54, and Frank Materio, the local's grievance manager, {{were associated with}} organized crime. The commission also ruled that Karlos LaSane, the union's business agent, was ineligible to be a union officer or agent because he had previously been convicted of extortion. The commission also found that union officers refused to cooperate with Casino Control Commission investigators, and <b>held</b> <b>stock</b> in Resorts International, Inc. (which owned one of the casinos in which Local 54 represented workers). Both actions contravened state regulations. The commission feared that Local 54 was being influenced by Nicodemo [...] "Little Nicky" [...] Scarfo, a reputed leader of the Scarfo organized crime [...] "family" [...] based in Philadelphia.|$|E
500|$|Hornsby had an off-year offensively in 1926, as he hit only [...]317 with 11home runs. Nonetheless, St. Louis won {{its first}} NL pennant. In the 1926 World Series, the Cardinals {{defeated}} the Yankees in a seven-game series; Hornsby tagged out Babe Ruth on a stolen base attempt, ending the Series and giving St. Louis its first undisputed world championship. During post-season negotiations {{for a new}} contract, Hornsby demanded $50,000 per year for three years. Breadon agreed to a one-year contract for $50,000 ($ today). When Hornsby refused to give way, the Cardinals traded him to the New York Giants for Frankie Frisch and Jimmy Ring on December20, 1926. The trade was briefly postponed as NL president John Heydler stated that Hornsby could not play for the Giants while he <b>held</b> <b>stock</b> in the Cardinals. Hornsby wanted $105 per share for his stock, a price Breadon was unwilling to pay. In early 1927, Hornsby was able to sell his shares at $105 each, enabling him to officially become a Giant.|$|E

2500|$|By 1890, Standard Oil {{controlled}} 88 {{percent of}} the refined oil flows in the United States. The state of Ohio successfully sued Standard, compelling {{the dissolution of the}} trust in 1892. But Standard simply separated Standard Oil of Ohio and kept control of it. Eventually, the state of New Jersey changed its incorporation laws to allow a company to hold shares in other companies in any state. So, in 1899, the Standard Oil Trust, based at 26 Broadway in New York, was legally reborn as a holding company, the Standard Oil Co. of New Jersey (SOCNJ), which <b>held</b> <b>stock</b> in 41 other companies, which controlled other companies, which in turn controlled yet other companies. According to Daniel Yergin in his Pulitzer Prize-winning [...] (1990), this conglomerate was seen by the public as all-pervasive, controlled by a select group of directors, and completely unaccountable.|$|E
2500|$|On September 17, 1894, Koyle {{and five}} of his friends started {{excavating}} the place on the mountain which {{he had seen in}} his dream. The mine is located east of Salem on the Wasatch Mountains at the base of what is now called Knob Hill. It was incorporated on March 4, 1909, and 114,000 shares of stock were issued. About 42,000 shares with a par value of $1 were sold to the public for $1.50 per share. [...] Some early LDS Church leaders <b>held</b> <b>stock</b> in the Dream Mine, such as J. Golden Kimball and Matthew Cowley, as did Carter E. Grant, a nephew of Heber J. Grant. [...] In 1910, Koyle was appointed bishop of the Leland ward. By the end of 1913, the mine descended , and a pump was installed to stop it from flooding.|$|E
2500|$|As Mother Jones noted, {{many of the}} {{children}} at union headquarters were missing fingers and had other disabilities, and she attempted to get newspaper publicity for the bad conditions experienced by children working in Pennsylvania. However, the mill owners <b>held</b> <b>stock</b> in essentially all of the newspapers. When the newspaper men informed her that they could not publish the facts about child labor because of this, she remarked [...] "Well, I've got stock in these little children and I'll arrange a little publicity." [...] Permission to see President Roosevelt was denied by his secretary, and it was suggested that Jones address a letter to the president requesting a visit with him. Even though Mother Jones wrote a letter asking for a meeting, she never received an answer. Though the president refused to meet with the marchers, the incident brought the issue of child labor to the forefront of the public agenda. The 2003 non-fiction book Kids on Strike! described Jones's Children's Crusade in detail.|$|E

50|$|Chong, Phillips and Phillips {{state that}} African Americans, Hispanics, and Asians invest less heavily in stocks than White Americans. Hispanics {{and in some}} ways African Americans {{accumulate}} wealth slower than White Americans because of preference for near-term saving, favoring liquidity and low investment risk at the expense of higher yielding assets. These preferences may be due to low financial literacy leading to a lack of demand for investment services. According to Lusardi, even though the stock market increased in value in the 1990s, only 6-7% of African Americans and Hispanics <b>held</b> <b>stocks,</b> so they did not benefit as much from the value increase.|$|R
40|$|Peer {{performance}} {{can influence the}} adoption of financial innovations and investment styles. We present empirical evidence {{of this type of}} social influence: recent stock market returns that local peers experience strongly influence an individual's stock market entry decision. This effect is limited to positive returns that encourage entry, whereas negative returns do not make entry less likely. Market returns, media coverage, returns on locally <b>held</b> <b>stocks,</b> omitted local variables, and stock purchases within households do not drive our results. This type of social influence may partly explain, among other things, why participation rates tend to sharply increase in times of high market returns...|$|R
