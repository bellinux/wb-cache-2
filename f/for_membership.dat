The groups had similar aims, were active at about the same time, and had several members in common. Other notable members of the Kentucky Society for the Promotion of Useful Knowledge included Isaac Shelby, Christopher Greenup, and Thomas Todd, all future Kentucky governors or gubernatorial candidates.|$|E

5|$|In addition, Bo placed second-last in the {{confirmation}} vote <b>for</b> <b>membership</b> in the 15th Central Committee. As he {{placed in the}} bottom 5% of candidates, Bo was denied entry into the elite council, suffering a major political embarrassment.
