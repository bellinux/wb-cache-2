30|$|Pacu juveniles (n[*]=[*] 72) (110.5 [*]±[*] 25.9  g and 17.2 [*]±[*] 1.5  cm) were {{randomly}} distributed in 12 <b>holding</b> <b>tanks</b> (<b>volume</b> 1000 L, 20 fish per tank), within a recirculation aquaculture system. A completely randomized experimental design was set with four treatments and three replicates (n[*]=[*] 12). The control group was not submitted to any stress. Bath group without anesthetic and bath groups with anesthetic (20 or 70  mg L− 1 {{of the essential}} oil) were submitted to handling, characterized by the transference of fish from the respective <b>holding</b> <b>tank</b> to 20 L buckets. After this, fish were returned to the respective <b>holding</b> <b>tank.</b> The concentrations (20 and 70  mg L− 1) were determined based on the previous experiment. Baths took 10  min. Blood samplings were done in three different fish per replicate (n[*]=[*] 3) at time zero and 24  h after the anesthetic baths. Exposure for 10  min usually exceeded the induction time for individual fish, {{because of the fact}} that handling procedures often involve anesthesia of a large number of fish. The parameters of water quality were kept within the ideal conditions for the species.|$|R
30|$|After spawning, {{the eggs}} were transported from Gingin to the Curtin Aquaculture Research Laboratory (CARL) for {{incubation}} {{and for the}} production of the fry used in the experiment. On arrival, about 5000 eggs were placed into two 200 -L, conical-shaped, fiberglass incubator tanks filled with freshwater, with a flow-through system that had a flow rate of 500  mL/min. With this system, egg shells were retained in the incubation tank while larvae from the two incubation tanks were moved into the sump tank. Larvae from the sump tank were then transferred to the <b>holding</b> <b>tank</b> (200 L <b>volume)</b> at a stocking density of 50 larvae/L. The <b>holding</b> <b>tank</b> was filled with 6 ppt saline water and gently aerated. The water temperature in the <b>holding</b> <b>tank</b> was preserved at 20  ±  0.5  °C by a thermostatically controlled heater (Sonpar, Model-Ha 200). The newly hatched larvae were then haphazardly taken to perform morphometric measurements, age at first feeding, and mortality experiments. The rest of the larvae were kept unfed in this tank {{until the end of the}} experiment. The swimming behaviour of the larvae was observed simultaneously to identify the initial time of starvation characterized by a slow-moving swimming, hanging the head down into the water column, or almost no reaction to gentle probing.|$|R

Improperly maintained <b>holding</b> <b>tanks</b> are often underestimated {{source of contamination}} of soil, groundwater and surface water. As a rule, wastewater stored in <b>holding</b> <b>tanks,</b> should be transported and treated in municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs).
