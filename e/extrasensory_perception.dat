5|$|Under Elijah's influence, David {{develops}} what {{he thought}} was an unusual insight into human behavior into an <b>extrasensory</b> <b>perception</b> that enables him to glimpse criminal acts committed by the people who make contact with him. At Elijah's suggestion, David {{stands in the middle of}} a crowd in Philadelphia's 30th Street Station. As various people bump into him, he senses the crimes they perpetrated, such as theft and rape, and finds one he can act on: a sadistic janitor who invades a family home, kills the father, and holds the wife and their two children captive.|$|E
5|$|In 1500, {{inspired}} by Palkuriki Somanatha (a bilingual poet in Kannada and Telugu), Singiraja synthesised an account {{on the life}} of Basavanna titled Maha Basavaraja Charitra (or Singiraja Purana), using the protagonist's vachana poems and giving details of his 88famous deeds, as well as information about his opponents in the court of Southern Kalachuri King BijjalaII. An eminent poet of this time was Guru Basava, known for his authorship of seven famous poems (Sapta Kavya), all but one being written in the shatpadi metre. He expounded on religious teachings in the form of formal discussions between the guru and disciple. His kavyas (classical epic poems) deal with spiritualism and <b>extrasensory</b> <b>perception.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Based on the {{premises}} of non-materialistic explanations of the mind, some have suggested {{the existence of a}} cosmic consciousness, asserting that consciousness is actually the [...] "ground of all being". Proponents of this view cite accounts of paranormal phenomena, primarily <b>extrasensory</b> <b>perceptions</b> and psychic powers, as evidence for an incorporeal higher consciousness. In hopes of proving the existence of these phenomena, parapsychologists have orchestrated various experiments, but successful results might be due to poor experimental controls and might have alternative explanations.|$|R
50|$|The Possessor gains vast superhuman powers through {{manipulation}} of cosmic energy, including superhuman strength, durability, and genius intelligence. The Possessor {{has the ability}} to manipulate cosmic energy for a variety of effects, including the projection of concussive force blasts and increasing his size and mass (and hence physical strength). The Possessor does not age and is virtually immortal. He also has telepathic abilities that enable him to make limited contact with the minds of other Elders, and although he is totally blind he had unrevealed <b>extrasensory</b> <b>perceptions</b> which take the place of his sight.|$|R
5000|$|Mercy has {{a myriad}} of {{different}} powers. She can fly/levitate, turn intangible and invisible, or teleport to another area with a thought. She is able to project energy spears, which can inflict damage or drain power. She can shift into different shapes, including a large amorphous lump, which can suffocate a victim, or perfectly mimic the form and personality of another person. In a flashback from the Hulk: Destruction mini-series based upon the game of the same name, she turned into a giant super-strong monster, based upon the [...] "Devil Hulk". When her physical form was destroyed by an exploding tanker, she immediately reformed in another location. She can read minds, communicate through telepathy and perform astral projection, and possesses additional <b>extrasensory</b> <b>perceptions</b> enabling her to sense cosmic events of great importance.|$|R
5|$|When the Griffin family {{decide to}} go for a hike in the local woods, Chris and Stewie get lost while chasing after a {{floating}} butterfly. As a result, they go missing for several days, with only limited supplies. As Lois is at her wits' end, she decides to see a psychic medium who assures her of the children's safety and well being. Eventually the boys are found and rescued by Bruce, and returned to their home in Quahog which only furthers Lois's psychic obsession to the annoyance of a skeptical Brian. In defiance of Lois's assertion that <b>extrasensory</b> <b>perception</b> exists, Brian has Peter perform a cold reading on a passerby in the park in order to demonstrate that psychic readings are purely an act, and not real. However, Peter is struck by his success as a medium, convincing himself that he actually has <b>extrasensory</b> <b>perception,</b> and decides to capitalize on it by opening his own psychic readings business and performing in front of a live audience. Soon after, Peter's bluff is finally called when Joe requests his help in a frantic search for a missing person who has been strapped to a bomb. Peter stalls for time during the search (as he just wants to feel the victim's daughter's breasts), eventually resulting in a gruesome death when the bomb explodes, prompting Peter to flatly admit that he actually has no psychic powers whatsoever.|$|E
5|$|Following The Red Sea Sharks (1958) and {{its large}} number of characters, Tintin in Tibet differs from other stories in the series in that it {{features}} only a few familiar characters and is also Hergé's only adventure not to pit Tintin against an antagonist. Themes in Hergé's story include <b>extrasensory</b> <b>perception,</b> the mysticism of Tibetan Buddhism, and friendship. Tintin in Tibet has been translated into 32 languages, is highly regarded by critics, and has been praised by the Dalai Lama, who awarded it the Light of Truth Award. The story was a commercial success and was published in book form by Casterman shortly after its conclusion; the series itself became a defining part of the Franco-Belgian comics tradition. Tintin in Tibet was adapted for television, radio, documentary, theatre, and a video game, and {{has been the subject}} of a museum exhibition.|$|E
5|$|To {{learn about}} the Yeti, which he {{depicted}} as a benevolent creature, Hergé contacted his friend Bernard Heuvelmans, the author of On the Trail of Unknown Animals. After re-reading Heuvelmans' description of the Yeti, Hergé went on to research the cryptid species as much as possible. Hergé interviewed mountaineers, including Herzog, who had spotted the tracks of what he believed was an enormous biped that stopped {{at the foot of}} a rock face on Annapurna. The creature's care for the starving Chang derives from a Sherpa account of a Yeti that rescued a little girl in similar circumstances. Another influence came from Fanny Vlaminck, who was interested in <b>extrasensory</b> <b>perception</b> and the mysticism of Tibetan Buddhism, prominent themes in the story that also fascinated Hergé.|$|E
5000|$|A lengthy {{account of}} an {{encounter}} with the Sarmouni is given in Among the Dervishes (1973) by Omar Michael Burke, an associate of (or pen name of [...] ) Idries Shah. He takes the term [...] "Sarmouni" [...] to be synonymous with the Amudaria dervishes. He describes the Sarmouni as a diffuse set of groups, rather than being located in a single monastery. Some groups have no permanent headquarters and meet in the open or private houses. In some cases, whole villages blend Sarmouni practices with their day-to-day lives. He describes them as having a practical orientation, and avoiding mystification and personality-cults. They occasionally display <b>extrasensory</b> <b>perceptions,</b> but do not attribute great significance to them. He reports meeting a nonagenarian with memories of [...] "Jurjizada" [...] (Gurdjieff). He also says they owe their allegiance to the [...] "Studious King" [...] (a literal translation of Idries Shah's name), and agrees with Major Martin that their teaching has been exported and adapted to the West. (He mentions the Azimiyya, a modern international Sufi order).|$|R
5000|$|The word visionary {{indicates}} {{an ability to}} perceive beyond the normal purview. Growth in consciousness implies transcending the five senses when assigning validity to an extrasensory experience. Monty Joynes states, [...] "The work is also ‘visionary’ in the aspect that the authors sometimes (or often) employ non-rational means such as dreams or <b>extrasensory</b> <b>perceptions</b> to develop {{the content of the}} book." [...] Michael Gurian is more emphatic about the inclusion of this element, stating that in VF such extraordinary phenomena [...] "not only happen, but drive the plot and its characters (i.e. without these experiences, there would be no plot or character)." [...] The VF Alliance maintains that VF [...] "oftentimes uses reincarnation, dreams, visions, paranormal, psychic abilities, and other metaphysical plot devices."In his article [...] "Visionary Fiction: Rediscovering Ancient Paths to Truth," [...] Hal Zina Bennett addresses the use of paranormal elements in VF more mythically:"Like a shaman’s stories of the spirit world, where the spirits of animals, trees, sky, or the stars teach us how to live, visionary fiction introduces us to a reality beyond physical reality. They often carry us deep into a consciousness once thought to be the domain of seers, visionaries, oracles and psychics. The magic of this genre is the magic of human consciousness itself, our ability to see beneath the surface and create new visions of what our lives can be."The use of a paranormal element does not make fiction automatically visionary. A detective story with a mentalist as the crime solver might only be considered visionary if it demonstrates how the psychic's gift produces a higher state of consciousness.|$|R

5|$|At the house, the Doctor is {{surprised}} by Caecilius's daughter Evelina, {{who seems to}} have <b>extrasensory</b> <b>perception</b> (ESP) and knows personal details about the Doctor and Donna. They are interrupted by the local augur, Lucius Petrus Dextrus, who has arrived to collect a sculpture he commissioned. The Doctor is intrigued by the sculpture, which resembles a segment of an oversized circuit board. Lucius Petrus reveals that he also has powerful ESP and calls out the name of the Doctor's home planet, Gallifrey. The Doctor wishes {{to learn more about the}} sculptures and enlists Caecilius's son Quintus to help him break into Lucius Petrus' house. Inside, the Doctor deduces that the circuits will make an energy converter, but he is caught by Lucius Petrus. The two escape, but Lucius Petrus beckons a large stone creature to attack and kill them. The stone creature appears in Caecilius's house and attacks them, but Quintus saves them by dousing the creature in water and killing it. In the confusion, the Sisterhood kidnap Donna, and the Doctor sets off to rescue her. He meets the high priestess of the Sisterhood, who is revealed to be transforming into a stone creature. The Doctor discovers that they are being controlled by the Pyroviles, volcanic creatures whose home planet of Pyrovilia was lost. The Doctor is attacked by the Sisterhood, but he escapes with Donna into an underground tunnel that leads into the heart of Mount Vesuvius.|$|E

25|$|Experimental {{investigation}} of the paranormal has been conducted by parapsychologists. J. B.

25|$|Within {{the field}} of parapsychology, telepathy is {{considered}} to be a form of <b>extrasensory</b> <b>perception</b> (ESP) or anomalous cognition in which information is transferred through Psi.

Among the most well known are the use of Zener cards and the Ganzfeld experiment.|$|E
25|$|<b>Extrasensory</b> <b>perception,</b> ESP or Esper, {{also called}} sixth sense or second sight, {{includes}} claimed reception of information not gained through the recognized physical senses but sensed with the mind.

25|$|Hawking {{attended}} Radlett School, {{an independent}} {{school in the}} village of Radlett in Hertfordshire, for a year, and from September 1952, St Albans School, an independent school in the city of St Albans in Hertfordshire. The family placed a high value on education. Hawking's father wanted his son to attend the well-regarded Westminster School, but the 13-year-old Hawking was ill {{on the day of the}} scholarship examination. His family could not afford the school fees without the financial aid of a scholarship, so Hawking remained at St Albans. A positive consequence was that Hawking remained with a close group of friends with whom he enjoyed board games, the manufacture of fireworks, model aeroplanes and boats, and long discussions about Christianity and <b>extrasensory</b> <b>perception.</b> From 1958 on, with the help of the mathematics teacher Dikran Tahta, they built a computer from clock parts, an old telephone switchboard and other recycled components.|$|E

[...] "Good Vibrations" [...] was envisioned for the unfinished album Smile, but instead appeared on the 1967 substitute LP Smiley Smile. Most of the song was developed as it was recorded. Its title derived from Wilson's fascination with cosmic vibrations, after his mother once told him as a child that dogs sometimes bark at people in response to their [...] "bad vibrations". He used the concept to suggest <b>extrasensory</b> <b>perception,</b> while Love's lyrics were inspired by the Flower Power movement that was then burgeoning in Southern California.|$|E

I learned how to function behind drugs, and it improved my brain ... it made me more rooted in my sanity." [...] In Steven Gaines's 1986 biography, Wilson is quoted on the lyrics: [...] "We talked about good vibrations with the song and the idea, and we decided on one hand that you could say ... those are sensual things. And then you'd say, 'I'm picking up good vibrations,' which is a contrast against the sensual, the <b>extrasensory</b> <b>perception</b> that we have. That's what we're really talking about." [...] Brian claimed in 2012 that the song's [...] "gotta keep those good vibrations" [...] bridge was inspired by Stephen Foster. Al Jardine of the Beach Boys compared the section to Foster's [...] "Down by the Riverside".
