40|$|Abstract—The {{application}} of wavelet transforms to Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery has improved <b>despeckling</b> performance. <b>To</b> deduce {{the problem of}} filtering the multiplicative noise {{to the case of}} an additive noise, the wavelet decomposition is performed on the logarithm of the image gray levels.

An initial threshold value is estimated according to the noise variance. In this paper, an additional fuzzy thresholding approach for automatic determination of the rate threshold level around the traditional wavelet noise thresholding (initial threshold) is applied, and used for the soft or hard-threshold performed on all the high frequency subimages. The filtered logarithmic image is then obtained by reconstruction from the thresholded coefficients. This process is applied a single time, and exclusively to the first level of decomposition. The exponential function of this reconstructed image gives the final filtered image.

40|$|AbstractIn {{synthetic}} aperture radar (SAR) imaging, pulses of microwave energy are transmitted towards the ground surface (target). The backscattered signal energy is measured at the receiving end. In this process, a speckle noise is added because of the coherent imaging system and makes the study of images very difficult. For better SAR image processing, the speckle has to be removed {{in the initial stages}} of processing and maintain all texture features efficiently. The (Block Matching 3 D algorithm) BM 3 D method is generally considered as state of art method in denoising of SAR images. Still some amount of speckle left with images. This is due to sampling conversion at transmitter and receiver. In this paper, it is proposed a technique <b>to</b> <b>despeckle</b> the speckle noise to the maximum extent while maintaining the edge characteristics.

The image quality in ultrasound images is degraded by a special type of acoustic noise known as speckle. Speckle noise is a random presence of bright and dark spots which hinders human interpretation of images and computer assisted diagnostic techniques. The success of ultrasonic examination depends upon image quality; therefore, <b>despeckling</b> is necessary <b>to</b> improve visual quality for better diagnosis. Several speckle reduction methods are applied to the ultrasound images to suppress noise and preserve the useful diagnostic information.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} ability of the Information Theoretic Snow Detection Algorithm (ITSDA) in {{detecting}} changes due to snow cover between summer and winter seasons on large area images acquired by COSMO-SkyMed constellation. ITSDA is a method for change detection in multitemporal SAR images, which has been recently applied by the authors to a subset of Cosmo-SkyMed data. The proposed technique is based on a nonparametric approach in the framework of Shannon's information theory, and in particular it features the conditional probability of the local means between the two images taken at different times. Such an unsupervised approach does not require any preliminary <b>despeckling</b> procedure <b>to</b> be performed before the calculation of the change map. In the case of a low quantity of anomalous changes in relatively small-size images, a mean shift procedure can be utilized for refining the map. However, in the present investigation, the changes to be identified are pervasive in large size images. Consequently, for computational issues, the mean shift refinement has been omitted in the present work. However, a simplified implementation of mean shift procedure to save time will be possibly considered in future submissions. In any case, the present version of ITSDA method preserve its characteristics of flexibility and sensibility to backscattering changes, thanks to the possibility of setting up the number of quantization levels in the estimation of the conditional probability between the amplitude values at the two acquisition dates...|$|R

40|$|Speckle is a {{granular}} disturbance, usually modeled as a multiplicative noise, {{that affects}} {{synthetic aperture radar}} (SAR) images, {{as well as all}} coherent images. Over the last three decades, several methods have been proposed for the reduction of speckle, or despeckling, in SAR images. Goal of this paper is making a comprehensive review of despeckling methods since their birth, over thirty years ago, highlighting trends and changing approaches over years. The concept of fully developed speckle is explained. Drawbacks of homomorphic filtering are pointed out. Assets of multiresolution <b>despeckling,</b> as opposite <b>to</b> spatial-domain <b>despeckling,</b> are highlighted. Also advantages of undecimated, or stationary, wavelet transforms over decimated ones are discussed. Bayesian estimators and probability density function (pdf) models in both spatial and multiresolution domains are reviewed. Scale-space varying pdf models, as opposite to scale varying models, are promoted. Promising methods following non-Bayesian approaches, like nonlocal (NL) filtering and total variation (TV) regularization, are reviewed and compared to spatial- and wavelet-domain Bayesian filters. Both established and new trends for assessment of despeckling are presented. A few experiments on simulated data and real COSMO-SkyMed SAR images highlight, on one side the costperformance tradeoff of the different methods, on the other side the effectiveness of solutions purposely designed for SAR heterogeneity and not fully developed speckle.

40|$|Speckle {{reduction}} {{is a prerequisite}} for many image processing tasks in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images, as well as all coherent images. In recent years, predominant state-of-the-art approaches for despeckling are usually based on nonlocal methods which mainly concentrate on achieving utmost image restoration quality, with relatively low computational efficiency. Therefore, in this study we aim to propose an efficient despeckling model with both high computational efficiency and high recovery quality. To this end, we exploit a newly-developed trainable nonlinear reaction diffusion(TNRD) framework which has proven a simple and effective model for various image restoration problems. In the original TNRD applications, the diffusion network is usually derived based on the direct gradient descent scheme. However, this approach will encounter some problem for the task of multiplicative noise reduction exploited in this study. To solve this problem, we employed a new architecture derived from the proximal gradient descent method. Taking into account the speckle noise statistics, the diffusion process for the despeckling task is derived. We then retrain all the model parameters in the presence of speckle noise. Finally, optimized nonlinear diffusion filtering models are obtained, which are specialized for despeckling with various noise levels. Experimental results substantiate that the trained filtering models provide comparable or even better results than state-of-the-art nonlocal approaches. Meanwhile, our proposed model merely contains convolution of linear filters with an image, which offers high level parallelism on GPUs. As a consequence, for images of size 512 × 512, our GPU implementation takes less than 0. 1 seconds <b>to</b> produce state-of-the-art <b>despeckling</b> performance.

40|$|Optical {{coherence}} tomography (OCT), as a {{newly developed}} imaging modality, has attracted significant attention {{due to its}} capability to obtain the cross-sectional information of biological tissues in a non-invasive way, with resolution {{in the range of}} several micrometers. The third-generation swept source OCT (SS-OCT), is superior in the speed, imaging range and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) compared with the previous time-domain OCT (TD-OCT) and spectral domain OCT (SD-OCT), and therefore forms our research focus. In this thesis, for the first time, I investigate the deployment of Fourier domain mode-locked (FDML) swept laser by utilizing the bismuth-based erbium doper fiber (Bi-EDF) with a sweeping bandwidth of ~ 81 nm achieved. Following, fiber Raman amplifier (FRA) is also investigated by employing multiple Raman pumps. The tuning range is ~ 111. 8 nm, which is much larger than the previous reported Raman pumped FDML in the 1550 nm region. Imaging was performed to validate the feasibility of the proposed schemes for the SS-OCT applications, respectively. In addition to the FDML swept laser cavity design, speckle noise reduction is also of great importance in OCT, which can significantly improve the visibility of the obtained OCT images. I demonstrate two different speckle reduction methods for OCT applications, which are superior in suppressing speckle noise and reserving the one-dimensional (1 D) and two-dimensional (2 D) signal information, respectively. Applying the proposed wavelet domain compounding (WDC) and contourlet shrinkage method <b>to</b> <b>despeckle</b> the OCT images, the visibility of the OCT images was significantly improved, with negligible edge preservation compromise. Spectroscopic information is also of interest to many researchers as it provides additional spectroscopic contrast, which on one hand, will improve the visualization of the images, and on the other hand, will enable the classification of different tissue types and help the process of discrimination between invasive and noninvasive tumors. Compared with our previous reported work about dual-band spectroscopic OCT based on optical parametric amplifier (OPA) to generate another idler band, which will be used as the second band for dual-band spectroscopic analysis, I further extend the dual-band spectroscopic OCT to the endoscopic applications, and investigate the dual-band FDML swept laser configuration based on a custom-designed dual-channel driver to synchronize the two different wavelength bands, centered at 1310 and 1550 nm, respectively. OCT Images for different bands are captured and post-processed by coding the spectral difference in different colors. In short, in this thesis, the investigations of OCT range from system design, speckle reduction to the spectroscopic applications. All these research efforts will extend the current FDML techniques {{for a wide range of}} SS-OCT applications. These schemes may be useful in OCT swept laser source build up, speckle noise reduction, and the extension of spectroscopic analysis. published_or_final_versionElectrical and Electronic EngineeringDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R
