50|$|The {{standard}} K31 {{iron sight}} line elevation concept is somewhat unconventional and designed for center <b>hold</b> (<b>point</b> of aim = point of impact) at the 100 m and 200 m meter settings with GP11 ammunition. Starting at 300 m and more distant ranges the shooter should aim below {{the bottom of}} the target, so that the front sight's post is just out of the way. The 6 o'clock hold is intended for target shooting at 300 m, meaning the sight line is designed to let GP11 ammunition hit 30 cm over the point of aim on a 60 cm diameter bulls eye the Swiss military and shooting clubs used for sighting in the K31, marksmanship training and competitions. A 6 o'clock hold is only good for a known target size at a known distance and will not hold zero without user adjustment if these factors are varied. Combined with GP11 ammunition the 300 m and 400 m settings can alternatively be used as center holds for 400 m and 500 m.|$|E

He assumed the commandment of the 1st platoon of unit of tradition of the 1st Choc Battalion (1er Bataillon de Choc) at Staoueli, on October 30, 1943, then that of the 2nd company of the battalion stationed in Corsica, on December 25, 1943. He illustrated capability during at the corps of his company during the disembarking of Elba, where he was wounded by bullet, on June 7, at the corps of the attack of the strong <b>hold</b> <b>point</b> of San Mamiliano; then in Provence and notable at Toulon, where he gained a citation at the orders of the regiment and a citation at the orders of the armed forces with Chevalier of the Legion of Honour. On October 24, 1944, he commanded the battalion. He was promoted to chef de bataillon on June 25, 1945. His battalion, integrated to the 1st Army Corps (1er Corps d'Armée), crossed France from Cavalaire in Alsace, while passing by Dijon, Haute-Saone, the Vosges and cumulated victories against the German: Chapelle de Ronchamp, September 30, de Fresse, October 3, de Servance and de Miellin, October 3, 4 and 5, Chateau de Lambert, from October 7 to 11.

During the course of his various operations and personal maneuvering, he lost fifty percent of his formation, while his adversary lost 600 personnel. Also during the course of his maneuver operations, he made way with almost 827 prisoners as well an extremely important material. The battalion was cited at the orders of the armed forces with attribution of the Croix de guerre 1939-1945. Personally, he gained two additional citations at the orders of the armed forces for his personal actions: at Toulon, Dijon and against the Bondensee divison. He was wounded by a bomb blast in the right knee, at Melsheim, on January 30, 1945. He was promoted to the rank of Officier of the Legion of Honour, on July 15, 1945. This promotion was matched with a ultimate Croix de guerre 1939-1945, awarded for the advancement of his battalion in Germany and Austria and notably at Moulins d'Eyach, principal strong <b>hold</b> <b>point</b> of the enemy resistance in front of Hofen, Calmbach, Huntergrasse and col of l'Arlberg.|$|E

50|$|On flight day four, Dragon {{performed}} HA-3 and CE-3 thruster burns {{to bring}} it 2.5 km below the station once again. NASA's Mission Control Houston team then gave SpaceX the go ahead to perform another set of burns that brought Dragon to within 1400 m of the station. Another decision was made at Mission Control Houston, and then Dragon moved to 250 m from the station. At this point, the COTS 3 demonstration objectives began. Dragon's DragonEye system demonstrated and confirmed that its position and velocity were accurate by comparing its LIDAR image to its thermal imagers. A series of checkout maneuvers commenced. The SpaceX flight control team in Hawthorne, California, commanded the spacecraft to approach the station from its hold position. It moved from 250 to 220 m below the station. The crew, using the command panel, then instructed Dragon to retreat, and the spacecraft moved {{back down to the}} <b>hold</b> <b>point.</b> This test ensured that Dragon's range to the ISS was accurate, and that the flight control team saw the spacecraft's acceleration and braking perform as expected.

5000|$|Kato {{was called}} up to Hanshin's first team in July 2011, but he {{struggled}} for consistency in 4 appearances and was returned to the second team just two weeks later. He finished the 2011 season with 31 second-team appearances and an ERA of 2.83.In 2012 Kato made 41 relief appearances for the Tigers' first team, {{in part due to}} Ken Nishimura's unavailability due to injury. Kato mainly appeared to finish games that Hanshin was either losing or had a large lead, but he showed consistency with an ERA of 0.83. He started the 2013 season on the first team roster, and was increasingly used in the set-up role {{from the start of the}} season due to the team's closer, Yasutomo Kubo being injured. On June 28 in a match against Hiroshima at Koshien Stadium, Kato recorded the first save in his 13-year professional career. Kato attributed his revitalization to concentrating on his pitching at a deeper level, something he learnt from his former Yokohama teammate Kimiyasu Kudoh, who had a 29-year professional career as a pitcher. On August 21, in a match against his previous club Yokohama, he recorded his first first-team win in more than four years. In a match on August 31 against Hiroshima, Kato entered the game in the 8th inning as Hanshin's third pitcher and struck out three consecutive batters, protecting a 1-run lead and earning a <b>hold</b> <b>point.</b> Hanshin went on to win the game and Kato was selected for a post-match [...] "hero interview" [...] on the ground, his first such selection since joining Hanshin. Asked by the interviewer how the view from the podium was, Kato removed his trademark sunglasses and replied that it was [...] "the greatest". He went on to say [...] "This is my first time (on the podium since joining Hanshin). I feel like crying, but I am truly happy. Shintaro did his best and his 10th win was on the line, so I tried my hardest." [...] Kato was referring to Shintaro Fujinami, who was standing alongside him on the interview podium and was the 5th person in the history of Japanese professional baseball to earn 10 wins in their first season after being drafted out of high school. Kato's emotions got the better of him and he then started crying. During the 2013 season Kato made a career high 61 appearances and had 16 holds, becoming an important part of the Tigers bullpen with Shinobu Fukuhara and Yuya Ando.The 2014 season saw Kato again start in the first team squad but was dropped to the second team in July. He was recalled to the first team squad twice in August, but dropped again each time just four days later, with lower back pain causing his pitching to be inconsistent. He was left out of the 40-man squad selected for the Japan Series against the SoftBank Hawks [...] Despite being active only in the first half of the season, Kato made 32 appearances and recorded 3 wins, his most since 2002, with an ERA of 4.56, which was close to his career average of 4.39.|$|E
