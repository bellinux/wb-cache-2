The {{piezoelectric effect}} is a reversible process in that materials exhibiting the direct piezoelectric effect (the internal generation of electrical charge resulting from an applied mechanical force) also exhibit the reverse piezoelectric effect (the internal generation of a mechanical strain resulting from an applied electrical field). For example, lead zirconate titanate crystals will generate measurable piezoelectricity when their static structure is deformed by about 0.1% of the original dimension.

25|$|A {{piezoelectric}} transformer {{is a type}} of AC voltage multiplier. Unlike {{a conventional}} transformer, which uses magnetic coupling between input and output, the piezoelectric transformer uses acoustic coupling. An input voltage is applied across a short length of a bar of piezoceramic material such as PZT, creating an alternating stress in the bar by the <b>inverse</b> <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>effect</b> and causing the whole bar to vibrate. The vibration frequency is chosen to be the resonant frequency of the block, typically in the 100kilohertz to 1megahertz range. A higher output voltage is then generated across another section of the bar by the piezoelectric effect. Step-up ratios of more than 1,000:1 have been demonstrated. An extra feature of this transformer is that, by operating it above its resonant frequency, it can be made to appear as an inductive load, which is useful in circuits that require a controlled soft start. These devices can be used in DC–AC inverters to drive cold cathode fluorescent lamps. Piezo transformers {{are some of the most}} compact high voltage sources.|$|E

In their work, {{the effect of}} the feedback gain and the volume fraction on the plate frequency and displacement was studied. Es’haghi et al. (2011) presented an analytical solution for vibration study of piezoelectric coupled FG Mindlin plates which have open-circuit piezoelectric patches and have been used as sensors. Alibeigloo (2010) presented an analytical solution for FG beams integrated with orthotropic piezoelectric actuator and sensor, under an applied electric field and thermo-mechanical load. Studies on {{the effect of the}} grading index, thickness ratio, the electromechanical coupling, and thermo-mechanical surface boundary condition on the bending behavior of the structure were analyzed. Static analysis of functionally graded, transversely isotropic, and magneto-electro-elastic circular plate under uniform mechanical load was discussed by Li et al. (2008). In this investigation, they represented displacements and electric potential by appropriate polynomials in the radial coordinate. Shiyekar and Kant (2010) {{investigated the}} bidirectional flexure behavior of FG plates with integrated piezoelectric fiber reinforced composites. They considered the HSDT theory to analyze the performance of this plate subjected to electromechanical loadings. The electrostatic potential was assumed as layer-wise linear through the thickness of the piezoelectric layer. Shen (2005) presented a postbuckling analysis for a simply supported and functionally graded plate with piezoelectric actuators subjected to the combined action of mechanical, electrical, and thermal loads. The governing equations in his study were based on a thermo-piezoelectric higher-order shear deformation plate theory. Fakhari et al. (2011) suggested a FE formulation based on the HSDT plate theory to investigate the nonlinear natural frequencies, time, and frequency responses of FG plate with surface-bonded piezoelectric layers under thermal, electrical, and mechanical loads. Numerical results have been presented to study the effects of the volume fraction exponent, the applied voltage in piezoelectric layers, the thermal load, and the vibration amplitude on nonlinear natural frequencies, and time response of the plate with integrated piezoelectric layers was studied. Hashemi et al. (2012) developed an analytical solution for the free vibration of piezoelectric coupled FG thick circular/annular plates on the basis of Mindlin's first-order shear deformation plate theory (FSDT) and studied the effects of coupling between in-plane and transverse displacements on the frequency parameters. Komeili et al. (2011) carried out the bending of problem of beams made of FG piezoelectric materials under a combined thermo-electro-mechanical load. They considered different shear deformation theories to perform a parametric study focused on the evaluation of the effect of the material composition, voltage, end supports, shear deformation, and the slenderness ratio on the thermo-electro-mechanical performance. Loja et al. (2013) studied the static and free vibration behavior of functionally graded sandwich plate-type structures, using B-spline finite strip element models based on different shear deformation theories. Geometrical nonlinear static and free vibration analyses of FG piezoelectric plates using FEM were studied by Behjat and Khoshravan (2012). On their work, different sets of mechanical and electrical loadings were considered. The plate with FG piezoelectric material was considered to vary gradually through the thickness by a power law distribution. The electric potential was assumed to vary in a quadratic way through the thickness and was considered to be a nodal degree of freedom. Liew et al.

For a third order tensor, we define its transpose, kernel tensor and L-eigenvalues. Here, "L" is named after Levi-Civita. The transpose of a third order tensor is uniquely defined. In particular, the transpose of the piezoelectric tensor is the <b>inverse</b> <b>piezoelectric</b> tensor (the electrostriction tensor). The kernel tensor of a third order tensor is a second order positive semi-definite symmetric tensor, which is the product of that third order tensor and its transpose.

40|$|Micro-Raman {{thermography}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular techniques for measuring local temperature rise in gallium nitride (GaN) high electron mobility transistors with high spatial and temporal resolution. However, accurate temperature measurements based on changes in the Stokes peak positions of the GaN epitaxial layers require properly accounting for the stress and/or strain induced by the <b>inverse</b> <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>effect.</b> It is common practice to use the pinched OFF state as the unpowered reference for temperature measurements because the vertical electric field in the GaN buffer that induces inverse piezoelectric stress/strain is relatively independent of the gate bias. Although this approach has yielded temperature measurements that agree with those derived from the Stokes/anti-Stokes ratio and thermal models, there has been significant difficulty in quantifying the mechanical state of the GaN buffer in the pinched OFF state from changes in the Raman spectra. In this paper, we review the experimental technique of micro-Raman thermography and derive expressions for the detailed dependence of the Raman peak positions on strain, stress, and electric field components in wurtzite GaN. We also use a combination of semiconductor device modeling and electro-mechanical modeling to predict the stress and strain induced by the <b>inverse</b> <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>effect.</b> Based on the insights gained from our electro-mechanical model and the best values of material properties in the literature, we analyze changes in the E 2 high and A 1 (LO) Raman peaks and demonstrate that there are major quantitative discrepancies between measured and modeled values of inverse piezoelectric stress and strain. We examine many of the hypotheses offered in the literature for these discrepancies but conclude that none of them satisfactorily resolves these discrepancies.
