In all cases, the rate of rise of the primary magnetizing current (and hence the flux), or the rate-of-rise of the flux directly in the case of saturated core material, drops to zero (or close to zero). In the first two cases, although primary current continues to flow, it approaches a steady value equal to the supply voltage Vb divided by the total resistance(s) R in the primary circuit. In this current-limited condition the transformer's flux will be steady. Only changing flux causes induction of voltage into the secondary, so a steady flux represents a failure of induction. The secondary voltage drops to zero. The switch opens.|$|E

In this paper, we present a novel single step polishing process which we apply post double sided texturing and diffusion in order to remove the rear emitter and to reduce the rear surface roughness.

TEM and SIMS are used to characterise the emitter contact material and the interface structure and a comparison is made with Gummel plots and emitter resistances on bipolar transistors. The SIMS results show that an in-situ hydrogen bake in a cluster tool gives an extremely low oxygen dose at the interface of 6. 3 E 13 cm- 2, compared with 7. 7 E 14 and 2. 9 E 15 cm- 2 for an ex-situ HF etch and deposition in a cluster tool or a LPCVD furnace respectively. TEM shows that the in-situ hydrogen bake results in single-crystal silicon with a high density of defects, including dislocations and twins.

40|$|WO 2011023312 A 1 UPAB: 20110315 NOVELTY - In {{measuring}} a {{solar cell}} (precursor) semiconductor structure (I) by determining dark saturation current, <b>emitter</b> layer <b>resistance</b> and/or local series resistance at local points of (I) using an image based on measurements of emitted luminescent radiation generated in (I), (i) second measurements under different conditions {{are used to}} give a second image and (ii) a voltage-independent, site-independent short circuit current density flowing under both conditions is predetermined and/or measured. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - A method for measuring a semiconductor structure (I), consisting of a solar cell (or its precursor) having an emitter and a base, involves: (A) measuring emitted luminescent radiation generated in (I), using a first measurement under first conditions to provide data to create a first spatially resolved, voltage-calibrated image for several local points of the cell; and (B) determining spatially resolved dark saturation current, <b>emitter</b> layer <b>resistance</b> and/or local series resistance properties of (I) for the local points, depending on at least the image from step (A). The novel feature is that step (A) also includes second analogous measurement(s) under second, different conditions to give an analogous second image. For both steps in (A) measurements radiation is generated by applying excitation radiation to (I) in planar manner; and the two measurement conditions differ in excitation radiation intensity and/or spectral composition and/or in a predetermined external voltage applied to (I) via electrical contact. A voltage-independent, site-independent short circuit current density of current flowing under the two conditions is also predetermined and/or measured. In step (B) the electrical properties at each point are determined dependent on at least the above short circuit current densities and a voltage-dependent, site-dependent dark current density for each measurement condition, the dark current densities being at least dependent on the voltage-independent dark saturation current density and the two voltages resulting from the respective voltage images for a particular site. USE - For characterizing a solar cell (or its precursor), by measuring site-specific electrical magnitudes (i. e. dark saturation current, <b>emitter</b> layer <b>resistance</b> and/or local series resistance) using photoluminescent radiation generated in the structure. The method is especially useful for monitoring the quality of industrially prepared solar cells. ADVANTAGE - The dark saturation current, <b>emitter</b> layer <b>resistance</b> and local series resistance of (I) can be measured without the restriction {{that one of these}} three magnitudes must be predetermined or spatially constant. The solar cell characterization possibilities obtainable by photoluminescent radiation measurement are markedly extended.
