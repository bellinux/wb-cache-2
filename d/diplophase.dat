50|$|Most strains are haploid, mating {{very rarely}} and diploidize transiently by somatogamous autogamy (i.e. fusion of two cells but {{excluding}} their nuclei). Sexual reproduction proceeds via heterogamous conjugation (i.e. the conjugation of two cells of different form or size) leading to short <b>diplophase</b> followed by meiosis and ascospore formation. Haploid yeasts reproduce vegetatively by multilateral budding.|$|E
40|$|Gloeoporus taxicola is a {{widespread}} saprotrophic polypore that occurs {{on a variety of}} coniferous substrates in the Northern Hemisphere. In this master thesis a multi-locus sequencing approach was used, on an extensive worldwide sample, to investigate the phylogepgraphy of G. taxicola in the light of substrate affinity. <b>Diplophase</b> sequences from two nuclear markers gave a complex phylogeographic pattern that roughly divided the specimens into two evolutionary lineages, but some admixed and highly heterozygous sequences appeared as well. To increase the resolution, cloning was performed and haplophase sequences obtained. This revealed three main clusters of haplotypes, one representing a European lineage associated with pine, while the other two had more northern circumboreal distributions, occurring on a wide number of substrates. Some specimens contained two highly divergent haplophase sequences, probably reflecting hybridization and further introgression between the separate evolutionary lineages. There was a strong indication of different host affinity between the two evolutionary lineages and one of the main lineages showed rather strong host specificity for a saprobic fungus. This study demonstrates the importance of splitting heterozygous <b>diplophase</b> sequences into its underlying haplophase sequences to obtain a more comprehensive resolution in phylogeographic studies...|$|E
40|$|Assays of five Polish {{populations of}} Plagiochila asplenioides (Hepaticae, Plagiochilaceae) for {{peroxidase}} isozymes revealed three bands differing in electrophoretic mobility. The phenotypes observed {{appear to be}} governed by three loci; each locus has two alleles, one of which produces a band and the other no band, i. e., the second allele is silent, or null. Marked variability in enzyme phenotypes was found both within and between populations. The evolutionary implications of this variability are {{discussed in terms of}} the persistent haplophase and ephemeral <b>diplophase</b> of this organism...|$|E
40|$|Mobile genetic {{elements}} may be molecular parasites {{that reduce}} the fitness of individuals that bear them by causing predominantly deleterious mutations, but increase in frequency when rare because transposition increases their rates of transmission to the progeny of crosses between infected and uninfected individuals. If this is true, then the initial spread of a mobile element requires sex. We tested this prediction using the yeast retrotransposon Ty 3 and {{a strain of}} Saccharomyces cerevisiae lacking Ty 3. We infected replicate isogenic sexual and asexual populations with a galactose-inducible Ty 3 element at an initial frequency of 1 %. In two of six asexual populations, active Ty 3 elements increased in frequency to 38 and 86 %, due to the spread in each population of a competitively superior mutant carrying a new Ty 3 insertion. Ty 3 frequencies increased above 80 % in all sexual populations in which transposition was induced in haplophase or in <b>diplophase.</b> Ty 3 did not increase in frequency when active during both haplophase and <b>diplophase,</b> apparently because of selective sweeps during adaptation to galactose. Repressed Ty 3 elements spread in sexual populations, by increasing sexual fitness. These results indicate that active Ty 3 elements {{are more likely to}} become established in sexual populations than in asexual populations...|$|E
40|$|A {{comparative}} study of ontomorphogenesis and polyvariance of two epilithic ferns gametophytes Asplenium adiantum-nigrum and Adiantum capillus-veneris is carried out. The spores of two species significantly differ in their structure. The germination of spores of two species goes on Vittaria-type. The development of prothallium goes on two different types. The investigated ferns also showed significant morphological diversity of gametophytes forms. The differences are found also and in the location of gametangiums on prothallus, and in the rates of sexualization. At the studied species vegetative reproduction by means of proliferation is noted. The following types of ontogenesis are tracked: full and reduced functionally finished ontogenesis with reproduction of <b>diplophase</b> (sporophytes), and also full and reduced functionally not finished ontogenesis. The structural and dynamic polyvariance of gametophytes ontogenesis of two species of ferns is found out...|$|E
40|$|A mutant of Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{representing}} a novel life cycle, named ``alternative self-diploidization'' or ``ASD'' homothallism, was obtained fortuitously. In this life cycle, MATα (or MATa) haplophase and MATα/MATα (or MATa/MATa) <b>diplophase</b> alternate. Germinated cells are haploid and mating. They soon become nonmating and sporogenous as they vegetatively grow. They {{sooner or later}} diploidize presumably via endomitosis. The diploid cells haploidize via normal meiosis. A single recessive nuclear mutation, named asd 1 - 1, is responsible for ``ASD'' homothallism. In the ρ(0) cytoplasm, asd 1 - 1 cells mate even if at a low efficiency and fail to diploidize. Since pet mutations do not have such effects, we conclude that a certain mitochondrial function other than respiration is required for manifestation of ``ASD'' homothallism. That is, ``ASD'' homothallism {{is the result of}} some sort of nuclear-cytoplasmic interaction...|$|E
40|$|BAKERS ' yeast {Saccharomyces cerevisiae) is a {{microbial}} 1 eukaryote that undergoes an asymmetric form of {{cell division}} called budding (Strathern et al., 1981, 1982). It exists {{exclusively in the}} unicellular state, but it can develop along one of three alternate pathways: mating (sexual conju-gation) {{in the case of}} haploid cells, the meiotic cell cycle (sporulation) in the case of diploids, and the mitotic cell cycle in both haploid and diploid cells. Because haploids and diploids can multiply vegetatively by mitotic cell division, both the haplophase and the <b>diplophase</b> can be stably main-tained. Yeast display limited nutritional requirements, and they can be cultured in synthetic medium containing only a carbon source, such as glucose, in addition to salts, trace elements, and vitamins. In a rich medium, the culture displays a generation time as short as 80 min, and larg...|$|E
40|$|In the {{prophase}} of both mega- and microsporogenesis, {{a sizeable}} {{proportion of the}} meiocyte cytoplasm becomes invested in double or multiple membrane-bround inclusions. This cytoplasm remains thus isolated {{from the rest of}} the cell until the completion of meiosis II in the female cells, or the 'young spore' stage in those of the male. Significantly this encapsulation proceeds immediately the elimination of the major part of the ribosome population from the cytoplasm and, further, the electron microscope reveals that those ribosomes contained in these membranous inclusions remain unaffected by the lytic enzymes active elsewhere in the cytoplasm at this time. This encapsulated cytoplasm is proposed to fulfill two rôles; one, that it carries reserves necessary for postmeiotic development through from the <b>diplophase</b> to the haplophase environment and, two, that it permits the continuity of protein synthesis throughout meiosis I and II, a period when the major part of the protein synthetic apparatus is absent...|$|E
40|$|The {{events that}} {{accompany}} sporogenesis in the apogamous fern Dryopteris borreri parallel those seen in sexually reproducing ferns. Organelles dedifferentiate and redifferentiate, {{and form a}} discrete band across the equator of dyads; nuclear vacuoles and lipid spherosomes appear during prophase, and the {{major part of the}} ribosome population is removed and subsequently replaced during meiosis. Similar events have been found to occur during sporogenesis in mosses, gymno-sperms and angiosperms, and are therefore characteristic of the meiotic transition from sporophyte to gametophyte, {{even in the absence of}} a transition from <b>diplophase</b> to haplophase. The novel aspects of meiosis in D. borreri are largely those connected with the restitution event that precedes meiosis 1 and serves to maintain the sporophytic chromosome number throughout the life cycle of this fern. Pre-meiotic cells are regularly found to be cleaved by annular wall ingrowths, which traverse the cytoplasm but not the nuclei. The significance of these ingrowths in relation to theories concerning apogamy and plant cell division are discussed...|$|E
40|$|This study reports {{an unusual}} ploidy-specific {{response}} to replication stress presented by a defective minichromosome maintenance (MCM) helicase allele in yeast. The corresponding mouse allele, Mcm 4 Chaos 3, predisposes mice to mammary gland tumors. While mcm 4 Chaos 3 causes replication stress in both haploid and diploid yeast, only diploid mutants exhibit G 2 /M delay, severe genetic instability (GIN), and reduced viability. These different outcomes {{are associated with}} distinct repair pathways adopted in haploid and diploid mutants. Haploid mutants use the Rad 6 -dependent pathways that resume stalled forks, whereas the diploid mutants use the Rad 52 - and MRX-dependent pathways that repair double strand breaks. The repair pathway choice is irreversible and not regulated by the availability of repair enzymes. This ploidy effect is independent of mating type heterozygosity and not further enhanced by increasing ploidy. In summary, a defective MCM helicase causes GIN only in particular cell types. In response to replication stress, early events associated with ploidy dictate the repair pathway choice. This study uncovers a fundamental difference between haplophase and <b>diplophase</b> in the maintenance of genome integrity...|$|E
40|$|Wild-collected {{isolates}} of Neurospora crassa Shear and Dodge were systematically {{examined for}} recessive mutations affecting the sexual {{phase of the}} life cycle, which is essentially diploid. Seventy-four of 99 wild-collected isolates from 26 populations in the United States, India and Pakistan carried one or more recessive mutations that reduced fertility significantly when homozygous; mutations affecting spore morphology were also detected. Limited complementation tests indicate {{that most of the}} 106 recovered mutations are unique. —The recessive <b>diplophase</b> (= sexual phase) mutations were uncovered by crossing each wild-collected isolate to a marked two-chromosome double-reciprocal translocation strain as "balancer. " Surviving progeny receive approximately 60 % of their genome from the wild parent, but receive the mating-type allele from the "balancer" parent. These progeny were backcrossed to the wild parent and were also crossed with a standard laboratory strain (fl). Reduced fertility in the backcross vs. normal fertility in the cross with the laboratory standard signals the presence of a recessive mutation in the wild-collected isolate. —Most of the mutants (95 of 106) fall into two major classes: those producing barren perithecia with no or few viable ascospores (51) and those with spore maturation defects (44). Most of the recessive barrens result either from an early block in meiosis or ascus development (25) or from a late disturbance in postmeiotic ascus behavior (18). —These recessive mutations are formally equivalent to recessive lethals in higher eukaryotes and may be important in determining the breeding structure of natural Neurospora populations...|$|E

40|$|The genus Galaxaura can {{in several}} respects be classed {{among the most}} {{remarkable}} Florideae. It is not only — with Chantransia — the genus richest in forms of all the genera belonging {{to the order of}} Nemalionales, which has more than 70 described species, it also offers, both in its interior and its exterior organization, such a high differentiation, and a tissue specialization going so far, that, as the monographer of the genus, the late Professor F. R. Kjellman (1900), said: ”it may be difficult even in the great province of the Florideae to find forms with a higher or even as high a division of labour in the tissues of the shoot [...] . “. Even if the number of species may actually diminish with further investigations, this is in a way connected with a peculiarity of organization, characteristic of the genus Galaxaura, namely that the sexual plant of a species has quite another anatomical structure of the cortical tissue than does the tetrasporic plant. This remarkable discovery was made by Howe (1917, 1918), who had had the opportunity of studying some species of Galaxaura in the West Indies, in their natural localities. This fact was not known of any Floridea at the time Kjellman wrote his monograph on this genus in 1900. Moreover, Kjellman had a quite different conception of the position of the tetraspores during the course of development of the Florideae than the one we have nowadays formed from the results of the cytological research. To Kjellman the tetraspores or, as he called them, the ”tetragonidia“, were a kind of propagation organ with the character of ”Nebenfruktifikation“, and thus not, as we must now regard them, the reproduction bodies of the diploid generation ending the <b>diplophase</b> in the alternation of generations. Thus, when Kjellman in his herbarial studies found forms of Galaxaura with otherwise similar organization but with quite a different cortical anatomy, it was quite natural that he described them as new species. One of the tasks of future taxonomical research will therefore be to combine such ”species“ of Kjellman as, in reality, are only the sexual and the tetrasporic generation of one and the same species. Naturally, this problem can only be solved by a botanist who has the opportunity of studying the development of the Galaxaurae in their native localities. Finally, only cultures will be really decisive. However, the number of species of Galaxaura will certainly be reduced...|$|E
