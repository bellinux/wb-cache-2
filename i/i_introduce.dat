500|$|With {{the season}} reinventing the series again, {{composer}} Bear McCreary expanded {{the sound of}} the score [...] "in a big way". In addition to introducing new themes for the characters of Lash and Rosalind Price, McCreary made some changes to the orchestra: [...] "To represent Lash, I brought in larger percussion: merciless pounding taikos that I digitally compressed and distorted. This new, mangled percussion sound is horrific, and will become increasingly important as the season progresses." [...] McCreary also brought in trombones [...] "to get the scariest sound possible," [...] which resulted in the recording space being reconfigured when they were recorded. For Price, her scenes with Coulson [...] "give the series the feeling of a dense political thriller...I really leaned into that, musically. <b>I</b> <b>introduce</b> light acoustic percussion, mostly egg shakers, to give the pulsing synths a softer edge. And I used an acoustic piano to play the [...] "Rosalind Theme" [...] at key moments in her scenes...her music is meant to add intrigue and suspicion, and simultaneously allow us to have some fun with their witty banter." [...] For [...] "Maveth", McCreary used a 90-piece orchestra rather than the series' typical 50 or 70 players.|$|E
