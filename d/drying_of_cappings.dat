But the study on it was mainly concerned to the former, because records of the practice were not much in the past.

50|$|The {{first step}} in the {{extraction}} process is to break or remove all <b>of</b> the <b>cappings.</b> This may be accomplished using an automated uncapper machine or with a manually-operated uncapping knife. Usually, these tools are used together, along with a pronged cappings fork. To facilitate cutting off these wax cappings, the knife is often heated. The removed bits <b>of</b> wax, called <b>cappings,</b> are rich in honey which can be slowly drained off with the help of some heating. This 'cappings wax' is very valuable and often used to make candles or other products. Automated uncapping machines normally work by abrading the surface of the wax with moving chains or bristles or hot knives. This, while messy, makes the process easier than doing this task manually.|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} extend shelf life {{of rice and}} coffee, drying can be {{conducted}} to minimize water content so that chemical and biological changes can be retarded. Several models have been proposed to model <b>drying</b> <b>of</b> coffee and rice.

The reaction engineering approach (REA) is applied in this study to model convective <b>drying</b> <b>of</b> coffee as well as convective and intermittent <b>drying</b> <b>of</b> rice. The REA is a unique approach to model drying; the physics <b>of</b> <b>drying</b> is captured by the relative activation energy which can be generated only from one accurate drying experiment.
