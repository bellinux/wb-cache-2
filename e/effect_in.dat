Systematic sheepskin <b>effects</b> are found <b>in</b> labour-force participation and conditional hours of work, as well as in wage rates. Moreover, the sheepskin <b>effects</b> <b>in</b> hours of work are apparently not simply endogenous responses to the sheepskin <b>effects</b> <b>in</b> wage rates. Thus, sheepskin <b>effects</b> <b>in</b> earnings are much larger than those previously shown for wage rates.
