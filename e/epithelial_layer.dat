5|$|Metazoans are {{multicellular}} organism, {{different groups}} of cells of which have separate functions. The most basic types of metazoan tissues are epithelium and connective tissue, {{both of which are}} present in nearly all invertebrates. The outer surface of the epidermis is normally formed of epithelial cells and secretes an extracellular matrix which provides support to the organism. An endoskeleton derived from the mesoderm is present in echinoderms, sponges and some cephalopods. Exoskeletons are derived from the epidermis and is composed of chitin in arthropods (insects, spiders, ticks, shrimps, crabs, lobsters). Calcium carbonate constitutes the shells of molluscs, brachiopods and some tube-building polychaete worms and silica forms the exoskeleton of the microscopic diatoms and radiolaria. Other invertebrates may have no rigid structures but the epidermis may secrete a variety of surface coatings such as the pinacoderm of sponges, the gelatinous cuticle of cnidarians (polyps, sea anemones, jellyfish) and the collagenous cuticle of annelids. The outer <b>epithelial</b> <b>layer</b> may include cells of several types including sensory cells, gland cells and stinging cells. There may also be protrusions such as microvilli, cilia, bristles, spines and tubercles.|$|E

Normally stratified squamous epithelium shows progressive changes {{in the form of}} cells from the basal to the superficial layers, with cells becoming more flat ("squames") towards the surface as a continuous maturation process. In dysplastic epithelium, cells may become vertically orientated rather than becoming flat towards the surface.|$|R
30|$|HBE (series 1) and BEAS- 2 B (series 2) {{confluent}} <b>epithelial</b> <b>layers</b> were equilibrated in normocapnia or HCA {{and then}} subjected to injurious cyclic stretch (i.e., 22  % equibiaxial stretch at a frequency of 0.1  Hz in the Flexcell FX- 4000 T®) for 24  h. The potential for HCA to attenuate stretch-induced inflammation, maintain cell membrane integrity, and enhance cell survival in HBE and BEAS- 2 B <b>epithelial</b> <b>layers</b> was then determined.|$|R
40|$|Accurate {{cervical}} intra-epithelial neoplasia (CIN) lesion grading {{is needed}} for effective patient management. We applied computer-assisted scanning and analytic approaches to immuno-stained CIN lesion sections to more accurately delineate disease states and decipher cell proliferation impacts from HPV and smoking within individual <b>epithelial</b> <b>layers.</b> A patient cohort undergoing cervical screening was identified (n =  196) and biopsies of varying disease grades and with intact basement membranes and <b>epithelial</b> <b>layers</b> were obtained (n =  261). Specimens were sectioned, stained (Mib 1), and scanned using a high-resolution imaging system. We achieved semi-automated delineation of proliferation status and <b>epithelial</b> cell <b>layers</b> using Otsu segmentation, manual image review, Voronoi tessellation, and immuno-staining. Data were interrogated against known status for HPV infection, smoking, and disease grade. We observed increased cell proliferation and decreased epithelial thickness with increased disease grade (when analyzing the epithelium at full thickness). Analysis within individual cell layers showed a ≥ 50 % increase in cell proliferation for CIN 2 vs. CIN 1 lesions in higher <b>epithelial</b> <b>layers</b> (with minimal differences seen in basal/parabasal layers). Higher rates of proliferation for HPV-positive vs. -negative cases were seen in <b>epithelial</b> <b>layers</b> beyond the basal/parabasal layers in normal and CIN 1 tissues. Comparing smokers vs. non-smokers, we observed increased cell proliferation in parabasal (low and high grade lesions) and basal layers (high grade only). In sum, we report CIN grade-specific differences in cell proliferation within individual <b>epithelial</b> <b>layers.</b> We also show HPV and smoking impacts on cell layer-specific proliferation. Our findings yield insight into CIN progression biology and demonstrate that rigorous, semi-automated imaging of histopathological specimens may be applied to improve disease grading accuracy...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{relationship}} between the P-glycoprotein-mediated vinblastine secretion and cell-swelling activated Cl− secretion (conductance) in intact <b>epithelial</b> <b>layers</b> of human colonic adenocarcinoma T 84 cells has been investigated. Whereas vinblastine secretion is effectively inhibited by 100 μM 1, 9 -dideoxy-forskolin, volume-stimulated Cl− secretion is unaffected. In contrast, 100 μM 4, 4 ′-diisothiocyanostilbene- 2, 2 ′disulphonic acid (DIDS) inhibited the volume-stimulated Cl− secretion, but was without effect upon transepithelial vinblastine secretion. In addition, {{it was noted that}} some <b>epithelial</b> <b>layers</b> failed to express a volume-stimulated Cl− secretion but maintained a normal level of secretory vinblastine flux...|$|R

25|$|One of the {{earliest}} signs {{in the formation of}} a tooth that can be seen microscopically is the distinction between the vestibular lamina and the dental lamina. The dental lamina connects the developing tooth bud to the <b>epithelial</b> <b>layer</b> of the mouth for a significant time. This is regarded as the initiation stage.|$|E
25|$|In normal early {{embryonic}} development, {{the outer}} <b>epithelial</b> <b>layer</b> contains cytotrophoblast cells, a stem cell type {{found in the}} trophoblast that later differentiates into the fetal placenta. These cells differentiate into many placental cells types, including extravillous trophoblast cells. Extravillous trophoblast cells are an invasive cell type which remodel the maternal spiral arteries by replacing the maternal epithelium and smooth muscle lining the spiral arteries causing artery dilation. This prevents maternal vasoconstriction in the spiral arteries and allows for continued blood and nutrient supply to the growing fetus with low resistance and high blood flow.|$|E
25|$|The zygote remains {{inactive}} for sometime {{but it soon}} elongates, becomes vermiform (worm-like) and motile. It is {{now known}} as ookinete. The pointed ends of ookinete penetrate the stomach wall and come to lie below its outer <b>epithelial</b> <b>layer.</b> Here the zygote becomes spherical and develops a cyst wall around itself. The cyst wall is derived partly from the stomach tissues and partly produced by the zygote itself. At this stage, the zygote is known as an oocyst. The oocyst absorbs nourishment and grows in size. Oocysts protrude from the surface of stomach, giving it a blistered appearance. In a highly infected mosquito, as many as 1000 oocysts may be seen.|$|E
40|$|We analyze a {{stochastic}} model that describes receptor-mediated ligand trapping in <b>epithelial</b> <b>layers</b> and cell culture assays. In both cases, {{the problem is}} reduced to diffusion of a Brownian particle between the partially absorbing and reflective surfaces. We derive an analytical expression for the spatial distribution of the trapping points and identify the domains of applicability of the two limiting regimes. We conclude that a thin layer approximation is applicable for ligand trapping in <b>epithelial</b> <b>layers</b> while a typical cell culture experiment is appropriately described within an infinite layer approximation. 2003 Elsevier B.

40|$|The {{patterns}} of expression of keratins K 1 and K 8, filaggrin, and the proliferation-associated protein, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), were studied in normal and human papillomavirus (HPV) 16 or 18 immortalized keratinocyte cell lines grown on organotypic raft cultures. Normal keratinocytes produced an epithelial sheet that closely resembled epidermis in vivo, characterized {{by lack of}} K 8 expression, PCNA expression restricted to the basal layer, and K 1 and filaggrin expression in the suprabasal layers. Although morphologically abnormal in many respects, some HPV-immortalized cell lines produced cornified <b>epithelial</b> <b>layers</b> and approximated the normals in their {{patterns of}} expression of keratins and filaggrin. Other HPV-immortalized cell lines produced poorly differentiated <b>epithelial</b> <b>layers</b> that were characterized by loss of filaggrin expression, and the single tumorigenic cell line, 18 - 11, was distinguished by abundant K 8 expression. All of the HPV-immortalized cell lines were distinguished from normal keratinocytes by a common pattern of full-thickness PCNA expression in the <b>epithelial</b> <b>layers</b> they produced, suggesting that maintenance of the proliferative state {{may be an important}} contribution made by HPV 16 or 18 sequences toward the production of a malignant phenotype...|$|R

2500|$|Gliadin {{proteins}} can be adsorbed by APC. After digestion in the lysozomes of APCs, glaidin peptides can {{be recycled}} to the cell's surface bound to DQ, {{or they can}} be bound and presented directly from the cell surface. The major source of inflammatory gluten is dietary gluten. Optimal reactivity of gliadin occurs when the protein is partially digested by small intestinal lysozyme and trypsin into proteolytic digests. These polypeptides of gluten can then make their way behind the <b>epithelial</b> <b>layer</b> of cells (membrane), where APCs and T-cells reside in the lamina propria.

2500|$|Much about gingival {{formation}} {{is not fully}} understood, but {{it is known that}} hemidesmosomes form between the gingival epithelium and the tooth and are responsible for the primary epithelial attachment. Hemidesmosomes provide anchorage between cells through small filament-like structures provided by the remnants of ameloblasts. [...] Once this occurs, junctional epithelium forms from reduced enamel epithelium, one of the products of the enamel organ, and divides rapidly. This results in the perpetually increasing size of the junctional <b>epithelial</b> <b>layer</b> and the isolation of the remnants of ameloblasts from any source of nutrition. As the ameloblasts degenerate, a gingival sulcus is created.|$|E

2500|$|Erosions, {{which involve}} the <b>epithelial</b> <b>layer,</b> are red in {{appearance}} since the underlying lamina propria shows through. When the full {{thickness of the}} epithelium is penetrated (ulceration), the lesion becomes covered with a fibrinous exudate and takes on a yellow-grey color. Because an ulcer is a breach of the normal lining, when seen in cross section, the lesion is a crater. A [...] "halo" [...] may be present, which is a reddening of the surrounding mucosa and is caused by inflammation. There may also be edema (swelling) around the ulcer. Chronic trauma may produce an ulcer with a keratotic (white, thickened mucosa) margin. Malignant lesions may ulcerate either because the tumor infiltrates the mucosa from adjacent tissues, or because the lesion originates within the mucosa itself, and the disorganized growth leads to {{a break in the}} normal architecture of the lining tissues. Repeat episodes of mouth ulcers can be indicative of an immunodeficiency, signaling low levels of immunoglobulin in the oral mucous membranes. Chemotherapy, HIV, and mononucleosis are all causes of immunodeficiency/immunosuppression with which oral ulcers may become a common manifestation. Autoimmunity is also a cause of oral ulceration. Mucous membrane pemphigoid, an autoimmune reaction to the epithelial basement membrane, causes desquamation/ulceration of the oral mucosa.|$|E

50|$|The Papillomavirus {{life cycle}} begins with cells {{actively}} multiplying in epithelial cells of basal and parabasal layers. The differentiation of these cells {{is necessary for}} this virus to complete its life cycle. Transforming proteins E6 and E7 induce the S-phase in the lower <b>epithelial</b> <b>layers.</b> Viral replication proteins E1 and E2 are also required to form the papilloma and keep the episomal viral genome replication low. Genome amplification will be restrained until viral replication proteins increase and several viral proteins are co-expressed. The infected, differentiating cells travel towards the epithelial surface during the viral cycle’s late stage. In the upper <b>epithelial</b> <b>layers,</b> the promoter activity is altered during the virus’ production. E4 proteins are expressed, and viral DNA amplification starts in the differentiated cells. Following this, the L1 and L2 viral capsid proteins are expressed and the infectious virions begin to assemble.|$|R
40|$|Pattern {{formation}} in <b>epithelial</b> <b>layers</b> heavily relies on cell communication by secreted ligands. Whereas the experimentally observed signaling patterns can be visualized at single-cell resolution, a biophysical framework for their interpretation is currently lacking. To this end, we develop {{a family of}} discrete models of cell communication in <b>epithelial</b> <b>layers.</b> The models {{are based on the}} introduction of cell-to-cell coupling coefficients that characterize the spatial range of intercellular signaling by diffusing ligands. We derive the coupling coefficients as functions of geometric, cellular, and molecular parameters of the ligand transport problem. Using these coupling coefficients, we analyze a nonlinear model of positive feedback between ligand release and binding. In particular, we study criteria of existence of the patterns consisting of clusters of a few signaling cells, as well as the onset of signal propagation. We use our model to interpret recent experimental studies of the EGFR/Rhomboid/Spitz module in Drosophila development. ...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: To {{describe}} bilateral corneal alterations through confocal microscopy in {{a patient}} affected by Cowden syndrome (CS). Methods: Evaluation of Schirmer's, fluorescein, and lissamine green dye tests. Confocal microscopy was performed in both eyes to investigate corneal abnormalities.

Conclusion: CS is a rare autosomal-dominant systemic disorder. In our case, confocal analysis revealed predominance of alterations in the anterior stromal corneal layer, showing an increase of reflectivity, and a totally unstructured architecture in the epithelium layer.

40|$|Objective: The use {{of three}} {{dimensional}} in vitro systems in cancer research is a promising path for developing effective anticancer therapies. The {{aim of this}} study was to engineer a functional 3 -D in vitro model of normal and cancerous cervical tissue. Methods: Normal epithelial and immortalized cervical epithelial carcinoma cell lines were used to construct 3 -D artificial normal cervical and cervical cancerous tissues. De-epidermised dermis (DED) was used as a scaffold for both models. Morphological analyses were conducted by using haematoxylin and eosin staining and characteristics of the models were studied by analysing the expression of different structural cytokeratins and differential protein marker Mad 1 using immunohistochemical technique. Results: Haematoxylin and eosin staining results showed that normal cervical tissue had multi <b>epithelial</b> <b>layers</b> while cancerous cervical tissue showed dysplastic changes. Immunohistochemistry staining results revealed that for normal cervix model cytokeratin 10 was expressed in the upper stratified layer of epithelium while cytokeratin 5 was expressed mainly in the middle and basal layer. Cytokeratin 19 was weakly expressed in a few basal cells. Cervical cancer model showed cytokeratin 19 expression in different <b>epithelial</b> <b>layers</b> and weak or no expression for cytokeratin 5 and cytokeratin 10. Mad 1 expression was detected in some suprabasal cells. Conclusions: The 3 -D in vitro models showed stratified <b>epithelial</b> <b>layers</b> and expressed the same types and patterns of differentiation marker proteins as seen in corresponding in vivo tissue in either normal cervical or cervical cancerous tissue. Findings imply that they can serve as functional normal and cervical cancer models...|$|R
