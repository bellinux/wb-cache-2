5|$|Scully leaves The Smoking Man {{and gives}} the disc to The Lone Gunmen to analyze, but <b>it</b> <b>turns</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>The</b> Smoking Man swapped the disc for a blank one. She {{goes back to his}} office but it has been emptied. Mulder informs her that this was a con and she was used to {{retrieve}} this information, but he does not understand why The Smoking Man left Scully alive. The final scene shows The Smoking Man throwing the real disc into a lake.|$|E
5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. In the episode, Mulder is brought in to {{investigate}} a series of ritualistic murders in Los Angeles, which he first believes were {{the work of a}} cult. However, <b>it</b> <b>turns</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> perpetrators are a group of vampires.|$|E
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>turns</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{aliens are}} NBC {{executive}} Herb Goodman, played by Elliott Gould, and his associate Curtis, played by Garrett Morris. They {{announce that the}} Star Trek series has been cancelled. Captain Kirk orders the crew to fire their hand phasers at the aliens but nothing happens. Mr. Spock assumes that the aliens have a type of weapons de-activator and tries to employ his famous Vulcan nerve pinch on him, {{but that does not}} work either. The executive confiscates Mr. Spock's pointed ears. Spock then mind-melds with Goodman only to discover that, as he describes it, his brain is devoid of substance and contains only a few rodents.|$|E

5|$|The {{pursuing}} crowd arrives, {{but they}} are soon turned around {{on the subject of}} Whacking Day by Bart's newfound knowledge. <b>It</b> <b>turns</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> day was actually invented in 1924 as an excuse to beat up the Irish. Principal Skinner is impressed with Bart's efforts and welcomes him back to the school, but then realizes in horror that the bullies are still in the utility basement. While the bullies are spending the time talking about their feelings, Principal Skinner and Willie race to the school with the mountain bikes to avoid a potential lawsuit.|$|E
5|$|The series {{follows the}} adventures of Finn (voiced by Jeremy Shada), a human boy, and his best friend and adoptive brother Jake (voiced by John DiMaggio), a dog with magical powers to change shape and grow and shrink at will. In this episode, Finn and Jake stumble into two {{different}} holes and meet two different fates: Finn becomes the guest of the unstable King Huge (voiced by Jones), who insists that Finn remain with him and stare at his idiosyncratic cuckoo clock; whereas Jake meets Seven (voiced by Isaak), a bear whose makeshift air raft has been falling down the hole for years. Eventually, <b>it</b> <b>turns</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> hole Jake and Seven are falling through is the chimney to the kitchen where Finn is being held captive. As such, Jake is eventually able to save Finn.|$|E
5|$|Black {{believes}} Prine is not {{driven by}} malice; he and Watts use {{the resources of}} the Millennium Group to find his home, discovering the dense writings across his floors. They learn that Prine believes a third world war is imminent, and took the children as he believes one of them is destined to bring peace during this time, wishing to protect this child when he learns which one it is destined to be. Black seeks aid from another Group member, Lara Means (Kristen Cloke), who is able to observe Prine's behavioural tells for clues when interviewing him. This, coupled with analysis of soil from his clothing, points to the children being held in an aluminium quarry. The investigators rush to the quarry, where Prine's accomplice engages them in a firefight. However, the advancing tornado forces them to take cover; it kills Prine and lifts the roof from the entombing bunker. It subsides as quickly as it arrived, and the children emerge safely from the wreckage; Black senses that Cayce's daughter may be the prophesied peacemaker. <b>It</b> <b>turns</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> tornado destroyed the school where the children would have been if they weren't abducted, and that Prine had saved their lives.|$|E

5|$|Veronica {{receives}} a short call from Duncan {{just as the}} FBI agents track Duncan’s location. Veronica goes into an abandoned apartment, where she meets Duncan. <b>It</b> <b>turns</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> set of events that seemed to point towards Duncan having stolen the baby were a scam so that Veronica and Duncan could successfully smuggle Duncan and the baby to Mexico together. Sheriff Lamb learns this fact just as Keith finds diapers in the apartment. A reporter contacts Wallace. Sheriff Lamb goes down to Mexico and asks around for Duncan Kane. Keith confronts Veronica about her actions regarding the baby, angry that she used him and tells her he'll {{never be able to}} fully trust her again. The FBI agents search Veronica’s apartment, but Keith has removed the diapers and continues to claim he doesn't know anything. Weevil learns that Felix was dating Molly Fitzpatrick. Sheriff Lamb continues his search before finding his trunk unloaded. Duncan, disguised as a hitchhiker, gets picked up by Vinnie Van Lowe and Astrid (Celeste’s assistant), and they drive off into the distance.|$|E

25|$|<b>It</b> <b>turns</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{phases of}} the twin beams are quantum {{correlated}} as well, leading to entanglement, theoretically predicted in 1988. Below threshold, entanglement was measured {{for the first time}} in 1992, and in 2005 above threshold.|$|E
25|$|The {{key idea}} is the {{transition}} from adding finitely many differences of approximation points multiplied by their respective function values to using infinitely many fine, or infinitesimal steps. When this transition is completed in the above example, <b>it</b> <b>turns</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> area under the curve within the stated bounds is 2/3.|$|E

25|$|The {{computation}} {{rules are}} as usual except that infinitesimals of second order are routinely dropped. With these rules, these matrices do not satisfy {{all the same}} properties as ordinary finite rotation matrices under the usual treatment of infinitesimals. <b>It</b> <b>turns</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> order in which infinitesimal rotations are applied is irrelevant. To see this exemplified, consult infinitesimal rotations SO(3).|$|E
25|$|The fine-structure {{constant}} is {{the coupling}} constant of quantum electrodynamics (QED) determining {{the strength of}} the interaction between electrons and photons. <b>It</b> <b>turns</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> fine structure constant is not really a constant at all owing to the zero-point energy fluctuations of the electron-positron field. The quantum fluctuations caused by zero-point energy have the effect of screening electric charges: owing to (virtual) electron-positron pair production, the charge of the particle measured far from the particle is far smaller than the charge measured when close to it.|$|E
25|$|<b>It</b> <b>turns</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> minimal entropy of {{a closed}} surface {{can be related}} to its optimal {{systolic}} ratio. Namely, there is an upper bound for the entropy of a systolically extremal surface, in terms of its systole. By combining this upper bound with Katok's optimal lower bound in terms of the volume, one obtains a simpler alternative proof of Gromov's asymptotic estimate for the optimal systolic ratio of surfaces of large genus. Furthermore, such an approach yields an improved multiplicative constant in Gromov's theorem.|$|E

25|$|Williams's {{objection}} {{has turned}} out to be valid: Modern studies of demography in natural environments demonstrate that senescence does indeed make a substantial contribution to the death rate in nature. These observations cast doubt on Medawar's theory. Another problem with Medawar's theory became apparent in the late 1990s, when genomic analysis became widely available. <b>It</b> <b>turns</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> genes that cause ageing are not random mutations; rather, these genes form tight-knit families that have been around as long as eukaryotic life. Baker's yeast, worms, fruit flies, and mice all share some of the same ageing genes.|$|E
25|$|After Zelena {{gives the}} groundsman her broken wand to repair, the orderly, Poole, finds him and takes Zelena's wand, then pours a blue potion {{down his throat}} which turns him into the warden himself. <b>It</b> <b>turns</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> groundsman is {{actually}} Dr. Jekyll, and the warden is Mr. Hyde. He creates a portal using the wand, and pulls Pandora's Box from New York City, thus throwing a wrench into Gold's plans to free Belle from the sleeping curse. Hyde plans to blackmail Gold to cooperate with him if he ever wants to see Belle again.|$|E

After clearing out the Meanies in the asylum, they find Higginbotham. Eve proposes that they should {{get rid of the}} infection by shrinking Sackboy and sending him into Higginbotham's head. Even after clearing the infection, Higginbotham still appears to be insane. Upon their return to Avalonia, Higginbotham repairs Huge Spaceship, but as they are about to leave, Avalon decides to make a speech, and is abducted by the Negativitron.|$|E
