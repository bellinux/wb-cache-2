40|$|The {{reactivity}} of the biobased chemical levulinic acid with dimethylcarbonate as a solvent/reagent under basic conditions is here described. The reaction yields methyl levulinate and dimethyl succinate, along with products {{that derive from}} methylation of the aliphatic chain and the <b>dimethylketal</b> of methyl levulinate. A degree of control over selectivity {{can be achieved by}} tuning the reaction conditions...|$|E
40|$|International audienceFour novel {{alkaloids}} of the aaptamine class {{have been}} isolated {{in addition to}} the known aaptamine, isoaaptamine, demethyl(oxy) aaptamine and its <b>dimethylketal</b> from an unidentified species of Indonesian marine sponge of the genus Xestospongia. Their structures were elucidated on the basis of detailed 1 D and 2 D NMR spectroscopic data. Their antimicrobial activity was tested towards Gram (+) (S. aureus), Gram (âˆ’) (E. coli, V. anguillarum) bacterial strains, a fungus (C. tropicalis); their cytotoxic activity was evaluated against KB cells...|$|E
40|$|The <b>dimethylketals</b> of poly(vinyl alcohol), termed polyvinylacetone (PVKA), of {{moderate}} ketalization {{degree in the}} range from 0. 28 to 0. 6 exhibited temperature-induced phase transition in aqueous solution, as revealed by cloud point measurements and electron micrographs, which was then further investigated on molecular level using solution-state H- 1 NMR measurements. The present phase transition is caused by the amphiphilic characteristics in the polymer chain. Moreover, this finding could be further applied as a novel strategy in the syntheses of thermosensitive polymer by the hydrophobic functionalities of linear polyol. (c) 2006 Elsevier B. V.
