2500|$|In 1846 Konstantin's sister, Grand Duchess Olga, married Crown Prince Charles of Württemberg. He {{went with}} her to Stuttgart then he {{continued}} to Altenburg to be introduced to Princess Alexandra of Saxe-Altenburg. His parents had arranged the meeting thinking that Alexandra might make a good match for Konstantin. Alexandra was strikingly beautiful, tall and slim and Konstantin was immediately eager to marry her. [...] "I don't know {{what is happening to}} me. It is as if I am a completely new person. Just one thought moves me, just one image fills my eyes: forever and only she, my angel, my universe. <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> I’m in love. However, what can it mean? I've only known her a few hours and I'm already up to my ears in Passion".|$|E
2500|$|On September 2, Gun Runner {{made his}} next {{start in the}} Woodward Stakes at Saratoga, going off as the {{prohibitive}} favorite {{in a field of}} five. Trainer Todd Pletcher entered two horses, with Neolithic assigned to set a fast early pace in the hopes of tiring Gun Runner, while Rally Cry was intended to close from behind. The race went much as expected, with Gun Runner stalking Neolithic for the first 6 furlongs before swinging to the lead on the far turn. Gun Runner maintained his momentum and eventually won by [...] lengths over the late-closing Rally Cry. His time of 1:47.43 was the fastest Woodward Stakes since the race was moved to Saratoga in 2006 and earned Gun Runner a career high Beyer Speed Figure of 115. He was also given a Timeform US rating of 142, the highest Timeform US rating ever achieved. [...] "That was better than the Whitney, just stronger, faster overall," [...] said Geroux. [...] "I don't think he's 100-percent cranked up yet. <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> we have another step forward with him. We're going to need one against Arrogate." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> {{that he has}} {{uncommon}} bad taste," [...] said Lucy, with {{a reality}} in her voice differing much from the tone of banter she had hitherto used.|$|E
6000|$|... "George: I'm {{astonished}} at you. I have not much opinion of parsons as a rule; but <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>did</b> <b>think</b> {{that you were}} to be depended on." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{know all}} about it," [...] she added, aloud. [...] "It is not 'the devil,' as you call it, but the very natural desire of all young people for liberty. I used to feel just so, and once, <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>did</b> <b>think</b> {{for a minute that}} I would bolt." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. St. Clare is a {{singular}} man," [...] said Marie to Miss Ophelia, in a complaining tone. [...] "I used to think, {{if there was}} anything in the world he did love, it was our dear little Eva; but he seems to be forgetting her very easily. I cannot ever get him to talk about her. <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>did</b> <b>think</b> he would show more feeling!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Alexandrina {{has told}} me all about it," [...] said the countess, with her sweetest smile, [...] "and I have given her my approval. <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> you will suit each other very well." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Margaret Burton, {{one of the}} Junior {{girls at}} Redmond, wrote a story last winter and it was {{published}} in the Canadian Woman. <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> I could write one at least as good." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Are you? I don't {{know that}} I have shown any very strong preference. I am not {{disposed}} to praise myself for many things, but <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> that I {{have been as}} undemonstrative as most men of my age." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I s'pose {{that sounds}} sing'lar to you young things; but, you see, though me and Enos was engaged at twenty or so, we warn't married till two year ago. Things was dreadful con'try, and we kep a waitin' and a waitin', till I declare for't <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>did</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> should die an old maid." [...] And she laughed again, {{as if her}} escape was the best joke in the world.|$|R
5000|$|In 2002, {{the tour}} {{documentary}} And All That Could Have Been was released featuring performances from the Fragility 2.0 tour. While making the DVD, Reznor {{commented on the}} tour in retrospect by saying [...] "I thought the show was really, really good when we were doing it", but later wrote that [...] "I cant watch it at all. I was sick for most of that tour and <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>dont</b> <b>think</b> it was Nine Inch Nails at its best." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know: {{in one way}} he may be, but not in another. <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>do</b> not <b>think</b> <b>I</b> can {{sit down}} to table with Doctor Thorne." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> {{that that}} is a fine idea--a splendid idea! The only {{drawback}} is, that in order to carry it out we should want a lot of strong cartridge-paper, and we have no paper except our note-books." ...|$|E
6000|$|Cecilia has {{not been}} unobservant, in her own quiet way, {{of what has been}} going on. Waiting until Francine and Miss Plym are out of hearing, she bends over Emily, and says, [...] "My dear, <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> Francine is in love with Mr. Mirabel." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "John, <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> you are selfish; {{you don't}} {{seem to have}} any {{consideration}} for me at all. It's going to make it so disagreeable and uncomfortable for me. The Follingsbees are accustomed to wine every day. I'm perfectly ashamed not to give it to them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Did <b>I?</b> Did <b>I</b> <b>really?</b> <b>Do</b> you <b>think</b> <b>I</b> tempted {{you to do}} it? Then I must be wicked, whether I knew I {{was doing}} it or not. Yes." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Really, Lady Ongar, I think not. When your ladyship {{returned}} {{there was}} some opposition thought of for a while, but <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>do</b> not <b>think</b> it was their fault." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am at a loss," [...] he said, [...] "to {{account for}} your {{somewhat}} melodramatic tone, but <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>do</b> not <b>think</b> that Miss Beverley has {{very much to}} fear." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{wish to be}} rude, but <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> you are vain of {{your good}} looks, elegant accomplishments, and the {{impression}} you make wherever you go. When it's worth while, you exert yourself, and are altogether fascinating; but the 'I come-see-and-conquer' air you put on spoils it all for sensible people." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, Barb'ry Aleshine," [...] said Mrs. Lecks, [...] "if you're thinkin' of shovelin' {{your way}} {{from this place}} to where your cows is, you'd better step right out and get at it, and <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> that if you felt they were sufferin' for want of milkin' you'd make a start." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We can't {{walk the}} deck, ma'am. We has to {{scramble}} along {{the best way}} we can, holdin' on by hands and teeth and eyelids. Thank 'ee, miss, but <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> I'd better not try to eat any more. I feels chock-full already, an' it might be dangerous. There's severe laws now against overloadin', you know." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have done}} something," [...] she answered, modestly, [...] "but <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>do</b> not <b>think</b> {{that they are}} worth producing. It is very {{tiresome}} of you to have remembered about them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of {{course we}} shall be cautious," [...] the captain replied; [...] "but <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>do</b> not <b>think</b> that you and the others need bother yourselves to be always {{standing}} on sentry." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Saxton," [...] {{she said}} quietly, [...] "is an utterly unprincipled man. <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>do</b> not <b>think</b> {{we have many}} like him in this country. You {{probably}} mistook his reference to Mr. Brooke." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "His conduct to Mr. Bonteen {{has been}} outrageous; {{and if he}} has done it just because that Duchess of Omnium has told him, <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> {{that he is not}} fit to rule the nation. As for Mr. Phineas Finn, it is dreadful to think that a {{creature}} like that should be able to interfere with such a man as Mr. Bonteen." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, Jeff," [...] he said, {{turning away}} slowly, with a sigh, and limping {{back to his}} couch, [...] "there's room for improvement. I thought myself not a bad-looking fellow once. It's no great matter to have that fancy taken out of me, perhaps, but I grieve for Bella, and <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> that you must persuade her to give up all idea of--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am quite}} easy, for <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> that Alec {{will improve the}} child's health; {{and by the time}} his year is out, it will be quite soon enough for her to go to Madame Roccabella's and be {{finished}} off," [...] said Aunt Clara, settling her rings, and thinking, with languid satisfaction, of the time when she could bring out a pretty and accomplished niece.|$|E
60|$|MRS. JUNO [thoughtfully] I don't {{know what}} to say. I must think over it. I have always been rather severe on this sort of thing; {{but when it came}} to the point I didn't behave as I thought I should behave. I didn't intend to be wicked; but somehow or other, Nature, or {{whatever}} you choose to call it, didn't take much notice of my intentions. [Gregory instinctively seeks her hand and presses it]. And <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>did</b> <b>think,</b> Tops, that <b>I</b> was the only woman in the world for you.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh! My {{father would}} have been very glad to see you; but we really are dull kind of people, not at all in your way, and <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>do</b> not <b>think</b> that you lost much amusement.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{believe that}} you are a wizard, Mr. Holmes. <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>do</b> {{sometimes}} <b>think</b> that you have powers that are not human. Now, how on earth could you know that the stolen silver was at the bottom of that pond?" ...|$|R
60|$|I have {{drafted the}} first part of Chapter VI., Fleeming and his friends, his {{influence}} on me, his views on religion and literature, his part at the Savile; it should boil down to about ten pages, and <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> it admirably good. It has so much evoked Fleeming for myself that I found my conscience stirred just {{as it used to be}} after a serious talk with him: surely that means it is good? I had to write and tell you, being alone.|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear Mrs Loper," [...] said Mrs Twitter over {{a cup of}} tea, [...] "it is {{very kind}} of you to say so, and <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> you are right, we have done full justice to our dear wee Mita. Who would ever have thought, remembering the thin starved sickly child she was the night that Sam brought her in, that she would come to be such a plump, rosy, lovely child? I declare to you that I feel as if she were one of my own." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not it," [...] Adolphe {{answered}} confidently. [...] "Why, {{from the}} shore it will look awash with the water. No one will ever dream {{that there could be}} a soul alive underneath it. I begin to think you will do it, monsieur. At first it seemed hopeless. Now <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> there is a chance. I should feel pretty confident if it was you and two of us who had to do it; but the difficulty will be to get the young ladies under it, and then to get them to lie quiet there." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This is {{all very}} well," [...] she said, [...] "but I quite {{understand}} that it is my last morning. I know what will happen this afternoon, and <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>do</b> not <b>think</b> that <b>I</b> shall allow you to come past that gate." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I didn't {{think it}} was quite so late, father; the Piazza is crowded. <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>do</b> not <b>think</b> there is one person in Venice who goes to bed so early as we do. It is so {{pleasant}} in the moonlight after {{the heat of the}} day." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will try}} not to be a weight on you," [...] {{answered}} the young girl, with a sweet mixture of resolution and humility. [...] "It would be the greatest possible privilege. <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>do</b> not <b>think</b> <b>I</b> am a fine lady ingrain, and you will teach me not to be too unworthy." ...|$|R
