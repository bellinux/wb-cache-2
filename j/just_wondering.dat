As {{they began to}} read, the duo noticed {{that it had a}} {{tendency}} to take [...] "readers on a lot of side trips"—"from detailed explanations of surveillance techniques to angry attacks on corrupt Swedish industrialists," [...] professed The Hollywood Reporter Gregg Kilday. Fincher recalled of the encounter: [...] "The ballistic, ripping-yarn thriller aspect of it is kind of a red herring in a weird way. It is the thing that throws Salander and Blomkvist together, but it is their relationship you keep coming back to. I was <b>just</b> <b>wondering</b> what 350 pages Zaillian would get rid of." [...] Because Zaillian was already cultivating the screenplay, the director avoided interfering. After a conversation, Fincher was comfortable [...] "they were headed in the same direction".|$|E
2500|$|After {{extensive}} touring {{in support}} of the band's third studio album, Veckatimest (2009), Grizzly Bear undertook a six-month hiatus from band-related activities. Vocalist Ed Droste noted, [...] "There was such a level of exhaustion that I really needed to pretend I wasn't in the band for a little bit. I needed to be back in my life with my friends and my spouse, and live a day-to-day existence {{that had nothing to do}} with music. That was really good for everybody." [...] Vocalist and guitarist Daniel Rossen stated, [...] "Those were strange times. [...] I felt a little bit shell-shocked by the touring experience of Veckatimest and part of me was <b>just</b> <b>wondering</b> if there was some other version of a life that I could have that wasn't as heavily involved in the music industry." ...|$|E
2500|$|Reverend Raymond Guterman of the Northwood Presbyterian Church in Clearwater, Florida, gave {{a sermon}} in 2001 titled: [...] "Why Scientology Isn't a Church". [...] "I'm not anti-Scientology; I'm not pro-Scientology. I just don't exactly {{understand}} individually why it's called the Church of Scientology and why {{there would be}} a cross, even if it's a different cross. When I see the cross, I think of Christ. If Christ is not the center of Scientology, then why would an organization use the cross and call itself a church? I'm <b>just</b> <b>wondering,</b> but I don't really plan to say any of that Sunday," [...] said Reverend Guterman. He explained that in his view Scientology was not a [...] "church" [...] because it did not follow the words of Jesus Christ and accept him as savior, and for this reason said [...] "in my opinion, it's not a church." [...] Scientology representative Pat Harney contacted Reverend Guterman, and told the St. Petersburg Times she thought he was using Scientology in order to generate interest. [...] "There's a definition of 'church' in the dictionary. It's called a congregation. There's a definition of the word 'church' that applies. I understand his Christian perspective. In truth, the derivation of the word 'church' predates Christianity," [...] said Harney. The St. Petersburg Times noted Reverend Guterman's public discussion of Scientology in such a manner was [...] "virtually unheard of" [...] in Clearwater, Florida, due to the large presence of Scientology in the area.|$|E

2500|$|The {{following}} is a transcript provided by [...] from a [...] in which John Mueller of Google speaks about the Title tag {{and its relation to}} SEO:DANIEL PICKEN: I had a quick question. And John, it was about something you said a few weeks ago, actually. You said the title tag is a ranking signal, but you said that you use a part of the title tag. And that's really stuck with me. And I was <b>just</b> <b>wondering</b> what you meant by that, when you say you use a part of the title tag as a ranking signal.JOHN MUELLER: We use that just as a part. I think it's not like the primary ranking factor of a page, to put it that way.DANIEL PICKEN: Right.JOHN MUELLER: We do use it for ranking, but it's not the most critical part of a page. So it's not worthwhile filling it with keywords to kind of hope that it works that way. In general, we try to recognize when a title tag is stuffed with keywords because that's also a bad user experience for users in the search results. If they're looking to understand what these pages are about and they just see a jumble of keywords, then that doesn't really help.Moz has already been cited as assigning critical importance to the Title tags. However, they have the following to say about the Meta description:... it's important to note that meta descriptions do not directly influence Google's ranking algorithms for normal web search. Help says pretty much the same things, as does Matt Cutts, in one of this [...]|$|E
