She {{played the role}} of a disturbed teenager and called it an [...] "exhausting" [...] experience, saying that she felt drained while trying to, [...] "get into a psyche of someone who <b>does</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> drugs and booze, has lost her mind a little bit and is very vulnerable".

500|$|In {{the season}} ten premiere, the {{audience}} got its {{first glimpse of}} the traditional Superman costume, which was left for Clark by Martha in the season nine finale. Although the suit was briefly seen through a reflection in Clark's eyes in the season nine finale, the suit that appeared in the season ten premiere was a different design. The producers, working alongside Warner Bros. and DC Comics, procured the costume worn by Brandon Routh in Superman Returns, which the team chose over the Christopher Reeve suit of the 1980s. DC Comics offered the suit worn by Reeve, but Peterson explained that it [...] "... just didn't quite fit with our world." [...] According to producer Kelly Souders, [...] "Well, the process was really a group effort. We worked with DC, and we have Alicia Louis, who <b>does</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> stuff for us at the studio, and who was really instrumental. It took quite a bit to get that costume. There's a lot of sign-offs, it really was Warner Bros. and DC and us working to make it happen." [...] Peterson stated that the costume plays a more prominent role in the final season, with the last scene of Smallville ending with Clark wearing it. Before then, Clark began wearing a new costume in the season ten episode [...] "Shield". Here, Clark replaced the black trenchoat with a red leather jacket, and the [...] "S" [...] shield now embossed onto the chest of that jacket.|$|E
500|$|Reviewing the premiere, Terri Schwartz of IGN {{praised the}} {{introduction}} of Ghost Rider and subsequent darker tone which [...] "will eventually allow [...] to sit more comfortably beside its corporate cousins over on Netflix", but did feel {{that there were some}} [...] "growing pains" [...] with the transition to more mature material. The A.V.

Kevin Fitzpatrick of Screen Crush said, [...] "I’m nervous for Season 4 overall, especially if said reinvention doesn’t goose the ratings like Marvel and ABC hope, but “The Ghost” is reason enough for some casual optimism." [...] He was positive about the new similarities to the darker series Daredevil, but felt that the series [...] "doesn’t have the firmest handle" [...] on Ghost Rider yet. Evan Valentine, writing for Collider.com, said that the series [...] "certainly benefits somewhat from taking a page from" [...] the Marvel Netflix series, highlighting the number of more mature elements in the episode's opening as [...] "a nice introduction that shows you this may not exactly be the same show you’ve gotten to know over the years." ...|$|E

Pitting other people against each other, being quite mischievous... That was something I thought would obviously be good to do." [...] Foy researched witchcraft and demonic possession for the role.

2500|$|One of {{the most}} often criticised points of C++ is its {{enormous}} complexity as a language, {{the large number of}} non-orthogonal features. This in practice necessitates restricting code to subset of C++, thus eschewing the readability benefits of common style and idioms. As expressed by Joshua Bloch: [...] I think C++ was pushed well beyond its complexity threshold and yet {{there are a lot of}} people programming it. But what you do is you force people to subset it. So almost every shop that I know of that uses C++ says, “Yes, we’re using C++ but we’re not doing multiple-implementation inheritance and we’re not using operator overloading.” There are just a bunch of features that you’re not going to use because the complexity of the resulting code is too high. And I don’t think it’s good when you have to start doing that. You lose this programmer portability where everyone can read everyone else’s code, which I think is such a good thing. [...] Ken Thompson comments on how that came to be: [...] It certainly has its good points. But by and large I think it’s a bad language. It <b>does</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> things half well and it’s just a garbage heap of ideas that are mutually exclusive. Everybody I know, whether it’s personal or corporate, selects a subset and these subsets are different. So it’s not a good language to transport an algorithm—to say, “I wrote it; here, take it.” It’s way too big, way too complex. And it’s obviously built by a committee.|$|E

One of my road crew said {{we found this}} guy that {{used to work in}} the circus and he <b>does</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> things for TV and special effects and he's made {{something}} that might interest you, it's a piano that spins round, and I immediately responded, oh that sounds interesting. I happened to be within the New York area and I was driven over to Long Island to a guy called Bob McCarthy, and there in the background he had this piano situated. So he called his wife down from upstairs and said, darling could you demonstrate this for Keith? I looked on, I wasn't quite sure what to expect. His wife comes down and sits on the seat and up she goes in the air and proceeds to spin around. I thought, well that's great! Then Bob asked me, {{do you want to have}} a go at it?... Yea, okay. You need to understand, below the keyboard there's an inverted-tee, like a bar. You wrap your legs around the down pipe and put your heels under the inverted-tee. Then you go up in the air and try and do your best to play. It was a little difficult to play at first because of the centrifugal force, so it wasn't easy. I think we actually used it for the first time at Madison Square Garden, it was a Christmas concert. People in the audience were so astounded they couldn't quite believe what they were seeing. Later on that coming year the California Jam came up and I said we have to do that there. Bob drove the whole contraption down to the California Jam and there was very little space to set it up. There were loads of bands up on that stage, all having to do their set and then getting their equipment off. Now, with the moog, the Hammonds, Carl's gongs and everything, it was hard enough to just get that off stage. We had the spinning piano and everything that went along with it and we tried to find a place to situate it. It ended up going just at the end of the stage, so when the piano went up it was literally over the heads of the audience. After that every TV show I did came the question... Keith, how do you spin around on that piano? I'd say what about my music? When I had the honor of meeting the great jazz pianist Dave Brubeck just before he died, he said, Keith you've got to tell me how do you spin around on that piano? Dave Brubeck was 90 years old then and I said, 'Dave, don't try it!'" ...|$|E
