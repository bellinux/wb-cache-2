25|$|The {{methods of}} {{clearing}} differ between the half mask, which covers {{the eyes and}} nose, and the full-face mask, which also covers the mouth. If the mask has a purge valve and the strap tension is correct, the diver holds the head so that the valve is at the lowest point and exhales through the nose. If the mask is a good fit on the diver's face and the strap is correctly placed, exhaling through the nose will usually drive water out along the bottom edge of the skirt. It {{may be necessary to}} press {{the upper part of the}} mask against the face to improve the seal if the diver is rolled to one side. If the fit <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>perfect,</b> or the strap is too low, contact pressure of the top edge against the forehead may be insufficient to maintain a seal when the head is upright.|$|E

[...] and [...] "No I'm not an angel, but at least I'm trying". In [...] "No Angel", Beyoncé {{declares}} that her partner is [...] "no angel either", remarking that he <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>perfect.</b> However, despite his imperfections, the protagonist admits she still loves him. Beyoncé sings the lines [...] "nderneath the pretty face is something complicated / I come with a side of trouble / But I know that's why you're staying" [...] in the song aimed to inform her [...] "roguish" [...] male lover. The lines of the chorus are sung by Beyoncé with pronouncing one word {{at a time in}} longer intervals. A short interlude about [...] "mov things to the bedroom" [...] is interpolated in the song. Beyoncé forgoes lyrical subtlety during that part, singing explicit lines such as [...] "Tell me do you wanna ride?" [...] and [...] "First both of my legs go back on your head, and whatever you want, yeah baby, I'm bad". Fuse's Mark Sundstrom interpreted the song's message as talking about the singer's husband Jay-Z and added [...] "She loves him more because she knows him entirely, accepting he's not perfect or without a past". Complex editor Claire Lobenfeld considered its lyrical content to be about how a [...] "couple's respective internal messiness can bring them closer together".|$|E

Wanting Belle to be significantly different and more European in appearance than Ariel, the animators drew her with fuller lips, narrower eyes and darker eyebrows, which were inspired by the facial features of British actresses Vivien Leigh and Audrey Hepburn. More statuesque than most Disney princesses, Belle's appearance was inspired by that of American actress Jennie Garth. The animators also used photographs of Hollywood actresses Natalie Wood, Elizabeth Taylor and Grace Kelly for reference. Baxter studied the art of French impressionist Edgar Degas, a painter known for his portraits of ballerinas, whose work inspired the animator to incorporate [...] "graceful, swan-like movements" [...] into Belle's performance.|$|E

Drowned in Sound's Gen Williams described the album as [...] "mature and expansive" [...] and wrote that [...] "the autonomy, creativity and sheer, elastic beauty that spans this debut more than justifies the rapidly accelerating hype". Andrew Romano of Newsweek similarly {{noted that it}} [...] "lives up to the hype". Summing the record up as [...] "dance rock, but highly caffeinated", Barry Walters of Rolling Stone explained that the tracks are emotive and rhythmic in equal measure, while Nick Southall of Stylus thought that every song is [...] "full of thrilling ideas and inspired moments". Johnny Davis of Q labelled Silent Alarm [...] "an arty, confident and exhilarating debut", while Joshua Glazer of URB compared Bloc Party to [...] "every legendary band ever who followed an EP with an even better album and on into greatness". The Guardians Alexis Petridis was less receptive and commented that the [...] "reedy vocals and lyrical evocations of suburban ennui... induce a worrying ennui of their own". Heather Phares of Allmusic stated that the record <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>perfect,</b> but praised its [...] "passion and polish".|$|E

500|$|LocoRoco has {{received}} mostly positive reviews from critics. The game was consistently praised for its bright and bold graphics. [...] Charles Herold of the New York Times compared the graphics to Katamari Damacy, calling them [...] "simple" [...] and [...] "pretty" [...] while Sam Kennedy of 1UP considered it akin to [...] "playing out an adorable cartoon". The unique environments of each level were also credited {{to help the}} game's charm, with Kristan Reed of Eurogamer believing that the game presents a [...] "look and feel unlike anything we've seen before" [...] and that shows [...] "a truly brilliant realisation of how to take 2D gaming into uncharted territory." [...] The music of the game {{was considered to be}} [...] "quirky and catchy", with Will Tuttle of GameSpy saying that [...] "there's a good chance that you'll be humming some of the tunes all day". The game, at times, was compared to a [...] "slow-motion version of Sonic the Hedgehog" [...] with the player controlling the LocoRoco as they move up and down hills and through loop-de-loops in the level. This gameplay allows the game to be easily accessible to players, with IGN's Juan Castro noting that the controls are [...] "not simplistic so much as it's refreshingly elegant", and Kennedy commenting that while LocoRoco <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>perfect,</b> it was [...] "perfect for the PSP". As noted by Neil McGreevy of the BBC, LocoRoco [...] "is the best game Nintendo never made." ...|$|E
