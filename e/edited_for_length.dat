500|$|The chase {{scene at}} the end of the game, in which Don pursues Adrienne {{throughout}} the entire mansion, took a full week to film. Homb wore a prosthesis on his face to simulate wounds from Adrienne pouring acid on him. Only one prosthesis was available, and it was in such bad shape by the end of filming that Williams said [...] "we were essentially holding it in place with the proverbial wire and bailing wax". Several scenes in Phantasmagoria involved animals, including a Doberman Pinscher, two cats, a beagle and several rats. Sierra commissioned Dave Macmillian and other Hollywood animal handlers from the company Worldwide Movie Animals to handle the animals. Two cats were required to portray Adrienne's pet Spaz because the cats were temperamental and each would have moments when they would not perform. Some objects were borrowed by a museum operated by the Fresno Flats Historical Society and used as props in the game. The society was thanked in the credits as a result. Ultimately, all of the scenes filmed for Phantasmagoria were used in the final game. Some were <b>edited</b> <b>for</b> <b>length</b> and pacing, but none were cut altogether.|$|E
500|$|The UK and US {{versions}} of the show have the same content for most episodes; however, the latter was sometimes <b>edited</b> <b>for</b> <b>length</b> to allow for more commercial breaks. Content was also sometimes altered; mating scenes in particular were often removed from the US version. Animal Planet US occasionally changed the names of meerkats and episode titles. Two of Flower's pups were renamed from Ren and Stumpy to Len and Squiggy; {{the title of the}} episode was also changed. De la Soul (named for the rap group of the same name), one of the sisters who started the Starsky group, was renamed Whoopi in the US as a tribute to actress Whoopi Goldberg, an early fan of the series. Animal Planet US has also renamed some of Flower's pups born in season three to honour two other famous fans of the show, Elizabeth Taylor and Denis Leary. Several episodes were renamed: the title of the final episode of the second series was changed from [...] "The Killing Fields" [...] to [...] "The Quiet Fields". During the third series, the third episode's title was changed from [...] "Something's Got to Give" [...] to [...] "Sister Act" [...] (another Goldberg reference), while the sixth episode's title changed from [...] "The House of Zappa" [...] to [...] "Sibling Rivalry".|$|E

500|$|When Harrison came to Washington, {{he wanted}} to show both that he was still the steadfast hero of Tippecanoe, and that he was a better educated and {{thoughtful}} man than the backwoods caricature portrayed in the campaign. He took the oath of office on Thursday, March 4, 1841, a cold and wet day. He wore neither an overcoat nor hat, rode on horseback to the ceremony rather than in the closed carriage that had been offered him, and delivered the longest inaugural address in American history. At 8,445 words, it took him nearly two hours to read, although his friend and fellow Whig Daniel Webster had <b>edited</b> it <b>for</b> <b>length.</b> After becoming the first head of state to have his photograph taken, Harrison then rode through the streets in the inaugural parade, and that evening attended three inaugural balls, including one at Carusi's Saloon entitled the [...] "Tippecanoe" [...] ball, which at a price of US$10 per person (equal to $ today) attracted 1,000 guests.|$|R

40|$|In this two part {{article we}} reflect upon the {{experience}} of writing-dancing with audiences and artists {{in the context of}} our installation work skript (commissioned by Dance 4, Nottingham, 2013). Part one considers how skript engages embodied, felt sense, improvisational and collaborative modalities in relation to the act of writing. As such we consider {{the ways in which the}} particular interface of language and embodiment, which is the focus of skript, might allow a knowing of ‘something’ otherwise – be that something a sense of our own bodies, a dance work, a performance experience or perhaps just that moment in time. In part two we share extracts of some of the writings that were collaboratively generated as part of skript. We focus on the work of three performance/movement artists: Guy Dartnell, Miguel Pereira and Rosalind Crisp. These dance-writings are published as they were written in real time, in the moment of engagement. They are <b>edited</b> only <b>for</b> <b>length</b> and at times to correct typographical errors (but only if the errors seemed to disturb the flow of the ideas) rather than to simply ‘tidy’ the text or the grammar. The writings are relational, improvisational and at times fragmentary. For more writings see: www. writing-dancing. blogspot. com...|$|R
40|$|A Chinese news {{summarization}} {{method is}} proposed {{in order to}} help humans deal with the message services of news briefs broadcast over cell phones. The problem to be solved here is unique because a strict length limit (69 or 45 characters) is imposed on the summaries for the message service. This requires some sort of automatic sentence fusion, rather than sentence selection alone. In the proposed method, important sentences were first identified based on the news content. They were matched against the news headline to determine a suitable position for concatenation with the headline to become candidates. These candidates were then ranked by their <b>length</b> and fitness <b>for</b> manual selection. In our evaluation, among 40 short news updates in the inside testing set, over 75 % (80 %) of the best candidates yield acceptable summaries without manual <b>editing</b> <b>for</b> the <b>length</b> limit of 69 (45) characters. These numbers, however, reduce to 70. 7 % (53. 3 %) for the outside testing set of 75 news stories of ordinary length. It seems that the shorter the length limit, the more difficult the problem of getting the summary from long stories. Nevertheless, the proposed method has the potential not only to reduce the cost of manual operation, but also to integrate and synchronize with other media in such services in the future...|$|R
50|$|In early repeats of {{the opening}} special, Rufus' dream {{sequence}} set to 'Better Than A Dream' was edited out, due to timing restrictions on TV <b>for</b> standard <b>length</b> episodes.

50|$|The horse {{training}} methods {{shown are}} not entirely without controversy. While Brannaman was the on-site technical consultant, {{he did not have}} creative control. The constraints of film-making required a number of sequences to be <b>edited</b> <b>for</b> <b>length,</b> thus not showing some critical training elements that would normally be used. A few basic safety problems in the film include Redford kneeling in front of a horse known to charge humans in one scene, and wearing a large ring on his finger while training in another, a risky practice in the real world when simultaneously handling a dangerous horse and a rope.|$|E
5000|$|The soundtrack album, {{consisting}} of 43 {{minutes of the}} film's score, was released with Klaus Badelt credited as the composer. The cues were <b>edited</b> <b>for</b> <b>length,</b> and {{minor changes to the}} mix were also made. For unknown reasons, the mixing of several cues are executed with gain levels so high that it causes distortion. This is noticeable particularly during the action cues and the reprise of the love theme in track 14, [...] "One Last Shot". It is also noted that besides the first two cues, the tracks' generic names were unrelated to their contents. According to the official website of composer Geoff Zanelli, this was because the production [...] "schedule was so short that they had to decide on the track names for the album packaging before the score was even written!" ...|$|E
