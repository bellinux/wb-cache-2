40|$|A four week {{testing program}} was {{completed}} during this project {{to assess the}} ability of the combination of <b>deep</b> <b>staging,</b> Rich Reagent Injection (RRI), and Selective Non-Catalytic Reduction (SNCR) to reduce NOx emissions below 0. 15 lb/MBtu in a cyclone fired boiler. The host site for the tests was AmerenUE's Sioux Unit 1, a 500 MW cyclone fired boiler located near St. Louis, MO. Reaction Engineering International (REI) led the project team including AmerenUE, FuelTech Inc., and the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI). This layered approach to NOx reduction is termed the Advanced Layered Technology Approach (ALTA). Installed RRI and SNCR port locations were guided by computational fluid dynamics (CFD) based modeling conducted by REI. During the parametric testing, NOx emissions of 0. 12 lb/MBtu were achieved consistently from overfire air (OFA) -only baseline NOx emissions of 0. 25 lb/MBtu or less, when firing the typical 80 / 20 fuel blend of Powder River Basin (PRB) and Illinois No. 6 coals. From OFA-only baseline levels of 0. 20 lb/MBtu, NOx emissions of 0. 12 lb/MBtu were also achieved, but at significantly reduced urea flow rates. Under the deeply staged conditions that were tested, RRI performance was observed to degrade as higher blends of Illinois No. 6 were used. NOx emissions achieved with ALTA while firing a 60 / 40 blend were approximately 0. 15 lb/MBtu. NOx emissions while firing 100 % Illinois No. 6 were approximately 0. 165 lb/MBtu. Based on the performance results of these tests, economics analyses of the application of ALTA to a nominal 500 MW cyclone unit show that the levelized cost to achieve 0. 15 lb/MBtu is well below 75 % of the cost of a state of the art SCR...|$|E

40|$|The Pobei mafic-ultramafic {{complex in}} northwestern China {{comprises}} magmatic Cu-Ni sulfide ore deposits coexisting with Fe-Ti oxide deposits. The Poshi, Poyi, and Podong ultramafic intrusions host the Cu-Ni ore. The ultramafic intrusions experienced four stages during its formation. The intrusion sequence was as follows: dunite, hornblende-peridotite, wehrlite and pyroxenite. The wall rock of the ultramafic intrusions is the gabbro intrusion {{in the southwestern}} of the Pobei complex. The Xiaochangshan magmatic deposit outcrops in the magnetitemineralized gabbro in the northeastern part of the Pobei complex. The main emplacement events related to the mineralization in the Pobei complex, are the magnetite-mineralized gabbro related to the Xiaochangshan Fe deposit, the gabbro intrusion associated to the Poyi, Poshi and Podong Cu-Ni deposits, and the ultramafic intrusions that host Cu-Ni deposits (Poyi and Poshi). The U-Pb age of the magnetite-mineralized gabbro is 276 ± 1. 7 Ma, {{which is similar to}} that of the Pobei mafic intrusions. The εHf(t) value of zircon in the magnetite-mineralized gabbro is almost the same as that of the gabbro around the Poyi and Poshi Cu-Ni deposits, indicating that the rocks related to Cu-Ni and magnetite deposits probably originated from the same parental magma. There is a trend of crystallization differentiation evolution in the Harker diagram from the dunite in the Cu-Ni deposit to the magnetite-mineralized gabbro. The monosulfide solid solution fractional crystallization was weak in Pobei; thus, the Pd/Ir values were only influenced by the crystallization of silicate minerals. The more complete the magma evolution is, the greater is the Pd/Ir ratio. The Pd/Ir values of dunite, the lithofacies containing sulfide (including hornblende peridotite, wehrlite, and pyroxenite) in the Poyi Cu-Ni deposit, magnetite-mineralized gabbro, and massive magnetite, are 8. 55, 12. 18, 12. 26, and 18. 14, respectively. Thus, the massive magnetite was probably the latest product in the evolution of the Pobei mafic-ultramafic intrusions. We infer that the Cu-Ni sulfide and Fe-Ti oxide ores in the Pobei area were products of a cogenetic magma at different evolutionary stages; at the late stage, the magma became iron enriched through crystallization differentiation. The magma differentiation occurred in a <b>deep</b> <b>staging</b> magma chamber emplaced in the upper magma chamber. Earlier crystallized olivine with some interstitial sulfides gathered at the bottom of the staging magma chamber because of its greater density. That is to say, the ultramafic magma hosting the Cu-Ni sulfide formed at the bottom of the staging magma chamber, while the magnetite-mineralized gabbro was in the upper part. However, the magnetite-mineralized gabbro injected into the upper magma chamber first and the ultramafic lithofacies containing the olivine and the interstitial Cu-Ni sulfides were subsequently emplaced in the upper magma chamber as crystal mush...|$|E
40|$|The Platreef is {{a highly}} complex, pyroxenite-hosted Ni-Cu-PGE deposit. It {{is located at the}} base of the {{northern}} limb of the Bushveld Complex, South Africa, in direct contact with a variety of country rock sediments and Archaean basement. The interaction of the Platreef magma with these diverse country rock lithologies during emplacement had a profound effect on the style and distribution of the mineralization on both regional and local scales. Geometrically, the Platreef was emplaced as a thin, sill-like intrusion, with pre-formed PGE- rich sulfide droplets entrained within the magma. Sulfur saturation is likely to have occurred in a <b>deep</b> <b>staging</b> chamber or conduit prior to emplacement, and where immiscible sulfide droplets became enriched in PGE, base metals and semi metals. After emplacement, the PGE and semi-metal rich sulfide liquid cooled to form 'primary' assemblages of IPGE-rich pyrrhotite, IPGE-, Rh- and Pd-rich pentlandite, chalcopyrite, Pt and Pd tellurides and bismuthides and electrum within the feldspathic pyroxenites of the Platreef. Assimilation and metamorphism of some sedimentary footwall rocks, particularly the dolomites of the Malmani Subgroup, released large volumes of volatiles into the Platreef magma. This hydrothermal activity redistributed PGE and base metal sulfides (BMS) into the footwall rocks, and in places overprinted the 'primary' assemblages, and occasionally decoupled PGE from BMS, with the petrology of the reef and footwall, and the mineralogy of the platinum-group minerals, significantly affected. Each locality along the strike of the Platreef with a different footwall lithology has its own unique hydrothermal history directly related to the nature of the local floor rocks. For example, where the floor is composed of anhydrous basement gneiss, volatile activity was relatively insignificant, and partial melting of the floor allowed the percolation of PGE-rich sulfide liquid to penetrate the footwall. The nature of the floor rocks also controls the type and amount of contamination in the Platreef. Sulfides in country rock shales, for example, are assimilated into the Platreef magma and locally upgrade the S content at such localities, although this did not trigger S saturation. Footwall sulfates, such as anhydrite, cannot be assimilated, but can interact with the Platreef sulfides through hydrothermal leaching when sufficient fluids had been released during assimilation. After emplacement of the Platreef, a significant period of cooling occurred, such that the Platreef was almost completely crystallized, during which time some ductile deformation occurred. The gabbronoritic hangingwall magma was then emplaced, forming a magmatic unconformity over the Platreef, occasionally exploiting shear zones to intrude finger-like bodies down into the Platreef. Where the hangingwall magma assimilated mineralized Platreef thin zones of PGE mineralization developed at its base. The magmatic intrusion of the Platreef can be considered to be distinct from that of other magmatic units in the northern limb of the Complex. Its Ni-Cu-PGE sulfide mineralization is orthomagmatic in origin however, complex interaction with a variety of country rock lithologies has locally altered the style and distribution of the mineralization, to form unique mineralogical associations and assemblages along strike. The understanding of local country rock control on features such as the mineralogy of the ores and the extent of remobilization into the footwall is critical in optimizing exploration, mining and mineral processing techniques...|$|E
