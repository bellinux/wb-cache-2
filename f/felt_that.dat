5|$|Glass Joe's French {{characteristics}} {{have been}} discussed by critics such as writer Sumantra Lahiri and Eurogamer's Oli Welsh. IGN's Craig Harris <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> the NES game focused more on his weaknesses and that the Wii game emphasized his stereotypes. A member of the Retronauts podcast also <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> he was defined more by his weakness than his nationality until he learned more about French stereotypes. Chris Buffa <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> the stereotypes could be considered offensive while Giant Bomb's Ryan Davis <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> there was nothing legitimately offensive.|$|E

5|$|Flanders <b>felt</b> <b>that,</b> {{to quell}} inflation, wage {{increases}} should {{be tied to}} productivity increases, rather {{than the cost of}} living. He recommended splitting gains in productivity three ways: to the worker for higher wages, to the company for higher profits and to the consumer for lower prices. He <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> with this approach everyone would benefit at the company level and in the national economy. Such an approach would require mutual respect and understanding between labor and management.|$|E

50|$|The {{second section}} of the paper machine is the press section, which removes much of the {{remaining}} water via a system of nips formed by rolls pressing against each other aided by press <b>felts</b> <b>that</b> support the sheet and absorb the pressed water.

5|$|Historians are {{agreed that}} the {{introduction}} and conclusion were added by a different author {{than that of the}} Libellus. Who that was, however, is open to debate. The historian C. W. David <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> it was {{based on the work of}} the chronicler Symeon of Durham, which thus made a credible date for the creation sometime between 1109 and 1129. David also <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> the Vita was used by a later work of Symeon's, the Historia Regum. Offler, however, <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> although Symeon knew of the Libellus, there was no evidence that he used the Vita, which would leave the author of the Vita unclear.|$|E
5|$|Kawada's musical style mainly fuses {{rock with}} trance. When Kawada debuted in 2001, she {{originally}} <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> the music she earned {{in her career}} was pocket money. She also felt happy {{that she could be}} based in Sapporo where she could be close to her family and friends, as well as to I've Sound who she felt was like a second family to her. After Kotoko made her major debut in 2004, I've Sound management began discussing the possibility of Kawada making a major debut. At first, she was hesitant because she <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> she would be thrust into the spotlight, but eventually she accepted the idea. For the first ten years of her career, she always <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> she was a beginner, but this began to change when younger singers made their debuts and began to treat her as an older sister.|$|E
25|$|The Nixon White House tapes {{reveal that}} Bob Haldeman told Nixon <b>that</b> <b>Felt</b> {{was the source}} of leaks of {{confidential}} information contained in the FBI’s investigation to various members of the press, including Bob Woodward of The Washington Post. Gray claimed that he resisted five separate demands from the White House to fire <b>Felt,</b> stating <b>that</b> he believed <b>Felt's</b> assurances <b>that</b> he was not the source. Eventually, Gray demanded to know who was claiming Felt to be leaking. Attorney general Richard Kleindienst told Gray that Roswell Gilpatric, former deputy secretary of defense under John F. Kennedy and now outside general counsel to Time, had told John Mitchell <b>that</b> <b>Felt</b> was leaking to Sandy Smith of Time magazine.|$|R

50|$|Owens called Hilburn:the Huckleberry Finn of journalism. He {{was such}} a down to earth, real person {{and he was always}} so observant about his {{surroundings}} and about how people <b>felt.</b> <b>That’s</b> {{one of the things that}} I hope I picked up from him, to find out what people are thinking and to make sure their voices are heard.|$|R
5|$|Kei Iwasaki of {{the band}} Sekaiichi, writing for Musica, <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> Ichiro Yamaguchi's dual love of 1990s pop music and {{electronic}} musicians such as Daft Punk and Cornelius strongly expressed itself throughout the album. He lauded Sakanaction's efforts to mix electronica and pop, but <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> mixing these two genres was a double-edged sword that invariably influenced the composition of songs. Because of this, he <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> Night Fishing might be more successful musically if the songs were re-recorded.|$|E

5|$|Overall {{identified}} {{a number of}} reasons why residents opposed self-government. Along with the previously mentioned fear of increases in taxation or decreases in services, he argued that those living in the ACT would have <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> they already had a voice in the governance of the territory, through federal electoral representation. Canberra also had a high proportion of public servants who <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> they were already a part of the government, and knew how to work with the system.|$|E

5|$|Smith <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> {{the legend}} on the obverse named a 6th-century bishop of Autun, but D. B. Haigh {{as well as}} C. H. V. Sutherland, Arthur Evans, and G. C. Brooke all <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> it {{referred}} to Liudhard, a Frankish bishop who accompanied the Frankish princess Bertha to Kent in the late 6th century when the Christian Bertha married the then pagan King Æthelberht of Kent. Liudhard died probably in the late 590s.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} well {{received}} by gaming critics on all platforms. Critics <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> {{the inclusion of}} online play, additional mutant powers, and a larger cast made the game an improvement over its predecessor. Some reviewers were critical of the game's voice acting and <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> the gameplay was repetitive. It sold enough copies {{to be added to}} the budget line known as PlayStation 2's Greatest Hits.|$|E
5|$|Administrators in the National Park Service <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> {{limiting}} the number of concessionaires in each national park would be more financially sound. The Curry Company and its rival, the Yosemite National Park Company, were forced to merge in 1925 to form the Yosemite Park & Curry Company (YP).|$|E

5|$|After {{the end of}} the war, Gandhi {{decided to}} promote Manekshaw to the rank of field marshal and {{subsequently}} appoint him as the Chief of the Defence Staff (CDS). However, after several objections from the bureaucracy, and the commanders of the navy and the air force, the appointment was dropped. It was <b>felt</b> <b>that,</b> as Manekshaw was from the army, as comparatively smaller forces the navy and air force would be neglected. Moreover, bureaucrats <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> it might challenge their influence over defence issues. Though Manekshaw was to retire in June 1972, his term was extended by a period of six months. On 3 January 1973, Manekshaw was conferred with the rank of field marshal at a ceremony held at Rashtrapati Bhavan. He was the first Indian army officer to be promoted to the rank.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the general}} public <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> tolling made the highway a luxury rather than its {{original}} purpose of relieving traffic on Highway401, Highway 407 ETR has had average daily trip counts of over 350,000 vehicles in June 2014.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the time}} of Kameo release, lead {{designer}} George Andreas <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> the original Kameo concept of finding and using monsters had evolved and carried through to the final product. He {{said that there were}} enough ideas for a sequel within the new intellectual property if players were interested. Years later, Andreas reappraised and said that the game should never have been released and remains a sore subject for him to discuss. Since the project was nearly finished, they had opted for launch title release instead of starting over. Andreas <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> the effort to conceal the fairy Kameo as an elf was unsuccessful and that the character did not match the Xbox's first-person shooter demographic.|$|E
5|$|As with {{previous}} games, the visuals of End of Ages were widely praised. The switch to real-time rendering was generally {{seen as a}} positive step. The game's music was lauded; GameSpot's review noted the use of music in End of Ages was sparse, but the little audio present set the proper tone for different Ages. A few reviewers, such as Charles Herold of the New York Times, <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> the graphics fell short of what was possible, especially compared to the prerendered visuals of Myst IV: Revelation. While Greg Kasavin of GameSpot <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> though the visuals were on par {{with previous}} games, End of Ages was missing several elements which made Myst IV more immersive; only important, story-driving items could be interacted with, for example, and the player makes no sounds or footsteps in the game.|$|E
