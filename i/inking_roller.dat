In 1813 he and a printer, Richard Mackenzie Bacon of Norwich, obtained a patent for a [...] "Polygonal printing machine"; this used types placed on a rotating square or hexagonal roller or [...] "geometric prism". Ink was applied by a roller which rose and fell with the irregularities of the prism. One of these machines was set up for Cambridge University. It however proved too complicated and suffered from poor inking, which prevented its success. However, {{it was the first}} machine to introduce composition ink rollers which were considered better than the existing leather-covered rollers. Donkin's <b>inking</b> <b>roller</b> quickly became the industry standard.|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} kraft handsheets of {{controlled}} pH and water absorbency was prepared and printed on a single-sheet flexographic proofpress, with a water-based ink. Ink transfer increased with increasing water absorbency. Ink penetration also increased with water absorbency, although {{the effect is}} small in the commercial range of ink levels. There is {{a slight increase in}} transfer of this alkaline ink to more acidicpapers, but there is no apparent influence of pH on ink setting. A series of newsprint samples was also printed. Within related wood species, print density on newsprint increases with fines content, while set-off decreases with increasing suqlace fines. The correlation between print-through and opacity is much better than was found with oil-based inks on the same newsprints, due to the absence of oil penetration effects. [11, capable of printing single handsheets made under a wider range of conditions and properties than is possible with webs. We report here the results of quantitative ink transfer measurements. We have printed handsheets made from a bleached kraft pulp at controlled pH and controlled water absorbency. Print density, printthrough, and set-off measurements have also been made on a well-characterized range of newsprints. EXPERIMENTAL Press A simple schematic diagram of the press is shown in Fig. 1. Typically, about 1 mL of ink forms the ink pond between the engraved <b>inking</b> <b>roller</b> (anilox cylinder) and the first doctor blade. After the ink is distributed on the anilox cylinder, the plate is inked and the sample printed. The press normally runs at 200 rpm (1. 6 d s). For set-off, a Kromecote cast-coated paper is used as reference. The nip between the print and the reference paper is closed immediately after printing. Print density, print-through, and set-off are determined from reflectance measurements, as describe...|$|E
50|$|The ink {{fountain}} stores {{a quantity of}} ink in a reservoir and feeds small quantities of ink to the distribution <b>rollers</b> from the <b>ink</b> fountain <b>roller</b> and the <b>ink</b> ductor <b>roller.</b> The <b>ink</b> ductor <b>roller</b> is a movable roller that moves {{back and forth between}} the <b>ink</b> fountain <b>roller</b> and an <b>ink</b> distribution <b>roller.</b> As the ductor contacts the <b>ink</b> fountain <b>roller,</b> both turn and the ductor is inked. The ductor then swings forward to contact an <b>ink</b> distribution <b>roller</b> and transfers <b>ink</b> to it. There are generally two types of ink distribution rollers: the <b>ink</b> rotating <b>rollers</b> (or <b>ink</b> transfer <b>rollers),</b> which rotate in one direction, and the <b>ink</b> oscillating <b>rollers</b> (or <b>ink</b> vibrating <b>rollers),</b> which rotate and move from side to side. The <b>ink</b> distribution <b>rollers</b> receive <b>ink</b> and work it into a semiliquid state that is uniformly delivered to the <b>ink</b> form <b>rollers.</b> A thin layer of ink is then transferred to the image portions of the lithographic plate by the <b>ink</b> form <b>rollers.</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The hard roller {{and soft}} roller are {{alternately}} arranged in the inking system of offset press. The ink vibrator {{is a hard}} roller which transmits the motion to the <b>ink</b> distributing <b>roller.</b> In order to analyze the motion mechanism of the <b>ink</b> <b>roller,</b> a model of an <b>ink</b> distributing <b>roller</b> and an <b>ink</b> vibrator is built up by using the software ANSYS. After the simulation of the motion, the force on the contact area of the <b>ink</b> distributing <b>roller</b> and the rotation speed of both rollers are analyzed. The {{result is that the}} <b>ink</b> distributing <b>roller</b> rotates with tangential force on the contact area and this force increases together with the rotation speed. When the two rollers rotate, the tangential elastic deformation is caused by the tangential force on contact area, and the radial deformation of the <b>ink</b> distributing <b>roller</b> is caused by the pressure. It leads to a relative sliding of the two rollers, which is mainly influenced by the rotation speed of ink vibrator and the radial deformation of <b>ink</b> distributing <b>roller.</b> Meanwhile, to verify the accuracy of the analysis, the rotation speed of the two rollers and the deformation of the <b>ink</b> distributing <b>roller</b> have been measured on a printability tester and then compared with the results of simulation. The analysis of the motion mechanism is very important to the study of printing color quality control...|$|R

50|$|Once the stencil was prepared, it {{was placed}} in the flatbed {{duplicating}} press with a blank sheet of paper below.

5000|$|Liquid <b>ink</b> <b>roller</b> ball pens flow {{extremely}} {{consistently and}} skip less than gel ink pens do. The lower viscosity of liquid ink {{increases the likelihood}} of consistent inking of the ball, whereas the higher viscosity of gel ink produces [...] "skipping", that is, occasional gaps in lines or letters.|$|R
5000|$|In 1891, David Gestetner {{patented}} his Automatic Cyclostyle. This {{was one of}} {{the first}} rotary machines that retained the flatbed, which passed back and forth under <b>inked</b> <b>rollers.</b> This invention provided for more automated, faster reproductions since the pages were produced and moved by rollers instead of pressing one single sheet at a time.|$|R
25|$|The {{plate is}} affixed to a {{cylinder}} on a printing press. Dampening rollers apply water, which covers the blank {{portions of the}} plate but is repelled by the emulsion of the image area.

5000|$|Indirect {{dampening}} systems (or integrated dampening systems) {{feed the}} water directly {{into one of}} the <b>ink</b> form <b>rollers</b> (<b>ink</b> <b>rollers</b> that touch the offset plate) via a water form roller in contact with it. These systems are known as [...] "indirect" [...] since the water travels to the offset plate passing through the inking system and not directly to the offset plate as direct systems do. Some indirect systems will have the ability to feed the water into the inking system {{as well as to the}} offset plate. A fine emulsion of ink and water is then developed on the <b>ink</b> form <b>roller.</b> This is one reason printers need to know about [...] "water pickup" [...] or what percentage of water can be taken up by the ink. These systems are also known as [...] "integrated" [...] dampening systems as they are integrated into the inking system. One of the benefits of these systems, is that they do not use covers thus they react more quickly when dampening changes are made. One generally finds this type of dampening systems on newer and faster press equipment today.|$|R
2500|$|Offset {{printing}} is {{a widely}} used printing technique where the inked image is transferred (or [...] "offset") from a plate to a rubber blanket, then to the printing surface. When used {{in combination with the}} lithographic process, which is based on the repulsion of oil and water, the offset technique employs a flat (planographic) image carrier on which the image to be printed obtains <b>ink</b> from <b>ink</b> <b>rollers,</b> while the non-printing area attracts a film of water, keeping the non-printing areas ink-free.|$|R
50|$|David Gestetner {{eventually}} {{moved to}} London, England and in 1881 established the Gestetner Cyclograph Company to produce stencils, styli and <b>ink</b> <b>rollers.</b> He guarded his invention through patents.

5000|$|On the press, four (up to six) {{different}} <b>ink</b> <b>rollers</b> {{supply the}} colors that will coat the individual printer plates.

25|$|Another {{source of}} {{contention}} {{is that the}} Brown crime scene fingerprint has the appearance of having been rolled, which is the practice of taking a person's inked finger and rolling it on an index card, and not the smudged, bloody and unreadable print as originally reported. Traditionally, after the fingertip is covered in ink from either the suspect's hand being pressed {{on top of an}} ink pad or an <b>ink</b> <b>roller</b> being run across it, the finger is placed on the card on one edge. It is rolled once from one edge to the finger's other edge to produce a large, clear print.|$|R
50|$|The ink {{fountain}} holds {{a pool of}} ink and controls the amount of ink that enters the inking system. The {{most common type of}} fountain consists of a metal blade that is held in place near the fountain roller. The gap between the blade and the <b>ink</b> fountain <b>roller</b> can be controlled by adjusting screw keys to vary the amount of ink on the fountain roller. The printer adjusts the keys in or out as the <b>ink</b> fountain <b>roller</b> turns to obtain the desired quantity of ink. In simple presses, the printer must turn these screws by hand. In modern presses, the adjusting screws are moved by servomotors which are controlled by the printer at a press console. Thus the printer can make ink adjustments electronically. If the printer needs to increase or decrease ink in an area of the plate (print), he need only adjust the needed keys to allow more or less ink flow through the blade. The ink flow can also be controlled by the rotation velocity of the <b>ink</b> fountain <b>roller.</b>|$|R

50|$|Such {{contact was}} vital while Werkman was {{building}} up {{his business and}} could not leave Groningen. In 1929 {{he was able to}} visit Cologne and Paris, after which he developed a new printing method, applying the <b>ink</b> <b>roller</b> directly to the paper and then stamping to achieve unique effects on a simple handpress. The more complex of these required some fifty handlings {{in and out of the}} press and could take a whole day to complete. Another of his experimental techniques was the painstaking production of abstract designs using the typewriter, which he called tiksels. After 1929 he also began writing rhythmic sound poems.|$|R
50|$|Rotary presses {{were used}} for {{high-speed}} work. In the oscillating press, the form slid under a drum around which each sheet of paper got wrapped for the impression, sliding back under the <b>inking</b> <b>rollers</b> while the paper was removed and a new sheet inserted. In a newspaper press, a papier-mâché mixture called a flong {{used to make a}} mould of the entire form of type, then dried and bent, and a curved metal plate cast against it. The plates were clipped to a rotating drum and could print against a continuous reel of paper at the enormously high speeds required for overnight newspaper production.This invention helped aid the high demand for knowledge during this time period.|$|R

5000|$|The printer uses an ink {{knife to}} lay out a [...] "pad", mound or streak of ink on a smooth inking plate, {{originally}} made of polished metal or stone.

The <b>roller</b> is passed systematically across the surface to produce an even layer of <b>ink.</b> The <b>roller</b> is then applied to the forme, block, stone or plate so that the ink is evenly transferred to the raised or receptive areas before the next stage of transferring the ink, by moderate pressure, to the printing surface or offset substrate.|$|R

50|$|A simple {{indication}} {{of the quality of}} a printing press is the number of distribution and form rollers. The greater the number of distribution rollers, the more accurate the control of ink uniformity. It is difficult to ink large solid areas on a plate with only one <b>ink</b> form <b>roller.</b> With three (generally the maximum), it is relatively easy to maintain consistent ink coverage of almost any image area on the plate. Business forms presses, which print very little coverage, usually only have one or two <b>ink</b> form <b>rollers.</b> Because of this, they cannot print large solid or screen images. Smaller, less sophisticated presses also have the same problem, however, many of the newer presses today are being equipped with larger, better inking systems to meet the growing print demands of the consumer.|$|R
