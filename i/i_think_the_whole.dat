500|$|Producer Paul Rabwin was displeased {{with the}} final episode, noting, [...] "'Badlaa' was the one episode I {{did not like the}} most [...] I think if I had done it different, I would have had John Shiban change the method of transportation. I don't think it ever worked on any level for me. It was just weird and creepy, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> idea was distasteful to me." [...] He later bluntly {{concluded}} that [...] "it's the only episode that I kind of wish we hadn't done." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2005, {{a promotional}} video that {{involves}} SpongeBob promoting diversity and tolerance was criticized by two U.S. Christian evangelical groups, most notably Focus on the Family, {{because they saw}} the character was being used as an advocate for homosexuality though the video contained [...] "no reference to sex, sexual lifestyle or sexual identity." [...] The incident led to questions {{as to whether or}} not SpongeBob, his best friend Patrick, and the rest of the series' characters are homosexual characters. After this speculation and comments, Hillenburg repeated his assertion that sexual preference was never considered during the creation of the show. He clarified the issue and said [...] "We never intended them to be gay. I consider them to be almost asexual. We're just trying to be funny and this has got nothing to do with the show." [...] Tom Kenny and other production members were shocked and surprised that such an issue had arisen. Derek Drymon, the show's creative director until 2004, said, [...] "If SpongeBob holds hands with Patrick it's because he's his best friend and he loves him. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> thing is a part of a larger agenda to stigmatize gay people." [...] Focus on the Family founder James Dobson later stated that his comments were taken out of context and that his original complaints were not with SpongeBob or any of the characters in the video but with the organization that sponsored the video, the We Are Family Foundation. Dobson noted that the foundation had posted pro-homosexual material on its website, but later removed it.|$|E

He said, [...] "You will note that I didn't collect the award. I don't give a fuck about winning that award. I've been a big critic of the Australian music industry. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> thing is utterly {{embarrassing}} and repulsive." ...|$|E

2500|$|Gyllenhaal {{concluded}} that Ennis and Jack were straight men who [...] "develop this love, this bond," [...] {{saying in a}} Details interview: [...] "I approached the story believing that these are actually two straight guys who fall in love." [...] Ledger was quoted in TIME magazine: [...] "I don't think Ennis could be labeled as gay. Without Jack Twist, I don't know that he ever would have come out.... <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> point {{was that it was}} two souls that fell in love with each other." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rear-Admiral Sir William Symonds {{noted that}} after the ship's launch she was [...] "cut down" [...] and made a safe and fast ship. In {{the time of the}} Commonwealth of England all ships named after royalty were renamed; it was first decided to change the name of the ship into Commonwealth, but in 1650 it became a simple Sovereign. In 1651 she was again made more {{manoeuvrable}} by reducing upperworks after which she was described as [...] "a delicate frigate (<b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> world hath not her like)". She served throughout the wars of the Commonwealth and became the flagship of General at Sea Robert Blake. She was involved in all of the great English naval conflicts fought against the United Provinces and France and was referred to as 'The Golden Devil' (den Gulden Duvel) by the Dutch.|$|E
2500|$|Regarding the album's title, Welch told MTV News, [...] "It {{was an art}} {{installation}} done in the '70s, {{this video}} piece all done on Super 8, this big procession of kind of coquette-style hippies and all these different colored robes and masks, {{and it was all}} to do with color, really saturated, brightly colored pastas and balloons. I saw it a couple years ago, and it was called 'Ceremonials' and then, like, Roman numerals after it. And the word sort of stuck with me, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> idea of performance, and kind of putting on this outfit and going out almost to find some sort of exorcism or absolution, to kind of get outside yourself, there's a sense of ceremony to it." [...] Welch also revealed that she wanted to call the album Violence, stating, [...] "I wanted to make an album that sounded like the soundtrack to Baz Luhrmann's Romeo + Juliet, the violence mixed with the classical Shakespearean drama mixed with the pop and the pulp, extreme neon stuff." [...] In an interview with The Guardian, she described the album as [...] "much bigger" [...] and categorised its genre as [...] "chamber soul", a mixture of chamber pop and soul. The liner notes of Ceremonials contain an essay by English writer Emma Forrest, dated 21 September 2011.|$|E

I won't forbid the banns. But, between you and me, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> thing is stuff and nonsense. What ought I to call him? Brother Horn?" ...|$|E
60|$|I don't {{deny that}} for a minute. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> on <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> women are more level-headed than men. They're not swayed by emotion. They're more practical.

6000|$|... "I flatter {{myself that}} I have managed it rather neatly," [...] the detective {{answered}} proudly. [...] "The young man volunteered a statement, {{in which he}} said that after following Drebber some time, the latter perceived him, and took a cab in order to get away from him. On his way home he met an old shipmate, and took a long walk with him. On being asked where this old shipmate lived, he was unable to give any satisfactory reply. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> case fits together uncommonly well.

60|$|At {{night we}} were again in Bologna, {{of which we}} {{had not seen the}} gloomy arcades for two years. It must be a dreary town at all times: in a rain it is horrible; and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> race of arcaded cities, Treviso, Padua, and Bologna, are dull, blind, and comfortless. The effect of the {{buildings}} vaulted above the sidewalks is that of a continuous cellarway; your view of the street is constantly interrupted by the heavy brick pillars that support the arches; the arcades are not even picturesque. Liking always to leave Bologna as quickly as possible, and, on this occasion, learning that there was no hope of crossing the Apennines to Florence, we made haste to take the first train for Genoa, meaning to proceed thence directly to Naples by steamer.|$|E

60|$|The plate from Raphael (11) is, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> on <b>the</b> <b>whole,</b> satisfactory.

60|$|We {{have been}} reading to-day the story of David's victory over the Philistine giant, Goliath. Now <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> history of David may teach us more {{about the meaning of}} the Old Testament, and how it applies to us, than the history of any other single character. David was the great hero of the Jews; the greatest, in spite of great sins and follies, that has ever been among them; in every point the king after God's own heart. Our Lord Jesus Christ Himself did not disdain to be called {{especially}} the Son of David. David was the author, too, of those wonderful psalms which are now in the mouths and the hearts of Christian people all over the world; and will last, as I believe, till the world's end, giving out fresh depths of meaning and spiritual experience.|$|E
6000|$|... 1. 9. And dull the barbèd fire {{against his}} frozen cheek. The {{construction}} runs--'Another would break, &c., and [would] dull, &c.' The term 'the barbèd fire' represents of course 'the winged reeds,' or arrows: actual reeds or arrows are now transmuted into flame-tipped arrows (conformable {{to the spiritual}} or immaterial quality of the Dreams): the fire is to be quenched against the frost of the death-cold cheek of Adonais. 'Frozen tears--frozen cheek:' Shelley would scarcely, I apprehend, have allowed this repetition, but for some inadvertence. I am free to acknowledge that <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> of this stanza bad. Its raison d'être is a figurative but perfectly appropriate and straightforward passage in Bion: Shelley has attempted to turn that into a still more figurative passage suitable for Adonais, with a result anything but happy. He fails to make it either straightforward or appropriate, and declines into the super-subtle or wiredrawn.|$|E
6000|$|But when Uncle William makes {{speeches in}} the dining-room <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> room becomes {{transformed}} for {{him into the}} banquet room of a palace, and the cheap bracket lamps against the wall turn into a blaze of light and the boarders are all courtiers, and he {{becomes more and more}} grandiloquent. He waves his hand towards Uncle Henry and refers to him as [...] "my brother the Admiral," [...] and to me as [...] "the Princess at my side." [...] Some of the people, the meaner ones, begin to laugh and to whisper, and others look uncomfortable and sorry. And it is always on these occasions that Uncle William refers to himself as America's guest, and refers to the Americans as the hospitable nation who have taken him to their heart. I think that when Uncle says this he really believes it; Uncle can believe practically anything if he says it himself.|$|E
