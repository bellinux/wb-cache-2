Costing inputs at their historical nominal prices (FIFO) is a real burden and disincentive, greater the higher the inflation rate. It is analogous to depreciating durable capital at historical cost.

40|$|Physical {{inventories}} {{constitute a}} considerable proportion of companies’ investments in today’s competitive environment. The trade-off between customer service levels and <b>inventory</b> <b>investments</b> is addressed in practice by formal quantitative inventory management (stock control) solutions. Given the tremendous number of Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) that contemporary organisations deal with, such solutions {{need to be}} fully automated. However, managers very often judgementally adjust the output of statistical software (such as the demand forecasts and/or the replenishment decisions) to reflect qualitative information that they possess. In this research we {{are concerned with the}} value being added (or not) when statistical/quantitative output is judgementally adjusted by managers. Our work aims to investigate the effects of incorporating human judgement into such inventory related decisions and it is the first study to do so empirically. First, a set of relevant research questions is developed based on a critical review of the literature. Then, an extended database of approximately 1, 800 SKUs from an electronics company is analysed for the purpose of addressing the research questions. In addition to empirical exploratory analysis, a simulation experiment is performed in order to evaluate in a dynamic fashion what are the effects of adjustments on the performance of a stock control system. The results on the simulation experiment reveal that judgementally adjusted replenishment orders may improve inventory performance in terms of reduced <b>inventory</b> <b>investments</b> (costs). However, adjustments do not seem to contribute towards the increase of the cycle service level (CSL) and fill rate. Since there have been no studies addressing similar issues to date, this research should be of considerable value in advancing the current state of knowledge in the area of inventory management. From a practitioner’s perspective, the findings of this research may guide managers in adjusting order-up-to levels for the purpose of achieving better inventory performance. Further, the results may also contribute towards the development of better functionality of inventory support systems (ISS) ...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} is {{a collection}} of three essays in international and financial economics. In these essays, I focus on government debt and firm financing decisions over the business cycle. In the first essay, I study the role of income inequality in government’s borrowing and default decisions. To explore the relationship between default risk and income inequality, I extend the standard endogenous default model to allow for heterogeneous agents. The main finding of this paper is that inequality shocks can increase the default risk significantly. The model can also generate high consumption volatility of poor households relative to rich households, consistent with the data. I extend the model by introducing progressive income taxes and show that as the progressivity of the tax increases, the probability of default decreases. In the second essay, I address how the financing of working capital plays a role in the default risk and the business cycle characteristics observed in emerging market economies. I propose a general equilibrium model with endogenous sovereign default risk and working capital conditions and study the role of labor markets in generating the drops in output observed in defaults. I find that the working capital condition increases the default risk through a feedback loop. I show that this model is able to match the countercyclical interest rates, high volatility of consumption relative to output and countercyclical trade balance observed in Argentina. The third essay analyzes the role of binding financing constraints on manufacturing firms’ investment decisions in the U. S., using the Great Recession period as a natural case study. The main finding of this paper is that firms that do not borrow from public bond markets experienced binding liquidity constraints on their R&D investments during the recession. The paper also compares the evidence on financial constraints in R&D investments to the evidence about capital and <b>inventory</b> <b>investments.</b> Firms without bond ratings show the highest liquidity sensitivity for <b>inventory</b> <b>investments,</b> and investment-liquidity sensitivity is greater for capital than it is for R&D investments...|$|R

[...] Starting from {{some point in the}} {{business cycle}}, some group (consumers, government, purchasers of exports, etc.) decides for some reason to have a sustained increase in their spending. This may {{come as a surprise to}} producers, who initially experience negative <b>inventory</b> <b>investment</b> as their sales have unexpectedly exceeded their production. Now their inventories are too low, for two reasons: (1) Inventories have accidentally gone down, and (2) the optimal level of inventories - what producers want to have on hand - has gone up because sustained customer demand has gone up and there is increased danger of temporary stock-outs. In order to build inventories up to an appropriate level, firms engage in positive intended <b>inventory</b> <b>investment.</b> This positive flow of intended <b>inventory</b> <b>investment</b> continues until the target level of inventories is reached. During this time, the economy is in a boom both due to the original sustained increase in spending and due to the positive flow of intended <b>inventory</b> <b>investment.</b>|$|E
50|$|At some point, {{there is}} a {{sustained}} increase in some type of spending for some reason. (One reason may simply be that, once inventories sink to their desired level, there stops being negative intended <b>inventory</b> <b>investment,</b> which goes up from negative to zero; but again {{there may be other}} reasons as well.) At this point there is negative unintended <b>inventory</b> <b>investment</b> as firms are caught by surprise by the external increase in demand and they fail to simultaneously raise their production. Now inventories are too low, again for two reasons, and we are back where we started in the cycle. The recession has bottomed out, sustained spending is once again high, target inventory levels are higher than actual inventory levels, and intended <b>inventory</b> <b>investment</b> is positive.|$|E

Non-issuer firms have significantly higher investment-liquidity sensitivities vis-à-vis issuer firms for <b>inventory</b> <b>investments</b> in 1996 – 1997. Issuer and non-issuer firms investing less than their internal funds have no differences in liquidity coefficients while firms investing more than their internal funds do.

Recently many writers have suggested that inventory holding cost may be misestimated in many firms.

Now inventories are too high, for two reasons: (1) They have accidentally risen, and (2) the optimal level of inventories is lower now due to the new, lower level of sustained demand. So in order to lower their inventories, firms deliberately cut back their production to below the level of demand by their customers, thus causing inventories to be deliberately drawn down - that is, intended <b>inventory</b> <b>investment</b> is negative.

The assets include machinery, buildings, <b>inventories,</b> <b>investments</b> in short-lived R&D (that is, investments whose returns last only a few years) and in long-lived R&D (whose returns last many years). Two human capital assets are included [...] firm-sponsored training and household-sponsored tertiary education. The calculations incorporate parameters from both the personal and corporate tax codes. They are performed for the “top-bracket” taxpayer and for the “average production worker ” and cover between 15 and 22 countries, depending on data availability. The OECD has already used the King-Fullerton method to calculate METRs for physical capital (OECD, 1991) and this paper updates these calculations using established practices. As the method has not yet been applied to household-sponsored human capital, the paper describes the extension to this type of investment in some detail. The international averages for the METRs show that intangible capital generally receives more favourable tax treatment than physical capital. On average, th...|$|R
40|$|Vendor Managed Inventory is {{receiving}} considerable attention of late. It represents {{a powerful tool}} to remove cost from the supply chain. It is a streamlined approach to inventory and order fulfillment and is {{a system in which}} a vendor continuously and automatically replenishes a trading partner’s inventory. True VMI occurs between a distributor and a manufacturer, with Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) being the crucial link between the two companies. [1] Trust is a critical ingredient in a successful VMI alliance. VMI also entails a stocking strategy, whereby manufacturers use their systems to predict and replenish the distributor’s warehouse. VMI has produced remarkable results, tangible as well as intangible and enables a company to reduce their customer’s inventory levels and reduce customer stockouts. Some distributors may be apprehensive about letting their vendors control their inventory, worrying that this might lead to an oversupply from their vendors. However many authors have allayed this fear by reiterating that VMI eliminates repetitive distributor purchasing activities, eliminates human errors, reduces shipping costs, improves service levels, results in shorter lead times, leads to reduced <b>inventory</b> <b>investments</b> and so on.

40|$|Recently, industrialized {{countries}} experienced tight financial conditions {{to an extent}} that has been unprecedented for decades. This coincided with an implosion of world trade. Is this mere coincidental {{or is this a}} result? More generally, can short-term deviations from the long-term growth rate of trade be explained by changes in the availability of external finance? Based on a 14 year sample, the answer seems to be yes. Using an error correction model, quarterly data of the U. S. was analyzed for the period 1991 : 4 - 2005 : 4. Over 70 {{percent of the variance in}} trade was explained, using income, vertical specialization, technological development and tariff rates as long-run drivers of trade, while changes in credit standards allowed for short-run deviations in the trade growth rate.

40|$|The retail {{industry}} is experiencing {{problems in the}} supply chain {{because there is no}} formal collaboration between the retailer and supplier. Demand uncertainty in the supply chain, known as the "bullwhip effect," results in excess inventory and inefficiencies in the supply chain. Demand forecasts and orders are often distorted unless they are developed jointly by the partners. These factors create a need for supply-chain integration and a way to provide supporting collaborative forecasting and replenishing processes, with the goal of increasing sales and reducing <b>inventory</b> <b>investments</b> and cycle time. Collaboration can reduce waste in the supply chain, but it can also increase market responsiveness, customer satisfaction, and competitiveness among all {{of the members of the}} partnership.

40|$|The {{pressure}} to reduce <b>inventory</b> <b>investments</b> in supply chains has increased as competi-tion expands and product variety grows. Managers {{are looking for}} areas they can improve to reduce inventories without hurting the level of service provided. Two areas that man-agers focus on are {{the reduction of the}} replenishment lead time from suppliers and the variability of this lead time. The normal approximation of lead time demand distribution indicates that both actions reduce inventories for cycle service levels above 50 %. The normal approximation also indicates that reducing lead time variability tends to have a greater impact than reducing lead times, especially when lead time variability is large. We build on the work of Eppen and Martin (1988) to show that the conclusions from the normal approximation are flawed, especially in the range of service levels where most companies operate. We show the existence of a service-level threshold greater than 50 % below which reorder points increase with a decrease in lead time variability. Thus, for a firm operating just below this threshold, reducing lead times decreases reorder points, whereas reducing lead time variability increases reorder points. For firms operating at these service levels, decreasing lead time is the right lever if they want to cut inventories, not reducing lead time variability...|$|R
