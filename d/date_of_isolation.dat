Phylogenetic analysis of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequence of the organism revealed two closely related strains, DSW-1T and DSW-21. These strains are classified in Cytophaga-Flavobacterium-Bacteroides (CFB) group, which are dominant genera in marine environments. Winogradsky first described Cytophaga-like bacteria as unicellular, gliding, nonspore-formers, and Gram-negative rods, although the shape varies. Many Cytophaga-like bacterial colonies have pigment due to flexirubin-type pigments that are only found in these bacteria and flavobacteria. Cytophaga-Flavobacteria are chemoorganotrophs {{and are able to}} degrade biopolymers like chitin and cellulose.|$|E

The curve {{is based on}} 18 radiocarbon <b>dates</b> <b>of</b> <b>isolation</b> contacts, identified from lithological and diatomological criteria, in nine lake basins situated between 12 and 57 m a. s. l. Most of the lakes show a conformable, regressive I-II-III (marine-transitional-freshwater) facies succession, indicating a postglacial history comprising an early (10, 000 - 9000 radiocarbon years BP) phase of rapid, glacio-isostatically induced emergence (~ 5 cm/year) and a later phase (after 7000 years BP,) having a moderate rate of emergence (< 0. 5 cm/year).

40|$|The {{relative}} {{sea level}} rose 10 m on Sotra, western Norway, during the Younger Dryas (YD). Based on <b>dating</b> <b>of</b> <b>isolation</b> basins, the transgression started in late Allerød at ~ 13 110 {{and ended in}} late YD at ~ 11 780 cal yr BP, with an average sea-level rise of ~ 7 mm yr- 1. Between ~ 11 780 and ~ 11 560 cal yr BP the relative sea level was stable. Shortly after the YD/Holocene boundary the sea level rapidly fell 37 m at ~ 23 mm yr- 1. The shorelines for the regression minimum in Allerød and the transgression maximum in YD are almost parallel with tilt of 1. 2 - 1. 4 m km- 1, indicating that no isostatic tilting, and thus neither uplift or depression occurred during the sea-level rise. We conclude that the transgression {{was caused by a}} YD ice-sheet re-advance mapped in the same area. This stopped the isostatic uplift and increased the gravitational attraction on the sea elevating the geoid in this area. There may also been a contribution from rising glacio-eustatic sea level. Our results show that the transgression started around 13 110 cal yr BP. Thus, we conclude that the YD ice-sheet advance in western Norway started before the onset of the YD...|$|R
40|$|We {{previously}} characterized over 100 Staphylococcus sciuri isolates, {{mainly of}} animal origin, {{and found that}} they all carried a genetic element (S. sciuri mecA) {{closely related to the}} mecA gene of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains. We also found a few isolates that carried a second copy of the gene, identical to MRSA mecA. In this work, we analyzed a collection of 28 S. sciuri strains isolated from both healthy and hospitalized individuals. This was a relatively heterogeneous group, as inferred from the different sources, places, and <b>dates</b> <b>of</b> <b>isolation</b> and as confirmed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analysis. All strains carried the S. sciuri mecA copy, sustaining our previous proposal that this element belongs to the genetic background of S. sciuri. Moreover, 46 % of the strains also carried the MRSA mecA copy. Only these strains showed significant levels of resistance to beta-lactams. Strikingly, the majority of the strains carrying the additional MRSA mecA copy were obtained from healthy individuals in an antibiotic-free environment. Most of the 28 strains were resistant to penicillin, intermediately resistant to clindamycin, and susceptible to tetracycline, erythromycin, and gentamicin. Resistance to these last three antibiotics was found in some strains only. The findings reported in this work confirmed the role of S. sciuri {{in the evolution of the}} mechanism of resistance to methicillin in staphylococci and suggested that this species (like the pathogenic staphylococci) may accumulate resistance markers for several classes of antibiotics...|$|R

40|$|Virus gene {{sequencing}} and phylogenetics {{can be used}} to study the epidemiological dynamics of rapidly evolving viruses. With complete genome data, it becomes possible to identify and trace individual transmission chains of viruses such as influenza virus during the course of an epidemic. Here we sequenced 153 pandemic influenza H 1 N 1 / 09 virus genomes from United Kingdom isolates from the first (127 isolates) and second (26 isolates) waves of the 2009 pandemic and used their sequences, <b>dates</b> <b>of</b> <b>isolation,</b> and geographical locations to infer the genetic epidemiology of the epidemic in the United Kingdom. We demonstrate that the epidemic in the United Kingdom was composed of many cocirculating lineages, among which at least 13 were exclusively or predominantly United Kingdom clusters. The estimated divergence times of two of the clusters predate the detection of pandemic H 1 N 1 / 09 virus in the United Kingdom, suggesting that the pandemic H 1 N 1 / 09 virus was already circulating in the United Kingdom before the first clinical case. Crucially, three clusters contain isolates from the second wave of infections in the United Kingdom, two of which represent chains of transmission that appear to have persisted within the United Kingdom {{between the first and second}} waves.

40|$|Fifty-eight {{clinical}} isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae serotype 6 B, including 16 from Alaska, 14 from Arizona, 11 from Washington, and 17 {{from seven}} additional states, were analyzed. The antibiograms of these isolates {{were assigned to}} 10 antibiotic profiles based on their susceptibilities to penicillin, erythromycin, tetracycline, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Thirty-two (55 %) of these isolates were penicillin nonsusceptible, while 21 (36 %) were intermediate or resistant to three or more antibiotics. The restriction endonucleases ApaI and SmaI were used to digest intact chromosomes, and the fragments were resolved by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). The ApaI and SmaI PFGE patterns were combined, and 13 of the 16 Alaskan isolates showed indistinguishable PFGE patterns. One other isolate exhibited highly related ApaI and SmaI PFGE patterns, differing by only one band after restriction with ApaI. Among the 14 isolates from Arizona, 1 was indistinguishable from the predominant ApaI and SmaI PFGE patterns seen in the Alaskan isolates; 5 others were highly related (± 1 band after cutting with either enzyme) to the Alaskan isolates, suggesting a common ancestral origin. Of the remaining eight isolates, six additional ApaI plus SmaI PFGE patterns were observed. The 28 isolates from the various contiguous states had 22 ApaI plus SmaI PFGE patterns.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{literature}} is ripe with phylogenetic estimates of nucleotide substitution rates, especially of measurably evolving {{species such as}} RNA viruses. However, {{it is not known}} how robust these rate estimates are to inaccuracies in the data, particularly in sampling dates that are used for molecular clock calibration. Here we report on the rate of evolution of the emerging pathogen Rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV), which has significantly different rates of evolution for the same outer capsid (VP 60) gene published in the literature. In an attempt to reconcile the conflicting data and further elucidate details of RHDV[*]’s evolutionary history, we undertook fresh Bayesian analyses and employed jackknife control methods to produce robust substitution rate and time to most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) estimates for RHDV based on the VP 60 and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase genes. Results Through these control methods, we were able to identify a single misdated taxon, a passaged lab strain used for vaccine production, which was responsible for depressing the RHDV capsid gene’s rate of evolution by 65 %. Without this isolate, the polymerase and the capsid protein genes had nearly identical rates of evolution: 1. 90 x 10 - 3 nucleotide substitutions/site/year, ns/s/y, (95 % highest probability density (HPD) 1. 25 x 10 - 3 - 2. 55 x 10 - 3) and 1. 91 x 10 - 3 [*]ns/s/y (95 % HPD 1. 50 x 10 - 3 - 2. 34 x 10 - 3), respectively. Conclusions After excluding the misdated taxon, both genes support a significantly higher substitution rate as well as a relatively recent emergence of RHDV, and obviate the need for previously hypothesized decades of unobserved diversification of the virus. The control methods show that using even one misdated taxon in a large dataset can significantly skew estimates of evolutionary parameters and suggest that it is better practice to use smaller datasets composed of taxa with unequivocal isolation dates. These jackknife controls would be useful for future tip-calibrated rate analyses that include taxa with ambiguous <b>dates</b> <b>of</b> <b>isolation.</b> </p...|$|R

40|$|We {{have shown}} {{previously}} that, {{compared to other}} enteroviruses, the coxsackievirus A 9 (CAV- 9) prototype strain, Griggs, contains a C-terminal extension to the capsid protein VP 1 and that within this extension there is an RGD (arginine-glycine-aspartic acid) motif. To determine whether these features are found in other CAV- 9 strains and therefore analyse whether {{they are likely to}} be functionally important, we have determined the nucleotide sequence of the appropriate region from five strains, isolated over a 25 year period. The results indicate that there is considerable diversity between the strains and there is little correlation between nucleotide sequence identity and <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>isolation.</b> All isolates exhibit the VP 1 extension and although its amino acid sequence is otherwise variable, the RGD motif is common to all. This conservation of sequence, within a region which can otherwise vary, implies that the RGD sequence must be functionally significant.

To improve reovirus detection strategies, we developed a reverse transcription-PCR technique to amplify a fragment of the reovirus L 1 gene segment. This assay was capable of detecting 44 of 44 reovirus field isolate strains and was sufficiently sensitive to detect nearly a single viral particle (1. 16 ± 0. 13) per PCR of prototype strain type 3 Dearing. Pairwise comparisons of the 44 partial L 1 gene sequences revealed that nucleotide variability ranged from 0 to 24. 7 %, {{with most of the}} nucleotide polymorphism occurring at synonymous positions. Phylogenetic trees generated from amplified L 1 gene sequences suggest that multiple alleles of the L 1 gene cocirculate in nature and that genetic diversity of the L 1 gene is largely independent of the host species, geographic locale, or <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>isolation.</b> Phylogenetic trees constructed from the L 1 gene sequences are distinct from those constructed from the four reovirus S-class gene segments, which supports the hypothesis that reovirus gene segments reassort in nature.

The RSV disease in the five immunocompromised adults in 1988 was caused by two distinct strains; three patients were infected with RSV subgroup A/ 4, and two were infected with RSV subgroup B/ 2. Combining the epidemiologic and strain characterization studies, none of four patients in 1987 were infected from each other, and two of five patients in 1988 may have been infected, directly or indirectly, from one of the other five.

Quantitative genetic approaches provide an opportunity to investigate correlations between genetic factors and environmental parameters that might define a niche. Previously, we have shown how a collection of 208 whole-genome sequenced wild Caenorhabditis elegans can facilitate association mapping approaches.

Strains studied were isolated over a 37 -year period from different mammalian hosts and geographic locations. A high degree of variability was observed in the nucleotide sequences of the S 3 gene, whereas the deduced amino acid sequences of the S 3 gene product, σNS, were highly conserved. When variability among the S 3 nucleotide sequences was analyzed using pairwise comparisons, we found that 5 ′ and 3 ′ noncoding regions were significantly more conserved than {{the remainder of the}} gene. This high degree of sequence conservation was also observed within the first 15 nucleotides of the 5 ′ coding region. Phylogenetic analyses showed that multiple alleles of the S 3 gene cocirculate and that genetic diversity in the S 3 gene does not correlate with host species, geographic locale, or <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>isolation.</b> Phylogenetic trees constructed from variation in the S 3 sequences are distinct from those previously generated from sequences that encode attachment protein σ 1, core protein σ 2, and outer capsid protein σ 3, which supports the hypothesis that reovirus gene segments reassort in nature.

The analysis showed that microsatellite clustering does not fully match the six DTUs, but it is relevant for the within DTUs analyses. Population genetics analysis was conducted on 11 relevant subsamples of stocks from Bolivia and Peru, belonging to TcI (6) and TcV (5), defined by four criterions: DTU, vector species, geographic origin, and <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>isolation.</b> Most TcV strains presented the same multilocus genotype over all subsamples with the puzzling characteristic that five loci were heterozygous and the other five homozygous.

The poor role played by spatio-temporal factors in describing the observed genetic diversity suggested that ecology, in particular as regard to host played a significant role.

Recent studies suggest that C. perfringens type A food poisoning is caused by C. perfringens isolates carrying a chromosomal cpe gene, while CPE-associated non-food-borne GI diseases, such as AAD, are caused by plasmid cpe isolates. Those putative relationships, obtained predominantly with European isolates, were tested {{in the current study}} by examining 34 cpe-positive, C. perfringens fecal isolates from North American cases of food poisoning or AAD. These North American disease isolates were all classified as type A using a multiplex PCR assay. Furthermore, restriction fragment length polymorphism and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis genotyping analyses showed the North American AAD isolates included in this collection all have a plasmid cpe gene, but the North American food poisoning isolates all carry a chromosomal cpe gene. Western blotting demonstrated CPE expression by nearly all of these disease isolates, confirming their virulence potential. These findings with North American isolates provide important new evidence that, regardless of geographic origin or <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>isolation,</b> plasmid cpe isolates cause most CPE-associated AAD cases and chromosomal cpe isolates cause most C. perfringens type A food poisoning cases.

For molecular characterization, we analyzed the staphylococcal cassette chromosome types, the erm gene presence, and the genomic diversity of isolates using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. The 12 isolates of S. aureus were previously confirmed as heteroresistance to vancomycin using the population analysis profile–area under curve. Regarding genetic variability, two clones were detected: the main one (clone A) composed of four isolates and the clones B, with two isolates. For clone A, two isolates presented identical band patterns and were related to the same hospital, with an interval of 57 days between their isolation. The other isolates of this clone showed no epidemiological link between them because they were isolated in different hospitals and had no temporal relationship. The other clone showed no detectable epidemiological relationship. The heteroresistance to vancomycin recovered in Santa Catarina State from 2009 to 2012 had, in general, heterogeneous genomic patterns based on pulsed-field gel electrophoresis results, which is in accordance with the fact that these isolates had little or no epidemiological relationship among them. Due to the characteristic phenotypic instability and often prolonged vancomycin therapy for selection, clonal spread is not as common as for other resistance mechanisms disseminated through horizontal gene transfer...|$|E
40|$|In the elderly, Streptococcus {{pneumonia}}e is {{the most}} common cause of pneumonia and one of the most frequently isolated pathogens in cases of acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD). This study was conducted to compare the pneumococcal isolates obtained during episodes of AECOPD and pneumonia in patients of ≥ 65 years old and to analyze whether in patients with AECOPD and pneumonia within a short interval, the same isolate caused both episodes. This laboratory-based study was performed between 2005 and 2008. Pneumococcal isolates from episodes of pneumonia (n = 401) and AECOPD (n = 398), matched one-to-one by <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>isolation,</b> were characterized. The serotypes and genotypes of other pneumococcal isolates causing pneumonia and AECOPD in the same patient were compared. In patients with pneumonia, COPD as an underlying disease was not associated with more-drug-resistant pneumococci. In contrast, isolates causing AECOPD showed higher rates of resistance than those causing pneumonia. Serotypes 1, 3, and 7 F were more frequent in pneumonia. The same pneumococcus was involved in 25. 7 % (9 / 35 patients) of patients with two consecutive AECOPD episodes but in only 6. 3 % (2 / 32 patients) of COPD patients with pneumonia and exacerbation (Fisher's exact test; P = 0. 047). Less invasive serotypes were isolated more often in AECOPD and were more resistant to antimicrobials. The presence of a specific pneumococcal serotype in AECOPD does not predict the etiology of subsequent pneumonia...|$|E

40|$|Bacteriophages are {{ubiquitous}} {{in nature and}} represent a vast repository of genetic diversity, which {{is driven by the}} endless coevolution cycle with a diversified group of bacterial hosts. Studying phage-host interactions is important to gain novel insights into their dynamic adaptation. In this study, we isolated 12 phages infecting species of the Acinetobacter baumannii-Acinetobacter calcoaceticus complex which exhibited a narrow host range and similar morphological features (podoviruses with short tails of 9 – 12 nm and isometric heads of 50 – 60 nm). Notably, the alignment of the newly sequenced phage genomes (40 – 41 kb of DNA length) and all Acinetobacter podoviruses deposited in Genbank has shown high synteny, regardless <b>of</b> the <b>date</b> and source <b>of</b> <b>isolation</b> that spans from America to Europe and Asia. Interestingly, the C-terminal pectate lyase domain of these phage tail fibres is often the only difference found among these viral genomes, demonstrating a very specific genomic variation during the course of their evolution. We proved that the pectate lyase domain is responsible for phage depolymerase activity and binding to specific Acinetobacter bacterial capsules. We discuss how this mechanism of phage-host co-evolution impacts the tail specificity apparatus of Acinetobacter podoviruses. </p...|$|R
40|$|Wisconsin (one each). <b>Dates</b> <b>of</b> LM <b>isolation</b> {{ranged from}} May 17 through November 26 with 26 (90 %) infections {{occurring}} since July 15. When subtyped, the LM isolates from these cases were indistinguishable by {{pulsed-field gel electrophoresis}} (PulseNet pattern numbers GX 6 A 16. 0014 by Asc 1 and GX 6 A 12. 0017 by Apa 1) and ribotyping (DUP- 1053). This report summarizes the investigation, which linked these cases of listeriosis to eating deli turkey meat. Eight perinatal and 21 nonperinatal cases were reported. Among the 21 nonperinatal case-patients, the median age was 65 years (range: 29 – 92 years); 13 (62 %) were female. The 29 cases {{have been associated with}} four deaths and three miscarriages/ stillbirths. A case-control study conducted by five state and two local health departments and CDC implicated eating deli turkey meat as the probable source of infection. Thirteen (76 %) of 17 case-patients and five (21 %) of 24 controls ate deli turkey meat during the 30 days before illness onset (Mantel-Haenszel weighted odds ratio= 8. 0; 95 % confidence interval= 1. 2 – 43. 3). State health and agriculture departments investigated 13 stores and delicatessens where 11 patients reported purchasing turkey; these stores and delicatessens carried turkey meat produced by at least 27 federally inspected establishments. Two establishments were linked to 10 of 11 patients; one of these establishments produced turkey meat for the second establishment. On December 8, investigators from the Food Safety and Inspection Service, U. S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) began investigating the implicated establishments...|$|R
40|$|Objetive: To {{evaluate}} {{the association between}} quinolone exposure {{and the emergence of}} carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) and to estimate CRKP-specific mortality. Methods: Case-case-control study implemented in a tertiary care institution. Three groups of patients were analyzed: 61 consecutive cases of infection with CRKP (Group I); 61 randomly chosen cases of patients infected with carbapenem-sensitive Klebsiella pneumoniae (CSKP; Group II); and 122 randomly chosen controls without CRKP or CSKP infection. Matching was based on the length of stay in intensive care unit and the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> bacterial <b>isolation.</b> An active search was performed for patients with CRKP and CSKP infection, and prospective cases were included in the study. We compared the results for Groups I and II against those for the controls by using two conditional logistic regression analyses that included infection as the dependent variable and controlled for time at risk and co-morbidities. Results: Exposure to quinolones was not associated with CRKP infection: no association was found in the analysis of CRKP with the controls (OR = 1. 7; 95 % CI: 0. 2 - 6. 5) or in the analysis of CSKP against the controls (OR = 0. 6; 95 % CI: 0. 2 - 1. 6). Use of carbapenems (OR = 3. 3; 95 % CI: 1. 2 - 9. 3) and colonization with CRKP (OR = 3. 3; 95 % IC: 1. 2 - 9. 3) were specific risk factors for infection with CRKP. Mortality associated with CRKP was 61. 3 %. Conclusion: No association was found between exposure to quinolones and infection with CRKP; however, colonization by CRKP and use of carbapenems are risk factors for infection wit...|$|R
