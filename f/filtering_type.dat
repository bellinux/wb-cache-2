In order to quantify the dependence of extreme events and anomalous scaling on the filter, we compare a sharp Fourier Galerkin projector, a Gaussian filter and a novel class of Galerkin projectors with non-sharp spectral filter profiles. Of interest is the importance of Galilean invariance and we confirm that local SFS energy transfer displays intermittency scaling in both skewness and flatness {{as a function of the}} cutoff scale.

40|$|In {{previous}} work, we {{have shown}} {{that in the case}} of multiple antennas and/or oversampling, FIR ZF equalizers exist for FIR channels and can be obtained from the noise-free linear prediction (LP) problem.

One is a number of blind equalization techniques of the adaptive <b>filtering</b> <b>type.</b> We also present some robustifying modifications of the DML problem. 1. INTRODUCTION Consider linear digital modulation over a linear channel with additive Gaussian noise so that the received signal can be written as y(t) = X k akh(t Γ kT) + v(t) (1) where the ak are the transmitted symbols, T is the symbol period, h(t) is the (overall) channel impulse response.

40|$|A vast {{variety of}} <b>filter</b> <b>types</b> were {{proven to be}} {{effective}} and efficient for robust residual vibration suppression, when they are applied for input or command preconditioning. These <b>filter</b> <b>types</b> include a class of specifically designed notch Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filters -known as ""input shapers""-, conventional low-pass FIR filters and conventional low-pass Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) filters. Although all these filters possess good vibration suppression properties, they present different performance characteristics. A comparison of these filters is attempted in this paper, in order to evaluate the advantages and the drawbacks of each <b>filter</b> <b>type.</b> It is concluded that certain conventional FIR filters (the filter designed using a Chebyshev window, the Parks-McClellan filter and the Constrained Least Squares filter) and a specific IIR filter (the Thiran's filter) are the best performing <b>filter</b> <b>types,</b> especially when {{they are used to}} suppress vibration of systems with multiple modes or when they are used to suppress vibration of time-varying systems...|$|R
40|$|In recent {{developments}} of controllers for {{active noise cancellation}} and active vibration suppression, digital real-time filters and different adaptation algorithms are use. The necessity of their optimized performance lead to algorithms which are strictly based on the application, but the digital <b>filter</b> <b>type</b> should also be considered in an optimizing investigation. A few adaptive <b>filter</b> <b>types</b> have been developed in the past, especially for acoustic and speech processing applications. In the field of adaptive structural systems, however, special advancements of filters are missing. This paper deals with the synthesis of adptive filter systems which should be optimally designed for the applications of system identification and active vibration control. It is extremely useful to take a priori knowledge into consideration when choosing a <b>filter</b> <b>type.</b> Therefore, the <b>filter</b> <b>type</b> should be optimal {{with respect to the}} structure to be controlled, but also to the algorithm, in oder to actually offer the possibility of good performance. Thus, special adaptive IIR, Lattice and Ladder filters are discussed, and a new adaptive <b>filter</b> <b>type</b> is presented, which is a combination of all of these filters. Their properties (stability, sensitivity, round-off-noise, canonical/non-canonical and transposed forms, suitability for adaptive algorithms, etc.) are studied in experimental investigations. Illustrated examples are given, also showing the synthesis procedures...|$|R
40|$|The ill-conditioned inverse {{problem of}} {{estimating}} ultrasonic medium responses by deconvolution of RF signals is investigated. The primary {{difference between the}} proposed method and others is that the medium response function {{is assumed to be}} complex-valued rather than restricted to being real-valued. Derived from the complex medium model, complex Wiener filtering is presented, and a Hilbert transform related limitation to inverse <b>filtering</b> <b>type</b> methods is discussed. We introduce a non-parametric iterative algorithm, the least squares method with point count regularization (LSPC). The algorithm is successfully applied to simulated and experimental data and demonstrates the capability of recovering both the real and imaginary parts of the medium response. The simulation results indicate that the LSPC method can outperform Wiener filters and improve the resolution of the ultrasound system by factors as high as 3. 7. Experimental results using a single element transducer and a conventional medical ultrasound system with a linear array transducer show that, despite the errors in pulse estimation and the noise in the RF signals, excellent results can be obtained, demonstrating the stability and robustness of the algorithm...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In this paper, a {{cellular}} neural network (CNN) based locally adaptive scheme is presented for image segmentation and edge detection. It is shown that combining a constrained (linear or nonlinear) diffusion approach with adaptive morphology leads to a robust segmentation algorithm for an important class of image models. These images comprise of simple geometrical objects, each having a homogeneous gray-scale level and they might be overlapping. The background illumination is inhomogeneous, the objects are corrupted by additive Gaussian noise and possibly blurred by lowpass <b>filtering</b> <b>type</b> effects. Typically, this class has a multimodal (in most cases bimodal) image histogram and no special (easily exploitable) characteristics in the frequency domain. The synthesized analogic (analog and logic) CNN algorithm combines a diffusion-type filtering with a locally adaptive strategy based on estimating the first order (mean) and second order (variance) statistics. Both PDE and non-PDE related diffusion schemes are examined and compared in the CNN framework. It is shown that the proposed algorithm with various diffusion-type filters offers a more robust solution than some globally optimal thresholding schemes. All algorithmic steps are realized using nearest neighbor CNN templates. The VLSI implementation complexity and some robustness issues are carefully analyzed and discussed in detail. A number of tests has bee...|$|E

The only indigenous net, which can be compared in design with the modern bottom trawling gear, is the "Thuri Valai" of the Madras Coast. Prawns have also been reported from the catches of gill nets and cast nets. Dredges and beam trawls are simplest among the dragged gear. Even though several earlier attempts were made with the beam trawl, in 1959 season a detailed experiment was made to study the fishing features of this gear. The subsequent experiments conducted were for comparison with otter trawl, towing of 2 beam trawls one behind the other {{and the use of}} tickler chain. The initial experiments with otter trawls were mainly directed towards operational aspects.

40|$|We {{consider}} a large market model of defaultable assets {{in which the}} asset price processes are modelled as Heston-type stochastic volatility models with default upon hitting a lower boundary. We assume that both the asset prices and their volatilities are correlated through systemic Brownian motions. We {{are interested in the}} loss process that arises in this setting and we prove the existence of a large portfolio limit for the empirical measure process of this system. This limit evolves as a measure valued process and we show that it will have a density given in terms of a solution to a stochastic partial differential equation of <b>filtering</b> <b>type</b> in the two-dimensional half-space, with a Dirichlet boundary condition. We employ Malliavin calculus to establish the existence of a regular density for the volatility component, and an approximation by models of piecewise constant volatilities combined with a kernel smoothing technique to obtain existence and regularity for the full two-dimensional filtering problem. We are able to establish good regularity properties for solutions, however uniqueness remains an open problem. Comment: 1) We corrected a sign error that was giving a slightly different estimate. However, the uniqueness result cannot be obtained from the corrected estimate and we had to remove it. 2) Technical/standard proofs have been moved to an Appendix. 3) More issues are now addressed in the introduction and extra references have also been adde...|$|E
