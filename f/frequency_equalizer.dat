40|$|Abstract. A cyclic prefix of {{sufficient}} length is inserted (longer than the maximum delay {{spread of the}} channel) in Multi-Carrier CDMA (MC-CDMA) transmission over dispersive channels such that the channel, as seen by subcarrier, is a simple multiplicative distortion in the frequency domain, that can be compensated for by a one-tap <b>Frequency</b> <b>Equalizer</b> (FE). If, {{in addition to the}} spectral inefficiency caused by insertion of the cyclic prefix, the delay spread should exceed the designed prefix length, the FE will attempt to compensate for the mismatched signal model and the system performance will degrade significantly. In this paper, we derive a multi-input, multioutput (MIMO) model for received signal in synchronous MC-CDMA system over a multipath channel. Based on this model, a Frequency-Time MMSE Equalizer (FTE) is proposed. The performance of the FTE is studied as a function of key system parameters, such as prefix length and number of subcarriers, as well as sensitivity to channel estimation errors. The numerical result shows that system performance degradation due to insufficient guard time can be recovered with the FTE; i. e., full spectral efficiency can be achieved at the price of additional receiver complexity...|$|E

Both the need for frequency equalization {{and some of the}} considerations that {{must be taken into account}} in order to achieve this equalization are discussed. The particular method developed for achieving this equalization combines test signal generation, adaptive digital and analog filtering, and power spectrum estimation. This new method is called 'adaptive signal generation and filtering' (ASGF). The system designed to implement ASGF is called the 'automatic <b>frequency</b> <b>equalizer???</b> (AFE). Background theory of ASGF and the system design of the AFE for ASGF implementation are examined in detail. Although an actual AFE was not built, a computer simulation of the AFE was created in order to show that ASGF is a valid method for automatic frequency equalization in automobile environments. Simulation runs were made on both ideal data and real data collected from three different types of cars. These simulation runs are discussed in detail and do establish the viability of the ASGF approach. Finally, the thesis concludes with a discussion of possible improvements that could be made to both the ASGF approach and its AFE implementation...|$|E

40|$|To {{avoid the}} cost, large size, and {{complexity}} of going off-chip between individually packaged components, it is desirable to integrate as many components as possible. For on-chip passive filter design, size constraints and the quality factor {{limit the amount of}} attenuation that can be achieved. This work demonstrates the use of absorptive bandstop filters which gives anomalously deep notches for a given Q-factor. A lumped-element-only topology enables a realization on a chip for the first time. For reconfigurable RF front-ends, a frequency-agile design is newly developed with Q-tunable resonators because an absorptive bandstop filter must balance both intrinsic Q of the resonators and the resonant frequency of the filter. Despite using small-size, low-Q resonators in the bandstop filter design, a large stopband attenuation with a capability of frequency tuning is achieved with potential to suppress potential interference or an image frequency signal. Higher-order absorptive bandstop filters which give higher selectivity are also demonstrated. ^ The sensing of the unused bands is a pre-requisite and important function so that the cognitive radio system can track and use available frequencies. When the ultra-wideband ADC is utilized for sensing to find the unused bands or read the spectrum availability, both the high power interferences and small power signals are the signals we are interested, but the wideband ADC has a limited dynamic range. Since we have the signals with various frequencies and power levels, it is required to have something that can give different gains at different frequencies. This work proposes a <b>frequency</b> <b>equalizer</b> which gives selective attenuation at desired different frequencies, and absorptive bandstop filter with variable attenuation is proposed in this work. For a wide-band receiver or application, it is not typical for AGC to control different gain or attenuation levels at different frequencies. Using frequency selective attenuation, it is desirable in order to suppress a large signal before the signal compresses a wideband sampler, but still allowing us to receive and monitor the signal. ...|$|E
40|$|Estimating and {{removing}} noise from video signals {{is important to}} increase either the visual quality of video signals or the performance of video processing algorithms such as compression or segmentation where noise estimation or reduction is a pre-processing step. To estimate and remove noise, effective methods use both spatial and temporal information to increase the reliability of signal extraction from noise. The objective of this thesis is to introduce a video system having three novel techniques to estimate and reduce video noise from different sources, both effectively and efficiently and assess video quality without considering a reference non-noisy video. The first (intensity-variances based homogeneity classification) technique estimates visual noise of different types in images and video signals. The noise can be white Gaussian noise, mixed Poissonian- Gaussian (signal-dependent white) noise, or processed (frequency-dependent) noise. The method {{is based on the}} classification of intensity-variances of signal patches in order to find homogeneous regions that best represent the noise signal in the input signal. The method assumes that noise is signal-independent in each intensity class. To find homogeneous regions, the method works on the downsampled input image and divides it into patches. Each patch is assigned to an intensity class, whereas outlier patches are rejected. Then the most homogeneous cluster is selected and its noise variance is considered as the peak of noise variance. To account for processed noise, we estimate the degree of spatial correlation. To account for temporal noise variations a stabilization process is proposed. We show that the proposed method competes related state-of-the-art in noise estimation. The second technique provides solutions to remove real-world camera noise such as signal-independent, signal-dependent noise, and frequency-dependent noise. Firstly, we propose a noise equalization method in intensity and frequency domain which enables a white Gaussian noise filter to handle real noise. Our experiments confirm the quality improvement under real noise while white Gaussian noise filter is used with our equalization method. Secondly, we propose a band-limited time-space video denoiser which reduces video noise of different types. This denoiser consists of: 1) intensity-domain noise equalization to account for signal dependency, 2) band-limited anti-blocking time-domain filtering of current frame using motion-compensated previous and subsequent frames, 3) spatial filtering combined with noise <b>frequency</b> <b>equalizer</b> to remove residual noise left from temporal filtering, and 4) intensity de-equalization to invert the first step. To decrease the chance of motion blur, temporal weights are calculated using two levels of error estimation; coarse (blocklevel) and fine (pixel-level). We correct the erroneous motion vectors by creating a homography from reliable motion vectors. To eliminate blockiness in block-based temporal filter, we propose three ideas: interpolation of block-level error, a band-limited filtering by subtracting the back-signal beforehand, and two-band motion compensation. The proposed time-space filter is parallelizable to be significantly accelerated by GPU. We show that the proposed method competes related state-ofthe- art in video denoising. The third (sparsity and dominant orientation quality index) technique is a new method to assess the quality of the denoised video frames without a reference (clean frames). In many image and video applications, a quantitative measure of image content, noise, and blur is required to facilitate quality assessment, when the ground-truth is not available. We propose a fast method to find the dominant orientation of image patches, which is used to decompose them into singular values. Combining singular values with the sparsity of the patch in the transform domain, we measure the possible image content and noise of the patches and of the whole image. To measure the effect of noise accurately, our method takes both low and high textured patches into account. Before analyzing the patches, we apply a shrinkage in the transform domain to increase the contrast of genuine image structure. We show that the proposed method is useful to select parameters of denoising algorithms automatically in different noise scenarios such as white Gaussian and real noise. Our objective and subjective results confirm the correspondence between the measured quality and the ground-truth and proposed method rivals related state-of-the-art approaches...|$|E
