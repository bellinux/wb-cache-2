6000|$|Mr. and Mrs. Snagsby are {{not only}} one bone and one flesh, but, to the neighbours' thinking, one voice too. That voice, {{appearing}} to proceed from Mrs. Snagsby alone, is heard in Cook's Court very often. Mr. Snagsby, otherwise than as he finds expression through these dulcet tones, is rarely heard. He is a mild, bald, timid man with a shining head and a scrubby clump of black hair sticking out at the back. He tends to meekness and obesity. As he stands at his door in Cook's Court in his grey shop-coat and black calico sleeves, {{looking up at the}} clouds, or stands behind a desk in his dark shop with a heavy <b>flat</b> <b>ruler,</b> snipping and slicing at sheepskin in company with his two 'prentices, he is emphatically a retiring and unassuming man. From beneath his feet, at such times, as from a shrill ghost unquiet in its grave, there frequently arise complainings and lamentations in the voice already mentioned; and haply, on some occasions when these reach a sharper pitch than usual, Mr. Snagsby mentions to the 'prentices, [...] "I think my little woman is a-giving it to Guster!" ...|$|E
5000|$|Coignet invented several {{instruments}} and corresponded with Galileo Galilei (from 1588), Gerhard Mercator, Godefroy Wendelin, Ludolph van Ceulen and Fabrizio Mordente, {{whom he met}} during the latter’s 1584 sojourn in Antwerp. Among other things, Coignet invented and described instruments that had a function {{similar to that of}} the proportional compass. [...] During the dispute over the invention of the proportional compass in 1610, Giovanni Camillo Gloriosi attributed the invention to Coignet and not to Galileo, although the instrument is now mainly attributed to Coignet’s friend Mordente. [...] Coignet distributed the computational functions over several bars and described the instrument in several treatises: on the <b>flat</b> <b>ruler</b> (Traité des Sinus, 1610); flat-legged proportional compasses (De regulae pantometae, 1612); and four-point proportional compasses (El uso del compas proportional, 1618).|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND—To {{be certain}} that the joint space width is {{abnormal}} {{in the case of}} hip joint pain when compared with the contralateral hip requires knowledge of physiological dissymmetry.  AIM OF THE STUDY—To assess interindividual variability and dissymmetry in pelvic radiological joint space width.  METHODS—Pelvic radiographs of subjects without hip joint disease. Measurement with a 0. 1  mm graduated magnifying glass and 0. 5  mm graduated <b>flat</b> <b>ruler</b> at the hip superointermediate site (vertical going through the femoral head centre). After randomisation of the side to measure, analysis of nine groups of 19  plain films by one investigator blind for the result of the contralateral side.  RESULTS—The difference between the left and right hip was plotted against the corresponding mean for all 171  normal subjects This shows the frequency and the limits of the asymmetry at each measurement site. The asymmetry is independent of interindividual variability of the joint space width and greater than the measurement error in most subjects.  CONCLUSION—This study confirms the interindividual variability of hip joint space width, shows the frequency of hip joint space asymmetry and defines its limit.    Keywords: hip joint; joint space width; measuremen...|$|E

30|$|The trays were {{consistently}} filled {{using the same}} procedure, in order to reproduce the same target density. This filling procedure consisted in the pouring of simulant material into the tray using a funnel, followed by the leveling of the surface using a <b>flat</b> metal <b>ruler.</b> We measured the porosities of targets produced in this manner in the laboratory (30 times) by filling the tray using this procedure, then measuring {{the mass of the}} target material using a scale. Knowing the container volume and the bulk density of the grains, we determined target porosities consistently ranging from 0.4 to 0.5. While the compaction level of fine grains at the surface of asteroids is not well determined, the bulk porosity of “rubble-pile” asteroids was estimated to be of this order by Britt et al. (2002), indicating that such porosity levels are relevant for the study of low-velocity impacts on asteroid surfaces.|$|R
50|$|A dome-top trunk has a high, curved {{top that}} can rise up to heights of 25 - 30 in. A variety of {{construction}} methods—including curfing, molded ply, barrel construction, and so forth—were used {{to form the}} inner boxes. Included in this classification are camel-backs, which are distinguished by having a central, vertically running top slat that is higher than its fellows, hunch-backs or hump-backs {{which is the same}} but has no slat {{in the center of the}} top, and barrel-tops (not to be confused with barrel staves), which have high arching slats that are all the same height, a distinction that can be discerned by laying a <b>ruler</b> <b>flat</b> across the tops of the slats. These trunks date from 1870s-1900s, although there are a few shops still manufacturing them today. They are not only the most commonly trunks referred to as antique, but also are among the most popular.|$|R
