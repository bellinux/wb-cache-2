Twenty serum samples mere obtained from 12 neutropenic patients including 6 with invasive aspergillosis. These samples were blinded and sent to each center together with eight blinded ELISA-negative serum samples spiked with known concentrations of galactomannan. The centers were provided with ELISA microtiter plates from a single batch and a detailed protocol. Ten clinical samples showed ELISA reactivity, while 10 samples were ELISA negative. The mean coefficient of variation (CV) of the optical density values was 4. 24 % within a single assay and 25. 6 % between runs.

We conducted a multicenter study to evaluate the intralaboratory and <b>interlaboratory</b> <b>reproducibilities</b> of a method that uses agitation to disperse these types of growth. Ten strains of Candida albicans and five strains of Cryptococcus neoformans were tested against fluconazole, flucytosine, and amphotericin B by using a microdilution adaptation of the proposed reference method of the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards for yeasts (M 27 -T). The endpoint criterion used before agitation {{was consistent with the}} M 27 -T recommendation, while a criterion of 50 % or more reduction of growth compared with the control was used after agitation. The results of this study showed that use of agitation and the modified endpoint criterion both improved intralaboratory and inter-laboratory agreement and increased the frequency of interpretable MICs. The MICs obtained by this method were comparable to those obtained by the broth macrodilution M 27 -T method. Like M 27 -T, this method was not able to definitely distinguish amphotericin B-susceptible from -resistant strains, although the MICs for the resistant strains were consistently higher than those for the susceptible ones.

We analyzed human samples in six laboratories using different instrumentation but a common protocol (the AbsoluteIDQ p 180 kit) for the measurement of 189 metabolites via liquid chromatography (LC) or flow injection analysis (FIA) coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). In spiked quality control (QC) samples 82 % of metabolite measurements had an interlaboratory precision of < 20 %, while 83 % of averaged individual laboratory measurements were accurate to within 20 %. For 20 typical biological samples (serum and plasma from healthy individuals) the median interlaboratory coefficient of variation (CV) was 7. 6 %, with 85 % of metabolites exhibiting a median interlaboratory CV of < 20 %. Precision was largely independent of the type of sample (serum or plasma) or the anticoagulant used but was reduced in a sample from a patient with dyslipidaemia. The median interlaboratory accuracy and precision of the assay for standard reference plasma (NIST SRM 1950) were 107 % and 6. 7 %, respectively. Likely sources of irreproducibility were the near limit of detection (LOD) typical abundance of some metabolites and the degree of manual review and optimization of peak integration in the LC–MS/MS data after acquisition. Normalization to a reference material was crucial for the semi-quantitative FIA measurements. This is the first interlaboratory assessment of a widely used, targeted metabolomics assay illustrating the reproducibility of the protocol and how data generated on different instruments could be directly integrated in large-scale epidemiological studies...|$|R

The various criteria used to select the maximum tolerated dose are described. A comparison of historical control data across laboratories confirmed reasonably good <b>interlaboratory</b> <b>reproducibility.</b> With a reliance on apical endpoints, interpretation of pubertal assay effects as specif-ically endocrine-mediated or secondary to other systemic effects can be problematic and mode of action may be difficult to discern.

40|$|This study {{examines}} formally {{the proposition that}} validation of analytical procedures can be best undertaken by interlaboratory study. It approaches the task by considering the fundamental nature of validation {{and the meaning of}} ‘procedure’ in relation to uncertainty. The contention is that (a) only procedures as such can be validated, (b) the results of a procedure are empirical, (c) empirical procedures are unbiased, and (d) the <b>interlaboratory</b> <b>reproducibility</b> standard deviation (SDR) associated with an unbiased procedure is an unbiased estimate of the uncertainty. The definitive interlaboratory study for estimating SDR is the collaborative trial, but the case is made that, with due caution, data from proficiency tests can also provide useful estimates of SDR and thence estimates of uncertainty...|$|E
40|$|Molecular {{genotyping}} of M. tuberculosis is {{an important}} laboratory tool {{in the context of}} emerging drug resistant TB. The standard 24 -loci MIRU-VNTR typing includes PCR amplification followed by the detection and sizing of PCR fragments using capillary electrophoresis on automated sequencers or using agarose gels. The QIAxcel Advanced system might offer a cost-effective medium-throughput alternative. Performance characteristics of the QIAxcel Advanced platform for the standard 24 VNTR loci panel was evaluated at two centres on a total of 140 DNA specimens using automated capillary electrophoresis as a reference method. Additionally 4 hypervariable MIRU-VNTR loci were evaluated on 53 crude DNA extracts. The sizing accuracy, <b>interlaboratory</b> <b>reproducibility</b> and overall instrument's performance were assessed during the study. An overall concordance with the reference method was high reaching 98. 5 % and 97. 6 % for diluted genomic and crude DNA extracts respectively. 91. 4 % of all discrepancies were observed in fragments longer than 700 bp. The concordance for hypervariable loci was lower except for locus 4120 (96. 2 %). The <b>interlaboratory</b> <b>reproducibility</b> agreement rates were 98. 9 % and 91. 3 % for standard and hypervariable loci, respectively. Overall performance of the QIAxcel platform for M. tuberculosis genotyping using a panel of standard loci is comparable to that of established methods for PCR fragments up to 700 bp. Inaccuracies in sizing of longer fragments could be resolved through using in-house size markers or introduction of offset values. To conclude, the QiaXcel system could be considered an effective alternative to existing methods in smaller reference and regional laboratories offering good performance and shorter turnaround times...|$|E
40|$|Interest in lateral-flow devices (LFDs) as {{potential}} point-of-care assays for {{the diagnosis of}} infectious diseases has increased. Our objective was to evaluate the <b>interlaboratory</b> and interstudy <b>reproducibility</b> {{and the effects of}} antifungal therapy on an LFD de-veloped for invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) detection. An established neutropenic guinea pig model of IPA caused by Aspergillus fumigatuswas used. At predetermined time points (1 h and 3, 5, and 7 days postinoculation), blood and bronchoal-veolar lavage (BAL) fluid were collected from infected and uninfected animals. In a separate experiment, guinea pigs were treated with posaconazole (10 mg/kg of body weight orally [p. o. ] twice a day [BID]), voriconazole (10 mg/kg p. o. BID), liposomal am-photericin B (10 mg/kg intraperitoneally [i. p. ] once a day [QD]), or caspofungin (2 mg/kg i. p. QD), and samples were collected on days 7 and 11. Each laboratory independently evaluated the IgGmonoclonal antibody-based LFD. Galactomannan and (1 ¡ 3) [...] D-glucan were also measured using commercially available kits. Good interlaboratory agreement was observed with the LFD, as the results for 97 % (32 / 33) of the serum and 78. 8 % (26 / 33) of the BAL fluid samples from infected animals were in agreement. Good interstudy agreement was also observed. The serum sensitivity of each surrogate-marker assay was reduced in animals treated with antifungals. In contrast, these markers remained elevated within the BAL fluids of treated animals, which was consistent with the fungal burden and histopathology results. These results demonstrate that the LFD assay is reproducible between different laboratories and studies. However, the sensitivity of this assay and other markers of IPAmay be reduced with serum in the presence of antifungal therapy...|$|R
40|$|Iwas {{interested}} {{to read the}} paper by N. P. Wiederhold andcolleagues published in the November 2012 issue of the Jour-nal of Clinical Microbiology (1). The authors aimed to deter-mine <b>interlaboratory</b> and interstudy <b>reproducibility</b> {{as well as to}} assess the effect of antifungal therapy on a lateral-flow device (LFD) developed for invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) detection. They reported a good interlaboratory agreement (LFD result agreement, 97 % [32 / 33] of the serum and 78. 8 % [26 / 33] of the BAL samples from infected animals) and a good interstudy agreement (1). Such a descriptive result {{has nothing to do with}} reliability and actually is one of the common mis-takes in reliability analysis (2 – 6). Moreover, Wiederhold et al. reported that the serum sensitiv-ity of each surrogate marker assay was reduced in animals treated with antifungals. In contrast, the markers remained elevated within the BAL fluids of treated animals, demonstrating that the results of the LFD assay are reproducible between different labo-ratories and studies (1). Sensitivity is one of the seven well-known statistical estimates for validity (diagnostic accuracy) analysis and should not be used for reliability purposes (2 – 6). Why did the authors not use well-known intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) or weighted kappa values to assess reliability (2 – 6) ? Reliability and validity are two completely different method-ological issues in research. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predic-tive values, negative predictive values, likelihood ratios of positive results (true positive/false positive), and likelihood ratios of neg-ative results (false negative/true negative) as well as odds ratios (true resultsfalse results, preferably more than 50) and diagnostic accuracy are among the tests to evaluate the validity (accuracy) of a single test compared with a gold standard (5, 6). As a take-home message, for reliability and validity, appropriate statistical tests should be applied. ACKNOWLEDGMENT...|$|R
40|$|The Brazilian {{network for}} {{genotyping}} {{is composed of}} 21 laboratories that perform and analyze genotyping tests for all HIV-infected patients within the public system, performing approximately 25, 000 tests per year. We assessed the <b>interlaboratory</b> and intralaboratory <b>reproducibility</b> of genotyping systems by creating and implementing a local external quality control evaluation. Plasma samples from HIV- 1 -infected individuals (with low and intermediate viral loads) or RNA viral constructs with specific mutations were used. This evaluation included analyses of sensitivity and specificity of the tests based on qualitative and quantitative criteria, which scored laboratory performance on a 100 -point system. Five evaluations were performed from 2003 to 2008, with 64 % of laboratories scoring over 80 points in 2003, 81 % doing so in 2005, 56 % in 2006, 91 % in 2007, and 90 % in 2008 (Kruskal-Wallis, p = 0. 003). Increased performance was aided by retraining laboratories that had specific deficiencies. The results {{emphasize the importance of}} investing in laboratory training and interpretation of DNA sequencing results, especially in developing countries where public (or scarce) resources are used to manage the AIDS epidemic. The group of Brazilian and international experts who prepared the local algorithm used for interpretation of HIV resistance is made up of: Cláudia Cortese Barreto (University of São Paulo, Brazil), Ricardo Sobhie Diaz (Federal University of São Paulo, Brazil), José Carlos Couto Fernandez (Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, Brazil), Robert M Grant (University of California at San Francisco and Gladstone Institute of Virology and Immunology, USA), Beatriz Grinstein (Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, Brazil), Brigitte Montes (Laboratoire de Virologie/Hopital Saint-Eloi, France), Monica Jacques de Moraes (University of Campinas, Brazil), Ester Cerdeira Sabino (Fundação Pró Sangue de São Paulo, Brazil), Maria Cecilia Araripe Sucupira (Federal University of São Paulo, Brazil) and Amilcar Tanuri (Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil) ...|$|R
