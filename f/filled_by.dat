The remaining twelve positions were <b>filled</b> <b>by</b> continental qualifying tournaments. Positions were <b>filled</b> <b>by</b> three teams from the Americas, one from Asia, one from Africa, three from Europe and two from Oceania. Another two places were allocated for repechage. The first repechage place was determined by a match between the runners-up from the Africa and Europe qualifying tournaments, with that winner then playing the Americas runner-up to determine the place. The second repechage position was determined between the runners-up from the Asia and Oceania qualifiers.|$|E
