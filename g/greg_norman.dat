5|$|During this period, no golfer {{suffered}} from the pressure of competing at Augusta more than <b>Greg</b> <b>Norman.</b> In 1987, Norman lost a sudden-death playoff to Larry Mize when Mize holed out a remarkable 45-yard pitch shot to birdie the second playoff hole and win the Masters. In 1996, Norman tied the course record with an opening round 63, and had a six-stroke lead over Nick Faldo entering the final round. Norman shot a 78 while Faldo scored a 67 to win by five shots (for his third Masters championship). Norman also suffered in 1986 when after birdieing four straight holes, and needing only a par to tie Nicklaus for the lead and force a Monday playoff, he badly pushed his 4-iron approach on 18 and missed his par putt for a closing bogey.|$|E
5|$|The Overseas Personality {{award was}} first {{presented}} in 1960, {{six years after}} the BBC Sports Personality of the Year award was introduced. The first recipient of the award was Australian middle distance runner Herb Elliott. Since then, the award has been presented to 49 sportspersons. American boxer Muhammad Ali, Swiss tennis player Roger Federer and Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt have each won the award three times, while Australian golfer <b>Greg</b> <b>Norman</b> won the award twice. The award has been shared on three occasions—by Ron Clarke and Gary Player in 1965, Eusébio and Garfield Sobers in 1966, and Evander Holyfield and Michael Johnson in 1996. The husband-and-wife skating duo of Oleg Protopopov and Ludmila Belousova are the only pair to have won the award, doing so in 1968. Belousova {{was the first woman}} to become Overseas Personality—she was also the oldest, aged 33. George Moore is the oldest recipient of the award, winning in 1967 aged 44. The youngest recipient of the award is Nadia Comăneci, who won in 1976 at age 15. Boris Becker, who was 18 when he won in 1985, is the youngest male to have won.|$|E

25|$|Faldo {{was named}} the PGA Tour Player of the Year in 1990 and the European Tour Player of the Year in 1989, 1990 and 1992, and has won 29 European Tour titles.

25|$|On 26 January 2008, the Rabbitohs {{played the}} Leeds Rhinos at the Hodges Stadium at University of North Florida in Jacksonville, Florida, {{the first time}} first-grade {{professional}} rugby league teams from Australia and England played {{each other in the}} United States. A crowd of about 12,000 attended with Russell Crowe, <b>Greg</b> <b>Norman,</b> and the stars of television show American Chopper among the audience. Leeds Rhinos won the game 26-24 (after having been behind 26-0 at half-time South Sydney staged an unlikely comeback that fell agonisingly short).|$|E
25|$|Nobilo {{played for}} the International Team {{in each of the}} first three Presidents Cups (1994, 1996, 1998).

25|$|For much of {{the early}} 1990s, Faldo was {{considered}} the best golfer in the world. He spent a total of 97 weeks altogether {{at the top of}} the Official World Golf Ranking, an achievement surpassed by only one other competitor, <b>Greg</b> <b>Norman,</b> during the decade of the 1990s. His total of six professional major tournament wins were more than any other player in the world from 1987 through 1996. (Nick Price was second with three major victories during this period; Seve Ballesteros won five majors from 1979 to 1988).|$|E
25|$|It's been {{suggested}} that during his career Faldo wore down the opposition and benefited from other players making mistakes in pressure-filled situations. His three Masters titles at Augusta came after mistakes by Scott Hoch missing a short putt in 1989, Raymond Floyd hitting an approach shot into a pond in 1990 and from a collapse by <b>Greg</b> <b>Norman</b> {{in the final round}} in 1996. Two of Faldo's Open Championship wins came after mistakes in the closing two holes by Paul Azinger in 1987 and John Cook in 1992. Nevertheless, Faldo earns credit for the way in which he performed under pressure in his major victories.|$|E
25|$|The Packer family {{accepted}} {{an offer of}} a state memorial service, which was held on 17 February 2006 at the Sydney Opera House. The granting of this taxpayer-funded honour was criticised by {{some members of the}} community as Packer was famous for his tax minimisation. At the memorial service, close friend Alan Jones was Master of Ceremonies; the service featured speeches from son and heir James, Russell Crowe on behalf of daughter Gretel Packer, Prime Minister John Howard and Richie Benaud. Attendees included Tom Cruise (a friend of James Packer) and his then partner Katie Holmes, <b>Greg</b> <b>Norman,</b> members of the Australian cricket team, and past and present figures from both sides of politics.|$|E
25|$|Els {{has often}} been {{compared}} to <b>Greg</b> <b>Norman</b> {{in the sense that}} both men’s careers could be looked back on and think what could have been. Although the two of them are multiple major championship winners they have both shared disappointment in majors. Their disappointments have ranged from nerves, bad luck and simply being outplayed. 1996 was the year where Norman collapsed in the Masters, whereas the year before Els did in the PGA Championship. Els has finished runner-up in six majors. He has finished runner-up to Tiger Woods more than any other golfer and {{has often been}} described as having the right game to finally be the golfer to beat Woods in a major.|$|E
25|$|Calm {{and sunny}} weather {{provided}} good scoring {{conditions for the}} opening round. Miguel Ángel Jiménez took the lead at 64 (−6), and past champions turned back the clock: five-time winner Tom Watson, age 59, carded a bogey-free 65, and both Mark Calcavecchia (1989, age 49) and Mark O'Meara (1998, 52) shot 67. Ben Curtis, 2003 champion, also opened with 65 to join Watson and Kenichi Kuboya, who was even par through 14 holes, but finished birdie, birdie, eagle, birdie. Steve Stricker, Stewart Cink, and Camilo Villegas started strong at 66, and notables at 67 included Calcavecchia, O'Meara, Retief Goosen, Jim Furyk, Mike Weir, and Vijay Singh. Two-time defending champion Pádraig Harrington had a quiet 69, while Tiger Woods struggled off the tee for 71. Two-time champion <b>Greg</b> <b>Norman,</b> the previous year's Cinderella story, had a disappointing 77.|$|E
25|$|In July 1993, Faldo won the Carroll's Irish Open for an {{unprecedented}} {{third time in}} a row. Starting his final round four shots behind José María Olazábal, Faldo's fourth round of 65 enabled him to tie over 72 holes with Olazábal. Faldo won the sudden death playoff at the first extra hole. Later that month, as defending Open champion, Faldo {{was involved in a}} memorable duel with rival <b>Greg</b> <b>Norman</b> in the Open Championship at Royal St George's Golf Club. Starting his final round one shot ahead of Norman, Faldo hit a tee shot on the par-3 11th which appeared to be heading for a hole in one, but the ball hit the cup and rolled away. Faldo played some excellent golf in his final round of 67, but he finished runner-up, two strokes behind Norman, who shot a spectacular final round of 64.|$|E
