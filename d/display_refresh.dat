50|$|Nvidia and AMD video {{adapters}} {{provide an}} 'Adaptive Vsync' option. This will only turn on vertical synchronization when the frame {{rate of the}} software exceeds the <b>display's</b> <b>refresh</b> rate, disabling it otherwise. This eliminates the stutter that occurs as the rendering engine frame rate drops below the <b>display's</b> <b>refresh</b> rate.|$|R
50|$|Alternatively, {{technologies}} like FreeSync and G-Sync reverse the concept, adapting the <b>display's</b> <b>refresh</b> rate {{to the content}} coming from the computer. These technologies require specific support from both the video adapter and the display.|$|R

50|$|In computing, indexed {{color is}} a {{technique}} to manage digital images' colors in a limited fashion, {{in order to save}} computer memory and file storage, while speeding up <b>display</b> <b>refresh</b> and file transfers. It is a form of vector quantization compression.|$|E
50|$|A media processor, mostly used as {{an image}} / video processor, is a {{microprocessor-based}} system-on-a-chip {{which is designed to}} deal with digital streaming data in real-time (e.g. <b>display</b> <b>refresh)</b> rates.

50|$|The {{artifact}} {{occurs when}} the video feed to the device is not {{in sync with the}} <b>display's</b> <b>refresh</b> rate. This can be due to non-matching refresh rates—in which case the tear line moves as the phase difference changes (with speed proportional to difference of frame rates). It can also occur simply from lack of sync between two equal frame rates, in which case the tear line is at a fixed location that corresponds to the phase difference. During video motion, screen tearing creates a torn look as edges of objects (such as a wall or a tree) fail to line up.|$|R

Each colored section {{represents one of the}} GPU's frame buffer and each color change represents a frame buffer swap. Assuming a 60 Hz refresh rate, a benchmark tool may report this as 144 frames per second. However, the user will perceive less due to some frames existing for a tiny fraction of a display's refresh cycle.|$|E

It was the defending AFC Champs versus the NFC runners-up, and the Bears endured 20-17, despite Tomczak throwing an interception on his first pass attempt of the season. Defensive lineman Dan Hampton, playing in his 11th season, sacked Bengal quarterback Boomer Esiason twice and blocked a field goal attempt. He also <b>displayed</b> <b>refreshing</b> candor in his postgame interview.

50|$|It {{is similar}} to TripleHead2Go, except it {{supports}} only 2 displays. When setting output to 1024x768 per <b>display,</b> the <b>refresh</b> rate {{can be set up}} to 85 Hz. It has maximum resolution of 2560×1024@60 Hz (1280×1024 each). It was later renamed to DualHead2Go Analog Edition.|$|R

50|$|Several of the inputs were {{directly}} wired to specific registers {{in order to}} allow the hardware to do some of the heavy lifting. For example, the light-pen input would directly halt a counter which was started by the start of the vertical sweep of each <b>display</b> <b>refresh,</b> making calculation of where the lightpen was touching the screen little more than a simple divide/remainder operation. Likewise, the motor control relay for the audio cassette tape was controlled by a simple command and could be readily used in numerous control applications.|$|E
5000|$|Figure 6 {{illustrates}} {{a classic example}} of a crosscutting concern in a figure editor example taken from the AOSD literature [...]The example describes an abstract Shape class that can be moved in the editor.Whenever a shape is moved, the display needs to be refreshed. Figure 6 also depicts two Shape subclasses, Line and Point that implement the Shape functionality. The <b>display</b> <b>refresh</b> concern is scattered across the implementation of both subclasses. Figure 7 represents an aspect-oriented implementation of the same system, where an aspect encapsulates the display updating functionality.|$|E
50|$|CHIP-8 {{was most}} {{commonly}} implemented on 4K systems, {{such as the}} Cosmac VIP and the Telmac 1800. These machines had 4096 (0x1000) memory locations, {{all of which are}} 8 bits (a byte) which is where the term CHIP-8 originated. However, the CHIP-8 interpreter itself occupies the first 512 bytes of the memory space on these machines. For this reason, most programs written for the original system begin at memory location 512 (0x200) and do not access any of the memory below the location 512 (0x200). The uppermost 256 bytes (0xF00-0xFFF) are reserved for <b>display</b> <b>refresh,</b> and the 96 bytes below that (0xEA0-0xEFF) were reserved for call stack, internal use, and other variables.|$|E

5000|$|Oculus began {{shipping}} Development Kit 2 (DK2) in July 2014. This {{is a small}} {{refinement of}} the [...] "Crystal Cove" [...] prototype, featuring several key improvements over the first development kit, such as having a higher-resolution (960×1080 per eye) low-persistence OLED <b>display,</b> higher <b>refresh</b> rate, positional tracking, a detachable cable, and the omission {{of the need for}} the external control box.|$|R
50|$|The {{earliest}} {{computer graphics}} systems, {{like those of}} the TX-2 and DEC PDP-1, required the entire attention of the computer to maintain. A list of vectors stored in main memory was periodically read out to the <b>display</b> to <b>refresh</b> it before the image faded. This generally occurred frequently enough that there was little time to do anything else, and interactive systems like Spacewar! were tour-de-force programming efforts.|$|R
50|$|Core Video {{provides}} both a buffering {{model and}} a playback synchronization solution within its processing pipeline. A video source provides a decompressed data stream to be rendered as images within a visual context in Quartz 2D. Core Video {{can be thought}} of as the link between this video source and its display context. Rendered images can be further processed by Core Image before being composed into a final scene with Quartz Compositor. As part of the composition process, Core Video maintains a frame buffer, keeping a pool of rendered, composed frames ready for playback. To ensure smooth playback, Core Video uses a high-priority thread to maintain its frame buffer. This display link runs independently from the application which invokes video playback, and it compensates for different <b>display</b> <b>refresh</b> rates and latency.|$|E
50|$|For a fixed bandwidth, {{interlace}} {{provides a}} video signal with twice the <b>display</b> <b>refresh</b> rate {{for a given}} line count (versus progressive scan video at a similar frame rate—for instance 1080i at 60 half-frames per second, vs. 1080p at 30 full frames per second). The higher refresh rate improves the appearance of an object in motion, because it updates its position on the display more often, and when an object is stationary, human vision combines information from multiple similar half-frames to produce the same perceived resolution as that provided by a progressive full frame. This technique is only useful though, if source material is available in higher refresh rates. Cinema movies are typically recorded at 24fps, and therefore don't benefit from interlacing, a solution which reduces the maximum video bandwidth to 5MHz without reducing the effective picture scan rate of 50Hz.|$|E
50|$|A similar process occurs for the {{vertical}} scan, {{but at the}} <b>display</b> <b>refresh</b> rate (typically 50 to 75 Hz). A complete field starts with a polarity that would place the beams beyond {{the top of the}} visible area, with {{the vertical}} component of the deflection field at maximum. After some tens of horizontal scans (but with the beams blanked), the vertical component of the unblank, combined with the horizontal unblank, permits the beams to show the first scan line. Once the last scan line is written, the vertical component of the magnetic field continues to increase by the equivalent of a few percent of the total height before the vertical retrace takes place. Vertical retrace is comparatively slow, occurring over a span of time required for several tens of horizontal scans. In analog CRT TVs, setting brightness to maximum typically made the vertical retrace visible as zigzag lines on the picture.|$|E
50|$|On {{cathode ray}} tube (CRT) <b>displays,</b> {{increasing}} the <b>refresh</b> rate decreases flickering, thereby reducing eye strain. However, if a refresh rate is specified that is beyond what is recommended for the display, damage to the display can occur.|$|R
50|$|AMOLED <b>displays</b> provide higher <b>refresh</b> {{rates than}} passive-matrix, often {{reducing}} the response time {{to less than}} a millisecond, and they consume significantly less power. This advantage makes active-matrix OLEDs well-suited for portable electronics, where power consumption is critical to battery life.|$|R

50|$|Alto both blurred {{and ignored}} {{the lines between}} {{functional}} elements. Rather than a distinct central processing unit with a well-defined electrical interface (e.g., system bus) to storage and peripherals, the Alto ALU interacts directly with hardware interfaces to memory and peripherals, driven by microinstructions output from the control store. The microcode machine supports up to 16 cooperative tasks, each with fixed priority. The emulator task executes the normal instruction set to which most applications are written; that instruction set is similar to, but not the same as, that of a Data General Nova. Others tasks serve the display, memory refresh, disk, network, and other I/O functions. As an example, the bitmap display controller {{is little more than}} a 16-bit shift register; microcode moves <b>display</b> <b>refresh</b> data from main memory to the shift register, which serializes it into a display of pixels corresponding to the ones and zeros of the memory data. Ethernet is likewise supported by minimal hardware, with a shift register that acts bidirectionally to serialize output words and deserialize input words. Its speed was designed to be 3 Mbit/s because the microcode engine could not go faster and continue to support the video display, disk activity and memory refresh.|$|E
50|$|To {{keep the}} price of the {{computer}} and the component count down, a novel technique was used to implement the video display. Instead of an expensive video display controller chip with dedicated memory, the Super-80 used discrete TTL logic to implement the video display and 512 bytes of system RAM was shared between the video display and the CPU. Fifty times per second, the CPU was turned off for around 10 ms by asserting the Z80 BUSREQ (DMA) pin. The video display circuitry would then read from the shared RAM while it refreshed the image on the screen. In addition to a 50% degradation in processor performance, this meant that {{it was not possible to}} perform any accurate timing in software, since the programmer had no control over when the next video <b>display</b> <b>refresh</b> cycle would occur. The video display could be switched off under software control for greater processing speed, or when accurate software timing was required. The most common situation in which that occurred was when the built-in cassette interface was being used. The location of the 512 bytes of video memory was normally at the top of the available RAM, but could be changed by writing to an I/O port.|$|E
5000|$|In many cases, {{frequent}} {{computer users}} suffer from computer vision syndrome, {{which is a}} degenerative eye problem which can result in severely reduced eyesight (Myopia), blurred vision, overall eye tiredness and even Glaucoma. Computer Eye Syndrome is an umbrella term for many problems but the causes of these problems can be easily identified. When using a computer due to the size and setup of the monitor and components {{it is necessary for}} the user to be within at least two feet of the monitor when performing any type of computational work. This presents many problems especially in older monitors due to an elevated amount of monitor glare, poor display quality and insufficient picture <b>display</b> <b>refresh</b> rates. Although these problems are more evident in older computers the newer models are not free from these problems either. Studies have been conducted [...] They state “Treatment requires a multidirectional approach combining ocular therapy with adjustment of the workstation” which shows these problems are quite easily solved with minimal investment from computer manufacturers through producing higher quality monitors with better resolution and refresh rates. The most common form of Computer Vision Syndrome is a condition termed Dry Eye, which results in itchy, sore and even the illusion that something is stuck in your eye. This condition is often caused by extensively long period looking at a computer screen.|$|E

50|$|The monitor was a 14-inch {{monochrome}} vector <b>display,</b> continually <b>refreshed</b> {{from local}} memory. Its normal resolution was 1024 by 1024 addressable points, and 2K x 2K in small-font scaling mode. The CRT electron beam moved freely in X and Y position and angle under program control to draw individual sloped lines and letter forms, {{much like the}} pen-on-paper motions of a pen plotter. The beam skipped blank areas of the screen. Things could be drawn in arbitrary order.|$|R
5000|$|The VDU Expansion Board (VDUEB) was an {{enhanced}} video display {{board for the}} Super-80 developed by Microcomputer Engineering (MCE). The VDUEB gave the Super-80 an 80×25 video display with limited graphics capabilities. It {{was based on a}} 6845 CRTC I.C. and had its own 2kB of video RAM and 2kB of character generator RAM. Installation of the VDUEB board was a one-way process, as it required major modifications to the Super-80 printed circuit board including cutting of tracks and soldering in many wire links between various parts of the board. The VDUEB was then connected via three I.C. sockets formerly occupied by the original video display circuitry. Removal of the original DMA based video display effectively doubled the performance of the computer, since the CPU was no longer being disabled 50 times per second for video <b>display</b> <b>refreshes.</b> The board gave the Super-80 similar video display capabilities to the Applied Technology Microbee computer, released about six months after the Super-80. This led to many Microbee games being ported to the VDUEB equipped Super-80. The VDUEB proved to be a popular modification, with a users' group forming for owners of VDUEB equipped computers - The [...] "Super-80 VDUEB Users' Club".|$|R
