[...] Finally, Andy Argyrakis of Today's Christian Music negatively stated, [...] "The group's sugar-coated sounds and watered-down lyrics lack the full-fledged punch needed to fully land on any level....And while the project has a few more glimpses of saccharine satisfaction (thanks in part to producer Ian Eskelin of All Star United fame), Eleventyseven still has plenty of room to develop before a Galactic Conquest is even remotely possible." ...|$|E

The paper describes some of the challenges that arise when analyzing machine code, and what can be done about them. It also provides a rationale for some of the design decisions made in the machine-code-analysis tools that we have built over the past few years...|$|E
40|$|Milk {{consumption}} {{is influenced by}} the quality and flavor of the milk a person drinks. Today the consumer evaluates milk solely on its taste and keeping quality. Since the flavor of milk cannot be improved after it leaves the dairy farm, it is of the utmost importance to produce milk with the best flavor quality possible. Milk is a highly perishable food and must be produced under conditions that will ensure keeping quality. Generally speaking, dairymen are <b>doing</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>job</b> <b>of</b> producing high quality milk but we need to be aware that problems may occur with feeding, cow health, cleaning, sanitizing and general handling of the milk. It is important to know what is good tasting milk and then use this standard to produce top quality milk free of off flavors. Following are brief discussions regarding some of the milk flavor problems that still exist today, with suggestions on how to reduce these problems...|$|E

40|$|One maxim {{that has}} been {{circulating}} among farmers is that most farmers sell in the lower third of the market. This maxim is soundly rejected using data from Oklahoma elevators. In fact, roughly half of producers sell in the upper third of the market. Thus, there {{does not seem to}} be a great need for producers to hire a market advisor to do their marketing for them. But, some farmers do store longer than is optimal and they could be encouraged to sell sooner after harvest. In the short run, farmers sold after price increases and held after price decreases. Price movements in the days after a large number of sales were no different than price movements after few sales. While farmers are noise traders in the short run, it does appear that they are responding to long-run market signals.

40|$|In {{addition}} to conserving energy {{and protecting the}} environment, the use of reclaimed asphalt pavement (RAP) can significantly reduce the increasing cost of asphalt mixes. However, {{one of the key}} problems with RAP mixes is its variability, which is the main reason why many states including Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) limit the use of RAP. In most circumstances, RAP variability is closely related to RAP stockpiles management and RAP processing. This report first documents the state of the practice of RAP stockpile management and RAP processing in Texas. In contrast to the RAP stockpiles owned by TxDOT, most contractors currently combine materials from different RAP sources and sometimes waste into a single pile and then process it into a usable material by crushing and/or fractionation.
