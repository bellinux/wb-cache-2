5|$|Because {{bulk cargo}} <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>difficult</b> to discharge, bulkers {{spend more time}} in port than other ships. A study of mini-bulkers found that it takes, on average, twice as much time to unload a ship as it does to load it. A mini-bulker spends 55hours at a time in port, {{compared}} to 35hours for a lumber carrier of similar size. This time in port increases to 74hours for Handymax and 120hours for Panamax vessels. Compared with the 12-hour turnarounds common for container ships, 15-hour turnarounds for car carriers, and 26-hour turnarounds for large tankers, bulker crews have more opportunities to spend time ashore.|$|E

After all, if theoretical or empirical work improves our understanding of some aspect of the world or our fellow people, or improves our ability to help people enhance their physical or emotional well being, what difference does it make whether this work is considered a part of psychology, of cognitive science, of behavioral neuroscience, of public health, or what have you? This raises the question of what definitions in general are good for.|$|E

25|$|Much {{less common}} than colorless zircon is colorless scheelite. Its {{dispersion}} (0.026) is also {{high enough to}} mimic diamond, but although it is highly lustrous its hardness is much too low (4.5–5.5) to maintain a good polish. It is also anisotropic and fairly dense (SG 5.9–6.1). Synthetic scheelite produced via the Czochralski process is available, but {{it has never been}} widely used as a diamond simulant. Due to the scarcity of natural gem-quality scheelite, synthetic scheelite is much more likely to simulate it than diamond. A similar case is the orthorhombic carbonate cerussite, which is so fragile (very brittle with four directions of good cleavage) and soft (hardness 3.5) that it is never seen set in jewelry, and only occasionally seen in gem collections because it <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>difficult</b> to cut. Cerussite gems have an adamantine luster, high RI (1.804–2.078), and high dispersion (0.051), making them attractive and valued collector's pieces. Aside from softness, they are easily distinguished by cerussite's high density (SG 6.51) and anisotropy with extreme birefringence (0.271).|$|E

Game Revolution explained that, while in previous Tomb Raider games [...] "instant death came {{about if you}} were trying to rush through an area and you did something stupid", every step in Tomb Raider III [...] "is a potential threat of instant death, no matter how careful you're trying to be." [...] The publication {{went so far as to}} call Tomb Raider III [...] "a marketing concept", stating that the game <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>difficult</b> that it is impossible to beat without buying a strategy guide. Similarly, Electronic Gaming Monthly criticised the game for being rushed and highly frustrating, noting that it has [...] "too many instances of cheap deaths." [...] The magazine also remarked that the stealth elements in the Nevada levels were ineffective, especially when compared to Konami's 1998 hit Metal Gear Solid.|$|E

500|$|The most {{meaningful}} {{outcome of the}} Franklin expedition was the mapping of several thousand miles of hitherto unsurveyed coastline by expeditions searching for Franklin's lost ships and crew. As Richard Cyriax noted, [...] "the loss of the expedition probably added much more [...] knowledge than its successful return would have done". At the same time, it largely quelled the Admiralty's appetite for Arctic exploration. There was a gap of many years before the Nares expedition and when Nares declared there was [...] "no thoroughfare" [...] to the North Pole, his words {{marked the end of}} the Royal Navy's historical involvement in Arctic exploration, {{the end of an era}} in which such exploits were widely seen by the British public as worthy expenditures of human effort and monetary resources. As a writer for The Athenaeum put it, [...] "We think that we can fairly make out the account between the cost and results of these Arctic Expeditions, and ask whether it is worth while to risk so much for that which <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>difficult</b> of attainment, and when attained, is so worthless." [...] The navigation of the Northwest Passage in 1903–05 by Roald Amundsen with the Gjøa expedition effectively ended the centuries-long quest for the Northwest Passage.|$|E
500|$|After the UK release, Dickon Stainer, head of Universal Classics and Jazz, {{spoke of}} plans to {{publicise}} Faryl in the US, saying [...] "America {{is going to}} be key. Because of her history on the talent show there's already a great deal of interest in her. The demand is intense." [...] In April 2009, Smith travelled to Los Angeles to begin her promotion of Faryl in the US. She appeared on The Ellen DeGeneres Show in early May as part of her promotional tour. Faryl was released in the US on 5 May. Smith said before the release that she did not expect it to sell as well {{as it did in the}} UK. She said that [...] "in the US it's a lot harder because I'm not as well-known. In the UK, a lot of people obviously watched 'Britain's Got Talent' and stuff, and that was like fresh in everyone's minds." [...] After the release, she was more optimistic, saying [...] "hen I performed in New York, it reminded me of the HMV signing in Kettering and there was quite a big queue so I think my album was well received." [...] Smith returned from the US in early May. Despite the contrary being said when she performed on the third series of Britain's Got Talent, Smith had no plans for a concert tour in 2009; she was quoted as saying that [...] "I'm too young and don't think I would be able to do a tour on my own". However, she did plan to return to the US during her summer holidays to again promote Faryl. She said that [...] "everyone in America was really nice and they do like classical music, but it <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>difficult</b> to make it over there ... They seem to like their own singers, but I will just keep trying my best". However, she instead took a short break from her music career in summer, before returning to the recording studio later in the year for Wonderland, her second album, which was released in November.|$|E

2500|$|In 1995 {{economist}} Robert Whaples {{stated that}} measuring {{the effect of}} the New Deal remains a thorny issue for economists because it <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>difficult</b> to measure the effects it had on the country. A survey of academic specialists by Whaples showed that 49% of those economists surveyed felt that the New Deal lengthened and deepened the depression, while 51% disagreed. The same survey also showed that only 5% of professional historians and 27% of professional economists felt the same way. However, economist Eric Rauchway of the University of California stated [...] "very few people disapprove of most of the New Deal reforms", which include Social Security, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., and Fannie Mae.

My learned friend has used the tactics of McCarthyism in an endeavour to smear him. I think, with respect, my learned friend is allowing himself to run away with facts that are not there. His complaint in count one is not that they found files with evidence. Oh not, he says that 'we found files with nothing in them', not in Kantor's office, but in the office of Wolpe. Then my learned friend [...] that the practice had been ruined and liquidated Kantor's practice. My lord, it is not Kantor. It is not Kantor!

2500|$|It {{could be}} that it is {{extremely}} difficult to start life. It might be that it <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>difficult</b> to start life that it has happened only once among all the planets... Let us consider, just as a conjecture, that the chance life starting when we have got suitable physical conditions is 10−100. I don't have any logical reason for proposing this figure, I just want you to consider it as a possibility. Under those conditions ... it is almost certain that life would not have started. And I feel that under those conditions {{it will be necessary to}} assume the existence of a god to start off life. I would like, therefore, to set up this connexion between the existence of a god and the physical laws: if physical laws are such that to start off life involves an excessively small chance, so that it will not be reasonable to suppose that life would have started just by blind chance, then there must be a god, and such a god would probably be showing his influence in the quantum jumps which are taking place later on. On the other hand, if life can start very easily and does not need any divine influence, then I will say that there is no god.|$|E
2500|$|German {{critics were}} positive. Julia Evers of Oberösterreichische Nachrichten called the film [...] "an oppressive and {{impressive}} moral painting, in which neither the audience nor {{the people in}} the village find an escape valve from the web of authority, hierarchy and violence. [...] Everything in The White Ribbon is true. And that is why it <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>difficult</b> to bear." [...] Markus Keuschnigg of Die Presse praised the [...] "sober cinematography" [...] along with the pacing of the narrative. Challenging accusations of Haneke's cinematic approach being cold and cynical, Keuschnigg instead hailed the director as uncompromising and sincerely humanistic. Die Welts Peter Zander compared the film to Haneke's previous works Benny's Video and Funny Games, concluding that while the violence in the previous films had seemed distant and constructed, The White Ribbon demonstrates how it is a part of human society. Zander also applauded the [...] "perfectly cast children", whom he held as [...] "the real stars of this film". In Der Spiegel, Christian Buß opined that the work is [...] "a horror drama, free from horror images", and praised its deviations from conventions of contemporary German cinema, writing that [...] "Haneke forces us to learn how to see again".|$|E
2500|$|Guerrilla {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics. Mojo called the album [...] "magical stuff" [...] and commended the band {{for their ability}} to mix musical styles, being particularly impressed with the juxtaposition of the esoteric [...] "Wherever I Lay My Phone (That's My Home)" [...] and the [...] "trad-sounding" [...] "Fire in My Heart". The magazine suggested that Guerrillas melodies were good enough to provide the band with number one singles and praised [...] "Northern Lites" [...] in particular, stating that it was [...] "one of the most frothily inventive pop confections" [...] since the band's own [...] "Ice Hockey Hair", released in 1998. Pitchfork were similarly impressed with the eclecticism of the album, stating that the group seemingly try every musical genre possible and succeed in their efforts. The website claimed that the album sees the band take their [...] "long-standing whimsicality to its logic-warping extreme". Cokemachineglow also commented on the band's musical versatility, stating that, although the record features a mix of styles, it is a cohesive whole; a [...] "perfectly flowing album", that showcases some of the Super Furry Animals' best songs. AllMusic agreed calling Guerrilla arguably the band's [...] "most cohesive" [...] album and a [...] "pleasingly and consistently unpredictable" [...] record. Yahoo! Music called Guerrilla a [...] "strange bag of mixed fruits" [...] and stated that, as the record <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>difficult</b> to pigeonhole, it [...] "takes some getting into". The website felt that this was a good thing however, and again praised the album for its shifting musical styles.
