40|$|Multiple {{sclerosis}} (MS) is a disabling chronic {{neurological disease}} {{with a significant}} impact on patients lives. There is no cure for MS, but recombinant interferon beta (IFN-beta) is currently the most established disease modifying therapy. One of the major clinical problems of IFN-beta is the development of neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) that interfere with the clinical efficacy of the drug. Still, in the medical community, there is some skepticism regarding the clinical use of NAb testing and its interpretation at the individual level. The overall aim of this thesis was to provide evidence-based knowledge which will be useful in clinical management. To some extent, such information could help in understanding similar scenarios for the many <b>emerging</b> <b>biopharmaceuticals</b> that are potentially immunogenic and might induce antibodies which could interfere with clinical efficacy. Biological study materials were blood samples from IFN-beta treated MS patients that were referred from neurology units in Sweden, Norway and Finland to the specialized NAb laboratory in the Neurology Division at the Karolinska University Hospital in Huddinge. NAbs were measured using the MxA induction assay and in vivo IFN-beta bioactivity was measured by the in vivo MxA mRNA assay. We observed an overall 32 % of NAb positivity in MS patients who were tested for NAbs from 2003 to 2006. Weekly low-protein-dose intramuscular IFN-beta was found to be the least seroprevalent and immunogenic product compared to the weekly-high-protein-dose subcutaneous IFN-beta preparations. A titer around 150 TRU/ml marked an important IFN-beta bioactivity level for the NAb titers as a significant in vivo drug response was retained up to this level. Titers above 600 TRU/ml were associated with complete loss of IFN-beta bioactivity. Fluctuation of NAb titers was assessed across the functionally critical titer of 150 TRU/ml and showed that the majority (72 %) of patients were stable, especially the two extreme ends of the titer spectrum i. e. negative (less than 10 TRU/ml) and very high titers (> 600 TRU/ml). As expected, titers close to 150 TRU/ml appeared more prone to fluctuation across this level, i. e. offering a greater chance ofregaining good IFN-beta bioactivity, or, reversely, a greater risk of losing bioactivity. These observations were not influenced by treatment duration or sampling interval between consecutive NAb tests. We failed to observe an increased NAb positivity when referrals indicated an impression of disease worsening. Conclusion: Here, we studied several clinically relevant aspects of IFN-beta NAbs. We identified differences between the IFN-beta preparations regarding the frequency of NAb induction, which we refer to as seroprevalence, but also regarding titer levels of induced NAbs, which we refer to as immunogenicity. In a population-based sample of MS patients we demonstrated that these parameters vary between IFN-beta preparations. Further, we identified titer levels that are critical for retaining the in vivo bioactivity of IFN-beta, vital for the interpretation of individual NAb tests. We showed that NAb titers are commonly stable with a greater tendency of fluctuation of mid-range titers. Finally, we showed that a clinical impression of worsening is poorly predictive of NAb status, implicating the necessity of regular NAb testing. Although NAb testing and its interpretation remains a complex area, our results have provided clinically useful knowledge of relevance in the management of MS patients treated with IFN-beta...|$|R

Scientific {{output of}} the <b>emerging</b> Cuban <b>biopharmaceutical</b> industry: a scientometric approach. Scientometrics, 108 (3), 1621 - 1636. DOI: 10. 1007 /s 11192 - 016 - 2023 - 1. Cuba has {{developed}} a biopharmaceutical sector that involves some of the country’s most relevant scientific institutions. Despite the severe constraints on resources resulting from the U. S. embargo, the results achieved by this sector have contributed to put the country’s health indicators {{at the same level}} of high-income nations. Recently, the creation of BioCubaFarma as a cluster of high-technology enterprises organized around a closed cycle model becomes one of the most relevant efforts of the Island in order to make biopharmaceuticals one of the country’s leading export earners. The main aim of the current paper was to characterize BioCubaFarma through a battery of Scopus-based bibliometric indicators. A comparison with the most productive multinational pharmaceutical companies was made. Regression analysis of annual productivity, number of citations, scientific talent pool, innovative knowledge and other citation-based indicators was performed. Differences and similarities between BioCubaFarma and multinational companies in four Scopus subject categories related to this sector were identified. The most productive and visible institutions from BioCubaFarma were also characterized. Qualified human resources, innovative knowledge, leadership, high specialization in the field of vaccines development and non-dependence of international collaboration are strengths of the organization. However, it is still necessary {{to increase the number of}} articles published in highly visible journals with the aim to achieve a better citation-based performance. Moreover, to increase the contributions from less-productive institutions, more clinical research published in medical journals and more collaboration with universities and health institutions could also have positive benefits for BioCubaFarma’s pipelines and portfolios.

40|$|Antibody {{fragments}} are <b>emerging</b> as promising <b>biopharmaceuticals</b> {{because of}} their relatively small size and other unique properties. However, when compared to full-size antibodies, most of the current antibody fragments of VH or VL display greatly reduced half-lives. A promising approach to overcome this problem is {{through the development of}} novel antibody fragments based on IgG Fc region, which contributes to the long half-life of IgG through its unique pH-dependent association with the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn). The IgG Fc region comprises two CH 2 and two CH 3 domains. In this report, we present a comparative study of the FcRn binding capability of the CH 2 and CH 3 domains. The stability and aggregation resistance of these domains were also investigated and compared. We found that monomeric CH 2 and CH 3 domains exhibited the pH-dependent FcRn binding while the dimeric forms of CH 2 and CH 3 domains did not. Although all of these domains had high serum stability, they had aggregation tendencies as measured by dynamic light scattering. By providing {{a better understanding of the}} structure-activity relationship of the Fc fragment, these results guide further approaches to generate novel Fc-based small-size antibody fragments that possess pH-dependent FcRn binding capability, desired in vivo half-lives and other favorable biophysical properties for their drugability...|$|R
40|$|The Ph. D. project {{assesses the}} role of {{intellectual}} property (IP) in (precompetitive) Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) in the biomedical sector. <b>Biopharmaceutical</b> <b>enterprises</b> face major challenges, such as increased competition, falling research and development (R&D) budgets, increasing regulatory hurdles, accelerating technological complexity, future patent cliffs, and declining number of promising projects in their drug pipelines. Interdisciplinary, translational research for drug development requires collaboration between stakeholders from industry and academia. A shared objective is to translate basic biological research into therapies serving patients. Industry realizes the potential of combining different ideas, skills, and expertise in technologically demanding areas and is increasingly tapping into early-phase research conducted at universities and {{small- and medium-sized enterprises}} specializing in biotechnology (biotech SMEs). In addition, sharing knowledge with competitors at the precompetitive—and even at a competitive—stage is increasingly considered to be both relevant and viable. Taking into account the multifaceted partnering model of (precompetitive) PPPs and the heterogeneity of partners—including their often conflicting missions, objectives, and cultures—it is not surprising that IP plays a pivotal role and that IP and trust issues are part of the negotiation process. The general introduction of the Ph. D. project provides an overview of the pharmaceutical market and the strategic redirection of pharmaceutical firms towards collaboration. The general introduction further provides a background on the wider legal framework wherein PPPs operate (e. g. competition law), particularly the various IPRS that come into play when discussing precompetitive PPPs. An overview of what IPRS are is given: the concept of IP, the different forms of IP protection, as well as the rights attached to the IP. In biomedical projects, different types of IP protection can be sought, depending on the intellectual creation. The most common type of IPRs protection for inventions is patents, but also other forms of IP protection are used, such as copyright, sui generis database rights or protection of trade secrets. Part 2 explains the concept of life science R&D precompetitive PPPs. Precompetitive PPPs can help speed up the drug-development process by stimulating competitors to collaborate in the pre-discovery phase. The precompetitive PPP model is situated in the upstream research phase of the drug development cycle, and the characteristics of such model differ from the PPPs situated further in the downstream development process, such as Product Development PPPs and Product Access PPPs. Precompetitive PPPs aim to solve basic research questions and to generate technology platforms, research tools, and predictive models to advance knowledge about disease pathways. Such activities precede the market exploitation phase and offer opportunities to reduce throughput time and risks associated with such predevelopment phases. Part 3 investigates the difference in stakeholders’ motives for participation, their expectations and objectives. It is important to emphasize that the motives for participation and the expectations of different stakeholder groups differ. It was shown that various stakeholders, such as academia and SMEs, are reluctant regarding Intellectual Property Rights (IPRs) in PPPs and that IPRS management could pose a hurdle for participation. The question of IP will likely remain a matter of debate, and the success of PPPs depends on the attitude and expertise of the participants. Instead of considering precompetitive PPPs as collaborative models, wherein exclusive rights are offered at bargain prices, stakeholders need to become aware that the value of precompetitive PPPs lies in the opportunity to scout for and network with the best scientists. Collaboration will {{be the only way to}} generate valuable knowledge. In Part 4, an analysis of Intellectual Property (IP) policies deployed within precompetitive biomedical PPPs revealed a variety of practices. IP frameworks differ in terms of openness (access/use) as well as explicitness. Depending on the nature of the research and the feasibility of an appropriation oriented (business) strategy, the type of IP framework or ‘knowledge sharing strategy’ differs. PPPs wherein downstream research results (drugs and diagnostic tests) are the primary focus opt for an IP sharing strategy wherein access to foreground IPRS and freedom-to-operate are permission constrained and preferably negotiated with the consortium partners only (Partnership-focused strategy). PPPs wherein upstream research results (research tools and platform technologies) or poverty-related and neglected diseases (PRNDs) specific downstream products are focused are more likely to adopt an IP framework that allows sharing IPRS with a broad research community (Open Collaboration strategy). Hybrid strategies, with preferred public release of research results unless patenting is necessary to secure market access or to engage the commercial partner towards further investments, become deployed when either model is sufficient to proceed the project. As both models imply benefits and drawbacks, we argue for a contingency perspective rather than a ‘one best way’ of organizing IP within PPPs. A second level of variation pertains to the explicitness or clarity of the IP policies. The majority of the IP policies lacks basic information on IP concepts such as definitions of background IP and foreground IP, and rules on ownership thereof, access thereto and use thereof. Even when knowledge is shared in the broadest possible way, IP, access and user rights need to be addressed explicitly in order to proceed effectively. Transparency and clear guidelines for IP management are crucial for trust creation amongst the partners in the consortium. Part 5 provides an overview of the practice of IP management in precompetitive PPP projects. Six Case Studies were performed at the Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI), world’s largest biomedical PPP: project outputs and outcomes, with a focus on IP and business opportunities of six consortia were analyzed. It was demonstrated that in early-phase research, patent applications are not the main source of IPRS outcomes. The six Case Studies have revealed that besides foreground IP and business opportunities, many other extremely valuable assets were developed. The consortium partners developed unique scientific and managerial insights. For the pharmaceutical companies to share non-confidential, and more importantly, and new to the sector, confidential data with consortium partners, which are considered future competitors, valuable tools were developed to guarantee interoperability between partners. They established experiences in knowledge transfer, construed databases, adopted diverse templates, knowledge sharing mechanisms, trust-based agreements and models, applicable bilaterally, within and between consortia as a whole. Such assets offer an enormous potential for new consortia, for the IMI itself, as well as for regulatory, clinical and healthcare practices in general aimed at accelerating the delivery of improved therapy to society. The mindset within the consortia reflects an open attitude towards sharing between profit and non-profit institutes to speed up innovation and eventually market access. Inter-IMI project collaborations having certain degrees of synergy create opportunities for future value creation and have the potential to extend IMI’s projects deliverables. To maximize IMI’s long term impact and treasure those valuable results, time has come to design means for optimal exploitation of the different types of assets, and to guarantee the sustainability of research tools and databases generated. To conclude, a general discussion and recommendations for sustainable precompetitive PPPs are provided in Part 6 of the Ph. D. project. It is recommended for biomedical (precompetitive) PPPs to optimize their functioning to 1) foster IP as a tool for collaboration in PPPs, not as the centerpiece of the partnership, 2) consider precompetitive PPPs as a scouting platform for future collaborations, 3) provide clear and transparent guidelines for managing IP, 4) assure (wide dissemination of) best practices, 5) conduct more research in PPP performance evaluation, 6) consider a stage-gate process, 7) implement the honest broker model, 8) anticipate a sustainability plan, 9) provide an overview of the PPP landscape, 10) set up PPPs for unmet medical needs, and 11) exchange information on the legal framework to ease global research demand. status: publishe...|$|R
