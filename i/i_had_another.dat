2500|$|At the 2005 Parliamentary Press Gallery Dinner (typically a satirical event), Layton sent up {{himself and}} his party, playing guitar and singing three songs: [...] "Party for Sale or Rent" [...] (to the tune of [...] "King of the Road"), a re-worked version of [...] "Nobody Knows You When You're Down and Out" [...] with {{different}} humorous lyrics, and [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>Had</b> <b>Another</b> $4.6 Billion".|$|E
2500|$|In the Tour de France, I took steroids. That {{is not a}} stimulant, just a strengthener. If I hadn't, I {{would have}} had to give up. [...] On the first rest day, before we went into the Pyrenees, I had a first hormone injection. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>another</b> one on the second day, {{at the start of the}} last week. You can't call that {{medically}} harmful, not if it's done under a doctor's control and within reason.|$|E
2500|$|Norwood {{eventually}} {{decided to}} scrap {{most of the}} project, and instead enlisted Timbaland, with whom the couple had previously worked on Kiley Dean's unreleased Simple Girl album, as the album's main contributor. Impressed by Timaland's input, Norwood rediscovered the musical affection, she had missed on Full Moon and its technical priority. [...] "I made the change because I needed to evolve. I needed to explore my talent and versatility and see if <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>another</b> side to me, another sound," [...] she said about collaborating. [...] "I wanted to do my own thing, and I've always {{wanted to work with}} Timbaland [...] and see how my voice would sound over his tracks. It was an edgier Brandy, a sassier sound, but still with a lot of heart and a lot of passion." [...] With the help of Timbaland protégés such as Candice Nelson, Steve [...] "Static" [...] Garrett, and co-producer Walter Millsap III the pair worked on what was tentatively titled B-Rocka — a nickname actually given to her by Jerkins — and originally planned for a Christmas 2003 release. Their first collaboration, 1990s tribute [...] "Turn It Up", was leaked onto the internet in autumn 2003, and soon released as a promotional buzz track.|$|E

60|$|Beat. Make haste, then; for <b>I</b> <b>have</b> more irons in the fire: When <b>I</b> <b>have</b> {{done with}} you, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>another</b> {{assignation}} of my Lady Theodosia's to Don Melchor.|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>another</b> humiliating {{confession}} to make--I {{tried to get}} off going to Browndown. (So like those unfeeling French people, isn't it?) ...|$|R
60|$|Non. Would <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>another</b> {{child for}} your sake! you should ne'er see a penny of my money.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>another</b> calf killed; {{this one}} was led away. The next day the steward asked {{to speak to me}} in private.|$|E
60|$|From October 1772 to October 1773. Baptized Samuel Taylor, my Godfather's name being Samuel Taylor, Esquire. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>another</b> called Evans, and two Godmothers, both named Munday.|$|E
5000|$|Based in Basildon, Essex, Kunt and the Gang {{began his}} career in 2003, {{performing}} {{at a number of}} pubs and gaining the attention of various national magazines. His first three albums, <b>I</b> <b>Have</b> A Little Wank And <b>I</b> <b>Have</b> A Little Cry (2005), <b>I</b> <b>Have</b> <b>Another</b> Wank And <b>I</b> <b>Have</b> <b>Another</b> Cry (2007) and One Last Wank And One Last Cry (2008) constituted a [...] "Wanking and Crying Trilogy", each being released on Disco Minge Records. This was followed by a fourth studio album, the topical Shannon Matthews: The Musical (2010).|$|R
6000|$|Lee, {{burning with}} mingled flames of resentment and humor, replied: [...] "Thank you, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>another</b> call to make--Thursday, then, at seven o'clock." ...|$|R
60|$|Mor. Well, if {{it must be}} so, agreed; for <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>another</b> {{trick to}} play you, and thank {{yourself}} for what shall follow.|$|R
60|$|In {{due course}} of time <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>another</b> {{manuscript}} finished, and I sent it to my favorite periodical. It was retained some weeks, and then came back to me.|$|E
6000|$|... "I must {{go over to}} Fink's," [...] {{said the}} Kid, rising, [...] "for some tobacco. I thought <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>another</b> sack in my coat. I'll {{be back in a}} quarter of an hour." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have brought}} {{a hundred and fifty}} with me, Sandy, so we have as many as we can use on the walls, though I could wish <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>another</b> hundred or two for sorties." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If ever <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>another</b> woman aboard my ship, George," [...] {{said the}} skipper, [...] "I’ll run into something. Who’s the old gentleman?" ...|$|R
6000|$|A wild idea seized Randolph. [...] "But <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>another</b> secret--you <b>have</b> not guessed--and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> not {{dared to}} tell you. Do you wish {{me to be}} frank now?" ...|$|R
5000|$|However, in a {{place of}} {{business}} an apologetic or over-polite request made of a person who is paid to provide the service you may want, is usually seen as unnecessary - and may backfire. For example: [...] "I'm terribly sorry to bother you -- but may <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>another</b> napkin?" [...] might elicit an eyeroll. Simply say: [...] "may <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>another</b> napkin, please?" [...] This may hold true even, perhaps counter-intuitively, if the latter is delivered somewhat more curtly or coolly.|$|R
6000|$|... "You shall hear directly," [...] replied Magdalen. [...] "I have {{something}} to say first. I told you, last night, that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>another</b> object in view besides the object of earning my living on the stage--" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>another</b> {{letter from}} Mrs. Fenton, who says {{you were with}} her; I hope you did not go on purpose. I will answer her letter soon; it is about some money in Lady Giffard's hands.|$|E
6000|$|... "Khatim {{came to me}} afterwards, {{and advised}} me to stay, but I said {{that it might be}} years before <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>another</b> chance to escape; and that, {{whatever}} risk there was, I would prefer running it.|$|E
6000|$|... "No; <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>another</b> {{thought in}} my stomach. The Man-Pack shall {{not know what}} share <b>I</b> <b>have</b> in the sport. Make thine own hunt. I {{do not wish to}} see them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "For the moment," [...] he said, [...] "we will {{quit the}} subject. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>another</b> matter, equally delicate, which I {{should like to}} discuss with you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, you're to keep them, of course. That is what I {{meant when}} I gave them. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>another</b> {{pair of shoes}} and plenty of stockings." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Here is Eustace," [...] he said, [...] "and little Dora," [...] {{putting the}} child forward as she backed against him, most unwilling {{to let me}} kiss her. [...] "And, I did not know <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>another</b> aunt." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "When I was under, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>another</b> above me; and now, as I'm upper, why there's others under me." [...] So she {{explained}} her {{position at the}} hotel, but she never took {{her eyes from the}} canopy.|$|E
60|$|I {{remember}} a dinner I {{had long ago}} with Whitelaw Reid and John Hay at Reid's expense. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>another</b> last summer when I was in London at the embassy that Choate blackguards so. I'd like to live there.|$|E
6000|$|... "Dreadfully; oh, quite terribly. You {{ought to}} have a rug, you really ought. Won't you let me lend you one? <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>another</b> under the seat here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'It sounds obvious, but {{the very}} {{intensity}} of love makes love soft and blind. Now <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>another,</b> which <b>I</b> am convinced {{that you will not}} agree with.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Another word, and I'll arrest you, Mr. Clavering," [...] he said. [...] "Sling those rifles, all of you! <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>another</b> troop {{with horses}} picketed behind the bluff." ...|$|R
6000|$|MY DEAR MISS FERRIER,--They say Walter is gone. You, {{who know}} how I have {{neglected}} him, will conceive my remorse. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>another</b> letter written; when I heard he was worse, I promised myself to wake up for the last time. Alas, too late! ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>another</b> {{letter from}} America {{a few days}} since, from an American poet of Boston who is {{establishing}} a magazine, and asked for contributions from my pen. The Americans are as good-natured {{to me as if}} they took me for the high Radical I am, you know.|$|E
6000|$|... "Your {{story is}} plausible," [...] she said coldly. [...] "It {{may even be}} true. But, apart from that, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>another</b> and a greater reason for coming to England, for coming to Braster. I came to seek my husband--the father of this boy. I am even now in search of him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Poor girl!--poor girl!" [...] said Peter, {{patting her}} hand kindly with his thin fingers. [...] "Henceforth <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>another</b> score against Morella, and I will pay it too." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Dorian. [...] "And I am afraid, Francis, that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>another</b> errand for you. What is {{the name}} of the man at Richmond who {{supplies}} Selby with orchids?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am going}} {{away for a}} few days. I am going away," [...] he added, {{dropping}} his voice, [...] "ostensibly {{for a change of}} air. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>another</b> reason for going." ...|$|R
