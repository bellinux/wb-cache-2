These sod houses varied in size and structure and were built out of necessity when snow was not abundant. This may have been due to warmer climate conditions. However, none have been found in the Nunavik area of Hudson Bay, and semi-subterranean homes were used until the 19th Century.|$|R

The Winter 2016 Economic Update also discusses the increasing growth of part-time employment, as opposed to full-time work. While a shift to part-time work is not necessarily a bad thing, some commentators and studies have warned that increasing levels of part-time work may risk exacerbating issues of underemployment, income inequality and job insecurity. While NSW appears to have been less affected than other States by the proportionate decline in full-time employment, issues relating to part-time work are still evident in the State and may be of interest to policymakers...|$|R

50|$|The area is low-lying, built {{along the}} relict of the forked river/stream the Tyburn. This made the area prone to waterlogging, and <b>dwellings</b> <b>started</b> to subside.

In 1850 Charles Dickens called the area The Devil's Acre in Household Words. In the same year Cardinal Wiseman described the area as follows:Close under the Abbey of Westminster there lie concealed labyrinths of lanes and courts, and alleys and slums, nests of ignorance, vice, depravity, and crime, as well as of squalor, wretchedness, and disease; whose atmosphere is typhus, whose ventilation is cholera; in which swarms of huge and almost countless population, nominally at least, Catholic; haunts of filth, which no sewage committee can reach - dark corners, which no lighting board can brighten.This passage, first published by Wiseman in An Appeal to the Reason and Good Feeling of the English People on the Subject of the Catholic Hierarchy, was widely quoted in the national press, which led to the popularisation of the word slum to describe bad housing.|$|R

40|$|The New South Wales {{economy has}} {{overtaken}} Western Australia where the fading mining boom {{has seen it}} lose ground in terms of population growth, retail trade and investment. Summary The New South Wales economy {{has been in the}} headlines this quarter following the release of the October CommSec ‘State of the States’ report. New South Wales was ranked the best-performing State economy, with CommSec citing population growth and <b>dwelling</b> <b>starts</b> as key drivers of economic growth in the State. It has overtaken Western Australia where the fading mining boom has seen it lose ground in terms of population growth, retail trade and investment. The relatively strong position of New South Wales was welcomed by Premier Mike Baird who described the housing sector as the the ‘cornerstone’ of the State’s growth. While the CommSec report paints a positive picture for New South Wales, growth has not been consistent, nor sustained across all segments of the State economy. Among other areas of weakness, labour market indicators have softened. Unemployment is up 0. 6 per cent since March, job vacancies have declined and employment growth has been stagnant for the past six months. Additionally, New South Wales continues to have the highest trade deficit of all the States; and despite improving for the quarter, has been deteriorating for the last decade or so. The bigger picture therefore suggests that while the NSW economy remains in a relatively strong headline position, other areas of the State economy need to be stimulated if growth is to be realised more broadly and sustained once the housing sector slows...|$|R

40|$|The {{topic of}} this {{bachelor}} thesis is the residential market of the Czech Republic and changes of housing construction {{at a time}} of financial crisis. Residential market can be affected not only by financial crisis, but also by other factors that are not influenced by economic recession.

Supply and demand could be influenced not only by these changes but by uncertainty about future form of these changes, too. The second part of this work is aimed at possible impact of demographic structure on started housing construction. There are two time series that are correlated [...] the number of inhabitants of the Czech Republic between the ages of 25 to 39 and the number of <b>started</b> <b>dwellings.</b> The results show that newly started housing construction is not depended on the number of inhabitants at determined age group in conditions of the Czech Republic.

40|$|Summary According to the Commonwealth Bank, {{since the}} {{beginning}} of 2016 NSW has been Australia’s top performing economy, slightly ahead of Victoria and maintaining a healthy lead over other States and Territories. The April 2016 State of the States report found that NSW holds top ranking on five indicators: population growth, retail trade, <b>dwelling</b> <b>starts,</b> and unemployment. NSW does not hold top position on all economic indicators: it remains fourth ranked on construction work done and second ranked on economic growth, both led by the Northern Territory. Nevertheless, the State of the States report concluded that NSW retains a solid grip on the top ranking of economic performance. One reason for this ongoing economic strength, as noted by St George Bank last year, is the Australian economy’s ongoing transition away from mining to the non-resources sectors: While NSW may have felt like it was standing on the sidelines in the mining investment boom, the ongoing transition in Australian economic growth to other sectors is a boon for NSW. We expect solid economic growth in coming years. As discussed in past Economic Updates, the housing market continues to play a pivotal role in the NSW economy’s recent resurgence, driving dwelling investment, generating wealth and catalysing household consumption growth. However, as reported by the Australian Financial Review, house price growth is now at its slowest pace in 31 months, with no capital city recording an annual growth rate at 10 % or more over the past year. RBA Governor Glenn Stevens has argued that the slowdown indicates that the mid- 2015 strengthening of bank lending standards for housing has worked {{to reduce the risk of}} a major housing market downturn. Nevertheless, as noted by Merrill Lynch, the slowdown may result in “a period of weaker price growth or outright modest declines [that] is likely to become entrenched over coming years”. Whether this slowdown risks instigating a household debt crisis in the long term remains the topic of debate by many observers. Based on the latest quarterly movements, the strengthened and weakened areas of the NSW economy are summarised in the table on the following page. It is clear that NSW is performing relatively well in key areas, although business investment remains weak...|$|R

40|$|The National Survey on Radon Indoors was {{designed}} to estimate the distribution of annual radon concentration in Italian dwellings, {{on the basis of}} a representative sample of about 5000 <b>dwellings.</b> It <b>started</b> in 1989 and ended in 1994, involving all Italian Regions except Sicilia and Calabria, due to organizational problems in these two regions of Southern Italy. After the official conclusion, two regional surveys were also carried out in Sicilia and Calabria, using the same experimental apparatus and protocols as in the other Regions. The final sample size was of 5631 dwellings distributed in 232 towns, i. e. all the 50 large towns (with more than 100, 000 inhabitants) and a random sample of the smaller towns. The results in Sicilia and Calabria were characterized by quite low radon concentrations, thus moving the national radon distribution towards somewhat lower values. The updated national average, weighted by the population of each Region, of the annual radon concentration decreases from 75 Bq/m 3 to 70 Bq/m 3, the geometric mean decreases from 57 Bq/m 3 to 52 Bq/m 3, while the geometric standard deviation slightly increases from 2. 0 to 2. 1.

40|$|This study {{undertakes}} an analytical, historical {{reconstruction of}} the rural, social and political space of Baronia di Monreale, currently part of the Medio Campidano province of Sardinia, Italy. The expression “{{reconstruction of the}} rural, social and political space” entails {{an investigation into the}} various means by which the territory is exploited, the formation and development of economic and political élites in the villages, the various forms of property ownership (conveyancing of land and property), the urban demographic patterns of villages as well as the various typologies of <b>dwellings.</b> The investigation <b>starts</b> off with a historical exploration of the main events in Sardinia in modern times, focusing on those concerning the Monreale area. The central part of the present study is devoted to an in-­‐‑depth analysis of practices of the use of rural, agricultural space from the late Medieval period up to early contemporary times. The research has focused in particular on the creation and development of the estates of large landowners: records and maps in the Land Registry Office have been essential and fundamental research tools, thanks to which a graphic representation of the larger estates was made possible. The following section focuses on the social and political relations within and among the several communities. It was possible to reconstruct the dense network of family relations which linked the Monreale élite to people in the cities and {{in the rest of the}} region. In order to do this, both genealogical and the micro-­‐‑historical approaches have been employed, with the purpose of retracing the trajectories and the interconnections which enabled some of the representatives of Monreale families to occupy significant political and military roles in the national arena. The last part of the research has been devoted to the impacts and effects that human intervention had on the rural landscape. Land use, the testamentary dispositions, the conflicts between barons and communities have produced far-­‐‑reaching effects overtime, which have profoundly transformed the modern and contemporary landscape. The main objective of the study is to provide an overview of the several aspects that have contributed to shaping the places which are the subject of this research. The outcomes will have some practical applications in such areas as integrated planning, landscape conservation and development as well as in structured planning in sectors such as agriculture and handicrafts. Archive research was undertaken at Cagliari State Archives, Turin State Archives, Historical Diocesan Archives in Ales and the historical archives in Guspini, San Gavino and Sardara municipalities.

40|$|Similarly to {{the greater}} part of the Tyrrhenian area, the process of neolithization in Sardinia {{presents}} a rupture compared to the scarce and uncertain evidence available to date for the Mesolithic period. In addition, a clear gap in the absolute chronology of the two periods indicates discontinuity between Mesolithic and Early Neolithic (EN) groups with regard to the different stages of territorialization of the island, to the settlement strategies, to the knowledge and exploitation of raw materials, and to the entire typological and technological organization of the lithic production. Thus, according to current research, the Early Neolithic in Sardinia is clearly the result of a rapid colonization process of unsettled territories, carried out by seafaring human groups. The gradient suggested by the radiocarbon dates for the spread of the Impressed Ware across the Central-northern Tyrrhenian Sea, coupled with the typo-technological analysis of the pottery, allows to outline a north-south oriented main route of the demic flow that generated the first permanent settlement on the island. The temporal progression of the establishment of the new economic system based on food production, and the absolute chronology of the Early Neolithic cultural sequence as well, were little defined and based on {{a very small number of}} sites. Furthermore, these contexts have been excavated at different times and consequently lack homogeneity with regard to the methods of analysis. In the last decade the re-examination of the main issues on the Early and Middle Neolithic, carried out within several research projects focusing on newly discovered sites and according to the systematic assessment of ancient assemblages, led us to propose a critical revision of the traditional picture and to realign the local cultural evolution with the one in the adjacent mainland regions. According to this new point of view, it is possible to understand many of the innovative features by correlating them with increasing interactions across the Mediterranean Sea. These have been generated by pulling factors that in time appear to be less and less related neither to affinity nor to common cultural traditions; on the contrary they clearly depend more and more on the establishment and the reinforcing of complex exchange networks, which are displayed by the important circulation of specific raw materials. The Su Carroppu rock shelter is located in the Palaeozoic massif of the Sulcis region, less than 13 km as the crow flies from the south-western coast of the island. It may be considered as paradigmatic of the abovementioned revision process of neolithisation in Sardinia. Being the first Early Neolithic site to be unequivocally recognized already at the end of the 1960 s, Su Carroppu has been considered for a long time as representative of the early stages of the Impressed Ware spreading into the Tyrrhenian basin, to the extent that it became eponymous of the corresponding facies. Based on the first interpretation of the assemblages coming from this site and, later on those from the excavations at Filiestru Cave at the end of the 1970 s, pioneer studies on Sardinian late prehistory brought forward a schematic sequence of the EN which was effective until now. This paper presents a full re-examination of the Su Carroppu assemblage, mainly focusing on the preliminary results from the new excavations in progress since 2009. They provide new data for the debate on the nature of the rock shelter, which hosted a long term <b>dwelling</b> site that <b>started</b> already in the Mesolithic, since it yielded the oldest direct evidence of Holocene human presence in Sardinia. A new set of radiocarbon dates concurs to replace in its correct chronological position the only unaltered stratigraphic layer excavated so far, which has to be referred to the full development of the EN Cardial phase. Furthermore, new data allow us to put forward a more reliable reading of the already published assemblage, by both suggesting a whole redefinition of its technological and typological characteristics, and discussing on some artefacts like geometrics, usually considered to be the most diagnostic type of this phase. Provenance studies applied to some preferred markers of interaction and exchange, like the well documented obsidian and jasper, help us to outline some of the socioeconomic features of the first EN settlement at Su Carroppu, compared to the wider regional and interregional background. These remarks are finally discussed in the light of the results of both the functional studies of the artefacts and the characterization of the faunal remains...|$|R
