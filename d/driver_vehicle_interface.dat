40|$|This {{report was}} {{prepared}} by Battelle, Center for Human Performance and Safety, for UMTRI {{under contract to}} the U. S. DOT. The Integrated Vehicle-Based Safety Systems (IVBSS) program is a four-year, two phase cooperative research program conducted by an industry team led by the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute (UMTRI). The program goal is to integrate several collision warning systems into one vehicle {{in a way that}} alerts drivers to potential collision threats with an effective <b>driver</b> <b>vehicle</b> <b>interface</b> (DVI), while minimizing the number of excessive warnings presented to the driver. Basic program strategies for meeting this objective include systematically managing and prioritizing all information presented to the driver, minimizing the number of system false alarms, and restricting auditory alarms to higher urgency collision conditions. During the development of the DVI specification document, the heavy-truck DVI team addressed a number of issues by conducting short reviews or analyses on specific design topics. This report collates these “design notes” into a single report for easy reference...|$|E
40|$|As roads become busier and {{automotive}} technology improves, {{there is}} considerable potential for driver assistance systems to improve the safety of road users. Longitudinal collision warning and collision avoidance systems are starting to appear on production cars to assist drivers when required to stop in an emergency. Many luxury cars are also equipped with stability augmentation systems that prevent the car from {{spinning out of control}} during aggressive lateral manoeuvres. Combining these concepts, there is a natural progression to systems that could assist in aiding or performing lateral collision avoidance manoeuvres. A successful automatic lateral collision avoidance system would require convergent development of many fields of technology, from sensors and instrumentation to aid environmental awareness through to improvements in <b>driver</b> <b>vehicle</b> <b>interfaces</b> so that a degree of control can be smoothly and safely transferred between the <b>driver</b> and <b>vehicle</b> computer.

40|$|The paper {{focuses on}} the {{emotional}} aspect of the driving experience. An experiment studying emotions during interaction between <b>driver</b> and <b>vehicle</b> <b>interface</b> in a natural driving situation was conducted. The aim was to identify aspects that affected the driving experience in a positive or negative manner. A triangulation method comprising interviews, observations and think-aloud protocols were used. Participants were required to drive around a specified route while interacting with the <b>vehicle</b> <b>interface.</b> They were interviewed before and after driving to identify their emotional state. During the drive {{they were asked to}} perform particular tasks with the interface as well as conduct a think-aloud protocol about their emotions while performing the tasks. Findings showed that emotions during interaction in low-traffic contexts did not impact the overall experience, while emotions elicited in high-traffic context influenced the overall emotional experience perceived. In addition, drivers in a positive emotional state before driving that experienced challenging interactions in high-traffic context perceived the overall experience as negative. Surprisingly, drivers in a negative emotional state prior to driving that experienced and overcame challenging interactions in high-traffic contexts perceived the overall experience a...|$|R

A fundamental requirement of any collision avoidance system is determination of a feasible path that avoids obstacles and a means of causing the vehicle to follow that trajectory. This research focuses on feasible trajectory generation and development of an automatic obstacle avoidance controller that integrates steering and braking action. A controller is developed to cause a specially modified car (a Mercedes `S' class with steer-by-wire and brake-by-wire capability) to perform an ISO 3888 - 2 emergency obstacle avoidance manoeuvre. A nonlinear two-track vehicle model is developed and used to derive optimal controller parameters using a series of simulations. Feedforward and feedback control is used to track a feasible reference trajectory. The feedforward control loops use inverse models of the vehicle dynamics. The feedback control loops are implemented as linear proportional controllers with a force allocation matrix used to apportion braking effort between redundant actuators. Two trajectory generation routines are developed: a geometric method, for steering a vehicle at its physical limits; and an optimal method, which integrates steering and braking action to make full use of available traction. The optimal trajectory is obtained using a multi-stage convex optimisation procedure. The overall controller performance is validated by simulation using a complex proprietary model of the vehicle that is reported to have been validated and calibrated against experimental data over several years of use in an industrial environment...|$|R
40|$|Side Collision Avoidance Systems (SCAS) are {{designed}} to warn of impending collisions and can detect not only adjacent vehicles but vehicles approaching at such a speed that a collision would occur if a lane change were made. Side object detection systems (SODS) represent a subset of SCAS; they warn {{of the presence of}} adjacent vehicles only, {{whether or not there is}} a lane change. Despite a measure of success in producing first-generation SODS devices, relatively little is known about <b>Driver</b> <b>Vehicle</b> <b>Interface</b> (DVI) requirements for these complex human-machine systems. The DVI is important because it affects the ability of drivers to detect, understand, and correctly respond to the warning information presented by the system. In the current study, a large range of alternative SODS DVI designs were identified and evaluated to determine potential DVI characteristics that enhance driver acceptance. Key issues, including driver preferences for the format, location, and symbology of SODS [...] ...|$|E

30|$|The use of {{obstacle}} detection equipment, which detects the preceding vehicle {{by means of}} millimeter wave radar, is already well established [14 – 18]. When the {{obstacle detection}} equipment detects a vehicle (obstacle) in the path ahead of the <b>driver's</b> <b>vehicle,</b> the turning radius of the <b>driver's</b> <b>vehicle</b> (calculated based on the values from the yaw rate sensor and steering angle sensor) is used to estimate {{the position of the}} preceding vehicle after the next radar scan. The system then judges whether or not the estimated position of the preceding vehicle matches the position detected after the radar scan. As long as the turning radius of the <b>driver's</b> <b>vehicle</b> does not change significantly between the radar scans, then calculating the amount of offset of the detected preceding vehicle from its path center line allows the future position of the preceding vehicle to be easily estimated. In particular when the speeds of the <b>driver's</b> <b>vehicle</b> and the preceding vehicle are approximately the same, the amount of this offset can be assumed to be unchanging between radar scans, making it possible to easily predict the position of the preceding vehicle. However as described above, on expressways where the vehicles are travelling at high speed, if there is a curve where the turning radius of the <b>driver's</b> <b>vehicle</b> changes between radar scans, the sideslip that occurs when the vehicle corners causes the amount of offset from the preceding vehicle path center line to change. As a result, it becomes impossible to accurately estimate the position of the preceding <b>vehicle,</b> and the <b>driver's</b> <b>vehicle</b> accelerates, producing a potentially dangerous situation.|$|R

30|$|For the {{following}} operation, ACC performs control {{in order to}} maintain a constant distance. However, for example, when the preceding vehicle is traveling close to the second vehicle ahead, and if the preceding vehicle brakes and accelerates suddenly and repeatedly (jerky motions), the <b>driver's</b> own <b>vehicle</b> is forced to perform the same jerky motions. As a result, such a system cannot be expected to provide good ride quality and a feeling of safety. Therefore, it is necessary to change from velocity control which maintains a constant distance between the <b>driver's</b> <b>vehicle</b> and the preceding vehicle to velocity control which maintains a constant distance between the <b>driver's</b> <b>vehicle</b> and the second vehicle ahead. In this way, even if the preceding vehicle performs repeated jerky motions, the <b>driver's</b> own <b>vehicle</b> is not forced to perform sudden braking and acceleration. This results in a definite improvement to the ride quality and the feeling of safety.|$|R

40|$|A {{wide range}} of <b>driver</b> and <b>vehicle</b> models have been {{proposed}} by traffic psychologists, engineers and traffic simulation researchers to assess crash risks. However, existing approaches are often confined within a single discipline and lack concepts that formally express the complexity of interactions between the <b>driver,</b> <b>vehicle</b> and environment {{as well as the}} broader scope and the interdisciplinary nature of the driving behaviour modeling. For example, traffic psychologists have defined a driver performance model as the driver's perceptual and motor skills (capabilities), or what the driver can do. In contrast, a driver behavior model refers to what the driver actually does do while driving (Evans, 1991). A driver behaviour model is determined by an infinite and complex number of factors related to the environment, <b>driver</b> and <b>vehicle</b> but is not explicitly modeled in Evans (1991). Existing driver models lack substantive concepts that express the interactions between the <b>Driver,</b> <b>Vehicle</b> and Environment (DVE). A new Integrated Driver-Vehicle-Environment (I-DVE) model is formally presented as a set of concepts and equations representing interactions between the <b>driver,</b> <b>vehicle</b> and environment with the view to assess crash risks. The I-DVE model features realistic and measurable attributes, which ultimately influence the driving performance and associated crash risks. I-DVE model is validated in a simulation. The simulation uses empirical data related to Time To Collision (TTC), Energy Equivalent Speed (EES), injury severity and driver profile to assess crash risks. This paper (i) reviews existing driver modeling approaches and highlights the need for an integrated approach, (ii) defines a novel model capable of expressing risks associated interaction between the <b>driver,</b> environment and <b>vehicle</b> and (iii) provides directions for further research in driver behaviour modeling...|$|R
