It proposes replacing the current right of open access to <b>high</b> <b>seas</b> fisheries with defined property rights issued to nation states and managed within a governance framework designed to optimise environmental and economic outcomes from the use of <b>high</b> <b>seas</b> fisheries. We propose that the <b>high</b> <b>seas</b> freedom to fish be transformed to a right to share in the net wealth generated from sustainable harvest of <b>high</b> <b>seas</b> fisheries. Management of <b>high</b> <b>seas</b> fisheries should ensure that: (i) all nations have a right to benefit from <b>high</b> <b>seas</b> fisheries, (ii) all harvesting is environmentally sustainable, (iii) fisheries resources are used efficiently, and (iv) management agencies are accountable. Rather than relying on the cooperation of nations through regional fisheries management organisations (RFMOs), we suggest the establishment of accountable management organisations of which nations are beneficial owners.

40|$|This {{article will}} {{consider}} the broad geopolitical considerations in measures towards biodiversity conservation and governance of <b>high</b> <b>seas</b> areas. Traditionally, international law has provided for jurisdiction based upon flag State in <b>high</b> <b>seas</b> areas, and States have shown themselves reluctant to depart from this model. International organisations with responsibility for <b>high</b> <b>seas</b> living resource management have proven, in many cases, to be of limited utility in the sustainable management of <b>high</b> <b>seas</b> resources. This traditional norm of flag State jurisdiction, while still dominant, is now being joined {{by the use of}} supra-national management in the context of regional fisheries organisations under the United Nations Fish Stocks Agreement. Part of the reason for this limited effectiveness is the focus of individual States on national interest, which may undermine international cooperation. The paper explores what mechanisms exist within international law that would permit a more effective management of <b>high</b> <b>seas</b> biodiversity conservation, and how these may be used to combat the erosion of the effectiveness of measures by individual State interests. Recognition of geopolitical factors that undermine cooperation in biodiversity conservation, and active efforts to address these matters, will prove essential in the establishment of a successful regime for <b>high</b> <b>seas</b> areas. <b>High</b> <b>seas</b> Biodiversity conservation Marine parks Geopolitics...|$|R
40|$|The <b>high</b> <b>seas</b> {{fisheries}} are {{troubled by}} overcapacity and lax enforcement of management rules. The idea has emerged that these problems could {{be dealt with}} by property rights solutions such as ITQs. Such management tools only emerged after the 200 -mile EEZ was established. This made it possible to apply the sovereign state's legislative, enforcement and judiciary apparatus to regulate fisheries. It is argued that without the EEZ such solutions would have been unlikely to emerge, and that a further extension of the EEZ is necessary to apply rights-based regulations to <b>high</b> <b>seas</b> fisheries. The current management regime of <b>high</b> <b>seas</b> fisheries lacks the necessary enforcement apparatus, which makes it necessary to apply trade sanctions, port measures and blacklisting to support regulations of <b>high</b> <b>seas</b> fisheries.

40|$|Recent {{years have}} {{witnessed}} numerous reports of vessels without nationality fishing in contravention of international {{conservation and management}} measures. During the summer of 1998, for example, four vessels registered to Sierra Leone were sighted fishing on the <b>high</b> <b>seas</b> in the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization (NAFO) regulatory area. These vessels were known throughout {{the international community to}} be flying 2 ̆ 2 flags of convenience 2 ̆ 2 [...] having only the most tenuous link to their flag state. Bowing to direct diplomatic pressure, Sierra Leone refuted the vessels 2 ̆ 7 registration, rendering them stateless and, therefore, subject to the jurisdiction of any state that approached them on the <b>high</b> <b>seas.</b> Such situations are becoming more common. The apparent increase in vessels fishing on the <b>high</b> <b>seas</b> without the protection of a flag state likely has several causes. Many states, like Sierra Leone, known to grant flags of convenience, have yielded to direct diplomatic pressure and purged their registries of illegitimate vessels. Others have begun voluntarily applying the principles underlying the 1995 United Nations Agreement on the Conservation and Management of Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks and the 1993 Food and Agriculture Agreement to Promote Compliance with International Conservation and Management Measures by Fishing Vessels on the <b>High</b> <b>Seas.</b> Unfortunately, neither the international community nor the United States has effective tools at its disposal to deal with stateless vessels fishing illegally on the <b>high</b> <b>seas.</b> This Article reviews the current status of international and United States domestic law applicable to vessels without nationality seen fishing the <b>high</b> <b>seas</b> in contravention of international conservation and management measures.

40|$|The World's {{fisheries}} are in {{a desperate}} state, they have been utilised {{to a point where}} a majority of the fisheries resources are fully exploited. In addition to overfishing, the responsibility of the sad state of affairs of the world's High Seas' fish stocks can be put down to inefficient management. The <b>high</b> <b>seas</b> fisheries regime is dominated by two powerful, tried, tested and consented to norms: the principle of freedom of fishing on the <b>high</b> <b>seas</b> and the principle of exclusive flag state jurisdiction over flagged vessels on the <b>high</b> <b>seas.</b> These Grotius norms (unintentionally) obstruct effective and meaningful <b>high</b> <b>seas</b> fisheries management, and have enabled unscrupulous states and actors {{to take advantage of the}} lacunae created by the UNCLOS <b>High</b> <b>Seas</b> fisheries framework and engage in IUU fishing which has resulted in a tragedy of the <b>high</b> <b>seas</b> commons. Furthermore these norms have a 'hobbling' effect on RFMOS and coastal states alike, and leave them almost powerless to ensure flag-state compliance with their sustainable fishing measures without the consent of the flag state, and totally unable to enforce its measures directly on that flagged vessel. Thus in the absence of an express reference to the superiority of coastal state rights over those of <b>high</b> <b>seas</b> fishing states, freedom of <b>high</b> <b>seas</b> fishing prevails. However the international community armed with weaker UNCLOS obligations of conservation and co-operation and have fought the good fight, and in lightening speed have constructed a normative framework that is additional to but consistent and complimentary with the UNCLOS regime. With the use of port state measures, voluntary instruments that codify responsible fisheries practice, surveillance and the denial of the right to land IUU fish – the fight is gradually beginning to turn in favour of the international community...|$|R
40|$|Research PaperAlthough the 1982 UNCLOS endeavoured to {{establish}} EEZs and assist coastal states {{in being able}} to manage the resources throughout their range to some extent, it became obvious that further agreements were necessary to expand upon states’ international obligations in relation to conservation and management of living resources on the <b>High</b> <b>Seas.</b> The 1995 Agreement concluded {{as a result of the}} United Nations Conference on Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks and a number of other international agreements have set the scene for significant change in <b>High</b> <b>Seas</b> fisheries management. In particular, through the auspices of regional fisheries management organizations (RFMOs) and arrangements, state parties will be under an obligation to co-operate and agree, where appropriate, on participatory rights in <b>High</b> <b>Seas</b> fisheries, including allocations of allowable catch or levels of fishing effort. The 1995 Agreement, however, only indirectly confronts the principal underlying reasons for the often competing interests of coastal and <b>High</b> <b>Seas</b> states – namely, the allocation of limited resources. The same “tragedy of the commons” issues that have plagued fisheries management, notwithstanding the extension of coastal state jurisdictions out to 200 miles, are set to continue and will become more apparent on the <b>High</b> <b>Seas.</b> This paper will discuss and explore the legal implications and authority for limited entry and rights-based fishing on the <b>High</b> <b>Seas</b> within this new international legal structure. In particular, the paper will set out the mechanism and advocate the benefits of the allocation of individual property rights on the <b>High</b> <b>Seas</b> to state nationals as a vital conjunct of the development of international conservation and management measures of living resources on the <b>High</b> <b>Seas.</b> These issues will be canvassed within the context of migratory (Bluefin Tuna) and demersal (Tasman Rise Orange Roughy) fisheries...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} how <b>high</b> <b>seas</b> closure {{will affect the}} availability of commonly consumed food fish in 46 fish reliant, and/or low income countries. Domestic consumption of straddling fish species (fish that {{would be affected by}} <b>high</b> <b>seas</b> closure) occurred in 54 % of the assessed countries. The majority (70 %) of countries were projected to experience net catch gains following <b>high</b> <b>seas</b> closure. However, countries with projected catch gains and that also consumed the straddling fish species domestically made up only 37 % of the assessed countries. In contrast, much fewer countries (25 %) were projected to incur net losses from <b>high</b> <b>seas</b> closure, and of these, straddling species were used domestically in less than half (45 %) of the countries. Our findings suggest that, given the current consumption patterns of straddling species, <b>high</b> <b>seas</b> closure may only directly benefit the supply of domestically consumed food fish in a small number of fish reliant and/or low income countries. In particular, it may not have a substantial impact on improving domestic fish supply in countries with the greatest need for improved access to affordable fish, as only one third of this group used straddling fish species domestically. Also, food security in countries with projected net catch gains but where straddling fish species are not consumed domestically may still benefit indirectly via economic activities arising from the increased availability of non-domestically consumed straddling fish species following <b>high</b> <b>seas</b> closure. Consequently, this study suggests that <b>high</b> <b>seas</b> closure can potentially improve marine resource sustainability as well as contribute to human well-being in some of the poorest and most fish dependent countries worldwide. However, caution is required because <b>high</b> <b>seas</b> closure may also negatively affect fish availability in countries that are already impoverished and fish insecure...|$|R
