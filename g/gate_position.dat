50|$|Growth {{signals are}} {{passed to the}} direct neighbors of the neuron cell {{according}} to its chromosome information. The blank neighbors, which receive a neural growth signal, turn into either an axon cell or a dendrite cell. The growth signals include information containing the cell type of the cell {{that is to be}} grown from the signal. To decide in which directions axonal or dendritic trails should grow, the grown cells consult their chromosome information which encodes the growth instructions. These growth instructions can have an absolute or a relative directional encoding. An absolute encoding masks the six neighbors (i.e. directions) of a 3D cell with six bits. After a cell is grown, it accepts growth signals only from the direction from which it received its first signal. This reception direction information is stored in the <b>gate</b> <b>position</b> of each cell's state.|$|E

40|$|This work {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} designing fault tolerant controllers for a water delivery canal that tackle actuators faults. The type of faults considered consists of blocking {{of one of the}} gates. The detection of the fault is made by comparing the <b>gate</b> <b>position</b> command with the actual (measured) <b>gate</b> <b>position.</b> Both centralized and distributed controllers are made for local upstream water level control. Centralized controllers are multivariable LQG-LTR controllers that use a model of the system with all the available manipulated inputs (gate positions) and all the available outputs (pool levels). Initially, three gates and three pools are controlled. After the fault detection, the controller is reconfigured to use the only two still operating gates and the corresponding two pool water levels. Distributed control uses local (SISO) LQG-LTR controllers that negotiate with their neighbors in order to be coordinated. When a fault occurs, this negotiation takes place only among the controllers connected to the actuators that are not in a fault state. Experimental results obtained in a pilot canal are presented...|$|E
