He added the one-handed backhand to his repertoire midway through 2011 as was evident in his matches against Murray in the final of Queen's Club and against Federer in the quarterfinals of Wimbledon.

500|$|In {{the view}} of {{champion}} Collingwood full-forward Gordon Coventry, whose record of 1299 VFL career goals between 1920 and 1937 would not be surpassed for 62 years, if Nash had played at full-forward for his entire career, he would have kicked more goals than anyone, Coventry included. In 1936 Coventry stated that Nash was the best player he had seen; [...] "No player is more versatile, for <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>play</b> anywhere.

While <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>play</b> as a defensive midfielder, Diaby has often attempted to distance himself from that position, admitting that [...] "I am better if I have a holding midfielder with me". His club manager Arsène Wenger describes him similarly stating [...] "He (Diaby) is more of an offensive player. He is not a defensive-minded player and he's not a holding player. He's a player who crosses the field at ease, goes from box to box like it's no distance and has good power as well".
