Aiming at {{the solar}} {{photovoltaic}} characteristics {{and the lower}} transformation efficiency problem in grid-connected photovoltaic power generation, a maximum <b>power</b> <b>point</b> tracking (MPPT) algorithm is put forward.

However, the output power induced in the photovoltaic modules is influenced by an intensity of solar cell radiation, temperature of the solar cells.

In this paper, a new maximum <b>power</b> <b>point</b> tracker (MPPT) using Perturb & Observe algorithm is proposed to improve energy conversion efficiency. Maximum <b>power</b> <b>point</b> tracking is an important function in all photovoltaic (PV) power systems.

A photovoltaic system coupled with a DC/DC converter is modeled in SPICE for verification and simulation purposes. The simulation results have presented that, for some cases, those MPPT algorithms can find out effectively the global maximum <b>power</b> <b>points</b> of the considered photovoltaic system.
