40|$|Abstract: The <b>Green</b> Leaf <b>Certification</b> is Thailand’s nationally {{recognised}} {{certification of}} environment friendly hotels. Hotels interested in obtaining <b>Green</b> Leaf <b>Certification</b> must demonstrate their practical commitment towards {{environmental protection and}} efficient consumption of energy and natural resources. Although Thailand has been promoting the <b>Green</b> Leaf <b>Certification</b> for about 15 years, the number of certified hotels is less than 5 %. This study aims to investigate the barriers {{in the path of}} implementing the <b>Green</b> Leaf <b>Certification</b> by hotel operators, with a particular focus on small-and medium-sized hotels (SMHs). The top executives of SMHs were invited to participate in this study, in which an in-depth interview technique was used to probe the deep hindrances of implementing the green practice according to this standard. The results reveal that SMHs have taken several environmental steps towards participating in the green leaf programme. Their employees are highly involved in greening activities, but these hotels are facing several barriers including certification standards considered too high and several criteria that obstruct service operations. In addition, there is no empirical evidence to suggest that SMHs gain competitive advantages in the market with the <b>Green</b> Leaf <b>Certification.</b> Moreover, the cost of green products is rather high and the number of green suppliers is limited. Finally, SMHs have a limited budget for investing in green projects; moreover the government provides inconsistent support...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: This study aims {{to examine}} whether Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) {{certification}} yields additional premiums for Shanghai’s office rental sector. Design/methodology/approach: The hedonic model is utilized to evaluate the impact of LEED, {{as well as of}} other factors, on the rental values of 59 Grade A office buildings in Shanghai, including 23 LEED-certified buildings and 36 non-LEED-certified buildings. Findings: It is found that rental values of buildings with LEED are about 12. 8 per cent than those of buildings without the same certification. Other factors, for instance accessibility to facilities such as subway station and 4 -star hotels, the availability of catering services in surrounding areas as well as the building’s location (i. e. inside the CBD) also are significantly positively correlated with office rents in the sample commercial buildings. Originality/value: Besides being one of the earlier contributions to the literature with regard {{to the study of the}} impact of <b>green</b> <b>certifications</b> in China’s office market, the findings in this study also provide some empirical evidence for stakeholders, such as developers, investors, property managers and market practitioners, to evaluate the introduction of green features (and/or <b>green</b> <b>certifications</b> such as LEED) as an investment decision.
