6000|$|Now {{for the one}} I {{played on}} myself. I must first give you the scene and the dramatis personæ. There are an old major and his youngish wife here in the next apartments to me. His bedroom door opens at an angle with my sitting-room door. Yesterday I was reading as demurely as a parish clerk, when I heard a rap at the door. I got up and opened it; no one was to be seen. I listened, and heard some one in the major's room. Not content with this, I went upstairs and down, looked in the {{cupboards}} and watch'd. At last I set myself to read again, not quite so demurely, when there came a louder rap. I was determined {{to find out who}} it was. I looked out; the staircases were all silent. [...] "This must be the major's wife," [...] said I. [...] "At all events I will see the truth." [...] So I rapt me at the major's door and went in, to the utter surprise and confusion of the lady, who was in reality there. After a little explanation, which I can no more describe than fly, I made my retreat from her, convinced of my mistake. She is to all appearance a silly body, and is really surprised about it. She must have been, for I have discovered that a little girl in the house was the rapper. I assure you she has nearly made me sneeze. If the lady tells tits, I shall put a very grave and moral face on the matter with the old gentleman, and make his little boy a present of a <b>humming</b> <b>top.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The drama {{includes}} {{a number of}} episodes derived from scenes described in Edmund Gosse's book. The nearest parallel {{to the story of}} the sailing boat is Gosse's description of his childhood prayer to have a [...] "humming top", for which his parents told him was inappropriate to pray. He replied that his father had [...] "said we ought to pray for things we needed, and I needed a <b>humming</b> <b>top</b> a great deal more more than I did the conversion of the heathen or the restitution of Jerusalem to the Jews, two objects of my nightly supplication which left me very cold." [...] An episode in which a visitor is surprised to learn that young Edmund has never heard of Robin Hood is derived from a passage in which he states that his mother banned all fictional stories from the house on the grounds that fiction was a form of lies. He writes [...] "I was familiar with humming-birds but had never heard of fairies. Jack the Giant Killer, Rumpelstiltskin and Robin Hood were not of my acquaintance".|$|E
50|$|During {{the late}} 1950s, he began {{nurturing}} {{his interest in}} contemporary music. In his small home studio, he experimented {{with the sounds of}} musique concrète. In January 1960, Leslie pressed a single acetate called Music of the Future. All Leslie recordings were later licensed to Joseph Weinburger, and Leslie's recordings were pressed onto a short series of 78rpm library discs, occasionally being put to use in science and mystery based programing, such as early Doctor Who episodes. He used a great number of tape sources to create his pieces; some sources he mentions in his liner notes are motor horns, <b>humming</b> <b>tops</b> and bells.|$|R
25|$|Born in Frumușica, {{a village}} of Botoșani County, the future writer belonged to the Jewish Romanian community. His father was a cattle trader, and Ornea often helped in the family {{business}} by tending to the animals (an experience which left him with fond memories). He was a cousin of Romanian-born Israeli writer Mariana Juster, who later left details on their early life. According to her account, Ornea spent the years before World War II in his native village, until all Jews in the nation's rural areas were expelled with the acquiescence of the antisemitic regime of Conducător Ion Antonescu, and thereafter forced to wear the yellow badge (see Holocaust in Romania). He subsequently settled in the ghetto of Botoșani city, where he lived in poverty and isolation, spending {{some of the money}} he had left on adventure novels, and ultimately set up a small clandestine business dealing in <b>humming</b> <b>tops.</b> The Police representative shut down the enterprise, on the basis of legislation which prevented Jews from owning firms, and Ornea is said to have narrowly escaped further repercussion by bribing him with tobacco.|$|R
6000|$|Nevertheless, the {{children}} rejoiced greatly in the snow-storm. They {{had already made}} acquaintance with it, by tumbling heels over head into its highest drifts, and flinging snow at one another, as we have just fancied the Berkshire mountains to be doing. And now they {{had come back to}} their spacious play-room, which was as big as the great drawing-room, and was lumbered with all sorts of playthings, large and small. The biggest was a rocking-horse, that looked like a real pony; and there was a whole family of wooden, waxen, plaster, and china dolls, besides rag-babies; and blocks enough to build Bunker Hill Monument, and nine-pins, and balls, and <b>humming</b> <b>tops,</b> and battledores, and grace-sticks, and skipping-ropes, and more of such valuable property than I could tell of in a printed page. But {{the children}} liked the snow-storm better than them all. It suggested so many brisk enjoyments for to-morrow, and all the remainder of the winter. The sleigh-ride; the slides down hill into the valley; the snow-images that were to be shaped out; the snow-fortresses that were to be built; and the snowballing to be carried on! ...|$|R
60|$|Night came on rapidly after that, {{and with}} the coming of utter {{darkness}} the fury of the elements appeared to increase. The wind shrieked and whistled through the timber and <b>hummed</b> in the <b>tops</b> of the spruces overhead. Occasionally they would hear a crash, as some mighty tree would be laid low, and they trembled for fear the storm would damage their shelter.|$|R
60|$|Down, down, they sped, {{the wheels}} <b>humming</b> like a <b>top,</b> the dog-cart rocking right and left, its axis {{acquiring}} a slightly oblique set {{in relation to}} the line of progress; the figure of the horse rising and falling in undulations before them. Sometimes a wheel was off the ground, it seemed, for many yards; sometimes a stone was sent spinning over the hedge, and flinty sparks from the horse's hoofs outshone the daylight. The aspect of the straight road enlarged with their advance, the two banks dividing like a splitting stick; one rushing past at each shoulder.|$|R
60|$|The {{man he had}} {{followed}} had apparently come there to meet somebody, but although the mine was conveniently near the town {{it was a cold}} and cheerless spot for a rendezvous, Foster surmised from this that secrecy was important, but after all there was nothing to indicate that the matter {{had anything to do with}} him. As he went back he heard a musical <b>humming</b> in the <b>tops</b> of the pines and a lump of wet snow, slipping from a branch, struck his face. The humming grew louder until the wood was filled with sound, and he began to feel clammy and hot. A warm Chinook wind from the Pacific was sweeping up the valley, driving back the frost.|$|R
6000|$|Blanche {{looked at}} her uncle. [...] "Begin! begin! Don't lose time!" [...] cried the ardent Sir Patrick, {{pointing}} toward the house with his cane. [...] "Certainly, uncle! Any thing that you wish!" [...] With that parting shot at her step-mother, Blanche withdrew. Arnold, who had thus far waited in silence {{at the foot of}} the steps, looked appealingly at Sir Patrick. The train which was to take him to his newly inherited property would start in less than an hour; and he had not presented himself to Blanche's guardian in the character of Blanche's suitor yet! Sir Patrick's indifference to all domestic claims on him--claims of persons who loved, and claims of persons who hated, it didn't matter which--remained perfectly unassailable. There he stood, poised on his cane, humming an old Scotch air. And there was Lady Lundie, resolute not to leave him till he had seen the governess with her eyes and judged the governess with her mind. She returned to the charge--in spite of Sir Patrick, <b>humming</b> at the <b>top</b> of the steps, and of Arnold, waiting at the bottom. (Her enemies said, [...] "No wonder poor Sir Thomas died in a few months after his marriage!" [...] And, oh dear me, our enemies are sometimes right!) ...|$|R
6000|$|These wheelings and {{movements}} {{in the region of}} the Argonne, which are all faithfully described by Dumouriez himself, and more interesting to us than Hoyle's or Philidor's best Game of Chess, let us, nevertheless, O Reader, entirely omit;--and hasten to remark two things: the first a minute private, the second a large public thing. Our minute private thing is: the presence, in the Prussian host, in that war-game of the Argonne, of a certain Man, belonging to the sort called Immortal; who, in days since then, is becoming visible more and more, in that character, as the Transitory more and more vanishes; for from of old it was remarked that when the Gods appear among men, it is seldom in recognisable shape; thus Admetus' neatherds give Apollo a draught of their goatskin whey-bottle (well if they do not give him strokes with their ox-rungs), not dreaming that he is the Sungod! This man's name is Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. He is Herzog Weimar's Minister, come with the small contingent of Weimar; to do insignificant unmilitary duty here; very irrecognizable to nearly all! He stands at present, with drawn bridle, on the height near Saint-Menehould, making an experiment on the 'cannon-fever;' having ridden thither against persuasion, into the dance and firing of the cannon-balls, with a scientific desire to understand what that same cannon-fever may be: 'The sound of them,' says he, 'is curious enough; as if it were compounded of the <b>humming</b> of <b>tops,</b> the gurgling of water and the whistle of birds. By degrees you get a very uncommon sensation; which can only be described by similitude. It seems as if you were in some place extremely hot, {{and at the same time}} were completely penetrated by the heat of it; so that you feel as if you and this element you are in were perfectly on a par. The eyesight loses nothing of its strength or distinctness; and yet it is as if all things had got a kind of brown-red colour, which makes the situation and the objects still more impressive on you.' (Goethe, Campagne in Frankreich, Werke, xxx. 73.) ...|$|R
