This establishes the existence of higher-dimensional Hadamard matrices of order (4 t) t for t odd, 1 ≤ t ≤ 33 and several infinite families, all of propriety (2, 2, [...] ., 2).

50|$|TIGER was {{originally}} formed in 1995 as TaiDe composite material processing plant to produce sports and medical equipments constructed of composite material. Eventually, the company expanded its products to include {{carbon fiber composite}} material and became an established supplier of manned aircraft and UAV subsystems such as airframe, wings and other aerospace components constructed of {{carbon fiber composite material}}. Experience of producing aerospace components helped TIGER to further expand its product to entire UAV itself, and work on an indigenous design begun in 2011, but such plan was hampered by lack of sufficient fund. In 2012, the plan to produce its own UAV was finally becoming a reality when TIGER is bought by CBA, which is a Chinese conglomerate whose business mainly concentrated in the four very diverse arenas, including pharmaceutical, real estate, alternative energy, and cultural industry. With influx of investment, the original plan was completed as Type 01 UAV, and in 2012, <b>design</b> <b>of</b> <b>Type</b> 02 UAV was completed, {{and by the end of}} 2013, <b>design</b> <b>of</b> <b>Type</b> 03 UAV has been completed.
