5|$|Weber was {{concerned}} {{with the question of}} objectivity and subjectivity. Weber distinguished social action from social behavior, noting that social action must be understood through how individuals subjectively relate to one another. Study of social action through interpretive means (Verstehen) must be based upon understanding the subjective meaning and purpose that individuals attach to their actions. Social actions may have easily identifiable and objective means, but much more subjective ends and the understanding of those ends by a scientist is subject to yet another layer of subjective understanding (that of the scientist). Weber noted that the importance of subjectivity in social sciences makes creation of <b>fool-proof,</b> universal laws much more difficult than in natural sciences and that the amount of objective knowledge that social sciences may achieve is precariously limited. Overall, Weber supported the goal of objective science, but he noted that it is an unreachable goal– although one definitely worth striving for.|$|E

25|$|Correctly calculating bonus pins can be difficult, {{especially}} when combinations of strikes and spares come in successive frames. In modern times, however, {{this has been}} overcome with automated scoring systems, linked to the pinsetters that set and clear the pins between frames. A computer automatically counts pins that remain standing, and fills in a virtual score sheet (usually displayed on monitors above each lane). However, even the automated system is not <b>fool-proof,</b> as the computer can miscount the number of pins that remain standing.|$|E
40|$|The {{issue of}} land {{intensification}} impacts on Below-Ground BioDiversity (BGBD) erosion is often addressed by linking soil micro-, meso- and macro-fauna quantity with land cover. However, {{it is also}} possible to adopt a deductive approach by drawing the geography and the dynamics of farming practices- related to Soil Organic Matter (SOM) management- with a direct bearing on BGBD. This integrative approach is based on an analysis of the socioeconomics of land cover, e. g. determinants of farming practices. It helps building scenarii on future evolution of soil fertility. This paper presents the outcomes of two fieldworks in the Taita Hills and their surrounding semi-arid plains, South-East Kenya. Small-scale farmers adopt various strategies to cope with increasing land scarcity. Some strategies are particularly outstanding, e. g. the intensification of the farming practices in the more humid highlands or the agrarian colonisation of the semi-arid foothills and lowlands. This study required a multidisciplinary and systemic approach. Based on an extensive data collection on a 52 square km area, in-depth interviews and <b>fool-proofing</b> process, involvin...|$|R
40|$|Many {{innovative}} designs {{only serve}} the needs of those who are rich and who already dominate a large share of resources. Few designs consider the needs of the deprived. The design team at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University conducted an applied research project in Nepal to design a new filter container (Filtainer) to {{serve the needs}} of the deprived. The project was conducted in collaboration with the research team at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), which had invented a filtration method for removing arsenic from water. The new container maintains the effective filtration of MIT’s original invention, while improving the degree of userfitness and minimizing the cost of production. This paper introduces the background, objectives, and research methods of the project. By presenting the research findings and illustrating the design, the paper emphasizes the importance of conducting in-depth research into users’ needs so that the design of products meets these needs and takes into account users’ daily practices. The paper presents the detailed design of the filter and discusses how it achieves a high degree of <b>fool-proofing</b> to provide clean and safe water for the deprived. School of Desig...|$|R
25|$|A new {{generation}} of designs for nuclear power stations, known as the Generation IV reactors, {{are the subject of}} active research. Many of these new designs specifically attempt to make fission reactors cleaner, safer and/or less of a risk to the proliferation of nuclear weapons. Passively safe stations (such as the ESBWR) are available to be built and other reactors that are designed to be nearly <b>fool-proof</b> are being pursued. Fusion reactors, which are still {{in the early stages of}} development, diminish or eliminate some of the risks associated with nuclear fission.|$|E

25|$|Exorcism by a Christian priest {{works in}} some tales; {{the bishop of}} Hildesheim managed to exorcise Hödekin from the castle. Even this method is not <b>fool-proof,</b> however; when an exorcist tried to drive away Heinzelmann, the kobold tore up the priest's holy book, strewed it about the room, {{attacked}} the exorcist, and chased him away. Insulting a kobold may drive it away, but not without a curse; when someone tried to see his true form, Goldemar left the home and vowed that the house would now be as unlucky {{as it had been}} fortunate under his care. Actions a Hütchen considers insulting include giving him clothing, rushing him in his work, burning the house down, and leaving a wagon wheel in front of it.|$|E

2500|$|That day, the EU {{proposed}} issuing £135,000,000 {{in agricultural}} compensation to its farmers. The EU agriculture commissioner said the EU's farmers {{could get back}} up to 30% {{of the cost of}} vegetables they were unable to sell. The EU's health commissioner, John Dalli, had formally criticised Germany earlier that day for rushing out [...] "premature conclusions" [...] about the source of an outbreak, and only helped to spread alarm among the public and farmers and untimely leading to the damaging the EU's agriculture sector. John Dalli also told the EU parliament in Strasbourg that claims had to be scientifically sound, unbiased, and <b>fool-proof</b> in nature before it was publicised in future.|$|E
2500|$|Alexander Vinokourov {{began the}} Tour {{as one of}} the favourites. Vinokourov's A test {{revealed}} two different types of red blood cells in his circulatory system indicating he had a blood transfusion prior to the stage. A blood transfusion is meant {{to increase the number of}} red blood cells in the body, improving oxygen flow from the lungs to the muscles. Vinokourov rejected the positive test, blaming the anomaly on excessive blood flow in his thighs following a heavy collision earlier in the Tour. Accordingly, he asked for his B sample to be tested; however, the lab test for locating blood cells from another donor in [...] "old fashioned" [...] homologous transfusions is considered <b>fool-proof.</b> It was later revealed that he had also tested positive on his win of stage 15, and that his B sample had since returned [...] "non-negative".

2500|$|Judges also place a large {{weight on}} the amount of corroborating {{evidence}} that can be submitted to support each piece. [...] Typically, a judge will not admit a piece of evidence unless it can be supported by expert testimony, witnesses or other physical evidence. [...] One piece of evidence in a crime is somewhat meaningless. [...] Many pieces must fit together and support the prosecution’s (or the defense’s) theory. [...] Similarly, a judge will not grant admissibility to evidence that proves guilt or innocence without a doubt. [...] This rule is eagerly applied to matters of scientific evidence because juries tend to place too much emphasis on certain evidence, particularly DNA evidence, which is believed to be <b>fool-proof.</b> [...] It is preferred that the circumstances are reconstructed and confirmed in small pieces. [...] The admission of these pieces is viewed as unfair to the other counsel and is denied. The goal of the court is to leave a decision to be made by the jury after all of the evidence has been presented. [...] Large, sweeping evidentiary discoveries take the subjectivity of the evidence out, especially in regards to scientific discoveries.|$|E

60|$|I {{was born}} {{so long ago}} that I grew up before the era of gasolene. As a result, I am old-fashioned. I prefer a sail-boat to a motor-boat, and it is my belief that boat-sailing is a finer, more difficult, and {{sturdier}} art than running a motor. Gasolene engines are becoming <b>fool-proof,</b> and while it is unfair to say that any fool can run an engine, {{it is fair to say}} that almost any one can. Not so, when it comes to sailing a boat. More skill, more intelligence, and a vast deal more training are necessary. It is the finest training in the world for boy and youth and man. If the boy is very small, equip him with a small, comfortable skiff. He will do the rest. He won't need to be taught. Shortly he will be setting a tiny leg-of-mutton and steering with an oar. Then he will begin to talk keels and centreboards and want to take his blankets out and stop aboard all night.|$|E
