30|$|In this paper, a 2 -D {{system is}} {{considered}} in delta domain {{to adapt to}} a <b>fast</b> <b>sampling</b> rate and avoid the system instability caused by the <b>fast</b> <b>sampling</b> in this paper. Moreover, both time-varying delays and actuator saturation, which usually occur in the modern engineering field, are studied for a 2 -D delta operator system. Free weighting matrices, 2 -D Jensen inequalities, and linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) approaches are applied to stabilization analysis. Furthermore, an estimate of the domain of attraction is proposed for the 2 -D delta operator system. A state feedback controller is designed by Lyapunov–Krasovskii methods. Two numerical examples are shown to illustrate the effectiveness and advantages of the developed techniques.|$|R

40|$|Abstract [...] The {{objective}} of the Power System Stabilizer (PSS) is added to excitation system to enhance the damping during low frequency oscillations. This paper presents a comparison study of Simulated Annealing and <b>fast</b> output <b>sampling</b> based power system stabilizer (PSS) for stability enhancement. Conventional Power system stabilizers (CPSSs) are designed with the phase compensation technique in the frequency domain and include the lead-lag blocks and related parameters are tuned using an optimization method based on Simulated Annealing (SA). The performance of SA-PSS is evaluated at single-machine infinite bus system. In <b>fast</b> output <b>sampling</b> technique, the nonlinear model of single-machine infinite bus system is linearized at different operating point and a linear model is obtained. For this model, a common state feedback gain is obtained using LMI technique. A robust <b>fast</b> output <b>sampling</b> feedback gain which realizes output injection gain is obtained using LMI approach. This method does not require states of the system for feedback and is easily implementable. This robust <b>fast</b> output <b>sampling</b> control is applied to non-linear model of a single machine system at different operating (equilibrium) points. The simulation results clearly indicate the effectiveness {{and validity of the}} <b>fast</b> output <b>sampling</b> technique method.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Although {{metabolic}} profiles {{have been}} associated with chronic disease risk, lack of temporal stability of metabolite levels could limit their use in epidemiological investigations. The present study aims to evaluate the reliability over a two-year period of 158 metabolites and compare reliability over time in fasting and non-fasting serum samples. METHODS: Metabolites were measured with the AbsolueIDQp 180 kit (Biocrates, Innsbruck, Austria) by mass spectrometry and included acylcarnitines, amino acids, biogenic amines, hexoses, phosphatidylcholines and sphingomyelins. Measurements were performed on repeat serum samples collected two years apart in 27 fasting men from Turin, Italy, and 39 non-fasting women from Utrecht, The Netherlands, all participating in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study. Reproducibility was assessed by estimating intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) in multivariable mixed models. RESULTS: In <b>fasting</b> <b>samples,</b> a median ICC of 0. 70 was observed.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, a data-based state {{feedback}} control method is developed for a class of nonlinear systems. It is a real-time control method, which requires little prior knowledge about the system dynamics, and {{does not need to}} know or to build the mathematical model of the system. We apply a <b>fast</b> <b>sampling</b> technique to sample the state signal, which contains useful information of the system. The zero-order hold (ZOH) and the control switch are also used to obtain system information. The feedback gain matrix is calculated and adjusted according to these sampled data.

In this, {{the second part of}} the paper, a relationship between sampling rate and an estimated domain of attraction of the system is obtained by extending the analysis in Part 1 (1). This relationship indicates that a <b>faster</b> <b>sampling</b> rate can increase the estimated domain of attraction of the sampled-data system, a phenomenon well known in practice. Hence this study is a magnificent step towards understanding the effect of sampling on the behaviour of a sampled-data system.

40|$|Recent {{work on the}} use of {{discrete}} first-order approximate models of plant dynamics in multi-variable process control is extended to consider the effect on transient performance non-linearities such as measurement quantization or deadzone at the implement stage. Explicit upper bands on the transient error induced by the nonlinearity are obtained and their validity illustrated by nemerical examples. In particular, at <b>fast</b> <b>sampling</b> rates, it is seen that, not only does the first-order controller produce a closed-loop system with rapid, non-oscillating responses and small interaction effects, it also ensures that peak transient errors due to the non-linearity are less than the error involved in approximating the non-linearity by a unity grain matrix. For example, if the nonlinearity is measurement quantization, the peak transient effects of the quantization will be bounded by the quantization error itself at <b>fast</b> <b>sampling</b> rates, and will not be amplified by system dynamics...|$|R
