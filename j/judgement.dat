5|$|The Catholic Church teaches that, {{immediately}} after death, {{the soul of}} each person will receive a particular <b>judgement</b> from God, based on their sins {{and their relationship to}} Christ. This teaching also attests to another day when Christ will sit in universal <b>judgement</b> of all mankind. This final <b>judgement,</b> according to the church's teaching, will bring an end to human history and mark the beginning of both a new and better heaven and earth ruled by God in righteousness.|$|E
5|$|A Vision of the Last <b>Judgement</b> is a {{painting}} by William Blake that was designed in 1808 before becoming a lost artwork. The painting was to be shown in an 1810 exhibition with a detailed analysis added to a second edition of his Descriptive Catalogue. This plan was dropped after the exhibition was cancelled, and the painting disappeared. Blake's notes for the Descriptive Catalogue describe {{various aspects of the}} work in a detailed manner, which allow the aspects of the painting to be known. Additionally, earlier designs that reveal similar Blake depiction of the Last <b>Judgement</b> have survived, and these date back to an 1805 precursor design created for Robert Blair's The Grave. In addition to Blake's notes on the painting, a letter written to Ozias Humphrey provides a description of the various images within an earlier design of the Last <b>Judgement.</b>|$|E
40|$|Many {{scholars}} claimed that, {{according to}} Immanuel Kant, some <b>judgements</b> lack a truth-value: analytic <b>judgements,</b> <b>judgements</b> about items of which humans cannot have experience, <b>judgements</b> of perception, and non-assertoric <b>judgements.</b> However, {{no one has}} undertaken an extensive examination of the textual evidence for those claims. Based on an analysis of Kant's texts, I argue that: (1) according to Kant, only <b>judgements</b> of perception are not truth-apt. All other <b>judgements</b> are truth-apt, including analytic <b>judgements</b> and <b>judgements</b> about items of which humans cannot have experience. (2) Kant sometimes states that truth-apt <b>judgements</b> are actual bearers of truth or falsity only when they are taken to state what is actually the case. Kant calls these <b>judgements</b> assertoric. Other texts ascribe truth and falsity to <b>judgements,</b> {{regardless of whether they}} are assertoric. Kant's views on truth-aptness raise challenges for correspondentist and coherentist interpretations of Kant's theory of truth; they rule out the identification of Kant's crucial notion of objective validity with truth-aptness; and they imply that Kant was not a verificationist about truth or meaning...|$|R

5|$|Blake {{claimed to}} have seen visions {{throughout}} his life, and he claimed {{that they were a}} common aspect of life. His understanding of these events was, as he explained, similar to the experiences of biblical prophets. In the commentary to A Vision of the Last <b>Judgement,</b> Blake claimed that the image originated in a particular vision he experienced that allowed him to see the host of Heaven praising God. The actual design of A Vision of the Last <b>Judgement</b> was created in 1808 as an expansion of his 1805 work The Day of <b>Judgement.</b> Blake created this work to be used in Blair's The Grave, which was published 1808.|$|E

40|$|Recency <b>judgements</b> can be {{performed}} {{on the basis of}} across-event relational information that directly provides temporal order among past events. Non-relational item-based information internal to individual past events, such as information retrieved through familiarity, may also contribute to recency <b>judgements.</b> The present functional magnetic resonance imaging study examined neural substrates for item-based processing during recency <b>judgements</b> as an alternative to relational recency <b>judgements.</b> One half of word stimuli were encoded relationally prior to recency <b>judgements,</b> and the relational encoding of the other half was hampered such that the words were processed relatively in an item-based manner. Brain activity in the medial temporal lobe was observed during recency <b>judgements</b> for words studied with relational memory processing, whereas brain activity in the lateral temporal cortex was observed during recency <b>judgements</b> for words studied relatively in an item-based manner. It was revealed further that recognition of individual words per se, which can also be regarded as familiarity/recency <b>judgements</b> but is non-relational in nature, also activated the lateral temporal region. These results indicate multiple routes for recency <b>judgements</b> within the temporal lobe that are recruited depending on how past episodes are represented and retrieved for <b>judgements</b> of their temporal order...|$|R
40|$|Thought {{experiments}} invite us {{to evaluate}} philosophical theses by making <b>judgements</b> about hypothetical cases. When the <b>judgements</b> and the theses conflict, {{it is often}} the latter that are rejected. But {{what is the nature}} of the <b>judgements</b> such that they are able to play this role? I answer this question by arguing that typical <b>judgements</b> about thought experiments are in fact <b>judgements</b> of normal counterfactual sufficiency. I begin by focusing on Anna-Sara Malmgren’s defence of the claim that typical <b>judgements</b> about thought experiments are mere possibility <b>judgements.</b> This view is shown to fail for two closely related reasons: it cannot account for the incorrectness of certain misjudgements, and it cannot account for the inconsistency of certain pairs of conflicting <b>judgements.</b> This prompts a reconsideration of Timothy Williamson’s alternative proposal, according to which typical <b>judgements</b> about thought experiments are counterfactual in nature. I show that taking such <b>judgements</b> to concern what would normally hold in instances of the relevant hypothetical scenarios avoids the objections that have been pressed against this kind of view. I then consider some other potential objections, but argue that they provide no grounds for doubt...|$|R

40|$|Self-deprecating <b>judgements</b> of {{body size}} are a robust {{exception}} to the general tendency for people to make self-enhancing <b>judgements</b> of themselves. This paper investigates whether the failure to make self-enhancing body size <b>judgements</b> also generalises to <b>judgements</b> of other physically grounded attributes, namely, physical attractiveness and sexiness. Sixty Australian women and men aged between 18 and 88  years of age were photographed, and their own ratings of their body size, attractiveness and sexiness were compared with those made of them by others. Women and men made self-deprecating <b>judgements</b> of body size, but made self-enhancing <b>judgements</b> of attractiveness and sexiness. We suggest that the unambiguous nature of cultural standards for body size, rather than low self-esteem, accounts for the self-deprecating <b>judgements</b> of body size made by men and women...|$|R

40|$|A long-­‐standing debate {{surrounds}} {{the question as}} to what justifies memory <b>judgements.</b> According to the Past Reason Theory, these <b>judgements</b> are justified by the reasons we had to make identical <b>judgements</b> in the past, whereas the Present Reason Theory claims that these justifying reasons are to be found at the time we pass the memory <b>judgements.</b> In this paper, I defend the original claim that, far from being exclusive, these two theories should be applied to different kinds of memory <b>judgements.</b> The Past Reason Theory offers the most appealing account of justified propositional memory <b>judgements,</b> while the Present Reason Theory provides the best approach to justified episodic memory <b>judgements.</b> One outcome of my discussion is thus that memory is not epistemologically unified and my argumenti n favour of this conclusion connects with the issues of internalism, reliabilism and the basing relation...|$|R
40|$|It {{has long}} been claimed that moral <b>judgements</b> are {{dominated}} by reason. In recent years, however, the tide has turned. Many psychologists and philosophers now hold the view {{that there is a}} close empirical association between moral <b>judgements</b> and emotions. In particular, they claim that emotions (1) co-occur with moral <b>judgements,</b> (2) causally influence moral <b>judgements,</b> (3) are causally sufficient for moral <b>judgements,</b> and (4) are causally necessary for moral <b>judgements.</b> At first sight these hypotheses seem well-supported. In this paper I show, however, that appearances are deceiving. If one considers the relevant scientific studies in detail, one finds that in many interpretations the above hypotheses are either not supported or even contradicted by the available evidence. This conclusion is significant both for our understanding of moral <b>judgements</b> qua empirical phenomena and for normative ethics and metaethics...|$|R

40|$|It {{is often}} {{suggested}} that aesthetic and ethical value <b>judgements</b> {{are similar in}} such a way that they should be analysed in analogous manners.

This, I maintain, helps to explain why many philosophers have thought that aesthetic and ethical value <b>judgements</b> can be analysed in accordance with the same dispositional scheme which corresponds to the analogy between secondary qualities and values. However, I argue that aesthetic and ethical value <b>judgements</b> differ as regards their fundamental structures. This scheme is mistaken as regards ethical value <b>judgements,</b> but it is able to account for aesthetic value <b>judgements.</b> This implies that aesthetic value <b>judgements</b> are autonomous in relation to ethical value judements and that aestheticians, not moral philosophers, are the true heirs of this renowned analog...|$|R

It was demonstrated that the latter <b>judgements</b> often reflected the original evaluation of {{only one of the}} group members.

40|$|Rationale and objectives  Theory {{suggests}} that tacit clues inform clinical <b>judgements,</b> but the prevalence {{and role of}} tacit clues during clinical interactions is unknown. This study explored whether doctors and patients identify information likely to be tacit clues or <b>judgements</b> based on tacit clues during health maintenance examinations. Methods  Qualitative analysis of video elicitation interview transcripts involving 18 community‐based primary care doctors and 36 patients. Outcomes were description and analysis of tacit clues and <b>judgements</b> based on tacit clues mentioned by participants. Results  A total of 57 references to tacit clues and 53 references to <b>judgements</b> based on tacit clues were identified from patient and doctor transcripts. Non‐verbal behaviours comprised the most common category of tacit clues (53 % of doctor comments; 42 % of patient comments). Patients mostly discussed <b>judgements</b> based on tacit clues that related to the doctor–patient relationship. Doctors discussed actively using non‐verbal behaviours to provide patients with tacit clues about the doctor–patient relationship. They also mentioned tacit clues that informed medical <b>judgements</b> and decision making. Gestalt <b>judgements</b> based on tacit clues were common (33 % of doctor comments). Several participants identified instances {{in which they had}} difficulty articulating their rationale for specific <b>judgements.</b> Doctors varied widely in how frequently they mentioned tacit clues. Conclusion  During video elicitation interviews, patients and doctors identified tacit clues and <b>judgements</b> based on these clues as playing a role during health maintenance examinations.
