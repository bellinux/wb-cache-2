Though there is considerable measurement error in the <b>end</b> <b>dates</b> that can be corrected, the effect on evaluation results is modest, because for evaluation <b>end</b> <b>dates</b> are relevant only through indirect channels.

40|$|Abstract: With {{administrative}} data becoming increasingly important for empirical research, {{the quality of}} crucial variables of process generated data is of growing interest. This paper investigates reported <b>end</b> <b>dates</b> of further training programs in the German Integrated Employment Biographies Sample (IEBS) to gain insights {{on how to deal}} with this sensitive part of the IEBS in future studies and on how measurement error in program <b>end</b> <b>dates</b> affects evaluation results. Error-proneness of reported <b>end</b> <b>dates</b> in the IEBS is discussed, corrections are introduced and their impact on evaluation results is studied for different estimation frameworks using sensitivity analysis.

Error-proneness of <b>end</b> <b>dates</b> in the IEBS is discussed, correction procedures are introduced and their influence on estimated employment effects is analyzed using basic descriptive analysis, propensity score snatching and a descriptive duration model. Though there is considerable measurement error in the <b>end</b> <b>dates</b> that can be corrected, the effect on evaluation results is modest, because for evaluation <b>end</b> <b>dates</b> are relevant only through indirect channels. The impact on causal effects based on matching is highest during the lock-in period and for long programs. The advice for future users of the IEBS is to decide depending on their evaluation design and goal if an explicit correction of <b>end</b> <b>dates</b> is necessary. In case an explicit correction is dispensable, it seems still important to take care that program spells are not given priority to employment spells in case of conflict.

40|$|Many wars or {{conflicts}} in U. S. history have federally designated “periods of war,” dates marking their beginning and <b>ending.</b> These <b>dates</b> {{are important for}} qualification for certain veterans’ pension or disability benefits. Confusion can occur because beginning and <b>ending</b> <b>dates</b> for “periods of war” in many nonofficial sources are often different from those given in treaties and other official sources of information, and armistice dates can be confused with termination dates. This report lists the beginning and <b>ending</b> <b>dates</b> for “periods of war” found in Title 38 of the Code of Federal Regulations, dealing with the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). It also lists and differentiates other beginning dates given in declarations of war, as well as termination of hostilities dates and armistice and <b>ending</b> <b>dates</b> given in proclamations, laws, or treaties.
