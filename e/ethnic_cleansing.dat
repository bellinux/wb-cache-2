5|$|In June 2014, {{following}} {{the capture of}} Mosul by ISIS, Obama sent 275 troops to provide support and security for U.S. personnel and the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad. ISIS continued to gain ground and to commit widespread massacres and <b>ethnic</b> <b>cleansing.</b>|$|E
5|$|Martić {{was tried}} at the International Criminal Tribunal {{for the former}} Yugoslavia (ICTY) on several {{different}} charges of war crimes including, {{his involvement in the}} siege of Kijevo. The trial resulted in a guilty verdict, and the findings of the Trial Chamber regarding Kijevo, made in 2007, were confirmed by the ICTY Appeals Chamber in 2008, based on witness testimonies about it being <b>ethnic</b> <b>cleansing.</b> The siege was the first instance of use of the <b>ethnic</b> <b>cleansing</b> in the Yugoslav Wars. Croatian authorities tried Mladić in absentia and convicted him for war crimes committed in Kijevo.|$|E

5|$|In 1928, the Soviet Union began {{collectivization}} in Ingria. During the collectivization and <b>ethnic</b> <b>cleansing,</b> the Soviets captured, {{killed and}} deported Ingrian peasants, provoking widespread criticism by the Finnish media in 1930. Two years later, the nationalist Lapua Movement unsuccessfully attempted {{to overthrow the}} Finnish government in the Mäntsälä rebellion.|$|E
5|$|By March 1991, the {{conflict}} had escalated into the Croatian War of Independence and in June 1991, with the Breakup of Yugoslavia, Croatia declared its independence. The declaration came into effect on 8 October after a three-month moratorium. The SAO Krajina, renamed Republic of Serbian Krajina (RSK) on 19 December, then initiated {{a campaign of}} <b>ethnic</b> <b>cleansing</b> against Croatian civilians.|$|E
5|$|It {{is based}} in the Peace Palace in The Hague, sharing the {{building}} with the Hague Academy of International Law, a private centre {{for the study of}} international law. The ICJ's primary purpose is to adjudicate disputes among states. The court has heard cases related to war crimes, illegal state interference, <b>ethnic</b> <b>cleansing,</b> and other issues. The ICJ can also be called upon by other UN organs to provide advisory opinions.|$|E
5|$|This {{situation}} was mirrored in Abkhazia, an autonomous republic in the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic, where the Abkhaz seceded from Georgia {{during the war}} in the early 1990s. The population of Abkhazia was reduced to 216,000 after an <b>ethnic</b> <b>cleansing</b> of Georgians, the single largest ethnic group in the region, a decrease from 525,000 before the war. The upper Kodori Gorge (in northeast Abkhazia) remained beyond the unrecognised Abkhaz separatist government's control.|$|E
5|$|<b>Ethnic</b> <b>Cleansing</b> was {{developed}} {{by members of the}} National Alliance, an American white supremacist organization, and published by Resistance Records, its subsidiary record label that specializes in white power music. It {{was developed}} for Microsoft Windows personal computers using Eclipse Entertainment's open-source game engine Genesis3D along with the Reality Factory development kit. The source code was not substantially changed from the original. Instead, the developers simply plugged in images and sounds that they had created in freely available editing programs.|$|E
5|$|However, {{contrary}} to their stated objectives, Soviet {{troops and the}} predominantly Azerbaijani soldiers in the AzSSR OMON and army forcibly uprooted Armenians living in the 24 villages strewn across Shahumyan {{to leave their homes}} and settle elsewhere in Nagorno-Karabakh or in the neighboring Armenian SSR. British journalist Thomas de Waal has described Ring as the Soviet Union's first and only civil war. Some authors have also described the actions of the joint Soviet and Azerbaijani force as <b>ethnic</b> <b>cleansing.</b> The military operation was accompanied by systematic and gross human rights abuses.|$|E
5|$|In April 1941, Yugoslavia was {{occupied}} by Germany and Italy. Following the invasion the territory of Slavonia was incorporated into the Independent State of Croatia, a Nazi-backed puppet state and assigned as a zone under German occupation {{for the duration of}} the World War II. The regime introduced anti-semitic laws and conducted a campaign of <b>ethnic</b> <b>cleansing</b> and genocide against Serb and Roma populations, exemplified by the Jasenovac and Stara Gradiška concentration camps. Armed resistance soon developed in the region, and by 1942, it controlled substantial territories, especially in mountainous parts of Slavonia. Yugoslav Partisans led by Josip Broz Tito took full control of Slavonia in April 1945.|$|E
5|$|In April 1941, Yugoslavia was {{occupied}} by Germany and Italy. Following the invasion the territory, parts of Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and the region of Syrmia were incorporated into the Independent State of Croatia (NDH), a Nazi-backed puppet state. Parts of Dalmatia were annexed by Italy and the northern Croatian regions of Baranja and Međimurje were annexed by Hungary. The NDH regime was led by Ante Pavelić and ultranationalist Ustaše. The regime introduced anti-semitic laws and conducted a campaign of <b>ethnic</b> <b>cleansing</b> and genocide against Serb and Roma inhabitants of the NDH, exemplified by the Jasenovac and Stara Gradiška concentration camps.|$|E
5|$|In August 1990, an insurrection {{took place}} in Croatia {{centering}} in the predominantly Serb-populated areas of the Dalmatian hinterland near Knin, the Lika, Kordun, and Banovina regions, and eastern Croatia. The areas were subsequently named SAO Krajina (Serb Autonomous Oblast) and, after local leaders announced their intention to integrate SAO Krajina with Serbia, the Government of Croatia declared the SAO Krajina secession movement a rebellion. By March 1991, the conflict had escalated into the Croatian War of Independence. In June 1991, Croatia declared its independence as Yugoslavia disintegrated. A three-month moratorium followed, after which the declaration came into effect on 8 October 1991. The SAO Krajina, renamed Republic of Serbian Krajina (RSK) on 19 December 1991, responded with a campaign of <b>ethnic</b> <b>cleansing</b> against Croatian civilians.|$|E
5|$|In July 1995, {{forces of}} the Army of the Republika Srpska (VRS) {{captured}} the town of Srebrenica in eastern Bosnia, which had been cut off and surrounded {{despite the presence of}} soldiers from the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR). Thousands of refugees had crowded into the town to escape the Serb advance. Following the Serb takeover of Srebrenica, an estimated 8,000 Bosniak men and boys were systematically massacred by Serb forces between 11–15 July and another 25,000–30,000 were subjected to <b>ethnic</b> <b>cleansing.</b> It was the largest act of mass murder in Europe since World War II.|$|E
5|$|The {{killings in}} the Slunj pocket, {{including}} those in Saborsko, were prosecuted by the ICTY. The ICTY charged Babić and Milan Martić, respectively the defence and interior ministers of the SAO Krajina, with persecution, extermination and murder of non-Serb civilians in the area as well as deportations and forcible transfer of the civilian population, intentional plunder and destruction of property. Babić was tried at the ICTY in 2003–05, {{convicted and sentenced to}} 13 years in prison. Martić was tried in 2002–08, convicted and sentenced to 35 years in prison. His involvement in the killings, among other charges brought forward by the ICTY, was interpreted by the tribunal as part of a campaign of <b>ethnic</b> <b>cleansing</b> of non-Serbs from SAO Krajina controlled areas.|$|E
5|$|The offensives were {{accompanied}} by the displacement {{of most of the}} Croatian Serb population of the area captured by the HV. The refugees initially fled to Bosnia and Herzegovina, but the majority were soon settled in the JNA-held Baranja region of eastern Croatia. The offensive provoked accusations that Croatian troops had committed <b>ethnic</b> <b>cleansing</b> and civil-rights abuses. These accusations were contested by the European Community Monitor Mission (ECMM). A month after the operation, the retreating paramilitary unit known as the White Eagles perpetrated the Voćin massacre, and its war crimes were prosecuted at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia.|$|E
5|$|<b>Ethnic</b> <b>cleansing</b> in Bosnia and Herzegovina {{happened}} {{on a larger}} scale than in the RSK, and all the major ethnic groups became victims of ethnically motivated violence. The conflict produced a vast number of displaced persons. It is estimated that there were over a million refugees in areas of Bosnia and Herzegovina outside VRS control at the end of 1994, while the area's total population was about 2.2 million. About 720,000 Bosniaks, 460,000 Serbs and 150,000 Croats fled the country. Croatia hosted {{a large proportion of the}} Bosniak and Croat refugees; by November 1992 there were around 333,000 registered, and an estimated 100,000 unregistered, refugees from Bosnia and Herzegovina in Croatia. The refugees left their homes under varied circumstances. The ethnic violence committed by Bosnian Serbs against civilians resulted in the greatest number of civilian victims in the Bosnian war, culminating in the 1995 Srebrenica massacre.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, Palestinian historiography and {{collective}} memory {{point out that}} during the exodus of Palestinian Arab population of the 1948 War the massacres and forced expulsions that happened {{could be seen as}} <b>ethnic</b> <b>cleansing.</b> In the Latrun zone, this affected about 20 villages and ten thousand Palestinian Arabs. Some inhabitants fled during the fights of April but most fled when the Israelis attacked their village during the following operations. After capturing a village, the Israeli soldiers systematically expelled the non-combatants, intimidating them to leave and demolishing houses. A massacre of between thirty and seventy Arabs took place some days after Abu Shusha was taken. Most villages were levelled, {{so as not to be}} used by the Arab volunteers and to prevent the inhabitants returning. In some cases Jewish settlements were established on village land.|$|E
5|$|Russian forces {{temporarily}} {{occupied the}} Georgian cities of Zugdidi, Senaki, Poti, and Gori, {{holding on to}} these areas beyond the ceasefire. The South Ossetians destroyed most ethnic Georgian villages in South Ossetia and were responsible for an <b>ethnic</b> <b>cleansing</b> of Georgians. Russia recognised the independence of Abkhazia and South Ossetia from Georgia on 26 August; in response, the Georgian government severed diplomatic relations with Russia. Russia mostly completed its withdrawal of troops from undisputed parts of Georgia on 8 October. In the aftermath, Russia's international relations were largely unharmed. The war displaced 192,000 people and while many returned to their homes after the war, 20,272 people, mostly ethnic Georgians, remained displaced as of 2014. Russia has, since the war, occupied Abkhazia and South Ossetia {{in violation of the}} ceasefire agreement of August 2008.|$|E
5|$|The ICTY charged Milošević {{with the}} {{extermination}} of non-Serb civilians in Erdut, the forcible transfer {{of at least}} 2,500 inhabitants of the village and destruction of their property. Milošević's trial commenced on 12 February 2002, but he died in March 2006 before a verdict could be reached. The SDG, which became the most powerful paramilitary formation in eastern Slavonia, and Ražnatović gained notoriety for war crimes and <b>ethnic</b> <b>cleansing.</b> The SDG systematically plundered villages in the region, turning the area into a source of oak lumber, crude oil and wine for Ražnatović to sell in Serbia, and in Erdut itself. Ražnatović was never charged for any war crimes committed by the SDG in Erdut. The ICTY only charged him with several war crimes committed in or near Sanski Most. He was assassinated in Belgrade on 15 January 2000 before he could stand trial.|$|E
5|$|The century {{following}} 1750 {{was time}} of significant change. New forms of transport, industry and agriculture brought sweeping changes, {{and an end}} to traditional ways of life that had endured for centuries. The aftermath of the Battle of Culloden {{marked the beginning of the}} end for the clan system and whilst there were marked improvements in living standards for some, these transformations came at a cost for others. In the early 19th century Alexander, 10th Duke of Hamilton (1767–1852) embarked on a programme of clearances that had a devastating effect on Arran's population. Whole villages were removed and the Gaelic culture of the island dealt a terminal blow. A memorial to this early form of <b>ethnic</b> <b>cleansing</b> has been constructed on the shore at Lamlash, paid for by a Canadian descendant of the emigrants.|$|E
5|$|The {{killings of}} the civilians taken from Hrvatska Dubica, Cerovljani and Baćin were {{included}} in the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) trial of Milan Martić, and the trial of Slobodan Milošević. Martić, who coordinated the combat activities of SAO Krajina forces and the JNA with Colonel Dušan Smiljanić, the security head of the JNA 10th (Zagreb) Corps in the area of Hrvatska Kostajnica, was convicted and sentenced to 35 years in prison for his role in an <b>ethnic</b> <b>cleansing</b> campaign against non-Serbs in Croatia. The judgment identified 83 civilians—the 43 taken from Hrvatska Dubica, 10 from Cerovljani and approximately 30 from Baćin who were killed at Krečani on or about 21 October 1991. Milošević died in custody in March 2006 before a verdict could be reached.|$|E
5|$|The {{ships of}} the Navy {{participated in a}} number of {{conflicts}} {{after the end of the}} Cold War. After diplomatic efforts failed, the Navy was instrumental in the opening phases of the 1991 Gulf War with Iraq; the ships of the navy launched hundreds of Tomahawk II cruise missiles and naval aircraft flew sorties from six carriers in the Persian Gulf and Red Sea. The battleships Missouri and Wisconsin fired their 16-inch guns for the first time since the Korean War on several targets in Kuwait in early February. In 1999, hundreds of Navy and Marine Corps aircraft flew thousands of sorties from bases in Italy and carriers in the Adriatic against targets in Serbia and Kosovo to try to stop the <b>ethnic</b> <b>cleansing</b> in Kosovo. After a 78-day campaign Serbia capitulated to NATO's demands.|$|E
5|$|In 1990, {{following}} the electoral {{defeat of the}} Communist regime in Croatia, ethnic tensions worsened. After the elections, the Yugoslav People's Army (Jugoslovenska narodna armija, or JNA) confiscated the weapons of Croatia's Territorial Defence Force (Teritorijalna obrana, or TO) to minimise any resistance. On 17 August 1990, the tensions escalated to an open revolt of the Croatian Serbs, centred on the predominantly Serb-populated areas of the Dalmatian hinterland around Knin, {{and parts of the}} Lika, Kordun, Banovina and eastern Croatia regions. The Republic of Serbian Krajina (RSK), later established in those areas, declared its intention to integrate with Serbia, and was viewed by the Government of Croatia as a breakaway region. The JNA prevented Croatian police from intervening. By March 1991, the conflict had escalated into the Croatian War of Independence. In June, Croatia declared independence as Yugoslavia disintegrated, but implementation of the decision was postponed until 8 October by a three-month moratorium. A campaign of <b>ethnic</b> <b>cleansing</b> then began in the RSK; most non-Serbs were expelled by early 1993.|$|E

The RSK then initiated a campaign of <b>ethnic</b> <b>cleansing</b> against Croatian civilians, and most non-Serbs were expelled by early 1993. By November 1993, fewer than 400 ethnic Croats remained in the UN-protected area known as Sector South, and a further 1,5002,000 remained in Sector North.|$|E
5|$|Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was {{composed}} of six constituent republics: Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia, and Slovenia. In 1991, Croatia, and Slovenia seceded from Yugoslavia. Bosnia-Herzegovina—a republic with a mixed population consisting of Bosniaks, Serbs, and Croats—followed suit in March 1992 in a highly controversial referendum, creating tension in the ethnic communities. Bosnian Serb militias, whose strategic goal was to secede from Bosnia and Herzegovina and unite with Serbia, encircled Sarajevo with a siege force of 18,000 stationed in the surrounding hills, from which they assaulted the city with weapons that included artillery, mortars, tanks, anti-aircraft guns, heavy machine-guns, rocket launchers, and aircraft bombs. From 2May 1992 {{until the end of}} the war in 1996, the city was blockaded. The Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, numbering roughly 40,000 inside the besieged city, was poorly equipped and unable to break the siege. Meanwhile, throughout the country, thousands of predominantly Bosniak civilians were driven from their homes in a process of <b>ethnic</b> <b>cleansing.</b> In Sarajevo, women and children attempting to buy food were frequently terrorized by Bosnian Serb sniper fire.|$|E
5|$|The 1990 {{revolt of}} the Croatian Serbs was {{centered}} on the predominantly Serb-populated areas of the Dalmatian hinterland around the city of Knin, parts of Lika, Kordun, Banovina regions and in eastern Croatian settlements with significant Serb populations. These areas were subsequently named the Republic of Serbian Krajina (RSK). The RSK declared its intention of political integration with Serbia and was viewed by the Government of Croatia as a rebellion. By March 1991, the conflict escalated to warthe Croatian War of Independence. In June 1991, Croatia declared its independence as Yugoslavia disintegrated, followed by a three-month moratorium on the decision, thus the decision came into effect on 8 October. A campaign of <b>ethnic</b> <b>cleansing</b> was then initiated by the RSK against Croatian civilians and most non-Serbs were expelled by early 1993. By November 1993, less than 400 and 1,5002,000 ethnic Croats remained in UN protected areas Sector South and Sector North respectively.|$|E
5|$|The Bosnian Serb armyrenamed the Army of Republika Srpska (VRS) {{after the}} Republika Srpska state proclaimed in the Bosnian Serb-held territorywas fully {{integrated}} with the JNA. As 1992 carried on, it controlled about 70% of Bosnia and Herzegovina. This was achieved through a large-scale campaign of territorial conquest and <b>ethnic</b> <b>cleansing</b> which was backed by military and financial support from the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The war, which originally pitted Bosnian Serbs against non-Serbs, evolved into a three-sided conflict by 1993 when the CroatBosniak alliance deteriorated and the Croat–Bosniak war broke out. The Bosnian Croats declared a Herzeg-Bosnia state {{with the intent of}} eventually joining Croatia. This was incompatible with Bosniaks' aspirations of establishing a unitary state confronted by demands to partition the country. The VRS was involved in the Croatian War of Independence in a limited capacity, through military and other aid to the RSK, occasional air raids launched from Banja Luka, and most significantly through artillery attacks against urban centres, while the extent of territory it controlled did not change significantly until 1994.|$|E
5|$|The HV and {{the special}} police {{suffered}} 174211 killed or missing, while the ARSK had 560 soldiers killed. Four UN peacekeepers were also killed. The HV captured 4,000 prisoners of war. The number of Serb civilian deaths is disputedCroatia claims that 214 were killed, while Serbian sources cite 1,192 civilians killed or missing. During and after the offensive, 150,000–200,000 Serbs—or nearly the entire Serb population of the area formerly held by the ARSK—fled {{and a variety of}} crimes were committed against the remaining civilians there. The International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) later tried three Croatian generals charged with war crimes and partaking in a joint criminal enterprise designed to force the Serb population out of Croatia, although all three were ultimately acquitted and the tribunal refuted charges of a criminal enterprise. In 2010, Serbia sued Croatia before the International Court of Justice (ICJ), claiming that the offensive constituted a genocide. In 2015, the court ruled that it was not genocidal, and it affirmed that the Serb population fled {{as a direct result of}} the offensive, although Croatia did not have the specific intent to displace the country's Serb minority, nor was it found that <b>ethnic</b> <b>cleansing</b> or civilian targeting took place. However, it was found that crimes against civilians had been committed by Croatian forces. , the Croatian judiciary has convicted 2,380 persons for various crimes committed during Operation Storm.|$|E
5|$|In May, the Croatian {{government}} {{responded by}} forming the Croatian National Guard (Zbor narodne garde – ZNG), but its development was hampered by a United Nations (UN) arms embargo introduced in September. On 8 October, Croatia declared independence from Yugoslavia, {{and a month}} later the ZNG was renamed the Croatian Army (Hrvatska vojska - HV). Late 1991 saw the fiercest fighting of the Croatian War of Independence, culminating in the Siege of Dubrovnik and the Battle of Vukovar. A campaign of <b>ethnic</b> <b>cleansing</b> then began in the RSK, and most non-Serbs were expelled. In January 1992, an agreement to implement the peace plan negotiated by UN special envoy Cyrus Vance was signed by Croatia, the JNA and the UN. As a result, the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) deployed to maintain the ceasefire, and the JNA was scheduled to retreat to Bosnia and Herzegovina, where further conflict was anticipated. Despite the peace arrangement requiring an immediate withdrawal of JNA personnel and equipment from Croatia, it remained on Croatian territory for seven to eight months. When its troops eventually withdrew, the JNA left its equipment to the Army of the Republic of Serb Krajina (ARSK). The January ceasefire also allowed the JNA to maintain its positions in East and West Slavonia {{that were on the}} brink of military collapse following a Croatian counteroffensive, which reclaimed 60% of the JNA-held territory in West Slavonia by the time the ceasefire went into effect. However, Serbia continued to support the RSK. The HV restored small areas around Dubrovnik to Croatian control and during Operation Maslenica it recaptured some areas of Lika and northern Dalmatia. Croatian population centres continued to be intermittently targeted by artillery, missiles and air raids throughout the war.|$|E
5|$|On 9 January 1992, a Bosnian Serb {{state was}} declared, {{ahead of the}} 29 February1 March {{referendum}} on the independence of Bosnia and Herzegovinalater cited as a pretext for the Bosnian War). The Bosnian Serb state was later renamed Republika Srpska. As the JNA withdrew from Croatia it started to transform into a Bosnian Serb army, handing over its weapons, equipment and 55,000 troops. The process was completed in May, when the Bosnian Serb army became the Army of Republika Srpska (Vojska Republike Srpske – VRS). It was faced by the Croatian Defence Council (HVO), established in April, and the Bosnia and Herzegovina TOrenamed the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina (Armija Republike Bosne i Hercegovine – ARBiH) in May. Formal establishment of these forces was preceded by the first armed clashes in the country as the Bosnian Serbs set up barricades in Sarajevo and elsewhere on 1March and the situation rapidly escalated. Bosnian Serb artillery began shelling Bosanski Brod {{by the end of}} March, and Sarajevo was first shelled on 4April. By the end of 1992, the VRS held 70% of Bosnia and Herzegovina, following a large-scale campaign of conquest and <b>ethnic</b> <b>cleansing</b> backed by military and financial support from the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The Bosnian War gradually evolved into a three-sided conflict. The initial ARBiH–HVO alliance soon deteriorated as the forces became rivals for control of parts of the country. Ethnic tensions escalated from apparently insignificant harassment in July, to an open Croat–Bosniak War by October 1992. The Bosnian Croat authorities, organized in the Herzeg-Bosnia territory, were intent on attaching the region to Croatia. This was incompatible with Bosniak aspirations for a unitary state.|$|E

25|$|There is no {{international}} treaty that specifies a specific crime of <b>ethnic</b> <b>cleansing.</b> However, <b>ethnic</b> <b>cleansing</b> {{in the broad}} sense—the forcible deportation of a population—is defined as {{a crime against humanity}} under the statutes of both International Criminal Court (ICC) and the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY). The gross human-rights violations integral to stricter definitions of <b>ethnic</b> <b>cleansing</b> are treated as separate crimes falling under public international law of crimes against humanity and in certain circumstances genocide.|$|E
25|$|In {{the same}} year (1993), <b>ethnic</b> <b>cleansing</b> was also {{occurring}} in another country. During the Georgian-Abkhaz conflict, the armed Abkhaz separatist insurgency implemented a campaign of <b>ethnic</b> <b>cleansing</b> against the large population of ethnic Georgians. This was actually a case of trying to drive out a majority, rather than a minority, since Georgians were the single largest ethnic group in pre-war Abkhazia, with a 45.7% plurality as of 1989. As {{a result of this}} deliberate campaign by the Abkhaz separatists, more than 250,000 ethnic Georgians were forced to flee, and approximately 30,000 people were killed during separate incidents involving massacres and expulsions (see <b>Ethnic</b> <b>cleansing</b> of Georgians in Abkhazia). This was recognized as <b>ethnic</b> <b>cleansing</b> by Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe conventions, and was also mentioned in UN General Assembly Resolution GA/10708.|$|E
