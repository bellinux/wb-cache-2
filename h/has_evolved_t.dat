40|$|ABSTRACT: Bacterial and fungal {{pathogens}} cause {{a variety}} of infectious diseases and constitute a significant threat to public health. The human innate immune system represents {{the first line of}} defense against pathogenic microbes and employs a range of chemical artillery to combat these invaders. One important mechanism of innate immunity is the sequestration of metal ions that are essential nutrients. Manganese is one nutrient that is required for many pathogens to establish an infective lifestyle. This review summarizes recent advances in the role of manganese in the host−pathogen interaction and highlights Mn(II) sequestration by neutrophil calprotectin as well as how bacterial acquisition and utilization of manganese enables pathogenesis. Metals ions are essential for the proliferation of allkingdoms of life and perform {{a variety of}} structural and chemical tasks. In order to establish a virulent lifestyle, pathogens must acquire and concentrate metal ions from the host. 1 − 3 The mammalian innate immune system <b>has</b> <b>evolved</b> <b>t...</b>|$|E
40|$|Human {{adenovirus}} serotypes Ad 3, Ad 7, Ad 11, and Ad 14 use the epithelial junction protein desmoglein 2 (DSG 2) as a receptor for infection. During Ad infection, {{the fiber}} and penton base capsid proteins are produced in vast excess and form hetero-oligomers, called pentons. It {{has been shown}} for Ad 3 that pentons self-assemble into penton-dodecahedra (PtDd). Our previous studies with recombinant purified Ad 3 PtDd (produced in insect cells) showed that PtDd bind to DSG 2 and trigger intracellular signaling resulting in the transient opening of junctions between epithelial cells. So far, a definitive proof for a function of Ad 3 PtDd in the viral life cycle is elusive. Based on the recently published 3 D structure of recombinant Ad 3 PtDd, we generated a penton base mutant Ad 3 vector (mu-Ad 3 GFP). mu-Ad 3 GFP is identical to its wild-type counterpart (wt-Ad 3 GFP) in the efficiency of progeny virus production; however, it is disabled {{in the production of}} PtDd. For infection studies we used polarized epithelial cancer cells or cell spheroids. We showed that in wt-Ad 3 GFP infected cultures, PtDd were released from cells before viral cytolysis and triggered the restructuring of epithelial junctions. This in turn facilitated lateral viral spread of de novo produced virions. These events were nearly absent in mu-Ad 3 GFP infected cultures. Our in vitro findings were consolidated in mice carrying xenograft tumors derived from human epithelial cancer cells. Furthermore, we provide first evidence that PtDd are also formed by another DSG 2 -interacting Ad serotype, the newly emerged, highly pathogenic Ad 14 strain (Ad 14 p 1).

This approach has particular potential in psychology, where students could use SMS messaging {{as a way of}} responding in simple psychology experiments or demonstrations. We describe a simple architecture for an SMS-based responding, using an SMS-to-HTTP message relay service, and a php/mySQL input-output handler. We describe briefly two experiments we have run using the system. The first experiment examined anchoring effects in an SMS-based auction. The second experiment examined delay discounting, with participants indicating their intertemporal preferences using SMS.

A 2. 4 -kbp chromosomal fragment from P. ruminicola encoding an 87 -kDa aryl-glucosidase (CdxA) with cellodextrinase {{activity was}} cloned into Escherichia coli DH 5 a and sequenced. CdxA activity was found predominantly in the membrane fraction of both P. ruminicola and E. coli, but P. ruminicola localized the protein extracellularly while E. coli did not. The hydrolase {{had the highest}} activity on cellodextrins (3. 43 to 4. 13 mmol of glucose released min 21 mg of protein 21) and p-nitrophenyl-b-D-glucoside (3. 54 mmol min 21 mg of protein 21). Significant activity (70 % of p-nitrophenyl-b-D-glucoside activity) was also detected on arbutin and prunasin. Less activity was obtained with cellobiose, amygdalin, or gentiobiose. CdxA attacks cellodextrins from the nonreducing end, releasing glucose units, {{and appears to be}} an exo- 1, 4 -b-glucosidase (EC 3. 2. 1. 74) which also is able to attack b- 1, 6 linkages. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence with other glycosyl-hydrolases suggests that this enzyme belongs to family 3 (B. Henrissat, Biochem. J. 280 : 309 – 316, 1991). On the basis of this sequence alignment, the catalytic residues are believed to be Asp- 275 and Glu- 265.

Jirí Mlíkovský who proposed this solution does not use paleosubspecies in his taxonomic treatments and synonymized T. robusta with T. gigantea.

40|$|Many {{bacterial}} pathogens utilize a type III secretion {{system to}} deliver multiple effector proteins into host cells. Here {{we found that}} the type III effectors, NleE from enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) and OspZ from Shigella, blocked translocation of the p 65 subunit of the transcription factor, NF-kappaB, to the host cell nucleus. NF-kappaB inhibition by NleE was associated with decreased IL- 8 expression in EPEC-infected intestinal epithelial cells. Ectopically expressed NleE also blocked nuclear translocation of p 65 and c-Rel, but not p 50 or STAT 1 / 2. NleE homologues from other attaching and effacing pathogens as well OspZ from Shigella flexneri 6 and Shigella boydii, also inhibited NF-kappaB activation and p 65 nuclear import; however, a truncated form of OspZ from S. flexneri 2 a that carries a 36 amino acid deletion at the C-terminus had no inhibitory activity. We determined that the C-termini of NleE and full length OspZ were functionally interchangeable and identified a six amino acid motif, IDSY(M/I) K, that was important for both NleE- and OspZ-mediated inhibition of NF-kappaB activity. We also established that NleB, encoded directly upstream from NleE, suppressed NF-kappaB activation. Whereas NleE inhibited both TNFalpha and IL- 1 beta stimulated p 65 nuclear translocation and IkappaB degradation, NleB inhibited the TNFalpha pathway only. Neither NleE nor NleB inhibited AP- 1 activation, suggesting that the modulatory activity of the effectors was specific for NF-kappaB signaling. Overall our data show that EPEC and Shigella <b>have</b> <b>evolved</b> similar <b>T</b> 3 SS-dependent means to manipulate host inflammatory pathways by interfering with the activation of selected host transcriptional regulators...|$|R
40|$|Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) causes {{an acute}} {{vesicular}} disease of farm animals. The development of successful control strategies {{is limited by}} an incomplete understanding of the immune response to FMDV. Dendritic cells (DC) mediate the induction of immunity to pathogens, but their role in FMDV infection of cattle is uncharacterized. Bovine monocyte-derived DC (moDC) were exposed to integrin-binding and cell culture-adapted strains of FMDV in vitro. MoDC were not largely susceptible to infection by integrin-binding FMDV but were susceptible to culture-adapted virus. Binding specific antibodies to integrin-binding FMDV at neutralizing or subneutralizing IgG concentrations significantly enhanced infection via CD 32 (FcγR). Monocytes also expressed CD 32 but were nonsusceptible to FMDV immune complex (IC) infection, indicating a requirement for additional factors involved in cellular susceptibility. Infection of moDC by the FMDV IC was productive and associated {{with high levels of}} cell death. Infected moDC were unable to efficiently stimulate FMDV-specific CD 4 + memory T cells, but exposing moDC to IC containing inactivated FMDV resulted in significantly increased T cell stimulation. Thus, neutralized FMDV concurrently loses its ability to infect susceptible cells while gaining the capacity to infect immune cells. This represents a change in the tropism of FMDV that could occur after the onset of the antibody response. We propose that IC could dynamically influence the anti-FMDV immune response and that this may explain why the early immune response to FMDV <b>has</b> <b>evolved</b> toward <b>T</b> cell independence in vivo. Moreover, we propose that DC targeting could prove useful in the development of effective vaccines against FMDV...|$|R
40|$|Trypanosoma evansi is the {{parasite}} causing surra, {{a form of}} trypanosomiasis in camels and other livestock, and a serious economic burden in Kenya and {{many other parts of}} the world. Trypanosoma evansi transmission can be sustained mechanically by tabanid and Stomoxys biting flies, whereas the closely related African trypanosomes T. brucei brucei and T. b. rhodesiense require cyclical development in tsetse flies (genus Glossina) for transmission. In this study, we investigated the evolutionary origins of T. evansi. We used 15 polymorphic microsatellites to quantify levels and patterns of genetic diversity among 41 T. evansi isolates and 66 isolates of T. b. brucei (n = 51) and T. b. rhodesiense (n = 15), including many from Kenya, a region where <b>T.</b> evansi may <b>have</b> <b>evolved</b> from <b>T.</b> brucei. We found that T. evansi strains belong to at least two distinct T. brucei genetic units and contain genetic diversity that is similar to that in T. brucei strains. Results indicated that the 41 T. evansi isolates originated from multiple T. brucei strains from different genetic backgrounds, implying independent origins of T. evansi from T. brucei strains. This surprising finding further suggested that the acquisition of the ability of T. evansi to be transmitted mechanically, and thus the ability to escape the obligate link with the African tsetse fly vector, has occurred repeatedly. These findings, if confirmed, have epidemiological implications, as T. brucei strains from different genetic backgrounds can become either causative agents of a dangerous, cosmopolitan livestock disease or of a lethal human disease, like for T. b. rhodesiense...|$|R
40|$|High-altitude environments (. 2, 500 m) provide {{scientists}} {{with a natural}} laboratory to study the physiological and genetic effects of low ambient oxygen tension on human populations. One approach to understanding how life at high altitude has affected human metabolism is to survey genome-wide datasets for signatures of natural selec-tion. In this work, we report on a study to identify selection-nominated candidate genes involved in adaptation to hypoxia in one highland group, Andeans from the South American Altiplano. We analysed dense microarray geno-type data using four test statistics that detect departures from neutrality. Using a candidate gene, single nucleo-tide polymorphism-based approach, we identified genes exhibiting preliminary evidence of recent genetic adaptation in this population. These included genes {{that are part of}} the hypoxia-inducible transcription factor (HIF) pathway, a biochemical pathway involved in oxygen homeostasis, as well as three other genomic regions previously not known to be associated with high-altitude phenotypes. In addition to identifying selection-nominated candidate genes, we also tested whether the HIF pathway shows evidence of natural selection.

40|$|A {{granuloma}} {{is defined}} as an inflammatory mononuclear cell infiltrate that, while capable of limiting growth of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, also provides a survival niche from which the bacteria may disseminate. The tuberculosis lesion is highly dynamic and shaped by both, immune response elements and the pathogen. In the granuloma, M. tuberculosis switches to a non-replicating but energy-generating life style whose detailed molecular characterization can identify novel targets for chemotherapy. To secure transmission to a new host, M. tuberculosis <b>has</b> <b>evolved</b> to drive <b>T</b> cell immunity {{to the point that}} necrotizing granulomas leak into bronchial cavities to facilitate expectoration of bacilli. From an evolutionary perspective it is therefore questionable whether vaccination and immunity enhancing strategies that merely mimic the natural immune response directed against M. tuberculosis infection can overcome pulmonary tuberculosis in the adult population. Juxtaposition of molecular pathology and immunology with microbial physiology and the use of novel imaging approaches afford an integrative view of the granuloma’s contribution to the life cycle of M. tuberculosis. This review revisits the different input of innate and adaptive immunity in granuloma biogenesis, with a focus on the co-evolutionary forces that redirect immune responses also to the benefit of the pathogen, i. e. its survival, propagation and transmission...|$|R

In this study, the genome sequence of Treponema paraluiscuniculi, strain Cuniculi A, was determined {{by a combination of}} several high-throughput sequencing strategies. Whereas the overall size (1, 133, 390 bp), arrangement, and gene content of the Cuniculi A genome closely resembled those of the T. pallidum genome, the T. paraluiscuniculi genome contained a markedly higher number of pseudogenes and gene fragments (51). In addition to pseudogenes, 33 divergent genes were also found in the T. paraluiscuniculi genome. A set of 32 (out of 84) affected genes encoded proteins of known or predicted function in the Nichols genome. These proteins included virulence factors, gene regulators and components of DNA repair and recombination. The majority (52 or 61. 9 %) of the Cuniculi A pseudogenes and divergent genes were of unknown function.

40|$|CD 4 + T cells orchestrate the {{recruitment}} and subsequent activation of innate and adaptive immune {{cells in the}} tissue through the produc-tion of cytokines and critically contribute to the generation of a robust immune response to invading pathogens (Reinhardt et al., 2006). A prerequisite for CD 4 + T cell participation in host defense is their recruitment into periph-eral nonlymphoid tissue both in response to pathogens and at homeostasis so that antigen-experienced T cells are positioned where patho-gen reencounter {{is most likely to}} occur. The mechanisms that govern this strategic distribu-tion of T cells into tissues are not fully defined. Organs with large epithelial surfaces such as the gut and the skin are in constant contact with the environment and are exposed to po-tential pathogens on a regular basis and there-fore need an efficient immune response strategy to prevent infections at these sites. The unique structure and function of each organ determine its exposures and vulnerabilities to specific pathogens and make reexposure to a particular pathogen more likely in the same organ. For example, by virtue of its ecology, the gut is susceptible to infection with Salmonella and Shigella, organisms which are not pathogens in the skin. To streamline T cell memory immune responses based on the predictability of pathogen reexposure, the gut and the skin <b>have</b> <b>evolved</b> tissue-selective <b>T</b> cell imprinting, a process whereby DCs derived from the gut instruct T cells to home preferentially into the gut, whereas DCs derived from the skin instruct T cells to preferentially home into the skin. Gut DCs imprint the expression of 47 and CCR 9 on T cells, and in doing so enable their entry into the small intestine in response to intestinal MAdCAM- 1 and CCL 25, respectively (Stagg et al., 2002; Johansson-Lindbom et al., 2003; Mora et al., 2003). Similarly, skin-derived DCs imprint T cell expression of P- and E-selectin ligands and CCR 10, allowing T cell skin homing via cutaneous P- and E-selectins and CCL 27...|$|R
