We derive novel joint CFO/channel estimators for two cases: known and unknown channel statistics. The CFO estimator that makes use of known channel statistics is shown to attain the Cramer-Rao bound. If channel statistics are unknown to the estimator then a parameterization of the time-varying channel is required and this is shown to degrade performance. Theoretical analysis of the derived estimators is provided along with simulation results. I...|$|E

30|$|In this article, {{we develop}} a new subspace-based {{multiuser}} <b>joint</b> <b>carrier</b> frequency offset (CFO) and direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation scheme for orthogonal frequency division multiple access uplink transmissions. We leverage multi-antenna at the receiver and consider that the signals transmitted by each user arrive at the receiving antenna array from multiple DOAs after bouncing from both surrounding and far scatterers. The rank reduction approach is then exploited to estimate the multiple CFOs and DOAs. Specifically, for each user, after the CFO estimation from one-dimensional search, its multiple DOAs can be obtained simultaneously via polynomial rooting. The proposed method supports generalized subcarrier assignment scheme and fully loaded transmissions. Both performance analysis and numerical results are provided to corroborate the proposed studies.|$|E
