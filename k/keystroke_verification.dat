User access control (UAC) is the core component of security in cloud computing environment, aiming to ensure that stored data are allowed to be accessed only by authenticated/authorized users. As a typical behavioural biometrics, keystroke dynamics provides a promising UAC solution. The most challenging issue that hinders the wide deployment of keystroke is the high verification error rate. Gunetti et al. proposed a classical n-graph-based <b>keystroke</b> <b>verification</b> method (GP method), which can achieve a low False Acceptance Rate (FAR). However, the GP method suffers from a high False Rejection Rate (FRR) and a severe scalability issue...|$|E
40|$|Computerised {{biometric}} {{systems are}} automated methods of verifying or recognising {{the identity of}} a user on the basis of some physiological characteristic, like a fingerprint or some aspects of behaviour such as keystroke patterns. Behaviourally based biometric systems include signature, speaker and <b>keystroke</b> <b>verification.</b> The investigation of psychological factors which might impact on the efficiency of a behavioural biometric computer security monitoring system has to our knowledge not been conducted. Of particular concern in the present paper are the potential effects of state anxiety on individual’s physiological and performance responses. It is suggested that in a behaviourally based biometric computer security monitoring system, state anxiety may have sufficient effects to alter typical physiological and performance responses, resulting in an increased risk of security challenges, interruption of work-flow and resultant poor performance. It is also proposed that behaviourally based biometric systems may have the potential to be used as electronic performance monitoring systems, and typical responses to such systems need to be examined when developing and implementing any behaviourally based biometric security system...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This project’s {{aim is to}} {{describe}} two application, first one is <b>keystroke</b> integrity <b>verification</b> and secondly, malicious traffic detection or traffic monitoring. In this project we design and implement a cryptographic protocol that impose keystroke integrity by utilizing trusted computing platform and this approach helps to restrict outbound malware traffic. Trusted platform module is an international standard for secure crypto-processor. It offers facilities for the secure generation of cryptographic key but in this paper for generating the public key and private key we are using a novel approach. We apply basic cryptographic mechanism to ensure the correct data flow. We describe how to integrate cryptographic components with operating system {{and how to use}} hardware tools for the integrity of cryptographic keys in our verification operations...|$|R
40|$|Password is {{the most}} widely used {{identity}} verification method in computer security domain. However, due to its simplicity, it is vulnerable to imposter attacks. One way to add a shield to password is to employ keystroke dynamics, which is a biometric-based approach. Without manual preprocessing to remove noises and outliers resulted from typing inconsistencies, a poor detection accuracy results. Regarding this, we first introduce our previous research on automatic feature subset selection process, i. e. GA-SVM wrapper approach, which can automatically selects a relevant subset of features and ignores the rest, thus producing a better accuracy. Furthermore, a user authentication system often starts with an insufficient amount of data, which consequently guide the wrapper search to overfitting. In later stages of GA-SVM wrapper, diversified while semi-converged feature members are generated. Since the objective of feature selection exercise is to build a better ‘authenticator’, rather than to find out important features for data mining reasons, then the ensemble of these members can offer a good solution. In this article, we also propose an ensemble creation method, whose members are from GA-SVM feature selection procedure, to improve <b>keystroke</b> dynamics identity <b>verification</b> capability. Experimental results show that the proposed method is promising in dealing with such practical issues in <b>keystroke</b> dynamics identity <b>verification</b> problems. 1...|$|R

40|$|Worldwide {{adoption}} of mobile products and cloud computing services not only continues, but is accelerating. Biometric security technology shows promising {{in addressing the}} issue of authenticating genuine user that is a fundamental flaw in conventional cryptography. Conventional biometric applications, specifically verification and identification, have been extensively investigated over the past decades, leading to a significant improvement. However, several issues are still unsolved and the related research will continue. In this thesis, {{we are working on}} four research problems encountered in applying biometric security technology in mobile and cloud computing environment. Firstly, designing a secure user-side biometric authentication approach targeting computation-constrained mobile devices is a challenge and draws great attention. Most existing biometric methods, which normally require high-intensive computing power, are not specially designed for operating on mobile platforms. Only a handful of low-end mobile biometric solutions exist in the literature, the performances of which, however, are far from acceptable. In this thesis, a computational efficient CPR-based (Correlation Pattern Recognition) face authentication scheme (HCFA) was developed which suits various camera-equipped and java-enabled mobile devices. The proposed partial correlation output peak analysis (PCOPA) is operated on selected sub-regions of a facial image, in conjunction with the conventional direct cross-correlation method on downsampling images. The statistical experiments on public database show a good verification performance results. Moreover, the maximum memory consumption of such scheme is only around 500 KB. The running-time is acceptable even on lowest-end mobile platforms on the consumer market. The HCFA can be considered as an efficient, accurate, implementable, universal and maintainable mobile authentication solution. Secondly, designing a server-side non-/low intrusive biometric UAC (user access control) solution specifically towards ultra-large-scale network (e. g. cloud computing) is in urgent demand. Conventional biometric characteristics, e. g. face and fingerprint, are so sensitive to privacy that users are often conservative on their use in a distributed cloud scenario. On the other hand, non-/low intrusive biometric techniques, such as keystroke dynamics, are facing the severe scalability (efficiency in large network) problem and authentication accuracy issue. For instance, Gunetti et al. proposed a classical method, namely n-graph-based <b>keystroke</b> <b>verification</b> method (GP method) which achieved a low False Acceptance Rate (FAR). Nevertheless, high False Rejection Rate (FRR) and low efficiency remain the greatest shortcomings of it. The scalability issue is due to the verification of every sample in the database. In this thesis, we addressed the scalability issue as well as verification accuracy issue. We first proposed a CPR-oriented equivalent representation of keystroke n-graph pattern. Then, two innovative CPR-based approaches, nGdv-V and nGdv-C, were developed for fast and accurate verification. It is the first time to systematically apply CPR to keystroke pattern analysis. Compared to GP method, significant improvements of FRR as well as high authentication speed gain (1250 times for nGdv-V and 3 times for nGdv-C) have been achieved. Biometric template security and bio-cryptographic key generation become an emerging research topic. Existing fingerprint-based solutions, far too often, are based on an unrealistic assumption that images are pre-aligned accurately. Apart from alignment, low verification performance is another bottleneck. In this thesis, we demonstrated a rotation- and shift-free minutia local structure feature. The corresponding verification method Structure Similarity Estimate (SSE) and Dual Layer Structure Similarity Estimate (DLSSE) were proposed based on the features. By adopting SSE/DLSSE, an enhanced fingerprint fuzzy vault and an improved fuzzy extractor were developed for the purpose of securing minutia templates as well as generating bio-cryptographic key. High verification accuracy (EER < 1 %, outperforms existing major methods in the literature) and high security strength were exhibited. Finally, we worked on the idea of incorporating biometric into excising Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) architecture. Although PKI offers a feasible way for secure communication in untrustful networked environment, it is still weak in identifying genuine users [150]. Little research has been done to address such issues. In this thesis, a bio-PKI key management protocol was proposed, which possesses multiple roles such as user authentication, symmetric session key generation, client-server key agreement and etc. A legal user's fingerprint information is not only used for biometric-based identity verification but also for cryptographic key generation. The security analyses prove that the protocol is a high secure communication solution for insecure network such as distributed mobile-cloud network. Furthermore, the proposed scheme features low hardware requirement and computational efficiency...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Malicious {{software}} typically resides stealthily on a user’s {{computer and}} {{interacts with the}} user’s computing resources. Our goal in this work {{is to improve the}} trustworthiness of a host and its system data. Specifically, we provide a new mechanism that ensures the correct origin or provenance of critical system information and prevents adversaries from utilizing host resources. We define data-provenance integrity as the security property stating that the source where a piece of data is generated cannot be spoofed or tampered with. We describe a cryptographic provenance verification approach for ensuring system properties and system-data integrity at kernel-level. Its two concrete applications are demonstrated in the <b>keystroke</b> integrity <b>verification</b> and malicious traffic detection. Specifically, we first design and implement an efficient cryptographic protocol that enforces keystroke integrity by utilizing on-chip Trusted Computing Platform (TPM). The protocol prevents the forgery of fake key events by malware under reasonable assumptions. Then, we demonstrate our provenance verification approach by realizing a lightweight framework for restricting outbound malware traffic. This traffic-monitoring framework helps identify network activities of stealthy malware, and lends itself to a powerful personal firewall for examining all outbound traffic of a host that cannot be bypassed.

40|$|Biometrics can be {{classified}} into two broad categories— behavioral (signature <b>verification,</b> <b>keystroke</b> dynamics, etc.) and physiological (iris characteristics, fingerprint, etc.). Handwritten signature is amongst the first few biometrics to be used even {{before the advent of}} computers. Signature verification is widely studied and discussed using two approaches [5]. On-line approach uses an electronic tablet and a stylus connected to a computer to extract information about a signature and takes dynamic information like; pressure, velocity, etc whereas in offline approach stable dynamic variations are not used for verification purpose. Offline systems are more applicable and easy to use in comparison with on-line systems {{in many parts of the}} world however it is considered more difficult than on-line verification due to the lack of dynamic information.

40|$|Internet {{services}} are {{important part of}} daily activities for most of us. These services come with sophisticated authentication requirements {{which may not be}} handled by average Internet users. The management of secure passwords for example creates an extra overhead which is often neglected due to usability reasons. Furthermore, password-based approaches are applicable only for initial logins and do not protect against unlocked workstation attacks. In this paper, we provide a non-intrusive identity verification scheme based on behavior biometrics where keystroke dynamics based-on free-text is used continuously for verifying the identity of a user in real-time. We improved existing <b>keystroke</b> dynamics based <b>verification</b> schemes in four aspects. First, we improve the scalability where we use a constant number of users instead of whole user space to verify the identity of target user. Second, we provide an adaptive user model which enables our solution to take the change of user behavior into consideration in verification decision. Next, we identify a new distance measure which enables us to verify identity of a user with shorter text. Fourth, we decrease the number of false results. Our solution is evaluated on a data set which we have collected from users while they were interacting with their mail-boxes during their daily activities...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- The {{signature}} identification or verification, means where "identification " implies matching a user signature {{against a}} signature {{associated with the}} identity that the user claim.

Signature and Finger Print verifications are most widely used personal verifications and {{are one of the}} first few biometrics used even before computers. Signature verification is widely studied and discussed using two approaches. On-line approach and offline approach. Online signature verification represents the dynamic information related to signature which is captured at the time when signature made.

30|$|Based {{on these}} findings, we {{recommend}} the following considerations for those providing an alternative mobile device authentication mechanism: Use what we have: Mobile devices gather {{a significant amount}} of potentially private information about the user and their preferences, such as typing patterns, speech, accelerometer and gyroscope data and to whom and when they call or text. Future authentication methods can use this information as a way of determining who is using the device at a given time via behavioral biometrics such as <b>keystroke</b> dynamics, speaker <b>verification</b> and device use patterns. Since this information is already gathered, users tend to support its use as a potential authenticator. Respect the mobile device environment: Since mobile devices are characterized by a bursty use pattern in which users access them frequently for short periods of time [31, 32] authentication methods should not represent a barrier with each use or it may encourage users to not use security provisions. Mobile devices also have limitations in processor speed and memory, which is one reason for use of easy authentication methods. Alternatives to these easy methods should work in the background, but not overtax processors and memory. Keep data on-device: Participants reported that they were uncomfortable with personally-identifying information leaving their device. Since this data is already gathered, future authentication methods that use it should process it on the device itself. This has far-reaching privacy implications since the data remains under its owner’s control at all times. Remove most barriers, but not all: Our study has shown that participants choose not to use provided security methods on their mobile device because they quickly become frustrated with entering authentication details repeatedly. Such barriers to task completion are common in security. Since the mobile device environment is characterized by frequent use, owners are asked to authenticate frequently. Removing some of these barriers may help reduce user frustration with authentication, but removing all barriers may have the effect of changing the user’s mental model of the security provided. Participants opined {{that they would like to}} test, or experiment with, any new method before adopting it; this supports the creation of a mental model of security. Therefore, we should give clear signals as to the current state of security on the device, and give feedback in a non-intrusive manner as to the success or failure of authentication methods.|$|R
