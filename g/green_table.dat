25|$|A major advance {{occurred}} in 1969, when David Attenborough commissioned the snooker tournament Pot Black {{to demonstrate the}} potential of colour television, with the <b>green</b> <b>table</b> and multi-coloured balls being ideal for showing off the advantages of colour broadcasting. The TV series became a ratings success and was for a time the second most popular show on BBC Two. Interest in the game increased and the 1978 World Snooker Championship {{was the first to}} be fully televised. The game quickly became a mainstream game in the UK, Ireland and much of the Commonwealth and has enjoyed much success since the late 1970s, with most of the ranking tournaments being televised. In 1985 a total of 18.5 million viewers watched the concluding frame of the world championship final between Dennis Taylor and Steve Davis. The loss of tobacco sponsorship during the 2000s led to a {{decrease in the number of}} professional tournaments, although some new sponsors were sourced; and the popularity of the game in the Far East and China, with emerging talents such as Liang Wenbo and more established players such as Ding Junhui and Marco Fu, boosted the sport in that part of the world.|$|E
500|$|Many {{artifacts}} from Mesa Verde are now located in museums and private collections in the USA {{and across the}} world. A representative selection of pottery vessels and other objects, for example, {{is now in the}} British Museum in London. In 1906, President Theodore Roosevelt approved creation of the Mesa Verde National Park and the Federal Antiquities Act of 1906. The park was an effort to [...] "preserve the works of man" [...] and was the first park created to protect a location of cultural significance. The park was named with the Spanish term for <b>green</b> <b>table</b> because of its forests of juniper and piñon trees.|$|E

60|$|The next morning, {{on coming}} into the garden, I found that Mrs. Church and her {{daughter}} had departed. I was informed of this fact by old M. Pigeonneau, who sat there under a tree, having his coffee at a little <b>green</b> <b>table.</b>|$|E
60|$|The {{next morning}} I descended at some late hour by Swiss reckoning, and {{discovered}} two ladies {{in the morning}} sunlight awaiting breakfast at a little <b>green</b> <b>table.</b> One rose slowly {{at the sight of}} me, and stood and surveyed me with a glad amazement.|$|E
60|$|The next morning, {{on coming}} into the garden, I learned that Mrs. Church and her {{daughter}} had effectively quitted us. I was informed of this fact by old M. Pigeonneau, who sat there under a tree drinking his café-au-lait at a little <b>green</b> <b>table.</b>|$|E

60|$|Some {{time after}} Festing reached the settlement, Wilkinson and {{three or four}} others sat, smoking, in the poolroom. This {{supplied}} a useful hint about their character, because supper would not be ready {{for an hour or}} two, and industrious people were busily occupied. The room was hot, the floor and <b>green</b> <b>tables</b> were sprinkled with poisoned flies, and the wooden chairs were uncomfortably hard, but it was cooler than the sidewalk, and the men lounged with their feet on the empty stove.|$|R
60|$|There {{was a kind}} of {{pavilion}} or kiosk, {{which served}} as a cafe, and at which the delicacies procurable at such an establishment were dispensed. Miss Ruck pointed to the little <b>green</b> <b>tables</b> and chairs which were set out on the gravel; M. Pigeonneau, fluttering with a sense of dissipation, seconded the proposal, and we presently sat down and gave our order to a nimble attendant. I managed again to place myself next to Aurora Church; our companions were {{on the other side of}} the table.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, come on {{then all}} the LOT of you!" [...] cried Uncle Jim, and backing dexterously whirled the eel round in a {{destructive}} circle. The pink sunshade was torn from the hand that gripped it and whirled athwart the complete, but unadorned, tea things on the <b>green</b> <b>table.</b>|$|E
60|$|She {{took the}} Major's arm, while I {{hurried to the}} card-room. As luck would have it, the old lady was {{in the act of}} rising from the <b>green</b> <b>table,</b> having just cut out from a rubber. Mr. Robbie was her partner; and I saw (and blessed my star {{for the first time that}} night) the little heap of silver, which told that she had been winning.|$|E
60|$|The young {{scientific}} man, {{with his}} bandaged hand, {{sat at the}} <b>green</b> <b>table,</b> too tired to convey the wonder of the thing he had sought so long, his friend whistled and bawled for his dog, and the Sunday people drifted about them through the spring sunshine. For a moment or so Holsten stared at Lawson in astonishment, for he had been too intent upon {{what he had been}} saying to realise how little Lawson had attended.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Green</b> Party <b>tabled</b> a Sustainable Biofuels Bill {{which passed}} its first reading in Parliament in July 2009. The Bill [...] "is {{to ensure that}} {{biofuels}} that are supplied or sold in New Zealand from 1 May 2010 are sustainable biofuels".|$|R

'Zounds, man! if you can pick {{me out of the}} Solent, I suppose that I may pick you out of this accursed rat-trap in which I find you. Tie and tie, as we say at the <b>green</b> <b>table.</b> In truth, I was huffed with you when last we parted, but I have had you in my mind for all that.' ...|$|E
60|$|Sir Francis Clavering {{made his}} appearance, and skulked {{for a while}} about the {{magnificent}} rooms; but {{the company and the}} splendour which he met there were not to the Baronet's taste, and after tossing off a tumbler of wine or two at the buffet, he quitted Gaunt House for the neighbourhood of Jermyn Street, where his friends Loder, Punter, little Moss Abramns, and Captain Skewball were assembled at the familiar <b>green</b> <b>table.</b> In the rattle of the box, and of their agreeable conversation, Sir Francis's spirits rose to their accustomed point of feeble hilarity.|$|E
6000|$|... "February 6th, 1907, {{was a very}} foggy night, {{nevertheless}} Mr. Aaron Cohen, of 30, Park Square West, at {{two o'clock}} in the morning, having finally pocketed the heavy winnings which he had just swept off the <b>green</b> <b>table</b> of the Harewood Club, started to walk home alone. An hour later most of the inhabitants of Park Square West were aroused from their peaceful slumbers by the sounds of a violent altercation in the road. A man's angry voice was heard shouting violently for a minute or two, and was followed immediately by frantic screams of 'Police' and 'Murder.' Then there was the double sharp report of firearms, and nothing more.|$|E
6000|$|He took a slip {{of paper}} from a large pocket-book which lay at his elbow on the new <b>green</b> cloth-covered <b>table,</b> and handed it to his friend, who slowly opened and read it in a slovenly way, mumbling the most of it as he went on:-- ...|$|R

60|$|The Duke {{was never}} more curt, nor Sir Robert more specious; {{he was as}} fiery as Stanley, and as bitter as Graham. Nor did he do their opponents less justice. Lord Palmerston himself never treated a {{profound}} subject with a more pleasant volatility; and when Lucian rose at an early hour of morn, in a full house alike exhausted and excited, and after having endured for hours, in sarcastic silence, the menacing finger of Sir Robert, shaking over the <b>green</b> <b>table</b> and appealing to his misdeeds in the irrevocable records of Hansard, Lord John himself could not have afforded a more perfect representative of pluck.|$|E
60|$|The grass-grown globe was the <b>green</b> <b>table</b> {{on which}} Keogh gambled. The games he played were {{of his own}} invention. He was no grubber after the diffident dollar. Nor did he care to follow it with horn and hounds. Rather he loved to coax it with egregious and {{brilliant}} flies from its habitat {{in the waters of}} strange streams. Yet Keogh was a business man; and his schemes, in spite of their singularity, were as solidly set as the plans of a building contractor. In Arthur's time Sir William Keogh would have been a Knight of the Round Table. In these modern days he rides abroad, seeking the Graft instead of the Grail.|$|E
60|$|When {{the season}} was full and the weather {{perfectly}} warm the place was much frequented. There was a <b>green</b> <b>table</b> in it, and four or five deal chairs; a green garden seat also was there, which however had been removed into the innermost back corner of the excavation, as its hinder legs were somewhat at fault. A wall about two feet high ran along the face of it, guarding its occupants from the precipice. In fact it was no grotto, but a little chasm in the rock, such as we often see up above our heads in rocky valleys, and which by means of these steep steps {{had been turned into}} a source of exercise and amusement for the visitors at the hotel.|$|E

60|$|Indeed, just as Mr. Malthus was {{beginning}} his description, {{another pair of}} folding-doors was thrown open, and the whole club began to pass, not without some hurry, into the adjoining room. It was similar in every respect to the one from which it was entered, but somewhat differently furnished. The centre was occupied by a long <b>green</b> <b>table,</b> at which the President sat shuffling a pack of cards with great particularity. Even with the stick and the Colonel's arm, Mr. Malthus walked with so much difficulty that every one was seated before this pair and the Prince, who had waited for them, entered the apartment; and, in consequence, the three took seats close together {{at the lower end}} of the board.|$|E
6000|$|Next day at noon, in the Library of the Ibsen club. A spacious room, {{with glass}} doors right and left. At the back, in the middle, is the fireplace, surmounted by a {{handsome}} mantelpiece, with {{a bust of}} Ibsen, and decorated inscriptions of the titles of his plays. There are circular recesses at each side of fireplace, with divan seats running round them, and windows at the top, {{the space between the}} divan and the window sills being lined with books. A long settee is placed before the fire. Along the back of the settee, and touching it, is a <b>green</b> <b>table,</b> littered with journals. A revolving bookcase stands in the foreground, a little to the left, with an easy chair close to it. On the right, between the door and the recess, is a light library stepladder. Placards inscribed [...] "silence" [...] are conspicuously exhibited here and there.|$|E

My Lord is among the strangers. He is struck by the Countess's personal appearance, in which beauties and defects are fantastically mingled in the most attractive manner. He watches the Countess's game, and places his money where he sees her deposit her own little stake. She looks round at him, and says, [...] "Don't trust to my colour; I have been unlucky the whole evening. Place your stake on the other colour, and you may have a chance of winning." [...] My Lord (a true Englishman) blushes, bows, and obeys. The Countess proves to be a prophet. She loses again. My Lord wins twice the sum that he has risked.|$|E
