5|$|The {{military}} was organized along similar {{lines to the}} British and American {{armed forces of the}} time, in which a small standing army could quickly augment its strength during emergencies from a reserve militia force (in Brazil, the National Guard). Brazil's <b>first</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>defense</b> relied upon a large and powerful navy to protect against foreign attack. As a matter of policy, the {{military was}} to be completely obedient to civilian governmental control and to remain at arm's length from involvement in political decisions.|$|E
5|$|Anderson et al. argue that, {{aside from}} acute care, {{emergency}} medicine can {{also play a}} significant role in public health. Vaccinations for many diseases such as diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis can be administered by emergency departments, patients can be targeted for specific interventions such as counseling for substance abuse, and conditions like hypertension can be detected and treated. Emergency departments are excellent locations to train health care providers and to collect data, because of the high number of patients. Emergency medicine also improves public health by preventing secondary disease developing from an initial presentation (initial symptoms), and it serves as the <b>first</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>defense</b> in disaster scenarios.|$|E
5|$|Being the South's <b>first</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>defense</b> {{against foreign}} threats, the NSS houses {{technology}} unavailable to their sister intelligence agencies.

Given that her sense of fashion and general interests are more contemporary than that of her associates, she often stands out from the others, but her status as the top hacker in Korea has made her irreplaceable. Still, Tae-sung remains the more perdurable of the two and is often instrumental in the success of a number of operations.|$|E

5|$|Several {{barriers}} protect organisms from infection, including mechanical, chemical, {{and biological}} barriers. The waxy cuticle of most leaves, the exoskeleton of insects, the shells and membranes of externally deposited eggs, and skin {{are examples of}} mechanical barriers that are the <b>first</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>defense</b> against infection. However, as organisms cannot be completely sealed from their environments, other systems act to protect body openings such as the lungs, intestines, and the genitourinary tract. In the lungs, coughing and sneezing mechanically eject pathogens and other irritants from the respiratory tract. The flushing action of tears and urine also mechanically expels pathogens, while mucus secreted by the respiratory and gastrointestinal tract serves to trap and entangle microorganisms.|$|E
5|$|Initially {{reassigned to}} 10./JG 1 {{based in the}} Ruhr, he shot down his first Viermot (four-engined bomber), his 7th victory, on 26 February 1943. This was the {{beginning}} of a new war for Specht – the 8th USAAF was starting its bombing offensive on the Reich’s industrial complex. Soon afterward, on 27 March, he was appointed StaKa of the newly reformed 7./JG 1, then in May 1943 he was promoted to Kommandeur of II/JG 11. Jagdgeschwader 11 was a new fighter wing, created in April 1943 by dividing Jagdgeschwader 1 (flying Fw 190s) in half and filling it out into a full wing with new Gruppen flying Me 109G-6 'gunboats', to increase the homeland protection. He was based back near his original airfields on the North Sea coast, his unit the <b>first</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>defense</b> against the bomber streams and their fighter escorts.|$|E
5|$|Appointed Generalmajor (brigadier general) on 2 May 1796, Vukassovich soon {{fought in}} the Battle of Lodi on 10 May. At Lodi, he led a rear guard {{consisting}} of two battalions of the Carlstädter Grenz Infantry Regiment. After the Grenzers fell back to {{the east end of}} the bridge, they were employed in the <b>first</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>defense.</b> Subjected to continual cannon fire and a frontal attack by skirmishers and a column of elite troops, the Austrians were defeated. Such was his notoriety that the French falsely claimed to have killed him during the fighting. He commanded a 2,400-man brigade at the Battle of Borghetto on 30 May and during the Siege of Mantua. When the siege was lifted on 1 August, he led 2,000 men from the garrison to reinforce the main army before the Battle of Castiglione. During the second attempt to relieve the Siege of Mantua, he joined Paul Davidovich's Tyrol Corps. He was badly injured in a fall the night before the Battle of Rovereto, which occurred on 4 September. Nevertheless, he led his brigade during the day's fighting. His troops bravely tried to stop Masséna's advance, but they were finally routed by superior numbers.|$|E

5|$|The main access {{route to}} Ollantaytambo runs along a narrow valley {{formed in the}} {{mountains}} by the Urubamba River, which connects the site with Machu Picchu {{to the west and}} with Pisaq and Cusco to the east. After his uprising, Manco Inca fortified the eastern approaches to fend off attacks from the former Inca capital, now under Spanish occupation. The <b>first</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>defense</b> was a steep bank of terraces at Pachar, near the confluence of the Anta and Urubamba rivers. Behind it, the Incas channeled the Urubamba to make it cross the valley from right to left and back thus forming two more lines backed by the fortifications of Choqana on the left bank and 'Inkapintay on the right bank. Past them, at the plain of Mascabamba, eleven high terraces closed the valley between the mountains and a deep canyon formed by the Urubamba. The only way to continue was through the gate of T'iyupunku, a thick defensive wall with two narrow doorways. In the event of these fortifications being overrun, the Temple Hill, a religious center surrounded by high terraces overlooking Ollantaytambo, provided a last line of defense.|$|E
25|$|Initially, {{the main}} {{function}} of FPS was protection, {{as an integral}} part of building operations. For the most part, the force held fixed posts and performed duties that would be considered safety functions today, such as: eliminating fire and safety hazards, patrolling buildings, detecting fires, and providing the <b>first</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>defense</b> in fighting fires; and answering visitor questions, assisting citizens, rendering first aid, and directing traffic when necessary. By 1960, the mission of FPS became the <b>first</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>defense</b> against bomb threats, bombings, vandalism, mass demonstrations, and violence against Federal buildings.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Cytomegalovirus (CMV) and {{the human}} tumor cell share the same objectives: escape the {{recognition}} and destruction by {{the immune system and}} establish a state of immune tolerance conducive for their development. For early tumor development, the escape <b>of</b> the <b>first</b> <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>defense</b> <b>of</b> the immune surveillance is a critical step which determines survival or destruction. The presence of CMV on the tumor site and its involvement in carcinogenesis as initiator or promoter is increasingly documented. In this article, we highlight the similarity between mechanisms used by tumors and CMV to circumvent the immune defenses and evade from immune surveillance. We suggest that CMV and tumors help one another for their common objective. CMV gets shelter in immunologically poor environment of the tumor cells. In return CMV, by acting directly on the cancer cell and/or on the tumor microenvironment, provides the tumor cell the ways to promote its immune escape and development of immune tolerance...|$|R
40|$|Plants must co-exist {{with both}} {{pathogenic}} and beneficial microbes.
