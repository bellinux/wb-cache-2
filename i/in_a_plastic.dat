5|$|On 13 March 1995, {{a pair of}} legs, severed at the knees, {{was found}} <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>plastic</b> bag {{floating}} off Clifford Pier. Three days later, a pair of thighs and a torso {{were found in the}} same area, also <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>plastic</b> bag. Initially, Singapore police could only determine that the body parts belonged to a Caucasian, and they had a possible name after receiving a missing person report for Lowe from the South African High Commission. Vanessa Lowe filed the report because she was distressed that her husband, who used to make daily contact with his family when overseas, had not called home or returned to South Africa by 12 March. Lowe's colleagues at work also tried to determine his whereabouts through personal contacts in Singapore. On 1 April, she confirmed that the body parts were her husband's through visual identification. However, his arms and head were never found.|$|E
5|$|On 17 December 1986, the accused, {{a career}} {{criminal}} named Olaf Dietrich (born 1952), flew from Bangkok, Thailand, to Melbourne Airport. He had imported at least seventy grams of heroin, which he concealed within condoms {{that he had}} swallowed. He was arrested the next morning by the Australian Federal Police, who searched his flat and found one of the condoms in the kitchen, and some heroin <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>plastic</b> bag under a hirug in another room. He was taken into custody, and passed {{the remainder of the}} condoms during the night at the hospital in Pentridge Prison. Dietrich alleged that the drugs had been planted by the police.|$|E
5|$|In 1982, the {{original}} autograph manuscripts of the Nos. 3 to 6 {{of the set}} were discovered at a festival arranged in Melbourne, Australia, for the 250th anniversary of Haydn's birth. After a concert at the festival, a woman presented the manuscripts <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>plastic</b> shopping bag to the conductor Christopher Hogwood. The Haydn scholar Georg Feder, who was visiting Australia at the time, then verified the scores to be the authentic original manuscripts of the four quartets. It emerged that the woman who presented the manuscripts to Hogwood had inherited them, through successive generations, from an English colonel who had purchased them at an 1851 auction before emigrating to New Zealand. The colonel's heirs were evidently unaware that they owned the only original versions of the quartets in Haydn's pen. Until the 1982 discovery, publishers had been working from incomplete or non-original editions.|$|E
