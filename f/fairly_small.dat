5|$|The {{presence}} of foreign residents in Cortina d'Ampezzo {{is a fairly}} recent phenomenon, accounting for {{only a small number}} of inhabitants in what in any case is a <b>fairly</b> <b>small</b> town. There are 298 resident foreigners in the town, representing 4.9% of the total population. This compares with 7.0% in the town Belluno, 6.4% in the entire province of Belluno, and 10.2% in the Veneto region.|$|E

However, the pedestrianised Town Street which runs north from the Market Place to Waterloo Bridge has had significant investment in its heritage {{in the last five years}} and now enjoys almost full occupancy of its shops.|$|E
50|$|The {{core area}} of the white Dominican {{population}} is the Cibao or Northern region, particularly the Sierra where six out of ten people are white.

30|$|The total {{numbers of}} stream in one segment are {{identified}} as stream number. It is an utmost significant hydrological character of the basin area as it provides substantial information about surface runoff factors. The river of <b>fairly</b> <b>smaller</b> length is physiognomies of regions with steep gradients and better textures. Horton (1945) says that the numbers of stream sections of each order form an inverse geometric sequence with stream order number (Table  2).|$|R
40|$|Growth of single-walled carbon {{nanotubes}} (SWNTs) {{was carried}} out on SiO 2 /Si substrates with Pt catalysts at 400, 450, and 700 °C under various ethanol pressures using an alcohol gas source method in a high vacuum, and the grown SWNTs were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Raman spectroscopy. Irrespective of the growth temperature, both G band and RBM peaks were observed in the Raman spectra under the optimal ethanol pressure (~ 1 × 10 − 3 Pa), indicating that SWNTs grew below 450 °C from Pt. At 400 °C, both average diameter and diameter distribution were drastically reduced, and those were <b>fairly</b> <b>smaller</b> and narrower, compared to those for SWNTs grown with Co...|$|R
5|$|A {{specimen}} of Pinacosaurus preserves large paraglossalia (triangular bones or cartilages {{located in the}} tongue) which show signs of muscular stress, and it is {{thought this was a}} common feature of ankylosaurs. The researchers who examined the specimen suggested that ankylosaurs relied heavily on muscular tongues and hyobranchia (tongue bones) when feeding, since their teeth were <b>fairly</b> <b>small</b> and were replaced at a relatively slow rate. Some modern salamanders have similar tongue bones, and use prehensile tongues to pick up food. Based on the broadness of the ribcage, Ankylosaurus may have digested through a hindgut fermentation system like modern herbivorous lizards, which have several chambers in their enlarged colon.|$|E
5|$|Molluscs' circulatory {{systems are}} mainly open. Although {{molluscs}} are coelomates, their coeloms {{are reduced to}} <b>fairly</b> <b>small</b> spaces enclosing the heart and gonads. The main body cavity is a hemocoel through which blood and coelomic fluid circulate and which encloses {{most of the other}} internal organs. These hemocoelic spaces act as an efficient hydrostatic skeleton. The blood contains the respiratory pigment hemocyanin as an oxygen-carrier. The heart consists of one or more pairs of atria (auricles), which receive oxygenated blood from the gills and pump it to the ventricle, which pumps it into the aorta (main artery), which is fairly short and opens into the hemocoel.|$|E
5|$|Motul de San José {{was first}} settled between 600 and 300 BC, {{in the latter}} portion of the Middle Preclassic period, when it was {{probably}} a <b>fairly</b> <b>small</b> site. At this time some of its satellite sites were also settled, including La Trinidad de Nosotros and Buena Vista, both of which would have been small villages at this time, and they may have been settled even earlier in the Middle Preclassic, between 800 and 600 BC.|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} phase diagram of a {{one-dimensional}} extended Hubbard model with antiferromagnetic exchange interaction analytically and numerically. The bosonization and transfer-matrix renormalization group methods {{are used in}} the corresponding coupling regimes. At half-filling, the system is a Mott insulator with a finite spin excitation gap if the on-site Coulomb repulsion is <b>fairly</b> <b>smaller</b> than the antiferromagnetic exchange J. This Mott-insulator is characterized by the bond-charge-density-wave order or spontaneously dimerization. In the weak-coupling regime where the spin-charge separation holds approximately, the critical point separating the gapless and gapped spin liquid phases is U_c∼ J/ 2. However, as J increases, the spin-charge couplings become important and the critical point U_c is significantly suppressed and eventually tends to zero as J→∞. Away from half-filling, the charge gap completely collapses but the spin gap persists. Comment: 5 pages, 2 figures, to appear in PR...|$|R
5|$|The main {{land use}} in the {{watershed}} of Mud Creek is agricultural land, which accounts for 62.97 {{percent of the total}} area. 31.49 percent of the watershed is forested and 5.54 percent is developed land. Most of the forested land is on the watershed's southern and eastern edges, but there are some patches of it elsewhere, most of which are <b>fairly</b> <b>small.</b> Most of the developed land is near Jerseytown and Washingtonville, but there are several other small areas of development in the watershed's lower reaches and a few other areas in its upper reaches.|$|E
5|$|Bulky and soft-bodied, {{the false}} {{catshark}} has a broad {{head with a}} short, rounded snout. The nostrils have large flaps of skin on their anterior rims. The narrow eyes are over {{twice as long as}} high, and are equipped with rudimentary nictitating membranes; behind the eyes are large spiracles. The huge mouth is arched and bears short furrows at the corners. There are over two hundred rows of tiny teeth in each jaw, arranged in straight lines in the upper jaw and diagonal lines in the lower jaw; each tooth has a pointed central cusp flanked by one or two smaller cusplets on either side. The five pairs of gill slits are <b>fairly</b> <b>small.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{pectoral}} fin disc of the pink whipray is diamond-shaped and thick at the center, measuring about 1.1–1.2 times wider than long. The outer {{corners of the}} disc are angular. The snout forms a very obtuse angle, with the tip barely protruding. The small, widely spaced eyes are followed by larger spiracles. There is a short and broad curtain of skin with a finely fringed posterior margin between the long, thin nostrils. The mouth is <b>fairly</b> <b>small</b> and surrounded by prominent furrows; the lower jaw has a small indentation in the middle. There are two large central and two tiny lateral papillae {{on the floor of}} the mouth. The teeth are small and arranged into pavement-like surfaces. Five pairs of gill slits are located beneath the disc. The pelvic fins are small and narrow.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} locally symmetric manifolds with a fixed universal covering, {{and construct}} for each such manifold M a simplicial complex R whose size {{is proportional to}} the volume of M. When M is non-compact, R is homotopically equivalent to M, while when M is compact, R is homotopically equivalent to M N, where N is a finite union of submanifolds of <b>fairly</b> <b>smaller</b> dimension. This expresses how the volume controls the topological structure of M, and yields concrete bounds for various finiteness statements which previously had no quantitative proofs. For example, it gives an explicit upper bound for the possible number of locally symmetric manifolds of volume bounded by v> 0, and it yields an estimate for the size of a minimal presentation for the fundamental group of a manifold in terms of its volume. It also yields a number of new finiteness results...|$|R

5|$|The {{site was}} first settled between 600 and 300 BC, {{in the latter}} portion of the Middle Preclassic period, when it most likely was a <b>fairly</b> <b>small</b> site. This Maya city then had a long and {{continuous}} occupational history until the Early Postclassic, up to around AD 1250, with peaks in the Late Preclassic and Late Classic periods. Motul de San José had begun to refer to Tikal as its overlord in the late 4th century AD; by the 7th century it had switched its allegiance to Calakmul, Tikal's great rival, before returning its allegiance to Tikal in the early 8th century. In the late 8th century Motul de San José {{appears to have been}} conquered by Dos Pilas, capital of the Petexbatún kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Very {{little is}} known about {{pterosaur}} reproduction, and pterosaur eggs are very rare. The first known pterosaur egg was found in the quarries of Liaoning, the same place that yielded feathered dinosaurs. The egg was squashed flat with no signs of cracking, so evidently the eggs had leathery shells, as in modern lizards. This was supported by the description of an additional pterosaur egg belonging to the genus Darwinopterus, described in 2011, which also had a leathery shell and, also like modern reptiles but unlike birds, was <b>fairly</b> <b>small</b> compared {{to the size of the}} mother. In 2014 five unflattened eggs from the species Hamipterus tianshanensis were found in an Early Cretaceous deposit in northwest China. Examination of the shells by scanning electron microscopy showed the presence of a thin calcareous eggshell layer with a membrane underneath. A study of pterosaur eggshell structure and chemistry published in 2007 indicated that it is likely pterosaurs buried their eggs, like modern crocodiles and turtles. Egg-burying would have been beneficial to the early evolution of pterosaurs, as it allows for more weight-reducing adaptations, but this method of reproduction would also have put limits on the variety of environments pterosaurs could live in, and may have disadvantaged them when they began to face ecological competition from birds.|$|E
5|$|Voalavo {{is a small}} rodent {{resembling}} a mouse with gray fur. Species of the genus are among the smallest known nesomyines, close in size only to Monticolomys koopmani. In terms of external morphology, Voalavo is barely different from Eliurus; fur coloration patterns, general morphology of the feet, and number of mammae (six) {{are all the same}} in both genera. However, all species of Eliurus have a pronounced tuft of elongated hairs {{at the tip of the}} tail, a feature that is absent in Voalavo, although the latter does have slightly longer hairs near the tip. The tail is longer than the head and body. Relative tail length in northern voalavo (136% of head and body length) is comparable to that of the longest-tailed species of Eliurus, Grandidier's tufted-tailed rat and Petter's tufted-tailed rat, but V.antsahabensis has a somewhat shorter tail. Furthermore, the pads of the feet are larger in Eliurus, and specifically, the thenar pad (located at the middle of the tarsus) is circular and <b>fairly</b> <b>small</b> in Voalavo, but longer and larger in Eliurus. On the chest, Voalavo species have a gland that produces a sweet-swelling musk in breeding males; this gland is absent in Eliurus. Unlike all other nesomyines but Brachyuromys, Voalavo lacks an entepicondylar foramen, an opening on the humerus (upper forelimb bone).|$|E
50|$|Mac Beach, {{acquired}} Chippewa Lake in 1898 {{and improved}} the park immensely. He also placed {{a ban on}} liquor sales. Mac's son, Parker Beach, managed the park during its boom years, the roaring '20s. During that decade, the first modern coaster was built at the park, designed by Fred Pearce. Originally named the Big Dipper, it became better known as simply 'the coaster'. The park also featured a live band-stand seven nights a week. By 1925, the park opened the wooden roller coaster. The coaster was a <b>fairly</b> <b>smaller</b> roller coaster estimating to be about 50 Feet high. The coaster operated until the park closed in 1978. The coaster stood abandoned for over 30 years until it was demolished in 2010. The Beach family kept the park running successfully into the 1960s. Eventually Chippewa Lake would feature three roller coasters, flying cages, a Ferris wheel, carousel, Tumble Bug, ballroom and many other rides.|$|R
40|$|The antiferromagnetic {{ground state}} of the half-filled Hubbard model with the doubly {{degenerate}} orbital has been studied by using the slave-boson mean-field theory which was previously proposed by the present author. Numerical calculations for the simple cubic model {{have shown that the}} metal-insulator transition does not take place except at the vanishing interaction point, in strong contrast with its paramagnetic solution. The energy gap in the density of states of the antiferromagnetic insulator is much reduced by the effect of electron correlation. The exchange interaction $J$ {{plays an important role in}} the antiferromagnetism: although for $J = 0 $ the sublattice magnetic moment $m$ in our theory is <b>fairly</b> <b>smaller</b> than $m_{HFA}$ obtained in the Hartree-Fock approximation, $m$ for $J/U > 0. 2 $ ($U$: the Coulomb interaction) is increased to become comparable to $m_{HFA}$. Surprisingly, the antiferromagnetic state is easily destroyed if a small, negative exchange interaction ($J/U < - 0. 05 $) is introduced.
