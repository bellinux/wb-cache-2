30|$|Fertilizers {{are one of}} {{the major}} inputs into dairy farming, {{accounting}} for approximately 12.5  % of operating <b>farm</b> <b>expenditure</b> (DairyNZ 2013). Fertilizer production, in general, is considered a high, energy-intensive process as, for example, nitrogen-based fertilizers are made primarily from natural gas. This is confirmed by the studies of Baffes (2007) and Baffes (2011), in which high pass-through from energy indices, for example, crude oil to fertilizer indices, is found. In addition, processing milk to butter also requires significant energy input. This suggests that a direct relationship between butter and crude oil is to be expected. In addition, transportation costs for butter and dairy commodities are mainly influenced by oil costs, thus further strengthening the relationship between butter and crude oil. This argument was used to explain correlation effects between crude oil and agricultural commodities, and, in particular, butter, in the study of Huchet-Bourdon (2011).|$|R

Features of contract farming are as follows. The first is introduction of imported, large and high-performance machines. The second is the operation of "long-distance" type, covering a travel distance of over 100 km. The third is the different charge settings for the neighboring country and the local town. The fourth is the use of auxiliary labor force in the contract work.

40|$|In {{the past}} three decades {{following}} the implementation of land reforms, the agricultural sector in Kerala has undergone wide-ranging changes in terms of farm size, cropping pattern, cultivation practices and productivity. There has been a phenomenal {{growth in the number of}} agricultural holdings leading to the emergence of a large number of very smallholdings. Of course, agricultural productivity also increased significantly during this period. The major question examined in this paper is whether the increase in productivity of land is explained by the decrease in the size of holdings. The agricultural census figures suggest a possible relation between the two. In order to verify this relationship data were collected through a sample survey in a rural locality in Kerala. A size-wise analysis of productivity indicated that it is the large farms, which have higher productivity. However, more detailed analysis using regression methods shows that no firm relationship exists between farm size and productivity. To identify the causal factors of productivity further in-depth analysis of the data was made.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{presents}} the waste management processes, which are implemented on Polish territory, with particular emphasis on solutions applied in large agglomerations. According to many sources (both Waste Management Plan as well as the Statistical Yearbook) the amount of generated waste continues to increase, in the construction industry, as well as other branches, while the development of new waste- recycling technologies is not able to meet the current needs. This paper covers waste management solutions, which are used by smaller, specialized institutions collecting and processing waste, or by municipal Waste Processing Facilities. Criteria for comparing waste treatment methods are: the scale of their use, versatility, as well as profitability for manufacturers and processing enterprises (the recipients) dealing with waste coming from building demolitions or renovations. Known information about recycling does not always coincide with the actual actions taken to protect our environment, because awareness is not enough, appropriate action is needed. Waste treatment processes presented in this paper are just a small fraction of the technologies used in Europe or worldwide. Many of the methods of waste treatment will not be introduced in Poland because of high (capital <b>expenditures?)</b> <b>expenses</b> associated with their processing technology. In such case low level of costs generated by storing waste in disposal landfills remains unrivaled, posing potential threat to the environment...|$|R

In 2013, the AERU developed and tested a methodology for identifying and quantifying the socio-economic impacts of expenditure flows from the rural sector on adjacent urban areas. The impacts of <b>expenditure</b> flows from <b>farms,</b> farm households, rural-servicing businesses and food processing businesses located in the Selwyn and Waimakariri districts on the Christchurch economy have been estimated during three stages of the study. In the first stage the methodology was developed and the <b>expenditure</b> flows from <b>farms</b> and rural-servicing businesses were estimated. In the second stage, the inter-annual differences in <b>farm</b> <b>expenditure</b> flows, and the potential impacts of increasing irrigation development were examined, and lastly the contribution of the food processing sector in Selwyn and Waimakariri districts to economic activity in Christchurch was estimated. A three-step process was used to estimate the total <b>expenditure</b> flows from <b>farms,</b> farm households and rural-servicing businesses into Christchurch from the two adjoining districts. A postal survey of farms was carried out to obtain information about the proportions of farm and <b>farm</b> household <b>expenditure</b> spent locally, in Christchurch, and elsewhere by expenditure category.

In addition, households that experience income increases of more than 50 % have higher changes of consumption compared to households who face an income decrease of more than 50 % at the 1 % significance level. However, no significant change of consumption is found for households with income changes between - 50 % and + 50 %. These results are not robust when a smaller dataset is considered. This research is significant because few previous studies have tried determining relevant income change ranges, at which consumption changes significantly with income.
