The <b>excavation</b> <b>of</b> <b>trench</b> 2 defined the plan of the corner buttress of the three-aisled Gothic chapel. The second objective of this year 2 ̆ 7 s research was to define the architecture {{in the southern part of}} the plateau of this position surrounded by a fortification ditch, that is, to determine the room annexed along the middle of the southern aisle of the three-aisled Gothic church. The outlines of the architecture were defined, but there were insufficient financial means to excavate the interior of the structure, which would have provided a stratigraphically clear definition of its function. The mentioned room – presumably a lateral chapel, whose interior measured 3. 8 x 4. 15 m, was certainly operative at the same time as the three-aisled Gothic church, namely during the time the Ilok dukes ruled the neighbouring Ružica Castle. As to whether it served as the burial place for any nobles, we cannot tell without first carrying out the excavation in the interior. The architectural remains discovered in trench 1 also open certain questions regarding the appearance and function of the sacred structure in the shape of an elongated single-aisled hall-like Saalkirche that preceded the three-aisled Gothic building...|$|R

40|$|The {{magnitude}} {{and frequency of}} normal-fault palaeoearthquakes are usually deter-mined by trenching studies that ascertain the size and number of colluvial wedges along the fault. Such information can be invaluable in predicting the seismic hazard and potential for a future earthquake in that region. Digging trenches across normal faults, however, is environmentally intrusive, expensive and limited in the penetration depth. To overcome these problems we propose the use of 3 -D seismic tomography {{as a means to}} identify the shapes and sizes of colluvial wedges along normal faults. As an example, 2 -D and 3 -D seismic surveys were conducted across the Oquirrh fault, Utah with the purpose of imaging the normal-fault structure to a depth of about 10 m. Results show that the 3 -D tomogram clearly delineates the fault zone and a colluvial wedge, both of which correlate extremely well with the geological cross-section interpreted from an adjacent trench. The thickness of the colluvial wedge image is used in conjunction with a seismic section to compute an estimate of a 6. 8 moment magnitude earthquake for the most recent event on this fault, which is in close agreement with the 7. 0 estimate based on a nearby trenching study. These tomographic results demonstrate, for the ¢rst time, that seismic imaging methods can be used in some cases to estimate unambiguously the shapes of colluvial wedges and the sizes of prehistoric earthquakes. Thus, seismic tomography has the possibility of providing cheaper, deeper and wider, but less resolved, images of fault systems than the intrusive <b>excavation</b> <b>of</b> <b>trenches</b> across faults.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{dramatic}} ways humans can affect soil properties is through the performance of military activities. Warfare-induced disturbances to soil are basically of three types – physical, chemical, and biological – and are aimed at causing direct problems to enemies or, more often, are indirect, undesired ramifications. Physical disturbances to soil include sealing due to building of defensive infrastructures, <b>excavation</b> <b>of</b> <b>trenches</b> or tunnels, compaction by traffic of machinery and troops, or cratering by bombs. Chemical disturbances consist of the input of pollutants such as oil, heavy metals, nitroaromatic explosives, organophosphorus nerve agents, dioxins from herbicides, or radioactive elements. Biological disturbances occur as unintentional consequences of the impact on the physical and chemical properties of soil or the deliberate introduction of microorganisms lethal to higher animals and humans such as botulin or anthrax. Soil represents a secure niche where such pathogens can perpetuate their virulence for decades. Soil morphology, composition, and biology can be profoundly modified by warfare activities in either wartime or peacetime (e. g. at test-firing facilities), and complete recovery of some characteristics can require years or even centuries. A few soil functions can be definitively compromised, if appropriate reclaiming techniques are not carried out. Such techniques often are extremely expensive, {{as in the case of}} contamination by dioxins or radionuclides, and remediation can even impel the complete removal of the polluted soil and its substitution with soil material from elsewhere. Taking into account how much of the pedosphere is currently and was in the past involved in warfare, warfare is actually a major means by which humans play a recognized role as a soil forming factor, as well as the parent material, topography, time, climate, and organisms not endowed with the power of reason. The variegated impact of warfare on the soil environment is reviewed here...|$|E

40|$|The Daqingshan Piedmont Fault (DPF) {{is one of}} {{the major}} active normal faults in the Hetao {{depression}} zone in the northern part of Ordos Block, North China. It extends in NEE direction along the Daqingshan piedmont zone in the eastern part of the depression, dipping to the south, for a length of 223 km. The fault formed in the Eocene and underwent strong movement during the Cenozoic time. Its vertical displacement amplitude has exceeded 2400 m since the Quaternary. The fault can be divided into 5 active segments. Paleoseismological studies were concentrated on its western part from Baotou to Tumdzuoqi whereas the Hohhot Segment to the east was scarcely studied. To fill this gap of knowlegde, the authors carried out in-depth study on the Daqingshan piedmont fault during recent years. <b>Excavation</b> <b>of</b> <b>trenches</b> at Kuisu, Ulanblang, and Bakouzi sites on the Hohhot Segment of the Daqingshan piedmont fault and study of geomorphic surfaces allow us to identify and date paleoearthquakes and to evaluate the completeness of paleoseismic activity history. This was done both for the individual sites and for the entire segment since the Late Quaternary using the «method for displacement confining» along the fault and «method for correlation between multiple trenches». In this paper we present the geological loggings of two trenches at Kuisu site, provide the evidence for 6 events since 19 ka BP and the cumulative displacement amount produced by them is around 7 m. But the cumulative displacement amount obtained from difference in heights of geomorphic surfaces is 5. ??. 5. 5 m. Results of tests using the method of displacement confining show that the event sequence revealed at this site can be considered complete. The data supplemented with information obtained in the Ulanblang and Bakouzi trenches show that 7 paleoseismic events occurred on the Hohhot Fault Segment since 19 ka BP, i. e. they occurred at 18. 75 ± 0. 75 ka, 16. 97 ± ± 0. 96 ka, 14. 65 ± 0. 67 ka, 11. 82 ± 0. 69 ka, 9. 45 ± 0. 26 ka, 6. 83 ± 0. 26 ka, and 4. 50 ± 0. 23 ka BP, respectively, and the average recurrence interval is 2. 375 ± 0. 432 ka.
