AllMusic writer Stephen Erlewine stated: [...] "Dre realized that it wasn't time to push the limits of G-funk, and instead decided to deepen it musically, creating easy-rolling productions that have more layers than they appear". He added that the beats were [...] "laid-back funky, continuing to resonate after many listens". Rolling Stone writer Touré noted [...] "The Chronics slow, heavy beats were a sonic representation of angry depression as accurate as Cobain's feedback blasts; Doggystyle is leaner, with its high-tempo Isaac Hayes- and Curtis Mayfield-derived tracks". He {{went on to say}} that [...] "Most of Dre's hooks and nearly all his beats refuse to linger, as if the songs themselves are nervous, fearful of exposure, restless to get offscreen." [...] Entertainment Weekly magazine's David Browne mentioned that [...] "The mix of samples and live music on Dre's latest, The Chronic, gave it texture and depth, and he continues his knob-turning growth on Doggystyle, fluidly weaving together a <b>gaggle</b> <b>of</b> background singers and rappers, quirky samples, his trademark horror-flick keyboard lines".

40|$|A generic logic called ‘Gaggle logic’ is introduced. It {{is based}} on Gaggle theory and deals withconnectives of {{arbitrary}} arity {{that are related to}} each other by abstract laws of residuation. Welist the 96 binary connectives and the 16 unary connectives <b>of</b> <b>Gaggle</b> logic. We provide a soundand complete calculus for Gaggle logic which enjoys strong cut elimination and the displayproperty. We show that Gaggle logic is decidable and satisfies the properties of conservativityand interpolation. We also introduce specific inference rules called ‘protoanalytic’ inferencerules. These rules are such that, when added to the calculus <b>of</b> <b>Gaggle</b> logic, we obtain acalculus which still enjoys strong cut elimination and the display property. If the languageconsidered contains conjunction and disjunction, then the interpolation theorem also transfersto these extensions <b>of</b> <b>Gaggle</b> logic. In a second part of the report, we generalize the Kracht’scorrespondence results established for the basic tense logic to Gaggle logic. We prove that alogic extending Gaggle logic is axiomatizable by means of so-called ‘protoanalytic’ inferencerules if, and only if, the class of frames on which such a logic is based is definable by specificfirst-order frame conditions, also called ‘protoanalytic’. We provide algorithms that compute thecorresponding protoanalytic inference rules from the protoanalytic first-order frame conditions,and vice versa.

40|$|We {{show how}} the <b>Gaggle</b> Theory <b>of</b> Dunn gives a Gentzen-style proof theory for many algebraizable logics via the Display Logic of Belnap. At the heart of both systems lie the {{algebraic}} notions of residuation, Galois connections, and their duals. Introduction It {{is well known that}} most non-classical logics have an underlying algebraic semantics. Many non-classical logics also have a relational semantics using Kripke models. In a series of papers [Dun 91, Dun 93 b, Dun 93 a], Dunn has shown that there are deep connections between these algebraic and relational semantics where each n-ary connective in a logic has an n + 1 -ary relational semantics. The Display Logic [Bel 82] of Belnap is a powerful Gentzen formulation which has been used to obtain Gentzen systems for non-classical logics like modal logic [Wan 94], intuitionistic and intermediate logics [Gor 95], and substructural logics [Res 94]. As Belnap says "Evidently, algebra is in the air, especially residuation" [Bel 82, page 409]. We use the [...] ...|$|R

A Gaggle behaves very much like an object: it can be named {{in the same way as}} an object, and can be used as the invokee of an invocation.

40|$|Part I of {{this paper}} is {{developed}} in the tradition of Stone-type dualities, where we present a new topological representation for general lattices (influenced by and abstracting over both Goldblatt's [17] and Urquhart's [46]), identifying them as the lattices of stable compact-opens of their dual Stone spaces (stability refering to a closure operator on subsets). The representation is functorial and is extended to a full duality. In part II, we consider lattice-ordered algebras (lattices with additional operators), extending the J'onsson and Tarski representation results [30] for Boolean algebras with Operators. Our work can be seen as developing, and indeed completing, Dunn's project <b>of</b> <b>gaggle</b> theory [13, 14].

40|$|The Distributed Air/Ground Traffic Management (DAG-TM) {{concept of}} operations* permits {{appropriately}} equipped aircraft to conduct Free Maneuvering operations. These independent aircraft {{have the freedom}} to optimize their trajectories in real time according to user preferences; however, they also take on the responsibility to separate themselves from other aircraft while conforming to any local Traffic Flow Management (TFM) constraints imposed by the air traffic service provider (ATSP). Examples of local-TFM constraints include temporal constraints such as a required time of arrival (RTA), as well as spatial constraints such as regions of convective weather, special use airspace, and congested airspace. Under current operations, congested airspace typically refers to a sector(s) that cannot accept additional aircraft due to controller workload limitations; hence Dynamic Density (a metric that is indicative of controller workload) can be used to quantify airspace congestion. However, for Free Maneuvering operations under DAG-TM, an additional metric is needed to quantify the airspace congestion problem from the perspective of independent aircraft. Such a metric would enable the ATSP to prevent independent aircraft from entering any local areas of congestion in which the flight deck based systems and procedures {{may not be able to}} ensure separation. This new metric, called Gaggle Density, offers the ATSP a mode of control to regulate normal operations and to ensure safety and stability during rare-normal or off-normal situations (e. g., system failures). It may be difficult to certify Free Maneuvering systems for unrestricted operations, but it may be easier to certify systems and procedures for specified levels <b>of</b> <b>Gaggle</b> Density that could be monitored by the ATSP, and maintained through relatively minor flow-rate (RTA type) restrictions. Since flight deck based separation assurance is airspace independent, the challenge is to measure congestion independent of sector boundaries. Figure 1, reproduced from Ref. 1, depicts an example traffic situation. When the situation is analyzed by sector boundaries (left side of figure), a Dynamic Density metric would identify excessive congestion in the central sector. When the same traffic situation is analyzed independent of sector boundaries (right side <b>of</b> figure), a <b>Gaggle</b> Density metric would identify congestion in two dynamically defined areas covering portions of several sectors. The first step towards measuring airspace-independent congestion is to identify aircraft clusters, i. e., groups of closely spaced aircraft.
