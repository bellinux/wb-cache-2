[...] In the documentary series Lost Highway, Nelson recalls, [...] "When I first started recording Merle, I became so enamored with his singing that I would forget what <b>else</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on,</b> and I suddenly realized, 'Wait a minute, there's musicians here you've got to worry about!'

50|$|Using {{data from}} the SAEE (which {{includes}} measures for ideology, income, job security, and other measures), Caplan simulates what people would believe {{if they had the}} same circumstances as economists, a technique often used in political science called “enlightened preferences”. If the ideological and self-serving biases are true, most of the difference between the “enlightened public” and economists should disappear. If, however, the enlightened public is not much closer to economists, then something <b>else</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>on,</b> as those explanations have been neutralized. Caplan believes that that something else is the biases he enumerated earlier. The data tends to support Caplan’s argument, with most (but not all) of the enlightened public closer to economists than to the public.|$|E
5000|$|During the mid-1990s, U.S. children's {{cable channel}} Nickelodeon helped popularize the superstition in the United States {{as part of}} its [...] "Nick Days," [...] where during {{commercial}} breaks it would show an ad about the significance of the current date, whether it be an actual holiday, a largely uncelebrated unofficial holiday, or a made-up day if nothing <b>else</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> that specific day. (The latter would be identified as a [...] "Nickelodeon holiday.") Nickelodeon would promote the last day of each month as [...] "Rabbit Rabbit Day" [...] and to remind kids to say it the next day, unless the last day of that specific month was an actual holiday, such as Halloween or New Year's Eve.

500|$|Pickens {{prepared}} for this role by observing several of Kersh's real-life counterparts at the FBI's Los Angeles office, where, according to the actor, the most useful thing he learned was {{that most of the}} people at Kersh's level had been with the Bureau for twenty or twenty-five years and had not reached their positions in the FBI hierarchy by taking their work less than seriously or bucking the system without good reason. Robert Patrick, who portrayed John Doggett, recognized that his own character and Kersh were [...] "both military men – Air Force, Marines".

5000|$|Boomiverse {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 69, based on 12 reviews. Jayson Greene of Pitchfork commented: [...] "Boomiverse doesn’t {{have the same}} freewheeling, blitzkrieg energy as Sir Lucious, but it reestablishes Big Boi as a dependable record maker who will always make music worth checking for, no matter what <b>else</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> around him. He’s not really {{in a position to}} be competing against Migos on rap radio, and he doesn’t want to, at all." [...] Alex Macpherson of The Guardian stated: [...] " [...] A sprinkling of electro bleeps throws Boomiverse back to the 1980s and on irresistible highlight Chocolate, Big Boi morphs into Missy Elliott in her house-dabbling phase. He’s careful to drop a Future reference here and borrow Kendrick Lamar’s cadence there to root it in the present, but Boomiverse’s self-conscious stylistic plurality is the new old-school. [...] "All Night", simultaneously too wacky and too obvious, is a moment to cringe at, {{but for the most part}} this is dad rap that can hold its head high." ...|$|E
5000|$|Rolling Stone Daniel Kreps {{wrote the}} song {{contains}} [...] "a tropical house vibe". In contrary, Taj Ran from Billboard wrote the song [...] "isn’t {{part of a}} new genre that many in the mainstream media are calling tropical house. Antis lead single is undeniably drenched in dancehall, a genre with deep roots in Jamaicas club scene that spun off from reggae in the 1970s." [...] According to The Atlantics Spencer Kornhaber, the single has [...] "strangely unfinished quality" [...] that features its verses, choruses and bridge fade into themselves, [...] "forgoing soft-to-loud explosions or exciting rhythmic changes". He also noted that, Boi-1da also tries to create [...] "escalation" [...] in the song by adding additional drums for the second chorus, flutes, autotuned harmonies and back-off piano. The New York Times Jon Caramanica noted Rihanna at times [...] "barely even relies on words, truncating her syllables past patois to something far less exact." [...] Lyrically, [...] "Work" [...] is [...] "about working for a paycheck no matter what <b>else</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> in your life."

5000|$|Phyllis Allenby is a {{young and}} {{beautiful}} woman who is soon {{to be married to}} barrister and boyfriend Barry Lanfield. Phyllis is living at the Allenby Mansion without the protection of a male, along with her aunt Martha and her cousin Carol and the servant Hannah. As the wedding date approaches, London is shocked by a series of murders at the local park, where the victims are discovered with throats ripped out. Many of the detectives at Scotland Yard begin murmuring about werewolves, while Inspector Pierce believes the opposite and suspects strange activity at the Allenby Mansion (which is near the park), where the [...] "Wolf-Woman" [...] is seen prowling at night and heading for the park. Phyllis becomes extremely terrified and anxious, since she is convinced that she is the [...] "Wolf-Woman", deeply believing in the legend of the so-called [...] "Curse of the Allenbys". Aunt Martha tries to convince Phyllis how ridiculous the legend sounds, while she (Aunt Martha) and Carol are suspicious in their own ways. Phyllis each day denies Barry visiting her, and when a suspicious detective is murdered soon after he visits the mansion in the same way the other victims perished, Barry begins believing that something <b>else</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> beside the so-called [...] "Werewolf murders" [...] and makes his own investigations both of the park and the mansion. It turns out that Aunt Martha did the attacks to convince Phyllis she was insane, and belonged in an asylum rather than married to Barry, so Martha and her daughter could remain living in the mansion.|$|E
50|$|Warwick {{does not}} {{recognize}} Ondine as the woman {{he saw in the}} water only a year before. Ondine is on her way to be hanged for poaching an animal on a lord’s property. In the last minutes of her life, Ondine regrets that she could not find the traitor who killed her father and would’ve killed her had she not run away. She thinks it {{too good to be true}} when Warwick saves Ondine from the hangman’s rope by marrying her. Her only thought is of leaving him, but after trying to escape once, she realizes that being Warwick’s wife can provide her with the protection she needs to devise a plan to clear her father’s name. Through constant bickering with Warwick, she is able to play the part of his wife in front of his brother and the servants. Ondine is, however, constantly plagued by nightmares of her father’s death by the hands of her step uncle, William, and cousin, Raoul, who threatened to incriminate her as well if she did not marry Raoul. She is also frustrated by her new husband’s lack of communication with her about his family history. She learns that his grandmother is rumored to have been murdered by his grandfather’s mistress. Later, she discovers that Mathilda was the daughter of her grandfather’s affair, and Clinton is Mathilda’s son. Warwick constantly dismisses Ondine’s temper and frustrations. He tells everyone that she is pregnant hoping to lure out his wife’s killer. Ondine knows something <b>else</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> after she hears a voice whispering her name in bedchamber. Overshadowing this fear is the prospect of going to court with Warwick because she does not want to be recognized as a traitor. Despite their bickering, Warwick and Ondine both see glimpses of good in each other and are falling in love.|$|E

The two young men had disappeared, so had Jules, but {{everything}} <b>else</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> just as before; the bandsman still twanging out his czardas; the waiters serving drinks; the orientals trying to sell their carpets. I paid the bill, sought out the manager, and apologised. He shrugged his shoulders, smiled and said: [...] "An eccentric, your friend, nicht wahr?" [...] Could he tell me where M. Le Ferrier was? He could not. I left to look for Jules; could not find him, and returned to my hotel disgusted. I was sorry for my old guest, but vexed with him too; what business had he to carry his Quixotism to such an unpleasant length? I tried to read. Eleven o'clock struck; the casino disgorged a stream of people; the Place seemed fuller of life than ever; then slowly it grew empty and quite dark. The whim seized me to go out. It was a still night, very warm, very black. On one of the seats a man and woman sat embraced, on another a girl was sobbing, on a third--strange sight--a priest dozed. I became aware of some one at my side; it was my old guest.|$|R
5000|$|The Albanian {{government}} {{tried to}} keep secret {{the news of the}} Italian ultimatum. While Radio Tirana persistently broadcast that nothing was happening, people became suspicious; and the news of the Italian ultimatum was spread from unofficial sources. On April 5 the king's son was born and the news was announced by cannons. People poured out into the streets alarmed, but the news of the newborn prince calmed them. People were suspicious that something <b>else</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on,</b> which led to an anti-Italian demonstration in Tirana the same day. On 6 April there were several demonstrations in Albania's main cities. That same afternoon 100 Italian aircraft flew over Tirana, Durrës, and Vlorë, dropping leaflets instructing the people to submit to Italian occupation. The people were infuriated by this demonstration of force and called for the government to resist and to release the Albanians arrested as [...] "communists". The crowd shouted, [...] "Give us arms! We are being sold out! We are being betrayed!". While a mobilization of the reserves was called, many high-ranking officers left the country. Also the government was fading away. The Minister of the Interior, Musa Juka, left the country for Yugoslavia the same day. While King Zog broadcast to the nation that he would resist Italian occupation, people felt that they were being abandoned by their government.|$|R

Many Muslims—and Orientalists—will tell you otherwise, of course, but the fact is that a fifth of the Koranic text is just incomprehensible. This is what has caused the traditional anxiety regarding translation. If the Koran is not comprehensible—if it can't even be understood in Arabic—then it's not translatable. People fear that. And since the Koran claims repeatedly to be clear but obviously is not—as even speakers of Arabic will tell you—there is a contradiction.
