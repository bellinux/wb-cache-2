6000|$|These {{examples}} (and {{others might}} be adduced) serve {{to show that}} Milton's ear was too busy about the larger interests of his measures to be always careful of the lesser. He was a strategist rather than a drill-sergeant in verse, capable, beyond any other English poet, of putting great masses through the most complicated evolutions without clash or confusion, {{but he was not}} curious that every foot should be at the same angle. In reading [...] "Paradise Lost" [...] one has a feeling of vastness. You float under an illimitable sky, brimmed with sunshine or hung with constellations; the abysses of space are about you; you hear the cadenced surges of an unseen ocean; thunders mutter round the horizon; and if the scene change, it is with an <b>elemental</b> <b>movement</b> like the shifting of mighty winds. His imagination seldom condenses, like Shakespeare's, in the kindling flash of a single epithet, but loves better to diffuse itself. Witness his descriptions, wherein he seems to circle like an eagle bathing in the blue streams of air, controlling with his eye broad sweeps of champaign or of sea, and rarely fulmining in the sudden swoop of intenser expression. He was fonder of the vague, perhaps I should rather say the indefinite, where more is meant than meets the ear, than any other of our poets. He loved epithets (like old and far) that suggest great reaches, whether of space or time. This bias shows itself already in his earlier poems, as where he hears ...|$|E
6000|$|Take from Wordsworth all {{which an}} honest {{criticism}} cannot but allow, {{and what is}} left will show how truly great he was. He had no humor, no dramatic power, and his temperament was of that dry and juiceless quality, that in all his published correspondence you shall not find a letter, but only essays. If we consider carefully where he was most successful, we shall find {{that it was not}} so much in description of natural scenery, or delineation of character, as in vivid expression of the effect produced by external objects and events upon his own mind, and of the shape and hue (perhaps momentary) which they in turn took from his mood or temperament. His finest passages are always monologues. He had a fondness for particulars, and there are parts of his poems which remind us of local histories in the undue relative importance given to trivial matters. He was the historian of Wordsworthshire. This power of particularization (for it is as truly a power as generalization) is what gives such vigor and greatness to single lines and sentiments of Wordsworth, and to poems developing a single thought or sentiment. It was this that made him so fond of the sonnet. That sequestered nook forced upon him the limits which his fecundity (if I may not say his garrulity) was never self-denying enough to impose on itself. It suits his solitary and meditative temper, and it was there that Lamb (an admirable judge of what was permanent in literature) liked him best. Its narrow bounds, but fourteen paces from end to end, turn into a virtue his too common fault of giving undue prominence to every passing emotion. He excels in monologue, and the law of the sonnet tempers monologue with mercy. In [...] "The Excursion" [...] we are driven to the subterfuge of a French verdict of extenuating circumstances. His mind had not that reach and <b>elemental</b> <b>movement</b> of Milton's, which, like the tradewind, gathered to itself thoughts and images like stately fleets from every quarter; some deep with silks and spicery, some brooding over the silent thunders of their battailous armaments, but all swept forward in their destined track, over the long billows of his verse, every inch of canvas strained by the unifying breath of their common epic impulse. It was an organ that Milton mastered, mighty in compass, capable equally of the trumpet's ardors or the slim delicacy of the flute, and sometimes it bursts forth in great crashes through his prose, as if he touched it for solace in the intervals of his toil. If Wordsworth sometimes puts the trumpet to his lips, yet he lays it aside soon and willingly for his appropriate instrument, the pastoral reed. And it is not one that grew by any vulgar stream, but that which Apollo breathed through, tending the flocks of Admetus,--that which Pan endowed with every melody of the visible universe,--the same in which the soul of the despairing nymph took refuge and gifted with her dual nature,--so that ever and anon, amid the notes of human joy or sorrow, there comes suddenly a deeper and almost awful tone, thrilling us into dim consciousness of a forgotten divinity.|$|E

An investigated element was on five sides of the synthetic upper extremity motor function (STEF) as to the spinal cord deficiency symptom (FES), the repetitive movement speed (ten-second test), the muscle power (power grip and the pinch power), the <b>elemental</b> <b>movement</b> (separative function : FFT) of the fingers. And, which element improved in which time, or it was examined. Cervical cord deficiency symptom and a repetitive movement speed, the <b>elemental</b> <b>movement</b> of finger (separative movement) improved remarkably by a one month postoperatively, and then did not improve any further. On the other hand, bimanual intrinsic muscle power and the synthetic upper extremity motor function improved soon after the operation, and continued to improve. There was no change in extrinsic muscle power in until one month postoperatively. But, a remarkable change was shown after that until three months postoperatively...|$|E

500|$|Theories in the [...] "learning" [...] {{category}} {{almost all}} derive from publications by Marr and Albus. Marr's 1969 paper {{proposed that the}} cerebellum is a device for learning to associate <b>elemental</b> <b>movements</b> encoded by climbing fibers with mossy fiber inputs that encode the sensory context. Albus proposed in 1971 that a cerebellar Purkinje cell functions as a perceptron, a neurally inspired abstract learning device. The most basic difference between the Marr and Albus theories is that Marr assumed that climbing fiber activity would cause parallel fiber synapses to be strengthened, whereas Albus proposed {{that they would be}} weakened. Albus also formulated his version as a software algorithm he called a CMAC (Cerebellar Model Articulation Controller), which has been tested in a number of applications.|$|R
40|$|Abstraction of complex, longer motor tasks into simpler <b>elemental</b> <b>movements</b> enables {{humans and}} animals to exhibit motor skills which {{have not yet been}} matched by robots. Humans {{intuitively}} decompose complex motions into smaller, simpler segments. For example when describing simple movements like drawing a triangle with a pen, we can easily name the basic steps of this movement. Surprisingly, such abstractions have rarely been used in artificial motor skill learning algorithms. These algorithms typically choose a new action (such as a torque or a force) at a very fast time-scale. As a result, both policy and temporal credit assignment problem become unnecessarily complex - often beyond the reach of current machine learning methods. We introduce a new framework for temporal abstractions in reinforcement learning (RL), i. e. RL with motion templates. We present a new algorithm for this framework which can learn high-quality policies by making only few abstract decisions...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, policy search {{methods for}} {{robotics}} [1]– [4] have yielded encouraging results on tasks which are infeasible to encode by hand or to teach via demonstration. For example, Ng and Coates [3] have used policy search to develop autonomous stunt helicopters, Kober et al. [2] have shown {{how to learn}} the game ‘ball in a cup’, and Kormushev et al. [4] learned how to flip pancakes. We focus on learning to sequence motor primitives with policy search. A motor primitive encodes an <b>elemental</b> <b>movement</b> and is typically represented as parametrized policy. Policy search methods directly search for parameters of the primitives that yield high rewards. While, the use of policy search methods is often limited to learning a single motor primitive, many complex tasks require the sequential combination of motor primitives. For example, playing a game of tennis doe...|$|E
40|$|Single-molecule {{mechanical}} {{interactions between}} rabbit heavy meromyosin (HMM) or subfragment 1 (S 1) and rabbit actin were measured with an optical tweezers piconewton, nanometer transducer. Similar intermittent interactions were observed with HMM and S 1. The mean {{magnitude of the}} single interaction isotonic displacements was 20 nm for HMM and 15 nm with S 1. The mean value of the force of single-molecule interactions was 1. 8 pN for HMM and 1. 7 pN with S 1. The stiffness of myosin S 1 was determined by applying a sinusoidal length change to the thin filament and measuring the corresponding force; the mean stiffness was 0. 13 pN nm- 1. By moving an actin filament over a long distance past an isolated S 1 head, we found that cross-bridge attachment occurred preferentially at a periodicity of about 40 nm, {{similar to that of}} the actin helical repeat. Rate constants for the probability of detachment of HMM from actin were determined from histograms of the lifetime of the attached state. This gave a value of 8 s- 1 or 0. 8 x 10 (6) M- 1 s- 1 for binding of ATP to the rigor complex. We conclude (1) that our HMM-actin interactions involve just one head, (2) that compliance of the cross-bridge is not in myosin subfragment 2, although we cannot say to what extent contributions arise from myosin S 1 or actin, and (3) that the <b>elemental</b> <b>movement</b> can be caused by a change of shape of the S 1 head, but that this would have to be much greater than the movements suggested from structural studies of S 1 (Rayment et al., 1993) ...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} geochemical {{profiles of}} a tephra-bearing minerotrophic peat column from NE-Iceland obtained using various elemental {{analyses of the}} solid phase and the pore water. The influence of tephra grain size, thickness and composition of each tephra on the peat geochemistry was investigated. Interpretations are supported by a statistical approach, in particular by autocorrelation, and by microscopy observations. Minerotrophic peat geochemistry may be strongly dependent upon post-depositional mobilization and possible leaching of elements as demonstrated by Fe and trace metal concentration profiles. Chemical elements, and more specifically potentially harmful metals, can be slowly leached out of volcanic falls during their weathering and re-accumulate downwards. It is emphasised that a tephra deposit can act as an active geochemical barrier, blocking downward <b>elemental</b> <b>movements</b> and leading {{to the formation of}} enriched layers.

40|$|Handwriting {{has been}} studied for a long time, because of its {{widespread}} use {{as a means for}} human-to -human communication. The variability of handwriting, due to differences in cultures, writer styles, alphabets or fonts, make it an interesting problem in the field of pattern recognition. For cursive writing, segmentation is necessary within strokes since several characters can be made with one stroke. Cursive script recognition is difficult because several characters can be written with a single stroke. Owing to the difficulty of this problem, there have been many serious efforts toward obtaining a solution. In this paper, we propose and experimentally study an on-line handwriting segmentation system, we pay attention to the preprocessing stage. This step is necessary because our system considers on-line handwritten specimen as a signal with dynamic information, that can be split into components, which are in turn divided to <b>elemental</b> <b>movements,</b> called strokes. The objective of segmentation is to divide complex handwriting pieces into simpler ones, in order to reduce input pattern variability and thus simplify the classifier structure. In this work initial data are isolated characters composed of one or more components, which are to be segmented into strokes. There are 25 stroke to segment 26 letters in English. We propose optimal filter to smoothing the signal of the character. The segmentation algorithm is based on the maximum and minimum speed analysis of the pen's movement. The percentage of success depends {{on the quality of the}} handwriting. The vibration of the hand may affect handwriting quality. In the case of 26 letters, the success rate is 73...|$|R

VIT decreases slowly each turn for every character except the protagonist, and can be restored after battle by giving that unit items that they like; VIT decreases faster if a unit is deployed against a character {{that he or she}} does not want to fight.|$|R
40|$|Cognitive {{archaeology}} investigates tool-use and tool-making {{procedures to}} make inference about human cognitive evolution. These inquiries often trace the progressive complexity of artefacts through {{the archaeological record}} and deduce the cognitive abilities that accompanied technological changes such as language. However, the cognitive mechanisms underlying stone tool manufacture have not been investigated using validated methods. Thus, {{it is unclear whether}} these behaviours rely on linguistic resources or draw upon other neural circuits. The aims of this thesis were to identify the working memory and neural resources associated with tool-use and tool-making. Dual-task experiments were performed on undergraduate students and experienced knappers to investigate whether tool-use and tool-making recruited verbal and/or spatial working memory resources. Positron Emission Tomography was also used to identify the brain regions recruited during stone tool manufacture and whether, as cognitive archaeology assumes, the manufacture of more complex tool forms recruits more sophisticated brain circuitry. It was found that tool-use recruited spatial working memory and that verbal working memory resources were not required unless the task demands contained a specific verbal component. It was also found that the performance of the individual movement elements in non-hierarchical order did not tax spatial working memory above that required to perform the hierarchical sequence. These results were replicated with expert stone tool knappers, indicating that tool-making does not require input from verbal resources. Rather, stone tool manufacture recruits spatial working memory. Further, performance of the <b>elemental</b> knapping <b>movements</b> in a non-hierarchical order required spatial working memory resources comparable to actual stone tool manufacture. These findings were supported by Positron Emission Tomography scanning which identified that manufacture of more complex tool forms did not necessarily recruit more sophisticated neural resources. Further, the performance of the <b>elemental</b> knapping <b>movements</b> in non-hierarchical order was more neurologically demanding than tool-making. It was thus concluded that traditional investigative techniques of cognitive archaeology do not provide reliable insight into the cognitive processes underlying tool-use and tool-making. These results also cast doubt on theories which argue that stone tool played a direct role in language evolution...|$|R
40|$|Sequences of {{movements}} are initiated abnormally in neurological disorders involving basal ganglia dysfunction, such as Parkinson's disease or Tourette's syndrome. The substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNpr) {{is one of}} the two primary output structures of the basal ganglia. However, little is known about how substantia nigra mediates the initiation of normal movement sequences. We studied its role in coding initiation of a sequentially stereotyped but natural movement sequence by recording neuronal activity in SNpr during behavioural performance of ‘syntactic grooming chains’. These are rule-governed sequences of up to 25 grooming movements emitted in four predictable (syntactic) phases, which occur spontaneously during grooming behaviour by rats and other rodents. Our results show that neuronal activation in central SNpr codes the onset of this entire rule-governed sequential pattern of grooming actions, not <b>elemental</b> grooming <b>movements.</b> We conclude that the context of sequential pattern may be more important than the elemental motor parameters in determining SNpr neuronal activation...|$|R

Travelling across Ninjago, Wu and his four elementally-attuned students, Kai (Fire), Jay (Lightning), Zane (Ice) and Cole (Earth) recover the Golden Weapons. Kai rescues his sister Nya, whose capture fueled his desire to become a Ninja, from skeletons, and makes peace with the Dragon guardians of the Golden Weapons. However, {{in order to keep the}} Sword of Fire from Garmadon, Wu travels to the Underworld to fight his corrupted brother. The four ninja follow Wu down on the dragons, who have the capability to travel between the worlds. After defeating the Skeleton Army with the ultimate Spinjitzu move, the Tornado of Creation, they come upon Wu fighting the general of the Skeleton Army, Samukai, who is in possession of three of the Golden Weapons (the nunchucks, shurikens and scythe - stolen from the ninja earlier while they rested in the forests near the Fire Temple). Wu is defeated and Samukai tries to take the sword for his own, but is destroyed due to their combined power, which no one can withstand except the First Spinjitzu Master himself. This allows Garmadon to escape through a portal between space-time, but he vows to one day return with enough power to wield the Golden Weapons. With Garmadon gone, the balance is temporarily restored, and the Ninja prepare to train themselves for the day the Dark Lord returns.|$|R

We envision an exciting synergy between animal ecology and GPS-based radiotelemetry, as for other examples of new technologies stimulating rapid conceptual advances, where research opportunities have been paralleled by technical and analytical challenges. Animal positions provide the <b>elemental</b> unit of <b>movement</b> paths and show where individuals interact with the ecosystems around them. We discuss how knowing where animals go can help scientists {{in their search for}} a mechanistic understanding of key concepts of animal ecology, including resource use, home range and dispersal, and population dynamics. It is probable that in the not-so-distant future, intense sampling of movements coupled with detailed information on habitat features at a variety of scales will allow us to represent an animal's cognitive map of its environment, and the intimate relationship between behaviour and fitness.

The model can generate <b>elemental</b> raw eye <b>movement</b> data in a four-second eye viewing window with a 25 Hz sampling rate. Based on the physiology and psychology characters of human vision system, the fitness function of the GA model is constructed by taking into consideration of five factors including the saliency map, short time memory, saccades distribution, Region of Interest (ROI) map, and a retina model. Our model can produce the scan path of a subject viewing an image, not just several fixations points or artificial ROI's as in the other models. We have also developed both subjective and objective methods to evaluate the model by comparing its behavior with the real eye movement data collected from an eye tracker. Tested on 18 (9 times 2) images from both an obvious-object image group and a non-obvious-object image group, the subjective evaluations shows very close scores between the scan paths generated by the GA model and those real scan paths; for the objective evaluation, experimental {{results show that the}} distance between GA's scan paths and human scan paths of the same image has no significant difference by a probability of 78. 9 % on average.

The {{purpose of this article is}} to show the advantages and the effectiveness of the <b>elemental</b> music and <b>movement</b> approach when applied in a group of students with special educational needs in a public school for special education. The motivation of the cooperating teachers in selecting this specific group stemmed from the particular challenges that they were facing. The first challenge was the lack of homogeneity among the students. There were children with mental deficiencies, pervasive developmental disorders (autism) and rare syndromes. The second challenge was that the programme focused on only one specific topic that sought to acquaint children with their body and how to relate to it through space and time. The final challenge was the use of music and movement as the main means of achieving the goals of this programme. The goals were both musical and non-musical. The outcomes of the programme were thought to be positive by both teachers. The students worked in a group and their cooperation increased progressively during the programme.
