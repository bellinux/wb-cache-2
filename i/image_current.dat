5|$|At {{the start}} of 1998, Ferraro left Crossfire {{and ran for the}} Democratic {{nomination}} again in the 1998 United States Senate election in New York. The other candidates were Congressman Charles Schumer and New York City Public Advocate Mark J. Green. She had done no fundraising, out of fear of conflict of interest with her Crossfire job, but was nonetheless immediately perceived as the front-runner. Indeed, December and January polls had her 25percentage points ahead of Green in the race and even further ahead of Schumer. Unlike the previous campaigns, her family finances never became an issue. However, she lost ground during the summer, with Schumer catching up in the polls by early August and then soon passing her. Schumer, a tireless fundraiser, outspent her by a five-to-one margin, and Ferraro failed to establish a political <b>image</b> <b>current</b> with the times. In the , 1998 primary, she was beaten soundly by Schumer by a 51percent to 26percent margin. Unlike 1992, the contest was not divisive, and Ferraro and third-place finisher Green endorsed Schumer at a unity breakfast the following day. Schumer would go on to decisively unseat D'Amato in the general election.|$|E
25|$|Orbitrap {{instruments}} {{are similar to}} Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometers (see text below). Ions are electrostatically trapped in an orbit around a central, spindle shaped electrode. The electrode confines the ions so that they both orbit around the central electrode and oscillate back and forth along the central electrode's long axis. This oscillation generates an <b>image</b> <b>current</b> in the detector plates which is recorded by the instrument. The frequencies of these image currents depend on the mass-to-charge ratios of the ions. Mass spectra are obtained by Fourier transformation of the recorded image currents.|$|E
25|$|Typically, {{some type}} of {{electron}} multiplier is used, though other detectors including Faraday cups and ion-to-photon detectors are also used. Because the number of ions leaving the mass analyzer at a particular instant is typically quite small, considerable amplification is often necessary to get a signal. Microchannel plate detectors are commonly used in modern commercial instruments. In FTMS and Orbitraps, the detector consists {{of a pair of}} metal surfaces within the mass analyzer/ion trap region which the ions only pass near as they oscillate.

2500|$|Fourier {{transform}} {{mass spectrometry}} (FTMS), {{or more precisely}} Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance MS, measures mass by detecting the <b>image</b> <b>current</b> produced by ions cyclotroning {{in the presence of}} a magnetic field. Instead of measuring the deflection of ions with a detector such as an electron multiplier, the ions are injected into a Penning trap (a static electric/magnetic ion trap) where they effectively form part of a circuit. Detectors at fixed positions in space measure the electrical signal of ions which pass near them over time, producing a periodic signal. Since the frequency of an ion's cycling is determined by its mass-to-charge ratio, this can be deconvoluted by performing a Fourier transform on the signal. FTMS has the advantage of high sensitivity (since each ion is [...] "counted" [...] more than once) and much higher resolution and thus precision.|$|E
2500|$|Fourier-transform ion {{cyclotron}} resonance mass spectrometry {{is a type of}} mass analyzer (or mass spectrometer) for determining the mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of ions based on the cyclotron frequency of the ions in a fixed magnetic field. The ions are trapped in a Penning trap (a magnetic field with electric trapping plates), where they are excited (at their resonant cyclotron frequencies) to a larger cyclotron radius by an oscillating electric field orthogonal to the magnetic field. After the excitation field is removed, the ions are rotating at their cyclotron frequency in phase (as a [...] "packet" [...] of ions). These ions induce a charge (detected as an <b>image</b> <b>current)</b> on a pair of electrodes as the packets of ions pass close to them. The resulting signal is called a free induction decay (FID), transient or interferogram that consists of a superposition of sine waves. The useful signal is extracted from this data by performing a Fourier transform to give a mass spectrum.|$|E

50|$|The Scanning SQUID Microscopy (SSM) {{data are}} <b>current</b> density <b>images</b> and <b>current</b> peak <b>images.</b> The <b>current</b> density <b>images</b> give the {{magnitude}} of the current, while the <b>current</b> peak <b>images</b> reveal the <b>current</b> path with a ± 3 μm resolution. Obtaining the SSM data from scanning advanced wire-bond packages is only half the task; fault localization is still necessary. The critical step is to overlay the SSM <b>current</b> <b>images</b> or <b>current</b> path <b>images</b> with CAD files such as bonding diagrams or RTX images to pinpoint the faultlocation. To make alignment of overlaying possible, an optical two-point reference alignment is made. The package edge andpackage fiducial are the most convenient package markings to align to. Based on the data analysis, fault localization by SSM shouldisolate the short in the die, bond wires or package substrate. After all non-destructive approaches are exhausted, the finalstep is destructive deprocessing to verify SSM data. Depending on fault isolation, the deprocessing techniques include decapsulation, parallel lapping or cross-section.|$|R

Like in FTICR-MS, all the ions are detected simultaneously over some given period of time and resolution can be improved by increasing the strength of the field or by increasing the detection period. The Orbitrap differs from FTICR-MS by the absence of a magnetic field and hence has a significantly slower decrease of resolving power with increasing m/z.|$|E

One side of the feedline from the receiver or transmitter {{is connected to the}} conductor, and the other side to ground and/or the artificial ground plane. The monopole is best understood as a dipole antenna in which one conductor is omitted; the radiation is generated as if the second arm of the dipole were present due to the effective <b>image</b> <b>current</b> seen as a reflection of the monopole from the ground. Since all of the equivalent dipole's radiation is concentrated in a half-space, the antenna has twice (3 dB increase of) the gain of a similar dipole, not considering losses in the ground plane.|$|E

50|$|Differential {{signaling}} {{is often}} used in computers to reduce electromagnetic interference, because complete screening is not possible with microstrips and chips in computers, due to geometric constraints {{and the fact that}} screening does not work at DC. If a DC power supply line and a low-voltage signal line share the same ground, the power current returning through the ground can induce a significant voltage in it. A low-resistance ground reduces this problem to some extent. A balanced pair of microstrip lines is a convenient solution, because it does not need an additional PCB layer, as a stripline does. Because each line causes a matching <b>image</b> <b>current</b> in the ground plane, which is required anyway for supplying power, the pair looks like four lines and therefore has a shorter crosstalk distance than a simple isolated pair. In fact, it behaves as well as a twisted pair. Low crosstalk is important when many lines are packed into a small space, as on a typical PCB.|$|E

5000|$|In addition, the {{reflection}} phase of incident light {{is part of}} the AMC and HIS tool box. [...] The phase of the reflected electric field has normal incidence the same phase of the electric field impinging at the interface of the reflecting surface. The variation of {{the reflection}} phase is continuous between +180◦ to −180◦ relative to the frequency. Zero is crossed at one frequency, where resonance occurs. A notable characteristic is that the useful bandwidth of an AMC is generally defined as +90◦ to −90◦ {{on either side of the}} central frequency. Thus, due to this unusual boundary condition, in contrast to the case of a conventional metal ground plane, an AMC surface can function as a new type of ground plane for low-profile wire antennas (wireless communication systems). For example, even though a horizontal wire antenna is extremely close to an AMC surface, the current on the antenna and its <b>image</b> <b>current</b> on the ground plane are in-phase, rather than out-of phase, thereby strengthening the radiation.|$|E
