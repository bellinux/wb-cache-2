Divided into three chronological periods, the overall picture shows that public <b>works</b> <b>engineers</b> have gradually enlarged their original working areas (construction and maintenance of transport communication for the state). Described with the aid of numerous tables, this spreading out concerns both the opening out onto new employers (from the state to private enterprise and local authorities) as well as onto new domains within the state (research, management, environment) ...|$|R

40|$|The article aims {{to analyze}} the {{interface}} of reflexivity, knowledge and ecologic awareness {{in the context of}} <b>hospital</b> <b>work,</b> based on data collected in a qualitative case study carried out at a public hospital. Field observation data and interviews are discussed in the light of sociologic and philosophic references. Workers expressed the interface between knowledge and action, {{in which there is a}} cycle of lack of knowledge, automatism in the actions and lack of environmental awareness, posing limits to individual awareness and to responsibility towards environmental preservation. Increased debate and education, including the environmental issue, are needed in the context of <b>hospital</b> <b>work.</b> Although <b>hospital</b> <b>work</b> is reflexively affected by the environmental problem, that does not guarantee the reorientation of practices and responsible action towards the environment...|$|R
