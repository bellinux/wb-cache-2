5000|$|Globally, as of 2008, {{at least}} 77 {{countries}} and territories offer NSPs with varying structures, aims and goals. Some countries use needle exchange services as part of integrated programs to contain drug use, while others aim simply to contain HIV infection as their top priority, considering reduction in incidence of drug use as a much lower priority. [...] Acceptance of NSPs vary widely from country to country. On the one hand, in Australia and New Zealand, <b>electronic</b> <b>dispensing</b> machines are available at selected locations such as the Auckland needle exchange and the Christchurch needle exchange, allowing needle exchange service 24 hours to registered users.

40|$|Automated {{dispensing}} machines (ADM) are {{a computerized}} companion technology that reduces labor {{and contributes to}} patient safety. When stocked, ADMs store medications and control <b>electronic</b> <b>dispensing.</b> In emergent situations, facilities can approve nursing retrieval of medications prior to pharmacy review via override from the ADM. However, retrieving medications by the override mechanism and administering prior to pharmacy review increases the risk for medication errors. The primary objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the appropriateness of medications removed from the ADM using the override function at a facility owned by Hospital Corporation of America (HCA). The secondary objective was to determine the barcode scan rates of medications removed by the override function. Information was collected to determine which medications were removed from the ADM and the shift, indication, and medication barcode/patient armband scanning rates. Based on medication errors identified, significant changes have been made to the override process, including the number of medications available for override and the requirement of an indication prior to medication removal. Formulary changes were made and opportunities for education identified during the evaluation. This study highlighted an opportunity to embed the culture of patient safety to promote safe medication practices...|$|E
40|$|As {{part of the}} National Programme for IT (NPfIT) in England, the Electronic Prescription Service (EPS) {{is being}} {{implemented}} in two releases. The first release placed barcodes on prescriptions and is widely implemented. Release two (EPS 2), the electronic transmission of prescriptions between GP, pharmacy and the reimbursement body, has just started implementation. On the NPfIT agenda, community pharmacies have been predicted to benefit from changes in work practice following the full EPS implementation. The study focused on how the advanced EPS (EPS 2) might alter dispensing work practice in community pharmacies {{on issues such as}} workflow and workload; and the bearing of these issues on improvement in quality of service and safety. This paper demonstrates how findings of the pre-implementation study were used to provide formative feedback to the implementers. A mixed ethnographical method that combined non- participant observations, shadowing and interviews, before and after implementation, was used to qualitatively study eight community pharmacies across three early adopter Primary Care Trusts (PCTs) in England. Key implementation issues were fed-back to the PCTs as part of the EPS 2 rolling-out process. Staff access to dispensing terminals needs to be improved if <b>electronic</b> <b>dispensing</b> is to be encouraged. Also, as a safety issue, pharmacists are planning to print off electronic prescriptions (tokens) and dispense from them. Although safer, this could increase workload. The EPS 2 could positively alter work practice by improving certain demanding aspects of dispensing whilst reducing human errors. For example, the high demand of customers handing in prescriptions and waiting for them to be dispensed could be reduced through automation. Also, the extreme variation in workload during various times of the day could be evened out to improve workflow and provide a better service; however, in order for this to be fully realized, technical issues such as number of staff per dispensing station and dispensing from tokens would need to be addressed...|$|E

40|$|Aim: To {{determine}} {{the validity of}} <b>electronic</b> hospital pharmacy <b>dispensing</b> records {{as an indicator of}} late gestation exposure to antidepressants using medical records as the gold standard. Method:Medical records (gold standard) were reviewed for a consecutive sample of 400 women who delivered at a large maternity hospital during 2005. Data on antidepressants used in pregnancy from the medical records were compared with the <b>electronic</b> pharmacy <b>dispensing</b> records to ascertain sensitivity and specificity. Results: According to the medical records, 12 (3 %) women were identified as taking antidepressants during late gestation. The <b>electronic</b> pharmacy <b>dispensing</b> records correctly identified 9 women as exposed to antidepressants (sensitivity score 75 %; 95 %CI 43 – 95). No women were classified as exposed according to pharmacy dispensing records and classified as not exposed according to the medical records (specificity score 100 %; 95 %CI 99 – 100). 7 (1. 8 %) women were identified in the medical records as taking antidepressants but had either stopped prior to pregnancy or on finding out that they were pregnant. These patients were not identified in the pharmacy <b>dispensing</b> records. Conclusion: <b>Electronic</b> hospital pharmacy <b>dispensing</b> records may provide an efficient alternative to paper records for identifying late gestation exposure to antidepressants, but will underestimate the exposure by 25 %. ...|$|R

40|$|Photosynthetic water {{oxidation}} at the Mn 4 Ca-cluster of Photosystem II (PSII), {{a process}} of fundamental importance for the atmosphere and biosphere on the earth, is only insuffciently understood. X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) {{on the structure of}} the Mn 4 Ca-cluster and, in particular, on the structural changes in the catalytic cycle has resulted in central contributions to unravel the mechanism of photosynthetic water oxidation. In the presented thesis two specific contributions are described. 1. Room-temperature and time-resolved XAS on intermediates in the catalytic cycle Through preperative investigations a minimal water content of PSII membrane particles could possible down to 50 % (weight per weight). This is requered for an optimal signal-to-noise ratio. Using a <b>electronic</b> <b>dispensing</b> system the automated preparation of PSII samples on specifically designed samples stripes has been achieved. An apparatus for automated sample change during the XAS measurements has been developed that facilitated Laser-flash application and XAS measurements on up to 10, 000 PSII samples per beamtime period. Only by means of this improved methodology, a series of investigation on the Mn 4 Ca-cluster in its catalytic cycle became possible. Thereby the rate and temperature dependence of the X-ray induced reduction of the Mn 4 Ca-cluster was thoroughly characterized. And for the first time, structure and oxidation state of the Mn 4 Ca-cluster at room temperature (functional and quasi-native conditions) has been characterized for all four semi-stable intermediate states of the S-state cycle and compared to data collected at 20 K. Time-resolved XAS measurements at 10 &# 956;s resolution facilitated discovery and identification of a novel reaction intermediate. The results lead to an extension of the fundamental S-state cycle and bear important mechanistic implications. 2. XAS at the Ca K-edge on the position of Ca coordination environment By optimization of a procedure for removal of excessive calcium, the Ca 2 + content could be reduced down to a level of 2 - 3 Ca per PSII, without significant activity loss. In spite of the experimental difficulties, it became possible to collect and analyze XAS data for PSII samples in the S 1 -state. First attempts to characterize the S 2 -state were made. One result is, that the calcium is at a distance of ca. 3. 3 Å to more than one manganese ion. This result is in good agreement with recent crystallographic data and with the XAS results of other research groups...|$|E

40|$|Aim: To {{characterize}} {{the numbers of}} reagent strips dispensed for self-monitoring of blood glucose to patients with Type 2 diabetes in Tayside, Scotland, in 1993, 1999 and 2009. Methods: A diabetes clinical information system in Tayside, record-linked to <b>electronic</b> <b>dispensed</b> prescribing records, was used to collate all dispensed prescribing records for three cross-sectional samples of patients with Type 2 diabetes in 1993 (n = 5728), 1999 (n = 8109) and at 1 January 2009 (n = 16450). The numbers of reagent strips dispensed during the relevant calendar year were calculated and patients stratified by treatment. We also explored whether age, sex or material and social deprivation were associated with whether a patient received strips. Results: Proportions of people who received self-monitoring reagent strips increased from 15. 5 % in 1993, to 24. 2 % in 1999 to 29. 8 % in 2009, as did numbers of strips dispensed. While the proportion of diet-treated patients who received reagent strips was still very low in 2009 (5. 6 %), the proportion among those treated with oral agents tripled from 9. 4 to 27. 4 % between 1993 and 2009. Over 90 % of patients treated with insulin received reagent strips and, among non-insulin-treated patients, this was more common among women, younger people and less deprived groups. Conclusions: The numbers of reagent strips dispensed for self-monitoring of blood glucose has increased and almost all insulin-treated patients receive strips. While few diet-treated patients receive strips, they are more extensively dispensed to those treated with oral agents. Given that self-monitoring of blood glucose is no longer routinely recommended in non-insulin treated patients, strategies to reduce unnecessary dispensing of reagent strips are needed...|$|R

40|$|Objective - To identify, {{critically}} appraise, synthesise {{and present}} {{the available evidence}} on healthcare professionals' perceptions of the facilitators and barriers to implementing <b>electronic</b> prescribing, <b>dispensing</b> and/or administration of medicines in the hospital setting. Methods - A systematic search of studies focusing on healthcare professionals' perceptions of technologies for prescribing, dispensing and administering medicines in the hospital setting was performed using MEDLINE, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, PsycARTICLES, PsycINFO, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and Centre for Reviews and Dissemination. Grey literature inclusive of manual searching of core journals, relevant conference abstracts and online theses were also searched. Independent duplicate screening of titles, abstracts and full texts was performed by the authors. Data extraction and quality assessment were undertaken using standardised tools, followed by narrative synthesis. Key findings - Five papers {{were included in the}} systematic review after screening 2566 titles. Reasons for exclusion were duplicate publication; non-hospital setting; a lack of investigation of healthcare professionals' perceptions and a lack of focus on implementation processes or systems specific to <b>electronic</b> prescribing, <b>dispensing</b> or administration of medicines. Studies were conducted in the USA, Sweden and Australia. All studies used qualitative interview methods. Healthcare professionals perceived systems improved patient safety and provided better access to patients' drug histories and that team leadership and equipment availability and reliability were essential for successful implementation. Key barriers included hardware and network problems; altered work practices such as time pressure on using the system and remote ordering as a potential risk for errors; and weakened interpersonal communication between healthcare professionals and with patients. Conclusions - Few studies were identified on healthcare professionals' perceptions of the facilitators and barriers to system implementation in hospitals. Key facilitators included a perception of increased patient safety and better access to patients' drug history while key barriers involved technical problems, changes to routine work practices and weakened interpersonal communication. Investigating this area further will assist in improving patient safety and reducing medication costs by informing and strengthening implementation strategies...|$|R
40|$|In recent {{pharmacoepidemiology}} research, {{the increasing}} use of <b>electronic</b> medication <b>dispensing</b> data provides an unprecedented opportunity to examine various health outcomes associated with long-term medication usage.

40|$|Patients with HIV who are {{receiving}} antiretroviral (ARV) therapy {{are at high}} risk for drug–drug interactions (DDIs), which can significantly impact patient care and represent a substantial opportunity cost for healthcare systems. DDIs are prevalent in the developed world and in resource-poor settings, with the cost being potentially greater in the latter. Although practically unavoidable in HIV care, many DDIs can be better managed, reducing the risks to patients and the burden on resources. The scope for DDI management is likely to be greater in the developed world, due to the availability of new agents and second-line drugs, which allow greater flexibility of ARV regimens and co-administered drug choice. The advent of electronic prescribing and patient medication records represents an opportunity to aid the identification and management of DDIs. Searchable electronic databases of HIV drug interactions are available, which are a useful tool for HIV healthcare professionals and non-specialists for managing DDIs involving ARVs. Although general active systems that alert prescribers to DDIs currently exist, there is an indication for the development of specialist active databases to be incorporated into <b>electronic</b> prescribing or <b>dispensing</b> systems, with the aim of improving the quality of prescribing and the safe dispensing of the therapeutically risky drugs and complicated regimens used in HIV management...|$|R
