50|$|In {{technical}} drawing, a {{basic dimension}} is a theoretically exact dimension, given from a datum to {{a feature of}} interest. In Geometric dimensioning and tolerancing, basic dimensions are defined as a numerical value {{used to describe the}} theoretically exact size, profile, orientation or location of a feature or <b>datum</b> <b>target.</b> Allowable variations from the theoretically exact geometry are indicated by feature control frames, notes, and tolerances on other non-basic dimensions.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{automotive}} industry {{is affected by}} rising quality requirements for modern cars more than ever. Shortening the development period may involve cancelling the hardware prototype phase, without which the learning process of parts and assembling behavior in the assembling process is omitted. In this context, the subject of dimensional management and especially tolerance simulation is an essential tool. For the digital prototyping phase {{it is essential that}} the simulation rebuilds the real processes. Through the process of validation by production tests, the simulation model becomes more precise, which is necessary to be faster in the subsequent digital concept validation processes. This paper establishes the challenges in simulating real assembly processes in conventional tolerance simulations. It emphasizes the limits of simulating real processes and component behavior in conventional tolerance simulations. The real process with all possible shim settings cannot be simulated using the simulation tools due to the limited <b>datum</b> <b>targets</b> which can be set. Furthermore the component behavior itself should be integrated in the simulation model to get results that are closer to reality, because the reinforcement parts and the alignment scheme are important for assembly accuracy...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a method for {{disclosing}} univariate continuous data by replacing the original data with certain type of intervals. Each of these intervals has the property that it contains the <b>target</b> <b>datum</b> with probability Є, a predetermined number between 0 and 1 / 2. The level Є controls the degree of accuracy of the disclosed interval data. Under a linear model, we further propose to use the grouped likelihood method to make inference on the underlying linear model based on the disclosed interval data. Examples are given for the log-normal populations to show the usefulness of the proposed method...|$|R
40|$|Transformation of {{coordinates}} usually invokes level-wised processes wherein several sets {{of complicated}} equations are calculated. Unfortunately, the accuracy may be corrupted {{due to the}} accumulation of inevitable errors between the transformation processes. This paper presents a genetic-based method for generating regressive models for direct transformation from GPS signals to 2 -D coordinates. Since target coordinates for a GPS application {{can be obtained by}} using simpler transformation formulas, the computational costs and inaccuracy can be reduced. From the experimental results where the <b>target</b> <b>datums</b> TWD 67 is investigated, it seems that the proposed method can serve as a direct and feasible solution to the transformation of GPS coordinates.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} some first {{results of}} a project aimed to access the feasibility of monitoring deformations of large concrete dams by terrestrial laser scanning. For this purpose a test field has been established on the dam of the Cancano Lake (Valtellina, Italy). This {{is made up of}} a geodetic network materializing a local datum for georeferencing all data acquired at different times. A large number of retro-reflecting targets have been positioned and measured by a total station in the local <b>datum.</b> Moreover, <b>targets</b> have been measured also in captured scans. Some of these have been placed on the dam structure to be used as independent check points, the others in the surroundings to play as ground control point. Three measurement campaigns have been accomplished so far by using two laser scanners: a long range Riegl LMS-Z 420 i and a medium range Leica HDS 3000. Reported analyses are focused on two main problems: the first one is the accuracy and the stability of georeferencing, which is fundamental to make comparisons between different multi-temporal scans; the second one is the computation of deformation based on the acquired point-clouds. 1...|$|R
40|$|In many {{practical}} applications of control theory some {{constraints on the}} state and/or on the control need to be imposed. In this paper, we prove controllability results for semilinear parabolic equations under positivity constraints on the control, when the time horizon is long enough. As we shall see, in fact, the minimal controllability time {{turns out to be}} strictly positive. More precisely, we prove a global steady state constrained controllability result for a semilinear parabolic equation with $C^ 1 $ nonlinearity, without sign or globally Lipschitz assumptions on the nonlinear term. Then, under suitable dissipativity assumptions on the system, we extend the result to any initial <b>datum</b> and any <b>target</b> trajectory. We conclude with some numerical simulations that confirm the theoretical results that provide further information of the sparse structure of constrained controls in minimal time...|$|R
