40|$|Major {{research}} on equity index dynamics has investigated only US indices (usually the S&P 500) and has provided contradictory results. In this paper a clarification and extension of that previous research is given. We find that <b>European</b> equity <b>indices</b> have quite different dynamics from the S&P 500. Each of the <b>European</b> <b>indices</b> considered may be satisfactorily modelled using either an affine model with price and volatility jumps or a GARCH volatility process without jumps.

40|$|A {{neural network}} (NN) based cascade control system is developed, {{in which the}} primary PID {{controller}} is constructed by NN. A new entropy-based measure, named the centred error entropy (<b>CEE)</b> <b>index,</b> which is a weighted combination of the error cross correntropy (ECC) criterion and the error entropy criterion (EEC), is proposed to tune the NN-PID controller. The purpose of introducing CEE in controller design {{is to ensure that}} the uncertainty in the tracking error is minimised and also the peak value of the error probability density function (PDF) being controlled towards zero. The NN-controller design based on this new performance function is developed and the convergent conditions are. During the control process, the <b>CEE</b> <b>index</b> is estimated by a Gaussian kernel function. Adaptive rules are developed to update the kernel size in order to achieve more accurate estimation of the <b>CEE</b> <b>index.</b> This NN cascade control approach is applied to superheated steam temperature control of a simulated power plant system, from which the effectiveness and strength of the proposed strategy are discussed by comparison with NN-PID controllers tuned with EEC and ECC criterions...|$|R
40|$|This paper investigates how {{conventional}} and unconventional monetary policies announcements affect <b>European</b> banking <b>indexes</b> returns through an event-study analysis. We use data of 11 <b>European</b> banking <b>indexes</b> for the periods 1999 - 2015. We examine the state dependency of such effects {{and focus on}} the surprise elements of policy changes derived from the Euribor futures market. Overall, we find a positive relation between the unexpected changes in the ECBs reference rate and <b>European</b> banking <b>indexes</b> returns. We also discover that the effect is stronger during the financial crisis, especially during the sovereign debt crisis. Moreover, we identify a positive relation between the announcements of unconventional policies and the <b>European</b> banking <b>indexes</b> returns, particularly where the banking system was more risky such as Spain, France and Italy but with a low degree of magnitude than expected. Hence, the Euro banks reactions to monetary policies announcements seem to be more relevant through conventional measures with respect to non-conventional ones...|$|R
40|$|Correctly {{specified}} {{models to}} forecast returns of indices {{are important for}} in- vestors to minimize risk on financial markets. This thesis focuses on conditional Value at Risk modeling, employing flexible quantile regression framework and hence avoiding the assumption on the return distribution. We apply semi- parametric linear quantile regression (LQR) models with realized variance and also models with positive and negative semivariance which allows for direct modelling of the quantiles. Four <b>European</b> stock price <b>indices</b> are taken into account: Czech PX, Hungarian BUX, German DAX and London FTSE 100. The objective is to investigate how the use of realized variance influence the VaR accuracy and {{the correlation between the}} Central & Eastern and Western <b>European</b> <b>indices.</b> The main contribution is application of the LQR models for modelling of conditional quantiles and comparison of the correlation between <b>European</b> <b>indices</b> with use of the realized measures. Our results show that linear quantile regression models on one-step-ahead forecast provide better fit and more accurate modelling than classical VaR model with assumption of nor- mally distributed returns. Therefore LQR models with realized variance can be used as accurate tool for investors. Moreover we show that diversification benefits are [...] ...|$|R

40|$|The goal of {{this paper}} was to {{introduce}} some general issues of non-stationarity for practitioners, students and beginning researchers. Using elementary techniques we examined the effect of non-stationary data on the results of regression analysis.

We also demonstrated the problem of spurious regression on a practical example, using closing prices of stock market <b>indices</b> from <b>CEE</b> markets. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the ability of}} twelve different continuous-time two-factor models with mean-reverting stochastic volatility to capture {{the dynamics of the}} S&P 500 and three <b>European</b> equity <b>indices.</b> The stochastic volatility models are the square root variance, GARCH, and log volatility diffusions, and each is augmented with price and volatility jump extensions. Parameter estimation is by Markov Chain Monte Carlo using daily spot index returns from 1987 to 2010. For each index we find that GARCH diffusions augmented with correlated price and volatility jumps outperform other specifications with respect to all the tests we perform. The <b>European</b> <b>indices</b> have similar dynamics, which are relatively easy to capture using several of our specifications, but the S&P 500 index has different dynamics and here the GARCH-jump specification is very clearly superior...|$|R
