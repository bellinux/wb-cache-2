6000|$|The {{manager of}} a theatre {{is a man of}} business. He is not an expert in politics, religion, art, literature, philosophy, or law. He calls in a playwright just as he calls in a doctor, or consults a lawyer, or engages an architect, {{depending}} on the playwright's reputation and past achievements for a satisfactory result. A play by an unknown man may attract him sufficiently to induce him to give that unknown man a trial; but this does not occur often enough to be taken into account: his normal course is to resort to a well-known author and take (mostly with misgiving) what he gets from him. Now this does not cause any anxiety to Mr Forbes Robertson and Sir Herbert Tree, because they are only incidentally managers and men of business: primarily they are highly cultivated artists, quite capable of judging for themselves anything that the most abstruse playwright is likely to put before them, But the plain sailing tradesman who must be taken as the typical manager (for the West end of London is not the whole theatrical world) is by no means equally qualified to judge whether a play is safe from prosecution or not. He may not understand it, may not like it, may not know what the author is driving at, may have no knowledge of the ethical, political, and sectarian controversies which may form the intellectual fabric of the play, and may honestly see nothing but an ordinary [...] "character part" [...] in a stage figure which may be a libellous and unmistakeable caricature of some eminent living person of whom he has never heard. Yet if he produces the play he is legally responsible just as if he had written it himself. Without protection he may find himself in the dock answering a charge of blasphemous libel, seditious libel, obscene libel, or all three together, not to mention the possibility of a private action for <b>defamatory</b> <b>libel.</b> His sole refuge is the opinion of the Examiner of Plays, his sole protection the licence of the Lord Chamberlain. A refusal to license does not hurt him, because he can produce another play: it is the author who suffers. The granting of the licence practically places him above the law; for though it may be legally possible to prosecute a licensed play, nobody ever dreams of doing it. The really responsible person, the Lord Chamberlain, could not be put into the dock; and the manager could not decently be convicted when he could procure in his defence a certificate from the chief officer of the King's household that the play was a proper one.|$|E

While noting that “there may be cases in which taxable income will be judicially found although outside the precise scope of the description already given,” the Board of Tax Appeals concluded that such damages would not be taxable. The Board noted that the injury was “wholly personal and nonpecuniary,” and that the remedy simply attempts to make the individual whole. Thus, even though the payment was “severable” and lead to a demonstrable increase in net wealth, the Board nonetheless concluded that the payment was not income.|$|R

5000|$|In {{terms of}} content, section 2 of the Act (as it became when it {{received}} royal assent on 27 August 1881) {{introduced a new}} defence for newspaper proprietors {{in cases where the}} libel stemmed from a fair, accurate and non-malicious report of a publicly held meeting. This extension of qualified privilege was then [...] "amplified" [...] by the Law of Libel Amendment Act 1888, which in doing so repealed section 2 of the 1881 Act. Repealed at the same time was section 3 ("No prosecution for newspaper libel without fiat of Attorney General"). The Act also benefited newspaper owners insofar as it instituted provisions (section 4, 5 and 6) for the quicker (and hence cheaper) resolution of newspaper libel cases. Contrary to expectations, however, the passage of the Act correlated with an increase, rather than decrease, in the number of <b>defamatory</b> <b>libel</b> (criminal) actions being brought against newspapers.

5000|$|In June 1912 Rev. J. J. Ross (1871-1935), Pastor of the James Street Baptist Church in Hamilton, Ontario, {{published}} and widely distributed a four-page leaflet entitled, Some Facts about the Self-Styled [...] "Pastor" [...] Charles T. Russell (of Millennial Dawn Fame). He alleged that Russell {{was involved in}} questionable business practices, had defrauded his estranged wife, and denounced his qualifications, legitimacy and moral example as a Pastor. Russell in turn sued Ross for <b>defamatory</b> <b>libel</b> on December 2, 1912. After several delays the case came before Police Court Magistrate G. F. Jelfs on March 17, 1913. During cross-examination Russell {{said that he had}} attended public school for seven years, having left when he was about fourteen years of age, after which he received instruction through private tutors. He said that he was versed in Latin terms [...] "to an extent" [...] but did not know Hebrew or Greek, that he had never been ordained by any bishop or minister, and had never attended a theological seminary or any schools of higher learning. The Hamilton and Toronto Ontario newspapers reported the claims made by Ross and provided a brief outline of the court proceedings. They did not refer to any alleged misconduct on the part of Russell. They criticized Ross for having fled Ontario when summoned and not being present during any of the court proceedings.|$|E
