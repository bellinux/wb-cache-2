40|$|Laparoscopic {{small bowel}} {{resection}} {{is a general}} accepted technique for small bowel tumors and diverticulum. However, the laparoscopic approach for intestinal resection for strangulated hernias is still controversial. This video presents {{the case of a}} 49 years old woman admitted for strangulated umbilical hernia. The patient was diagnosed with morbid obesity with a BMI of 51. 3 kg/m 2. A laparoscopic approach was performed; the exploration confirmed the strangulated umbilical hernia containing small bowel. <b>Kelotomy</b> was necessary to reduce the small bowel. Given the ischemic injuries of the herniated small bowel segment, the resection with side-to-side stapled anastomosis was then performed. The hernia sac was also resected. The parietal defect was then closed by conventional non absorbable running suture. The postoperative course was uneventful and the patient was discharged in the 4 th postoperative day. CONCLUSION: Even the laparoscopic small bowel resection for strangulated hernia is controversial the technique is feasible and safe in obese patients and could avoid operative site infection...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: the {{treatment}} of the intestinal obstruction depends on a premature diagnosis, a skilful and opportune- treatment handling. Objective: characterizing the behavior of the morbimortality for intestinal occlusion at Cienfuegos province, in the period from February 1 st, to March 7 th, 2009. Methods: a descriptive follow-up study of cases that comprised all the patients admitted and operated by intestinal occlusion. The analyzed variables were: age, sex, personal and pathological background, classification according to the American Society of Anaesthesiology, pre and trans-operative diagnostic, the surgical procedure, the location of the ward in immediate postoperative, the complementary exams, the time between the time of admission and the time of the operation, direct cause of death, the complications and the patients´ general condition on discharge. Results: the more frequent trans-operative diagnosis: bridles, intestinal tumors and hernias. The more use surgical procedures were: the lyses of bridles, the tranversostomy; the intestinal resection more practiced was the small intestine one; the more used anastomosis was the terminal term, the <b>kelotomy</b> and herniorrhapy. The more frequent complications were unbalance hydroelectrolític and sepsis. The principal fatal causes were: mesenteric thrombosis and disorders for hydroelectrolític unbalance, with predominance of the female sex and patients of 65 years and more. Conclusions: the advances in science, technology and health have contributed in the remission of morbidity and nevertheless, it continues being one of the most tracer pathology of the medical- surgical urgency...|$|E
