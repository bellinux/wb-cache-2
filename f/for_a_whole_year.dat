Although principal photography only took eight to nine months, the production phase continued <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>year</b> starting from 5 February 1950 until 8 February 1951, due to the film being shot simultaneously in Telugu and Tamil. Pasumarthi Krishnamurthy conducted the choreography for the song sequences. Major portions of the film were shot in large sets and many trick shots were used by Bartley during the process. Both versions were filmed using an Arri 11 CBR Camera.|$|E
5|$|The {{effects of}} the {{hurricane}} were most severe on the Florida East Coast Railway, where at least 135 people died, 104 of them on Houseboat No. 4, one of the railway's boats. Many of the workers were swept to sea on barges and flatboats; however, the steamer Jenny rescued 42 workers, who were dropped off at Key West, while another 24 were sent to Savannah, Georgia. The railway's losses totaled about $200,000. Construction was disrupted <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>year</b> by the storm, as equipment was reassembled and repaired. Many farmers on the Florida Keys suffered large losses; orange groves and fields of pineapples were devastated by the storm. Six lives were lost on plantations in the Keys.

5|$|According to Jain {{traditional}} accounts, he {{was born}} to King Nabhi and Queen Marudevi in north Indian city of Ayodhya, also called Vinita. He had two wives, Sunanda and Sumangala. Sumangala is described {{as the mother of}} his ninety-nine sons (including Bharata) and one daughter, Brahmi. Sunanda is depicted as the mother of Bahubali and Sundari. The sudden death of Nilanjana, one of the dancers of Indra, reminded him of the world's transitory nature and he developed a desire for renunciation. After renouncing, the Jain legends state he wandered without food <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>year.</b> The day on which he got his first ahara (food), is celebrated as Akshaya Tritiya by Jains. He is said to have attained Moksha on Mount Kailash. The text Adi Purana by Jinasena is an account of the events of his life. His iconography includes colossal statues such as Statue of Ahimsa, Bawangaja and those erected in Gopachal hill. His icons include the eponymous bull as his emblem, the Nyagrodha tree, Gomukha (bull-faced) Yaksha, and Chakreshvari Yakshi.|$|E
5|$|The Venetians {{returned}} to the Dardanelles in 1648. Despite losing many ships and admiral Grimani himself in a storm in mid-March, reinforcements under Giacomo da Riva brought the Venetian fleet back up to strength (some 65 vessels), and allowed them to successfully blockade the Straits <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>year.</b> The Ottomans countered this in part by building a new fleet at Çeşme, forcing the Venetians to divide their forces, and in 1649, a strengthened Ottoman fleet under Kapudan Pasha Voinok Ahmed broke the blockade. Despite scoring a victory over the Ottoman fleet in its anchorage at Phocaea on 12 May 1649, capturing or destroying several ships, da Riva {{was not able to}} prevent the Ottoman armada from eventually reaching Crete. This highlighted the weakness of the Venetian position: maintaining long blockades with galleys was an inherently difficult task, and the Republic did not have enough ships to control both the Dardanelles and the passage of Chios at the same time. In addition, in a major development, 1648 the Ottomans decided, in a meeting chaired by the Sultan himself, to build and employ galleons in their fleet, instead of relying exclusively on oared galleys as hitherto.|$|E

40|$|By {{means of}} group {{contributions}} the legislator {{has made it}} easier for company groups to transfer profits from a parent company to a subsidiary. A parent company can choose to reconstruct by acquire a company, create a subsidiary or perform a partial fission. The choice can affect the possibility <b>for</b> <b>a</b> parent company to perform a group contribution with deduction right. The parent company has to own more than 90 percent of the subsidiary’s shares <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> taxation <b>year</b> or since the subsidiary began to carry out any economic activity in order to perform group contributions with deduction right. If a subsidiary is acquired, it has to be owned <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> taxation <b>year</b> before group contributions with deduction right can be made, unless the acquired company never has carried out any economic activity before. When a parent company creates a subsidiary group contributions can be made with deduction right instantly after the reconstruction. If a partial fission is made to a subsidiary which has not been owned <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> taxation <b>year</b> <b>a</b> group contribution cannot be made with deduction right. Where a partial fission is made to a subsidiary created by the parent company, to a subsidiary which has never carried out any economic activity or to a subsidiary which has been owned <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> taxation <b>year</b> <b>a</b> group contribution can be made with deduction right instantly after the reconstruction. The difference in treatment regarding the deduction right is not an effect of differences between the reconstruction methods. Since the decisive term is whether the subsidiary has carried out any economic activity before, the difference is an effect of differences regarding the subsidiaries. Since this rule is applied in the same manner to all companies regardless of where the company’s permanent abode is located this difference is not a violation of the freedom of establishment...|$|R

25|$|Hyperbolas {{may be seen}} in many sundials. On {{any given}} day, the sun {{revolves}} in a circle on the celestial sphere, and its rays striking the point on a sundial traces out a cone of light. The intersection of this cone with the horizontal plane of the ground forms a conic section. At most populated latitudes and at most times of the year, this conic section is a hyperbola. In practical terms, the shadow of the tip of a pole traces out a hyperbola on the ground {{over the course of a}} day (this path is called the declination line). The shape of this hyperbola varies with the geographical latitude and with the time of the year, since those factors affect the cone of the sun's rays relative to the horizon. The collection of such hyperbolas <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>year</b> at a given location was called a pelekinon by the Greeks, since it resembles a double-bladed axe.|$|E

In Spain, where the mushroom is esteemed as a culinary delicacy in Catalan cuisine, it is known as níscalos (in Spanish) or rovelló (in Catalan). In Cyprus, it is known as γαιματάς (meaning [...] "the bloody one") and it is widely collected by the locals, but considered inferior to the saffron milk cap (Lactarius deliciosus).
