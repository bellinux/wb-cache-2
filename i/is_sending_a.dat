This is considered an important safety feature, as the surface team can monitor the diver's breathing sounds, which can give early warning of problems developing, and confirms that the diver is alive.|$|E

Kröd insists the group is safe there, but is surprised when innkeeper Hugo (Dominic Coleman) tries to poison him for reward money, as Dongalor is offering a substantial reward for Krod and Aneka, dead or alive. An angry mob arrives to try to capture the pair and Hugo threatens to burn the stronghold down. But when his two wives arrive and meet each other, a fearful Hugo risks his life to help Kröd and his friends escape. Meanwhile, the evil Chancellor Dongalor (Matt Lucas) learns {{at a press conference}} that the Emperor Xanus <b>is</b> <b>sending</b> <b>a</b> weapons inspector to investigate his castle.

"Dear Sir--As my Mother <b>is</b> <b>sending</b> <b>a</b> Messenger to Esher, I cannot but [...] {{make the}} same the bearer of my regrets for not having had the [...] {{pleasure}} of seeing you the morning you called at the gate. I had [...] given orders to be denied, I was so very unwell with my still [...] adhesive cold; but had I known it was you I should have taken off the [...] interdict for a few minutes, to say how very much I am delighted with [...] Endymion. I had just finished the Poem and have done as you [...] permitted, lent it to Miss Fitzgerald. I regret you are not [...] personally acquainted with the Author, for I should have been happy [...] to have acknowledged to him, through the advantage of your [...] communication, the very rare delight my sister and myself have [...] enjoyed from the first fruits of Genius.

6000|$|I said [...] "minuteness" [...] and [...] "selfishness" [...] of sensation, but {{it would}} have been enough to have said [...] "injustice" [...] or [...] "unrighteousness" [...] of sensation. For as in nothing is a gentleman better to be discerned from a vulgar person, so in nothing is a gentle nation (such nations have been) better to be discerned from a mob, than in this,--that their {{feelings}} are constant and just, results of due contemplation, and of equal thought. You can talk a mob into anything; its feelings may be--usually are--on the whole, generous and right; but it has no foundation for them, no hold of them; you may tease or tickle it into any, at your pleasure; it thinks by infection, for the most part, catching an opinion like a cold, and there is nothing so little that it will not roar itself wild about, when the fit is on;--nothing so great but it will forget in an hour, when the fit is past. But a gentleman's, or a gentle nation's, passions are just, measured, and continuous. A great nation, for instance, does not spend its entire national wits for a couple of months in weighing evidence of a single ruffian's having done a single murder; and for a couple of years see its own children murder each other by their thousands or tens of thousands a day, considering only what the effect is likely to be on the price of cotton, and caring no wise to determine which side of battle is in the wrong. Neither does a great nation send its poor little boys to jail for stealing six walnuts; and allow its bankrupts to steal their hundreds of thousands with a bow, and its bankers, rich with poor men's savings, to close their doors [...] "under circumstances over which they have no control," [...] with a [...] "by your leave;" [...] and large landed estates to be bought by men who have made their money by going with armed steamers up and down the China Seas, selling opium at the cannon's mouth, and altering, for the benefit of the foreign nation, the common highwayman's demand of [...] "your money OR your life," [...] into that of [...] "your money AND your life." [...] Neither does a great nation allow the lives of its innocent poor to be parched out of them by fog fever, and rotted out of them by dunghill plague, for the sake of sixpence a life extra per week to its landlords; {11} and then debate, with drivelling tears, and diabolical sympathies, whether it ought not piously to save, and nursingly cherish, the lives of its murderers. Also, a great nation having made up its mind that hanging is quite the wholesomest process for its homicides in general, can yet with mercy distinguish between the degrees of guilt in homicides; and does not yelp like a pack of frost-pinched wolf-cubs on the blood- track of an unhappy crazed boy, or grey-haired clodpate Othello, [...] "perplexed i' the extreme," [...] at the very moment that it <b>is</b> <b>sending</b> <b>a</b> Minister of the Crown to make polite speeches to a man who is bayoneting young girls in their fathers' sight, and killing noble youths in cool blood, faster than a country butcher kills lambs in spring. And, lastly, a great nation does not mock Heaven and its Powers, by pretending belief in a revelation which asserts the love of money to be the root of ALL evil, and declaring, at the same time, that it is actuated, and intends to be actuated, in all chief national deeds and measures, by no other love. {12} ...|$|E
