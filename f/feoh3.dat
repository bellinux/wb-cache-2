50|$|Several {{hydrates}} of Iron(III) oxide exists.When alkali {{is added}} to solutions of soluble Fe(III) salts, a red-brown gelatinous precipitate forms. This is not <b>Fe(OH)3,</b> but Fe2O3·H2O (also written as Fe(O)OH).Several forms of the hydrated oxide of Fe(III) exist as well. The red lepidocrocite γ-Fe(O)OH, occurs {{on the outside of}} rusticles, and the orange goethite, which occurs internally in rusticles.When Fe2O3·H2O is heated, it loses its water of hydration. Further heating at 1670 K converts Fe2O3 to black Fe3O4 (FeIIFeIII2O4), which is known as the mineral magnetite.Fe(O)OH is soluble in acids, giving Fe(OH2)63+. In concentrated aqueous alkali, Fe2O3 gives Fe(OH)63−.|$|E
5000|$|Hydrobromic acid {{used as an}} {{electrolyte}} {{has been}} replaced with a far less toxic alkaline solution (1M KOH) and ferrocyanide. The higher pH is less corrosive, allowing the use of inexpensive polymer tanks. The increased electrical resistance in the membrane was compensated by increasing the voltage. The cell voltage was 1.2 V. The cell's efficiency exceeded 99%, while round-trip efficiency measured 84%. The battery has an expected lifetime of at least 1,000 cycles. Its theoretic energy density was 19 Wh per liter. [...] Ferrocyanide's chemically stability in high pH KOH solution without forming Fe(OH)2 or <b>Fe(OH)3</b> needs to be verified before scale-up.|$|E
50|$|Richard Slee was {{a member}} of the Geological Sub-Committee of the Scientific Society of Broken Hill, and was {{instrumental}} in the discovery of a new mineral, bernalite, <b>Fe(OH)3,</b> though he never knew of this achievement. Around 1921 he noticed a strange mineral in the upper level workings of the B.H.P. mine. Containing dark green octahedral crystals on concretionary goethite and coronadite, he passed specimens on to the noted geologist Frank Leslie Stillwell (1888-1963) for investigation. In 1927 Stillwell incorrectly concluded they were known minerals. The specimens remained unnoticed in the Department of Geology at the University of Melbourne until 1990 when they were re-examined by scientists. It was then realised they were a new and unknown mineral, being named bernalite in honour of eminent crystallographer and science historian John Desmond Bernal (1901-1971).|$|E
5000|$|Sesquioxide clays are {{a product}} of heavy {{rainfall}} that has leached most of the silica from alumino-silica clay, leaving the less soluble oxides iron hematite (Fe2O3), iron hydroxide (<b>Fe(OH)3),</b> aluminium hydroxide gibbsite (Al(OH)3), hydrated manganese birnessite (MnO2). It takes {{hundreds of thousands of}} years of leaching to create sesquioxide clays. Sesqui is Latin for [...] "one and one-half": there are three parts oxygen to two parts iron or aluminium; hence the ratio is one and one-half (not true for all). They are hydrated and act as either amorphous or crystalline. They are not sticky and do not swell, and soils high in them behave much like sand and can rapidly pass water. They are able to hold large quantities of phosphates. Sesquioxides have low CEC but are able to hold anions as well as cations. Such soils range from yellow to red in colour. Such clays tend to hold phosphorus so tightly that it is unavailable for absorption by plants.|$|E
50|$|If a {{solution}} containing both green ferrioxalate ions and colourless free oxalate ions {{is exposed to}} strong light, such as direct sunlight, the light allows the Iron-III to oxidize one of the oxalate ligands to carbon dioxide and gives the orange-brown ferrooxalate complex ion which is coordinated around an Iron-II centre, however, when placed in the dark the Iron-II is re-oxidized to Iron-III by the oxygen in the atmosphere and the green ferrioxalate complex ion re-forms. The orange-brown Iron-II complex starts to appear after around ten minutes exposure and {{after the passage of}} a few hours in direct sunlight {{more than half of the}} green Iron-III complex had been reduced. The re-oxidation in the dark is equally slow and observable under ambient electric lighting. If this process is allowed to repeat over many months, such as leaving a container outside where it is exposed to the sun each day, eventually almost all of the oxalate ions present are oxidized to carbonate and the iron remains as Ferric Hydroxide, <b>Fe(OH)3.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The ferrate(VI) ion has two {{unpaired}} electrons, {{and is thus}} paramagnetic. It has a tetrahedral molecular geometry.Fe (VI) is {{a strong}} oxidizing agent over the entire pH range, with a reduction potential (Fe(VI)/Fe(III) couple) varying from +2.2 V to +0.7 V versus NHE in acidic and basic media respectively. Sodium ferrate (Na2FeO4)is a useful reagent with good selectivity and is stable in aqueous solution of high pH, remaining soluble in an aqueous solution saturated with sodium hydroxide. Iron usually exists in the +2 and +3 oxidation states; however, in a strong oxidizing environment, higher oxidation states of iron such as +4, +5 and +6 can also be obtained.Ferrate {{is one of the}} most powerful, yet environmentally friendly, water treatment chemicals known. The byproduct of ferrate oxidation is the relatively benign iron (III), or ferric oxide. Fe (III) occurs naturally in the human body and plant and animal forms. Ferrate is a tetrahedral ion isostructural with the chromate and permanganate ions.

5000|$|The {{amphoteric}} hydroxide Al(OH)3 {{has four}} major crystalline forms: gibbsite (most stable), bayerite, nordstrandite and doyleite.All these polymorphs are built up of double layers of hydroxide ions - the aluminium atoms on {{two-thirds of the}} octahedral holes between the two layers - and differ only in the stacking sequence of the layers. The structures {{are similar to the}} brucite structure. However, whereas the brucite structure can be described as a close-packed structure in gibbsite the OH groups on the underside of one layer rest on the groups of the layer below. This arrangement led to the suggestion that there are directional bonds between OH groups in adjacent layers. This is an unusual form of hydrogen bonding since the two hydroxide ion involved would be expected to point away from each other. The hydrogen atoms have been located by neutron diffraction experiments on α-AlO(OH) (diaspore). The O-H-O distance is very short, at 265 pm; the hydrogen is not equidistant between the oxygen atoms and the short OH bond makes an angle of 12° with the O-O line. A similar type of hydrogen bond has been proposed for other amphoteric hydroxides, including Be(OH)2, Zn(OH)2 and <b>Fe(OH)3</b> ...|$|E
