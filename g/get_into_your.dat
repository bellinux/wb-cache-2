25|$|There is, however, a {{good way}} of using this {{instrument}} to get what you want, and that is to perform the whole operation in a consecrated circle, so that undesirable aliens cannot interfere with it. You should then employ the proper magical invocation in order to <b>get</b> <b>into</b> <b>your</b> circle just the one spirit you want. It is comparatively easy to do this. A few simple instructions are all that is necessary, and I shall be pleased to give these, free of charge, to any one who cares to apply.|$|E
500|$|To {{prepare for}} the role, Collins read the Book of Revelation. As well, Collins has said he {{somewhat}} based his character around his younger brother, who has something [...] "angelic about him", as he [...] "has this way of, very calmly, just staring into someone's eyes" [...] making one feel [...] "like he can <b>get</b> <b>into</b> <b>your</b> soul." [...] To avoid the biblically toned dialogue from sounding too [...] "campy", Collins does his best to [...] "play it as real as possible". Because Castiel's true voice shattered windows in his premiere episode, Collins decided to use a [...] "gruff, resonant voice" [...] for the character. However, when portraying the angel's host Jimmy Novak, he tried to create {{a distinction between the}} two characters, providing different physical and personality traits, as well as using a [...] "more boyish kind of sound" [...] for Jimmy's voice.|$|E
500|$|Upon {{its initial}} release, the song {{received}} mixed reviews from music critics. UKMIX described the song as [...] "quite blissful {{with a smooth}} vocal delivery and some pretty nice lyrics," [...] but despite {{not being able to}} fault the song, the reviewer was unsure that the song was the right choice for the Eurovision Song Contest and predicted that Tyler would suffer the same criticism that Engelbert Humperdinck received the previous year. Robert Copsey from Digital Spy gave the song two stars out of five, stating that the song is a [...] "polar opposite to the slew of Euro-club bangers entering this year's contest," [...] but applaud Tyler for entering the Eurovision Song Contest with the contrasting song. The Guardian held a poll on their website asking the public if they expected Tyler to be successful at Eurovision. The results were fairly even with 46% predicting that Tyler would win and 54% voting that they didn't expect Tyler to win. Ann Gripper from the Daily Mirror described the song as [...] "heartfelt," [...] and {{went on to say that}} Tyler [...] "can still sing." [...] She criticised the songwriters' choice of [...] "above" [...] and [...] "stuff" [...] as the first rhyming lyrics, but noted the line [...] "you never see the rainbow, you just curse the rain" [...] as an improvement, and an opportunity to [...] "have some fun with the staging on finals night in Malmo." [...] Gripper concluded by saying that it [...] "doesn't <b>get</b> <b>into</b> <b>your</b> head like (2012 Sweden winning song) [...] "Euphoria"," [...] and stated that unless the staging is [...] "spectacular", the song won't be remembered by voting time.|$|E
