40|$|<b>Interface</b> <b>adapters</b> allow {{applications}} {{written for}} one interface {{to be reused}} with another interface without having to rewrite application code, and chaining <b>interface</b> <b>adapters</b> can significantly reduce the development effort required to create the <b>adapters.</b> However, <b>interface</b> <b>adapters</b> will often be unable to convert interfaces perfectly, so {{there must be a}} way to analyze the loss from <b>interface</b> <b>adapter</b> chains in order {{to improve the quality of}} interface adaptation. This paper describes a probabilistic approach to analyzing loss in <b>interface</b> <b>adapter</b> chains, which not only models whether a method can be adapted but also how well methods can be adapted. We also show that probabilistic optimal adapter chaining is an NP-complete problem, so we describe a greedy algorithm which can construct an optimal <b>interface</b> <b>adapter</b> chain with exponential time in the worst case.

40|$|By using {{different}} <b>interface</b> <b>adapters</b> for different methods, {{it is possible}} to construct a maximally covering web of <b>interface</b> <b>adapters</b> which incurs minimum loss during interface adaptation. We introduce a polynomial-time algorithm that can achieve this. However, we also show that minimizing the number of adapters included in a maximally covering web of <b>interface</b> <b>adapters</b> is an NP-complete problem. Comment: 7 page...|$|R

40|$|Despite {{providing}} similar functionality, multiple {{network services}} may {{require the use}} of different interfaces to access the functionality, and this problem will only get worse with the widespread deployment of ubiquitous computing environments. One way around this problem is to use <b>interface</b> <b>adapters</b> that adapt one interface into another. Chaining these <b>adapters</b> allows flexible <b>interface</b> adaptation with fewer adapters, but the loss incurred due to imperfect interface adaptation must be considered. This paper outlines a mathematical basis for analyzing the chaining of lossy <b>interface</b> <b>adapters.</b> We also show that the problem of finding an optimal <b>interface</b> <b>adapter</b> chain is NP-complete.

FORTE, the Fast On-Orbit Recording of Transient Events small {{satellite}} {{designed and}} built by Los Alamos and Sandia National Laboratories, is scheduled for launch in August, 1997.

Because the receiver and trigger sub-systems employed complex functions for signal discrimination and transient detection, thorough validation of all functions and illumination of any faults were priorities.

40|$|A {{universal}} <b>interface</b> <b>adapter</b> circuit <b>interfaces,</b> for example, {{a wireless}} communications headset with {{any type of}} communications system, including those that require push-to-talk (PTT) signaling. The <b>interface</b> <b>adapter</b> is comprised of several main components, including an RF signaling receiver, a microcontroller and associated circuitry for decoding and processing the received signals, and programmable impedance matching and line interfacing circuitry for interfacing a wireless communications headset system base to a communications system. A signaling transmitter, which is preferably portable (e. g., handheld), is employed by the wireless headset user to send signals to the signaling receiver. In an {{embodiment of the invention}} directed specifically to push-to-talk (PTT) signaling, the wireless headset user presses a button on the signaling transmitter when they wish to speak. This sends a signal to the microcontroller which decodes the signal and recognizes the signal as being a PTT request. In response, the microcontroller generates a control signal that closes a switch to complete a voice connection between the headset system base and the communications system so that the user can communicate with the communications system. With this arrangement, the wireless headset can be interfaced to any communications system that requires PTT signaling, without modification of the headset device. In addition, the <b>interface</b> <b>adapter</b> can also be configured to respond to or deliver any other types of signals, such as dual-tone-multiple-frequency (DTMF) tones, and on/off hook signals. The present invention is also scalable, and permits multiple wireless users to operate independently in the same environment through use of a plurality of the <b>interface</b> <b>adapters...</b>|$|R
