500|$|Consistent with Bolkovac's account, The Whistleblower portrays DynCorp International {{employees}} {{as participants in}} the postwar Bosnian sex trade with the UN turning a blind eye. UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon hosted a screening of the film and promised action would be taken to prevent further instances of human trafficking. Bolkovac responded, [...] "Unfortunately, the widespread horror is already there. This {{is not going to}} be simple or a quick fix." [...] She said that in addition to Bosnia, peacekeepers had violated human rights in Nigeria, Kosovo, Burundi, Sierra Leone, the Congo, Liberia, Cambodia, Iraq, Afghanistan, Haiti, Colombia, Guinea and Sudan. Kondracki added that while she wanted to be optimistic and hoped that the screening would [...] "lead to genuine discussion and thought about the UN's involvement in sex trafficking and other crimes", she worried that it might not have the desired lasting impact: [...] "I know we are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>a</b> lot about what has been done since the time depicted in this film, but rhetoric only goes so far. The situation has escalated." [...] Following the theatrical release of The Whistleblower, The Guardian reported that other UN officials attempted to downplay the events depicted and that initiatives against trafficking in Bosnia were aborted.|$|E

It seemed to Sidonia that he had never listened to a voice more rich and passionate, to an elocution more complete; he gazed with admiration on her lightning glance and all the tumult of her noble brow.

5000|$|A person's {{specific}} {{rights and duties}} depend on the federal statute involved, but here is an outline of how the doctrine works in practice.

40|$|Equity theory {{argues that}} workers examine their job {{performance}} and salaries relative to workers in comparable situations.

50|$|Other than in some cathedrals {{and college}} chapels, usually only one psalm is said or sung.

5000|$|Kesha {{has said}} the songs are {{inspired}} by her experiences during her tours. In contrast to her first record which featured music described by the singer as [...] "very brash and very sassy and very unapologetic and irreverent", she says the second album makes a lyrical departure and explores a more vulnerable side in its lyrics. She explained: [...] "I have learned {{over the past three}} years of doing this that being vulnerable doesn't mean you're weak. I very much want to be seen as a strong woman, but I realize that vulnerability can also be a strength. So on my next record, you are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> probably <b>a</b> little more of that." [...] Kesha commented, in an interview with Rolling Stone, [...] "The first two records talked more about partying, which is a great, magical part of life, but some songs on the new record are more personal and vulnerable. And you can hear more of the music I listen to when I'm lying in my bed. I'm not claiming that it's a rock record - but as long as it's fucking good, you can call it whatever you want." [...] Co-written by her mother, Pebe Sebert, the song titled [...] "Gold Trans Am" [...] doubles as a metaphor for her vagina and alludes to her actual automobile. Of the song, Kesha said: [...] "It began as a song about my car, which is a gold Trans Am, and it works about 40 per cent of the time. I don't have another car because I love that one so much. But then like all great pop it became a metaphor for something else - my pussy." ...|$|R

[...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine with Allmusic said that [...] "The brilliance of Van Lear Rose is not just how the two approaches complement each other, but how the record captures the essence of Loretta Lynn's music even as it has flourishes that are distinctly Jack."Rhapsody ranked the album #16 on its [...] "Country’s Best Albums of the Decade" [...] list. [...] "Jack White, of the bizarre and bluesy duo the White Stripes, produced this effort to jaw-dropping effect. Van Lear Rose is a stripped-down effort that isn't afraid to get dirty -- both in its dark subject matter and in its raucous, gritty tones. And as much as this body of work highlights Lynn's down-home vocals (which are as strong as ever), it's White's production that sends her crashing -- literally -- into the 21st century. On paper, these two disparate souls have little in common, but the bold excitement of the music proves the two are a match made in heaven." ...|$|R

40|$|I {{have heard}} that there is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be <b>a</b> <b>hearing</b> on March 16 - 19 in Augusta to discuss the {{possibility}} of a new Nuclear utility site on the Savanna River. My understanding is that the proposed Nuclear reactors would require millions of gallons of water per day to be pulled from the Savannah River at this location. And that would be in addition to the millions of gallons that are already being pulled by the Vogtle utility. Water has become a precious commodity in this area due to recent drought conditions. This river basin is downstream from Lake Hartwell and Lake Keowee which are both already at extremely low levels. Water Utilities in both Georgia and South Carolina have {{over the last few years}} imposed mandatory water restrictions in various areas that impact the water flow in the Savanna river basin. This facility would not only affect water requirements in this area it would also increase downstream water temperatures, which could negatively impact fisheries and the livelihood of fishermen. Please reconsider {{the possibility of a}}dding an additional drain on the water resources-of this already parched region. There are other ways to produce energy that don't require the volumes of water that this facility would require. Thank you...|$|R
