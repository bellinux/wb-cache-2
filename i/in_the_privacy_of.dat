5|$|The format {{remained}} largely unchanged from previous series. Housemates were incarcerated in the Big Brother House with no contact {{to and from}} the outside world. Each week, the housemates took part in a compulsory task that determined the amount of money they were allocated to spend on their shopping; if they passed, they received a luxury budget and they were allocated a basic budget if they failed. Housemates were instructed to nominate two fellow housemates for eviction each week. This compulsory vote was conducted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>privacy</b> <b>of</b> the Diary Room and housemates were not allowed to discuss the nomination process or influence the nominations of others. On Day 68, Big Brother changed the rules to allow housemates to discuss nominations until further notice. The two or more housemates who gathered the most nominations per week faced a public vote and the housemate receiving the most votes was evicted from the House on the Friday and interviewed by Davina McCall. Housemates could voluntarily leave the House at any time and those who broke the rules could have been ejected by Big Brother.|$|E
25|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>privacy</b> <b>of</b> {{their own}} homes, {{people are more}} casual in {{relation}} to clothing, though what each considers appropriate varies considerably. What and how much clothing a person removes depends {{on a number of}} considerations, including the cultural background and on whether the person is alone <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>privacy</b> <b>of</b> their own homes. The removal of overclothing, such as coats, hats, gloves, scarves and the like, is the norm in virtually all households. It is also common for people to remove outdoor shoes when entering one's home and at times guests may also be expected to do the same. It is also common to change out of work clothes (such as a suit and tie, overalls etc.) into something lighter, looser and more comfortable, and perhaps for a woman to remove her bra or stockings. Beyond that, how much more is removed depends on personal taste, habits, circumstance and relationships of the people inside the household at a particular time.|$|E
25|$|Many {{people are}} often nude <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>privacy</b> <b>of</b> their home or garden, either alone or {{with members of the}} family; naturists {{normally}} refer to them as at-home-nudists or closet-nudists. This may be occasional nudity or as a naturist lifestyle. There are differences of opinion as to whether, and if so to what extent, parents should appear naked in front of their children, and whether children should be nude within the home in the view of their family as well as visitors. This has attracted a great deal of academic study.|$|E

25|$|In a {{dramatic}} case of situational irony, {{a room at}} the Salon d'Automne was dedicated to Picasso in 1944. During the crucial years of Cubism, between 1909 and 1914, the dealer Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler forbade Braque and Picasso from exhibiting at both the Salon d'Automne and the Salon des Indépendants. He thought the salons were places of humor and ribaldry, of jokes, laughter and ridicule. Fearing that Cubism would not be taken seriously in such public exhibitions where thousands of spectators would assemble to see new creations, he signed exclusivity contracts with his artists, ensuring that their works could only be shown (and sold) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>privacy</b> <b>of</b> his own gallery.|$|E

25|$|Ironically, while life upstairs {{away from}} the {{servants}} now became more relaxed with less ceremony, life downstairs became a parody of the former world upstairs. Butlers, housekeepers and cooks now became monarchs in their own small kingdoms. A strict hierarchy among the servants developed which persisted in the grander households until the 20th century. The upper servants in large households would often withdraw from the servants' hall to eat their dessert courses <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>privacy</b> <b>of</b> a Steward's Room {{in much the same}} way the owners of the house had withdrawn to a solar from the Great Hall in the previous era.

25|$|Many people regard visible tan {{lines as}} un-aesthetic, {{and seek to}} avoid tan lines that will be visible when regular clothes are worn. Some people try to achieve an all-over tan or to {{maximize}} their tan coverage. To achieve an all-over tan, tanners need to minimize the amount of clothing they wear while tanning. For women who cannot dispense with a swimsuit, they at times tan with the back strap undone while lying on the front, or removing shoulder straps, besides wearing swimsuits which cover less area than their normal clothing. Any exposure is subject to local community standards and personal choice. Some people tan <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>privacy</b> <b>of</b> their backyard where they can at times tan without clothes, and some countries have set aside clothing-optional swimming areas (popularly known as nude beaches), where people can tan and swim clothes-free. Some people tan topless, and others wear very brief swimwear, such as a microkini or thong.|$|E
25|$|On January 20, 2005, District Court Judge Gary L. Lancaster {{dropped the}} charges, agreeing {{with the defense}} that the federal anti-obscenity {{statutes}} were unconstitutional, as they violated a person's fundamental right to possess and view whatever they want <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>privacy</b> <b>of</b> their own home. As a fundamental right had been violated, the government had to establish that a compelling state interest was involved. The prosecution argued {{that the government had}} a legitimate interest in protecting adults from unwitting exposure to obscenity, and protecting children from exposure to obscenity. These arguments were rejected by the court, which also ruled that the federal obscenity laws were not narrow enough to meet these interests, and could not justify a complete ban on obscene material. Lancaster ruled that children and unwitting adults are protected from the content because the website requires a credit card to join, and because software is available by which parents can restrict children's access to Internet pornography. The court did agree with the government that Lawrence had not created a new broad fundamental right to engage in any private sexual conduct. Instead the court relied on Stanley, which had established there was a fundamental right to private possession of obscene material. The court did rely on Lawrence for its assertion that the government could not use public morality as a legitimate state interest which justified the infringement of consensual, adult, private sexual conduct. The court also made reference to the dissenting opinion of Justice Scalia, who said that Lawrence had questioned the validity of U.S. obscenity laws, since the government could not enforce a moral code of conduct. Judge Lancaster also cited numerous constitutional scholars who had observed that the Lawrence ruling calls federal obscenity laws into question.|$|E

His education at St. Clement Danes Grammar School overlapped, from 1910, with a scholarship at Trinity College of Music. As a Trinity student, he made his concert debut in a cello concerto in the Queen's Hall in 1911. The following year he won a scholarship to the Royal Academy of Music, which he attended from 1912 to 1916, studying harmony, counterpoint and theory under Dr. J. B. McEwen and the cello with Herbert Walenn. In 1914 he was joint winner of the academy's Charles Rube Prize for ensemble playing, and in 1916 The Musical Times singled him out as [...] "that excellent young 'cello player, Mr Giovanni Barbirolli." [...] The principal of the Academy, Sir Alexander Mackenzie, had forbidden students to play the chamber music of Ravel, which he regarded as [...] "a pernicious influence".
