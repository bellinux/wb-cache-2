40|$|SAPO- 11 zeolites were {{successfully}} synthesized by using three different templates (diethylamine (DEA), di-n-propylamine (DPA) and <b>di-isopropylamine</b> (DIPA)) and varying DPA contents (nDPA/Al 2 O 3 = 0. 8, 1. 2, 1. 6 and 2. 0) under hydrothermal conditions. The samples {{were characterized by}} powder X-ray diffractometry (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), N 2 adsorption-desorption, temperature programmed desorption of ammonia (NH 3 -TPD) and 29 Si magic angle spinning (MAS) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). The samples were also evaluated towards the methylation of naphthalene with methanol to produce 2, 6 -dimethylnaphthalene (2, 6 -DMN). XRD {{results indicated that the}} directing effect of the different templates for AEL (Aluminophosphate-ELeven) structure decreased in the order DPA > DEA > DIPA and the most suitable DPA content was nDPA/Al 2 O 3 = 1. 2. N 2 adsorption-desorption results showed that SAPO- 11 (DPA, 1. 2) exhibited the broadest pore size distribution, the highest BET specific surface area and the largest pore volume among all the SAPO- 11 samples. SAPO- 11 (DPA, 1. 2) exhibited high catalytic performances in the methylation of naphthalene due to its high crystallinity, high external surface and broad pore size distribution. The pore structure of SAPO- 11 zeolite, rather than its acidity, {{played an important role in}} achieving high catalytic performances in the methylation of naphthalene with methanol...|$|E
