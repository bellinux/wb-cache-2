50|$|In 1336, Mannebach had {{its first}} {{documentary}} mention when the Count of Virneburg sold Archbishop Balduin of Trier his castle for 2,200 Gulden, {{only to have}} the Archbishop enfeoff him with the same, while exacting a yearly tribute of 220 Gulden from the Count, which the Count paid the Archbishop mostly in produce, which, of course, the Count in turn exacted from the peasants who worked his fief. Mannebach’s contribution to this was 29 Malter - roughly 2 700 kg - of <b>feed</b> <b>oats.</b> Mannebach was an important place in the County of Virneburg. It belonged to the so-called Upper County and was a mayoral seat. This “mayor”, however, bore the title Heimbürger, which was given a man who had actually been chosen by the community, not by the Count. This one led not only Mannebach, but also Bereborn and Kolverath. It can therefore be inferred that the 29 Malter of <b>feed</b> <b>oats</b> that Mannebach owed the Count of Virneburg each year was actually drawn from all three villages, although this is unconfirmed.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the effects of <b>feeding</b> <b>oats</b> alone before or after feeding chopped alfalfa or, in admixture with the alfalfa on the glycaemic and insulinaemic responses of horses as well as post-prandial breath hydrogen and methane excretion. Horses were fed in a randomized order, chopped alfalfa as a source of dietary fibre and unprocessed oats as a source of starch. Chopped alfalfa intake was adjusted to a crude fibre intake of 0. 5 g/kg bodyweight (BW) per meal and the oats intake was adjusted to a starch intake of 2 g/kg BW per meal. The feeds were offered in three different ways: (i) alfalfa followed by oats (A/O), (ii) oats followed by alfalfa (O/A) or (iii) a mixture of alfalfa and oats (A + O). Oats alone were used as a control. Blood and breath were collected after the test meal was fed at the end of a 11. 5 -h overnight fast following a 10 -day acclimatization period. The highest glycaemic and insulinaemic responses were measured when the A/O and O/A diets orders were fed, whereas most hydrogen was produced after <b>feeding</b> <b>oats</b> alone. It was concluded that adding alfalfa chaff to a meal of oats prolonged the pre-caecal digestion of starch, but there was no evidence for any effect on pre-caecal starch digestibility...|$|R

One other dietary treatment was oats straw supplemented with lablab. Sheep on the hay-lablab diet, compared with the straw-lablab diet, had higher intake, growth rate, digestibilities of DM, OM and microbial N supply, but both diets had similar N retention. Intake of oats hay tended to be depressed by supplementation, but the depression was more pronounced with lablab and tagasaste. Supplementation increased total intake of DM, body weight (BW) gain, but not microbial N supply.

Acreage has declined steadily, however, and in 1990 there were just 300, 000 acres. Oats are grown throughout the state, with the majority being in eastern Nebraska where the cool, moist climate provides for the best growth. The feed value of oats also favors its production in northeast Nebraska where swine, dairy cattle, and beef cattle production are heavy.

The Stern review 2006 identified that agriculture accounted for ~ 14 % of GHG with an additional 18 % of emissions due to deforestation to provide more agricultural land.

40|$|Among {{farmers in}} Sweden hedging of product prices is a {{relatively}} new way of thinking. A deregulated market and a more volatile price picture are consequences of the free market and the movements towards globalization. The effects of globalization are largely a demand- and supply driven market. These factors give the farmers incentives to stay informed and to act on their own in order to manage their price risk exposure. The overall purpose with this study is to analyze the farmers’ attitudes and awareness of price hedging and to examine what type of decision processes that characterize hedging decisions. The study covers the period 2006 until 2008 and the crops oil seeds, barley (malt), milling wheat, feed wheat, oats and <b>feed</b> <b>oats.</b> To collect the information needed about farmers’ attitudes towards price hedging, price risk management and the process behind a decision 13 in-depth interviews were carried out. During these interviews information about actual hedging decisions and their results were collected as well. The actual results were compared with a tentative optimal full information perfect foresight scenario. The study shows that farmers’ way of dealing with a hedging decision mainly depends on if they are considered as analytical or intuitive individuals. Most of the farmers describe themselves as intuitive. However, this study establishes the fact that the larger the farm/ company the more analytical ability is required to make well grounded decisions {{and to be able to}} develop the company. The farmers’ attitudes towards price hedging are mainly positive but the way of thinking around price hedging decisions is considered as new and relatively difficult. To be able to use the available hedging tools in the best possible way many farmers want more information and education in order to manage their future price risk exposure. A comparison between the actual hedging decisions and the optimal scenario establishes that farmers in this study on average perform 14, 59 % less well than the optimal scenario. This result shows how difficult it is to interpret market signals, the unpredictability of the market and how hard it is to actually know when it is the right time to establish a price hedge...|$|E

40|$|Sweet itch in horses is {{a common}} disease of great {{economic}} and clinical importance. The {{aim of this study}} was to examine the influence of epidemiological- and management-related factors on the clinical signs of sweet itch in a multi equine racial, Germany-wide investigation. Furthermore, the aim was to find the best method of treatment. First, a survey was conducted using questionnaires. There was a return of 404 evaluable records. Those factors meant to have an effect on the incidence of sweet itch in horses, were then statistically analyzed using univariate and bivariate methods. The most common distributionbased test methods such as the t-test and F-test were utilized, as well as the chi-square test (χ²) test and the regression analysis. The results of the present study show that compared to stallions, geldings were most affected by sweet itch, as they showed the strongest symptoms (p 0. 05). The analysis of the feeding has shown that horses fed with concentrated <b>feed</b> (<b>oats</b> and/or muesli) showed milder symptoms than horses, which were not fed with concentrated feed (p = 0. 015). The analysis of the status of deworming demonstrated that horses that have not been dewormed regularly, showed more severe symptoms than horses that were dewormed once a year (p < 0. 02). Regions of the body where sweet itch appeared in the early stages were predominantly the mane and tail, followed by the abdomen. In later onset cases, horses would show symptoms along the linea alba. At the time of this study, the majority of the horses showed symptoms in the mane (91. 3 %) and tail (89. 4 %). Amazingly, there were also a large number of horses that had been affected in areas as the face (48 %), ears (46. 5 %), the withers (33. 7 %), neck (32. 2 %) and the inner legs (23. 5 %). Furthermore, results show that when withers, trunk or inner legs were affected, the disease had already progressed to a significant stage. At the time of this study 99 % of the horses suffered from itching, 76. 5 % with strong expression. Furthermore, the horses showed symptoms such as bald areas (87 %) and dandruff (80 %). Bloody crusts (74 %) and skin thickening (68. 1 %) were seen as a sign of a chronic affection. With increased age of the horses symptoms of sweet itch worsened. There seems to be a significant correlation between increased duration and worsened symptoms in this disease. Details were focused of the purchase of the horse. The main attention lay on the skin at the time of the purchase and the purchase investigation. These aspects were analyzed because the horses may already have shown certain skin changes at the time of the purchase but these had not been diagnosed as summer eczema. Surprisingly 41. 4 % of the horses already showed symptoms of the summer eczema at the time of the purchase. Itching manifested at 32. 4 % of the horses and in turn hairless areas already showed 30 % at the purchase in the coat. The horses which already had a big number at hairless places in the coat at the time of the purchase later showed significantly stronger symptoms of summer eczema than horses who showed none or merely few hairless areas. Even more clearly it behaved with the itching of the horses. Horses who had strong pruritus at the time of the purchase, later showed a significantly heavier clinical picture than horses with none, light or even medium strong pruritus (p < 0. 05). With 25. 1 % of the horses a purchase investigation was carried out, however, the veterinarian ascertained skin findings merely with 3. 5 % of these horses. 27. 5 % of the previous owners reported already existing skin problems. The analysis of the data shows that skin problems played a big role at the time of the purchase. Whether or not this was a deliberate deception on the side of the selling owner cannot be excluded. Furthermore 9. 5 % of the horses in the study showed a preexisting illness. 3. 8 % of these horses had an allergy, starting from hay- or dust-allergy (2. 8 %), dust-mites or feed allergens. A total of 2. 0 % of the horses (n = 8) fell ill with a lung illness. The results of this study show the success of the most common drugs and treatment methods of sweet itch. In principle, it was noticed that a recovery of the syndrome appeared as a result of the treatment of the summer eczema in 72. 8 % of the horses. The highest success rate of 70. 3 % was achieved by using an eczema blanket. The use of creams was valued at an acceptable success of 40 %. In contrast, the use of homeopathics, repellents and autohaemotherapy showed no significant improvement of the disease. Desensitization induced an improvement of the clinical signs of summer eczema of 5 horses. Furthermore, there were associations between the exposure to insects and the severity of the symptoms of sweet itch in horses. The analysis of the data showed that 85. 1 % of the owners reported a strong insect load. The higher the midges and/or brake load, the worse the symptoms. The study therefore showed that the best prevention and treatment of sweet itch in horses is the minimization of allergen exposure and the associated reduction of the insect load. The findings of this study show for the first time a representative, multi-breeding overview of the etiology, severity and treatment of summer eczema in examined horse population. All in all it was noticed that in 72. 8 % of horses suffering from sweet itch, those treated showed an improvement in symptoms. The best effect, with 70. 3 % positive outcome, was visible with the use of a blanket. Creams showed an improvement in 40 % of the treated animals. The use of homeopathy, repellants as well as autoheamotherapy did not show significant improvement of the symptoms. In 5 case studies desensitization proved efficient. The study shows that the most effective prevention and therapy of sweet itch is minimization of explosion towards the allergen. 85, 1 % of the participants in the study recalled an increase of Insects. The higher the insect load, the worse the symptomatic of sweet itch (p < 0, 00). This study provides new insight on the development, manifestation and treatment of sweet itch in different horse breeds. The random sample consisted of 404 participants throughout Germany. Limiting factor to this study was the missing reference toward the entire horse population in Germany. To be able to draw conclusions about the entire horse population one would need a control group. Only then would a concrete statement about the epidemiology of sweet itch be valid. Furthermore the subjectivity of the horse owners as well as the sample choice has to be taken under advisement. There is a possibility that predominantly owner of horses affected more severely with sweet itch participated in the study. As it is a purely written questionnaire the assessment of the horse owner concerning the severity of symptoms as well as the insect load may vary greatly. A combination of a written questionnaire as well as an examination by a veterinarian may lead to more thorough result [...] Also evaluating the progression of sweet itch over several years would be useful. A questionnaire should be designed that should be filled out by the owner more than once a year to which pictures documenting the symptomatic of sweet itch should be added...|$|E

Four primiparous Finnish Ayrshire cows fitted with cannulae in the rumen and duodenum were used in a 4 × 4 Latin square experiment with four 28 -d experimental periods and 2 × 2 factorial arrangements of treatments. Using red clover-containing (40 %) silage rather than pure grass silage had minor effects on rumen fermentation or diet digestion but increased non-ammonia nitrogen (N) flow in terms of increased flows of microbial and dietary N entering to the small intestine. This was reflected as a reduced ruminal N degradability on grass-red clover diets. Furthermore, grass-red clover diets in comparison to grass silage diets increased milk lactose concentration and yields of milk, protein and lactose. <b>Feeding</b> <b>oats</b> in replacement for barley had minor effects on rumen fermentation or post-ruminal non-ammonia N flows but reduced digestibility of organic matter and neutral detergent fibre in the diet. Using oats rather than barley increased yields of milk and lactose but reduced milk protein concentration.

Thirty horses were assigned to treatments: control (hay only), HC (high corn), HO (high oats), LC (low corn), LO (low oats), and LW (low pelleted wheat middlings). Horses received an all-forage diet (2 wk; d - 14 to d - 1) before the treatment diets (2 wk; d 1 to 14). Starch was introduced gradually so that horses received 50 % of the assigned starch amount (high = 2 g starch/kg BW; low = 1 g starch/kg BW) by d 4 and 100 % by d 11. Fecal samples were obtained at the end of the forage-only period (S 0; d - 2), and on d 6 (S 1) and d 13 (S 2) of the treatment period. Cellulolytics, lactobacilli, Group D Gram-positive cocci (GPC), lactate-utilizers and amylolytics were enumerated. Enumeration data were log transformed and analyzed by repeated measures ANOVA.

Eight mature stock-type mares averaging 481. 4 kg were used in a 4 x 2 switchback arrangement of treatments to determine nutrient density of an experimental diet. The horses were blocked by age into groups of four and then randomly assigned to a treatment from a group. The treatments were 1) control - <b>feeding</b> <b>oats</b> with alfalfa hay in a 50 : 50 ratio and 2) experimental - feeding an experimental high-fat, high-fiber concentrate in a 50 : 50 ratio with grass hay. Daily feed intakes were similar in both groups, averaging approximately 1. 5 % of body weight. Following 10 d of adjustment to the diets, the horses underwent 4 d of total collections of feces. Feed and fecal samples were analyzed for dry matter, neutral detergent fiber (NDF), acid detergent fiber (ADF), nitrogen, ether extract and gross energy concentrations. Dry matter digestibility was higher when horses were fed the control diet (P 0. 10) when feeding both diets. Total NDF intake was higher when horses were fed the experimental diet (P < 0. 01), but NDF digestibility was higher when the horses were fed the control diet (P < 0. 01). Still, digestible NDF intake was higher when the horses were fed the experimental diet (P < 0. 05). Total ADF intake was higher (P < 0. 01), but ADF digestibility was lower when the horses were fed the experimental diet (P < 0. 10). Thus, digestible ADF intake was greater when horses were fed the experimental diet (P < 0. 05). Energy digestibility was higher when the horses were fed the control diet (P < 0. 01), thus digestible energy (DE) intake was higher when the horses were fed the control diet (P < 0. 01) than when fed the experimental diet.

Unfavourable weather conditions during the growing season may cause crop failure leading to low volume weight. The effects of different volume weights of both oats (33, 43, 51, 61 kg/hl) and barley (31, 38, 57, 69 kg/hl) on milk fatty acid composition were studied with 16 Finnish Ayrshire cows in a replicated (n= 2) 4 x 4 Latin square experiments with 4 -week periods. Grass-red clover silage was fed ad libitum with 8 kg concentrate, which included 86 % oats or barley, 10 % rapeseed meal and 4 % minerals + vitamins. Mean proportion of oats and barley concentrate consumption was 0. 39 of dietary dry matter. Crude fat content of oat based concentrates were over twice that of barley containing concentrates (5. 9, 5. 6, 6. 8, 6. 6 % vs. 2. 6, 2. 5, 2. 6, 2. 6 %, respectively). Lipid in oats contained approximately 2. 8 times higher oleic acid and 1. 4 times lower palmitic and linoleic acid and 3. 4 times lower linolenic acid relative to barley. Differences in milk fatty acid composition due to variations in volume weight were small, although statistically significant in some cases. Fatty acid content of milk (% of total fatty acids) produced with oats and barley of different volume weights from the lowest to the highest respectively were: palmitic acid 29. 3, 29. 9, 28, 7, 28. 5 and 34. 7, 34. 8, 34. 4, 35. 4; stearic acid 13. 6, 13. 3, 13. 7, 13. 9 and 10. 3, 10. 0, 9. 3, 9. 4; oleic acid 23. 7, 22. 1, 23. 4, 23. 9 and 18. 3, 17. 3, 16. 3, 16. 8; linoleic acid 0. 8, 1. 2, 1. 0, 1. 2 and 1. 2, 1. 2, 1. 4, 1. 4; linolenic acid 0. 7, 0. 7, 0. 7, 0. 7 and 0. 6, 0. 6 0. 8, 0. 8. In conclusion, failure of oats or barley crops has little effect on milk fatty acid composition. Oats are recommended for dairy cow feeding due to a more desirable fatty acid composition of milk for human nutrition compared with barley. Ekern, A. et al. 2003.

60|$|Tony, {{before the}} evening was over, gave the Boyle {{officers}} two or three most desperate bargains. First, he got the celebrated mare Kickie-wickie {{for a pair of}} broken down gig horses, to run tandem: engaged to go quiet and not kick in harness. They couldn't be warranted sound: but then, as Tony said, what horse could? and he was so particular--he would never say a horse was sound, unless he knew it; in fact, he never warranted a horse sound; which was true enough, for Tony knew no one would take his warrant; and then when the Captain was in the first fit of grief for Kickie-wickie, some good-natured friend having told him that the two gig horses weren't worth a <b>feed</b> of <b>oats,</b> Tony gave her back again for a good hack hunter, and a sum of money to boot, about the real value of the mare. Again, late in the evening--when the punch had made further inroads upon the poor warrior's brain--he gave him back his own hunter for the two gig horses and a further sum of money: from all which it will be seen by those who understand the art, that the officer from Boyle could not have made a great deal, and that Tony McKeon could not be much out of pocket.|$|R
40|$|This work {{deals with}} {{calculations}} of feed rations of selected thoroughbred horses at the High School of Horse Racing in Prague {{together with an}} assessment of economic aspects of horse feeding. The school is mainly focused on the education of jockeys, {{which means that the}} work with horses has to conform to the school requirements that need not meet the ideal feeding rhythm of the horses. United Kingdom norms were compared to the selected Czech norms. Focus was mainly on the racing season, which provides direct comparison of the feed rations with the horses results in the races. The racing season has the highest energetic requirements that need to take into account not only the requirements for the races themselves but also for the resting periods. Feed rations were measured and fed in precise time intervals. Main <b>feeds</b> were <b>oats,</b> hay, bran and Spillers feeds. During the assessment period a negative side - effect of high temperatures during consecutive heat - wave periods was observed. This aspect may prove important in the future and needs {{to be taken into account}} not only for feeding but for the entire horse training. Out of five examined horses, exceedance of digestible energy requirements was observed with two horses and underestimation with one horse. For two of them the anomaly was in norm. However, the horse with the highest exceedance was experiencing difficulties with feeding, always leaving a part of the ration intact. This made it necessary to adapt the rations to a higher figure than calculated. Economic aspect of horse feeding needs to be taken into account. The feeding expenses can be decreased by a suitable selection of a feeding mix, however the savings in this regard are not fundamental...|$|R
40|$|The {{possibility}} of inducing conditioned taste aversion (CTA) by injection of apomorphine in 24 young Maltese goats {{and the effect}} of social models on the feeding behaviour of conditioned animals were evaluated. The experimental <b>feeds</b> were <b>oats</b> seed (OS) and rabbit alfalfa pellets (RP). Animals were divided into six social groups (S), including conditioned and unconditioned subjects, and two non-social groups (NS), with conditioned animals only. Within the S groups each conditioned animal stood between two unconditioned subjects while eating. When feeds were paired with apomorphine (APO feeds), {{no significant differences were found}} in consumptions between conditioned animals of the S and NS groups (P > 0. 05). Unconditioned animals of the S groups did not modify their feed intakes and were not able to stimulate the intake of the APO feeds in the conditioned subjects. Consumption of the APO feeds was significantly lower than that of the control feeds (P < 0. 001). RP was always consumed more than OS, even when it was associated with apomorphine, probably because of its physical similarity to the pellet of the base diet. In the two-choice test 16 out of 24 goats chose the control feed first and eight the feed associated with illness. When they chose the latter, it was RP seven out of eight times and OS only once (P < 0. 01). The amounts of the consumed control feeds were significantly higher than those of the APO feeds (P < 0. 01). The significant reduction in consumption of the APO feeds in comparison with the control feeds showed that goats can learn to avoid a feed that immediately produces illness. The conditioned animals did not modify their feed intakes following the influence of the unconditioned subjects...|$|R
50|$|Agriculture still {{plays a role}} {{in keeping}} the community's economy strong, {{including}} trucking and transportation, and farming, although the three grain elevators that once stood, as well as the train station, are now gone. The main crop grown in the area is wheat. The primary type of livestock raised in the area is beef cattle.

40|$|The {{physiological}} {{effects of}} dietary fiber (DFs) depend on several factors including structural {{features of the}} DFs, composition and activity of colonic microbiota, and products formed during fermentation. In this thesis, the influence of pectin supplementation to feed fermentation characteristics in rats and pigs was studied. The non-starch polysaccharides (NSP) present in the selected <b>feed</b> ingredient <b>oats</b> were characterized. Distinct populations of arabinoxylans (AXs) were observed in oats, compared to those reported for other cereals like wheat and barley. The fate of cereal AXs and soybean pectin during fermentation and the consequent effects on appetite regulation and fat accumulation were studied in rats as a model. Oat AXs were fermented less rapidly than wheat AXs in the caecum of rats. Soy pectin was fermented more early and efficiently than cereal AXs. A significant inverse correlation between rat retroperitoneal fat-pad weight and concentration and relative SCFA proportion of butyrate was observed. In a following in vivo rat experiment, commercial soy pectin together with three other soluble pectins originating from citrus and sugar beet and differing in their methyl esterification were individually supplemented to the diets. Their effects on the utilization of the different DFs present in the feed and the consequent effect on the microbial community in the colon of rats was studied. All pectins were fermented rapidly and consequently shifted fermentation of other consumed DFs (e. g. cereal AXs) to more distal part of colon, although low-methyl esterified pectin was more efficiently fermented by the microbiota than high-methyl esterified pectin. Results suggested that pectins can confer beneficial health effects through modulation of the gut microbiota. In a last in vivo experiment, citrus pectins together with a hydrothermal treated soybean meal were supplemented to pig diets to study their effect on the digestion and fermentation of carbohydrates in both the small and large intestine. Pectins, and more particularly low-methyl esterified pectin, decreased the ileal digestibility of digestible starch resulting in more starch to be fermentated in the proximal colon of pigs. Consequently, also the fermentation patterns of DFs and the microbiota composition was affected. All pectins tested shaped the colonic microbiota from a Lactobacillus-dominated microbiota to a Prevotella-dominated community, with potential health-promoting effects...|$|R
60|$|These {{wars and}} desolations {{in their natural}} consequences, were {{likewise}} the cause of another effect, I mean that of uniting several parishes under one incumbent. For, as the lands were of little value by the want of inhabitants to cultivate them, {{and many of the}} churches levelled to the ground, particularly by the fanatic zeal of those rebellious saints who murdered their king, destroyed the Church, and overthrew monarchy (for all which there is a humiliation day appointed by law, and soon approaching); so, in order to give a tolerable maintenance to a minister, and the country being too poor, as well as devotion too low, to think of building new churches, it was found necessary to repair some one church which had least suffered, and join sometimes three or more, enough for a bare support to some clergyman, who knew not where to provide himself better. This was a case of absolute necessity to prevent heathenism, as well as popery, from overrunning the nation. The consequence of these unions was very different, in different parts; for, in the north, by the Scotch settlement, their numbers daily increasing by new additions from their own country, and their prolific quality peculiar to northern people; and lastly by their universally <b>feeding</b> upon <b>oats</b> (which grain, under its several preparations and denominations, is the only natural luxury of that hardy people) the value of tithes increased so prodigiously, that at this day, I confess, several united parishes ought to be divided, taking in so great a compass, that it is almost impossible for the people to travel timely to their own parish church, or their little churches to contain half their number, though the revenue would be sufficient to maintain two, or perhaps three worthy clergymen with decency; provided the times mend, or that they were honestly dealt with, which I confess is seldom the case. I shall name only one, and it is the deanery of Derry; the revenue whereof, if the dean could get his dues, exceeding that of some bishoprics, both by the compass and fertility of the soil, the number as well as industry of the inhabitants, the conveniency of exporting their corn to Dublin and foreign parts; and, lastly, by the accidental discovery of marl in many places of the several parishes. Yet all this revenue is wholly founded upon corn, for I am told there is hardly an acre of glebe for the dean to plant and build on.|$|R
40|$|Podolian cattle {{represents}} {{one of the most important}} native Italian breed. This breed was once dolian reared in many different Italian regions, whereas in recent years a dramatic reduction of the number of head has relegated this breed to some marginal areas of southern Italy. For meat production, calves are dam-reared on pasture for about 8 - 10 months and, subsequently they are fed a finishing diet in loose house conditions with external paddock. They usually are slaughtered from 14 to 18 months of age. The aim of this study was to evaluate the chemical and the fatty acid composition of sample cuts of Podolian bulls slaughtered at different ages; even if breed, age and sex related to differences in the fatty acid composition of beef cattle have been widely demonstrated (Einchhorn et al., 1986; Huerta- Leidenz et al., 1996; Malau-Aduli et al., 2000), few data are available on Podolian cattle. This trial was carried out on 12 Podolian steers, from the same farm in the Basilicata region. The subjects, at the age of about 10 months, were moved to a stall for fattening and divided into 2 homogeneous groups of 6 animals each. During the trial period, the animal were fed ad libitum with hard wheat straw and a complete pellet <b>feed,</b> containing barley, <b>oats,</b> field beans, and a vitamin-mineral integrator. The steers were slaughtered at the age of 14 months (A group) and 18 months (B group), according to veterinary police rules.

40|$|A {{variety of}} feeds {{are used in}} the {{nutrition}} of browsing ruminants. During digestion trials on okapis, feedstuffs of different facilities were sampled and the Hohenheim gas test was used as in vitro fermentation method to quantify their fermentative behavior. Forty-six feeds were analyzed (7, fruit and vegetable; 11, energy concentrates and pelleted compounds; 13, forage; 9, browse leaf, 6, small and large twig samples). Gas production of these samples was recorded after 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 24 hr of fermentation. Browse leaf samples were additionally analyzed with a tannin-binding agent (polyethylene-glycol) to assess limiting effects of condensed tannins. Metabolizable energy (ME) was estimated from 24 hr gas production according to standard regressions. Vegetables and particularly fruits were found to yield very high gas productions during the first 2 hr of fermentation, whereas unmolassed beet pulp was found to have a more even distribution of gas production/energy release over total fermentation time. <b>Feeds</b> like rolled <b>oats</b> or bread were evaluated to yield very high energy contents of > 14 MJ ME/kg dry matter (DM). Alfalfa (Medicago sativa) hay had a comparable fermentation pattern to fresh browse samples, characterized by a high fermentation rate. In conclusion, energy-rich constituents for captive ruminant diets should not include larger amounts of vegetables and especially fruits, due to their very fast fermentation during the initial phase of fermentation and the connected risk of rumen acidosis. Energy-concentrates like beet pulp (unmolassed) showed moderate fermentation characteristics and energy content and are well suited as a component of zoo ruminant diets. Energy-concentrates with very high energy densities (> 13 MJ ME/kg DM) like bread or rolled oats are not suitable for a diet that is intended to promote long feeding times. Various aspects are involved in the decision for appropriate forage for browsing ruminants; based on fermentation pattern, alfalfa hay seems to be a reasonable substitute for browse leaves...|$|R
40|$|Grain {{samples were}} {{produced}} at 10 different {{locations in the}} Western Cape region of South Africa, on 2. 1 m x 6 m experimental plots, {{over a period of}} three years. Twenty different cereal grain cultivars were used in the study. A randomised square experimental design with four replicates per sample was used. An area of 1. 35 m x 5 m from each plot was harvested during 1994, 1995 and 1996 and the yield was determined. Thousand seed mass (TSM) and hectolitre mass (HLM) were also determined. Samples were analysed for dry matter (DM), ash, crude protein (CP), ether extract (EE), neutral detergent fibre (NDF), acid detergent fibre (ADF) and in vitro organic matter digestibility (IVOMD). Digestible energy values (DE) for pigs were determined with a mobile nylon bag technique, while non-structural carbohydrate values (NSC) were calculated. In the first analysis, cultivars were compared by a one-way analysis of variance, followed by pooling of grain type data. Naked oats had the highest DE value, and the respective values (DM basis) for naked oats, wheat, triticale, 2 -row brewer's barley, 6 -row <b>feed</b> barley and <b>oats</b> were 18. 0, 16. 0, 15. 8, 14. 9, 14. 4, and 12. 6 MJ/kg DM. The high EE value of naked oats (97 g/kg) might be partly responsible for the high DE value. The 6 -row and 2 -row naked barley cultivars had the highest IVOMD (946 g/kg and 944 g/kg), followed by wheat (910 g/kg), triticale (905 g/kg), naked oats (899 g/kg), 2 -row brewer's barley (882 g/kg), 6 -row feed barley (844 g/kg) and oats (671 g/kg). Considerable variation was found between samples within a cultivar for DE and IVOMD. Two-row naked barley had the highest mean CP value (159 g/kg) followed by naked oats (159 g/kg), 6 -row naked barley (154 g/kg), wheat (148 g/kg), triticale (146 g/kg), oats (143 g/kg), 2 -row brewer's barley (136 g/kg) and 6 -row feed barley (135 g/kg) on DM basis.

40|$|US {{organic poultry}} {{producers}} {{are under pressure}} to find feed alternatives to corn and wheat. Hulless oats offer advantages such as wide geographic adaptation of the plant and high concentrations of protein and oil in the grain. They have shown considerable potential in experimental work as a feed grain for poultry, but {{more research is needed}} into their influence on the sensory and nutritional properties of eggs. In this study, hulless oats were substituted for corn or wheat at 200 [*]g kg− 1 in diets fed to Hy-Line Brown hens and eggs were sampled for sensory evaluation after 8 [*]weeks. Discrimination tests of blended and baked egg samples found evidence of difference between eggs from oat-based diets and those from the oat-free control (p[*]<[*] 0. 05 for eggs from an oat-corn diet, p[*]<[*] 0. 01 for eggs from an oat-wheat diet). Acceptance tests of similar samples showed that eggs from the oat-wheat diet were significantly less liked than control eggs for their texture (p[*]<[*] 0. 01) and response to cooking (p[*]<[*] 0. 01), while eggs from the oat-corn diet were somewhat less liked. Yolk weight was greater (p[*]<[*] 0. 05) in control eggs (34. 1 [*]g) than eggs from oat-corn (31. 6 [*]g) or oat-wheat (31. 2 [*]g) diets, leading to smaller yolk proportion in the oat-fed eggs. Fatty acid profile differences across treatments were not of nutritional significance, and no evidence was found that the <b>feeding</b> of hulless <b>oats</b> improved storage properties of eggs. In this study, modifying the carbohydrate source in layer diets was shown to change textural properties of cooked eggs {{in a way that was}} perceptible to untrained consumers, probably by reducing the yolk proportion. This finding was not commercially relevant owing to small effect size, and results overall add to existing evidence that hulless oats can be fed to poultry at a moderate proportion of the diet with no negative effect on consumer acceptability of eggs. Regardless of the small effect size, however, findings are interesting from the food chemistry perspective because they provide novel evidence of how the thermal properties of eggs can be altered by a change in hen dietary carbohydrate source...|$|R
40|$|Feed tables give lower <b>feed</b> {{values for}} <b>oats</b> than for barley, but oats {{has been shown}} in many {{experiments}} to improve milk production and milk fatty acid composition compared with barley (Moran 1986, Heikkilä et al. 1988, Martin & Thomas 1988, Ekern et al. 2003). Oats has traditionally been used in Finland as a main cereal for dairy cows on farms. Today farmers often use barley-oats mixtures. In this experiment we studied the effects of increasing amounts (0. 2, 0. 3, 0. 4 kg/kg 4 -% fat-corrected milk) of oats and barley-oats mixture (1 : 1) as the only concentrate on the milk yield and composition and feed utilization in a 2 x 3 factorial continuous trial with 36 Finnish Ayrshire cows. Grass silage was fed ad libitum with hay 1 kg/d. An experimental period of 24 weeks was preceded by a 2 -week covariance period. The digestibility of feeds was measured on sheep. Mean consumption of cereals was 4. 8, 7. 5 and 10. 2 kg/d with respective proportions of 29, 40 and 51 % of dietary dry matter (DM). Increasing the amounts of both cereals from 29 to 51 % of DM decreased silage DM intake with a substitution rate of 0. 438 and 0. 264 for oats and barley-oats, respectively, but total DM intake, milk, fat, protein and lactose yields increased linearly. Oats resulted in higher milk yield response than barley-oats (0. 966 vs. 0. 745 kg milk/kg cereal DM increase), but the difference in energy-corrected milk yield response was smaller (0. 846 vs. 0. 781) because of a tendency to lower fat and protein content with increase of oats compared with barley-oats. The oleic acid content of milk fat tended to increase with increasing oats, but to decrease with increasing barley-oats. Milk renneting properties improved with increasing cereal amounts, but less with oats than with barley-oats. Milk production parameters did not differ significantly between cereals except the utilization of metabolizable energy and AAT (amino acids absorbed from the small intestine), which were higher with oats than with barley-oats as a concentrate.

I know shy neighbourhoods {{where the}} Donkey goes {{in at the}} street door, and appears to live up-stairs, for I have {{examined}} the back-yard from over the palings, and {{have been unable to}} make him out. Gentility, nobility, Royalty, would appeal to that donkey in vain to do what he does for a costermonger. <b>Feed</b> him with <b>oats</b> at the highest price, put an infant prince and princess in a pair of panniers on his back, adjust his delicate trappings to a nicety, take him to the softest slopes at Windsor, and try what pace you can get out of him. Then, starve him, harness him anyhow to a truck with a flat tray on it, and see him bowl from Whitechapel to Bayswater. There appears to be no particular private understanding between birds and donkeys, in a state of nature; but in the shy neighbourhood state, you shall see them always in the same hands and always developing their very best energies for the very worst company. I have known a donkey--by sight; we were not on speaking terms--who lived over on the Surrey side of London-bridge, among the fastnesses of Jacob's Island and Dockhead. It was the habit of that animal, when his services were not in immediate requisition, to go out alone, idling. I have met him a mile from his place of residence, loitering about the streets; and the expression of his countenance at such times was most degraded. He was attached to the establishment of an elderly lady who sold periwinkles, and he used to stand on Saturday nights with a cartful of those delicacies outside a gin-shop, pricking up his ears when a customer came to the cart, and too evidently deriving satisfaction from the knowledge that they got bad measure. His mistress was sometimes overtaken by inebriety. The last time I ever saw him (about five years ago) he was in circumstances of difficulty, caused by this failing. Having been left alone with the cart of periwinkles, and forgotten, he went off idling. He prowled among his usual low haunts for some time, gratifying his depraved tastes, until, not taking the cart into his calculations, he endeavoured to turn up a narrow alley, and became greatly involved. He was taken into custody by the police, and, the Green Yard of the district being near at hand, was backed into that place of durance. At that crisis, I encountered him; the stubborn sense he evinced of being--not to compromise the expression--a blackguard, I never saw exceeded in the human subject. A flaring candle in a paper shade, stuck in among his periwinkles, showed him, with his ragged harness broken and his cart extensively shattered, twitching his mouth and shaking his hanging head, a picture of disgrace and obduracy. I have seen boys being taken to station-houses, who were as like him as his own brother.|$|R
