At the time, Ladd said he thought he heard a prowler, grabbed a gun, and tripped over, accidentally shooting himself. This was accepted by the police investigating.|$|E
25|$|During the 1970s, {{he wrote}} humorous commentaries for {{national}} magazines. His radio career gained an early-1980s revival {{in his native}} New York City, thanks to his two-and-a-half-minute The Henry Morgan Show commentaries, broadcast twice daily on WNEW-AM (now WBBR) starting in January 1981. The following year, he added the Saturday evening show Morgan and the Media on WOR. <b>In</b> <b>what</b> <b>might</b> be called inadvertent iconoclasm, Morgan used a 1981 WNEW commentary on pre-inflation prices to sing, rather wistfully, an old Pepsi jingle ("Pepsi-Cola hits the spot/Twelve full ounces, that's a lot/Twice as much for a nickel, too/Pepsi-Cola is the drink for you"). The irony abounded as well, remembering Morgan's controversies with his sponsors in the classic radio days; the only thing wrong with singing that ancient Pepsi jingle was that that day's Morgan commentary was sponsored by rival Coca-Cola.|$|E

25|$|Beyond this, most {{substances}} {{have three}} ordinarily recognized states of matter, solid, liquid, and gas, {{and a fourth}} less obviously recognized one, plasma. Many have further, more finely differentiated, states of matter, such as for example, glass, and liquid crystal. In many cases, at fixed temperature and pressure, a substance can exist in several distinct states of matter <b>in</b> <b>what</b> <b>might</b> {{be viewed as the}} same 'body'. For example, ice may float in a glass of water. Then the ice and the water are said to constitute two phases within the 'body'. Definite rules are known, telling how distinct phases may coexist in a 'body'. Mostly, at a fixed pressure, there is a definite temperature at which heating causes a solid to melt or evaporate, and a definite temperature at which heating causes a liquid to evaporate. In such cases, cooling has the reverse effects.|$|E

500|$|German {{reports on}} 17 August stated {{that all the}} tankers in the recent Mediterranean convoy had been sunk {{and none of the}} {{transports}} had reached their destination (assumed to be Egypt). The Allies had lost thirteen vessels, including nine merchantmen, one aircraft carrier (Eagle), two cruisers (Manchester and Cairo) and a destroyer (Foresight) but the Royal Navy and the Merchant Navy had saved Malta. The arrival of about [...] of general cargo, together with petrol, oil fuel, kerosene and diesel fuel, was enough to give the island about ten more weeks supply beyond the few weeks that the existing stocks would last. Axis propaganda broadcasts made extravagant claims but a Kriegsmarine report noted the incomplete and contradictory evidence, allowing only a provisional conclusion. The arrival of four merchant ships and a tanker was unsatisfactory, because the revival of Malta as an offensive base would affect Axis supply routes <b>in</b> <b>what</b> <b>might</b> be the [...] "decisive phase of the struggle for North Africa". Supermarina reached the same conclusion and Generale Giuseppe Santoro, deputy {{chief of staff of the}} Regia Aeronautica, wrote that the British had achieved a strategic success by bringing Malta back into action [...] "in the final phase of the struggle in Egypt".|$|E

2500|$|A {{great many}} of the {{performers}} of shanties do so <b>in</b> <b>what</b> <b>might</b> be distinguished as a [...] "folk music" [...] style.

Stylistic characteristics include lighter vocals with a [...] "folk" [...] timbre, livelier tempos, and instrumental interludes between verses. Invariably these performers choose to accompany themselves on instruments such as guitar and banjo. Their rhythms may be syncopated and quite different from work song rhythms, relying on the instruments to keep time rather than the voice.|$|E
2500|$|The study, {{the only}} {{room in the}} tower to have a fireplace, {{contained}} most of the paintings commissioned by Montaigne.

2500|$|One {{reviewer}} saw in Kapuściński's {{mixing of}} subtle psychological reflection with vivid description {{an invitation to}} a comparison with Joseph Conrad; [...] Binyavanga Wainaina and Aleksandar Hemon made the same comparison, if for other, less laudatory reasons. Kapuściński confirmed to Bill Deedes the fact that Conrad was one of his literary inspirations. [...] Neal Ascherson likened him to Egon Erwin Kisch (1885–1948) considered the father of literary reportage. Kapuściński himself cites Kisch with approval as the [...] "classic of reportage" [...] who dealt a death blow to traditional forms of reporting by putting the person of the reporter at centre stage. [...] Certainly, neither Kisch nor Kapuściński believed <b>in</b> <b>what</b> <b>might</b> be called [...] "journalistic objectivity": whereas Kisch thought it necessary for a (Communist) reporter to [...] "engage politically" [...] with his subject, Kapuściński would put objectivity as a concept out of court altogether, stating explicitly, [...] "There {{is no such thing as}} objectivity.
