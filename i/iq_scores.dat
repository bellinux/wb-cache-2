5|$|All IQ {{tests show}} {{variation}} in scores {{even when the}} same person takes the same test over and over again. <b>IQ</b> <b>scores</b> also differ for a test-taker taking tests {{from more than one}} publisher at the same age. The various test publishers do not use uniform names or definitions for IQ score classifications. All these issues must be kept in mind when interpreting an individual's <b>IQ</b> <b>scores,</b> because they all can result in different IQ classifications for the same person at different times.|$|E

5|$|A 2007 {{study of}} young chess {{players in the}} United Kingdom found that strong players tended to have above-average <b>IQ</b> <b>scores,</b> but, within that group, the {{correlation}} between chess skill and IQ was moderately negative, meaning that smarter children tended to achieve {{a lower level of}} chess skill. This result was explained by a negative correlation between intelligence and practice in the elite subsample, and by practice having a higher influence on chess skill.|$|E
5|$|IQ classifications for {{individuals}} also vary because category labels for <b>IQ</b> <b>score</b> ranges {{are specific to}} each brand of test. The test publishers {{do not have a}} uniform practice of labeling <b>IQ</b> <b>score</b> ranges, nor do they have a consistent practice of dividing up <b>IQ</b> <b>score</b> ranges into categories of the same size or with the same boundary scores. Thus psychologists should specify which test was given when reporting a test-taker's IQ. Psychologists and IQ test authors recommend that psychologists adopt the terminology of each test publisher when reporting <b>IQ</b> <b>score</b> ranges.|$|R

5|$|IQ classifications from IQ testing are not {{the last}} word on how a test-taker will do in life, nor are they the only {{information}} to be considered for placement in school or job-training programs.

5|$|A major {{point of}} {{consensus}} among all scholars of intellectual giftedness {{is that there}} is no generally agreed definition of giftedness. Although there is no scholarly agreement about identifying gifted learners, there is a de facto reliance on <b>IQ</b> <b>scores</b> for identifying participants in school gifted education programs. In practice, many school districts in the United States use an IQ score of 130, including about the upper 2 or 3 percent of the national population, as a cut-off score for inclusion in school gifted programs.|$|E
5|$|IQ tests {{generally}} are reliable enough {{that most people}} ages ten and older have similar <b>IQ</b> <b>scores</b> throughout life. Still, some individuals score very differently when taking the same test at different times or when taking more than one kind of IQ test at the same age. For example, many children in the famous longitudinal Genetic Studies of Genius begun in 1921 by Lewis Terman showed declines in IQ as they grew up. Terman recruited school pupils based on referrals from teachers, and gave them his Stanford–Binet IQ test. Children with an IQ above 140 by that test {{were included in the}} study. There were 643 children in the main study group. When the students who could be contacted again (503 students) were retested at high school age, they were found to have dropped 9 IQ points on average in Stanford–Binet IQ. More than two dozen children dropped by 15 IQ points and six by 25 points or more. Yet parents of those children thought that the children were still as bright as ever, or even brighter.|$|E

This study was aimed to investigate some biochemical parameters, nutritional status and <b>IQ</b> <b>score</b> in children in endemic area of Boyolali Regency, Central Java. Before and after quasi experimental study design was implemented. A number of 115 school-aged children (9 - 12 years) with iodine deficiency, PEM problem and attributed to 6 - 10 sign of cretinism were selected as study sample. Sampling was conducted by using random sampling procedure. The Group of treatment were selenium supplement (n= 34), iodine supplement (n= 35), selenium and iodine (n= 18) and placebo (n= 28). The study found that selenium, iodine, selenium and iodine supplement intervention were significantly reduce the stunted (p= 0. 04, r= 0. 587) and underweight (p= 0. 01, r= 0. 87).

40|$|Context Longitudinal studies {{indicate}} that a lower <b>IQ</b> <b>score</b> increases risk of schizophrenia. Preliminary evidence suggests {{there is no such}} effect for nonpsychotic bipolar disorder. To our knowledge, there are no prior population-based, longitudinal studies of premorbid <b>IQ</b> <b>score</b> and risk of developing severe depression requiring hospital admission. Objectives To investigate the association between premorbid <b>IQ</b> <b>score</b> and risk of developing schizophrenia, other nonaffective psychoses, bipolar disorder, and severe depression and to investigate effects of confounding and examine possible causal pathways by which IQ may alter these risks. Design Historical cohort study, using record linkage for hospital admissions during a 27 -year follow-up period. Setting Survey of Swedish conscripts (1969 - 1970). Participants Population-based sample of 50 087 male subjects. Data were available on <b>IQ</b> <b>score</b> at conscription and on other social and psychological characteristics. Main Outcome Measures International Classification of Diseases, Eighth Revision or Ninth Revision diagnoses of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, severe depression, and other nonaffective psychoses. Results There was no association between premorbid <b>IQ</b> <b>score</b> and risk of bipolar disorder. Lower IQ was associated with increased risk of schizophrenia, severe depression, and other nonaffective psychoses. Risk of schizophrenia was increased in subjects with average IQ compared with those with high scores, indicating that risk is spread across the whole IQ range. Conclusions Lower <b>IQ</b> <b>score</b> was associated with increased risk for schizophrenia, severe depression, and other nonaffective psychoses, but not bipolar disorder. This finding indicates that at least some aspects of the neurodevelopmental etiology of bipolar disorder may differ from these other disorders...|$|R

5|$|Several {{recent studies}} attempt {{to examine the}} effects of chronic low-dose {{manganese}} overexposure on child development. The earliest study was conducted in the Chinese province of Shanxi. Drinking water there had been contaminated through improper sewage irrigation and contained 240–350µg Mn/L. Although Mn concentrations at or below 300µg Mn/L were considered safe at the time of the study by the US EPA and 400µg Mn/L by the World Health Organization, the 92 children sampled (between 11 and 13 years of age) from this province displayed lower performance on tests of manual dexterity and rapidity, short-term memory, and visual identification, compared to children from an uncontaminated area. More recently, a study of 10-year-old children in Bangladesh showed a relationship between Mn concentration in well water and diminished <b>IQ</b> <b>scores.</b> A third study conducted in Quebec examined school children between the ages of 6 and 15 living in homes that received water from a well containing 610µg Mn/L; controls lived in homes that received water from a 160µg Mn/L well.

40|$|AIM: To {{assess the}} {{frequency}} of intellectual disability in children diagnosed with ASD. METHODS: A total of 98 children aged from 2 to 8 years of age were evaluated for ASD and their level of cognition in the National Center for Growth, Development and Rehabilitation of Children in Tirana, Albania. Griffiths Development scales from 0 to 2 {{years of age and}} SON-R (Snijders- Oomen Nonverbal Intelligence Test) from 2 to 8 years of age was used to assess the cognition and the intellectual disability if any in all the children that participated in the study. All ASD subjects met the criteria of DSM-IV and were given the diagnosis using ADOS and ADI-R tests. All ASD children were children diagnosed with infantile autism and PDD-NOS. Children with Asperger, Rett syndrome and Childhood Disintegrative Disorder were excluded from the study. They were chosen randomly and signed a consent form of participation in the study. RESULTS: From the total of 98 children 8 of them had an <b>IQ</b> <b>score</b> above 70 in one of the above intelligent tests (8 % of the total ASD children). 21 of the children had an <b>IQ</b> <b>score</b> from 70 to 55 (mild intellectual disability, 21 % of the total ASD children). 53 of them had an <b>IQ</b> <b>score</b> from 55 to 40 (moderate intellectual disability, 54 % of the total ASD children). 12 of them had an <b>IQ</b> <b>score</b> from 40 to 25 (severe intellectual disability, 12 % of the total ASD children). 4 of them had an <b>IQ</b> <b>score</b> below 25 (profound intellectual disability, 5 % of the total ASD children). CONCLUSION: Children with pervasive developmental disorders show a wide variety of co-morbid problems, which are relevant for the treatment and the course of the disorder and probably the most important one is the intellectual disability...|$|R
40|$|Abstract PURPOSE: Decline in {{intelligence}} can occur after whole-brain cranial irradiation for childhood malignancy. The {{purpose of this}} analysis was to estimate better the impact of dose and age at time of irradiation on IQ decline. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 48 children were studied. We combined two previously reported studies that included 15 patients with pediatric acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) and 18 pediatric patients with medulloblastoma/posterior fossa primitive neural ectodermal tumors (PNETs) in whom serial IQ tests were administered. Another 15 patients (nine ALL and six PNET) were studied subsequent to these reports. This experience included ALL patients who were treated with whole-brain irradiation at doses of 18 Gy (n = 9) and 24 Gy (n = 15), and PNET patients who were treated with 18 Gy (n = 5), 22 to 24 Gy (n = 2), and 32 to 40 Gy (n = 17). Multiple regression models were constructed to estimate expected <b>IQ</b> <b>score</b> after treatment based on initial <b>IQ</b> <b>score,</b> age at treatment, and dose of whole-brain irradiation. RESULTS: Using a multiple linear regression model to correct for initial IQ and age at treatment, patients who received a dose of 36 Gy to the whole brain were estimated to score 8. 2 points less on IQ testing than those with 24 Gy (95 % confidence interval [CI], 1. 8 to 14. 6) and 12. 3 points less than those who received 18 Gy (95 % CI, 2. 7 to 21. 7). Older age {{at the time of}} irradiation resulted in less decline in subsequent <b>IQ</b> <b>score.</b> The predicted <b>IQ</b> decline is 11. 9 points less in a 10 -year-old patient than in a 3 -year-old patient (95 % CI, 4. 2 to 19. 6) for equivalent doses of irradiation. The model to predict IQ accounts for half the total variation in <b>IQ</b> <b>score.</b> There {{was no significant difference between}} the coefficients that reflected IQ decrease from radiation dose between subgroups who had ALL versus those with PNET. CONCLUSIONS: One can forecast final <b>IQ</b> <b>score</b> based on the initial <b>IQ</b> <b>score,</b> dose of irradiation, and age at time of irradiation. Our findings should aid in the selection of appropriate therapy when whole-brain irradiation is needed...|$|R

40|$|Intelligence {{quotient}} (IQ) is {{the most}} widely used phenotype to characterize human cognitive abilities. Recent advances in studies on human intelligence have identified many new susceptibility genes. However, the genetic mechanisms involved in <b>IQ</b> <b>score</b> and the relationship between <b>IQ</b> <b>score</b> and the risk of mental disorders have won little attention. To address the genetic complexity of <b>IQ</b> <b>score,</b> we have developed IQdb ([URL] a publicly available database for exploring IQ-associated human genes. In total, we collected 158 experimental verified genes from literature as a core dataset in IQdb. In addition, 46 genomic regions related to <b>IQ</b> <b>score</b> have been curated from literature. Based on the core dataset and 46 confirmed linked genomic regions, more than 6932 potential IQ-related genes are expanded using data of protein-protein interactions. A systematic gene ranking approach was applied to all the collected and expanded genes to represent the relative importance of all the 7090 genes in IQdb. Our further systematic pathway analysis reveals that IQ-associated genes are significantly enriched in multiple signal events, especially related to cognitive systems. Of the 158 genes in the core dataset, 81 are involved in various psychotic and mental disorders. This comprehensive gene resource illustrates the importance of IQdb to our understanding on human intelligence, and highlights the utility of IQdb for elucidating the functions of IQ-associated genes and the cross-talk mechanisms among cognition-related pathways in some mental disorders for community. © The Author(s) 2013.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to identify the relationship between blood lead concentration and the intelligent quotient (IQ) of primary school children in Kuala Lumpur and Terengganu, Malaysia. The study respondents were 212 Malay children aged between 61 / 2 to 81 / 2 years old. Blood samples were taken from 162 children using a finger-pricked method and <b>IQ</b> <b>score</b> was measured with the 'McCarthy Scales of Children's Abilities Test' (MSCA). Blood lead concentration was analysed with a graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrophotometer. Results showed that the arithmetic mean of blood lead is 4. 3 ug/dL while the geometric mean is 3. 15 ug/dL. There is a significant inverse correlation between blood lead concentration with all of the MSCA IQ scales such as the verbal scale (p < 0. 01), perception-performancescale (p< 0. 01), quantitative scale (p< 0. 01), memory scale (p< 0. 01), motor scale (p< 0. 01) and general cognitive scale (p< 0. 01). Results from a multiple regression analysis showed a significant inverse relationship (b= - 35. 8, p< 0. 001) between blood lead concentration and <b>IQ</b> <b>score</b> after controlling for confounding factors. The variables with the greatest influence on <b>IQ</b> <b>score</b> are blood lead concentration (b= - 36. 6; p< 0. 001) and mother's education (b= 0. 75; p= 0. 006).
