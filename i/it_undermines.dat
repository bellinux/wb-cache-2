5|$|Yusuf {{has built}} a largely subservient and loyal {{apparatus}} by putting his fellow Majerteen clansmen in strategic positions. The National Security Agency (NSA) under General Mohamed Warsame (“Darwish”) and the so-called “Majerteen militia” units in the TFG army operate in parallel and often above other security agencies. Their exact number is hard to ascertain, but estimates suggest about 2,000. They are well catered for, well armed and often carry out counter-insurgency operations {{with little or no}} coordination with other security agencies. In the short term, this strategy may appear effective for the president, who can unilaterally employ the force essentially as he pleases. However, <b>it</b> <b>undermines</b> morale in the security services and is a cause of their high desertion rates.|$|E
5|$|First {{base was}} the highest paid {{position}} in 2010; regular starters at that position earned an average salary of $9,504,165 in compared to an overall average of $3,014,572. Pitcher Nolan Ryan was {{the first player to}} earn an annual salary above $1 million, signing a $4.5 million, 4-year contract with the Houston Astros in 1979. Kirby Puckett and Rickey Henderson signed the first contracts which paid an average of $3 million a year in November 1989, while 2010 was the first season where the MLB average salary rose above that same mark. Five of the twenty highest paid players in 2013 were members of the Yankees. Their team payroll for 2013 was $228,835,490, roughly $12 million above the second-largest Los Angeles Dodgers. The Yankees have drawn criticism for their payroll, with some claiming <b>it</b> <b>undermines</b> the parity of MLB.|$|E

The legal proceedings are being heard at the Second Circuit Court of Appeals in New York, and the South African Ministry of Justice is seeking dismissal of the case {{on the grounds that}} <b>it</b> <b>undermines</b> its national sovereignty.|$|E
50|$|The common {{platform}} {{shared by}} strands of Protestantism was quite unique, although their reasoning was quite different, mainstream Anglicans opposed the Maynooth Grant since <b>it</b> <b>undermined</b> the Established Church whereas non-conformists opposed it {{since they were}} opposed to all state religious establishments and Evangelicals opposed the bill since <b>it</b> <b>undermined</b> attempts to convert Irish Catholics to the Protestant Faith.The Maynooth Bill was introduced by Sir Robert Peel in April 1845.|$|R

25|$|Healthy {{humans have}} two kidneys, a {{redundancy}} that enables living donors (inter vivos) {{to give a}} kidney to someone who needs it. The most common transplants are to close relatives, but people have given kidneys to other friends. The rarest type of donation is the undirected donation whereby a donor gives a kidney to a stranger. Less than a few hundred of such kidney donations have been performed. In recent years, searching for altruistic donors via the internet has also become a way to find life saving organs. However, internet advertising for organs is a highly controversial practice, as some scholars believe <b>it</b> <b>undermines</b> the traditional list-based allocation system.|$|E
25|$|Because offsets {{provide a}} revenue stream for the {{reduction}} of some types of emissions, they can in some cases provide incentives to emit more, so that emitting entities can later get credit for reducing emissions from an artificially high baseline. This is especially the case for offsets with a high profit margin. For example, one Chinese company generated $500 million in carbon offsets by installing a $5million incinerator to burn the HFCs produced by the manufacture of refrigerants. The huge profits provided incentive to create new factories or expand existing factories solely {{for the purpose of}} increasing production of HFCs and then destroying the resultant pollutants to generate offsets. Not only is this outcome environmentally undesirable, <b>it</b> <b>undermines</b> other offset projects by causing offset prices to collapse. The practice had become so common that offset credits are now no longer awarded for new plants to destroy HFC-23.|$|E
500|$|Attorneys {{have argued}} that because digital {{evidence}} can theoretically be altered <b>it</b> <b>undermines</b> {{the reliability of the}} evidence. US judges are beginning to reject this theory, in the case US v. Bonallo the court ruled that [...] "the fact {{that it is possible to}} alter data contained in a computer is plainly insufficient to establish untrustworthiness." [...] In the United Kingdom guidelines such as those issued by ACPO are followed to help document the authenticity and integrity of evidence.|$|E

500|$|The {{doctrine}} {{came under}} criticism from many academics and judges, including Lord Scarman, Lord Denning, Lord Reid and Arthur Linton Corbin. As early as 1937 the Law Revision Committee {{recommended that the}} doctrine be completely abolished {{by an act of}} parliament. Lord Diplock called the doctrine [...] "an anachronistic shortcoming that has for many years been regarded as a reproach to English private law", and Stephen Guest wrote that [...] "t is said that it serves only to defeat the legitimate expectations of the third party, that <b>it</b> <b>undermines</b> the social interest of the community in the security of bargains and it is commercially inconvenient".|$|E
500|$|Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique {{gave the}} episode a mixed review and awarded it two stars out of four, {{calling it a}} disappointment. Vitaris heavily criticized Mulder's line: [...] "I'm not a psychologist"—reportedly an ad lib from Duchovny himself—noting that <b>it</b> <b>undermines</b> {{established}} continuity within the series including the character's background in psychology. Tom Kessenich, in his 2002 book Examination: An Unauthorized Look at Seasons 6–9 of the X-Files, praises the installment, saying, [...] "Place a devil in the plot and I'll follow you {{to see what you}} can cook up.... I enjoyed this tale of a devil looking to be just a normal dad immensely." [...] In his view the episode showed a return to the earlier horror-based narratives the series was known for; though he praises the casting of Campbell, he writes that moments between Mulder and Scully are lacking.|$|E
500|$|The {{question}} of Adeline's virtue is similarly complicated. Although she is forgiving {{to the point}} of absurdity, she is often considered more of a dupe than a martyr. Some have compared her to Balzac's title character in Le Père Goriot, who sacrifices himself for his daughters. As Bellos puts it: [...] "Adeline's complicity with Hector certainly makes her more interesting as a literary character, but <b>it</b> <b>undermines</b> her role as the symbol of virtue in the novel." [...] This complicity reaches an apex when she unsuccessfully attempts to sell her affections to Crevel (who has since lost interest) in order to repay her husband's debts. Her flirtation with prostitution is sometimes considered more egregious than Valérie's overt extortion, since Adeline is soiling her own dignity in the service of Baron Hulot's infidelity. For the remainder of the novel, Adeline trembles uncontrollably, a sign of her weakness. Later, when she visits the singer Josépha (on whom her husband once doted), Adeline is struck by the splendor earned by a life of materialistic seduction. She wonders aloud if she is capable of providing the carnal pleasures Hulot seeks outside of their home.|$|E

50|$|In 2007 a {{large number}} of U.S. nuclear arms control {{organizations}} sent a joint letter to Congress requesting that GNEP funding be terminated on the grounds that <b>it</b> <b>undermined</b> U.S. nuclear proliferation policy, would cost over $100 billion, and did not solve the nuclear waste problem.|$|R
500|$|Jason Kaufman, a Harvard {{professor}} who teaches {{the sociology of}} culture, wrote that MOBA {{is part of a}} social trend he calls [...] "annoyism", where mass media venues promote performances and artists who mix the deliberately bad with the clever. The Museum of Bad Art happens to embody this trend, and further illustrates its central aim to mock the judgment system by which people identify what is bad from what is not. For Kaufman, [...] "The beauty of MOBA—though beauty is surely the wrong word—is the way <b>it</b> <b>undermines</b> aesthetic criteria from numerous angles." [...] Amy Levin, describing how American history and culture have been shaped by small local museums, suggests that MOBA is a parody of art itself, and that MOBA's commentary, newsletter, website, and publications mock museums as authorities on what is good art. The director of the Ellipse Arts Center, a gallery in Arlington, Virginia, that hosted a traveling exhibition of MOBA works, was astonished to see people's exuberant laughter because no one visiting the Ellipse had ever responded to art this way. She observed, [...] "If I didn't have a sign on the door, people might not think it's so bad. Who's to say what's bad and what's good?" ...|$|E
500|$|Although {{the film}} is not {{essentially}} experimental, at several points <b>it</b> <b>undermines</b> the narrative reality. James Bernardoni notes Allen's way of opening the film by facing the camera, which immediately intrudes upon audience involvement in the film. In one famous scene, Allen's character, in line {{to see a movie}} with Annie, listens to a man behind him deliver misinformed pontifications on the significance of Fellini's and Marshall McLuhan's work. Allen pulls McLuhan himself from just off camera to personally correct the man's errors. Later in the film, when we see Annie and Alvy in their first extended talk, [...] "mental subtitles" [...] convey to the audience the characters' nervous inner doubts. An animated scene—with artwork based on the comic strip Inside Woody Allen—depicts Alvy and Annie in the guise of the Wicked Queen from Snow White. Although Allen uses each of these techniques only once, the [...] "fourth wall" [...] is broken several other times when characters address the camera directly. In one, Alvy stops several passers-by to ask questions about love, and in another he shrugs off writing a happy ending to his relationship with Annie in his autobiographical first play as forgivable [...] "wish-fulfillment." [...] Allen chose to have Alvy break the fourth wall, he explained, [...] "because I felt many {{of the people in the}} audience had the same feelings and the same problems. I wanted to talk to them directly and confront them." ...|$|E
2500|$|Professor Michael King stated, [...] "The {{conclusion}} {{reached by}} scientists who {{have investigated the}} origins and stability of sexual orientation {{is that it is}} a human characteristic that is formed early in life, and is resistant to change. Scientific evidence on the origins of homosexuality is considered relevant to theological and social debate because <b>it</b> <b>undermines</b> suggestions that sexual orientation is a choice." ...|$|E

2500|$|Critics {{argue that}} the {{practice}} of restoring the St. Basil's scene and all the cuts that Mussorgsky made when revising the opera—that is, creating a [...] "supersaturated" [...] version—can have negative consequences, believing that it destroys the symmetrical scene structure of the Revised Version, <b>it</b> <b>undermines</b> the composer's carefully devised and subtle system of leitmotiv deployment, and results in the overexposure of the Dmitriy motive.|$|E

2500|$|Certain naturopathic {{treatments}} {{offered by}} naturopaths, such as homeopathy, rolfing, and iridology, are widely considered pseudoscience or quackery. Stephen Barrett of QuackWatch and the National Council Against Health Fraud {{has stated that}} naturopathy is [...] "simplistic and that its practices are riddled with quackery". [...] "Non-scientific health care practitioners, including naturopaths, use unscientific methods and deception on a public who, lacking in-depth health care knowledge, must rely upon the assurance of providers. Quackery not only harms people, <b>it</b> <b>undermines</b> the ability to conduct scientific research and should be opposed by scientists", says William T. Jarvis.|$|E

2500|$|A second protest {{took place}} at 9 October 2015 at Sun Yat-sen Place, outside the {{university}} library. It was co-organised by the Students' Union, the HKU Academic Staff Association, the HKU Alumni Concern Group, and 18 professional institutes representing lawyers, accountants, surveyors, information technology workers, nurses, social workers, psychologists, and other professions. The organisers called the council's decision [...] "unprecedented and naked political interference" [...] in university affairs and said that <b>it</b> <b>undermines</b> [...] "Hong Kong values" [...] in demonstrating that hard work and competence may be worthless if you have political views deemed unacceptable by the establishment.|$|E
2500|$|Paul {{believes}} that illegal immigrants {{should not be}} given an [...] "unfair advantage" [...] under law. He has advocated for a [...] "coherent immigration policy", and has spoken strongly against amnesty for illegal aliens because he believes <b>it</b> <b>undermines</b> the rule of law, grants pardons to lawbreakers, and subsidizes more illegal immigration. Paul voted for the Secure Fence Act of 2006, authorizing an additional 700 miles (1100 kilometers) of double-layered fencing between the U.S. and Mexico mainly because he wanted enforcement {{of the law and}} opposed amnesty, not because he supported the construction of a border fence.|$|E
2500|$|Young Earth creationists {{including}} Ken Ham criticise theistic evolution on theological grounds, {{finding it}} hard to reconcile {{the nature of a}} loving God with the process of evolution, in particular, the existence of death and suffering before the Fall of Man.
