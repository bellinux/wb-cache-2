5|$|In round four, Judah {{landed a}} {{right hand to}} the head that caused Mayweather to retreat to the ropes and cover up. The {{momentum}} changed in the fifth round, when Mayweather hurt Judah with a combination to the face. Then Mayweather landed a right hand {{on the bridge of}} Judah's nose, and blood began to flow. The seventh round was the most dominant for Mayweather to that point. Once again, he drew blood from Judah's nose. A combination from Mayweather backed Judah <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>corner,</b> and Judah's foot movement was considerably slower than it had been earlier in the fight.|$|E
5|$|Players can utilize Kinect to look <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>corner</b> using a {{new head}} {{tracking}} feature. This allows them to look toward the apex of a corner or at nearby cars. The controller or steering wheel is used to control the car while Kinect is used independently for viewing around the driver. Players can also use Kinect as a game controller. In this setting the game automatically accelerates and decelerates the player's vehicle utilizing {{a modified version of}} the feature known as Auto Brake in Forza Motorsport 3. The steering is controlled by placing the players arms out as if controlling an invisible steering wheel. Kinect will allow the player to use voice commands to start races and navigate menus.|$|E
5|$|Early in {{the race}} John Downie crashed into a pub in Ballasalla, but the car did not sustain {{extensive}} damage {{and he was able}} to continue the race. At Keppel Gate on the Mountain Road, Frederick Bennett, who had been unable to take part in the practice sessions and therefore did not know the course very well, approached a corner with too much speed in his Cadillac and crashed, ripping off two of the wheels. Bennett managed to stay in the vehicle and avoided serious injury. Another driver to go off the track was J. Hadley in his Wolseley, who also carried too much speed <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>corner,</b> leading him to drive off through a hedge and into a field. The Thornycroft driven by Tom Thornycroft had been following closely behind, and the two cars collided during the incident, damaging one of the Thornycroft's rear wheels. Napier in his Arrol-Johnston made the quickest circuit of the first lap in one hour, 32 minutes and 36 seconds.|$|E

5|$|In {{the fifth}} match Matt Hardy faced Edge, who was {{accompanied}} by Lita, inside a Steel Cage. As the bell rang, Hardy tried to throw Edge face-first into the cage wall but didn't succeed. Back and forth action took place until Hardy got the advantage over Edge. Lita began to climb up {{the outside of the}} cage, but Hardy hit the cage, making Lita fall off. As Lita distracted Hardy, Edge started to crawl out. Hardy noticed this, grabbed Edge, and threw him <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>corner.</b> Lita interfered, which led to Hardy delivering a Twist of Fate to Lita. Edge executed a Spear on Hardy for a near-fall. After knocking Edge off the turnbuckle, Hardy delivered a leg drop {{off the top of the}} cage before pinning Edge for the win.|$|E
5|$|Little was not {{the first}} to gain and lose his fortune in the stock market, but he was a {{pioneering}} speculator, the first to rely on his ability to predict market fluctuations to inform his speculations instead of bidding with what would today be considered insider information. He was the first Great Bear; before his rapid rise speculation and market manipulation was virtually unknown in the stock market, as no one before him had had the still nerve and financial foresight necessary to profit from such risky endeavors, and many market historians consider him the first modern stock market tycoon. His ability to gain and lose fortunes on a day-by-day basis was a microcosm of the meteoric possibilities and insecurities of speculation, and after his death and even during his life many other investors tried to imitate his success, with little success. His victory over the Erie Railroad scheme (and market cornering activities in general) inspired similar plots in the years thereafter; in 1863 the industrialist Cornelius Vanderbilt successfully cornered the Harlem Railroad {{in much the same way}} that Little had done almost thirty years earlier, and fell <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>corner</b> trap formed by Daniel Drew and others himself in the later Erie War. This did much to give credence to convertible bonds, then still a novelty.|$|E
5|$|On August 2, 2008, Judah lost to Joshua Clottey by {{technical}} {{decision in}} a fight for the vacant IBF Welterweight title at the Palms Casino Resort in Las Vegas. Judah began the busier fighter, showing quick hands and throwing effective combinations behind a jab. Clottey began steadily closing the distance between himself and his opponent from the third round, landing {{an increasing number of}} punches that took their toll on Judah. In round four, Clottey landed an uppercut that caused Judah to lose his balance, {{and by the end of}} the round, Judah had blood running down his nose. Judah staged a comeback in the sixth round, but in the middle of the seventh round, Clottey landed a right hand that hurt Judah and caused him to back <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>corner.</b> In round nine, Judah suffered a cut over his right eye and the fight was stopped after he said he could not see. The referee had ruled the cut was caused by an accidental clash of heads and so the fight went to the scorecards. Two judges scored the fight 86–85 and the other judge scored it 87–84, all in favor of Clottey.|$|E

25|$|Holyfield {{started the}} fight aggressively, {{pressing}} the 46-year-old Nielsen into {{the ropes and}} landing several hard jabs and hooks, knocking him down in the 3rd round. Despite getting a swollen eye in the 4th round, Nielsen kept on clowning to provoke Holyfield throughout the bout, prompting his trainer, Paul Duvill, to beg him to stop fooling around and focus on Holyfield. In round 10, Nielsen pushed a tired-looking Holyfield into the ropes {{with a series of}} combinations, before Holyfield turned it around. Holyfield pushed Nielsen <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>corner</b> and battered him with combinations until the referee stopped the contest.|$|E

25|$|Historian Harvey Klehr {{indicates}} that {{membership of the}} WAA did exhibit growth after unification, however, in large measure {{as a result of}} growth of the WPA jobs program and the ability of now employed WPA workers to pay the relatively nominal dues of the WAA. Despite misgivings about painting itself <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>corner</b> as a de facto trade union for WPA employees, it seems that in practice the WAA became exactly that, with WPA employees constituting some 75 percent of the organization's dues paying membership by 1939. The survival of the WAA was thus intimately linked with the fate of the WPA program, with periodic layoffs of WPA workers due to budgetary constraints playing havoc with the WAA's membership rolls.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time, Alexios's betrothed Maria died, age four, and his {{connection}} to Theophilos became tenuous. He was also accused by some Sicilians of colluding with the Arabs and planning to become emperor himself. To avoid forcing his Caesar <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>corner,</b> Theophilos sent Theodore Crithinus, Archbishop of Syracuse, to recall him under guarantees of personal safety. Nevertheless, upon {{his arrival in}} the capital, Alexios was stripped of his titles, beaten, and imprisoned. Theodore Crithinus publicly confronted the emperor for his breach of his word at the Church of St. Mary of Blachernae, but the enraged Theophilos had him beaten and exiled as well. Soon, however, the Patriarch John the Grammarian too publicly berated Theophilos. The emperor relented, released both Theodore and Alexios, and restored the latter to his rank and property.|$|E
25|$|Bugti was {{involved}} in a struggle, at times armed, for greater autonomy for Balochistan. The government of Pakistan accused him of keeping a private militia and leading a guerrilla war against the state. On 26 August 2006, Bugti, along with some personnel of the Pakistan army, was killed when his hide-out cave, located in Kohlu, about 150 miles east of Quetta, collapsed after an explosion set off by a Pakistan Army commander, although the Chief of Army Staff at the time, General Pervez Musharraf, claimed that Akbar Bugti was backed <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>corner</b> by the Pakistani Army and decided to blow himself up, instead of facing court for the atrocities he committed against rival tribes. His death lead to widespread unrest in the area and a surge in discussion, a polarising figure with both supporters and opponents.|$|E

25|$|In August, the Japanese 48th Division—commanded by Lieutenant General Yuitsu Tsuchihashi—began {{arriving}} from the Philippines and garrisoned Kupang, Dili and Malacca, relieving the Ito detachment. Tsuchihashi then launched a major counter-offensive {{in an attempt}} to push the Australians <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>corner</b> on the south coast of the island. Strong Japanese columns moved south—two from Dili and one from Manatuto on the northeast coast. Another moved eastward from Dutch Timor to attack Dutch positions in the central south of the island. The offensive ended on 19 August when the main Japanese force was withdrawn to Rabaul, but not before they secured the central town of Maubisse and the southern port of Beco. The Japanese were also recruiting significant numbers of Timorese civilians, who provided intelligence on Allied movements. Meanwhile, also in late-August, a parallel conflict began when the Maubisse rebelled against the Portuguese.|$|E
25|$|The Southern Song dynasty, {{wishing to}} give the Jin dynasty the coup de grâce, {{declared}} war upon the Jurchens, and placed a large army in the field. The remainder of the Jin army took shelter in Caizhou, where they were closely besieged by the Mongols {{on one side and}} the Song army on the other. Driven thus <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>corner,</b> the Jurchens fought with the courage of despair and long held out against the combined efforts of their enemies. At last, Emperor Aizong saw that the struggle could not be prolonged, and he prepared himself to end his life. When the enemy breached the city walls, Emperor Aizong committed suicide after passing the throne to his general Wanyan Chenglin. Wanyan Chenglin, historically known as Emperor Mo, ruled for less than a day before he was finally killed in battle. Thus the Jin dynasty came to an end in the year 1234.|$|E
25|$|On 22 June, between {{eleven and}} twelve o'clock, Erdődy and Auersperg's forces {{attacked}} Ottoman positions {{with the army}} of Erdödy in front, consisting of Croatian hussars and infantry.

Then the soldiers of Colonel Auersperg joined the attack followed by Eggenberg's and other commanders' men, forcing the Ottomans back towards the Kupa River. The army of Hasan Pasha was driven <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>corner</b> between the rivers Odra and the Kupa, with the bridge across Kupa taken by soldiers from Karlovac. The Sisak garrison led by Blaž Đurak attacked the remaining Ottoman forces that were besieging Sisak. Caught in the middle between two Christian army flanks, the Ottomans panicked and started a chaotic retreat, trying to swim across the Kupa River and reach their camp. The bulk of the army {{with most of the}} commanders were either slaughtered or drowned in the river.|$|E

25|$|Klitschko {{defeated}} WBO Heavyweight Champion Sultan Ibragimov at Madison Square Garden in New York City on 23 February 2008 {{to unify}} the IBF, IBO and WBO Heavyweight titles. The Klitschko-Ibragimov fight was the first heavyweight unification since Holyfield-Lewis in 1999. The unification clash with Ibragimov {{proved to be a}} huge disappointment for fans. Klitschko was very dominant from the first bell. He backed Ibragimov <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>corner</b> and proceeded to push down Ibragimov's glove with his left hand so he could not throw a punch. Though Klitschko won every single round, the crowd in New York City began booing after the second round. The boos and jeers increased as the fight progressed in the same fashion. Ibragimov's corner was almost silent from the sixth round onwards, unable to give their man any meaningful advice. Klitschko did not fight again in the United States until 2015 where he defeated Bryant Jennings.|$|E
25|$|Up until 1918, Lalonde cleverly used a {{specific}} rule of hockey – which stipulated that goaltenders could not drop {{to their knees}} to block shots – to compliment his superb accuracy. Coming off the right wing or down the centre, he would unleash a “wicked knee-high shot” which would catch the opposing goalie between the glove – or stick – and pad. This shot placement was deliberately done in order to slow down a goalie’s reaction time; they were often unable to decide between using their glove hand or blocker hand to deflect or catch the puck, and shuffling to {{one side or the}} other to use their pads. Lalonde’s snapper was so lethal that opposing coaches would often assign three to four of their own players just to shadow him, and – in one of the earliest iterations of the trap – attempt to pin him <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>corner</b> in order to prevent his being able to get into a scoring position.|$|E
25|$|Reindeer (or caribou) (also called tuttu by the Greenlandic Inuit and rensdyr or rener by Danes) are {{the only}} deer species in which both sexes have antlers. Greenland animals can vary {{considerably}} in size, with females weighing up to 90kg (198lb) and the males ("bulls") 150kg (331lb). Other species of reindeer can be larger or smaller. In Greenland both sexes may be hunted. Although they have antlers, they rarely use them against humans, even when backed <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>corner</b> by the Sami people who herd, milk, and slaughter them for food in other lands. Their usual defense against humans is to pull away or flee, often uphill. Males use their antlers when sparring against each other, and reindeer may use them {{as a last resort}} to defend themselves and their young against predators such as wolves, although wolves present no threat in southwestern Greenland. Although rarely aggressive toward humans, when in rut bulls will defend their harems from other bulls, and when humans come between a bull and his harem, attacks have been recorded.|$|E
