5|$|The mid-1970s saw the {{beginning}} of a new wave of Canadian comics, one in which the creators chose to remain in Canada, rather than seeking their fortunes south of the border. Richard Comely's Captain Canuck appeared in July 1975, the first appearance of a non-satirical superhero in Canada since the 1940s. During the 1950s and 1960s, the idea of native comics seemed unattainable to Canadian <b>kids,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> appearance of Captain Canuck gave these kids the optimism to make their own. This was followed up with James Waley's more professional, newsstand-distributed Orb, which featured a number of talents that would later take part in the North American comics scene.|$|E

500|$|Rowan Kaiser of The A.V.

[...] He added {{that while the}} main plot [...] "loses some momentum at the conclusion, [...] keeps from sinking thanks to {{a steady stream of}} great lines going throughout."

[...] He also praised the episode's guest voice actors, citing in particular Bill Hader's character Mickey as [...] "very odd, but so much fun"; Bonaime gave [...] "Bob Fires the Kids" [...] an overall grade of 8.3 out of 10. Jen Johnson, writing for Den of Geek, also cited Mickey as a highlight of the episode, stating: [...] "I would say that I hope {{this is the end}} of Mickey and the chaos he brings to the Belcher family, but [...] was just too much fun.

[...] The following year, Ruth discovered that, at 45, she was expecting her fourth child. However, the pregnancy ended in a miscarriage.|$|E

500|$|Many {{critics were}} {{complimentary}} {{in regards to}} the series' art style. In his website Lineboil, Aaron Simpson compared it to Garbage Pail <b>Kids</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> works of Don Martin, two elements of his childhood. Amid Amidi of Cartoon Brew called Robertryan Cory's character designs [...] "impressive" [...] and [...] "distinctively styled", though he felt the art style's complexity made the limited animation quality suffer as a result. Abby Koenig of Houston Press compared its [...] "ridiculous" [...] nature to the film Little Monsters, and proposed that Howie Mandel (featured in the latter work) guest voice a monster on the show. Shannon O'Leary of Publishers Weekly wrote that the show, along with others on the network such as Adventure Time and Superjail!, bore resemblance to the aesthetics of established independent comics artists. Meanwhile, Jason Krell of io9 considered it a failure despite its influences from Adventure Time, which made way for many successful original series on the network.|$|E
500|$|On her arrival, Susan was {{described}} as being [...] "staid" [...] and more open-minded than her husband, Karl. Woodburne told the Soap Show that Susan is a [...] "good mum" [...] who means well. Her children are her number one priority and she overcompensate's for her husband's disciplinarian style. This {{has led to a}} Holy Soap writer describing Susan as [...] "the mother hen of the street". Network Ten say that Susan is the [...] "heart and soul of Erinsborough", with a good sense of humour and the skills of a ninja. Susan has been through a [...] "rough ride". She has had to cope with Karl's infidelity, a divorce, her second husband dying hours after their wedding, being betrayed by her nephew and revealing that she killed her mother. TV Week said [...] "But, through it all, Susan has often provided a home for people in trouble, including a number of the Timmins <b>kids</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> kids of her dead husband." [...] This has made her one of the most [...] "enigmatic and appealing characters" [...] within the show.|$|E
500|$|Of the {{original}} reviewers, Nicholas Dean Des Barres of DieHard GameFan wrote that EarthBound {{was not as}} impressive as Final Fantasy III, although just as fun. He praised the game's humor and wrote that the game completely defied his first impressions. Des Barres wrote that [...] "past the graphics", which were purposefully 8-bit for nostalgia, the game is not an [...] "entry level" [...] or a [...] "child's" [...] RPG, but [...] "highly intelligent" [...] and [...] "captivating". The Brazilian Super GamePower explained that those expecting a Dungeons and Dragons-style RPG will be disappointed by the childish visuals, which were unlike other 16-bit games. They wrote that the American humor was too mature and that the gameplay was too immature, as if for beginners. GamePro gave the game a mixed review, commenting that [...] "he lack of a convincing story line and the dull NES-clone graphics ... will make serious RPG fans a little cautious about approaching EarthBound". They said the [...] "saving graces are the fairly good music" [...] and [...] "hilarious adult humor" [...] but added that [...] "the humor is too mature for little <b>kids,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> gameplay is too immature for older gamers." ...|$|E

500|$|After Lollapalooza, {{the band}} {{embarked}} on a worldwide tour, which was supported by Moby. Tensions continued to increase and {{when asked if the}} band hated touring, Cornell said, [...] "We really enjoy it to a point and then it gets tedious, because it becomes repetitious. You feel like fans have paid their money and they expect you to come out and play them your songs like the first time you ever played them. That's the point where we hate touring." [...] The band was criticized for its lack of energy while performing. Cornell said that [...] "after a number of years, you start to feel like you're acting. All those people who criticize us for not jumping around should shut the fuck up, and when they come to our shows they should jump around and entertain us for a while." [...] Thayil had an issue with how the band's audience had changed, stating that [...] "nowadays, you also have the <b>kids</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> housewives, the casual fans. With your casual fans, you say, 'Thanks for the money.' And they say, 'Thanks for the song.'" [...] The band's concerts in December 1996 were postponed for a week due to Cornell's throat problems.|$|E
500|$|Reyes {{said that}} the album was written solely for [...] "fun {{and the love of}} music, no expectations." [...] Their lyrics were {{inspired}} by personal experience. Nolan and Lazzara had a concept where some of the lyrics could be read [...] "like a play where one line is the boy and the next line is the girl ... Sometimes when you read the lyrics it's a little boring and it's more interesting this way". About half their song titles, according to Nolan, came from [...] "sitting around late at night watching TV". The title of [...] "Cute Without the 'E' (Cut from the Team)" [...] came when a friend of the band said that someone he knew was [...] "cut from the team". [...] "Great Romances of the 20th Century" [...] includes an audio sample from the film, Beautiful Girls (1996). Lazzara said [...] "The Blue Channel" [...] and [...] "Head Club" [...] were songs that the band used [...] "to get enough songs to fill a record so we could go on tour". The album's sound would later be described as emo. Around this time, Taking Back Sunday was influenced by emo bands the Get Up <b>Kids</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Promise Ring.|$|E
500|$|American Life {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from music critics, holding {{a score of}} 60/100on music review website Metacritic, based on 17 professional reviews. Billboards Michael Paoletta noted the lyrical differences from past albums such as Ray of Light positively, saying [...] "American Life relies less on spiritual introspection and more on woman-in-the-mirror confrontation." [...] Entertainment Weeklys Ken Tucker generally responded well, saying that at its best, the album offers blunt, questing and decisive music but the weakest point was Madonna sounding like a girl who's grown content {{with her husband and}} <b>kids</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> ability to hire help to do her bidding. Dimitri Ebrlich of Vibe magazine gave a positive review for American Life, saying that Madonna [...] "stayed still" [...] in the album, and commenting that [...] "This may be the first time Madonna hasn't pushed herself to explore new ground, but at least she's chosen a good place to rest." [...] Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine gave the album a mixed review, stating that American Life is not a [...] "masterpiece" [...] compared to her 1992 studio album, Erotica. [...] "It's frequently self-indulgent, misguided, unpleasant, difficult to listen to, silly and humorless, but it's also consistent, uncompromising and unapologetic," [...] Cinquemani opined, ending with the deduction that American Life stood for the last time Madonna made music without the primary objective of making a hit.|$|E
