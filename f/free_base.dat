5|$|Several {{currently}} prescribed amphetamine formulations contain both enantiomers, including Adderall, AdderallXR, Mydayis, , DyanavelXR, and Evekeo, {{the last}} of which contains racemic amphetamine sulfate. Amphetamine is also prescribed in enantiopure and prodrug form as dextroamphetamine and lisdexamfetamine respectively. Lisdexamfetamine is structurally different from amphetamine, and is inactive until it metabolizes into dextroamphetamine. The <b>free</b> <b>base</b> of racemic amphetamine was previously available as Benzedrine, Psychedrine, and Sympatedrine. Levoamphetamine was previously available as Cydril. Many current amphetamine pharmaceuticals are salts due to the comparatively high volatility of the <b>free</b> <b>base.</b> However, oral suspension and orally disintegrating tablet (ODT) dosage forms composed of the <b>free</b> <b>base</b> were introduced in 2015 and 2016, respectively. Some of the current brands and their generic equivalents are listed below.|$|E

5|$|Like most amines, {{dopamine}} is {{an organic}} base. As a base, {{it is generally}} protonated in acidic environments (in an acid-base reaction). The protonated form is highly water-soluble and relatively stable, but can become oxidized if exposed to oxygen or other oxidants. In basic environments, dopamine is not protonated. In this <b>free</b> <b>base</b> form, it is less water-soluble and also more highly reactive. Because of the increased stability and water-solubility of the protonated form, dopamine is supplied for chemical or pharmaceutical use as dopamine hydrochloride—that is, the hydrochloride salt that is created when dopamine is combined with hydrochloric acid. In dry form, dopamine hydrochloride is a fine colorless powder.|$|E
25|$|The optical {{rotation}} {{of a given}} enantiomer of ketamine can vary between its salts and <b>free</b> <b>base</b> form. The <b>free</b> <b>base</b> form of (S)‑ketamine exhibits dextrorotation and is therefore labelled (S)‑(+)‑ketamine. However, its hydrochloride salt shows levorotation and is thus labelled (S)‑(−)‑ketamine hydrochloride. The difference originates from the conformation of the cyclohexanone ring. In both the <b>free</b> <b>base</b> and the hydrochloride, the cyclohexanone ring adopts a chair conformation, but {{the orientation of the}} substituents varies. In the <b>free</b> <b>base,</b> the o-chlorophenyl group adopts an equatorial position and the methylamino group adopts an axial position. In the hydrochloride salt, the positions are reversed, with the o-chlorophenyl group axial and the methylamino group equatorial. Not all salts of ketamine show different {{optical rotation}} to the free base: (S)-ketamine (R,R)-tartrate is levorotatory, like (S)‑ketamine.|$|E
