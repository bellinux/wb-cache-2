5|$|Latin {{writers were}} {{immersed}} in the Greek literary tradition, and adapted its forms and much of its content, but Romans regarded satire as a genre in which they surpassed the Greeks. Horace wrote verse satires before <b>fashioning</b> himself as an Augustan court poet, and the early Principate also produced the satirists Persius and Juvenal.

5|$|Durga Puja is the biggest, {{most popular}} and widely celebrated festival in West Bengal. The five-day-long {{colourful}} Hindu festival witnesses intense celebration across the state. Pandals are erected in various cities, towns and villages throughout West Bengal. The whole city of Kolkata undergoes a transformation during Durga Puja, as it is decked up in lighting decorations and thousands of colourful pandals are set up where effigies of goddess Durga and her four children are worshipped and displayed. The idols of the goddess as brought in from Kumortuli, where idol-makers work round the year <b>fashioning</b> the clay-models of the goddess. Since independence in 1947, Durga Puja has slowly changed into more of a glamorous carnival than a religious festival, where people across diverse religious and ethnic spectrum partake in the festivity.

5|$|Sir Douglas Mawson's air-tractor sledge was a {{converted}} fixed-wing aircraft {{taken on the}} 1911–14 Australasian Antarctic Expedition, the first plane {{to be taken to}} the Antarctic. Expedition leader Douglas Mawson had planned to use the Vickers R.E.P. Type Monoplane as a reconnaissance and search and rescue tool, and to assist in publicity, but the aircraft crashed heavily during a test flight in Adelaide, Australia, only two months before Mawson's scheduled departure date. The plane was nevertheless sent south with the expedition, after having been stripped of its wings and metal sheathing from the fuselage. Engineer Frank Bickerton spent most of the 1912 winter working to convert it to a sledge, <b>fashioning</b> brakes from a pair of geological drills and a steering system from the plane's landing gear. It was first tested on 15November 1912 and subsequently assisted in laying depots for the summer sledging parties, but its use during the expedition was minimal.|$|E
5|$|Valiente {{learned of}} the non-Gardnerian Wiccan Charles Cardell from a 1958 article, and {{subsequently}} struck up a correspondence with him. Cardell suggested that they pool their respective traditions together, but Valiente declined the offer, expressing some scepticism regarding Cardell's motives and conduct. In 1962, Valiente began a correspondence course run by Raymond Howard, a former associate of Cardell's; this course instructed her in a Wiccan tradition known as the Coven of Atho. At Halloween 1963 she was then initiated into the Coven of Atho in a ritual overseen by Howard, entering the lowest rank of the course, that of 'Sarsen', and beginning to copy the teachings that she received into notebooks, where {{she was able to}} identify many of the sources from which Howard had drawn upon in <b>fashioning</b> his tradition.|$|E

40|$|Both {{the theory}} of {{top-down}} penetration of <b>fashion</b> consumption (Veblen - Simmel model) and {{the theory of}} bottom-up <b>fashion</b> consumption have been found consistent with the consumer behavior in the China’s <b>fashion</b> consumer market and the trend of such behavior keeps growing. Therefore, {{it is necessary to}} carry out a study on <b>fashion</b> consumption {{to meet the needs of}} the development of real life and <b>fashion</b> consumption. Firstly, we describe the content of <b>fashion</b> consumption, discuss the connotation and main features of <b>fashion</b> and analyze the relationship among <b>fashion,</b> innovation, classic and prevalence; namely, innovation is the pioneer of <b>fashion</b> while the classic is the denotation of faded <b>fashion</b> and prevalence is the continuance of <b>fashion.</b> Secondly, we examine the psychological motivations and behavioral mechanisms of <b>fashion</b> consumption, pointing out that the psychological motivations of <b>fashion</b> consumption is showing-off and it is of symbolic significance. The general characteristics of <b>fashion</b> buyers and consumer characteristics including the elegant <b>fashion,</b> the popular <b>fashion,</b> the cool <b>fashion</b> and the Bobos <b>fashion</b> are presented. We put forward a decision-making process in <b>fashion</b> consumption according to the influence of <b>fashion,</b> the extent of consumer involvement and the purchase decision time. Finally, by analyzing the <b>fashion</b> consumption behavior of the Chinese consumers, we point out that the core of the cool <b>fashion</b> or the Bobo <b>fashion</b> is actually not materialism and both cool <b>fashion</b> and Bobo <b>fashion</b> will have a profound influence in the <b>fashion</b> consumption in the future...|$|R
5|$|Most Egyptian deities {{represent}} {{natural or}} social phenomena. The gods were generally {{said to be}} immanent in these phenomena—to be present within nature. The types of phenomena they represented include physical places and objects as well as abstract concepts and forces. The god Shu was the deification of all the world's air; the goddess Meretseger oversaw a limited region of the earth, the Theban Necropolis; and the god Sia personified the abstract notion of perception. Major gods often had many roles and were involved in several types of phenomena. For instance, Khnum was the god of Elephantine Island {{in the midst of}} the Nile, the river that was essential to Egyptian civilization. He was credited with producing the annual Nile flood that fertilized the nation's farmland. Perhaps as an outgrowth of this life-giving function, he was said to create all living things, <b>fashioning</b> their bodies on a potter's wheel. Gods could share the same role in nature; Ra, Atum, Khepri, Horus, and other deities acted as sun gods. Despite their diverse functions, most gods had an overarching role in common: maintaining maat, the universal order that was a central principle of Egyptian religion and was itself personified as a goddess. But some deities represented disruption to maat. Most prominently, Apep was the force of chaos, constantly threatening to annihilate the order of the universe, and Set was an ambivalent member of divine society who could both fight disorder and foment it.|$|E

30|$|Because the <b>fashion</b> {{adoption}} process evolves {{in stages}} prompted first by {{introduction of new}} styles or variations of existing styles, consumers can be segmented according to <b>fashion</b> leadership as <b>fashion</b> leaders or <b>fashion</b> followers (Workman and Freeburg 2009). Compared to <b>fashion</b> followers, <b>fashion</b> leaders are higher in <b>fashion</b> innovativeness and opinion leadership. <b>Fashion</b> leaders are comprised of three groups that affect the speed and trajectory of <b>fashion</b> adoption: <b>fashion</b> innovators (willing to adopt new <b>fashion</b> styles relatively early in the <b>fashion</b> life cycle), <b>fashion</b> opinion leaders (give advice, act as an information source, and thereby, influence others’ purchase decisions), and innovative communicators who combine both roles.|$|R

25|$|After her marriage, Dolores {{adopted the}} severe {{masculine}} style of dress and hair popular at that time, appearing in Eve, The Lady's Pictorial in 1925 {{in a suit}} jacket and tie.

25|$|Transsexual self-identified people {{sometimes}} wish to undergo physical surgery to refashion their primary sexual characteristics, secondary characteristics, or both, {{because they feel}} {{they will be more}} comfortable with different genitalia. This may involve removal of penis, testicles or breasts, or the <b>fashioning</b> of a penis, vagina or breasts. In the past, sex assignment surgery has been performed on infants who are born with ambiguous genitalia. However, current medical opinion is strongly against this procedure, since many adults have regretted that these decisions were made for them at birth. Today, sex reassignment surgery is performed on people who choose to have this change so that their anatomical sex will match their gender identity.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the name}} of a {{particular}} Proto-Indo-European smith god cannot be linguistically reconstructed, it is highly probable that the Proto-Indo-Europeans had a smith deity of some kind since smith gods occur in nearly every Indo-European culture, with examples including the Hittite god Hasammili, the Vedic god Tvastr, the Greek god Hephaestus, the Germanic villain Wayland the Smith, and the Ossetian culture figure Kurdalagon. Many of these smith figures share certain characteristics in common. Hephaestus, the Greek god of blacksmiths, and Wayland the Smith, a nefarious blacksmith from Germanic mythology, are both described as lame.
