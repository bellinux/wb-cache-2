Becausee degradation driven by visible or UVB radiation alone is uncoupled from PS II redox status, it was therefore assumed that the mixed-light-amplified component of degradation would behave similarly. Surprisingly, amplified degradation proved to be coupled tightly to the redox status of PS II. We show that inactivation of the PS II water oxidation by heat shock or oxidation of the plastosemiquinone (QA) by silicomolybdate nullifies only the <b>amplified</b> <b>component</b> of degradation but not the basic rates of degradation under PAR or UVB alone.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{deals with}} a joint {{estimation}} algorithm that is dedicated to digital compensation of transmitter leakage pollution in frequency division duplexing transceivers. These transceivers are affected by transmitter to receiver signal leakage. Combined with the nonlinearity of <b>amplifying</b> <b>components</b> in the receiver path, the baseband signal received can be severely polluted by a baseband polluting term. This term {{is based on the}} square modulus of the transmitted signal, and it depends on the equivalent transmitter leakage channel which models leakages and the receiver path. Here, we consider a nonconvolutive, time-varying channel that is modeled by a time-varying complex gain and the presence of a fractional delay, modeling the propagation effects into the receiver. The complex gain is a sum of two components, a constant term that models static effects, and a first-order autoregressive model that approximates the time variation of the transmitter leakage channel. We focus here on a fully digital approach, using digital signal processing techniques and knowledge of the transmitted samples to mitigate the pollution. We first express the asymptotic performance of a transmitter leakage gain estimator piloted by a reference-based least-mean-square (LMS) approach in the synchronized case, and then we derive the influence of the fractional delay. We show that, in practice, the fractional delay cannot be neglected, and we propose a joint estimation of the fractional delay and the transmitter leakage gain to perform digital compensation. The proposed method is adaptive, recursive and online, and it has low complexity. This algorithm, that is developed for a flat transmitter leakage channel case, is seen to be robust in a typical selective channel simulation case, and more suitable than a classic multi-tap LMS scheme proposed in the literature...|$|R
40|$|As a basic emotion, disgust is {{proposed}} to have unique physiological, behavioral, subjective, and cognitive correlates and consequences (Izard, 1993; 1992). Considerable research {{over the past}} decade has examined the distinct subjective, behavioral, and physiological components of disgust (c. f., Olatunji & Sawchuk, 2005). Moreover, disgust emerges as a basic emotion whether considered in terms of facial expressions (Ekman & Friesen, 1975), semantic content (Johnson-Laird & Oatley, 1989), or a combination of variables (Izard, 1977; Scherer, 1986). At the same time, there has been a paucity of research examining the cognitive components or information processing biases involved in disgust, or the cognitive mechanisms by which adaptive disgust reactions may become pathological. A Cognitive Approach A cognitive approach to disgust refers to both (1) the appraisals, beliefs, and biases associated with disgust and (2) the information processing biases associated with disgust. Cognitive processes have received considerable empirical attention in the anxiety disorders, with research typically demonstrating biases in attention, interpretation, and implicit memory.
