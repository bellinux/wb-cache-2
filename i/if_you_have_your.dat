6000|$|... "Where my lord goes I go," [...] {{answered}} the Levite gravely. [...] "Moreover, Prince, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>your</b> reasons for wishing {{to see this}} devil-worship, I may have mine." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps," [...] she said; [...] "but I ask for {{no answer}} to my questions. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>your</b> secrets, why may I not have mine? Now will you {{meet me at the}} Kaims?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "As {{to their}} making <b>you</b> lieutenant, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>your</b> dues, {{it would be}} a colonel they should <b>have</b> made <b>you,</b> or at any rate a major." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm not {{particularly}} keen on cards to-night," [...] he remarked, with a yawn. [...] "I believe, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>your</b> own way, you'd play from morning to night." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There, there, Dick, I didn't mean to {{hurt your}} feelings," [...] cried his aunt hastily. [...] "I {{would give a}} good deal <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>your</b> watch back." ...|$|R
6000|$|The Doctor {{waved his}} pipe. [...] "Not that, please. I don't want to pry <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>your</b> reasons for keeping quiet. Only I {{would like you}} to think of Hilyer's mental health. He really {{believes}} this story." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{shall not}} kill you--now," [...] said the ape-man. [...] "First I shall go and learn {{if you have}} lied to me and <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>your</b> death shall be the more terrible. Do you know how Major Schneider died?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You have it made, miss; it is {{best you}} should have one. I might go under and Bob might get another partner, or he might go under and I might get another partner, and in either case it would save trouble <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>your</b> rights clearly marked out and set down.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{would be}} hopeless, then, {{to attempt to}} explain the matter. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>your</b> hand in at the spherical, I could make it all as plain as the capstan." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Am I?' {{cried the}} girl bitterly. 'It's {{no fault of}} yours, if I am not! You'd never have me {{anything}} else, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>your</b> will, except now;--the humour doesn't suit you, doesn't it?' ...|$|R
50|$|You {{can sit in}} your {{armchair}} and try {{to predict}} how people will behave by asking how <b>you</b> would behave <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>your</b> wits around <b>you.</b> You get, free of charge, a lot of vicarious, empirical behavior.|$|R
6000|$|... 'What do you {{yourself}} wish? What object are you aiming at? What game have {{you yourself}} been playing? I speak not in harshness; but I {{really do not}} understand what you have been about. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>your</b> grandfather's passions, you have his brain too. I did not ever suppose that you were [...] "infirm of purpose."' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{believe that}} some have already given them up, Philip; and <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>your</b> sleeves well wadded and quilted, I think you might, if you like, give up the armour. The men-at-arms are not so protected, {{and it is only}} when you meet a noble, in full armour, that you would be at a disadvantage." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay, {{you will}} make every Englishman a slave, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>your</b> own way," [...] said Wildrake, not a whit abashed;--for the awe which had {{formerly}} overcome him when alone with this remarkable man, had vanished, {{now that they were}} engaged in an altercation before witnesses.--"But do your worst, Master Oliver; I tell you beforehand, the bird has escaped you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{gave up a}} {{comfortable}} home and a life as happy as the average. You were fairly prosperous. <b>You</b> seem to <b>have</b> had a rotten time in Paris. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>your</b> time over again would {{you do what you}} did?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We’re {{going to}} live as we’ve always lived," [...] pursued Mr. Gribble. [...] "Money ain’t going to spoil me. I ain’t {{going to put on}} no side just because I’ve come in for a little bit. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>your</b> way we should end up in the workhouse." ...|$|R

60|$|It is {{an ancient}} place, Streatley, dating back, like most river-side towns and villages, to British and Saxon times. Goring is not nearly so pretty a little spot to stop at as Streatley, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>your</b> choice; but it is passing fair enough in its way, and is nearer the railway in case you want to slip off without paying your hotel bill.|$|E
5000|$|Jordin {{describes}} the song as being about [...] "everybody having a path {{they have to}} take but when you have that one person next to you or a few friends, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>your</b> family with you pretty much you can face another day, you can get through any obstacle and you can make it through anything." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{story of}} St. Isidore is a {{reminder}} of the dignity of work, and that ordinary life can lead to holiness. Legends about angel helpers and mysterious oxen indicate that his work was not neglected and his duties did not go unfulfilled. St. Isidore's life demonstrates that: <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>your</b> spiritual self in order, your earthly commitments will fall into order also." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Pshaw! Ye're a fool, Rotherby--a fool, and there's an end on't," [...] {{said his}} mother. [...] "I {{sometimes}} wonder {{which is the}} greater fool--you or your father. And yet he can marvel that you are his son. What do ye think would <b>have</b> happened <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>your</b> way with that bread-and-butter miss? It had been matter enough to hang you." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> picked <b>your</b> lawn {{of leaves}} and snails, [...] <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> told <b>your</b> valet, even with oaths, [...] Once a week or so, to brush <b>your</b> clothes.

6000|$|... "Now <b>if</b> <b>you</b> please, sir, {{will you}} tell us why <b>you</b> would <b>have</b> been counted a deserter from the British army <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> not <b>had</b> <b>your</b> suspicions aroused {{regarding}} us?" [...] Pierre asked in conclusion, and Morgan replied promptly: ...|$|R
5000|$|Divide {{the players}} into two teams. The game works best if {{the teams are}} even. To avoid later confusion, {{instruct}} one team to distinguish themselves from the other team by wearing headbands, rolling up their pants legs or shirt sleeves, etc. [...] - [...] boys vs. girls may work. Hand out the slips of paper with players' names; it doesn't matter <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>your</b> own name. Everyone should have one slip, with no extras.|$|E

5000|$|Casting {{was a huge}} problem, and it was {{reported}} that producer Darryl F. Zanuck and director Ford deliberated for weeks. Marjorie Rambeau and Gene Tierney were cast in November 1940. Most other cast members were signed on in the same month. Ford personally insisted that Charley Grapewin was cast as Jeeter, because of their previous collaboration on The Grapes of Wrath. To portray Dude, William Tracy had to diet and lose teeth. On his role, Tracy commented in a December 1940 interview: [...] "It's a swell part. It's one you can sink your teeth in, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>your</b> teeth." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I did {{not bring}} them here," [...] he answered. [...] "Luck, Fate, Fortune, God or the Devil, {{call it what you}} will, brought them here, though <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>your</b> wish, it is true they would never have come. Still, as they have come, I am glad. It is {{something}} to me, living in this hell, to get a chance of talking to English gentlemen again before I die." ...|$|R
6000|$|Then Henry turn'd to Juan, and address'd [...] A {{few words}} of condolence on his state: [...] 'You look,' quoth he, <b>'as</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>your</b> rest [...] Broke in upon by the Black Friar of late.' [...] 'What friar?' said Juan; and {{he did his best}} [...] To put the {{question}} with an air sedate, [...] Or careless; but the effort was not valid [...] To hinder him from growing still more pallid.|$|R

50|$|There is {{no direct}} bus to Rukmani Kund. If you are {{traveling}} through Bus then Auhar is last bus stop for you. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>your</b> personal vehicle then the road {{leading to the}} Rukmani Kund bifurcates from Bhaged Village, towards Auhar on the Shimla-Dharamshala Highway. If {{you want to go}} on foot then a path lead to Rukmani from a kilometer ahead on Auhar-Rishikesh road. If you want to continue in your personal vehicle then you have to go 3 km ahead on Auhar-Gehrwin road and there is a kuchha road of almost 2 km which takes you to the Rukmani Kund.|$|E
50|$|Desperate {{and without}} knowing who to turn to, Miguel Angel decides {{to listen to}} his {{grandmother}} Matilde, who claims that they own land {{on the outskirts of the}} city that his grandfather once bought.With intentions to sell them and to make of money in cash, Miguel Angel undertakes the crusade of recovering them facing the Menchaca, the family that lives there and that assures to own the place that they once bought to him to their grandfathers.As there is no evidence of either, nor of the other. The Ruizpalacios have no other choice but to settle down to live with the Menchaca, in what is the only house with which they have, as well as a restaurant and a hall of events.The meeting of these two worlds is very comical. First, because the Ruizpalacios do not understand how the Menchaca live. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>your</b> own room with a private bathroom, the Ruizpalacios spend the night sleeping together in cabin beds and sharing a single bathroom among the more than 10 people who live in the house.Secondly, because in their life they worked and now they will have to survive in some way, learning the activities that the Menchaca develop, for them, one more humiliating than the other.|$|E

RAK Tourism {{said that the}} success of the Awafi Festival lay in {{the fact that it was}} an annual outdoor event and that its focus was on traditional local and family fun entertainment.

6000|$|... "You hate 'strange people' as <b>you</b> call 'em. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>your</b> way, I'd {{be as much}} of an old stick-in-the-mud as Howard Littlefield. You {{never want}} to have anybody with any git to 'em at the house; you want a bunch of old stiffs that sit around and gas about the weather. You're doing your level best to make me old. Well, let me tell you, I'm not going to have--" ...|$|R

"Wanton, you named yourself," [...] he exclaimed; [...] "but I {{name you}} witch also, who, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>your</b> deserts, should die {{the death of}} a witch by fire. Mother Matilda, I command you, on your oath, keep this witch fast and make report to me of all her sorceries. It is not fitting that such a one should walk abroad to bring evil on the innocent. Witch and wanton, begone to your chamber!" ...|$|R
