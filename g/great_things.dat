He had the former Free State President FW Reitz as State Secretary from June 1898 and Leyds, who set up an office in Brussels, as Envoy Extraordinary in Europe. The post of State Attorney was given to a young lawyer from the Cape called Jan Smuts, for whom Kruger presaged <b>great</b> <b>things.</b> The removal of Leyds to Europe marked the end of Kruger's longstanding policy of giving important government posts to Dutchmen; convinced of Cape Afrikaners' sympathy following the Jameson Raid, he preferred them from this point on.|$|E

Throughout the season, return players Blaine Down, Mike Henderson and newly appointed captain Matt Dzieduszycki led the charge on offense with 73, 68, and 63 points respectively. In addition, through the several trades that brought in Fraser Clair, Shayne Fryia, and goaltender David Chant as well as the great play of rookie Jan Platil the Colts looked to make a deep run into the playoffs the following season.|$|E
