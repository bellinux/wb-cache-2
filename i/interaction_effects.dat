40|$|In {{multilevel}} MIMIC models, covariates at the between {{level and}} at the within level can be modeled simultaneously. Covariates <b>interaction</b> <b>effect</b> occurs when the effect of one covariate on the latent factor varies depending {{on the level of}} the other covariate. The two covariates can be both at the between level, both at the within level, and one at the between level and the other one at the within level. And they can create between level covariates interaction, within level covariates interaction, and cross level covariates interaction. Study One purports to examine the performance of multilevel MIMIC models in estimating the covariates interaction described above. Type I error of falsely detecting covariates interaction when there is no covariates <b>interaction</b> <b>effect</b> in the population model, and the power of correctly detecting the covariates <b>interaction</b> <b>effect,</b> bias of the estimate of <b>interaction</b> <b>effect,</b> and RMSE are examined. The design factors include the location of the covariates <b>interaction</b> <b>effect,</b> cluster number, cluster size, intra-class correlation (ICC) level, and magnitude of the <b>interaction</b> <b>effect.</b> The results showed that ML MIMIC performed well in detecting the covariates <b>interaction</b> <b>effect</b> when the covariates <b>interaction</b> <b>effect</b> was at the within level or cross level. However, when the covariates <b>interaction</b> <b>effect</b> was at the between level, the performance of ML MIMIC depended on the magnitude of the <b>interaction</b> <b>effect,</b> ICC, and sample size, especially cluster size. In Study Two, the impact of omitting covariates <b>interaction</b> <b>effect</b> on the estimate of other parameters is investigated when the covariates <b>interaction</b> <b>effect</b> is present in the population model. Parameter estimates of factor loadings, intercepts, main effects of the covariates, and residual variances produced by the correct model in Study One are compared to those produced by the misspecified model to check the impact. Moreover, the sensitivity of fit indices, such as chi-square, CFI, RMSEA, SRMR-B (between), and SRM-W (within) are also examined.

40|$|<b>Interaction</b> <b>effect</b> is an {{important}} scientific interest for many areas of research. Common approach for investigating the <b>interaction</b> <b>effect</b> of two continuous covariates on a response variable is through a cross-product term in multiple linear regression. In epidemiological studies, the two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) type of method has also been utilized to examine the <b>interaction</b> <b>effect</b> by replacing the continuous covariates with their discretized levels. However, the implications of model assumptions of either approach have not been examined and the statistical validation has only focused on the general method, not specifically for the <b>interaction</b> <b>effect.</b> ^ In this dissertation, we investigated the validity of both approaches based on the mathematical assumptions for non-skewed data. We showed that linear regression {{may not be an}} appropriate model when the <b>interaction</b> <b>effect</b> exists because it implies a highly skewed distribution for the response variable. We also showed that the normality and constant variance assumptions required by ANOVA are not satisfied in the model where the continuous covariates are replaced with their discretized levels. Therefore, naïve application of ANOVA method may lead to an incorrect conclusion. ^ Given the problems identified above, we proposed a novel method modifying from the traditional ANOVA approach to rigorously evaluate the <b>interaction</b> <b>effect.</b> The analytical expression of the <b>interaction</b> <b>effect</b> was derived based on the conditional distribution of the response variable given the discretized continuous covariates. A testing procedure that combines the p-values from each level of the discretized covariates was developed to test the overall significance of the <b>interaction</b> <b>effect.</b> According to the simulation study, the proposed method is more powerful then the least squares regression and the ANOVA method in detecting the <b>interaction</b> <b>effect</b> when data comes from a trivariate normal distribution. The proposed method was applied to a dataset from the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) stroke trial, and baseline age-by-weight <b>interaction</b> <b>effect</b> was found significant in predicting the change from baseline in NIHSS at Month- 3 among patients received t-PA therapy. ...|$|R

For example, consider the stock exchange as a market consisting {{of a large number}} of traders each operating with his/her own strategies to maximize profits. The individualistic behaviour of each trader can be described by modelling the marginals. However, as all traders operate on the same exchange, each trader's actions have an interaction effect with other traders'. This interaction effect can be described by modelling the dependence structure. Therefore, copulas allow us to analyse the <b>interaction</b> <b>effects</b> which are of particular interest during downside regimes as investors tend to herd their trading behaviour and decisions.|$|E

2500|$|Professor Raymond Andrew at the University of Nottingham in the UK {{pioneered the}} {{development}} of high-resolution solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance. He {{was the first to}} report the introduction of the MAS (magic angle sample spinning; MASS) technique that allowed him to achieve spectral resolution in solids sufficient to distinguish between chemical groups with either different chemical shifts or distinct Knight shifts. In MASS, the sample is spun at several kilohertz around an axis that makes the so-called magic angle θm (which is ~54.74°, where [...] ) with respect to the direction of the static magnetic field B0; as a result of such magic angle sample spinning, the chemical shift anisotropy bands are averaged to their corresponding average (isotropic) chemical shift values. The above expression involving cos2θm has its origin in a calculation that predicts the magnetic dipolar <b>interaction</b> <b>effects</b> to cancel out for the specific value of θm called the magic angle. One notes that correct alignment of the sample rotation axis {{as close as possible to}} θm is essential for cancelling out the dipolar interactions whose strength for angles sufficiently far from θm is usually greater than ~10kHz for C–H bonds in solids, for example, and it is thus greater than their CSA values.|$|E
2500|$|The precessing nuclei {{can also}} {{fall out of}} {{alignment}} with each other (returning the net magnetization vector to a non-precessing field) and stop producing a signal. This is called T2 or transverse relaxation. Because {{of the difference in}} the actual relaxation mechanisms involved (for example, intermolecular versus intramolecular magnetic dipole-dipole interactions [...] ), T1 is usually (except in rare cases) longer than T2 (that is, slower spin-lattice relaxation, for example because of smaller dipole-dipole <b>interaction</b> <b>effects).</b> In practice, the value of T2* which is the actually observed decay time of the observed NMR signal, or free induction decay (to [...] of the initial amplitude immediately after the resonant RF pulse), also depends on the static magnetic field inhomogeneity, which is quite significant. (There is also a smaller but significant contribution to the observed FID shortening from the RF inhomogeneity of the resonant pulse). In the corresponding FT-NMR spectrum—meaning the Fourier transform of the free induction decay—the T2* time is inversely related to the width of the NMR signal in frequency units. Thus, a nucleus with a long T2 relaxation time gives rise to a very sharp NMR peak in the FT-NMR spectrum for a very homogeneous ("well-shimmed") static magnetic field, whereas nuclei with shorter T2 values give rise to broad FT-NMR peaks even when the magnet is shimmed well. Both T1 and T2 depend on the rate of molecular motions as well as the gyromagnetic ratios of both the resonating and their strongly interacting, next-neighbor nuclei that are not at resonance.|$|E
