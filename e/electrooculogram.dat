40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{a method to}} remove the unwanted interdependency between vertical and horizontal eye-movement components in <b>electrooculograms</b> (EOGs). EOGs {{have been widely used}} to estimate eye movements without a camera in a variety of human-computer interaction (HCI) applications using pairs of electrodes generally attached either above and below the eye (vertical EOG) or to the left and right of the eyes (horizontal EOG). It has been well documented that the vertical EOG component has less stability than the horizontal EOG one, making accurate estimation of the vertical location of the eyes difficult. To address this issue, an experiment was designed in which ten subjects participated. Visual inspection of the recorded EOG signals showed that the vertical EOG component is highly influenced by horizontal eye movements, whereas the horizontal EOG is rarely affected by vertical eye movements. Moreover, the results showed that this interdependency could be effectively removed by introducing an individual constant value. It is therefore expected that the proposed method can enhance the overall performance of practical EOG-based eye-tracking systems...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{describe}} the clinical and genetic findings {{in a family}} with a peculiar autosomal dominant macular dystrophy with peripheral deposits. Methods: All family members underwent an ophthalmic examination, and their genomic DNA was screened for mutations in the human retinal degeneration slow (peripherin/RDS) and rhodopsin genes. In selected cases, fluorescein angiography and electrophysiologic testing were performed. Results: The age at onset of the disease was between {{the third and fourth}} decades of life, starting with mild visual acuity loss and periods of metamorphopsia. Clinical signs included subretinal yellowish macular deposits evolving into geographic atrophy and retinal hypopigmentation and hyperpigmentation. Electroretinography demonstrated rod dysfunction, and <b>electrooculograms</b> were mildly to severely disturbed. All affected members were found to carry a 3 -base pair deletion affecting codon 169 of the peripherin/RDS gene.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to report 14 new cases of {{unilateral}} retinitis pigmentosa and three new cases of cone-rod dystrophy and to compare the similarities and dissimilarities to those found in the bilateral forms of these disorders. Methods: A total of 272 cases of retinitis pigmentosa and 167 cases of cone-rod dystrophy were studied by corneal full field electroretinograms and <b>electrooculograms.</b> The student t-test was used to compare categories. Results: The percentage of familial and nonfamilial cases was the same for the bilateral and unilateral forms of the disease. In our series, unilateral retinitis pigmentosa makes up approximately 5 % of the total population of retinitis pigmentosa, while unilateral cone-rod dystrophy makes up only about 2 % of the total. In the familial forms of unilateral retinitis pigmentosa the most common inheritance pattern was autosomal dominant and all affected relatives had bilateral disease.

40|$|An {{important}} {{method for}} removing {{the effect of}} ocular artefact from the EEG is ‘EOG correction’. This method estimates the proportion of ocular artefact {{that is in the}} EEG, and removes it by subtraction. To date, EOG correction research has focused on problems relating to the estimation of the correction coefficients. Using both mathematical rationale and empirical data, this paper addresses issues relating to the subtraction phase, such as the magnitude of error that can be expected due to EOG correction. Using ERP methodology, principal component and regression analyses, it is shown that the N 1 P 2 complex propagates forward to the horizontal and radial (but not vertical) <b>electrooculograms</b> (EOG), and it is shown mathematically that this will result in EOG-correction error. Assuming an accurate estimate of ocular contamination of the EEG, maximal subtraction-phase error of the N 1 P 2 complex was found to be a prefrontal attenuation of 15 – 22 %, decreasing to central and occipital enhancements of 3 – 4 % and 13 – 14 %, respectively. The magnitude of this subtraction-phase error is compared to between-subject ERP variability and to error associated with EOG rejection (omitting data contaminated by ocular artefact). It is argued that such EOG correction error is small relative to both artefact rejection procedures and to normal variability found in ERP studies, and that it is less pernicious than artefact rejection procedures...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Approximately {{one-third of}} the human {{lifespan}} is spent sleeping. To diagnose sleep problems, all-night polysomnographic (PSG) recordings including electroencephalograms (EEGs), <b>electrooculograms</b> (EOGs) and electromyograms (EMGs), are usually acquired from the patient and scored by a well-trained expert according to Rechtschaffen & Kales (R&K) rules. Visual sleep scoring is a time-consuming and subjective process. Therefore, {{the development of an}} automatic sleep scoring method is desirable. Method The EEG, EOG and EMG signals from twenty subjects were measured. In addition to selecting sleep characteristics based on the 1968 R&K rules, features utilized in other research were collected. Thirteen features were utilized including temporal and spectrum analyses of the EEG, EOG and EMG signals, and a total of 158 [*]hours of sleep data were recorded. Ten subjects were used to train the Discrete Hidden Markov Model (DHMM), and the remaining ten were tested by the trained DHMM for recognition. Furthermore, the 2 -fold cross validation was performed during this experiment. Results Overall agreement between the expert and the results presented is 85. 29 %. With the exception of S 1, the sensitivities of each stage were more than 81 %.

5000|$|Best’s vitelliform macular dystrophy (BVMD) {{is one of}} {{the most}} common Best1-associated diseases. BVMD {{typically}} becomes noticeable in children and is represented by the buildup of lipofuscin (lipid residuals) lesions in the eye. Diagnosis normally follows an abnormal <b>electrooculogram</b> in which decreased activation of calcium channels in the basolateral membrane of the retinal pigment epithelium becomes apparent. A mutation in the BEST1 gene leads to a loss of channel function and eventually retinal degeneration. [...] Although BVMD is an autosomal dominant form of macular dystrophy, expressivity varies within and between affected families although the overwhelming majority of affected families come from northern European descent. Typically, people with this condition experience five progressively worsening stages, though timing and severity varies greatly. BVMD is often caused by the single missense mutations; however, amino acid deletions have also been identified. A loss of function of the Best1 chloride channel could likely explain some of the most common issues associated with BVMD: an inability to regulate intracellular ion concentrations and regulate overall cell volume. To date, over 100 disease-causing mutations have been related to BVMD as well as a number of other degenerative retinal diseases.|$|E
50|$|The third {{category}} uses electric potentials measured with electrodes placed around the eyes. The eyes are {{the origin of}} a steady electric potential field, which can also be detected in total darkness and if the eyes are closed. It can be modelled to be generated by a dipole with its positive pole at the cornea and its negative pole at the retina. The electric signal that can be derived using two pairs of contact electrodes placed on the skin around one eye is called <b>Electrooculogram</b> (EOG). If the eyes move from the centre position towards the periphery, the retina approaches one electrode while the cornea approaches the opposing one. This change in {{the orientation of the}} dipole and consequently the electric potential field results in a change in the measured EOG signal. Inversely, by analysing these changes in eye movement can be tracked. Due to the discretisation given by the common electrode setup two separate movement components - a horizontal and a vertical - can be identified. A third EOG component is the radial EOG channel, which is the average of the EOG channels referenced to some posterior scalp electrode. This radial EOG channel is sensitive to the saccadic spike potentials stemming from the extra-ocular muscles at the onset of saccades, and allows reliable detection of even miniature saccades.|$|E

Repeated <b>electrooculograms</b> (EOGs) and flash electroretinograms (ERGs) were made and the cumulative dose of vigabatrin and the visual field loss were recorded after a period of 37 - 47 months. Results: The visual field loss was stable in patients who had stopped vigabatrin {{at the time of the}} first examination. There was a slight increase in VFL in patients who continued vigabatrin.

It is traditionally performed by a sleep expert who assigns to each 30 s of signal a sleep stage, based on the visual inspection of signals such as electroencephalograms (EEG), <b>electrooculograms</b> (EOG), electrocardiograms (ECG) and electromyograms (EMG). We introduce here the first deep learning approach for sleep stage classification that learns end-to-end without computing spectrograms or extracting hand-crafted features, that exploits all multivariate and multimodal Polysomnography (PSG) signals (EEG, EMG and EOG), and that can exploit the temporal context of each 30 s window of data. For each modality the first layer learns linear spatial filters that exploit the array of sensors to increase the signal-to-noise ratio, and the last layer feeds the learnt representation to a softmax classifier. Our model is compared to alternative automatic approaches based on convolutional networks or decisions trees. Results obtained on 61 publicly available PSG records with up to 20 EEG channels demonstrate that our network architecture yields state-of-the-art performance. Our study reveals a number of insights on the spatio-temporal distribution of the signal of interest: a good trade-off for optimal classification performance measured with balanced accuracy is to use 6 EEG with 2 EOG (left and right) and 3 EMG chin channels.

Our previous study reported that cold exposure elevates the amplitude of the morning blood pressure surge (MBPS) and is associated with a sympathetic increase during the final sleep transition, which might be critical for sleep-related cardiovascular events in normotensives. However, few studies have explored the effects of cold exposure on autonomic function during sleep transitions and changes of autonomic function among prehypertensives. Therefore, we conducted an experiment for testing the effects of cold exposure on changes of autonomic function during sleep and the MBPS among young prehypertensives are more exaggerate than among young normotensives. The study groups consisted of 12 normotensive and 12 prehypertensive male adults with mean ages of 23. 67 ± 0. 70 and 25. 25 ± 0. 76 years, respectively. The subjects underwent cold (16 °C) and warm (23 °C) conditions randomly.

However, {{little is known about the}} role of non-visual eye positional information in postural control. This study examined the role of non-visual eye position information in upright postural control by comparing participants' centre of pressure (COP) sway between two experimental conditions: (1) a space-fixed visual target condition (control), in which eye movement was not controlled, and (2) a head-fixed visual target condition (treatment), in which eye movement was inhibited. Using 12 university students, COP sway and <b>electrooculograms</b> (EOG) were measured under both conditions. In the space-fixed condition, participants maintain an upright posture while fixating on a visual target fixed on a screen 1 m in front of them. In the head-fixed condition, participants maintained an upright posture while gazing at a target moving in sync with their head sway on the screen. The COP was evaluated by path length, area, root mean square, velocity and position. Eye movements were evaluated by the mean eye movement angle. The mean eye movement angle was significantly larger in the vertical direction then in the horizontal direction in both experimental conditions and was also found to be larger in the space-fixed condition than in the head-fixed condition. No significant different was found in any COP parameter between both conditions.

40|$|Dysfunction of {{coordination}} between {{the central nervous}} system (CNS) and autonomic nervous system (ANS) has been implicated as a pathologic aspect of many disorders, including sleep apnea, idiopathic Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 s disease, sudden infant death syndrome, and diabetes. Quantitative methods have been recently proposed for diagnosis of autonomic dysfunction. If a quantitative method could reliably measure CNS-ANS coordination, diagnosis of CNS-ANS dysfunction and understanding of associated disorders would be enhanced. This study hypothesizes that central and autonomic nervous rhythms are synchronized at respiratory frequencies and that CNS-ANS synchronization with respiration is modulated by physiologic state. In particular, this study seeks to verify a consequence of the hypothesis, namely that spectral coherence between EEG and heart rate variability (HRV) time series at respiratory frequencies varies with sleep state in healthy young adults. Eight healthy young adults volunteered for the study and gave their informed consent. Subjects reported to the sleep laboratory two hours prior to habitual bedtime for preparation. A urine specimen was obtained and qualitatively tested for substances which might confound the study. Electrodes were then applied to record EEG, electrocardiograms, <b>electrooculograms,</b> and submental electromyograms. EEG electrode locations were controlled by using a cap with standard 10 - 20 system recording sites. Subjects next assumed a supine position in bed and elastic straps containing piezoelectric transducers were placed around the chest and abdomen to monitor respiratory movements. Subjects retired and recording began at the habitual bedtime. Data analysis began by identifying artifact-free episodes of slow wave sleep (SWS) and paradoxical sleep (REM). Epochs 200 seconds in duration were subjected to spectral analysis. Coherence between HRV and each EEG channel was then computed and values in frequency ranges of predominant HRV components were retained for analysis. Measures of EEG-HRV coherence distributions over the scalp, including average and hilliness values, were computed. Coherence metrics were found to be significantly different in SWS and REM.

40|$|Introduction Electroencephalographic {{analysis}} {{techniques have}} become a very useful tool to assess brain activity and interactions between cerebral regions, that is, the so-called cerebral connectivity analysis. The effects of some drugs have, so far, been studied using spectral analysis and, to a lesser extent, some linear and nonlinear connectivity techniques. New indexes have recently been designed based on assumptions that make them more robust against volume conduction effects that could yield to spurious connectivity results. These new indexes such as the imaginary coherence (IC) [Nolte et al., 2004], the phase-lag index (PLI) [Stam et al., 2007] and the weighted phase-lag index (WPLI) [Vinck et al., 2011] have proven very useful in several fields, for example in characterizing electroencephalographic (EEG) and magnetoencephalographic (MEG) activity of Alzheimer’s Disease patients compared to healthy controls. However, these techniques have not been applied to study the effect of drugs on the brain. The main {{purpose of the current}} work was to assess the suitability and effectiveness of these innovative indexes to study the brain connectivity under psychoactive drug treatment, and concretely, the effects of a single dose of alprazolam, a short-acting drug of the benzodiazepine family. Alprazolam is extensively prescribed for the treatment of anxiety and panic disorders, and peak plasma concentrations are obtained between 0. 5 and 2 hours after intake [Greenblat and Wright, 1993]. Being a benzodiazepines, alprazolam induces an enhancement of the inhibitory pathways through their activity on the GABAA receptor complex, favouring the entrance to chloride ions into the neurons [Haefely, 1990]. Due to the enhancement of the inhibitory pathways a weakening or even an impairment of functional connectivity could be hypothesized. Database A single oral dose of alprazolam 1 mg was administered to 9 volunteers (aged between 20 and 32 years, mean age 23 years) in a double-blind randomized crossover placebo-controlled design. Volunteers were reported to be in good health and were not allowed to take any psychoactive drugs, caffeine, alcohol and tobacco in the two weeks before the experimental sessions, nor during the one-week washout period between sessions. The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and subsequent revisions concerning experimentation in humans, and was approved by the Hospital Ethics Committee and the Spanish Ministry of Health. EEG signals were recorded for 3 minutes several times: before drug intake, and 30 minutes, 45 minutes, 1 hour, 1. 5 hours, 2. 5 hours, and 4 hours after the administration. Vertical and horizontal <b>electrooculograms</b> and 19 EEG channels (Fp 1 / 2, F 7 / 8, F 3 / 4, Fz T 3 / 4, C 3 / 4, Cz, T 5 / 6, P 3 / 4, Pz, and O 1 / 2, following the international 10 / 20 system) were acquired, referenced to averaged mastoid electrodes (A 1 and A 2). Gold plated standard EEG electrodes were used, keeping impedances below 5 kΩ. Signals were analogically band-pass filtered (0. 1 to 45 Hz), and recorded at a sampling frequency of 100 Hz. Methodology All EEG recordings underwent ocular artefact reduction following the procedures described by [Romero et al. 2008]. Given that the main effects of alprazolam on cerebral rhythms focus on alpha 1 (7. 5 to 10. 5 Hz) and beta bands (13 to 35 Hz) [Barbanoj et al. 2006], recordings were subsequently filtered using an inverse Chebyshev filter to obtain their corresponding signals. Attenuation in the passband and the stopbands was set to 1 and 20 dB respectively, and forward and reverse filtering was applied to ensure zero-phase distortion. The considered connectivity measures, namely the phase-lag index (PLI), the weighted phase-lag index (WPLI), and the imaginary coherence (IC), were proposed initially as tools able to quantify the amount of synchronization between pairs of signals without taking into account spurious connectivity due to instantaneous propagation, which could be caused by volume conduction. The PLI is based on the concept of phase synchronization, assuming that when two signals are coupled, their phase difference is constant or almost constant for a certain amount of time. This synchronization can be calculated by obtaining the phases of EEG signals via the Hilbert transform and calculating the instantaneous difference over time. If there is synchronization between signals, the distribution of these phase differences should be centred on a relevant value. The PLI quantifies the asymmetry of the phase distribution in a scale from 0 to 1, ensuring that a null value is obtained when phase differences concentrate around 0 and π values, which correspond to instantaneous propagation [Stam et al., 2007]. WPLI represents an improvement over PLI because both the sensitivity to noise and the capacity to detect changes in phase synchronization are hindered by the discontinuity of PLI [Vinck et al., 2011]. In WPLI, the contribution of the observed phase differences is weighted by additionally accounting for the magnitude of the phase differences, reducing the probability of detecting connectivity in the case of volume conducted noise sources. The third considered measure, the IC, is closely related to the standard magnitude squared coherence, but its definition makes it inconsistent with non-interacting sources and that is why it reflects true interaction in contrast to volume conducted self-interaction [Nolte et al., 2004]. Once these indexes were calculated, the pharmacological effects were assessed by means of statistical parametric maps of the head, representing significant differences in connectivity between placebo and drug situations as lines connecting the corresponding scalp locations. Non-parametric Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were used, and an omnibus threshold based on the binomial theorem [Cross-Chaffin, 1982; Alonso et al. 2010] was used to detect significant maps taking into account multiple comparisons. Results Significant changes were found in the alpha 1 band (PLI, WPLI, and IC; significant maps in Figure 1 are underlined), but not in beta band (maps shown in Figure 2 do not reach the minimum threshold established by the omnibus test). The obtained changes between 45 minutes and 90 minutes after intake fall within the expected time-window of peak plasma concentrations. The Pearson correlation coefficients obtained when comparing the time course of the values alpha 1 PLI, WPLI and IC with drug plasma concentrations were 0. 92, 0. 85 and 0. 96, respectively. For the beta PLI, WPLI and IC the coefficients were 0. 87, 0. 79 and 0. 79, respectively. Although measures in the beta band could not elicit significant differences caused by the pharmacological effects correlation coefficients were high, showing that these measures were able to follow these effects. Conclusions The suitability of three different connectivity measures, not affected by volume-conducted propagation, for the detection of alprazolam-induced effects on the brain was assessed in this work. Analysis was focused on the previously known bands of interest, alpha 1 and beta. The results of the three indexes (the phase-lag index, the weighted phase-lag index, and the imaginary coherence) in these bands match with the pharmacological effect measured by blood levels, but only the alpha 1 band shows significant changes associated with drug intake. In this sense, previous studies have successfully extracted such information from spectral and nonlinear connectivity measures that might be affected by volume conduction [Alonso et al., 2010; Alonso et al., 2012]. The special design of the experiment, comparing placebo and drug conditions and correcting by the baseline instant, reduces the effects of spurious connectivity and possibly favours the obtention of results using such measures in contrast to the new indexes studied in the current work. PLI and WPLI indicate a reduction of phase synchronization due to alprazolam administration, whereas IC shows an increase of interaction. This can happen because IC depends on no only on the phase synchronitzation but also on the magnitude of the phase difference, so it is essentially quantifying different relationships between signals induced by the drug. This additional information taken into account by this measure provides the best correlation with drug plasma concentrations after intake The fact that the considered indexes were not able to find significant differences in the beta band might indicate that phase-coupling changes induced by the drug are weak or too subtle to be detected, given that all measures are corrected by a baseline recording. This might discourage their use in psychopharmacological studies when assessing low doses, mild effects, or when working with a reduced number of participants. However, correlations with plasma concentrations remained high, indicating that PLI, WPLI and IC should not be totally discarded as means of evaluating pharmacological effects on the brain via EEG recordings...|$|R
