5|$|The A320 was {{the first}} civil {{airliner}} to include a full digital fly-by-wire flight control system.

5|$|Flight testing {{began with}} the first flight of the second AH-56 (s/n 66-8827) in September 1967. During early flight tests, a rotor {{instability}} issue was discovered when the aircraft was flying at low altitude in ground effect. As the <b>flight</b> <b>envelope</b> was expanded, this instability and other minor problems were discovered and quickly addressed.|$|E
5|$|The {{design work}} was {{supported}} by a preceding research programme studying the flight characteristics of low ratio delta wings. A supersonic Fairey Delta 2 was modified to carry the ogee planform, and, renamed as the BAC 221, used for flight tests of the high speed <b>flight</b> <b>envelope,</b> the Handley Page HP.115 also provided valuable information on low speed performance.|$|E
40|$|Availability data {{obtained}} on SNB- 1 trainer-class airplanes were analyzed and results presented as <b>flight</b> <b>envelopes</b> which predict occurrences of large values of air speed and acceleration.

It is concluded that <b>flight</b> <b>envelopes</b> are satisfactory; that the two types show large differences in flight loads and speeds experience; and that SNB- 1 will seldom, if ever, exceed design limit load factor and restricted speed, which SNJ- 4 {{can be expected to}} exceed design-limit load factor and restricted speed in {{a very small number of}} flight hours...|$|R

40|$|The {{structure}} and {{coverage of the}} proposed MIL-H- 8501 B specification for helicopter handling qualities are reviewed. The specification prescibes the desired vehicle command response {{as a function of}} the mission task and the usable visual cues.

5|$|In {{designing}} the 777 {{as its first}} fly-by-wire commercial aircraft, Boeing decided to retain conventional control yokes rather than change to sidestick controllers as used in many fly-by-wire fighter aircraft and in many Airbus airliners. Along with traditional yoke and rudder controls, the cockpit features a simplified layout that retains similarities to previous Boeing models. The fly-by-wire system also incorporates <b>flight</b> <b>envelope</b> protection, a system that guides pilot inputs within a computer-calculated framework of operating parameters, acting to prevent stalls, overspeeds, and excessively stressful maneuvers. This system can be overridden by the pilot if deemed necessary. The fly-by-wire system is supplemented by mechanical backup.|$|E
5|$|On 15 October 1964, the Tri-partite Evaluation Squadron (TES) {{was formed}} at RAF West Raynham, staffed by a diverse mix of {{military}} test pilots from Britain, the United States and West Germany. The personnel comprising the squadron were highly experienced pilots; prior to flying the Kestrel, each received a week's ground training at Bristol's in-house facility and a week's ground instruction at Dunsford {{prior to a}} three-hour flight conversion instructed by Bill Bedford. The purpose of the squadron was to evaluate the suitability of V/STOL aircraft for field operations, compare competing styles and methods of taking off/landing, develop normal flight operating procedures, perform instrument flight assessments, conduct night flight operations, and explore jet-borne maneuvering throughout the Kestrel's <b>flight</b> <b>envelope.</b>|$|E
5|$|The A330 {{shares the}} same glass cockpit flight deck layout as the A320 and A340, {{featuring}} electronic instrument displays rather than mechanical gauges. Instead {{of a conventional}} control yoke, the flight deck features side-stick controls, six main displays, and the Electronic Flight Instrument System (EFIS), which covers navigation and flight displays, {{as well as the}} Electronic Centralised Aircraft Monitor (ECAM). Apart from the flight deck, the A330 also has the fly-by-wire system common to the A320 family, the A340, the A350, and the A380. It also features three primary and two secondary flight control systems, as well as a <b>flight</b> <b>envelope</b> limit protection system which prevents manoeuvres from exceeding the aircraft's aerodynamic and structural limits.|$|E

The method controls the event temperature and color-play bandwidth best suited to specific experimental conditions, and is easily learned. The method is applicable almost throughout the altitude and speed ranges for subsonic aircraft <b>flight</b> <b>envelopes,</b> and is also applicable to supersonic flow visualization and for general use in high- and low-speed wind tunnel and water tunnel testing...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} aims at {{assessing}} {{the influence of}} the interference effects caused by the horizontal tail plane (HTP) and vertical tail plane (VTP) on the aerodynamic behaviour of a transport aircraft in high-lift configuration. This aspect is of particular interest close to aircraft stalling conditions. The present study therefore assesses the effects caused by the tail plane during onflow conditions that represent stall manoeuvres. In this regard numerical simulations at extreme points of <b>flight</b> <b>envelopes</b> are analysed, by considering effects of discretization, physical turbulence models and incidence stall settings...|$|R

25|$|On 6 December 2002, {{the first}} ground {{tests of the}} BA609 {{prototype}} began, and the first flight took place on 6 March 2003 in Arlington, Texas, flown by test pilots Roy Hopkins and Dwayne Williams. After 14 hours of helicopter-mode flight testing, the prototype was moved to a ground testing rig to study the operational effects of the conversion modes. Following the completion of ground-based testing, on 3 June 2005 the prototype resumed flight testing, focusing on the expansion of its <b>flight</b> <b>envelope.</b> On 22 July 2005, the first conversion from helicopter to aeroplane mode while in flight took place. By October 2008, 365 flight-hours had been logged by two prototype aircraft. The AW609 demonstrated a safe dual-engine failure in normal cruise flight on 15 May 2009. By February 2012, this had risen to 650 hours, and {{it was reported that}} 85 percent of the AW609's <b>flight</b> <b>envelope</b> had been explored.
