The need of using a system of indicators is imposed by the complex character of the efficiency of expenses for education, {{due to the fact that}} each of these indices takes a certain efficiency criterion, contributing to the development, implementation and evaluation of the educational policies. Key words: indicators/indices, efficiency, <b>expenditure</b> <b>for</b> <b>education.</b> Within an economy where the public needs claim public goods of high values, continuously augmenting and diversifying, on one hand, and on the other hand, the financial state resources not going up in a sustained rhythm, a gap is created leading mainly to the failure of resources needed for all the economic activities and implicitly, of education activities. Based on these conditions, the decision makers proceed to sorting and ranking the social needs, respectively to sizing the public expenses, taking into account many criteria: priority, opportunity, efficiency and effectiveness, public services quality. If we take into account the efficiency of the <b>expenditure</b> <b>for</b> <b>education,</b> its quantification can be elaborate...|$|E

Furthermore, it is often shown that the values of the output social indicators are not congruent with those of the public expenditure, as other factors of influence interfere, such as those related to system management, the behaviour of the population, from the interest for school and performance, when we speak of education, to the lifestyle and feeding habits, when speaking about the health state...|$|E
