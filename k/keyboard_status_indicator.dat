5000|$|In 2004, Microsoft {{introduced}} the restyled Natural MultiMedia Keyboard, which reworked {{the row of}} multimedia buttons and included the controversial F Lock feature, originally debuted in the Microsoft Office Keyboard. Another common criticism is that although the bunched arrow keys of previous generation has been fixed by returning to the standard inverted T layout, the Home/End/Del/Ins/Page up/down set has been changed to 3x2 vertical layout, with the Insert key moved to the [...] "PrtScn/SysRq" [...] key, and del key expanded. On the Natural Multimedia <b>Keyboard,</b> the <b>status</b> <b>indicator</b> lights for Num lock, Scroll lock, and Caps lock were moved from between the banks of alphanumeric keys to a more traditional location above {{and to the right}} of the backspace key. The Natural Multimedia Keyboard was manufactured in at least three different color schemes, including white with blue accents, black with silver accents, and white with black accents.|$|R

We selected health-related environmental indicators and environment-related health <b>status</b> <b>indicators.</b> The data were obtained from published statistical data from the period 2008 – 2009. Both synthesized measures of environmental <b>indicators</b> and health <b>status</b> <b>indicators</b> were calculated using Strahll’s taxonometric methods. The range of values determined by this method is 0 – 1, with higher values representing a better situation in the given area. The study area consisted of 16 large administrative areas within Korea. The arithmetic mean of the synthesized measure of environmental indicators was 0. 348 (SD = 0. 151), and that of the synthesized measure of health <b>status</b> <b>indicators</b> was 0. 708 (SD = 0. 107). The correlation coefficient between the synthesized measures of environmental <b>indicators</b> and health <b>status</b> <b>indicators</b> was 0. 69 (95 % CI: 0. 28 – 0. 88).

40|$|Introduction The Community Health <b>Status</b> <b>Indicators</b> Project was {{undertaken}} to produce county-specific reports assessing {{the status of}} community health for local jurisdictions throughout the United States. To accomplish this assessment, the Community Health <b>Status</b> <b>Indicators</b> Project team selected peer groupings of counties to monitor and analyze the health of local communities relative to peer communities. Methods To identify peer counties, the project team used 5 categorical county demographic variables, a specified order for applying criteria, and a predetermined target for peer grouping size to subdivide counties into homogeneous subgroups called peer groupings. Results Eighty-eight peer groupings were developed with 14 – 58 counties in each. The average size of each peer grouping was 35 counties. All peer groupings included counties representing at least 6 states. DiscussionPeer groupings are very useful for community health assessment. They convey the range of health <b>status</b> <b>indicator</b> values for similar counties, serve {{as a basis for}} expected numbers of reportable diseases, and provide a method for comparing communities with peer and U. S. medians. To maintain their usefulness, peer groupings must be updated periodically...|$|R

There is a <b>status</b> <b>indicator</b> that is presented {{on the upper}} part of the MT screen (Fig.  9 d) in order to help users to remember chord modifiers and the respective colours. As it is shown in the Fig.  9 c, with three touches users are able to draw a blue line. With a four-finger chord users can draw a yellow line, while using all five fingers allows them to draw a purple line. Even though the <b>status</b> <b>indicator</b> seems to be obsolete, it may be useful for new users that have not been familiarized with the chord modifiers technique.|$|R

40|$|In {{the domain}} of {{financial}}, financial news, articles, reports about financial reviews are helpful and important information which give investors or financial analyst an indication to help decision making in financial matters. However, due to the volume of this information and the diversity of financial topics, {{it is difficult for}} a human to track and interpret each of them in a consistent manner. Based on this motivation, we propose that this information can be classified into categories, in which the categories are based on a particular objective and goal as required by a user. In each category, the financial information is further classified based on a <b>status</b> <b>indicator,</b> to reflect the positive, neutral or negative status in term of financial outlook stated in the information. Thus, user can directly focus on interested financial topic, and get an indication about the financial outlook of that topic. For classification purpose, we propose to combine linguistic technique and statistical technique to select features to represent the categories and <b>status</b> <b>indicators.</b> In this work, we present the architecture of MICE-f that will crawl financial information from multiple financial sources and classify them based on the defined categories and <b>status</b> <b>indicators.</b> 1...|$|R
