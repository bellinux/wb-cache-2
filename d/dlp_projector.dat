The systems work either by scanning the entire picture a dot at a time and modulating the laser directly at high frequency, much like the electron beams in a CRT, or by optically spreading and then modulating the laser and scanning a line at a time, the line itself being modulated {{in much the same way}} as in a <b>DLP</b> <b>projector.</b> Lasers can also be used as a light source for a <b>DLP</b> <b>projector.</b> More than 3 lasers can be combined to increase the gamut range, a technique sometimes used in holography.|$|E

50|$|A three-chip <b>DLP</b> <b>projector</b> uses a prism {{to split}} {{light from the}} lamp, and each primary color of light is then routed to its own DLP chip, then {{recombined}} and routed out through the lens. Three chip systems are found in higher-end home theater projectors, large venue projectors and DLP Cinema projection systems found in digital movie theaters.|$|E
50|$|Further, {{the intense}} heat accelerates {{failure of the}} high {{intensity}} lamp, often burning out in less than 100 hours, requiring replacement. In contrast, a modern LCD or <b>DLP</b> <b>projector</b> uses an arc lamp which has a higher luminous efficacy and lasts for thousands of hours. A drawback of that technology is the warm up time required for arc lamps.|$|E

These expensive components resulted in a price tag of between $12,500 to $15,000 for the hardware.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Nowadays, {{more and}} more <b>DLP</b> <b>projectors</b> are used as light sources {{in some kind of}} {{applications}} for they are programmable. <b>DLP</b> <b>projectors</b> are designed to match human eyes, therefore when we see projected images or videos through our eyes, our perception would match the source files very well. However, in case we use high-speed cameras, color of captured images may deviate a lot from our expectations. In this paper, we explain the difference at first. Then, a method to recover illumination in consecutively captured images is proposed. Application, in which <b>DLP</b> <b>projectors</b> are used as light sources and cameras are used as sensors, may benefit from this work...|$|R

5000|$|In 2009, the planetarium {{established}} the 360-degree sky theatre, {{the first in}} India, with the installation of a full-dome mirror projection system with a <b>DLP</b> <b>projector.</b> The 360-degree effect is created {{with the help of}} Wrap, a special software that takes care of curvature correction. The projector was installed at a cost of [...] 2.1 million.|$|E
5000|$|The way a single-chip <b>DLP</b> <b>projector</b> works {{sometimes}} causes {{viewers to}} see a [...] "rainbow" [...] or [...] "color breakup" [...] effect where false colors are briefly perceived when either the image or the observer's eye is in motion. As all three primary colors are displayed all the time by 3LCD projectors, they do not suffer from this effect.|$|E

5000|$|<b>DLP</b> <b>projectors</b> can {{process up to}} 7 {{separate}} colors, {{giving them}} a wider color gamut.|$|R
5000|$|... 3LCD {{projectors}} {{can have}} higher color light output than single-chip <b>DLP</b> <b>projectors.</b> This is because 3LCD projectors mix and project the light beams {{from all three}} colors to form each individual pixel's color, while single-chip <b>DLP</b> <b>projectors</b> create colors by projecting them in sequence {{one at a time}} and rely on human color perception to mix and interpret the correct colors for each pixel.|$|R
50|$|<b>DLP</b> <b>projector</b> using Texas Instruments’ DLP technology. This uses one, two, {{or three}} {{microfabricated}} light valves called digital micromirror devices (DMDs). The single- and double-DMD versions use rotating color wheels {{in time with}} the mirror refreshes to modulate color. The most common problem with the single- or two-DMD varieties is a visible “rainbow” which some people perceive when moving their eyes. More recent projectors with higher speed (2x or 4x) and otherwise optimised color wheels have lessened this effect. Systems with 3 DMDs never have this problem, as they display each primary color simultaneously.|$|E

It was originally developed in 1987 by Larry Hornbeck of Texas Instruments.

5000|$|The {{screen door}} effect on Digital Light Processing (DLP) {{projectors}} can be mitigated by deliberately setting the projected image {{slightly out of}} focus, which blurs the boundaries of each pixel to its neighbor. This minimizes the effect by filling the black pixel perimeters with adjacent light. Some older LCD projectors have a more noticeable screen door effect than first generation DLP projectors. [...] Newer DLP chip designs promise closer spacing of the mirror elements which would reduce this effect; however, some space is still required along one edge of the mirror to provide a control circuit pathway. Use of Dolgoff's depixelization method could also produce a <b>DLP</b> <b>projector</b> without noticeable pixelation.|$|E
5000|$|... 3LCD {{projectors}} {{are able}} to display finer image gradations by giving each pixel on the projected image a smooth variation in brightness levels. This is because the liquid crystals for each pixel on an LCD panel can be given fine levels of opacity by varying the electrical charge. On the other hand, a single-chip <b>DLP</b> <b>projector</b> has a single mirror reflecting the lamp light to the lens on its DMD chip for each pixel. It varies the brightness of each pixel by vibrating the mirror between its on or off state in varying frequencies and relies on human perception to interpret the brightness of each pixel.|$|E
5000|$|Digital media {{playback}} of high-resolution 2K files {{has at least}} a 20-year history. Early video data storage units (RAIDs) fed custom frame buffer systems with large memories.

On October 23, 1998, Digital Light Processing (<b>DLP)</b> <b>projector</b> technology was publicly demonstrated with the release of The Last Broadcast, the first feature-length movie, shot, edited and distributed digitally. In conjunction with Texas Instruments, the movie was publicly demonstrated in five theaters across the United States (Philadelphia, Portland (Oregon), Minneapolis, Providence, and Orlando).|$|E

DLP technology is used in DLP front projectors (standalone projection units for classrooms and business primarily), but also in private homes; in these cases, the image is projected onto a projection screen.

5000|$|Digital Light Processing (DLP) projector: A <b>DLP</b> <b>projector</b> {{creates an}} image using a digital micromirror device (DMD chip), which {{on its surface}} {{contains}} a large matrix of microscopic mirrors, each corresponding to one pixel in an image. Each mirror can be rotated to reflect light such that the pixel appears bright, or the mirror can be rotated to direct light elsewhere and make the pixel appear dark. The mirror is made of aluminum and is rotated on an axle hinge. There are electrodes {{on both sides of}} the hinge controlling the rotation of the mirror using electrostatic attraction. The electrodes are connected to an SRAM cell located under each pixel, and charges from the SRAM cell drive the movement of the mirrors. Color is added to the image-creation process either through a spinning color wheel (used with a single-chip projector) or a three-chip (red, green, blue) projector. The color wheel is placed between the lamp light source and the DMD chip such that the light passing through is colored and then reflected off a mirror to determine the level of darkness. A color wheel consists of a red, green, and blue sector, as well as a fourth sector to either control brightness or include a fourth color. This spinning color wheel in the single-chip arrangement can be replaced by red, green, and blue light-emitting diodes (LED). The three-chip projector uses a prism to split up the light into three beams (red, green, blue), each directed towards its own DMD chip. The outputs of the three DMD chips are recombined and then projected.|$|E

Each mirror can be tilted to reflect light such that the pixel appears bright, or the mirror can be tilted to direct light elsewhere (where it is absorbed) to make the pixel appear dark. Mirrors flip between light and dark positions, so subpixel brightness is controlled by proportionally varying {{the amount of time}} a mirror is in the bright position; its pulse-width modulation. The mirror is made of aluminum and is mounted on a torsion-supported yoke. There are electrodes {{on both sides of the}} yoke that control the tilt of the mirror using electrostatic attraction.
