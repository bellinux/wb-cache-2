Greenstone was fashioned into earrings and necklaces, with the most well-known design being the hei-tiki, a distorted human figure sitting cross-legged with its head tilted to the side. Europeans brought English fashion etiquette to New Zealand, and until the 1950s most people <b>dressed</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> social occasions. Standards have since relaxed and New Zealand fashion has received {{a reputation for being}} casual, practical and lacklustre. However, the local fashion industry has grown significantly since 2000, doubling exports and increasing from a handful to about 50 established labels, with some labels gaining international recognition.|$|E

He <b>dressed</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> the sound check in his trademark black leather stage gear, and added a chain around his neck with a Joan of Arc medallion, which he had bought on arrival at Calais. One version of the story says he gave such an extraordinary performance at the sound check, that the organizers decided to put Taylor {{at the top of the}} bill for both shows. As a result of his performance at those two shows, Eddie Barclay signed him to a six-year record deal on the Barclay label.|$|E
500|$|Steve Huey of Allmusic {{contrasts}} Brooks' and Dunn's voices, {{saying that}} Dunn [...] "was the quietly intense singer with the soulful voice, while Kix Brooks played {{the part of}} the high-energy showman." [...] He also describes their sound as [...] "a winning formula of rambunctious, rocked-up honky tonk with punchy, danceable beats [...] smooth, pop-tinged ballads." [...] In the book The New Generation of County Music Stars, David Dicaire describes Dunn as [...] "possess a soulful voice with a quiet intensity" [...] and a [...] "traditional country singer", while calling Brooks [...] "the opposite to Dunn's musical personality," [...] "a high-energy showman" [...] and [...] "the perfect accompaniment to his partner". Brooks sang lead on [...] "Lost and Found", [...] "Rock My World", [...] "You're Gonna Miss Me When I'm Gone", [...] "Mama Don't Get <b>Dressed</b> <b>Up</b> <b>for</b> Nothing", [...] "Why Would I Say Goodbye", and [...] "South of Santa Fe".|$|E
500|$|The {{first single}} from Brooks & Dunn's fourth album, Borderline, was a cover version of B.W. Stevenson's 1972 single [...] "My Maria". Brooks & Dunn's {{version of the}} song spent three weeks at number one in mid-1996 and peaked at number 79 on the Billboard Hot 100; it was also that year's top country song {{according}} to the Billboard Year-End charts. Dunn {{said that he was}} initially reluctant to record [...] "My Maria" [...] because the duo had not previously recorded any cover songs. The song won Brooks & Dunn its second Grammy Award for Best Country Performance by a Group or Duo, and the duo won the 1996 Entertainer of the Year award from both the Country Music Association and Academy of Country Music, making them the first duo to win that award from the former. In 1997, Brooks & Dunn joined a double-headliner tour with Reba McEntire. Borderline produced another number one in [...] "A Man This Lonely", along with the top ten hits [...] "I Am That Man" [...] and [...] "Why Would I Say Goodbye".

500|$|The {{next day}} Kenny rejoins his friends, who are <b>dressed</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> a Halloween costume contest. Stan is dressed as Raggedy Andy (since Wendy {{would be going}} as Raggedy Ann, thus making a pair), Kyle wears a Chewbacca mask, and Cartman is dressed as Adolf Hitler, much to the fury of Kyle, who is Jewish. A zombified Kenny joins the boys, but they fail to notice {{that he is a}} zombie. At school, Kyle gets more annoyed after {{discovering}} that the other students (as well as Mr. Hat) are also dressed as Chewbacca, while Mr. Garrison is dressed as Marilyn Monroe. Worst of all, Wendy is dressed as Chewbacca; she explains that she changed costumes because they would have looked stupid as the Raggedy couple and she figured Stan would realize it too. A stubborn Kyle decides to make a new costume so he can win the prize, two tons of candy. Both Chef (dressed as Evel Knievel) and Principal Victoria are annoyed to see Cartman dressed as Hitler. Victoria makes him a [...] "ghost" [...] costume but he ends up looking more like a Ku Klux Klan member, which annoys Chef even more. At the contest, which is judged by Tina Yothers, Wendy (despite wearing the same costume as the other students) wins the candy, much to the fury of Kyle, who is now dressed as the Solar System. Stan wins the worst costume and everyone laughs at him, leaving him humiliated.|$|E

60|$|Such were my fancies and cogitations {{during the}} day, {{the greater part}} of which was spent in my chamber, for I was still languid. My evening was passed in the drawing-room, where I {{overlooked}} Miss Somerville's portfolio of sketches.

They were all her own, and free from those cunning tints and touches of the drawing-master, by which young ladies' drawings, like their heads, are <b>dressed</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> company. There was no garish and vulgar trick of colors, either; all was executed with singular truth and simplicity.|$|E
