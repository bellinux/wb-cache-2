5|$|Mossy fibers {{enter the}} <b>granular</b> <b>layer</b> from their points of origin, many {{arising from the}} pontine nuclei, others from the spinal cord, {{vestibular}} nuclei etc. In the human cerebellum, {{the total number of}} mossy fibers has been estimated at about 200 million. These fibers form excitatory synapses with the granule cells and the cells of the deep cerebellar nuclei. Within the <b>granular</b> <b>layer,</b> a mossy fiber generates a series of enlargements called rosettes. The contacts between mossy fibers and granule cell dendrites take place within structures called glomeruli. Each glomerulus has a mossy fiber rosette at its center, and up to 20 granule cell dendritic claws contacting it. Terminals from Golgi cells infiltrate the structure and make inhibitory synapses onto the granule cell dendrites. The entire assemblage is surrounded by a sheath of glial cells. Each mossy fiber sends collateral branches to several cerebellar folia, generating a total of 20–30 rosettes; thus a single mossy fiber makes contact with an estimated 400–600 granule cells.|$|E
5|$|The {{cerebellar}} cortex {{is divided into}} three layers. At the bottom lies the thick <b>granular</b> <b>layer,</b> densely packed with granule cells, along with interneurons, mainly Golgi cells but also including Lugaro cells and unipolar brush cells. In the middle lies the Purkinje layer, a narrow zone that contains the cell bodies of Purkinje cells and Bergmann glial cells. At the top lies the molecular layer, which contains the flattened dendritic trees of Purkinje cells, along with the huge array of parallel fibers penetrating the Purkinje cell dendritic trees at right angles. This outermost layer of the {{cerebellar cortex}} also contains two types of inhibitory interneuron: stellate cells and basket cells. Both stellate and basket cells form GABAergic synapses onto Purkinje cell dendrites.|$|E
5|$|The perforant path is {{the main}} output pathway of the entorhinal cortex (EC). The flow of {{information}} in the hippocampus is largely unidirectional. Axons from the pyramidal cells (in EC layer II) perforate the subiculum to project mainly to the <b>granular</b> <b>layer</b> in the dentate gyrus (first synaptic connection). Some axons project to CA3 and a lesser number project to CA1. The dentate granule cell axons, called mossy fibers, pass on the information, to the dendrites of CA3 pyramidal cells (second synaptic connection). From there, CA3 axons called Schaffer collaterals leave the deep part of the cell body and loop up to the apical dendrites and then extend to CA1. Axons from CA1 then project back to the entorhinal cortex (third synaptic connection) completing the trisynaptic loop or circuit.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the nature of}} friction in <b>granular</b> <b>layers</b> by means of numerical simulation focusing on the critical slip distance, over which the system relaxes to a new stationary state. Analyzing a transient {{process in which the}} sliding velocity is instantaneously changed, we find that the critical slip distance is proportional to the sliding velocity. We thus define the relaxation time, which is independent of the sliding velocity. It is found that the relaxation time is proportional to the layer thickness and inversely proportional to the square root of the pressure. An evolution law for the relaxation process is proposed, which does not contain any length constants describing the surface geometry but the relaxation time of the bulk granular matter. As a result, the critical slip distance is scaled with a typical length scale of a system. It is proportional to the layer thickness in an instantaneous velocity change experiment, whereas it is scaled with the total slip distance in a spring-block system on <b>granular</b> <b>layers.</b> 1...|$|R
