5|$|Another stock {{plot device}} in the 1970s was the gay {{character}} in a police drama. They served as victims of blackmail or anti-gay violence, but more often as criminals. Beginning in the late 1960s with N.Y.P.D., Police Story, and Police Woman, the use of homosexuals in stories became much more prevalent, according to Vito Russo, {{as a response to}} their higher profiles in gay activism. Lesbians were included as villains, motivated to murder by their desires, internalized homophobia, or fear of being exposed as homosexual. One episode of Police Woman earned protests by the National Gay Task Force before it aired for portraying a trio of murderous lesbians who killed retirement home patients <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>money.</b> NBC edited the episode because of the protests, but a sit-in was staged in the head of NBC's offices.|$|E
5|$|On a cold, rainy Friday night, only 4,124 spectators paid {{to see the}} game, more to see {{players from}} the Philadelphia Eagles, the local American {{football}} team, play an exhibition basketball game against their colleagues from the Baltimore Colts before the NBA game started. The arena's capacity was over 8,000, and Warriors owner Eddie Gottlieb was infamous for exaggerating attendance numbers. Warriors home attendance had dropped from 7,000 in Chamberlain's rookie season to less than 5,000 in this, his third, season.

BMO talks Finn into spending the money at an expensive resort at Wildberry Kingdom. When they arrive in the town square, Jake unloads their treasure into the city's fountain. A guard scolds them for this, but they bribe him with a few shillings and a crown, freeing them from the law. Chaos follows shortly after Jake uses wealth to control the residents. When they disrespect her authority, Wildberry Princess (Maria Bamford) orders Finn and Jake to be arrested and <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>money</b> to be seized and melted down. Her punishment is for them to be covered in the molten gold, but BMO and N.E.P.T.R. arrive just in time and save the two.|$|E

5|$|Over time, {{the economists}} in the Eisenhower {{administration}} became frustrated with Diem's refusal to devaluate the piaster once the Republic of Vietnam {{had become a}} stable nation. Diem refused to make the CIP exchange rate equivalent to the free market exchange rate for the two currencies. Although the fixed exchange rate meant that Americans were heavily funding the South Vietnamese economy and that the importing firms could obtain more goods <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>money,</b> the rate also meant that South Vietnam goods would not be economically competitive on the export market. Diem was reluctant to cut the currency rate, arguing that it would diminish the value of US aid to South Vietnam and undermine the urban middle class support for his regime as they would resent {{the loss of their}} cheap consumer and luxury goods. In 1963, the US Ambassador Frederick Nolting and his economic advisers exhorted Diem to spend more of the CIP funds on rural development in an attempt to shore up peasant support in the face of increasing communist pressure, but were rebuffed.|$|E

25|$|Mafiosi have {{protected}} {{a great variety}} of clients over the years: landowners, plantation owners, politicians, shopkeepers, drug dealers, etc. Whilst some people are coerced into buying protection and some do not receive any actual protection <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>money</b> (extortion), by and large there are many clients who actively seek and benefit from mafioso protection. This {{is one of the main}} reasons why the Mafia has resisted more than a century of government efforts to destroy it: the people who willingly solicit these services protect the Mafia from the authorities. If one is enjoying the benefits of Mafia protection, one does not want the police arresting one's mafioso.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1900s, the first {{world-class}} South African cricket team emerged, comprising stars such Bonnor Middleton, Jimmy Sinclair, Charlie Llewellyn, Dave Nourse, Louis Tancred, Aubrey Faulkner, Reggie Schwarz, Percy Sherwell, Tip Snooke, Bert Vogler, and Gordon White, {{players who were}} capable of giving any international teams a run <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>money.</b> In addition to possessing batsmen such as Sinclair (the batsman with the highest strike rate in Test history), Nourse, Tancred, all-rounder Faulkner, Sherwell, Snooke, and White, the South Africans developed the world's first (and arguably greatest ever) spin attack which specialized in googly. Greatest among the South African googly quartet was Schwarz, who inspired by English googly bowler Bernard Bosanquet, regarded as {{the inventor of the}} googly, developed into the most devastating googly bowler of his time. He taught diligently the secrets of the googly to allrounder Faulkner, medium-pacer Vogler and specialist batsman White, and together the four formed a quartet which began to lead South Africa to unprecedented heights in Test cricket. Another important force during this period for South Africa were the all-round performances of Faulkner and Llewellyn. Faulkner came to be regarded as the first great South African all-rounders in the international game, regarded by some as even the greatest all-rounder in the world in the pre-1st World War period.|$|E

Both Gacy and Nilsen habitually murdered men they had taken home as lovers, with Gacy storing bodies in the crawl space of his home, and Nilsen keeping corpses in wardrobes and under the floorboards. Puente would kill her tenants <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>money</b> and bury their bodies in the gardens of the properties they were renting.|$|E

500|$|Alarmed {{by these}} incidents, Coloman forbade the crusaders who arrived under the {{leadership}} of Count Emicho in the middle of July to enter Hungary. Ignoring the king's order, they broke through the defensive lines and laid siege to Moson. Their catapults destroyed the walls in two places, enabling them to storm into the fortress on 15August. Coloman made preparations to flee to Rus', fearing that the crusaders would occupy the whole country. However, for no apparent reason, a panic broke out among the attackers that enabled the garrison to carry out a sortie and rout them. Modern scholars agree that rumours about the sudden arrival of Coloman's army frightened the crusaders off from the fortress. According to Albert of Aix, contemporaneous Christians thought that Emicho's defeat was a punishment that God inflicted on the pilgrims because they had massacred many Jews [...] "rather from greed <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>money</b> than for divine justice".|$|E

That day, the National Bank of Commerce where J.P. Morgan was a dominant factor, announced it would not serve as clearing house for the Knickerbocker. On October 22, the Knickerbocker faced a classic bank run. From the bank's opening, the crowd grew. As The New York Times reported, [...] "as fast as a depositor went out of the place ten people and more came asking <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>money</b> [...] were asked to send some men to keep order".

500|$|Marlborough was ruthlessly ambitious, {{relentless}} in {{the pursuit}} of wealth, power and social advancement, earning him a reputation for avarice and miserliness. These traits may have been exaggerated for the purposes of party faction but, notes Trevelyan, nearly all other statesmen of the day were engaged in founding families and amassing estates at the public expense; Marlborough only differed in that he gave the public much more value <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>money.</b> In his quest for fame and personal interests he could be unscrupulous, as his desertion of JamesII testifies. To Macaulay this is regarded as a piece of selfish treachery against his patron; an analysis shared by the historian G. K. Chesterton: [...] "Churchill, as if to add something ideal to his imitation of Iscariot, went to James with wanton professions of love and loyalty... and then calmly handed over the army to the invader". To Trevelyan, Marlborough's behaviour during the 1688 revolution was a sign of his [...] "devotion to the liberties of England and the Protestant religion". However, his continuing correspondence with Saint-Germain was not noble. Although Marlborough did not wish for a Jacobite restoration his double-dealing ensured that WilliamIII and GeorgeI would never be fully disposed to trust him.|$|E
500|$|Series {{of various}} genres, {{featuring}} recurrent, title-worthy characters or name actors in familiar roles, were particularly popular {{during the first}} decade of sound film. Fox's many B series, for instance, included Charlie Chan mysteries, Ritz Brothers comedies, and musicals with child star Jane Withers. These series films are {{not to be confused with}} the short, cliffhanger-structured serials that sometimes appeared on the same program. As with serials, however, many series were intended to attract young people—a theater that twin-billed part-time might run a [...] "balanced" [...] or entirely youth-oriented double feature as a matinee and then a single film for a more mature audience at night. In the words of one industry report, afternoon moviegoers, [...] "composed largely of housewives and children, want quantity <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>money</b> while the evening crowds want 'something good and not too much of it.'" [...] Series films are often unquestioningly consigned to the B movie category, but even here there is ambiguity: at MGM, for example, popular series like the Andy Hardy chronicles had leading stars and budgets that would have been A-level at some of the lesser majors. For many series, even a lesser major's standard B budget was far out of reach: Poverty Row's Consolidated Pictures featured Tarzan, the Police Dog in a series with the proud name of Melodramatic Dog Features.|$|E
