40|$|Abstract. Researchers have {{recently}} demonstrated display positioning using optical sensors {{in conjunction with}} temporally-coded patterns of projected light. This paper extends that concept in two important directions. First, we enable such sensors to determine their own location without using radio synchronization signals – allowing cheaper sensors and protecting location privacy. Second, we track the optical sensors over time using adaptive patterns, minimizing the extent of distracting temporal codes to small regions and enabling {{the remainder of the}} illuminated region to serve as a useful display while tracking. Our algorithms have been integrated into a prototype system that projects content onto a small, moving surface to create an inexpensive hand-held display for pervasive computing applications. 1 Introduction & Related Work Augmenting objects in the world with projected computer output is becoming more feasible as projector prices fall and quality improves.

50|$|Performance surf boards were {{traditionally}} {{made from}} laminated layers over <b>foam</b> <b>cores.</b> SUP <b>boards</b> are larger boards {{and the desire}} to travel with them has {{led to the development of}} an inflatable system where the board and pump can be carried in a back pack. The core material is called 'drop stitch'. Thousands of locked nylon stitches keep the board at a specific thickness. Pressure from specially designed hand pumps can inflate a board to over 30Psi. This creates a board not much less rigid than a hard board. This makes inflatable boards both durable and transportable.|$|R

It reduces the effects of rapid changes in relative humidity around the painting, provides some protection from pressure or direct contact against the canvas back, and protects from vibrations caused by handling or moving. Backing boards also serve to protect from dust and dirt, cracks and deformations from handling, and insect activity. Some {{of the most commonly}} used types of backing <b>boards</b> include <b>foam</b> <b>core,</b> heritage <b>board,</b> matboard, cardboard/millboard, coroplast, corrugated plastic sheets, acrylic sheeting, mylar, and fabric.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, a {{total of}} five {{structural}} insulated panel shear walls (SIPSW), in which with plywood facing and polystyrene <b>foam</b> <b>board</b> <b>core,</b> were tested under low cyclic horizontal loading. For the test specimens, different wall depth-width ratio and the opening sizes have been considered. The failure modes, failure mechanics, bearing capacity, lateral stiffness and ductility are discussed in detail. The test results showed that the hysteretic curve of SIPSW shows a reversed S-shape. Also the depth-to-width ratio and the opening dimensions of the shear walls have significant effects on load bearing capacity, ductility and elastic stiffness. What’s more, the performance of the SIPSW specimens was controlled by the fastener slip behavior of the SIP-to-spline connection, especially along the bottom spline. Finally, it is indicated that SIPSW have a good satisfaction upon seismic performance when used to timber structures...|$|R

Force-displacement curves and the cross-sections of damaged sandwich panels were analyzed. Effects of core thickness, face-sheet thickness and toughness of face-sheet materials were discussed {{by comparison with}} different specimens subjected to quasi-static indentation testing. Results showed that damage {{behavior of}} sandwich composites had identical feature. Collapse of <b>foam</b> <b>core</b> initially appeared, and then <b>foam</b> <b>core</b> generated crack. Delamination and fiber breakage of upper face-sheet occurred. Finally, the <b>foam</b> <b>core</b> and the face-sheet were disengaged.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Sandwich plates used {{in marine}} {{structures}} {{are made of}} laminated face sheets bonded to a structural <b>foam</b> <b>core.</b> Low-velocity impact by a stiff indenter may cause local deflection of the face sheet and permanent deformation or crushing of an underlying volume of the <b>foam</b> <b>core.</b> Upon unloading, the face sheet tends to spring back, while the permanent strain in the core gives rise to residual stresses that may nucleate local interfacial cracks. Extension of such interfacial cracks by applied loads can compromise structural integrity. This article examines the protective effect of thin, ductile interlayers, inserted between the face sheet and the <b>foam</b> <b>core,</b> that absorb the face sheet deflection and thus prevent or reduce the extent of damage to the <b>foam</b> <b>core.</b> Finite element solutions are obtained for a stiff, incompressible, and very ductile polyurethane (PUR) interlayer, and also for a compliant and compressible elastomeric foam (EF) layer, in a sandwich plate made of quasi-isotropic AS 4 / 3501 - 6 laminated face sheets and H 100 PVC core. Loading is applied by a concentrated force acting on a rigid cylindrical indenter. Results show that the PUR interlayer better supports the impacted face sheet than does the <b>foam</b> <b>core</b> or the EF interlayer. The PUR layer also reduces the extent of permanent deformation of the <b>foam</b> <b>core.</b> At a given magnitude of applied load, the energy release rate for cracks extended by residual stresses at the interface between the <b>foam</b> <b>core</b> and either interlayer is much lower than that at the interface between the face sheet and the <b>foam</b> <b>core</b> in the conventional design.

40|$|AbstractAnalytical {{predictions}} {{are presented}} for the plastic collapse strength of lightweight sandwich beams having pin-reinforced <b>foam</b> <b>cores</b> that are loaded in 3 -point bending. Both polymer and aluminum <b>foam</b> <b>cores</b> are considered, whilst the facesheet and the pins {{are made of}} either composite or metal. Four different failure modes are account for: metal facesheet yield or composite facesheet microbuckling, facesheet wrinkling, plastic shear of the core, and facesheet indentation beneath the loading rollers. A micromechanics-based model is developed and combined with the homogenization approach to calculate the effective properties of pin-reinforced <b>foam</b> <b>cores.</b> To calculate the elastic buckling strength of pin reinforcements, the pin-reinforced <b>foam</b> <b>core</b> is treated as assemblies of simply supported columns resting upon an elastic foundation. Minimum mass design of the sandwich is then obtained {{as a function of}} the prescribed structural load index, subjected to the constraint that none of the above failure modes occurs. Collapse mechanism maps are constructed and compared with the failure maps of foam-cored sandwich beams without pin reinforcements. Finite element simulations are carried out to verify the analytical model and to study the performance and failure mechanisms of the sandwich subject to loading types other than 3 -point bending. The results demonstrate that the weaker the foam is, the more optimal the pin-reinforced <b>foam</b> <b>core</b> becomes, and that sandwich beams with pin-reinforced polymer <b>foam</b> <b>cores</b> are structurally more efficient than foam- or truss-cored sandwich beams...|$|R
