From 1946 to 1951 he was Commissioner of shipping, the press, communication, labor and social security. He voted for Algerian independence on 27 August 1947 and {{for the establishment of}} a Council of Europe on 9 July 1949.|$|E
5|$|Félix Delahaye (born 1767 {{and died}} 1829) was a French {{gardener}} {{who served on}} the Bruni d'Entrecasteaux voyage (1791–93) that was sent by the <b>French</b> <b>National</b> <b>Assembly</b> to search for the missing explorer Jean-François La Perouse. He {{was also one of the}} earliest European gardeners to work in Australia.|$|E
5|$|Starting in late 1945, Madagascar's first <b>French</b> <b>National</b> <b>Assembly</b> deputies, Joseph Raseta, Joseph Ravoahangy and Jacques Rabemananjara of the Mouvement démocratique de la rénovation malgache (MDRM) {{political}} party, led {{an effort}} to achieve independence for Madagascar through legal channels. The failure of this initiative and the harsh response it drew from the Socialist Ramadier administration radicalized elements of the Malagasy population, including leaders of several militant nationalist secret societies.|$|E
50|$|He {{was elected}} on 16 June 2002, {{representing}} the Hauts-de-Seine, near Paris. He {{is president of}} the <b>French</b> <b>National</b> <b>Assembly's</b> committee on Economic Affairs, the Environment, and Territory. He is interested in renewable energies, and Africa, being head of the French-Libyan friendship group in the <b>National</b> <b>Assembly.</b>|$|R

5|$|All three {{leaders were}} the descendents of Hova {{who had been}} {{politically}} prominent in the former Merina royal court. The movement was pacifist, and while it sought independence for Madagascar, it embraced the French vision of the island {{as part of the}} global Francophone economic and cultural community. Their platform garnered mass support that cut across geographic, ethnic and class divisions, and in November 1946 the trio were elected to represent Madagascar as deputies (députés) in the <b>French</b> <b>National</b> <b>Assembly.</b> The Malagasy deputies submitted a bill to liberate Madagascar from French rule, but French deputies rejected it.|$|E
5|$|At {{the first}} post-war {{constituent}} assembly convened in Paris in November 1945 to draft {{the constitution of}} the French Fourth Republic, Madagascar was represented by two doctors named Joseph Raseta and Joseph Ravoahangy. They formed the Mouvement démocratique de la rénovation malgache (MDRM) political party together with future writer Jacques Rabemananjara in early 1946. All three leaders were the descendents of Hova Merina who had been politically prominent in the former royal court. The party's platform was built on national independence from France and garnered mass support that cut across geographic, ethnic and class divisions. In November 1946 the trio were elected to represent Madagascar as deputies (députés) in the <b>French</b> <b>National</b> <b>Assembly.</b>|$|E
5|$|In Algeria, the Muslims {{were not}} {{considered}} French and did not share the same political or economic benefits. For example, the indigenous population did not own most of the settlements, farms, or businesses, although they numbered nearly nine million (versus roughly one million Pieds-Noirs) at independence. Politically, the Muslim Algerians had no representation in the <b>French</b> <b>National</b> <b>Assembly</b> until 1945 and wielded limited influence in local governance. To obtain citizenship, {{they were required to}} renounce their Muslim identity. Since this would constitute apostasy, only about 2,500Muslims acquired citizenship before 1930. The settlers' politically and economically dominant position worsened relations between the two groups.|$|E
5000|$|Joseph-Henri baron de Jessé [...] (1755-1794) was a French nobleman and {{government}} official, {{who served as}} President of the <b>French</b> <b>National</b> Constituent <b>Assembly</b> from 30 August 1790 to 10 September 1790.|$|R
50|$|The <b>French</b> <b>National</b> Constituent <b>Assembly</b> set up Drôme {{as one of}} the {{original}} 83 departments of France on March 4, 1790, during the French Revolution. The territory formed part of the former French province of Dauphiné.|$|R
25|$|During the <b>French</b> Revolution, the <b>National</b> <b>Assembly,</b> which existed from June 17 to July 9 of 1789, was a {{transitional}} body between the Estates-General and the <b>National</b> Constituent <b>Assembly.</b>|$|R
5|$|In the {{critical}} November 1946 election {{to select the}} first ever deputies to represent Madagascar at the <b>French</b> <b>National</b> <b>Assembly,</b> MDRM accused the French administration of stuffing ballot boxes, tampering with electoral rolls, intimidating MDRM candidates and supporters, and blatantly falsifying election results to ensure PADESM victory. Despite these irregularities, MDRM won 71 percent of the vote, {{and none of the}} PADESM candidates was elected. While MDRM won decisive victories in the central and eastern province, results were close in the western province, where the MDRM candidate Joseph Raseta won 21,475 votes and the PADESM candidate Totelehibe won 19,014 votes.|$|E
5|$|Malagasy {{hopes for}} greater {{sovereignty}} were stirred by remarks given by General Charles de Gaulle at the Brazzaville Conference in 1944, where de Gaulle announced all colonies were thereafter French overseas territories entitled to {{representation in the}} <b>French</b> <b>National</b> <b>Assembly,</b> and promised citizenship rights to residents of its overseas colonies. Despite the partial implementation of these reforms, forced labor on French-owned plantations and other rights abuses in Madagascar continued unabated. The nationalist secret society Panama (Patriotes nationalistes malgaches) was founded in 1941, followed in 1943 by another called Jiny after a type of local red bird. Both organizations, which sought to achieve independence by force if necessary, saw their membership swell during this period.|$|E
5|$|Parizeau's {{hopes for}} {{international}} recognition, a practical requirement of statehood, rested with France and the Francophonie. He {{believed that if}} Quebec declared independence in these circumstances, President of the <b>French</b> <b>National</b> <b>Assembly</b> Philippe Séguin, a powerful Gaullist power broker who was sympathetic to the sovereignty movement, would pressure President Chirac to recognize the declaration. He counted on a French recognition to spread quickly to the Francophonie and bring the issue to a head. Benoit Bouchard, Canada's ambassador at the time, believed that the plan was irrational as he doubted Séguin, {{who was supposed to}} be a neutral figure in his role, could bring sufficient pressure in the country's semi-presidential system.|$|E
50|$|The {{president}} {{was elected by}} the Congress of the French Parliament, a joint meeting of both houses of the <b>French</b> Parliament (the <b>National</b> <b>Assembly</b> and the Senate).|$|R
50|$|The <b>French</b> <b>National</b> <b>Assembly's</b> refusal on 30 August 1954 {{to ratify}} the treaty {{establishing}} the European Defence Community, seemed initially to block the process of integration. However, the danger that after {{the failure of the}} EDC, France and Germany would lead their own policy caused the Benelux countries to retake the initiative in the European project. At the Messina Conference (1-3 June 1955) submitted a memorandum in which they proposed a common market. Luxembourg played only a minor role in the Messina initiative. Bech was worried about the extension of supranationality, and was wary of the prospect of totally free circulation of goods and persons. The memorandum was mostly the work of his Belgian and Dutch colleagues, Paul-Henri Spaak and Johan Willem Beyen. At the negotiations of Val Duchesse, which prepared the path for the Treaty of Rome, the Luxembourgish government sent a small delegation led by the former minister Lambert Schaus.|$|R
2500|$|During the <b>French</b> Revolution, the <b>National</b> <b>Assembly</b> (...) , which existed from June 13, 1789 to July 9, 1789, was {{a revolutionary}} {{assembly}} {{formed by the}} representatives of the Third Estate (the common people) of the Estates-General; thereafter (until replaced by the Legislative Assembly on Sept. 30, 1791) it was known as the <b>National</b> Constituent <b>Assembly</b> (...) , though popularly the shorter form persisted.|$|R
5|$|Since 1988 {{the church}} {{has been the subject}} of {{recurring}} public controversy; anti-cult associations and organizations (UNADFI, CCMM and MILS – then MIVILUDES), former members and the vast majority of media presented it as a dangerous group, mainly because of its intensive missionary activities and healing practices. The church was eventually listed as a cult in the 1995 and 1999 parliamentary reports established by the <b>French</b> <b>National</b> <b>Assembly.</b> Protestant and academic circles, however, disagreed with this assessment, considering the church to be a genuine Pentecostal group. The latter responded to criticism through a defensive strategy, which included outreach to sociologists and historians and better ties with mainstream religions, local and national institutions.|$|E
5|$|Wollstonecraft was {{prompted}} {{to write the}} Rights of Woman after reading Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord's 1791 report to the <b>French</b> <b>National</b> <b>Assembly,</b> which stated that women should only receive a domestic education; she used her commentary on this specific event to launch a broad attack against sexual double standards and to indict men for encouraging women to indulge in excessive emotion. Wollstonecraft wrote the Rights of Woman hurriedly to respond directly to ongoing events; she intended to write a more thoughtful second volume but died before completing it.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the passage}} of the Loi Cadre by the <b>French</b> <b>National</b> <b>Assembly</b> in 1956, many of the colonies in French West African began to hold {{elections}} to increase the self-determination of their territories. In the first elections held in French Sudan in 1957, the African Democratic Rally (Rassemblement Démocratique Africain, commonly known as the RDA) won the elections in French Sudan, as well as winning majorities in neighboring Ivory Coast, French Guinea, and the Upper Volta. Following the French constitutional referendum of 1958, of which received an overwhelming majority in support, the République Soudanaise declared itself a republic with internal autonomy on 24 November 1958. The Sudanese Republic, as the area was now called, was the second colony after Madagascar to join the French Community, which provided it internal autonomy while linking its currency, foreign policy and defense with France.|$|E
50|$|Compayré was {{a justice}} of the peace. He served in the Council of Five Hundred during the French Directory, {{followed}} by the Corps législatif during the <b>French</b> Consulate (later <b>National</b> <b>Assembly)</b> from 1798 to 1803, representing Tarn. He was a proponent of the Coup of 18 Brumaire, which brought General Napoleon Bonaparte to power as First Consul of France.|$|R
25|$|Banker Ernest Backes from Clearstream (Luxembourg) {{claimed he}} was in charge of the {{transfer}} of $7 million from Chase Manhattan Bank and Citibank, January 16, 1980, to pay for the liberation of the hostages. He gave copies of the files to the <b>National</b> <b>French</b> <b>Assembly.</b>|$|R
50|$|English is not {{designated}} {{an official}} language by Quebec law. However, both English and French {{are required by}} the Constitution Act, 1867 for the enactment of laws and regulations and any person may use English or <b>French</b> in the <b>National</b> <b>Assembly</b> and the courts of Quebec. The books and records of the <b>National</b> <b>Assembly</b> must also be kept in both languages. Until 1969, Quebec was the only officially bilingual province in Canada and most public institutions functioned in both languages. English was also used in the legislature, government commissions and courts.|$|R
5|$|From July to October 1948 in Antananarivo, the French {{organized}} a large public {{trial of the}} uprising, charging 77 officials of the MDRM. The French authorities claimed that MDRM appeals for calm immediately prior to the outbreak of violence had been a diversion tactic to mask their involvement in organizing the rebellion, which the French alleged was secretly launched by way of an encoded MDRM telegram. Deputies Ravoahangy and Rabemananjara were arrested and imprisoned on 12 April 1947, followed two months later by Raseta (who was in Paris when the Uprising began), in violation {{of their right to}} diplomatic immunity. Debates about the Malagasy Uprising in the <b>French</b> <b>National</b> <b>Assembly</b> on 1 August 1947 concluded with the decision to revoke this immunity for all three deputies, who were tortured in prison.|$|E
5|$|In 1846 the New York Tribune sent Fuller to Europe, {{specifically}} England and Italy, as {{its first}} female foreign correspondent. She traveled from Boston to Liverpool in August on the Cambria, a vessel that used both sail and steam to make the journey in ten days and sixteen hours. Over {{the next four years}} she provided the Tribune with thirty-seven reports. She interviewed many prominent writers including George Sand and Thomas Carlylewhom she found disappointing because of his reactionary politics, among other things. George Sand had previously been an idol of hers, but Fuller was disappointed when Sand chose not to run for the <b>French</b> <b>National</b> <b>Assembly,</b> saying that women were not ready to vote or to hold political office. Fuller was also given a letter of introduction to Elizabeth Barrett by Cornelius Mathews, but did not meet her at that time, because Barrett had just eloped with Robert Browning.|$|E
5|$|Another {{important}} factor was the {{development in the}} late 18th and early 19th centuries of museums with large natural history collections. These museums received specimens from collectors {{around the world and}} served as centers for the study of comparative anatomy and morphology. These disciplines played key roles {{in the development of a}} more technically sophisticated form of natural history. One of the first and most important examples was the Museum of Natural History in Paris, which was at the center of many of the developments in natural history during the first decades of the 19th century. It was founded in 1793 by an act of the <b>French</b> <b>National</b> <b>Assembly,</b> and was based on an extensive royal collection plus the private collections of aristocrats confiscated during the French revolution, and expanded by material seized in French military conquests during the Napoleonic Wars. The Paris museum was the professional base for Cuvier, and his professional rival Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire. The English anatomists Robert Grant and Richard Owen both spent time studying there. Owen would go on to become the leading British morphologist while working at the museum of the Royal College of Surgeons.|$|E
5000|$|Locke {{is known}} for his {{statement}} that individuals have a right to [...] "Life, Liberty and Property", and his belief that the natural right to property is derived from labor. Tutored by Locke, Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 3rd Earl of Shaftesbury wrote in 1706: [...] "There is a mighty Light which spreads its self over the world especially in those two free Nations of England and Holland; on whom the Affairs of Europe now turn". Locke's theory of natural rights has influenced many political documents, including the United States Declaration of Independence and the <b>French</b> <b>National</b> Constituent <b>Assembly's</b> Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen.|$|R
50|$|A convent of Dominican monks {{was founded}} in Carpentras in 1312. Louis de Vervins, Archbishop of Narbonne (1600-1628), had been a monk in this convent, and had become its Prior; he was a generous benefactor. There was also a convent of Observant Franciscans, one of Capuchins, one of Discalced Carmelites. Of the {{religious}} orders for women, there were five convents in Carpentras: the abbey of the Cistercians of Saint Mary Magdeleine and of Saint Bernard, the monastery of the Discalced Carmelites, the Convent of the Visitation, the house of refuge called Notre-Dame de Sainte Garde, and the convent called L'Intérieur de Marie. These were all liquidated by order of the <b>French</b> <b>National</b> Constituent <b>Assembly</b> in 1790.|$|R
5000|$|During {{the early}} years of the French Revolution, the leaders of the <b>French</b> <b>National</b> Constituent <b>Assembly</b> decided to {{introduce}} a completely new system of measurement based on the principles of logic and natural phenomena. Specifically, the metre was defined as one ten-millionth of the distance from the North Pole to the Equator, and the kilogram as the mass of one thousandth of a cubic metre of pure water. Although these definitions were chosen so that nobody would [...] "own" [...] the units, they could not be measured with sufficient convenience or precision for practical use. Instead copies were created in the form of the [...] and [...] which were a [...] "best attempt" [...] at fulfilling these principles.|$|R
5|$|Boganda {{was born}} into a family of {{subsistence}} farmers, and was adopted and educated by Roman Catholic Church missionaries. In 1938, he was ordained as the first Roman Catholic priest from Oubangui-Chari. During World War II, Boganda served in a number of missions and after was persuaded by the Bishop of Bangui to enter politics. In 1946, he became the first Oubanguian elected to the <b>French</b> <b>National</b> <b>Assembly,</b> where he maintained a political platform against racism and the colonial regime. He then returned to Oubangui-Chari to form a grassroots movement in opposition of French colonialism. The movement led to the 1949 foundation of the Movement for the Social Evolution of Black Africa (MESAN), which became popular among villagers and the working class. Boganda's reputation was slightly damaged when he was laicized from the priesthood after marrying Michelle Jourdain, a parliamentary secretary. Nonetheless, he continued to advocate for equal treatment and civil rights for blacks in the territory well into the 1950s.|$|E
5|$|The {{integration}} of the princely states {{raised the question of}} the future of the remaining colonial enclaves in India. At independence, the regions of Pondicherry, Karikal, Yanam, Mahe and Chandernagore were still colonies of France, and Daman and Diu, Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Goa remained colonies of Portugal. An agreement between France and India in 1948 provided for an election in France's remaining Indian possessions to choose their political future. A plebiscite held in Chandernagore on 19 June 1949 resulted in a vote of 7,463 to 114 in favour of being integrated with India. It was ceded to India on a de facto basis on 14 August 1949 and de jure on 2 May 1950. In the other enclaves, however, the pro-French camp, led by Edouard Goubert, used the administrative machinery to suppress the pro-merger groups. Popular discontent rose, and in 1954 demonstrations in Yanam and Mahe resulted in pro-merger groups assuming power. A referendum in Pondicherry and Karaikal in October 1954 resulted in a vote in favour of merger, and on 1 November 1954, de facto control over all four enclaves was transferred to the Republic of India. A treaty of cession was signed in May 1956, and following ratification by the <b>French</b> <b>National</b> <b>Assembly</b> in May 1962, de jure control of the enclaves was also transferred.|$|E
25|$|The {{bill was}} {{examined}} by the <b>French</b> <b>National</b> <b>Assembly</b> between 31 January and 9 February.|$|E
50|$|Paul Boulet {{was mayor}} of Montpellier {{a second time}} from 1945 to 1953 and served on the city council until 1957. He was re-elected by the voters of Hérault in 1945 to the lower house of the <b>French</b> parliament, the <b>National</b> <b>Assembly</b> of France which {{replaced}} the earlier Chamber of Deputies in the Fourth French Republic, sitting with the Popular Republican Movement. He was unsuccessful in retaining his seat in 1951 and again failed to win election in 1956.|$|R
