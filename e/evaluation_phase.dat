It was a further six years until, during 1988, a formal request for proposal (RFP) was issued to various manufacturers, in time which the requirement had evolved into a battlefield reconnaissance helicopter. During October 1988, it was revealed that two separate teams, these being Boeing–Sikorsky and Bell–McDonnell Douglas, received contracts to proceed with further development work upon their submitted concepts. During the 1990s, it was announced that the program's name had been changed from LHX to simply Light Helicopter (LH). During April 1991, the U.S. Army decided to select the design proposal produced by the Boeing–Sikorsky team as the contest winner; shortly thereafter, the team received a contract for the construction of four prototypes, which were intended to be operated in an extended demonstration and <b>evaluation</b> <b>phase.</b> It was in that same month that the helicopter received its official designation, that being RAH-66 Comanche, issued by the U.S. Army.|$|E

The programme was estimated to cost £50–60million. In June 2008, the National Audit Office issued a scathing report on the MoD's handling of the affair, stating that the whole programme was likely to cost £500million by the time the helicopters enter service.

2500|$|On 13 June 2013, the U.S. Army {{formally}} cancelled the Individual Carbine competition.

[...] Letters were sent to gunmakers involved to inform them that no future contract awards would be made for the soldier <b>evaluation</b> <b>phase.</b> [...] PEO Soldier reported that no competitor demonstrated a significant improvement in weapon reliability to justify buying a new carbine. [...] Weapons tested also had low reliability performance using M855A1 Enhanced Performance Rounds (EPR). [...] Ultimately, the Army decided not to pursue a new carbine because of consideration of operational requirements in the context of available small arms technology, the constrained fiscal environment, and the capability of their current carbines. One reliability requirement that was not reached by the vendors was firing 3,592 mean rounds without malfunctioning. [...] In 1990, the M4 was required to fire 600 mean rounds between stoppages, while the current M4A1 fires 1,691 mean rounds between stoppages using M855A1 ammunition. [...] PEO Soldier said that the new carbine had to be a superior improvement, not a small improvement. [...] The Army has not released how close the competitors came to reaching the mean rounds between stoppages requirement, or how they performed compared to the M4A1. [...] That information is seen as proprietary, and may be up to the manufacturers to release data. [...] Analysis has not yet been done to determine if any exact event cause per vendor led to performance failures.|$|E

40|$|Instructional {{design and}} test {{development}} models converged {{in the development}} of a valid placement test for college level students in English second language courses in Quebec. The realities of instructional design within the context of budget cuts and time constraints often result in the curtailment of the needs assessment and formative <b>evaluation</b> <b>phases</b> of design. The development of the placement test relied heavily on these two essential phases of instructional design despite constraints. The needs assessment and formative <b>evaluation</b> <b>phases</b> provided the necessary insights for the production of a test that corresponds to the learning objectives of the curriculum and the expectations of the test users. Adhering to these models provided the framework for the test design and ensured that the test items produced for the large scale field testing were functioning well in terms of their level of difficulty and their ability to discriminate. This thesis deals with the needs assessment that led to the development of items for a placement test and the formative evaluation of both the individual items and the test itself. n = 299 and n = 118, respectively...|$|R
40|$|For man / {{years the}} Department of Defense has sought {{ways and means}} of reducinf the time frame {{and the cost of}} {{developing}} new weapons systems. Substantial savings can be made during the test and <b>evaluation</b> <b>phases</b> by improvements in instrumentation facilities and methods. The Miss Distance (MIDI) Radar is one example. During the development of air defense weapons, both guns and guided missiles, the measurement of vector miss distance is necessary.
