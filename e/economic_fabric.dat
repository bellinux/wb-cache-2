25|$|With {{the decline}} of tourism during the 20th century, the Pau economy (and its suburbs) {{gradually}} shifted towards the aviation industry and then to that of petrochemicals with the major discovery of the Lacq gas field in 1951. Pau today {{is a city of}} about 80,000 inhabitants, the main urban area of Pau and of the Communauté d'agglomération Pau Béarn Pyrénées with 30 neighbouring communes which carry out local tasks together. The Université de Pau et des Pays de l'Adour, founded in 1972, accounts for a large student population. The city plays a leading role for Béarn but also for a wide segment of the Adour area. An administrative capital, it boasts a dense <b>economic</b> <b>fabric</b> including service activities. Pau also plays the role of cultural capital with many events, including sports. Pau's heritage extends over several centuries, its diversity and its quality allowed it to obtain the label of City of Art and History in 2011.|$|E
25|$|The Military Governor of Málaga province, General Theodor von Reding, held {{command of}} the First Division of the Spanish Army of Andalusia and was {{architect}} of the Spanish victory in the Battle of Bailen during the (Peninsular War). The French encountered strong resistance in Málaga and left {{much of the city}} in ruins when they withdrew. The war and revolts against Napoleon's occupation led to the adoption of the Spanish Constitution of 1812, later a cornerstone of European liberalism, by the Cádiz Cortes. Málaga elected representatives to send to the national legislative assembly and a new constitutional Town Council which immediately implemented reconstruction plans. The French were decisively defeated at the Battle of Vitoria in 1813, and the following year, Ferdinand VII was restored as King of Spain. The burden of war had destroyed the social and <b>economic</b> <b>fabric</b> of Spain and ushered in an era of social turbulence, political instability and economic stagnation.|$|E

2500|$|Although the Eisenhower {{administration}} generally {{adhered to}} the New Look throughout Wilson's term, the policy remained controversial. Some critics maintained that it made impossible the fighting of a limited non-nuclear war. The Army and Navy felt that the increased emphasis on air power and nuclear weapons represented {{a departure from the}} concept of [...] "balanced forces", where individual service programs were balanced against overall requirements. Implicit in the policy was rejection of the idea that a year of crisis with the Soviet Union was imminent (to occur when the Soviets achieved offensive nuclear capability against the United States) or that a general war was just around the corner. Wilson pointed out frequently that defense policy should be long-term and not based on short-range projections of Soviet-American relations. [...] "Military expenditures", he observed, [...] "must be adequate, but not so great that they will become an intolerable burden which will harm the social and <b>economic</b> <b>fabric</b> of our country.

40|$|Abstract: The {{purpose of}} this study is to apply the Human Security Index (HSI) as a tool to detect social and {{economic}} cumulative risk burden at a county-level in the state of Texas. The HSI is an index comprising a network of three sub-components or “fabrics”; the Economic, Environmental, and Social Fabrics. We hypothesized that the HSI will be a useful instrument for identifying and analyzing socioeconomic conditions that contribute to cumulative risk burden in vulnerable counties. We expected to identify statistical associations between cumulative risk burden and (a) ethnic concentration and (b) geographic proximity to the Texas-Mexico border. Findings from this study indicate that the Texas-Mexico border region did not have consistently higher total or individual fabric scores as would be suggested by the high disease burden and low income in this region. While the <b>Economic,</b> Environmental, Social <b>Fabrics</b> (including the Health subfabric) were highly associated with Hispanic ethnic concentration, the overall HSI and the Crime subfabric were not. In addition, the Education, Health and Crime subfabrics were associated with African American racial composition, while Environment, <b>Economic</b> and Social <b>Fabrics</b> were not. Application of the HSI to Texas counties provides a fuller an...|$|R
