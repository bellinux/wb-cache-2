5|$|The second film, The Only Girl in Camp, {{focuses on}} Trapper Gates's daughter, {{who is the}} only woman in the mining camp. Three ruffians come across the camp and plan to rob the miners. The leader, Bill, announces himself as Professor Watson and says he will give a lecture on {{locating}} gold deposits in the town hall. All the miners are lured to the building, save the girl, and Bill's accomplices proceed to rob the men. She realizes that this meeting is unusual and goes to the town hall and witnesses the robbery, but has no way of reporting or stopping the three armed men. Struck with an <b>idea,</b> <b>she</b> returns home for her father's bear traps and sets them on the steps of town hall. The robbers back out of the town hall and step into the traps, where they are captured.|$|E
5|$|De l'Orme's {{original}} {{plans have}} not survived. Jacques Androuet du Cerceau, however, has left us {{a set of}} plans for the Tuileries. One engraving shows a grandiose palace, with three courts and two oval halls. This design is atypical of de l'Orme's style and so {{is likely to have}} been du Cerceau's own proposal or his son Baptiste's. It recalls the houses with tall pavilions and multiple courtyards that du Cerceau often drew in the 1560s and 1570s. Architectural historian David Thomson suggests that the oval halls within du Cerceau's courtyards were Catherine de' Medici's <b>idea.</b> <b>She</b> may have planned to use them for her famously lavish balls and entertainments. Du Cerceau's drawings reveal that, before he published them in 1576, Catherine decided to join the Louvre to the Tuileries by a gallery running west along the north bank of the Seine. Only the ground floor of the first section, the Petite Galerie, was completed in her lifetime. It was left to Henry IV, who ruled from 1589 to 1610, to add the second floor and the Grande Galerie that finally linked the two palaces.|$|E
5|$|When Susan's husband, Karl, is {{suspected}} of causing {{the death of a}} patient, he decides to move their family to Erinsborough for a fresh start. As Susan settles into Ramsay Street, she hopes to get back into teaching. Susan gets involved in the drama society and works at the Coffee Shop for Annalise Hartman (Kimberley Davies). Karl wants to have another child, but Susan is opposed to the <b>idea.</b> <b>She</b> later decides that she wants to return to teaching and is given a job at Erinsborough High. Susan chaperones Brett Stark (Brett Blewitt) on a trip to South Africa and she confesses to him that she helped her mother to die. Susan invites Billy's best friend, Toadfish Rebecchi (Ryan Moloney) to move in and he becomes a surrogate son after Malcolm leaves. Susan is offered the position of principal at a school in Wangaratta and she accepts, knowing that she will have to leave her family. After a few months, Susan is offered the job of principal at Erinsborough High. While Susan is away, Karl kisses his receptionist, Sarah Beaumont (Nicola Charles).

500|$|Imperator Nikolai I ( [...] or Emperor Nikolai I) was a Russian {{dreadnought}} built during World War I {{for service}} in the Black Sea. She was designed to counter multiple prospective Ottoman dreadnoughts which had been placed under order by the Ottoman government, since this raised {{the possibility that the}} Russian dreadnoughts being built for the Black Sea Fleet could be outclassed. The ship used the same main armament as the preceding , but was larger and more heavily armored. Imperator Nikolai I was launched in 1916, but construction was suspended on 24 October 1917. The Soviets considered completing her in 1923, but later rejected the <b>idea.</b> <b>She</b> was towed to Sevastopol in 1927 and scrapped.|$|E

500|$|Lynda Day (Julia Sawalha) is {{the editor}} of the Junior Gazette. She is strong and opinionated, and is feared by many of her team.

Stephen [...] "The Koz" [...] Kozmeniuk did the additional editing of the song and arranged the vocoder. Benny Benassi recalled that Madonna would arrive in the studio around 3–4 pm and would work till 11:30 pm in the night. Together they fixed {{the production of the}} song, including the layering and stacking of the track. They added more vocals to the composition and during the chorus, decided on how many voices should be duplicated.

500|$|Brian Cronin {{noted that}} [...] " [...] readers felt the {{violence}} towards Barbara Gordon was too much, and even Moore, in retrospect, has expressed his displeasure {{with how the}} story turned out." [...] Jeffrey A. Brown, author of Dangerous Curves: Action Heroines, Gender, Fetishism, and Popular Culture (2011) noted The Killing Joke {{as an example of}} the [...] "inherent misogyny of the male-dominated comic book industry" [...] in light of the [...] "relatively unequal violence [...] are subjected to." [...] While male characters may be critically injured or killed, they are more than likely to be returned to their original conception, while female characters are more likely to receive permanent damage. Reid states that although speculation behind the editorial decision to allow the paralysis of the character to become permanent included the <b>idea</b> <b>she</b> had become outdated, [...] "if audiences had grown tired of Batgirl, it was not because she was a bad character but because she had been written badly." ...|$|E

500|$|The Navy tested an [...] "underwater locator" [...] in August 1949 by searching an area {{south of}} the Cape Hatteras Lighthouse for the wreck of Monitor. It found a [...] long object bulky {{enough to be a}} shipwreck, in [...] feet of water that was thought to be Monitor, but {{powerful}} currents negated attempts by divers to investigate. Retired Rear Admiral Edward Ellsberg proposed using external pontoons to raise the wreck in 1951, the same method of marine salvage he had used on the sunken submarine , for the cost of $250,000. Four years later, Robert F. Marx claimed to have discovered the wreck based on the <b>idea</b> <b>she</b> had drifted into shallow water north of the lighthouse before sinking. Marx said he had dived on the wreck and placed a Coke bottle with his name on it in one of the gun barrels, although he never provided any proof of his story.|$|E
500|$|... "If I Were a Boy" [...] {{was written}} by BC Jean and Toby Gad. It is the opening ballad of the I Am ... disc of the double album I Am... Sasha Fierce. It is the only song on either disc that Beyoncé did not co-write. Most of the lyrics were written by Jean, who was {{inspired}} by the break-up of a romantic relationship. One day Jean and Gad visited a pizzeria in Times Square in New York City. Although tempted, Jean refrained from eating pizza because she was dieting. She then thought that if she were a boy, she would have eaten without regret. After reflecting on the <b>idea,</b> <b>she</b> concluded that she would have been a better man than her past lover. Gad captured Jean's ideas on a pocket recorder, and they went to the studio the same day. Once there, she wrote the lyrics and melody in about 15 minutes. She then recorded the song in less than half an hour, with Gad on the guitar.|$|E
500|$|Directed by British artist Chris Cunningham, {{the music}} video for [...] "Frozen" [...] was filmed at Cuddeback Lake within the Mojave Desert in California during January 7–11, 1998.
