40|$|The paper explores {{rationales}} of {{the rise}} and expansion of small scale non-industrial private forestry. The historical aspects of the small scale of forests are also briefly reviewed. In particular, the paper seeks to explain {{the reason for the}} increasing number of nonindustrial private <b>forest</b> <b>ownerships</b> with smaller holding size or private forestland parcelization. The main arguments are that small-scale family forestry expands with economic needs that in turn reflect structural changes in demand for and supply of forest products and services. We suggest that the cause of the increasing number of small-scale family forests should be focus on changes in the demand for forest products and services, while the causes of shrinking <b>forest</b> landholding <b>ownerships</b> should be examined with reference to the supply of forestland. Under this interpretation, small-scale family forest owners behave more like forestland consumers than timber producers. Thus efficiency in small scale family forestry is reflected will be found in the efficiency of forestland consumption for non-timber purpose for transaction costs savings, not in efficiency of timer production. Policy analysts should expand their focus beyond the analysis of production to consumption and distribution efficiency.

40|$|This study investigates how federal, state, {{and private}} {{corporate}} forest owners in a fire-prone landscape of southcentral Oregon manage their forests to reduce wildfire hazard and loss to high-severity wildfire. We evaluate {{the implications of}} our findings for concepts of social-ecological resilience. Using interview data, we found {{a high degree of}} "response diversity" (variation in forest management decisions and behaviors to reduce wildfire losses) between and within actor groups. This response diversity contributed to heterogeneous forest conditions across the landscape and was driven mainly by forest management legacies, economics, and attitudes toward wildfire (fortress protection vs. living with fire). We then used an agent-based landscape model to evaluate trends in forest structure and fire metrics by ownership. Modeling results indicated that, in general, U. S. Forest Service management had the most favorable outcomes for forest resilience to wildfire, and private corporate management the least. However, some state and private corporate <b>forest</b> <b>ownerships</b> have the building blocks for developing fire-resilient forests. Heterogeneity in social-ecological systems is often thought to favor social-ecological resilience. We found that despite high social and ecological heterogeneity in our study area, most <b>forest</b> <b>ownerships</b> do not exhibit characteristics that make them resilient to high-severity fire currently or in the future under current management. Thus, simple theories about resilience based on heterogeneity must be informed by knowledge of the environmental and social conditions that comprise that heterogeneity. Our coupled human and natural systems (CHANS) approach enabled us to understand connections among the social, economic, and ecological components of a multiownership, fire-prone ecosystem, and to identify how social-ecological resilience to wildfire might improve through interventions to address key constraints in the system. Our methods underscore the importance of looking beyond the present to future trajectories of change to fully understand the implications of current natural resource management practices for adaptation and social-ecological resilience to natural disturbances...|$|R

40|$|Our {{understanding}} of the world is essentially based on shared meanings that are intersubjectively produced and reproduced in different social practices. In this study we analyse private forest owners’ discourses of the forest as a social practice that produces alternative competing truths about the forest and <b>forest</b> <b>ownership.</b> We examine the order of five predefined discourses (1 e 5) in relation to discoursal power by analysing the signs of hegemony and marginalisation within these discourses. Importantly, we also analyse the position of different kinds of forest owners within the prevailing order of discourses. Our critical discourse analysis combines qualitative content analysis with quantitative multivariate analysis (NMS) and is based on in-depth interviews with 24 Finnish forest owners. The harmonious discourses of the forester (1) and the economist (2) demonstrated many hegemonic features. This essentially illustrates the hegemony of the economic truth about the forest and its proper use among forest owners, as economically effective wood production was emphasised in both of these discourses. The signs of marginalization were common in the discourses of the distant economist (3), the critical anti-economist (4), and the dutiful forest owner (5). Discourse 4 was characterised by an open critique of the hegemonic economic truth. Forest owners with primarily non-monetary objectives were placed in an unfavourable position in the order of the discourses. The results reflect a wider discursive environment where economic meanings and practices prevail as the most natural and proper ways of thinking and acting. Being a forest owner is easy in Finnish society if the hegemonic economic truth about the forest functions as a natural and unproblematic part of one's <b>forest</b> <b>ownership.</b> However, discourses 4 and 5 indicate that the prevailing discursive conditions make <b>forest</b> <b>ownership</b> unfulfilling for some owners.

To contrast NIPF with large-scale <b>forest</b> <b>ownership,</b> large-scale operating costs and investments were examined. Felling statistics were used, combined with silvicultural costs obtained from an external survey. Results showed that a large share of NIPF owners’ forestry sales revenues were re-invested in their forest properties; 71 percent of sales as operating costs and 24 percent in the form of investments. Resident owners were more active and ploughed more money back into the properties in the form of investments. They also seemed less inclined to make use of disposable income from the property. Activities were also lower among shareholders. The same low harvesting activity was found on the forest commons land. This indicates that the common, from this perspective, not has worked as a force promoting local development. NIPF- and large-scale forest owners earn comparable felling revenues. However, NIPF owners ploughed more back into their properties. The inevitable conclusion is that with the present tax system and activities among ownership categories, non-shareholder resident NIPF owners are preferable for the boreal municipality. They seem to keep up an activity and still generate local tax revenues, even though small. Finally, only meagre tax revenues were created for the boreal municipality budget from <b>forest</b> <b>ownership,</b> roughly SEK 600, 000 in the year 2000.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} {{results of}} analyses of data from the 2015 Global Forest Resources Assessment on changes in <b>forest</b> <b>ownership,</b> public income and expenditure on forestry and forestry employment. <b>Forest</b> <b>ownership</b> continued to show less state control and ownership of forests. This was due to private-sector investment and, in some countries, the transfer of public forests to the private-sector (including local communities). This contrasts somewhat with results on public income and expenditure, which indicate that public expenditure on forestry has increased dramatically over the last decade, while income has increased by very little. Global employment in forestry has not changed much {{over the last two}} decades and has remained at about 12. 7 million people, with the majority of these employed in informal activities, particularly in Asia. While production of many if not most forest goods and services has increased, labour productivity has improved at the same time, leading to this result. Comparing the results for groups of countries at different income levels, it appears that higher income countries tend to have a relatively high proportion of private <b>forest</b> <b>ownership,</b> high levels of labour productivity and high levels of public spending (per hectare) on forestry.
