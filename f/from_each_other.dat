We believe that this is because no framework exists for conducting user evaluations of ubicomp applications. In this paper, we propose a framework in hopes of making it easier for researchers to learn <b>from</b> <b>each</b> <b>other’s</b> results, to create effective discount evaluation techniques and design guidelines for ubicomp, to provide a mechanism for researchers to share what they have learned about the appropriateness of different evaluation techniques, and to provide structure so that key areas of evaluation are not overlooked. ...|$|R

40|$|Failure in {{research}} is an increasingly hot topic, with high-profile crises {{of confidence in}} the published research literature in medicine and psychology. Among the major factors in this research crisis are the many incentives to report and publish only positive findings. These incentives prevent the field in general from learning from negative findings, and almost entirely preclude the publication of mistakes and errors. Thus providing an alternative forum for practitioners and researchers to learn <b>from</b> <b>each</b> <b>other's</b> failures can be very productive. The first LAK Failathon, held in 2016, provided just such an opportunity for researchers and practitioners to share their failures and negative findings in a lower-stakes environment, to help participants learn <b>from</b> <b>each</b> <b>other's</b> mistakes. It was very successful, and there was strong support for running it as an annual event. This workshop will build on that success, with twin objectives to provide an environment for individuals to learn <b>from</b> <b>each</b> <b>other's</b> failures, and also to co-develop plans for how we as a field can better build and deploy our evidence base...|$|R
