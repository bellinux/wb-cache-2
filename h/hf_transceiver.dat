2500|$|One {{category}} in which Heathkit enjoyed great popularity was amateur radio. Ham radio operators had frequently {{been forced to}} build their equipment from scratch {{before the advent of}} kits, with the difficulty of procuring all the parts separately and relying on often-experimental designs. Kits brought the convenience of all parts being supplied together and the assurance of a predictable finished product; many Heathkit models became well known in the ham radio community. The HW-101 <b>HF</b> <b>transceiver</b> became so ubiquitous that even today the [...] "Hot Water One-Oh-One" [...] can be found in use, or purchased as used equipment at hamfests, decades after it went out of production.|$|E

50|$|Codanâ€™s <b>HF</b> <b>transceivers</b> were {{initially}} developed to provide communications for people living, working and travelling in central Australia. Codan {{has been a}} supplier of HF Radio products to aid and humanitarian markets since 1980. Other markets include the public, private and security sectors, {{as well as a}} significant recreational vehicle user market in Australia. Codan military <b>HF</b> Radio <b>transceivers</b> comply with MIL-STD-188-141B ALE (JITC Certified) and FED-STD-1045 ALE, are interoperable with other military grade radios, and provide frequency hopping and voice encryption. Codan is a supplier to the US Army and has provided around 3000 transceivers to support security and rebuilding programs in Afghanistan and Iraq.|$|R
50|$|Transverters {{can also}} be used in {{applications}} where the transverter frequency is lower than the transceiver frequency. Several low frequency bands are available around the world to amateur radio operators, licensed experimental stations, and some unlicensed hobbyists. Transverters for these LF bands generally use <b>HF</b> <b>transceivers</b> as the IF radio. Some are used for communications where {{one or more of the}} stations are underground.|$|R
50|$|High Frequency Internet Protocol (HFIP or HF-IP) {{is usually}} {{associated}} with Automatic Link Establishment and HF radio data communications. HFIP provides protocol layers enabling internet file transfer, chat, web and email. HFIP commonly uses ionospheric propagation of radio waves to form a wide area network that can span thousands of kilometers. <b>HF</b> <b>transceivers</b> in HFIP service typically run 20 to 150 Watts for portable or mobile units, up to approximately 2000 Watts transmitter output for high power base stations with HFIP servers.|$|R

50|$|Over {{the past}} decade or so, the {{availability}} of transceivers that include the 6-meter band has increased greatly. Many commercial <b>HF</b> <b>transceivers</b> now include the 6-meter band, as do some handheld VHF/UHF transceivers. There are also a number of stand-alone 6-meter band transceivers, although commercial production of these has been relatively rare in recent years. Despite support in more available radios, however, the 6-meter band does not share the popularity of amateur radio's 2-meter band. This is due, in large part, to the larger size of 6-meter antennas, power limitations in some countries outside the United States, and the 6-meter band's greater susceptibility to local electrical interference.|$|R
50|$|A {{standalone}} ALE radio combines an <b>HF</b> SSB radio <b>transceiver</b> with {{an internal}} microprocessor and MFSK modem. It is programmed {{with a unique}} ALE address, similar to a phone number (or on newer generations, a username). When not actively in contact with another station, the <b>HF</b> SSB <b>transceiver</b> constantly scans through a list of HF frequencies called channels, listening for any ALE signals transmitted by other radio stations. It decodes calls and soundings sent by other stations and uses the bit error rate to store a quality score for that frequency and sender-address.|$|R

50|$|The CCECPSCO has two {{repeaters}} on Mackinaw {{to provide}} communications coverage throughout the Straits of Mackinac. These repeaters, {{operating under the}} call-sign W8AGB to match the ship's WAGB-83 designation, are on a radio frequency of 145.110 MHz with 103.5 Hz PL tone and 444.375 MHz with 107.2 Hz PL tone. The organization is also actively assisting the museum with restoration and operation of various communications, navigation, and power systems. Included with the radios on board the ship are two Sunair RT-9000 <b>HF</b> <b>transceivers</b> with matching antenna couplers and vertical antennas. Scheduled for spring 2010 is the installation of a third RT-9000 paired with an LPA-9600 solid-state kilowatt amplifier and CU-9100 kilowatt autotuner along with a Sunair F-9800 automatic pre/post filter for each radio to permit simultaneous operation of all three stations, and Sunair RCU-9310 remote control panels.|$|R
50|$|Many freeband {{operators}} use amateur radios {{modified to}} transmit out of band, which is illegal in some countries. Older amateur radios may require component changes; for instance, the 1970s Yaesu FT-101 was modified for CB by replacing a set of crystals used to tune portions of the 10-meter band, although some variants of the FT-101 were sold with the US FCC channels standard and were capable of transmitting {{above and below the}} legal 40 channels by another 10 or more channels. On some newer radios, the modification may be as simple as disconnecting a jumper wire or a diode. Many types of amateur transceivers may be found on CB and freeband, ranging from full-coverage <b>HF</b> <b>transceivers</b> to simpler 10-meter mobile radios. In the United States, the FCC bans the importation and marketing of radios it deems easily modifiable for CB; it is illegal to transmit on CB frequencies with a ham radio except in emergencies where no other method of communication is available.|$|R
