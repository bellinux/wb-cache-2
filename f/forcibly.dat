5|$|Beginning in 1847 {{and lasting}} until 1996, the Canadian government, in {{partnership}} with the Catholic Church, ran 130 residential boarding schools across Canada for Aboriginal children, who were <b>forcibly</b> taken from their homes. While the schools were said to educate, they were plagued by under-funding, disease, and abuse.|$|E
5|$|In June 1940, the Soviet Union <b>forcibly</b> annexed Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, and {{the disputed}} Romanian regions of Bessarabia, Northern Bukovina and Hertza. Meanwhile, Nazi-Soviet {{political}} rapprochement and economic co-operation gradually stalled, and both states began preparations for war.|$|E
5|$|On Wednesday 19 June {{the court}} opened at 9am; the {{indictment}} on {{three of the}} defendants was read for <b>forcibly</b> entering the house of Robert Speechly in Littleport and stealing personal property. Mr Gurney addressed the jury, who later pronounced all defendants guilty.|$|E
5|$|The {{facility}} {{would have}} incorporated a liquid oxygen factory and a bomb-proof train station to allow missiles and supplies {{to be delivered}} from production facilities in Germany. It was constructed using the labour of thousands of prisoners of war and <b>forcibly</b> conscripted workers used as slave labourers.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} {{documented}} {{cases in which}} male sea otters have <b>forcibly</b> copulated with juvenile harbor seals, sometimes resulting in death. Similarly, forced copulation by Sea Otters involving animals other than Pacific Harbor Seals has occasionally been reported.|$|E
5|$|While {{cockroaches}} do {{not have}} lungs as do vertebrates, and can continue to respire if their heads are removed, in some very large species, the body musculature may contract rhythmically to <b>forcibly</b> move air {{in and out of}} the spiracles; this may be considered a form of breathing.|$|E
5|$|A former member, Lewis had {{a privileged}} {{upbringing}} {{and sought to}} help the less fortunate and fight oppression and corruption as a crime-fighter. To this end Lewis created a costume with special wings that helped him glide. His mental stability ultimately deteriorated after he was called before HUAC, leading to him being <b>forcibly</b> brought to a mental asylum.|$|E
5|$|According to {{historian}} Thomas Paul, Tipu {{shifted his}} hatred for the British to the Mangalorean Catholics and other South Indian Christian communities. Sita Ram Goel mentions that Tipu's {{justification for the}} conversion was that during the Portuguese domination, many Muslims were <b>forcibly</b> converted to Christianity. Tipu proclaimed his actions as a punishment for the conversion of Muslims to Christianity.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the war, Sparta lost its {{position}} as a major power in Greece. Subsequent Spartan attempts to recover the losses failed and Nabis, the last sovereign ruler, was eventually murdered. Soon after, Sparta was <b>forcibly</b> made a member of its former rival, the Achaean League, ending several centuries of fierce political independence.|$|E
5|$|At one point, Nathan {{asks for}} Jodie's {{help with the}} condenser, which has broken open. After braving hostile {{entities}} from the Infraworld, Jodie manages {{to shut down the}} condenser and warns Nathan not to build another. This gets the attention of the CIA, who send agent Ryan Clayton (Eric Winter) to <b>forcibly</b> recruit Jodie. After training, the now-adult Jodie goes on multiple missions as a field agent, often with Ryan, to whom she slowly becomes attracted. On one such mission in Somalia, Jodie learns that the target she killed was not a warlord, but the country's benign president. An enraged Jodie flees in disgust, despite Ryan's pleas. Branded a traitor, Jodie becomes a fugitive, evading pursuing CIA forces. Along the way, she befriends a group of homeless people, one of whom she helps give birth, and a family of Native Americans whom she saves from a malevolent entity. The CIA eventually recaptures Jodie after she attempts to reconnect with her catatonic biological mother, who has been held and <b>forcibly</b> drugged for decades in a military hospital.|$|E
5|$|During the occupation, {{approximately}} 4,000 {{children were}} <b>forcibly</b> {{removed from their}} families by Indonesian soldiers {{as well as by}} state and religious organizations. Although some were well-treated, others were subjected to various forms of abuse, including sexual abuse. Some were converted to Islam. A number of soldiers who kidnapped these children still hold senior positions within the Indonesian military.|$|E
5|$|Early Dutch missionaries faced strong {{opposition}} among Torajans, {{especially among the}} elite, because the abolition of their profitable slave trade had angered them. Some Torajans were <b>forcibly</b> relocated to the lowlands by the Dutch, {{where they could be}} more easily controlled. Taxes were kept high, undermining the wealth of the elites. Ultimately, the Dutch influence did not subdue Torajan culture, and only a few Torajans were converted. In 1950, only 10% of the population had converted to Christianity.|$|E
5|$|Gambira faced a {{total of}} sixteen charges {{for his role in}} the protests, {{including}} membership in an unlawful association and illegal movement across borders. In October 2008, Gambira's lawyer, Aung Thein, resigned from his case, saying that the military government would not allow him the materials to prepare an adequate defence. On one occasion, Gambira refused to appear in court himself, stating that the trial of a <b>forcibly</b> disrobed monk was disrespectful to Buddhism.|$|E
5|$|However, {{events in}} the world {{appeared}} to play into the reformers' hands. Poland's neighbors were too occupied with wars to intervene <b>forcibly</b> in Poland, with Russia and Austria engaged in hostilities with the Ottoman Empire (the Russo-Turkish War (1787–92) and the Austro-Turkish War (1787–91)); the Russians also found themselves fighting Sweden (the Russo-Swedish War (1788–90)).|$|E
5|$|In 1912, the United States {{established}} military {{ties with}} Liberia by sending some five black American officers to help reorganize the force. The LFF {{in its early}} years was frequently recruited by inducing men from the interior <b>forcibly.</b> When dispatched to the interior to quell tribal unrest, units often lived off the areas that they were pacifying, as a form of communal punishment. The Force's officers were drawn from either the coastal aristocracy or tribal elites.|$|E
5|$|In December 1976, Bukovsky was <b>forcibly</b> {{deported}} {{from the}} USSR and exchanged at Zürich airport by the Soviet {{government for the}} imprisoned {{general secretary of the}} Communist Party of Chile, Luis Corvalán. In his 1978 autobiography Bukovsky describes how he was brought to Switzerland in handcuffs. The widely publicised exchange increased public awareness in the West about Soviet dissidents.|$|E
5|$|In October, Texians engaged Mexican {{troops in}} the first {{official}} battle of the Texas Revolution. Determined to quell the rebellion, Santa Anna began assembling a large force, the Army of Operations in Texas, to restore order. Most of his soldiers were raw recruits, {{and a large number}} had been <b>forcibly</b> conscripted.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 17th century, Franciscan missionaries argued that further {{attempts}} at peaceful pacification of the Ch'ol were useless and argued for armed intervention against the Manche Ch'ol and their Lakandon Ch'ol neighbours. The Manche were <b>forcibly</b> relocated in the Guatemalan Highlands, {{where they did}} not prosper. By 1770, most of the Manche Ch'ol were extinct. The few survivors were soon absorbed into the surrounding Q'eqch'i Maya population.|$|E
5|$|Natasha Falle (born 1973) is a Canadian {{professor}} at Humber College in Toronto, Ontario, Canada who was <b>forcibly</b> prostituted from {{the ages of}} 15 to 27 and now opposes prostitution in Canada. Falle {{grew up in a}} middle-class home and, when her parents divorced, her new single-parent home became unsafe, and Falle ran away from home. At the age of 15, Falle became involved in the sex industry in Calgary, Alberta.|$|E
5|$|Octavian <b>forcibly</b> {{entered the}} temple of the Vestal Virgins and seized Antony's secret will, which he {{promptly}} publicized. The will would have given away Roman-conquered territories as kingdoms for his sons to rule, and designated Alexandria as the site for a tomb for him and his queen. In late 32BC, the Senate officially revoked Antony's powers as consul and declared war on Cleopatra's regime in Egypt.|$|E
5|$|On April 19, clashes {{erupted in}} Quảng Ngãi Province between the Buddhists and the VNQDD, {{prompting}} the local ARVN commander Tôn Thất Đính to <b>forcibly</b> restrain the two groups. Three {{days later the}} VNQDD accused the Buddhists of attacking their premises in Hội An and Da Nang, while US officials reported that the VNQDD were making plans to assassinate leading Buddhists, such as the activist monk Thích Trí Quang.|$|E
5|$|On October 5, Secretary of State Robert Lansing was {{the first}} {{official}} to propose that Marshall <b>forcibly</b> assume presidential powers and duties. Other cabinet secretaries backed Lansing's request, as did Congressional leaders, including members of both the Democratic and Republican parties who sent private communications to Marshall. Marshall was cautious in accepting their offers of support. After consulting {{with his wife and}} his long-time personal adviser, Mark Thistlethwaite, he privately refused to assume Wilson's duties and become Acting President of the United States. The process for declaring a president incapacitated was unclear at that time, and he feared the precedent that might be set if he <b>forcibly</b> removed Wilson from his powers and duties. Marshall wanted the president to voluntarily allow his powers to devolve to the vice president, but that was impossible given his condition and unlikely given Wilson's dislike for Marshall. Marshall informed the cabinet that the only cases in which he would assume Wilson's powers and duties were a joint resolution of Congress calling on him to do so, or an official communication from Wilson or his staff asserting his inability to perform his duties.|$|E
5|$|On the September 1, {{episode of}} Impact Wrestling, Maria berated and <b>forcibly</b> pinned her {{apprentice}} Allie {{to win the}} TNA Women's Knockout Championship {{for the first time}} in her career. On October 2 at the Bound for Glory pay-per-view, Kim defeated Maria for the title, ending her reign at 50 days. On March 1, 2017, it was announced that Kanellis, along with her husband, had departed TNA.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of Halloween, October 31, pro-union men called a mass meeting at Labor Hall and those in {{attendance}} resolved to support the strike. Aided by the carnival atmosphere of downtown Indianapolis' Halloween festival, the men dispersed around the city to attack streetcars {{and in some cases}} <b>forcibly</b> take streetcar drivers to Labor Hall to make oaths in support of the union. Some who resisted were severely beaten.|$|E
5|$|Operation Grandslam or Operation Grand Slam was an {{offensive}} undertaken by United Nations peacekeeping forces from 28December 1962 to 15January 1963 against the gendarmerie (military) of the State of Katanga, a secessionist state rebelling against the Republic of the Congo in central Africa. The Katangese forces were decisively defeated and Katanga was <b>forcibly</b> reintegrated into the Congo.|$|E
5|$|Other factors {{contributed to}} the rising tensions. On his way to Egypt, Napoleon had stopped on Malta and <b>forcibly</b> removed the Hospitallers from their possessions, angering Paul, Tsar of Russia, who was the honorary head of the Order. The French Directory, furthermore, was {{convinced}} that the Austrians were conniving to start another war. Indeed, the weaker the French Republic seemed, the more seriously the Austrians, the Neapolitans, the Russians and the English actually discussed this possibility.|$|E
5|$|Partly in {{response}} to economic pressures {{and in order to}} protect the vital functions of the state, Diocletian restricted social and professional mobility. Peasants became tied to the land in a way that presaged later systems of land tenure and workers such as bakers, armourers, public entertainers and workers in the mint had their occupations made hereditary. Soldiers' children were also <b>forcibly</b> enrolled, something that followed spontaneous tendencies among the rank-and-file, but also expressed increasing difficulties in recruitment.|$|E
5|$|Rome's revenue equaled {{the amount}} of the {{successful}} bids to farm the taxes. The tax farmers' profits consisted of additional amounts they could <b>forcibly</b> wring from the populace with Rome's blessing or turning a blind eye. Lack of effective supervision, combined with tax farmers' desire to maximize their profits, produced a system of arbitrary exactions regarded quite rightly as barbarously cruel to taxpayers, unfair, and very harmful to investment and the economy.|$|E
5|$|Some falcons {{have the}} speed and agility to catch {{swallows}} and martins in flight, and pale crag martins may be hunted by species such as the peregrine falcon, Taita falcon, African hobby and wintering Eurasian hobby. Pale crag martins often share their nesting sites with little swifts, which sometimes <b>forcibly</b> take over martins' nests.|$|E
5|$|The North Koreans, in the meantime, were {{suffering}} serious logistics problems which {{prevented them from}} supplying their troops effectively with ammunition, food, and medical care. At the same time, elements of the division, including thousands of people <b>forcibly</b> conscripted from South Korea, were becoming increasingly hard to keep in place. The division was having difficulty strengthening its position at Haman.|$|E
5|$|The Third Doctor {{was portrayed}} by Jon Pertwee. Sentenced to exile on Earth and <b>forcibly</b> {{regenerated}} {{at the end}} of The War Games, the Doctor spent his time working for UNIT. After The Three Doctors, the Time Lords repealed his exile; however, the Doctor still worked closely with UNIT from time to time. The Third Doctor regenerated into his fourth incarnation as a result of radiation poisoning in the last moments of Planet of the Spiders.|$|E
5|$|The Young Turks and Khánh {{wanted to}} <b>forcibly</b> retire {{officers}} {{with more than}} 25 years of service, ostensibly because they thought them to be lethargic, out of touch, and ineffective. However, the unspoken and most important reason was because they viewed the older generals as rivals for power. Specific targets of this proposed policy were Minh and other senior officers in his short-lived junta, Trần Văn Đôn, Lê Văn Kim and Mai Hữu Xuân.|$|E
5|$|The {{prosecutor}} alleges than in Nakuru forty five {{cases of}} sexual violence were reported including rapes, forced male circumcisions and penile amputation. Rapes were also reported in Naivasha, as were forced circumcisions of Luo men. One witness claims that Naivasha's men {{were forced to}} remove their underwear to confirm their ethnicity and <b>forcibly</b> circumcised if their uncircumcised penis identified them as Luo.|$|E
5|$|The trade route {{on which}} Thistle lies {{was used by}} Native American tribes {{before the arrival of}} European settlers; two Ute chiefs, Taby and Peteetneet, led {{seasonal}} migrations through the canyon each spring and fall. The first recorded journey by Europeans to modern Thistle was the Dominguez–Escalante Expedition, which was escorted through the territory by Indian guides. A small group of Utes inhabiting the canyon frequently clashed with newcomers, and as a result were <b>forcibly</b> relocated in the 1870s.|$|E
5|$|There were at most 20,000 comfort women. None of {{them were}} <b>forcibly</b> recruited. Forty percent {{of them were}} from Japan, the most heavily {{represented}} nation. Many were sold to brokers by their parents. Some responded willingly to brokers' offers; others were deceived. I would add that, on the average, living conditions in the comfort stations were practically identical to those in brothels set up for American troops during the Vietnam War.|$|E
