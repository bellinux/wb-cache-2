50|$|There is a {{one-to-one}} {{correspondence between}} staff positions and diatonic-scale degrees (the notes of a diatonic scale).This means that interval numbers can be also determined by counting diatonic scale degrees, rather than staff positions, {{provided that the}} two notes that form the interval are drawn from a diatonic scale. Namely, C-G is a fifth because in any diatonic scale that contains C and G, the sequence from C to <b>G</b> <b>includes</b> five notes. For instance, in the A-major diatonic scale, the five notes are C-D-E-F-G (see figure). This is not true {{for all kinds of}} scales. For instance, in a chromatic scale, the notes from C to G are eight (C-C-D-D-E-F-F-G). This is the reason interval numbers are also called diatonic numbers, and this convention is called diatonic numbering.|$|E
50|$|The key usually {{identifies}} the tonic note and/or chord: the note and/or major or minor triad {{that represents the}} final point of rest for a piece, or {{the focal point of}} a section. Although the key of a piece may be named in the title (e.g., Symphony in C major), or inferred from the key signature, the establishment of key is brought about via functional harmony, a sequence of chords leading to one or more cadences, and/or melodic motion (such as movement from the leading-tone to the tonic). For example, the key of <b>G</b> <b>includes</b> the following pitches: G, A, B, C, D, E, and F; and its corresponding tonic chord is G—B—D. Most often {{at the beginning and end}} of traditional pieces during the common practice period, the tonic, sometimes with its corresponding tonic chord, begins and ends a piece in a designated key. A key may be major or minor. Music can be described as being in the Dorian mode, or Phrygian, etc., and is thus usually thought of as in a specific mode rather than a key. Languages other than English may use other key naming systems.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the design of}} G, a new language specifically created for generic programming. We review and identify important language features of C ++ and Haskell {{in light of the}} past decade of generic library research and development. Based on this analysis we propose and evaluate relevant language design decisions for G. Generic programming is concerned with the construction of libraries of reusable software components and is inherently about programming “in the large. ” Thus, the design of G places its greatest emphasis on modularity and safety, while also providing runtime efficiency and programmer convenience. This paper focuses on name scoping and type checking for generic functions, support for dispatching to algorithm specializations, support for type associations among abstractions, and separate compilation. The resulting design for <b>G</b> <b>includes</b> three novel aspects: scoped models declarations, nested types in concepts, and optional type constraints on generic functions...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION The Bayesian Maximum Entropy (BME) {{method of}} Modern Geostatistics {{is a method}} which offers a {{rigorous}} framework to account for a large class of general and specificatory knowledge bases [1 - 6]. The general knowledge <b>G</b> <b>includes</b> physical laws, scientific theories, empirical relationships, and statistical moments. The specificatory knowledge S includes hard data (exact measurement) and soft data (such as intervals, probability assessments, uncertain observations and fuzzy sets) that are specific to the mapping situation. Previous {{studies have shown that}} the BME method is very useful and numerically efficient in a number of practical situations in which various forms of soft data are available [5, 6]. In the first part of this work ([4]) we discussed two methods used by BME analysis in order to account for physical knowledge in the form of physical laws. In this work, the BME formalism is used to incorporate the Darcy law of groundwate...|$|E
40|$|This work {{is devoted}} to {{studying}} the combined effect that arises due to surface texture and surface roughness in hydrodynamic lubrication. An effective approach in tackling this problem is by using the theory of reiterated homogenization with three scales. In the numerical analysis of such problems, a very fine mesh is needed, suggesting some type of averaging. To this end, a general class of problems is studied that, e. <b>g.</b> <b>includes</b> the incompressible Reynolds problem in both artesian and cylindrical coordinate forms. To demonstrate {{the effectiveness of the}} method several numerical results are presented that clearly show the convergence of the deterministic solutions towards the homogenized solution. Moreover, the convergence of the friction force and the load carrying capacity of the lubricant film is also addressed in this paper. In conclusion, reiterated homogenization is a feasible mathematical tool that facilitates the analysis of this type of problem. Validerad; 2008; 20080901 (almqvist...|$|E

40|$|Our {{concern is}} {{building}} the set G of maximally general terms covering positive examples and rejecting negative examples in propositional logic. Negative examples are represented as {{constraints on the}} search space. This representation allows for defining a partial order on the negative examples and on attributes too.

Constraints can be directly used for a polynomial characterization of G.
