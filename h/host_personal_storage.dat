40|$|The {{reliability}} of data stored in a storage system is of immense importance for the users of the storage system and every storage system is expected to provide reliability. Along with reliability, storage systems are also expected to provide a degree of high availability. However, availability depends on {{the context in which}} the storage systems are used. Traditionally RAID (Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks) has provided both reliability and availability very effectively. The massive increase in the usage of <b>personal</b> <b>storage</b> devices (like laptops, PDA etc [...] ) has created concern with respect to the reliability and availability of these systems. These issues cannot be addressed by RAID because it is not feasible for this kind of portable <b>personal</b> <b>storage</b> devices. In this paper, we present a system which uses flash as part of the storage hierarchy to provide high reliability for low end <b>personal</b> <b>storage</b> systems. ...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: In {{order to}} explain and predict the {{adoption}} of <b>personal</b> cloud <b>storage,</b> this study explores the critical factors involved in the adoption of <b>personal</b> cloud <b>storage</b> and empirically validates their relationships to a user's intentions. Design/methodology/approach: Based on technology acceptance model (TAM), network externality, trust, and an interview survey, this study proposes a <b>personal</b> cloud <b>storage</b> adoption model. We conducted an empirical analysis by structural equation modeling based on survey data obtained with a questionnaire. Findings: Among the adoption factors we identified, network externality has the salient influence on a user's adoption intention, followed by perceived usefulness, individual innovation, perceived trust, perceived ease of use, and subjective norms. Cloud storage characteristics {{are the most important}} indirect factors, followed by awareness to <b>personal</b> cloud <b>storage</b> and perceived risk. However, although perceived risk is regarded as an important factor by other cloud computing researchers, we found that it has no significant influence. Also, subjective norms have no significant influence on perceived usefulness. This indicates that users are rational when they choose whether to adopt <b>personal</b> cloud <b>storage.</b> Research limitations: This study ignores time and cost factors that might affect a user's intention to adopt <b>personal</b> cloud <b>storage.</b> Practical implications: Our findings might be helpful in designing and developing <b>personal</b> cloud <b>storage</b> products, and helpful to regulators crafting policies. Originality/value: This study {{is one of the first}} research efforts that discuss Chinese users' <b>personal</b> cloud <b>storage</b> adoption, which should help to further the understanding of personal cloud adoption behavior among Chinese users...|$|R
