The shocks from these attacks may risk {{the safety of the}} occupants and damage the electronic instruments within the vehicle. Extensive research on the analysis and reduction of shocks on civilian vehicles has been performed. Fewer researchers addressed these problems in the case of military vehicles. <b>Space</b> <b>frames</b> are usually used to enhance structural strength of the vehicle while reducing its overall weight. These frames comprise of beams connected together at joints. Recently, <b>space</b> <b>frames</b> were incorporated in military vehicles.

50|$|In {{architecture}} and structural engineering, a <b>space</b> <b>frame</b> or <b>space</b> structure is a truss-like, lightweight rigid structure constructed from interlocking struts in a geometric pattern. <b>Space</b> <b>frames</b> {{can be used}} to span large areas with few interior supports. Like the truss, a <b>space</b> <b>frame</b> is strong because of the inherent rigidity of the triangle; flexing loads (bending moments) are transmitted as tension and compression loads along the length of each strut.Steel <b>space</b> <b>frames</b> provide great freedom of expression and composition as well as the possibility to evenly distribute loads along each rod and external constraints.With these features, steel <b>space</b> <b>frames</b> {{can be used to}} achieve also complex geometries with a structural weight lower than any other solution. The inner highly hyper-static system provides an increased resistance to damages caused by fire, explosions, shocks and earthquakes.Space frames are modular and made of highly industrialized elements designed with a remarkable dimensional accuracy and precise surface finish.|$|R

Randolphs design {{appears to have been}} inspired by British 36-gun frigates of the period. This resulted in a ship with a similar beam and depth of hold to the 36-gun British ships, but longer than the 36-gun frigates of the time, and thus oversized for her rate - much in the way the French Navy built oversized ships at that time. Randolph was planned to be somewhat more lightly built than the British frigates that inspired her design, with a broader <b>frame</b> <b>spacing</b> and a much more raked bow, but with less freeboard.|$|E

50|$|The {{camera back}} is {{removable}} for changing film. A milled button {{next to the}} tripod socket rotates either way to lock the back, while in a position in between it is unlocked. The back comes off downwards as a single unit including the base-plate. A quite small film-pressure plate of thick glass is mounted {{on a piece of}} rubber foam on the back. Inside the camera, on the left-hand side, is the 35mm film cassette chamber, and to the right is the counter clockwise rotating film take-up drum. It has a narrow slit for the film leader, and it rotates freely whenever the small film rewind button on the top plate is depressed. No sprocket wheel is employed; instead, the film is pulled by, and wound onto the drum that always rotates the same angular amount for next picture frame.

40|$|Contemporary {{architectural}} discourse commonly {{invokes the}} term framing.  Derivative phrases contrived {{in education and}} practise are seemingly inexhaustible: framing the view, <b>framing</b> <b>space,</b> <b>framing</b> an idea, frame of reference, framework, window <b>frame,</b> body <b>frame,</b> <b>space</b> <b>frame.</b>  The polymorphic nature of the term is perplexing, and despite its frequent and casual mention, the rich potential of framing in the architectural design process is often overlooked.     Framing is a primal phenomenon. It shapes an essential spatial experience {{with the power to}} divide, connect, fuse, reveal and conceal entities literally or notionally.  In the simple but profound act of recognizing, entering and exiting the boundary between, for example, an interior and an exterior, framing emerges in all its architectural and emotional significance. The experience of the frame is both intimate and metaphysical, hinting at shared but intangible dimensions of architecture. Through essays, drawings, installations, lists, poems, collages, and other architectural media, this thesis presents a body of twelve investigations that seek to elicit the broader notion behind the complex and transformative nature of framing in today’s parlance of architecture. To clarify, organize and interconnect the experiences of framing, the thesis constructs a theoretical framework on which to base further reflection, study, design and construction...|$|R

5000|$|While {{the camera}} is almost {{completely}} battery dependent (small exception)—power is provided by a 6 volt PX28 (originally Mercury specified 1968 and Silver-Oxide 1971), but equal substitutes PX28S/4SR44—as with many systems of the era, the mirror and cloth curtains are mechanically driven, {{the timing of the}} shutter being electrically governed by transistors and a magnet. The combination of capacitors routed by the speed setting determine the length of time the magnet remains engaged. Also, the operation of the shutter is not normally possible without film being properly loaded. However, one can test the shutter by rotating the counter dial away from the empty position while the film door is open and then by closing the film door while still holding the dial, thus facilitating the unlocking of the advance mechanism and operation of the shutter. The frame counter is incremented only while there is film passing through the [...] "main roller" [...] or [...] "counter roller" [...] next to the take-up spool in the camera. The camera disengages the [...] "transport system" [...] when the counter dial (connected to the frame counting control cam) has reached the last frame, or when the counter has returned to the [...] "empty" [...] or start position. The automatic frame counter resets only if the shutter is released before opening the back. Because a battery must power the timing, the loss of adequate voltage means the camera halts after the mirror is allowed to rise, and therefore the curtain release will not disengage. To drive the mirror to finish the cycle, a small button located flush on the right-hand camera front, just below the shutter-release button, is provided for restarting of the mirror/shutter cycle. Depressing the shutter release once more will release the cycles. The shutter release button is standard threaded for bulb or cable releases or the use of a large accessory button. The fingernail-operated latch to the left lower side releases the film door for loading. The film spools are secured by the pins and slot shaped opening at either end to the spool. The camera has two twist-lock cams that turn and pull out to open, the left side for the unexposed roll and the right side, known as the “take-up”. Because of the arrangement differences of the 120 and 220 start length of paper, the indicated starting points are marked above the film plane for lining-up of the start marks for the film. The film advance system is a tension/friction type, the film source side being a tension brake and the take-up side torque/slip clutch. A counting cam governs the frame count and interacts with the friction system to allow enough slip and movement to accurately space each frame {{from the beginning of the}} roll to the end. The counting cam also allows the system to regulate a lock to open and close, allowing the shutter to fire. This slip system has brought criticism of durability in early models, as it would slip more over time, causing <b>frame</b> <b>spacing</b> issues as well as disengaging the shutter. The frame counter system, tied to the counter roller, operates the automatic reset of the counter (returns it to start) whenever the back is opened and also sets the regulating of the next frame.|$|E

Often, considerable effort has {{been made by the}} designers to produce true <b>space</b> <b>frames,</b> with all points of significant load braced in 3 dimensions, resulting in strength and stiffness comparable to, or better than, typical production cars. Others are tube frames but not true <b>space</b> <b>frames</b> because they use relatively large diameter tubes, often curved, which are carrying bending loads, but due to the large diameter remain adequately rigid. However some inferior designs are not true <b>space</b> <b>frames,</b> because the tubes are carrying considerable bending loads.

The proposed genetic algorithm (GA) optimizer considers both topology (i. e., <b>frame</b> <b>spacing</b> and pitch) and cross-sectional sizes of the main structural members as the decision variables.
