5|$|Digital: A Love Story is {{a visual}} novel, or {{interactive}} fiction game, where the game's {{story is told}} primarily through text. The game is presented as <b>if</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> computer from the late 1980s running the Amie operating system (the name and visual appearance a reference to 1.x versions of AmigaOS). The player logs into bulletin board systems, or BBSs, where they read and reply to messages from other people. Messages received from other characters in the game are displayed through a different program on the computer screen. Accessing a BBS requires {{the knowledge of the}} telephone number for that board, which the player must type in manually. Boards that require a long-distance telephone number to reach require the player to use illegally obtained long-distance calling card numbers found online. Accessing boards also requires the player to either set up a user account for that board or to know the password necessary to enter the system.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{conceived}} by George Kamitani as first a sequel {{and then a}} spiritual successor to the 1997 Sega Saturn title Princess Crown. Development began in 2004 after the official formation of Vanillaware. The story was based around {{the concept of a}} Valkyrie princess. The scenario and world design incorporated Norse mythology, the works of William Shakespeare, fairy tales and early video games. 2D graphics were chosen over 3D graphics as Kamitani felt the style was stagnating, which necessitated presenting cutscenes as <b>if</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> stage rather than using traditional cinematography. Leifthrasir began development in 2013 as a means of addressing the issues both players and staff had with the original game while keeping the story intact. The music for both versions was composed by a team from Basiscape, led by company founder Hitoshi Sakimoto.|$|E
5|$|Entering the presidency, Garfield {{had little}} foreign policy experience, so he leaned heavily on Blaine. Blaine, a former protectionist, now agreed with Garfield {{on the need}} to promote freer trade, {{especially}} within the Western Hemisphere. Their reasons were twofold: firstly, Garfield and Blaine believed that increasing trade with Latin America would {{be the best way to}} keep Great Britain from dominating the region. Secondly, by encouraging exports, they believed they could increase American prosperity. Garfield authorized Blaine to call for a Pan-American conference in 1882 to mediate disputes among the Latin American nations and to serve as a forum for talks on increasing trade. At the same time, they hoped to negotiate a peace in the War of the Pacific then being fought by Bolivia, Chile, and Peru. Blaine favored a resolution that would not result in Peru yielding any territory, but Chile, which by 1881 had occupied the Peruvian capital, Lima, rejected any settlement that restored the previous status quo. Garfield sought to expand American influence in other areas, calling for renegotiation of the Clayton-Bulwer Treaty to allow the United States to construct a canal through Panama without British involvement, as well as attempting to reduce British influence in the strategically located Kingdom of Hawaii. Garfield's and Blaine's plans for the United States' involvement in the world stretched even beyond the Western Hemisphere, as he sought commercial treaties with Korea and Madagascar. Garfield also considered enhancing the United States' military strength abroad, asking Navy Secretary Hunt to investigate the condition of the navy with an eye toward expansion and modernization. In the end, these ambitious plans came to nothing after Garfield was assassinated. Nine countries had accepted invitations to the Pan-American conference, but the invitations were withdrawn in April 1882 after Blaine resigned from the cabinet and Arthur, Garfield's successor, cancelled the conference. Naval reform continued under Arthur, <b>if</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> more modest scale than Garfield and Hunt had envisioned, ultimately ending in the construction of the Squadron of Evolution.|$|E

25|$|Under an MMT {{framework}} where {{government spending}} injects new reserves into the commercial banking system, and taxes withdraw {{it from the}} banking system, government activity would have an instant effect on interbank lending. <b>If</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> particular day, the government spends more than it taxes, reserves {{have been added to}} the banking system (see vertical transactions). This will typically lead to a system-wide surplus of reserves, with competition between banks seeking to lend their excess reserves forcing the short-term interest rate down to the support rate (or alternately, to zero if a support rate is not in place). At this point banks will simply keep their reserve surplus with their central bank and earn the support rate.|$|E
25|$|In that spirit, Nearing {{moved through}} a series of secessions—from Christianity, from politics, and finally from American society itself. He voyaged to the {{wilderness}} as <b>if</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> pilgrimage to a sacred place. His experience, along with a deeper understanding of American culture, led to the inescapable consciousness that capitalist cultural dominance was too strong to eliminate and therefore too powerful to control or mold to liberal purposes. The secessions in his life were progressive repudiations of American canons of moral conduct as well as indications of Nearing's perception of the fragmented, segmented, discontinuous nature of American society. Only in the isolated private sphere provided by homesteading could a radical resistance and constructive challenge to capitalist culture be nurtured.|$|E

25|$|Originally {{there were}} only open living areas {{at the back of}} the {{farmhouse}} on both sides of the fireplace. Here there were tables, chairs and wall beds and, of course, open contact with the animals. Not until after the Thirty Years War when the demand for living comfort grew, were separate rooms built {{at the back of the}} farmhouse, each the length of a bay (ca. 2.5 m) i.e. the space between the interior posts. This living space was called a Kammerfach from Kammer (room or chamber) and Fach (bay). One subsequent change was the addition of a cellar under the Kammerfach, but it was not very deep. The separate living quarters were raised above the level of the main hall as <b>if</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> plinth and in the larger four-post farmhouses (Vierständerhäuser) sometimes formed a sort of gallery.|$|E
25|$|Externally First Church {{successfully}} replicates the effect, <b>if</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> smaller scale, of {{the late}} Norman cathedrals of England. The cathedral-like design and size can best be appreciated from the rear. There is an apse flanked by turrets, which are dwarfed by the massive gable containing the great rose window. It is this large circular window which after the spire becomes {{the focal point of}} the rear elevations. The whole architectural essay appears here almost European. Inside, instead of the stone vaulted ceiling of a Norman cathedral, there are hammer beams supporting a ceiling of pitched wood and a stone pointed arch acts as a simple proscenium to the central pulpit. Above this diffused light enters through a rose window of stained glass. This is flanked by further lights on the lower level, while twin organ pipes emphasise the symmetry of the pulpit.|$|E
25|$|Tithes are broken-off {{during the}} Sabbatical year (such {{as when the}} ground lies fallow), during which year, all fruits, grains and {{vegetables}} that are grown of themselves in that year are considered free and ownerless property.

On the other hand, the extension of such lands held by the people of Israel who departed Egypt and who entered the Land of Canaan under their leader, Joshua, are forbidden to be ploughed by any Jew during the Seventh year, but if gentiles had ploughed such land and sown it, the produce is permitted to be eaten by a Jew. <b>If</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> regular week-year, fruits and grains and vegetables, if grown by an Israelite in these places, would require tithing.|$|E

Also, in such cases, porticos were built on all sides so that occupants could fully appreciate the countryside while being protected from the sun, similar to many American-style porches of today. Palladio sometimes used a loggia {{as an alternative to}} the portico. This can most simply be described as a recessed portico, or an internal single storey room, with pierced walls that are open to the elements. [...] Occasionally a loggia would be placed at second floor level over the top of a loggia below, creating what was known as a double loggia.
