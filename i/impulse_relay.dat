5000|$|A non-rechargeable battery always powers the thermostat. To {{limit the}} amount of power drawn from the battery, such {{thermostats}} use an <b>impulse</b> <b>relay</b> that does not require the continuous application of power to the relay's coil. These thermostats can be used on millivolt circuits, as well as conventional 24 VAC circuits. Battery life is typically one to two years.|$|E
50|$|For loads {{other than}} {{incandescent}} lamps, such as fluorescent lamps, high-intensity discharge lamps, and electrical home appliances, the triac-based electronic switching in the lamp module is unsuitable and an appliance module {{must be used}} instead. These modules switch the power using an <b>impulse</b> <b>relay.</b> In the U.S., these modules are generally rated to control loads up to 15 amperes (1800 watts at 120V).|$|E
50|$|Mercury relays {{have also}} been {{produced}} as latching or <b>impulse</b> <b>relays.</b> The Lenning design uses a horizontal glass tube with two axially isolated pools of mercury. A conductive stirrup can bridge these to make the connection. The relay {{is controlled by the}} stirrup being rotated {{in and out of the}} pool along the horizontal axis of the tube. A weight on the stirrup's armature gives an over-centre action that provides the latching behaviour. A magnetic slug on the armature allows it to be rotated and controlled by an external electromagnet.|$|R

5000|$|The {{vagus nerve}} {{also has a}} {{sympathetic}} function via the peripheral chemoreceptors. [...] Peripheral chemoreceptors are activated primarily due to hypoxemia. When stimulated, these chemoreceptors <b>relay</b> <b>impulses</b> throughout the vagus nerves in order to enable a vasoconstrictor response and increase blood pressure. Vagus nerve is the longest nerve in human body ...|$|R
40|$|While the {{technique}} of cross-circulation has been used extensively in physiology, it has usually been employed with large animals. The present paper describes a method of cross-circulation that has been successfully adapted to the rat. The use of this species offers certain advantages: (a) animals are uniform in structure {{as a result of}} continued inbreeding, (b) blood types are similar and consequently difficulties due to incompatibility are not a problem, (c) marked resistance to infection is present, (d) certain organs can be removed comparatively easily, and (e) since the laboratory rat has been used extensively in biological investigations, a great deal of standardized information is readily available for use as control data. PREPARATION OF ANIMALS Rats weighing approximately 200 grams have been used. They are anesthetized with Nembutal (5 mg. per 100 gm. body weight given intraperitoneally) and are prepared as follows: A transverse skin incision is made just below the inguinal ligament; the skin is dissected free of fascia and retracted, so that an adequate exposure of the femoral artery, vein, and nerve is made. The blood vessels and nerve are dissected free of adhering connective tissue and the femoral nerve is cut in order to diminish the number of <b>impulses</b> <b>relayed</b> during the cannulation and cross-circulation procedures. A 2 per cent solution of Papaverine 8 is then applied locally to the blood vessels to relieve the vasospasm that occur...|$|R
40|$|A {{method of}} <b>impulse</b> ultra-wideband signals <b>relaying</b> in ad hoc radio {{networks}} is described. As the relaying signals {{a group of}} chipsets is used to represent various minimal information units. A system of markers is introduced to unambiguous determine the relaying routes. The chipset representation of transmitted signals reduces the delays coursed by multistep relaying and increases the data transfer rate...|$|R
25|$|The four spectrally {{distinct}} cone pigments {{are derived}} from the protein opsin, linked to a small molecule called retinal, which {{is closely related to}} vitamin A. When the pigment absorbs light the retinal changes shape and alters the membrane potential of the cone cell affecting neurons in the ganglia layer of the retina. Each neuron in the ganglion layer may process information from a number of photoreceptor cells, and may in turn trigger a nerve <b>impulse</b> to <b>relay</b> information along the optic nerve for further processing in specialised visual centres in the brain. The more intense a light, the more photons are absorbed by the visual pigments; the greater the excitation of each cone, and the brighter the light appears.|$|R
50|$|After the 2nd world war, {{a deputy}} of Mayenne, Robert Buron, became several times minister, was to advise General and Mayor of Villaines-la-Juhel. It was under his <b>impulse</b> and his <b>relayed</b> by the {{successive}} municipalities {{that the city}} took a new rise. The presence of large companies testify to this dynamism even though today the commune undergoes some delocalization. The city obtained important industrial companies, thus employing {{a great number of}} employees.|$|R
40|$|The {{biologic}} {{basis of}} migraine had remained unclear until about 15 years, but current migraine research {{has made some}} major advances to explain its mechanism. Migraine is currently conceived to originate in the brain. The trigger of an attack starts a depolarising event very similar to "spreading depression" of Leao in a brain that is already hyperexcitable. Hyperexcitability of cell membrane is perhaps genetically determined. Cortical depolarising events drive the trigeminovascular system through mechanisms that are largely hypothetical but might include a migraine generating centre in the brainstem to produce changes in the vessels of the cranium and meninges. Pain sensations carrying <b>impulses</b> are <b>relayed</b> back, first reaching the trigeminal ganglion caudalis and the trigeminal cervical complex in upper cervical cord from where they are relayed further up through various transmitting pathways to the brainstem, thalamus and the cortex where pain is finally perceived and registered...|$|R

The more intense a light, the more photons are absorbed by the visual pigments; the greater the excitation of each cone, and the brighter the light appears.By far the most abundant cone pigment in every bird species examined is the long-wavelength form of iodopsin, which absorbs at wavelengths near 570 nm. This is roughly the spectral region occupied by the red- and green-sensitive pigments in the primate retina, and this visual pigment dominates the colour sensitivity of birds. In penguins, this pigment appears to have shifted its absorption peak to 543 nm, presumably an adaptation to a blue aquatic environment.|$|R
40|$|A gross {{morphological}} {{study of}} the brain of the African giant pouched rat (Cricetomys gambianus Waterhouse, 1840) was undertaken in order to document its normal features and assess the structure-function paradigm. The study was conducted by direct observation of 29 adult African giant pouched rats’ brains. In the telencephalon, the cerebral cortex was devoid of prominent gyri and sulci, but the large olfactory bulb and tract <b>relaying</b> <b>impulses</b> to the olfactory cortex were very prominent. The large size of the olfactory bulb correlated with the established sharp olfactory acuity of the rodent. In the mesencephalic tectum, the caudal colliculi were bigger than the rostral colliculi, indicating a more acute sense of hearing than sight. In the metencephalon, the cerebellar vermis, the flocculus and the paraflocculus were highly coiled and, thus, well developed. The myelencephalon revealed a better organised ventral surface than dorsal surface; the cuneate fascicle, the intermediate sulcus and the lateral sulcus were not evident on the dorsal surface, but there were clearly visible pyramids and olivary prominence on the ventral surface. In conclusion, the highly coiled cerebellar vermis, flocculus and paraflocculus, {{as well as the}} conspicuous pyramids and olivary prominence are indicative of a good motor coordination and balance in the African giant pouched rat...|$|R
40|$|The {{masseter}} inhibitory reflex (MIR) {{was investigated}} in 16 patients with localized brainstem lesions involving the trigeminal system. The MIR consists of two phases of EMG silence (S 1 and S 2) evoked by stimulation of the mental nerve during maximal clenching of the teeth. The extent of the lesions was assessed by neurological examination, nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and recording of trigeminal reflexes with known paths (jaw jerk and blink reflex). The MIR appeared to be abnormal in lesions involving the pontine tegmentum, from the pontomedullary junction to midpons, and some lesions selectively affected one component of the MIR, proving that S 1 and S 2 are relayed by independent circuits. The results indicate that afferent fibres for S 1, which reach the pons via the trigeminal sensory root, enter the ipsilateral trigeminal spinal tract and terminate {{at the level of}} the midpons; <b>impulses</b> are then <b>relayed</b> by interneurons to the ipsilateral and contralateral trigeminal motor nuclei. The afferent fibres for S 2 follow a similar path, but descend to the pontomedullary junction; at this level impulses are conducted along bilateral interneuronal paths, which probably ascend through the lateral reticular formation, before connecting with the trigeminal motor nucleus on either side. Analysis of MIR recordings can be of particular value because brainstem inhibitory reflexes cannot be tested by clinical examinatio...|$|R
