40|$|Reanalysis of the Apollo 15 A, B, and C {{green glass}} beads from slide 15426, 72, {{led to the}} {{discovery}} of patchy, highly vesicular <b>glass</b> <b>rims</b> adhering to beads. These rims are high in S and Ni and low in MgO, but otherwise compositionally similar to the green glasses. We find that these rims represent a unique melt composition that places constraints on lunar magmatic processes. Combining the compositional data for the vesicular <b>glass</b> <b>rims</b> with new minor element data for the green glass beads leads us to hypothesize that the vesicular rim fluid originated near the green glass source, at about 2. 2 GPa. These findings support the theory of a heterogeneous lunar mantle, and suggest that sulfur did not drive the eruption from depth, but that degassing volatiles into the vacuum did drive the final fire fountain eruption...|$|R

The second step is to fill half the glass with ice and add one or two shooter glasses full of high quality Tequila. The next stage is to add the flavouring elements. This is done by squeezing a fresh lime into the glass, adding a few grains of salt, adding citrus-flavoured soda pop, until the glass is 4/5 full, and then adding spicy Viuda de Sanchez (or orange juice, lime juice and pico de gallo). The final step is to stir the ingredients so that the flavours are properly blended.|$|E

40|$|Within {{the altered}} {{parts of the}} <b>glass</b> <b>rim</b> of pillow lavas of Hole 896 A, at depths at least 432 m below {{seafloor}} (237 m below the top of volcanic basement), microbes have been identified. This is indicated by the size and shapes of alteration textures and verified {{by the presence of}} DNA and extreme accumulation of K₂O. This demonstrates the existence of a volcanic subterranean biosphere. The microbially processed parts of the glass show wide scatter with respect to all major elements, which may be attributed to active cells. Compared to the host basaltic glass, CaO and Na₂O are invariably depleted, as are SiO₂ and MgO generally. A 1 ₂O₃, FeO(t), and TiO₂ show either depletion or enrichment, K₂O is invariably enriched, and P₂O₅ may be enriched. Microbes living on, and causing dissolution of, basaltic glass may accommodate elements released from it within the cells, and thus function as individual element reservoirs. Microbes may also produce precipitates or water-soluble compounds. Hence, the microbial alteration of basaltic glass, which comprises a substantial volume of the volcanic component of the oceanic crust and an enormous surface area, may have a significant bearing on the mechanism for chemical exchange between oceanic crust and ocean water...|$|E

40|$|Halogens {{and noble}} gases within {{submarine}} basaltic glasses are critical tracers of {{interactions between the}} surface volatile reservoirs and the mantle. However, as the halogens and noble gases are concentrated within seawater, sediments, and the oceanic crust this makes the original volatile signature of submarine basaltic lavas susceptible to geochemical overprinting. This study combines halogen (Cl, Br, and I), noble gas, and K concentrations within a single submarine basaltic quenched margin to quantify the amount of seawater assimilation during eruption, and to further elucidate the mechanisms of overprinting. The outer sections of the <b>glass</b> <b>rim</b> are enriched in Cl compared to {{the interior of the}} margin, which maintains mantle-like Br/Cl, I/Cl, and K/Cl ratios. Low Br/Cl and K/Cl in the outer sections of the basaltic glass margin indicate that the Cl enrichment in the outer glass is derived from the assimilation of a saline brine component with up to 70 % of the Cl within the glass being derived from brine assimilation. Atmospheric noble gas contamination is decoupled from halogen contamination with contaminated outer sections maintaining MORB-like 40 Ar/ 36 Ar, suggesting seawater-derived brine assimilation during eruption is not the dominant source of atmospheric noble gases in submarine basalts. Volatile heterogeneities in submarine basalts introduced during and after eruption, as we have shown in this study, have the potential to expand the range of mantle halogen compositions and only by better understanding these heterogeneities can the Br/Cl and I/Cl variance in mantle derived samples are determined accurately...|$|E
40|$|Bioactive glass {{can form}} an {{effective}} bond with bone. Essential for this connection are the interfacial reactions {{which lead to}} the development of a Si-rich film covered by a CaP-rich film. The presence of these layers can be demonstrated clearly by EDX analysis of fiber-reinforced bioactive glass and bulk bioactive glass implants installed for 4 and 16 months in the partial edentulous jaws of beagle dogs. EDX analysis reveals three types of microchemical interface. The first type develops when the implant is bonded to bone. Here, a smooth transition of the CaP profile can be observed between bioactive glass and the bone, thus providing for a compositional gradient between the implant and the surrounding tissues. The second type is seen when the implant surface is surrounded by fibrous tissue. This causes a discontinuity in the CaP profile. The third type is characterized by a gradual decrease in the Ca and P concentrations across the interface, caused by the presence of Ca and P in the fibrous tissue near the implant surface. This suggests that the interface is dynamic in time and transforms to a functionally better optimized interface. EDX analysis does not reveal any metal fiber ion contamination of the outer <b>glass</b> <b>rim</b> of the implant. When stainless-steel or wrought Co-Cr alloy is exposed to the surrounding fluids, the interfacial osteogenesis is disturbed, possibly by a synergistic effect of glass ions and metal ions. Exposure of titanium does not interfere with this osteogenesis. The bone bonding can also be influenced by surgical trauma. However, with precise implantation techniques, an enhancement of bone growth by osteoconductivity can be measured. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Abstract–We have {{analyzed}} a {{suite of}} lunar regolith breccias {{in order to assess}} how well space weathering products can be preserved through the lithification process and therefore {{whether or not it is}} appropriate to search for space weathering products in asteroidal regolith breccia meteorites. It was found that space weathering products, vapor/sputter deposited nanophase-iron-bearing rims in particular, are easily identified in even heavily shocked/compacted lunar regolith breccias. Such rims, if created on asteroids, should thus be preserved in asteroidal regolith breccia meteorites. Two additional <b>rim</b> types, <b>glass</b> <b>rims</b> and vesicular rims, identified in regolith breccias, are also described. These rims are common in lunar regolith breccias but rare to absent in lunar soils, which suggests that they are created in the breccia-forming process itself. While not “space weathering products ” in the strictest sense, these additional rims give us insight into the regolith breccia formation process. The presence or absence of <b>glass</b> and/or vesicular <b>rims</b> in asteroidal regolith breccias will likewise tell us about environmental conditions on the surface of the asteroid body on which the breccia was created...|$|R

40|$|We {{examined}} the H 2 O and CO 2 contents of glasses from lavas and xenoliths from the Mariana arc system, an intraoceanic convergent margin {{in the western}} Pacific, which contains an active volcanic arc, an actively spreading back arc basin, and active behind-the-arc cross-chain volcanoes. Samples include (1) <b>glass</b> <b>rims</b> from Mariana arc, Mariana trough, and cross-chain submarine lavas; (2) glass inclusions in arc and trough phenocrysts; and (3) glass inclusions from a gabbro + anorthosite xenolith from Agrigan (Mariana arc). <b>Glass</b> <b>rims</b> of submarine arc lavas contain 0. 3 - 1. 9 wt % H 2 O, and CO 2 is below detection limits. Where they could be compared, glass inclusions in arc phenocrysts contain more H 2 O than their host glasses; most arc glasses and phenocryst inclusions contain no detectable CO 2, {{with the exception of}} those from a North Hiyoshi shoshonite, which contains 400 - 600 ppm. The glass inclusions from the Agrigan xenolith contain 4 - 6 % H 2 O, and CO 2 is below the detection limit. Glasses from the cross-chain lavas are similar to those from the arc: H 2 O contents are 1. 4 - 1. 7 wt %, and CO 2 is below detection limits. Volatile contents in Mariana trough lava <b>glass</b> <b>rims</b> are variable: 0. 2 - 2. 8 wt % H 2 O and 0 - 300 ppm CO 2. Glass inclusions from through phenocrysts have water contents similar to the host glass, but they can contain up to 875 ppm CO 2. Volatile contents of melt inclusions from trough and arc lavas and from the xenolith imply minimum depths of crystallization of ~ 1 - 8 km. H 2 O and CO 2 contents of Mariana trough glasses are negatively correlated, indicating saturation of the erupting magma with a CO 2 -H 2 O vapor at the pressure of eruption (~ 400 bars for these samples), with the vapor ranging from nearly pure CO 2 at the CO 2 -rich end of the glass array to nearly pure H 2 O at the H 2 O-rich end. Degassing of these magmas on ascent and eruption leads to significant loss of CO 2 (thereby masking preeruptive CO 2 contents) but minimal disturbance of preeruptive H 2 O contents. For submarine Mariana arc magmas, depths were low enough that degassing on ascent and eruption led to loss of both H 2 O and CO 2; as a result, H 2 O contents are positively correlated with water depth for these samples. The H 2 O contents of primitive Mariana trough magmas richest in the slab-derived component (i. e., the most "arc-like" magmas) are ~ 2 wt %. Although evolved glasses with up to 4 - 6 wt % H 2 O are present among Mariana arc samples, we interpret the glass inclusion data as indicating that primitive Mariana arc liquids contain 1 - 3 wt % H 2 O. The preeruptive H 2 O contents of primitive cross-chain seamount liquids are > 1 - 2 wt %...|$|R
