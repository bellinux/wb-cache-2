40|$|The Advanced Petroleum-Based Fuels-Diesel <b>Emissions</b> <b>Control</b> Program (APBF-DEC) {{began in}} February 2000 and is {{supported}} by government agencies and industry. The purpose of the APBF-DEC program is to identify and evaluate the optimal combinations of fuels, lubricants, diesel engines, and <b>emission</b> <b>control</b> systems to meet the projected emission standards for the 2000 to 2010 time period. APBF-DEC is {{an outgrowth of the}} earlier Diesel Emission Control-Sulfur Effects Program (DECSE), whose objective is to determine the impact of the sulfur levels in fuel on <b>emission</b> <b>control</b> systems that could lower the emissions of NOx and particulate matter (PM) from diesel powered vehicles in the 2002 to 2004 period. Results from the DECSE studies of two <b>emission</b> <b>control</b> technologies-diesel particle filter (DPF) and NOx adsorber-will be used in the APBF-DEC program. These data are expected to provide initial information on <b>emission</b> <b>control</b> technology options and the effects of fuel properties (including additives) on the performance of <b>emission</b> <b>control</b> systems...|$|R
40|$|The {{substantial}} {{reductions in}} motor vehicle emissions {{that have occurred}} since the late 1960 s have been accompanied by continuous increases in vehicle <b>emission</b> <b>control</b> costs, and cost increases or decreases due to changes in vehicle performance such as driveability, power, fuel economy, and vehicle maintenance. In this paper, a systematic approach has been developed to estimate <b>emission</b> <b>control</b> costs for motor vehicles. The approach accounts for all <b>emission</b> <b>control</b> parts installed on vehicles, {{and the costs of}} these emission parts are estimated through their prices. This paper does not estimate costs of the changes in vehicle performance and maintenance caused by <b>emission</b> <b>control.</b> Using information on <b>emission</b> <b>control</b> parts and their prices for new light-duty vehicles sold in California in 1990, per-vehicle control costs and total control costs for all new light-duty vehicles have been estimated. The cost to vehicle manufacturers per vehicle for <b>emission</b> <b>control</b> ranges from $ 220 to $ 1, 460, depending on vehicle size and manufacturer. The sales-weighted average cost to manufacturers is $ 445 per vehicle. The total cost of <b>emission</b> <b>control</b> technology for 1990 light-duty vehicles sold in California is estimated to be about $ 698 million. The corresponding cost to consumers per vehicle for <b>emission</b> <b>control</b> ranges from $ 370 to $ 2, 430, with a sales-weighted average of $ 748. The total cost for <b>emission</b> <b>control</b> of 1990 light-duty vehicles sold in California is about $ 1. 2 billion to consumers. Per-vehicle costs for vehicles sold elsewhere in the U. S. in 1990 are similar since emission standards were similar that year...|$|R
40|$|Estimation of <b>emission</b> <b>control</b> cost {{functions}} {{is often}} {{carried out in}} a partial equilibrium framework, i. e., {{under the assumption that}} <b>emission</b> <b>control</b> measures have negligible effects on input and output prices. In this paper a computable general equilibrium model is used for simulation of the impact on factor prices and resource allocation of reductions of SO infx sup-, NO infx su- and CO 2 -emissions. Thus the model includes markets for tradable emission permits, and the equilibrium prices of permits reflect the marginal costs of <b>emission</b> <b>control.</b> The results suggest that major emission reductions are likely to have general equilibrium effects, and thus that <b>emission</b> <b>control</b> cost functions that fail to take these effects into account may give a distorted picture of the economic impact of <b>emission</b> <b>control.</b> Copyright Kluwer Academic Publishers 1991 Carbon taxation, environmental control cost function, computable general equilibrium,...|$|R
25|$|Other gaseous {{emissions}} in the flue gas from incinerator furnaces include nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, hydrochloric acid, heavy metals, and fine particles. Of the heavy metals, mercury {{is a major concern}} due to its toxicity and high volatility, as essentially all mercury in the municipal waste stream may exit in emissions if not removed by <b>emission</b> <b>controls.</b>|$|E
25|$|The World Bank has {{sponsored}} {{a project to}} curb air pollution through public transport improvements and the Mexican government has started shutting down polluting factories. They have phased out diesel buses and mandated new <b>emission</b> <b>controls</b> on new cars; since 1993 all new cars must be fitted with a catalytic converter, which reduces the emissions released. Trucks must use only liquefied petroleum gas (LPG).|$|E
25|$|Because of the {{economic}} ramifications of such restrictions, there are those, including the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, who argue that the negative economic effects of <b>emission</b> <b>controls</b> outweigh the environmental benefits. They state that even if global warming is caused solely by the burning of fossil fuels, restricting their use would have more damaging effects on the world economy than the increases in global temperature.|$|E
30|$|Scenario B {{shows how}} the {{increase}} in participation of regions affects the emissions and economies. Here, {{it is assumed that}} MCM, SAM and IND join the <b>emission</b> <b>control</b> agreement. Thus, 12 regions of world 15 regions participate in <b>emission</b> <b>control.</b>|$|R

25|$|The 401 was {{available}} in the Javelin, Matador, and Ambassador car lines and in Jeeps from its introduction in 1971 through 1974. In 1975 and 1976, <b>emission</b> <b>controls,</b> insurance rates, and high gasoline prices meant the 401 {{was available}} on the large Matador model, and then only for police department orders. Buyers of full-sized Jeeps (Wagoneer, Cherokee, J-10 and J-20) could order a 401 until 1979. This engine was also supplied to International Harvester for use as an optional engine in International's Light Line pickup trucks and Travelalls from late 1973 through 1974.|$|E

40|$|Both {{stationary}} {{and mobile}} sources are major contributors to many air quality problems. Typically, regulators have more <b>control</b> over total <b>emissions</b> from stationary sources, but only <b>control</b> <b>emissions</b> per vehicle mile from mobile sources, taking total vehicle miles of travel (VMT) as given. A cost minimization model is developed to compare <b>emissions</b> <b>control</b> policies which reduce VMT, to other prevailing stationary and mobile source <b>emission</b> <b>control</b> strategies. Connecticut {{data for the}} ground-level ozone problem is used to show that controlling VMT, through an optimally determined gasoline tax, will marginally reduce total social costs of Connecticut's <b>emission</b> <b>control</b> program. ...|$|R
25|$|The engine line-up {{remained}} {{almost identical}} to the 1970 model year, with most models featuring the 250 CID I-6 as standard. Broughams, Squires and GTs continued to have the 302-2V as standard, while the Cobra was downgraded to a 351-4V as its standard engine. All engines, other than the 429s, saw a slight drop in compression, which also resulted in a drop in power ratings. High insurance rates for muscle cars, and increasing concerns for <b>emission</b> <b>controls</b> were likely the reason for Ford's changes to its engines. Other manufactures were following suit, including Torino's main competitor Chevrolet's Chevelle, which featured lower compression on all of its 1971 engines, while SS models had the 350 CID 2-barrel as its standard engine. Ram Air induction remained an option on the 351-4V, 429 CJ, and the 429 SCJ.|$|E

With that, the standard 350 two-barrel V8 was rated at 160 net horsepower compared to 230 gross horsepower in 1971 while the top 455 V8 was rated at 250 net horsepower in 1972 compared to 315 in 1971. Engines were also revised to meet the 1972 federal and California emission standards with California-bound cars receiving EGR valves, which would be installed on engines of virtually all automobiles for nationwide sales in 1973.|$|E
25|$|The Tier 4 engines produce {{substantially}} lower emissions {{than most}} other diesel vehicles in Toronto. The Environmental Impact Assessment for the UP Express of 2009 was carried out assuming that trains would be Tier 3 standard rather than Tier 4, and showed that at peak frequency the air quality effect of the additional trains would not raise any pollution level above the provincial criterion levels. The 2010 Metrolinx electrification study, which did assume the use of Tier 4 emissions technologies for diesel propulsion options, found that the Georgetown/UP Express diesel service would contribute {{on the order of}} 0.2% to local air pollution, and that electrification would result in only a small improvement to local air quality. In an additional review of human health assessment in 2011, GO Transit examined the current plan for Tier 4 <b>emission</b> <b>controls</b> on both the UP Express trains and conversion of existing GO locomotives to Tier 4 and found that the human health risks of the diesel UP Express service are negligible, but that current background air quality (from other pollution sources in Toronto) is an issue.|$|E
