2500|$|There are few {{reports of}} gorillas using {{tools in the}} wild. Western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) have been {{observed}} using sticks to apparently measure the depth of water and as [...] "walking sticks" [...] to support their posture when crossing deeper water. An adult female used a <b>detached</b> <b>trunk</b> from a small shrub as a stabilizer during food gathering, and another used a log as a bridge. One {{possible explanation for the}} absence of observed tool use in wild gorillas is that they are less dependent on foraging techniques that require the use of tools, since they exploit food resources differently from chimpanzees. Whereas chimpanzees and orangutans feeding involves tools such as hammers to crack open nuts and sticks to fish for termites, gorillas access these foods by breaking nuts with their teeth and smashing termite mounds with their hands.|$|R
40|$|Descriptions {{of novel}} tool use by great apes in {{response}} to different circumstances aids us in understanding the factors favoring the evolution of tool use in humans. This paper documents what {{we believe to be}} the first two observations of tool use in wild western gorillas (Gorilla gorilla). We first observed an adult female gorilla using a branch as a walking stick to test water deepness and to aid in her attempt to cross a pool of water at Mbeli Bai, a swampy forest clearing in northern Congo. In the second case we saw another adult female using a <b>detached</b> <b>trunk</b> from a small shrub as a stabilizer during food processing. She then used the trunk as a self-made bridge to cross a deep patch of swamp. In contrast to information from other great apes, which mostly show tool use in the context of food extraction, our observations show that in gorillas other factors such as habitat type can stimulate the use of tools...|$|R
50|$|The Hudson Terraplane Utility Coupe was a {{business}} car, especially for salesman who needed to transport their samples. The design allowed the salesman to carry their products regardless of weather conditions. If they were transporting a product that was long, the salesmen were able to slide the cargo box out and let the tailgate down. They could also <b>detach</b> the <b>trunk</b> door for the larger products, if necessary.|$|R
5000|$|In 1960, Jane Goodall {{observed}} a chimpanzee poking pieces of grass into a termite mound and then raising the grass to his mouth. After he left, Goodall approached the mound and repeated the behaviour {{because she was}} unsure what the chimpanzee was doing. She found that the termites bit onto the grass with their jaws. The chimpanzee had been using the grass {{as a tool to}} “fish” or [...] "dip" [...] for termites. There are more limited reports of the closely related bonobo using tools in the wild; it has been claimed they rarely use tools in the wild although they use tools as readily as chimpanzees when in captivity, It has been reported that both female chimpanzees and bonobos use tools more avidly than males. Orangutans in Borneo scoop catfish out of small ponds. Anthropologist Anne Russon saw several animals on these forested islands learn on their own to jab at catfish with sticks, so that the panicked prey would flop out of ponds and into the orangutan's waiting hands There are few reports of gorillas using tools in the wild. An adult female Western lowland gorilla used a branch as a walking stick apparently to test water depth and to aid her in crossing a pool of water. Another adult female used a <b>detached</b> <b>trunk</b> from a small shrub as a stabilizer during food gathering, and another used a log as a bridge.|$|R
5000|$|Sooty bark disease causes wilting of {{the crown}} and dieback of branches. Rectangular patches of bark, and later long strips of bark, become <b>detached</b> from the <b>trunk</b> exposing thick layers of black fungal spores. It {{has been found that}} the fungus spreads more rapidly through the tree's tissues at [...] than at , and in the former instance, more rapidly when the tree is under greater water stress. This would seem to suggest that the disease is {{associated}} with raised summer temperatures.|$|R
60|$|The {{foliage of}} David Cox has been already noticed (preface to second edition.) It is {{altogether}} exquisite in color, {{and in its}} impressions of coolness, shade, and mass; of its drawing I cannot say anything, but that I should be sorry to see it better. Copley Fielding's is remarkable for its intricacy and elegance; it is, however, not free from affectation, and, as has been before remarked, is always evidently composed in the study. The execution is too rough and woolly; it is wanting in simplicity, sharpness, and freshness,--above all in specific character: not, however, in his middle distances, where the rounded masses of forest and <b>detached</b> blasted <b>trunks</b> of fir are usually very admirable. Cattermole has very grand conceptions of general form, but wild and without substance, and therefore incapable of long maintaining their attractiveness, especially lately, the execution having become in the last degree coarse and affected. This is bitterly to be regretted, for few of our artists would paint foliage better, if he would paint it from nature, and with reverence.|$|R
5000|$|The seed is planted at {{the foot}} of a small tree and the vine scrambles up the trunk. When it gets too tall to be easily reached, it is <b>detached</b> from the <b>trunk</b> and wound round it, the trunk {{becoming}} surrounded by multiple layers of vine. The plant starts flowering when three years old, and as the flowers only last for a day, hand-pollinating them needs to be done in a timely manner. The pods develop over a period of about nine months, and when they turn reddish-brown, they are picked by hand. They are then sun-dried by day and placed in sweatboxes by night. The curing and fermentation process lasts for about three months, during which time the pods lose much of their moisture and become supple and oily.|$|R
40|$|Objective: The chronic {{shortage}} of donor organs for cardiac transplantation {{and the high}} costs for mechanical assist devices demand the development of alternative cardiac assist devices {{for the treatment of}} severe heart failure. Cardiac assistance by stimulated skeletal muscles is currently investigated as such a possible alternative. The goal of the presented study was to construct a newly designed biological skeletal muscle ventricle and to evaluate its possible hemodynamic efficacy in an acute sheep model. Methods: A total of 14 adult sheep were used for acute experiments. The entire thoracic aorta including the aortic root was excised from a donor sheep. An aorto-pericardial pouch conduit (APPC) was created by enlarging the aortic circumference in its middle section with two strips of pericardium. This biological conduit was anastomosed in parallel to the descending aorta of a recipient sheep, using the aortic root as an inflow valve to the conduit. Stimulation electrodes were applicated to the thoracodorsal nerve and the latissimus dorsi muscle was <b>detached</b> from the <b>trunk</b> and wrapped around the pouch. ECG-triggered functional electrical stimulation was applied during cardiac diastole to simulate aortic counterpulsation. Stimulation was performed during various hemodynamic conditions. Results: A standardised surgical procedure suitable for long term studies was established during six experiments. An APPC, with 70 – 80 mm filling volume, was found to be of optimal size. In another eight experiments...|$|R
40|$|Spain {{ranks as}} the world’s leading {{exporter}} of citrus for fresh consumption. Manual harvest accounts for 50 % of the total production costs. Mechanical harvest would increase labor productivity and benefits of growers. Efficiency of these machines depends on the varieties and operating conditions. Use of abscission chemicals has been promoted to increase the detachment rate of fruit without affecting its quality. This work is aimed at studying whether the mechanical harvest and/or the application of an abscission agent affect {{the quality and quantity}} of harvested fruit and tree defoliation under the conditions of citrus cultivation in Spain. Trials were made in a completely randomized experimental design. From 2008 to 2011, different orchards of mandarin and orange trees were sprayed with different doses of ethephon as abscission agent and harvested with a trunk shaker. Harvest related variables (detachment percentage, defoliation and fruit without calyx) were measured. The percentage of fruit <b>detached</b> by the <b>trunk</b> shaker ranged between 70 and 85 % and it did not depend on the orchard. The shaker produced minimal damage to the bark when gripped incorrectly. Increased doses of ethephon increased fruit detachment except in ‘Clemenules’ orchard, but also increased the fruit without calyx in 1 - 9 %. Moreover, ethephon promoted significant defoliation. Neither gummosis nor death of branches was observed. This work demonstrates that mechanical harvesting with trunk shakers may be a feasible solution for citrus cultivated in Spain for fresh market. Use of ethephon could only be recommended for citrus destined to industry and only for certain varieties...|$|R
40|$|We have {{investigated}} tiny molecular clumps in the Rosette Nebula. Radio observations {{were made of}} molecular line emission from 16 globulettes identified in a previous optical survey. In addtion, we collected images in the NIR broad-band JHKs and narrow-band Paschen beta and H 2. Ten objects, for which we collected information from several transitions in 12 CO and 13 CO were modelled using a spherically symmetric model. The best fit to observed line ratios and intensities was obtained by assuming a model composed of a cool and dense centre and warm and dense surface layer. The average masses derived range from about 50 to 500 Jupiter masses, {{which is similar to}} earlier estimates based on extinction measures. The globulettes selected are dense, with very thin layers of fluorescent H 2 emission. The NIR data shows that several globulettes are very opaque and contain dense cores. Because of the high density encountered already at the surface, the rims become thin, as evidenced by our P beta images. We conclude that the entire complex of shells, elephant trunks, and globulettes {{in the northern part of}} the nebula is expanding with nearly the same velocity of ~ 22 km/s, and with a very small spread in velocity among the globulettes. Some globulettes are in the process of <b>detaching</b> from elephant <b>trunks</b> and shells, while other more isolated objects must have detached long ago and are lagging behind in the general expansion of the molecular shell. The suggestion that some globulettes might collapse to form planetary-mass objects or brown dwarfs is strengthened by our finding of dense cores in several objects.

40|$|Objective To {{discuss how}} to protect {{external}} branch of superior laryngeal nerve (EBSLN) during carotid endarterectomy (CEA) by studying on microsurgical anatomy of EBSLN in cadaver head specimens. Methods Ten cadaver heads [20 sides, average age (54. 43 ± 4. 08) years old] were studied by microsurgical anatomy. Skin as well as platysma was incised under the surgical microscope. Then sternocleidomastoid was retracted laterally. The origin of superior laryngeal nerve was found along the vagus nerve superiorly after it was discovered in the carotid sheath. The segment of superior laryngeal nerve from origin to bifurcation was carefully <b>detached</b> along the <b>trunk</b> of superior laryngeal nerve. Then EBSLN from bifurcation {{to the surface of}} inferior pharyngeal constrictor muscle where the nerve piercing in it was detached, and the thickness of the nerve was measured. Digastric muscle, common carotid artery (CCA), internal carotid artery (ICA), external carotid artery (ECA) and superior thyroid artery (SThA) were isolated to expose the triangle bounded superiorly by stylohyoid muscle, posteriorly by ECA, and anteriorly by SThA. The occurrence rate of EBSLN in this triangle was observed and recorded. The distance of this nerve segment with mastoid tip (MT) and angle of mandible (AM) as well as the bifurcation of common carotid artery (bCCA) was also measured. Results Nineteen sides of EBSLN were observed in the triangle, except one side. The occurrence rate of EBSLN in this triangle is 19 / 20, and the thickness of the nerve was (0. 93 ± 0. 83) mm (0. 72 - 1. 15 mm). This nerve segment was (0. 34 ± 0. 96) cm (- 1. 62 - 2. 43 cm) posterior and (1. 28 ± 0. 93) cm (- 1. 33 - 3. 42 cm) inferior to AM; (2. 84 ± 1. 09) cm (0. 51 - 5. 14 cm) anterior and (4. 51 ± 0. 76) cm (2. 82 - 6. 39 cm) inferior to MT; (1. 64 ± 0. 89) cm (0. 57 - 3. 78 cm) anterosuperior to bCCA (19 / 20). Conclusions This triangle and other 3 anatomical landmarks (MT, AM and bCCA) are significant to find and protect EBSLN during CEA...|$|R
40|$|L’amélioration de la résistance des cyprès à Coryneum cardinale suppose une {{standardisation}} des techniques et la connaissance des relations hôte-parasite. Des techniques d’isolement, de production d’inoculum, d’inoculation et de notation sont proposées. La pression d’inoculum joue un rôle important dans l’inoculation; elle ne dépend ni de l’hôte, ni de l’isolat, mais est modifiée par l’acide naphthalène acétique. L’inoculation sur blessures est toujours positive; l’évolution des infections, d’abord lente, s’accélère dans une phase primaire au cours de laquelle un symptôme nécrotique de l’écorce peut dépasser largement le front d’avance mycélien. Ce symptôme à distance est surtout développé au printemps sur rameaux excisés. L’infection évolue en priorité dans le sens longitudinal, le long du cambium, puis envahit le liber et le phelloderme; elle peut être stoppée par {{la formation}} d’un cal entouré d’une barrière de suber. Les réactions individuelles des hôtes sont diverses; les sujets résistants donnent des lésions plus longues sur rameaux, moins larges sur cônes que les arbres sensibles. Cette corrélation négative ainsi que l’utilisation de plantes de plus de 18 mois pourraient servir de tests précoces de comportement. Improvement in {{the resistance of}} cypress to Coryneum cardinale requires reliable standardized techniques and good knowledge of host reactions. Inoculations were carried out with spore suspension placed in cylindrical wounds cut in the bark with the sharpened metallic end of a ball-pen, or by embedding toothpicks infected with pathogen mycelium into host tissue (fig. 1). Test inoculations were made on small branches (excised or not), <b>detached</b> cones and <b>trunks.</b> Necrotic area and cankers were measured and observations made on pathological and cytological changes in host tissue {{and its ability to}} seal off the diseased area. The effect of temperature on growth was established (fig. 2). The minimum effective dose of inoculum was 50 conidia per wound, but 500 were needed to get full success. This was independent of host species or pathogen strain used (fig. 3, 4), but could be decreased if naphthalene acetic acid was added to the spore suspension (fig. 5). Infection developed along the cambium, with little restriction in the longitudinal direction. Lateral extension occurred through medullary rays between bast fibers, phelloderm cells and into the wood where thick-walled tracheids usually stop the fungus (fig. 7, 8). In excised small branches, brown necrosis frequently occurred in advance of the hyphae (fig. 6), mostly from resistant trees. Resistance could be accomplished in different ways by formation of a collenchymatous callus (fig. 9), surrounded by a wound periderm isolating the affected area. Physiological status of the host, climate and season modified the infection process (fig. 10). Scoring for resistance through individual qualitative reactions was somewhat difficult and was of course difficult to correlate with quantitative parameters, such as lesion size. Comparing resistant versus susceptible hosts by different techniques (table 1) proved to be difficult. However, the negative correlation between infection of cones and small branches of C. sempervirens (fig. 11) could be the basis of an early test to make a rough selection within a population of trees. Seedlings at least 18 months old also looked promising, provided trunk diameter measured more than 8 mm. Further studies will be necessary to obtain good and objective early tests. The broad genetic variability of natural populations gives good hope for success in selecting cypress for resistance to canker...|$|R
40|$|Context. Tiny {{molecular}} clumps {{are abundant}} in many H II regions surrounding newborn stellar clusters. In optical images these so-called globulettes appear as dark patches {{against the background}} of bright nebulosity. The majority of the globulettes were found to be of planetary mass in a previous optical investigation, while the largest objects may contain more than half a solar mass. Aims. We aim to clarify the physical nature of globulettes by deriving densities and masses, and to determine their velocities as a function of position over the nebula. This information will provide clues to the question of origins, evolution, and fate of globulettes. The Rosette Nebula is relatively rich in globulettes, and we selected a sample of well-confined objects of different sizes for the present investigation. Methods. Radio observations were made of molecular line emission from 16 globulettes combined with near-infrared (NIR) broad-band JHKs and narrow-band Paschen beta and H- 2 imaging. Ten objects, for which we collected information from several transitions in (CO) -C- 12 and (CO) -C- 13, were modelled using a spherically symmetric model. Results. Practically all globulettes were detected in our CO survey. The observed (CO) -C- 12 (3 - 2) and (2 - 1) line temperatures range from 0. 6 K to 6 K, the (CO) -C- 13 being a third of this. As a rule, the lines are narrow, similar to 1. 0 km s(- 1). The best fit to observed line ratios and intensities was obtained by assuming a model composed of a cool and dense centre and warm and dense surface layer. This model provides estimates of maximum and minimum mass; the average masses range from about 50 to 500 Jupiter masses, which is similar to earlier estimates based on extinction measures. The selected globulettes are dense, n(H) similar to 10 (4) cm(- 3), with very thin layers of fluorescent H- 2 emission, showing that the gas is in molecular form just below the surface. The NIR data show that several globulettes are very opaque and contain dense cores. No infrared-excess stars in the fields are associated with globulettes. Internal gas motions are weak, but some larger objects show velocity-shifted components associated with tails. However, most globulettes show no signs of tails or pronounced bright rims in contradiction to current numerical simulations of clumps exposed to intense stellar radiation. Because of the high density encountered already at the surface, the rims become thin, as evidenced by our P beta images, which also show extended emission that most likely comes from the backside of the globulettes. We conclude that the entire complex of shells, elephant trunks, and globulettes {{in the northern part of}} the nebula is expanding with nearly the same velocity of similar to 22 km s(- 1), and with a very small spread in velocity among the globulettes. We note that the velocities observed for background shells do not fit into a spherically expanding nebular complex. Conclusions. Some globulettes are in the process of <b>detaching</b> from elephant <b>trunks</b> and shells, while other more isolated objects must have detached long ago and are lagging behind in the general expansion of the molecular shell. Several globulettes are presently subject to heavy erosion from the intense radiation field from the central stars and eject gas streams (tails), while other quite isolated objects lack such signatures. We envision that after detachment, the objects erode to isolated and dense clumps. The suggestion that some globulettes might collapse to form planetary-mass objects or brown dwarfs is strengthened by our finding of dense cores in several objects. Such free-floating low-mass objects would move at high speed from the start and escape from the region...|$|R
