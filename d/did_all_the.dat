5|$|For the {{confrontation}} between Bond and Trevelyan inside the antenna cradle, director Campbell {{decided to take}} inspiration from Bond's fight with Red Grant in From Russia with Love. Pierce Brosnan and Sean Bean <b>did</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> stunts themselves, except for one take where one is thrown against the wall. Brosnan injured his hand while filming the extending ladder sequence, making producers delay his scenes and film the ones in Severnaya earlier.|$|E
5|$|Although Bagramyan {{found it}} {{acceptable}} to sustain heavy casualties (as <b>did</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> commanders of the Red Army), he was disturbed with the immense {{loss of life}} his forces were sustaining. He, however, attempted to reduce those levels primarily by maintaining {{the element of surprise}} in operations. In his preparations for Bagration, he planned for the 43rd Army to move through the more geographically difficult swamps and marshlands to Army Group North's right flank. This maneuver would thus take North by surprise since it expected the Soviet offensive to move through more suitable terrain. He proved correct, as in early June 1944, the 43rd achieved success in its attack. Commander of the 43rd Army, General Afanasy Beloborodov, wrote that during the offensive they apprehended a German general who stated that German forces had been blindsided by the attacking forces.|$|E

5|$|The {{division}} of labor for shooting the starship models was decided early on by effects cameramen Peter Daulton and Pat Sweeney. There was {{an equal amount of}} work if one crew <b>did</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> Enterprise shots and another did the Bird of Prey, Klingon cruiser and Excelsior shots, so the cameramen flipped to decide who worked on which models. Old and new techniques were applied to shooting the models. To make sure the vessels were seamlessly inserted into star fields in post-production, the crew filmed second passes in overexposed yellow light, which reduced light spillage onto the bluescreen backdrop. The yellow overcast was removed by filtration in the optical process, with the result being a clean edge around the ships.|$|E
5|$|After the Liberation of Paris in August 1944, the French {{scientists}} {{wanted to}} go home. Auger had already returned to London to join the French Scientific Mission in April 1944. Halban returned {{on a visit to}} London and Paris in November 1944, where he saw Frédéric Joliot-Curie {{for the first time since}} leaving France. While he maintained that he did not divulge any nuclear secrets to his previous boss (although he had discussed patent rights), Halban was not allowed to work or to leave North America for a year, although he left the Montreal Laboratory in April 1945. In 1946 he settled in England. B. W. Sargent then became Head of the nuclear physics division. Cockcroft arranged for Goldschmidt, Guéron and Kowarski to remain until June 1945, later extended until the end of 1945. Goldschmidt was willing to stay longer, and Cockcroft wanted to keep him, but Groves insisted that he should go, and, in the interest of Allied harmony, he <b>did.</b> <b>All</b> <b>the</b> French scientists had left by January 1946.|$|E

25|$|The modern term {{vandalism}} {{stems from}} the Vandals' reputation as the barbarian people who sacked and looted Rome in AD 455. The Vandals were probably not any more destructive than other invaders of ancient times, but writers who idealized Rome often blamed them for its destruction. For example, English Enlightenment poet John Dryden wrote, Till Goths, and Vandals, a rude Northern race, / <b>Did</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> matchless Monuments deface.|$|E

As a team, the Hawkeyes racked up exactly 300 yards rushing and 518 yards of total offense.|$|E
25|$|On 18 November 1908, the État {{absorbed the}} Chemins de fer de l'Ouest and in 1934 {{took over the}} Paris-Orléans company's lines in {{southern}} Brittany. At its greatest extent its operating area comprised all the territory west of a line extending from Dieppe by way of Paris to Bordeaux. On 1 January 1938 the État merged {{with all the other}} French railway companies to form the Société Nationale des Chemins de fer Français (SNCF), becoming that company's Région Ouest. The État then took a seat on the SNCF's Board of Directors, as <b>did</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> other companies until 1982 when all traces of the constituents of the SNCF disappeared.|$|E
25|$|Edison's work on rubber {{took place}} largely at his botanic {{research}} laboratory in Fort Myers, {{which has been}} designated as a National Historic Chemical Landmark. The laboratory was built after Thomas Edison, Henry Ford, and Harvey Firestone pulled together $75,000 to form the Edison Botanical Research Corporation. Initially, only Ford and Firestone were to contribute funds to the project while Edison <b>did</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> research. Edison, however, wished to contribute $25,000 as well. After testing over 17,000 plant species, Edison decided on Solidago leavenworthii, also known as Leavenworth's Goldenrod. The plant, which normally grows roughly 3–4 feet tall with a 5% latex yield, was adapted by Edison through cross-breeding to produce plants twice the size and with a latex yield of 12%.|$|E

25|$|Before the 20th century, all maize {{harvesting}} was by manual labour, by grazing, or by {{some combination}} of those. Whether the ears were hand-picked and the stover was grazed, or the whole plant was cut, gathered, and shocked, people and livestock <b>did</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> work. Between the 1890s and the 1970s, the technology of maize harvesting expanded greatly. Today, all such technologies, from entirely manual harvesting to entirely mechanized, are still in use to some degree, as appropriate to each farm's needs, although the thoroughly mechanized versions predominate, as they offer the lowest unit costs when scaled to large farm operations. For small farms, their unit cost can be too high, as their higher fixed cost cannot be amortized over as many units.|$|E
25|$|Since its foundation, {{the socialist}} party has opposed every war – {{including}} both World War I and World War II. Although, in its early years, party writers frequently would contrast the numbers of dead in wars with the numbers killed and maimed in industrial incidents (by {{way of trying to}} contrast the passions and efforts put into war with the lack of response to the conditions of capitalism) the party argued that wars in capitalism were fought {{in the interests of the}} capitalist class and – as with their case against nationalism – the workers <b>did</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> dying for no gain for themselves. Further, they emphasised that while the press and politicians tried to call for strike moderation, the capitalists would continue the class war despite hostilities, forcing down wages and up consumer good prices. During both wars, some members won Conscientious objector status.|$|E
25|$|The AIF faced {{their last}} county {{opposition}} on Friday, 29 August in another two-day match, though they won this one. It was {{just down the}} road from Clifton at the Taunton County Ground where they defeated Somerset by 95 runs in a very low-scoring game: AIF 85 and 144 for four declared; Somerset 70 and 64. Only 363 runs in the entire game. The first day was impacted by rain and only 59 overs were bowled. The AIF were all out for 85 just before the scheduled close of play. They quickly dismissed Somerset for 70 in only 32 overs of the second morning. Seamer Charlie Winning and slow left armer Collins <b>did</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> bowling, Winning taking six for 30 and Collins four for 38. Collins followed up with 67* to give the Australians a useful lead of 159 going into {{the latter half of the}} last day.
