Amongst other things, we provide a quantitative figure of what is monetized in the experiment, expressed as a percentage of what should be monetized if all negative external effects were to be taken into account. The experiment uses three different external cost evaluation methods. The most comprehensive method monetizes less than 10 % of the flows of the industrial process studied. According to the method used and the assumptions made, external costs vary by a factor of more than 1 to 12, 000 per unit of product. The paper then discusses what can be learnt by comparing the range of results obtained with each method and suggests directions for future research. ...|$|E
40|$|Power {{generation}} expansion planning inherently involves multiple, conflicting and incommensurate objectives. Therefore, mathematical models {{become more}} realistic if distinct evaluation aspects, such as cost and environmental concerns, are explicitly considered as objective functions {{rather than being}} encompassed by a single economic indicator. With the aid of multiple objective models, decision makers may grasp the conflicting nature and the trade-offs among the different objectives in order to select satisfactory compromise solutions. This paper presents a multiple objective mixed integer linear programming model for power generation expansion planning that allows the consideration of modular expansion capacity values of supply-side options.

40|$|<b>Full</b> <b>cost</b> <b>accounting</b> {{has been}} applied in many {{industrial}} settings that include the oil and gas, energy, chemical and waste management industries. Presently, {{it is not known}} how it can be applied in an automotive industry context. Therefore, the objective {{of this paper is to}} review existing <b>full</b> <b>cost</b> <b>accounting</b> methods and identify an appropriate approach for the automotive sector. This literature review of 4381 papers extracted ten <b>full</b> <b>cost</b> <b>accounting</b> methods with a diverse level of development and consistency in application. Based on a careful examination and critical analysis of each approach and existing automotive sustainability measures, the Sustainability Assessment Model developed by British Petroleum and Aberdeen University has been proposed as a well-developed and potentially practical tool for automotive applications. The Sustainability Assessment Model can be used by both academics and practitioners to translate a range of conflicting sustainability information into a monetary unit score. This is an effective way of communicating trade-offs and outcomes for complex and multi-disciplinary sustainable decisions in the automotive sector. It measures a broad range of economic, environmental, resource and social effects (internal and external), which is currently lacking in existing automotive systems. Its other strengths are the ability to provide both monetary and physical metrics for sustainability assessment, its flexibility and the ability to combine multiple sustainability dimensions. Furthermore, this paper provides helpful clues for researchers interested in exploring <b>full</b> <b>cost</b> <b>accounting</b> in the future by reviewing, analysing and synthesising the broad range of relevant sources from diverse fields in this topic area...|$|E

Moving from the theoretical background, it is evident that <b>cost</b> <b>accounting</b> methods introduced in healthcare sector bring benefits to the whole society through an increased efficiency of the healthcare services provided. It primarily ensures better governing of hospital’s resources allowing more transparency in spending public funds. The main topic is that with the introduction of <b>cost</b> <b>accounting</b> system for internal purposes in public hospitals, the management would be able to govern them in a more efficient and effective way while reducing costs. The research for this paper was conducted through the interview of accounting officers in one Croatian and one Italian public hospital. The main results show that there are differences in legislation background regarding how they record costs, but also how they allocate costs to the cost objects and in how they use cost information in their decision-making process. In order to successfully manage public hospitals, it is crucial that true, timely and valid information are obtained as a base for the decision-making process. The <b>cost</b> <b>accounting</b> methodology is therefore essential to the management of public hospitals.
