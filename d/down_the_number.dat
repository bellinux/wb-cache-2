5|$|As the {{additional}} main battery turrets with their associated magazines used {{a great amount}} of space within each already-limited ship, Capps was forced to economize in other ways to stay within the tonnage limit. Machinery had to be built smaller than normal to fit in the space between the fore and aft magazines, both of which were larger than usual. Boiler rooms were moved inboard to make room for torpedo protection. The biggest drawback was in propulsion: {{there was no room for}} engines that could provide the same amount of power as on previous battleships. Capps suggested cutting <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of boilers by one-third to make room; it may have been at this point that he considered turbine propulsion, for which he would have needed extra room. All the Bureau of Engineering could offer in response was more compact boiler rooms by eliminating centerline bulkheads.|$|E
5|$|Long before {{working on}} Charlotte, Maeda had thought up a concept {{for a story}} with {{characters}} who have imperfect superpowers that must cooperate {{with each other to}} resolve any incidents that arise. Maeda originally submitted three separate ideas for a story to Toba, and he asked him which one he liked best. However, after Toba pointed out one of the other two, Maeda {{made it clear that he}} wanted to do the story that would become Charlotte. When writing the story, Maeda also reconsidered how he had done certain things with Angel Beats!. In particular, he attempted to put more of a focus on the behavior of the characters. Maeda also narrowed <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of main characters in Charlotte compared to Angel Beats!, which could not put a focus on each and every character. Toba felt that Maeda was influenced by his work on Angel Beats!, which changed his thought process and what he wanted to depict in Charlotte.|$|E

5|$|The {{story was}} {{originally}} conceived by Jun Maeda, who also wrote the screenplay and composed {{some of the}} music, with original character design by Na-Ga. Both Maeda and Na-Ga are from the visual novel brand Key, and Charlotte is the second original anime series created by Key following Angel Beats! in 2010. Maeda had thought up the concept for Charlotte long before he was approached in early 2012 to work on another anime series after Angel Beats!. Maeda narrowed <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of main characters compared to Angel Beats! and attempted to put more of a focus on their behavior. Instead of employing the same staff that had worked on Angel Beats!, the aim for Charlotte was to bring together a staff that would add a new variety to the creative process to prevent being influenced by the work done on Angel Beats!.|$|E
5|$|To {{describe}} {{the details of}} the attack and its background, Dumont de Montigny and Antoine-Simon Le Page du Pratz, the leading 18th-century historians of Louisiana, drew on information collected from French women taken captive during the massacre. They explained that the Natchez had conspired with other nations but had attacked a few days earlier than the date agreed upon and that they had used a system of bundles of sticks held by each of the conspiring tribes in order to count <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of days remaining until the strike. The undetected destruction of a couple of the sticks in the Natchez Grand Village derailed the count, although the reason for the lost sticks differed in each historian's account. The other nations called off their participation in the plot because of the Natchez' premature attack, and therefore the very existence of the conspiracy remained conjectural.|$|E

There were several attempts to break down inflation, such as a 75% capital levy in December 1945. However, this did not stop the hyperinflation, and prices continued spiraling out of control, with ever-higher denominations introduced. The denominations milpengő (one million pengő) and b.-pengő (pronunciation: bilpengő, one trillion pengő) were used to alleviate calculations, cut <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of zeros and enable the reuse of banknote designs with only the colour and denomination name changed.|$|E

25|$|In response, the Republicans {{appealed to}} {{democratic}} principles. Samuel Smith of Maryland {{argued that the}} presidency ought to be as closely accountable to the people as possible. As such, having three candidates in a contingency election is far better than having five, because {{it is possible to}} have the fifth best candidate become President otherwise. Also, designation itself would drastically cut <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of elections that would reach the house, and the President is then {{much more likely to be}} the people’s choice. Another of Smith’s arguments was simply the election of 1800. William Cocke of Tennessee took a different approach when he argued that the entire small state argument of the Federalists was simply out of self-interest.|$|E

The plan also calls for the replacement of both current stations with a single new station located a block west of the current 11th Street boarding location (between Franklin and Washington streets) with a modern, high-level platform and parking lot.
