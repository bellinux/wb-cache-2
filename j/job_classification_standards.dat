40|$|Abstract niet beschikbaarPart a {{introduces}} the CBS <b>job</b> <b>classification</b> at the Monitoring Risk Factor Project on cardiovascular diseases. an error analysis {{with regard to}} the coding of the jobs is the basis for recommendations for the questions about job characteristics in the new questionnaire. In part B the relation between job and (potential) risk factors for cardiovascular diseases is studied. The U&S job presitige scale and the Social Group (both derived from the CBS <b>job</b> <b>classification</b> 1984) are compared with the C 2 classification, that has been used until now, on explaining power. The results showed that job (controlled for education) is especially related to food habits and the consumption of alcohol. The risk factors athat are significant vary with the different groups. The relations are not always linear. The different <b>job</b> <b>classifications</b> are about equally strong in their explanation of (possible) risk factors. The variables explained are different for each <b>job</b> <b>classification...</b>|$|R

The financial data <b>classification</b> <b>standard,</b> which always performs excellently in these aspects, is an essential premise for data mining and analysis in the big data 2. To find a method to form the <b>classification</b> <b>standard</b> framework that can meet diverse purposes is very important. This research proposes a way to form the framework of financial data <b>classification</b> <b>standard</b> based on uniform <b>classification</b> <b>standard</b> and relative books, improved by comparing with <b>classification</b> <b>standard</b> of existed financial database and verified by practice with financial data sources. This framework can adapt to trends in the era of the big data and improve data storage mode...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to measure the relationship between employee preference types and their respective <b>job</b> <b>classifications</b> in public horticulture. Preference types were determined by the Myers Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI). Past and current research indicates that certain preference types I gravitate to particular jobs due to type strengths, likes and preferences. By learning about preference types, staff in public horticulture can improve employee interpersonal relations, productivity, individual understanding, and decrease conflict and stress. The MBTI was given to staff who volunteered to participate in this research from Longwood Gardens, Morris, Scott, and Tyler Arboreta. The results show that certain preference types seem to be attracted to particular <b>job</b> <b>classifications</b> in public horticulture. There are preference differences between the individual <b>job</b> <b>classifications</b> which could cause miscommunication and conflict; therefore, {{it is important to understand}} the differences to be effective managers and employees...|$|R

This study aimed to investigate the influence of age-group <b>classification</b> <b>standards</b> on the {{prognosis of patients with}} high-grade hemispheric glioma (HGG). This retrospective study of 125 HGG patients used three different <b>classification</b> <b>standards</b> of age-groups (≤ 50 and > 50 years old, ≤ 60 and > 60 years old, ≤ 45 and 45 – 65 and ≥ 65 years old) to evaluate the impact of age on prognosis. The primary end-point was overall survival (OS). The Kaplan–Meier method was applied for univariate analysis and Cox proportional hazards model for multivariate analysis. Univariate analysis showed a significant correlation between OS and all three <b>classification</b> <b>standards</b> of age-groups as well as between OS and pathological grade, gender, location of glioma, and regular chemotherapy and radiotherapy treatment. Multivariate analysis showed that the only independent predictors of OS were <b>classification</b> <b>standard</b> of age-groups ≤ 50 and > 50 years old, pathological grade and regular chemotherapy. In summary, the most appropriate <b>classification</b> <b>standard</b> of age-groups as an independent prognostic factor was ≤ 50 and > 50 years old. Pathological grade and chemotherapy were also independent predictors of OS in post-operative HGG patients...|$|R

40|$|The Analysis of Compensation System in The Antara-Reuters Strategic Business Unit Irmayanti The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to: identify the job factors which is considered in the job point, analyze the employees' perception related to the job factors which is considered in the job point, analyze the criteria of internal consistency requirement in the compensation system based on job points and analyze the factors which influence the salary of employees. There were four methods used in this study, 1) the job evaluation by Point System Method which results in the job points, 2) employees' perception towards the job evaluation by factor analysis, 3) construct a pay structure based on the compensation theories with and without <b>job</b> <b>classification,</b> 4) analyze the influence of the independent variables (<b>job</b> <b>classification,</b> job/position, working experience, and achievements) through double regression. The result of the process is then analyzed and elaborated by description method. The factor analysis shows that there are 3 factors which is the reduction of the 18 original factors. The status of the employees in the pay structure without <b>job</b> <b>classification</b> indicates that 1 employees were under paid and 2 over paid. The pay structure with <b>job</b> <b>classification</b> resulted in five salary group. The calculation indicates that there are 3 employees in the under paid status and 2 over paid status. The double regression analysis indicates that all the independent variables (except working experiences) has a significant influence towards determination of compensation/salary.

40|$|Noise {{exposures}} {{were measured}} in the electric and natural gas distribution operations workforce of a large Midwestern utility. Both personal dosimetry and area monitoring were utilized to evaluate noise exposures based on <b>job</b> <b>classification</b> as well as operation of specific equipment or performance of certain tasks. <b>Job</b> <b>classifications</b> were chosen for study based on observable noise exposures and employee requests. Five <b>job</b> <b>classifications</b> were sampled with 90 % confidence according to NIOSH guidelines for sample sizes. Three of the five <b>job</b> <b>classifications</b> were previously enrolled in the company hearing conservation program {{and two of them}} were not. The study determined that four of the five work groups met the exposure criteria for inclusion in an employer sponsored hearing conservation program while the fifth group did not. The group that did not demonstrate exposures above the inclusion criterion should not be excluded from the program as it was revealed that other exposures exist that were not able to be measured during the study. These activities need to be evaluated before the group can be removed from the hearing conservation program. All three of the task based analysis studies demonstrated noise exposure or the potential for noise exposure higher than regulatory limits. As a result of the measurements, double hearing protection was recommended for one task and the final task based analysis revealed potential for exposure so high that engineering controls or remote operation methods must be pursued...|$|R
