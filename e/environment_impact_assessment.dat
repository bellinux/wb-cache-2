5|$|An {{amendment}} to the Government of India's <b>Environment</b> <b>Impact</b> <b>Assessment</b> Notification of 1994 was made in 2004, which required that environmental clearance be granted to any parcel of land that falls under the Yamuna floodplain before beginning any construction activities. Since Akshardham commenced construction activities in 2000, prior to the enactment of this amendment, it {{did not apply to}} Akshardham. However certain NGOs and activists felt that the temple was constructed without obtaining the necessary environmental clearances. On January 2005, the U.P. Employees Federation presented their case before the Supreme Court of India that the temple had not obtained necessary environmental clearances {{and that it would be}} harmful to the environment. After hearing the case, the Supreme Court observed that in the construction of Akshardham, all the Land Use Plans had been adhered to and clearance of expert bodies like the Central Water Commission and the National Environment Engineering Research Institute has been obtained. Thus, the Supreme Court ruled that the Akshardham construction was lawful and did not violate environmental norms. Despite this ruling, some activists and politicians continued to assert that the Akshardham construction was illegal and posed a threat to the Yamuna River floodplains. In a 2009 ruling on a related issue, the Supreme Court further clarified that it rejected as false the assertions that Akshardham did not have environmental permissions and was harmful to the Yamuna riverbed. It reiterated its earlier 2005 Ruling that Akshardham had received all necessary environmental permissions from Central Water Commission and NEERI, which is an autonomous body, and that the Akshardham site was not located on the Yamuna “riverbed” or “floodplain”, but 1700 meters away from the Yamuna River bank.|$|E

40|$|Abstract:- In the <b>environment</b> <b>impacts</b> <b>assessment</b> context, several {{methods are}} {{proposed}} in literature, such as life cycle analysis, multi criteria analysis and {{cost benefit analysis}} etc. Recently, others methods combining MCDA (Multi Criteria Decision Analysis) and AI (Artificial Intelligence) have been explored to develop enhanced methodologies for knowledge based decision support. In this paper, a new approach is presented for environmental assessment of urban mobility. Various criteria should be evaluated using complex data obtained from several information sources. Therefore, the measure evaluation related to urban mobility is a hard task that does not always lead to efficient results. The problem treated in this paper, is complex with insufficient, fuzzy and uncertain data. A hybrid approach based on multi criteria analysis and various information sources has been proposed. The methodology uses fuzzy set theory for modeling criteria and belief theory (Dempster-Shafer Theory (DST)) for evaluations fusion and {{it is able to}} handle uncertainty and vagueness.

40|$|Background The {{paper will}} {{report on a}} recent series of 3 reviews carried out for NICE in 2010 and {{identifying}} barriers that impede the full integration of health into development planning, and facilitators that enable or promote that integration. Aim the aim is twofold: i) to identify {{the extent to which}} health and wellbeing are incorporated into the policies of British local authority spatial plans and compare across cases ii) to identify which <b>impact</b> <b>assessment</b> methods such as health impact, environmental <b>impact</b> or strategic <b>environment</b> <b>impact</b> <b>assessments</b> can facilitate the integration of health considerations into spatial plans and projects and why. Methods i) a purposive non-random sampling approach identifying ten local authorities and reviewing their spatial plans; ii) a systematic review of literature followed an actor centred governance and policy analysis Results First, the results highlight the varying degrees to which spatial plans explicitly consider five health issues (physical activity, mental wellbeing, environmental health, unintentional injury, health equality). Only two of the ten local authorities reviewed demonstrated an explicit link between health issues and planning policy. Second, we were able to identify which <b>impact</b> <b>assessment</b> methods allowed the consideration of health issues in planning decisions and further identified the factors facilitating that process. Conclusions The results also allowed us to draw some conclusions on the governance and policy processes towards a more effective integration of health into development planning. The key conclusion from the case studies {{is that it is not}} primarily the planning system that inhibits health-integrated plans and projects, but engagement between health and planning professionals over the years facilitate the process. The literature review further identified that knowledge sharing, partnership working, targeting resources and synchronising <b>impact</b> <b>assessments</b> with planning processes can improve the effectiveness of <b>impact</b> <b>assessment</b> in integrating health considerations into planning decisions...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a sustainability <b>impact</b> <b>assessment</b> (SIA) of policy induced land use changes in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. The regional problems include rapid expansions of urban areas, due to high population pressure, and the conversion of paddy fields and forests into settlements. The objective {{of this study was to}} assess the impacts of two land use policies on social, economic, and environmental Land Use Functions (LUFs) in Yogyakarta. The following scenarios were developed for the SIA: a forest protection scenario (S 1), a paddy field conservation scenario (S 2), and a counterfactual (no policy) scenario of ‘Business As Usual’ (BAU). The Framework for Participatory <b>Impact</b> <b>Assessment</b> (FoPIA) was applied to conduct an expert-based <b>impact</b> <b>assessment.</b> For the specification of the regional sustainability context, a set of nine key LUFs and associated indicators were developed, including three social, three economic, and three environmental sustainability criteria. The resulting scenario <b>impacts</b> of the <b>assessment</b> differed considerably, with positive impacts of the S 1 and S 2 scenarios on seven of nine LUFs, and negative impacts of the BAU scenario on six LUFs. The perception of the FoPIA method by the regional stakeholders was positive.

40|$|Environmental <b>impact</b> <b>assessment</b> (EIA) was {{initially}} introduced as an advocacy instrument for the biophysical environment in project decision-making. Strategic environmental assessment (SEA) evolved {{with a similar}} mission for strategic level proposals. However, recent trends towards more integration, particularly {{in the context of}} sustainability assessment (SA) mean that social and economic aspects are now frequently considered {{on a par with the}} <b>environment</b> in <b>impact</b> <b>assessment</b> processes. There are indications that this development will ultimately favour trade-offs towards socio-economic benefits causing adverse environmental impacts. In this paper, we discuss problems connected with these types of integrated assessments. Based on observations of SA processes are actually environmentally unsustainable, we argue that the need for environment focussed EIA and true SEA in planning processes is now greater than ever. We suggest that until power relationships develop in a way that will allow integration in an environmentally sustainable manner, practitioners should not give up the benefits that have arisen from 35 years of EIA practice. We conclude that in our current world, there is nothing wrong with environmental advocacy — let’s continue to use EIA and SEA effectively to protect the environment...|$|R
