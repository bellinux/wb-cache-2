5|$|In the past, a Deshastha widow {{was never}} allowed to remarry, while it was {{acceptable}} for Deshastha widowers to remarry, and the widows had to lead a very austere life with little joy. Divorces were non-existent. All of these practices have gradually fallen by the wayside over the last hundred years, and modern Deshastha widows lead better lives and younger widows also remarry. Divorce takes place by mutual consent and legal approval <b>is</b> <b>sought.</b>|$|E
5|$|Review by appeal, by writ {{of error}} or otherwise, {{must be as}} {{prescribed}} by the act, and review by certificate {{is limited by the}} act to the certificate by the Circuit Courts, made after final judgment, of questions raised as to their own jurisdiction and to the certificate by the Circuit Courts of Appeals of questions of law in relation to which our advice <b>is</b> <b>sought</b> as therein provided, and these certificates are governed by the same general rules as were formerly applied to certificates of division.|$|E
5|$|The {{overarching}} methodological {{principle of}} positivism is to conduct sociology in broadly {{the same manner}} as natural science. An emphasis on empiricism and the scientific method <b>is</b> <b>sought</b> to provide a tested foundation for sociological research {{based on the assumption that}} the only authentic knowledge is scientific knowledge, and that such knowledge can only arrive by positive affirmation through scientific methodology.|$|E

5|$|If a {{mandatory}} order, prohibiting order or quashing order <b>is</b> <b>sought,</b> the applicant must follow the procedure {{set out in}} Order 53 of the Rules of Court. In general, there are two stages. At the first stage, an applicant must obtain leave {{to apply for the}} prerogative order. This requirement prevents unmeritorious applications from being taken against decision-makers by filtering out groundless cases at an early stage to prevent wastage of judicial time, and protects public bodies from harassment, intentional or otherwise. An application for such leave must be made by ex parte originating summons and must be supported by a statement setting out the name and description of the applicant, the relief sought and the grounds on which it is sought; and by an affidavit, to be filed when the application is made, verifying the facts relied on. In granting leave, the judge hearing the application for leave may impose such terms as to costs and as to security as he or she thinks fit.|$|E
5|$|Masters, as Zissos points out, {{argues that}} the Sibyl's {{commands}} to bury Misenus and find the Golden Bough are inverted and compacted in Lucan: Erichtho needs a bodynot buriedbut rather retrieved. Many other parallels and inversions abound, including: the difference of opinions about the ease of getting what <b>is</b> <b>sought</b> from the underworld (the Sibyl says only the initial descent to the underworld will be easy, whereas Erichtho says necromancy is simple), the opposing manner in which those seeking information from the underworld are described (the Sibyl urges Aeneas to be courageous, whereas Erichtho criticizes Sextus Pompeius for being cowardly), and the inverted {{manner in which the}} supernatural rites proceed (the Sibyl sends Aeneas underground to gain knowledge, whereas Erichtho conjures a spirit up out of the ground to learn the future).|$|E
5|$|The nectar of the ﬂowers <b>is</b> <b>sought</b> after by insects, bellbirds, tūī and stitchbirds. The {{leaves and}} the rough bark provide {{excellent}} homes for insects such as caterpillars and moths, small beetles, ﬂy larvae, weta, snails and slugs. Many {{of these are}} then eaten by birds such as saddlebacks and robins. The rough bark also provides opportunities for epiphytes to cling and grow, and lizards hide amongst the dead leaves, coming out to drink the nectar and to eat the insects. Good flowering seasons occur every few years only. While {{it is said that}} they foretell dry summers, it has been observed that they tend to follow dry seasons.|$|E

5|$|Treatment {{is mainly}} supportive; gastric {{decontamination}} with activated charcoal {{may be beneficial}} if medical attention <b>is</b> <b>sought</b> {{within a few hours}} of consumption. However, symptoms often take longer than this to develop, and patients do not usually present for treatment until many hours after ingestion, thus limiting its effectiveness. Patients with severe vomiting or diarrhea can be rehydrated with intravenous fluids. Monitoring of biochemical parameters such as methemoglobin levels, electrolytes, liver and kidney function, urinalysis, and complete blood count is undertaken and any abnormalities are corrected. Dialysis can be used if kidney function is impaired or the kidneys are failing. Hemolysis may require a blood transfusion to replace the lost red blood cells, while methemoglobinemia is treated with intravenous methylene blue.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{the filing}} of the application, the Court may either make an order immediately, or direct that a summons for the order for review of {{detention}} be issued to enable all the parties involved to present arguments to the Court. If the latter course is taken, the ex parte originating summons, supporting affidavit, order of court and summons must be served on the person against whom the order <b>is</b> <b>sought.</b> Unless the Court directs otherwise, {{it is not necessary}} for the person under restraint to be brought before the Court for the hearing of the application. In addition, the Court may order that the person be released while the application is being heard. Once the Court decides to make an order for review of detention, it will direct when the person under restraint is to be brought before the court.|$|E
5|$|When the Syndicate {{suspect that}} one of their members is passing {{information}} to Mulder and Scully, they organise a canary trap to find the leak, using information about the safety of Mulder's mother as bait. X's role as an informant is discovered, and he is shot dead, although he is able to pass along the name of another informant who can be of use to Mulder—Marita Covarrubias (Laurie Holden), the Special Representative to the Secretary-General of the United Nations. Covarrubias' aid <b>is</b> <b>sought</b> when Mulder attempts to reach Tunguska in Russia to investigate the source of a further black oil contamination. Whilst there, Mulder is held in a gulag and used as a successful test subject for a black oil vaccine. He escapes and is able to return to America, having found that Krycek is working with the Russians.|$|E

5|$|Ryder <b>is</b> <b>sought</b> after by the town's {{women but}} begins courting a very light mixed-race woman from Washington, DC named Molly Dixon. He plans to propose {{to her at}} the next Blue Vein ball, for which he is giving a speech. Before the talk, he meets an older, plain-looking black woman. Her name is 'Liza Jane, and she is searching for her husband Sam Taylor, whom she has not seen in 25 years. She says she was married to Sam before the Civil War, when she was enslaved and he was a hired {{apprentice}} to the family of her master. Despite Taylor's being a free black, the family tried to sell him into slavery. She assisted Sam in escaping, and he promised to return and free her, but she was sold to a different master. Ryder says that Taylor could have died, may have outgrown her, or could have remarried. However, she persists in saying that her husband has remained faithful, and refuses to stop looking. Ryder advises her that slave marriages did not count after the war; marriages had to be officially made legal. She shows him an old picture of Sam and leaves.|$|E
5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. When the Syndicate suspect {{that one of their}} members is passing {{information}} to Mulder and Scully, they organize a canary trap to find the leak, using information about the safety of Mulder's mother as bait. X's (Steven Williams) role as an informant is discovered, and he is shot dead, although he is able to pass along the name of another informant who can be of use to Mulder—Marita Covarrubias (Laurie Holden), the Special Representative to the Secretary-General of the United Nations.

5|$|Will Burton (Gaelan Connell) is a music enthusiast and a David Bowie fan {{with a hint}} of {{rock and}} roll and boy next door. Throughout the movie, Will writes journal-like e-mails to Bowie every day, {{although}} Bowie never answers. When Will's mother Karen (Lisa Kudrow) finds a new job, he switches to a new school, which he is eager to do since he was bullied at his previous one. During lunch one day at his new school, he meets a girl who says her name is written Sa5m but pronounced Sam, the 5 is silent (Vanessa Hudgens). She tells him about Bandslam, an annual music competition in which the winning band gets a recording contract. Will and Sa5m quickly become friends but, shortly after, he <b>is</b> <b>sought</b> after by another girl named Charlotte Barnes (Aly Michalka). One afternoon, Charlotte asks Will to join her in an after-school day-care center. When she starts inviting him to hang out with her, the teenager is stunned—as is his single mother Karen. Impressed by his eclectic knowledge of music, Charlotte, who is a gifted singer-songwriter, asks Will to manage her rock/ska band. Her goal is apparently to take revenge on her egocentric musician ex-boyfriend Ben Wheatley (Scott Porter) during Bandslam.|$|E
