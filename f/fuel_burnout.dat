50|$|Soluble poisons, {{also called}} {{chemical}} shim, produce a spatially uniform neutron absorption when dissolved {{in the water}} coolant. The most common soluble poison in commercial pressurized water reactors (PWR) is boric acid, which {{is often referred to}} as soluble boron. The boric acid in the coolant decreases the thermal utilization factor, causing a decrease in reactivity. By varying the concentration of boric acid in the coolant, a process referred to as boration and dilution, the reactivity of the core can be easily varied. If the boron concentration is increased, the coolant/moderator absorbs more neutrons, adding negative reactivity. If the boron concentration is reduced (dilution), positive reactivity is added. The changing of boron concentration in a PWR is a slow process and is used primarily to compensate for <b>fuel</b> <b>burnout</b> or poison buildup. The variation in boron concentration allows control rod use to be minimized, which results in a flatter flux profile over the core than can be produced by rod insertion. The flatter flux profile occurs because there are no regions of depressed flux like those that would be produced in the vicinity of inserted control rods. This system is not in widespread use because the chemicals make the moderator temperature reactivity coefficient less negative. All commercial PWR types operating in the US (Westinghouse, Combustion Engineering, and Babcock & Wilcox) employ soluble boron to control excess reactivity. US Navy reactors and Boiling Water Reactors do not.|$|E

40|$|When the University of Missouri Research Reactor (MURR) was {{designed}} in the 1960 s the potential for <b>fuel</b> element <b>burnout</b> by a phenomenon referred to at that time as 'autocatalytic vapor binding' was of serious concern. This type of burnout was observed to occur at power levels considerably lower than those that were known to cause critical heat flux. The conversion of the MURR from HEU fuel to LEU fuel will probably require significant design changes, such as changes in coolant channel thicknesses, that could affect the thermal-hydraulic behavior of the reactor core. Therefore, the redesign of the MURR to accommodate an LEU core must address the same issues of <b>fuel</b> element <b>burnout</b> that were of concern in the 1960 s. The Advanced Test Reactor (ATR) {{was designed}} {{at about the same}} time as the MURR and had similar concerns with regard to <b>fuel</b> element <b>burnout.</b> These concerns were addressed in the ATR by two groups of thermal-hydraulic tests that employed electrically heated simulated fuel channels. The Croft (1964), Reference 1, tests were performed at ANL. The Waters (1966), Reference 2, tests were performed at Hanford Laboratories in Richland Washington. Since fuel element surface temperatures rise rapidly as burnout conditions are approached, channel surface temperatures were carefully monitored in these experiments. For self-protection, the experimental facilities were designed to cut off the electric power when rapidly increasing surface temperatures were detected. In both the ATR reactor and in the tests with electrically heated channels, the heated length of the fuel plate was 48 inches, which is about twice that of the MURR. Whittle and Forgan (1967) independently conducted tests with electrically heated rectangular channels that were similar to the tests by Croft and by Walters. In the Whittle and Forgan tests the heated length of the channel varied among the tests and was between 16 and 24 inches. Both Waters and Whittle and Forgan show that the cause of the <b>fuel</b> element <b>burnout</b> is due to a form of flow instability. Whittle and Forgan provide a formula that predicts when this flow instability will occur. This formula is included in the PLTEMP/ANL code. Error! Reference source not found. Olson has shown that the PLTEMP/ANL code accurately predicts the powers at which flow instability occurs in the Whittle and Forgan experiments. He also considered the electrically heated tests performed in the ANS Thermal-Hydraulic Test Loop at ORNL and report by M. Siman-Tov et al. The purpose of this memorandum is to demonstrate that the PLTEMP/ANL code accurately predicts the Croft and the Waters tests. This demonstration should provide sufficient confidence that the PLTEMP/ANL code can adequately predict the onset of flow instability for the converted MURR. The MURR core uses light water as a coolant, has a 24 -inch active fuel length, downward flow in the core, and an average core velocity of about 7 m/s. The inlet temperature is about 50 C and the peak outlet is about 20 C higher than the inlet for reactor operation at 10 MW. The core pressures range from about 4 to about 5 bar. The peak heat flux is about 110 W/cm{sup 2 }. Section 2 describes the mechanism that causes flow instability. Section 3 describes the Whittle and Forgan formula for flow instability. Section 4 briefly describes both the Croft and the Waters experiments. Section 5 describes the PLTEMP/ANL models. Section 6 compares the PLTEMP/ANL predictions based on the Whittle and Forgan formula with the Croft measurements. Section 7 does the same for the Waters measurements. Section 8 provides the range of parameters for the Whittle and Forgan tests. Section 9 discusses the results and provides conclusions. In conclusion, although there is no single test that by itself closely matches the limiting conditions in the MURR, the preponderance of measured data and the ability of the Whittle and Forgan correlation, as implemented in PLTEMP/ANL, to predict the onset of flow instability for these tests leads one to the conclusion that the same method should be able to predict the onset of flow instability in the MURR reasonably well...|$|R

40|$|Technical {{specifications}} {{of solid}} biofuels are continuously improved towards {{the development and}} promotion of their market. Efforts in the Greek market are limited, mainly due to the climate particularity of the region, which hinders the growth of suitable biofuels. Taking also into account the increased oil prices and the high inputs required to grow most annual crops in Greece, cardoon (Cynara cardunculus L.) is now considered {{the most important and}} promising sources for solid biofuel production in Greece in the immediate future. The reason is that cardoon is a perennial crop of Mediterranean origin, well adapted to the xerothermic conditions of southern Europe, which can be utilized particularly for solid biofuel production. This is due to its minimum production cost, as this perennial weed may perform high biomass productivity on most soils with modest or without any inputs of irrigation and agrochemicals. Within this framework, the present research work is focused on the planning and analysis of different land use scenarios involving this specific energy crop and the combustion behaviour characterization for the solid products. Such land use scenarios are based on quantitative estimates of the cropÃ¢Â€Â™s production potential under specific soil-climatic conditions as well as the inputs required for its realization in comparison to existing conventional crops. Concerning its decomposition behaviour, devolatilisation and char combustion tests were performed in a non-isothermal thermogravimetric analyser (TA Q 600).

For the coals with the fuel ratio ranging from 1. 36 to 6. 22, the experimental results indicated that the burnout increased with decreasing the fuel ratio, except for certain coals departing from the general trend. One of the coals with the fuel ratio of 6. 22 has shown its merit in combustion, implying that the blending ratio of the coal in PCI operation can be raised for a higher coke replacement ratio. The experiments also suggested that increasing blast temperature was an efficient countermeasure for promoting the combustibility of the injected coals. Higher <b>fuel</b> <b>burnout</b> could be achieved when the particle size of coal was reduced from 60 – 100 to 100 – 200 mesh.

40|$|The {{experimental}} research of propane co-fire {{of the wood}} fuel {{at different stages of}} the swirling flame flow formation has shown: At the primary stage of propane co-fire of the wood fuel increasing a rate of propane co-fire results in an increased rate of the flame temperature rise by enhancing the wood fuel gasification and burnout of the volatiles. Decreasing a height of the wood layer inside of gasifier promotes a gradual transition to the self-sustaining wood <b>fuel</b> <b>burnout,</b> while the propane co-fire provides complete burnout of the volatiles, increasing the rate of the heat production, flame temperature, combustion efficiency and volume fraction of CO 2 in the flame reaction zone. The more pronounced increase of combustion efficiency is detected along the airside part of the swirling flame flow, where the enhanced burnout of the volatiles results in correlating decrease of the air excess. The less pronounced variations are detected for the mass fraction of NOx, when co-firing of the wood fuel with propane flame flow results in slight decrease of the mass fraction of NOx in {{the central part of the}} flame reaction zone. Moreover, because of low-temperature staged combustion of the volatiles downstream of swirling flame flow, the peak value of the mass fraction of NOx does not exceed 800 - 100 ppm, indicating that the joint utilization of swirl-induced low temperature staged combustion and co-firing of the wood fuel with propane and wood fuel can be used as the tools for NOx reduction...|$|E
40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) The {{economic}} benefits of pulverised coal injection (PCI) into blast furnace include {{a reduction in the}} cost of hot metal, resulting primarily from decreased coke consumption and an increase in hot metal production. Since coal is consumed directly, without going through the cokemaking plant, PCI is also thought to be environmentally friendly. Therefore, PCI has become a standard practice in many blast furnaces worldwide. To improve the performance of PCI operation, a comprehensive understanding of pulverised coal combustion behaviours are required. The goal of this thesis was to study the coal burning characteristics in the regions of blowpipe, tuyere and raceway through both numerical and experimental methodology. From the validation of model, the calculation region and the application of calculated results in practice, the PCI combustion model was developed through 4 phases in this work: (1) validation of the coal combustion model by comparing its predictions with experimental data; (2) investigation into the influence of operation conditions to coal burnout in the regions of blowpipe and tuyere; (3) performance evaluation of coal blend injection in terms of pressure loss caused by combustion within a simplified raceway space; and (4) examination of combustion characteristics of oxy-coal injection technology in the regions of blowpipe, tuyere and raceway, which is a porous space featured by Eulerian-Eulerian multi-fluid approach. In the first phase, the performance of coal devolatilisation models and kinetic parameters were validated by comparing predicted gas temperature profiles with the experimental results of Burgess et al. (1983). It is found that the kinetic parameters proposed by Ubhayakar et al (1976) for the two competing devolatilisation model permit a reasonable simulation of the measured results for blast furnace conditions. The coal combustion in the regions of blowpipe and tuyere was modelled under the conditions of CSC’s N⁰ 3 blast furnace in the second phase. The influence of operation conditions to coal burnout was comprehensively studied. It is found early ignition can be achieved with higher coal burnout when the double lance is employed instead of the single one. Accordingly, the injection lance used at CSC was changed from the single to the double air-cooled coaxial lance arrangement in 2002. In the third phase, the calculation was extended to the raceway with simplified configuration. The performance of coal blend injection was examined. As indicated in the calculation results, a decrease in coal burnout is found with decreasing the coal volatile content, while the pressure loss within the raceway can be abated due to less volatile released to gas and moderate gas expansion in the combustion region. With improved permeability, more hot blast air can be introduced into the blast furnace for higher productivity. Consequently, the high volatile coal injection was replaced by the coal blend (mixtures of high and low volatile coals) injection at CSC in 2003. In the last phase, the Eulerian-Eulerian multi-fluid model was employed for the prediction of raceway configuration with consideration of coke combustion in all coke operation. Validation work against measured raceway shape and gas composition distribution by Nogami et al. (2005) indicates that the model is acceptable for the simulation. The calculation results show the oxy-coal lance injection enables to fulfil two contradictory conditions at the same time: (1) to retard the coal combustion for moderating the pressure loss in the upstream of coal plume; and (2) to enhance coal combustion and reduce unburnt char generation in the downstream of coal plume. Taking these advantages from the oxy-coal lance injection, blast furnaces can be operated with more blast for higher productivity, or with higher PCI rate for lower fuel cost, thereby achieving the goal of hot metal production with energy saving. In this work, a drop tube furnace has been established and used to provide fundamental insights on PCI coal combustion behaviours. The experiments were carried out in three stages. In the first stage, the volatile release and the generation of char particle and tiny aerosols in the region of coal plume were studied. Only the tested low volatile coal (HGI= 85) with larger size (100 - 200 mesh) exhibits fragmentation during heating. This may encourage the use of low volatile coals in granular coal injection. Significant char agglomeration is found for both tested high and low volatile coals with smaller size (200 - 325 mesh). It implies that excessive grinding may be avoided in PCI operation. Considering the generation of tiny aerosols composed of soot particles and tar droplets, it is mainly determined by the content of volatile matter and elemental oxygen. In the second stage, a technology has been developed and employed at CSC to evaluate the combustion efficiency of PCI coals. It is found that the coal burnout increases with decreasing the fuel ratio (FC/VM), except for certain coals departing from the general trend. It {{can be explained by the}} effect of maceral content to coal combustion. When the coal size is smaller than 200 mesh, the burnout can not be improved further, resulting from the agglomeration of fine particles. In the PCI operation at CSC, the coal quantity passing through 200 mesh has been reduced from 80 to 60 %. The experiments for the last stage aim to gain a fundamental insight into the combustion characteristics of pulverised biofuels under conditions pertinent to the raceway of blast furnace. From the van Krevelen diagram, it is found that the rate of hydrogen release from biomass fuels is faster than that of oxygen during the pre-treatment. An increase in pretreating temperature almost linearly decreases the burnout of biofuels. As revealed in the experimental results, the fuel properties, such as <b>fuel</b> ratio, <b>burnout,</b> and ignition temperature, of biomass torrefied at 300 °C or pyrolysed between 400 and 500 °C, are between a high-volatile bituminous coal and a low-volatile one. Therefore, the pretreated biomass can partially replace the coals consumed for PCI and blends with coals to keep reasonable burnout in raceways. It is emphasised that, due to the objectives of this thesis, some results or countermeasures obtained from the comprehensive experimental and numerical studies have been taken into PCI operation at CSC. This seems as a limitation of this study, but it may have a wide range of applications for the improvement of PCI operation...|$|R

The influence on the temperature by the flow of solids in {{the upper part of the}} bottom region is investigated. Heat and mass balances of gas and fuel were applied over a control volume containing the bottom region, i. e. both the bed and the adjacent splash zone. The mass balance is based on given input flow rates of gas and fuel and concentrations in the gas leaving the control volume. The measured gas concentrations were used to determine the rate of <b>fuel</b> <b>burnout</b> inside the control volume.

After a series of experiments where the different operating parameters were varied, the conclusions from 14 different flame investigations indicated that: The effects of swirl on the early ignition and the burnout improvement are intensified when increasing the momentum ratio between the secondary and the primary stream at the burner's outlet. On the specific burner configuration values of the a. m. momentum ratio higher than 1. 4 divided by 1. 5 lead to improved burnout conditions and to the reduction of the CO emission without increasing the NOx emissions. The successful scaling of the model burner with respect to the original is pro;ed from comparative measurements in the test facility and in the 150 MW(e) boiler. Concrete proposals were made for the industrial scale burner {{on the basis of these}} conclusions. The proposals were applied and tested successfully in a single burner and in all operating burners of a brown coal fired boiler in the Niederaussem power station...|$|E
40|$|A {{numerical}} model is developed to examine laminar flame spread and extinction over a thin solid fuel in lowspeed concurrent flows. The model {{provides a more}} precise fluid-mechanical description of the flame by incorporating an elliptic treatment of the upstream flame stabilization zone near the <b>fuel</b> <b>burnout</b> point. Parabolic equations are used to treat the downstream flame, which has a higher flow Reynolds number. The parabolic and elliptic regions are coupled smoothly by an appropriate matching of boundary conditions. The solid phase consists of an energy equation with surface radiative loss and a surface pyrolysis relation. Steady spread with constant flame and pyrolysis lengths is found possible for thin fuels and this facilitates {{the adoption of a}} moving coordinate system attached to the flame with the flame spread rate being an eigen value. Calculations are performed in purely forced flow in a range of velocities which are lower than those induced in a normal gravity buoyant environment. Both quenching and blowoff extinction are observed. The results show that as flow velocity or oxygen percentage is reduced, the flame spread rate, the pyrolysis length, and the flame length all decrease, as expected. The flame standoff distance from the solid and the reaction zone thickness, however, first increase with decreasing flow velocity, but eventually decrease very near the quenching extinction limit. The short, diffuse flames observed at low flow velocities and oxygen levels are consistent with available experimental data. The maximum flame temperature decreases slowly at first as flow velocity is reduced, then falls more steeply close to the quenching extinction limit. Low velocity quenching occurs as a result of heat loss. At low velocities, surface radiative loss becomes a significant fraction of the total combustion heat release. In addition, the shorter flame length causes an increase in the fraction of conduction downstream compared to conduction to the fuel. These heat losses lead to lower flame temperatures, and ultimately, extinction. This extinction mechanism differs from that of blowoff, where the flame is unable to be stabilized due to the high flow velocity...|$|E
40|$|Photo-chemical smog {{and acid}} rain formed from many {{pollutants}} including NOx are serious {{problems that have}} attracted much attention due to their negative influences on the atmosphere, plants, animals and even building materials. Effective measures of controlling NOx emissions are necessary. In this study, a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software, Ansys Fluent 14. 5, {{has been applied to}} research the processes of South American coal (SAm) reburning and cornstalk reburning. The influences of reburn zone excess air coefficient, reburning fuel fraction (Rff) and the secondary air temperature on the furnace combustion and NOx reduction have been determined. Results show that, in the simulated data range, the lower reburn zone excess air coefficient, the greater the rate of denitration for both SAm reburning and cornstalk reburning. The highest rates of denitration for SAm reburning and cornstalk reburning were 56. 15 % and 66. 89 %, respectively, in comparison to the conventional combustion. The denitration rate increases with the increase of reburning fuel fraction. However, when the reburning fuel fraction increases beyond a certain level, fuels within the furnace will undergo incomplete combustion. Under the premise of the <b>fuel</b> <b>burnout,</b> a relatively good case occurs at the reburning fuel fraction of 20 % for the two kinds of reburning, and the NOx removal rate is 60. 57 % for cornstalk reburning, which is 7. 61 % higher than that of the SAm reburning. Temperature also has certain influences on the denitration effect and it shows that, in the lower temperature range, the higher the temperature of the secondary air, the higher the denitration rate. However, as temperature reaches a certain value, the denitration effect is no longer enhanced but reduced. For the two kinds of reburning, the case with the secondary air at 500 K is a relatively good one, and the NOx removal rate reaches 66. 36 % for cornstalk reburning, while it is 55 % for SAm reburning. Overall, cornstalk reburning provides a higher NOx reduction rate in comparison to SAm reburning...|$|E
40|$|Lignite {{predrying}} and dry lignite firing {{is considered}} {{as an important}} development step {{for the next generation}} of lignite power plants. The integration of a predrying system in future lignite power plants, which utilizes low temperature steam for the drying process, combined with the further thermal utilization of lignite's evaporated moisture, may bring an efficiency increase of four to six percentage points compared with today's state of the art. Firing predried lignite is however expected to cause certain changes in the combustion behavior of large scale boilers. The investigation of these changes in an existing Greek utility boiler through experimental activities and numerical simulations is the scope of the present work. The investigations take place in a 75 MWth lignite fired Greek boiler. The specific unit is equipped with dedicated dry lignite burners. The measurements are performed with a dry lignite thermal share of 6 %. Higher cofiring thermal shares of up to 20 % are further simulated and the effect of cofiring on the combustion behavior is evaluated by specific parameters including temperature fields, wall heat flux, fuel's burnout, and NOx emissions. No clear effects of cofiring on boiler operation are observed during the experimental campaign indicating that the operational behavior in low cofiring shares remains constant. Some trends are observed in the simulations of the dry coal cofiring cases. Increased temperature peaks in the near burner region and higher furnace outlet temperatures are predicted. A clear increase of the total <b>fuel</b> <b>burnout</b> when firing dry coal is also foreseen by the simulations, which is a strong argument for the coutilization of dry lignite as a supportive fuel. The overall examinations imply that dry lignite cofiring for low thermal shares up to 20 % is feasible in the case of Greek boilers without major technological difficulties. For the realization of a lignite predrying concept in an existing Greek boiler however, a detailed study on each particular boiler is necessary. © 2010 American Chemical Society...|$|E
40|$|South Africa will {{continue}} to have a reliance on coal-fired power for the foreseeable future, given that coal is abundant, inexpensive and available. As much of the country’s good quality coal becomes depleted, the qualities available for power generation is fast declining. Therefore, pilot scale tests will be crucial in the development of methodologies for predicting coal performance in specific power plants. The main objective of this research is to validate the coal combustion performance of the Pilot Scale Combustion Test Facility (PSCTF) against four utility boilers to determine it’s scale up capabilities. Coal samples obtained from the operating feeders during each utility boiler test were evaluated at the PSCTF under conditions of similitude and at variations in excess air levels. This dissertation details the comparison of pulverized fuel (pf) burnout and gaseous emissions between the pilot facility and four coal-fired boilers of different configurations. The pilot furnace was able to simulate the pf burnout for the three full-scale wall-fired and the tangentially fired boilers at elevated excess air levels and under conditions of similitude respectively. The pilot carbon monoxide (CO) and sulphur dioxide (SO 2) emission results were simulated under conditions similitude for all four boilers. The quantitative determination of the pulverized <b>fuel</b> <b>burnout,</b> CO and SO 2 was found to be dependant on the boiler configuration (boiler size, burner type and burner arrangement) of the full-scale boiler which indicated the setup conditions at the PSCTF. The pilot furnace produces higher flame temperatures than the utility boilers which results in thermal NOx and inevitably significantly higher NOx emissions. The results emanating from this research has shown that the PSCTF is an effective tool for the evaluating and characterising coal combustion performance on a quantitative basis. Validation of more boilers is required to increase the degree of confidence in the PSCTF results and understanding the impact of the full-scale boiler configurations. All future validation tests should incorporate other pf combustion aspects. A quantitative methodology for the NOx emission should be further investigated...|$|E
40|$|More than 70 % of {{the total}} {{electricity}} production in Greece {{is based on the}} utilisation of soft brown coal of medium ash content (approximate to 15 %), high moisture (approximate to 58 %) and low calorific value (4. 5 - 5 MJ kg(- 1)). The increasing demand (twice the EC average) for electrical power imposes the need for the best exploitation of the existing brown-coal surface mines, together with new ones producing solid fuel of the same or even lower quality. This fact, combined with the high cost of the DeNO(x) /DeSO(2) facilities required when the conventional pulverised-fuel combustion technology is applied, implies a need for investigating the applicability to the particular coal quality of alternative coal-combustion technologies such as fluidised-bed combustion. This paper presents the results of combustion tests on Greek lignite in two CFBC (circulating fluidised bed combustor) facilities. The first, a laboratory-scale facility of approximately 100 kW thermal power, is at NTUA (the National Technical University of Athens); the second, which is of semi-industrial scale (1. 2 MW thermal power), is al RWE's power station at Niederaussem in Germany. The two installations are of different size and different design, and the concepts represent the major CFBC construction trends: the Niederaussem facility operates with a thermally insulated ('hot') cyclone, whereas the CFBC in Athens features a non-insulated ('cold') cyclone. The results reported in this paper include determination of the operating conditions to achieve proper <b>fuel</b> <b>burnout,</b> examination of the influence of air-staging on the temperature distribution inside the reactor, and investigation of the combustion behaviour of the particular fuel type in relation to the size of fuel particles. As regards pollutant emissions, the CO, SO 2, NOx and N 2 O emissions are recorded during Various test cases for both facilities. Particular interest applies to the examination of additives of various types in order to obtain the maximum SO 2 retention inside the reactor, because the fuel that was used has a high sulphur content (1. 5 %). Several conclusions are drawn concerning the necessary modifications and requirements of the plant layout when a large-scale CFBC installation is designed to burn low-grade brown coat. The air-staging, furnace cooling, reactor height and cyclone type are considered the critical parameters for proper ignition and burnout conditions. Note, however, that the results in-this paper are not exclusively of industrial interest: they also include documented experimental data from various test cases, which can be used for the evaluation of computational models aiming to simulate the combustion of coal in CFBCs...|$|E
40|$|The {{measurement}} of fine particulate in pulverized coal flames has several applications of importance. These include {{but are not}} limited to: (1) The detection of fine particulate in the effluent for pollution control; (2) The detection of soot and <b>fuel</b> <b>burnout</b> in real time within a boiler; and (3) The quantification of soot within coal flame for improved understanding of pulverized coal flame heat transfer and soot modeling. A method has been investigated using two-color extinction along a line of sight within the flame which provides a continuous real-time {{measurement of}} the soot concentration. The method uses two inexpensive HeNe lasers and simple light detectors. The results of testing the method on a pilot scale 0. 2 MW pulverized coal reactor demonstrate the method is working well in a qualitative sense and an error analysis performed on the uncertainty of the assumed values demonstrates the method to be accurate to within {+-} 30 %. Additional experiments designed to quantify the measurement more accurately are ongoing. Measurements {{at the end of the}} reactor just prior to the exit showed soot could not be detected until the overall equivalence ratio became greater than 1. 0. The detection limit for the method was estimated to be 1 x 10 {sup - 8 } soot volume fraction. Peak soot concentration was found to approach a level of 0. 88 x 10 {sup - 6 } at the sootiest condition. The method was used to obtain an axial profile of soot concentration aligned with the down-fired pulverized coal flame for three different flame swirls of 0, 0. 5 and 1. 5 and an overall equivalence ratio of 1. 2. The axial measurements showed the soot concentration to increase initially and level off to a constant maximum value. At 0. 5 swirl the soot volume fraction increased more rapidly near the burner and both the 0. 5 and 1. 5 swirl cases showed that soot had reached a maximum by 0. 9 m, but the 0 swirl soot concentration was still increasing. Previous measurements of species and velocity in the reactor suggest that the flame is lifted at zero swirl allowing O{sub 2 } to be entrained and that the flame protrudes further down the reactor explaining the lower soot values measured. An evaluation of the potential for using this measurement technique on full scale boilers suggests that attenuation of the signal across a larger boiler distance is the largest obstacle. The beam would be expected to become completely attenuated under moderate sooting conditions; however, the longer pathlength would improve the ability of the method to measure very small amounts of soot escaping the main combustion zone...|$|E
