The authors said the person holding the device would need to be capable of maintaining an active wide grasp throughout the process. They wrote that the Magic Wand was helpful for disabled people with either limited strength in their upper <b>extremities</b> or limited use of their hands. They also said it was well-suited for individuals with decreased movement in their upper <b>extremities.</b>|$|E
5|$|Ordinary {{smallpox}} generally {{produced a}} discrete rash, {{in which the}} pustules stood out on the skin separately. The distribution of the rash was densest on the face; denser on the <b>extremities</b> than on the trunk; and on the <b>extremities,</b> denser on the distal parts than on the proximal. The palms of the hands and soles of the feet {{were involved in the}} majority of cases. Sometimes, the blisters merged into sheets, forming a confluent rash, which began to detach the outer layers of skin from the underlying flesh. Patients with confluent smallpox often remained ill even after scabs have formed over all the lesions. In one case series, the case-fatality rate in confluent smallpox was 62 percent.|$|E

40|$|Background and Purpose—After stroke, 80 % of {{patients}} experience acute paresis {{of the upper}} <b>extremity</b> and only approximately one-third achieve full functional recovery. Predicting functional recovery for these patients is highly important to provide focused, cost-effective rehabilitation. Our purpose was to examine if early measures of upper <b>extremity</b> active range of motion (AROM) could predict recovery of upper <b>extremity</b> function, and to describe the trajectory of upper <b>extremity</b> AROM recovery over time. Methods—Thirty-three subjects were tested at 1 month and then at 3 months after stroke. Upper <b>extremity</b> function was measured with 6 standardized clinical tests that were synthesized into a single, sensitive score for upper <b>extremity</b> function using principal component analysis. The ability to move each segment (AROM) was measured using a 3 -dimensional electromagnetic tracking system. Results—Stepwise multiple regression revealed that AROM of the shoulder and middle finger segments taken at 1 month could predict 71 % {{of the variance in}} upper <b>extremity</b> function at 3 months. All segments of the upper <b>extremity</b> recover similarly and no evidence of a proximal to distal gradient in motor deficits appeared over time. Conclusions—Simple AROM measurements of the upper <b>extremity</b> taken within 1 month after stroke can be used to predict upper <b>extremity</b> function at 3 months. This information is important for determining the prognosis of upper <b>extremity</b> functional recovery. (Stroke. 2009; 40 : 1772 - 1779. ...|$|R

5|$|Because American {{football}} is a full-contact sport, head injuries are relatively common. According to the San Francisco Spine Institute at Seton Medical Center in Daly City, California, up to 1.5 million young men participate in football annually, {{and there are}} an estimated 1.2 million football-related injuries per year. An estimated 51% of injuries occur during training sessions, while 49% occur elsewhere. Injuries are nearly 5 times more likely to happen during contact training sessions than in controlled, non-contact sessions. Older players are at the most risk for injuries, while teams with experienced coaches and more assistant coaches are less likely to experience injuries. Fifty percent of injuries occur in the lower <b>extremities</b> (with knee injuries alone counting for roughly 36% of all injuries) and 30% occur in the upper <b>extremities.</b>|$|E

5|$|Smallpox virus {{preferentially}} attacks skin cells, {{causing the}} characteristic pimples (called macules) {{associated with the}} disease. A rash develops on the skin 24 to 48 hours after lesions on the mucous membranes appear. Typically the macules first appear on the forehead, then rapidly spread to the whole face, proximal portions of <b>extremities,</b> the trunk, and lastly to distal portions of <b>extremities.</b> The process takes no more than 24 to 36 hours, after which no new lesions appear. At this point variola major infection can take several very different courses, resulting in four types of smallpox disease based on the Rao classification: ordinary, modified, malignant (or flat), and hemorrhagic. Historically, smallpox has an overall fatality rate of about 30 percent; however, the malignant and hemorrhagic forms are usually fatal.|$|E

40|$|Objective: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the correlation between lower <b>extremity</b> muscle strength and balance in Multiple Sclerosis (MS). Methods: Balance of 60 people with MS (expanded disability status scale < 4. 5) and 30 healthy subjects was assessed by clinical tests of standing balance (tandem stance, single leg stance, functional reach, step test). Lower <b>extremity</b> muscle strength for 10 muscle groups was measured with classical manual muscle test. Results: There was a weak correlation between lower <b>extremity</b> muscle strength and the Functional Reach Test: from r= 0. 06 to r= 0. 50, p< 0. 05 for the impaired lower <b>extremity.</b> The step test was correlated with muscle strength for the impaired lower <b>extremity</b> (r= 0. 30 and r= 0. 39, p< 0. 05). The correlation between lower <b>extremity</b> muscle strength and the tandem stance was from r= 0. 20 to r= 0. 47, p< 0. 05 for the impaired lower <b>extremity.</b> In the impaired lower <b>extremity</b> there was poor correlation between single leg stance and muscle strength (r= 0. 19 to r= 0. 40,p< 0. 5).
