Growing up, Greenwald {{had no plans to}} be a wrestler, but she was {{interested}} in appearing on American Gladiators. She trained to be a powerlifter from age 14 to age 18, and at age 14, she broke the Minnesota state powerlifting record (75pounds) <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>age</b> group by lifting 100pounds. She also trained as a gymnast. Later, she began wrestling for fun, not because she wanted to be on TV.|$|E
5|$|During {{her career}} Danton {{was sent to}} Great Britain to honor the {{coronation}} of George V, and later served in World War I as an escort for supply ships and troop transports, guarding them from elements of the German Navy. While en route to aid a blockade, she was torpedoed and sunk on 19 March 1917 by a German U-boat, leaving 296 men dead. The location of the wreck remained a mystery until an underwater survey team inadvertently discovered the battleship in December 2007. In February 2009, the wreck was confirmed to be Danton. The ship is in remarkably good shape <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>age.</b> Danton rests upright on the ocean floor, {{and most of the}} original equipment is reported to be intact.|$|E
5|$|Living in Bendigo and {{studying}} at Camp Hill Primary School, Leech could only travel {{three times a}} year to train with Froelich, so she relied heavily on dry land simulations, such as a pulley attached to the kitchen door. When she was 12, she covered 110 yards in 1 minute (min) 7.1 seconds, setting an unofficial world record <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>age</b> group. This achievement prompted her parents to rent an apartment in Melbourne, so she could train with Froelich on a regular basis. Leech moved there with her mother, while her father stayed in Bendigo to look after the family's jewellery business.|$|E

50|$|Lucy Martin A {{young woman}} who chose to marry a repulsive suitor rather than wait <b>for</b> <b>her</b> true love, to provide <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>ageing</b> mother. <b>Her</b> devotion to her mother almost leads to her being left behind in England after the exile.|$|R
5|$|The {{starship}} USS Enterprise {{arrives at}} planet M-113 to provide medical exams for Professor Robert Crater (Alfred Ryder) {{and his wife}} Nancy (Jeanne Bal), who operate a research station there. Captain James T. Kirk (William Shatner), Chief Medical Officer Dr. Leonard McCoy (DeForest Kelley), and Crewman Darnell (Michael Zaslow) transport to the surface as Kirk teases McCoy about his affection for Nancy Crater ten years earlier. They arrive in the research station, {{and each of the}} three men see Nancy differently: McCoy as she was when he first met her, Kirk as she should look accounting <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>age,</b> and Darnell as a totally different, attractive younger woman. Kirk sends the dazed Darnell outside; when Nancy goes out to fetch her husband, she beckons Darnell to follow her.|$|E
5|$|Hikari Konohana, a shy {{and quiet}} girl, {{is the main}} focus among the main {{characters}} who attend Spica. The next Spica character is Yaya Nanto, a rebellious girl who is Hikari's best friend and roommate in the dormitory. In the anime, she is very much enamored with Hikari, but Hikari sees her as a friend; in the manga, Yaya is not a prominent character. Both she and Hikari {{are members of the}} St. Spica Choir. Hikari meets an older girl named Amane Ohtori early on in the story who is seen much like a prince from a fairy tale by other Spica students due to often riding a white horse named Star Bright. Amane is admired by many of the students from Spica as well as students from the other two schools, although she does not enjoy the attention. In the anime, Hikari admires her deeply, and she and Amane have mutual interest in each other. The final girl from Spica is Tsubomi Okuwaka, a young first year student who acts maturely <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>age</b> and gets on Yaya's nerves. She too is in the St. Spica Choir, although Hikari was her main motivation for joining. In the anime, her interest in Hikari seems to purely be one of friendship; in the manga, she, like Yaya, is not a prominent character. Tsubomi once remarked that Yaya was more skilled than Hikari at singing in the choir.|$|E

25|$|Luciana is Giovanni's {{youngest}} daughter, out of four. At {{thirteen years}} old, {{she is a}} very spoiled child. She returns early from her convent school to find that her father has taken Erik on as an apprentice. Entranced by the young Erik's air of mystery, Luciana takes an instant liking to him, but seems unable to express her feelings for him, so she teases and torments him. Erik is attracted to her as well as she is particularly beautiful <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>age.</b> Eventually, she requests that Giovanni remove Erik's mask, and after she has seen his ugliness, she runs away, falling from a section of crumbling roof of their two story house and dying a grotesquely violent end.|$|E

25|$|Stewart {{was born}} in Syracuse, New York, to Brian and Heather Stewart and has a younger brother named Connor. Breanna began playing {{basketball}} at an early age; in fifth grade, she decided to improve her game. Now six feet four inches tall, {{she had always been}} tall <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>age,</b> which often meant coaches wanted her inside as a rebounder. However, her father thought it would help if she had ball handling skills and a perimeter shooting ability. Stewart started a routine of dribbling around her block, wearing headphones. She completed enough loops to cover a mile. She continued the routine almost every day, improving her ball handling to the point she routinely dribbled behind her back or between her legs. Even after heading off to college, she still did the routine at home.|$|E

500|$|Born in Detroit, Michigan, Hill {{grew up in}} Fullerton, California. She is {{the fifth}} of seven children; {{her mother was a}} dental {{hygienist}} and her father an aerospace engineer. She was an active child who climbed everything from trees to street lights. Starting at age eight, she learned gymnastics but disliked the way girls [...] "had to smile and do cutesy little routines on the floor". Thus, even though she was part of a successful YMCA gymnastics team that competed in southern California and performed in halftime shows for the California Angels, she quit at the age of 12. In her autobiography, Hill describes feeling [...] "resistant to rules", an attitude she identified as both normal <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>age</b> and influenced by the era in which she grew up: [...] "My awareness of issues like women's rights and the struggle for racial freedom began to grow". She even questioned the chores assigned in her family, noting the differences between the boys and girlsâ€”the boys had weekly tasks while the girls had daily tasks. During high school, Hill took up gymnastics again and became one of the top gymnasts in her state, a skill that eventually contributed to her climbing success. In particular, the ability to conceptualize a series of complex movements as small, distinct ones and to thrive under pressure gave Hill a significant edge.|$|E
500|$|Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic commented, [...] "If 2001's Britney was a {{transitional}} album, capturing Spears {{at the point}} when she wasn't a girl and not yet a woman, its 2003 follow-up, In the Zone, is where she has finally completed that journey and turned into Britney, the Adult Woman." [...] Erlewine compared Spears to her peer Christina Aguilera, explaining that both equated maturity with transparent sexuality and the pounding sounds of nightclubs, but while Aguilera [...] "comes across like a natural-born skank, Britney is {{the girl next door}} cutting loose at college, drinking and smoking and dancing and sexing just a little too recklessly, since {{this is the first time}} she can indulge herself." [...] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine stated, [...] "For a girl who's always seemed too sexed-up <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>age,</b> In the Zone finds Britney finally filling her britches, so-to-speak. Her little girl coquettishness actually works nowâ€”maybe because, at 21, she's finally a woman." [...] Jason King of Vibe said the album showcased a transformed Spears, [...] "no longer a girl, and all the woman any man can handle." [...] In 2009, Amy Schriefer of NPR listed the album on The 50 Most Important Recordings of the Decade list. Calling it [...] "a primer on the sound of pop in the '00s", she deemed Spears as the ideal vehicle for a futuristic sound, since she was still trying to break away from her teen pop past. Schriefer praised [...] "Toxic" [...] and [...] "Everytime", and also stated, [...] "While the decade's history of celebrity obsession, paparazzi voyeurism and conflicted constructions of female sexuality and motherhood are written on Spears' body, the decade's history of impeccably crafted pop is written on her body of work." ...|$|E
2500|$|Gervase Elwes {{introduced}} her Paul Verlaine songs to the English concert stage in 1912 at the Queen's Hall. These songs {{then had a}} great vogue in Paris and this performance made a deep impression. He had been impressed with her music ever since he had first encountered it almost 20 years earlier, in 1893 in Brussels. He felt they showed [...] "great originality and <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>age,</b> great finish". Elwes encountered her again in 1903, in Brussels, and she dedicated two of her songs to him. A concert of her songs she was to have given in the United States with Gervase Elwes in 1921 had to be cancelled {{when he was killed}} in a rail accident in Boston.|$|E

2500|$|While {{reviewing}} the secret footage, Stacy and Clinton would comment, in sometimes caustic style, {{on why the}} nominee's wardrobe was unflattering ("mom jeans") or out-dated (purchased in the 1980s) and they would usually meet with the nominators before meeting the nominee. Afterward, the entire group would go to meet the soon-to-be-surprised nominee. During the surprise visit, the nominee was offered a $5,000 Visa debit card (in later seasons, the card was an unbranded $5,000 gift card) {{for the purpose of}} buying a new wardrobe if she would turn over her entire existing wardrobe to Stacy and Clinton and shop by their [...] "rules" [...] (shopping guidelines tailored <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>age,</b> body shape, and profession). If the nominee accepted the terms of the offer then Stacy and Clinton would give them the gift card and review the secret footage with them. If she declined, nothing further is filmed and there is no show. Nominees were sometimes very reluctant to agree and had to be persuaded by Stacy and Clinton and the nominators.|$|E
