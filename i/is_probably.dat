5|$|Around 11 {{metric tons}} of {{plutonium}} may be possessed by Japan alone, with 36 tons pending return after reprocessing in Britain and France. This <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> enough to make 6,000 atomic bombs.|$|E
5|$|As {{argued in}} a recent study by Richard et al. however, the name Morchella importuna <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> a later synonym of an old European taxon, such as Morchella elata, Morchella vaporaria or Morchella hortensis.|$|E
5|$|Birds {{in central}} California of the {{subspecies}} propinquus {{are considered to}} be still increasing their range, and this <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> the case elsewhere in the U.S.A.|$|E
50|$|Putney <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> settled {{during the}} Roman occupation. Lower Richmond Road <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> a Roman Road, and the Lower Common <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> an open pasture and farmland.|$|R
50|$|The adult moths <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> nocturnal as <b>are</b> most noctuoids. The larvae <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> foliage eaters but are {{not known}} as an {{agricultural}} pest.|$|R
50|$|The castle <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> built {{during the}} Celtic period as a refuge castle. The present burgstall only {{consists}} of two hollows between which the castle <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> located.|$|R
5|$|Gliese 581d <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> too massive to be {{made only}} of rocky material. It may have {{originally}} formed on a more distant orbit as an icy planet that then migrated closer to its star.|$|E
5|$|In consequence, the West {{section of}} the Notitia does not {{accurately}} represent the western army structure as it stood in 395 (for which the eastern structure <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> a better guide).|$|E
5|$|In the past, astronomers {{once thought}} the rings formed {{alongside}} the planet when it formed {{billions of years}} ago. Instead, the age of these planetary rings <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> some {{hundreds of millions of}} years.|$|E
50|$|The initial herbivorous mesozooplankton <b>were</b> <b>probably</b> larvae of benthic (seafloor) animals. A {{larval stage}} <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> an {{evolutionary}} innovation {{driven by the}} increasing level of predation at the seafloor during the Ediacaran period.|$|R
25|$|In a 2012 interview, David X. Cohen {{said that}} this <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> {{the first time that}} a {{mathematical}} theorem was proved in a television script, and that it <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> Futuramas proudest mathematical moment.|$|R
50|$|Rimini <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> evangelized from Ravenna. Among its {{traditional}} martyrs are: St. Innocentia and companions; Saints Juventinus, Facundinus, and companions; Saints Theodorus and Marinus. The see <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> established before {{the peace of}} Constantine.|$|R
5|$|In {{visible and}} {{near-infrared}} light, the rings have a reddish color, except the halo ring, which is neutral or blue in color. The {{size of the}} dust in the rings varies, but the cross-sectional area is greatest for nonspherical particles of radius about 15 μm in all rings except the halo. The halo ring <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> dominated by submicrometre dust. The total mass of the ring system (including unresolved parent bodies) is poorly known, but <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> {{in the range of}} 1011to 1016kg. The age of the ring system is not known, but it may have existed since the formation of Jupiter.|$|E
5|$|Little {{has been}} {{published}} on the ecology of B.oligantha. Its lifespan <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> around 10 to 30 years.|$|E
5|$|Nothing {{is known}} about the {{internal}} structure of Puck. It <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> made of a mixture of water ice with the dark material similar to that found in the rings. This dark material <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> made of rocks or radiation-processed organics. The absence of craters with bright rays implies that Puck is not differentiated, meaning that ice and non-ice components have not separated from each other into a core and mantle.|$|E
50|$|Chapters 46-51: six chaptersof which chapter 51, {{including}} {{even its}} title, has been lostthat contain stories and dialogues about Mozi and his followers. These chapters <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> of somewhat later date, and <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> partly fictional.|$|R
50|$|Sulpicianus <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> {{born in the}} Cretan town of Hierapytna {{around the}} year 137. A senator, he <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> the son of Flavius Titianus, who was the equestrian Prefect of Egypt under the Roman Emperor Hadrian.|$|R
50|$|The {{church has}} two bells, both quite small. The treble bell is very ancient and <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> {{cast in the}} 14th century. The tenor bell is not so old and <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> recast in the 17th century.|$|R
5|$|Serbia: The {{species was}} {{reported}} {{on the basis of}} three specimens shortly before 2009, but <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> rare.|$|E
5|$|Several {{congenital}} {{conditions may}} {{increase the risk of}} leukemia; the most common <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> Down syndrome, which is associated with a 10- to 18-fold increase in the risk of AML.|$|E
5|$|Status stage: Dummy IN or OUT transaction, which <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> for {{indicating}} {{the end of}} a control transfer exchange.|$|E
50|$|The {{date and}} place of the text's origin are not certain. It <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> {{composed}} around 1400 CE. It {{appears to have been}} composed to please a Chauhan (Chahamana) ruler, and <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> composed at a court.|$|R
50|$|The {{unconstrained}} compositional {{methods that}} Josquin employed in writing this mass foreshadowed what <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> his next work, the Missa Pange lingua, {{which was an}} extended fantasy on a plainsong, and which <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> his last mass.|$|R
50|$|All naraoids <b>were</b> <b>probably</b> marine bottom dwellers. P. hammanni {{lived in}} an {{environment}} that <b>was</b> most <b>probably</b> poor in oxygen.|$|R
5|$|Thailand's {{habitats}} are contiguous {{with those}} of neighbouring countries, so it has few endemic birds. The white-eyed river martin, known only from its single wintering site in Thailand, <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> extinct.|$|E
5|$|The {{parent of}} Cairanoolithus <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> {{some kind of}} non-ornithopod ornithischian, {{possibly}} the nodosaurid Struthiosaurus.|$|E
5|$|The {{plates were}} paired {{in a double}} row along the back. This <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> the most common {{arrangement}} in illustrations, especially earlier ones. The Stegosaurus in the 1933 film, King Kong, has this arrangement.|$|E
50|$|The Late Roman army (or East Roman {{army for}} the east) often {{recruited}} non-Roman soldiers into regular military units, {{as well as}} separate allied contingents (of laeti and foederati). Most soldiers <b>were</b> <b>probably</b> Romans, many <b>were</b> <b>probably</b> non-Roman.|$|R
50|$|The iwan (eyvān) and porch <b>were</b> <b>probably</b> erected {{shortly after}} 1316 as a shrine for Amu Abdollah Soqla, a hermit buried here. The brick minarets were {{constructed}} later, and <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> of Safavid dynasty era origin (c. 15th-17th centuries).|$|R
5000|$|The columns <b>were</b> <b>probably</b> quarried in {{the fourth}} century in Egypt, and {{thereafter}} probably stood in a Roman building. They <b>were</b> <b>probably</b> erected in Essenbæk Abbey when it was built, and then probably got new capitals from Denmark added.|$|R
5|$|A 2013 review {{said that}} there is enough {{suggestion}} of potential benefit from ketogenic diets in cancer therapy that establishing clinical trials <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> warranted. At present the only evidence of benefit is anecdotal, but designing effective trials to measure the effect of adopting a ketogenic diet could prove challenging.|$|E
5|$|A small insectivorous bird, it {{is subject}} to {{predation}} by mammals, such as cats and mustelids, and birds, particularly hawks of the genus Accipiter. Its large range and population mean that its status is secure, although one subspecies <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> extinct.|$|E
5|$|A. b. major (Blyth, 1869) : Known as {{the western}} hartebeest. Formerly {{occurred}} widely in Mali, Niger, Senegal, Gambia, Guinea-Bissau, Guinea, Ivory Coast, Ghana, Nigeria, southwestern Chad, Cameroon, western Central African Republic and Benin. Nowadays {{it occurs in}} much lower numbers mainly in protected areas of these countries. It <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> extinct in Gambia.|$|E
50|$|Anomochilids <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> fossorial.|$|R
50|$|There is a one-story, three-room {{building}} of similar construction {{at the rear}} of the property that <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> built around the same time as the main house. This <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> used as a guest house for visiting civil rights workers.|$|R
50|$|Teruelictis riparius is an extinct {{mammalian}} carnivoran, {{belonging to}} the family Mustelidae and <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> related to otters. The animal lived in the Upper Miocene and its fossils {{have been found in}} Spain. The animal <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> a terrestrial predator.|$|R
