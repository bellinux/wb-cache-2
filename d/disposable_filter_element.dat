The experimental work was conducted directly in an underground environment using a unique diesel laboratory developed in an underground experimental mine. The DPF systems reduced total mass of aerosols in the mine air approximately 10 -fold for light-load and 20 -fold or more for high-load test conditions. The DFEs offered similar reductions in aerosol mass concentrations. The efficiency of the new DFEs significantly increased with accumulation of operating time and buildup of diesel particulate matter in the porous structure of the <b>filter</b> <b>elements.</b> A single laundering process did not exhibit substantial effects on performance of the <b>filter</b> <b>element.</b> The effectiveness of DPFs and DFEs in removing aerosols by number was strongly influenced by engine operating mode. The concentrations of nucleation mode aerosols in the mine air were found to be substantially higher for both DPFs and DFEs when the engine was operated at high-load modes than at low-load modes. The effects of the DOC on mass and number concentrations of aerosols in mine air were relatively minor when compared to those of the DPF and DFE systems...|$|R

The 20 % and 50 % soy biodiesel blends reduced EC by 49 % and 66 %, respectively. The reductions were slightly less pronounced for the 20 % and 50 % yellow grease biodiesel blends- 33 % and 56 %, respectively. EC concentrations were unaffected by using ultralow sulfur diesel in place of # 1 diesel. Use of the reformulated fuels did not substantially alter the concentrations of nitric oxide and carbon monoxide. However, a measurable increase in the nitrogen dioxide (NO 2) peak concentration was observed during the biodiesel tests. The ArvinMeritor (AM) fuel-burner DPF system with a palladium-catalyzed DOC reduced EC concentrations by 92 %. The diesel <b>filter</b> <b>elements</b> from Donaldson Co., Inc., and Filter Service & Testing Corp. reduced the EC concentration of the mine air by 92 % and 70 %, respectively. When the palladium-based DOC was used with the AM DPF, it raised the average and peak downstream NO 2 concentrations by a factor of three. Tests of the AM DPF system with a platinum-catalyzed DOC and CAP/ETG catalytic particulate oxidizer system had to be terminated because the elevated NO 2 concentrations threatened to overexpose the operator. The tests with only a selected DOC also resulted in increased NO 2 concentrations in mine air. " - NIOSHTIC- 2 by Aleksandar D. Bugarski, George H. Schnakenberg, Jr., Steven E. Mischler, James D.

40|$|A {{series of}} engine/dynamometer tests was {{conducted}} to assess the effects of three types of uncatalyzed diesel particulate filters (DPFs), a diesel oxidation catalytic converter (DOC) and three types of high temperature <b>disposable</b> <b>filter</b> <b>elements</b> (HT DFEs) on the concentrations and size distribution of diesel aerosols and concentration of nitric oxides in underground mine air. Tests were conducted in the NIOSH Diesel Laboratory at the Lake Lynn Laboratory experimental mine, a facility developed to allow evaluation {{of these and other}} control technologies directly in an underground environment. The aforementioned technologies are evaluated by comparing the aerosol and gas measurements in the mine air 60 m downstream of the exhaust from a naturally aspirated, mechanically controlled engine fitted with the tested systems or muffler and operated at four steady-state engine speed and power modes. The tested DPF and HT DFE systems caused a 10 -fold reduction in total mass concentrations of aerosols. The size distribution and number concentration measurements showed that all tested DPF systems and HT DFE elements effectively removed accumulation mode aerosols (D 50 > 30 nm) for all test modes. An increase in peak number concentrations of nucleation mode (D 50 > 30 nm) diesel aerosols is evident for some of tested DPF systems when engine was operated at high-load modes. The effects of uncatalyzed DPFs on nitric oxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO 2) concentrations are found to be minor. A four-fold increase in percentages of NO 2 in total nitrogen oxides (NOx) over baseline case was observed for the DOC when the engine was operated at high-load modes. The findings from this study should contribute to better understanding the potential for various control technologies to reduce exposure of underground miners to nano and ultrafine aerosols. In addition, detailed physical characterization of diesel aerosols made directly in occupational setting should foster {{a better understanding of the}} health risks associated with exposure to nano and ultrafine diesel aerosols...|$|R

40|$|Two advanced, hot gas, {{barrier filter}} system {{concepts}} {{have been proposed}} by the Siemens Westinghouse Power Corporation to improve the reliability and availability of barrier filter systems in applications such as PFBC and IGCC power generation. The two hot gas, barrier filter system concepts, the inverted candle filter system and the sheet filter system, were the focus of bench-scale testing, data evaluations, and commercial cost evaluations to assess their feasibility as viable barrier filter systems. The program {{results show that the}} inverted candle filter system has high potential to be a highly reliable, commercially successful, hot gas, barrier filter system. Some types of thin-walled, standard candle <b>filter</b> <b>elements</b> can be used directly as inverted candle <b>filter</b> <b>elements,</b> {{and the development of a}} new type of <b>filter</b> <b>element</b> is not a requirement of this technology. Six types of inverted candle <b>filter</b> <b>elements</b> were procured and assessed in the program in cold flow and high-temperature test campaigns. The thin-walled McDermott 610 CFCC inverted candle <b>filter</b> <b>elements,</b> and the thin-walled Pall iron aluminide inverted candle <b>filter</b> <b>elements</b> are the best candidates for demonstration of the technology. Although the capital cost of the inverted candle filter system is estimated to range from about 0 to 15 % greater than the capital cost of the standard candle filter system, the operating cost and life-cycle cost of the inverted candle filter system is expected to be superior to that of the standard candle filter system. Improved hot gas, barrier filter system availability will result in improved overall power plant economics. The inverted candle filter system is recommended for continued development through larger-scale testing in a coal-fueled test facility, and inverted candle containment equipment has been fabricated and shipped to a gasifier development site for potential future testing. Two types of sheet <b>filter</b> <b>elements</b> were procured and assessed in the program through cold flow and high-temperature testing. The Blasch, mullite-bonded alumina sheet <b>filter</b> <b>element</b> is the only candidate currently approaching qualification for demonstration, although this oxide-based, monolithic sheet <b>filter</b> <b>element</b> may be restricted to operating temperatures of 538 C (1000 F) or less. Many other types of ceramic and intermetallic sheet <b>filter</b> <b>elements</b> could be fabricated. The estimated capital cost of the sheet filter system is comparable to the capital cost of the standard candle filter system, although this cost estimate is very uncertain because the commercial price of sheet <b>filter</b> <b>element</b> manufacturing has not been established. The development of the sheet filter system could result in a higher reliability and availability than the standard candle filter system, but not as high as that of the inverted candle filter system. The sheet filter system has not reached the same level of development as the inverted candle filter system, and it will require more design development, <b>filter</b> <b>element</b> fabrication development, small-scale testing and evaluation before larger-scale testing could be recommended...|$|R
