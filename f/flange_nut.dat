50|$|The flange {{nuts are}} {{sometimes}} {{provided with a}} swivel flange which helps in creating a more stable structure without affecting finished product like a serrated <b>flange</b> <b>nut.</b> Swivel flange nuts are mostly used in joining wood and plastic. Sometimes both faces of the nut are serrated, permitting either side to lock.|$|E
50|$|A <b>flange</b> <b>nut</b> is a nut {{that has}} a wide flange at one end that acts as an integrated, {{non-spinning}} washer. This serves to distribute {{the pressure of the}} nut over the part being secured, reducing the chance of damage to the part and making it less likely to loosen {{as a result of an}} uneven fastening surface. These nuts are mostly hexagonal in shape and are made up of hardened steel and often coated with zinc.|$|E
50|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} types of speed nuts, mostly dependent on the shape of the nut, how it attaches to the workpiece, and what type of screw can be used. Most types are designed for either machine screws or sheet metal screws. Some nuts do not attach to the workpiece. These are usually shaped as either a rectangle, a <b>flange</b> <b>nut,</b> or a hex nut; the rectangular speed nut is also known as a flat-style speed nut. Speed nuts that attach to the workpiece usually are some form of a J-nut or U-nut.|$|E
40|$|Performance of air {{operated}} valves {{is a major}} maintenance concern in process industries. Anecdotal information indicates that reliability of some high maintenance valves has been improved by using an ion deposition process to achieve engineered surfaces on selected components. This project compared friction for various surface treatments of selected valve components. Results indicate valve performance may be slightly more consistent when an engineered surface is applied in the valve packing area; however surface treatment in this area {{does not appear to}} have a dominant affect on reducing valve friction. Results indicate a linear relation between stem friction and torque applied to packing <b>flange</b> <b>nuts,</b> and even after a valve is in service, controlled packing adjustments can be made without significantly changing valve stroke time...|$|R
5000|$|Tank {{connectors}} {{typically have}} a <b>flange</b> and a <b>nut,</b> although some have two nuts. Those with two nuts usually require some silicone or other sealant to prevent fluid passing along the threads.|$|R
40|$|Flange {{connections}} are {{type of connections}} frequently used in industry. There are hight claims for their dimensioning, strength and tightness. The proper and exact design {{can be made by}} calculation or by choice of standardized components (<b>flanges,</b> bolts, <b>nuts</b> etc.) accordig to requirements established by standart. This Bachelor´s thesis occupies itself with qualitative comparison of proposals for the strength design of flanged conections according to ČSN EN 13445, AD 2000 Merkblatt and ASME Code standarts. The programming language called Python is used in this Bachelor´s thesis...|$|R
5000|$|Tank Connectors {{are widely}} made of Plastic (PVC) or Brass, in many continents this {{connectors}} are {{also known as}} tank nipple as it has male threads, Tank connectors have a flange either {{on the edge of}} one side or in center to be jammed with tank wall, This connectors are also supplemented with rubber washer and sometime plastic washer with hexagonal <b>flange</b> <b>nut,</b> to tighten the connector with the tank wall. The size range of the connector varies from 1/2" [...] to 4", or the equivalent metric sizes, the size is denoted in the internal diameter of the connectors.|$|E
40|$|Cold forging {{has played}} a {{critical}} role in fasteners and has been widely used in automotive production, manufacturing, aviation and 3 C (Computer, Communication, and Consumer electronics). Despite its extensive use in fastener forming and die design, operator experience and trial and error make it subjective and unreliable owing to the difficulty of controlling the development schedule. This study used finite element analysis to establish and simulate wear in automotive repair fastener manufacturing dies based on actual process conditions. The places on a die that wore most quickly were forecast, with the stress levels obtained being substituted into the Archard equation to calculate die wear. A 19. 87 % improvement in wear optimization occurred by applying the Taguchi quality method to the new design. Additionally, a comparison of actual manufacturing data to simulations revealed a nut forging size error within 2 %, thereby demonstrating the accuracy of this theoretical analysis. Finally, SEM micrographs of the worn surfaces on the upper punch indicate that the primary wear mechanism on the cold forging die for long hex <b>flange</b> <b>nuts</b> was adhesive wear. The results can simplify the development schedule, reduce the number of trials and further enhance production quality and die life...|$|R

5000|$|Wheels {{sometimes}} need replacing. The grinder is unplugged, {{and then}} the outer guard is removed. Typically a large nut holds the wheel on the arbor. The handedness (sense) of each nut is assigned to avoid any loosening tendency during grinder use. Thus on a typical grinder the nut is left-handed {{on the left side}} of the grinder from the operator's viewpoint, with wheel rotation [...] "toward" [...] the operator (if the wheel could travel), whereas on the other side the nut is right-handed. [...] "In other words, to remove the nut, it must be turned in the direction that the spindle revolves when the wheel is in operation." [...] Holding the wheel against the wrench's turning action is difficult, but usually the wrench is gently tapped with a hammer instead, which neatly taps the nut loose. A large steel flange is on either side of the wheel, then a paper washer (blotter), then the wheel. The paper is conventionally held to be absolutely necessary to prevent the steel flange from bearing directly against the wheel and tending to crack it; trained workers are expected to know and obey this rule. Thus the entire contact area between flange and wheel is covered, either with paper or with compressible coating (rubber or gasket) on the flange. The wheel's inner diameter may meet the arbor precisely or may be larger with a bushing (sleeve) to reduce it. Before the new wheel is mounted it is ring tested, which involves gently tapping it with a fingernail or tool handle (wood or plastic) to hear its high-pitched ring (comparable to a bell's ring, although not loud), indicating that it is not cracked. It is rung in various spots to be sure. A [...] "flat" [...] or [...] "hoarse" [...] sound (failing to [...] "sing") indicates a crack. With the wheel having passed the ring test, the bushing (if any), wheel, paper blotters, steel <b>flanges,</b> and <b>nut</b> are assembled, and the nut is tightened, not as hard as possible, but enough to be firmly fastened in place. The guard is reinstalled, {{and then the}} grinder can be plugged in again. Dressing may be needed afterward. When the wheel is first started, the operator stands a bit off center, so that if it were to explode, less pathway for injury exists.|$|R
