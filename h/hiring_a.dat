5|$|Dunder Mifflin's Scranton {{branch is}} {{planning}} a going-away party for Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) before he leaves for Costa Rica. Michael Scott (Steve Carell) is extremely happy that Toby is leaving, but when Angela Martin (Angela Kinsey) balks at his unreasonable party demands, Phyllis Vance (Phyllis Smith) accepts the duty of planning the party. She does fantastically, ordering carnival rides and <b>hiring</b> <b>a</b> band.|$|E
5|$|In the episode, the {{employees}} {{from the office}} prepare for Phyllis Lapin's (Phyllis Smith) wedding. Michael Scott (Steve Carell), acting under advice from Todd Packer (David Koechner), instructs Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) to hire a stripper {{for the men and}} delegates Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) to hire one for the women. While Dwight hires a stripper, Jim ends up <b>hiring</b> <b>a</b> Ben Franklin impersonator (Andy Daly) instead.|$|E
5|$|Jokes {{from earlier}} scripts were used. In one scene, Carla Tortelli orders a phone caller to do {{something}} about their unruly children. When one of the bartenders suggests <b>hiring</b> <b>a</b> babysitter, Carla replied that the caller was the babysitter. The cast did not know the ending of the pilot episode during production, since the final draft of the script was dated April 16, 1982.|$|E

40|$|Abstract : We {{consider}} delegation in a rent-seeking {{contest with}} two players, where delegates have more instruments {{at their disposal}} than the main players. We endogenize both the decision to <b>hire</b> <b>a</b> delegate and the contingent fee offered to the delegates. We characterize the situations when either no, one or two players <b>hire</b> <b>a</b> delegate in equilibrium. We show {{that the decision to}} <b>hire</b> <b>a</b> delegate depends in a non-monotone way {{on the size of the}} contested prize. ...|$|R

5|$|She {{was elected}} as {{national}} {{president of the}} NACW in 1924. While the organization struggled {{to raise funds for}} regular operations, Bethune envisioned its acquiring a headquarters and <b>hiring</b> <b>a</b> professional executive secretary; she implemented this when NACW bought a property at 1318 Vermont Avenue in Washington, DC. She led it to be the first black-controlled organization with headquarters in the capital.|$|E
5|$|Dracula's Daughter {{begins a}} few moments after Dracula ends. Count Dracula has just been {{destroyed}} by Professor Von Helsing (Edward Van Sloan). Von Helsing is taken by police to Scotland Yard, where he explains that he indeed did destroy Count Dracula, but because {{he had already been}} dead for over 500 years, it cannot be considered murder. Instead of <b>hiring</b> <b>a</b> lawyer, he enlists the aid of a psychiatrist, Dr. Jeffrey Garth (Otto Kruger), who was once one of his star students.|$|E
5|$|Hulk Hogan's visibly damaged eye was {{explained}} in the storyline {{as the result of}} Ted DiBiase <b>hiring</b> <b>a</b> group of men to attack Hogan before the match. In reality, the cause of injury has been open to debate. One theory is that Randy Savage punched Hogan because he believed that his ex-wife Elizabeth Hulette had an affair with Hogan while Savage and Hulette were married (the couple divorced in September 1992). WWF officials claimed that the injury {{was the result of a}} Jet Ski accident.|$|E

5|$|In Roman times, {{poisoning}} {{carried out}} {{at the dinner table}} or common eating or drinking area was not unheard of, or even uncommon, and was happening as early as 331 BC. These poisonings would have been used for self-advantageous reasons in every class of the social order. The writer Livy describes the poisoning of members of the upper class and nobles of Rome, and Roman emperor Nero is known to have favored the use of poisons on his relatives, even <b>hiring</b> <b>a</b> personal poisoner. His preferred poison was said to be cyanide.|$|E
5|$|Principal {{photography}} of {{the film}} began in New York City on July 2, 2012, and lasted for 23 days. Carney chose to film in Manhattan's lesser known neighborhoods {{that would be more}} recognizable to locals than tourists. Specific locations included Greenwich Village, the East Village, Times Square, and Washington Square Park. Rather than performing live during filming, the actors sang to pre-recorded tracks. In order to save money on <b>hiring</b> <b>a</b> full crew and extras, some scenes—including one in Times Square—were shot late at night with a handheld camera. The rooftop location near the Empire State Building is located at 28 W 36th St.|$|E
5|$|The Baltimore {{franchise}} began {{operations in}} Milwaukee, Wisconsin as the Brewers (not {{to be confused}} with the current National League team of the same name) in 1901. After one season in Wisconsin under manager and Hall of Famer Hugh Duffy, the franchise moved south to St. Louis, Missouri, adopting the St. Louis Browns name and <b>hiring</b> <b>a</b> new manager, Jimmy McAleer. The Browns remained in Missouri until the end of the 1953 season, when Major League Baseball's owners elected to move the franchise to Baltimore, Maryland, where they were renamed the Orioles, after Maryland's state bird.|$|E
50|$|After being {{a leader}} in the European river {{cruising}} market for decades, CroisiEurope began offering its services to the North American market in 2013. The company <b>hired</b> <b>a</b> New York-based public relations firm and in 2014 <b>hired</b> <b>a</b> director of sales for marketing in the United States.|$|R
5000|$|In January 2010 the brothel <b>hired</b> <b>a</b> male prostitute by {{the name}} of [...] "Markus" [...] and charged $200 for 40 minutes, $300 for an hour and $500 for two hours. Markus quit several weeks later after drawing fewer than 10 customers. The brothel has since <b>hired</b> <b>a</b> replacement.|$|R

5|$|The {{inhabitants}} {{were growing}} desperate {{to remove their}} belongings from the City, especially the upper class. This provided a {{source of income for}} the able-bodied poor, who hired out as porters (sometimes simply making off with the goods), and it was especially profitable for the owners of carts and boats. <b>Hiring</b> <b>a</b> cart had cost a couple of shillings on the Saturday before the fire; on Monday, it rose to as much as £40, a fortune equivalent to more than £4,000 in 2005.|$|E
5|$|Harvard had so {{much trouble}} finding a {{replacement}} for Gray that they considered <b>hiring</b> <b>a</b> European, but they found an American and hired George Lincoln Goodale in late 1872. Goodale had a medical degree from Harvard and a solid knowledge of botany. By late June 1873 Goodale had enough experience that Gray was exalted to pronounce he had taught his last class. William Gilson Farlow also had a medical degree from Harvard and had studied botany. He became Gray's assistant in 1870 after obtaining his medical degree and then studied in Europe for a few years. He returned to Harvard in 1874 and became a botany professor. Sereno Watson began helping Gray with taxonomy in 1872 and became the herbarium curator. The reorganization of botany at Harvard in the early 1870s was a major accomplishment of Gray's.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to his difficult relationship with Price, Reeves {{had to deal with}} a few production problems during the shooting. On the first day, Price was thrown from his horse and sent back to his hotel to recover. The actor returned to work the following day. Towards the end of filming, a strike was called when the British technicians union learned the production company was not <b>hiring</b> <b>a</b> large enough crew as required by union rules. After an extra man was hired, the crew resumed working. On two occasions, Reeves was short of actors. Waddilove replaced an absent actor as a Roundhead officer during Wymark's one-day scene. Waddilove's wife, Susi, played one {{of the women in the}} animal enclosure during the witch-burning sequence.|$|E
5|$|In 1930, the {{congregation}} became divided over {{the need for}} the Jewish community to <b>hire</b> <b>a</b> shochet to ritually slaughter animals for kosher meat, and over whether the synagogue should <b>hire</b> <b>a</b> Reform or Conservative rabbi. More traditional members broke away to form the Beth El Congregation, affiliated with Conservative Judaism.|$|R

5|$|Moondram Pirai {{was shot}} in Ketti, a small town {{situated}} close to Ooty. Shooting also took place in Bangalore. A total of 30 days was taken to complete the filming on 36,000 feet of film negative. Mahendra did not find <b>hiring</b> <b>a</b> train expensive at that time; as a result, he hired a train for the film's scene where Haasan and Sridevi depart for Ketti, and another train for the film's climax which was shot at the Ketti railway station. Although it was raining {{on the day the}} climax was shot, Mahendra decided to continue shooting the scene even though the rain {{was not part of the}} film's script. In the post-production phase, Smitha's voice was dubbed by Anuradha. Mahendra supervised Anuradha's dubbing session and taught her the methods to emote the dialogues for Smitha in the film.|$|E
5|$|Pete is {{in talks}} with Mohawk Airlines for their return to the agency. The {{arrangement}} calls for Roger to handle the day-to-day business. Roger puts Peggy in charge of <b>hiring</b> <b>a</b> new male copywriter for Mohawk. Stan advises her to hire a mediocre employee to make her competition lighter. Peggy, however, chooses to interview a talented young Jewish man named Michael Ginsberg whose work impresses her. When Peggy interviews Michael, he is over-the-top in his disposition. However, Roger forces her to bring Michael to Don. During his interview with Don, Michael is more upstanding and professional, which puzzles Peggy. Michael is hired. He returns home to find his domineering father reading the paper. Michael's personality changes yet again, this time more shy and reserved. When he learns of his son's success, Michael's father blesses his son with a Jewish prayer.|$|E
5|$|The organ was {{originally}} marketed and {{sold by the}} Hammond Organ Company to churches as a lower-cost alternative to the wind-driven pipe organ, or instead of a piano. It quickly became popular with professional jazz musicians in organ trios, a small group centered on the Hammond organ. Organ trios were hired by jazz club owners, who found that organ trios were a much cheaper alternative to <b>hiring</b> <b>a</b> big band. Jimmy Smith's use of the Hammond B-3, with its additional harmonic percussion feature, inspired a generation of organ players, and its use became more widespread in the 1960s and 1970s in rhythm and blues, rock, and reggae, {{as well as being}} an important instrument in progressive rock.|$|E

5|$|With {{more and}} more people coming to Aspen, a better road from the east was needed. An early {{investor}} in the city, B. Clark Wheeler, put up the money needed to improve the path over the pass to a stage road. It opened in November 1881, just as winter was beginning. The tolls, 25 cents for saddle horses and twice that for stages ($ and $ in modern dollars respectively) were primarily spent <b>hiring</b> <b>a</b> large crew of men who kept the pass clear in winter with snowshovels. They were able to keep the road through the pass open during its first five winters. In deep enough snow passengers switched to sleighs; in summer, dogs ran in advance to warn oncoming traffic through the pass itself as the stages took the switchbacks at full speed. It usually took a stage 10–25 hours and five changes of horses to reach Aspen from Twin Lakes.|$|E
5|$|After {{the release}} of Highway 61 Revisited in August 1965, Dylan set about <b>hiring</b> <b>a</b> touring band. Guitarist Mike Bloomfield and {{keyboard}} player Al Kooper had backed Dylan on his new album and at Dylan's controversial electric debut at the 1965 Newport Folk Festival. Bloomfield chose not to tour with Dylan, preferring to remain with the Paul Butterfield Blues Band. After backing him at concerts in late August and early September, Kooper informed Dylan he {{did not wish to}} continue touring with him. Dylan's manager, Albert Grossman, {{was in the process of}} setting up a grueling concert schedule that would keep Dylan on the road for the next nine months, touring the U.S., Australia, and Europe. Dylan contacted a group who were performing as Levon and the Hawks, consisting of Levon Helm from Arkansas and four Canadian musicians: Robbie Robertson, Rick Danko, Richard Manuel and Garth Hudson. They had come together as a band in Canada, backing American rocker Ronnie Hawkins. Two people had strongly recommended the Hawks to Dylan: Mary Martin, the executive secretary of Albert Grossman, and blues singer John Hammond, Jr., son of record producer John Hammond, who had signed Dylan to Columbia Records in 1961; the Hawks had backed the younger Hammond on his 1965 album So Many Roads.|$|E
5|$|Andersen's {{auditors}} were {{pressured by}} Enron's management to defer recognizing the charges {{from the special}} purpose entities as its credit risks became known. Since the entities would never return a profit, accounting guidelines required that Enron should take a write-off, where {{the value of the}} entity was removed from the balance sheet at a loss. To pressure Andersen into meeting Enron's earnings expectations, Enron would occasionally allow accounting companies Ernst & Young or PricewaterhouseCoopers to complete accounting tasks to create the illusion of <b>hiring</b> <b>a</b> new company to replace Andersen. Although Andersen was equipped with internal controls to protect against conflicted incentives of local partners, it failed to prevent conflict of interest. In one case, Andersen's Houston office, which performed the Enron audit, was able to overrule any critical reviews of Enron's accounting decisions by Andersen's Chicago partner. In addition, after news of U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) investigations of Enron were made public, Andersen would later shred several tons of relevant documents and delete nearly 30,000 e-mails and computer files, causing accusations of a cover-up.|$|E
