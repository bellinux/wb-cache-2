60|$|The adventurer was {{stuffing}} {{his pipe}} with rank Indian tobacco, which he pared from a plug with a scalping knife. He <b>glanced</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> two little plumes of smoke which stood straight {{up against the}} red evening sky.|$|E
60|$|Carl did not move. He {{was aware}} of Genie Linderbeck rising, to his left. No one else was up, but, with Genie's frail adherence, Carl {{suddenly}} desired to rouse every one to stand for Frazer and freedom. He <b>glanced</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> one man whom he could always trust to follow him--the Turk. A tiny movement of Carl's lips, a covert up-toss of his head, warned the Turk to rise now.|$|E
60|$|Dick Lancaster, in his arbor, {{was also}} {{thinking}} {{a great deal}} about Olive, and very little about that stalwart sailor, her uncle. If he had merely seen the young woman, and had never heard anything about her, her face would have impressed him, but the knowledge that she was an inmate of the house in which he was staying could not fail to affect him very much. He was puzzling his mind about the girl who had given him a quarter of a dollar, and to whom he had handed fifteen cents in change. He wondered how such a girl happened to be living at such a place. He wondered if there were any possibility of his staying there, or in the neighborhood, until she should come back; he wondered if there were any way by which he could see her again. He might have wondered a good many other things if Captain Asher had not approached the arbor. The captain having been aroused from his mental contemplation of Olive by a man in a wagon, had <b>glanced</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> arbor and had suddenly been struck with the conviction that that young man looked bored, and that, as his host, he was not doing the right thing by him.|$|E
40|$|As I {{write this}} sentence, I am <b>glancing</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> color printer sitting beside my screen. In the popular jargon of the {{computer}} industry, that printer is called a &quot;peripheral&quot;—which, upon reflection, is a rather odd way to describe it. What, precisely, is it peripheral to?

60|$|Now matters {{were getting}} to be worse and worse, and as Shirley <b>glanced</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> yacht,--still {{hovering}} on the weather quarter of the Dunkery, ready at any time to swoop down and hail her if there should be occasion,--he trembled for the fate of his friends. To be sure these two pirate vessels--for sure the Dunkery Beacon now belonged to that class--were nothing but merchantmen. There was no cannon on this steamer, and as the other was now near {{enough for him to}} see her decks as she rolled to windward, {{there was no reason to}} suppose that she carried guns. If these rascals wished to attack or capture a vessel, they must board her, but before they could do that they must catch her, and he knew well enough that there were few ordinary steamers which could overhaul the Summer Shelter. If it were not for his own most unfortunate position, the yacht could steam away in safety and leave these wretches to their own devices, but he did not believe that his old friend would desert him. More than that, there was no reason to suppose that the people on the Summer Shelter knew that the Dunkery Beacon was now manned by pirates, although it was likely that they would suspect the character of the new-comer.|$|E
5000|$|... "One morning I {{went for}} a walk along the beach about six thirty. I jokingly asked the {{universe}} for a fairy godmother. About half an hour later, as I was sitting on a bench sipping my take-out coffee, I <b>glanced</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> bench next to mine and heard a woman telling stories to a young man while simultaneously weaving a mat from strips of newspaper. Twenty minutes later, this flamboyant, sixty-ish woman came up to me, or more accurately, breezed over. She (p.232-) wore two cloaks embroidered with sequins and of the color of rainbows, psychedelic spandex leggings, and a big purple hat. She smiled, revealing a gold, star-shaped filling on the front of one of her incisors. She said her name was Orunamamu, meaning [...] "Morning Star" [...] in Nigerian. She was a storyteller from Berkeley, on her way home from attending a festival in Alberta." [...] Cousineau 2002:232-3 ...|$|E
5000|$|Mary Simpson, Roy Myers, Ryan Phillips, and David Cosper {{connected}} {{the summer of}} 2005 at the Maury River Fiddler’s Convention in Buena Vista, Virginia. Myers and Phillips had been performing around Richmond while Simpson and Cosper appeared in Charlottesville while studying music at the University of Virginia. The Richmond faction invited the Charlottesvillians east for some gigs and the band was formed. [...] As to how an historic event - the [...] "unhappy reaction of whiskey makers to a tax imposed {{by the federal government}} during George Washington’s presidency" [...] - ended up being their band name, Phillips explains: [...] "We were practicing music at Roy’s house on Floyd Avenue years ago when we <b>glanced</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> TV. There was a special on about the Whiskey Rebellion. We had been looking around for a name and that one stuck." [...] Tim Deibler, bass player − a resident of Charlottesville, Virginia, who studied music at Christopher Newport University − is the newest member of the group.|$|E

60|$|Sir Richmond <b>glanced</b> <b>over</b> his {{shoulder}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> subject of these commendations. Through the oval window glared {{an expression of}} malignity that made no impression whatever on his preoccupied mind.|$|R
60|$|He strolled along blithely, {{casting a}} <b>glance</b> <b>over</b> his {{shoulders}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> dusty cloud which {{hung over the}} Seamew as he went. It was virgin soil to him, and he thirsted for adventure.|$|R

6000|$|... "So far, so good," [...] murmured the mate, as he <b>glanced</b> <b>over</b> his {{shoulder}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> little group posing on the steps. [...] "I’ve done the best I could, but I suppose there’ll be a row." ...|$|R

6000|$|My friend <b>glanced</b> <b>over</b> his {{spectacles}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> proffered paper. He rose in his wrath! He towered! Seizing {{a loaded}} pen he dashed at that fair sheet and scrabbled thereon in raging characters, [...] "Impenitent Sinner--Not one cent, by G--!" ...|$|R

60|$|Mr. Rose coughed and, having {{caught his}} eye, {{shook his head}} at him and <b>glanced</b> {{significantly}} <b>over</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> unconscious Jane. The young man ignored his action and, having got an opening, gave utterance {{in the course of the}} next ten minutes to Radical heresies of so violent a type that the farmer could hardly keep his seat. Social distinctions were condemned utterly, and the House of Lords referred to as a human dust- bin. The farmer gazed open-mouthed at this snake he had nourished.|$|R
6000|$|He {{was in a}} panic. But the hostess, {{instead of}} calling for the police, gushed, [...] "So glad you could come!"

60|$|But {{the pretty}} milkmaid {{was much too}} vexed to make any answer. She picked up the leg sulkily and led her cow away, the poor animal limping on three legs.

60|$|He <b>glanced</b> <b>over</b> his {{shoulder}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> black cloud trailing away before the wind, saw Sylvia's desire in her face, and silently complied; {{for being a}} keen student of character, {{he was willing to}} prolong an interview that gave him glimpses of a nature in which the woman and the child were curiously blended.|$|R
6000|$|... "We keep it dark {{on account}} of Sister's eyes. When I was a little girl, it wasn't {{considered}} polite to say rude things about other people's houses, especially if they were very handsome ones," [...] said Miss Henny, with a stern <b>glance</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> eye-glasses <b>at</b> <b>the</b> young offender, whose second remark was even more unfortunate than her first.|$|R
60|$|Donkin, instinctively, <b>glanced</b> <b>over</b> his {{shoulder}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> brilliant flame; then, still looking away, felt under the pillow for a key.

60|$|A thick wood lay {{two hundred}} paces {{from the road}} upon which the archers stood. A stretch of smooth grassy sward lay between.

60|$|Ralph {{began his}} bread and milk, and Mrs. Conway, {{stretching}} out her hand, took the letter he had laid beside his plate, {{and turning it}} <b>over</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> direction to ascertain from which of her few correspondents it came.
