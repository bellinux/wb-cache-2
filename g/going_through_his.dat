5|$|It {{is unclear}} how {{initiation}} may have affected a devotee's rank within the cult. After <b>going</b> <b>through</b> <b>his</b> third initiation, Lucius becomes a pastophoros, {{a member of a}} particular class of priests. If the third initiation was a requirement for becoming a pastophoros, it is possible that members moved up in the cult hierarchy by going through the series of initiations. Nevertheless, Apuleius refers to initiates and to priests as if they are separate groups within the cult. Initiation may have been a prerequisite for a devotee to become a priest but not have automatically made him or her into one.|$|E

500|$|On December 17, 2013, LaBeouf {{released}} his short film Howard Cantour.com to the Internet; shortly thereafter, several bloggers noted its close similarity to Justin M. Damiano, a 2007 comic by Ghost World creator Dan Clowes. Wired journalist Graeme McMillan noted {{at least three}} similarities in their article, {{one of which was}} that the opening monologue for the short and the comic were identical. LaBeouf would later remove the film and claim that he did not intend to copy Clowes but was instead [...] "inspired" [...] by him and [...] "got lost in the creative process." [...] He followed this up with several apologies via Twitter writing, [...] "In my excitement and naiveté as an amateur filmmaker, I got lost in the creative process and neglected to follow proper accreditation", and [...] "I deeply regret the manner in which these events have unfolded and want @danielclowes to know that I have a great respect for his work". Clowes responded by saying [...] "The first I ever heard of the film was this morning when someone sent me a link. I've never spoken to or met Mr. LaBeouf ...

Upon graduating, Devon heads to Atlanta, Georgia to attend the fictitious Atlanta A University (based on North Carolina A), a historically black college that takes enormous pride in its marching band. Devon was personally invited to attend on full scholarship by Dr. James Lee (Jones), head of the band, for his prodigious talents. The A band separates itself from its competitors by requiring all members to read music, by focusing on various styles of music rather than what music is currently popular on the radio, and dedication to the teamwork emphasized [...] "one band, one sound" [...] concept. The band has a preseason that is similar to an athletic team's induction in that it is very physically and mentally difficult. It challenges all recruits to push themselves past what they previously thought were their limits. At the end of preseason, the musicians audition for spots on the field, and Devon is the only freshman to make P1, the highest level player.

2500|$|These two poets {{have often}} been {{compared}} to each other. [...] To some extent this is because they were good friends and slightly older {{than most of the}} other leading members of their generation, as well as sharing similar career-paths, but they also seemed to share a similar approach to poetry. [...] Their poems often have a rarefied quality and tend not to deal with [...] "particulars", readily identifiable people and places. [...] However, they did differ in many respects as exemplified by the titles they gave to their published lectures on Spanish poetry. [...] At Johns Hopkins, Salinas published a collection called Reality and the Poet in Spanish Poetry, whereas Guillén’s Norton lectures were called Language and Poetry. [...] Both devoted single lectures to Góngora and San Juan de la Cruz and the comparisons between them are instructive. [...] Salinas seems to want to show us the poetic reality behind or beyond appearances, to educate us into how to see whereas Guillén gives us an account of the thoughts and sense-impressions <b>going</b> <b>through</b> <b>his</b> own mind: [...] the reader is a viewer of this process not a participant in it. [...] Vicente Aleixandre recalled visiting Salinas and finding him at his desk with his daughter on one knee and his son on the other and stretching out a hand clutching a pen to shake hands with his visitor. [...] Although he was also devoted to his family, Guillén probably worked in a secluded study.|$|E
