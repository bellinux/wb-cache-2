40|$|Crucial to the {{determination}} of humanity's future {{at the dawn of}} the new millennium will be our capacity to manage global interdependence. Initial attempts at managing global interdependence have been undertaken in response to <b>global</b> <b>environmental</b> concerns. Transnational environmental problems derive from, at a fundamental level, an incapacity to manage interdependence. The foremost <b>global</b> <b>environmental</b> problem, with accordingly the most developed political response, is climate change. There is the possibility that an analysis of the international political response to climate change may reveal a basis for managing global interdependence. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the political response to global climate change. My further purpose is to determine if the norms and institutions relating to regulation of climate change might enable management of interdependence. Managing interdependence entails the establishment of order. Order derives from a given society’s capacity, in the words of Hedley Bull, "to establish a conformity of conduct. " 1 Identifying norms and institutions that can establish a conformity of conduct in <b>environmental</b> <b>affairs</b> is a pressing consideration, owing to the magnitude of environmental threats such as climate change...|$|R

50|$|The National Security Council {{framework}} in the Clinton administration included an NSC Principals Committee, a forum available to Cabinet-level officials {{to discuss and}} resolve issues not requiring the President's participation. An NSC Deputies Committee served as the senior sub-cabinet interagency forum for considering policy issues affecting national security and for reviewing and monitoring {{the work of the}} NSC interagency process. This process included Interagency Working Groups (IWGs), which were to convene on a regular basis to review and coordinate the implementation of Presidential decisions in their respective policy areas. Among the most urgent issues the NSC dealt with {{in the first year of}} the Clinton administration were Bosnia, Haiti, Iraq, and Somalia. The several dozen other questions the NSC system dealt with initially included such issues as illegal drugs, United Nations peacekeeping, Zaire, strategic arms control policy, China, and <b>global</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>affairs.</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{recognition}} that information matters {{in world affairs}} raises {{a number of questions}} as to when, how, and under what conditions it influences the behavior of policy actors. Despite the vast and growing array of institutions involved in collecting, analyzing, and disseminating information potentially relevant to global governance generally, and global environmental change specifically, our understanding of the role that these “information institutions” play in world affairs remains limited. This paper examines how institutions mediate the impact of scientific assessments on <b>global</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>affairs</b> and highlights the pathways through which information has influence on the policy and politics of environmental issues. We identify salience, credibility and legitimacy as the critical attributions that different audiences make about an assessment that determine whether they will change their thoughts, decisions, and behavior in response to it. We also outline how institutional rules regarding participation, framing, and scope and content allow knowledge systems to reach needed thresholds of salience, credibility, and legitimacy and to balance the tradeoffs and tensions among them. ...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis paper aims at {{clarifying}} some conceptual flaws {{blurring the}} equity-efficiency debates {{involved in the}} setting of objectives of GHGs emissions control beyond 2012. To this end, it carries out numerical experiments that test the viability of agreements grounded on two contrasting target allocation rules: a "Soft Landing" rule prolonging a Kyoto-type agreement; and a "Convergence" rule progressively re-directing Kyoto towards a per capita emissions endowment. The paper demonstrates the sensitivity of the impact to the metric used to assess it and to assumptions regarding the interaction between the cap and trade system and accompanying measures such as domestic policies (characterised as simple fiscal reforms) and international public funding. In a third step it derives some lessons about how to reconcile two political imperatives: (a) an ex-post or "consequentialist" approach to equity, which however cannot fully avoid relying on ex-ante rules, and (b) the necessity of an agreement on such stable ex-ante rules to set up emissions targets and efficient emissions trading. The latter step suggests a coming back to the environment/development "Gordian Knot", which underpins all <b>global</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>affairs</b> since the Stockholm Conference in 1972. We argue that the equity-efficiency dilemma has to be set in a broader sustainable development perspective whereby climate policies are integrated with development priorities of the poorest countries so as to create a leverage effect on development...|$|E

40|$|This article {{provides}} a first-hand {{account of the}} World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD) and an analysis of how to advance environmentalist concerns in the post-Jo'burg era. It reviews some of the achievements and disappointments of the Summit and describes significant changes in <b>global</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>affairs</b> that the WSSD was unable fully to appreciate and which, therefore, must be addressed in the post-Jo'burg world. One change is a switch in emphasis in the North and South in terms of sustainable development. For too long we've {{been told that the}} North is concerned with the environment while the South is focused on development. At the WSSD it became clear, however, that this is no longer the case. Many in the North now claim a development focus although, to be sure, through the more fundamental goal of economic globalization. Concomitantly, many in the South voice a commitment to environmental sustainability as a way to reduce poverty. A second change {{has to do with the}} power of environmentalism. After enjoying much strength, concern for the environment is flagging throughout much of the world as key states find themselves distracted by geo-political concerns in the aftermath of the September 11 -super-th attacks. Both changes indicate the need to rethink environmentalist strategies in a post-Jo'burg era. The article offers several suggestions including abandoning sustainable development as a policy objective (although keeping it as a conceptual framework) and resuscitating the older, more narrow and arguably less complicated goals of environmental protection.

40|$|Taking {{departure}} in {{the premise}} that donor and recipient priorities differ {{with regard to the}} marginal costs and benefits associated with attacking <b>global</b> <b>environmental</b> externalities, and hence the relative importance attached to the global environment, this paper seeks to scrutinize specific <b>global</b> <b>environmental</b> transfer mechanisms in the light of proposed definitions of <b>global</b> <b>environmental</b> assistance and <b>global</b> <b>environmental</b> compensation. It is argued that most <b>global</b> <b>environmental</b> transfer mechanisms possess distinct compensatory elements, and that additionality of these transfers is essential {{in order to ensure that}} existing development assistance is not crowded out. Specifically, this should be achieved either directly through separation of funds for <b>global</b> <b>environmental</b> and local developmental purposes or indirectly through increased considerations for local development objectives directly in <b>global</b> <b>environmental</b> transfer design.
