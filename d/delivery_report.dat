50|$|The VMSC will {{request the}} {{information}} needed {{for it to}} deliver the Short Message to its recipient by sending a Send_Info_for_MT_SMS message to the VLR. The VLR will then instigate a page request, or subscriber search, for the destination subscribers Mobile Subscriber ISDN Number (MSISDN), and return the result to the VMSC. Since a typical deployment sees the VLR being co-located with the MSC, this message flow is usually internal to the platform. Should the page or search for the subscriber fail, the VLR will indicate the failure cause to the VMSC, which will abort the Short Message delivery procedure and return the failure to the SMSC (see the Failed Short Message delivery section below). If the page of the handset was successful, the VMSC will then send to the SMSC indicating successful delivery. The GMSC component of the SMSC passes {{the result of the}} delivery attempt to the Service Centre. In the case of successful delivery, the delivered text message will be removed from the Store and Forward Engine (SFE) and, if requested, a <b>delivery</b> <b>report</b> sent to the text originator. If the delivery failed, the SMSC invokes a retry procedure to periodically make further attempts at delivery; additionally, it may register with the HLR to receive a notification when the B-Party becomes available for Short Message delivery in the future (see the Failed Short Message delivery section below).|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{prevalence}} of sphincter rupture during childbirth {{has increased in}} Sweden from half percent to three percent from 1973 to 1993. Women who undergo planned home birth have sphincter injuries to a smaller extent than women who undergo planned hospital births. Objective: The {{purpose of this study}} was to describe women’s experience of the last stages of delivery during planned home birth. Design: Inductive content analysis of 150 randomly selected <b>delivery</b> <b>reports.</b> The <b>delivery</b> <b>reports</b> were gathered as a reply to an open question in a previously conducted survey. Findings: The woman´s confidence in the natural birthing process emerged as the overall theme of the <b>delivery</b> <b>reports.</b> Fourteen subcategories and five categories emerged during the analysis process: experience of support, physical experience, psychological experience, experience of birthplace and birth position and the woman’s awareness during birth. Conclusion: The support from the surrounding people was very important for the women and they felt calm and secure in the home environment. The women often gave birth in a birthing position that led to a reduced risk of perineal tears. Many risk factors for sphincter injuries were eliminated for the women who went thru planned home birth. For example the women often had experiences of prior deliveries and further no medical instruments were used during late stages of delivery in planned home births...|$|R

40|$|Colon {{specific}} {{drug delivery}} has gained increased importance {{not just for}} the delivery of drugs for the treatment of local diseases associated with the colon but also as potential site for the systemic delivery of therapeutic peptide and proteins. To achieve successful colon targeted drug delivery, a drug needs to be protected from degradation, release and/or absorption in the upper portion of the GI tract and then ensure abrupt or controlled release in the proximal colon. Drug modifications through covalent linkages with carrier or prodrug approach and formulation based approaches can be used for colonic <b>delivery.</b> <b>Report</b> suggests that drug carrier systems larger than 200 μm possess very low gastric transit time due to physiological condition of the bowel in colitis.

Power saving is always vital {{to increase the}} lifetime of Wireless Sensor Networks.
