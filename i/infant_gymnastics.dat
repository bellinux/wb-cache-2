50|$|Just as {{the general}} field of {{internal}} medicine gradually gave rise to pediatric medicine as a specialized subfield, the specialized field of baby and <b>infant</b> <b>gymnastics</b> also gradually acquired full status as part of general physiotherapy. After a two-year training course at the state-accredited physiotherapy schools, an additional half-year special course in baby and <b>infant</b> <b>gymnastics</b> as per the Neumann-Neurode Method was now required of caregivers.|$|E
50|$|Professor Dr. C. Mau, M.D., Director of the Orthopedic University Clinic in Hamburg Eppendorf, noted at {{that time}} that the field of {{orthopedic}} medicine had a considerable interest {{in the fact that the}} concept of baby and <b>infant</b> <b>gymnastics</b> is tied to the name Neumann-Neurode and is widely practiced, and deserves to be considered a valuable measure of preventive medicine.|$|E
5000|$|In 1921, Neumann-Neurode was {{discharged}} from military service {{and turned his}} attention entirely to the fight against crippling physical handicaps. Working with interested physicians, surgeons and orthopedists,he developed a method of <b>infant</b> <b>gymnastics</b> that was {{an effective means of}} assisting normal development. At the request of Professor Bier this method was now tested under Professor Langstein and introduced in the National Institute for the Elimination of Infant Mortality. In 1922 Neumann-Neurode founded the [...] "Institute for Physical Exercise in Earliest Childhood" [...] ("Anstalt für Körperübungen im frühesten Kindesalter") and began to teach his method.|$|E
50|$|The work of Neumann-Neurode {{is known}} {{the world over}} as an {{integral}} part of pediatric physiotherapy. Many sports programs and activities are available today for all age groups, and handicapped children are often integrated or have special programs. And for decades the <b>infant</b> and toddler <b>gymnastics</b> has been part of the therapy treatment in physiotherapy.|$|R
