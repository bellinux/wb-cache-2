She managed to recover some of the family property and emigrated to Germany, and later, Switzerland, with her son, Astolphe-Louis-Léonor. The fate of the family is representative of the fates of many of the minor aristocracy in France, <b>especially</b> <b>those</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> military and diplomatic corps, whose reputations the Montagnards tarnished in the Reign of Terror.|$|E
5|$|Novelty deep-fried {{foods are}} popular today in American fairs, <b>especially</b> <b>those</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> American South. Hundreds of items are served at these fairs. Some of them include deep-fried beer, butter, and bubblegum. Additionally, deep frying {{can be used}} as a form of artwork by frying non-edible objects, such as {{electronic}}s. Artists such as Henry Hargreaves have deep-fried replicas of electronic items such as iPads, Game Boys, and laptops.|$|E

5|$|Since the Belgian {{military}} had officially surrendered in May 1940 and the Belgian Constitution specifically forbade Belgians from joining foreign militaries, the Free Belgian forces were officially committing treason; {{the charge was}} only annulled in 1948 and nobody was prosecuted. Despite the formation of all-Belgian ground units from late 1940, many Belgian volunteers – <b>especially</b> <b>those</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Royal Air Force – served in majority British units, particularly {{in the early years}} after the formation of the Free Belgian forces.|$|E
5|$|More than 300 {{hours of}} footage was {{recorded}} by {{the students and the}} two Iraqi associate producers. It was transcribed, translated and edited into a 90-minute film. Getting the tapes out of Iraq proved difficult for Winter and O'Mahoney, who remained in the UK. They had to rely on journalists from many news agencies, <b>especially</b> <b>those</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> BBC News's Baghdad Bureau high-risk team, to smuggle the tapes out of Iraq. When curfews were enforced, weeks passed before the producers received new footage because it was impossible for anybody to leave their homes or the country.|$|E

50|$|Social {{behaviors}} {{present themselves}} {{in a variety of}} ways. <b>Especially</b> <b>in</b> <b>those</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> education system. Social behavior is behavior that occurs among two or more organisms, typically from <b>the</b> same species. <b>Those</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> K-12 system are <b>in</b> <b>the</b> process of developing behaviors that will generate future personality traits and behavioral patterns.

25|$|In {{the first}} phase, British {{strategy}} {{was focused on}} the North, and not so much on the backwoods settlements, <b>especially</b> <b>those</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> west. The Cherokee, therefore, were on their own, except for supplies from British ports on the coast and some joint operations in South Carolina.|$|E
25|$|Within the Muslim {{community}} in the United States there exist {{a number of different}} traditions. As {{in the rest of the}} world, the Sunni Muslims are in the majority.

25|$|A {{number of}} countries, <b>especially</b> <b>those</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Western world, have passed {{measures}} to alleviate discrimination against sexual minorities, including laws against anti-gay hate crimes and workplace discrimination. Some have also legalized same-sex marriage or civil unions {{in order to}} grant same-sex couples the same protections and benefits as opposite-sex couples. In 2011, the United Nations passed its first resolution recognizing LGBT rights.|$|E
25|$|During World War II, Vandenberg's {{position}} on American foreign policy changed radically. Although {{he continued to}} vote with the conservative coalition against Roosevelt's domestic proposals, Vandenberg gradually abandoned his isolationism to become an architect of a bipartisan foreign policy, which he defined as a consensus developed by consultation between the President, the State Department, and congressional leaders from both parties, <b>especially</b> <b>those</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Senate.|$|E
25|$|Until recently, {{construction}} {{on the banks of}} the Lake had been largely under the control of real estate developers. Construction activities have resulted in a clouding of the lake's blue waters. Currently, the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency is regulating construction along the shoreline (and has won two Federal Supreme Court battles over recent decisions). These regulations are unpopular with many residents, <b>especially</b> <b>those</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Tahoe Lakefront Homeowners Association.|$|E

25|$|Because of {{its origins}} in the Old Testament, early Church Fathers, <b>especially</b> <b>those</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> West, saw natural law {{as part of the}} natural {{foundation}} of Christianity. The most notable among these was Augustine of Hippo, who equated natural law with man's prelapsarian state; as such, a life according to unbroken human nature was no longer possible and men needed instead to seek healing and salvation through the divine law and grace of Jesus Christ.|$|E
25|$|This {{resulted}} in a strong and swift negative reaction from nationalists, <b>especially</b> <b>those</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> army, culminating in his assassination {{in the course of}} the February 26 Incident. This had a chilling effect on all civilian bureaucrats in the Japanese government. From 1934, the military's dominance of the government continued to grow. Instead of reducing deficit spending, the government introduced price controls and rationing schemes that reduced, but did not eliminate inflation, which remained a problem until the end of World WarII.|$|E
25|$|Americans of Polish ancestry, <b>especially</b> <b>those</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Midwest and New England, {{who have}} the name Joseph {{celebrate}} Saint Joseph's Day (Dzien Swietego Jozefa) as an imieniny. As a symbol of ethnic pride, and in solidarity with their Italian counterparts, Polish Catholic parishes often hold Saint Joseph's Day feasts known as Saint Joseph's Tables or Saint Joseph's altars, and display statues and holy cards of Saint Joseph. As the day falls during Lent, these are meatless feasts.|$|E

25|$|One {{possible}} {{strategy is}} for the foreign company {{to enter into a}} joint-venture agreement with a public or private Iranian partner. The existing level of technology and infrastructure makes many Iranian companies suitable for expansion and development in conjunction with foreign companies. Many Iranian companies, <b>especially</b> <b>those</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> private sector, are currently actively seeking joint-venture partners both to fill their technological as well as management gaps. Others are looking for a revival of their company through foreign capital.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, Italy faced {{significant}} challenges, as voters – disenchanted with political paralysis, massive public debt and the extensive corruption system (known as Tangentopoli) uncovered by the 'Clean Hands' investigation – demanded radical reforms. The scandals involved all major parties, but <b>especially</b> <b>those</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> government coalition: the Christian Democrats, who ruled for almost 50 years, underwent a severe crisis and eventually disbanded, splitting up into several factions. The Communists reorganised as a social-democratic force. During the 1990s and the 2000s (decade), centre-right (dominated by media magnate Silvio Berlusconi) and centre-left coalitions (led by university professor Romano Prodi) alternatively governed the country.|$|E
25|$|The policy's price {{controls}} and market interventions led to considerable overproduction. These were intervention stores of products bought {{up by the}} Community to maintain minimum price levels. To dispose of surplus stores, they were often sold {{on the world market}} at prices considerably below Community guaranteed prices, or farmers were offered subsidies (amounting to the difference between the Community and world prices) to export their products outside the Community. This system has been criticised for under-cutting farmers outside Europe, <b>especially</b> <b>those</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> developing world. Supporters of CAP argue that the economic support which it gives to farmers provides them with a reasonable standard of living.|$|E
