5|$|A key {{strategy}} was {{the establishment of}} colonial towns across the territories that underwent the process of conquest and colonisation; {{they were used to}} project Spanish power over the surrounding countryside. The Spanish were particularly <b>horrified</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Mesoamerican religious practice of human sacrifice, prompting them to attempt to eradicate the native religion.|$|E
5|$|As noted above, La Fleche {{was already}} in foal when racing in 1894 and {{produced}} her first foal, a filly called La Veine in 1895. In 1896 Maurice de Hirsch died and all his bloodstock, including La Fleche and La Veine were put up for auction. She was sold for £12,600 to Marcus Beresford, acting on this occasion on behalf the Sykes family and was sent to their Sledmere Stud in Yorkshire. Sir Tatton Sykes, who was reportedly <b>horrified</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> price, initially refused to acknowledge the mare’s arrival, and left her in a railway box for two weeks before he was persuaded to accept the deal.|$|E

5|$|The {{relief efforts}} were {{hindered}} by {{the composition of}} the mud, which made it nearly impossible to move through without becoming stuck. By the time relief workers reached Armero twelve hours after the eruption, many of the victims with serious injuries were dead. The relief workers were <b>horrified</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> landscape of fallen trees, disfigured human bodies, and piles of debris from entire houses. This was the second-deadliest volcanic disaster of the 20th century, surpassed only by the 1902 eruption of Mount Pelée, and is the fourth-deadliest volcanic event recorded since 1500 AD. The event was a foreseeable catastrophe exacerbated by the populace's unawareness of the volcano's destructive history; geologists and other experts had warned authorities and media outlets about the danger over the weeks and {{days leading up to the}} eruption. Hazard maps for the vicinity were prepared, but poorly distributed. On the day of the eruption, several evacuation attempts were made, but a severe storm restricted communications. Many victims stayed in their houses as they had been instructed, believing that the eruption had ended. The noise from the storm may have prevented many from hearing the sounds from Ruiz until it was too late.|$|E

5000|$|The schism in {{the staff}} {{had to do}} with the issue of {{violence}} in the peace movement.

25|$|Immediately {{after the}} bombing of Guernica, René Iché, a French sculptor, created {{one of his most}} violent and {{personal}} sculptures.

He refused to display his work because of the violence. Just after his death an exhibition was held to commemorate the artist.

The grandmother is outraged. The grandfather is there, in his wheelchair, to hear it all. Corrine denies everything, but it doesn't matter; it's too late.

50|$|On {{the day of}} the performance, Jeffy's ankle gets sprained during practice. The team looks {{likely to}} be forced to forfeit, as {{competition}} rules require a mandatory five members. Just in time, though, Butters suddenly arrives in his tap-dancing outfit, allowing the kids to perform. When they do, however, Butters' shoe flies off again and hits a stage light, causing the rafter to fall on and kill the entire Orange County team and their coach. Although Butters is <b>horrified</b> <b>by</b> this, <b>the</b> South Park team wins by default, and a bloodstained, screaming and horribly traumatized Butters is carried off and hailed as a hero.|$|R

25|$|The ban on Sati, {{effected}} by Lord William Bentinck in 1829, was {{largely due to}} the efforts of both Christian and Hindu reformers such as William Carey and Ram Mohan Roy. In 1799 Carey, a Baptist missionary from England, first witnessed the burning of a widow on her husband’s funeral pyre. <b>Horrified</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> practice, Carey and his coworkers Joshua Marshman and William Ward opposed sati from that point onward, lobbying for its abolishment. Known as the Serampore Trio, they published essays forcefully condemning the practice and presented an address against Sati to then Governor General of India, Lord Wellesley.|$|E

Following the Salon d'Automne of 1905 which {{marked the beginning of}} Fauvism, the Salon des Indépendants of 1906 marked the first time all the Fauves would exhibit together. The centerpiece of the exhibition was Matisse's monumental Le Bonheur de Vivre (The Joy of Life). The triangular composition is closely related to Cézanne's Bathers; a series that would soon become a source of inspiration for Picasso's Les Demoiselles d'Avignon. Critics were <b>horrified</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> flatness, bright colors, eclectic style and mixed technique of Le Bonheur de Vivre.|$|E

25|$|Blackface and minstrelsy {{serve as}} the theme of Spike Lee's film Bamboozled (2000). It tells of a disgruntled black {{television}} executive who reintroduces the old blackface style in a series concept {{in an attempt to}} get himself fired, and is instead <b>horrified</b> <b>by</b> its success. <b>The</b> original design of the Pokémon character Jynx caused controversy over its alleged resemblance to a blackface caricature. It has since been redesigned with a purple skin tone. A 2008 imitation of Barack Obama by comedian Fred Armisen (of Venezuelan and Korean descent) on the popular television program Saturday Night Live caused some stir, with The Guardian's commentator openly asking why SNL did not hire an additional black actor to do the sketch; the show had only one black cast member at the time.|$|R
40|$|Christians {{tend to be}} <b>horrified</b> {{and embarrassed}} <b>by</b> <b>the</b> bloodthirstiness of Psalm 137, {{especially}} {{in the light of}} Jesus' command to forgive one's enemies.

It is the aim of this article to show that Psalm 137 can and should take its rightful place in the life and worship of the Christian Church. [URL]...|$|R
25|$|Together with Sima and Herseni, Brăileanu {{sought to}} {{establish}} full Guardist control over cultural institutes such as Accademia di Romania, but their moves were vetoed by Antonescu, who favored {{a more conservative}} approach. Brăileanu had a tense relationship with another one of Antonescu's proteges, Sextil Pușcariu, who led the Romanian Institute in Berlin and had been given discretionary powers. Antonescu also asked Brăileanu to tone down his purge of academia, and the latter threatened with his resignation. <b>Horrified</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Guard's assassinations of Iorga and Virgil Madgearu, in late November, he again tendered his resignation, but was persuaded to reverse his decision—allegedly, he agreed {{so that he could}} spare the country even greater chaos.|$|E
25|$|Liuzzo was <b>horrified</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> {{images of}} the aborted march on Bloody Sunday. A second march took place March 9.

He was obeying a federal {{injunction}} while seeking protection from federal court for the march. That night, a white group beat and murdered civil rights activist James Reeb, a Unitarian Universalist minister from Boston, who had come to Selma to march with the second group.

25|$|The {{refreshed}} administration {{began to}} issue various edicts {{in both the}} King and Queen Consort's names and they were eager to implement political, economic, social, and cultural reforms.

After only two days of new influence over the administration, they were crushed by Chinese troops under Yuan Shih-kai's command. A handful of Progressive leaders were killed. Once again, the Japanese government saw the opportunity to extort {{money out of the}} Joseon government by forcing Gojong, again without the knowledge of his wife, to sign a treaty.

After her attempts at diplomacy had failed, she handed over the Song dynasty's imperial seal to Bayan, [...] "an unambiguous symbol of capitulation." [...] With the submission of Emperor Gong, Bayan ordered that the Song imperial family should be respected, and forbade the pillaging of their imperial tombs or treasuries.

[...] About a conquest in another vanquished city he wrote: [...] "I flayed the nobles as many as rebelled; and I spread their skins out on the piles."
