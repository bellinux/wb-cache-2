30|$|Based on the {{classical}} <b>fractal</b> <b>video</b> compression method, monocular and stereo <b>fractal</b> <b>video</b> compression methods are proposed in this article, experimental {{results indicate that}} the proposed monocular <b>fractal</b> <b>video</b> compression method can raise compression ratio 3.6 to 7.5 times, speed up compression time 5.3 to 22.3 times, and improve the image quality 3.81 to 9.24 dB in comparison with CPM/NCIM. The PSNR of the proposed stereo video coding is about 0.17 dB higher than that of the proposed monocular video coding, and 0.69 dB higher than that of JMVC 4.0 on average. Comparing with the bit rate resulted by the proposed monocular video coding and JMVC 4.0, the proposed stereo video coding achieves, on average, 2.53 and 21.14 Kbps bit rate saving, respectively. A new object-based method improves the performances of <b>fractal</b> <b>video</b> coding algorithm obviously. The proposed object-based <b>fractal</b> <b>video</b> coding method which can increase compression ratio, the decoded image quality, and speed is simple and effective, and adds more flexibility and practicability to the applications of <b>fractal</b> <b>video</b> coding.|$|R

Because computer capacity of servers are so powerful that complete encode of <b>fractal</b> <b>video</b> compress for server-end, comparing the mobile phone is so poor that decode of <b>fractal</b> <b>video</b> compress for client-end. In this paper, basing on the segment, we present GA to improve the quality of video compress through adjust the fixed parameter to suitable value in fractal compress algorithm. For improving speed, the paper describes PSO to speed up the <b>fractal</b> <b>video</b> compress. PSO method could find the best domain when we face huge samples to search. Compare the GA method, as it does not need the crossover and mutation, the speed of convergence is clear faster when we use PSO method to find the best G. Another issue is that we couldn’t ensure that the new crossover and mutation must follow the field the original Domains. If that, we should add more samples to domains. Experiments shows that the PSO could better match the requirement of searching the best domain comparing GA method on the premise of guaranteeing the decoded image’s quality.

For that developed a method that aims to randomize <b>video</b> <b>files,</b> so it can not be accessed by others who are not interested. Encription Data Algorithm Standard (DES), an encryption algorithm with a symmetric key, one of the cryptography method introduced by WL Tuchman in 1972 at the IBM lab.

The external keys are processed to produce 16 pieces of internal key with each key length 48 bits. The internal lock is a part in the process of encryption and decryption. In addition the DES algorithm also uses the s-box predefined eight pieces, which will be used in the Feistel system. DES algorithm is quite good with the loop 16 times on the stages of encryption and decryption. This makes plain file encryption function optimally.

40|$|Multiview video {{consists}} of multiple {{views of the}} same scene. They require enormous amount of data to achieve high image quality, which makes it indispensable to compress multiview video. Therefore, data compression is a major issue for multiviews. In this paper, we explore an efficient <b>fractal</b> <b>video</b> codec to compress multiviews. The proposed scheme first compresses a view-dependent geometry of the base view using <b>fractal</b> <b>video</b> encoder with homogeneous region condition. With the extended fractional pel motion estimation algorithm and fast disparity estimation algorithm, it then generates prediction images of other views. The prediction image uses the image-based rendering techniques based on the decoded video. And the residual signals are obtained by the prediction image and the original image. Finally, it encodes residual signals by the <b>fractal</b> <b>video</b> encoder. The idea is also to exploit the statistical dependencies from both temporal and interview reference pictures for motion compensated prediction. Experimental {{results show that the}} proposed algorithm is consistently better than JMVC 8. 5, with 62. 25 % bit rate decrease and 0. 37 [*]dB PSNR increase based on the Bjontegaard metric, and the total encoding time (TET) of the proposed algorithm is reduced by 92 %...|$|R

40|$|The {{goal with}} {{this project was}} to improve an {{existing}} face recognition system for video streams by using adaptive object tracking to track faces between frames. The knowledge of what faces occur and do not occur in subsequent frames was used to filter false faces and to better identify real ones. The recognition ability was tested by measuring how many faces were found {{and how many of}} them were correctly identified in two short <b>video</b> <b>files.</b> The tests also looked at the number of false face detections. The results were compared to a reference implementation that did not use object tracking. Two identification modes were tested: the default and strict modes. In the default mode, whichever person is most similar to a given image patch is accepted as the answer. In strict mode, the similarity also has to be above a certain threshold. The first <b>video</b> <b>file</b> had a fairly high image quality. It had only frontal faces, one at a time. The second <b>video</b> <b>file</b> had a slightly lower image quality. It had up to two faces at a time, in a larger variety of angles. The second video was therefore a more difficult case. The results show that the number of detected faces increased by 6 - 21 % in the two <b>video</b> <b>files,</b> for both identification modes, compared to the reference implementation. In the meantime, the number of false detections remained low. In the first <b>video</b> <b>file,</b> there were fewer than 0. 009 false detections per frame. In the second <b>video</b> <b>file,</b> there were fewer than 0. 08 false detections per frame. The number of faces that were correctly identified increased by 8 - 22 % in the two <b>video</b> <b>files</b> in default mode. In the first <b>video</b> <b>file,</b> there was also a large improvement in strict mode, as it went from recognising 13 % to 85 % of all faces. In the second <b>video</b> <b>file,</b> however,neither implementation managed to identify anyone in strict mode. The conclusion is that object tracking is a good tool for improving the accuracy of face recognition in video streams. Anyone implementing face recognition for video streams should consider using object tracking as a central component...|$|R
