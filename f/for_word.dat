40|$|Abstract: We used {{high-resolution}} fMRI {{to investigate}} claims that {{learning to read}} results in greater left occipito-temporal (OT) activation <b>for</b> written <b>words</b> relative to pictures of objects. In the first experiment, 9 / 16 subjects performing a one-back task showed activation in 1 left OT voxel <b>for</b> <b>words</b> relative to pictures (P < 0. 05 uncorrected). In a second experiment, another 9 / 15 subjects performing a semantic decision task activated 1 left OT voxel <b>for</b> <b>words</b> relative to pictures. However, at this low statistical threshold false positives need to be excluded. The semantic decision paradigm was therefore repeated, within subject, in two different scanners (1. 5 and 3 T). Both scanners consistently localised left OT activation <b>for</b> <b>words</b> relative to fixation and pictures relative to words, {{but there were no}} consistent effects <b>for</b> <b>words</b> relative to pictures. Finally, in a third experiment, we minimised the voxel size (1. 5 3 1. 5 3 1. 5 mm 3) and demonstrated a striking concordance between the voxels activated <b>for</b> <b>words</b> and pictures, irrespective of task (naming vs. one-back) or scrip...|$|R

Throughout the country, at least 5,081people {{lost their lives}} while another 1,9413,084were missing and presumed dead. This made Thelma the deadliest {{tropical}} cyclone in Philippine history, surpassing a storm in 1867 that killed 1,800, until later surpassed by Typhoon Haiyan (Yolanda) in 2013 which killed at least 6,300people. A total of 4,446homes were destroyed while another 22,229were damaged. Total losses amounted to $27.67million. Initially, it took over 24hours <b>for</b> <b>word</b> of the disaster to reach officials due to a crippled communication network around Ormoc City.

5|$|Initially, it {{took more}} than 24hours <b>for</b> <b>word</b> of the level of devastation to reach {{officials}} in Manila as communications across Leyte were largely destroyed. By November7, search and rescue operations were underway across Leyte and Negros Occidental. The first shipment of relief supplies, consisting of food rations, rice, sardines, and used clothing, was to be shipped from Cebu later that day. On November8, Philippine President Corazon Aquino declared all of Leyte a disaster area. A Philippine Navy vessel set out with heavy earth-moving machinery and the Philippine Air Force deployed aircraft to assist in rescue efforts. Relief efforts in Ormoc City were hampered by a lack of clear roads and fuel. Amateur radio reports stated that an AC-130 was able to land at a local airport but materials had to be moved by helicopter from there since roads were blocked. Relief efforts were also hampered by continuing rains and the rough terrain of the affected region. By November11, approximately 8,300families had been rescued and another 7,521were evacuated from affected regions.|$|E

While the U.S. 7th Armored Division was assigned static duty holding the right flank of the gains made during the failed Market Garden operation, the 104th Infantry Division was to assist the First Canadian Army in the taking of the Scheldt.

40|$|The left-lateralized N 170 {{component}} of ERPs <b>for</b> <b>words</b> compared with various control stimuli is considered as an electrophysiological manifestation of visual expertise <b>for</b> written <b>words.</b> To understand the information {{sensitivity of the}} effect, researchers distinguish between coarse tuning <b>for</b> <b>words</b> (the N 170 amplitude difference between words and symbol strings) and fine tuning <b>for</b> <b>words</b> (the N 170 amplitude difference between words and consonant strings). Earlier developmental ERP studies demonstrated that the coarse tuning <b>for</b> <b>words</b> occurred early in children (8 years old), whereas the fine tuning <b>for</b> <b>words</b> emerged much later (10 years old). Given that there are large individual differences in reading ability in young children, these tuning effects may emerge earlier than expected in some children. This study measured N 170 responses to words and control stimuli in {{a large group of}} 7 -year-olds that varied widely in reading ability. In both low and high reading ability groups, we observed the coarse neural tuning <b>for</b> <b>words.</b> More interestingly, we found that a stronger N 170 <b>for</b> <b>words</b> than consonant strings emerged in children with high but not low reading ability. Our study demonstrates {{for the first time that}} fine neural tuning for orthographic properties of words can be observed in young children with high reading ability, suggesting that the emergent age of this effect is much earlier than previously assumed. The modulation of this effect by reading ability suggests that fine tuning is flexible and highly related to experience. Moreover, we found a correlation between this tuning effect at left occipitotemporal electrodes and children's reading ability, suggesting that the fine tuning might be a biomarker of reading skills at the very beginning of learning to read...|$|R
