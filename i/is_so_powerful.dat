5|$|The 5 o'clock wave is {{a fictional}} theory on {{the reasons for}} Wagga Wagga's {{sporting}} success. According to the local urban myth, at precisely 5 o'clock arrives a giant wave which flushes a secret nutrient into the Murrumbidgee River following the release {{of water from the}} Blowering and Burrinjuck Dams. The wave is said to continue down river at high speed, and indeed visitors are told it <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>powerful</b> that surfers can ride it along the meandering river until it reaches the town of Narrandera.|$|E
25|$|Black {{holes are}} sites of immense {{gravitational}} attraction. Classically, the gravitation <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>powerful</b> that nothing, not even electromagnetic radiation, can {{escape from the}} black hole. It is yet unknown how gravity {{can be incorporated into}} quantum mechanics. Nevertheless, far from the black hole the gravitational effects can be weak enough for calculations to be reliably performed in the framework of quantum field theory in curved spacetime. Hawking showed that quantum effects allow black holes to emit exact black body radiation. The electromagnetic radiation is produced as if emitted by a black body with a temperature inversely proportional to the mass of the black hole.|$|E

On some occasions, Kelly has had to stop the reading as the client has become extremely emotional, with Kelly offering counselling instead, which she has been trained in. She has also said that intelligent people are easier to read as they have a larger pool of references to use to respond to her cues.|$|E

25|$|A {{number of}} magical powers and {{abilities}} have been showcased in Coven. Some abilities are inherent or reflexive to certain witches, that {{is they do}} not need to focus or concentrate. It is not rare for a witch to manifest more than three powers, though a Supreme is required to have at least seven (the Seven Wonders), though not necessarily all possible powers. It is said that the reason that a Supreme <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>powerful</b> is because she is the physical embodiment of many and or all powers. Witches are shown {{to be able to use}} their powers collectively. Certain abilities can also be triggered by certain events and substances. Voodoo and witchcraft practitioners share certain powers.|$|E
25|$|The Wicked Witch of the West also changes {{significantly}} between {{books and}} movie. In the books no mention is ever made {{of her skin}} color, whereas in the movie she is green without explanation, although the Winkies she has enslaved and turned into soldiers are also green. In the book it is implied but not stated that she dresses in yellow, as yellow is the official dominant color of the Winkie Country where she rules, whereas in the movie she dresses entirely in black. In the book she is portrayed as having only one eye, which <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>powerful</b> it could see distant objects like a telescope, but in the movie she uses a crystal ball to watch Dorothy and her friends from afar. The 1939 MGM film makes the first reference to The Witches of the East and West being sisters, which {{was not the case}} in the book; none of the Witches in Baum's Oz are related.|$|E

500|$|Exudations {{from the}} skin of the golden poison frog (Phyllobates terribilis) are {{traditionally}} used by native Colombians to poison the darts they use for hunting. The tip of the projectile is rubbed {{over the back of the}} frog and the dart is launched from a blowgun. The combination of the two alkaloid toxins batrachotoxin and homobatrachotoxin <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>powerful,</b> one frog contains enough poison to kill an estimated 22,000 mice. [...] Two other species, the Kokoe poison dart frog (Phyllobates aurotaenia) and the black-legged dart frog (Phyllobates bicolor) are also used for this purpose. These are less toxic and less abundant than the golden poison frog. They are impaled on pointed sticks and may be heated over a fire to maximise the quantity of poison that can be transferred to the dart.|$|E

Blige was initially considered for Keys' part on [...] "Empire State of Mind" [...] and admitted that he was [...] "two seconds away" [...] from asking Blige to appear on the record's chorus. His second choice for the track's vocals was Keys and that using Blige on the song would have been a safe move, but said that the combination of Keys' sound and piano talent had struck a chord with him.

500|$|John Glover characterizes Lionel as a {{businessman}} who is disappointed with his son. To Glover, Lionel is this [...] "rich and powerful businessman" [...] who sees his son as a [...] "wuss" [...] and [...] "fraidy-cat". It was important to Glover that Lionel appear as human as possible; Glover {{said he does not}} want to simply [...] "twirl [...] mustache". Glover described Lionel as a man who will do whatever he needs to do to get what he wants. He characterizes Lionel as an intelligent man who can read people easily. Lionel uses that ability to further his goals. The character can also get past people's defenses and manipulate them. Glover thinks that type of power would be great if it could be used to help someone other than Lionel. Lionel's character is also connoted by the color scheme that surrounds him; the use of cold blue tones helps to evoke the [...] "sinister" [...] nature of the character. Lionel is also often portrayed in front of a white or [...] "clinical blue" [...] background. Lionel's signature mane of hair is used to symbolize his power—by growing it out and refusing to style it, Lionel attempts to show he <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>powerful</b> that he can do whatever he wants without any backlash.|$|E
500|$|Batman's Batmobile was {{an aspect}} of the {{character}} that Rocksteady had wanted to include in its other Arkham games, but were limited by technical constraints. The designers, who worked in conjunction with DC, chose to look at their earlier design from Arkham Asylum, instead of models from the history of Batman comics and media, and evolve that to meet the necessary gameplay requirements. The vehicle was designed to integrate with Batman's on-foot traversal without being a burden; Hill stated, [...] "We didn't want it to be like, 'Okay, the Batmobile is so good I'll just stay in that all the time.' or 'Batman <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>powerful</b> gliding around I won't be using the Batmobile.' There's a definite need to use both of those." [...] The world's challenges were set out on the vertical and horizontal plane of the map to discourage players from using only one form of movement, with the Batmobile providing a faster method for moving large distances over gliding. Unlike Arkham Origins, Arkham Knight does not feature a fast travel system as the designers considered traversal {{to be part of the}} game, and allowing players to skip that would detract from the experience. Buildings hit by the vehicle suffer cosmetic damage without slowing the car, as it was considered that being impeded by a collision while turning a corner would diminish the fantasy of driving the Batmobile.|$|E

These include a maddening inconsistency, as well as an unwillingess to compromise or collaborate with others.

2500|$|Dundas {{remained}} {{in command of}} Naiad until 1808, serving in the blockade of Rochefort. Dundas went on to command the 64-gun , another Trafalgar veteran, and the 74-gun [...] He commissioned [...] on 28 March 1822, and was stationed at Plymouth. During his career Dundas {{is said to have}} invented a type of inflammable ball, ... applicable for besieging a town, and peculiar for its small weight, by which means may be thrown to a great distance; and it takes fire on a very curious plan: it spreads a flame on three distinct openings, which is so strong, that the fire extends a full yard in length from the ball itself, and <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>powerful,</b> that anything under, over, or near, cannot escape its effects.|$|E
2500|$|For {{commercial}} harvesting, collectors {{use either}} basking traps or hoop traps. The basking trap is a floating enclosures with sloping sides and a basking surface. Turtles {{are able to}} climb up the sloping sides onto the basking surface, but then when they jump off into the center, they can't get back out. Hoop traps are cylindrical mesh traps with a funnel opening. Hoop traps are submerged and turtles are attracted by bait. In Minnesota, trappers say that they prefer basking traps to target painted turtles and hoop traps for [...] "meat" [...] turtles (snapping turtles and softshell turtles). Minnesota harvest records also show a clear pattern of most painted turtles coming from basking traps and most softshell and snapping turtles from hoop traps. Three quantitative studies of basking traps also show they are more efficient than baited hoop traps for trapping painted turtles. Despite the many hours of night and cloudiness when the basking traps do not lure turtles, the painted turtle's drive to bask <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>powerful,</b> that on a per-day basis, these traps are twice as effective. Or, possibly, the basking traps are more effective since painted turtles frequently escape back out the funnel of hoop traps.|$|E

2500|$|Eggleston {{taught at}} Harvard in 1973 and 1974, {{and it was}} during these years that he {{discovered}} dye-transfer printing; he was examining the price list of a photographic lab in Chicago when he read about the process. As Eggleston later recalled: [...] "It advertised 'from the cheapest to the ultimate print.' The ultimate print was a dye-transfer. I went straight up there to look and everything I saw was commercial work like pictures of cigarette packs or perfume bottles but the colour saturation {{and the quality of}} the ink was overwhelming. I couldn't wait to see what a plain Eggleston picture would look like with the same process. Every photograph I subsequently printed with the process seemed fantastic and each one seemed better than the previous one." [...] The dye-transfer process resulted in some of Eggleston's most striking and famous work, such as his 1973 photograph entitled The Red Ceiling, of which Eggleston said, [...] "The Red Ceiling <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>powerful,</b> that in fact I've never seen it reproduced on the page to my satisfaction. When you look at the dye it is like red blood that's wet on the wall.... A little red is usually enough, but to work with an entire red surface was a challenge." ...|$|E
2500|$|Mating {{between a}} single drone {{and the queen}} lasts less than 5 seconds, and it is often {{completed}} within 1–2 seconds. Mating occurs mid-flight, and 10–40m above ground. [...] Since the queen mates with 12±7 drones, and drones die after mating, each drone must {{make the most of}} his single shot. The drone makes first contact from above the queen, his thorax above her abdomen, straddling her. [...] He then grasps her with all six legs, and everts the endophallus into her opened sting chamber. If the queen’s sting chamber is not fully opened, mating is unsuccessful, so some males that mount the queen do not transfer semen. Once the endophallus has been everted, the drone is paralyzed, flipping backwards as he ejaculates. [...] The process of ejaculation is explosive—semen is blasted through the queen’s sting chamber and into the oviduct. The process is sometimes audible to the human ear, akin to a [...] "popping" [...] sound. The ejaculation <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>powerful</b> that it ruptures the endophallus, disconnecting the drone from the queen. The bulb of the endophallus is broken off inside of the queen during mating—so drones mate only once, and die shortly after. The leftover penis remaining in the queen’s vagina {{is referred to as the}} “mating sign”. The plug will not prevent the next drone from mating with the same queen, but may prevent semen from flowing out of the vagina.|$|E
2500|$|Sebastian {{said in an}} {{interview}} in late 2009 that the songs for the album originally had a much more organic old school sound, as his US record company had wanted the album to have a similar sound to The Memphis Album. He said he didn't feel that was right for the Australian market, [...] "I ended up with a new record of original songs that didn't have quite the right production, like it all sounded quite old school, it didn't really have a modern edge to it. I ended up going back and reproducing everything which was quite a nightmare. I mean [...] "Like It Like That" [...] for example was really old school, like real drums, real organic, so we reproduced that and we got it to sound a little more modern, in your face I guess, the way it is now and we did that with a lot of the tracks so yeah, it was a bit of a nightmare getting to the final product". Sebastian said he felt he was exactly where he wanted to be creatively with this album: [...] "I'm in a really happy place musically, because this is exactly the style of music I want to do and that I've wanted to do for so long.
