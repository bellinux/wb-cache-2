5000|$|The story {{takes place}} {{primarily}} within Burland's capitol, a city once called [...] "Hart's Hope" [...] but eventually renamed Inwit. The city is notable for its multiple entrances, and the restrictions placed upon those who <b>enter</b> <b>through</b> those gates: a merchant who <b>enters</b> <b>through</b> the Asses' Gate is issued a pass which only allows him {{access to the}} commercial areas of the city, while a religious figure who <b>enters</b> <b>through</b> Gods' Gate can only visit the temples and so on. Beggars who <b>enter</b> <b>through</b> Piss Gate are granted a three-day pass during which to find work. And a certain gate, The Hole, has been specifically sealed off by the story's villain, so that nobody can <b>enter</b> <b>through</b> it save by magical or illicit means.|$|R

5|$|A 1937 {{survey of}} Kennedy's rebuilt church by the Royal Commission on Ancient and Historical Monuments in Wales and Monmouthshire {{said that it}} was formed from a {{continuous}} nave and chancel, measuring in total 43 by 15feet (13.3 by 4.7m). The church, which was at that time in good condition, was <b>entered</b> <b>through</b> a porch on the south side, and there was a vestry on the north side.

The fort is <b>entered</b> <b>through</b> a single gateway on its west side, protected against landward attackers by a caponier. The front of the fort was surrounded by a dry ditch, in which there were originally four caponiers to provide musketry defence. A very wide outer wet ditch blocked access from the riverside.|$|E
5|$|He was bailed {{from the}} police station on 13 September, after which he went on holiday to Saint-Tropez. Before leaving England, he {{returned}} to the farmhouse, gaining entry by the downstairs bathroom window. He said he did this because he had left his keys in London and needed some papers from the house for the trip to France; he <b>entered</b> <b>through</b> the window rather than borrow keys from the farm's housekeeper who lived nearby. When he returned to England on 29 September, he was re-arrested and charged with the murders.|$|E
5|$|In {{statements}} to the Polícia Judiciária, witnesses described men behaving oddly near apartment 5A {{in the days leading}} up to the disappearance and on the day itself. Scotland Yard came to believe that these men may have been engaged in reconnaissance, either for an abduction or a burglary. There had been a fourfold increase in local burglaries between January and May 2007, including two in the McCanns' block in the 17 days before the disappearance, during which burglars had <b>entered</b> <b>through</b> windows.|$|E

It also shows that young people declare that behind good performance there are effort, planning and clear goals...|$|R

5|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, as the Interstate Highway System was being built {{throughout}} the United States, east–west travel through western Maryland was difficult, as US40, the predecessor to I-68, was a two-lane country road with steep grades and hairpin turns. In Cumberland, the traffic situation was particularly problematic, as {{the usage of}} US40 exceeded {{the capacity of the}} city's narrow streets. Traffic following US40 through Cumberland <b>entered</b> <b>through</b> the Cumberland Narrows and followed Henderson Avenue to Baltimore Avenue. After the construction of I-68, this route through Cumberland became US40 Alternate (US40 Alt.).|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, Margaret Chaloner, {{wife of the}} first Lord Gisborough, laid out formal gardens of a typical late-Victorian and Edwardian design with {{elaborate}} bedding schemes and gravelled paths.

They were {{open to the public}} for a small fee and could be <b>entered</b> <b>through</b> a gateway on Bow Street. The gardens are now freely accessible.|$|E
5|$|The Tariff Court {{is a large}} {{rectangular}} enclosure {{south of}} the agora and sharing its northern wall with it.

The court gained its name by containing a 5 meters long stone slab that had the Palmyrene tax law inscribed on it.|$|E

5|$|The choir is <b>entered</b> <b>through</b> {{a screen}} {{designed}} by George Gilbert Scott, with gates made by Skidmore. The rood {{was designed by}} Scott, and was made by F.Stuflesser. The bishop’s throne or “cathedra” was designed by Scott to complement the choir stalls. It was constructed by Farmer and Brindley in 1876. The reredos and the floor mosaic date from 1876, and were designed by J.R.Clayton. The east window has tracery of an elegant Decorated Gothic design which is filled with stained glass of 1884 by Heaton, Butler and Bayne.|$|E

After discussing if Ruskin's presence can harm Monk, Natalie (Traylor Howard) and Monk find the crime's weapon. Monk finds the same glitter he found on Cullman's hair in the gun and argues the thief stole the watch to replace his one, deducing that the same person committed both crimes.|$|E

5|$|A further {{elaboration}} on {{this story}} is possibly found in a chronicle of Wincenty Kadłubek written some three centuries later. The chronicler, inadvertently or intentionally mixing different historic eras, talks of a past Polish war with the army of Alexander the Great. The countless enemy soldiers thrust their way into Poland, and the king himself, having previously subjugated the Pannonians, <b>entered</b> <b>through</b> Moravia {{as if it were}} a back door. He victoriously unfolded the wings of his forces and conquered the Kraków area lands and Silesia, in the process leveling Kraków's ancient city walls. The evidence of a dozen or more gords attacked and destroyed in southern Lesser Poland at the end of 9th century lends some archeological credence to this fanciful version of events.|$|E

50|$|Glucose in {{the body}} {{increases}} after food consumption. This is primarily due to carbohydrate intake, but to a much lesser degree protein intake (http://jcem.endojournals.org/content/89/6/3048.long)(http://genesdev.cshlp.org/content/24/24/2717.long). Depending on the tissue type, the glucose <b>enters</b> the cell <b>through</b> facilitated or passive diffusion. In muscle and adipose tissue, glucose <b>enters</b> <b>through</b> GLUT 4 receptors via facilitated diffusion (http://ajpendo.physiology.org/content/299/2/E169.long).
