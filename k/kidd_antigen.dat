50|$|The <b>Kidd</b> <b>antigen</b> system (also {{known as}} Jk antigen) is {{present on the}} {{membranes}} of red blood cells and the kidney and helps determine a person's blood type. The Jk antigen is found on a protein responsible for urea transport in the red blood cells and the kidney. The gene encoding this protein is found on chromosome 18. Three Jk alleles are Jk(a), Jk(b)and Jk3. Jk (a) was discovered by Allen et al. in 1951 and is named after a patient (Mrs Kidd delivered a baby with a haemolytic disease of the newborn associated with an antibody directed against a new antigen Jka). Whereas Jk (b) was discovered by Plant et al. in 1953, individuals who lack the Jk antigen (Jk null) are unable to maximally concentrate their urine.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Kidd</b> <b>antigens</b> {{are located}} on a red blood cell urea {{transporter}} (aka human urea transporter 11- HUT11 or UT-B1). As red blood cells approach the renal medulla (where {{there is a high}} concentration of urea), the urea transporter allows for rapid uptake of urea and prevents cell shrinkage in the hypertonic environment of the medulla. As the red cell leaves the medulla, the urea is transported back out of the cell, preventing cellular swelling and preventing the urea from being carried away from the kidney. [...] HUT11 was detected on endothelial cells of the vasa recta (vascular supply of the renal medulla) but it is not present in renal tubules.|$|R
40|$|Background—Anemia, {{a common}} {{condition}} among critically ill premature infants, {{is affected by}} red blood cell (RBC) survival (RCS). We hypothesized that transfused allogeneic <b>Kidd</b> <b>antigen</b> mismatched RBCs would demonstrate the same concurrent RCS tracking as RBCs multi-labeled at separate, discrete low densities with biotin (BioRBCs). Methods—Allogeneic RBCs from adult donors were labeled at four biotin densities, mixed, and transfused into 17 anemic premature infants. Nine of the donors and neonates were <b>Kidd</b> <b>antigen</b> mismatched. Serial post-transfusion blood samples were assayed for up to eight weeks by flow cytometry to track {{the survival of the}} proportions of <b>Kidd</b> <b>antigen</b> mismatched and biotinylated RBCs. Results—Using linear mixed modeling to compare results, RCS of the three lowest BioRBC densities was similar to RCS by <b>Kidd</b> <b>antigen</b> mismatch and to one another. RCS of RBCs labeled at the highest BioRBC density was shortened. Conclusions—RCS of different populations of RBCs can be tracked concurrently and reliably using the three lowest BioRBC densities. Although comparable RCS results can be achieved usin...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{investigate}} {{the prevalence of}} Kidd antigens among pregnant women in Sokoto, North Western Nigeria. MethodsOne hundred and sixty two pregnant women aged 18 - 45 years [mean age (27. 19 ± 4. 72) years] attending antenatal clinic in Usmanu Danfodiyo University Teaching Hospital, Sokoto, were screened {{for the presence of}} Kidd blood group antigens using the conventional tube method and anti-Jka and Jkb reagents (Lorne Laboratories, UK). ResultsOut of the 162 pregnant women tested, 82 (50. 6 %) were Hausa, 26 (16 %) were Igbo, 23 (14. 2 %) were Fulani and 20 (12. 3 %) were Yoruba while the minority ethnic groups were 11 (6. 8 %). The distribution of <b>Kidd</b> <b>antigen</b> was compared based on the ethnic groups of subjects. Jka antigen was the highest among the Yoruba ethnic group (10. 0 %) followed by the Hausa ethnic group (7. 31 %). The prevalence of Jkb was highest among Hausa subjects (10. 97 %) followed by the Yoruba ethnic group (10. 0 %). Subjects were categorized based on parity. Majority of the subjects were multigravidae, 122 (75. 3 %) compared to primigravidae 40 (24. 7 %). Subjects were stratified based on trimester. A significant number of women were in the second trimester, 111 (68. 5 %) compared to the third trimester 38 (23. 5 %) and the first 13 (8. 0 %). The distribution of Kidd antigens among subjects studied indicated a prevalence of Jka, Jkb and Jk(a+b+) with 8 (4. 9 %), 13 (8. 0 %) and 0 (0. 0 %), respectively. A significant number of subject tested were negative for Kidd antigens. Of the 162 pregnant women tested, 154 (95. 1 %), 149 (75. 3 %) and 141 (87. 04 %) tested were negative for Jka, Jkb, and Jk(a-b-), respectively. ConclusionsThis study indicates that blood group antigens can be distributed differently within different nationalities. Kidd phenotypes observed among pregnant women in this study was similar to previous reports among blacks but at variance with report among Caucasians and Asians. We recommend that detailed routine phenotyping for all clinically significant red cell antigen including <b>Kidd</b> <b>antigen</b> being carried out routinely among all pregnant women in Nigeria. There is also the need to routinely screen all pregnant women for alloantibodies to facilitate the selection of antigen negative units for those with clinically significant alloantibodies who require a red cell transfusion. This can potentially optimise the obstetric management of haemolytic disease of foetus and newborn and prevent haemolytic transfusion reaction among pregnant women...|$|E

40|$|The <b>Kidd</b> {{blood group}} <b>antigens,</b> Jkª and Jkᵇ, {{are two of}} the main surface markers which are found on the {{membrane}} of red blood cells. The determination of whether a donor or a recipient has the Jkª and/or the Jkᵇ antigens is crucially important to have a successful transfusion without the development of adverse incompatibility-related reactions. In Malta, routine serological-based tests are applied with the purpose of differentiating between homozygous and heterozygous states for the Jk antigens respectively. Although these tests are highly specific and sensitive, there are particular clinical scenarios where haemagglutination assays are not suitable for determining the individual’s Kidd blood group status. Additionally, the alternative genotyping procedure has never been applied in Malta within the context of blood grouping. The current study was therefore carried out to determine whether a molecular-based technique such as Polymerase Chain Reaction – Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism analysis (PCR-RFLP) is a suitable alternative procedure for distinguishing amongst the three different Kidd phenotypes. After extracting deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) from 50 blood samples obtained from serologically-tested healthy blood donors who expressed {{at least one of the}} <b>Kidd</b> <b>antigens,</b> PCR-RFLP analyses were carried out. The results of the latter were then compared with those previously obtained with haemagglutination and a complete match was observed between the two. Therefore, this PCR-RFLP method was confirmed as a suitable alternative laboratory technique that can be used to determine efficiently the Kidd blood group of both donors and recipients, in an accurate manner without subjectivity as encountered in the case of haemagglutination. This research further facilitates the introduction of molecular-based techniques in molecular blood transfusion. peer-reviewe...|$|R
40|$|AbstractTwo hundred twenty-four {{patients}} with leukemia transplanted with an unrelated donor between 1991 and 2003 at the Karolinska University Hospital were analyzed according to association between graft failure and ABO, RhD, MNSs, and <b>Kidd</b> blood group <b>antigen</b> compatibility. Median age was 29 years (range: 0 - 55). Conditioning consisted of total-body irridiation or busulfan-based myeloablative conditioning. A bone marrow graft {{was given to}} 152 patients, and 72 patients received peripheral blood stem cells. Most patients received graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis with cyclosporine and MTX. Graft failure (GF) was seen in 6 (2. 7 %) patients. In the multivariate analysis major ABO mismatch (odds ratio [OR] 14. 9, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 2. 01 - 110, P =. 008) and HLA-allele mismatch (6. 42, 1. 19 - 34. 8, P =. 03) was significantly associated to GF. In {{patients with}} and without major ABO mismatch the incidence of GF was 7. 5 % and 0. 6 % (P =. 02), respectively. Using an ABO major mismatched graft increases the risk for GF after unrelated donor hematopoietic stem cell transplantation...|$|R
40|$|Humoral alloimmunization to {{red blood}} cell (RBC) antigens is a {{clinically}} significant problem {{that can lead to}} transfusion reactions and difficulty in locating future compatible blood for transfusion. However, factors regulating responder/nonresponder status are only partially understood. Herein, we identify a series of microbes with 100 % identity in 8 – to 9 –amino acid peptides containing the variant amino acids in Kell, <b>Kidd,</b> and Duffy <b>antigens.</b> To test the hypothesis that infection with such a microbe could predispose to RBC alloimmunization, a mouse model was developed using murine polyoma virus expressing a defined CD 4 + T-cell epitope ovalbumin 323 - 339 ((OVA) 323 - 339) and subsequent transfusion with RBCs expressing a B-cell epitope (hen egg lysozyme [HEL]) fused to (OVA) 323 - 339. Whereas infection alone induced no detectable anti-HEL, subsequent RBC transfusion induced 100 - to 1000 -fold more anti-HEL in mice that had been previously infected compared with control mice. This effect did not occur with wild-type polyoma virus or RBCs expressing HEL alone. Together, these data indicate that prior exposure to a pathogen with small peptide homology to RBC antigens can lead to an enhanced primary alloantibody response. As such priming is not detectable by current clinical tests, it is unknown to what extent this occurs in human alloimmunization...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The <b>Kidd</b> {{blood group}} <b>antigens</b> Jk(a) and Jk(b) are encoded {{by the red}} blood cell (RBC) urea {{transporter}} gene. Homozygosity for silent JK alleles results in the rare Jk(a-b-) phenotype. To date, seven JK(null) alleles have been identified, and of these, two are more frequent in the Polynesians and Finns. This study reports the identification of other JK(null) alleles in Jk(a-b-) individuals of different ethnic or geographic origins. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Nine Jk(a-b-) samples and a sample from a Jk(a-b+) mother of a Jk(a+b-) baby were investigated. Polymerase chain reaction amplification and sequence analysis of the JK gene was performed. Western blotting and urea lysis were used to confirm Jk(a-b-) RBCs. RESULTS: Four novel alleles were identified: two different nonsense mutations, 202 C > T (Gln 68 Stop) and 723 delA (Ile 262 Stop) were identified on otherwise consensus JK* 1 and JK* 2 alleles, respectively. A missense mutation, 956 C > T (Thr 319 Met), was identified in a JK* 1 allele from an African-American and a JK* 2 allele in two people of subcontinental Indian descent. Immunoblotting and urea lysis confirmed absence of JK glycoprotein in RBC membranes from a sample carrying the 956 C > T mutation. Other previously described JK(null) mutations were found in samples of origins other than {{in which they were}} first identified. CONCLUSION: The molecular bases of the Jk(a-b-) phenotype are diverse {{and this is the first}} report of JK(null) alleles in individuals of African and subcontinental Indian descent. Although rare, these alleles should be taken into consideration when planning genotyping strategies for blood donors and patients...|$|R
