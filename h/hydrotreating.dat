While these processes are not without problems, they are currently in practice around the world.

500|$|The {{shale oil}} derived from oil shale does not {{directly}} substitute for crude oil in all applications. It may contain higher concentrations of olefins, oxygen, and nitrogen than conventional crude oil. [...] Some shale oils may have higher sulfur or arsenic content. By comparison with West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark standard for crude oil in the futures-contract market, the Green River shale oil sulfur content ranges from near 0% to 4.9% (in average 0.76%), where West Texas Intermediate's sulfur content has a maximum of 0.42%. The sulfur content in shale oil from Jordan's oil shales may rise even up to 9.5%. [...] The arsenic content, for example, becomes an issue for Green River formation oil shale. The higher concentrations of these materials means that the oil must undergo considerable upgrading (<b>hydrotreating)</b> before serving as oil-refinery feedstock. [...] Above-ground retorting processes tended to yield a lower API gravity shale oil than the in situ processes. Shale oil serves best for producing middle-distillates such as kerosene, jet fuel, and diesel fuel. Worldwide demand for these middle distillates, particularly for diesel fuels, increased rapidly in the 1990s and 2000s. [...] However, appropriate refining processes equivalent to hydrocracking can transform shale oil into a lighter-range hydrocarbon (gasoline).|$|E

50|$|Algae {{can be used}} {{to produce}} 'green diesel' (also known as {{renewable}} diesel, <b>hydrotreating</b> vegetable oil or hydrogen-derived renewable diesel) through a <b>hydrotreating</b> refinery process that breaks molecules down into shorter hydrocarbon chains used in diesel engines. It has the same chemical properties as petroleum-based diesel meaning that it does not require new engines, pipelines or infrastructure to distribute and use. It has yet to be produced at a cost that is competitive with petroleum. While <b>hydrotreating</b> is currently the most common pathway to produce fuel-like hydrocarbons via decarboxylation/decarbonylation, there is an alternative process offering a number of important advantages over <b>hydrotreating.</b> In this regard, the work of Crocker et al. and Lercher et al. is particularly noteworthy. For oil refining, research is underway for catalytic conversion of renewable fuels by decarboxylation. As the oxygen is present in crude oil at rather low levels, of the order of 0.5%, deoxygenation in petroleum refining is not of much concern, and no catalysts are specifically formulated for oxygenates <b>hydrotreating.</b> Hence, one of the critical technical challenges to make the hydrodeoxygenation of algae oil process economically feasible is related to the research and development of effective catalysts.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{share of}} diesel fuel in European {{transport}} sector, which currently represents over 50 % of total 11 demand, is increasing, requiring massive imports of this product, {{while at the}} same time, gasoline fuels are 12 today in surplus. In terms of air pollutant emissions, gasoline and kerosene streams have shown potential 13 in achieving lower emissions in Compression Ignition (CI) engines, particularly nitrogen oxides (NOx) 14 and particulates. A new fuel formulation approach through the use of light fractions within diesel 15 technology could consequently address both questions of energy demand balance and reduction of diesel 16 engines pollution footprint. In this study, a fuel formulation for a Diesel engine is optimized to achieve 17 lower pollutants emissions and higher engine efficiency. The fuel matrix is based on seven refinery 18 streams representative of gasoline (<b>Hydrotreated</b> Straight-Run Gasoline HSRG, <b>Hydrotreated</b> Fluid 19 Catalytic Cracking HFCC and Reformate REF), kerosene (<b>Hydrotreated</b> Straight-Run Kerosene HSRK 20 and Hydrocracked Kerosene HCKK) and diesel cuts (<b>Hydrotreated</b> Straight-Run Diesel HSRD and 21 Hydrocracked Light Diesel HCKLD). A D-Optimal mixture design is applied to build, a 12 -run, 7 -factor fuelmatrix and the fuels are thoroughly optimized on two engine conditions at light and mid-load representativeof typical vehicle running conditions. The results show a high sensitivity and a good correlation ofthe engine efficiency and pollutants emissions with the volumetric contribution of each refinery streamto the fuel composition. The optimum fuel composition varies across the range of engine operatingpoints. At light load for example, the addition of up to 50 vol% of gasoline streams (HSRG and HFCC) todiesel streams demonstrates a good potential to simultaneously reduce NOx and particulate emission...|$|R
