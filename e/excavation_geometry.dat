40|$|To {{understand}} and predict the in situ brittle rock mass damage process induced by a coupled thermo-mechanical loading, {{the knowledge of}} rock mass yielding strength, scaling relationship between laboratory and in situ and microstructure characterization is required. Difficulties have been recognized due to the seldom availability of in situ experiment and appropriate numerical methodologies. The A"spo Pillar Stability Experiment was used to monitor the evolution of rock mass damage in a pillar of rock separating two 1. 75 -m diameter vertical boreholes. The loading of the pillar was controlled using the in situ stresses, <b>excavation</b> <b>geometry,</b> and locally increasing the rock temperature. The induced loading resulted in a complex discontinuum process that involved fracture initiation, propagation, interaction and buckling, all dominated by a tensile mechanism. Tracking this damage process {{was carried out in}} two steps. Initially, a three-dimensional numerical model was used to generate the stresses from the <b>excavation</b> <b>geometry</b> and thermal loading. The plane strain stresses, at selected locations where detailed displacement monitoring was available, were then used to track the evolution of damage caused by these induced stresses. The grain-based discrete element modeling approach described in Lan et al. (2010), which captures the grain scale heterogeneity of the rock, was used to establish the extent of damage. Good agreement was found between the predicted and measured temperatures and displacements. The grain-based model provided new insights into the progressive failure process...|$|E

Finding the optimal shape for an excavation based on stress distribution has practical significance in increasing stability and lowering support costs. This paper presents {{a new approach}} to the optimization of underground excavation shapes using an evolutionary structural optimization (ESO) procedure. Illustrated examples show that the ESO method is applicable to the optimization of underground excavation shapes. Both two- and three-dimensional cases are considered and compared with theoretical solutions. Optimal shapes of underground excavations under different virgin stress states are also presented...|$|E

To aid {{in the interpretation of}} field measurements, an elaborate simulation of stage excavation by finite elements was performed. The deformation modulus thus backfigured generally correlates with the design values previously determined in the field and laboratory testing of the subsoil.

Factors such as <b>excavation</b> <b>geometry,</b> soil properties, and the presence of shallow bedrock are examined, along with their impact on ground movement during excavation.

40|$|Theoretical depths, {{volumes of}} excavation, hinge radii, {{ejection}} angles and transient structural rim uplifts are calculated, for comparison with experimental and field data from impact and explosion craters, {{by means of}} a Maxwell Z-model cratering flow field originating at non-zero depths-of-burst. It is found that the formation of a hinge, about which the coherent ejecta flap rotates at the rim of the transient crater, divides material in the flow field into ejected and downward and outward-driven portions. Ejected material originates from an <b>excavation</b> cavity whose <b>geometry</b> is distinct from that of the transient crater. The shallow depths of excavation both observed in impact and explosion craters and predicted by the Z-model flow fields imply that thickness estimates of such lunar geologic units as the maria basalts, which are determined by assuming that excavation depths are similar to (1) final or (2) transient crater depths, must be reduced by factors of two to three respectively. It is concluded that lunar basin excavation cavities exhibit proportional growth, and have maximum depths of excavation near 0. 1 the diameter of the basin transient crater...|$|R
40|$|Knowing the {{strength}} properties of rocks {{is essential for}} calculating the stability of natural slopes, constructions in and on rock, <b>excavations,</b> blasting <b>geometry,</b> crushing, and drilling. When rock and rock masses are subjected to either dynamic or static loads, the tensile strength is determined by tests appropriate to the load type. Static tests include both indirect tests, such as the Brazilian test, and direct tests like the dumbbell-shaped direct pull. Conventional dynamic tests are the Hopkinson pressure bar and ultrasonic methods. This work has two objectives: (1) to characterize diverse rocks in terms of dynamic and static tensile failure behavior, and (2) to conduct problem-based research for minimizing the generation of fines by-product in rock fragmentation and comminution. Two major processes of aggregate production are blasting and crushing operations. The rock is subjected mainly to tensile stresses and failure in both processes. A method for measuring the quantity of rock fines was suggested for the Brazilian test. A working hypothesis for {{reducing the amount of}} rock fines in the Brazilian test was examined. Moreover, an analytical solution for discs subjected to the Brazilian test was also presented; this facilitates an accurate analysis of the Brazilian test for anisotropic rocks. Also, a Hopkinson pressure bar was constructed and then modified to measure the dynamic uniaxial tensile strength of rock cores in which rock fails in pure tension. Results showed that, for a specific type of rock, generation of fines depends on the tensile strength of the rock. The higher the tensile strength, the higher is the percentage of fines produced. The working hypothesis that reduction of {{the strength}} of rock through water saturation should reduce fines generation was examined and shown to be true for the rocks tested. The dynamic uniaxial tensile strength of gneiss and granodiorite was approximately the same as the static strength from the Brazilian test. Moreover, analytical solution showed that significant errors can be avoided by using the solution for determining the indirect tensile strength of anisotropic rocks...|$|R

This scale model was produced for experimental activity. A measuring chain was made to analyze the thermal field in various types of soils, by varying the electrical current through the line source.

30|$|The arching {{effect has}} been {{demonstrated}} by several authors through field measurements or analytical and numerical models. Important studies on this topic include that of Li and Aubertin [3], which {{presents the results of}} large-scale numerical investigations focused on stope geometry and backfill properties. They conclude that the greatest effect on stress distribution within backfill results from the cohesion (c) and the friction angle (^') of the backfill. However, the values of the earth pressure coefficient (K) used in these studies were obtained from the geotechnical engineering literature, particularly from analyses involving retaining walls, that applied values such as the Rankin, Coulomb and at-rest earth pressure coefficients [5]. These analytical methods were based on simplifying assumptions that excluded the possibly important variations in K resulting from changes in the geomechanical parameters (e.g., E and c) and <b>excavation</b> <b>geometry,</b> thereby affecting the accuracy of the stress distribution models.|$|E
40|$|The {{basement}} of the Stata Center building on the MIT campus required 12. 8 m deep excavations covering a large open-plan site and underlain by more than 25 m of lightly overconsolidated Boston Blue Clay. The excavations were supported by a floating, perimeter diaphragm and braced with a system of internal corner struts, rakers, and tieback anchors. The project involved a complex sequence of berms, access ramps, and phased construction of the concrete mat foundation. One of the key goals of the design was to limit ground movements {{in order to prevent}} damage to adjacent structures, including the Alumni Pool building, which was founded on shallow caissons and located less than 1. 5 m from the south wall. Lateral wall movements and building settlements were closely monitored throughout construction, while photos from a network of webcams located around the open-plan site provide a detailed time history of the construction processes. This paper describes the development of a comprehensive three-dimensional (3 D) finite-element (FE) model for the Stata Center basement excavation, which has been enabled by recent advances made available in a FE software package, including efficient multicore iterative solving capabilities, importing of geometric data from computer-aided design files, and use of embedded pile elements to represent tieback anchors. The analyses highlight the effects of the 3 D <b>excavation</b> and support <b>geometry</b> on wall and ground movements. The base case results using a simple elasto-plastic Mohr–Coulomb soil model with undrained conditions in the clay are generally in very good agreement with measured performance. The effects of refined constitutive modeling and partial drainage within the clay have a secondary role in numerical predictions for this project. Republic of Kazakhstan (Bolashak Scholarship...|$|R
40|$|The {{progress}} of excavation {{work has been}} regularly recorded by taking images during the excavation seasons of Finnish Jabal Haroun Project. This multitemporal archaeological imagery is collected during 1998 - 2003. Images have been taken daily from the archaeological excavation site, namely the monastic complex of St. Aaron located near Petra, in Jordan. The images have been taken with non-metric digital camera and with non-metric video camera with varying imaging strategies. Large amount of images are convergent panoramic images taken by rotating the camera on the tripod around the projection center. Also separate images and some stereo pairs are available. The aim in the project has been to develop simple documentation methods for archaeologists and therefore minimum preparations are needed during the fieldwork to minimize the disturbance for excavation work. Use of signalised control points is minimized. During <b>excavation</b> season basic <b>geometry</b> of the site has been measured with a tacheometer. In some cases natural control points have been measured with the tacheometer and marked on the printouts. The 3 D tacheometer data {{can be used for}} solving the orientation parameters. The possibilities to use the collected imagery are presented. The {{progress of}} excavation is visualized in one example area – the chapel. The images have been organized by date and their rough orientation relating to the chapel is known. The images are taken from different angles relating to the excavation trenches (the chapel has been excavated in several steps). Therefore a simplified 3 D model is used as a visual aid to show the orientation relating to the model. The user can study the available imagery and select the appropriate images for further processing. The original image orientation can be re-fined in case the images are utilized for detailed modelling of the site.

40|$|International audienceThe present paper {{addresses}} {{an approach}} for merging heritage survey and archaeological knowledge. The theoretical framework is the integration between photogrammetric survey and documentation process, practically used in different archaeological <b>excavation.</b> Merging surveyed <b>geometries</b> and knowledge {{is a complex}} task. Many variables {{have to be considered}} during the process of merging. Photogrammetric survey results and knowledge can be actually seen as information. Information is sorted by source. A source is a set of information provided by the operators involved in the excavation process. Such operators can be archaeologists, photogrammetrists, or any other researcher (i. e. a topographist) involved in the study. The merging process involves the verification of the consistency of different sources and the aggregation of all the information from the sources into a global result. Each source, respectively each operator, owns a personal representation of his knowledge domain, a photogrammetrist uses geometrical primitive and 3 D representations of the object surveyed, an archaeologist has a textual and semantic representation of the objects. Merging together all these sets of information needs a tool which can be easily operated by most {{of the participants in the}} research and which can furthermore manage the ‘multiple knowledge' on the surveyed object. This tool, called Ametist, an acronym standing for Arpenteur ManagEment Tool for Interactive Survey Treatment, uses a simple interface for displaying results and knowledge in various form (textual, 2 D map, 3 D scene, XML). This tool can make an automatic merging of the “multiple knowledge” and its merge engine can solve conflicts (object identification mismatch, measure of an object taken several times, spatial collisions etc.). When conflicts cannot automatically be solved the application can report about inconsistency errors and ask a user to manually correct the information involved. As inconsistency can be present in any information, all operators have to be able to use the interface. The tool provides a simple easy to use interface. This document will first address the concept of knowledge based photogrammetry (with ARPENTEUR) and then deal with a presentation of ‘Ametist'. Finally, a real case study will be considered to highlight the first results of such a system in the frame of a French Italian scientific partnership with the “Dipartimento di Studi storici e Geografici” of the University of Florence, in charge of the archaeological research. The selected case study is the Castle of Shawbak, in Jordan, known in medieval written sources as the “Crac de Montréal”...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{the driving}} of {{underground}} openings, two main factors {{are to be}} borne in mind. First, the existence of failed rock and second, the control of displacements. The general problem devolves into questions of <b>excavation</b> <b>geometry,</b> sequence and support specification while adverse performance of the rock mass in the post-excavation stress field {{may be caused by}} either failure of the medium or slip on the weakness planes. During the excavation of the southern section of the Gotthard Base Tunnel, the rock mass response to TBM tunneling activities described unusual magnitudes of displacements in so far as the thrust of themachine couldn’t overcome the shield’s frictional forces. A smooth-blasting technique was implemented so that pressures on it went back to a sustainable magnitude.

40|$|AbstractDeep {{excavation}} {{works are}} carried out to construct underground infrastructures such as deep basements, subways, and service tunnels. The execution of these deep excavation works {{requires the use of}} retaining walls and bracing systems. Inadequate support systems have always been of major concern, as excessive ground movement induced during excavation could cause damage to neighboring structures, resulting in delays, disputes, and cost overruns. To {{gain a better understanding of}} the mechanisms involved in soil excavations, centrifuge model tests of deep excavations in slightly over-consolidated soft clay have been carried out using a newly developed testing system, in which the construction sequence of a multi-propped wall for deep excavations can be simulated in flight. Deformation mechanisms are observed using Particle Image Velocimetry. Settlements of the ground surface and changes in pore water pressure are monitored during the excavation. The effects of prop stiffness, wall rigidity, and <b>excavation</b> <b>geometry</b> on the characteristics of ground deformation and soil–structure interaction are demonstrated and discussed.

40|$|This study aims at {{evaluating}} the likely effect of high stress regime within the rocks of the Birimian Supergroup of Ghana, dated middle Precambrian and offer remediation strategies. The stress levels were therefore assessed between 26 -level to 50 -levels (i. e., 755 to 1500 m deep) within the deepest {{mine in the}} formation. Results indicated that pre-and-post mining stresses levels were 75 and 200 MPa, respectively. These levels are quite high and could induce stress related instabilities. Fundamental studies of failure behaviour of the rockmass show that elevated stress regime of this kind poses great potential for eminent rock bursting within the Birimian. Such situations demand concerted efforts of strategic mine design measures, including modified <b>excavation</b> <b>geometry</b> and destressing or preconditioning. These methods could be exploited to extend the normal zone of stress induced fractured rock to a greater depth ahead of the excavation face. Support could be improved further by adopting higher rockbolting density or tougher mesh together with shortcrete. If the excavation becomes prone to moderate rockbursting, provision of appropriate support structure can also be made either to limit the bulking process or reduce excessive rock deformation...|$|E
40|$|The French National Radioactive Waste Management Agency (Andra) {{began in}} 2000 the {{construction}} of an Underground Research Laboratory (URL) with the main goal of demonstrating the feasibility of a geological repository in Callovo-Oxfordian claystone. Several research programs have taken place to improve the knowledge of the rock properties and its response to the excavation progress. A network of experimental drifts has been constructed with variations on: <b>excavation</b> method, structure <b>geometry,</b> supports system and orientations with respect to principal stresses’ directions. In each drift different sections have been instrumented to monitor the hydro-mechanical behavior of the rock mass formation. Continuous monitoring of the excavated zone around the drifts in the main level (- 490 m) revealed the development of a fractured zone (extensional and shear fractures) induced by the excavation. The extent of this fractured zone depends on the drift orientation regarding the in-situ stress field. Accordingly, the convergence measurements showed an anisotropic closure which depends also on the drifts’ orientations. Moreover, marked overpressures and an anisotropic pore pressure field around the drifts have been also observed. The approach proposed in this work is mainly based on a direct analysis of the convergence measurements, for studying the anisotropic response of the rock formation during and after excavation. The convergence evolution is analyzed {{on the basis of the}} semi-empirical law proposed by Sulem et al. (1987) [Int J Rock Mech Min Sci Geomech Abstr 24 : 145 – 154]. The monitoring and analysis of convergence data can provide a reliable approach of the interaction between rock mass and support. Therefore, the anisotropy and the variability of the closure are analyzed taking into account different field cases: drifts excavated in two different orientations (i. e. influence of the initial stress state), different methods, sizes and rates of excavation and different supports systems with different conditions of installation. This broad range of cases permits to refine the analysis for reliable predictions of the convergence evolution in the long term. This approach can thus be used for the design of various types of support and the evaluation of its performance in the long term. On the other hand, the pore pressure evolution induced by excavation of drifts as recorded in situ has been analyzed. The anisotropic response observed in-situ suggests that the intrinsic anisotropy of the material plays a key role in the response of the rock formation. To understand these phenomena, an anisotropic poroelastic analysis of the pore pressure evolution induced by the drift excavation is performed. The main goal is to simulate the main trends of the pore pressure evolution with a simple model taking into account the inherent anisotropy of the material. Finally, an analysis of the onset of failure shows the key role of the hydro-mechanical coupling on the extension of the failed zone around the driftsL'Agence nationale pour la gestion des déchets radioactifs (Andra) a commencé en 2000 la construction du Laboratoire Souterrain de Meuse / Haute-Marne (LS-M/HM) avec l'objectif principal de démontrer la faisabilité d’un stockage géologique dans l’argilite du Callovo-Oxfordien. Un réseau de galeries expérimentales a été excavé, principalement en suivant les directions des contraintes horizontales (majeure et mineure), avec des variations sur : la méthode d'excavation, la géométrie de la structure et le soutènement. Chaque galerie a été instrumentée en différentes sections pour suivre le comportement hydromécanique de la roche face à l’excavation. Le suivi de la zone autour des galeries excavées au niveau principal (- 490 m) a révélé le développement d'une zone fracturée (fractures en extension et en cisaillement) induite par l'excavation. La distribution de la zone fracturée dépend à la fois de l'orientation de la galerie et du champ de contraintes in-situ et a une influence importante sur la déformation des galeries. En effet, les mesures de convergence ont montré une fermeture anisotrope de la section de la galerie. De plus, il a été observé un champ de distribution anisotrope de la pression de pores ainsi que des surpressions autour des galeries. Afin d’analyser la réponse anisotrope du massif pendant l’excavation et après celle-ci, les travaux effectués dans le cadre de la thèse sont axés principalement sur une étude directe des mesures de convergence in-situ. Cette analyse s’effectue à l’aide de la loi semi-empirique proposée par Sulem et al. (1987) [Int J Rock Mech Min Sci Geomech Abstr 24 : 145 – 154]. A cet égard, différentes galeries excavées dans le LS-M/HM ont été étudiées. Ces galeries présentent certaines différences dans leurs orientations et l’état initial des contraintes, dans la méthode et la vitesse d’excavation ainsi que dans les diamètres de la section et les types de soutènements installées. Cette analyse permet d’obtenir des prédictions fiables de la convergence à long-terme, ce qui peut servir pour le dimensionnement et la prévision de la performance du soutènement à long-terme. En outre, nous avons étudié la réponse anisotrope du champ de pression interstitielle observée in-situ. Cette analyse est basée sur une approche poroélastique anisotrope. L’objectif principal est de reproduire qualitativement l’évolution de la pression des pores autour des galeries avec une approche simple qui prend en compte l’anisotropie intrinsèque du matériau. Enfin, une analyse de l’apparition de la rupture montre le rôle clé que joue le couplage hydromécanique dans l’extension de la zone fracturé...|$|R
30|$|The {{backfilling}} {{of underground}} stopes in mines has become {{common practice in}} the mining industry as it increases the stability of mine excavations and reduces environmental problems. The backfilling process involves several technical aspects that must be assessed {{to ensure that the}} backfilling objectives are achieved. The horizontal stress exerted by backfill on excavation walls must be estimated accurately to avoid the failure of mine pillars. The analytical Marston method is often used for evaluating this stress as it takes into consideration an earth pressure coefficient (K) that is dependent on the geotechnical properties of the backfill. This paper demonstrates that the accuracy of the Marston method for predicting horizontal earth pressure would be improved by using K values that are determined as a function of backfill geotechnical parameters and also <b>excavation</b> <b>geometry.</b> Both components vary inevitably from one backfilled site to another. A methodology is developed to adjust the K value to be a function of these parameters for its application within the Marston analytical method thereby providing a more accurate prediction of earth pressure. Based on various geometric and geomechanical parameters, two graphs are developed to evaluate proper earth pressure values. These graphs can be used for estimating more accurate K values that are based on the characteristics of the stope and the backfill material.|$|E
40|$|A Recent {{increase}} of induced seismicity and high rock stresses in the Pyhäsalmi mine have proven {{the need for}} an analysis of the seismic data and prediction of hazard. Seismic events and other influencing factors are analysed to forecast and quantify the level of induced seismicity risk in the Pyhäsalmi mine. The expected maximum event size is found by clustering seismic data using the Quality Threshold and Single Linkage clustering algorithms and applying the Gutenberg-Richter’s frequency-magnitude relationship. Induced seismicity risk is assessed using the Quantitative Seismic Hazard and Risk Assessment Framework. The potential for induced seismicity is calculated {{as a function of the}} maximum local seismic magnitude, rock stresses and strength, local geology, <b>excavation</b> <b>geometry,</b> and ground support capacity. The exposure to the hazard is taken into account in order to quantify the level of risk. The assessment is performed on three mining levels at about 1. 2 km depth, which are divided into assessment zones. Most of the assessment zones have a low seismic risk and only a few have an elevated potential of rockburst. The highest risk is found along the northern contact zone of ore and waste rock, adjacent to important mine infrastructure. The critical areas are identified and installation of ground support with increased dynamic capacity is recommended as a risk mitigation strategy. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|In view of {{the recent}} catastrophes {{associated}} with deep excavations, there is an urgent need to provide vital guidelines {{on the design of}} the construction process. To develop a simple tool for predicting ground deformation around a deep excavation construction for preliminary design and decision-making purposes, small scale centrifuge models were made to observe the complicated mechanisms involved. A newly developed actuation system, with which the construction sequences of propping could be implemented, was developed, the new procedures were proven to give more realistic initial ground conditions before excavation with minimal development of pre-excavation bending moment and wall displacement. Incremental wall deformation profiles generally followed the O’Rourke cosine bulge equation and a new deformation mechanism was proposed with respect to wall toe fixity and <b>excavation</b> <b>geometry.</b> Validation of the conservation energy principle was carried out for the undrained excavation process. The total loss of potential energy was shown to be balanced by the total work done in shearing and the total elastic energy stored in structures with an error term of 30 %. An improved mobilizable strength method (MSD) method using observed mechanistic deformation patterns was introduced to calculate the displacement profile of a multi-propped undrained excavation in soft clay. The incremental loss in potential energy associated with the formation of settlement toughs was balanced by the sum of incremental storage of elastic energy and the energy dissipation in shearing. A reasonable agreement was found between the prediction by the MSD method and the finite element results computed by an advanced MIT-E 3 model for wall displacements, ground settlement, base heave and bending moment on fixed base walls. For cases of excavations supported by floating walls, the effect of embedded wall length, depth of the stiff layer, bending stiffness of wall and <b>excavation</b> <b>geometry</b> and over-consolidation ratio of soils were found to have a influence on the maximum wall deflection. In general, the predictions fell within 30 % of the finite element computed results. A new chart ψ versus normalized system stiffness was used to demonstrate that MSD could correctly capture the trend of wall displacements increasing with the ratio of excavation depth to depth of stiff layer, which could be controlled by increasing wall stiffness for very stiff wall system only. The incorporation of a simple parabolic curve quantifying small strain stiffness of soil was proven to be essential to good ground movement predictions. A new dimensionless group has been defined using the MSD concepts to analyze 110 cases of excavation. The new database can now be used to investigate the relationship between structural response ratio S and soil-structure stiffness ratio R where this is shown on log-log axes to capture the enormous range of wall stiffness between sheet-piles and thick diaphragm walls. Wall stiffness was found to have a negligible influence on the magnitude of the wall bulging displacements for deep excavation supported by fixed-based wall with stiffness ranging from sheet pile walls to ordinary reinforced concrete diaphragm walls, whereas excavations supported by floating walls were found to be influenced by wall stiffness due to the difference in deformation mechanisms...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the past}} twenty years, {{there has been a}} growing {{interest}} in the development of numerical models that can realistically capture the progressive failure of rock masses. In particular, the investigation of damage development around underground excavations represents a key issue in several rock engineering applications, including tunnelling, mining, drilling, hydroelectric power generation, and the deep geological disposal of nuclear waste. The goal {{of this paper is to}} show the effectiveness of a hybrid finite-discrete element method (FDEM) code to simulate the fracturing mechanisms associated with the excavation of underground openings in brittle rock formations. A brief review of the current state-of-the-art modelling approaches is initially provided, including the description of selecting continuum- and discontinuum-based techniques. Then, the influence of a number of factors, including mechanical and in situ stress anisotropy, as well as <b>excavation</b> <b>geometry,</b> on the simulated damage is analysed for three different geomechanical scenarios. Firstly, the fracture nucleation and growth process under isotropic rock mass conditions is simulated for a circular shaft. Secondly, the influence of mechanical anisotropy on the development of an excavation damaged zone (EDZ) around a tunnel excavated in a layered rock formation is considered. Finally, the interaction mechanisms between two large caverns of an underground hydroelectric power station are investigated, with particular emphasis on the rock mass response sensitivity to the pillar width and excavation sequence. Overall, the numerical results indicate that FDEM simulations can provide unique geomechanical insights in cases where an explicit consideration of fracture and fragmentation processes is of paramount importance...|$|E
40|$|The {{assessment}} of the seismic safety of underground structures, either tunnels or large station boxes, should not be overlooked especially in densely populated areas, even with low to moderate seismicity. For underground structures, an important issue is the estimation of the seismic actions acting on the structure; only few experimental evidences are available for multi-level propped walls. For tunnels, it is generally assumed that their seismic behavior in soft ground is governed by the surrounding soil, while the inertial load contribution of the underground structure itself is negligible. In both cases, recent numerical studies proved that advanced dynamic analyses can provide satisfactory interpretation of non-linear soil-structure interaction during earthquakes. In this paper, a real case study, represented by a large open multi-propped excavation and a circular segmented tunnel in a densely urbanized area of the city center in Napoli, {{has been used to}} investigate some of the mentioned aspects. Accurate geotechnical characterization and choice of the reference input motions lead to a first estimate of the free-field ground motion, which was subsequently used for pseudo-static decoupled analyses. For the complexity of both <b>excavation</b> <b>geometry</b> and staged construction, a full dynamic analysis was considered neither affordable nor reliable for the multi-propped station box; thus two conventional pseudo-static analyses, applying either a displacement-based or a force-based approach, were carried out. In the case of the tunnel, the seismic increments of internal forces in the lining could be calculated through both a simplified pseudo-static analysis and a full dynamic analysis, showing a satisfying agreement. Overall, {{the results of the study}} demonstrated that the seismic increments of internal forces in the diaphragm walls of the station and in the segmented lining of the tunnel were quite significant. The case study encourages improving the reliability of simplified methods based on the more advanced dynamic approaches...|$|E

In {{order to better}} constrain the conditions {{that can lead to}} subsidence, a study taking the form of a parametric analysis to investigate the features and properties significant in the causes of abandoned mine working instability has been undertaken within the numerical modelling code FLAC 3 D. The effect on stability of variations in <b>excavation</b> <b>geometry</b> along with variations of the in-situ stresses related to the overburden loading have also been investigated. Use has been made of interface elements to allow the modelling of coal measures rocks as a horizontally laminated assemblage of strata whereby discrete or discontinuous behaviour representative of the failure of layered rock masses over abandoned mine workings can be modelled. The modelling of variably dipping discontinuity features commonly present in rock masses has also been undertaken using an anisotropic constitutive model. The effects of fluctuations in the groundwater table are modelled as variations in pore water pressures on the stability of excavations have also been investigated. The modelling results indicate that the friction angle of the rock mass (which may be considered a composite of the intact rock and discontinuity friction angles) is a key parameter in controlling the geometry of failure of the strata forming the excavation roof. Pore water pressures are also shown to be significant in causing the initiation of instability. Empirical tools to allow the estimation of the height of collapse before arching or choking of the void occurs are also introduced as well as a numerical based methodology to allow the modelling of collapse propagation in rock masses above excavations. Numerical modelling was also undertaken of the subsidence event that occurred at Dolphingstone in Scotland which suggests that the increase in the ground water table may have been responsible for the collapse.
