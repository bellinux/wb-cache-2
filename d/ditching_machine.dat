50|$|In 1932 the Baruch Corporation was sued by actress Ann Christy for $100,730 {{in damages}} {{when she was}} {{involved}} in a collision with a <b>ditching</b> <b>machine</b> owned by the company.|$|E
5000|$|In the 1850s {{the states}} began an {{organized}} attempt {{to drain the}} swamp for agricultural use and ease of travel. Various projects were undertaken over a 40-year period. Local resident James B. Hill, living in Bowling Green, Ohio, in the mid-19th century, made the quick drainage of the Black Swamp possible with his invention of the Buckeye Traction Ditcher. [...] Hill's <b>ditching</b> <b>machine</b> laid drainage tiles at a record pace. The area was largely settled {{over the next three}} decades. The development of railroads and a local drainage tile industry are thought to have contributed greatly to drainage and settlement.|$|E
50|$|Following {{her success}} in Speedy, Christy vacationed in New York. When she {{returned}} to Hollywood, she discovered {{that she had been}} forgotten. She returned to acting with parts in collegian film serials with Universal Pictures. In 1931, Christy sued the Herbert M. Baruch Corporation for $100,730 in damages. She said she sustained multiple fractures and other injuries when she drove her car into a <b>ditching</b> <b>machine,</b> which she contended was left on the highway by the defendants, without the proper lights. It is not clear what the verdict was. She made her last onscreen appearance in the 1932 film Behind Stone Walls, starring Edward J. Nugent.|$|E
5000|$|The {{original}} pipeline was 20-22 {{inches in}} diameter, five hundred miles long, trenched by <b>ditching</b> <b>machines</b> but some portions dug by hand, linked by Dresser coupling rather than welded, and limited to 50 psi. [...] The Bivins Compressor Station, using three Worthington Corporation compressors of 1000 HP each, {{was the first}} soon followed by Clayton and Devine {{and the introduction of}} electric welding.|$|R
50|$|Innovation of <b>Ditch</b> Witch® <b>machines</b> {{started in}} the 1940s when a compact {{trenching}} machine was created to replace the pick and shovel for installation of underground residential utility services.|$|R
500|$|The pipe {{was laid}} in {{trenches}} [...] deep and [...] wide, dug {{out by a}} combination of <b>ditching</b> <b>machines</b> and manual labor. The pipes were then cleaned by pulling a workman through the inside of them with cloths, and welded together, using both the [...] "stovepiping" [...] method and the roll-weld, or [...] "firing line", methods. Stovepiping was an older method, in which the welder worked his way around two pipes, which remained stationary; the newer roll-weld approach instead rotated the pipes, allowing the welder to remain in one position as he worked, with up to seven pipes being welded together at the same time.|$|R
50|$|The {{introduction}} of plastic tile served to reduce both {{the cost of}} tile installation, {{as well as the}} amount of labor involved. Rather than set individual sections of cement tile end-to-end in the trench, tile installers had only to unroll a continuous section of lightweight, flexible tile line. Towards {{the end of the twentieth}} century, when large, four-wheel-drive tractors became more common on American farms, do-it-yourself tile implements appeared on the market. By making tile installation cheaper and allowing it to be done on the landowner's schedule, farmers are capable of draining localized wet spots that may not create enough of a problem to merit more costly operations. In this way, farmers may enjoy increases in crop yield while saving on the capital costs of tile installation. Perhaps the most useful implement in drainage history was James B. Hill's Buckeye Traction Ditcher, which laid drainage tiles at a record pace. Hill's <b>ditching</b> <b>machine</b> drained the Great Black Swamp in Ohio, vast stretches of Louisiana, and Florida's swampland.|$|E
5000|$|She arrived Dakar, Senegal for a {{visit from}} 24-28 September 1981. On leaving Dakar, the ship was {{directed}} to Banjul (see [...] ), capital of the Gambia, on 29 September in order to locate a ditched Senegalese Puma helicopter, which had crashed into the river while landing Senegalese troops during the attempted coup d'état, on 1 August 1981, in the Gambia. Using copies of a recent survey, by sister ship [...] flown to Dakar from the United Kingdom Hydrographic Office, in Taunton, HMS Hydra's two surveying motor boats began sounding and sonar sweeping and located the <b>ditched</b> <b>machine,</b> the local port authority marking the helicopter's position with a float. She sailed the next day.|$|R

5000|$|The first {{production}} trencher {{rolled off}} the assembly line in 1949. Called the [...] "endless conveyor ditch digging machine," [...] It was the first mechanized, compact service-line trencher developed for laying underground water lines between the street main and the house. It was initially marketed for $750 per machine. Before the end of the 1950s, the company bought 160 acres of land west of Perry and built a new manufacturing facility. In 1955, Ed Malzahn's endless conveyor <b>ditch</b> digging <b>machine</b> received U.S. Patent No. 2,714,262.|$|R
50|$|Stretching 8 km from Ouistreham to Saint-Aubin-sur-Mer it was {{the furthest}} east of the landing points and around 15 km from Caen. The landing site was divided into four zones — Oboe, Peter, Queen and Roger (west-east). The German Army's defences {{consisted}} of beach obstacles, anti-tank <b>ditches,</b> mines, <b>machine</b> guns and mortars at the beaches and across the River Orne at Merville there were heavy guns. The defending troops belonged to the 716th Static Infantry Division and could call on {{the support of the}} nearby 21st Panzer division. The landing forces were the British I Corps, comprising the 3rd British Infantry Division and the 27th Armoured Brigade.|$|R
50|$|The German Army entered Khislavichi on July 16, 1941. 800 Jews of {{the town}} were resettled in a ghetto. In September or October 1941, 120 to 150 Jews were murdered in a mass execution. On March 20, 1942, the Russian police entered the ghetto. Under the command of the German Security Police, they killed all the Jews of the ghetto about 150 meters {{northwest}} {{of the town}} in a <b>ditch</b> near the <b>Machine</b> and Tractor Station.|$|R
50|$|The {{band was}} {{originally}} formed in 1998 by Greg Wilkinson {{as a solo}} project called Mr.Brainoil with a Boss drum machine. Greg was joined by Nate {{in the summer of}} 2000. Greg and Nate continued to work on material throughout the summer of 2000 writing and recording a demo by the fall of 2000. Greg and Nate <b>ditched</b> the drum <b>machine</b> by the winter of 2000 and were joined by Ira Harris. Brainoil's first show was on March 3, 2001 at Mission Records in San Francisco.|$|R
60|$|Cactus {{barred the}} way, rocks barred the way, gullies barred the way, and these Nels {{addressed}} in the grim humor with which he was wont to view tragic things. A mistake on Link's part, a slip of a wheel, a bursting of a tire at a critical moment, an instant of the bad luck which might happen a hundred times on a less perilous ride--any one of these might spell disaster for the car, perhaps death to the occupants. Again and again Link used the planks to cross washes in sand. Sometimes the wheels ran all {{the length of the}} planks, sometimes slipped off. Presently Link came to a ditch where water had worn deep into the road. Without hesitation he placed them, measuring distance carefully, and then started across. The danger was in <b>ditching</b> the <b>machine.</b> One of the planks split, sagged a little, but Link made the crossing without a slip.|$|R
50|$|When Bradley finally {{learned that}} the Germans had {{attacked}} the American lines in five places across an 80-mile (130 km) front in the Ardenne, he knew the Allies were in for a fight. During the morning of 17 December, elements of the 23rd Infantry Regiment, 2nd Infantry Division were attacked by a numerically superior force of German infantry and tanks. They repulsed the first six waves with heavy casualties, leading to a last <b>ditch</b> defense. Heavy <b>machine</b> gunner Richard Cowan was later awarded the Medal of Honor for single-handedly killing an estimated one hundred of the enemy before his unit withdrew. At 1230 on 17 December, Gerow finally got permission from Hodges to break contact and withdraw towards the twin villages.|$|R
50|$|When World War I {{broke out}} in August 1914, Sommerfeld moved to New York ostensibly to {{represent}} Pancho Villa's interests but actually worked for German Naval Attache Karl Boy-Ed. In his function as a specialist on Mexican affairs, Sommerfeld helped the German government sell arms and ammunition they had bought {{to keep them out}} of enemy Entente hands. Sommerfeld also had great knowledge of U.S. munitions factories, their capacities, order status etc. His intelligence reports had a great influence on the formulation of Germany's war strategy vis-a-vis the United States. In 1915, Sommerfeld funneled large numbers of arms to Pancho Villa, the value being estimated to about $340,000 (About $7 million in today's value). Despite having large numbers of arms, Villa was decisively defeated by Constitutionalist Army General Álvaro Obregón in a series of battles in the Bajio, the most famous of which is the Battle of Celaya in 1915. Villa's huge army of movement, largely using massed cavalry charges, fell before Obregón's superior strategy and tactics of trenches improvised from agricultural irrigation <b>ditches</b> and <b>machine</b> guns. Villa's División del Norte ceased to exist, and Villa became a guerrilla leader rather than the general of a major army of movement.|$|R
5000|$|Terrance Finnegan's account {{pointed out}} such {{incidents}} were {{common in the}} area, especially in December at settlement time, when money was paid for crops. Such events most commonly happened with tenant-landlord relationships. In his account, Sanders was mad because Pullen used money to fix his house and purchase necessities. Pullen believed the money was his to pay for work previously done but wasn't paid for. Sanders when to Pullen's house with J.D. Manning. When Sanders demanded the money of $50, Pullen pulled out a [...]38 revolver and shot and killed Sanders. He then ran to the bayou as Manning got a sheriff posse. When the posse arrived, Pullen started shooting, hitting three of them. The posse then started shooting at him, and when that didn't work, got some gasoline and set the ditch he was in on fire. In the meantime, some others from the posse got a machine gun and automatic rifles from Clarksdale. When they came back, they set up and started shooting again. The gunfight lasted for an hour. When Pullen fled from the <b>ditch,</b> the <b>machine</b> gun shot him several times, seriously wounding him. The posse members then tied him to a car and dragged him to Drew. His ear was cut off, put into alcohol, and showed in a store display after that. Newspapers claimed he killed 5 people and wounded 9, but African-Americans in the area claim he killed 13 and wounded 26.|$|R
