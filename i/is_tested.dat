5|$|McEwan {{wanted to}} write a novel dealing with the social turmoil of the 1970s, and Sweet Tooth is to a large extent based on his own life. The story explores the {{relationship}} between artistic integrity and government propaganda, and addresses competing approaches to literature; the boundary between reality and fiction <b>is</b> <b>tested</b> throughout. The novel is dedicated to McEwan's late friend Christopher Hitchens. He is not referred to directly in the book, but he did play a part as the host of a real-life literary event fictionalised in the book, involving McEwan and Martin Amis, who does appear in the story. Critical reception was mixed; some reviewers found the novel moving and poignant, while others saw it as weaker than much of McEwan's previous work.|$|E

5|$|The stories The Girl {{with the}} Mule (alternately titled The Mule Without a Bridle) and Hunbaut feature Gawain in {{beheading}} game situations. In Hunbaut, Gawain cuts off a man's head and, {{before he can}} replace it, removes the magic cloak keeping the man alive, thus killing him. Several stories tell of knights who struggle {{to stave off the}} advances of voluptuous women sent by their lords as a test; these stories include Yder, the Lancelot-Grail, Hunbaut, and The Knight of the Sword. The last two involve Gawain specifically. Usually the temptress is the daughter or wife of a lord to whom the knight owes respect, and the knight <b>is</b> <b>tested</b> {{to see whether or not}} he will remain chaste in trying circumstances.|$|E

40|$|This study {{explored}} the thought {{processes that are}} associated with reluctance in gay men to <b>be</b> <b>tested</b> for HIV antibodies. The sample comprised 97 men who had not <b>been</b> <b>tested</b> for at least four years; 69 had never <b>been</b> <b>tested.</b> They <b>were</b> asked to imagine that someone had suggested that they <b>be</b> <b>tested</b> very soon and to identify, from the list provided, any negative thoughts prompted by this suggestion. The most commonly reported thoughts <b>were</b> that <b>testing</b> <b>was</b> unnecessary because risks had not been taken, that it was unnecessary because there were no symptoms, {{and that there was no}} urgency to <b>be</b> <b>tested.</b> Data <b>were</b> explored by means of factor analysis and comparisons across subgroups differing in risk level. The results are interpreted as indicating the use of rationalizations to buttress a decision not to <b>be</b> <b>tested,</b> the powerful influence on HIV decision-making exerted by salient perceptible features, and the ‘status quo bias’. Techniques that could be used to encourage testing in gay men are discussed. <br /...|$|R
