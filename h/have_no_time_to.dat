25|$|After {{the first}} blind man was struck blind in traffic, a car thief brought him home and, {{subsequently}} stole his car. Soon after he went blind, the car thief {{and the first}} blind man re-encounter {{one another in the}} quarantine, where they soon come to blows. They <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> resolve their issues, though, since the car thief is the first internee killed by the guards. He is gunned down while trying to ask the guards for medication for his infected leg.|$|E
25|$|Stephen Tobolowsky {{was tapped}} {{to play the}} Tool Time co-host, Glen. However, he was still busy with a movie {{that was in the}} middle of {{production}} at the time the first pilot was to be shot. Therefore, the producers set out to cast an alternate character that would stand in as Tim's co-host for the pilot, or for however many episodes were required until Tobolowsky was available. The casting department auditioned Richard Karn, for what would be his first major appearance on a TV sitcom; the character of Al Borland was created from there. After the first few episodes completed with Patricia Richardson as Jill, Tobolowsky was still tied up with his other commitments, and Karn found himself in his role permanently when Tobolowsky decided he would <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> do a series. Thus, the character of Glen never came into being.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the next}} eight months since Cyclops' death, Emma started to train and {{improving}} her time to turn into her diamond form. She {{also seems to be}} traumatized from the death of Scott and began to actually believe her own lie that Black Bolt was the one who actually killed him. Emma wasted no time and began to prepare for a war with the Inhumans by making alliances with various teams of X-Men, with the last being Storm's X-Haven. She declares war on the Inhumans when Beast reports that the Terrigen cloud will soon saturate and render earth as completely uninhabitable for mutants, believing that they <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> attempt negotiation. When Medusa learns the truth about why the X-Men went to war against the Inhumans, she willingly destroys the cloud and ends the possibility of future Inhuman manifestations so that the mutants can survive.|$|E

And Duff <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> refuse.|$|R
25|$|Before the {{creation}} of the Pike Place Market in 1907, local Seattle area farmers sold their goods to the public in a three-square block area called The Lots, located at Sixth Avenue and King Street. Most produce sold at The Lots would then be brought to commercial wholesale houses on Western Avenue, which became known as Produce Row. Most farmers, due to the amount of time required to work their farms, were forced to sell their produce on consignment through the wholesalers on Western Avenue. The farmers typically received a percentage of the final sale price for their goods. They would sell to the middleman on commission, as most farmers would often <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> sell direct to the public, and their earnings would be on marked up prices and expected sales. In some cases, the farmers made a profit, but just as often found themselves breaking even, or getting no money at all due to the business practices of the wholesalers. During the existence of the wholesale houses, which far predated the Market, there were regular rumors as well as instances of corruption in denying payment to farmers.|$|E

The new Poet's Corner, funded by the Friends of Richmond Park and the Visitor Centre at Pembroke Lodge, and by a donation in memory of Wendy Vachell, also includes three curved benches made from reclaimed teak. The benches are inscribed with a couplet by the Welsh poet W. H. Davies, [...] "A poor life this, if, full of care, we <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> stand and stare".|$|E

So many people are busy {{worrying}} about the future of art or society, they <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> preserve what is. Utopia is in the moment. Not in some future time, some other place, but in the here and now, or else it is nowhere." ...|$|E
2500|$|Squeegee/swab - From time to time, a paintball {{will break}} inside the player's marker. When this happens it coats the inner {{surfaces}} of the marker with paint, especially the barrel, which considerably reduces accuracy. While speedball and tournament players generally <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> clear this obstruction and instead simply [...] "shoot through it", woodsball and scenario players generally carry a tool {{to allow them to}} clear the barrel following a break. There are several types of squeegee, most of which are advantageous in two of three areas and disadvantageous in the last: cleaning time, effectiveness, and storage space.|$|E

2500|$|Not {{involved}} in top level football in 1972, Farmer {{returned to the}} VFL {{as coach of the}} Geelong Football Club from 1973 to 1975. Farmer and the club’s committee had an increasingly strained relationship, and Farmer quit in 1975. He returned to the WANFL, coaching East Perth from 1976 to 1977 with some success, and he coached the first Western Australian state of origin team in 1977. Farmer was sacked as coach of East Perth in 1977 due to conflict, and replaced by Barry Cable in 1978. Farmer said, “When the going gets tough a club should stick together and fight to beat it. But some people chip and chip at the ground underneath you in trying to find someone to blame. I do my best in football and I <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> protect my back, so it's left wide open. Maybe that’s a lot of my trouble.” ...|$|E
2500|$|In January 1998, Hess {{met with}} Blue Byte's head writer, Wolfgang Walk, {{to discuss the}} game's storyline. As {{it had already been}} decided that a new {{gameplay}} element [...] would be [...] "Divine Intervention", Hess suggested the plot {{have something to do with}} the gods of each culture, and the two worked out a rough draft in a single evening, based around a competition between Jupiter (Roman), Horus (Egyptian) and Chi-yu (Asian). Hertzler and Wertich approved the concept, but it quickly became apparent that the team currently working on the game would <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> design or render any cutscenes. As a result, Hess suggested using a traditional animation studio with whom he had worked in the past, a Turkish company called Denge Animation. Subsequently, based on designs created by Hess, one of Blue Byte's in-house artists, Tom Thiel, drew sketches of the three main characters, with different facial expressions and seen from different angles, from which Denge would ultimately produce the finished animation.|$|E
