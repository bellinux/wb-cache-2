Some worms are so fast that a manual intervention is not possible. This brings in the need for a stronger security architecture which can automatically react to stop worm propagation. The method has to be signature independent so that it can stop new worms. In this thesis, an automated defense system (ADS) is developed to automate defense against worms and contain the worm to a level where manual intervention is possible. This is accomplished with a two level architecture with feedback at each level. The inner loop is based on control system theory and uses the properties of PID (proportional, integral and <b>differential</b> <b>controller).</b> The outer loop works at the network level and stops the worm to reach its spread saturation point. In our lab setup, we verified that with only inner loop active the worm was delayed, and with both loops active we were able to restrict the propagation to 10 % of the targeted hosts.

Due to the stress in the power system {{there is a chance}} of losing the stability following to the fault. When the fault occurs in the power system the whole system goes to severe transients. By using PSS and AVR we can easily stabilize the system. FACTS devices (i. e.

40|$|Virtual {{decomposition}} {{control is}} a new non-linear model-based (that is, based on the kinematics and dynamics of rigid bodies) control approach for controlling multiple degrees of freedom robots. It has been successfully applied to control several different hydraulic robots. On the other hand, hydraulic rotary actuators are types of actuator used when high power-to-size ratio and compact space utilization are required. They come in different types; the helical spline type often introduces backlash nonlinearity into control systems because of gear the transmission involved. Therefore, {{in order to achieve}} good reference tracking performance and guaranteed stability of systems in which they are applied, their backlash has to be somewhat accounted for by incorporating backlash compensation into their main controller structure. Thus, the essence of this research was to design a virtual decomposition controller with the capability to reduce or eliminate the effect of backlash in an application where helical type hydraulic rotary actuators is applied and compare the system performance with that obtained by applying the traditional Proportional- Integral- <b>Differential</b> <b>controller.</b> A general overview of robot control is presented, followed by the definition of basic terms related to virtual decomposition control. Thereafter, hydraulic rotary actuator is described, focusing on the helical gear type. Finally, backlash and its inverse are presented in graphical and mathematical forms to show their characteristics. A combination of the aforementioned concepts was used in {{the development and implementation of}} effective control approach for a manipulator actuated by a hydraulic rotary actuator. Based on recently proposed normalizing performance indicator μ, comparison of the three different controller algorithms presented were made.

This is beneficial to image stabilization and in general to keep a reference frame for the body. In robotics, too, head stabilization during robot walking provides advantages in robot vision and gaze-guided locomotion. In order to obtain the head movement behaviors found in human walk, it is necessary and sufficient {{to be able to}} control the orientation (roll, pitch and yaw) of the head in space. Based on these principles, three controllers have been designed. We developed two classic robotic controllers, an inverse kinematics based controller, an inverse kinematics <b>differential</b> <b>controller</b> and a bio-inspired adaptive controller based on feedback error learning. The controllers use the inertial feedback from a IMU sensor and control neck joints in order to align the head orientation with the global orientation reference. We present the results for the head stabilization controllers, on two sets of experiments, validating the robustness of the proposed control methods. In particular, we focus our analysis on the effectiveness of the bio-inspired adaptive controller against the classic robotic controllers. The first set of experiments, tested on a simulated robot, focused on the controllers response to a set of disturbance frequencies and a step function. The other set of experiments were carried out on the SABIAN robot, where these controllers were implemented in conjunction with a model of the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) and opto-kinetic reflex (OKR). Such a setup permits to compare the performances of the considered head stabilization controllers in conditions which mimic the human stabilization mechanisms composed of the joint effect of VOR, OKR and stabilization of the head. The results show that the bio-inspired adaptive controller is more beneficial for the stabilization of the head in tasks involving a sinusoidal torso disturbance, and it shows comparable performances to the inverse kinematics controller in case of the step response and the locomotion experiments conducted on the real robot...|$|E
