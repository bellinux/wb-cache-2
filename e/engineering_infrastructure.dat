30|$|While {{worldwide}} only 20 % {{of agricultural}} lands are irrigated, {{their contribution to}} global food production is 30 – 40 % (Döll, 2002; Rost et al., 2008). The higher production partly comes {{from a combination of}} more intensive agriculture and a reduction of crop failures due to water shortages. Improving irrigational efficiency is largely achieved by more civil and agricultural engineering. Dripping or sprinkling irrigations are far more water efficient than furrow irrigation at the cost of deploying more expensive <b>engineering</b> <b>infrastructures</b> and consuming more energy.|$|R
