40|$|The {{solution}} precursor {{thermal spraying}} (SPTS) process {{is used to}} obtain nano-sized dense coating layers. During the SPTS process, the in situ formation of nanoparticles is mainly dependent on combustion gas-temperature, gas-pressure, gas-velocity, torch design, fuel type, and Oxygen-Fuel (O/F) mixture ratios, precursor injection feeding ratio and flow rates, properties of fuel and precursor and its concentration, and the precursor droplets fragmentation. The focus of the present work is the numerical study of atomization of pure solvent <b>droplets</b> streams into <b>fine</b> <b>droplets</b> <b>spray</b> using an effervescent twin-fluid atomizer. For better droplet disintegration appropriate atomization techniques {{can be used for}} injecting the precursor in the CH- 2000 high-velocity oxygen fuel (HVOF) torch. The CFD computations of the SPTS process are essentially required because the internal flow physics of HVOF process cannot be examined experimentally. In this research for the first time, an effervescent twin-fluid injection nozzle is designed to inject the solution precursor into the HVOF torch, and the effects on the HVOF flame dynamics are analyzed. The computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling is performed using Linearized Instability Sheet Atomization (LISA) model and validated by the measured values of droplets size distribution at varied Gas-to- Liquid flow rate Ratios (GLR). Different nozzle diameters with varied injection parameters are numerically tested, and results are compared to observe the effects on the droplet disintegration and evaporation. It is concluded that the effervescent atomization nozzle used in the CH- 2000 HVOF torch can work efficiently even with bigger exit diameters and with higher values of viscosity and surface-tension of the solution.

40|$|Abstract. The main {{function}} of a fuel injector nozzle is to break fuels into <b>droplets,</b> form the <b>spray</b> <b>pattern,</b> and propel the droplets into a combustion chamber. The amount of spray volume at a given operating pressure, the travel speed, and spacing between the jets of fuel can also {{be determined by the}} nozzle. In fuel injection, the smallest possible droplet size is desired for the most flow. This work presents an opportunity to use the Schlieren arrangement as a visualization method to view the flow of fuel from a three-hole fuel injector nozzle which cannot be seen by the naked eye. The jet flow of diesel Fuel was investigated by Schlieren photography. A test rig was designed and constructed to accommodate the nozzle; optical mirrors were arranged according to Schlieren specifications in order to allow the jet to be photographed. The breakaway pressure of the nozzle was varied between 60 bar to 80 bar. Each hole of the nozzle is 0. 26 mm in diameter and 120 ° apart; the third jet could not be seen from the images because the camera took x-y dimension images.

However, the threat of melting under uncontrolled conditions and the associated material redistribution and loss can place strict limits on the lifetime of PFCs and plasma operation conditions.

In this paper, the plasma response to radiation losses from impurity particles produced by droplet evaporation is modelled for the conditions found in the tokamak TEXTOR. The interplay between tungsten spraying and plasma behaviour, resulting in the reduction of power transferred to the limiter and diminution of droplet production, is taken into account. Calculations predict, in agreement with experimental observations, that this evolution results in a new steady state with significantly reduced central temperature and peaked impurity radiation profile. The efficiency of melt conversion into droplets, estimated by comparing experimental and computed plasma temperatures, is in reasonable agreement with the predictions from models for droplet generation...|$|R
40|$|During an {{agricultural}} application, sprays are formed by atomization through a hydraulic nozzle. <b>Fine</b> <b>spray</b> <b>droplets</b> can cause off-target contamination with agrochemicals {{when they move}} by air from the application site. Dilute oil-in-water emulsions create coarser sprays than water, when atomized through a flat fan nozzle, and are therefore interesting for drift control purposes. However, different emulsions influence the <b>spray</b> <b>droplet</b> size to a different extent and this effect is not yet well understood. With an aim to develop products with drift reduction properties {{it is necessary to}} comprehend the mechanism of interactions between emulsion droplets and the continuous aqueous phase. In this study, we analyze systematically the effects of different physical properties of oils on the spray formation process and investigate how the type of the emulsified oil, the concentration of emulsifier, emulsion droplet size, the spreading properties of the emulsified oil, and its viscosity influence the <b>spray</b> <b>droplet</b> size. Based on the experimental data, we propose a spray formation mechanism of dilute oil-in-water emulsions. We argue that when the liquid sheet leaves the nozzle, some emulsion droplets might merge with the air/water interface of the liquid sheet, spread there and induce a subphase flow, which, reinforced by perturbations in a turbulent flow, will initiate spray atomization. In mixtures of a dilute emulsion and a water soluble surfactant, dynamic surface tension at the interface of the liquid sheet controls the spray formation process. Surfactants located at the interface form a kinetic barrier for the spreading emulsion droplets and thus delay the atomization onset...|$|R
40|$|One of the {{challenges}} with conventional diesel engines is the emission of soot. To reduce soot emission whilst maintaining fuel efficiency, an important pathway {{is to improve the}} fuel-air mixing process. This can be achieved by creating small droplets in order to enhance evaporation. Furthermore, the distribution of the droplets in the combustion chamber should be optimized, making optimal use of in-cylinder air. To deal with these requirements a new type of injector is proposed, which has a porous nozzle tip with pore diameters between 1 and 50 µm. First, because of the small pore diameters the droplets will also be small. From literature it is known that (almost) no soot is formed when orifice diameters are smaller than 50 µm. Second, the configuration of the nozzle can be chosen such that the whole cylinder can be filled with <b>fine</b> <b>droplets</b> (i. e., <b>spray</b> angle nearly 180 °). However, injecting through a porous nozzle {{is not the same as}} an infinite number of very small holes, due to the difference in nozzle internal flow. Therefore, the nozzle tip is modeled in COMSOL Multiphysics in order to predict the outflow direction and velocity of the fuel. The Darcy-Forchheimer equation, which follows from the Navier-Stokes equation, is used for this purpose. To validate the model, experiments have been performed in the Eindhoven High Pressure Cell (EHPC) where (for vaporizing sprays) the spray is visually analyzed and (for reacting sprays) the ignition delay has been measured...|$|R

40|$|Due to its {{transient}} nature, high atomization process, {{and rapid}} generation of <b>fine</b> evaporating <b>droplets,</b> diesel <b>sprays</b> have been, and still remain, {{one of the}} most challenging sprays to be fully analyzed and understood by means of non-intrusive diagnostics. The main limitation of laser techniques for quantitative measurements of diesel sprays concerns the detection of the multiple light scattering resulting from the high optical density of such a scattering medium. A second limitation is the extinction of the incident laser radiation as it crosses the spray, as well as the attenuation of the signal which is to be detected. All these issues have strongly motivated, during the past decade, the use of X-ray instead of visible light for dense spray diagnostics. However, we demonstrate in this paper that based on an affordable Nd:YAG laser system, structured laser illumination planar imaging (SLIPI) can provide accurate quantitative description of a non-reacting diesel spray injected at 1, 100 bar within a room temperature vessel pressurized at 18. 6 bar. The technique is used at lambda = 355 nm excitation wavelength with 1. 0 mol% TMPD dye concentration, for simultaneous LIF/Mie imaging. Furthermore, a novel dual-SLIPI configuration is tested with Mie scattering detection only. The results confirm that a mapping of both the droplet Sauter mean diameter and extinction coefficient can be obtained by such complementary approaches.

40|$|Abstract]: The {{design of}} modern petrol engines has placed an {{emphasis}} on lean combustion {{in order to increase}} efficiency, reduce operating noise and reduce pollutants. However, the closer the engine operates to the lean combustion limit the higher the possibility of engine misfires occurring. Misfires occur when there is not sufficient droplet density around the spark to allow the evaporation of the droplets and hence the release of fuel to the system. The advent of injection systems has enabled engineers to control the majority of the parameters of spray combustion, such as droplet size, <b>droplet</b> density and <b>spray</b> <b>pattern.</b> Therefore, the ability to model spray combustion would have wide ranging implications on the automotive industry. One model which lends itself to the modelling of spray combustion is the Conditional Moment Closure (CMC) model. However, the behaviour of the terms of the CMC model, namely the conditional scalar dissipation, conditional source term and the mixture fraction probability density function (pdf), is not understood well for this case. A number of Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) have been performed on different cases of combustion where fuel droplets are present in cold air and a spark is used to evaporate the droplets and initiate a flame kernel. Data was collected and models were developed for the three key terms of the CMC model. Validation of the first order CMC model was performed by attempting to recreate the behaviour of the DNS data. The performance of the first order CMC model was found to be poor due to the inability of the model to account for fluctuations about the conditional mean of the quantities. Another conditioning variable, or second-order conditional modelling, may be needed in order for the CMC model to adequately capture the behaviour of spark assisted, spray combustion...|$|R

While there is a well-developed quantitative understanding on the physical and technical parameters determining the exposure risk when using <b>droplet</b> <b>sprays,</b> the characterization of potential aerosol exposure for the application of foams has received little attention so far. In this study the current state of knowledge on the use of foam sprays for biocide application was surveyed from the literature. In addition some exploratory aerosol measurements were carried out for typical biocide products to compare aerosol release from foam and <b>droplet</b> <b>spraying.</b> More than 55 biocidal substances, such as QAV or peracidic products as well as pyrethrins and courmarins comprising products for disinfection, insecticides and rodenticides, are used in foams. The foaming technologies can be classified as mechanical foam generation using low and high pressure and blowing agent foam generation. Since no information on aerosol formation during foam spraying was found in the literature, exploratory aerosol measurements were performed in a laboratory set-up. A reduction of a factor of three was determined for aerosol release in the three health-related size fractions (respirable, thoracic, inhalable), when the biocidal product was sprayed as a foam compared to <b>droplet</b> <b>spraying.</b> Generation of semi-solid, highly-viscous foams using physical blowing agents lowered aerosol formation more than hundred fold. The experiments show that aerosol exposure cannot generally be ruled out when using foams but increasing foam viscosity seems to reduce aerosol release. Thus, further investigations should specify to what extent foam could be explained by physical chemical data of biocidal products by using specific application techniques. These factor determine not only the primary aerosol inhalation exposure but also the risk for exposure and mobility of the environment. Correlations allowing for a prediction of aerosol release from process and product parameters have to be established in future more comprehensive experiments...|$|R
