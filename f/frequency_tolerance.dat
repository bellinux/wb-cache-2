40|$|Parkinson's disease (PD) and {{essential}} tremor (ET) {{are the two}} most common movement disorders. Both have been associated with similar patterns of network activation leading to the suggestion that they may result from similar network dysfunction, specifically involving the cerebellum. Here, we demonstrate that parkinsonian tremors and ETs result from distinct patterns of interactions between neural oscillators. These patterns are reflected in the tremors' derived <b>frequency</b> <b>tolerance,</b> a novel measure readily attainable from bedside accelerometry. <b>Frequency</b> <b>tolerance</b> characterizes the temporal evolution of tremor by quantifying the range of frequencies over which the tremor may be considered stable. We found that patients with PD (N = 24) and ET (N = 21) were separable based on their <b>frequency</b> <b>tolerance,</b> with PD associated with a broad range of stable frequencies whereas ET displayed characteristics consistent with a more finely tuned oscillatory drive. Furthermore, tremor was selectively entrained by transcranial alternating current stimulation applied over cerebellum. Narrow frequency tolerances predicted stronger entrainment of tremor by stimulation, providing good evidence that the cerebellum {{plays an important role in}} pacing those tremors. The different patterns of <b>frequency</b> <b>tolerance</b> could be captured with a simple model based on a broadly coupled set of neural oscillators for PD, but a more finely tuned set of oscillators in ET.

A second Bass Strait interconnector from 2025, when combined with augmented interconnector capacity linking New South Wales. Besides new interconnector, additional regional solutions would be required to address low system strength concerns and minimize the potential contingency size [12]. Operating an interconnector below its maximum transfer limit can enable the interconnector(s) to remain connected following a larger contingency size, which decreases the risk of separation, but this can reduce available market benefits. A new frequency control system protection scheme (FCSPS) is being applied to mitigate the effects of a credible contingency and optimizing the import and export capability of the Tasmania Basslink interconnector with very positive results [9]. The scheme continuously monitors the interconnector flow, and system load demand over 4 s cycle and calculates the required load or generation tripping that is necessary to mitigate the contingent loss of the interconnector. Loads or generators are tripped within hundreds of milliseconds of protection clearance time to allow system frequency to be maintained within the operational <b>frequency</b> <b>tolerance</b> band limits, even though Basslink could be operating at up to 630  MW export or 478  MW import.|$|E
30|$|In view {{of effect}} of ROCOF and low inertia on UFLS failure in arresting {{frequency}} drop, a new hybrid graded UFLS is now operational in Tasmania {{and is in}} implementation stage in SA in which 15 % of the load available to the UFLS scheme is tripped based on ROCOF. These relays are tripped if the ROCOF is {{greater than or equal}} to 1.5 Hz/s and the absolute frequency is less than or equal to 49.4 Hz. This scheme presents a smaller contingency with lower residual ROCOF to the remaining blocks of UFLS. AEMO along with service provider ElectraNet, has designed an over frequency generator scheduling (OFGS) to limit the frequency rise in SA to 52 Hz in line with the FOS and will be implemented by July 2017. The objective of the scheme is to coordinate the tripping of generation in a pre-determined manner, tripping low inertia generators first, to maximize the inertia online. This seeks to minimize the impacts of exacerbated ROCOF that would result from disconnecting synchronous generators that provide system inertia during an extreme frequency event. The scheme would only operate for frequency excursions above the upper limit of the “operational <b>frequency</b> <b>tolerance</b> band” of 51 Hz.

40|$|Ultra-wideband radio (UWB) is {{a rapidly}} {{developing}} wireless technology that promises unprecedented data rates for short-range commercial radios, combined with precise locationing and high energy efficiency. These benefits {{stem from the}} use of wide bandwidths and impulse signaling, implying high channel capacity and precise time resolution. UWB has been used for military radar and imaging since the 1950 's; however, in 2002 the Federal Communications Commission approved the use of the 3. 1 - 10. 6 GHz band for unlicensed UWB applications. The restriction on transmitted power spectral density in this band is equal to the noise emission limit of household digital electronics. This band is also shared with several existing services, therefore in-band interference is expected and presents a challenge to UWB system design. This thesis covers the aspects of pulse generation and transmitter implementation for pulsed-UWB communication by exploring tradeoffs that can be made in the pulse shaping in order to reduce power consumption in the transmitter electronics. A transmitter has been developed that exploits the exponential properties of a BJT to approximate a Gaussian shape. It generates BPSK modulated pulses at 100 Mb/s in one of 14 channels in the 3. 1 - 10. 6 GHz band, targeting high data rate applications.

40|$|With the {{development}} of mass spectrometry (MS) instruments starting in the late 19 th century, more and more research emphasis {{has been put on}} MS related subjects, especially the instrumentation and its applications. Instrumentation research has led modern mass spectrometers into a new era where the MS performance, such as resolving power and mass accuracy, is close to its theoretical limit. Such advanced performance releases more opportunities for scientists to conduct analytical research that could not be performed before. This thesis reviews general MS history and some of the important milestones, followed by introductions to ion cyclotron resonance (ICR) technique and quadrupole operation. Existing electronic designs, such as Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance (FT-ICR) preamplifiers (for ion signal detection) and radio-frequency (RF) oscillators (for ion transportation/filtering) are reviewed. Then the potential scope for improvement is discussed. Two new FT-ICR preamplifiers are reported; both preamplifiers operate at room temperature. The first preamplifier uses an operational amplifier (op amp) in a transimpedance configuration. When a 18 -k feedback resistor is used, this preamplifier delivers a transimpedance of about 85 dB, and an input current noise spectral density of around 1 pA/ p Hz. The total power consumption of this circuit is around 310 mW when tested on the bench. This preamplifier has a bandwidth of fi 3 kHz to 10 MHz, which corresponds to the mass-to-charge ratio, m/z, of approximately 18 to 61 k at 12 T for FT-ICR MS. The transimpedance and the bandwidth can be adjusted by replacing passive components such as the feedback resistor and capacitor. The feedback and bandwidth limitation of the circuit is also discussed. When using an 0402 type surface mount resistor, the maximum possible transimpedance, without sacrificing its bandwidth, is approximated to 5. 3 M. Under this condition, the preamplifier is estimated to be able to detect 110 charges. The second preamplifier employs a single-transistor design using a different feedback arrangement, a T-shaped feedback network. Such a feedback system allows 100 -fold less feedback resistance at a given transimpedance, hence preserving bandwidth, which is beneficial to applications demanding high gain. The single-transistor preamplifier yields a low power consumption of 5. 7 mW, and a transimpedance of 80 dB in the frequency range between 1 kHz and 1 MHz (m/z of around 180 to 180 k for a 12 -T FT-ICR system). In trading noise performance for higher transimpedance, an alternative preamplifier design has also been presented with a transimpedance of 120 dB in the same frequency range. The previously reported room-temperature FT-ICR preamplifier had a voltage gain of about 25, a bandwidth of around 1 MHz when bench tested, and a voltage noise spectral density of 7. 4 nV/ p Hz. The bandwidth performance when connecting this preamplifier to an ICR cell has not been reported. However, from the transimpedance theory, the transimpedance preamplifiers reported in this work will have a bandwidth wider by a factor of the open-loop gain of the amplifier. In a separate development, an oscillator is proposed as a power supply for a quadrupole mass filter in a mass spectrometer system. It targets a stabilized output frequency, and a feedback control for output amplitude stabilization. The newly designed circuit has a very stable output frequency at 1 MHz, with a <b>frequency</b> <b>tolerance</b> of 15 ppm specified by the crystal oscillator datasheet. Within this circuit, an automatic gain control (AGC) unit is built for output amplitude stabilisation. A new transformer design is also proposed. The dimension of the quadrupole being used as a mass filter will be determined in the future. This circuit (in particular the transformer and the quadrupole connection/mounting device) will be finalised after the design of the quadrupole. Finally, this thesis concludes with a discussion between the gain and the noise performance of an FT-ICR preamplifier. A brief analysis about the correlation between the gain, cyclotron frequency, and input capacitance is performed. Future work is also suggested for extending this research...|$|E
