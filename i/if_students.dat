5|$|Bath Township {{is a small}} {{community}} located ten miles (16km) northeast of Lansing, Michigan which contains the unincorporated village of Bath. The area was primarily agricultural in the early 1920s. In {{the early part of}} the 20th century, many small one-room schools were closed, where different grades shared the same classroom and teacher. Educators of the era believed that children would receive a better and more complete education <b>if</b> <b>students</b> could attend a single school at one location. The grades could be age-divided into classes, and the facilities could be of a higher quality.|$|E
5|$|Each of {{the seven}} books is set {{over the course of}} one school year. Harry struggles with the {{problems}} he encounters, and dealing with them often involves the need to violate some school rules. <b>If</b> <b>students</b> are caught breaking rules, they are often disciplined by Hogwarts professors. The stories reach their climax in the summer term, near or just after final exams, when events escalate far beyond in-school squabbles and struggles, and Harry must confront either Voldemort or one of his followers, the Death Eaters, with the stakes {{a matter of life and}} death – a point underlined, as the series progresses, by characters being killed in each of the final four books. In the aftermath, he learns important lessons through exposition and discussions with head teacher and mentor Albus Dumbledore. The only exception to this school-centred setting is the final novel, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, in which Harry and his friends spend most of their time away from Hogwarts, and only return there to face Voldemort at the dénouement.|$|E

25|$|Teaching is undervalued and underpaid as a {{profession}} and this was not helped by the selection procedure. Prior to 2010, students with lower achievement at grade 10 {{could go to a}} Teacher Training Institute (TTI) or a College of Teacher's Education (CTE) for a certificate or diploma. <b>If</b> <b>students</b> passed the EHEEE, education faculties took students with lower GPAs than other faculties. Teaching is hard work with high mean pupil/teacher ratios in primary schools and many operating a double shift.

There are three schools across the three atolls, all of whom teach from early childhood up to year 11. Year 12 and 13 students are offered foundation and transition courses. There is no university in Tokelau, so <b>if</b> <b>students</b> wish to progress to further education, they need to either study via correspondence or relocate to another country such as Samoa.|$|E
25|$|Several studies {{investigated}} {{factors that}} influence the decision to plagiarize. For example, a panel study with students from German universities found that academic procrastination predicts the frequency plagiarism conducted within six months followed the measurement of academic procrastination. It {{has been argued that}} by plagiarizing students cope with the negative consequences that result from academic procrastination such as poor grades. Another study found that plagiarism is more frequent <b>if</b> <b>students</b> perceive plagiarism as beneficial and if they have the opportunity to plagiarize. When students had expected higher sanctions and when they had internalized social norms that define plagiarism as very objectionable, plagiarism was less likely to occur.|$|E

500|$|However, since 1969 the Court {{has also}} placed several {{limitations}} on Tinker interpretations. In Bethel School District v. Fraser (1986), the Court {{ruled that a}} student could be punished for his sexual-innuendo-laced speech before a school assembly and, in Hazelwood v. Kuhlmeier (1988), the Court found that schools need not tolerate student speech that is inconsistent with their basic educational mission. In Morse v. Frederick (2007), the Court ruled that schools could, consistent with the First Amendment, restrict student speech at school-sponsored events, even events away from school grounds, <b>if</b> <b>students</b> promote [...] "illegal drug use".|$|E

2500|$|Bradbury {{described}} himself as [...] "a preventor of futures, not a predictor of them."

In a later interview, when asked if he believes that teaching Fahrenheit 451 in schools will prevent his totalitarian vision of the future, Bradbury replied in the negative. Rather, he states that education must be at the kindergarten and first-grade level. <b>If</b> <b>students</b> are unable to read then, they will be unable to read Fahrenheit 451.|$|E
2500|$|Criticisms of lecture based {{learning}} include {{that students}} get much less interaction with both tutor and colleagues - they passively absorb information in lectures rather than questioning and searching out answers. [...] The lack of interaction also means {{it is harder}} for tutors to know if individual students are struggling as they will only find out <b>if</b> <b>students</b> have not understood the lectures in exams, when arguably it is too late, whereas in problem-based learning, the tutor can assess how much each student is learning based on the student's participation in discussion within the weekly tutorials, and {{may be able to}} help students who are struggling earlier.|$|E

2500|$|In {{residential}} schools, such as St. Mary's Residential School in Mission, BC, {{students were}} prohibited from speaking their language. [...] <b>If</b> <b>students</b> did speak their language {{instead of the}} desired English, they would often be punished physically or mentally to reinforce which language was to be spoken - or not spoken. [...] With a lack of opportunity to speak Halq'eméylem in their environment and inability to go home in most cases, students in attendance at residential schools frequently lost their language. [...] In present day, the trend of individuals not being to speak their language continues. [...] English has still been taking precedence over the speaking of Halq'eméylem.

2500|$|Another {{important}} pedagogical {{feature of}} GCE is learning through communicative practices {{outside the classroom}} that [...] "harness [...] the educational force of the wider culture". <b>If</b> <b>students</b> are encouraged [...] "to see themselves as political agents", educators assume {{they are more likely}} to acquire the knowledge, skills and abilities that enable them to [...] become agents of change. Another important element of the student-centered participatory nature of GCED, is that students, through their engagement with others via Social Network Services, create their own forms of global citizenship through dialogue, learning, and action. This is [...] an important element, for example, in the activities of grassroots organizations like 'GIN' (Global Issues Network), which involves students and teachers in projects that address global issues such as human rights, trade rules, and deforestation. Such student-driven, student-led projects combine both the 'global consciousness' and 'global competence' aspects of GCED.|$|E
