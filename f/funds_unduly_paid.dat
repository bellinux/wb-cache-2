40|$|In {{the last}} decades, tax fraud has grown, being catalogued {{as a serious}} {{impediment}} {{in the way of}} economic development. The paper aims to make contributions on two levels: a) Theoretical level - by synthesis methodologies for estimating tax fraud and b) Empirical level - by analyzing fraud mechanisms and dynamics of this phenomenon, properly established methodologies. To achieve the objective, we have appealed to the qualitative and quantitative analysis. Whatever the context that generates tax fraud mechanisms, the ultimate goal of fraudsters is the same: total or partial avoidance of taxation, respectively obtaining public <b>funds</b> <b>unduly.</b> The increasing complexity of business (regarded as a tax base) and failure to adapt prompt of legal regulations to new contexts have allowed diversification and “improving” the mechanisms of fraud, creating additional risks for accuracy estimates of tax fraud...|$|R
40|$|Whereas: (1) Taking {{into account}} the {{importance}} of timely and efficient closure of the operational programmes approved for assistance from the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), the European Social Fund (ESF) and the Cohesion Fund for the programming period 1 January 2007 to 31 December 2013, {{it is necessary to}} provide proper guidance on the closing of those operational programmes. (2) In view of the experience of closing the operational programmes and Cohesion Fund projects of the 2000 - 2006 programming period, the guidelines should propose simplified procedures aiming to avoid the bottlenecks identified during the closure of the previous period. (3) The purpose of the guidelines is to facilitate the closure process by providing the methodological framework under which the closure exercise should take place for the financial settlement of outstanding Union's budgetary commitments through payment of the final balance, recovery of sums <b>unduly</b> <b>paid</b> and/or decommitment of any final balance. The proposed guidelines should therefore be approved, HAS DECIDED AS FOLLOWS: Sole Article The Commission guidelines on the closure of operational programmes adopted for assistanc...|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to reporting poor practices, the Court judges the accounting of public financial and budgetary officials, collection agencies, or treasury departments, e.g., treasurers, paymasters-general, tax collectors, certified public accountants, and can fine them for late reporting. In such cases, the Court fines public accounting officials for the exact amount of any {{sum of money}} that, due to an error on their part, they have <b>unduly</b> <b>paid</b> or failed to recover {{on behalf of the}} State. A debet (débet), from Latin [...] "he owes" [...] and not limited in amount, is entered against a defaulting person, and the defaulter becomes the State's debtor. Public and government accountants must therefore have performance liability insurance. Often, however, the Ministry of Finance alleviates a defaulter by granting an abatement of his arrears as the full amount is likely too much to ever pay out of pocket. If an account is audited and found not to be in default, then the Court issues a quietus (arrêt de quitus or arrêt de décharge) acquitting and discharging the official and settling the account.|$|R
40|$|We {{argue that}} {{managerial}} overconfidence {{can account for}} corporate investment distortions. Overconfident managers overestimate the returns to their investment projects and view external <b>funds</b> as <b>unduly</b> costly. Thus, they overinvest when they have abundant internal funds, but curtail investment when they require external financing. We test the overconfidence hypothesis, using panel data on personal portfolio and corporate investment decisions of Forbes 500 CEOs. We classify CEOs as overconfident if they persistently fail to reduce their personal exposure to company-specific risk. We find that investment of overconfident CEOs is significantly more responsive to cash flow, particularly in equity-dependent firms. ...|$|R
25|$|Especially {{after the}} events of the late 1980s, {{international}} organizations and developed countries have allocated significant resources for the environmental sector in Brazil. In 1992 environmental projects worth about US$6.8 million were identified, with US$2.6 in counterpart funds (funds provided by the Brazilian government). More than 70% of the total value was for sanitation, urban pollution control, and other urban environmental projects. Thus, the allocation of resources did not accord with the common belief that <b>funding</b> was influenced <b>unduly</b> by alarmist views on deforestation in the Amazon.|$|R
50|$|In 1983 through 1985, Newell criticized UNESCO for inefficient {{managing}} of <b>funds</b> {{and becoming}} <b>unduly</b> politicized, backing liberation {{groups such as}} the Palestine Liberation Organization and attacking press freedoms. Newell would argue that US withdrawal would do more to speed up reforms than staying and cites the 1977 US exit from the International Labor Organization in Geneva. Change seemed to be possible after we left, he said. After being out of the ILO for three years, the US took up membership again in 1980.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} a reply to Woodman's (2009) recent argument that youth studies often incorrectly attribute {{the concept of}} 'choice biographies' {{to the work of}} Ulrich Beck. Drawing heavily on Beck's own words, this paper contends that youth researchers might not be making this association <b>unduly.</b> Consideration is <b>paid</b> to some conceptual issues outlined by Will Atkinson, which Woodman has not appeared to consider, that challenge Beck's rejection of the relevance of structural analysis. Further, a review of some empirical evidence countering Beck's theory of 'individualization' suggests that 'middle-ground' positions in youth sociology can arguably be justified. Finally, it is proposed that Woodman's defence of Beck is partly a reflection of an alignment of focus between Beck's theoretical repertoire and Woodman's preferred method for understanding the youth period - the concept of generation.

40|$|This Article {{considers}} the constitutional status of mandatory partisan balance requirements for presidential appointments to independent federal agencies. Since the 1880 s, Congress routinely has included partisan balance requirements, along with fixed {{terms of office}} and “good cause” limitations on the President’s removal power, as standard design elements in its template for independent federal agencies. Until recently, both federal courts and most legal scholars have assumed the constitutionality of such restrictions on the President’s appointment power—and with good reason, given the ubiquity of partisan balance requirements and the executive branch’s historical acquiescence to them. However, the Supreme Court’s decision in Free Enterprise Fund threatens to upend this well-settled consensus; the decision squarely holds that Congress may not unduly attenuate the President’s power to supervise and control executive branch entities—including independent agencies—without violating {{the separation of powers}} doctrine. In this Article, we posit that partisan balance requirements, at least when used in conjunction with fixed terms of office and good cause removal limitations, create a problem of at least equal magnitude to the problem identified in Free Enterprise <b>Fund</b> (namely, <b>unduly</b> insulating executive officers with policymaking authority via a two-tiered good cause removal limitation). Under the logic of Free Enterprise Fund, requiring the President to appoint political opponents to principal offices within the executive branch, and then prohibiting the President from removing such appointees except for good cause, unduly compromises the President’s ability to supervise and control these agencies. Although Humphrey’s Executor settled the constitutional status of good cause limits on the President’s removal power for principal officers serving on independent federal agencies, Free Enterprise Fund’s broadly formalist reading of the Vesting and Faithful Execution Clauses strongly suggests that the combination of a partisan balance requirement with a good cause removal limit constitutes a bridge too far in the age of new formalism...|$|R
40|$|This Article {{proposes a}} new {{direction}} for addressing financial conflicts of interest, which plague biomedical research and threaten scientific integrity. This Article descriptively states the controversy surrounding financial conflicts of interest by explaining how these conflicts arise and the damage that can be created as a result. By describing the scientific process, the Article explains that changes to the academic environment may allow the public-private interaction to proceed, without creating {{the problems associated with}} financial conflicts of interest. Financial conflicts of interest are created when the profit-seeking motive of a private <b>funding</b> source <b>unduly</b> influences an academic scientist 2 ̆ 7 s primary responsibilities. The problem with financial conflicts of interest has grown since the passage of the Bayh-Dole Act in 1980. The cornerstone of current policies to address financial conflicts of interest is disclosure, which is inadequate and unsatisfying. The analysis herein changes the trajectory of current approaches in this area by proposing that an analysis of the underlying environment and behavior leading to conflicts of interest must be considered. This Article proposes the use of behavioral economics to craft a policy that effectively addresses conflicts of interest. To this end, this Article applies research from the field of psychology to understand both the environment of academic scientists as well as to begin to understand how academic scientists make decisions. Drawing on psychology literature, this article proposes that academic scientists may experience cognitive dissonance when faced with a situation in which a conflict of interest may arise. This helps to understand why an academic scientist may make a decision that creates a conflict of interest. In addition, this Article utilizes the results of an empirical study conducted by myself and a colleague. In this study, we asked faculty at five medical schools to respond to an anonymous survey containing hypothetical situations in which a conflict may arise. The combination of the psychology literature and our empirical study can provide support to the reation of new policies. Policy proposals include implementation of default rules, education, and changes to academic requirements. Furthermore, this Article considers ways to incentivize medical centers to implement effective policies as well as changes to intellectual property law...|$|R
