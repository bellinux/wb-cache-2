5|$|Christiansen (1998) {{estimated}} that the leg bones of Tyrannosaurus were not significantly stronger than those of elephants, which are relatively limited in their top speed and never actually run (there is no airborne phase), and hence proposed that the dinosaur's maximum speed would have been about , {{which is about the}} speed of a human sprinter. But <b>he</b> <b>also</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> such estimates depend on many dubious assumptions.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the pessimistic view of the south taken by the Khartoum administration, he was enthusiastic about the wealth and diversity of plants. He noted that the people had adapted to cultivating non-native plants such as cassava, maize, sweet potato and groundnuts. <b>He</b> <b>also</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> the government was restricting commercial development of sugarcane, tobacco and coffee, which grew wild, and thus preventing economic development.|$|E
5|$|Yamato is the {{director}} of the Japan Meteorological Agency, Geomagnetism Research Department which was established by his own Hotsuin family. He is a level-headed thinker and able to maintain composure in most situations. Suwabe praised the cohesiveness of the music, video and dialogue of the series. <b>He</b> <b>also</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> Yamato's most appealing trait is his strength.|$|E

5|$|Benny Benke, {{writing for}} the Semarang-based daily Suara Merdeka, found that Bramantyo had used ? to portray {{tolerance}} in Indonesia without making the subject seem cliché; however, he considered some scenes, such as Hendra's conversion, overdone. Frans Sartono, reviewing for the historically Catholic daily Kompas, considered the film heavily didactic but ultimately interesting, because its social commentary was much needed, considering Indonesia's religious turmoil. <b>He</b> <b>also</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> the characters were driven to their actions by worldly needs and not religion.|$|E
5|$|By {{the fall}} of his junior season, the Illinois class of 2014 was being {{mentioned}} {{as one of the}} all-time great statewide classes of basketball players. Chicago Sun-Times writer Joe Henricksen noted that there was a high chance that this would be the fifth Illinois class and first since 2002 to include three McDonald's All-Americans. <b>He</b> <b>also</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> the class has a chance to rival if not surpass the classes of 1998 and 2011 which each had nine top 100 players.|$|E
5|$|Mitchell and Galle were {{terminated}} from WCMH in June 2009. A {{few days}} later, both nurses were arrested. They {{were charged with}} misuse of official information, a felony that carries the possibility of ten years imprisonment and fines up to $5,000. Roberts said that the nurses filed the complaint as a personal vendetta {{rather than as a}} good faith reporting of facts. <b>He</b> <b>also</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> Mitchell and Galle sent the medical records of ten patients to the TMB without their consent; however, the reports did not include the names of patients and federal law exempts medical board reports from patient privacy laws.|$|E

5|$|The Flames were {{inundated}} with complaints from season ticket holders upset by their seat assignments {{and the cost}} of tickets. King responded to the concerns by noting that the league had purchased the game from the Flames, and the team was given a limited allotment of seats for its ticket holders. <b>He</b> <b>also</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> it was possible that the event would lose money, even at ticket prices ranging between $49 and $249, but that the team brought the Heritage Classic to Calgary because the fans wanted the game to return to Canada. The Pittsburgh Penguins and Buffalo Sabres encountered similar issues allocating tickets for the Winter Classic.|$|E
5|$|When {{designing}} Naruto for his Part II appearance, Kishimoto {{changed his}} character's clothing to an orange and black top, orange pants, and black sandals. He also {{gave him a}} red cape with black flames at the bottom when fighting Pain, {{a member of the}} Akatsuki. He drew Naruto's forehead-protector wider to make his eyebrows easier to draw, something that had bothered him with his previous design. <b>He</b> <b>also</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> Naruto's pants made the character look too childish. To remedy this, Kishimoto designed them to roll up, giving him a more mature appearance. He gave Naruto this look in order to make him stand out during action scenes.|$|E
5|$|Campbell was unapologetic. He {{said that}} he {{considered}} it his duty as president to attend the game. Montreal mayor Jean Drapeau was livid at Campbell for attending, and he laid {{the blame for the}} riot on Campbell. A Montreal city councilor wanted Campbell arrested for inciting the riot. Years later, Canadiens player Jean Béliveau stated that, although he disagreed with Campbell's decision to attend the game, as well as feeling Campbell might have been using his appearance to make a statement, he concluded that Campbell may have felt that if he did not attend he could appear to be hiding. <b>He</b> <b>also</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> Campbell's absence might not have made much of a difference.|$|E
50|$|Contrary to the {{monetarist}} assumption, Austrian School economist Johnathan Catalan assigns {{blame to}} the relatively large expansion of the money supply from 1933 to 1937. <b>He</b> <b>also</b> <b>notes</b> <b>that</b> the money supply did not tighten until after the recession began.|$|R
5000|$|Teeuw <b>notes</b> <b>that</b> by 1980 more {{had been}} written about Anwar than any other Indonesian writer. <b>He</b> <b>also</b> <b>notes</b> <b>that</b> {{many of them were}} essays written by young writers, intent on {{discovering}} themselves through Anwar's works. Teeuw himself describes Anwar as [...] "the perfect poet".|$|R
25|$|Dante {{addresses}} the topic in his De Vulgari Eloquentia.

5|$|Dick Versace, the Grizzlies' {{president}} of basketball operations, {{stated in the}} final Vancouver season {{that the company was}} losing US$40million per season. These numbers were questioned by Richard Peddie, CEO of the Raptors, as the Grizzlies had a salary cap of US$48million. Retrospectively, Heisley stated that he lost US$87million on owning the Grizzlies, although that included a US$30million relocation fee to the NBA. Versace stated that he felt that the team did not get sufficient support from the business community. Colin Jones, University of Victoria professor in sports economics, stated that it was difficult to attract corporate sponsors as long as the team was losing so many games; the Grizzlies lack of good draft picks lead to the team failing to win, thus losing revenue. <b>He</b> <b>also</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> the team never sought help in the general business community regarding management issues.|$|E
5|$|From 1831 to 1841, Palestine {{was under}} the rule of the Muhammad Ali Dynasty of Egypt. During this period, the town {{suffered}} an earthquake as well as the destruction of the Muslim quarter in 1834 by Egyptian troops, apparently as a reprisal for the murder of a favored loyalist of Ibrahim Pasha. In 1841, Bethlehem came under Ottoman rule once again and remained so until the end of World War I. Under the Ottomans, Bethlehem's inhabitants faced unemployment, compulsory military service, and heavy taxes, resulting in mass emigration, particularly to South America. An American missionary in the 1850s reported a population of under 4,000, nearly all of whom belonged to the Greek Church. <b>He</b> <b>also</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> a lack of water crippled the town's growth.|$|E
5|$|Head also {{demonstrated}} that the teeth of Eolambia were broader and more asymmetrical than Kirkland had assumed; <b>he</b> <b>also</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> subadults only possessed two teeth per tooth position, unlike hadrosaurids, although adult specimens in fact have the three or more tooth positions as originally demonstrated by Kirkland. Head further showed that Eolambia possessed seven sacral vertebrae, unlike eight or more in derived hadrosaurids, and that its antitrochanter was actually more poorly developed than those of Ouranosaurus and Altirhinus. Examination of the OMNH specimens further demonstrated that that the postacetabular region of the ilium did not form a distinct process, and the articulations {{at the bottom of}} the femur are not very prominent, both of which separate Eolambia from more derived iguanodonts such as hadrosaurids. Thus, Head concluded that Eolambia was a basal member of the Hadrosauroidea, outside of the Hadrosauridae, a conclusion supported by a phylogenetic analysis finding it to be a non-hadrosaurid hadrosauroid closely related to Probactrosaurus.|$|E
50|$|Hunt {{attributed}} the mistaken impression of increasing open marriages to {{a barrage of}} books, articles, and television shows dealing with the topic. <b>He</b> <b>also</b> <b>notes</b> <b>that</b> speculative comments about increases in open marriage would sometimes be repeated often enough that people cited them as evidence.|$|R
5000|$|Kele {{has five}} vowels: , , , [...] and [...] Vowels {{can also be}} elongated. Ross (2002) {{describes}} this vowel length as non-phonemic, and instead as {{part of one of}} four different disyllabic patterns in words. [...] <b>He</b> <b>also</b> <b>notes</b> <b>that</b> no word contains more than one long vowel.|$|R
50|$|A tumbrel passes, bearing {{condemned}} {{prisoners to}} the guillotine, mocked by the crowd. Bersi leaves. The Incroyable <b>notes</b> <b>that</b> {{she was with}} a blonde woman he is looking for; <b>he</b> <b>also</b> <b>notes</b> <b>that</b> Chénier is at a nearby table waiting nervously and that Bersi had made signs at him.|$|R
5|$|Ideas {{about the}} {{transmutation}} of species {{were associated with}} the radical materialism of the Enlightenment and were attacked by more conservative thinkers. Cuvier attacked the ideas of Lamarck and Geoffroy, agreeing with Aristotle that species were immutable. Cuvier believed that the individual parts of an animal were too closely correlated with one another to allow for one part of the anatomy to change in isolation from the others, and argued that the fossil record showed patterns of catastrophic extinctions followed by repopulation, rather than gradual change over time. <b>He</b> <b>also</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> drawings of animals and animal mummies from Egypt, which were thousands of years old, showed no signs of change when compared with modern animals. The strength of Cuvier's arguments and his scientific reputation helped keep transmutational ideas out of the mainstream for decades.|$|E
5|$|In February 1858, Ives {{returned}} to the area in a paddle steamer named Explorer. He was leading an expedition up the Colorado from the south, and he wanted Irataba to guide them. The Mohave gave permission to navigate the river, and Cairook, Irataba, and a 16-year-old Mohave boy named Nahvahroopa joined them. Möllhausen again accompanied the expedition, and {{was impressed with the}} Mohave guides, later noting Irataba's enthusiastic handshake and lamenting that their only form of communication was sign language. <b>He</b> <b>also</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> Irataba and the Mohave readily began wearing European clothes given to them by members of the expedition, and showed great interest in smoking tobacco. Aside from the friendship shown to him by Irataba and Cairook, Ives noted that the Mohave appeared less friendly than on earlier occasions, a change that he attributed to their contact with Mormons, who were in conflict with the US and had succeeded in converting some Mohave.|$|E
5|$|In an {{analysis}} of its components, IHS's iSuppli estimated that the production cost of the 16GB model of the Nexus7 is $159.25 per unit, $19 more per unit than Amazon.com's competing tablet, the Kindle Fire. The Nexus7's higher production costs were attributed to its use of a higher-quality display, a quad-core processor (instead of the Fire's dual-core), and its inclusion of a camera and near field communications (NFC) functionality. The firm's senior analyst Andrew Rassweiler suggested {{that the success of}} the HP TouchPad's fire sale helped increase the commercial viability of low-cost tablets from major brands, and the failures of other high-end tablets helped reduce the cost of parts, making tablets like the Kindle Fire and Nexus7 possible. However, <b>he</b> <b>also</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> both tablets were being sold at thin profit margins, primarily due to their respective ties to content services.|$|E
50|$|The author, Hallgrímur, has <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> in {{some ways}} Toxic repeats {{characteristics}} of Hlynur Björn, the protagonist of his earlier 101 Reykjavík, reflecting that the earlier book 'was written when Iceland was a more innocent place'. <b>He</b> <b>also</b> <b>notes</b> <b>that</b> the book reflects the rise of crime-writing in Iceland.|$|R
5000|$|Possibly {{worried that}} his {{characterization}} {{might make it}} appear that the natives are unsuitable for useful labor, Columbus <b>notes</b> <b>that</b> the Indians are [...] "not slow or unskilled, but of excellent and acute understanding". <b>He</b> <b>also</b> <b>notes</b> <b>that</b> the [...] "women appear to work more than the men".|$|R
50|$|According to Giambattista Carducci, {{the temple}} {{was used as}} a baptistery already by the 6th century. <b>He</b> <b>also</b> <b>notes</b> <b>that</b> its {{octagonal}} form is like the baptistery of Saint John in Florence, of the Arian baptistery of Ravenna, and of the Lateran baptistery in Rome built by Constantine.|$|R
5|$|In {{an article}} {{published}} on May 3, 2006, The New York Times addressed the controversy. The paper acknowledged that the mainstream media—itself included—had been criticized for focusing on Bush's act with Bridges while ignoring Colbert's speech. The paper then quoted several passages of Colbert's more substantial criticism {{of the president and}} discussed various reactions to the event. On May 15, The New York Times public editor, Byron Calame, wrote on his blog that more than two hundred readers had written to complain about the exclusion of any mention of Colbert from the paper's initial lengthy article covering the dinner. Calame quoted his deputy bureau chief in Washington, who said that a mention of Colbert in the first article could not have been long enough to do his routine justice. But <b>he</b> <b>also</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> the paper should have printed an in-depth article specifically covering Colbert's speech in the same issue, rather than waiting until days after the fact.|$|E
5|$|In his article, Winter {{wondered}} why Coandă did not add the novel feature of fuel injection and air stream combustion to his May 1911 patent applications if that feature {{had been present}} during his supposed flying experience five months earlier. Rather, Winter noted that the August 1910 patent filings in French were {{essentially the same as}} the May 1911 ones in English, and that all the descriptions were applicable to air or water flowing through the device, meaning that the patents could not possibly include fuel combustion in the jet stream. <b>He</b> <b>also</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> no mention was made in the early patents of asbestos or mica heat shields, or of any fuel injection or combustion.|$|E
5|$|In the 1250s, the {{fortunes}} of the Hospitallers at Krak des Chevaliers took a turn for the worse. A Muslim army estimated to number 10,000men ravaged the countryside around the castle in 1252 after which the Order's finances declined sharply. In 1268 Master Hugh Revel complained that the area, previously home to around 10,000people, now stood deserted and that the Order's property in the Kingdom of Jerusalem produced little income. <b>He</b> <b>also</b> <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> by this point there were only 300 of the Order's brethren left in the east. On the Muslim side, in 1260 Baibars became Sultan of Egypt, following his overthrow of the incumbent ruler Qutuz, and went on to unite Egypt and Syria. As a result, Muslim settlements that had previously paid tribute to the Hospitallers at Krak des Chevaliers no longer felt intimidated into doing so.|$|E
5000|$|At the trial, prosecuting {{attorney}} Phil Stanley (Meisner) stresses how Jo {{first told}} police that a prowler had killed her husband, until a cufflink belonging to Larry was found {{at the scene of}} the crime. <b>He</b> <b>also</b> <b>notes</b> <b>that</b> an insurance policy was purchased a week before the shooting.|$|R
50|$|This {{would make}} Endor {{slightly}} larger than Mars but about 15% the size of Earth. <b>He</b> <b>also</b> <b>notes</b> <b>that</b> in diameter, Endor would still be smaller than Mars, but denser in mass by his measurement formula. Endor's composition being smaller would be unusual, but not impossible according to him.|$|R
50|$|Religion: Ibn al-Muqaffa' was a Magian who embraced Islam {{under the}} {{influence}} of 'Isa Ibn 'Ali, the uncle of al-Mansur. Khulusi believes that Ibn al-Muqaffa'’s earlier creed finds reflections in his writing even after his conversion. <b>He</b> <b>also</b> <b>notes</b> <b>that</b> Magian sentiments are found in The Nights and describes how Magian rites are recorded with an unnatural and unapologetic style. Shirkan, the son of 'Umar al-Nu'man, marries his sister (Night No.86, Suhail edition, Vol. II, p. 207). According to Khulusi, the author does not display any negative sentiments and records this as an act of fate and the child born of incest is named Qudhiya fa-kaan (She was decreed and born). <b>He</b> <b>also</b> <b>notes</b> <b>that</b> proper names that have some connection with 'light' abound in the stories of The Nights.|$|R
