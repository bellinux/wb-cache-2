Primitive <b>erythroblasts</b> were the predominant cell type until 12 weeks gestation, after which time their numbers declined steeply; 100 % were e-globin-positive versus < 0. 06 % de®nitive <b>erythroblasts.</b> Buoyant densities of ®rst trimester fetal <b>erythroblasts</b> ranged from 1. 077 to 1. 130 g/ml, and optimal recoveries were obtained with Percoll 1118. Although primitive <b>erythroblasts</b> carried a negative surface charge and were resistant to NH 4 Cl lysis, these properties had only a limited role in fetal cell enrichment. Immunophenotyping showed that primitive, like de®nitive, <b>erythroblasts</b> were GPA+, CD 47 +, CD 45 ± and CD 35 ±, whereas CD 71 expression was weak/undetectable on primitive <b>erythroblasts</b> but strongly positive on 100 % of de®nitive erythroblasts; primitive <b>erythroblasts</b> were also CD 36 ± whereas de®nitive <b>erythroblasts</b> were CD 36 +.

50|$|The {{result of}} this process is the removal of a whole genome from a cell. The most known example is the {{enucleation}} process of erythrocytes. A processed stem cell goes through changes causing it to lose a nucleus. In the beginning phase, pro-erythroblast goes through another mitotic divisions, in which an <b>erythroblast</b> with a smaller nucleus is created and moved {{to the side of the}} cell. The nucleus becomes isolated from cytoplasm and then <b>erythroblast</b> is divided into reticulocyte with cytoplasm and pyrenocyte with condensed nucleus. Pyrenocyte with all genetic material from cell is degraded then by a macrophage. Loss of genome is in this case advantageous, since pyrenocyte can accumulate more hemoglobin.

50|$|The {{function}} of ICAM-4 {{is not fully}} understood but appears to be restricted to erythroid cells. During in vitro erythropoesis, LW appears at either the erythroid colony forming stage or later at the proerythroblast stage.

The <b>erythroblast</b> is then able to remove its nucleus, which is in turn ingested and broken down by the macrophages, to become a mature erythrocyte. During this process ICAM-4 binds to VLA-4, an <b>erythroblast</b> binding site, on adjacent erythroblasts and to αv integrins on macrophages to help stabilise the erythroblastic islands. The binding of red cells to macrophages in the spleen by ICAM-4 could also {{play a part in}} the removal of senescent red cells.|$|E

In the oral administration of the iron (ferrous gluconate 1 to 2 g per day) for 3 months, appearance of type Ⅰ and Ⅱ of the sideroblasts was observed to remarkably high grade and Fe(55) uptake into the <b>erythroblasts</b> showed to be decreased.
