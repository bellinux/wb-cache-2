Therefore, assessing water quality at tidal creeks receiving shrimp <b>farm</b> <b>effluent</b> in coastal areas of Ha Long Bay supports environmental protection and decision making for sustainable development of the region. Approach: Water samples were collected at 3 different locations for spatial assessment: inside sections of creeks directly receiving <b>farm</b> <b>effluent</b> (IEC), from main creeks adjacent to points of effluent discharge outside concentrated shrimp farms (OEC) and a few kilometers away from shrimp farm (ASF).

40|$|Abalone Haliotis midae {{farming in}} South Africa is highly intensive, {{employing}} pump-ashore, flow-through systems. Despite the known sensitivity of abalone to water quality, {{there is only}} a rudimentary understanding of water quality dynamics on South African abalone farms and its effects on abalone production. Furthermore, the potential for reusing the relatively dilute abalone <b>farm</b> <b>effluent</b> to culture other animal species has not been investigated. This study investigated the dynamics of water quality and growth on a South African abalone farm and assessed the suitability of the effluent for the culture of silver kob Argyrosomus inodorus and bloodworm Arenicola loveni loveni. Monitoring of water quality and abalone growth in abalone tanks revealed that oxygen concentrations decreased, while H⁺ ion and free-ammonia (NH₃) concentration increased in a gradient between the inflow and outflow. Abalone growth was positively correlated with oxygen concentration and negatively correlated with free-ammonia and H⁺ ion concentration. The oxygen (O) concentration of the farm influent was dependent upon the influents’ temperature (T) and was described by the relationship O (mg L⁻¹) = 11. 244 – 0. 208 T (r²= 0. 74). Linear regression analysis of data collected from abalone farm tanks revealed that the concentration of total ammonia at the outflow of abalone tanks (μg TAN L⁻¹) was dependant upon temperature (°C), flow-rate (L s⁻¹ kg⁻¹ H. midae), abalone size (g) and length of time since the tank was last cleaned (d) (n = 125, r² = 0. 80). The production of total ammonia (μg TAN s⁻¹ kg⁻¹) was related to temperature, abalone size and days that the tanks remained un-cleaned (n = 125; r² = 0. 81). A diurnal cycle of respiration was evident in abalone tanks with higher oxygen consumption and H+ ion production at night. The oxygen concentration of <b>farm</b> <b>effluent</b> was related to temperature, farm biomass and flow rate by means of a linear regression equation (n = 40; r² = 0. 69). The results demonstrated the importance of optimising the flow-rate per unit of biomass for various temperatures and sizes of abalone. As abalone size and temperature cannot be controlled under farm conditions, the flow-rate per unit of biomass which the abalone culture system receives will determine the quality of the culture water. The specific growth rate (0. 48 ± 0. 01 % BW d⁻¹), mortality (1. 8 ± 0. 5 %), feed conversion ratio (3. 0 ± 0. 2) and protein efficiency ratio (1. 0 ± 0. 1) of silver kob kept in either abalone <b>farm</b> <b>effluent</b> or control seawater for 120 days did not differ significantly (t-test, P> 0. 05). A 90 day growth trial indicated that abalone <b>farm</b> <b>effluent</b> is a suitable culture medium for bloodworm. Bloodworm supplied with control seawater lost weight at 0. 19 ± 0. 04 % BW d- 1, while those given abalone effluent grew at 0. 39 ± 0. 07 % BW d⁻¹. Mortality was 6 ± 3 % in effluent and 11 ± 8 % in seawater. The bloodworm were efficient at processing solid waste. Abalone <b>farm</b> <b>effluent</b> initially contained 7. 7 ± 13 mg L⁻¹ more suspended solids than control seawater, which contained 3. 5 ± 0. 5 mg L⁻¹, but after passing through bloodworm systems the concentration in abalone effluent was reduced to only 1. 4 ± 3. 5 mg L⁻¹ above that in control seawater. Therefore, abalone <b>farm</b> <b>effluent</b> could be reused as a culture medium for both silver kob and bloodworm.

Samples from river locations, both upstream and downstream from these selected farms, were also tested for their existing THMFP. These river samples were illustrated to have notably lower level of THMFP than the shrimp <b>farm</b> <b>effluents.</b> The downstream concentration was, however, found to be significantly higher than the upstream (as much as 5 times). This indicated that the contamination of shrimp <b>farm</b> <b>effluents</b> could have increased the formation potential of THMs in the natural water source. The experimental results showed a positive correlation between salinity and THMFP. The formation of various THM species depended significantly on the level of salinity in the water sample. Low salinity (0 - 5 ppt) often led to a high formation of chloroform and bromodichloromethane while high salinity (5 - 15 ppt) resulted in a great quantity of dibromochloromethane and bromoform.

The second phase had {{the objective}} to determine the micro algae growth in batch culture with pig <b>farming</b> <b>effluent</b> to obtain information for the third experimental phase. In this phase, the operating conditions of HRAP were determined to maximize efficiency of the treatment process and the biomass production of pig <b>farming</b> <b>effluent</b> in indoor ponds. The results lead {{to the conclusion that}} the process is quite practicable through high efficiency removal of organic matter and nutrients, as well as for Albazod production, for short retention times. However, the treatment of raw pig <b>farming</b> <b>effluents</b> led to non-satisfactory results, as a consequence of the concentration of suspend solids together with other inhibition conditions. In spite of this, in the experiments in batch cultures, it was proved that Chlorella vulgaris and Scenedesmus obliquus are able to survive in relatively high concentration of pig <b>farming</b> <b>effluents</b> being Chlorella vulgaris much more resistant to organic load than Scenedesmus obliquus. Nevertheless, in the experiments made in indoor ponds, it was observed that Scenedesmus obliquus was dominant and high nitrification has occurred.

40|$|Coastal shrimp farming {{may lead}} to the {{contamination}} of sediments of surrounding estuarine and marine ecosystems as shrimp <b>farm</b> <b>effluent</b> often contains high levels of pollutants including a range of organic compounds (from uneaten feed, shrimp feces, and living and dead organisms) which can accumulate in the sediments of receiving waterways. The assessment and monitoring of sediment quality in tidal creeks receiving shrimp <b>farm</b> <b>effluent</b> can support environmental protection and decision making for sustainable development in coastal areas since sediment quality often shows essential information on long-term aquatic ecosystem health. Within this context, this paper investigates nutrient loadings in the sediments of tidal creeks receiving shrimp <b>farm</b> <b>effluent</b> in Quang Ninh, Vietnam, which now have a high concentration of intensive and semi-intensive shrimp farms. Sediment samples taken from inside creek sections directly receiving effluent from concentrated shrimp farms (IEC), from main creeks adjacent to points of effluent discharge outside concentrated shrimp farms (OEC), and few kilometers away from shrimp farms (ASF) as reference sites were collected and analyzed before and after shrimp crops to investigate spatial and temporal variation. The results showed that there were statistically significant differences in the concentrations of total nitrogen, total phosphorus, and total organic carbon among IEC, OEC, and ASF sites while the seasonal variation being limited over study times. A sediment nutrient index (SNI) computed from coefficient scores of the factor analysis efficiently summarizes sediment nutrient loads, which are high, albeit quite variable, in canals directly receiving effluents from farms but then decline sharply with distance from shrimp farms. The visualization and monitoring of sediment quality data including SNI on maps can strongly support managers to manage eutrophication at concentrated shrimp farming areas, contributing to sustainable development and management at coastal zones...|$|E

40|$|Effluent from a {{land based}} shrimp farm was {{detected}} in a receiving creek as changes in physical, {{chemical and biological}} parameters. The extent and severity of these changes depended on farm operations. This assessment was conducted at three different stages of shrimp-pond maturity, including (1) when the ponds were empty, (2) full and (3) being harvested. Methods for assessing <b>farm</b> <b>effluent</b> in receiving waters included physical/chemical analyses of the water column, phytoplankton bioassays and nitrogen isotope signatures of marine flora. Comparisons were made with an adjacent creek {{that served as the}} farms intake creek and did not directly receive effluent. Physical/chemical parameters identified distinct changes in the receiving creek with respect to farm operations. Elevated water column NH 4 + (18. 5 +/- 8. 0 muM) and chlorophyll a concentrations (5. 5 +/- 1. 9 mug/l) were measured when the farm was in operation, in contrast to when the farm was inactive (1. 3 +/- 0. 3 muM and 1. 2 +/- 0. 6 mug/l, respectively). At all times, physically chemical parameters {{at the mouth of the}} effluent creek, were equivalent to control values, indicating effluent was contained within the effluent-receiving creek. However, elevated delta(15) N signatures of mangroves (up to similar to 8 parts per thousand) and macroalgae (up to similar to 5 parts per thousand) indicated a broader influence of shrimp <b>farm</b> <b>effluent,</b> extending to the lower regions of the farms intake creek. Bioassays at upstream sites close to the location of <b>farm</b> <b>effluent</b> discharge indicated that phytoplankton at these sites did not respond to further nutrient additions, however downstream sites showed large growth responses. This suggested that further nutrient loading from the shrimp farm, resulting in greater nutrient dispersal, will increase the extent of phytoplankton blooms downstream from the site of effluent discharge. When shrimp ponds were empty water quality in the effluent and intake creeks was comparable. This indicated that observed elevated nutrient and phytoplankton concentrations were directly attributable to farm operations. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} meet the {{requirements}} of regional councils' Water Quality Plans implemented under the Resource Management Act (1991), many farmers in New Zealand are now irrigating <b>effluent</b> <b>farm</b> dairy <b>effluent.</b> However there are situations where irrigation is not practicable and it is considered that a sequencing batch reactor (SBR) treatment system may provide a highly treated effluent able to be discharged directly to waterways. The objectives of this research were to develop an SBR operating strategy to optimise biological nutrient removal from <b>farm</b> dairy <b>effluent,</b> monitor the effectiveness of a pilot-scale SBR at removing nitrogen and phosphorus, and assess whether the untreated effluent could be made more readily biodegradable by prefermentation. An operating strategy was designed to enable biological nutrient removal, with the aim of achieving low phosphorus, ammonia and nitrate effluent concentrations. The SBR operating strategy is Fill, Anaerobic, Aerobic I, Anoxic, Aerobic II, Settle, and Decant. Phosphorus is released in the anaerobic phase, using the readily biodegradable carbon. The first aerobic phase is used tor nitrification and phosphorus uptake. Remaining readily biodegradable carbon is also oxidised thus the denitrification occurring in the anoxic phase depends entirely on endogenous carbon. The final aerobic phase operates as a polisher. The results show that the SBR did not achieve biological nutrient removal: there was no apparent reduction in nitrogen and phosphorus levels in the effluent. The most likely reason for the SBR's failure to operate as expected is that it was operated on settled effluent rather than raw <b>farm</b> dairy <b>effluent.</b> The prefermentation trial aimed to increase the readily biodegradable carbon to improve phosphorus removal. The results showed that the optimal time for prefermentation of raw <b>farm</b> dairy <b>effluent</b> at 20 °C was eight to ten days, when VFA oxygen demand peaked at about 2, 100 mg/L. The prefermentation trial showed a lag phase of 0 to 2 days. The VFA proportions obtained in this experiment were 1. 0 : 0. 3 : 0. 14 : 0. 08 acetic : propionic : butyric : valeric acids. The SBR is likely to operate as part of a total treatment system, designed to enhance BNR and provide a high quality effluent. It is considered that screened <b>farm</b> dairy <b>effluent</b> would be held in a prefermentation pond with a hydraulic retention time of at least 8 to 10 days. Prefermented effluent would be treated in the SBR. The effluent would then be polished using wetlands.

40|$|In recent years, {{freshwater}} fish farmers {{have come under}} increasing pressure from the Water Authorities to control {{the quality of their}} <b>farm</b> <b>effluents.</b> This project aimed to investigate methods of treating aquacultural effluent in an efficient and cost-effective manner, and to incorporate the knowledge gained into an Expert System which could then be used in an advice service to farmers. From the results of this research it was established that sedimentation and the use of low pollution diets are the only cost effective methods of controlling the quality of fish <b>farm</b> <b>effluents.</b> Settlement has been extensively investigated and {{it was found that the}} removal of suspended solids in a settlement pond is only likely to be effective if the inlet solids concentration is in excess of 8 mg/litre. The probability of good settlement can be enhanced by keeping the ratio of length/retention time (a form of mean fluid velocity) below 4. 0 metres/minute. The removal of BOD requires inlet solids concentrations in excess of 20 mg/litre to be effective, and this is seldom attained on commercial fish farms. Settlement, generally, does not remove appreciable quantities of ammonia from effluents, but algae can absorb ammonia by nutrient uptake under certain conditions. The use of low pollution, high performance diets gives pollutant yields which are low when compared with published figures obtained by many previous workers. Two Expert Systems were constructed, both of which diagnose possible causes of poor effluent quality on fish farms and suggest solutions. The first system uses knowledge gained from a literature review and the second employs the knowledge obtained from this project's experimental work. Consent details for over 100 fish farms were obtained from the public registers kept by the Water Authorities. Large variations in policy from one Authority to the next were found. These data have been compiled in a computer file for ease of comparison...|$|R
30|$|Higher {{concentrations}} of phosphorus in the sub-surface water of station 2 and station 5 {{revealed that the}} sub-surface phosphorus runoff from shrimp farm and domestic sewage effluent is entering the area. Nevertheless, higher near-bottom IP concentration was observed at station 5. Sedimentation and re-suspension may {{play a major role}} in the distribution of phosphorus in the near-bottom water column (Pomeroy et al. 1965). The high load of phosphorus from a shrimp <b>farm</b> <b>effluent</b> may sorb to particulate matter and settle on the sediment in the intake creek of shrimp farm effluents (Sondergaard et al. 2001). There are no noticeable trends of the vertical profiles of phosphorus at other stations.|$|E
40|$|Surface {{waters in}} 14 {{selected}} sites were examined {{for the presence}} of salmonella using modified Moore's swabs. The sites included an upland impounding reservoir, 3 rivers and 10 streams within Lancashire and Cheshire, selected because of their accessibility to farm livestock. Salmonellas were isolated from 22 out of the 57 swabs examined representing 10 sites. The probable source of pollution was shown to be sewage or <b>farm</b> <b>effluent</b> and an examination of sites over a wider area may be expected to produce similar results. The significance of these findings is discussed in relation to the epidemiology of salmonella infections and the possible disinfection of effluent discharges...|$|E
40|$|Dairy <b>farm</b> <b>effluent</b> (DFE) {{comprises}} animal feces, urine, and wash-down water {{collected at}} the milking shed. This is collected daily during the milking season and sprayed onto grazed dairy pastures. Urine patches in grazed pastures make {{a significant contribution to}} anthropogenic N₂O emissions. The DFE could potentially mitigate N₂O emissions by influencing the N₂O to dinitrogen (N₂) ratio, since it contains water-soluble carbon (WSC). Alternatively, DFE may enhance N₂O emissions from urine patches. The application of DFE may also provide a substrate for the production of CO₂ in pasture soils. The effects of DFE on the CO₂ and N₂O emissions from urine patches are unknown. Thus a laboratory experiment was performed where repeated DFE applications were made to repacked soil cores. Dairy <b>farm</b> <b>effluent</b> was applied at 0, 7, or 14 d after urine deposition. The urine was applied once on Day 0. Urine contained ¹⁵N-enriched urea. Measurements of N₂O, N₂, and carbon dioxide (CO₂) fluxes, soil pH, and soil inorganic N concentrations were made. After 43 d the DFE had not mitigated N₂O fluxes from urine patches. A small increase in the N₂O flux occurred from the urine-treated soils where DFE was applied 1 wk after urine deposition. The amount of WSC applied in the DFE proved to be insignificant compared with the amount of soil C released as CO₂ following urine application. The priming of soil C in urine patches has implications for the understanding of soil C processes in grazed pasture ecosystems and the budgeting of C within these ecosystems...|$|E

The dissolved oxygen, pH, ammonia-nitrogen, nitrite-nitrogen, nitrate-nitrogen and total phosphorus in the <b>farm</b> <b>effluents</b> were within effluent standards for trout farming in different countries. The macroinvertebrate community in the brook consisted of Mollusca, Gastropoda (Physidae, Limnaedae, Planorbidae, Neritidae), Bivalvia (Spharidae), Annelidae, Oligochaeta (Tubificidae), Hirudinea (Glos- siphonidae, Erpobdellidae), Arthropoda, Insecta (Chironomidae, Ephemerellidae) and Crustacea (Gammaridae, Asellidae). Tubificidae and Chironomidae were generally observed in all sampling stations; the highest abundance was in the inlets and outlets of the two farms nearest the source. The most common measures of biodiversity, i. e., richness, Simpson’s index, Shannon-Wiener index and evenness, were used during the year-long study...|$|R

The DNA of the larvae were isolated and tested for the presences ofWhite Spot Syndrome Virus by Polymerize Chain Reaction technique. The above study revealed thatthe extent of contamination caused by virus is governed mainly by the presence of shrimp farms. Thestudy also indicates that the dispersal of WSSV into the wild environment is maximum during April,May and minimum during the months of January, February, July and August. The high viral load couldbe due to the draining of the untreated infected effluents from the shrimp farms directly into the waterbodies.
