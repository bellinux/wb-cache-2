50|$|Finance Act 1993 {{introduced}} {{rules to}} make tax on <b>exchange</b> <b>gains</b> and losses mimic their treatment in a company's financial statements in most instances.

Finance Act 1997 saw something similar with rental premiums. A year later, Finance Act 1998 went even further, {{making it clear that}} taxable trading profits (apart from those accruing to a Lloyd's corporate name or to a life assurance company) and profits from a rental business are equal to profits calculated under generally accepted accounting practice ("GAAP") unless there is a specific statutory or case law rule to the contrary. This was followed up by Finance Act 2004, which provided that where a company with investment business could make deductions for management expenses, they were calculated by reference to figures in the financial statements.|$|E
50|$|Uncovered {{interest}} arbitrage is an arbitrage trading strategy whereby an investor capitalizes on {{the interest rate}} differential between two countries. Unlike covered {{interest arbitrage}}, uncovered interest arbitrage involves no hedging of foreign exchange risk {{with the use of}} forward contracts or any other contract. The strategy involves risk, as an investor exposed to exchange rate fluctuations is speculating that exchange rates will remain favorable enough for arbitrage to be profitable. The opportunity to earn profits arises from the reality that the uncovered interest rate parity condition does not constantly hold - that is, the interest rate on investments in one country's currency does not always equal the interest rate on foreign-currency investments plus the rate of appreciation that is expected for the foreign currency relative to the domestic currency. When a discrepancy between these occurs, investors who are willing to take on risk will not be indifferent between the two possible locations of investment, and will invest in whichever currency is expected to offer a higher rate of return including currency <b>exchange</b> <b>gains</b> or losses (perhaps adjusted for a risk premium).|$|E

40|$|Objective: The {{present study}} assesses the {{relationship}} between the degree of internationalization and the foreign currency leverage of the companies of the Mexican Stock Exchange (BMV) in obtaining exchange rate financial results derived from Mexican peso volatility. Methodology: the explanatory variables were the degree of internationalization qualified by the number of countries with which each company carries out operations and the multiple of sales in foreign currency and the leverage measured by the multiple of liabilities in foreign currency; the variable explained was the amount of <b>exchange</b> <b>gains</b> and / or losses recorded in the corporate financial reports for the period 1990 - 2015 and a multiple linear regression was used to test the hypotheses statistically. Results: it was found that statistically the variable that measures the level of liabilities in foreign currency is the one that mainly determines the <b>exchange</b> <b>gains</b> and / or losses and secondly the proportion of sales in foreign currency and, less importantly, the number of countries with the That every company develops business.

40|$|The {{problem of}} how to make an optimum use of a country's limited {{productive}} resources is often a crucial one to the policy makers in less developed countries (LDCs). Not surprisingly, therefore, the various methods of cost-benefit analysis have attracted much attention among professional economists and are finding a wide spread application in evaluating the social profitability of investment projects and in the planning decision-making process as well. Relatively less {{attention has been paid to}} yet another criterion of project appraisal in a developing country that has been developed independently of social cost benefit analysis - the so called domestic resource cost (DRC) approach to project appraisals. This approach is properly regarded as the application of the propositions of allocation theory when the project, or the industry in question, produces (or saves) foreign exchange. The DRC concept compares the opportunity costs of domestic resources (primary factors such as labour, capital, land) conmitted to the production of final goods with prices at which these goods can be exported or imported - the latter prices (the foreign <b>exchange</b> <b>gained</b> or saved) being considered as the ensuing benefits from production. The rationale for using the foreign <b>exchange</b> <b>gained</b> (through exports) or saved (through imports) as a standard of reference is that foreign exchange is relatively, and often critically, scarce in many developing countries. ...|$|R

40|$|In the {{classical}} model of <b>exchange,</b> <b>gains</b> from trade {{can be obtained}} if there exists a feasible allocation which each agent prefers to her endowment. There is no single accepted way of measuring these gains in terms of welfare, for interpersonal comparisons of welfare are needed. In this {{paper we propose a}} method of measuring gains from trade in terms of quantities of goods, avoiding welfare comparisons. The measure is given by the amount of resources that can be saved, relative to the aggregate endowment, while keeping each agent’s welfare unchanged. Then, based on Shapley’s algorithm, we propose a way of distributing gains from trade fairly among the agents. Since fair distribution of gains from trade can be inefficient, we show that a recursive procedure, which is fair at each step of the recursion, yields an efficient allocation...|$|E

40|$|While {{the concept}} of "imported inflation" and its {{relevance}} for open economies have received considerable attention in the policy-oriented literature, the theoretical underpinnings of this phenomenon have not been constructed as carefully as might be desirable {{in view of the}} controversial nature of the subject. The inflationary process can be transmitted to a country by developments in international capital and money markets or through the interaction of goods markets in one country with those {{of the rest of the}} world. The debate concerning the former transmission mechanism involves the difficulties in dichotomizing the balance of payments and the domestic money supply through the sterilization of foreign <b>exchange</b> <b>gains</b> or losses. In this paper, major emphasis will be given to the transmission of the inflationary process through the goods and services markets. Primarily,we are interested in investigating the determinants of the rate of inflation for a small country which, because of its size, is forced to accept certain conditions imposed by the external environment. ...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper offers}} {{stochastic}} {{projections of the}} Central Bank of Chile’s balance sheet (stocks and flows), grounded on its present deficit situation. These projections incorporate {{the effect on the}} balance sheet of some macroeconomic variables and alternative policies, taking into consideration the economy’s inherent uncertainty and risks. It also describes and evaluates the main causes of the current deficit. In the baseline scenario, our deterministic projections show that the Central Bank’s capital will tend to grow and reach positive figures after twenty-five years. However, statistical projections indicate that this capital will continue in the red twenty-five years into the future with a 69 % probability. On the other hand, a capital contribution of 7 % of GDP would be necessary for senior liabilities not to surpass assets in ten years’ time, with a 95 % probability. The likely evolution of capital is more favorable in the long run if the reserve hoarding growth rate is moderated, if minimum capital is established in real terms instead of nominal terms, and if accrued, unrealized, foreign <b>exchange</b> <b>gains</b> are not distributed. ...|$|E
