If it is heated in a vacuum and the vapour condensed rapidly, violet phosphorus is obtained. It would appear that violet phosphorus is a polymer of high relative molecular mass, which on heating breaks down into P2 molecules. On cooling, these would normally dimerize to give P4 molecules (i.e. white phosphorus) but, <b>in</b> <b>vacuo,</b> they link up again to form the polymeric violet allotrope.|$|E

Audio response was claimed out to 8,000Hz, later 13,000Hz, using light weight pickups employing jeweled styli. Amplifiers and cutters both using negative feedback were employed thereby improving the range of frequencies cut and lowering distortion levels. Radio transcription producers such as World Broadcasting System and Associated Music Publishers (AMP) were the dominant licensees of the Western Electric wide range system and {{towards the end of}} the 1930s were responsible for two-thirds of the total radio transcription business.

25|$|It was {{a problem}} posed by Wren that serves as an {{ultimate}} source to the conception of Newton's Principia Mathematica Philosophiae Naturalis. Robert Hooke had theorised that planets, moving <b>in</b> <b>vacuo,</b> describe orbits around the Sun because of a rectilinear inertial motion by the tangent and an accelerated motion towards the Sun. Wren's challenge to Halley and Hooke, for the reward of a book worth thirty shillings, was to provide, {{within the context of}} Hooke's hypothesis, a mathematical theory linking the Kepler's laws with a specific force law. Halley took the problem to Newton for advice, prompting the latter to write a nine-page answer, De motu corporum in gyrum, which was later to be expanded into the Principia.|$|E

[...] However, following the destruction of the original prototypes in the 1834 Houses of Parliament fire, it proved impossible to recreate the standards from these definitions, and a new Weights and Measures Act (18 & 19 Victoria.

Paragraph 13 states that the weight <b>in</b> <b>vacuo</b> of this standard shall be called the Imperial Standard Pound, and that all other weights mentioned in the act and permissible for commerce shall be ascertained from it alone. The First Schedule of the Act gave more details of the standard pound: it is a platinum cylinder nearly [...] high, and [...] diameter, and the edges are carefully rounded off.

I now add that, agreeably to the method pursued by the illustrious Newton in treating the subject of curvilinear motion, I consider the trajectory or curve described by a moving body in space as consisting of a series of right lines, described in successive intervals of time, and constituting the diagonals of parallelograms formed in a vertical plane between the vertical deflections caused by gravity and the production of the line of motion which has been described in each preceding interval of time. This must be obvious; for, if you say that the passage <b>in</b> <b>vacuo</b> of this cannon-ball, now held in my hand, would describe otherwise than a series of right lines, etc., then you are brought to the Reductio ad Absurdum, that the diagonals of parallelograms are----" ...|$|E
60|$|In view of {{this dilemma}} {{there appears to be}} nothing else for it than to abandon either the {{principle}} of relativity or the simple law of the propagation of light <b>in</b> <b>vacuo.</b> Those of you who have carefully followed the preceding discussion are almost sure to expect that we should retain the principle of relativity, which appeals so convincingly to the intellect because it is so natural and simple. The law of the propagation of light <b>in</b> <b>vacuo</b> would then have {{to be replaced by a}} more complicated law conformable to the principle of relativity. The development of theoretical physics shows, however, that we cannot pursue this course. The epoch-making theoretical investigations of H. A. Lorentz on the electrodynamical and optical phenomena connected with moving bodies show that experience in this domain leads conclusively to a theory of electromagnetic phenomena, of which the law of the constancy of the velocity of light <b>in</b> <b>vacuo</b> is a necessary consequence. Prominent theoretical physicists were theref ore more inclined to reject the principle of relativity, in spite of the fact that no empirical data had been found which were contradictory to this principle.|$|E
60|$|In {{this way}} we satisfy the {{postulate}} of the constancy of {{the velocity of}} light <b>in</b> <b>vacuo</b> for rays of light of arbitrary direction, both for the system K and for the system K'. This may be shown in the following manner.|$|E

6000|$|Aided by the {{following}} illustration, we can readily see that, {{in accordance with the}} Lorentz transformation, the law of the transmission of light <b>in</b> <b>vacuo</b> is satisfied both for the reference-body K and for the reference-body K1.

And do not the Vibrations of this Medium in hot Bodies contribute to the intenseness and duration of their Heat? And do not hot Bodies communicate their Heat to contiguous cold ones, by the Vibrations of this Medium propagated from them into the cold ones?

Disruptive {{discharge}} produces its magnetic effects: {{a strong}} spark, passed transversely to a steel needle, will magnetise {{it as well}} as if the electricity of the spark were conducted by a metallic wire occupying the line of discharge; and Sir H.

6000|$|Colonel Elliot, in {{the spirit}} of the Higher Criticism (chimaera bombinans <b>in</b> <b>vacuo),</b> writes, {31a} [...] "Few will doubt that the footnotes" [...] (on these interpolations) [...] "were {{inserted}} with the purpose of leading the public to think that Hogg made no other interpolations; but I am afraid I must go further than this and say that, since they were inserted on the editor's responsibility, the intention must have been to make it appear as if no other interpolations by any other hand had been inserted." ...|$|E
60|$|Now {{before the}} advent of the theory of {{relativity}} it had always tacitly been assumed in physics that the statement of time had an absolute significance, i.e. that it is independent of the state of motion of the body of reference. But we have just seen that this assumption is incompatible with the most natural definition of simultaneity; if we discard this assumption, then the conflict between the law of the propagation of light <b>in</b> <b>vacuo</b> and the principle of relativity (developed in Section 7) disappears.|$|E
60|$|Certainly, {{from the}} {{standpoint}} of the special theory of relativity, the ether hypothesis appears at first to be an empty hypothesis. In the equations of the electromagnetic field there occur, in addition to the densities of the electric charge, only the intensities of the field. The career of electromagnetic processes <b>in</b> <b>vacuo</b> appears to be completely determined by these equations, uninfluenced by other physical quantities. The electromagnetic fields appear as ultimate, irreducible realities, and at first it seems superfluous to postulate a homogeneous, isotropic ether-medium, and to envisage electromagnetic fields as states of this medium.|$|E
6000|$|... *) We suppose further, that, {{when three}} events A, B and C occur in {{different}} places {{in such a manner}} that A is simultaneous with B and B is simultaneous with C (simultaneous {{in the sense of the}} above definition), then the criterion for the simultaneity of the pair of events A, C is also satisfied. This assumption is a physical hypothesis about the the of propagation of light: it must certainly be fulfilled if we are to maintain the law of the constancy of the velocity of light <b>in</b> <b>vacuo.</b>|$|E

The various experiments {{which have been}} made with powerful magnets upon such metals, as copper, silver, and generally those substances not magnetic, prove this point; for the substances experimented upon, if electrical conductors, must have acquired this state; and yet no evidence of attractive or repulsive powers has been observed. I have placed copper and silver discs, very delicately suspended on torsion balances <b>in</b> <b>vacuo</b> near to the poles of very powerful magnets, yet {{have not been able}} to observe the least attractive or repulsive force.|$|E
60|$|If we drop these hypotheses, {{then the}} dilemma of Section 7 disappears, because the theorem of the {{addition}} of velocities derived in Section 6 becomes invalid. The possibility presents itself that {{the law of the}} propagation of light <b>in</b> <b>vacuo</b> may be compatible with the principle of relativity, and the question arises: How have we to modify the considerations of Section 6 in order to remove the apparent disagreement between these two fundamental results of experience? This question leads to a general one. In the discussion of Section 6 we have to do with places and times relative both to the train and to the embankment. How are we to find the place and time of an event in relation to the train, when we know the place and time of the event with respect to the railway embankment ? Is there a thinkable answer to this question of such a nature that the law of transmission of light <b>in</b> <b>vacuo</b> does not contradict the principle of relativity ? In other words : Can we conceive of a relation between place and time of the individual events relative to both reference-bodies, such that every ray of light possesses the velocity of transmission c relative to the embankment and relative to the train ? This question leads to a quite definite positive answer, and to a perfectly definite transformation law for the space-time magnitudes of an event when changing over from one body of reference to another.|$|E
6000|$|Obviously {{our problem}} can be exactly {{formulated}} in the following manner. What are the values x1, y1, z1, t1, of an event with respect to K1, when the magnitudes x, y, z, t, of the same event with respect to K are given ? The relations must be so chosen that {{the law of the}} transmission of light <b>in</b> <b>vacuo</b> is satisfied for one and the same ray of light (and of course for every ray) with respect to K and K1. For the relative orientation in space of the co-ordinate systems indicated in the diagram ([7]Fig. 2), this problem is solved by means of the equations : ...|$|E

He considered the effect as due to the removal of the obstacle which the air presented to the expansion of the substances from which the electricity passed[A]. But platina balls show the phenomena <b>in</b> <b>vacuo</b> as well as volatile metals and other substances; besides which, when the rarefaction is very considerable, the electricity passes with scarcely any resistance, and the production of no sensible heat; so that I think Fusinieri's view of the matter is likely to gain but few assents.|$|E
60|$|Our {{train of}} thought in the {{foregoing}} pages can be epitomised in the following manner. Experience {{has led to the}} conviction that, on the one hand, the principle of relativity holds true and that on the other hand the velocity of transmission of light <b>in</b> <b>vacuo</b> has to be considered equal to a constant c. By uniting these two postulates we obtained the law of transformation for the rectangular co-ordinates x, y, z and the time t of the events which constitute the processes of nature. In this connection we did not obtain the Galilei transformation, but, differing from classical mechanics, the Lorentz transformation.|$|E
6000|$|... {{then these}} general {{laws of nature}} (e.g. the laws of {{mechanics}} or {{the law of the}} propagation of light <b>in</b> <b>vacuo)</b> have exactly the same form in both cases. This can also be expressed as follows : For the physical description of natural processes, neither of the reference bodies K, K1 is unique (lit. [...] " [...] specially marked out [...] ") as compared with the other. Unlike the first, this latter statement need not of necessity hold a priori; it is not contained in the conceptions of [...] " [...] motion" [...] and [...] " [...] reference-body [...] " [...] and derivable from them; only experience can decide as to its correctness or incorrectness.|$|E
60|$|In {{contrast}} to electric and magnetic fields, the gravitational field exhibits a most remarkable property, {{which is of}} fundamental importance for what follows. Bodies which are moving under the sole influence of a gravitational field receive an acceleration, which does {{not in the least}} depend either on the material or on the physical state of the body. For instance, a piece of lead and a piece of wood fall in exactly the same manner in a gravitational field (<b>in</b> <b>vacuo),</b> when they start off from rest or with the same initial velocity. This law, which holds most accurately, can be expressed in a different form {{in the light of the}} following consideration.|$|E
60|$|But {{this result}} comes into {{conflict}} with the principle of relativity set forth in Section V. For, like every other general law of nature, {{the law of the}} transmission of light <b>in</b> <b>vacuo</b> [in vacuum] must, according to the principle of relativity, be the same for the railway carriage as reference-body as when the rails are the body of reference. But, from our above consideration, this would appear to be impossible. If every ray of light is propagated relative to the embankment with the velocity c, then for this reason it would appear that another law of propagation of light must necessarily hold with respect to the carriage -- a result contradictory to the principle of relativity.|$|E
6000|$|... 63. I {{have also}} {{arranged}} a fine slip of gold-leaf very near {{to a bar}} of copper, the two being in metallic contact by mercury at their extremities. These have been placed <b>in</b> <b>vacuo,</b> so that metal rods connected with the extremities of the arrangement should pass through {{the sides of the}} vessel into the air. I have then moved powerful magnetic poles, about this arrangement, in various directions, the metallic circuit on the outside being sometimes completed by wires, and sometimes broken. But I never could obtain any sensible motion of the gold-leaf, either directed to the magnet or towards the collateral bar of copper, which must have been, as far as induction was concerned, in a similar state to itself.|$|E

He's a surface of contact, a system of adaptations, between his essential self and his surroundings. Well, our surroundings have become--how shall I put it?--a landslide. The war which seemed such a definable catastrophe in 1914 was, after all, only the first loud crack and smash of the collapse. The war is over and--nothing is over. This peace is a farce, reconstruction an exploded phrase. The slide goes on,--it goes, if anything, faster, without a sign of stopping. And all our poor little adaptations! Which we have been elaborating and trusting all our lives!... One after another they fail us. We are stripped.... We have to begin all over again.... I'm fifty-seven and I feel at times nowadays like a chicken new hatched in a thunderstorm." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{same thing}} I infer {{also from the}} cohering of two polish'd Marbles <b>in</b> <b>vacuo,</b> and from the {{standing}} of Quick-silver in the Barometer {{at the height of}} 50, 60 or 70 Inches, or above, when ever it is well-purged of Air and carefully poured in, so that its Parts be every where contiguous both to one another and to the Glass. The Atmosphere by its weight presses the Quick-silver into the Glass, to the height of 29 or 30 Inches. And some other Agent raises it higher, not by pressing it into the Glass, but by making its Parts stick to the Glass, and to one another. For upon any discontinuation of Parts, made either by Bubbles or by shaking the Glass, the whole Mercury falls down to the height of 29 or 30 Inches.|$|E
6000|$|In {{the second}} place our result shows that, {{according}} to {{the general theory of}} relativity, the law of the constancy of the velocity of light <b>in</b> <b>vacuo,</b> which constitutes one of the two fundamental assumptions in the special theory of relativity and to which we have already frequently referred, cannot claim any unlimited validity. A curvature of rays of light can only take place when the velocity of propagation of light varies with position. Now we might think that as a consequence of this, the special theory of relativity and with it the whole theory of relativity would be laid in the dust. But in reality this is not the case. We can only conclude that the special theory of relativity cannot claim an unlinlited domain of validity its results hold only so long as we are able to disregard the influences of gravitational fields on the phenomena (e.g. of light).|$|E

Moreover, we have taken very little account of the fact that, quite apart from nationality, each individual case of the new social order is developing within the form of a legal government based on conceptions of a society that has been superseded by the advent of mechanism. It is this last matter that we are about to take into consideration.|$|E
