25|$|If the <b>Flynn</b> <b>effect</b> {{has ended}} in {{developed}} nations, then this may possibly allow national differences in IQ scores to diminish if the <b>Flynn</b> <b>effect</b> continues in nations with lower average national IQs.|$|E
25|$|There are {{numerous}} proposed {{explanations of the}} <b>Flynn</b> <b>effect,</b> {{as well as some}} skepticism about its implications. Similar improvements have been reported for other cognitions such as semantic and episodic memory. Recent research suggests that the <b>Flynn</b> <b>effect</b> may have ended in at least a few developed nations, possibly allowing national differences in IQ scores to diminish if the <b>Flynn</b> <b>effect</b> continues in nations with lower average national IQs.|$|E
25|$|Some {{studies have}} found the gains of the <b>Flynn</b> <b>effect</b> to be {{particularly}} concentrated {{at the lower end}} of the distribution. Teasdale and Owen (1989), for example, found the effect primarily reduced the number of low-end scores, resulting in an increased number of moderately high scores, with no increase in very high scores. In another study, two large samples of Spanish children were assessed with a 30-year gap. Comparison of the IQ distributions indicated that the mean IQ-scores on the test had increased by 9.7 points (the <b>Flynn</b> <b>effect),</b> the gains were concentrated in the lower half of the distribution and negligible in the top half, and the gains gradually decreased as the IQ of the individuals increased. Some {{studies have found}} a reverse <b>Flynn</b> <b>effect</b> with declining scores for those with high IQ.|$|E
40|$|Higher {{chronological age}} {{tends to be}} {{associated}} with lower cognitive functioning in all cohorts. However, in light of increasing healthy life expectancy, people of a certain age today may perform better in terms of cognition than people of the same age in the past. To test this contention, we use tests of cognitive functioning collected in the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) and the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA) in two points in time with a 6 -year interval. Focusing on the population aged 50 and above, we investigate change over time in cognitive functioning along three dimensions (memory, verbal fluency, and speed of processing). Results based on a repeat cross-sectional design that overcomes potential bias from retest effects suggest that cognitive functioning has improved across survey waves on all of these dimensions. This indicates an extension of significant <b>Flynn</b> <b>effects</b> (which have mainly been studied in children, adolescents, and young adults) to older populations. We find significant secular improvements in cognitive functioning for both women and men, across age groups and educational strata. Several explanations are proposed that go beyond the role of education as the initial driver of the cohort cognitive improvements...|$|R
50|$|On 15 January 1999, Flynn made {{comments}} on a live chat show (The Late Late Show) regarding Tom Gilmartin and a donation of IR£50,000 to the Fianna Fáil party. On the same programme, Flynn made comments {{about his own}} lifestyle (following a question by journalist Barry O'Halloran); he boasted of having a salary of IR£140,000 together with three houses, cars and housekeepers and travelled regularly, yet complained about the hassle involved. The performance which was seen as eccentric and out of touch - {{at a time when}} house prices were rising significantly. In <b>effect,</b> <b>Flynn</b> was interpreted as behaving in a manner more befitting the Irish stereotype known as the Dublin 4 mentality, complaining of the costs incurred in the pursuit of extravagance.|$|R
5000|$|The 2010 live-action film Tron: Legacy {{features}} a computer-generated young version of actor Jeff Bridges (as a young Kevin Flynn and Clu), which reviewers have criticized as creepy. Vic Holtreman of Screen Rant wrote, [...] "Finally {{we get to}} the CGI recreation of Jeff Bridges as a young man. Have we finally gotten past the 'uncanny valley' (where the mind/eye discerns that something is just not quite 'real')? Sadly, no. As long as young Kevin Flynn wasn’t talking, the face looked great - but as soon as he spoke, the creepy factor pops up. He looked like he had a face full of Botox … One could argue that Clu was a computer program and should have been 'stiff' compared to a human, but even in the opening scene of the film where we see the real-world young Kevin <b>Flynn,</b> the same <b>effect</b> is present". Manohla Dargis of The New York Times wrote, [...] "Mr. Bridges mostly amuses by throwing a little Lebowski into his performance as the older Kevin, which partly makes up for the creepiness of his computer-enhanced turn as both the younger Kevin and the rebellious program Clu. This youthful version was achieved by digitally translating the actor’s facial movements into data for a simulacrum that here looks like an animated death mask". Amy Biancolli of the Houston Chronicle wrote, [...] "Regarding Bridges' digital de-aging: It's creepy. It's a little less creepy on Clu's face (he's not human, anyway) than on Kevin's in a scene from 1989, but on either of them it has the waxen look of storefront mannequins - or over-Botoxed socialites".|$|R
25|$|To {{account for}} the <b>Flynn</b> <b>effect</b> (an {{increase}} in IQ scores over time), the authors adjusted the results of older studies upward {{by a number of}} points.|$|E
25|$|Citing a high {{correlation}} between rising literacy rates and gains in IQ, David Marks {{has argued that}} the <b>Flynn</b> <b>effect</b> is caused by changes in literacy rates.|$|E
25|$|Daley et al. (2003) found a {{significant}} <b>Flynn</b> <b>effect</b> among children in rural Kenya, and concluded that nutrition {{was one of the}} hypothesized explanations that best explained their results (the others were parental literacy and family structure).|$|E
25|$|Improvements in {{nutrition}} (often involving specific micronutrients) due {{to public}} policy {{changes have been}} implicated in IQ increases in many nations (as {{part of the overall}} <b>Flynn</b> <b>effect),</b> such as efforts fighting iodine deficiency in the U.S.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Flynn</b> <b>effect</b> {{has also}} {{been part of the}} discussions {{regarding}} Spearman's hypothesis, which states that differences in the g factor are the major source of differences between blacks and whites observed in many studies of race and intelligence.|$|E
25|$|Researchers {{have been}} {{exploring}} {{the issue of}} whether the <b>Flynn</b> <b>effect</b> is equally strong on performance of all kinds of IQ test items, whether the effect may have ended in some developed nations, whether there are social subgroup differences in the effect, and what possible causes of the effect might be. A 2011 textbook, IQ and Human Intelligence, by N. J. Mackintosh, noted the <b>Flynn</b> <b>effect</b> demolishes the fears that IQ would be decreased. He also asks whether it represents a real increase in intelligence beyond IQ scores. A 2011 psychology textbook, lead authored by Harvard Psychologist Professor Daniel Schacter, noted that Human's inherited intelligence could be going down while acquired intelligence goes up.|$|E
25|$|Attempted {{explanations}} {{have included}} improved nutrition, {{a trend toward}} smaller families, better education, greater environmental complexity, and heterosis (the occurrence of offspring with more pronounced phenotypical traits from mixing the genes of its parents). Another proposition is the gradual spread of test-taking skills. The <b>Flynn</b> <b>effect</b> has been too rapid for genetic selection to be the cause.|$|E
25|$|Heterosis, or {{hybrid vigor}} {{associated}} with historical reductions of {{the levels of}} inbreeding, has been proposed by Michael Mingroni as an alternative explanation of the <b>Flynn</b> <b>effect.</b> However, James Flynn {{has pointed out that}} even if everyone mated with a sibling in 1900, subsequent increases in heterosis would not be a sufficient explanation of the observed IQ gains.|$|E
25|$|Also, if the <b>Flynn</b> <b>effect</b> {{has ended}} for the {{majority}} in developed nations, it may still continue for minorities, especially for groups like immigrants where many may have received poor nutrition during early childhood or have had other disadvantages. A study in the Netherlands found that children of non-Western immigrants had improvements for g, educational achievements, and work proficiency compared to their parents, although there were still remaining differences compared to ethnic Dutch.|$|E
25|$|Dickens and Flynn (2001) {{have argued}} that genes for high IQ {{initiate}} an environment-shaping feedback cycle, with genetic effects causing bright children to seek out more stimulating environments that then further increase their IQ. In Dickens' model, environment effects are modeled as decaying over time. In this model, the <b>Flynn</b> <b>effect</b> {{can be explained by}} an increase in environmental stimulation independent of it being sought out by individuals. The authors suggest that programs aiming to increase IQ would be most likely to produce long-term IQ gains if they enduringly raised children's drive to seek out cognitively demanding experiences.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Flynn</b> <b>effect</b> is the {{substantial}} and long-sustained increase in both fluid and crystallized intelligence test scores measured {{in many parts}} of the world from roughly 1930 to the present day. When intelligence quotient (IQ) tests are initially standardized using a sample of test-takers, by convention the average of the test results is set to 100 and their standard deviation is set to 15 or 16 IQ points. When IQ tests are revised, they are again standardized using a new sample of test-takers, usually born more recently than the first. Again, the average result is set to 100. However, when the new test subjects take the older tests, in almost every case their average scores are significantly above 100.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the early}} 20th century, raw scores on IQ tests have {{increased}} {{in most parts of}} the world. When a new version of an IQ test is normed, the standard scoring is set so performance at the population median results in a score of IQ 100. The phenomenon of rising raw score performance means if test-takers are scored by a constant standard scoring rule, IQ test scores have been rising at an average rate of around three IQ points per decade. This phenomenon was named the <b>Flynn</b> <b>effect</b> in the book The Bell Curve after James R. Flynn, the author who did the most to bring this phenomenon to the attention of psychologists.|$|E
25|$|IQ {{scores are}} used for {{educational}} placement, assessment of intellectual disability, and evaluating job applicants. Even when students improve their scores on standardized tests, they do not always improve their cognitive abilities, such as memory, attention and speed. In research contexts they have been studied as predictors of job performance, and income. They are also used to study distributions of psychometric intelligence in populations and the correlations between it and other variables. Raw scores on IQ tests for many populations have been rising at an average rate that scales to three IQ points per decade since the early 20th century, a phenomenon called the <b>Flynn</b> <b>effect.</b> Investigation of different patterns of increases in subtest scores can also inform current research on human intelligence.|$|E
25|$|Lynn and Harvey {{have argued}} that the causes of the above are {{difficult}} to interpret since these countries have had significant recent immigration from countries with lower average national IQs. Nevertheless, they expect that similar patterns will occur, or have occurred, first in other developed nations and then in the developing world as {{there is a limit to}} how much environmental factors can improve intelligence. Furthermore, during the last century there is a negative correlation between fertility and intelligence although there is not yet any conclusive evidence of the association between the two. They estimate that there has been a dysgenic decline in the world's genotypic IQ (masked by the <b>Flynn</b> <b>effect</b> for the phenotype) of 0.86 IQ points per decade for the years 1950–2000.|$|E
25|$|For decades, practitioners' {{handbooks}} and textbooks on IQ testing {{have reported}} IQ declines with age after {{the beginning of}} adulthood. However, later researchers pointed out this phenomenon {{is related to the}} <b>Flynn</b> <b>effect</b> and is in part a cohort effect rather than a true aging effect. A variety of studies of IQ and aging have been conducted since the norming of the first Wechsler Intelligence Scale drew attention to IQ differences in different age groups of adults. Current consensus is that fluid intelligence generally declines with age after early adulthood, while crystallized intelligence remains intact. Both cohort effects (the birth year of the test-takers) and practice effects (test-takers taking the same form of IQ test more than once) must be controlled to gain accurate data. It is unclear whether any lifestyle intervention can preserve fluid intelligence into older ages.|$|E
25|$|Atheendar Venkataramani (2010) {{studied the}} effect of malaria on IQ {{in a sample of}} Mexicans. Exposure during the birth year to malaria {{eradication}} was associated with increases in IQ. It also increased the probability of employment in a skilled occupation. The author suggests that this may be one explanation for the <b>Flynn</b> <b>effect</b> and that this may be an important explanation for the link between national malaria burden and economic development. A literature review of 44 papers states that cognitive abilities and school performance were shown to be impaired in sub-groups of patients (with either cerebral malaria or uncomplicated malaria) when compared with healthy controls. Studies comparing cognitive functions before and after treatment for acute malarial illness continued to show significantly impaired school performance and cognitive abilities even after recovery. Malaria prophylaxis was shown to improve cognitive function and school performance in clinical trials when compared to placebo groups.|$|E
25|$|There is {{debate about}} whether the rise in IQ scores also {{corresponds}} to a rise in general intelligence, or only a rise in special skills related to taking IQ tests. Because children attend school longer now and have become much {{more familiar with the}} testing of school-related material, one might expect the greatest gains to occur on such school content-related tests as vocabulary, arithmetic or general information. Just the opposite is the case: abilities such as these have experienced relatively small gains and even occasional decreases over the years. Recent meta-analytic findings indicate that Flynn effects occur for tests assessing both fluid and crystallized abilities. For example, Dutch conscripts gained 21 points during only 30 years, or 7 points per decade, between 1952 and 1982. But this rise in IQ test scores is not wholly explained by an increase in general intelligence. Studies have shown that while test scores have improved over time, the improvement is not fully correlated with latent factors related to intelligence. Rushton has shown that the gains in IQ over time (the Lynn-Flynn effect) are unrelated to g. Researchers have shown that the IQ gains described by the <b>Flynn</b> <b>effect</b> are due in part to increasing intelligence, and in part to increases in test-specific skills.|$|E
2500|$|There is a {{controversy}} {{as to whether}} the US racial gap in IQ scores is diminishing. If that is the case then this {{may or may not be}} related to the <b>Flynn</b> <b>effect.</b> Flynn has commented that he never claimed that the <b>Flynn</b> <b>effect</b> has the same causes as the black-white gap, but that it shows that environmental factors can create IQ differences of a magnitude similar to the gap. Research that has examined whether g factor and IQ gains from the <b>Flynn</b> <b>effect</b> are related have found there is a negative correlation between the two, which may indicate that group differences and the <b>Flynn</b> <b>effect</b> are possibly due to differing causes ...|$|E
2500|$|The <b>Flynn</b> <b>effect</b> {{is named}} for James R. Flynn, who did much to {{document}} it and promote awareness of its implications. The term itself was coined by Richard Herrnstein and Charles Murray, authors of The Bell Curve (1994). Although the general term for the phenomenon referring to no researcher in particular continues to be [...] "secular rise in IQ scores", many textbooks on psychology and IQ testing have now followed the lead of Herrnstein and Murray in calling the phenomenon the <b>Flynn</b> <b>effect.</b>|$|E
2500|$|A 2005 study {{presented}} data {{supporting the}} nutrition hypothesis, which predicts that gains will occur predominantly {{at the low}} end of the IQ distribution, where nutritional deprivation is probably most severe. An alternative interpretation of skewed IQ gains could be that improved education has been particularly important for this group. Richard Lynn makes the case for nutrition, arguing that cultural factors cannot typically explain the <b>Flynn</b> <b>effect</b> because its gains are observed even at infant and preschool levels, with rates of IQ test score increase about equal to those of school students and adults. Lynn states that [...] "This rules out improvements in education, greater test sophistication, etc. and most of the other factors that have been proposed to explain the <b>Flynn</b> <b>effect.</b> He proposes that the most probable factor has been improvements in pre-natal and early post-natal nutrition." ...|$|E
2500|$|Eppig, Fincher, and Thornhill (2009) {{argue that}} [...] "From an {{energetics}} standpoint, a developing human will have difficulty building a brain and fighting off infectious diseases {{at the same}} time, as both are very metabolically costly tasks" [...] and that [...] "the <b>Flynn</b> <b>effect</b> may be caused {{in part by the}} decrease in the intensity of infectious diseases as nations develop." [...] They suggest that improvements in gross domestic product (GDP), education, literacy, and nutrition may have an effect on IQ mainly through reducing the intensity of infectious diseases.|$|E
2500|$|In {{support of}} the {{nutritional}} hypothesis, it is known that, in the United States, the average height before 1900 was about 10cm (∼4inches) shorter than it is today. Possibly related to the <b>Flynn</b> <b>effect</b> is a similar change of skull size and shape during the last 150 years. Though the idea that brain size is unrelated to race and intelligence was popularized in the 1980s, studies continue to show significant correlations. (Note, however, that size isn't everything—or maybe anything significant at all. For example, the overall size and asymmetrical shape of Albert Einstein's brain were normal; whereas the prefrontal, somatosensory, primary motor, parietal, temporal and occipital cortices were extraordinary.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Still another {{theory is}} that the general {{environment}} today is much more complex and stimulating. One of the most striking 20th century changes of the human intellectual environment has come from the increase of exposure to many types of visual media. From pictures on the wall to movies to television to video games to computers, each successive generation has been exposed to richer optical displays than the one before and may have become more adept at visual analysis. This would explain why visual tests like the Raven's have shown the greatest increases. An increase only of particular form(s) of intelligence would explain why the <b>Flynn</b> <b>effect</b> has not caused a [...] "cultural renaissance too great to be overlooked." ...|$|E
2500|$|A 2010 {{study by}} Eppig, Fincher and Thornhill found a close {{correlation}} between the infectious disease burden in a country and the average IQ of its population. The researchers found that when disease was controlled for, IQ showed no correlation with other variables such as educational and nutritional levels. Since brain development requires a very high proportion of all the body's energy in newborns and children, the researchers argue that fighting infection reduces children's IQ potential. The Eppig research may help to explain the <b>Flynn</b> <b>effect,</b> the rise in intelligence noted in rich countries. They also tested other hypotheses as well, including genetic explanations, concluding that infectious disease was [...] "the best predictor". Christopher Hassall and Thomas Sherratt repeated the analysis, and concluded [...] "that infectious disease {{may be the only}} really important predictor of average national IQ".|$|E
2500|$|Richardson (2004) argued, {{citing the}} <b>Flynn</b> <b>effect</b> {{as the best}} evidence, that Lynn has the causal {{connection}} backwards and suggested that [...] "the average IQ of a population is simply an index {{of the size of}} its middle class, both of which are results of industrial development". The review concludes that [...] "This is not so much science, then, as a social crusade." [...] A review by Michael Palairet criticized the book's methodology, particularly the imprecise estimates of GDP and the fact that IQ data were only available for 81 of the 185 countries studied. However, the review concluded that the book was [...] "a powerful challenge to economic historians and development economists who prefer not to use IQ as an analytical input", but that it's likely those scholars will deliberately ignore this work instead of improving it.|$|E
2500|$|Richard Lynn and Gerhard Meisenberg in turn {{replied that}} [...] "critical {{evaluation}} of the studies presented by WDM shows {{that many of these}} are based on unrepresentative elite samples" [...] and that a further literature review, including taking into account results in mathematics, science, and reading, gave [...] "an IQ of 68 as the best reading of the IQ in sub-Saharan Africa". Wicherts and colleagues in yet another reply stated: [...] "In light of all the available IQ data of over 37,000 African testtakers, only the use of unsystematic methods to exclude the vast majority of data could result in a mean IQ close to 70. On the basis of sound methods, the average IQ remains close to 80. Although this mean IQ is clearly lower than 100, we view it as unsurprising in light of the potential of the <b>Flynn</b> <b>effect</b> in Africa (Wicherts, Borsboom, & Dolan, 2010) and common psychometric problems {{associated with the use of}} western IQ tests among Africans." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2001, Dickens and Flynn {{presented}} {{a model for}} resolving several contradictory findings regarding IQ. They argue that the measure [...] "heritability" [...] includes both a direct effect of the genotype on IQ and also indirect effects such that the genotype changes the environment, thereby affecting IQ. That is, those with a greater IQ tend to seek stimulating environments that further increase IQ. These reciprocal effects result in gene environment correlation. The direct effect could initially have been very small, but feedback can create large differences of IQ. In their model, an environmental stimulus can have a very great effect on IQ, even for adults, but this effect also decays over time unless the stimulus continues (the model could be adapted to include possible factors, like nutrition during early childhood, that may cause permanent effects). The <b>Flynn</b> <b>effect</b> {{can be explained by}} a generally more stimulating environment for all people. The authors suggest that any program designed to increase IQ may produce long-term IQ gains if that program teaches children how to replicate the types of cognitively demanding experiences that produce IQ gains outside the program. To maximize lifetime IQ, the programs should also motivate them to continue searching for cognitively demanding experiences after they have left the program.|$|E
