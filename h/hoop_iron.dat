[...] If so, it would be even less trustworthy for a sword than bronze.

6000|$|Provisionally, and for {{the sake}} of {{argument}} merely, may I suggest that the occupancy of these sites may be dated by me, about 300-550 A.D.? That date is well within the Iron Age: iron had long been known and used in North Britain. But to the non-archaeological reader, the terms Stone Age, Bronze Age, Iron Age, are apt to prove misleading. The early Iron Age, like the Bronze Age, was familiar with the use of implements of stone. In the Scottish crannogs, admirably described by Dr. Munro, in his Ancient Scottish Lake Dwellings, were found implements of flint, a polished stone axe-head, an iron knife at the same lowest level, finger rings of gold, a forged English coin of the sixth or seventh century A.D., well-equipped canoes (a common attendant of crannogs), the greater part of a stone inscribed with concentric circles, a cupped stone, and a large quartz crystal of the kind which Apaches in North America, and the Euahlayi tribe in New South Wales, use in crystal gazing. In early ages, after the metals had been worked, stone, bronze, and iron were still used as occasion served, just as the Australian black will now fashion an implement in [...] "palaeolithic" [...] wise, with a few chips; now will polish a weapon in [...] "neolithic" [...] fashion; and, again, will chip a fragment of glass with wonderful delicacy; or will put as good an edge as he can on a piece of <b>hoop</b> <b>iron.</b>|$|E
60|$|He was not {{a native}} of the village; he had come to it a young man, and some kindly-disposed person had allowed him to build a small hut as a shelter at the side of his hedge. Now the village was at one end of a straggling common, and many {{irregular}} strips and patches of common-land existed scattered about among the cottages and orchards. It was at a hedge-side on the border of one of these isolated patches that the young stranger, known as an inoffensive, diligent, and exceedingly quiet young man, set up his hovel. To protect it from the cattle he made a small ditch before it. This ditch he made very deep, and the earth thrown out he built into a kind of rampart, and by its outer edge he put a row of young holly plants, which a good-natured woodman made him a present of. He was advised to plant the holly behind the ditch, but he thought his plan the best, and to protect the young plants he made a little fence of odd sticks and bits of old wire and <b>hoop</b> <b>iron.</b> But the sheep would get in, so he made a new ditch; and then something else, until in the course of years the three-quarters of an acre had been appropriated. That was the whole history, and the pilfering had gone no further only because someone in authority had discovered and put a stop to it. Still, one could see that (in spite of the powers) a strip a few inches in breadth was being added annually to the estate.|$|E
60|$|The {{following}} morning the tap {{at the bottom}} of the boiler was turned, and the syrup came out bright and clear,--about the colour of sherry wine. The scum descended unbroken on the surface of the liquor; and when the copper was nearly empty the tap was closed, and the scum and what little liquor remained was taken out. The bright syrup was now again poured into the boiler, the fire re-lighted, and the syrup was kept boiling, to evaporate the water and condense the syrup down to the point at which it would crystallize. It required many hours' boiling to effect this, any scum which rose to the surface being carefully taken off with a skimmer. At last it was found that the syrup on the skimmer began to crystallize, and Mr. Hardy pronounced it to be fit to draw off into the large washing tubs to crystallize. A fresh batch of canes was now crushed, and so the process was repeated until all the canes were cut. It took a fortnight altogether, but only five days of this were actually occupied in cutting and crushing the canes. As the sugar crystallized it was taken out,--a dark, pulpy-looking mass, at which the young Hardys looked very doubtfully,--and was placed in a large sugar hogshead, which had been procured for the purpose. In the bottom of this eight large holes were bored, and these were stopped up with pieces of plantain stalk. Through the porous substance of these stalks the molasses or treacle slowly drained off. As the wet sugar was placed in the cask, layers of slices of plantain stems were laid upon it, as the spongy substance draws the dark colouring matter out from the sugar. The plantain grows freely in South America, and Mr. Hardy had planted a number of this graceful tree near his house; but these had not been advanced enough to cut, and he had therefore procured a sufficient quantity from a friend at Rosario. It was three months before the drainage of the molasses quite ceased; and the Hardys were greatly pleased, on emptying the hogshead and removing the plantain stems, to find that their sugar was dry, and of a very fairly light colour. The sugar-canes did not require planting again, as they will grow for many years from the same roots; and although the canes from old stools, as they are called, produce less sugar than those of the first year's planting, the juice is clearer, and requires far less trouble to prepare and refine. Before another year came round, the boys made a pair of wooden rollers of eighteen inches in diameter. These were covered with strips of <b>hoop</b> <b>iron,</b> nailed lengthways upon them at short intervals from each other, thereby obtaining a better grip upon the canes, and preventing the wood from being bruised and grooved. These rollers were worked by a horse mill, which Mr. Hardy had ordered from England. It was made for five horses, and did a great deal of useful work, grinding the Indian corn into fine flour for home consumption and for sale to neighbouring settlers, and into coarse meal, and pulping the pumpkins and roots for the pigs and other animals.|$|E

50|$|Following {{damage caused}} by a {{windstorm}} in 1933 the rear verandah was enclosed and extended and the kitchen built in its present location. At about this time the originally corrugated iron gabled roof was also replaced by a corrugated iron hipped roof. In about 1942 an air raid shelter was excavated {{to the east of}} the rear of the house, but there is now no clear above ground evidence of this feature. Another notable feature of the house is the use of laced <b>hoop</b> <b>iron</b> to provide screening for the verandah. The <b>hoop</b> <b>iron</b> was originally used at the wool scour to bind wool bale packs and wool bales. Townspeople found the material ideal to create shaded semi-enclosed verandahs. The technique was once seen on most Ilfracombe houses, but now survives only at the Langenbaker house.|$|E

50|$|An {{eighteenth-century}} {{water mill}} at Willsbridge was in operation until the 1960s. Originally used for milling <b>hoop</b> <b>iron,</b> it was converted {{in the early}} nineteenth century for flour production. It has been restored and now serves as a focus for a nature reserve managed by Avon Wildlife Trust. The mouth of the Siston Brook where it joins the Avon was turned into a wharf in the eighteenth century, providing a space for loading barges with coal for nearby collieries. The coal was brought down to the river from mines at Coalpit Heath via a dramway a narrow gauge tramway, worked by gravity.|$|E
50|$|Boards {{provide a}} working surface for {{scaffold}} users. They are seasoned wood {{and come in}} three thicknesses (38 mm (usual), 50 mm and 63 mm) are a standard width (225 mm) and are a maximum of 3.9 m long. The board ends are protected either by metal plates called <b>hoop</b> <b>irons</b> or sometimes nail plates, which often have the company name stamped into them. Timber scaffold boards in the UK should {{comply with the requirements}} of BS 2482. As well as timber, steel or aluminium decking is used, as well as laminate boards. In addition to the boards for the working platform, there are sole boards which are placed beneath the scaffolding if the surface is soft or otherwise suspect, although ordinary boards can also be used. Another solution, called a scaffpad, is made from a rubber base with a base plate moulded inside; these are desirable for use on uneven ground since they adapt, whereas sole boards may split and have to be replaced.|$|R

Around 1828 he established the Ulster Iron Works to produce bar and <b>hoop</b> <b>iron.</b> It had a capacity for manufacturing about 6,000 tons annually. and employed about 300 hands working round the clock shifts. In 1830 Henry Barclay built a paper mill powered by water from the Esopus Creek, which at that location had a fall of thirty-one feet. Barclay imported skilled workers and engineers from England to man his mills.|$|E

50|$|In {{the summer}} of 1842 representatives from the northeastern {{manufacturing}} states began feeling electoral pressures for a tariff hike before the elections that fall and abandoned Clay's land disbursement program. The resulting bill contained the tariff hike alone that satisfied the manufacturers and was acceptable to Tyler, since it lacked the land disbursement provisions. The main beneficiary industry to receive protection under the tariff was iron. Import taxes on iron goods, both raw and manufactured, amounted to almost two thirds of their price overall and exceeded 100% on many items such as nails and <b>hoop</b> <b>iron.</b> The law also raised the percentage of dutiable goods from just over 50% of all imports to over 85% of all imports.|$|E

5000|$|In 1980, Professor D. Lynn Johnson of the Department of Materials Science and Engineering at Northwestern University {{examined}} the remaining plate.

This matches what was stated in an 1879 letter to James T. Cobb, in which Wilbur Fugate confesses to the hoax: [...] "Wiley and I made the hieroglyphics by making impressions on beeswax and filling them with acid and putting it on the plates.
