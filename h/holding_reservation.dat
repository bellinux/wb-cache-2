40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to {{demonstrate}} how Du Bois used fiction to portray sociological facts on race relations impacting an African American community at the beginning of the twentieth century as portrayed by his novel The Quest of the Silver Fleece. It is argued that the African American community depicted in The Quest of the Silver Fleece reflects conditions that were present in Lowndes County, Alabama in 1906. Du Bois therefore utilized fiction to display his sociological findings for the suppressed Lowndes County study. Some may read this report and still <b>hold</b> <b>reservations</b> as to the claim that The Quest of the Silver Fleece reflects what ought to have been present in the Lowndes County study.

40|$|Perceptions of {{communities}} about natural resource conservation are important intermediate outcomes of conservation interventions. This {{is especially important}} in communitybased natural resource management regimes, {{where they need to}} be assessed before the ultimate outcome of conserved natural resources and biodiversity. The assessments of these perceptions are also very important for conservation management purposes. Selected communities in the AfadjatoAgumatsa area in Ghana, West Africa started community forest conservation in 1999 with technical support from a conservation organization as well as financial support from an international agency. At the beginning of the conservation action, forest conservation perceptions were assessed. In this study, we evaluated the changes in perceptions about forest conservation in three communities living in the AfadjatoAgumatsa area in Ghana, between 1999 and 2009. The method we used was a qualitative pretest posttest evaluation. We also assessed which socioeconomic factors predicted peoples’ perceptions about forest conservation. The results suggest that there has been an overall increase in support for forest conservation in the area expressed by the cultural, natural resource and economic benefits and values from the forests since 1999. This increase could be influenced by the cultural and economic benefits that the conservation program introduced. However, some respondents continue to <b>hold</b> <b>reservations</b> about restrictions to the exploitation of natural resources that the conservation program has imposed.

50|$|During the 1920s {{the role}} of {{religion}} was downplayed by the Albanian state who instead promoted Albanianism, a broad civic form of nationalism that looked to highlight ethnonational identity over religious identities. Orthodox Albanians undertook to implement many reforms due to their previous Ottoman status of being an underclass by desiring to move Albania away from its Muslim Ottoman heritage. In Southern Albania, Albanian nationalists (many Orthodox) were the majority in the Korçë region, while west of the Vjosa river and in the Gjirokastër region the Orthodox Albanian population retained Greek sentiments. A generational divide emerged among the Orthodox with youth supporting nationalist ideas due to their perceived modern character, while support for Greece remained with older generations. Among the Orthodox a new group the moderates emerged which supported the state and nationalism while <b>holding</b> <b>reservations</b> about being included in Albania and viewed Greece as an alternative option. In areas such as the Korçë region where Orthodox Albanians became affected by Albanian nationalism they moved away from Orthodox church influence and tended to lose their religious identity, while in areas were the Orthodox population was the majority they often retained their religious identity. A congress of Berat in 1922 was convened to formally lay the foundations of an Albanian Orthodox Church which consecrated Fan Noli as Bishop of Korçë and primate of all Albania while the establishment of the church was seen as important for maintaining Albanian national unity. The Patriarchate in Istanbul recognised the independence or autocephaly of the Orthodox Albanian Church in 1937. In northern-central Albania an attempt was made by Albanian Catholics to secede and create the Republic of Mirdita (1921) with Yugoslav support and assistance due to Catholic claims that the Albanian government was going to ban Catholicism and the secessionist move was put down by Albanian troops. In 1923, an Islamic congress supervised by the Albanian government was convened by Sunni Muslim representatives to consider reforms and among those adopted was a break in ties with the caliphate in Istanbul and to establish local Muslim structures loyal to Albania. Sharia law became subordinated to a new civil law code and Muslims in Albania came under government control. The Bektashi order in 1922 at an assembly of 500 delegates renounced ties with Turkey and by 1925 moved their headquarters to Albania.|$|R
