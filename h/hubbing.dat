25|$|In 1955, a <b>hubbing</b> error {{caused some}} cents to get struck with an obverse die which showed {{doubling}} {{in all of}} the obverse devices, producing a prominent doubling of the date, and to a less noticeable degree, the rest of the obverse. This is known as the 1955 doubled die cent. A similar die error occurred in 1969 on dies used at the San Francisco Mint. While the 1955 doubled die cent is well-known and widely collected, the 1969-S doubled die is far rarer, with an uncirculated specimen selling for as much as $126,500 in a 2008 Heritage auction. The same mechanism produced 1972, 1983, 1984, and 1995 Doubled die cents. Doubled Dies are known for practically every date in the Lincoln cent series, but most are minor, and less impressive compared to the 1955 and the other Doubled Die varieties mentioned here.|$|E
25|$|Another {{less obvious}} error can also occur when heating the dies. After being {{taken out of}} the {{annealing}} furnace, the dies must cool for 24 to 36 hours. They are usually given an oil bath to cool them more quickly, but the dies must still cool for a period of several hours. When the dies are cooling, if they are not stored properly or not allowed to fully cool before being used, the result is a much softer die. When the die is subjected to the <b>hubbing</b> press again and work hardened again, it will be softer and more susceptible to wear. If the die is softer because it was not fully cooled, it will not harden to the same standard as a die which has received proper treatment. However, {{there will not be a}} noticeable difference between a good die and a bad die; the change in the structure of the die does is not apparent until it is used for a period of time.|$|E

50|$|These {{concepts}} {{were made}} {{because of the}} nature of <b>hubs</b> in a network. <b>Hubs</b> are nodes which have lots of links. If we see one link in the <b>hub,</b> there is no difference between the <b>hubs,</b> however, some differences are exited between those nodes; some <b>hubs</b> tend to link to the other nodes and other <b>hubs</b> avoid connecting to the other nodes. We say a <b>hub</b> is assortative when it tends to connect to the other <b>hubs.</b> A dissortative <b>hub</b> avoids connecting to other <b>hubs.</b> If some nodes have some connections with the expected random probabilities, the <b>hubs</b> are neutral. There are three methods to quantify degree correlations.|$|R
50|$|When making working dies, the Mint {{has found}} that by using a lower amount of {{pressure}} in the <b>hubbing</b> press, they can prolong {{the life of the}} hubs and dies used. In between each <b>hubbing,</b> however, the die being made must be subjected to an annealing procedure to soften the steel, making it easier to force the hub's image into the die. As the die is being cold forged in the <b>hubbing</b> press, the die's steel work hardens making the hubbed die harder and stronger than in its original state (an advantage over engraving the die). If, when the die is subjected to another <b>hubbing,</b> it is not lined up exactly with the hub, the result is a secondary image, or doubling. This is called die doubling, and results in such spectacular coins as the famous 1955 doubled die cent.|$|E
50|$|In <b>hubbing,</b> a male hub (master) {{is created}} with a profile that will form an {{impression}} on the female piece. The male hub is generally hardened and the female die block softened by annealing to help form the impression. As the metal flows {{the face of the}} die block is deformed, and, generally, must be machined flat. The die block is often a cylinder that is reinforced with a surrounding steel ring during the <b>hubbing</b> process. <b>Hubbing</b> is usually less expensive than die sinking, i.e., machining the female die, and multiple dies can be made from the male hub.|$|E
50|$|SMS <b>Hubbing</b> {{works with}} the same concept of voice {{connectivity}} model: {{rather than relying on}} costly and multiple individual agreements, voice traffic flows via telehouses, which are basically hubs for voice. In the same way, many operators connect to hubs to transit MMS messages, in an attempt to fix the many interoperability problems with this messaging technology. SMS <b>Hubbing</b> is about simplifying the SMS interworking system, by replacing much of the unproductive, identical investments in international agreements made traditionally by mobile operators. As well as this, SMS <b>Hubbing</b> is about providing a higher level of service to SMS, by introducing end-to-end quality of service through Service Level Agreements (SLAs).|$|E

40|$|<b>Hub</b> {{networks}} play {{an important}} role in many transportation and telecommunications systems. This paper introduces a new model called the <b>hub</b> arc location model. Rather than locate discrete <b>hub</b> facilities, this model locates <b>hub</b> arcs, which have reduced unit flow costs. Four special cases of the general <b>hub</b> arc location model are examined in detail. We provide motivation for the new models, and present examples and optimal solutions, using data for U. S. air passenger traffic. Results are used to compare optimal costs, <b>hub</b> locations, and <b>hub</b> arc locations with corresponding <b>hub</b> median optimal solutions. The results reveal interesting spatial patterns and help identify promising cities and regions for <b>hubs.</b> A companion paper (Campbell et al. 2005) presents integer programming formulations and solution algorithms for the new <b>hub</b> arc problems. It also provides details and computation times for these solution algorithms. <b>hub</b> arc location, <b>hub</b> location, network design...|$|R

Includes bibliographical {{references}} leaves 138 - 150. he <b>hub</b> location problem {{deals with}} finding {{the location of}} <b>hub</b> facilities and allocating the demand nodes to these <b>hub</b> facilities so as to effectively route the demand between origin–destination pairs. <b>Hub</b> location problems arise in various application settings in telecommunication and transportation. In the extensive literature on the <b>hub</b> location problem, it has widely been assumed that the subgraph induced by the <b>hub</b> nodes is complete. Throughout this thesis we relax the complete <b>hub</b> network assumption in <b>hub</b> location problems and focus on designing <b>hub</b> networks that are not necessarily complete. We approach to <b>hub</b> location problems from a network design perspective. In addition to the location and allocation decisions, we also study the decision on how the <b>hub</b> network must be designed. We focus on the single allocation version of the problems where each demand center is allocated to a single <b>hub</b> node. We start with introducing the 3 -stop <b>hub</b> covering network design problem. In this problem, we aim to design <b>hub</b> networks so that all origin– destination pairs receive service by visiting at most three <b>hubs</b> on a route. Then, we include <b>hub</b> network design decisions in the classical <b>hub</b> location problems introduced in the literature. We introduce the single allocation incomplete p-hub median, <b>hub</b> location with fixed costs, <b>hub</b> covering, and p-hub center network design problems to the literature. Lastly, we introduce the multimodal <b>hub</b> location and <b>hub</b> network design problem. We include {{the possibility of using}} different <b>hub</b> links, and allow for different transportation modes between <b>hubs,</b> and for different types of service time promises between origin–destination pairs, while designing the <b>hub</b> network in the multimodal problem. In this problem, we jointly consider transportation costs and travel times, which are studied separately in <b>hub</b> location problems presented in the literature. Computational analyses with all of the proposed models are presented on the various instances of the CAB data set and on the Turkish network. Alumur, Sibel AlevPh. D...|$|R

In this study, we focus on cargo applications of the <b>hub</b> location problem. Through observations from the Turkish cargo sector, we propose a new mathematical model for the <b>hub</b> location problem that relaxes the complete <b>hub</b> network assumption. Our model minimizes the cost of establishing <b>hubs</b> and <b>hub</b> links, while designing a network that services each origin-destination pair within a time bound. We formulate a single-allocation <b>hub</b> covering model that permits visiting at most three <b>hubs</b> on a route.
