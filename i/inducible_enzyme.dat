5000|$|An {{adaptive}} enzyme or <b>inducible</b> <b>enzyme</b> is an enzyme that is expressed only under {{conditions in which}} it is clear of adaptive value, as opposed to a constitutive enzyme which is produced all the time.The <b>Inducible</b> <b>enzyme</b> is used for the breaking-down of things in the cell. It is also a part of the Operon Model, which illustrates a way for genes to turn [...] "on" [...] and [...] "off".The Inducer causes the gene to turn on (controlled by the amount of reactant which turns the gene on). Then there's the repressor protein that turns genes off. The inducer can remove this repressor, turning genes back on. The operator is a section of DNA where the repressor binds to shut off certain genes; the promoter is the section of DNA where the RNA polymerase binds. Lastly, the regulatory gene is the gene for the repressor protein.An example of <b>inducible</b> <b>enzyme</b> is COX-2 which is synthesized in macrophages to produce Prostaglandin E2 while the constitutive enzyme COX-1 (another isozyme in COX family) is always produced in variety of organs in body (like stomach).|$|E

40|$|We {{have studied}} the effect of distamycin A on the {{synthesis}} of <b>inducible</b> <b>enzymes</b> in Escherichia coli strain ~ 1 2. Distamycin A did not inhibit the growth of E. coli ~ 1 2 when the micro-organism already contained con-stitutive or <b>inducible</b> <b>enzymes</b> for the metabolism of sugars. The growth of E. coli was prevented when distamycin A was present during the enzymic induction. Distamycin A inhibited the formation of inducible P-galactosidase; {{the activity of the}} antibiotic was directly related to its concentration, but independent of the concentration of the inducer. Thus it does not seem that distamycin A causes a decrease of the concentration of inducer.

40|$|Two {{types of}} kynureninase were {{isolated}} from Neurospora crassa LFO 6068. The formation {{of one of}} them, which was separated from the inducible kynureninase by DEAE-celluIose chromatography, was independent {{of the presence of}} tryptophan in the growth medium. Ouchterlony double-diffusion analysis and immunochemical titration indicated that the constitutive-type enzyme is immunologically different from the <b>inducible</b> <b>enzyme.</b> We con-firmed by a selective assay method with antiserum that the addition of tryptophan to the medium does not affect the formation of one of the enzymes (constitutive-type). The con-stitutive kynureninase was purified approximately 650 -fold and was free of the <b>inducible</b> <b>enzyme</b> as judged by analytical gel electrophoresis. The molecular weight and optimum pH values of both enzymes are very similar. However, the constitutive enzyme shows much higher activity and affinity for L- 3 -hydroxykynurenine than for L-kynurenine, suggesting that the enzyme functions biosynthetically as a 3 -hydroxykynureninase. Constitutive kynureninase activities were widely found in all the fungi tested, whereas the <b>inducible</b> <b>enzyme</b> activity was not present in Mucor or Rhizopus species.

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are widely used to reduce pain associated with acute or chronic inflammation.

40|$|An {{attempt was}} made to {{determine}} whether sporulation and <b>inducible</b> <b>enzyme</b> synthesis in Bacillus subtilis are controlled by the same mechanism of catabolite repression. By the use of a thymine-requiring strain, it has been shown that, whereas sporulation remained repressed unless chromosome replication proceeded to completion, the induction of the enzymes histidase, sucrase, and α-glucosidase proceeded quite normally in the absence of continued deoxyribonucleic acid synthesis. It is concluded that the mechanism for overcoming the repression of sporulation differs qualitatively from that involved in overcoming the repression of <b>inducible</b> <b>enzyme</b> synthesis. Attempts to isolate pleiotropic mutants that would provide additional support for this contention were unsuccessful.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} the sequence of reactions leading from tetrachloro-para-hydroquinone to 1, 2, 4 -trihydroxybenzene by <b>inducible</b> <b>enzymes</b> of Rhodococcus chlorophenolicus. Tetrachlorohydroquinone was first converted to a dichlorotrihydroxybenzene in a reaction involving both hydrolytic and reductive dechlorination; no trichlorinated intermediate was detected. Dichlorotrihydroxybenzene was subsequently reductively dechlorinated to a monochlorotrihydroxybenzene and finally to 1, 2, 4 -trihydroxybenzene. The cell extract also catalyzed, at a lower rate, reductive dechlorination of trichlorohydroquinone, mainly to 2, 3 -dichlorohydroquinone.

40|$|Mixed-substrate {{microbial}} growth {{is among the}} most intensely studied systems in molecular microbiology. Several mathematical models have been developed to account for the genetic regulation of such systems, especially those resulting in diauxic growth. In this work, we compare the dynamics of three such models (Narang, Biotech. Bioeng., 59, 116, 1998; Thattai & Shraiman, Biophys. J, 85, 744, 2003; Brandt et al, Water Research, 38, 1004, 2004). We show that these models are dynamically similar - the initial motion of the <b>inducible</b> <b>enzymes</b> in all the models is described by Lotka-Volterra equations for competing species. The dynamic similarity occurs because in all the models, the <b>inducible</b> <b>enzymes</b> possess properties characteristic of competing species: Their synthesis is autocatalytic, and they inhibit each other. Despite this dynamic similarity, the models vary with respect to the range of dynamics captured. The Brandt et al model captures only the diauxic growth pattern, whereas the remaining two models capture both diauxic and non-diauxic growth patterns. The models also differ with respect to the mechanisms that generate the mutual inhibition between the enzymes. In the Narang model, the mutual inhibition occurs because the enzymes for each substrate enhance the dilution of the enzymes for the other substrate. In the Thattai & Shraiman model, the mutual inhibition is entirely due to competition for the phosphoryl groups. Comment: 5 figure...|$|R

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that the {{capacity}} of a heterogeneous microbial population for oxidative assimilation of glucose can be renewed by periodically subjecting the sludge (or a portion of it) to endogenous respiration in the presence of an exogenous source of nitrogen. Further study of this system led to a modification of the activated sludge process for nitrogen-deficient wastes. However, it was not known whether renewal of oxidative assimilation capacity was possible for substrates which required the presence of <b>inducible</b> <b>enzyme(s)</b> or for substrates which were not carbohydrates. Therefore, studies with lactose and acetate as carbon sources were designed. Both carbon sources were removed under conditions of oxidative assimilation, and the storage products (or a portion of these products) were converted into protein when the sludge was subjected to a period of endogenous respiration (with respect to carbon source) in the presence of an exogenous supply of ammonium sulfate. The “regenerated” sludge exhibited a renewed capacity for oxidative assimilation, thereby indicating that requisite <b>inducible</b> <b>enzymes</b> (e. g., β-galactosidase in the case of lactose; iso-citritase and malate synthetase in the case of acetate) were not diluted out in the endogenous phase to a degree sufficient to hamper renewed oxidative assimilation capacity.

40|$|The {{mechanism}} of glucose repression of <b>inducible</b> <b>enzyme</b> synthesis in the obligatory aerobic yeast Rhodotorula gracilis has been investigated. Induction of the D-xylose catabolizing enzyme {{system has been}} used as the test-tool. It has been found that: the cell interior only after all the D-glucose has been consumed. 1. D-Glucose blocks the uptake of D-XylOSe from a mixture of the two aldoses. D-Xylose enters 2. D-Fructose, D-galactose, D- and L-arabinose do not affect the uptake of D-xylose. 3. Accordingly, D-glUCOBe represses induction of the D-xylose catabolizing enzyme system, whereas D-fructose, D-galactose, D- and L-arabinose do not. 4. D-Glucose is without effect in cells which have been preincubated with D-xylose, whereby the latter is accumulated in the cells. In this case, D-xylose catabolism proceeds simultaneously with that of D-glucose. 5. D-Glucose does not interfere with enzyme induction if D-xylose has already been accumulat-ed in the cells. 6. 3 -O-Methyl-~-glucose, an unmetabolizable analogue of D-glucose, exhibits the same effect on <b>inducible</b> <b>enzyme</b> synthesis started with D-xylose as D-glUCOSe does...|$|E
