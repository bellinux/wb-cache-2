In this context, the study assesses the impact of movements in nominal and {{real effective exchange rate}} on economic activity. In particular, the paper refines the analysis by dichotomizing economic activity into tradable and non-tradable industries as well as exploring the presence of nonlinearity. The results demonstrate that depreciation of the <b>Jamaica</b> <b>Dollar,</b> positively impacts economic activity. Furthermore, there exists asymmetry in {{the exchange rate}}-growth relationship in that the positive impact of depreciation is reduced during high inflation episodes, thus highlighting the importance of price stability. The study also examines the difference in investment behaviour in response to movements in the exchange rate in the manufacturing industry and finds that firm investment decisions react positively to depreciation as well as to growth in sales...|$|E

The choice of the name dollar was motivated {{by the fact that the}} reduced value of the new unit corresponded more closely to the value of the US dollar than it did to the pound sterling.|$|R
