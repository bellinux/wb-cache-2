40|$|In this essay, I offer a {{sympathetic}} {{reading of the}} rhetoric(s) of Augustine’s Confessions. First, as a historian of rhetoric <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> what Augustine’s narrative {{can tell us about}} the theory and practice of rhetoric in the late classical period and the early Christian era. From this perspective, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> exploring what Augustine discloses about the rhetoric he learned in the provincial Roman schools, and taught at Carthage, Rome, and Milan. Second, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> Augustine’s own work on rhetoric, especially his De Doctrina Christiana, most of which he composed during the period right before he began the Confessions. <b>In</b> particular, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> how the rhetorical ethics that emerges from Augustine’s formal treatment of Biblical exegesis and preaching, and which distinguishes Augustine’s rhetoric from that of his classical predecessors, can illuminate our interpretation of the Confessions. Finally, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> exploring how the Confessions itself works as a rhetorical text— that is, as a discourse addressed to an audience for the purpose of influence. <b>In</b> particular, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> exploring the specific pastoral functions served by Augustine’s narrative...|$|R

500|$|Tom Epperson, who {{had struck}} up a {{friendship}} with Spacey while writing an early screenplay draft of The Shipping News, was hired to write a new draft for Beyond the Sea. Epperson's script included Darin's penchant for orgies after his divorce with Sandra Dee. Spacey, finding the Epperson script to be overtly dark and morbid, began to rewrite Beyond the Sea, incorporating info from the 1987 Lewis Colick script. Spacey acknowledged he portrayed Darin in an exaggeratedly sympathetic way, and decided not to centrally depict {{the darker side of}} Darin's life. [...] "The other scripts made Bobby [...] a rather unlikable figure," [...] he explained.

She wanted to have the [...] "whole Moroccan/orchestral/super-romantic/man-carrying-the-woman-he-loves-across-the-desert vibe" [...] for the track.

Madonna then began writing songs with Leonard, who had produced many songs for Madonna in the late 1980s. Unlike her previous albums, Leonard's song writing collaborations were accompanied by very little studio input. Madonna believed that Leonard's production [...] "would have lent the songs more of a Peter Gabriel vibe", a sound {{that she did not}} want for the album. Guy Oseary, chairman of Maverick Records, then phoned British electronic musician William Orbit, and suggested that he send some songs to Madonna. Orbit sent a 13-track digital audio tape to Madonna.
