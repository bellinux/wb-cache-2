On 20 October 2017 it ceased manufacturing vehicles in Australia.|$|E
5|$|Prior to 1920, Guinness <b>export</b> <b>sales</b> {{were mostly}} to ethnic Anglo Saxons and Celts. From the 1920s onwards this changed, {{and among the}} first natives to develop a taste for the drink were the ethnic Chinese of the Malay Peninsula. In 1924, a global Guinness {{salesman}} was appointed by the company, and sales began to be pursued among native populations.|$|E
5|$|The F-22 {{cannot be}} {{exported}} under American federal law {{to protect its}} stealth technology and other high-tech features. Customers for U.S. fighters are acquiring earlier designs such as the F-15 Eagle and F-16 Fighting Falcon or the newer F-35 Lightning II, which contains technology from the F-22 but {{was designed to be}} cheaper, more flexible, and available for export. In September 2006, Congress upheld the ban on foreign F-22 sales. Despite the ban, the 2010 defense authorization bill included provisions requiring the DoD to prepare a report on the costs and feasibility for an F-22 export variant, and another report on the effect of F-22 <b>export</b> <b>sales</b> on U.S. aerospace industry.|$|E
40|$|This study aims to {{find out}} and to {{understand}} about how the <b>export</b> <b>sale</b> system is applied by PT. Mondrian so that the strength and weakness of system applied can be known by comparing with the existing theory. The method {{used in the study}} was qualitative method, that is, the research method the data source of which constitutes the statement or sentences only. One way used to evaluate this <b>export</b> <b>sale</b> system was by comparing the existing system with the theoretical foundation of system used, so that we can find out the strength and weakness of system applied in the <b>export</b> <b>sale</b> system by PT. Mondrian. Items evaluated include the related functions, used documents, used accounting records, and procedure links creating the <b>export</b> <b>sale</b> system as well as the internal control system applied in the <b>export</b> <b>sale</b> system of PT. Mondrian. From the result of evaluation on <b>export</b> <b>sale</b> system, it can be found out that: the company has separated the functions well, has a good authorization system and recording procedure and had used the printed sequence number-document as well as had applied the healthy practices. Nevertheless, there is still a little weakness in the <b>export</b> <b>sale</b> system applied, that is, there is still dualistic function and the company had not used yet the accounting recording constituting the warehouse card and inventory card.

5|$|As part of Lockheed's submission, {{the firm}} offered a formal {{guarantee}} of a 20 per cent workshare on all future <b>export</b> <b>sales</b> of its Orion 2000 while simultaneously lobbying for the United States Navy to also procure the type. Loral {{stated that it}} believed that its bid to refurbish stored P-3s was the most cost-effective submission; however, there was public controversy over whether Loral possessed the necessary technical information on the airframe, claims to which Loral strongly refuted. In May 1996, {{it was reported that}} bidders were considering self-funding their own early development costs in order to compensate for alleged funding shortfalls within the MoD's procurement budget; it was claimed that these funding shortfalls were due to differences between the original specification, which had envisioned as an off-the-shelf procurement without much in terms of development, and the increasingly extensive nature that the programme had progressively taken on.|$|E
5|$|In March 1996, British Aerospace {{promoted}} {{the option of}} establishing a production line to manufacture new-build Nimrod MRA4 aircraft {{as an alternative to}} the refurbishment of existing airframes, this was reportedly motivated by service concerns regarding attrition rates of the existing aircraft. It was also announced that preliminary talks had been conducted with the South African Air Force on the topic of the Nimrod 2000; British Aerospace were also considering the merits of using a newly developed variant of the General Electric CF34 turbofan powerplant, which General Electric had formally proposed the specific use of to power the type. In June 1996, British Aerospace announced that it had partnered with McDonnell Douglas to market new-build Nimrod 2000s to the export market; it has been claimed that this move was in response to scepticism from the MoD over the prospects of <b>export</b> <b>sales</b> for the type. British Aerospace argued that the Nimrod 2000's selection would give it entry to the global maritime patrol aircraft market.|$|E
5|$|The Menzies {{government}} {{was reluctant to}} choose as interim replacement the A-5 or the F-4, {{which could not be}} deployed until 1966 and would cost A$120–180 million. Waiting for the TSR-2 or TFX in 1969 or 1970 seemed to pose great risk, but when considering Hancock's findings in September 1963 it {{wanted to be able to}} offer a substantial response to the Labor party's criticism of its defence strategy. The British and American governments competed on behalf of their nations' unbuilt bombers, as both believed that <b>export</b> <b>sales</b> would increase domestic support for the aircraft. The Menzies government viewed the British promise to deploy a squadron of V bombers in Australia for interim defense until the TSR-2 was ready as unacceptable for both technical and political reasons. Beyond its cost, the Royal Air Force had not ordered the TSR-2; the Chief of the Defence Staff Lord Louis Mountbatten, who opposed it, advised the Australians against buying the aircraft and the RAAF feared being the only customer.|$|E

5|$|In October 2011, Heineken {{sold the}} McEwan's beer brands to Wells & Young's for around £20 million, and {{production}} of McEwan's Best Scotch and canned and bottled brands moved to Bedford. The new owners vowed to reintroduce McEwan's as a cask ale brand and launch an expanded premium bottled range. Together with the Younger's brands McEwan's generates £80 million of sales annually in the UK, and McEwan's is now the largest Wells & Young's brand. It is the highest-selling ale brand in Scotland where it has a 20 per cent market share. Like most largely pasteurised ale brands in the UK {{it has been in}} a state of managed decline. The beers are sold predominantly in Scotland and the north of England; a small amount is exported to Italy. 2012 saw the launch of McEwan's Export in bottles, and a new seasonal cask-conditioned golden ale called McEwan's Gold. In 2013, <b>export</b> <b>sales</b> to Canada were resumed, having been discontinued under Heineken. In April 2013 McEwan's Red was launched, aimed at younger drinkers and with the intention of expanding the brand into England. McEwan's beers began to be sold in France in April 2013. The bottled beers McEwan's Amber and Signature were launched in July 2013.|$|E
