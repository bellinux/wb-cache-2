25|$|Some {{scholars}} {{take the}} term kenning broadly to include any noun-substitute {{consisting of two}} or more elements, including merely descriptive epithets (such as Old Norse grand viðar “bane of wood” = “fire” (Snorri Sturluson: Skáldskaparmál 36)), while others would restrict it to metaphorical instances (such as Old Norse sól húsanna “sun of the houses” = “fire” (Snorri Sturluson: Skáldskaparmál 36)), specifically those where “he base-word identifies the referent with something which it is not, except in a specially conceived relation which the poet imagines between it and the sense of the limiting element'” (Brodeur (1959) pp.248–253). Some even exclude naturalistic metaphors such as Old English forstes bend “bond of frost” = “ice” or winter-ġewǣde “winter-raiment” = “snow”: “A metaphor is a kenning only if it contains an <b>incongruity</b> <b>between</b> the referent and the meaning of the base-word; in the kenning the limiting word is essential to the figure because without it the incongruity would make any identification impossible” (Brodeur (1959) pp.248–253). Descriptive epithets are a common literary device {{in many parts of the}} world, whereas kennings in this restricted sense are a distinctive feature of Old Norse and, to a lesser extent, Old English poetry.|$|E

25|$|Prior {{argues that}} {{although}} some of these women {{may appear to be}} engaging in traditional subordinate or submissive roles, BDSM allows women in both dominant and submissive roles to express and experience personal power through their sexual identities. In a study that she conducted in 2013, she found {{that the majority of the}} women she interviewed identified as bottom, submissive, captive, or slave. In turn, Prior was able to answer whether or not these women found an <b>incongruity</b> <b>between</b> their sexual identities and feminist identity. Her research found that these women saw little to no incongruity, and in fact felt that their feminist identity supported identities of submissive and slave. For them these are sexually and emotionally fulfilling roles and identities that, in some cases, feed other aspects of their lives. Prior contends that third wave feminism provides a space for women in BDSM communities to express their sexual identities fully, even when those identities seem counter-intuitive to the ideals of feminism. Furthermore, women who do identify as submissive, sexually or otherwise, find a space within BDSM where they can fully express themselves as integrated, well-balanced, and powerful women.|$|E

Therefore, factors essentially influencing on expected and experienced university images were identified.

The study was conducted in July and August 2013 at Lappeenranta University of Technology by means of a web-based research survey. The sample consisted of 160 international Master’s degree students who were admitted in 2011, 2012 and 2013. Descriptive and multivariate statistical analysis methods were used to process the data. The results of the study indicated statistically significant <b>incongruities</b> <b>between</b> the case university’s identity and its students’ images.

[...] Moreover, research suggests that when women are acknowledged to have been successful, they are less liked and more personally derogated than equivalently successful men. Assertive women who display masculine, agentic traits are viewed as violating prescriptions of feminine niceness and are penalized for violating the status order.|$|E

[...] Q magazine said she [...] "now has a voice brimming with womanly promise." [...] Dorian Lynskey of The Guardian called Back to Black [...] "a 21st-century soul classic". Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine said that Winehouse and her producers are [...] "expert mood-setters or crafty reconstructionists". Victoria Segal from The Times stated [...] "these are explicit, honest songs ... from a thoroughly modern milieu". The Observers Stuart Nicholson said the record succeeds because of [...] "clever melody lines and smart lyrics". Jon Pareles of The New York Times called the album [...] "a wonderfully time-twisted batch of songs", while Andy Gill hailed its [...] "rejection of genre clichés".
