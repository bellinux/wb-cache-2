He also coordinated the Brooklyn Naval Yard Garrison of the organization later, that participated in the Freedom Train Brooklyn display at the Vanderveer Park freight yards of the Long Island Rail Road. There were thousands that saw the one-day Brooklyn event that displayed Americana and original nineteenth-century historical documents in the rail cars.

Its connection to Marvel's Cinematic Universe is clear: This is where viewers <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> fallout of Hydra's S.H.I.E.L.D. infiltration.

His family stated: [...] "It is our hope through airing this show that people will <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> side of Adam that we knew and loved. The decision to air the show has been difficult, but we do this with the profound belief that it will inspire others to seek help". Favreau also consulted people close to Goldstein about whether the footage of him in Iron Man 2 should still be used; they agreed unanimously it should remain. Favreau said that following his death, [...] "there was never any doubt" [...] the film would be dedicated to him.|$|E
500|$|... "Behind These Hazel Eyes" [...] {{is a power}} ballad {{that was}} written by Clarkson, Max Martin, and Dr. Luke and {{produced}} by the latter two.

It is composed in the key of F sharp minor with Clarkson's vocal range spanning over two octaves from F#3 to F#5. The bridge was {{the only part of}} the song that was written by Dr. Luke and Martin together with Clarkson face to face. The song begins with Clarkson wailing [...] "oh oh oh" [...] over a restless percussion. In the first verse, the music becomes quiet to focus on Clarkson's vocal as she wails [...] "Seems like just yesterday/You were a part of me/I used to stand so tall/I used to be so strong/Your arms around me tight/Everything it felt so right/Unbreakable like nothing could go wrong." [...] During the chorus, the sound of electronic guitar is dominant as she vocalizes [...] "Here I am/Once again/I’m torn into pieces/Can’t deny it/Can’t pretend/Just thought you were the one/Broken up deep inside/But you won’t <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> tears I cry/Behind these hazel eyes."

500|$|In 2004, Dan Castellaneta won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance in [...] "Today I Am a Clown", {{an episode}} that heavily {{features}} Krusty. Several episodes featuring Krusty {{have been very}} well received. In 2007, Vanity Fair named [...] "Krusty Gets Kancelled" [...] as the ninth best episode of The Simpsons. John Ortved felt, [...] "This is Krusty's best episode— better than the reunion with his father, or the Bar Mitzvah episode, which won an Emmy much later on. The incorporation of guest stars as themselves is topnotch, and we <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> really dark side of Krusty's flailing showbiz career. Hollywood, television, celebrities, and fans are all beautifully skewered here." [...] Matt Groening cites [...] "Krusty Gets Busted" [...] as his ninth favorite episode and {{has said that he}} particularly loves Castellaneta's voice work. Groening claims that he has to leave the room every time Castellaneta records as Krusty for fear of ruining the take. Star News Online named [...] "Krusty the Clown's hatred of children", Kamp Krusty, and Krusty's line [...] "All these rules, I feel like I'm in a strip club" [...] as some of the four hundred reasons why they loved The Simpsons. The Observer listed two Krusty products, [...] "Krusty's Non-Toxic Kologne" [...] and [...] "Krusty's home pregnancy kit", as part of their list of the three hundred reasons why they loved the show.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Newport (Ymerodraeth State of Mind)" [...] parodies the song, {{replacing}} {{references to the}} [...] "Empire State" [...] of New York with of the smaller Welsh city of Newport. In the Welsh language Ymerodraeth means [...] "empire". [...] "Newport (Ymerodraeth State of Mind)" [...] was directed by British filmmaker M-J Delaney and featured London-based actors Alex Warren and Terema Wainwright, rapping and singing respectively. Days after its release Delaney said: [...] "I hope Jay-Z and Alicia <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> video {{as long as their}} publishing people don't force us to take it offline. It's only tongue in cheek." [...] Its participants were invited to appear on national television news and their work was reported in national newspapers. Their work was also so well received in Wales that they were invited to the reopening of the Newport Transporter Bridge. It achieved viral video status when it reached nearly a million hits in 3 days and, by August 2010, nearly 2.5million people had watched it on YouTube. In July both Warren and Wainwright met with Universal Records (the music publishers) to discuss releasing the track as a single, with some of the proceeds going to the mental health charity Newport Mind. But the seven co-writers of [...] "Empire State of Mind" [...] refused to give permission for the Newport single, a situation which led to the video being removed from YouTube on August 10.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with SFX producer Phil Collinson stated that after the Doctor regenerates the [...] "initial dynamic changes because [...] has to learn to trust him again". Piper added that as the Doctor is incapacitated Rose consequently feels [...] "unloved", [...] "isolated" [...] and [...] "like she's lost her best friend". In the Doctor's absence Rose relies on her observations of him and tries to mimic his actions. Collinson {{felt it was important}} to resolve any mistrust between the pair {{by the end of the}} Christmas Special, as the public had responded well to Rose and the Doctor's friendship previously. Davies had scripted dialogue in [...] "The Christmas Invasion" [...] explaining the newly regenerated Doctor's estuary English accent by stating he had imprinted on Rose and adopted her way of speaking. However, due to time constraints this sequence was not filmed. Discussing how Rose had developed by the second series, Piper described her as having [...] "come on in leaps and bounds" [...] and stated she is now [...] "a lot more proactive." [...] She felt that there is a [...] "different kind of energy" [...] between Rose and the Tenth Doctor, whilst Tennant remarked that the audience would <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> Doctor-companion relationship [...] "developing and becoming something that it maybe hasn't before." [...] Piper stated that with the Tenth Doctor, Rose is [...] "more tetchy and more possessive" [...] over him as [...] "she feels like she's lost him once and doesn't want to lose him again". She cited Rose's [...] "catfight" [...] with former companion Sarah Jane Smith in [...] "School Reunion" [...] as evidence of this. Discussing the possibility of Rose and the Tenth Doctor becoming more romantically involved Piper stated [...] "You want it to happen, but at the same time you don't want it to happen". Tennant likened the dynamic between the pair to that of Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) and Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) in The X-Files. Both Tennant and Piper agreed that the expectation of the relationship is more exciting than having it realised. To add to the tragedy of their separation, Davies scripted the series two story arc so that Rose and the Doctor would be indirectly responsible for their separation. [...] "It's deliberate when that happens [...] ", said Davies, [...] "and they do pay the price. In [...] "Tooth and Claw", they set up the very thing— Torchwood— that separates them in the end. It's sort of their own fault." [...] Though Davies left the Doctor's response to Rose's declaration of love in [...] "Doomsday" [...] unstated, Gardner felt strongly that the character reciprocated her feelings. On the commentary for the episode she stated that she would [...] "confirm to the world" [...] that he was going to [...] "say it back." ...|$|E

Due to their 50/50 arrangement, Hole inadvertently subsidized a huge portion of the large cost of mounting Manson's shows which depleted their revenue.

[...] Moffett had previously auditioned for a role in [...] "The Unicorn and the Wasp" [...] in 2007.

Moffett previously appeared alongside her father in the Big Finish audio story Red Dawn and drama series Fear, Stress & Anger.
