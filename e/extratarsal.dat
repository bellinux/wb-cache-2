40|$|The <b>extratarsal</b> spur in extant {{monotremes}} {{consists of}} an os calcaris and a cornu calcaris. A poisonous <b>extratarsal</b> spur oc− curs only in the platypus (Ornithorhynchus); a possibly secondarily non−poisonous spur is present in echidnas (Tachy− glossus and Zaglossus). Some therian mammals (e. g., bats), reptiles (Chamaeleo), and amphibians have a spur−like struc− ture in the ankle, {{but this is not}} homologous to the <b>extratarsal</b> spur of monotremes. Among fossil mammals, the co−ossified os calcaris and ossified cornu calcaris have been found in the eutriconodontan Gobiconodon and in the spalacotheroid “symmetrodontan ” Zhangheotherium. Here we describe the os calcaris in several multituberculate mammals from the Late Cretaceous of the Gobi Desert, Mongolia. The multituberculate os calcaris is a large, flat bone, generally similar to that in males of the extant monotreme species, but the cornu calcaris is not ossified. In Gobiconodon and Zhangheotherium the os− sified cornu calcaris is fused to the os calcaris probably to provide the bony support for the keratinous spur. We hypothesize that the os calcaris in these Mesozoic mammal groups is homologous to that of monotremes. However, the <b>extratarsal</b> spur has not been found in non−mammalian cynodonts nor in other synapsids. A platypus−like os calcaris might be an apomorphic characteristic of basal Mesozoic mammals and is secondarily lost in crown therians; the os calcaris is con− firmed to be absent in well−preserved tarsal structures of the earliest known crown therian mammals. We speculate that the os calcaris, the cornu calcaris, and its associated venom gland might have served the function of a defensive structure dur− ing the “dark ages ” of mammalian history, when dinosaurs ruled the Earth. This structure is a plesiomorphic characte...|$|E
40|$|Three {{cases of}} atypical, <b>extratarsal</b> chalazia are presented. All three {{patients}} initially {{presented with a}} history of an inflammatory mass close to the lid margin. Inferior migration subsequently occurred, with loss of connection to the tarsus, causing confusion in the diagnosis. The basis for this migration is postulated to be the anatomical relationships of the tarsus, postorbicular fascia, and lower eyelid retractors. A good response was obtained with standard surgical therapy...|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} an incomplete postcranial skeleton of Catopsbaatar catopsaloides from the ?late Campanian red beds of Hermiin Tsav I, in the Gobi Desert, Mongolia. The skeleton is fragmentary and {{the preservation of}} bone surface does not permit reconstruction of the musculature. The studied skeleton contains some parts not preserved or incompletely known in other multituberculate genera, such as a long spinous process in a single lumbar vertebra, which together with long transverse processes preserved in Nemegtbaatar, might indicate {{that at least some}} multituberculates had jumping ability. The calcaneus of Catopsbaatar is unusual, differing from most other multituberculates (where known) and other mammals by having a short tuber calcanei, with a large proximal anvil−shaped process strongly bent laterally and ventrally, arranged obliquely with respect to the distal margin of the calcaneus, rather than arranged at 90 to it, as in other mammals. This suggests the presence of strong muscles that attached to the tuber calcanei, perhaps further attesting to jumping abilities in Catopsbaatar. We also describean unfused pelvic girdle and the first <b>extratarsal</b> spur bone (os cornu calcaris) known in multituberculates...|$|E
