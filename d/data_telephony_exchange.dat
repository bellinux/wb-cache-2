40|$|With {{the advent}} of VoIP {{transport}} and videoconferencing/telepresence equipment at relative low costs, companies started to use a single provider for <b>data,</b> <b>telephony</b> and video, thus causing three types of transport –with different characteristics and requirements- to converge in a single hard link. The current converging networks carry packages related to three different kinds of services (data, voice and video) {{and one of the}} usual classification criteria draws a distinction between traffic with strict time requirements and all other services. As bandwidth is always limited, it is necessary to identify and give priority treatment to this kind of traffic over others sharing the same medium.

40|$|AbstractThe article {{deals with}} a design of a new {{automatically}} provisioned embedded system. Through the years of our active development a highly advanced platform has been created. This platform, called BEESIP, is meant for the embedded network devices, and allows them to act as <b>telephony</b> <b>exchanges,</b> secured access points, VPN concentrators, etc. As the key feature of the BEESIP platform a unique building and provisioning system of the network devices has been developed allowing the administrators to fully control the firmware and configuration of the devices even in the remote and inaccessible locations. The process of custom firmware building and device provisioning eases the mass deployment of the BEESIP based hardware to cover the needs of small to medium businesses in vast range of services. This paper describes the latest progress in development and the proposition of the BEESIP system, {{which is based on}} one of the popular Linux distributions for the embedded devices. The developed system is fully adoptable and each component is reusable on any other Linux distribution. This system introduces several components for several areas, such as security, PBX, provisioning or management.

To investigate this problem, we have probed ETH’s campus network, which spans the metropolitan area of Zurich, for several weeks.
