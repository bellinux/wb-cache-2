40|$|Treaties {{have evolved}} {{significantly}} since the {{ratification of the}} United States Constitution, leading to uncertainty as to the constitutional limits on their domestic execution. This Note adapts existing constitutional doctrine on treaty execution to two distinct complications arising in the contemporary treaty regime. First, voluntary treaties imposing aspirational obligations on signatories {{raise the issue of}} the <b>extent</b> <b>of</b> <b>obligations</b> that Congress may domestically enforce by federal statute. Second, originating treaties which create international organizations and authorize them to adopt rule- and adjudication-type post-treaty pronouncements bring up a question of when, if ever, to incorporate those pronouncements into U. S. law, and at what level of legal precedence. Drawing on historical foundations, constitutional case law, and policy considerations in light of the evolving treaty regime, this Note proposes constitutional tests to address both developments. This Note introduces a two-step reasonableness inquiry for statutes executing voluntary treaties, based on the reasonableness of the statute in light of (1) the language and goals of the treaty, as well as (2) U. S. involvement in the treaty. For post-treaty pronouncements, this Note suggests that such pronouncements should be incorporated into U. S. law if they (1) do not violate a provision of the U. S. Constitution and (2) are valid under the originating treaty’s procedural and substantive law. Post-treaty pronouncements that pass this test should be incorporated at the same level of precedence as federal statutes in order to best address concerns regarding the balance between the federal government and states’ constitutionally protected powers. The complex methodology proposed in this Note provides a necessary mechanism for navigating an increasingly complex international legal order...|$|E
40|$|The general {{problem of}} moral luck—that {{responsibility}} is profoundly affected by factors {{beyond the control}} of the person held responsible—has two distinct dimensions in the case of accidental injury (and no doubt in many other cases). One dimension is concerned with attribution of moral blame. Thomas Nagel explains: “If one negligently leaves the bath running with the baby in it, one will realize, as one bounds up the stairs towards the bathroom, that if the baby has drowned one has done something awful, whereas if it has not one has merely been careless. ” How badly one has behaved and hence how much one should be blamed turns on consequences beyond one’s control—on luck. The other dimension concerns the existence and extent of one’s responsibility for having done harm, one’s obligation to someone harmed to make amends for or repair the harm done. Someone who has been careless and lucky enough not to injure anyone has no such obligation. Someone who has been equally careless and inflicted a devastating injury may well have a ruinous obligation. In contrast to one another, the first of these dimensions seems distinctively more moral and the second distinctively more legal. The extent of the agent’s culpability, the degree to which he or she should be blamed, strikes us as predominantly a matter of moral assessment. We are appraising a person, determining what sort of mark should be entered on the ledger of his life and character. The existence and <b>extent</b> <b>of</b> <b>obligations</b> of reparation, by contrast, strikes us as predominantly a matter of legal liability. We are settling the responsibility of an injurer to her victim. But it would be an error to draw too sharp a distinction between the moral and the legal. A legal judgment of negligence expresses criticism and disapproval of the conduct involved, and {{it is a mistake to}} purge that legal criticism of any moral dimension. So, too, the legal obligation to repair harm wrongly inflicted imposed by the tort law of negligence overlaps with a perceived moral obligation of the same kind, and is no doubt at least partially rooted in and justified by that perceived moral obligation. Because the moral and the legal interpenetrate in these ways, our judgments about the role that moral luck should play in on our assessments of the moral culpability of persons cannot be wholly divorced from our judgments about the role that moral luck should play in our assessment of the legal liability of persons. It is significant, then, that Thomas Nagel in one of the articles naming the problem of “moral luck” condemns strict liability as an “irrational... moral position” in contradistinction to negligence liability, which takes a defensible position on moral luck. Negligence liability is morally defensible because it holds people “responsible for the contributions of fate as well as for their own—provided they have made some contribution to begin with. ” The comparative irrationality of strict liability, however, cannot turn on the fact that it holds people accountable solely for fate. It doesn’t. Holding “the contributions of fate” constant for the moment, strict liability holds people accountable for harms attributable to their agency whereas negligence liability holds people accountable for harms attributable to their culpable agency. If strict liability is morally irrational it must be because it is irrational to hold people accountable for the consequences of their agency, as opposed to for the consequences of their faulty agency. Perhaps there is some reason why this is the case, though I am inclined to doubt it. But if there is some such reason it is not rooted in moral luck. On the contrary, one of the distinctive virtues of strict liability is that it is capable—in the social world in which we live—of mitigating the effects of moral luck. In law, “moral luck”—is in part an artifice of institutional design. And under conditions common in the modern world, strict liability does not exacerbate the effects of moral luck, it mitigates those effects. The standard criticism of strict liability has it exactly backward. This criticism asserts that strict liability is suspect because of the great burden that it places on our freedom: We may find ourselves liable for devastating injury no matter how carefully we proceed, no matter how irreproachably we conduct ourselves. Strict liability is a sword of Damocles dangling over all of our actions. When the subject under consideration is strict enterprise liability in the law of torts—and when that subject is under consideration in a characteristically modern social world—this criticism is wholly misplaced. In a world where the costs of accidents can be dispersed across the activities which engender them, strict liability protects our freedom of action by substituting certain but manageable insurance premiums for unpredictable but potentially catastrophic losses. By subjecting us to a lottery some of whose spins of the wheel impose financial ruin, it is fault liability that puts our actions at the mercy of luck. Tort law may have something to tell us about the sources of moral luck. Thomas Nagel famously mused that the problem of moral luck may arise out of our ability to adopt both objective and subjective perspectives towards ourselves—to see ourselves both as objects within the natural world, governed by causal laws and as actors who cannot help but conceive of ourselves as free. In tort law, the phenomenon appears to arise more proximately from another source: The clash of individual conceptions of fault with the reality of systemic social risk. What is luck to the parties involved, is statistically inevitable harm to the activity within which the accident arises. “Moral luck” is not “luck” at all but the upshot of a mismatch of social reality and institutional form. Moral luck is in part the offspring of human institutions and it may in part be mitigated by their redesign...|$|E

40|$|This {{analysis}} of the American Law Institute 2 ̆ 7 s Principles of Family Law, Chapter 3, examines how the Principles perceive the origins and <b>extent</b> <b>of</b> parental <b>obligation.</b> What is that makes someone financially responsible for a child? Perhaps surprisingly, the Drafters of this key chapter of the Principles spend remarkably little time analyzing that question. Instead, to determine who has parental obligation, the Principles rely on extant legal paternity and parenthood doctrine that is itself completely muddled. To determine the <b>extent</b> <b>of</b> parental <b>obligation,</b> the Principles employ a binary biological ideal of parenthood that fails to reflect reality for close to half {{of the children in}} this country. What is most striking about this traditional approach to parental obligation is how much it contrasts with the Principles 2 ̆ 7 approach to parental rights in Chapter 2. Chapter 2 does a great deal of ambitious work laying out a new framework for who should enjoy parental rights and why. In doing so, it greatly expands the pool of people who may be entitled to parental rights and it makes clear that more than two people can be parents to one child. Chapter 3 does almost nothing to expand the pool of people who may be responsible for a child and it specifically discourages the notion that more than two people can parent one child. Thus, it is clear that adults may enjoy parental rights without shouldering any parental responsibility. Regardless of what one thinks of the wisdom of either chapter 2 or 3, their contrasting treatment of parental rights and obligation demands further analysis...|$|R

The duty to provide a safe work place relates to the employer’s responsibilities imposed by the common law to ensure that the work place is reasonably safe, while the employer’s duty to provide a safe work system relates to the responsibility to ensure that the actual mode of conducting work is safe. The South African legislation provides for various rights and duties for both employers and employees. In substance, these Acts restate the common law position in obliging employers to take all reasonable and practicable measures to ensure a safe and healthy work environment. Over and above the general duty, specific measures to be taken by the employers are set out in the regulations to the Acts.

40|$|In {{this article}} I {{investigate}} {{the nature and}} <b>extent</b> <b>of</b> filial <b>obligations.</b> The question what (adult) children owe their parents is not only philosophically interesting, but also of increasing relevance in ageing societies. Its answer matters to elderly people and their adult children, and is relevant to social policy issues in various ways. I present the strongest arguments for and against three models of filial obligations: the 'past parental sacrifices' model, the 'special relationship' model, and the conventionalist model. There {{is something to be}} said-and after consideration of objections something remains to be said-for all three models. In other words: filial obligations have more than one source, and an adequate model <b>of</b> filial <b>obligations</b> should reflect this. On its own, each of the above models is one-sided. They also fail to show the connections between the question <b>of</b> filial <b>obligations</b> and various other issues, such as issues of gender justice, the <b>extent</b> <b>of</b> institutionalization of eldercare, and social conventions regarding filial responsibility. Therefore, I integrate what I think we should keep from the aforementioned models into a contextual, pluralist model, which places filial obligations in a broader social and cultural context and relates them to issues of social justice. The model also highlights the difference between general and specific filial obligations, and the factors that determine their nature and extent, thus enabling a deeper and more comprehensive understanding <b>of</b> filial <b>obligations.</b> © 2012 The Author(s) ...|$|R

The state—as the embodiment of our collective will— has made basic education compulsory, while also acting as the major financial facilitator.

And, inherently, to indicate the <b>extent</b> <b>of</b> <b>obligation</b> imposed by the state concerning content, and how much freedom concerning content and pedagogy is left to the school, the parents, and/or the pupils. In a democratic country, such statements made by the government should be broadly supported by society; and therefore also by the social discourse about the curriculum. Four leading questions of curriculum development are being distinguished: 1 To what purpose should they learn? (curriculum rationale) 2 What should they learn? (objectives & content) 3 How do they learn this? (didactics & organisation) 4 Have they actually learned it? (assessment & conclusion) Very generally put, we can claim that: ∙ the state is the leading authority in the question ‘To what purpose should they learn?’ ∙ teachers and subject professionals are the leading authorities in the question ‘What should they learn?’ ∙ schools and teachers are leading in the question: ‘How do they learn this?’ ∙ when answering the question ‘Have they actually learned it?’, there is a social answer just as well as a professional answer; thus if we are to determine afterwards whether education has achieved its objectives—in the sense of learning effects in pupils—we must not only determine whether the objectives‐as‐operationalised have been achieved by education, but also whether the results achieved agree with the objectives‐as‐envisaged during the social discourse...|$|R
