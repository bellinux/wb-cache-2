The primary schools are formally known in Malay today as Sekolah Kebangsaan St. John (1) and Sekolah Kebangsaan St. John (2) while the secondary school was called Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan St. John, but it was announced in April 2016 that the name would be reverted to St John's Institution, a decision widely applauded by alumni and backed by another Johannian Sultan Nazrin Shah of Perak.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT This study {{aimed at}} {{identifying}} {{some of the}} problems militating against effective management of primary schools in Afikpo South local government area in Ebonyi State of Nigeria. A self-administered questionnaire containing eight research questions with twenty-four (24) questionnaire items was utilised for this study. The study found, among others that, high numbers of enrolment put pressure on meagre school facilities, while heads of schools, teachers and pupils are affected by a general lack of facilities. This is exemplified by some schools where classes took place outside the normal classrooms and in some cases, outside the school compound. The authors insist that provision of adequate and qualified teachers must be a conscious programme of both government and heads of schools because the successful administration of primary schools is possible with qualified and dedicated teachers, well equipped primary schools, expansion of schools to accommodate the increasing <b>enrolment</b> <b>of</b> <b>pupils</b> and a co-operative community incorporating parents of pupils...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. A.) - University of KwaZulu-Natal, 2004. This is a {{case study}} that {{investigated}} the Pitseng Primary School stakeholders' understanding of the purpose and objectives of Free Primary Education (FPE), the strategies that they have developed and adopted {{for the implementation of}} this programme, the challenges they encountered in their efforts to implement FPE, and how they addressed these challenges. Pitseng Primary School is located in the Leribe district in Lesotho. The study used the questionnaires which were administered to teachers and the governing body of Pitseng Primary School. Group interviews were conducted with 8 teachers and 3 members of the governing body. Individual interviews were conducted with 10 parents and the researcher used observations to collect and verify the data. This study was informed by critical, pragmatic and positivistic approaches to policy implementation. The findings of this study have revealed that the Pitseng Primary School's stakeholders understand the purpose of FPE as a vehicle to make all Basotho children get basic education, provide jobs for the needy Basotho people, eliminate hunger and malnutrition among the Basotho children, and reduce teenage and juvenile crime. The study has also found that there are no formally developed and adopted strategies for FPE implementation at Pisteng Primary. The government determines all the strategies, and the actions that various stakeholders take at the school/community level are an ad hoc response to the pressing demands of FPE implementation. Lack of resources, massive <b>enrolment</b> <b>of</b> <b>pupils,</b> lack of co-operation among stakeholders, and HIV/AIDS are some of the challenges that impede the effective implementation of FPE at Pitseng Primary School. The information that the government relayed to parents lacked insight of the practical implications for FPE implementation at Pitseng Primary and this has created a conflict between various stakeholders at the school regarding the implementation of this programme. To facilitate the school's efforts towards effective implementation of FPE and resource mobilisation, the study recommended that the stakeholders at Pitseng Primary School should hold regular meetings wherein they clarify the role and responsibilities that all parties have to play for the implementation of FPE. The government of Lesotho should give the school autonomy to develop appropriate strategies for the implementation of this programme...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} educational stratification in Nigeria {{to determine how}} socioeconomic status, gender, and regional differences influence achievement in education using the nationally representative 2010 Nigeria Education Data Survey (NEDS). These cross-sectional data are among the first quality household survey data available for assessing aspects of education in Nigeria. In the last four decades, Nigeria has experienced dramatic expansion of its educational system. Following the introduction of educational policies and programs, growth in enrolment at the primary and secondary levels has largely been sustained. For instance, <b>enrolment</b> <b>of</b> <b>pupils</b> in primary education increased from 3, 515, 827 in 1970 to 14, 383, 487 in 1985 and to 20, 080, 986 in 2010. However, this impressive gain was followed by dwindling quality in the educational system, which has reported differing educational outcomes for different groups. Prior research in Nigeria has not examined how socioeconomic status influences achievement in education using large scale representative data. In this study, I primarily focused on assessing socioeconomic status to determine how it predicts achievement in reading and numeracy in Nigerian school children, ages 5 to 16 years. Nigeria is also known to have wide gender and regional gaps in education. Thus, I assessed gender and region variables {{to determine how much}} they contribute to the variance in educational achievement. I analyzed NEDS 2010 data and reported the findings of the descriptive and multivariate regression statistics. Descriptive statistics show the frequencies and distribution of the variables in the study. The multivariate regression analyses were employed to determine the relationship of socioeconomic status, gender, and region (the main predictor variables) with achievement in reading and numeracy (outcome variables). Given the use of survey data, both the descriptive and regression statistics were based on weighted statistics. This study found a significant wealth gap in reading and numeracy achievements among Nigerian children. I also found that family wealth, parental education, and region explain differences in academic achievement. Family wealth was found {{to be the most important}} variable influencing achievement in reading and numeracy, followed by mother 2 Ì† 7 s education and then region. Overall, the findings in this study suggest no significant differences in reading and numeracy achievement for boys and girls. Although gender was not found to be consistently associated with academic achievement in this study, it should not be assumed to mean that gender equality in education exists in Nigeria. It is widely reported elsewhere that gender-biased educational opportunity plays a major role in influencing educational attainment and achievement. More research, preferably using a longitudinal study design, is needed to identify the trends and patterns of gender roles in Nigerian educational attainment and achievement. The findings in this study provide the foundation for making further investigations on the association of social, economic, and cultural factors with academic achievement and to assess inequality in education in Nigeria...|$|E
