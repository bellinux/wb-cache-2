2500|$|Having also {{presented}} himself in {{elections for the}} Bucharest Communal Council, Fleva became one of three assistants to Mayor C. A. Rosetti, whose mandate coincided with {{the first year of}} Romania's war. Also then, Fleva, Carada, Stătescu and other members of Rosetti's faction were elected officers of the [...] "Citizens' Guard", a paramilitary organization. Their activity there was reported with alarm by the conservative gazette Timpul: [...] "The city's Guard , following its earlier establishment as an armed force with commanders elected from within its own ranks, all of them improvised officers wearing [...] insignia designed during times of revolution, officers with no military skill, no discipline and no title , not only <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>not</b> represent any sort of guaranteed safety, but, what is more, could always turn itself into a dangerous element of social upheaval." ...|$|E
2500|$|... {{the large}} {{majority}} of French jihadists are second-generation Muslims who, unlike their parents, speak French, grew up with little to no contact with mosques or Muslim organizations, and before their conversions drank, took drugs, and had girlfriends. They are estranged from their parents and don't know where to fit in. Or they are recent converts, largely from rural areas and many from divorced families. Why is that, Roy asks? If Islam or social conditions are essentially to blame for breeding terrorism, why do such structural problems affect only this very narrowly defined group? Why <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>not</b> attract first- or third-generation French Muslims, or those whose Islamic culture is the deepest? And why does its appeal extend to children of the successful middle class? His answer: jihadism is a nihilistic generational revolt, not a religiously inspired utopianism.|$|E
2500|$|Rabbi Ishmael cited [...] {{as one of}} ten a fortiori (kal va-chomer) {{arguments}} {{recorded in}} the Hebrew Bible: (1) In [...] Joseph's brothers told Joseph, [...] "Behold, {{the money that we}} found in our sacks' mouths we brought back to you," [...] and they thus reasoned, [...] "how then should we steal?" [...] (2) In [...] Moses told God, [...] "Behold, the children of Israel have not hearkened to me," [...] and reasoned that surely all the more, [...] "How then shall Pharaoh hear me?" [...] (3) In [...] Moses said to the Israelites, [...] "Behold, while I am yet alive with you this day, you have been rebellious against the Lord," [...] and reasoned that it would follow, [...] "And how much more after my death?" [...] (4) In [...] "the Lord said to Moses: ‘If her (Miriam's) father had but spit in her face,'" [...] surely it would stand to reason, [...] "‘Should she not hide in shame seven days?'" [...] (5) In [...] the prophet asked, [...] "If you have run with the footmen, and they have wearied you," [...] is it not logical to conclude, [...] "Then how can you contend with horses?" [...] (6) In 1 Samuel [...] David's men said to him, [...] "Behold, we are afraid here in Judah," [...] and thus surely it stands to reason, [...] "How much more then if we go to Keilah?" [...] (7) Also in [...] the prophet asked, [...] "And if in a land of Peace where you are secure" [...] you are overcome, is it not logical to ask, [...] "How will you do in the thickets of the Jordan?" [...] (8) [...] reasoned, [...] "Behold, the righteous shall be requited in the earth," [...] and <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>not</b> follow, [...] "How much more the wicked and the sinner?" [...] (9) In [...] "The king said to Esther the queen: ‘The Jews have slain and destroyed 500 men in Shushan the castle,'" [...] and it thus stands to reason, [...] "‘What then have they done {{in the rest of the}} king's provinces?'" [...] (10) In [...] God came to the prophet saying, [...] "Behold, when it was whole, it was usable for no work," [...] and thus surely it is logical to argue, [...] "How much less, when the fire has devoured it, and it is singed?" ...|$|E

2500|$|The I Am... World Tour {{received}} {{rave reviews}} from critics. Mike Ross of the website Jam! gave Knowles' [...] "spectacular" [...] performance 4.5 out of 5 stars stating that she proved she could sing traditional R {{if she wanted}} with the cover of Etta James' [...] "At Last". He further noted that the show had [...] "high-production bells... {{a wide range of}} musical styles... a remarkable vocal range, and of course the riveting presence of the star herself." [...] Stephanie Classen of The Star Phoenix remarked, [...] "Beyoncé doesn't really need the bells and whistles of a big stadium show, but it sure makes for an unforgettable concert." [...] Additional praise was received from Randall King of the Winnipeg Free Press who graded her [...] "lavishly produced" [...] performance 4 stars out of 5, saying, [...] "In Sasha-mode... Knowles is raw energy convincingly expressing a live hard/work hard ethos with every shimmy and nimble vocal trill... But Beyoncé... showed feeling ... with more ballad-y numbers" [...] further noting that her split-personality [...] "bounces back and forth" [...] throughout the show. Alice Jones of The Independent noted that whether Knowles performed power balladry, dancehall or electro songs, [...] "she sings her heart out" [...] and further praised the [...] "astonishingly high-energy show, the ambitious choreography barely grazing her perfect, lung-busting vocals which run from caramel smooth to honeyed foghorn". She concluded her review by saying, [...] "Watching Beyoncé sing and strut her stuff can feel at best overawing, at worst, alienating. She takes her role as entertainer so seriously she's almost too good." [...] Ben Ratliff of The New York Times writes, [...] "there is a breathtaking elegance in her acute desire to entertain" [...] further saying that [...] "the whole point of the dazzling show was to make you ask how she <b>does</b> <b>it.</b> <b>Not</b> just physically, but organizationally." [...] Ratliff also praised Knowles' [...] "hollering voice, her imperious movement, her costume changes and the show's crush of concepts with their long tails of reference." [...] Deborah Mcaleese and Lauren Mulvenny of The Belfast Telegraph described the show as [...] "incredible... mind blowing... electrifying". [...] A writer of Evening Chronicle wrote that Knowles proved she was the best entertainer [...] "with a two-hour set packed with bling, glamour and, most importantly, enthusiasm", further praising her for singing the songs live [...] "hit every note" [...] while dancing to her choreography. The writer further chose the performances of [...] "Ave Maria", [...] "At Last" [...] and [...] "Listen" [...] as highlights during the show describing Knowles' vocals as [...] "incredible". Similarly, Jay Hanna of The Sunday Times chose the same songs as highlights during the show, further saying that [...] "Halo" [...] was the most memorable moment of the night. She also praised Knowles' [...] "enviable" [...] dancing skills, compared her with Dionne Warwick but noted that, [...] "Her brilliant performance, which was only let down by weaker, less melodic songs such as Get Me Bodied or Upgrade U, was matched by spectacular production and audio visuals." [...] Jay Lustig of The Star-Ledger also wrote that [...] "At Last" [...] and [...] "Listen" [...] were as [...] "riveting as anything that had come before", further choosing the performances of [...] "You Oughta Know" [...] and [...] "Halo" [...] as other highlights. Lustig described the show as a [...] "bona fide pop spectacle" [...] noting that many of the songs which were performed had futuristic themes. Jim Farber from the Daily News viewed the tour as [...] "a huge upgrade in charm, humor and chops" [...] and added that [...] "Beyoncé's presence punctuated her singing like an exclamation point".|$|E
