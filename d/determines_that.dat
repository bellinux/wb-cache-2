5|$|A more narrow bail-in process {{pertaining}} to federal observer certification is prescribed in Section 3(a). Under this provision, {{a federal court}} may certify a non-covered jurisdiction to receive federal observers if the court <b>determines</b> <b>that</b> the jurisdiction violated the voting rights guaranteed by the Fourteenth or Fifteenth Amendments. Jurisdictions certified to receive federal observers under Section 3(a) {{are not subject to}} preclearance.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, Congress {{required}} jurisdictions seeking bailout {{to produce}} evidence of minority registration and voting rates, including how these rates have changed over time and {{in comparison to the}} registration and voting rates of the majority. If the court <b>determines</b> <b>that</b> the covered jurisdiction is eligible for bailout, it will enter a declaratory judgment in the jurisdiction's favor. The court will retain jurisdiction for the following 10 years and may order the jurisdiction back into coverage if the jurisdiction subsequently engages in voting discrimination.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn this research, by {{analysing}} {{the content of}} critical thinking studies, it was <b>determined</b> <b>that</b> in which direction the studies in this area have been progressed. The study is a documentary survey study. The {{study was limited to}} 141 articles which were analyzed after surveying the data base of EBSCO, Science Direct, Tyler -Francis and Ulakbim.

5|$|Structural {{coloration}} {{was first}} observed by English scientists Robert Hooke and Isaac Newton, and its principle – wave interference – explained by Thomas Young a century later. Young described iridescence {{as the result}} of interference between reflections from two or more surfaces of thin films, combined with refraction as light enters and leaves such films. The geometry then <b>determines</b> <b>that</b> at certain angles, the light reflected from both surfaces interferes constructively, while at other angles, the light interferes destructively. Different colours therefore appear at different angles.|$|E

5|$|En route, the {{presence}} of the Orions begins having an effect on the crew: men become increasingly aggressive, while women increasingly suffer from headaches. Navaar focuses her attentions on Archer, while D'Nesh seduces Commander Kelby. Arriving at the planet, a sluggish Archer orders Reed to destroy another ship, but he refuses and it escapes. Kelby meanwhile sabotages the warp drive before Commander Tucker can physically stop him. Afterwards, Doctor Phlox <b>determines</b> <b>that</b> the Orions are producing pheromones, causing the crew's adrenaline levels to spike. Only Commander T'Pol and Tucker remain unaffected, since she is Vulcan and he shares her immunity because of their psychic bond.|$|E
5|$|Sub-Commander T'Pol orders Enterprise to 'Sphere 41', in {{an attempt}} to destroy the entire sphere network.

Undeterred, Commander Tucker modifies the deflector dish {{so that it can be}} used to destroy the sphere. As they approach, two Guardians arrive and begin damaging the ship's systems, but they cannot prevent its destruction. It implodes, setting off a chain reaction that successfully destroys the rest of the spheres, ending all spatial anomalies in the region.|$|E
