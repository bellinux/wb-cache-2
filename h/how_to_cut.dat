5|$|While {{these reforms}} succeeded in forming an {{equilibrium}} {{between the old}} common law courts and the new courts, they were viewed with suspicion by the Common Pleas, who became highly reactionary to the changes the King's Bench attempted to introduce. While the King's Bench was more revolutionary, the Common Pleas became increasingly conservative in its attempts to avoid ceding cases. The disparity between the reformist King's Bench and conservative Common Pleas was exacerbated {{by the fact that}} the three Common Pleas prothonotaries could not agree on <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> costs, leaving the court both expensive and of limited malleability while the King's Bench became faster, cheaper and more varied in its jurisdiction.|$|E
5|$|During the 15th century, {{the common}} law courts were {{challenged}} by the civil law and equity found in the Chancery and similar courts. These courts and legal methods were much faster than {{the common law}} courts, so lawyers and claimants flocked to them. This was perceived {{as a threat to}} the common law courts, for good reason; between 1460 and 1540, the business of the common law courts significantly dropped, while the Chancery's cases rose massively in number. In reaction to this, the Court of King's Bench developed its own, faster system, intent on winning cases back, and through procedures such as the Writ of Quominus and Bill of Middlesex acquired a wider jurisdiction. While this succeeded in forming an equilibrium between the old common law courts and the new courts, it was viewed with suspicion by the Common Pleas, who became highly reactionary to the changes the King's Bench attempted to introduce. When the King's Bench attempted to use the Bill of Middlesex to widen its jurisdiction, the Common Pleas became increasingly conservative in its attempts to avoid ceding cases. This was limited by the fact that the three Common Pleas prothonotaries could not agree on <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> costs, leaving the court both expensive and of limited malleability while the King's Bench became faster, cheaper and more varied in its jurisdiction.|$|E

25|$|Hunting {{often had}} {{elaborate}} preparations, such as fasting and religious rituals performed by medicine men {{before and after}} the hunt. In Lipan culture, since deer were protected by Mountain Spirits, great care was taken in Mountain Spirit rituals in order to ensure smooth deer hunting. Also the slaughter of animals must be performed following certain religious guidelines (many of which are recorded in religious stories) from prescribing <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> the animals, what prayers to recite, and proper disposal of bones. A common practice among Southern Athabascan hunters was the distribution of successfully slaughtered game. For example, among the Mescalero a hunter was expected to share as much as one half of his kill with a fellow hunter and with needy people back at the camp. Feelings of individuals concerning this practice spoke of social obligation and spontaneous generosity.|$|E

2500|$|Cunningham {{became a}} short-list {{candidate}} for the cabinet of Governor Ed Rendell. Initial discussions centered around the secretary position for the Department of Community and Economic Development. In December 2002, Cunningham cut short his trip to a National League of Cities conference in Salt Lake City to fly to Philadelphia and discuss the post with Rendell. Cunningham and Rendell had previously met through the Pennsylvania League of Cities and Municipalities, {{near the end of}} Rendell's tenure as mayor of Philadelphia, and they had been friends since. Rendell said economic development of the state's urban core was one of the top issues of his administration, and that he had [...] "tremendous respect" [...] for Cunningham and his accomplishments in Bethlehem. Likewise, Cunningham said he had modeled his administration's economic development plan for Bethlehem in part after the prototype Rendell used as mayor of Philadelphia. In January 2003, it was announced Rendell had tapped Cunningham for a secretary position, but with the Department of General Services, not the Department of Community and Economic Development. Although Cunningham was a candidate for both posts, Rendell said his track record of success in Bethlehem despite the loss of Bethlehem Steel would serve him well in maintaining the state's costs. Rendell also said Cunningham would be in the forefront of an effort to contain spending in the state government, which was facing a $2 billion budget deficit. Rendell said of Cunningham: [...] "You might be looking at the only two people in Pennsylvania who know <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> costs." ...|$|E
2500|$|Austin was {{contacted}} by Paul Heyman of Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW), who had managed him in WCW. Heyman hired Austin to do in-ring interviews, as {{he still had}} not recovered from his injury enough to wrestle. While in ECW, Austin used the platform to develop his future [...] "Stone Cold" [...] persona, {{as well as a}} series of vignettes running down WCW in general and Bischoff in particular, most memorably in several promos that mocked his then-status as Nitro host by introducing Monday NyQuil, where he was joined by [...] "Bongo" [...] (a set of drums, meant to represent Steve [...] "Mongo" [...] McMichael) in promoting the show [...] "where the big boys play with each other". Also, several wrestlers credited ECW as the place where Austin developed his microphone skills. Austin has credited Heyman as the man who taught him <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> a promo. While with ECW, Austin was known as [...] "Superstar" [...] Steve Austin. He had a match with The Sandman and feuded with Mikey Whipwreck. Whipwreck, who was the ECW World Heavyweight Champion at the time, defeated Austin at November to Remember. During this time, Austin learnt Whipwreck's finishing move, the Whipper-Snapper and would adopt it and popularize it in his later career as the Stunner. The Sandman defeated Austin and Whipwreck in a triple threat match at December to Dismember in 1995 for the ECW World Heavyweight Championship. Heyman would later state that he had wanted Austin to win the title, but Austin had refused because he felt he was more effective [...] "as the hunter, rather than the hunted".|$|E
