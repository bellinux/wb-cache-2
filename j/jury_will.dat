25|$|Each jury {{member of}} each {{national}} <b>jury</b> <b>will</b> make a ranking of his ten favourite songs and award points from 1 to 8, 10 and 12 points. The chairperson will allocate 12 {{points to the}} song having obtained {{the highest number of}} votes from all jury members, 10 points to the song having obtained the second highest number of votes, 8 points to the song having obtained the third highest number of votes, 7 points to the next, and so on down to 1 point for the song having obtained the tenth highest number of votes from all jury members. In the event of a tie for any of the above positions, the order of the tying songs shall be ascertained by a show of hands by the jury members (abstentions are not allowed).|$|E
500|$|Given {{her great}} {{experience}} in whoring, Lady Castlemaine would, they argued, {{be able to}} sympathise deeply with prostitutes across the city. [...] "Should your Eminency but once fall into these Rough hands", they wrote, [...] "you may expect no more Favour than they have shewn unto us poor Inferiour Whores". Diarist Samuel Pepys noted that Castlemaine was [...] "horribly vexed" [...] by the petition. The letter itself was so finely tuned to the political dynamics {{of the day that}} though the printer was arrested, the court censor writes that [...] "I can fasten nothing on The Poor Whore's Petition that a <b>jury</b> <b>will</b> take notice of." ...|$|E
2500|$|As {{the trial}} progressed, {{it became clear}} that {{convictions}} were unlikely. The New York Times reported that [...] "Evidence in the trial is extremely perplexing and suggests wholesale perjury on both sides. What the result ought to be nobody has the slightest idea, but it is taken for granted that a French <b>jury</b> <b>will</b> not punish French citizens, and that Italy will be supplied with a large and valuable grievance." ...|$|E

2500|$|Meanwhile, {{the coroner}} said: [...] "This case has {{attracted}} such attention that a minute examination will be made. We will {{be content with}} no perfunctory inquest such as this. The <b>jury</b> <b>will</b> refuse to state its convictions -- for it has none -- until after the autopsy has been held. We want the stomach {{of the little girl}} examined, and the lungs as well. The father charges murder. It is certainly possible that he is right." ...|$|E
2500|$|PBS {{decided on}} a new format for its {{national}} selection for the Eurovision Song Contest 2009. Maltese songwriters {{would be allowed to}} submit up to two songs per singer, though only one singer will be allowed on stage. Submissions were accepted on from 13 October to 14 October 2008 at the PBS offices in G’Mangia. From 23 October to 26 October and 1 November to 2 November, 80 songs were chosen internally for the second phase. In the second phase, the 80 songs would be presented in ten weekly televised shows, titled [...] "Euro Showbox" [...] to be held on 8, 15, 29 November, 6, 13, 20 December and 10 January 2009. A <b>jury</b> <b>will</b> choose 15 entries {{to move on to the}} national final, while another five entries will be given a wildcard through televoting. The national final on 7 February will contain 20 songs and a <b>jury</b> <b>will</b> choose three of them to go on to the [...] "super-final", where televoting will determine the winner. The votes given by the juries in the previous round, however, will be kept and tallied along with the televotes. The eventual winner will represent Malta in Moscow. 182 songs were received by PBS, 43 less than last year.|$|E
2500|$|There is no set {{format for}} jury deliberations, {{and the jury}} takes {{a period of time}} to settle into {{discussing}} the evidence and deciding on guilt and any other facts the judge instructs them to determine. [...] Deliberation is done by the jury only, with none of the lawyers, the judge, or the defendant present. [...] The first step will typically be to find out the initial feeling or reaction of the jurors to the case, which may be by a show of hands, or via secret ballot. The <b>jury</b> <b>will</b> then attempt to arrive at a consensus verdict. The discussion usually helps to identify jurors' views to see whether a consensus will emerge as well as areas that bear further discussion. [...] Points often arise that were not specifically discussed during the trial. [...] The result of these discussions is that in most cases the jury comes to a unanimous decision and a verdict is thus achieved. [...] In some states and under circumstances, the decision need not be unanimous.|$|E
50|$|Once all the {{prosecution}} {{evidence has been}} given, the jury may at any time, of its own motion, decide to acquit the defendant. Few <b>juries</b> <b>will</b> realise that they have this power unless advised by the judge. Such judicial intervention is deprecated by the Court of Appeal and, as of 2007, is rarely exercised.|$|R

The country pays just enough a day to make poor men like to be on juries, and they never fail to attend, while them that can pay their fines stay away, and so leave the law pretty much in the hands of one party. No rich man gains his cause, unless his case is so strong it can't be helped." ...|$|R
