5|$|The Paralympics has <b>grown</b> <b>from</b> a small {{gathering}} of British World War II veterans in 1948 {{to become one}} of the largest international sporting events by the early 21st century. The Paralympics has <b>grown</b> <b>from</b> 400 athletes with a disability from 23 countries in 1960 to thousands of competitors from over 100 countries in the London 2012 Games. Paralympians strive for equal treatment with non-disabled Olympic athletes, but there is a large funding gap between Olympic and Paralympic athletes.|$|E

Most of the funding for the diocese was {{provided}} by Russian Church, via the Imperial Missionary Society. The connections between the American diocese and the Russian Church would be severely compromised by the events of that year.|$|E

5|$|Home {{propagation}} is best {{performed by}} using offset bulbils. Commercially, only cultivars that produce {{at least three}} bulbils on the mother bulb are used for this form of propagation. Plants <b>grown</b> <b>from</b> this method take {{three to four years}} to bloom.|$|E
5|$|Key Biscayne {{was first}} {{developed}} for coconut cultivation. The earliest mention of coconuts on Key Biscayne is a Spanish account from 1568, although the reference {{may be to}} cocoplums rather than coconuts. Mature coconut trees were on Cape Florida by the 1830s, likely <b>grown</b> <b>from</b> coconuts sent from Mexico by Henry Perrine to the first lighthouse keeper, John Dubose.|$|E

5|$|Peanut, or {{groundnut}} (Arachis hypogaea), {{originally from}} South America, has <b>grown</b> <b>from</b> {{a relatively minor}} crop {{to one of the}} most important commercial nut crops, in part due to the work of George Washington Carver at the beginning of the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|Selenium {{deficiency}} {{is rare in}} otherwise healthy, well-nourished individuals. It {{can occur}} in patients with severely compromised intestinal function, those undergoing total parenteral nutrition, and in those of advanced age (over 90). Also, people dependent on food <b>grown</b> <b>from</b> selenium-deficient soil are at risk. Although New Zealand soil has low levels of selenium, adverse health effects have not been detected in the residents.|$|E
5|$|Single-parent {{homes in}} America are {{increasingly}} common. With more children being born to unmarried couples and to couples whose marriages subsequently dissolve, more children live {{with just one}} parent. The proportion of children living with a never-married parent has <b>grown,</b> <b>from</b> 4% in 1960 to 42% in 2001. Of all single-parent families, 83% are mother–child families.|$|E

5|$|A {{study of}} {{seedlings}} <b>grown</b> <b>from</b> seed collected in 28 areas showed a north-south change in leaf shape and dimensions. Seedling leaves get longer and narrower southwards. Seedlings often have leaves with red-brown pigmentation which disappears in older plants, and this coloration becomes increasingly common towards the south. The changes in shape—leaves getting narrower and more robust {{from north to}} south and from lowland to montane—suggest adaptations to colder weather.|$|E
5|$|Bottle trees grow best in well-drained, {{slightly}} acidic soil, in full sunshine. They are {{suited to}} cultivation in regional climates equivalent to USDA hardiness zones 9 to 12. In the first stages of growth, the bottle tree is very slow-growing, {{and the formation}} of the unique bottle shape is not visible until the tree is about 5 to 8 years old. Mature trees transplant easily, and can withstand intervals of up to three months between digging and replanting without detriment. Bottle trees <b>grown</b> <b>from</b> seed may take up to 20 years to flower. Flowering takes place after adult leaves have appeared.|$|E
5|$|By September 1943, Neddermeyer's {{team had}} <b>grown</b> <b>from</b> five people to fifty. That month, John von Neumann came to Los Alamos at Oppenheimer's request. Von Neumann was {{impressed}} by the implosion concept and, working with Edward Teller, an old friend, made a series of suggestions. Von Neumann was able to create a sound mathematical model of implosion, enabling Neddermeyer to present a proposal for a greatly expanded research program. Edwin McMillan and Isidor Isaac Rabi recommended that George Kistiakowsky, who had a specialized knowledge in the precision use of explosives, be brought in to help the program. In February 1944, Kistiakowsky became Parsons' deputy for implosion.|$|E

5|$|Canada's {{first such}} public transit system, GO Transit began regular {{passenger}} service on May 23, 1967 {{as a part}} of the Ontario Ministry of Transportation. Since then, it has <b>grown</b> <b>from</b> a single train line to seven, and expanded to include complementing bus service. GO Transit has been constituted in a variety of public-sector configurations, today existing as an operating division of Metrolinx, a provincial Crown agency with overall responsibility for integrative transportation planning within the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area.|$|E
5|$|Cordyline australis {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely {{cultivated}} New Zealand native trees. In Northwest Europe and other cool oceanic climates, it is very popular as an ornamental tree because it looks like a palm tree. Hardy forms from the coldest areas of the southern or inland South Island tolerate Northern Hemisphere conditions best, while North Island forms are much more tender. It is easily <b>grown</b> <b>from</b> fresh seed — seedlings often spontaneously appear in gardens from bird-dispersed seed — and can be grown very easily from shoot, stem and even trunk cuttings. It does well in pots and tubs.|$|E
5|$|From the {{formation}} of the Kingdom of Alba in the tenth century, to before the Black Death reached the country in 1349, estimates based on the amount of farmable land suggest that the population may have <b>grown</b> <b>from</b> half a million to a million. Growth was probably punctuated by occasional crises, like the famines recorded in chronicles for 1154 and 1256. More significant was a series of poor harvests that affected Scotland and most of Europe in the early fourteenth century and widespread famines in 1315–16 and in the later 1330s.|$|E
