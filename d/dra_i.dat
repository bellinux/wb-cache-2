Chromosome replication initiates in the daughter stalked cell but is repressed in the daughter swarmer cell until later in the cell cycle. To study cell-type-specific DNA initiation, chromosome replication was directly analyzed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. Analysis of <b>Dra</b> <b>I</b> restriction fragments of DNA taken at various times from synchronized cell cultures labeled with 2 '-deoxy[3 H]guanosine has allowed us to determine the origin of DNA replication, the rate and direction of fork movement, and the order of gene replication. The first labeled <b>Dra</b> <b>I</b> fragment to appear contains the site of replication initiation. Based on the correlation of the physical and genetic maps derived by Ely and Gerardot [Ely, B. & Gerardot, C. J. (1988) Gene 68, 323 - 333], the origin was localized to a 305 -kilobase fragment containing the rrnA gene. Furthermore, the sequential replication through unmapped <b>Dra</b> <b>I</b> fragments has enabled us to localize their positions on the genome. The order of appearance of labeled restriction fragments revealed that the chromosome replicates bidirectionally at a fork movement rate of 21 kilobases per minute...|$|E

A secondary triplex-forming site of 8 contiguous base pairs was observed on the pBT 1 plasmid when binding of the 16 base-long oligonucleotide was allowed to take place at high oligonucleotide concentrations. Replacement of a stretch of six cytosines in the 16 -mer oligomer by a stretch of six guanines increased binding to the primary sites and abolished binding to the secondary site under physiological conditions.

40|$|Abstract—With {{the advent}} of {{multicore}} processors the emphasis in computation is moving from sequential to parallel processing. Still, applications that require strong sequential performance do not achieve their highest performance/power when executing on current multicore systems. As the computational needs vary significantly across different applications and with time, {{there is a need}} to dynamically allocate appropriate computational resources on demand to suit the applications’ current needs, in order to minimize the energy consumption. The Energy per Instruction (EPI) could be further decreased by dynamically adapting the voltage and frequency to better fit the changing characteristics of the workload. Not only can a core be forced to a low power mode when its activity level is low, but the power saved by doing so could be opportunistically re-budgeted to other cores to boost the overall system throughput. To this end, we propose a holistic solution to energy efficiency improvement by seamlessly combining heterogeneity, Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA) and Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Adaptation (DVFA) capabilities to adapt the core resources to the changing demands of applications. Our results show that the proposed scheme provides an EPI reduction of about 17. 9 % when compared to the baseline hetero-geneous multicore, 14 % when compared to the baseline heterogeneous multicore with DVFA only and about 16. 5 % when compared to the baseline heterogeneous multicore with <b>DRA</b> only. <b>I...</b>|$|R
40|$|Màster Oficial en Construcció i Representació d'Identitats Culturals (CRIC), Dir. : <b>Dra.</b> Gemma López <b>i</b> <b>Dra.</b> Ana MoyaThis study {{analyzes}} {{the ways in}} which Jeanette Winterson's novels "Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit" and "Written on the Body" address the exploration of sexual desire and the self. Through the use of characters that have lesbian and [homo-bi] sexual identities, or an ambiguous gender identity (as in "Written on the Body"), Winterson deconstructs narrative conventions and shows how storytelling need not be subordinated to the constraints of the grand narratives. She advocates alternative ways of understanding the sexual, emotional, and intellectual self, and persuasively challenges the constructed binary patterns of patriarchal Western thought. To analyze how identity is constructed in Winterson's "Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit" and "Written on the Body", I provide a close reading of the novels and examine both works by drawing on several theoretical frameworks including Julia Kristeva's definition of identity in terms of a 'subject-in-process', which contends that the self is never finished and complete but always in the process of becoming. Reference is also made in this work to Catherine Belsey's poststructuralist theories on Desire which are largely based on her interpretation of the work of Lacan and Derrida. Consideration of Judith Butler's Queer Theory is included to examine {{the ways in which}} gender roles, lacking any biological basis, are socially constructed and thus artificial and essentialist categories. I also make use of Roland Barthes and Michel Foucault's theories which posit the notion of the reader as co-writer of the text every time a reading is effected. And finally, I borrow from Jean-François Lyotard's theoretical work "The Postmodern Condition: A Report on Knowledge" (1979) in which the author proclaims the collapse of the 'grand récits' and the emergence of 'pétit récits' or 'language games'. I conclude my analysis of these two novels by considering Winterson's bold attempt to challenge stereotypes and disrupt hegemonic discourses on gender identity. In her subversion of the conventional limits of narrative, Winterson rejects oppressive definitions of subject identity, and views the self as an unstable entity that relies on the power of stories to construct subjectivity...|$|R

40|$|Applying various {{restriction}} enzymes on {{a specially}} designed 1. 5 kb DNA fragment revealed that the inhibitory effects of PUVA treatment on restriction endonuclease activities are caused by recognition inhibition. In this study, Restriction enzymes which have a 5 '-TpA sequence at the cleaving site (on I, Xba I, Pme I, and <b>Dra</b> <b>I),</b> and non-cleaving site (Pac I) in recognition sites, or have two 5 '-TpA sequences at the recognition site and a non-specific sequence between recognition and cleaving site (EcN I) were inhibited by PUVA treatment. Most of the other restriction enzymes {{used in this study}} which do not have a 5 '-TpA sequence at their restriction site were not inhibited by P W A treatment, although a 5 '-TpA sequence is located adjacent (Sma I) or very close (BamH I, Sac I and Pst I) to the recognition and cleaving site for them...|$|E
40|$|An {{integrated}} map of {{the genome}} of the tubercle bacillus, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, was constructed by using a twin-pronged approach. Pulsed-field gel electrophoretic analysis enabled cleavage sites for Asn I and <b>Dra</b> <b>I</b> to be positioned on the 4. 4 -Mb circular chromosome, while, in parallel, clones from two cosmid libraries were ordered into contigs by means of fingerprinting and hybridization mapping. The resultant contig map was readily correlated with the physical {{map of the}} genome via the landmarked restriction sites. Over 165 genes and markers were localized on the integrated map, thus enabling comparisons with the leprosy bacillus, Mycobacterium leprae, to be undertaken. Mycobacterial genomes appear to have evolved as mosaic structures since extended segments with conserved gene order and organization are interspersed with different flanking regions. Repetitive sequences and insertion elements are highly abundant in M. tuberculosis, but the distribution of IS 6110 is apparently nonrandom...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Levels of prepatent Schistosoma haematobium {{infection}} were monitored in {{intermediate host}} snails (Bu-linus nasutus) collected from transmission sites in coastal Kenya, using a {{polymerase chain reaction}} (PCR) assay amplifying the <b>Dra</b> <b>I</b> repeated sequence of S. haematobium. The timing and number of prepatent and patent infections were determined for each site and, where the time of first appearance was clear, the minimal prepatent period {{was estimated to be}} five weeks. High, persistent, prepatency rates (range 28 – 54 %), indicated a significant degree of repeated area contamination with parasite ova. In contrast, rates of cercarial shedding proved locally variable, and were either low (range 0. 14 – 3. 4 %) or altogether absent, indicating that only a small proportion of infected snails reach the stage of cercarial shedding. Given the apparently strong focal effects of environmental conditions, implications of these new data are discussed regarding the estimation of local force of transmission and the design of control activities...|$|E

[...] 158 pagesThis {{next decade}} {{will be crucial}} to solve several environmental issues on our planet, especially those regarding the increase in green house gases (GHG), water shortage, and the depletion of fossil fuels. Carbon dioxide emissions and fossil fuel depletion issues are linked, due to the great amount of CO 2 emitted into the atmosphere from the industrial, transport and energy sector (Bates, 2008). To avoid the increase in GHG emissions and enlarging the energetic matrix in different countries, the government, policy stakeholders and research groups are developing projects and investing {{in the production of}} biofuels from terrestrial biomass feedstock, such as palm, corn, rapeseed, sunflowers, and sugarcane. […]During the elaboration of this Doctoral thesis, Claudia Fuentes Griinewald was granted the following scholarship: "Beca de Gestión Propia, 2007 - 26080080 " (CONICYT), Chile, and was awarded a scholarship from MICIN, Spain, for an intemational research exchange to apply to the European Doctor DegreePeer Reviewe...|$|R
40|$|This {{notes are}} meant as {{background}} for devising whether an {{acquisition of a}} target firm might lead the acquiring player in a position from which it can significantly foreclose the market to new entrants. In particular, the economic literature has shown that, whenever a firm attempts to launch a takeover bid over a target company in which it already has an ownership stake (a ‘toehold’), other potential bidders may suffer from a competitive disadvantage in contesting the takeover. This would shield the incumbent from the competitive pressure of potential entrants, and would yield {{a situation in which}} new entrants are discouraged from entering the market. As Bulow, Huang and Klemperer (1999) conclude, “a controlling minority shareholder may therefore be effectively immune to outside offers”. In what follows, I summarize the findings of the mainstream economic literature on the so-called ‘toehold problem’. Section 1 introduces the general issue of almost-common value auctions, in which slight asymmetries between the bidders determine a vicious circle, which ultimately results in the advantaged player always winning the auction (at a low price). Section 2 describes the specific case of toeholds, i. e. the case in which one bidder in an auction has an ownership stake in the property being sold. <b>I</b> <b>dra...</b>|$|R
