5|$|A {{panelled}} stone {{structure in}} the church, carved with processions of bearded and robed figures under arches, seems to reproduce details found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> Cerne, a work associated with Bishop Æthelwold of Lichfield (818–830). The panels, which may originally have been the outer part of a sarcophagus built to hold {{the remains of a}} high status person such as Saint Hardulph, are dated by their similarity to the illustrations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> Cerne to the first third of the ninth century. According to a medieval calendar of saints, the Benedictine monks at Breedon celebrated Hardulph's feast day on 21 August.|$|E

5|$|Another likely {{literary}} {{source is}} the plague narrative <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> Exodus, in which Egypt {{is covered by}} darkness for three days.

5|$|According to Pentecostal biblical interpretation, the Gospel of John 20:22 {{shows that}} the disciples of Jesus were already born again before the Holy Spirit fell at Pentecost.

5|$|Each of {{the three}} narthex entrances sits below a tympanum. These 3 tympana were {{designed}} and sculpted by John Angel. The tympanum above the main, west entrance depicts Jesus as described <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> Revelation, together with the four beasts and other relevant iconography. It resembles the tympanum of the Royal Portal of Chartres Cathedral. Beneath the figure of Christ is Princeton University's shield, illustrating the university's motto, Dei sub numine viget ("Under the power of God she flourishes"). The tympana above {{the north and south}} entrances depict the Annunciation and the Baptism of Christ, respectively.|$|E
5|$|For the Gospels, Sinaiticus is {{generally}} considered among scholars as the second most reliable witness of the text (after Vaticanus); in the Acts of the Apostles, its text is {{equal to that of}} Vaticanus; in the Epistles, Sinaiticus is the most reliable witness of the text. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> Revelation, however, its text is corrupted and is considered of poor quality, and inferior to the texts of Codex Alexandrinus, Papyrus 47, and even some minuscule manuscripts in this place (for example, Minuscule 2053, 2062).|$|E

5|$|Historically, {{migration}} {{has been}} recorded as much as 3,000 years ago by Ancient Greek authors including Homer and Aristotle, and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> Job, for species such as storks, turtle doves, and swallows. More recently, Johannes Leche began recording dates of arrivals of spring migrants in Finland in 1749, and scientific studies have used techniques including bird ringing and satellite tracking. Threats to migratory birds have grown with habitat destruction especially of stopover and wintering sites, as well as structures such as power lines and wind farms.|$|E
5|$|In 1027, the Persian naturalist, Ibn Sina (known as Avicenna in Europe), {{proposed}} {{an explanation of}} how the stoniness of fossils was caused <b>in</b> <b>The</b> <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> Healing.

Ibn Sina modified this into the theory of petrifying fluids (succus lapidificatus), which was elaborated on by Albert of Saxony in the 14th century and was accepted in some form by most naturalists by the 16th century.|$|E

Terahnee is a sister Age to D'ni and is populated by descendants of the same ancestors as the D'ni.|$|E
