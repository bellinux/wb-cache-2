25|$|In 1954, the Ministry of Aviation granted Eagle {{permission}} {{to operate a}} limited programme of {{a new type of}} low-fare service that combined air travel and overseas holiday accommodation at a cost substantially below the aggregate of each <b>individual</b> <b>component</b> if purchased separately. This new concept enabled the airline to circumvent regulatory restrictions that prevented private airlines from competing with their state-owned counterparts. It also helped increase fleet utilisation.|$|E
25|$|H97-04 is {{the largest}} of the {{fourteen}} bonebeds, at 150 m in width. If one assumes that H97-04's 150 m width is its longest linear dimension then it had an area of about 17,671 m2. Bonebeds other than H97-04 were less than 50 m wide. These <b>individual</b> <b>component</b> bonebeds tend to have areas of only a few hundred to a few thousand square feet and would have maximum areas of somewhat less than 2,000 square meters. The individual bonebeds at Hilda were generally smaller than those at Dinosaur Provincial Park.|$|E
25|$|Dalton's law {{states that}} the total {{pressure}} {{is the sum of}} the partial pressures of each <b>individual</b> <b>component</b> in the mixture. When a multi-component liquid is heated, the vapor pressure of each component will rise, thus causing the total vapor pressure to rise. When the total vapor pressure reaches the pressure surrounding the liquid, boiling occurs and liquid turns to gas throughout the bulk of the liquid. Note that a mixture with a given composition has one boiling point at a given pressure, when the components are mutually soluble. A mixture of constant composition does not have multiple boiling points.|$|E

25|$|Evaluation of {{numerous}} public health interventions has generally shown that improvement in each <b>individual</b> <b>component</b> ordinarily attributed to poverty (for example, sanitation, health education and underlying nutrition status) often have minimal impact on transmission. For example, {{one study found}} that the introduction of latrines into a resource-limited community only reduced the prevalence of hookworm infection by four percent. However, another study in Salvador, Brazil found that improved drainage and sewerage had a significant impact (p<0.0001) on the prevalence of hookworm infection but no impact at all on the intensity of hookworm infection. This seems to suggest that environmental control alone has a limited but incomplete effect on the transmission of hookworms. It is imperative, therefore, that more research is performed to understand the efficacy and sustainability of integrated programs that combine numerous preventive methods including education, sanitation, and treatment.|$|E

2500|$|In {{repeated}} {{measurements of}} the different fault breaks, the results remained consistent, leading {{to the belief that}} most of the slip had occurred during the mainshock. While lateral, transverse, and vertical motions were all observed, the largest <b>individual</b> <b>component</b> of movement was [...] of left lateral slip near the middle of the Sylmar segment. The largest cumulative amount of slip of [...] occurred along the Sylmar and Tujunga segments. The overall fault displacement was summarized by geologist Barclay Kamb and others as [...] "nearly equal amounts of north–south compression, vertical uplift (north side up), and left lateral slip and hence may be described as a thrusting of a northern block to the southwest over a southern block, along a fault surface dipping about 45° north." ...|$|E
