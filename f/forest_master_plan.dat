It lies between Myrtle Beach and Conway {{in an area}} planned by International Paper in the late 1990s. Regarded as the [...] "bedroom community" [...] of Myrtle Beach, the planned unit development will have 20,000 single and multi-family homesites when completed. Most of the development follows the Carolina <b>Forest</b> <b>Master</b> <b>Plan,</b> developed cooperatively between International Paper and the Horry County Government.|$|E
40|$|Community {{forestry}} {{offers the}} opportunity to both strengthen sustainable environmental management while building on community assets. However, these types of forest programs require both that the community is involved in {{various aspects of the}} decision-making process, and that the community benefits economically, recreationally, and/or educationally. McIntosh SEED, a grassroots nonprofit organization, purchased 1, 159 acres of land situated in the coastal flatwoods of Georgia, with the goal of designating it as the McIntosh SEED Community Forest. The primary objective of this project is the development of The McIntosh SEED Community <b>Forest</b> <b>Master</b> <b>Plan,</b> which plays a crucial role in achieving their vision for the forest. The plan consists of three parts; the first involves an analysis of the community’s interests in relation to the forest using a combination of focus groups, interviews, and surveys. The second part is multi-faceted and site-specific, including an environmental assessment and site plan. The third and final part is also multi-faceted and moves beyond the site itself, addressing community accessibility and key communication and funding strategies. The community access assessment included a service area and competitive landscape analysis. As a case study, this process is applicable to the development of future community forests. By following the methodologically rigorous steps used in this plan, future organizations can incorporate community feedback and ecological assessments to design the ideal community forest program for their unique environmental and social circumstances...|$|E

50|$|During {{the early}} 1990s MCE's focus shifted back to Forest Park. In 1992, MCE led a {{campaign}} against Proposition 1 which would have allowed {{for the expansion of}} Art Museum parking. The proposition failed and over 22 acre of the Forest Park were saved. During the late 1990s the Coalition closely followed the development of the <b>Forest</b> Park's <b>Master</b> <b>Plan</b> and objected to all instances which would cause environmental harm. Campaigns were launched to support ideas such as a free flowing river, restoration of wetlands and prairies, protection of native plant and animal species and the introduction of a savannah in Kennedy forest. These ideas, incorporated into the final, have now become reality.|$|R

Twenty-five percent of the fees collected are returned to Eagle County, Colorado, for roads and schools, in lieu of taxes. The federal government supports the objective of providing healthy recreation opportunities in quality natural outdoor environments. Millions of national and international users during all seasons of the year appreciate the opportunities provided by Vail Resorts and White River National Forest through the public and private partnership on federal lands.|$|R

Twenty existing <b>master</b> <b>plans</b> were analyzed to provide background information about typical content, format, and professionals involved with development of <b>master</b> <b>plans.</b> In addition, fifty surveys were conducted with Directors of botanical gardens and arboreta. Twenty questions were posed to the Directors to define the extent of <b>master</b> <b>plan</b> implementation (i. e. use) at the garden and to identify the factors that affect implementation. Log-likelihood ratio tests (G tests) were performed to evaluate the data. Eighty-eight percent of the institutions surveyed reported that they implement a <b>master</b> <b>plan</b> at the garden. Significant relationships were observed between use of the <b>master</b> <b>plan</b> and the following factors: hiring a landscape architecture firm; involvement of staff, Boards of Directors, and the community; and inclusion of key sections, graphics, and the institution's mission statement.

40|$|The {{proliferation}} of <b>master</b> <b>planned</b> estate development has generated considerable debate regarding the exclusive {{nature of these}} developments. <b>Master</b> <b>planned</b> estates appear to find considerable support from planners and governments, {{as well as the}} residents within these new estate areas. The research presented here analysed the constructions of exclusivity for a <b>master</b> <b>planned</b> estate (Glenmore Park) {{and the extent to which}} the constructed identity for Glenmore Park resulted in socio-spatial polarisation within western Sydney.
