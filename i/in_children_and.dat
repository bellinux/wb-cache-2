5|$|A rapid strep test may assist a {{clinician}} {{in deciding}} whether to prescribe an antibiotic to a person with pharyngitis, a common infection of the throat. Viral infections {{are responsible for the}} majority of pharyngitis, but a significant proportion (20% to 40% <b>in</b> <b>children</b> <b>and</b> 5% to 15% in adults) is caused by bacterial infection. The symptoms of viral and bacterial infection may be indistinguishable, but only bacterial pharyngitis can be effectively treated by antibiotics. Since the major cause of bacterial pharyngitis is GAS, the presence of this organism in a person's throat may be seen as a necessary condition for prescribing antibiotics. GAS pharyngitis is a self-limiting infection that will usually resolve within a week without medication. However, antibiotics may reduce the length and severity of the illness and reduce the risk of certain rare but serious complications.|$|E
5|$|A {{systematic}} review in 2012 found and analysed four randomized controlled trials of ketogenic diet <b>in</b> <b>children</b> <b>and</b> {{young people with}} epilepsy, as well as six prospective and five retrospective studies. The trials were done among {{children and young people}} for whom drugs failed to control their seizures, and only one of the trials compared a group assigned to ketogenic diet with a group not assigned to one. The other trials compared types of diets or ways of introducing them to make them more tolerable. Nearly 40% of the children and young people had half or fewer seizures with the diet compared with the group not assigned to the diet. Only about 10% were still on the diet after a few years. Adverse effects such as hunger and loss of energy in that trial were common, with about 30% experiencing constipation.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the high}} blood {{solubility}} of methoxyflurane is often undesirable, this property makes it useful in certain situations—it persists in the lipid compartment {{of the body}} for a long time, providing sedation and analgesia well into the postoperative period. There is substantial data to indicate that methoxyflurane is an effective analgesic and sedative agent at subanesthetic doses. Supervised self-administration of methoxyflurane <b>in</b> <b>children</b> <b>and</b> adults can briefly lead to deep sedation, {{and it has been}} used as a patient controlled analgesic for painful procedures in children in hospital emergency departments. During childbirth, administration of methoxyflurane produces significantly better analgesia, less psychomotor agitation, and only slightly more somnolence than trichloroethylene.|$|E
5|$|At least 41 systems {{measure the}} severity, or grade, of a mild head injury, {{and there is}} little {{agreement}} about which is best. In an effort to simplify, the 2nd International Conference on Concussion in Sport, meeting in Prague in 2004, decided that these systems should be abandoned in favor of a 'simple' or 'complex' classification. However, the 2008 meeting in Zurich abandoned the simple versus complex terminology, although the participants did agree to keep the concept that most (80–90%) concussions resolve in a short period (7–10 days), and although the recovery time frame may be longer <b>in</b> <b>children</b> <b>and</b> adolescents.|$|E

5|$|Chronic Chagas disease {{remains a}} major health problem in many Latin American countries, despite the {{effectiveness}} of hygienic and preventive measures, such as eliminating the transmitting insects. However, several landmarks have been achieved {{in the fight against}} it in Latin America, including a reduction by 72% of the incidence of human infection <b>in</b> <b>children</b> <b>and</b> young adults in the countries of the Southern Cone Initiative, and at least three countries (Uruguay, in 1997, and Chile, in 1999, and Brazil in 2006) have been certified free of vectorial and transfusional transmission. In Argentina, vectorial transmission has been interrupted in 13 of the 19 endemic provinces, and major progress toward this goal has also been made in both Paraguay and Bolivia.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{being the}} most {{commonly}} studied and diagnosed mental disorder <b>in</b> <b>children</b> <b>and</b> adolescents, the exact cause is unknown {{in the majority of}} cases. It affects about 5–7% of children when diagnosed via the DSM-IV criteria and 1–2% when diagnosed via the ICD-10 criteria. As of 2015 it is estimated to affect about 51.1 million people. Rates are similar between countries and depend mostly on how it is diagnosed. ADHD is diagnosed approximately three times more often in boys than in girls, although the disorder is often overlooked in girls due to their symptoms differing from those of boys. About 30–50% of people diagnosed in childhood continue to have symptoms into adulthood and between 2–5% of adults have the condition.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, Shashthi came to {{represent}} all goddesses and forces responsible for causing diseases <b>in</b> <b>children</b> <b>and</b> their mothers, {{who needed to}} be propitiated on the sixth day after childbirth to prevent these illnesses. Consequently, Shashthi came to personify the sixth day of a child's life. The sixth day of the lunar fortnight is itself called Shashti, a name derived from {{the name of the}} goddess. The Yajnavalkya Smriti, composed during Gupta rule between the 3rd and 5th centuries CE, describes the rites of Shashthi Puja in which Shashthi is worshipped on the sixth day after childbirth to ensure the protection of the newborn baby. According to one explanation for the worship of Shashthi on this day, folk belief associates this critical time in an infant's life with great susceptibility to diseases related to childbirth, such as puerperal fever and tetanus, and that worship of Shashthi is performed to help ward off these diseases.|$|E

5|$|Externalizing {{disorders}} (i.e., acting-out disorders) show {{a clearer}} link to delayed gratification, since they more directly involve deficits in impulse control. For example, {{attention deficit hyperactivity}} disorder (ADHD) and aggressive behavior are associated with difficulty delaying gratification <b>in</b> <b>children</b> <b>and</b> adolescents, as are substance abuse, gambling, and other addictive behaviors in adolescents and adults. In a 2010 study, teenagers and young adults with stronger abilities to delay gratification were less likely to drink alcohol, or to smoke cigarettes or cannabis. Interestingly, a 2011 study found that the contrast in delayed gratification between children with and without ADHD was no longer significant after statistically controlling for IQ (in other words, ADHD was not associated with delayed gratification above and beyond the influence of IQ). This may stem from the high correlation between intelligence and delayed gratification, and suggests that the tie between delayed gratification and ADHD could benefit from more investigation.|$|E
5|$|Heavy metals {{essential}} for {{life can be}} toxic if taken in excess; some have notably toxic forms. Vanadium pentoxide (V2O5) is carcinogenic in animals and, when inhaled, causes DNA damage. The purple permanganate ion MnO is a liver and kidney poison. Ingesting more than 0.5 grams of iron can induce cardiac collapse; such overdoses most commonly occur <b>in</b> <b>children</b> <b>and</b> may result in death within 24 hours. Nickel carbonyl (Ni2(CO)4), at 30 parts per million, can cause respiratory failure, brain damage and death. Imbibing a gram or more of copper sulfate (Cu(SO4)2) can be fatal; survivors may be left with major organ damage. More than five milligrams of selenium is highly toxic; this is roughly ten times the 0.45 milligram recommended maximum daily intake; long-term poisoning can have paralytic effects.|$|E
5|$|In 15–20 {{percent of}} cases of {{spontaneous}} SAH, no aneurysm is detected on the first angiogram. About half of these are attributed to non-aneurysmal perimesencephalic hemorrhage, in which the blood {{is limited to the}} subarachnoid spaces around the midbrain (i.e. mesencephalon). In these, the origin of the blood is uncertain. The remainder are due to other disorders affecting the blood vessels (such as cerebral arteriovenous malformations), disorders of the blood vessels in the spinal cord, and bleeding into various tumors. Cocaine abuse and sickle cell anemia (usually <b>in</b> <b>children)</b> <b>and,</b> rarely, anticoagulant therapy, problems with blood clotting and pituitary apoplexy can also result in SAH. Dissection of the vertebral artery, usually caused by trauma, can lead to subarachnoid hemorrhage if the dissection involves the part of the vessel inside the skull.|$|E
