25|$|For {{the general}} growth of cricket in the United States, {{it was most}} unfortunate that this {{pioneering}} tour occurred only 18 months before the American Civil War began. If the war had not broken out, it is highly likely that two or three follow-up tours might have been arranged in the early 1860s, thus building on the interest created by the initial trip. As it was, the enthusiasm for cricket faded in the war years and the troops on both sides adopted the embryonic game of baseball. When English teams resumed tours to America in 1868, not only <b>did</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> try to rekindle the enthusiasm, but in baseball they had a serious rival to contend with.|$|E

2500|$|In 1964 the Air Force {{issued a}} {{contract}} to TRW to consider the problem of ICBM survivability under the name [...] "Golden Arrow", {{looking for ways to}} make their own missiles as invulnerable as the Navy's. Ideally, the US ICBM fleet should be able to ride out an attack and then launch a response, which would require as many as 1,000 warheads, one for each Soviet ICBM silo. Not only <b>did</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> survive, but they had {{to have the ability to}} be quickly retargeted so the surviving US missiles could be aimed only at the remaining Soviet missiles, not empty silos.|$|E
2500|$|The {{external}} {{diameter of the}} globe itself was [...] The frame was formed by 32 large wooden trusses which were in turn supported by a brick enclosure rendered externally in cement. Between the trusses were smaller horizontal ribs from which zinc bands supported plaster casts {{of the features of}} the earth created from clay originals. There were about 6,000 of these plaster casts, each about [...] square and [...] thick. These castings had proved particularly problematic– not only <b>did</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> butt together perfectly but they also had to have a tiny curvature to fit to the concave interior of the shell– Wyld had needed three attempts to perfect the design. The production procedure was also time-consuming: the appropriate scale section of the Earth's surface would first be traced out on paper, then transferred to clay modelled with the appropriate topography, from which a mould would be taken; the mould was then tried and any corrections made before a final cast was produced and passed to the painters for decoration.|$|E

60|$|The boys {{fell into}} their {{places at the}} academy with a naturalness that was {{surprising}} when one considered the adventures that had but lately befallen them. Over and over again <b>did</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> tell of their doings while on the Pacific, and as Crusoes, {{and some of the}} cadets never tired of listening to the stories.

60|$|So {{vigilant}} was {{the watch}} in the castle of Dunottar that the instant the cry of alarm rose almost simultaneously from the warder above and the soldiers at the gate, the portcullis came thundering down. It was caught, however, by the two upright blocks of wood, and remained suspended three feet above the sill. The armed guards at the gate instantly fell upon Archie and his companions, while others endeavoured in vain to close the gates. Scarcely had the swords clashed when {{the man who had}} chained down the drawbridge joined Archie, and the five with their heavy broadswords kept at bay the soldiers who pressed upon them; but for only a minute or two <b>did</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> bear the brunt of the attack unsupported, for William Orr and the five men who had been loitering near the moat dashed across the bridge, and passing under the portcullis joined the little band.|$|E
60|$|Our two spectators {{might have}} been seated on the fallen tree half an hour, all of which time they had been gazing at what was passing before their eyes; with {{positively}} not a human sound to relieve the unearthly nature of the picture. No one spoke, coughed, laughed, or exclaimed, in all that period. Suddenly, every chief stood still, and all the faces turned in the same direction. It was toward the little gateway of the rill, which being {{the side of the}} arena most remote from the bee-hunter and the corporal, lay nearly in darkness as respected them. With the red men it must have been different, for THEY all appeared to be in intent expectation of some one from that quarter. Nor <b>did</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> wait long; for, in half a minute, two forms came out of the obscurity, advancing with a dignified and deliberate tread to the centre of the arena. As these newcomers got more within the influence of the flickering light, le Bourdon saw that they were Peter and Parson Amen. The first led, with a slow, imposing manner, while the other followed, not a little bewildered with what he saw. It may be as well to explain here, that the Indian was coming alone to this place of meeting, when he encountered the missionary wandering among the oaks, looking for le Bourdon and the corporal, and, instead of endeavoring to throw off this unexpected companion, he quietly invited him to be of his own party.|$|E

No longer did Inspirationists have to endure persecution by outsiders. They were now permitted to teach their children in their own schools.
