5|$|As Scully {{heads to}} the other room to get ready, her FBI badge falls out of her coat pocket. Scully discreetly picks it back up without Ed noticing. The tattoo begins to talk again, convincing <b>Ed</b> <b>to</b> redial Scully's last call to see who she was {{speaking}} to. An FBI operator answers and, upon learning that Scully is an FBI agent, the tattoo forces <b>Ed</b> <b>to</b> attack her. Scully tries to escape but is overpowered by Ed, who wraps her in a bedsheet and carries her {{down to the basement}} to throw her in the furnace. At the last moment, Ed is able to overpower the impulses of the tattoo and instead thrusts his own arm into the furnace.|$|E

5|$|Scar {{debuted in}} The Lion King (1994). The jealous younger brother of Mufasa, Scar was next-in-line {{to take the}} throne until his nephew Simba, Mufasa's son, was born, {{replacing}} him. Determined to usurp the throne and become king himself, Scar devises a plan to kill both Simba and Mufasa. Cleverly trapping Simba in a vast gorge, Scar signals his hyena minions, Shenzi, Banzai and <b>Ed,</b> <b>to</b> trigger a wildebeest stampede. Although Mufasa saves Simba, the king is weakened, and unable {{to climb out of}} the gorge to safety. When Mufasa begs Scar for help, Scar instead throws his brother to his death below. Convincing Simba that he is to blame for Mufasa's death, Scar advises the prince to run away and never return, then orders the hyenas to pursue and kill him. With his brother murdered and his nephew presumed dead, Scar returns to Pride Rock and tells the pride that both father and son are dead before becoming king.|$|E

40|$|We {{determined}} dopamine (DA), noradrenaline (NA), and adrenaline (A), {{as well as}} immunohistochemically stained tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and DA in dissected rat ventral mesencephalon (VM) {{tissue from}} Embryonic Day (<b>ED)</b> 14 <b>to</b> Postnatal Day (P) 17. Whole VM tissue DA, NA, and A contents increased with advancing age. VRI DA/protein increased from <b>ED</b> 15 <b>to</b> <b>ED</b> 16, whereas NA/protein increased from <b>ED</b> 15 <b>to</b> <b>ED</b> 16 and from <b>ED</b> 20 <b>to</b> P 4. VM DA/NA ratio increased from <b>ED</b> 14 <b>to</b> <b>ED</b> 15 and decreased from <b>ED</b> 18 <b>to</b> P 4. VM cell suspensions exhibited higher DA/NA ratios than whole VM tissue. Washed cell suspensions had higher DA/NA than unwashed counterparts. We conclude that data from both VM immunohistochemistry and catecholamine assays relate to VRI development. VM DA is contained mainly in cells, whereas VRI NA is located in fibers that channel at the dorsal side of the VM. Determination of tissue catecholamine contents may be helpful for the biochemical characterization of tentatively identified VM grafts. (C) 1997 Academic Press...|$|R
5|$|Scully {{performs}} {{an autopsy}} on McRoberts' body and discovers signs of phobia including {{high levels of}} adrenaline and the same substance found on the elevator killer. She hypothesizes that the substance, when combined with other neurochemicals, produces an LSD-like reaction. While Mulder and Scully build a case, Funsch becomes more psychotic, continuing to see violent messages on electronic gadgets. Blood is associated in some way with each incident; a volunteer asks <b>Ed</b> <b>to</b> donate blood at a department store and seconds later he sees violent images, including a video of the 1993 Waco siege burning, flash across a sales display of TV sets, followed by a message to get a gun from the sporting goods department.|$|E

Natasha meets Ed Lee (Sebastian Gregory) at Charlie's and offers to help him solve a maths equation, but he dismisses her. When she solves the problem, he invites her to a maths club. Natasha later transfers to his calculus course and Ed helps her with conditional probability, which they use to predict the outcome of a game of cards. They decide to play a game of Blackjack with a group of guys at Charlie's, but are forced to stop when a couple of police officers walks in. Natasha convinces <b>Ed</b> <b>to</b> hold a game at the Men's Shed, so they can continue to test the theory and make some money. Andrew comes up with an idea to use the theory to make an odds calculator mobile app. When Natasha goes to asks Ed about the idea, he introduces her to the hobby of LARPing, before agreeing to sign Andrew's contract.|$|E

25|$|While the Snows {{were settled}} back in America, Ed would {{continue}} to travel {{back and forth between}} home and Europe. His books and reporting on China had earned him critical acclaim in the U.S. This success made Ed a very valuable asset as a war correspondent. President Roosevelt often looked to Ed for his understanding on matters in Asia. Roosevelt personally suggested Ed become a war correspondent once again, to which Ed agreed. Though {{he did not want to}} report on World War II directly after his time in China, his personal struggles with Helen and encouragement from Roosevelt pushed <b>Ed</b> <b>to</b> travel and cover the war. In 1945, the couple legally separated. Ed started a new relationship with actress Lois Wheeler and sought a divorce from Helen. The divorce proceedings took several years as the two were stalemated in terms of settlement. The couple formally divorced in 1949. Ed married Lois less than ten days after the official date of the divorce. He lived in exile in Switzerland until he died from cancer in 1972.|$|E

40|$|Data mining {{problems}} {{are common in}} public health, for example for identifying disease clusters and multidimensional patterns within large databases, e. g. socioeconomic differentials in health. Although numerous data mining methods have been developed, currently available methods are not designed to handle complex pattern searching queries and no satisfactory methods are available for this purpose. The aim of {{the study reported here}} was to test graph-theoretical methods for data mining in public health databases to identify areas of high deprivation that are surrounded by affluent areas and deprived areas surrounded by deprived areas. Graph-theory (using the maximum common subgraph isomorphism (mcs) method) was used to search a database containing information on the 10920 enumeration districts (EDs) for the Trent Region of England. Each <b>ED</b> was allocated <b>to</b> a deprivation quintile based on the Townsend Deprivation Score. These mcs program was used <b>to</b> identify deprived <b>EDs</b> that are adjacent <b>to</b> deprived <b>EDs</b> and deprived EDs that are adjacent <b>to</b> affluent <b>EDs.</b> The mcs program identified 1528 deprived <b>EDs</b> adjacent <b>to</b> at least two deprived EDs, 1181 deprived <b>EDs</b> adjacent <b>to</b> at least three deprived EDs, 802 deprived <b>EDs</b> adjacent <b>to</b> at least four deprived EDs, and 505 deprived <b>EDs</b> adjacent <b>to</b> at least five deprived EDs. The program successfully identified 147 deprived <b>EDs</b> adjacent <b>to</b> at least two affluent EDs, 54 deprived <b>EDs</b> adjacent <b>to</b> at least three affluent EDs, 14 deprived <b>EDs</b> adjacent <b>to</b> at least four affluent EDs, and six deprived <b>EDs</b> adjacent <b>to</b> at least five affluent EDs. The retrieved EDs were then used for hypothesis testing using statistical methods. The study demonstrates the potential of graph theoretical techniques for data mining in public health databases. ...|$|R

The uncertainty of operators at the plant was reflected in fragmentary, ambiguous, or contradictory statements made by Met <b>Ed</b> <b>to</b> government agencies and to the press, particularly about the possibility and severity of off-site radioactivity releases. Scranton {{held a press conference}} in which he was reassuring, yet confusing, about this possibility, stating that though there had been a [...] "small release of radiation...no increase in normal radiation levels" [...] had been detected. These were contradicted by another official, and by statements from Met Ed, who both claimed that no radioactivity had been released. In fact, readings from instruments at the plant and off-site detectors had detected radioactivity releases, albeit at levels that were unlikely to threaten public health {{as long as they were}} temporary, and providing that containment of the then highly contaminated reactor was maintained.|$|E
