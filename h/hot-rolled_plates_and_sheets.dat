40|$|Abstract. This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the problem of automatic inspection of <b>hot-rolled</b> <b>plate</b> surface using computer vision. An automated visual inspection system has been developed to take images of external <b>hot-rolled</b> <b>plate</b> surfaces <b>and</b> an intelligent surface defect detection paradigm based on gradient spectrum technique is presented. Gradient spectrum characterizes the spatial configuration of local image texture and is robust against any monotonic transformation of the gray scale. Texture features based on gradient spectrum are extracted from ROI in <b>hot-rolled</b> <b>plate</b> surface images <b>and</b> integrated into a feature vector which uniquely differentiates the abnormal regions from normal surface. Classification accuracies using the gradient spectrum and gradient-based method are compared. The results indicate that gradient spectrum performs well in classifying the samples with the lowest classification error...|$|R

40|$|Trace boron {{addition}} (~ 0. 1 wt. %) {{to conventional}} titanium alloys reduces the as-cast prior-beta grain size by {{an order of}} magnitude to about 200 μm, a grain size typically observed after ingot breakdown. In this study, the feasibility of producing <b>plate</b> <b>and</b> <b>sheet</b> by hot rolling of as-cast Ti- 6 Al- 4 V- 0. 1 B (wt. %) was evaluated. Starting from an initial thickness of 25 mm, as-cast Ti- 6 Al- 4 V- 0. 1 B was successfully rolled to 2 mm sheet in a multistep rolling process. As-cast Ti- 6 Al- 4 V (without boron addition) rolled under similar conditions exhibited severe cracking. Tensile properties of the <b>sheets</b> <b>and</b> <b>plates</b> made from the boron-containing alloy met or exceeded AMS 4911 specifications for Ti- 6 Al- 4 V <b>plates</b> <b>and</b> <b>sheets</b> produced by conventional processing route. The process of making <b>plate</b> <b>and</b> <b>sheet</b> stock from cast titanium alloy ingots, without recourse to expensive ingot breakdown, can significantly reduce the number of expensive and time-consuming processing steps for making titanium alloy components, thereby enhancing the affordability and expanding the range of titanium applications...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this investigation is to fabricate and evaluate PM 2124 Al alloy <b>plate</b> <b>and</b> <b>sheet</b> materials according to NASA program goals for damage tolerance and fatigue resistance. Previous research has indicated the outstanding strength-toughness relationship available with PM 2124 Al-Zr modified alloy compositions in extruded product forms. The range of processing conditions was explored in the fabrication of <b>plate</b> <b>and</b> <b>sheet</b> gage materials, {{as well as the}} resultant mechanical and metallurgical properties. The PM composition based on Al- 3. 70 Cu- 1. 85 Mg- 0. 20 Mn with 0. 60 wt. pct. Zr was selected. Flat rolled material consisting of 0. 250 in. thick plate was fabricated using selected thermal mechanical treatments (TMT). The schedule of TMT operations was designed to yield the extreme conditions of grain structure normally encountered in the fabrication of flat rolled products, specifically recrystallized and unrecrystallized. The PM Al alloy <b>plate</b> <b>and</b> <b>sheet</b> materials exhibited improved strength properties at thin gages compared to IM Al alloys, as a consequence of their enhanced ability to inhibit recrystallization and grain growth. In addition, the PM 2124 Al alloys offer much better combinations of strength and toughnessover equivalent IM Al. The alloy microstructures were examined by optical metallographic texture techniques in order to establish the metallurgical basis for these significant property improvements...|$|R

40|$|Structural {{grades of}} hot rolled low <b>and</b> medium carbon <b>plates</b> <b>and</b> <b>sheets</b> {{commonly}} used for deep drawing applications. Cracking on the bend faces, {{as well as}} aging effects are the major defects, which usually causes rejection of the sufficient volumes of steel. It is a common knowledge that steels containing interstitial nitrogen {{appear to be more}} susceptible than lownitrogen steels to stress-corrosion cracking. Nitrogen exists in steel primary in combination, as nitrides of metallic elements or as molecular nitrogen in cracks or blowholes. The solubility of nitrogen in ferrite at room temperature in low and medium carbon steel not exceeds 0. 001 %, and precipitation effects caused by nitrogen may occur in steel containing more than this amount. It is also well known that increased carbon content reduces the tendency of steel to fail by intergranuular cracking [1].
