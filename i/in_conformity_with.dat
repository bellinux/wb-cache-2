5|$|Harith {{advocated}} various reforms, {{the most}} prominent being the full legal equality of the native non-Arab converts (mawali) with the Arab Muslims, echoing a long-standing demand of the former, <b>in</b> <b>conformity</b> <b>with</b> the precepts of Islam. This had been attempted twice before, by the Caliph Umar II (r. 717–720) and by the governors Asad ibn Abdallah al-Qasri and Ashras ibn Abdallah al-Sulami, but both times the resulting rise in conversions and concomitant drop in revenue (as the numerous mawali {{would not have to}} pay the poll tax) put an end to this, leading to a first rebellion in 728 under Abu al-Sayda' Salih ibn Tarif. Many of the groups and individuals associated with this first uprising would also participate in Harith's movement. Harith was seen as a champion of the rights of the ʿajam (non-Arabs, especially Iranians), many of whom flocked to his banner, but he also had a large following from the disaffected among the Arabs themselves, especially his fellow Tamim and the Azd. Disaffection was widespread among the Khurasani Arabs due to the heavy casualties suffered against the Turgesh at the Battle of the Defile in 731, as well as the dissemination of anti-Umayyad propaganda by proto-Shi'ite groups. This was exacerbated by the resentment felt at the introduction of 20,000 Iraqi troops into the province {{in the aftermath of the}} Defile, and the parallel order of Caliph Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik (r. 723–743) to disperse the older Arab settlers from Marw to other settlements so as to improve their defence against the Turgesh.|$|E

30|$|However, the EDS {{spectrum}} of the ZTO nanowires is not shown.

The co-electrodeposition technique (Zn and Sn) offers simple and flexible control of the ZTO nanowire composition. This method is excellent for good-quality ZTO nanowire synthesis. Most importantly, co-depositing the Zn and Sn alloy nanowires to create the ZTO nanowires on the AAO template has the advantage that the content of Zn/Sn is comparatively easy to control.|$|R
