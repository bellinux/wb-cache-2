25|$|When wire {{insulation}} disintegrates, it {{can result in}} an unintended electrical contact at a different location from the desired sensing point. If such a damaged thermocouple {{is used in the}} closed loop control of a thermostat or other temperature controller, this can lead to a runaway overheating event and possibly severe damage, as the false temperature reading will typically be lower than the sensing <b>junction</b> <b>temperature.</b> Failed insulation will also typically outgas, which can lead to process contamination. For parts of thermocouples used at very high temperatures or in contamination-sensitive applications, the only suitable insulation may be vacuum or inert gas; the mechanical rigidity of the thermocouple wires is used to keep them separated.|$|E

25|$|Heat production: The {{ever-increasing}} {{density of}} MOSFETs on an integrated circuit creates problems of substantial localized heat generation that can impair circuit operation. Circuits operate more slowly at high temperatures, and have reduced reliability and shorter lifetimes. Heat sinks and other cooling devices and methods are now required for many integrated circuits including microprocessors. Power MOSFETs {{are at risk}} of thermal runaway. As their on-state resistance rises with temperature, if the load is approximately a constant-current load then the power loss rises correspondingly, generating further heat. When the heatsink is not able to keep the temperature low enough, the <b>junction</b> <b>temperature</b> may rise quickly and uncontrollably, resulting in destruction of the device.|$|E

5000|$|In 2013, Ye et al. have a {{publication}} of [...] "Thermal Transient Effect and Improved <b>Junction</b> <b>Temperature</b> Measurement Method in High Voltage Light-Emitting Diodes". In their experiments, a high voltage LED chip was directly attached on silicon substrate with thin thermal interface material (TIM). The temperature sensors were fabricated using standard silicon processing technologies which were calibrated ranging from 30 °C to 150 °C. The thickness of the chip and TIM were 153μm and 59μm, respectively. Thus the sensors were {{very close to the}} p-n junction. The silicon substrate was positioned and vacuumed on a cumbersome thermal plate with accurate temperature controller in an enclosure. The experimenters applied step-up/step-down currents and measured the characteristics between temperature and forward voltage after 100 ms. In this work, the ‘recovery time’ is defined as the interval from the start of power change to the time at which the temperature became again equal to the initial temperature value. The results show that the <b>junction</b> <b>temperature</b> of LED decreases significantly and immediately (more than 10 °C) when a current from 100 μA to 15 mA is applied. Then, the <b>junction</b> <b>temperature</b> gradually increases. After a recovery time of ~100 ms, the <b>junction</b> <b>temperature</b> reaches the initial value. At the steady state of 15 mA, the applied high current is instantly reduced through a step-down mode to 100 μA. The measured <b>junction</b> <b>temperature</b> increases by 4 °C within 0.1 ms. The sensor temperature simultaneously shows a temperature increase of 2 °C. Subsequently, the <b>junction</b> <b>temperature</b> gradually decreases. After a recovery time of ~100 ms, the <b>junction</b> <b>temperature</b> decrease to their initial values.

30|$|A {{reliability}} evaluation method for hybrid tidal and wind power systems with battery energy storage is presented. Such hybrid systems with co-existence of both tidal and wind energy sources may most likely occur in coastal areas or islands. A chronological multiple state probability model of tidal {{power generation system}} (TPGS) is developed. In this model, both force outage rate (FOR) of TPGS and random nature of tidal current speed are considered. A TPGS or WPGS (wind power generation system) includes a power electronic converter in which the failure rates of electronic components are sensitive to their <b>junction</b> <b>temperatures,</b> whereas the <b>junction</b> <b>temperatures</b> depend on delivered powers of a TPGS or WPGS.
