40|$|This thesis {{describes}} a novel microfabrication process to produce thick-film copper microstructures that {{are embedded in}} polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). This process has reduced fabrication complexity and cost compared to existing techniques, and enables rapid prototyping of designs using minimal microfabrication equipment. This technology differs from others in its use of a conductive copper paint seed layer and a unique infrared-assisted transfer process. The resulting microstructures are embedded flush with the PDMS surface, rather than on top, and adhere to PDMS without the need of surface modifications. The 70 -micrometers-thick copper layer has a surface roughness of approximately 5 micrometers, a low film resistivity of 2. 5 - 3 micro-Ohm-cm, and can be patterned with feature sizes of 100 micrometers. The low-cost, thick metal films demonstrate a comparative advantage in high-current, low-power applications, with feature sizes and metal layer properties that are otherwise comparable to similar processes. Several applications are fabricated, including stretchable interconnects <b>integrated</b> <b>with</b> <b>fabrics</b> for wearable devices and a multi-layer electromagnetic microactuator with a soft magnetic nanocomposite polymer core for large magnetic field generation. The interconnects can accommodate strains of 57 percent before conductive failure, {{which is similar to}} existing technology, and demonstrate a significantly lower resistance of less than 0. 5 Ohm per device. The actuator produces an average magnetic field of 2. 5 milli-Tesla per volt applied within a cylindrical volume of 34 cubic millimeters. Simulations indicate that fields of up to 1 Tesla are possible for 200 micro-second input pulses, and that significantly larger fields are achievable through simple design modifications. These results are comparable to existing devices, while our device has the advantage of being fully flexible, low-cost, and is easily integrated with various substrates and polymer microfabrication processes...|$|E

40|$|During incineration, {{secondary}} pollutants such as acid gases, organic compounds, heavy metals and particulates are generated. Among these pollutants, the acid gases, including sulfur oxides (SOx) and hydrogen chloride (HCl), can cause corrosion of the incinerator piping and can generate acid rain after being emitted to the atmosphere. To address this problem, {{the present study}} used a novel combination of air pollution control devices (APCDs), composed of a fluidized bed adsorber <b>integrated</b> <b>with</b> a <b>fabric</b> filter. The major objective {{of the work is}} to demonstrate the performance of a fluidized bed adsorber for removal of acid gases from flue gas of an incinerator. The adsorbents added in the fluidized bed adsorber were mainly granular activated carbon (AC; with or without chemical treatment) and with calcium oxide used as an additive. The advantages of a fluidized bed reactor for high mass transfer and high gas-solid contact can enhance the removal of acid gases when using a dry method. On the other hand, because the fluidized bed can filter particles, fine particles prior to and after passing through the fluidized bed adsorber were investigated. The competing adsorption on activated carbon between different characteristics of pollutants was also given preliminary discussion. The results indicate that the removal efficiencies of the investigated acid gases, SO 2 and HCl, are higher than 94 and 87 %, respectively. Thus, a fluidized bed adsorber <b>integrated</b> <b>with</b> a <b>fabric</b> filter has the potential to replace conventional APCDs, even when there are other pollutants at the same time.

40|$|The {{injection}} of dry Ca-based sorbents for removing acid gases had been investigated previously. However, {{the utilization of}} Ca-based sorbents for adsorbing other air pollutants was rarely examined. The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate the reduction of organic compounds polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene (BTEX) and heavy metals by using the desulfurization sorbents in a dry scrubber <b>integrated</b> <b>with</b> a <b>fabric</b> filter. Four surfactants, calcium lignosulfonate, sodium lignosulfonate, alkyl naphthalene sodium sulfonate and beta-naphthalene sodium sulfonate condensates, were used as additives to modify the surface characteristics of desulfurization sorbent calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH) (2)). Modifying the desulfurization sorbents with surfactants showed different effects on removal of PAHs, BTEX, and heavy metals, and exploited the potential of Ca-based sorbents for adsorbing air pollutants other than SO 2.

40|$|This study {{reports on}} a Multiscale Entropy (MSE) {{analysis}} on Heart Rate Variability (HRV) series gathered from eight patients with pathological mental states. Specifically, we found that an HRV complexity modulation exists in bipolar patients who exhibit mood states among depression, hypoma-nia, and euthymia, i. e., good affective balance. Two different methodologies for {{the choice of the}} sample entropy radius value were also compared. MSE analysis was performed on long-term night recordings acquired using a comfortable sensing t-shirt <b>with</b> <b>integrated</b> <b>fabric</b> electrodes and sensors developed in the frame of the European project PSYCHE. As the current clinical practice in diagnosing patients affected by psychiatric disorders such as bipolar disorder is only based on verbal interviews and scores from specific questionnaires, these findings increase the reliability of using heartbeat complexity as a more objective clinical biomarkers for bipolar disorders...|$|R
40|$|In hydroentanglement process, {{very fine}} water jets with high {{pressure}} impinge on the fiberweb, which {{is supported by}} forming wires. The impact of the jets causes fiber entanglement in the fiberweb and produces an <b>integrated</b> <b>fabric</b> <b>with</b> desired performance, texture, and appearance similar to the forming wires. It is important {{that at the end}} of the process, the fiberweb can be easily separated from the forming wires. In this paper, the force of peeling required for the separation of the wet, hydroentangled fabric from the forming wires is measured experimentally. A set of experimental trials was conducted to investigate the effects of the jet pressure, fiberweb basis weight, and forming wires mesh size on the peeling force. Visualizing fibers caught in the knuckles of the forming wires under magnification reveals physical mechanisms leading to the formation of the peeling force...|$|R
40|$|The {{mission of}} the studio is to open an {{architectural}} discourse concerning the development of high-rise building in a city context. The discourse mostly concern the meaning and value of tall buildings in modern society. It is important to rethink and reinvent a tall building type that not only to meet the increasing demands of urban dwelling, and financial exploitation, the highrise could contribute to the urban sustainabiliy and provide alternatives of how city operate, connect <b>with</b> urban <b>fabric,</b> and reflect {{the nature of the}} city. My concern in my tall design project is to find a new high-rise typology which could <b>integrate</b> <b>with</b> eixsting urban <b>fabric</b> and street life in an intensifying city. When a city population increase, building scales enlarges and the city may grow into metropolitian. Existing buildings in the city may transform into mega block or super tall buildings. Such mega block building would kill the streetscape and block the urban fabric. Residents living in those building would sense isolation from neighborhood and the lost of identity. It is important to tackle the social problems by introducing new strategies to design high-rise residential buildings. The design is to achieve a rich neighborhood and lively streetscape by re-composite the arrangement of high-rise components to create a new kind of tall building typology.

40|$|Complexity {{measures}} from Multiscale Entropy (MSE) {{analysis of}} cardiovascular variability may provide potential biomarkers of pathological mental {{states such as}} major depression. To this extent, {{in this study we}} investigate whether complexity of Heart Rate Variability (HRV) is also affected in mental disorders such as bipolar disorders (BD). As part of the European project PSYCHE, eight BD patients experiencing multiple pathological mood states among depression, hypomania, and euthymia (i. e., good affective balance) underwent long-term night recordings through a comfortable sensing t-shirt <b>with</b> <b>integrated</b> <b>fabric</b> electrodes and sensors. Standard radius, i. e., 20 % of the HRV standard deviation, and a maximal-radius choice for the sample entropy estimation were compared along with a further multiscale Renyi Entropy analysis. We found that, despite the inter-subject variability, the maximal-radius MSE analysis is able to discern the considered pathological mental states of BD. As the current clinical practice in diagnosing BD is only based on verbal interviews and scores from specific questionnaires, these findings provide evidence on the possibility of using heartbeat complexity as the basis of novel clinical biomarkers of mental disorders...|$|R

40|$|The {{following}} dissertation {{will consider}} the contemporary education of natural languages and explore its influences on designed space in an urban environment. The concept of weaving cultures together by using languages will be investigated {{in order to produce}} an architectural intervention of amalgamated infill and voids. The structure of natural languages willl be used as a departure point to propose a public facility on the University of Pretoria's main campus. This facility will fit into a network of public gathering spaces proposed in the area, and will be {{in the form of an}} interactive learning and information space that will provide the users with an opportunity to engage in intercultural cross pollination in various languages. The site was selected for its ability to enable the opportunity for social interaction and design exploration, and it is significantly located at a point where two major urban grid patterns touch each other. The proposed design celebrates this concept of convergence in which voids between cultures are filled with understanding. The success of the proposed project will depend on the ability of the language learning centre to <b>integrate</b> <b>with</b> the urban <b>fabric</b> and most importantly, facilitate the education of language, communication and cultural interaction.

40|$|Current {{clinical}} practice in diagnosing patients affected by psychiatric {{disorders such as}} bipolar disorder is based only on verbal interviews and scores from specific questionnaires, and no reliable and objective psycho-physiological markers are taken into account. In this paper, we propose to use a wearable system based on a comfortable t-shirt <b>with</b> <b>integrated</b> <b>fabric</b> electrodes and sensors able to acquire electrocardiogram, respirogram, and body posture information in order to detect a pattern of objective physiological parameters to support diagnosis. Moreover, we implemented a novel ad hoc methodology of advanced biosignal processing able to effectively recognize four possible clinical mood states in bipolar patients (i. e., depression, mixed state, hypomania, and euthymia) continuously monitored up to 18 h, using heart rate variability information exclusively. Mood assessment is intended as an intrasubject evaluation in which the patient's states are modeled as aMarkov chain, i. e., in the time domain, each mood state refers to the previous one. As validation, eight bipolar patients weremonitored collecting and analyzing more than 400 h of autonomic and cardiovascular activity. Experimental results demonstrate that our novel concept of personalized and pervasive monitoring constitutes a viable and robust {{clinical decision support system}} for bipolar disorders recognizing mood states with a total classification accuracy up to 95. 81 %...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, the low {{velocity}} impact {{characteristics and}} impact damage of sandwich composites, produced at four different core thicknesses from 3 -dimensional (3 D) <b>integrated</b> sandwich <b>fabrics,</b> <b>with</b> and without foam filling, have been examined. The 3 D sandwich fabrics {{have been produced}} using the same yarn and weaving densities. Thus, the impact characteristics are only affected by the core thickness and whether foam filling is used or not. Low velocity impact tests have been conducted at 32 and 48 J energy levels. The impact behavior has been determined {{as a function of}} the peak load, the energy to peak load, the time to peak load and the absorbed energy. The impact damage and the change in the compressive strength after impact have been analyzed. The findings obtained indicate that core-skin delamination on 3 D sandwich composites has been fully prevented. Impact tests carried out on integrated 3 D sandwich structures have shown that impact damage is limited to the vicinity of the point of impact and does not affect the integrity of the structure. This indicates that such damage can be easily repaired and the service life of the product can be sustained. status: publishe...|$|R
