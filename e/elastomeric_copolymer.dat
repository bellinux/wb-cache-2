40|$|Acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS) is an <b>elastomeric</b> <b>copolymer</b> with a {{wide range}} of {{technological}} applications due to their outstanding combination between cost, optimal manufacturing conditions and attractive properties. Nevertheless, ABS copolymers present higher weathering susceptibility in the presence of UV radiation, oxygen, temperature and humidity; which is related with polybutadiene that acts as a photoactivator, inducing oxidation of the polystyrene in the styrene-acrylonitrile macrophase [1]. ABS photodegradation can be detected by chemical modifications and formation of new compounds. Color changes and drastic loss in mechanical properties can also be noticed [2]. Light stabilizers, such as HALS and UVA, are included in ABS formulations to extend polymer lifetime, and this stabilization is made on empiric acknowledgment. In the present work, a systematic stabilization study will be performed in ABS copolymer. Stabilized ABS samples were exposed to accelerated and natural weathering.

The development of polymer composites by the addition of inorganic fillers to the poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) increases the potential use of this polymer in various application fields. The main objective of this work was to study the rheological and mechanical behavior of composites obtained from the addition of silica in two different types of PMMA matrix: a common (PMMAc) and an <b>elastomeric</b> <b>copolymer</b> (PMMAel). The results showed that the addition of silica particles to the PMMA matrix promoted an increase in torque, a decrease in the melt flow index of composites and an increase in hardness compared to pure polymers. The composites also showed a reduction of the maximum tensile strength for composites with PMMAc matrix and maintenance of tensile strength for composites with PMMAel matrix.

In this research, the mechanics and physics of large deformation behavior of <b>elastomeric</b> <b>copolymers</b> are addressed in terms of their resilience and dissipation involving <b>elastomeric</b> "segmented" <b>copolymers</b> and <b>elastomeric</b> "ionic" <b>copolymers.</b> The presence of hard and soft domains yields to multiple molecular relaxations and hence multiple viscous dissipation mechanisms in <b>elastomeric</b> <b>copolymers.</b> In addition to the viscous dissipation, stretch-induced softening due to microstructural evolution revealed via x-ray scattering observation during deformation provides another major dissipation pathway. Furthermore the segmented copolymers exhibit a substantial shape recovery upon unloading in tandem with a remarkable amount of hysteresis. A microstructurally-informed constitutive model is proposed to address the main features of mechanical behavior of exemplar copolymers under a variety of loading conditions, employing multiple micro-rheological mechanisms representing hard and soft domains. The proposed model was found to be capable of capturing the salient features of resilient yet dissipative stress-strain behavior of materials at a wide range of strains and strain rates. The model was then furthered to examine the effect of weight fraction, morphology and segmental dynamics of hard and soft microstructures. Next, the resilience and dissipation in <b>elastomeric</b> segmented <b>copolymers</b> are examined in their connections to shape recovery under microindentation testing in experiments and numerical simulations. Numerical simulations imparting the proposed constitutive model were found to be capable of capturing the microindentation behavior of materials including force-displacement capable of capturing the microindentation behavior of materials including force-displacement responses under complicated loading scenarios. Additionally, the microindentation behavior revealed a substantial shape recovery of indented surfaces which was due to inelastic flow beyond elastic resilience. The elastically- and inelastically-driven shape recovery provides critical insight into a better understanding of shape memory, recovery and self-healing mechanisms in this class of segmented elastomers. The extreme nature of <b>elastomeric</b> <b>copolymers</b> under harsh mechanical environments is then addressed via Taylor impact testing, where an ultrafast deformation event is incurred. Numerical simulations of Taylor impact behavior of <b>elastomeric</b> <b>copolymers</b> are compared to experimental results in terms of overall and localized deformation profiles, revealing a three-dimensional capability of our framework under dynamic, inhomogeneous deformation field. Furthermore, energy dissipation under such an extreme event is examined by comparison to that found in "model" glassy and rubbery polymers revealing that copolymeric materials enable a highly recoverable, protective composite architecture for shock and ballistic mitigation by taking advantages of hybrid performance of glassy and rubbery polymers. Lastly, the mechanics of <b>elastomeric</b> "ionic" <b>copolymers</b> is addressed for a broad understanding of their resilience, dissipation and shape recovery under a wide range of mechanical loading conditions. Our viscoelastic-viscoplastic constitutive framework is further developed to address the large deformation behavior of ionic elastomers including ethylene methacrylic acid (EMAA) copolymer and its chemically-modified counterparts which are recently finding new avenues towards multi-functional soft materials involving their self-healing ability under severe deformation events. This study provides a simple yet intuitive framework to rationalize physically-sound deformation mechanisms of diverse <b>elastomeric</b> <b>copolymers</b> by employing a combination of novel modeling, experimentation and computation. Finally, potential topics for further research, to which the present work can directly contribute, are discussed {{in a wide variety of}} engineering contexts. by Hansohl Cho. Thesis: Ph.

TMC-DLLA copolymers are amorphous and degrade more rapidly in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) of pH 7. 4 at 37 Â°C than (semi-crystalline) TMC-CL copolymers. TMC-DLLA with 20 or 50 mol% TMC loose their tensile strength in less than 5 months and are totally resorbed in 11 months. In PBS, TMC-CL copolymers retain suitable mechanical properties {{for more than a}} year. Cell seeding studies show that rat cardiomyocytes and human Schwann cells attach and proliferate well on the TMC-based copolymers. TMC-DLLA copolymers with either 20 or 50 mol% of TMC are totally amorphous and very flexible, making them excellent polymers for the preparation of porous scaffolds for heart tissue engineering. Porous structures of TMC-DLLA copolymers were prepared by compression molding and particulate leaching techniques.

However, {{the ability of the}} ACH to protect soldiers against blast loading appears not to be as effective. Polyurea, a micro-segregated <b>elastomeric</b> <b>copolymer</b> has shown superior shock-mitigation capabilities. In the present work, a combined Eulerian/Lagrangian transient non-linear dynamics computational fluid/solid interaction anal-ysis is used to investigate potential shock-mitigation benefits which may result from different polyurea-based design augmentations of the ACH. Specific augmentations include replacement of the currently used suspension-pad material with polyurea and the introduction of a thin polyurea internal lining/external coating to the ACH shell. Effectiveness of different ACH designs was quantified by: (a) establishing the main forms of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI); (b) identifying the key mechanical causes for these injuries; and (c) quantifying the extents of reductions in the magnitude of these mechanical causes.

40|$|Abstract: One of {{the ongoing}} {{challenges}} in tissue engi-neering is the synthesis of a hemocompatible vascular graft. Specifically, the material used in the construct should have antithrombogenic properties and support the growth of vascular cells. Our laboratory has designed a novel biodegradable, <b>elastomeric</b> <b>copolymer,</b> poly(1, 8 -octa-nediol citrate) (POC), with mechanical and degradation properties suitable for vascular tissue engineering. The hemocompatibility of POC in vitro {{and its ability to}} sup-port the attachment and differentiation of human aortic endothelial cell (HAEC) was assessed. The thrombogenic-ity and inflammatory potential of POC were assessed rela-tive to poly(l-lactide-co-glycolide) and expanded poly(tet-rafluoroethylene), as they have been used in FDA-approved devices for blood contact. Specifically, platelet aggregation and activation, protein adsorption, plasma clotting, and hemolysis were investigated. To assess the inflammatory potential of POC, the release of IL- 1 b and TNF-a from THP- 1 cells was measured. The cell compati-bility of POC was assessed by confirming HAEC differen-tiation and attachment under flow conditions. POC exhib-ited decreased platelet adhesion and clotting relative to control materials. Hemolysis was negligible and protein adsorption was comparable to reference materials. IL- 1 b and TNF-a release from THP- 1 cells was comparable among all materials tested, suggesting minimal inflamma-tory potential. POC supported HAEC differentiation and attachment without any premodification of the surface. The results described herein are encouraging and suggest that POC is hemocompatible and an adequate candidate biomaterial for in vivo vascular tissue engineering. 200...|$|E

A short oxygen plasma pretreatment enhances the adhesion and stability of the film as shown by protein binding and cell adhesion experiments.

Helium, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, methane, and carbon dioxide were used for gas permeation rate measurements. Vapor transport properties were studied for the aliphatic hydrocarbon (hexane), aromatic compound (toluene), alcohol (ethanol), as well as water for the representative samples. The mechanical properties and homogeneity of samples was checked by stress-strain tests. The addition of virgin CNTs and CFs improve mechanical properties. Gas permeability of EOC lies between that of the more permeable PDMS and the less permeable semi-crystalline polyethylene and polypropylene. Organic vapors are more permeable than permanent gases in the composite membranes, with toluene and hexane permeabilities being about two orders of magnitude higher than permanent gas permeability.

The cylindrical and lamellar morphology of PS-b-PI copolymer was employed to generate the morphology of elastomeric nanoparticles such as nanofiber and nanosheet. The particles were synthesized using cold vulcanization process. The vulcanization process using sulfur monochloride (S 2 Cl 2) was used to preserve the morphologies. The crosslinking density of block copolymer was controlled by exposure time of crosslinking agent in the chamber. The blend samples for DMA and rheometer were prepared using solvent casting process. The diameter and thickness of nanofiber and nanosheet obtained by the process were ~ 40 nm and ~ 70 nm, respectively. The rheological and dynamic mechanical {{properties of}} the blends of polystyrene (PS) and elastomeric nanoparticles were studied in terms of morphology and crosslinking density.

The thermal and mechanical properties of ORC, OBC and their blends are investigated by DSC, {{dynamic mechanical analysis}} and tensile tests. The morphology of the semi-crystalline samples is studied by AFM and WAXS. Two types of crystals have been observed: (i) Orthorhombic crystals forming lamellae with an estimated thickness of about 13 nm composed mainly of long polyethylene-like sequences of OBC that melt a temperature of about 120 degrees C and (ii) fringed micellar crystals with a thickness of 2 - 4 nm formed basically by short polyethylene-like sequences of ORC that have melting temperatures between 30 and 80 degrees C. The amorphous phase contains a relatively homogeneous mixture of segments of both components indicated by the relatively uniform shape of the loss modulus peaks from dymamic-mechanical measurements for all investigated copolymers and blends. ORC crystallization is hindered in blends as indicated by lower melting enthalpies. This {{might be related to}} the high octene content of the amorphous phase at the relevant crystallization temperature as well as geometrical constraints since ORC crystallization occurs in an already semi-crystalline polymer.

40|$|Block {{copolymers}} forming glassy spheres in {{the matrix}} of rubbery chains can exhibit elastomeric properties. It {{is well known}} that the spherical microdomains are arranged in the body-center cubic (bcc) lattice. However, recently, we have found packing in the face-centered cubic (fcc) lattice, which is easily transformed into the bcc lattice upon uniaxial stretching. In the same time, the packing regularity of the spheres in the bcc lattice was found to be enhanced for samples completely recovered from the stretched state. This reminds us that a cycle of stretching-and-releasing plays an important role from analogy of densification of the packing in granules upon shaking. In the current paper, we quantify the enhancement of packing regularity of spherical microdomains in the bcc lattice upon uniaxial stretching of the same <b>elastomeric</b> triblock <b>copolymer</b> as used in our previous work by conducting small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) measurements using high brilliant synchrotron radiation. Isotropically circular rings of the lattice peaks observed for the unstretched sample turned into deformed ellipsoidal rings upon the uniaxial stretching, with sharpening of the peaks in the direction parallel to the stretching direction and almost disappearing of the peaks in the perpendicular direction.

40|$|Thermoplastic Elastomer Vulcanizates, TPVs, are materials, {{which have}} {{properties}} {{as good or}} even, in some cases, better than those of <b>elastomeric</b> block <b>copolymers.</b> They can be prepared by dynamic vulcanization. This process consists of vulcanizing rubber during its melt-mixing with molten plastic. These materials show conventional elastomers behaviour at low temperatures and the processability of thermoplastics at high temperatures. Since {{they do not need}} to be vulcanised during fabrication into end-use pats, they offer a substantial economic advantage. In addition, these materials can be readily reground and recycled [1]. Among the several conventional conductive loads, the polyaniline possess great prominence. The polyaniline used as an intrinsic conducting polymer is based on its high conductivity, synthesis easiness, and stability to the heat and the air. Another advantage is the low production cost [2]. Mechanicals sensors are device that detect force, deformation and / or acceleration. In these materials, it takes place a decrease of the electric resistance as the force applied perpendicularly in its surface increase [3].

Recent technological advances {{have made it possible}} to reach beyond this limited view. Inspired by biological systems, we seek to develop engineering materials that exhibit multiple functionalities in addition to providing structural integrity. Composites are a natural host for embedding elements that can enhance their non-structural response. The present work is focused on embedding periodic arrays of scattering elements within composites to modify and tune their overall electromagnetic properties. A number of techniques for numerical and analytical modeling of the periodic media are discussed. Based on these methods we have designed and fabricated composites with tuned electromagnetic properties. Examples include fiber- reinforced polymer composites with embedded arrays of straight wires or coils. In both cases, the overall dielectric constant of the medium is reduced and can even be rendered negative within microwave frequencies. The coil medium can exhibit chiral response. Solutions for eliminating this behavior as well as a method for calculation of the bianisotropic material parameters are presented. One can achieve similar response at higher frequencies by reducing the length scale. For example, we show that a polymer film with embedded nano-strips of gold can demonstrate negative dielectric constant in infrared regime. An example of a structural composite is presented for which the magnetic permeability is altered and is turned negative within a microwave band. Finally, a general method for homogenization of the electromagnetic properties of periodic media based on the microstructure is developed. Two independent chapters complete this dissertation.

Toward this goal, two distinct projects were carried out. The first project explored the magneto-dielectric properties and morphology of flexible polymer-nanoparticle composites that possess high permeability (Âµ), high permittivity (Îµ) and minimal dielectric, and magnetic loss (tan Î´Îµ, tan Î´Âµ). The main materials challenges were the synthesis of magnetic nanoparticle fillers displaying high saturation magnetization (Ms), limited coercivity, and their homogeneous dispersion in a polymeric matrix. Nanostructured magnetic fillers including polycrystalline iron core-shell nanoparticles, and constructively assembled superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles were synthesized, and dispersed uniformly in an elastomer matrix to minimize conductive losses. The resulting composites have demonstrated promising permittivity (22. 3), permeability (3), and sustained low dielectric (0. 1), magnetic (0. 4) loss for frequencies below 2 GHz. This study demonstrated nanocomposites with tunable magnetic resonance frequency, {{which can be used}} to develop compact and flexible radio frequency devices with high efficiency. The second project focused on fundamental research regarding methods for the design of highly conductive polymer-nanoparticle composites that can maintain high electrical conductivity under tensile strain exceeding 100 %. We investigated a simple solution spraying method to fabricate stretchable conductors based on <b>elastomeric</b> block <b>copolymer</b> fibers and silver nanoparticles.

The elastomeric phase helps to improve impact strength, and extend its application at low temperature conditions. Polymerization of high impact polypropylene could be achieved by at least two stage processes. First the homo- or random copolymer matrix is produced in bulk or gas phase polymerization, and later on the elastomeric phase of propylene/ethylene copolymer is formed through polymerization in gas phase. Among several commercial process technologies available, Spheripol process (bulk homo- and gas copolymerization) {{is one of the}} most widely used process to produce high impact polypropylene globally. For target oriented product development, detailed knowledge of catalyst kinetics is necessary in order to establish the required operation conditions for the desired polymer characteristics.

Furthermore we examined the thermodynamic behavior of diblock copolymers representing the binary pairs of the ternary system: poly(dimethylsiloxane) /poly(ethylene-statpropylene) /poly(styrene-ran-styrene sulfonic acid), D/EP/SS in lieu of understanding the interaction an be able to predict a desired molecular architecture. SWNTs were noncovalently attached, using a phase inversion method, to the BCPs to serve for electron conductivity. Lastly SS/EP/D triblock copolymers were synthesized to locate their different molecular architecture along the triphase diagram. We employ small angle x-ray scattering, electron microscopy, and rheology to characterize the order-to-disorder transition temperature TODT and lamellar period d of 28 materials with varying molecular weights and sulfonation extents. Research on thermoplastic elastomers focused on creating a replacement for the Styrene-Butadiene-Styrene (SBS) petroleum based BCP {{with the use of a}} vegetable oil, e. g. soybean oil (SBO). We present [...] for the first time [...] two distinct controlled radical polymerization techniques of a vegetable oil. To date, moderate success has been achieved through the application of traditional cationic and free radical polymerization routes to vegetable oils to yield thermoset plastics. The success of the technology on vegetable oils such as soybean oil is surprising, as conventional radical polymerization typically brings the polymerization of triglycerides into thermoset materials, whereas our present research successfully controls the polymerization of triglyceride so that it terminates at a desired molecular weight and block composition and produces thermoplastic polysoybean oil. Different methods of synthesizing <b>elastomeric</b> block <b>copolymers</b> using acrylated epoxidized soybean oil (AESO) and styrene are discussed: i. e. Atom Transfer Radical Polymerization (ATRP) and Reversible Addition-Fragmentation chain Transfer (RAFT). Each technique was able to individually create diblock and triblock copolymers, resulting in polymers that are predominantly non-crosslinked linear or with lightly branched chains. These materials behave as elastomers/rubbers at room temperature but are susceptible to common processing techniques at elevated temperatures, making them suitable for a wide range of applications.
