The flax mat/PLLA facings and balsa core {{can also be}} composted at end of service life. Manufacture is by vacuum bag moulding.

The mechanical properties of the bio-sandwich obtained are compared to those of a traditional glass reinforced polyester balsa sandwich. The flexural strength is 30 % lower, as predicted based on the facing properties. Skin/core adhesion is also measured using debonding tests. Crack propagation occurs at the skin/core interface in the traditional sandwich but within the facing in the bio-sandwich.

40|$|This work {{presents}} {{the design of}} a computer controlled pilot production plant capable of manufacturing hybrid braided/pultruded rod on a continuous basis. The current product design utilizes a high modulus carbon fiber core with a braided over-wrap composed of various materials. Production is accomplished in three phases: core fiber sorting and impregnation, 2 D braiding, and resin curing. On-line <b>impregnation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>core</b> strands is accomplished using a pressure-fed <b>impregnation</b> ring. Deposition <b>of</b> the 2 D braid is performed by a Maypole braider. Curing of the resin is accomplished using a novel two phase method. An induction heater first increases the temperature of steel wires embedded in the rod core. Next three tunnel ovens provide heat flux to the exterior of the rod. A caterpillar-type puller is used to advance the rod through the process. Prior to this work production was accomplished by manually adjusting machinery operating parameters through controls distributed throughout the production facility. This led to inconsistent quality product. The modifications to production equipment and the development of an automation system which allow one to improve. The modifications to production equipment and the development of an automation system which allow to improve product quality are the main topics of this work. The automation system is based on a PC equipped with several data acquisition cards. A global controller calculates machine set points based on product specifications and measured production rate. Cascade controllers are tasked to regulate machine operations about these set points. The rotational speed of the braider head and puller are monitored using incremental encoders and are under set point element and integral control. The resin flow rate is estimated from weight measurement of the resin reservoir. To regulate the resin dispensing process a calibration curve is used as a set point elements while disturbances are rejected using integral control. The curing oven temperatures are monitored using thermocouples. The oven temperatures are regulated using gain scheduled PI controllers. The modification to the production equipment and the development of the automation system allowed for significant improvements in the product quality...|$|R

40|$|Axoplasm and axolemma {{differ in}} their {{chemical}} and physical characteristics. The <b>impregnation</b> <b>of</b> axons is mainly due to a compound which is soluble in hot organic solvents and {{which appears to be}} situated in the axoplasm. Ethylenic linkages and hydroxyl groups play no role in the <b>impregnation</b> <b>of</b> axons. Sulphydryl and carbonyl groups appear to be partly responsible. These groups are situated mainly in the axoplasm, although sulphydryls are present also in the axo-lemma. The <b>impregnation</b> <b>of</b> axolemma depends to a great extent on chemical groups which could not be identified. The fact that solutions of Ag diammine are more suitable for impregnating axons than those of AgNO 3 might be due to one of the following factors: (i) that the reducing groups of the axons are more easily oxidized at high pH levels; (2) that the complex diammine ion might exert a higher oxidizing activity when reacting with some tissue molecules; (3) that the rate of reaction of the reducing groups of the tissue with the Ag diammine ion might be faster than that with the silver ion.

40|$|The main {{research}} {{results of the}} influence of quartz ceramics processing by silicon- and aluminum-containing gel- forming water solutions on its durability and porosity are given. Aqueous-alcoholic solutions based on tetraethoxysilane (TEOS, Si(C 2 H 5 O) 4) with additives of aluminum nitrate are proposed for <b>impregnation</b> <b>of</b> porous quartz ceramics samples. Ceramic samples are being impregnated with solutions at the room temperature for 12 minutes. After impregnation they are being exposed to drying at the room temperature for 24 hours and heat treatment in the electric muffle furnace. The made experiments show that <b>impregnation</b> <b>of</b> quartz ceramics porous samples by gel-forming solutions leads to durability growth of not burned samples by 6 - 7 times even without additional heat treatment. High-temperature heat treatment of previously impregnated ceramic samples leads to decomposition of aluminum nitrate and removal of fossils, and also to hardening of the formed additional bonds between material particles. It considerably improves strength characteristics of quartz ceramics as well. Thus, the possibility of considerable hardening of porous quartz ceramics and stability growth of its strength properties by preliminary <b>impregnation</b> <b>of</b> silicon- and aluminum-bearing gel-forming solutions even without additional heat treatment is experimentally shown.
