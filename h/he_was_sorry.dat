Shortly after the premiere an English critic, R A Streatfeild, remarked on how Verdi succeeded: ...|$|E
500|$|On 30 July 2002, Neil Wilkes from Digital Spy {{reported}} that Taylor had quit Coronation Street after five years. Wilkes revealed that her contract would expire in October that year, but the actress {{had chosen to}} stay with the serial beyond that to give the writers time {{to come up with a}} storyline for her character's departure. Series producer Kieran Roberts added that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>sorry</b> to see Taylor go, but understood her decision to move on. Taylor later explained that she chose to leave because she and the writers struggled to come up with storylines for Toyah. She told the Liverpool Echo's Janet Tansley [...] "I was asked where she would go from there and couldn't think what she could do. If I couldn't see a future for her, I couldn't play her."

"Battle of the Bastards" [...] {{was also}} the last episode for {{recurring}} character Rickon Stark (Art Parkinson), who had appeared since the series premiere episode [...] "Winter Is Coming". In an IGN interview, Parkinson {{said that he was}} tipped off about his character's death: [...] "Whenever I was told that I was coming back for Season 6, before they sent me through the scripts and stuff, they sent me through a ring just to say, 'Listen, so that you don't get a shock whenever you read the scripts, just know that you die this season.

500|$|Not long thereafter, Hishammuddin himself apologised for his brandishing of the keris at {{the three}} {{previous}} UMNO annual general assemblies, saying <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>sorry</b> [...] "if it had affected the non-Malays". He {{refused to comment on}} whether he would repeat the act in the future. His conditional apology was met with heavy criticism from within UMNO; one media outlet described the reaction as such: [...] "The sentiment among many in the party is that the Chinese and Indians betrayed the BN when they voted for Pakatan Rakyat. There is hurt. There is anger. So why should Hishammuddin be too concerned about what non-Malays think of the keris act?" [...] Many felt that the apology itself threatened Malay supremacy. Abdullah welcomed the apology, saying it was brave and [...] "made it clear to the non-Malays the important role the keris had in the Malay community". In response to questions about the diminishing of Malay supremacy post-elections, he said that it was more about parity for the Bumiputra communities, rejecting the notion of political dominance: ...|$|E
500|$|Many {{people within}} Major League Baseball spoke out {{in support of}} Joyce, {{offering}} their sympathies and noting his exceptional reputation. New York Yankees pitcher Mariano Rivera said, [...] "It happened to the best umpire {{we have in our}} game. The best. And a perfect gentleman. ... It's a shame for both of them, for the pitcher and for the umpire. But I'm telling you he is the best baseball has, and a great guy. It's just a shame." [...] Former Chicago Cubs pitcher Milt Pappas said, [...] "I would tell , 'I feel for you. There have been only 20 perfect games in the history of baseball. The umpire situation was the same one I had—they blew it. At least I had the satisfaction of getting the no-hitter. You don't. I feel for you. You pitched a tremendous game. At least you have the satisfaction of the umpire saying <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>sorry.</b> But that doesn't help your situation as far as a perfect game." [...] Pappas' own bid for a perfect game on September 2, 1972, was spoiled when umpire Bruce Froemming called a borderline 3-and-2 pitch to 27th-batter Larry Stahl a ball, issuing a walk to the pinch-hitter. Former Yankees pitcher Don Larsen—who threw the fourth perfect game of the modern era and the only one in World Series history on October 8, 1956—said, [...] "I feel sorry for the umpire, and I just feel real badly for the kid.

John raised his hands, said <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>sorry.</b> It was very quiet.
