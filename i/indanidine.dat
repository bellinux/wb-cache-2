40|$|Nifedipine {{was tested}} against pressor {{responses}} in the pithed rat to ten agonists with varying selectivity for alpha 1 - and alpha 2 -adrenoceptors, injected as a bolus or infused intravenously: i. e. amidephrine, azepexole, cirazoline, <b>indanidine,</b> M 7, methoxamine, noradrenaline (NA), oxymetazoline, phenylephrine and xylazine. Nifedipine, administered before the agonists, inhibited responses initiated by all agonists, usually for both the bolus and infusion responses. With a bolus, blockade was significantly greater against the more prolonged, secondary components of the pressor responses. This demonstrates that calcium-entry occurs during the secondary component of the alpha-adrenoceptor-mediated response and can be initiated by either alpha 1 - or alpha 2 -adrenoceptor subtypes. The time courses of responses to infusion varied. Selective alpha 1 -adrenoceptor agonists, {{with the exception of}} <b>indanidine,</b> did not produce a stable pressor response during the 20 min infusion time but alpha 2 -adrenoceptor agonists did. Nifedipine reduced responses to infusion with no preference for alpha 1 - or alpha 2 -agonists. Phenylephrine and NA produced pressor responses which reached a peak and then declined during the remainder of the infusion. The levels of NA in arterial and venous plasma were measured by h. p. l. c. during the infusion of NA. Arterial NA levels rose throughout the infusion whereas venous levels remained relatively unaffected. The absolute levels of plasma NA suggest that a large proportion of intravenously administered NA is removed in the pulmonary circulation and the remainder is removed in the systemic circulation with negligible recirculation. The consequences of these results, for assessment of the mechanisms of action of adrenoceptor agonists and calcium entry blockers, are discussed...|$|E

40|$|We {{compared}} the pharmacological {{properties of the}} alpha 2 -adrenergic radioligand [3 H]idazoxan with those of [3 H]rauwolscine in rat and [3 H]yohimbine in human renal cortical membranes. The density of "specific" [3 H]idazoxan binding sites (defined by 100 microM tolazoline) was {{twice as high as}} that of [3 H]rauwolscine in rat kidney and four times as high as that of [3 H]yohimbine in human kidney. A variety of structurally different drugs fully competed for specific [3 H]rauwolscine and [3 H]yohimbine binding, with affinities appropriate for the interaction with alpha 2 -adrenergic receptors. Specific [3 H]idazoxan binding, however, was only partially competed for by the catecholamines epinephrine and norepinephrine in both tissues. Thus, [3 H]idazoxan labels both alpha 2 -adrenergic receptors and a nonadrenergic site. Clonidine, B-HT 920, moxonidine, phentolamine, prazosin, yohimbine, dopamine, and serotonin also could not compete for this site. However, UK 14, 304, guanabenz, <b>indanidine,</b> tolazoline, oxymetazoline, and SK&F 104, 078 competed for the additional [3 H]idazoxan sites with affinities similar to those at alpha 2 -adrenergic receptors. [3 H]idazoxan binding substantially in excess of [3 H]rauwolscine or [3 H]yohimbine binding was also found in human platelets, myometrium, and erythroleukemia (HEL) cells but not in three cell lines lacking alpha 2 -receptors (MDCK, BC 3 H 1, and Jurkat cells). Although we have been unsuccessful thus far in defining the precise nature of the additional [3 H]idazoxan binding sites, we hypothesize that these sites may be closely affiliated with alpha 2 -adrenergic receptors but clearly distinct from the catecholamine binding site of the receptor. The results indicate that care must be taken in the use of [3 H]idazoxan or drugs that are recognized at its nonadrenergic site when studying alpha 2 -adrenergic effects and receptor subtype...|$|E
