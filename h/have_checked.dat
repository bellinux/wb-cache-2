5|$|Sejanus's {{position}} {{was not quite}} that of successor; he had requested marriage in AD25 to Tiberius's niece, Livilla, though under pressure quickly withdrew the request. While Sejanus's Praetorians controlled the imperial post, and therefore the information that Tiberius received from Rome and the information Rome received from Tiberius, the presence of Livia seems to <b>have</b> <b>checked</b> his overt power for a time. Her death in AD29 changed all that.|$|E

The Belgian Army {{was holding the}} German Fourteenth Army on the KW-line, along with the French 7th and British armies.

5|$|Despite the {{withdrawal}} of Tiberius from Rome's political scene, the presence of Livia seems to <b>have</b> <b>checked</b> Sejanus' overt power for a time. According to Tacitus, her death in AD 29 changed all that. Sejanus {{began a series of}} purge trials of senators and wealthy equestrians in the city, removing those capable of opposing his power as well as extending the imperial (and his own) treasury. Networks of spies and informers brought the victims to trial with false accusations of treason, and many chose suicide over the disgrace of being condemned and executed. Among those who perished were Gaius Asinius Gallus, a prominent senator and opponent of Tiberius who was linked to Agrippina's faction. Agrippina and two of her sons, Nero and Drusus were arrested and exiled in AD 30, and later starved to death in suspicious circumstances. Only Caligula, the last remaining son of Germanicus, managed to survive the purges of Sejanus, by moving to Capri with Tiberius in AD 31.|$|E

25|$|The {{system was}} finally {{identified}} for replacement following an accident at Kensal Green, when a main line train {{ran into the}} back of Bakerloo Line train. The driver had apparently mistaken the calling on aspect for a normal yellow aspect (the signal was temporarily operating on a maximum yellow due to track side work). The indications were that the driver was distracted as his pay slip and its envelope were recovered from the wreckage – but this was never proved as the cause. It was also suggested that the driver may not even <b>have</b> <b>checked</b> the indications having observed the fall of the train stop. The entire line was resignalled to the standard colour light system in 1988.|$|E

25|$|John Willis-Bund {{states that}} the battle of Camp Hill was {{remarkable}} {{from the fact that}} an armed mob—they were nothing more—twice repulsed assaults of the best troops in the Royalist army, who attacked them in overwhelming numbers.

The Parliamentarians were delighted, and they had reason to be. Captain Greaves, probably a local man, {{a member of the family}} that lived at King's Norton, who commanded the Parliament troops, might well be proud of his men's achievement.|$|E
25|$|When teams start a leg, {{arrive at}} Route Markers, or {{complete}} certain tasks, they normally receive a letter-sized tear-away envelope that contains their next clue inside a vertical-fold folder. The clues themselves are typically printed on a vertical strip of paper, although additional information is often provided inside the clue folder. After retrieving the clue, teams open {{the envelope and}} read aloud the instructions given on the clue sheet and then follow those instructions. Teams are generally required to collect each clue during each leg and keep that information with them until they reach the next Pit Stop, surrendering them once they <b>have</b> <b>checked</b> in. Teams may not take an additional clue from the clue box should they lose their first one, otherwise they are assessed a penalty. Teams are not directly penalized for misplacing their clue but will lose time either searching for it or trying to learn from other teams of where to go next.|$|E
25|$|According to the woman, {{another car}} pulled over {{and tried to}} help Bermúdez Zacarías by telling a nearby {{security}} officer to call the police. The eyewitness then made a U-turn and followed the alleged assassins in her car. Tho two men went into hiding in an abandoned lot a few blocks away. She noticed that the lot was gated, {{and returned to the}} crime scene to see if any police officers had arrived. When the first policemen arrived, she reportedly told them that she saw two men walk into an abandoned lot. A third policemen went to inspect the lot, but came back to the murder scene after not seeing anything suspicious. The eyewitness complained to the press that the policemen were slow to act and may not <b>have</b> <b>checked</b> the abandoned lot thoroughly since she said there were several large bushes where the two men may have been hiding. A few days after her confession, the eyewitness stated that she was harassed by people who were presumably armed outside her home and in a vehicle.|$|E

25|$|Researchers <b>have</b> <b>checked</b> the BOLD signal {{against both}} signals from {{implanted}} electrodes (mostly in monkeys) and signals of field potentials (that is the electric or magnetic field from the brain's activity, measured outside the skull) from EEG and MEG. The local field potential, which includes both post-neuron-synaptic activity and internal neuron processing, better predicts the BOLD signal. So the BOLD contrast reflects mainly the inputs to a neuron and the neuron's integrative processing within its body, and less the output firing of neurons. In humans, electrodes can be implanted only {{in patients who}} need surgery as treatment, but evidence suggests a similar relationship {{at least for the}} auditory cortex and the primary visual cortex. Activation locations detected by BOLD fMRI in cortical areas (brain surface regions) are known to tally with CBF-based functional maps from PET scans. Some regions just a few millimeters in size, such as the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of the thalamus, which relays visual inputs from the retina to the visual cortex, have been shown to generate the BOLD signal correctly when presented with visual input. Nearby regions such as the pulvinar nucleus were not stimulated for this task, indicating millimeter resolution for the spatial extent of the BOLD response, at least in thalamic nuclei. In the rat brain, single-whisker touch has been shown to elicit BOLD signals from the somatosensory cortex.|$|E
25|$|In Game 2, it was James Shields who got {{the start}} against C. J. Wilson. With runners on the corners in the 3rd inning, Shields went to 1st base for a pickoff attempt, but the throw over was errant, {{allowing}} the runner to score from 3rd base. Ian Kinsler launched a solo homer to left in the 4th, putting Texas up 2–0. In the 5th, Shields {{was removed from the}} game with two on and one out, being replaced by Chad Qualls to face Michael Young. With a 2–2 count, Young checked his swing on a pitch that was called a ball. The Rays appealed to first base umpire Jerry Meals, but Meals ruled that Young held up in time, drawing the ire of the Rays dugout. Replays showed that Young may not <b>have</b> <b>checked</b> in time, and had the ruling been made that he did not, it would have resulted in a strikeout. Instead, Young went deep to center on the very next pitch for a 3-run home run, putting the Rangers up 5–0. Rays manager Joe Maddon went out to the mound to talk to his pitcher after the home run, but began arguing with home plate umpire Jim Wolf about the check swing, which led to Wolf ejecting Maddon from the game. Texas added another run in the 6th inning, and held the Rays scoreless, winning 6–0 and taking a commanding 2–0 lead in the best-of-five series.|$|E
