Dans ce but, nous construisons un modèle spatial de choix fiscal communal qui tient compte des choix fiscaux des communes concurrentes en matière de taxe professionnelle. Plus particulièrement, nous testons l’hypothèse de l’existence d’interactions fiscales au sein de différents groupements intercommunaux et nous en mesurons la forme et l’intensité à l’aide des techniques d’économétrie spatiale. Nous relions ensuite ces mesures d’intensité aux caractéristiques de l’aire étudiée, en particulier à son statut dans le zonage <b>en</b> <b>aires</b> <b>urbaines</b> et <b>en</b> <b>aires</b> d’emploi de l’espace rural (ZAU-ER). Nous concluons à l’existence d’interactions fiscales entre les communes appartenant à l’espace à dominante urbaine. En revanche, l’hypothèse d’interactions fiscales horizontales n’est pas vérifiée dans les communes appartenant à l’espace à dominante rurale. The aim of {{this paper}} is to test the hypothesis that tax competition intensity is stronger in urban area than in rural area. We use the theoretical foundations of tax competition literature where horizontal strategic interactions are due to tax base mobility between local jurisdictions belonging to the same level of government. When tax base is mobile, an action chosen by a jurisdiction affects the budget constraint of another jurisdiction, leading to strategic interactions in local fiscal choices. As a consequence, tax rates in one jurisdiction depend on tax rates in the neighbouring jurisdictions. We then build a spatial model of local tax choices which takes into account the fiscal decisions made by concurrent jurisdictions as well as the local socio-economic characteristics such as tax base and population density in the explanatory variables. More precisely, we test the existence of horizontal fiscal interactions inside some different groups of jurisdictions by estimating the slope of each reaction function. We measure the sign and the intensity of the spatial lag parameter using spatial econometrics. We then rely these estimates to the features of each group of jurisdictions and more particularly to its classification in urban areas and in rural areas. We observe that jurisdictions belonging to urban areas tend to mimic each other whereas those who belong to rural areas does not take into account the neighbouring tax choices when they set their local business tax. Rural jurisdictions set their local business tax only by looking at their own socio-economic features...|$|R
5000|$|At the 1999 census, {{there were}} 5,089,179 persons {{employed}} in the Paris <b>aire</b> <b>urbaine</b> (or [...] "metropolitan area"). At the same 1999 census, 4,949,306 {{people living in the}} Paris <b>aire</b> <b>urbaine</b> had a job. The almost 140,000 people difference between these two figures comes from an outflow of about 60,000 people living inside the <b>aire</b> <b>urbaine</b> who work outside of it, and an inflow of about 200,000 people living outside of the <b>aire</b> <b>urbaine</b> who come to work inside it every day. Thus, out of the 5,089,179 people {{employed in the}} Paris <b>aire</b> <b>urbaine</b> in 1999, only about 200,000 people (3.9% of the total) lived outside of it, which is not surprising since the boundaries of the <b>aires</b> <b>urbaines</b> are based on commuting patterns.|$|R

5000|$|Reims ( [...] ; also spelled Rheims; [...] ), {{a city in}} the Grand Est {{region of}} France, lies 129 km east-northeast of Paris.

5000|$|The <b>aire</b> <b>urbaine</b> {{is based}} on France's {{nationwide}} map of interlocking administrative commune municipalities: when a commune has over 2000 inhabitants and contains a centre of dense construction (buildings spaced no more than 200 metres apart), it is combined with other adjoining communes fulfilling the same criteria to become a single unité urbaine ("urban unit"); if an urban unit offers over 10,000 jobs and its economical development is enough to draw more than 40% {{of the population of}} a nearby municipalities (and other municipalities drawn to these in the same way) as commuters, it becomes a pôle urbain ("urban cluster") and the [...] "commuter municipalities" [...] become its couronne ("rim"), but this only on the condition that the urban unit itself is not part of another urban cluster's rim. The <b>aire</b> <b>urbaine</b> is an urban cluster and its rim combined, or a statistical area describing a central urban core and its economic influence on surrounding municipalities.|$|R
50|$|Bankenviertel (banking district) is {{the name}} of the central {{business}} district in Frankfurt, Germany.

50|$|The Paris {{metropolitan}} area expands at each population census {{due to the}} rapid population growth in the Paris area. New communes (municipalities) surrounding Paris are included when they meet the 40% commuter threshold required. At the 1968 census, the earliest date for which population figures were retrospectively computed for French <b>aire</b> <b>urbaines,</b> the Paris {{metropolitan area}} had 8,368,459 inhabitants {{in an area that}} only encompassed central Île-de-France.|$|R
50|$|If {{an urban}} unit offers 5,000~10,000 jobs (thus {{becoming}} an 'average' urban cluster) yet manages to draw commuters numbering more than 40% {{of the population}} of nearby municipalities (and other municipalities drawn to these in the same way), the whole qualifies as an 'average' aire urbaine; a 'small' <b>aire</b> <b>urbaine</b> fulfils the same commuter criteria but is centred on an urban unit (or 'small' urban cluster) offering 1,500~5,000 jobs.|$|R
50|$|Well {{into the}} middle of the 20th century, the {{majority}} of jobs in the <b>aire</b> <b>urbaine</b> were concentrated in the city of Paris proper. However, after the Second World War the economic activity relocated to the suburbs, and the city has been steadily losing jobs to the benefit of the suburbs, in particular the Hauts-de-Seine (92) département, home of the new La Défense business district, to the west of the city proper. Today, the city of Paris is not properly speaking the economic centre of the <b>aire</b> <b>urbaine</b> since most of the offices are in fact located in the western half of the city proper and in the central portion of the Hauts-de-Seine département, forming a triangle between the Opéra, La Défense and the Val de Seine district. Hauts-de-Seine has become a sort of extension of central Paris, with 873,775 persons employed there in the end of 2005, more than half as many as in the city of Paris proper (1,653,551 persons employed in the city of Paris in the end of 2005).|$|R
25|$|Some Parisian {{universities}} {{had anticipated}} the decree of the Ministry of National Education and had relocated {{part of their}} activities in Paris <b>aire</b> <b>urbaine.</b> In fact, experiencing a significant increase of their numbers, they begin to open new locations to alleviate their main campuses. Thus, an antenna of the Pierre and Marie Curie University is created in Versailles in 1987. Dedicated to Sciences, it joined in the Yvelines the law annex of Nanterre established two years earlier at Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines.|$|R
50|$|In France, a pôle urbain is a {{statistical}} area defined by INSEE (France's national statistics office) for {{the measurement of}} contiguously built-up areas. It shares the same definition as a unité urbaine ("urban area"), but differing {{in that it is}} not contained within the couronne périurbaine (commuter belt) of any other pôle urbain; in other words, a pôle urbain is an urban area that is a core of demographic growth. Please see unité <b>urbaine</b> and <b>aire</b> <b>urbaine</b> for more detail.|$|R
5000|$|Created {{and used}} from 1996 by France's {{national}} INSEE statistical bureau to match international demographic standards, the <b>aire</b> <b>urbaine</b> (literally: 'urban area') is a statistical unit {{that describes the}} suburban development around centres of urban growth: it is composed of a couronne périurbaine (literally: 'peri-urban crown'; INSEE translation: 'rim') [...] ) surrounding a more densely built and densely populated pôle urbain (or [...] "urban cluster"), which is a single or group of densely-built unité urbaine (literal and INSEE translation: [...] "urban unit") communes.|$|R
50|$|During the 1960s and 1970s, the French {{government}} created several villes nouvelles ("new towns") on {{the outer}} ring of the Paris suburbs in order to multi-polarise {{the economy of the}} city. Economically speaking, those villes nouvelles have been a relative success since many companies are still moving into those areas today. However, they didn't completely fulfil their role of multi-polarisation: economic activities still remain in a large measure concentrated in the central core (City of Paris and Hauts-de-Seine) of the <b>aire</b> <b>urbaine,</b> as the above employment figures show.|$|R
