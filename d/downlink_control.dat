30|$|The {{proposed}} theoretical {{security system}} {{is based on}} an enhancement of the resiliency against radio jamming of the PBCH by means of a spread spectrum transmission. This can be combined with scrambling of the PRB allocation of UL control channels and a distributed encryption scheme for <b>downlink</b> <b>control</b> broadcast messages. On one hand, the system protects its most vulnerable resources, <b>downlink</b> <b>control</b> channels, which are the target of DoS attacks[6]. On the other hand, MIB and SIB messages are protected so an attacker cannot learn any information on the PRB allocation for the other control channels, which are now randomly allocated in time and frequency. Only with the information encoded and encrypted in the MIB and SIB messages an attacker would be able to aim to the UL control channels with a jamming charge. Full application of such security solutions render a jamming attack to be only as effective as basic barrage jamming. Note that in jamming mitigation studies, the goal is precisely to force any sophisticated jamming attack to be just as efficient as standard jamming[17].|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This paper investigates several {{schemes to}} improve the {{performance}} of the enhanced Physical <b>Downlink</b> <b>Control</b> Channel (ePDCCH) in Long Term Evolution Advanced (LTEA) networks by means of Intercell Interference Coordination (ICIC). Given the flexible design of the ePDCCH, based on frequency division multiplexing, static ICIC techniques such as Soft Frequency Reuse (SFR) can be applied and hence, performance degradations at cell edges can be avoided in contrast to its antecesor, the Physical <b>Downlink</b> <b>Control</b> Channel (PDCCH) in LTE. The study is focused in realistic/irregular deployments, where the amount of intercell interference received at different cells varies considerably making very difficult the task of homogenizing {{the performance of the}} ePDCCH over the coverage area. In order to address this problem, the proposed multiobjective scheme adjusts the configuration of SFR at cell level. The problem formulation includes several performance metrics including spectral efficiency, cell edge performance, consumption/ amount of control resources and energy requirements. The results reveal that the proposed scheme is able to (1) reduce the average consumption of control resources and, (2) minimize energy needs without penalizing the capacity of data channels.
