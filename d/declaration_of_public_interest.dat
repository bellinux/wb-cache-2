50|$|In the 1980s, {{high levels}} of road traffic near Millau in the Tarn valley were causing congestion, {{especially}} in the summer due to holiday traffic on the route from Paris to Spain. A method of bypassing Millau had long been considered, not only to ease the flow and reduce journey times for long distance traffic, but also {{to improve the quality}} of access to Millau for its local businesses and residents. One of the solutions considered was the construction of a road bridge to span the river and gorge valley. The first plans for a bridge were discussed in 1987 by CETE, and by October 1991 the decision was made to build a high crossing of the River Tarn by a structure of around 2500 m in length. During 1993-1994, the government consulted with seven architects and eight structural engineers. During 1995-1996, a second definition study was made by five associated architect groups and structural engineers. In January 1995, the government issued a <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> to solicit design approaches for a competition.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{addresses}} the notion <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> in spatial planning, particularly the redefinition <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> {{within the context}} of neoliberal urban politics and planning. It tries to demonstrate that instruments of neoliberal urban planning change and reduce the role <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>interest.</b> As for the societies that have experienced the so called post-socialist societal transformation, the paper presents the argument that there are strong contradictions between the unitaryconcept <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> embodied in statutary rules and the appearance of new urban actors and urban developers...|$|R
40|$|This Article {{examines}} the use <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> factors in merger analysis. We {{begin with a}} review of the use of such factors in jurisdictions around the world and then focus on the U. S. Supreme Court’s rejection <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> factors in the Philadelphia National Bank case and on South Africa’s thoughtful consideration <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> factors in its analysis of Wal-Mart’s acquisition of Massmart, a South African retailer. Although we do not advocate a ready embrace <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> considerations, we do think that the Wal-Mart/Massmart decision provides insight into how jurisdictions that consider <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> factors might usefully do so. Based on the lessons learned from these two cases, we conclude with a discussion of the appropriate norms that jurisdictions should follow when taking account <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> in merger enforcement, with particular emphasis on clear articulation <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> goals, transparency <b>of</b> process, and quantification of costs and benefits...|$|R

40|$|As {{a set of}} {{economic}} activities, tourism trades {{on the character of}} special places. Conflict can emerge where local residents perceive that tourism development proposals challenge the special qualities of place, and where place meaning and attachments are compromised. A key function of government in mediating conflict is to protect <b>public</b> <b>interests,</b> yet explicit consideration <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> in tourism development conflict is unusual. This paper argues for a reinvigoration <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> in the mediation of tourism development conflicts. It explores the concept <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> and how governments interpret and give meaning to it in development debates. In a case study of a cruise ship terminal proposal on the Gold Coast, Australia, the state adopted a neoliberal interpretation <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> wherein increased global competitiveness of the destination was the overriding common good pursued. Local and diverse interests were marginalised in the debate. The paper concludes that in order to reinvigorate <b>public</b> <b>interest,</b> a <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> evaluation framework for tourism development is needed...|$|R

There have been significant decreases in federal and private funding <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> organizations, sweeping changes in the composition of the federal judiciary, and a decline in the matriculation <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> lawyers due to the increasing salary gap between the private and public sector. Together these factors raise serious questions about the future effectiveness of the traditional model <b>of</b> the full-time <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> litigator and call for the development of alternative models <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>interest</b> lawyering suited to the financial, judicial, and personnel constraints of current practice...|$|R
