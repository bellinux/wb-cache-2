5|$|Large {{portions}} of White Zombie were {{shot on the}} Universal Studios lot, borrowing many props and scenery from other horror films of the era. White Zombie opened in New York to negative reception, with reviewers criticizing the film's over-the-top story and weak acting performances. While the film made a substantial financial profit as an independent feature, <b>it</b> <b>proved</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> less popular than other horror films of the time.|$|E
5|$|Materials for {{building}} the Shrine were sourced from within Australia: the chosen building stone was granodiorite quarried from Tynong; the internal walls use sandstone from Redesdale; {{and the black}} marble columns used stone from Buchan. This raised some concerns when redeveloping the Shrine, as the Tynong quarry {{was no longer in}} use, and <b>it</b> <b>proved</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> prohibitively expensive to reopen the site. Fortunately another quarry in the area was available and was able to provide the necessary stone.|$|E
5|$|On 26 July 2009, Shearer {{played and}} {{scored in the}} Sir Bobby Robson Trophy match, a charity match held at St James' Park in tribute of Bobby Robson and in aid of his cancer charity the Sir Bobby Robson Foundation. <b>It</b> <b>proved</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> Robson's last public appearance, as he died five days later. On 15 October 2009, Shearer became the new patron of the Sir Bobby Robson Foundation.|$|E

5|$|Siti Akbari {{was first}} {{published}} in four volumes in 1884. <b>It</b> <b>proved</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> Lie's most popular work, and received the most reprints out of any of his publications. The first reprinting was in 1913 by Hoa Siang In Kiok, and the second was in 1922 by Kho Tjeng Bie. Both of these new printings consisted of a single volume, and, according to Tio, contained numerous inaccuracies.|$|E
5|$|The {{entrance}} of William Bullitt into Louise Bryant's life confounds the intertwined {{stories of the}} grief-stricken war widow, the radical heroine, and the champion of the oppressed. The marriage is a puzzle, both biographically and historically. Biographically, <b>it</b> <b>proved</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a disaster, in contrast to Bryant's earlier romantic choices, which had been smart and fulfilling.|$|E
5|$|After {{his release}} from Bradford, Brandon spent {{a period of time}} {{training}} with Scottish-side Dundee United, although that was because he was visiting his friend and former teammate Danny Cadamarteri and would not be offered a contract, before he was offered a trial with Port Vale in July 2010. <b>It</b> <b>proved</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> an unsuccessful trial, with Brandon spending time away from the game. He later held talks with Conference North side Guiseley, a non-league team from near Bradford. At the start of 2011, he signed for Thai Premier League side BEC Tero Sasana.|$|E

5|$|After the Congress of Vienna, a small Kingdom of Poland, {{known as}} Congress Poland, was recreated, with its king being the Tsar of Russia, Alexander I. Alexander I, an enlightened autocrat, {{decided to use}} Congress Poland as an {{experiment}} to see if Russian autocratic rule could be mixed with an elective legislative system, and rule Poland as a constitutional monarchy. At that time many hoped that this experiment would be a success and pave way to a liberalization in Russia; in the end <b>it</b> <b>proved</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a failure.|$|E
5|$|Although Philip {{considered}} Attalus' {{escape a}} bitter defeat, <b>it</b> <b>proved</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{the turning point}} of the war. Attalus was forced to return to Pergamon, when he learned at Opus that, perhaps {{at the urging of}} Philip, Prusias I, king of Bithynia and related to Philip by marriage, was moving against Pergamon. Sulpicius returned to Aegina. Free from the pressure of the combined Roman and Pergamene fleets, Philip was able to resume the offensive against the Aetolians. He captured Thronium, followed by the towns of Tithronium and Drymaea north of the Cephisus, controlling all of Epicnemidian Locris, and took back control of Oreus.|$|E
5|$|Although the British Army {{refused to}} co-operate with the producers—and Winston Churchill thought the film would ruin wartime morale—Colonel Blimp confounded critics when <b>it</b> <b>proved</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> an artistic and {{commercial}} success. Powell hoped to reunite Kerr and lead actor Roger Livesey {{in his next}} film, A Canterbury Tale (1944), but her agent had sold her contract to MGM. According to Powell, his affair with Kerr ended when she {{made it clear to}} him that she would accept an offer to go to Hollywood if one were made.|$|E

5|$|Arsenal went on {{to finish}} second in 1925–26, five points behind Chapman's old side Huddersfield Town, as they became the first club in England to win three titles in succession. <b>It</b> <b>proved</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> an early dawn for Arsenal, who {{spent most of the}} rest of the 1920s in mid-table, as Chapman took his time finding the right players to fit his new system, {{outlining}} a five-year plan for success. He retained relatively few players of his predecessor Knighton's era – Bob John, Alf Baker and Jimmy Brain being the exceptions – and instead looked to bring in talent from elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|Coventry were relegated in 1951–52, with Taylor {{having made}} 29 appearances. Coventry {{finished}} {{sixth in the}} Third Division South in 1952–53, with Taylor only appearing eight times. <b>It</b> <b>proved</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> Storey's final season as manager, and Taylor later cited Storer as his managerial mentor, and {{would go on to}} quote Storer numerous times throughout his career. Taylor played 42 games as Coventry posted a 14th-place finish under Jack Fairbrother in 1953–54, then played ten matches as they finished ninth in 1954–55. Taylor decided to leave the club after losing his first team place to future Coventry City Hall of Famer and England international Reg Matthews.|$|E
5|$|Damon hit a {{home run}} to right field in the first at-bat of the game on a 2-1 count to give the Red Sox the lead in the first inning for the fourth {{straight}} game; <b>it</b> <b>proved</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the game-winning run. Ramírez singled in the third inning to give him a hit in 17consecutive postseason games. Doubles by David Ortiz to right and Trot Nixon to center, who narrowly missed a grand slam after swinging on a 3-0 count, scored two more runs for the Red Sox to give them a three-run lead.|$|E

5|$|In 1973, Hepburn {{ventured into}} {{television}} {{for the first}} time, starring in a production of Tennessee Williams' The Glass Menagerie. She had been wary of the medium but <b>it</b> <b>proved</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{one of the main}} television events of the year, scoring high in the Nielsen ratings. Hepburn received an Emmy Award nomination for playing wistful Southern mother Amanda Wingfield, which opened her mind to future work on the small screen. Her next project was the television movie Love Among the Ruins (1975), a London-based Edwardian drama with her friend Laurence Olivier. It received positive reviews and high ratings, and earned Hepburn her only Emmy Award.|$|E
5|$|In June 1838 Barry {{and colleagues}} {{undertook}} {{a tour of}} Britain to locate a supply of stone for the building, eventually choosing Magnesian Limestone from the Anston quarry of the Duke of Leeds. Work started on building the river frontage on 1 January 1839, and Barry's wife laid the foundation stone on 27 April 1840. The stone was badly quarried and handled, and with the polluted atmosphere in London <b>it</b> <b>proved</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> problematic, with {{the first signs of}} deterioration showing in 1849, and extensive renovations required periodically.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s, {{politicians}} on {{both sides}} of the river began to seek funding to build a new road bridge across the river. The rail bridge, while still adequate for rail traffic, <b>it</b> <b>proved</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a challenge for drivers. The western terminus of the bridge featured a curve which was navigated easily by wagons and early automobiles, but was dangerous for semi trucks. Governor Terry Branstad was convinced a new bridge was needed after riding in a railcar to view the underside of the road deck. The new, four-lane Keokuk–Hamilton bridge opened on November 23, 1985, nearly eight months ahead of schedule and under budget.|$|E

5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1891, Sunday turned down a {{baseball}} contract for $3,500 a year to accept a position with the Chicago YMCA at $83 per month. Sunday's job title at the YMCA was Assistant Secretary, yet the position involved {{a great deal of}} ministerial work. <b>It</b> <b>proved</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> good preparation for his later evangelistic career. For three years Sunday visited the sick, prayed with the troubled, counseled the suicidal, and visited saloons to invite patrons to evangelistic meetings.|$|E
5|$|The Albert Bridge is a {{road bridge}} over the River Thames in West London, {{connecting}} Chelsea on the north bank to Battersea on the south bank. Designed and built by Rowland Mason Ordish in 1873 as an Ordish–Lefeuvre system modified cable-stayed bridge, <b>it</b> <b>proved</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> structurally unsound, so between 1884 and 1887 Sir Joseph Bazalgette incorporated some of the design elements of a suspension bridge. In 1973 the Greater London Council added two concrete piers, which transformed the central span into a simple beam bridge. As a result, today the bridge is an unusual hybrid of three different design styles. It is an English Heritage Grade II* listed building.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea for}} Mask of the Lunar Eclipse came to series co-creator Keisuke Kikuchi {{when he first}} saw the Wii hardware. Kikuchi and series co-creator Makoto Shibata {{returned}} as respective producer and director, while Grasshopper Manufacture's Goichi Suda acted as co-director, co-writer and designer. The gameplay concept was making the player literally feel the fear evoked in the game. The addition of further developers to the project enabled the team to reconsider the standard formula, although <b>it</b> <b>proved</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a chaotic experience. As with previous games, the theme songs were sung by Tsuki Amano. When released, it became the best-selling entry in the series to that date, and received mixed to positive from Japanese and Western critics.|$|E
