5|$|The female is mildly {{aggressive}} to her suitors during <b>estrus,</b> {{and will}} often lunge at males, usually {{after a long}} period of being approached and followed. Vocalizations during mating include a whistling sound, most commonly by the female, usually during June and August, coinciding with female <b>estrus.</b> Other vocalizations recorded during <b>estrus</b> include chittering and growling. The testosterone levels of the males are seasonal, with peaks coinciding with female estrogen peaks.|$|E
5|$|Female okapis become {{sexually mature}} at about one-and-a-half years old, while males reach {{maturity}} after two years. Rut in males and <b>estrus</b> in females {{does not depend}} on the season. In captivity, <b>estrus</b> cycles recur every 15 days. The male and the female begin courtship by circling, smelling and licking each other. The male shows his dominance by extending his neck, tossing his head and protruding one leg forward. This is followed by mounting and copulation.|$|E
5|$|Vocalizations of the pygmy slow loris {{include a}} short whistle, mother-infant contact calls, and a {{whistling}} sound produced during <b>estrus.</b>|$|E
5|$|The ram {{uses his}} vomeronasal organ (sometimes called the Jacobson's organ) {{to sense the}} pheromones of ewes and detect {{when they are in}} <b>estrus.</b> The ewe uses her vomeronasal organ for early {{recognition}} of her neonate lamb.|$|E
5|$|When in <b>estrus,</b> the female's scent changes subtly {{and nearby}} males begin pursuit. In addition, a female alerts males {{she is in}} <b>estrus</b> by {{whistling}} through her nose. During mating, the female has the advantage and mating choice. Capybaras mate only in water, and if a female {{does not want to}} mate with a certain male, she either submerges or leaves the water. Dominant males are highly protective of the females, but they usually cannot prevent some of the subordinates from copulating. The larger the group, the harder it is for the male to watch all the females. Dominant males secure significantly more matings than each subordinate, but subordinate males, as a class, are responsible for more matings than each dominant male. The lifespan of the capybara's sperm is longer than that of other rodents.|$|E
5|$|All bovids mate {{at least}} once a year, and smaller species may even mate twice. Mating seasons occur {{typically}} during the rainy months for most bovids. As such, breeding might peak twice in the equatorial regions. The sheep and goats exhibit remarkable seasonality of reproduction, in the determination of which the annual cycle of daily photoperiod plays a pivotal role. Other factors that have a significant influence on this cycle include the temperature of the surroundinga, nutritional status, social interactions, the date of parturition and the lactation period. A study of this phenomenon concluded that goats and sheep are short-day breeders. Mating in most sheep breeds begins in summer or early autumn. Mating in sheep is also affected by melatonin, that advances the onset of the breeding season; and thyroxine, that terminates the breeding season. <b>Estrus</b> lasts for at most a day in bovids, with the exception of bovines and tragelaphines. Except the hartebeest and the topi, all bovids can detect <b>estrus</b> in females by testing the urine using the vomeronasal organ. Once the male is assured that the female is in <b>estrus,</b> he begins courtship displays; these displays vary greatly from the elaborate marches among gregarious species to the fervent licking of female genitalia among solitary species. Females, initially not receptive, ultimately mates with the male which has achieved dominance over others. Receptiveness is expressed by permission for mounting by the male and setting aside the tail by the female. Copulation generally takes a few seconds.|$|E
5|$|Females {{are sexually}} mature at {{two to three}} years of age and males at about two years. Breeding occurs {{throughout}} the year, but it peaks during winter and early spring. In the northern Sahara, breeding peaks at the end of winter and beginning of spring; in the southern Sahara, breeding peaks from September to October and from January to mid-April. Each <b>estrus</b> bout lasts for one or two days.|$|E
5|$|Females in <b>estrus</b> are {{followed}} by males, with copulation initiated by the female. The female will hang from a branch and may vocalise. The male will hold the female and the branch and copulate with her. Urine-marking and vocalising are also used by the female to solicit mating. The male may create a mating plug following copulation.|$|E
5|$|In both equine social systems, excess males {{gather in}} {{bachelor}} groups. These are typically young males {{who are not}} yet ready to establish a harem or territory. With the plains zebra, the males in a bachelor group have strong bonds and have a linear dominance hierarchy. Fights between males usually occur over <b>estrus</b> females and involve biting and kicking.|$|E
5|$|Sea otters are polygynous: {{males have}} {{multiple}} female partners. However, temporary pair-bonding occurs {{for a few}} days between a female in <b>estrus</b> and her mate. Mating takes place in the water and can be rough, the male biting the female on the muzzle– which often leaves scars on the nose– and sometimes holding her head under water.|$|E
5|$|The age {{of first}} {{breeding}} in gray wolves {{depends largely on}} environmental factors: when food is plentiful, or when wolf populations are heavily managed, wolves can rear pups at younger ages {{in order to better}} exploit abundant resources. This is further demonstrated by the fact that captive wolves have been known to breed as soon as they reach 9–10 months, while the youngest recorded breeding wolves in the wild were 2 years old. Females are capable of producing pups every year, with one litter annually being the average. Unlike the coyote, the gray wolf never reaches reproductive senescence. <b>Estrus</b> typically occurs in late winter, with older, multiparous females entering <b>estrus</b> 2–3 weeks earlier than younger females. During pregnancy, female wolves remain in a den located away from the peripheral zone of their territories, where violent encounters with other packs are more likely. Old females usually whelp in the den of their previous litter, while younger females typically den near their birthplace. The gestation period lasts 62–75 days, with pups usually being born in the summer period.|$|E
5|$|Common elands are nomadic and crepuscular. They eat in {{the morning}} and evening, rest in shade when hot and remain in {{sunlight}} when cold. They are commonly found in herds of up to 500, with individual members remaining in the herd anywhere from several hours to several months. Juveniles and mothers tend to form larger herds, while males may separate into smaller groups or wander individually. During <b>estrus,</b> mainly in the rainy season, groups tend to form more regularly. In southern Africa common elands will often associate with herds of zebras, roan antelopes and oryxes.|$|E
5|$|Early grunge concerts were sparsely {{attended}} (many by {{fewer than}} a dozen people) but Sub Pop photographer Charles Peterson's pictures helped create the impression that such concerts were major events. Mudhoney, which was formed by former members of Green River, served as the flagship band of Sub Pop during their entire time with the label and spearheaded the Seattle grunge movement. Other record labels in the Pacific Northwest that helped promote grunge included C/Z Records, <b>Estrus</b> Records, EMpTy Records and PopLlama Records.|$|E
5|$|Golden jackals are monogamous {{and will}} remain with the one partner until death. Female jackals have only one {{breeding}} cycle each year. Breeding occurs from October to March in Israel and from February to March in India, Turkmenistan, Bulgaria, and Transcaucasia, with the mating period lasting up to 26–28 days. Females undergoing their first <b>estrus</b> are often pursued by several males that may quarrel among themselves. Mating results in a copulatory tie that lasts for several minutes, as it does with all other canids. Gestation lasts 63 days, and {{the timing of the}} births coincides with the annual abundance of food.|$|E
5|$|Jaguar females reach sexual {{maturity}} at {{about two years}} of age, and males at three or four. The cat is believed to mate throughout {{the year in the}} wild, although births may increase when prey is plentiful. Research on captive male jaguars supports the year-round mating hypothesis, with no seasonal variation in semen traits and ejaculatory quality; low reproductive success has also been observed in captivity. Female <b>estrus</b> is 6–17 days out of a full 37-day cycle, and females will advertise fertility with urinary scent marks and increased vocalization. Both sexes will range more widely than usual during courtship.|$|E
5|$|Okapis are {{primarily}} diurnal {{but may be}} active {{for a few hours}} in darkness. They are essentially solitary, coming together only to breed. Okapis are herbivores, feeding on tree leaves and buds, grasses, ferns, fruits, and fungi. Rut in males and <b>estrus</b> in females does not depend on the season. In captivity, estrous cycles recur every 15 days. The gestational period is around 440 to 450 days long, following which usually a single calf is born. The juveniles are kept in hiding, and nursing takes place infrequently. Juveniles start taking solid food from three months, and weaning takes place at six months.|$|E
5|$|Reproduction {{is one of}} the {{few times}} the Sunda slow loris {{aggregates}} with conspecifics, as it is largely solitary. One study recorded that the most slow lorises ever seen together was six; this appeared to be a female in <b>estrus</b> and five males following her. This may suggest a more promiscuous mating system, where females mate with more than one male. Despite this, its testis size is small compared with similar sized promsimians, which is indicative of monogamy. In the wild the mating system of the Sunda slow loris is thought to vary between populations.|$|E
5|$|Reproduction {{starts in}} November for Coquerel's giant mouse lemur at Kirindy Forest; the estrous cycle runs {{approximately}} 22days, while <b>estrus</b> lasts {{only a day}} or less. The mating season in this southern population {{is limited to a}} few weeks, whereas the northern giant mouse lemur is thought to breed throughout the year, a trend seen in only two other species of lemur: the aye-aye (Daubentonia madagascariensis) and the red-bellied lemur (Eulemur rubriventer). The northern giant mouse lemur had been observed breeding year-round in captivity if their litter did not survive or was removed, but at the time this population was thought to be Coquerel's giant mouse lemur.|$|E
5|$|Sexual {{maturity}} {{is reached}} {{between the ages}} of 18 and 24 months in females, and can be reached by 17 months in males. It is polyestrous, having many periods of sexual receptivity during a year. In captivity however, there is a clear birth peak between March and May. It has been observed that reproductive patterns of captive prosimians in the northern hemisphere are altered. The <b>estrus</b> cycle lasts 29–45 days, with most copulations occurring on the same day.|$|E
5|$|The female fisher {{begins to}} breed at about {{one year of}} age and her {{reproductive}} cycle is an almost year-long event. Mating takes place in late March to early April. Blastocyst implantation is then delayed for 10 months until mid-February of the following year when active pregnancy begins. After gestating for about 50 days, the female gives birth to one to four kits. The female then enters <b>estrus</b> 7–10 days later and the breeding cycle begins again.|$|E
5|$|The {{laboratory}} {{recorded a}} major {{success in the}} Assisted reproductive technology (ART) of wild animals, when the world's first successful artificial insemination of an in <b>estrus</b> induced spotted deer, by non-surgical intra-vaginal insemination done in the laboratory, led {{to the birth of}} a live fawn on 14March 2006. This achievement was further followed by an artificial insemination (AI) assisted birth of an Indian blackbuck fawn in August 2007. These were the first reports in the world of such successful AI of wild animals.|$|E
5|$|The {{reproductive}} {{cycle of}} the fisher lasts almost a year. Female fishers {{give birth to a}} litter of three or four kits in the spring. They nurse and care for their kits until late summer, when they are old enough to set out on their own. Females enter <b>estrus</b> shortly after giving birth and leave the den to find a mate. Implantation of the blastocyst is delayed until the following spring, when they give birth and the cycle is renewed.|$|E
5|$|There {{are eight}} {{distinct}} call types made by Sunda slow loris adults, {{which can be}} divided into two categories: contact and contact-seeking calls such as whistles and short keckers (a social play and attention-seeking call), and aggressive and defensive calls such as long keckers, screams, snarls and grunts. Because they rely on crypsis to avoid predators, they do not make alarm calls. Infants emits clicks and squeaks when disturbed. During <b>estrus,</b> females make whistle calls when in visual contact with a male. When exploring new environments and during handling, it makes ultrasonic vocalisations out of the human hearing range.|$|E
5|$|Both {{the males}} and females become sexually mature {{by the time they}} are a year-and-a-half old. However, males {{actually}} mate after the age of four to five years. Males and females are most reproductive till the age of 14 and 14–18 years, respectively, with the maximum age of successful lactation in females being 13–14 years. With no fixed breeding season; births may occur at any time of the year. A study at Dvůr Králové Zoo (Czech Republic) showed that 55% of the births occurred between September and December. A rutting male tests the urine of any female he encounters, to which the female responds by urinating. Having located a female in <b>estrus,</b> the male follows her closely, trying to rub his cheek on her rump, head, neck, and chest. He performs gasping movements with his lips. Finally, the male mounts the female, resting his head and neck on her back, in a similar way as other tragelaphines.|$|E
5|$|Except for the aye-aye and the Lac Alaotra gentle lemur, lemurs are {{seasonal}} breeders {{with very}} short mating and birth seasons {{influenced by the}} highly seasonal availability of resources in their environment. Mating seasons usually last {{less than three weeks}} each year, with the female vagina opening up only during a few hours or days of her most receptive time of <b>estrus.</b> These narrow windows for reproduction and resource availability appear to relate to their short gestation periods, rapid maturation, and low basal metabolic rates, as well as the high energy costs of reproduction for females. This may also relate to the relatively high mortality rate among adult females and the higher proportion of adult males in some lemur populations—both unusual traits among primates. In both the aye-aye and Lac Alaotra gentle lemur, birth (parturition) occurs over a six-month period.|$|E
5|$|Lek {{systems are}} known to exist among some populations of walruses. These males cluster around females and try to attract them with {{elaborate}} courtship displays and vocalizations. Lekking may also exist among California sea lions, South American fur seals, New Zealand sea lions and harbor seals. In some species, including elephant seals and grey seals, males will try to lay claim to the desired females and defend them from rivals. Elephant seal males establish dominance hierarchies with the highest ranking males—the alpha males—maintaining harems {{of as many as}} 30–100 females. These males commonly disrupt the copulations of their subordinates while they themselves can mount without inference. They will, however, break off mating to chase off a rival. Grey seal males usually claim a location among a cluster of females whose members may change over time. Male harp seals, crabeater seals and hooded seals follow and defend lactating females in their vicinity—usually one or two at a time,—and wait for them to reach <b>estrus.</b>|$|E
5|$|Male blue {{wildebeest}} become {{sexually mature}} at {{about two years}} of age while females can conceive at sixteen months if adequately nourished. Nevertheless, most females do not start to breed until a year later. The mating season, which lasts for about three weeks, coincides {{with the end of}} the rainy season. This means that the animals are in good condition, having been feeding on highly nutritious new grass growth, and the conception rate is often as high as 95%. The mating season, or rut, typically begins on the night of a full moon, suggesting that the lunar cycle influences breeding. At this time, testosterone production peaks in males, resulting in increased calling and territorial behaviour. The activities of these sexually excited males may also stimulate female to come into <b>estrus.</b>|$|E
5|$|River otters {{typically}} breed from December to April. Copulation lasts from 16–73 {{minutes and}} may occur in water or on land. During the breeding, the male grabs the female {{by the neck}} with his teeth. Copulation is vigorous, and is interrupted by periods of rest. Females may caterwaul during or shortly after mating. Female <b>estrus</b> lasts about a month per year, and true gestation lasts 61–63 days. Because the otters delay implantation for at least eight months, the interval between copulation and parturition can reach 10–12 months. Delayed implantation distinguishes the species from the European otter, which lacks this feature. Young are born between February and April, and parturition lasts three to eight hours.|$|E
5|$|Scent factors {{heavily into}} lemur reproduction. Scent-marking {{activity}} escalates during the mating season. Pheromones may coordinate reproductive timing for females coming into <b>estrus.</b> Mating {{can be either}} monogamous or promiscuous {{for both males and}} females, and mating can include individuals from outside the group. Monogamous lemurs include the red-bellied lemur (Eulemur rubriventer) and the mongoose lemur (E. mongoz), although the mongoose lemur has been observed mating outside of its pair bond. Monogamy is most common among nocturnal species, although some exhibit scramble competition, sexual suppression of subordinates, or competitions between males that avoid direct fighting. In mouse lemurs, males utilize sperm plugs, developed enlarged testes during the mating season, and develop size dimorphism (likely due to the enlarged testes). These indicate a mating system known as scramble competition polygyny, where males cannot defend females or the resources that might attract them.|$|E
5|$|Sheep {{follow a}} similar {{reproductive}} strategy to other herd animals. A group of ewes is generally mated {{by a single}} ram, who has either been chosen by a breeder or (in feral populations) has established dominance through physical contest with other rams. Most sheep are seasonal breeders, although some are able to breed year-round. Ewes generally reach sexual maturity at six to eight months old, and rams generally at four to six months. However, there are exceptions. For example, Finnsheep ewe lambs may reach puberty as early as 3 to 4 months, and Merino ewes sometimes reach puberty at 18 to 20 months. Ewes have <b>estrus</b> cycles about every 17 days, during which they emit a scent and indicate readiness through physical displays towards rams. A minority of rams (8% on average) display a preference for homosexuality and {{a small number of}} the females that were accompanied by a male fetus in utero are freemartins (female animals that are behaviorally masculine and lack functioning ovaries).|$|E
5|$|Shortly before {{mating season}} begins, females exhibit {{swelling}} of the sex skin, which reaches its peak around {{the middle of their}} 14.8 day estrous cycle. Male sexual physiology also undergoes its own change, with testicular volume increasing during mating season, peaking around the time of breeding. Aggression also increases during the mating season, both between members of the same sex and by females towards the male attempting to mate with her. Females have been observed grappling, cuffing, and biting the male during copulation. Either sex may approach the other when the female is in <b>estrus.</b> Initially they may roar-shriek with each other. When a male approaches a female he often lowers his head and squeals, inspecting the female's genitalia by licking or sniffing, scent-marking, and offering a submissive chattering vocalization. When a female approaches a male, she may posture herself for mounting. Mating pairs often copulate many times {{during the course of a}} mating bout.|$|E
5|$|Studies {{have sought}} to find the precise {{function}} of Mups in pheromone communication. Mup proteins {{have been shown to}} promote puberty and accelerate the <b>estrus</b> cycle in female mice, inducing the Vandenbergh and Whitten effects. However, in both cases the Mups had to be presented to the female dissolved in male urine, indicating that the protein requires some urinary context to function. In 2007 Mups normally found in male mouse urine were made in transgenic bacteria, and therefore created devoid of the chemicals they normally bind. These Mups were shown to be sufficient to promote aggressive behaviour in males, {{even in the absence of}} urine. In addition, Mups made in bacteria were found to activate olfactory sensory neurons in the vomeronasal organ (VNO), a subsystem of the nose known to detect pheromones via specific sensory receptors, of mice and rats. Together, this demonstrated that Mup proteins can act as pheromones themselves, independent of their ligands.|$|E
5|$|The {{breeding}} {{season for the}} Central American squirrel monkey is in September. All females come into <b>estrus</b> at virtually the same time. A month or two before the {{breeding season}} begins, males become larger. This is not due to extra muscle, but to altered water balance within the male's body. This is caused by conversion of the male hormone testosterone into estrogen; thus the more testosterone a male produces, the more he grows {{in advance of the}} breeding season. Since males within a group have not been observed fighting over access to females during breeding season, nor attempting to force females to copulate with them, it is believed that female choice determines which males get to breed with females. Females tend to prefer the males that expand the most in advance of breeding season. This may be because the most enlarged males are generally the oldest and the most effective at detecting predators, or it may be a case of runaway intersexual selection.|$|E
5|$|The tammar wallaby has a {{promiscuous}} mating system. It is {{a seasonal}} breeder and births largely occur during late January and early February. During the breeding season, the male's prostate and bulbourethral gland enlarge. However, {{there does not}} appear to be any seasonal difference in the weight of the testes. Around two weeks before the first births, the males will begin sniffing the uro-genital openings and pouches of the females to determine their reproductive status. After giving birth, females enter <b>estrus</b> and allow males to mate with them. However, a male that attempts to mate with an estrous female may face aggression from other males. A male can achieve reproductive success by mate-guarding. During the estrous period, males establish a dominance hierarchy and the higher ranking males will try to prevent subordinates from mating with estrous females. Several males may pursue a single female.|$|E
5|$|Among harem-holding species, {{the adult}} females mate only with their harem stallion, while in other species, mating is more {{promiscuous}} and the males have larger testes for sperm competition. Estrous in female equines lasts 5–10 days; physical signs include frequent urination, flowing muscus, and a swollen, everted labia. In addition, estrous females will stand with their hind legs spread {{and raise their}} tails when {{in the presence of}} a male. Males assess the female's reproductive state with the flehmen response and the female will solicit mating by backing in. Length of gestation varies by species, it is roughly 11 to 13 months, and most mares will come into <b>estrus</b> again within a few days after foaling, depending on conditions. Usually, only a single foal is born, which is capable of running within an hour. Within a few weeks, foals will attempt to graze, but may continue to nurse for 8–13 months. Species in arid habitats, like the Grévy's zebra, have longer nursing intervals and do not drink water until they are three months old.|$|E
5|$|Bobcats {{generally}} begin breeding {{by their}} second summer, though females may start {{as early as}} their first year. Sperm production begins each year by September or October, and the male is fertile into the summer. A dominant male travels with a female and mates with her several times, generally from winter until early spring; this varies by location, but most mating takes place during February and March. The pair may undertake {{a number of different}} behaviors, including bumping, chasing, and ambushing. Other males may be in attendance, but remain uninvolved. Once the male recognizes the female is receptive, he grasps her in the typical felid neck grip and mates with her. The female may later go on to mate with other males, and males generally mate with several females. During courtship, the otherwise silent bobcat may let out loud screams, hisses, or other sounds. Research in Texas has suggested establishing a home range is necessary for breeding; studied animals with no set range had no identified offspring. The female has an estrous cycle of 44 days, with the <b>estrus</b> lasting five to ten days. Bobcats remain reproductively active throughout their lives.|$|E
