5|$|The {{group was}} formed in 1997 by Cain and Pierre, and it took several years to form a stable lineup. The band signed to Epitaph in 2003, which {{released}} the band's debut album, I Am the Movie. Their breakthrough album, Commit This to Memory, arrived in 2005, and their third record, Even If It <b>Kills</b> <b>Me</b> (2007), also achieved commercial success. The band briefly signed to major label Columbia for their fourth album, My Dinosaur Life (2010), and rejoined Epitaph for Go in 2012, after which Thaxton left the group {{and was replaced by}} Claudio Rivera. Their final album Panic Stations was released in 2015. In 2016, the band announced their split and the So Long, Farewell tour, for which Thaxton rejoined the band.|$|E
25|$|My Dinosaur Life is {{the fourth}} studio album by the American rock band Motion City Soundtrack. Produced by Mark Hoppus, the album was {{released}} on January 19, 2010 by Columbia Records. After many years on independent label Epitaph Records, Motion City Soundtrack signed to major label Columbia in 2006, prior {{to the release of}} their third album, Even If It <b>Kills</b> <b>Me</b> (2007). Blink-182 bassist Mark Hoppus returned to produce the album; he had previously worked with the band on their 2005 breakthrough Commit This to Memory.|$|E
500|$|Even If It <b>Kills</b> <b>Me</b> was {{released}} on September 18, 2007 and represented a large leap from the group's last chart performance: it peaked at number 16 on the Billboard 200 and {{number one on the}} magazine's Independent Albums chart. [...] "This Is for Real" [...] became their best-charting single, peaking at number 48 in Australia. Cain later felt that the band placed far too much emphasis at the time on [...] "numbers and trajectory instead of the creative process." [...] The following year saw a rise in profile for the band: they worked out promotional deals with Coca-Cola and Pepsi, their music was licensed in various television shows, movies, and video games, and they toured heavily. The band released an acoustic EP featuring songs from Even if It <b>Kills</b> <b>Me</b> in May 2008. They later released a music video for the acoustic rendition of [...] "Fell in Love Without You". After the release of the EP, the band toured on the Honda Civic Tour with Panic at the Disco and Phantom Planet, and then joined the last weeks of the Warped Tour 2008. In September, they headlined on The Left Handed Forms of Human Endeavor Tour.|$|E

500|$|During {{the first}} year {{following}} the election defeat, Romney generally kept a low profile, with his ordinary daily activities around San Diego being captured via social media glimpses. In December 2012, he joined the board of Marriott International for a third stint as a director. In March 2013, Romney gave a reflective interview on Fox News Sunday, stating, [...] "It <b>kills</b> <b>me</b> not to be there, {{not to be in}} the White House doing what needs to be done". He again expressed regret at the [...] "47 percent" [...] remark, saying [...] "There's no question that hurt and did real damage to my campaign." [...] (He was still echoing both of these sentiments a year later.) [...] Romney began working as executive partner group chairman for Solamere Capital, a private capital firm in Boston owned by his son Tagg. He was also involved in supporting several charitable causes.|$|E
500|$|Commit This to Memory [...] "addresses {{the themes}} of {{substance}} abuse, psychological disorders and failing relationships." [...] For the record, he intended to simplify his lyrics to enhance storytelling and he drew inspiration from Tom Waits, Ben Folds, and John K. Samson's writing styles. In some cases, he chose to write from another individual's point of view, rather than his own. Their next album, Even If It <b>Kills</b> <b>Me,</b> was Pierre's first [...] "written completely sober, after battling drugs and alcohol for years;" [...] consequently, the record is more optimistic and less self-loathing. My Dinosaur Life has lyrics relating to relationships, procrastination, and Pierre's own desire for a life away from his self-destructive behavior. [...] Much of the lyricism on fifth album Go is consumed with death and [...] "the eventual demise of everything." [...] The idea that [...] "nothing lasts forever" [...] {{is one of the}} album’s most important points.|$|E

He also acted as a thug in the comedy film London <b>Kills</b> <b>Me</b> (1991); and made an appearance in the TV film Anglo-Saxon Attitudes (1992), based on the 1956 satirical novel by Angus Wilson. Other TV roles included characters in episodes of [...] (1995) and The New Adventures of Robin Hood (1997). He was subsequently handpicked by English novelist Barbara Taylor Bradford to be the male protagonist of the made-for-television film A Secret Affair (1999), based on her 1996 book. In the film, which gained him a large and enthusiastic female following, he starred as Bill Fitzgerald, a war correspondent who falls in love with and pursues Vanessa Stewart (Janine Turner) in Venice although she is engaged, and who is subsequently kidnapped in a war zone.|$|E

Despite an early attempt by his wife at reconciliation, by that point all Lucan wanted from the {{marriage}} was custody of his children. In an effort to demonstrate that Veronica was unfit to look after them, he began to spy on his family (his car was regularly seen parked in Lower Belgrave Street), later employing private investigators to perform the same task. Lucan also canvassed doctors, who explained {{that his wife had}} not [...] "gone mad", but was suffering from depression and anxiety. Lucan told his friends that nobody would work for Veronica (she sacked the children's long-term nanny, Lillian Jenkins, in December 1972). Of the series of nannies employed in the house, one, 26-year-old Stefanja Sawicka, was told by Veronica that Lucan had hit her with a cane and had, on one occasion, pushed her down the stairs.

Talking about the filming {{and the development of}} the video, Lee said: [...] "There's this one scene with everybody on motorbikes that every time I see it I just crack up. It's the slow-mo scene where I take off the helmet and swoosh my hair and look at the camera ... and it <b>kills</b> <b>me.</b> It's so hilarious, it's ridiculous. [...] It's a really different thing for us to do because it's not performance at all. Everybody was laughing at me the whole time. I was just like, 'Please don't laugh at me.

500|$|The band's follow-up, Even If It <b>Kills</b> <b>Me</b> (2007), was {{recorded}} in New York City with Eli Janney and Adam Schlesinger of Fountains of Wayne, and Ric Ocasek of the Cars. The group, though big fans of his work, were disappointed with Ocasek's role. [...] "He just confused me the whole time," [...] said Pierre later, who noted that {{he was afraid to}} disclose that the experience was a [...] "bum-out." [...] Pierre struggled with writer's block during the sessions and found himself writing lyrics while recording the songs, which he had never done before. The band was also worried their songs would not be catchy enough after their last album was so successful. During this time, Pierre's substance abuse nearly disbanded the group. [...] "I think it's an understatement to say it is tough to be tied to Justin's emotions," [...] Cain later remarked. Following completion of the album, Pierre entered a three-week rehabilitation program for alcohol and drug abuse. The band was apart for a six-week stretch in the summer of 2007, marking their longest break apart in five years. [...] "It might sound cliched, but we all had a chance to do some growing up," [...] said Cain.|$|E

Instrumentation consists of a piano. The song was composed in the key of G major and set in common time signature, and has a moderately slow tempo of 88 beats per minute. Rihanna's vocals span from the low note of G3 to the high note of D5. [...] Jason Lipshutz of Billboard magazine noted that the song's structure was similar to Beyoncé Knowles song [...] "Halo", while Priya Elan for NME wrote that the song was reminiscent of Rihanna's song [...] "Fire Bomb", from her fourth studio album, Rated R (2009). Lipshutz also noted that Rihanna delivered the bridge with [...] "powerhouse" [...] vocals. A reviewer for Flavour Magazine wrote that Rihanna displayed [...] "great vocals" [...] in the lyric [...] "Somebody's gonna miss you... Farewell."

2500|$|Though the {{instrumental}} case {{does not exist}} in many languages, some languages use other cases to denote the means, or instrument, of an action.

[...] Here, [...] "," [...] the dative of [...] "δόλος" [...] ("dolos" [...] - a bait) is used as the instrumental case (the means or instrument here is, obviously, the bait).

However, in the United Kingdom, the album received virtually no attention from professional critics. Ramones Fanzine writer Mark Bannister explained {{that the reason for}} the silent press in the United Kingdom was that the album [...] "didn't sound right without some more of Joey's songs to balance out Dee Dee's. There was no equilibrium." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic gave the album one and a half out of five stars, saying that although it remains similar to Animal Boy in that it features the use of heavy guitars, but asserted that it is [...] "much sharper record" [...] only because it did not overlook the band's [...] "trashy pop roots." [...] He pointed out that their musical style was inconsistent, going on to say that the band could have went about their second decade of music making [...] "more gracefully" [...] but concluded by saying that although it was not as [...] "strong" [...] as 1983's Subterranean Jungle or 1984's Too Tough to Die, it was the last release where the band actually [...] "sounded like they mattered." [...] Music critic Robert Christgau gave the album a [...] "C+" [...] and wrote a shorter review, where he states: [...] "It <b>kills</b> <b>me</b> to say this, but with Richie or whoever on the lam, Dee Dee moonlighting as a punk-rapper, Joey frequenting all-acoustic showcases, and Johnny Johnny, a great band has finally worn down into a day job for night people." ...|$|E
