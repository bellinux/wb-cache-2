40|$|Coronary {{thrombosis}} {{was recognized}} since 19 th century as clinical entity with bad outcomes; only in 1912 {{it was reported}} that acute myocardial infarction had to been distinguished from angina pectoris. First diagnostic test was electrocardiogram, while white blood cells count and erythrocytes sedimentation rate were the only available laboratory tests. Late in the 60 s and 70 s glutammic oxaloacetic and glutamic pyravate transaminase, lactate dehydrogenase and creatine kinase were added to biomarkers pool to provide a diagnosis of myocardial infarction related to myocardial cells injury. Only in 1987 assays for cardiac troponin were developed to assess structural damage of myocardial cells and in 2010 high sensibility troponins first <b>dosage</b> <b>kits</b> became available. It is well known that the population with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is at greater risk for cardiovascular disease and death than the general population. The use and interpretation of high sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs-cTn) assays have been particularly challenging in these patients with the majority having elevated levels at baseline. Aim of this review is to evaluate hs-cTn in patients with CKD for the diagnosis of AMI and for the prognostic signiﬁcance of elevated levels in CKD patients without AMI...|$|E
50|$|Zevalin is {{supplied}} {{as a single}} <b>dosage</b> <b>kit</b> supplied by IDEC Pharmaceuticals Corp. It consists of Ibritumomab covalently conjugated to the metal chelator tiuxetan, which forms a stable complex with indium-111 for imaging and yttrium-90 for therapy.|$|R
30|$|Broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL): rats were euthanized (via exsanguination), and BAL was {{performed}} in right and left lung separately. Total protein content and total and differential cell counts were analyzed, and BAL fluid were stored for inflammatory cytokines (interleukin- 1 β (IL- 1 β), interleukin- 6 (IL- 6), keratinocyte-derived cytokine (KC), macrophage inflammatory protein- 1 α (MIP- 1 α)) <b>dosage</b> by luminex <b>kit</b> (Milliplex® Map Kit, Millipore S.p.A., Vimodrone, Italy), according to manufacturer’s instructions.|$|R
40|$|A {{subset of}} glioblastomas (GBMs) carry gene amplifi-cations on {{chromosomal}} segment 4 q 12. To characterize this amplicon in detail, we analyzed {{a set of}} 100 samples consisting of 65 GBMs, 10 WHO grade III astrocyto-mas, 12 oligodendrogliomas, and 13 glioma cell cul-tures. We applied multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification to determine the gene <b>dosage</b> of PDG-FRA, <b>KIT,</b> and KDR and the flanking genes USP 46, RASL 11 B, LNX 1, CHIC 2, SEC 3 L 1, and IGFBP 7. The amplicon was highly variable in size and copy number and extended over a region of up to 5 Mb. Amplifica-tions on 4 q 12 were observed in 15 % of GBMs and 23 % of GBM cell cultures but not in 22 other gliomas. We analyzed transcription and translation of some genes within this amplicon. Gene amplification generally cor-related with high transcript levels but did not necessarily result in increased protein levels. However, we detected frequent expression of proteins encoded by PDGFRA, KIT, and KDR in GBMs and GBM cell cultures inde-pendent of the amplification status. Future treatment of GBM patients may include drugs targeting multiple kinases that are encoded by genes on chromosomal seg...|$|R
