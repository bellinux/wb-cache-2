Harry Belafonte {{declined}} to play Porgy {{in the late}} 1950s film version, so the role went to Sidney Poitier. Betty Allen, president of The Harlem School of the Arts, admittedly loathed the piece, and Grace Bumbry, who excelled in the 1985 Metropolitan Opera production as Bess, made the often cited statement: I thought it beneath me, I felt I had worked far too hard, that we had come far too far to have to retrogress to 1935. My {{way of dealing with}} it was to see that it was really a piece of Americana, of American history, whether we liked it or not.

500|$|Makeba {{said that}} she did not perform {{political}} music, but music about her personal life in South Africa, which included describing the pain she felt living under apartheid. She once stated [...] "people say <b>I</b> <b>sing</b> politics, but what <b>I</b> <b>sing</b> is not politics, it is the truth", an example of the mixing of personal and political issues for musicians living during apartheid. When she first entered the US, she avoided discussing apartheid explicitly, partly out of concern for her family still in South Africa. Nonetheless, she is known for using her voice to convey the political message of opposition to apartheid, performing widely and frequently for civil rights and anti-apartheid organisations. Even songs that did not carry an explicitly political message were seen as subversive, due to their being banned in South Africa. Makeba saw her music as a tool of activism, saying [...] "In our struggle, songs are not simply entertainment for us. They are the way we communicate." ...|$|E

[...] The singer's first singles, [...] "Video Games" [...] and [...] "Born to Die" [...] were described variously as [...] "quasi-cabaret balladry", [...] "woozy and sometimes soporific soundtrack soul", [...] "pop", and [...] "indie pop".|$|E

There's always one big relationship on a record that <b>I</b> <b>sing</b> about the most. I feel like my big relationship on this album [...] with Evanescence itself, and with the fans.

500|$|There was {{significant}} resistance to this system, {{both within and}} outside South Africa. Opposition outside the country often took the form of boycotts of South Africa. Within the country, resistance ranged from loosely organised groups to tightly knit ones, and from non-violent protests to armed opposition from the African National Congress. Through this entire process, music played a large role in the resistance. Music had been used in South Africa to protest racial segregation before apartheid began in 1948. The ANC had been founded in 1912, and would begin and end its meetings with its anthem [...] "Nkosi Sikelel' iAfrika", an early example of music in the resistance to racial segregation. Another such example was [...] "iLand Act" [...] by R. T. Caluza, which protested the Native Land Act, and was also adopted as an anthem by the ANC. Commentator Michela Vershbow has written that the music of the movement against apartheid and racial segregation [...] "reflected [...] widening gap" [...] between different racial groups and was also an attempt [...] "to communicate across it". Music in South Africa had begun to have explicitly political overtones in the 1930s, as musicians tried to include African elements in their recordings and performances to make political statements. In the 1940s, artists had begun to use music to criticise the state, not directly in response to racial segregation, but as a response to persecution of artists. Artists did not see their music as being directly political: Miriam Makeba would state [...] "people say <b>I</b> <b>sing</b> politics, but what <b>I</b> <b>sing</b> is not politics, it is the truth".|$|E

In fantasy tales, dragons were notorious for stealing children and feeding them to their babies. During {{the first part of}} the song, <b>I</b> <b>sing</b> 'Someone has taken a child.'

500|$|Michael Stipe {{sings in}} what R.E.M. biographer David Buckley {{described}} as [...] "wailing, keening, arching vocal figures". Stipe often harmonizes with Mills in songs; {{in the chorus}} for [...] "Stand", Mills and Stipe alternate singing lyrics, creating a dialogue. Early articles about the band focused on Stipe's singing style (described as [...] "mumbling" [...] by The Washington Post), which often rendered his lyrics indecipherable. Creem writer John Morthland wrote in his review of Murmur, [...] "I still {{have no idea what}} these songs are about, because neither me nor anyone else I know has ever been able to discern R.E.M.'s lyrics." [...] Stipe commented in 1984, [...] "It's just the way <b>I</b> <b>sing.</b> If I tried to control it, it would be pretty false." [...] Producer Joe Boyd convinced Stipe to begin singing more clearly during the recording of Fables of the Reconstruction.|$|E
500|$|Reactions {{to the red}} culture {{movement}} were divided. Bo’s {{revival of}} Mao-era culture and accompanying social welfare programs were popular within certain segments of society, and made Bo popular with both Marxists and neo-leftists. One student quoted in The Washington Post embraced the ethos of the campaign, saying, [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>sing</b> red songs, I find a kind of spirit I never felt when singing modern songs…To surround yourself with material stuff is just a waste of time." [...] A group of retired participants in a red song routine told the Los Angeles Times [...] "We know these songs from our youth. We grew up with revolutionary spirit {{and we want to}} pass that on to our children.” Another noted that he felt compelled to participate in order to express appreciation to the Communist Party for the country’s strong economy.|$|E
