The mode shapes for nine cases of clamped stiffened square plate with varying number and orientations of stiffeners having dst/h equal to 2, i.e., with one x-directional, one x-directional and one y-directional, two x-directional, two x-directional and two y-directional, three x-directional, three x-directional and three y-directional, five x-directional, five x-directional and five y-directional, and ten x-directional and ten y-directional stiffeners are presented in Fig.  13 a–i. The mode shapes of all the above stiffened plates are {{similar to that of}} unstiffened plate, i.e., symmetric (one <b>half</b> <b>sine</b> curve) {{modes of vibration}} along both axes. The effect of stiffeners is not seen on the mode shapes of the above stiffened plates though there is significant enhancement of the fundamental frequency of these plates due to addition of stiffeners (31 – 115 %) in comparison with that of unstiffened plate (Fig.  13 a–i). On the other hand, the mode shapes of the above nine stiffened plates having dst/h equal to 10 show different trend as shown in Fig.  14. It is worth mentioning that the mode shapes of the stiffened plates with one x-directional, one x-directional and one y-directional, two x-directional, two x-directional and two y-directional, three x-directional and three x-directional and three y-directional stiffeners having dst/h equal to 10 show complete different pattern of mode shapes in comparison to that of unstiffened plate and the enhancement of the fundamental frequency varies from 126 to 667 % due to the addition of stiffeners. Thus, the effects of stiffeners are clearly observed on the mode shapes of these plates (Fig.  14 a–f). The plate stiffened with one central stiffener along x-direction produces symmetric mode (one <b>half</b> <b>sine</b> curve) and anti-symmetric mode (two <b>half</b> <b>sine</b> curves) along x- and y-directions, respectively, and increase in fundamental frequency is more than 126 % (Fig.  14 a). Similarly for other cases, different mode shape patterns are produced. However, these plates with higher number of stiffeners, i.e., with five x-directional, five x-directional and five y-directional and ten x-directional and ten y-directional stiffeners having dst/h equal to 10, as shown in Fig.  14 g–i show the same pattern as in case of the unstiffened one and the presence of stiffeners is not visible on the mode shapes of these stiffened plates though there is very significant enhancement in the fundamental frequency (up to 667 %).|$|E
