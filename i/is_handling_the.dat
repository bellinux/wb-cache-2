The survey also monitored instances of corruption in the sub-sector: 15% of urban and 11% of rural respondents reported that they had to pay a bribe, give a gift or do a favour to government officials to get water or sanitation services in the past year.|$|E

While Jackson, Greenlee's father, is searching the mountain for Erica, he makes a statement that [...] "If Erica is dead, then Greenlee is dead to me." [...] When Erica is finally found and taken to PV Hospital, Greenlee stops by to bring Erica flowers, but Jackson stops her before she reaches Erica and tells her to go away.|$|E
2500|$|There {{have been}} a number of studies of lake's {{environment}} and water quality. [...] Oregon State University published studies of the lake environment in 1972 and 1985. [...] In 1992, Rogue Community College began monitoring water quality in the lake. [...] Some of the parameters that are regularly tested include depth, temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, transmissivity, turbidity, Secchi depth, chlorophyll, bacteria, total phosphorus, orthophosphate, [...] alkalinity, and total dissolved solids. [...] In 1996, the United States Geological Survey conducted a high-resolution acoustic survey and drilled sediment cores from the lake. [...] In 2002, Portland State University reported the finding of the volunteer monitors in their Lake Watch program. [...] The monitors found some variation in the water transparency and seasonal patterns of hypolimnetic oxygen depletion. [...] In 2004, the Fremont–Winema National Forest studied the impact of recreational residence permits on the lake environment. [...] The assessment identified the early signs of shoreline erosion. [...] While these studies produced some cautionary finding, taken overall, they indicate that the Lake of the Woods ecosystem <b>is</b> <b>handling</b> <b>the</b> stress of human use relatively well.|$|E

2500|$|In November 2011, Die Antwoord left Interscope Records over {{a dispute}} {{concerning}} their upcoming album and its lead single, [...] "Fok Julle Naaiers". Visser explained that Interscope [...] "kept pushing {{us to be}} more generic" [...] {{in order to make}} more money: [...] "If you try to make songs that other people like, your band will always be shit. You always gotta do what you like. If it connects, it's a miracle, but it happened with Die Antwoord." [...] Die Antwoord formed their own independent label, Zef Recordz, and released their new album Ten$Ion through it. The release was in association with the Good Smile Company (a Japanese company that is also making Die Antwoord toys) and Downtown Records, which <b>is</b> <b>handling</b> <b>the</b> marketing and distribution for the record worldwide. Ten$Ion included three more singles following [...] "Fok Julle Naaiers": [...] "I Fink U Freeky", [...] "Baby's on Fire", and [...] "Fatty Boom Boom". The singles included on Ten$Ion began to bring Die Antwoord more into the global spotlight as they were invited to perform on American talk shows and featured in an Alexander Wang advertisement. However the album was met with average to poor reviews by many critics. Ten$Ion was followed up with a non-album single, [...] "XP€N$IV $H1T".|$|E
2500|$|The Triffids back {{catalogue}} began being reissued in 2006. Graham Lee {{has taken}} on the role of guardian of David McComb's musical legacy. The Domino label in the UK <b>is</b> <b>handling</b> <b>the</b> reissues in Europe, while Liberation Music deals with Australia and New Zealand. An extended version of fan favourite Born Sandy Devotional came first, with staggered release dates in Europe, Australasia and North America between June and July 2006. A joint release of In the Pines and Calenture followed in February 2007. In the Pines was given a full remix by Bruce Callaway, the original engineer, who had been looking after the master tapes for 20 years. The album was also extended with a number of tracks that were recorded during the sessions for In The Pines but held over for inclusion on Calenture because, in David McComb's words, [...] "we have to keep something good for later." [...] (In The Pines was essentially a low-budget 'holiday' album, recorded while the band was still looking for a deal with one of the major labels.) Calenture was extended with B-sides from the same period, and with a second disc of demo recordings for the album. A re-release of the last Triffids album The Black Swan with an extra disc of rarities and demos have, so far, ended the reissue programme.|$|E
