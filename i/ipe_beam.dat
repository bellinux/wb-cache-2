Numerous FEM simulations {{with regard to the}} stability behavior of steel structural elements subjected to bending about the major principal axis were performed. The use of different finite element modeling techniques and their influence on obtained results were presented by the authors. The ultimate state of both perfect and imperfect elements was assessed.

40|$|Almost {{traditionally}} the design load in an intermediate lateral restraint against lateral torsional buckling of beams {{has been taken}} {{as a percentage of}} the maximum value of the factored force in the compression flange. National design codes have suggested values of around 2 %. This has mainly been backed up by theoretical elastic analyses. Inelastic analysis on braced columns have yielded higher bracing forces. To investigate the influence of inelastic behaviour of beams subject to lateral torsional buckling on the forces in a single lateral brace, geometrical and material non-linear analyses including imperfections (GMNIA) were performed on <b>IPE</b> 240 <b>beams</b> with different lengths, support conditions and types of loading. The location of the non-rigid lateral brace is varied along the length of the beam and along the height of the section. The stiffness of the lateral restraints was determined in such a way that the elastic critical moment is 95 % of the elastic critical moment with rigid lateral restraints. This will keep the reduction in buckling load to a maximum of 5 %. It was found that the forces in the restraints can be larger than design forces suggested by building codes...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Authors {{of article}} {{analysed}} influence of variability of yield strength over cross-section of {{hot rolled steel}} member to its load-carrying capacity. In calculation models, the yield strength is usually taken as constant. But yield strength of a steel hot-rolled beam is generally a random quantity. Not only the whole beam but also its parts have slightly different material characteristics. According {{to the results of}} more accurate measurements, the statistical characteristics of the material taken from various cross-section points (e. g. from a web and a flange) are, however, more or less different. This variation is described by one dimensional random field. The load-carrying capacity of the <b>beam</b> <b>IPE</b> 300 under bending moment at its ends with the lateral buckling influence included is analysed, nondimensional slenderness according to EC 3 is λ ̄ = 0. 6. For this relatively low slender beam the influence of the yield strength on the load-carrying capacity is large. Also the influence of all the other imperfections as accurately as possible, the load-carrying capacity was determined by geometrically and materially nonlinear solution of very accurate FEM model by the ANSYS programme...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe analyse {{the problem}} of a simply {{supported}} steel beam subjected to uniformly distributed load, strengthened with a pre-stressed fibre-reinforced polymer (FRP) laminate. According to the assumed application technology, the laminate is first put into tension, then bonded to the beam lower surface, and finally fixed at both its ends by suitable connections. The beam and laminate are modelled according to classical beam theory. The adhesive is modelled as a cohesive interface with a piecewise linear constitutive law defined over three intervals (elastic response, softening response, debonding). The model is described {{by a set of}} differential equations with suitable boundary conditions. An analytical solution to the problem is determined, including explicit expressions for the internal forces and interfacial stresses. For illustration, an <b>IPE</b> 600 steel <b>beam</b> strengthened with a Sika® Carbodur® FRP laminate is considered. First, the elastic limit state load of the unstrengthened beam is determined. Then, the loads corresponding to the elastic limit states in the steel beam, adhesive, and laminate for the strengthened beam are calculated. As a result, the increased elastic limit state load of the strengthened beam is obtained...|$|R
40|$|Adhesive joints {{are ideal}} for {{connecting}} dissimilar materials in optimized structures. Low weight and potential savings in manufacturing costs are major advantages relatedto such joints, but their use is currently limited by uncertainties about the long-termperformance of the joints. A smart material {{with the ability to}} monitor its state ofhealth would be ideal for monitoring of the long-term performance and also for makingimprovements to the joints. This thesis has explored the fatigue behavior of compositemetal joints and how optical fibers can be included in the joints as a method of integratedhealth monitoring. Cracked <b>IPE</b> 100 steel <b>beams</b> were repaired with composite patches. The fatigue lifeof the patch repaired beams was tested in a four point bend test. Optical fibers wereembedded in the adhesive layer of the composite patch and on top of the patch. Anoptical backscatter reflectometer was used to measure the strains in the composite metaljoint during testing. These measurements were compared against finite element analysisand strain gauges. The results were found to coincide well with the finite element analysisand the strain gauges. The optical fibers were proven to detect damage propagation andgrowth versus number of cycles. It was observed that different failure modes propagatingin the composite metal joint could be detected and distinguished by the optical fibers. </p...|$|R
40|$|Carbon fiber-reinforced polymer {{materials}} have become {{popular in the}} construction industry during the last decade for their ability to strengthen and retrofit concrete structures. The recent availability of high-modulus carbon fiber-reinforced polymer strips (HMCFRP) has opened up the possibility of using this material in strengthening steel structures as well. The strips can be used in steel bridge girders and structures that are at risk of corrosion-induced cross-sectional losses, structural deterioration from aging, or changes in function. In this study, a set of bending experiments was performed on three types of steel beams reinforced with HMCFRP. The results were used to enhance a nonlinear finite element model built with ABAQUS software. The accuracy of the mathematical models for HMCFRP, epoxy, and steel profiles was compared with the experimental results, and the ability of HMCFRP to continue carrying load from the steel beams during rupture and postrupture scenarios was observed using numerical analysis. Using these verified finite element models, a parametric analysis was performed on the HMCFRP failure modes and the quantity to be used with <b>IPE</b> profile steel <b>beams.</b> The maximum amount of HMCFRP needed for strengthening was determined, and an upper limit for its use was calculated to avoid any debonding failure of the fiber material...|$|R
40|$|The mine in Renström {{is owned}} by Boliden and was built in 1952. The steel tower in the {{concrete}} tower is now rusting away and Knightec has been commissioned to construct a new steel tower and replace it. In order to do that, new calculations {{has to be done}} on what the steel tower has to hold for, and that is presented in this report. In case of an erasure, the chute not breaking normally, it will rise up too high in the shaft. Then the emergency break will cut of the engine and the chute will wedge around the guides in the shaft, break and stop. In case of an erasure the guide will be affected by normal forces of 401 kN. The forces of friction of 40 kN, when the coefficient of friction is 0. 01, are transferred to the steel tower and will dislocate the horizontal <b>IPE</b> 160 <b>beams</b> upwards at the most 7. 30 mm. Therefore the forces of friction will be transferred to the vertical beams as pressure forces of 40 kN. As this report concludes there’s no risk that the beams will crack based on this design. The normal forces that occur are at the most 401 kN. After this the break profile will deform plastically and thus the normal force will not get bigger. The force of friction which is transferred to the guide is totally depending on the coefficient of friction. Research has provided that the coefficient of friction should be between 0. 09 - 0. 18. After deliberation with material producers and Knightec, a coefficient of friction of 0. 10 has been used, but a comparison both up and down has been made to see the consequences. If the coefficient of friction is too high it can be concluded that the forces on the guide will be very big and the consequences can be that the guide will come apart and the wire can break. If it is like this report shows that the forces of friction are not too big, then the guides will hold and the steel tower will not be significantly affected.
