60|$|Oh, my friends, {{consider}} these words. Think what endless depths of wonder {{there are in}} them. Is it not wonderful enough that God should care for men; should lead them, guide them, feed them, condescend to call himself their shepherd? Wonderful, indeed; so wonderful, that the old prophets would never have found it out but by the inspiration of Almighty God. But what a wider, deeper, nobler, more wonderful blessing, and more blessed wonder, that the shepherd should give his life for the sheep;--that the master should give his life for the servant, the good for the bad, the wise one for the fools, the pure one for the foul, the loving one for the spiteful, the king {{for those who had}} rebelled against him, the Creator for his creatures. That God should give his life for man! Truly, says St. John, 'Herein is love. Not that we loved him: but that he loved us.' Herein, indeed, is love. Herein is the beauty of God, and the glory of God; that he spared nothing, shrank from nothing, that he might save man. Because the sheep were lost, the good shepherd would go forth into the rough and dark places of the earth to seek and to save that which was lost. That was enough. That was a thousand times more than we had a right to expect. Had he done only that he would have been for ever glorious, for ever adorable, for ever worthy of the praises and thanks of heaven and earth, and all that therein is. But that seemed little in the eyes of Jesus, little to the greatness of his divine love. He would understand the weakness of his sheep by being weak himself; understand the sorrows of his sheep, by sorrowing himself; understand the sins of his sheep, by bearing all their sins; the temptations of his sheep, by conquering them himself; and lastly, he would understand and conquer the death of his sheep, by dying himself. Because the sheep must die, he would die too, that in all things, and to the uttermost, he might show himself the good shepherd, who shared all sorrow, danger and misery with his sheep, {{as if they had been}} his children, bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh. In all things he would show himself the good shepherd, and no hireling, who cared for himself and his own wages. If the wolf came, he would face the wolf, and though the wolf killed him, yet would he kill the wolf, that by his death he might destroy death, and him who had the power of death, that is, the devil. He would go where the sheep went. He would enter into the sheepfold by the same gate as they did, and not climb over into the fold some other way, like a thief and a robber. He would lead them into the fold by the same gate. They had to go into God's <b>fold</b> <b>through</b> the gate of death; and therefore he would go in through it also, and die with his sheep; that he might claim the gate of death for his own, and declare that it did not belong to the devil, but to him and his heavenly Father; and then having led his sheep in through the gate of death, he would lead them out again by the gate of resurrection, that they might find pasture in the redeemed land of everlasting life, where can enter neither devil, nor wolf, nor robber, evil spirit, evil man, or evil thing. This, and more than this, he would do in the greatness of his love. He would become in all things like his sheep, that he might show himself the good shepherd. Because they died, he would die; that so, because he rose, they might rise also.|$|E

50|$|For Rabbinic Judaism, {{the laws}} {{governing}} conversion (gerut) {{are based on}} codes of law and texts, including discussions in the Talmud, through the Shulkhan Arukh and subsequent interpretations.

These rules are held as authoritative by Orthodox Judaism and Conservative Judaism. Jewish law is generally interpreted as somewhat discouraging proselytizing, and religious gerut is also somewhat discouraged. In the past, rabbis often rejected potential converts three times, and if they remained adamant in their desire to convert, they would then allow them to begin the process.|$|E

50|$|In 1969, Cyrus Levinthal noted that, {{because of}} the {{very large number of}} degrees of freedom in an {{unfolded}} polypeptide chain, the molecule has an astronomical number of possible conformations. An estimate of 3300 or 10143 was made in one of his papers. Levinthal's paradox is a thought experiment based on the observation that if a protein were folded by sequentially sampling of all possible conformations, it would take an astronomical amount of time to do so, even if the conformations were sampled at a rapid rate (on the nanosecond or picosecond scale). Based upon the observation that proteins fold much faster than this, Levinthal then proposed that a random conformational search does not occur, and the protein must, therefore, <b>fold</b> <b>through</b> a series of meta-stable intermediate states.|$|E

She experimented with the poetic traditions of her day, often straying from the <b>fold</b> <b>through</b> her use of rhyme, meter and content, which ranged from the simplistic to the metaphysical. Additionally, Finch wrote several satiric vignettes modeled after the short tales of French fabulist Jean de La Fontaine. She mocked La Fontaine's fables, {{offering}} social criticism through biting sarcasm. Finch's more melancholy fare, however, gained her wider acclaim. Her famous poems in this sullen vein include A Nocturnal Reverie and Ardelia to Melancholy, both depicting severe depression. Finch also skillfully employed the Pindaric ode, exploring complex and irregular structures and rhyme schemes. Her most famous example of this technique is in The Spleen (1709), a poetic expression of depression and its effects: ...|$|E
40|$|A {{fundamental}} question in protein folding is whether proteins <b>fold</b> <b>through</b> one or multiple trajectories. While most experiments indicate a single pathway, simulations suggest proteins can <b>fold</b> <b>through</b> many parallel pathways. Here, {{we use a}} combination of chemical denaturant, mechanical force and site-directed mutations to demonstrate the presence of multiple unfolding pathways in a simple, two-state folding protein. We show that these multiple pathways have structurally different transition states, and that seemingly small changes in protein sequence and environment can strongly modulate the flux between the pathways. These results suggest that in vivo, the crowded cellular environment could strongly influence the mechanisms of protein folding and unfolding. Our study resolves the apparent dichotomy between experimental and theoretical studies, and highlights the advantage of using a multipronged approach to reveal the complexities of a protein’s free-energy landscape...|$|E
40|$|DEAD-box helicases are conserved enzymes {{involved}} {{in nearly all}} aspects of RNA metabolism, but their mechanisms of action remain unclear. Here, we investigated the mechanism of the DEAD-box protein Mss 116 on its natural substrate, the group II intron ai 5 γ. Group II introns are structurally complex catalytic RNAs considered evolutionarily related to the eukaryotic spliceosome, and an interesting paradigm for large RNA folding. We used single-molecule fluorescence to monitor the effect of Mss 116 on folding dynamics of a minimal active construct, ai 5 γ–D 135. The data show that Mss 116 stimulates dynamic sampling between states along the folding pathway, an effect previously observed only with high Mg 2 + concentrations. Furthermore, the data indicate that Mss 116 promotes <b>folding</b> <b>through</b> discrete ATP-independent and ATP-dependent steps. We propose that Mss 116 stimulates group II intron <b>folding</b> <b>through</b> a multi-step process that involves electrostatic stabilization of early intermediates and ATP hydrolysis during {{the final stages of}} native state assembly...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Two {{fundamentally}} {{different views of}} how proteins fold are now being debated. Do proteins <b>fold</b> <b>through</b> multiple unpredictable routes directed only by the energetically downhill nature of the folding landscape or do they <b>fold</b> <b>through</b> specific intermediates in a defined pathway that systematically puts predetermined pieces of the target native protein into place? It has now become possible to determine the structure of protein folding intermediates, evaluate their equilibrium and kinetic parameters, and establish their pathway relationships. Results obtained for many proteins have serendipitously revealed a new dimension of protein structure. Cooperative structural units of the native protein, called foldons, unfold and refold repeatedly even under native conditions. Much evidence obtained by hydrogen exchange and other methods now indicates that cooperative foldon units and not individual amino acids account for the unit steps in protein folding pathways. The formation of foldons and their ordered pathway assembly systematically puts native-like foldon building blocks into place, guided by a sequential stabilization mechanism in which prior native-like structure templates the formation of incoming foldons with complementary structure. Thus the same propensities and interactions that specify the final native state, encoded in the amino-acid sequence o...|$|E
