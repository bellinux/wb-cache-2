5|$|Gimsa et al. (2015) {{suggest that}} the <b>dorsal</b> sail of Spinosaurus was {{homologous}} to the <b>dorsal</b> fins of sailfish and served a hydrodynamic purpose. Gimsa and others point out that more basal, long-legged spinosaurids have otherwise round or crescent-shaped <b>dorsal</b> sails, whereas in Spinosaurus, the <b>dorsal</b> neural spines form a shape that is roughly rectangular and similar in shape to the <b>dorsal</b> fins of sailfish. They therefore argue that Spinosaurus used its <b>dorsal</b> neural sail {{in the same manner}} as sailfish, and that it also employed its long narrow tail to stun prey like a modern thresher shark.|$|E
5|$|A. m. sigillatum: Wax {{yellow to}} tan <b>dorsal</b> stripe forming spotty to {{irregular}} shaped blotches along body ending in dots or specks of <b>dorsal</b> color on head. Number of vomerine teeth equals 44. Number of costal grooves equals 13.|$|E
5|$|All of the fins, {{particularly}} the narrow pectoral fins, are falcate (sickle-shaped) to some degree. The medium-sized first <b>dorsal</b> fin originates {{just behind the}} pectoral fin rear tips. The second <b>dorsal</b> fin is about two-thirds as tall as the first, {{and there is no}} midline ridge running between them. The pelvic fins are broad and slightly larger than the anal fin. The anal fin has a strong notch in the trailing margin and is positioned slightly behind the second <b>dorsal</b> fin. The caudal peduncle bears a crescent-shaped notch at the upper origin of the caudal fin. The asymmetrical caudal fin has a well-developed lower lobe and a long, narrow upper lobe with a ventral notch near the tip. The prominent lateral line curves downward below the second <b>dorsal</b> fin. The skin is densely covered by small, overlapping dermal denticles; each bears five horizontal ridges leading to marginal teeth. This species is light grey to bronze above, darkening at the tips of the second <b>dorsal</b> fin and upper caudal fin lobe (though this may be indistinct in larger sharks), and pale below. The underside is off-white, and the first <b>dorsal</b> fin has a pale trailing margin.|$|E

5|$|Both <b>dorsal</b> fins are {{immediately}} preceded by stout, grooved spines, {{with the second}} much longer than the first. The small first <b>dorsal</b> fin has a rounded apex and a nearly straight trailing margin, with its origin lying behind the pectoral fins. The second <b>dorsal</b> fin is rather angular and has about double {{the area of the}} first, with its origin located opposite the midpoint of the pelvic fin bases. The pectoral fins are small and rounded. The pelvic fins are about as large as the second <b>dorsal</b> fin, with rounded tips and nearly straight trailing margins. The caudal peduncle is short and leads to a broad caudal fin comprising {{less than a quarter of}} the total length; the upper lobe has a convex upper margin leading to a squared-off tip, while the lower lobe is indistinct. The skin is densely covered by tiny dermal denticles; each one is recurved and thorn-like, rising from an irregular star-shaped base. This species is a plain dark brown above, darkening to almost black below, with white <b>dorsal</b> fin spines. Juvenile sharks have white edges on the <b>dorsal,</b> pectoral, and pelvic fins. Minute, luminescent dots are scattered about the skin without a regular pattern.|$|E
5|$|Inside the pudendal canal, {{the nerve}} divides into branches, first giving off the {{inferior}} rectal nerve, then the perineal nerve, before continuing as the <b>dorsal</b> nerve of the penis (in males) or the <b>dorsal</b> nerve of the clitoris (in females).|$|E
5|$|The body is deepest {{in front}} of the two tall and falcate (sickle-shaped) <b>dorsal</b> fins. The first <b>dorsal</b> fin is about a third larger than the second and {{originates}} over the pelvic fin origins. The second <b>dorsal</b> fin is located midway between the first <b>dorsal</b> and the caudal fin. The broad and triangular pectoral fins have a deep indentation where their leading margins meet the head. The pelvic fins are much smaller than the pectoral fins, and the anal fin is absent. The tail is much longer than the body and ends in a large, crescent-shaped caudal fin; the lower caudal fin lobe is more than half the length of the upper.|$|E

50|$|The {{vertebral}} column consists {{of at least}} 19 presacral vertebrae, the last 6 of these being <b>dorsals.</b> The neural spines of the twelfth and thirteenth vertebrae form the nuchal blade, which represents the point of greatest elevation in the {{vertebral column}}.|$|R
5|$|The broad, {{triangular}} pectoral fins originate {{below the}} third or fourth gill slits, and are no longer than the front margin of the first <b>dorsal</b> fin. The anal fin is about twice as long as the second <b>dorsal</b> fin and preceded by long ridges. The first <b>dorsal</b> fin originates over the pectoral fin free rear tips, and the much smaller second <b>dorsal</b> fin originates over the last third of the anal fin base. The <b>dorsal</b> fins do not have a ridge between them. The lower lobe of the caudal fin is well-developed and the upper lobe has a ventral notch near the tip. This shark is plain gray, brown-gray, or purple-gray above, and white below. The leading edge of the first <b>dorsal</b> fin and the trailing edge of the caudal fin may be dark, and the trailing edges of the pectoral fins may be light.|$|E
5|$|The <b>dorsal</b> and pelvic fins are angular, {{with the}} first <b>dorsal</b> fin larger than the second. The {{pectoral}} fins are narrow, pointed, and falcate (sickle-shaped); their shape separates this species from the similar-looking nurse shark. The origin of the first <b>dorsal</b> fin is about even with {{the origin of the}} pelvic fins, while the origin of the anal fin is even with or somewhat behind the origin of the second <b>dorsal</b> fin. The caudal fin has a shallow upper lobe and barely present lower lobe, comprising {{about a quarter of the}} total length in adults. The dermal denticles are diamond-shaped, bearing 45 faint ridges radiating from a blunt point. Tawny nurse sharks are yellowish, reddish, or grayish brown above and off-white below, and are capable of slowly changing their color to better blend with the environment. Young sharks have starkly white lower eyelids.|$|E
5|$|The fins are {{strongly}} falcate (sickle-shaped), particularly the <b>dorsal</b> fins, pelvic fins, and lower caudal fin lobe. The pectoral fins are narrow and pointed. The first <b>dorsal</b> fin is positioned about {{halfway between the}} pectoral and pelvic fins. The second <b>dorsal</b> fin is about two-thirds as tall as the first and is positioned slightly ahead of the anal fin. The anal fin is smaller than the second <b>dorsal</b> fin. The <b>dorsal</b> surface of the caudal peduncle bears a crescent-shaped notch at the caudal fin origin. The asymmetrical caudal fin has a well-developed lower lobe and a long upper lobe with a ventral notch near the tip. The dermal denticles are small and overlapping; each has five horizontal ridges leading to marginal teeth. This species is light grey or bronze above, often with small white spots on the sides, and pale below. The <b>dorsal</b> fins are tipped in white, which is especially obvious on the second <b>dorsal</b> as the remainder of fin is mostly dark.|$|E
50|$|Specimen NMC 8547, {{on which}} {{traditionally}} {{descriptions of the}} postcrania of Anchiceratops have been based, has many traits that are unique in the Chasmosaurinae. The vertebral column contains seventy-four vertebrae: ten of the neck, thirteen <b>dorsals,</b> twelve sacrals and thirty-nine caudals. Typically chasmosaurines have twelve <b>dorsals,</b> ten sacrals and up to forty-six tail vertebrae. Mallon presumed that the synsacrum, the fused vertebrae supporting the pelvis, had shifted to the rear. The neck of NMC 8547 is exceptionally long, with four syncervicals, fused anterior cervical vertebrae. Also the pelvis is very long. The tail is short. The forelimbs are very robust, with a large deltopectoral crest on the humerus, indicating a heavy musculature.|$|R
50|$|The scapula, which bears a {{strap-like}} {{blade and}} is roughly equal in length to the humerus, is preserved {{at an angle}} of 40° relative to the long axis of the <b>dorsals.</b> This is more similar to articulated specimens of more basal theropods as opposed to paravians, in which the scapula is nearly parallel to the <b>dorsals.</b> Like {{other members of the}} Pennaraptora, the large, four-sided coracoid is about 1.3 times {{as long as it is}} wide. The bottom of the coracoid extends backwards with a hook-like projection, the postglenoid process, which is similar in length to that of Sinornithoides but longer than that of Sinovenator. However, unlike Sinornithoides, the furcula is robust, flattened, and U-shaped like that of Mei.|$|R
5000|$|Lip rounding, or labialization, is {{a common}} approximant-like co-articulatory feature. English [...] is a voiced labialized velar approximant, which is far more common than the purely labial approximant β̞.

5|$|The first <b>dorsal</b> fin is {{positioned}} well {{back on the}} body, closer to the pelvic than the pectoral fins. The second <b>dorsal</b> and anal fins are large, about half to three-quarters {{as high as the}} first <b>dorsal</b> fin. The broad, triangular pectoral fins originate at or slightly before the level of the fifth gill slit. There is no ridge {{between the first and second}} <b>dorsal</b> fins. The lower lobe of the caudal fin is half the length of the upper, which has a strong notch near the tip. The dermal denticles are small and overlapping, usually with 7 horizontal ridges, giving the skin a smooth feel. The coloration is grayish to brownish above and white below, with a pattern of scattered small, dark spots unique to each individual. The tips of the first <b>dorsal</b> fin and upper caudal fin lobe, and sometimes also the second <b>dorsal</b> fin and lower caudal fin lobe, are bright white.|$|E
5|$|The first <b>dorsal</b> fin is {{tall and}} {{moderately}} falcate (sickle-shaped), with the origin over the pectoral fin rear tips. It {{is followed by a}} low midline ridge running to the second <b>dorsal</b> fin. The second <b>dorsal</b> fin originates over the anal fin. The pectoral fins are large with pointed tips. The coloration is brownish gray above and white below, with a faint white stripe on the sides. The edges of the fins are darker but not prominently marked. The Galapagos shark can be distinguished from the dusky shark in having taller first and second <b>dorsal</b> fins and larger teeth, and it can be distinguished from the grey reef shark in having a less robust body and less pointed first <b>dorsal</b> fin tip. However, these characters can be difficult to discern in the field. These similar species also have different numbers of precaudal (before the tail) vertebrae: 58 in the Galapagos shark, 8697 in the dusky shark, 110119 in the grey reef shark.|$|E
5|$|Adults {{are mostly}} white, but the front {{half of the}} rostrum, and {{the sides of the}} abdomen, are pink. Bright red bands extend across the base of the rostrum, the {{posterior}} edge of the carapace, the chelipeds, and each of the abdominal segments. The <b>dorsal</b> parts of the abdomen are brown, and there are two brown saddles on the <b>dorsal</b> carapace.|$|E
40|$|The Chinese sea snake Laticauda semifasciata (Reinwardt in Schlegel, 1837) is newly {{reported}} from Korean waters based on three specimens collected from Jeju Island, Korea, in August, September, and November 2015. This {{is the first}} time that the genus Laticauda and subfamily Laticaudinae has been {{reported from}} Korean waters. The subfamily Laticaudinae has ventrals that are four to five times wider than the adjacent <b>dorsals,</b> which are unlike the ventrals that are similar or up to two times wider than adjacent <b>dorsals</b> in the subfamily Hydrophiinae. Laticauda semifasciata is distinct from other species because it has three prefrontals and its rostrals are horizontally divided into two. As the result of this report, four species (L. semifasciata, Hydrophis (Pelamis) platurus, Hydrophis cyanocinctus, and H. melanocephalus) of sea snakes have been reported in Korean waters...|$|R
5000|$|Thorn {{clusters}} {{presented a}} problem in the reconstruction of some cognate sets in which Indo-Iranian sibilants in clusters with <b>dorsals</b> exceptionally correspond to coronal stops in certain other branches (particularly the Hellenic languages). 'Bear' and 'decaying' above are examples; another is Sanskrit tákṣan 'artisan' vs. Greek téktōn 'carpenter'. As {{was the case with the}} laryngeal theory, these cognate sets were first noted prior to the connection of Anatolian and Tocharian to PIE, and early reconstructions posited a new series of consonants to explain these correspondences. Brugmann 1897's systematic explanation augmented the PIE consonant system with a series of interdentals (nowhere directly attested) appearing only in clusters with <b>dorsals,</b> *kþ *kʰþʰ *gð *gʰðʰ. The use of the letter thorn led to the name [...] "thorn cluster" [...] for these groups.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Dorsals</b> {{can either}} be front [...] or back, , and can also be rounded. Plosives can be further altered by aspiration, glottalization, and voicing.

Published directories contain identifying photographs and names for hundreds of North Pacific animals. Photographic identification has enabled the local population of killer whales to be counted each year rather than estimated, and has enabled great insight into lifecycles and social structures.|$|E

5|$|Areas of the {{hippocampus}} are {{shown to be}} functionally and anatomically distinct. The <b>dorsal</b> hippocampus (DH), ventral hippocampus (VH) and intermediate hippocampus serve different functions, project with differing pathways, and have varying degrees of place cells. The <b>dorsal</b> hippocampus serves for spatial memory, verbal memory, and learning of conceptual information. Using the radial arm maze, lesions in the DH were shown to cause spatial memory impairment while VH lesions did not. Its projecting pathways include the medial septal nucleus and supramammillary nucleus. The <b>dorsal</b> hippocampus also has more place cells than both the ventral and intermediate hippocampal regions.|$|E

5000|$|Haplocanthosaurus {{is known}} from many elements, mostly of vertebra. In {{the middle and}} {{cervical}} caudals of Apatosaurus, Camarasaurus, Cetiosaurus and Haplocanthosaurus, the intraprezygapophyseal lamina is separate from {{the root of the}} neural canal by a vertical midline lamina. In the last few caudals and the most cranial <b>dorsals,</b> the lateral edge of the prezygapophyseal lamina becomes widened and roughened. Hatcher (1901) interpreted this as forming the attachment area for the muscles from which the scapular blade was suspended.|$|R
