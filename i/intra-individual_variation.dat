In all the tests, pain along the typical area raises suspicion for sacroiliac joint dysfunction. However no single test is very reliable in the diagnosis of sacroiliac joint dysfunction. It is important to remember true neurogenic weakness, numbness, or loss of reflex should alert the clinician to consider nerve root pathology.|$|E
50|$|Hippuric acid {{has long}} been used as an {{indicator}} of toluene exposure; however, there appears to be some doubt about its validity. There is significant endogenous hippuric acid production by humans; which shows inter- and <b>intra-individual</b> <b>variation</b> influenced by factors such as diet, medical treatment, alcohol consumption, etc. This suggests that hippuric acid may be an unreliable indicator of toluene exposure. It has been suggested that urinary hippuric acid, the traditional marker of toluene exposure is simply not sensitive enough to separate the exposed from the non-exposed. This has led to the investigation of other metabolites as markers for toluene exposure.|$|E
50|$|Pandurang Vasudeo Sukhatme (1911-1997) was an Indian {{statistician}} who did {{pioneering work}} in the 1940s by applying random sampling methods in agricultural statistics and in biometry. He was influential {{in the establishment of}} the Indian Agricultural Statistics Research Institute. Later, while working at FAO in Rome, he developed statistical models for assessing the dimensions of hunger and future food supplies for the world. He also developed methods for measuring the size and nature of the protein gap. Another of his major contributions was the application of statistical techniques for studying human nutrition. One of his ideas, the Sukhatme-Margen hypothesis, suggested that at low calorie intake levels, stored energy in the body is used with greater metabolic efficiency and that the metabolic efficiency decreases as the intake increases above the homeostatic range. This involved paying attention to intra-individual variability that was found to be more than the inter-individual variability in protein or calorie intake. He gave a genetic interpretation of the <b>intra-individual</b> <b>variation</b> jointly with P. Narain.|$|E

40|$|Little {{information}} {{exists on}} the extent of day-to-day <b>intra-individual</b> <b>variation</b> in resting metabolic rate (RMR) in women. The present study has investigated the <b>intra-individual</b> <b>variation</b> in RMR of women during the menstrual cycle. Nineteen women (naturally cycling non-pill users) were recruited to the study. Anthropometric and RMR measurements were taken at least three times per week for the duration of one complete menstrual cycle; measurements were taken for a second, consecutive cycle in eight of the nineteen subjects. RMR was measured by indirect calorimetry using a ventilated hood system under standardized conditions. The measurements made throughout each complete menstrual cycle were averaged and the levels of inter- and <b>intra-individual</b> <b>variation</b> in RMR were assessed by determining the CV (%). Mean RMR of the group was 5686 (sd 674) kJ/d; inter-individual variation in RMR was 11. 8 %. There were wide differences in the <b>intra-individual</b> <b>variation</b> in RMR of women (CV range 1. 7 - 10. 4 %). The CV in ten subjects was small (2 - 4 %), while the CV in nine women was high (5 - 10 %), indicating a significant variation in RMR during the menstrual cycle in certain subjects. Using statistical models, {{it has been shown that}} there was a significant effect on RMR due to a subject-specific level of variability; this was the case even when accounting for a possible training effect. In conclusion, the findings from our present study show that RMR cannot be assumed to be 'stable' in all women. The implications of <b>intra-individual</b> <b>variation</b> in RMR and its impact on energy balance needs further research...|$|E
40|$|In the {{factorial}} {{estimation of}} total energy expenditure {{it is assumed}} that the <b>intra-individual</b> <b>variation</b> in RMR is small. Little is known about the <b>intra-individual</b> <b>variation</b> of RMR in older subjects. The present study investigated the <b>intra-individual</b> <b>variation</b> in RMR in older people. Measurements of RMR were made in twenty-seven older subjects, mean age 71. 6 (SD 6. 1) years, on two separate occasions (T 1 and T 2) and on a third occasion (T 3) in nineteen of the subjects. Measurements of height and weight were taken in all subjects. RMR measurements were made in the laboratory using a Deltatrac TM (ventilated-hood indirect calorimeter, Datex, Helsinki, Finland). All subjects had fasted overnight for 12 h and refrained from strenuous exercise before measurements. The intra-individual CV in RMR (kJ/d) after T 1 and T 2 was 2. 5 % in women and 3. 6 % in men and was 2. 6 % in women and 3. 4 % in men after all three sets of measurements. Although mean RMR did not vary across T 1, T 2 and T 3, there was significant 'crossing tracks' across the three measurements occasions in some individuals, reflecting a high degree of within-subject variability. The methods used had a significant measurement error associated with them (high R value; significant F ratio in three-way ANOVA). In conclusion, the results from the present study indicate that <b>intra-individual</b> <b>variation</b> in RMR was low in older people. The <b>intra-individual</b> <b>variation</b> in the elderly is similar to that seen in younger age groups. Citation: Gibbons, M. R. D. et al. (2004).

40|$|Anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) {{has emerged}} as an {{important}} marker of ovarian reserve. Its variation throughout the cycle, however, may still {{be a matter of}} debate. The objective {{of this study was to}} re-evaluate the intra-cycle fluctuations of AMH in individuals in a prospective clinical study with focus on the age-related effects on these fluctuations. Frequent blood samples were obtained from the mid-luteal phase of the first cycle to the mid-luteal phase of the second cycle in 44 healthy, regularly menstruating Caucasian women. Main outcome measures were individual fluctuations of AMH concentrations during the natural menstrual cycle. AMH concentrations exhibited large fluctuations throughout the cycle and did not follow a defined pattern. Female age was negatively correlated with mean AMH concentrations. The absolute <b>intra-individual</b> <b>variation</b> was also negatively associated with age, whereas the relative <b>intra-individual</b> <b>variation</b> was positively associated with age. Although the fluctuation in relative <b>intra-individual</b> <b>variation</b> was higher in the older group, the absolute variation is very low and these fluctuations might therefore be of limited clinical relevance in this age group. These data show that in younger women caution should be exerted with the interpretation of a single randomly taken AMH measurement as a representative of ovarian reserve.

30|$|Two {{objectives}} {{guided the}} present study. The first was to test theoretical assumptions on the crossover of positive activity-related emotions from teachers {{to students in}} vocational classrooms. The second was to explore if crossover occurrence or strength may be conditional on the formal type of training (dual vs. school-based programs) or the domain of training (different occupational fields), which all co-exist in Germany’s heterogeneous system of initial vocational training. By using multilevel latent contextual models (Marsh et al. 2009), we aimed to explain between-class variation regarding students’ habitual enjoyment of lessons (rather than <b>intra-individual</b> <b>variations</b> in transient, momentary emotional states) while controlling for the confounding effects of academic self-efficacy beliefs on enjoyment ratings at the student level of analysis.|$|R

However, the aim of our ToPIQ-II study is to compare different brands and tobacco products with the 3 R 4 F standard research cigarette in terms of their PM emission, when smoked in a standardized way (Gerber et al. 2015 a, b).

40|$|Summary: Substance {{concentrations}} of plasma Cholinesterase (EC 3. 1. 1. 8) were measured in 94 healthy individuals without occupational exposure to known inhibitors (six samples from each individual). Immu-noreactive Cholinesterase substance concentrations showed an inter-individual variation corresponding to CVtotal = 22 % (mean: 5. 01 mg/ 1, SD: 1. 11 mg/ 1). Intra-individual variations of immunoreactive Cholinesterase substance concentration were correlated (r = 0. 36) to intra-individual variations of albumin. Estimated by a repeated-measures analysis of variance, the observed <b>intra-individual</b> <b>variation</b> of Cholinesterase substance concentration corresponded to CV = 8. 8 % (SD: 0. 44 mg/ 1), which {{together with a}} CVerror = 6 % (within and between runs), implies a biological <b>intra-individual</b> <b>variation</b> of Cholinesterase substance concentration cor-responding to CVintra = 6. 4 %.

The structure and dynamics of CF respiratory tract microbial communities during the early stages of P. aeruginosa colonization were characterized by pyrosequencing and cloning-sequencing. The respiratory microbiota showed high diversity, related to the young age of the CF cohort (mean age 10  years). Wide inter- and <b>intra-individual</b> <b>variations</b> were revealed. A common core microbiota of 5 phyla and 13 predominant genera was found, the majority of which were obligate anaerobes.

40|$|Laser Doppler blood flowmetry is a {{non-invasive}} technique for monitoring blood microcirculation in biological tissues {{and has been}} used in clinics for last three decades [1]. In spite of its important advantages such as high spatial resolution, noninvasiveness and real-time monitoring, this technique has several problems limiting its use in clinical practice [2, 3]. This is partly caused by the fact that LDPM cannot measure in absolute flow units, by the large flux-signal fluctuations and by the lack of standardization of laser Doppler perfusion monitors. The complexity and randomness of the microvascular network further complicates the measurement situation. An important limitation of this technique is the dependence of perfusion signal on the photon path lengths [4 - 6]. Coherence domain path length resolved optical Doppler perfusion monitoring, of which the basic technique is developed in this thesis, will overcome this limitation. This will enable to correctly interpret the inter-and <b>intra-individual</b> <b>variations</b> in the LDF readings introduced by the variance in individual photon path lengths due to changes in tissue optical properties and probe geometry...|$|R
