40|$|We {{compare the}} {{conductance}} of an undoped graphene sheet {{with a small}} region subject to an electrostatic gate potential for the cases that the dynamics in the <b>gated</b> <b>region</b> is regular (disc-shaped region) and classically chaotic (stadium). For the disc, we find sharp resonances that narrow upon reducing the area fraction of the <b>gated</b> <b>region.</b> We relate this observation {{to the existence of}} confined electronic states. For the stadium, the conductance looses its dependence on the gate voltage upon reducing the area fraction of the <b>gated</b> <b>region,</b> which signals the lack of confinement of Dirac quasiparticles in a <b>gated</b> <b>region</b> with chaotic classical electron dynamics.

50|$|Another {{important}} factor during a commutation from on-state to off-state is the di/dt {{of the current}} from MT1 to MT2. This {{is similar to the}} recovery in standard diodes: the higher the di/dt, the greater the reverse current.

50|$|Another example, the {{potentiometric}} biosensor, (potential {{produced at}} zero current) gives a logarithmic response {{with a high}} dynamic range. Such biosensors are often made by screen printing the electrode patterns on a plastic substrate, coated with a conducting polymer and then some protein (enzyme or antibody) is attached. They have only two electrodes and are extremely sensitive and robust. They enable the detection of analytes at levels previously only achievable by HPLC and LC/MS and without rigorous sample preparation. All biosensors usually involve minimal sample preparation as the biological sensing component is highly selective for the analyte concerned. The signal is produced by electrochemical and physical changes in the conducting polymer layer due to changes occurring at {{the surface of the}} sensor. Such changes can be attributed to ionic strength, pH, hydration and redox reactions, the latter due to the enzyme label turning over a substrate. Field effect transistors, in which the <b>gate</b> <b>region</b> has been modified with an enzyme or antibody, can also detect very low concentrations of various analytes as the binding of the analyte to the <b>gate</b> <b>region</b> of the FET cause a change in the drain-source current.|$|E

50|$|The {{overall length}} of the pore is 45 Å, and its {{diameter}} varies considerably within the distinct regions of the inner tunnel. Travelling from the intracellular region outwards (bottom to top in the picture) the pore begins with a <b>gate</b> <b>region</b> formed by M2 helices at 18 Å in diameter, and then opens into a wide cavity (∼10 Å across) near {{the middle of the}} membrane. In these regions, K+ ions are in contact with surrounding water molecules but when they enter the channel from the selectivity filter at the top, the cavity is so narrow that K+ ions must shed any hydrating waters in order to enter the cell. In regards to the amino acid composition of the pore-lining residues within KcsA, the side chains lining the internal pore and cavity are predominantly hydrophobic, but within the selectivity filter polar amino acids are present that contact the dehydrated K+ ions.|$|E
50|$|The aluminum-gate MOS process technology, {{developed}} in the mid-sixties, started with the definition and doping of the source and drain regions of MOS transistors, followed by the gate mask that defined the thin-oxide region of the transistors. With additional processing steps, an aluminum gate would then be formed over the thin-oxide region completing the device fabrication. Due to the inevitable misalignment of the gate mask {{with respect to the}} source and drain mask, it was necessary to have a fairly large overlap area between the <b>gate</b> <b>region</b> and the source and drain regions, to ensure that the thin-oxide region would bridge the source and drain, even under worst-case misalignment. This requirement resulted in gate-to-source and gate-to-drain parasitic capacitances that were large and variable from wafer to wafer, depending on the misalignment of the gate oxide mask with respect with the source and drain mask. The result was an undesirable spread in the speed of the integrated circuits produced, and a much lower speed than theoretically possible if the parasitic capacitances could be reduced to a minimum. The overlap capacitance with the most adverse consequences on performance was the gate-to-drain parasitic capacitance, Cgd, which, by the well-known Miller effect, augmented the gate-to-source capacitance of the transistor by Cgd multiplied by the gain of the circuit to which that transistor was a part. The impact was a considerable reduction in the switching speed of transistors.|$|E

40|$|In gated radiotherapy, the {{accuracy}} of treatment delivery is determined by {{the accuracy}} with which both the imaging and treatment beams are gated. Time delays are of four types: (1) beam on imaging time delay is the time between the target entering the <b>gated</b> <b>region</b> and the first gated image acquisition; (2) beam off imaging time delay is the time between the target exiting a <b>gated</b> <b>region</b> and the last image acquisition; (3) beam on treatment time delay is the time between the target entering the <b>gated</b> <b>region</b> and the treatment beam on; and (4) beam off treatment time delay is the time between the target exiting the <b>gated</b> <b>region</b> and treatment beam off. Asynchronous time delays for the imaging and treatment systems may increase the required internal target volume (ITV) margin. We measured time delay on three fluoroscopy systems, and three linear accelerator treatment beams, varying gating type (amplitude vs. phase), beam energy, dose rate, and period. The average beam on imaging time delays were- 0. 04 ± 0. 05 sec (amplitude, 1 SD),- 0. 11 ± 0. 04 sec (phase); while the average beam off imaging time delays were- 0. 18 ± 0. 08 sec (amplitude) and- 0. 15 ± 0. 04 sec (phase). The average beam on treatment time delays were + 0. 09 ± 0. 02 sec (amplitude, 1 SD), + 0. 10 ± 0. 03 sec (phase); while the average beam off time delays for treatment beams were + 0. 08 ± 0. 02 sec (amplitude) and + 0. 07 ± 0. 02 sec (phase). The negative value indicates the images were acquired early, and the positive values show the treatment beam was triggered late. We present a technique for calculating the margin necessary to account for time delays. We found that the difference between these imaging and treatment time delays required {{a significant increase in the}} ITV margin in the direction of tumor motion at the gated level.

However, comparing to other methods of periodically modulating graphene, namely perforated graphene structures, we find that the resulting band gap is significantly smaller. We discuss the intricate dependence of the band gap on the magnitude of the gate potential as well as the exact geometry of the edge of the <b>gate</b> <b>region.</b> The role of the overlap of the eigenstates with the <b>gate</b> <b>region</b> is elucidated.

Identification of the <b>gate</b> <b>regions</b> in {{the primary}} structure of the secretin pIV. Molecular microbiology, 76 (1), 133 - 150. doi: 10. 1111 /j. 1365 - 2958. 2010. 07085. xSecretins are a family of large outer membrane proteins with large-diameter lumens (5 - 10 nm). This allows them to transport bulky substrates, including folded proteins, or assembled macromolecular structures – filamentous phages and type IV pili. Many proteins exported by secretins are essential for virulence of Gram-negative pathogens. Such a large channel would ordinarily sensitize the bacterial cell to noxious agents. However, secretins do not - {{the presence of a}} mobile septum, or gate, across the lumen of the channel prevents access by noxious agents. Despite the importance of the gate in secretin function, the sequence identity of the gate residues is unknown. In this study, in vivo random mutagenesis was used to map amino acid residues involved in gating the filamentous phage secretin - pIV. This approach has identified 34 residues that are involved in the gating mechanism. These residues are predominantly located within the secretin homology domain and organised into two clusters; GATE 1 (39 residues) and GATE 2 (14 residues). A number of isolated point mutants sensitised Escherichia coli to bile salts and antibiotics. These findings allowed the construction of a site-directed deletion mutant of GATE 2, confirming the gate function. This thesis mapped, for the first time, a secretin gate. Given the success of the mutagenesis approach used in this thesis, the method here will be applicable to secretins of pathogenic bacteria and other outer membrane channels whose <b>gate</b> <b>regions</b> have not been determined as yet. Knowing the <b>gate</b> <b>regions</b> of “pathogenic” secretins in turn will help design secretin-targeting antimicrobials...|$|R

The transistor {{is based}} on a magnonic crystal designed {{in the form of an}} yttrium iron garnet film with an array of parallel grooves at its surface.

A magnon transistor allows for the suppression of the source-to-drain magnon current (shown with blue spheres in the right figure) via the injection of the gate magnons (red spheres) into the <b>gate</b> <b>region.</b> A nonlinear four-magnon scattering mechanism is responsible for the transistor’s operational principle: When magnons from the transistor’s source enter the <b>gate</b> <b>region</b> they are scattered by the gate magnons and, thus, reach the transistor’s drain with attenuation.

40|$|Abstract—Leakage {{power is}} an {{important}} component of the total power consumption in FPGAs built using 90 nm and smaller technology nodes. Power <b>gating,</b> in which <b>regions</b> of the chip can be powered down, has been shown to be effective at reducing leakage power. However, previous techniques focus on staticallycontrolled power gating. In this paper, we propose a modification to the fabric of an FPGA that enables dynamically-controlled power gating, in which logic clusters can be selectively powereddown at run-time. For applications containing blocks with large idle times, this could lead to significant leakage power savings. Our architecture utilizes the existing routing fabric and unused input pins of logic clusters to route the power control signals. No modifications to the existing routing algorithms are required to support the new architecture. We study the area and power tradeoffs by varying the basic architecture parameters of an FPGA, and by varying the size of the power <b>gating</b> <b>regions.</b> We also study the leakage energy savings using a model that characterizes an application in terms of its structure and behavior. We show less than 1 % of area overhead for a power <b>gating</b> <b>region</b> size of 3 X 3 logic tiles. Using the application model, we show that up to 40 % leakage energy reduction can be achieved using the proposed architecture for different application parameters, not including power dissipated by the power state controller.
