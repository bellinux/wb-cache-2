He supported Ganguly's dream to be a cricketer and asked their father to get Ganguly enrolled in a cricket coaching camp during his summer holidays. Ganguly was studying in tenth grade at that time.|$|E

5|$|The {{main event}} at Victory Road {{was for the}} TNA World Heavyweight Championship between then-champion Samoa Joe and the {{challenger}} Booker T. Joe and Booker T previously fought at TNA's Slammiversary PPV event on June8 in a King of the Mountain match for the title, which Joe won to remain champion. On the June12 episode of TNA's television program TNA Impact!, Booker T claimed that Joe did not beat him at the event due to interference from Joe's mentor Kevin Nash. This led to Nash stating that Joe could not beat Booker T in a one-on-one match. After this segment, Joe announced that Booker T and he would face at Victory Road for the title. Since Houston is Booker T's hometown, TNA promoted the match as him attempting to win the championship <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>of</b> Houston.

5|$|The {{stranding}} of the Northern bottlenose whale mainly {{happens in}} two {{villages in the}} northern part of SuÃ°uroy: Hvalba and SandvÃ­k. It is believed that it happens because of a navigation problem of the whale, because there are isthmuses on these places, where the distance between the east and west coasts are short, around one kilometer or so. And for some reason it seems like the bottlenose whale want to take a short cut through what it thinks is a sound, and too late it discovers, that is on shallow ground and is unable to turn around again. It happened on 30 August 2012, when two Northern bottlenose whales swam ashore to the gorge SigmundsgjÃ³gv in SandvÃ­k. Two men who were working on the harbour noticed these whales, and some time later they had either died by themselves or were killed by the locals and then cut up for food <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>of</b> SandvÃ­k and Hvalba (Hvalba municipality).|$|E
