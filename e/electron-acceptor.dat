40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{explores the}} self-assembly of diblock copolymers {{as a way}} to control the morphology of photoactive layer in organic solar cells. Heterojunction formation between electron donor and electron acceptor materials needs to be controlled on the nanometer scale to have high power conversion from organic photovoltaic cells. Two approaches were developed to direct the assembly of electron-donors and <b>electron-acceptors</b> into heterojunction structures. The first one involves the synthesis of acid cleavable diblock copolymer to create porous polymer films, which can be used as templates to form well ordered donor-acceptor heterojunctions on the nanometer scale.

50|$|In the non-cyclic reaction, the photons are {{captured}} in the light-harvesting antenna complexes of photosystem II by chlorophyll and other accessory pigments (see diagram at right). The absorption of a photon by the antenna complex frees an electron by a process called photoinduced charge separation. The antenna system {{is at the core}} of the chlorophyll molecule of the photosystem II reaction center. That freed electron is transferred to the primary <b>electron-acceptor</b> molecule, pheophytin. As the electrons are shuttled through an electron transport chain (the so-called Z-scheme shown in the diagram), it initially functions to generate a chemiosmotic potential by pumping proton cations (H+) across the membrane and into the thylakoid space. An ATP synthase enzyme uses that chemiosmotic potential to make ATP during photophosphorylation, whereas NADPH is a product of the terminal redox reaction in the Z-scheme. The electron enters a chlorophyll molecule in Photosystem I. There it is further excited by the light absorbed by that photosystem. The electron is then passed along a chain of electron acceptors to which it transfers some of its energy. The energy delivered to the electron acceptors is used to move hydrogen ions across the thylakoid membrane into the lumen. The electron is eventually used to reduce the co-enzyme NADP with a H+ to NADPH (which has functions in the light-independent reaction); at that point, the path of that electron ends.|$|E

In this work, electrochemical-deposition methods of polymeric conductive films were studied in order to realize bulk heterojunction solar cells. Indium Tin Oxide (ITO) glass electrodes modified with a thin layer of poly(3, 4 -ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) were electrochemically prepared under potentiodynamic and potentiostatic conditions; then those techniques were applied for the electrochemical co-deposition of donor and acceptor on modified ITO electrode to produce the active layer (blend). For the deposition of the electron-donor polymer the electropolymerization of many functionalized thiophene monomers was investigated while, as regards acceptors, fullerene was used first, then the study was focused on its derivative PCBM ([6, 6]-phenyl-C 61 -butyric acid methyl ester). The polymeric films obtained (PEDOT and blend) were electrochemically and spectrophotometrically characterized and the film thicknesses were evaluated by atomic force microscopy (AFM).

Determining the relative importance of each of these aspects is decisive for the construction of more efficient OSCs. Here we introduce two π-extended derivatives of tetrathiafulvalene as electron donors for solution-processed small-molecule bulk-heterojunction solar cells. Both of them exhibit similar bowl-shape geometry, excellent electron-donor characteristics and moderately high association constants with fullerenes in solution (on the order of 104 M- 1 for truxTTF and 103 M- 1 for truxTTFCO in several solvents at room temperature). The substitution of one dithiole ring in truxTTF-CO for a ketone results in an intramolecular push-pull effect, which enhances its light-haversting properties, with the onset of absorbance reaching 650 nm. The introduction of a third dithiole ring, results in a more pronounced concave shape in truxTTF, allowing a better self-assembly with fullerenes which in turn leads to a better control of the morphology. However, the lightabsorption ability of truxTTF is limited to ca. 500 nm. We prepared bulk-heterojunction solar cells using phenyl-C 60 -butyric acid methyl ester (PC 61 BM) and PC 71 BM as <b>electron-acceptors</b> and bowl-shape truxTTF and truxTTF-CO as electron-donors.

From voltage-current characteristics of ZnS-graphene nanocomposites, it is observed that the conductivity of the composite increases by 104 times the conductivity of ZnS QDs.

It is shown how charge carrier mobility of a series of anthracene-containing poly(p-phenylene-ethynylene) -alt-poly(p-phenylene-vinylene) s (AnE-PVs) is highly dependent on the lateral chain of the polymers, on a moderate variation of the macromolecular parameters (molecular weight and polydispersity), and on the processing conditions of the films. For the first time, the good ambipolar transport properties of this relevant class of conjugated polymers have been demonstrated, consistent with the high delocalization of both the frontier molecular orbitals. Charge transport {{is one of the key}} parameters in the operation of BHJ solar cells and depends both on charge carrier mobility in pristine materials and on the nanoscale morphology of the D/A blend, as proved by the results here reported. A straight correlation between hole mobility in pristine AnE-PVs and the fill factor of the related solar cells has been found. The great impact of charge transport for the performance of BHJ solar cells is clearly demonstrated by the results obtained on BHJ solar cells made of neat-C 70, instead of the common soluble fullerene derivatives (PCBM or PC 70 BM). The investigation of neat-C 70 solar cells was motivated by the extremely low cost of non-functionalized fullerenes, compared with that of their soluble derivatives (about one-tenth).

40|$|Leaching of {{contaminants}} from the vadose zone to the groundwater {{depends on the}} soil properties and the infiltration rate. In this thesis, organic degradable contaminants were studied, such as de-icing chemicals (consisting of propylene glycol, PG) and pesticides. Heterogeneous soil properties lead to spatial variability in leaching, which is particularly important for degradable contaminants. The infiltration rate determines the travel time in the vadose zone, and thus the time available for degradation.   Two field experiments were performed with a multi-compartment sampler (consisting of 10 x 10 cells of 3. 15 x 3. 15 cm 2 each) to examine the dependence of spatial variability in contaminant leaching on the infiltration rate. The first experiment was carried out during the snowmelt period, characterized by high infiltration rates from snowmelt. The second experiment was carried out with irrigation to mimic homogeneous rainfall. The preferential flow paths were similar for both experiments. With a high infiltration rate during the snowmelt experiment, the leaching was distributed more homogeneous than during the irrigation experiment. Therefore, it is concluded that the soil heterogeneity is mainly caused by spatial differences in the soil hydraulic properties, and not by macropores. The leached masses of the degradable PG and a nondegradable tracer were highly correlated. At {{the scale of the}} experiment, heterogeneous infiltration resulting from spatial differences in snowmelt did not have much influence on the flow and solute paths.   The results from the field experiment were used to parameterize a random field for the scaling factor of the retention curve. As a criterion to compare the results from simulations and observations, the sorted and cumulative total drainage in a cell was used. The effect of the ratio of the infiltration rate over the degradation rate on leaching of degradable solutes was investigated. Furthermore, the spatial distribution of the leaching of degradable and non-degradable solutes was compared. The infiltration rate influences contaminant leaching in two ways. Firstly, the travel time of the contaminant in the vadose zone depends on the infiltration rate. Secondly, the fraction of the soil which is active in transport is influenced by the infiltration rate. As a result, the spatial distribution of contaminant leaching, and therefore the leached fraction, depends on the infiltration rate.   The leached fraction of a degradable contaminant is often estimated from average soil properties and stationary weather series. For contaminants that degrade in both the adsorbed and aqueous phase, it is known how these averaged properties should be derived from heterogeneous properties. However, for contaminants that only degrade in the aqueous phase, this is not well known. In soils that are layered with respect to the adsorption constant, the propagation of the contaminant plume, and thus the travel time in the vadose zone, depends on the adsorption constant, degradation rate, and dispersivity. Regarding variable weather series, seasonal fluctuations in precipitation lead to large differences in travel times in a dry climate, and thus large differences in the leached fraction, especially for contaminants with little adsorption. In a wet climate, the effect of such seasonal fluctuations is diminished.   In the vadose zone, PG can be degraded by micro-organisms, for which <b>electron-acceptors</b> are needed. A field experiment showed that aerobic as well as anaerobic degradation occurs in the vadose zone. For anaerobic degradation, manganese-oxides (which are present in the soil) or nitrate (applied to enhance biodegradation) can be used as <b>electron-acceptors.</b> Reduced forms of manganese can be transported to the groundwater, and thus the soil could be depleted from manganese-oxides. A model was developed in which both types of degradation were included. The application of nitrate did not lead to a lower PG leaching, or in a slower depletion of manganese-oxides. The leached fraction is higher with a thick snowcover and high meltrate, as then PG is transported rapidly in the soil. Snowmelt did not result in anaerobic soil, despite the high soil moisture content, and thus low oxygen diffusion...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{is based on}} the synthesis and evaluation of novel liquid crystalline materials with light-emitting and or charge-transporting properties. Some of the liquid crystals (LCs) synthesised incorporate photopolymerisable diene or methacrylate end groups, situated at the peripheries of the molecular core. These photoreactive liquid crystalline monomers are often termed reactive mesogens. The generation of linearly and circularly polarised light emission have been observed and a White-Light Organic Light-Emitting Diode (WOLED) fabricated from binary mixtures of LCs. A series of fluorene-containing LCs have been synthesised for use as hole-transport, electron-transport and electroluminescent materials. Many of these materials exhibit nematic phases, which is beneficial for alignment due to the lower viscosity present in the nematic phase compared to the smectic phase. Columnar LCs with low melting points were synthesised by variation of the aliphatic groups at the 3, 4, 9, 10 -positions of a perylene tetracarboxylate. A fluorene-containing material with perfluorinated chains at the 9 -position of the fluorene was synthesised, although the required LC phase was not observed. High electron-affinity nitrogen-containing smectic LCs have been synthesised with relatively low LC transition temperatures. These materials may prove useful as electron-transport materials. An electroluminescent chiral nematic LC was synthesised, which leads to the possibility of circularly polarised light. The possibility of a full-colour LC-Organic Light-Emitting Diode (OLED) has been demonstrated with the synthesis of a red-emitting material, a green-emitting material and a blue-emitting material. All three materials are LCs with high glass transition temperatures, which is important for device stability as these materials are not reactive mesogens. A White-Light OLED has been demonstrated by the mixing of two LCs. This nematic binary mixture when used as the emissive layer in an OLED emits white-light that is voltage independent and not due to Förster energy transfer. Consequently this mixture can be aligned and linearly polarised light emission has been generated with a 9 : 1 ratio. A series of perylene-containing LCs have been synthesised for use as electron-transport materials in OLEDs or <b>electron-acceptors</b> in organic photovoltaics.

40|$|The {{nucleophilic}} {{character and}} stability of the carbanions vs. alkoxides derived from 2, 2, 2 -trifluoro- 1 -(9 -anthryl) ethanol and 1 -(9 -anthryl) ethanol containing X electron-releasing and X <b>electron-acceptor</b> substituents attached to C- 10, have been studied at the B 3 LYP/ 6 - 31 +G(d,p) level of theory. Results analyzed {{in terms of the}} absolute gas-phase acidity, Fukui function, the local hard and soft acids and bases principle, and the molecular electrostatic potential, show that the central ring of the 9 -anthryl group confers an ambident nucleophilic character and stabilizes the conjugated carbanion by <b>electron-acceptor</b> delocalization...|$|E
40|$|Two {{extended}} conjugated molecules potentially {{active as}} <b>electron-acceptor</b> materials for organic solar cells have been synthesized by grafting the electron-withdrawing dicyanovinyl (1) and p-cyano pyridyl (2) {{groups on the}} rigid and planar benzodithiophene (BDT) platform. UV–Vis spectroscopy shows that both compounds absorb in the visible region of the solar spectrum. Cyclic voltammetry indicates that only compound 1 presents a LUMO level {{comparable to that of}} fullerene C 60. A preliminary evaluation of the potentialities of compound 1 as an <b>electron-acceptor</b> has been carried out on ‘all-molecular’ solution-processed bulk hetero-junction solar cells using a small triphenylamine-based system as the molecular donor. In spite of a high open-circuit voltage, the devices present a modest efficiency indicating that the light-harvesting properties and charge-mobility of the acceptor-molecules need further structural optimization...|$|E

40|$|The {{synthesis}} of nitro- 2, 3 -dimethylnaphthalenes has been undertaken, and fourteen previously unreported dinitro, trinitro, tetranitro and pentanitro derivatives of 2, 3 -dimethylnaphthalene have been prepared. The {{synthesis of}} nitro- 1, 5 -dimethylnaphthalenes {{has also been}} undertaken, and seven previously unreported mononitro, dinitro, trinitro and tetranitro derivatives of 1, 5 -dimethylnaphthalene have been prepared. The positive and negative ion mass spectra, electronic spectra and nuclear magnetic resonance spectra of these compounds have been recorded and {{discussed in terms of}} the structures of the compounds. The electron spin resonance spectra of the radical anions of two of the symmetrically substituted compounds have been recorded. The reactions of polynitro- 2, 3 -dimethyl-naphthalenes with methoxide ion and sulphite ion have been investigated, and the Meisenheimer complexes so formed characterised by NMR spectroscopy. In a number of cases solid Meisenheimer complexes have been isolated. The reaction of 4 -nitro- 1, 5 -dimethylnaphthalene with hydroxide ion was found to produce dinitro derivatives of naphthastilbene and naphthabibenzyl, resulting from coupling via the 1 -methyl group. The reactions of polynitro- 1, 5 -dimethylnaphthalenes with methoxide ion, sulphite ion, diethylamine and triethylamine in dimethylsulphoxide solvent have been investigated in situ by NMR spectroscopy, and benzyl-type ions resulting from abstraction of methyl hydrogen atoms were found to have been produced. The reaction of 2, 4, 6, 8 -tetranitro- 1, 5 - dimethylnaphthalene with methoxide ion in tetrahydrofuran solvent was investigated, and a solid Meisenheimer complex was isolated. The association constants for the formation of charge-transfer complexes between benzene and the polynitro- 1, 5 -dimethlnaphthalenes and polynitro- 2, 3 - dimethylnaphthalenes have been determined by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and {{it has been shown that}} polynitro- 1, 5 -dimethlnaphthalenes are stronger <b>electron-acceptors</b> than polynitro- 2, 3 -dimethylnaphthalenes. The rates of nitration of a number of mononitro, dinitro and trinitro derivatives of 1, 5 -dimethylnaphthalene and 2, 3 -dimethylnaphthalene have been investigated and the rates correlated with theoretical reactivity indices derived from Huckel Molecular Orbital calculations...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1990 This study {{involves}} {{the development of}} a biofilm reactor that supports growth of a deep biofilm on a gas permeable membrane. The reactor solution is not aerated, and oxygen is supplied through the membrane. The reactor is termed a substratum-aerated-biofilm reactor or SAB. With adequate concentrations of electron-donors and <b>electron-acceptors,</b> a deep biofilm grows on the membrane and is comprised of different layers of bacterial activity. The aerobic layers are near the membrane support, while the anaerobic layers are near the biofilm-liquid boundary. In the SAB, the substrate diffuses from the bulk liquid into the biofilm to react. Oxygen diffuses through the membrane into the biofilm. All products likewise are transported by molecular diffusion through the biofilm and into the bulk liquid. The reactors consisted of a reactor wall made of a plexiglass cylinder with the gas permeable membrane supported on a shallow rotating cup. The cup was designed so that the cup and the membrane function as a flat plate. The flat plate was utilized for support of the biological growth, transfer of oxygen, and mixing of the bulk liquid and the gas phase. The experiments were conducted in completely mixed, continuous-flow reactors maintained at 25 °C with a hydraulic detention of 8 hours. Pure oxygen was delivered to a gas compartment under the membrane. All reactors were fed a synthetic waste buffered to pH 7. 0. The background solution for the feed solution was made from distilled water combined with adequate inorganic nutrients and vitamins. The background solution was supplemented with acetate and ammonia to obtain the desired substrate compositions. Combined nitrification and heterotrophic oxidation activity resulted when the SABs where fed 5 or 10 mg/ 1 acetate, and 10 mg-N/ 1 ammonia. Combined nitrification, heterotrophic oxidation, and denitrification resulted with acetate concentration of 20, 40, and 100 mg/ 1, and 10 mg- N/ 1 ammonia. Combined heterotrophic oxidation and fermentation resulted with acetate concentration of 800 mg/ 1, and 10 mg-N/ 1 ammonia. A series of mass balances were developed to determine the fate of the nitrogen compounds and acetate. These results showed that the flux values for carbon oxidation, nitrification, denitrification, and fermentation are higher than those reported for competing technologies such as rotating biological contactors...|$|R
40|$|Undisturbed {{sediment}} {{samples were}} collected for chemical analyses at six sites during winter and summer cruises to the eastern Canadian continental margin. Micro-electrode oxygen profiles were obtained in freshly collected multicorer samples, and replicate cores were incubated at in situ temperature for 48 　h to monitor changes in the concentrations of dissolved oxygen and nitrate. In addition, box cores were subsampled vertically for porewater chemistry, porosity, and particulate carbon. The data obtained are combined with estimates of sedimentation rate based on sediment trap measurements, 210 Pb dating and historical data to evaluate the role of benthic processes in the carbon cycle on the eastern Canadian continental margin. With one exception, oxygen uptake rates determined from incubations and calculated from micro-profiles were very similar, indicating that exchange of oxygen across the sediment-water interface was dominated by molecular diffusion. On {{the basis of this}} observation, transport by diffusion is assumed for the calculation of the flux rates for other solutes from their respective porewater gradients. The fluxes of oxygen into the sediments were low, but generally comparable to other continental margins at comparable depths. They varied from 1. 4 to 1. 8 　mmol/m 2 /d in December 1993 and from 2. 8 to 4. 5 　mmol/m 2 /d in June 1994. Uptake of nitrate by the sediment occurred at all sites except for the continental slope off Nova Scotia. Both oxygen and nitrate uptake were higher in summer than in winter, indicative of a lingering response to the input of organic matter associated with the early spring bloom. At one of the sampling sites, Miscou Channel, the measured oxygen uptake rate far exceeded the flux calculated from the oxygen gradient. The difference suggests biologically enhanced exchange with the overlying waters at this site, consistent with the greater abundance of benthic organisms. The rate of organic carbon mineralization at the seafloor (1. 6 - 4. 2 　mmol/m 2 /d) was estimated as the sum of the sediment oxygen and nitrate uptake rates. The contribution of other <b>electron-acceptors</b> to the mineralization of organic carbon is assumed to be accounted for by the oxidation of most of their reduced by-products by O 2 and NO 3 -. The return fluxes of dissolved inorganic carbon ([summation operator]CO 2 efflux corrected for carbonate dissolution) were generally comparable to the carbon oxidation rates. A detailed carbon budget was established at one of the sampled stations for which a complete set of measurements is available. The vertical flux of total particulate carbon through the water column (measured with a sediment trap at 150 　m depth) accounts for approximately 9 % of the annual primary production (PP). In the sediment, about 6 % of the PP is remineralized and total carbon equivalent to 4. 5 % PP is buried. The self-consistency of the flux data at this station is used to justify similar budget calculations at the other stations where a limited data set was gathered. Sequestration of organic carbon via burial with the accumulating sediments (on average 0. 5 　mol/m 2 /yr) is partially offset by the release of CO 2 associated with carbonate precipitation and burial (about 0. 2 　mol/m 2 /yr) ...|$|R
