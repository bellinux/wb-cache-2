40|$|The rhizocephalan barnacle, Sacculina carcini, is {{a common}} {{parasite}} of the European shore crab, Carcinus maenas, in which it causes significant detrimental physical and behavioral modifications. In {{the vast majority of}} cases, the external portion of the parasite is present {{in the form of a}} single sac-like externa; in rare cases, double or even triple externae may occur on the same individual host. Here, we use a highly variable DNA marker, the mitochondrial control region (CR), to investigate whether multiple externae in S. carcini represent infection by multiple parasites or asexual cloning developed by a single parasite individual. Sequences for multiple externae from C. maenas hosts from the Danish inlet, Limfjorden, and from the mud <b>flates</b> at Roscoff, France, were compared. In almost all cases, double or triple externae from an individual host yielded different haplotypes. In the few cases where identical haplotypes were identified from externae on a multiple-infected host, this always represented the most commonly found haplotype in the population. This indicates that in Sacculina carcini, the presence of multiple externae on a single host reflects infection by different individual parasites. A haplotype network of CR sequences also suggests a degree of geographical partitioning, with no shared haplotypes between the Limfjorden and Roscoff. Our data represent the first complete CR sequences for a rhizocephalan, and a unique gene order was also revealed. Although the utility of CR sequences for population-level work must be investigated further, the CR has proved a simple to use and highly variable marker for studies of S. carcini and can easily be applied to a variety of studies in this important parasite...|$|R

30|$|The wheel flat is {{a common}} tread defect, which is usually caused by wheel–rail {{abrasion}} during the braking and rolling of wheels {{over long periods of}} time. In service, the <b>flated</b> wheel impact circularly against the rail, resulting in the large wheel–rail impact force and high-frequency vibration, which will bring severe damages to the wheelset, rail and track structure. The accumulation of these damages may be the potential incentive to cause the wheel/rail failure, which brings surely to the disastrous consequence and enormous economic cost. This issue has increasingly become an academic focus in the field of rail transportation. In fact, the wheel flat problem has been widely studied {{over the past few decades}} by field experiments [1, 2, 3, 4], theoretical modeling [5, 6, 7, 8, 9] and finite element simulations [10, 11, 12]. Some conclusions on the influence of different out-of-round (OOR) treads on the vertical dynamic wheel–rail contact force and track response have been obtained from extensive field tests, while a number of theoretical models have been proposed for predicting the flat-induced wheel–rail response via introducing the relative displacement excitation into the Hertzian contact model [5, 6, 7, 8] or via the non-Hertzian contact model based on the Kalker’s variational method [9]. Recently, the finite element simulation has been increasingly employed to investigate the wheel–rail interaction. However, most of early developed numerical models [10, 11, 12] for the wheel–rail impact analyses are unable to well reflect the wheel–rail dynamic contact and real geometry situation of the wheel flat. In the high-speed cases, the dynamic wheel–rail interaction is governed by the inertia of the wheel and rail and is strongly dependent on geometrical, material and contact nonlinearities. Consequently, the wheel–rail rolling contact finite element models [13, 14, 15] were developed to study the wheel–rail interaction.|$|R
40|$|The flame born in {{the deep}} {{interior}} of a white dwarf that becomes a Type Ia supernova is subject to several instabilities, the combination of which determines the observational characteristics of the explosion. We briefly review these instabilities and discuss the length scales for which each dominates. Their cumulative effect is to accelerate {{the speed of the}} flame beyond its laminar value, but that acceleration has uncertain time and angle dependence which has allowed numerous solutions to be proposed (e. g., deflagration, delayed detonation, pulsational deflagration, and pulsational detonation). We discuss the conditions necessary for each of these events and the attendant uncertainties. A grid of critical masses for detonation in the range 10 " 7 - 2 x 10 " 9 g cm"-" 3 is calculated and its sensitivity to composition explored. The conditions for prompt detonation are discussed. Such explosions are physically improbable and appear unlikely on observational grounds. Simple deflagrations require some means of boosting the flame speed beyond what currently exists in the literature. ''Active turbulent combustion'' and multi-point ignition are presented as two plausible ways of doing this. A deflagration that moves at the ''Sharp-Wheeler'' speed, 0. 1 g_e_f_ft, is calculated in one dimension and shows that a healthy explosion is possible in a simple deflagration if fuel can be efficiently burned behind a front that moves with the speed of the fastest <b>flating</b> bubbles generated by the non-linear Rayleigh-Taylor instability. The relevance of the transition to the ''distributed regime'' of turbulent nuclear burning is discussed for delayed and pulsational detonations. This happens when the flame speed has slowed to the point that turbulence can actually penetrate the flame thickness and may be advantageous for producing the high fuel temperatures and gentle temperature gradients necessary for detonation. No model emerges without difficulties, but detonation in the distributed regime is plausible, will produce intermediate mass elements, and warrants further study. The other two leading models, simple deflagration and pulsational detonation, are mutually exclusive. (orig.)
