5|$|The F-FDTL's {{problems}} {{came to a}} head in 2006 when {{almost half}} the force was dismissed following protests over discrimination and poor conditions. The dismissal contributed to a general collapse of both the F-FDTL and PNTL in May and forced the government to request foreign peacekeepers to restore security.

5|$|The need {{to secure}} a {{replacement}} for Melbourne grew as the carrier's age caused the operating costs to increase to over A$25million per year. In June 1977, the Defence <b>Force</b> <b>Development</b> Committee approved an investigation into acquiring a STOVL/helicopter carrier. By August 1979, the decision was limited to three ships: a modified American Iwo Jima-class amphibious assault ship, an Italian Giuseppe Garibaldi-class carrier, and a Sea Control Ship design that later became the Spanish Navy's Principe de Asturias. By February 1981, the Iwo Jima class was the preferred option.|$|E

25|$|However he {{also stated}} that ignorance of radar was fortuitous in the long run. He surmised that had radar been a factor in doctrine, many theorists would have {{reasoned}} that massed defenses would make all strategic air attacks too costly, inhibiting if not entirely suppressing the concepts that proved decisive in World War II and essential {{to the creation of}} the United States Air <b>Force.</b> <b>Development</b> of fighters was not ignored; by October 1940, over a year before Pearl Harbor, every type of piston-driven single-engine fighter used by the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) in World War II had made its first flight except the P-47 Thunderbolt. However, the press of the enormous tasks confronting the Air Corps and the primacy of strategic bombing doctrine meant that development of a long-range capability for these new fighters was not undertaken until combat losses to bombers forced the issue.|$|E
25|$|Following a brief {{tenure as}} Deputy Chief of Naval Staff {{for eight months}} in 1991, Walls was {{appointed}} Maritime Commander Australia during a ceremony aboard his former command, HMAS Tobruk, on 7 November. In this role, {{he was responsible for}} the command of the Australian fleet. While Maritime Commander, Walls also served {{on the board of the}} Young Endeavour Youth Scheme. Advanced to an Officer of the Order of Australia in the Australia Day Honours of 1992, he was made Assistant Chief of Defence <b>Force</b> (<b>Development)</b> in 1994. Walls served in this role for a year, before he was promoted to vice admiral and appointed Vice Chief of the Defence Force (VCDF) on 20 April 1995 in succession to Lieutenant General John Baker, who had been appointed Chief of the Defence Force. Walls' tenure as VCDF coincided with an efficiency review into the Defence organisation, to which he was appointed to the senior review panel. Walls retired from the RAN in March 1997 after 42 years of service, and was succeeded as VCDF by Vice Admiral Chris Barrie.|$|E
25|$|Interactions of cMyBP-C {{with its}} binding {{partners}} vary with its posttranslational modification status. At least three extensively characterized phosphorylation sites (Ser273, 282 and 302; numbering {{refers to the}} mouse sequence) are localized in the M motif of cMyBP-C and are targeted by protein kinases in a hierarchical order of events. In its dephosphorylated state, cMyBP-C binds predominantly to myosin S2 and brakes crossbridge formation, however, when phosphorylated in response to β-adrenergic stimulation through activating cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), it favours binding to actin, then accelerating crossbridge formation, enhancing <b>force</b> <b>development</b> and promoting relaxation. Protein kinases identified thus far to phosphorylate cMyBP-C in the M motif are PKA, Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII), ribosomal s6 kinase (RSK),protein kinase D (PKD), and protein kinase C (PKC). Furthermore, GSK3β was described as another protein kinase to phosphorylate cMyBP-C outside the M-domain in the proline-alanine-rich actin-binding site at Ser133 in human myocardium (mouse Ser131). Phosphorylation is required for normal cardiac function and cMyBP-C stability, and overall phosphorylation levels of cMyBP-C are reduced in human and experimental heart failure. Other posttranslational modifications of cMyBP-C exist, which occur throughout the protein and are not thoroughly characterised yet, such as acetylation, citrullination, S-glutathiolation, S-nitrosylation and carbonylation.|$|E

25|$|Norton {{was called}} to Vietnam himself, {{becoming}} commander of the United States Army Support Command in April 1965. After serving as the Deputy Commanding General of the United States Army Vietnam, Norton commanded the 1st Air Cavalry Division from May 1966 to April 1967. After undergoing a colectomy in June 1967, Norton became the Commanding General of the United States Army Aviation Systems Command, a position he held until September 1969. From October 1969 to October 1970, Norton was the Deputy Director of Modern Army Selected Systems Test Evaluation and Review project ("Project MASSTER") in Fort Hood, Texas, tasked with developing sensors to use in weapons systems in Vietnam. After initially being tasked with the position of <b>Force</b> <b>Development</b> in the Pentagon, Norton was instead made Commanding General of the United States Army Combat Developments Command. Occupying the position until June 1973, Norton assisted in the continued reorganization of the Army, unsuccessfully attempting to preserve the Combat Development Command, which was later reestablished at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. While serving in this position, Norton oversaw the early development of the Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter and M1 Abrams tank. In his final assignment, Norton served as Chief of Staff of the Allied Forces of Southern Europe from June 1963 to August 1975.|$|E
500|$|None {{of these}} {{concepts}} {{appeared to be}} worth deploying, but there was considerable pressure from Congressional groups dominated by hawks who continued to <b>force</b> <b>development</b> of the ABM even when McNamara and President Johnson had not asked for it.

The Air Force continued {{their opposition to the}} ABM concept, having previously criticized their earlier efforts in the press, but the construction of the A-35 ABM systems around Tallinn and Moscow overrode their opposition. The Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) used the Soviet ABM as an argument for deployment, having previously had no strong opinion on the matter.|$|E
