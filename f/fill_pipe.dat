50|$|Problem- An ORVR carbon-filled {{canister}} (installed {{on modern}} vehicles) {{is designed to}} capture fuel vapors displaced while refueling, and then to inject them into the intake manifold later on, {{so that they are}} burned along with the regular fuel, during normal engine operation. However, a Stage II vapor recovery system, installed on refuling gas station pumps, uses a vacuum to prevent fuel vapors from being released into the atmosphere. The design of the <b>fill</b> <b>pipe</b> seal in ORVR systems, prevents fuel vapors from entering the fuel tank <b>fill</b> <b>pipe.</b> That frustrates the purpose of the Stage II nozzle, which was designed to vacuum away any fuel vapors that come up that <b>fill</b> <b>pipe,</b> during the refuelling process. If the car's own vapor recovery system is working properly, then the Stage II nozzle will only be vacuuming normal fresh air and depositing that into the gas station's underground fuel storage tanks. That ends up causing evaporation of fuel vapors into the atmosphere, because too much pressure builds up in those fuel storage tanks. When that pressure becomes too great, it is released into the atmosphere via a pressure relief pipe.|$|E
50|$|The {{variation}} on the gravity pouring technique is to fill the mold using a vacuum. A common form of {{this is called the}} Hitchiner process after the Hitchiner Manufacturing Company that invented the technique. In this technique, the mold has a downward <b>fill</b> <b>pipe</b> that is lowered into the melt. A vacuum draws the melt into the cavity; when the important parts have solidified, the vacuum is released, and the unused material leaves the mold. The technique can use substantially less material than gravity pouring because the sprue and some gating need not solidify.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{different}} types of fuel have specially sized of nozzles to prevent accidentally filling a tank with an incompatible fuel. The nozzle on diesel pumps {{is supposed to be}} larger so that it cannot fit into the filler pipe on a vehicle tank designed for gasoline. However, the larger diameter diesel nozzles are not an actual requirement, and many diesel pumps at auto islands have been fitted with standard gasoline nozzles. Also, the nozzle for leaded gasoline is wider than for unleaded, and the <b>fill</b> <b>pipe</b> on vehicles designed for unleaded-only was made narrower to prevent [...] "mis-fueling". Some diesel fuel tanks are designed to prevent wrong type of nozzle to be used.|$|E

40|$|Key words: {{electromagnetic}} flowmeter; flow measurement; partially <b>filled</b> <b>pipes</b> Abstract: This paper designs {{the electromagnetic}} flowmeter in partially <b>filled</b> <b>pipes</b> (EMF-PF), which sensor sets four electrodes. One pair of the electrodes {{is set on}} the pipe bottom as the signal injection electrodes that inject the AC pulses used to determine liquid fill height. One pair of long-arc electrodes is set on the pipe wall as the measurement electrodes. The measurement electrodes alternate duties, sensing both the flow and fill height signals. Both the flow and fill height raw signals are disposed in different time period by the same signal processing channels. Experiment result shows that the designed EMF-PF can achieve the flow measurement in partially <b>filled</b> <b>pipes,</b> and the measurement accuracy of this EMF-PF meets the actual requirements...|$|R
5000|$|The Oil Storage Regulations (2001) {{apply to}} oil tanks used for {{commercial}} and industrial purposes, or domestic tanks over 3500 litres in capacity. They state that the storage tank should be of [...] "sufficient strength and structural integrity {{to ensure that it}} is unlikely to burst or leak in its ordinary use". The tank, along with any filters, gauges, valves or ancillary equipment, must be contained within a secondary unit or bund which has at least 110% of the capacity of the inner tank. If the tank has a <b>fill</b> <b>pipe</b> that is not contained within the secondary unit, a drip tray must be installed. They also require the use of an automatic overfill prevention if it is not [...] "reasonably practical" [...] to monitor the oil levels within the tank.|$|E
50|$|E85 ethanol {{is used in}} engines {{modified}} to accept higher concentrations of ethanol. In the US such FFVs are designed to run on any mixture of gasoline or ethanol up to 85% ethanol, whereas {{in countries such as}} Brazil where the climate is typically warmer, FFV run on neat alcohol. There are a few major differences between FFVs and non-FFVs. One is the elimination of bare magnesium, aluminum, and rubber parts in the fuel system. Fuel injection control systems have a wider range of pulse widths to inject up to 34% more fuel (which in turn produces more power). Stainless steel fuel lines, sometimes lined with plastic, and stainless-steel fuel tanks in place of terne fuel tanks have been used. In some cases, FFVs use specific engine oil that neutralises acidity. For vehicles with in-tank-mounted fuel pumps, precautions to prevent arcing, as well as flame arrestors positioned in the tank's <b>fill</b> <b>pipe,</b> are sometimes used.|$|E

40|$|The {{flow and}} heat {{transfer}} in <b>pipes</b> <b>filled</b> with metal foams were studied numerically. In this study,the two-equation model based on LNTE (Local Non-Thermal equilibrium) was employed as energy equations,furthermore the flow models extended by Brinkman and Brinkman-Forchheimer were employed as momentum equations respectively,and {{a comparison between}} these two models was made and analysed. The numerical {{results indicate that the}} velocity profiles under two models are different,but their temperature profiles are almost the same as each other,consequently,there are barely differences between the Nu numbers under two models. According to numerical results,the Nu number of metal-foam <b>filled</b> <b>pipes</b> is of the order of magnitude of 102 ～ 103,which is much bigger than that of bare pipes and conventional heat exchangers. The metal-foam <b>filled</b> <b>pipes</b> exhibit excellent heat transfer performance,however high pressure drop is produced at the same time. By using the program for heat transfer calculation of metal foam that is developed by us,someone can make optimization of heat transfer and pressure drop in practical applications...|$|R
40|$|During {{the last}} decades, the weights of trawl boards {{used in the}} North Sea, Norwegian Sea and the Barents Sea have {{increased}} significantly from barely a ton to a score of tons. In addition, the trawling speed has increased as well. These new faster and heavier trawl boards, in an event of impact with subsea structures, will result to tremendous loads on these structures. Impact with existing structures which were designed with recommendation from ISO 13628 - part 1 may be devastating for the subsea structures as the new loads the structures will experience may be greater than its design loads. Model trails performed in the late 80 ´s at a water depth of 100 m, speed at 1, 8 m/s and trawl board weight up to 1 900 kg resulted to an establishment of a design impact energy requirement of 13 kJ [9]. Statoil, {{in response to the}} increase in weight and velocity of trawl boards, raised their impact energy recommendation to 38 kJ. This thesis aims at raising concerns on the level of conservatism in these values given that impact incidence that resulted to no damage at all on a subsea structure have been reported. It is worth mentioning that these structures were designed according to ISO 13628 - part 1, but however the trawl board in this impact had a weight of 4 400 kg. Statoil´s recommendation springs from impact test conducted in air and a theoretical study of the trawling situation for subsea structures from DNV report. The following question arises: Is the Statoil´s recommended design impact energy of 38 kJ too conservative? The goal of this work is to challenge this impact energy recommendation. This will be done by conducting a series of impact test on a copper pipe under the following configurations: - An empty pipe will be impact tested in air. - A closed pipe filled with water will be impact tested in air. - A sealed water <b>fill</b> <b>pipe</b> will be impact tested in water. The result from the following configurations will be analyzed and compared {{in order to determine the}} possible effect of damping (due to water in and out of the structure) on its response, laying ground work for a full scale test...|$|E

40|$|Abstracts. In {{order to}} study dynamic {{characteristics}} of fluid <b>filled</b> <b>pipe</b> under hydraulic excitation force generated actively {{by a new}} developed vibration exciter, at first mathematical model of pulsating fluid was established and a computer code based on the method of characteristics (MOC) was developed. Then the excitation force calculated by MOC was forced upon the corresponding nodes of finite element of pipe, meanwhile, the nodes of fluid by MOC were assured to coincide {{with that of the}} pipe by the method of finite element (FEM). Finally, using Newmark’s method, the dynamic response at every cross section of pipe was solved. The numerical simulations show that a simple harmonic motion arises at every cross section of the pipe. The lateral vibration amplitude of every node along the pipe increases as the rising system pressure. So, this work is expected to provide some theoretical and exploratory basis for studying two dimensional vibration characteristics of fluid <b>filled</b> <b>pipe...</b>|$|R
