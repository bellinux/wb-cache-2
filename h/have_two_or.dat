5|$|Carr Hill compares unfavourably {{with the}} wider Gateshead area {{in respect of}} adults with {{educational}} qualifications. 43.5% of adults have no educational qualifications, compared to 38.4% across the whole of Gateshead and the England average of 28.9%. Only 30.4% of adults have five or more GCSE's or equivalent at A*–C (compared to 36.9% across Gateshead and 47.6% nationally) whilst 13.4% of adults in the suburb <b>have</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> more A-Level's or equivalent.|$|E
5|$|Octopuses use {{camouflage}} when hunting, and {{to avoid}} predators. To do this they use specialised skin cells which change {{the appearance of the}} skin by adjusting its colour, opacity, or reflectivity. Chromatophores contain yellow, orange, red, brown, or black pigments; most species have three of these colours, while some <b>have</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> four. Other colour-changing cells are reflective iridophores and white leucophores. This colour-changing ability is also used to communicate with or warn other octopuses.|$|E
5|$|Chalukyan temples {{fall into}} two {{categories}} – the first being temples with a common mantapa (a colonnaded hall) and two shrines (known as dvikuta), and the second being temples with one mantapa and a single shrine (ekakuta). Both kinds of temples <b>have</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> more entrances giving access to the main hall. This format differs from both the designs of the northern Indian temples, which have a small closed mantapa leading to the shrine and the southern Indian temples which generally have a large, open, columned mantapa.|$|E

5|$|Inflorescences are large, {{branched}} and borne {{among the}} leaves. The inflorescence {{consists of a}} main axis—the peduncle and the rachis—and a series of smaller branches, the rachillae. The rachillae, which bear the flowers, emerge from the rachis. The peduncle is the main stalk, connecting the rachis with the stem. Inflorescences either consist entirely of male flowers, or are predominantly female with a few male flowers. Fruit usually <b>have</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> three seeds, although fewer or more are present in some species, and are usually brown, yellow, orange-brown or purple when mature.|$|E

5|$|Some bathhouses have areas {{designed}} to facilitate impersonal sex. These areasrooms or hallwaysare illuminated {{only by a}} (dim) red exit sign. It is possible to have sex, but not to see with whom. Other bathhouses, such as the Continental Baths in New York or the Club Baths in Washington, D.C., <b>have</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> more bunkbeds in close proximity, in a public area. This provides a place to have sex for those who could afford only a locker, and facilitated exhibitionism and voyeurism for those so inclined. Baths often have a (porn) TV room or snack bar where patrons can recuperate between orgasms.|$|E

5|$|The bovids show great {{variation}} {{in size and}} pelage colouration. Excepting some domesticated forms, all male bovids <b>have</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> more horns, and in many species females possess horns, too. The {{size and shape of}} the horns vary greatly, but the basic structure is always one or more pairs of simple bony protrusions without branches, often having a spiral, twisted or fluted form, each covered in a permanent sheath of keratin. Most bovids bear 30 to 32 teeth.|$|E
5|$|A cold front, {{the leading}} edge of a cooler mass of air, can produce frontal snowsqualls—an intense frontal {{convective}} line (similar to a rainband), when temperature is near freezing at the surface. The strong convection that develops has enough moisture to produce whiteout conditions at places which line passes over as the wind causes intense blowing snow. This type of snowsquall generally lasts less than 30 minutes at any point along its path but the motion of the line can cover large distances. Frontal squalls may form a short distance ahead of the surface cold front or behind the cold front where there may be a deepening low pressure system or a series of trough lines which act similar to a traditional cold frontal passage. In situations where squalls develop post-frontally it is not unusual to <b>have</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> three linear squall bands pass in rapid succession only separated by 25 miles (40 kilometers) with each passing the same point in roughly 30 minutes apart. In cases where there is a large amount of vertical growth and mixing the squall may develop embedded cumulonimbus clouds resulting in lightning and thunder which is dubbed thundersnow.|$|E
5|$|With the Wizards of the Coast {{relaunch}} in 1998 the contents, under editor Kim Mohan, {{became more}} media-focused. The initial {{plan was to}} <b>have</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> three stories per issue based on films, TV, and games. The 600th issue, in early 2000, included a Harlan Ellison story, {{as well as a}} story from the 100th issue, the 200th issue, and so on, up to the 500th issue. Pamela Sargent also contributed a story. The Paizo publishing relaunch, in 2004, was even more focused on media content than the Wizards of the Coast version had been, with much more movie and comics-related material than science fiction. Several well-known authors appeared in the first issue, including Harlan Ellison, Bruce Sterling, and Gene Wolfe. Paizo also ran a blog for the magazine. The fiction received positive reviews, but Paizo soon put the magazine on temporary hold, and canceled it permanently the following year.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is an {{increasingly}} important cause {{of morbidity and mortality}} in the world. The aim of this cross-sectional {{study was to determine the}} prevalence and associated risk factors of pre-diagnosed COPD, over age 40 in the centre of Isparta province. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Data was collected by face-to-face interviews using a structured questionnaire form. RESULTS: According to the results, 272 of the 677 male participants (40 %) and 226 of the 995 female participants (23 %) <b>had</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> more symptoms of COPD (p< 0. 01). In terms of smoking status, 155 of 360 (43 %) smoking participants (who smoke or have smoked in the past) <b>had</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> more symptoms of COPD, whereas only 343 of 1312 non-smoking participants (26 %) <b>had</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> more symptoms of COPD (p< 0. 01). Among the non-smoker’s, 970 participants identified none of the indoor air pollution factors in their home and 147 of them (15 %) <b>had</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> more symptoms of COPD, whereas 213 participants identified at least one air pollution risk factor and 61 of them (27 %) <b>had</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> more symptoms of COPD (p< 0. 01). CONCLUSION: It is suggested that smoking and indoor air pollution are important risk factors of COPD over the age 40 in the centre of Isparta province, Turkey...|$|R
