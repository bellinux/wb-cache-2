More than 1.2 million people from the international community participated, and their names were etched into silicon using an <b>electron-beam</b> <b>machine</b> used for fabricating micro devices at JPL, and this plaque is now installed on the deck of Curiosity. In keeping with a 40-year tradition, a plaque with the signatures of President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden was also installed.

40|$|An {{efficient}} storage format {{was developed}} for computer-generated holograms for use in electron-beam lithography. This method employs run-length encoding and Lempel-Ziv-Welch compression and succeeds in exposing holograms that were previously infeasible owing to the hologram 2 ̆ 7 s tremendous pattern-data file size. These holograms also require significant computation; thus the algorithm was implemented on a parallel computer, which improved performance by 2 orders of magnitude. The decompression algorithm was integrated into the Cambridge <b>electron-beam</b> <b>machine</b> 2 ̆ 7 s front-end processor.

50|$|<b>Electron-beam</b> <b>machining</b> is {{a process}} in which {{high-velocity}} electrons are concentrated into a narrow beam with a very high planar power density. The beam cross-section is then focused and directed toward the work piece, creating heat and vaporizing the material. <b>Electron-beam</b> <b>machining</b> can be used to accurately cut or bore a wide variety of metals. The resulting surface finish is better and kerf width is narrower than what can be produced by other thermal cutting processes. However, due to high equipment costs, the use of this technology is limited to high-value products.|$|R

50|$|The {{effect of}} the {{electron}} beams under such circumstances depends on several conditions, first of all on the physical properties of the material. Any material can be melted, or even evaporated, {{in a very short}} time. Depending on conditions, the intensity of evaporation may vary, from negligible to essential. At lower values of surface power density (in the range of about 103 W/mm2) the loss of material by evaporation is negligible for most metals, which is favorable for welding. At higher power density, the material affected by the beam can totally evaporate in a very short time; this no longer electron-beam welding; it is <b>electron-beam</b> <b>machining.</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{effectiveness}} of the electron beam depends on many factors. The most important are the physical properties of the materials to be welded, especially {{the ease with which}} they can be melted or vaporize under low-pressure conditions. Electron-beam welding can be so intense that loss of material due to evaporation or boiling during the process {{must be taken into account}} when welding.

50|$|Electron-beam welding was {{developed}} by the German physicist Karl-Heinz Steigerwald in 1949, who was at the time working on various electron-beam applications. Steigerwald conceived and developed the first practical <b>electron-beam</b> welding <b>machine,</b> which began operation in 1958. American inventor James T. Russell has also been credited with designing and building the first electron-beam welder.|$|R

Up to now, uncountable numbers of various types of electron-beam equipment have been designed and realized. In most of them the welding takes place in a working vacuum chamber in a high or low vacuum environment.|$|R
40|$|Hardware R&D on the C-band (5712 MHz) RF-system for an electron/positron linear {{collider}} {{started in}} 1996 at KEK. During two years R&D, {{we have developed}} a 50 -MW C-band klystron (TOSHIBA E 3746), a "Smart Modulator", a traveling-wave resonator (TWR) and a cold model of the rf-pulse compressor [1]. A C-band accelerating structure, which uses the choke-mode cavity, is under development. Its HOM damping performance will be tested using short-bunch beams of ASSET beam-line at SLAC in this year. The C-band system is able to accelerate a high-current beam at an accelerating gradient higher than that in a conventional S-band system, therefore, there will be various applications in the future beside the linear collider. For example, we can build an injector for a SR-ring and for various physics experiments within a short site-length. Additionally, since the C-band components are compact, it has a big potentiality to be widely used in various medical and industrial applications, such as an <b>electron-beam</b> radiotherapy <b>machine,</b> or a compact non-destructive X-ray imaging system. ...|$|R
40|$|Since the {{beginning}} of micro-optics fabrication most of the used technologies have been adapted from or are related to semiconductor fabrication techniques. These are widely known and the special microelectronics fabrication tools, especially lithography machines, are available at numerous places. Besides the fact that therefore micro-optics was able to {{took advantage of the}} steady development of semiconductor technology this tight linkage has also a lot of drawbacks. The adaptation of element properties to the fabrication limits given by the available technologies is very often connected with compromises in optical performance. In nowadays micro-optics fabrication has reached a level which justifies the development of fabrication tools specialized to its own demands. In the article the special demands of optical microstructures on the fabrication technologies are discussed and newly developed mico-optics fabrication tools are introduced. The first one is an <b>electron-beam</b> lithography <b>machine</b> for use with up substrates up to 300 mm large and 15 mm thick achieving a very high overlay accuracy and writing speed. The second one is a laser-lithography system capable to expose micro-optical structures onto non-planar substrates...|$|R
40|$|With {{a view to}} {{the goal}} of net energy {{production}} from a DT microexplosion, two ideas (methods) are studied through which (separately or in combination) energy may be ''concentrated'' into a small volume and short period of time [...] the so-called space-time energy densification or compression. The advantages and disadvantages of lasers and relativistic <b>electron-beam</b> (E-beam) <b>machines</b> as the sources of such energy are studied and the amplification of laser pulses as a key factor in energy compression is discussed. The pulse length of present relativistic E-beam machines is the most serious limitation of this pulsed-power source. The first energy-compression idea discussed is the reasonably efficient production of short-duration, high-current relativistic electron pulses by the self interruption and restrike of a current in a plasma pinch due to the rapid onset of strong turbulence. A 1 -MJ plasma focus based on this method is nearing completion at this Laboratory. The second energy- compression idea is based on laser-pulse production through the parametric amplification of a self-similar or solitary wave pulse, for which analogs can be found in other wave processes. Specifically, the second energy-compression idea is a proposal for parametric amplification of a solitary, transverse magnetic pulse in a coaxial cavity with a Bennett dielectric rod as an inner coax. Amplifiers of this type can be driven by the pulsed power from a relativistic E- beam machine. If the end of the inner dielectric coax is made of LiDT or another fusionable material, the amplified pulse can directly drive a fusion reaction [...] there would be no need to switch the pulse out of the system toward a remote target.

40|$|A report {{discusses}} {{the design of}} the rocker-bogie suspensions of the Mars Exploration Rover vehicles, which were landed on Mars in January 2004. Going beyond the basic requirements regarding mobility on uneven terrain, the design had to satisfy requirements (1) to enable each suspension to contort so that the rover could be stowed within limited space in a tetrahedral lander prior to deployment and (2) that the suspension be able to absorb appreciable impact loads, with limited deflection, during egress from the lander and traversal of terrain. For stowability, six joints (three on the right, three on the left) were added to the basic rocker-bogie mechanism. One of the joints on each side was a yoke-and-clevis joint at the suspension/differential interface, one was a motorized twist joint in the forward portion of the rocker, and one was a linear joint created by modifying a fixed-length bogie member into a telescoping member. For absorption of impact, the structural members were in the form of box beams made by <b>electron-beam</b> welding of <b>machined,</b> thin-walled, C-channel, titanium components. The box beams were very lightweight and could withstand high bending and torsional loads...|$|R
