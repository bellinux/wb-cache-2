5|$|Although {{this portion}} of NY441 is {{surrounded}} by woodlands, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>actually</b> located in a largely developed area of Penfield known locally as Panorama. The woods cease as NY441 approaches an interchange with Panorama Trail (NY153), the lone limited-access junction along the divided highway. East of NY153, NY441 crosses over Irondequoit Creek and downgrades to a four-lane undivided highway at a junction with Penfield Road. Here, Route441 becomes Penfield Road and enters the densely populated hamlet of Penfield.|$|E
5|$|Burns talks Homer into {{cheating}} {{and they}} use a snowmobile to reach the cabin. Arriving early, they settle down in the comfortable surroundings and quickly become friends. While clinking their champagne glasses, they inadvertently cause an avalanche that buries the entire cabin. The two make several attempts at escaping but are unsuccessful.

5|$|A classic {{result of}} graph theory states that a graph of odd order (having an odd number of vertices) always {{has at least}} one vertex of even degree. (The {{statement}} itself requires zero to be even: the empty graph has an even order, and an isolated vertex has an even degree.) In order to prove the statement, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>actually</b> easier to prove a stronger result: any odd-order graph has an odd number of even degree vertices. The appearance of this odd number is explained by a still more general result, known as the handshaking lemma: any graph has an even number of vertices of odd degree. Finally, the even number of odd vertices is naturally explained by the degree sum formula.|$|E
5|$|A heart {{condition}} uncommon to the breed is tetralogy of Fallot, {{which is more}} common in the Keeshond and English Bulldog breeds relatively. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>actually</b> a combination of up to four conditions, including the previously mentioned pulmonary valve stenosis, with a secondary condition of right ventricular hypertrophy. The other conditions are ventricular septal defect which is a defect or hole in the wall of the heart between the two ventricles and the aorta which carries the blood from the left to {{the right side of the}} heart can be mis-positioned. The effect on the dog depends on the severity of the condition, and can range from a heart murmur through to reduced activity levels to death. Symptoms in puppies are generally a failure to grow and a reduced tolerance for exercise. Active treatment is effective in around 50% of cases.|$|E

5|$|At low forward speeds, the {{precession}} of {{the front}} wheel is too quick, contributing to an uncontrolled bike’s tendency to oversteer, start to lean {{the other way and}} eventually oscillate and fall over. At high forward speeds, the precession is usually too slow, contributing to an uncontrolled bike’s tendency to understeer and eventually fall over without ever having reached the upright position. This instability is very slow, on the order of seconds, and is easy for most riders to counteract. Thus a fast bike may feel stable even though <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>actually</b> not self-stable and would fall over if it were uncontrolled.|$|E
5|$|Berzelius {{made some}} initial characterisations {{of the new}} metal and its {{chemical}} compounds: he correctly determined that the thorium–oxygen mass ratio of thorium oxide was 7.5 (its actual value is close to that, ~7.3), but he assumed the new element was divalent rather than tetravalent, and so calculated that the atomic mass was 7.5 times that of oxygen (120 amu); <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>actually</b> 15 times as large. He determined that thorium was a very electropositive metal, ahead of cerium and behind zirconium in electropositivity. Metallic thorium was isolated {{for the first time}} in 1914 by Dutch entrepreneurs Dirk Lely Jr. and Lodewijk Hamburger.|$|E
5|$|Capella {{is closer}} to the north {{celestial}} pole than any other first magnitude star. Its northern declination is such that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>actually</b> invisible south of latitude 44°S—this includes southernmost New Zealand, Argentina and Chile as well as the Falkland Islands. Conversely it is circumpolar north of 44°N: for the whole of the United Kingdom, Canada and the northernmost United States, the star never sets. Capella and Vega are {{on opposite sides of the}} pole, at about the same distance from it, such that an imaginary line between the two stars will nearly pass through Polaris. Visible halfway between the Belt of Orion and Polaris, Capella is at its highest in the night sky at midnight in early December and is regarded as a prominent star of the winter sky in the northern hemisphere.|$|E

5|$|Following Ruisdael's trip to Germany, his landscapes {{took on a}} more heroic character, with forms {{becoming}} {{larger and}} more prominent. A view of Bentheim Castle, dated 1653, {{is just one of}} a dozen of Ruisdael's depictions of a particular castle in Germany, almost all of which pronounce its position on a hilltop. Significantly, Ruisdael made numerous changes to the castle's setting (<b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>actually</b> on an unimposing low hill) culminating in a 1653 version which shows it on a wooded mountain. These variations are considered by art historians to be evidence of Ruisdael's compositional skills.|$|E
5|$|Homer and Bart {{rent the}} film Paint Your Wagon, expecting {{it to be}} a shoot-em-up Western. Homer is dismayed to find out that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>actually</b> a musical, and expresses his distaste for such films. Marge is baffled by this, saying that he {{ironically}} loves singing. The family starts delivering their dialogue in song form, and Marge decides to prove that Homer loves to sing by showing family videos. Several clips are shown of various songs from past episodes, but Homer is not convinced. At this moment, Snake breaks into their house and holds them hostage. However once he hears them singing, Snake decides that they would not make good hostages and leaves.|$|E
5|$|Its {{status in}} the history of Danish {{photography}} is rivalled by a portrait of Bertel Thorvaldsen sitting at an easel outside his studio in the garden of the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts at Charlottenborg Palace in Copenhagen. This daguerrotype was taken by the French photographer Aymard Charles Théodore Neubourg, who visited Copenhagen in the summer of 1840. An examination of the circumstances under which it was taken reveals that the date was Sunday, 26 July 1840. It has also been noticed that Thorvaldsen is making the horn sign with what apparently is his left hand although, {{as a result of the}} daguerrotype mirror effect, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>actually</b> his right hand. This has been ascribed to the anxiety he must have experienced while facing the new mechanical device which could reveal even the slightest detail.|$|E

5|$|Kepler-14 is {{a binary}} star system, {{which means that}} <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>actually</b> {{composed}} of two gravitationally bound stars that orbit a common point in space. The system is composed of a primary star, Kepler-14A, and a dimmer companion star, Kepler-14B. When the stars were observed, while searching for the planet Kepler-14b, the angular separation of the binary system made it extremely difficult to note the dimmer companion star. The stars have such a wide orbit that it takes approximately 2800 years for each star to complete a revolution around the centroid. The two stars are located approximately 980 parsecs (3,196 light years) from Earth.|$|E
5|$|Philosopher G. H. R. Parkinson notes {{a common}} {{objection}} to Kant's argument: that {{what ought to}} be done does not necessarily entail that it is possible. He also argues that alternative conceptions of morality exist which do not rely on the assumptions that Kant makes – he cites utilitarianism as an example which does not require the summum bonum. Nicholas Everitt argues that much moral guidance is unattainable, such as the Biblical command to be Christ-like. He proposes that Kant's first two premises only entail that we must try to achieve the perfect good, not that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>actually</b> attainable.|$|E

He pursues Müller and his accomplice Ivan and along the way, Thompson and Thomson try to arrest him again, but he convinces them to follow him. When Müller takes a plane north, Tintin and Snowy try to follow, but hit a storm and crash land in rural Scotland.
