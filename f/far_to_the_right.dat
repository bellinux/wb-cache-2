Florida State was held three-and-out and punted. The Terrapins again pushed down field, before, on fourth and four on the Florida State 27-yard line, elected to attempt a field goal. Obi Egekeze's 44-yard attempt went wide of the uprights <b>far</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>right.</b>|$|E
5|$|At 8:10am Captain Brown {{ordered a}} course change to 060degrees and {{informed}} {{the men that}} the conn for the battleship would remain on the eighth-level bridge until they cleared the course. This was unusual for Missouri, as the conn was usually shifted to the fourth-level bridge during the transit at the point when a ship passed Fort Wool and Old Point Comfort. The initial course change to 060 was altered to 058 {{as a result of}} a strong ocean current that swung Missouri too <b>far</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> during the course correction.|$|E

25|$|Following the 2004 election, Harris was {{challenged}} for the leadership by Tom Manley, a prominent party activist from eastern Ontario. Manley argued that Harris was shifting the GPC too <b>far</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>right,</b> and was abandoning the party's traditional emphasis on local production {{in favour of}} greater accommodation with corporate interests. Harris won re-election as GPC leader in August 2004 on the first ballot count, though by a narrower margin than before. Manley was later appointed deputy leader, but left the GPC in 2005 to join the Liberals.|$|E
25|$|The two mummies of {{the younger}} girls have not been opened as yet. In the early 1990s they were {{examined}} by using modern techniques. The portrait of the older girl, probably the middle one among the three daughters of Aline and her husband, resembles that of her mother. Since it is still attached to her mummy, it is less clearly visible at present; additionally, it has been attached somewhat too <b>far</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> of the window-like opening in the wrapping. As with the other children and the man, her name is unknown. She wears valuable but simple jewellery and has a ringlet hairstyle.|$|E
25|$|John Anderson won 6.6% of {{the popular}} vote but failed to win any state outright. He found the most support in New England, fueled by liberal Republicans who felt Reagan was too <b>far</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>right.</b> His best showing was in Massachusetts, where he won 15% {{of the popular}} vote. Conversely, Anderson {{performed}} worst in the South, receiving under 2% {{of the popular vote}} in South Carolina, Louisiana, Alabama, and Mississippi. Anderson claims that he was accused of spoiling the election for Carter by receiving votes that might have otherwise been cast for Carter. However, 37 percent of Anderson voters polled preferred Reagan as their second choice.|$|E

25|$|In the AFC Divisional Playoffs, the Chargers {{managed to}} {{overcome}} a 21–6 halftime deficit to defeat the Miami Dolphins, 22–21. In the first half, San Diego was limited to only two John Carney field goals, while Miami quarterback Dan Marino threw for over 180 yards and 3 touchdowns. However, the Chargers dominated the Dolphins in the second half, limiting their offense to just 16 plays. In the third quarter, after being stopped on fourth and goal at the 1-yard line, Chargers defensive lineman Reuben Davis tackled Dolphins running back Bernie Parmalee {{in the end zone}} for a safety. San Diego then took the ensuing free kick and marched 54 yards to score on Means' 24-yard touchdown run. Then with time running out, Humphries threw an 8-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Mark Seay, giving his team a one-point lead. The Dolphins, aided by a pass interference call, responded with a drive to the Chargers' 31-yard line, but kicker Pete Stoyanovich's potential game-winning 48-yard field goal attempt sailed <b>far</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> of the goal posts and sealed San Diego's stirring win.|$|E
25|$|At 17:00, the gunnery {{sergeant}} of Company F {{reported in}} {{person to the}} battalion command post. Company F had moved out as ordered from its reserve position to the lines held by Company E, however, had veered too <b>far</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> and had missed Company E entirely. Company F proceeded onward and found itself in a position behind the Japanese lines. It was reported by the gunnery sergeant that Rapp had found {{it increasingly difficult to}} control his company, suffering some casualties and platoons intermingling and becoming disorganized. The gunnery sergeant was ordered to go back to Company F and guide it back to the battalion position. By 17:45, Company F was back in the battalion lines and had taken a position on the perimeter which was set up for the night. At 18:30, communications were reestablished and the artillery of the 12th Marine Regiment was ordered establish pre-designated fire zones north, east, and west sides of the 2nd Battalion, 21st Marines' perimeter. The 2nd Marine Raiders Battalion—attached to the 21st Marine Regiment—was directed to protect the supply line from the main line of resistance to the 2nd Battalion, 21st Marines. Ames ordered Smoak to send out patrols and prepare to attack the Japanese positions in the morning, with tank, artillery, and aircraft support.|$|E

[...] He told the Amsterdam News, [...] "Black folks need to consider a mass exodus from the Democratic Party and build a new party of their own, because the Democrats have turned their backs on them on too many occasions.

2500|$|Therefore, {{since the}} {{tertiary}} carbocation is relatively stable and therefore close in {{energy to the}} R-X reactant, then the tertiary transition state will have a structure that is fairly similar to the R-X reactant. [...] In terms of the graph of reaction coordinate versus energy, this is shown {{by the fact that}} the tertiary transition state is further to the left than the other transition states. [...] In contrast, the energy of a methyl carbocation is very high, and therefore the structure of the transition state is more similar to the intermediate carbocation than to the R-X reactant. Accordingly, the methyl transition state is very <b>far</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>right.</b>|$|E

[...] Although a conservative, [...] "behind the scenes many Democrats considered Rubio someone with whom they could work," [...] according to biographer Manuel Roig-Franzia. Dan Gelber of Miami, the House Democratic leader {{at the time of}} Rubio's speakership, considered him [...] "a true conservative" [...] but not [...] "a reflexive partisan," [...] saying: [...] "He didn't have an objection to working with the other side simply because they were the other side. To put it bluntly, he wasn't a jerk." [...] Gelber considered Rubio [...] "a severe conservative, really <b>far</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>right,</b> but probably the most talented spokesman the severe right could ever hope for." ...|$|E
