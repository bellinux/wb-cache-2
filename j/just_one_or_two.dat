25|$|Optimization will {{generally}} focus on improving <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> aspects of performance: execution time, memory usage, disk space, bandwidth, power consumption {{or some other}} resource. This will usually require a trade-offnbsp&— where one factor is optimized {{at the expense of}} others.

Structures in settlements have not revealed much differentiation, nor was there much difference in size or character between settlements, facts that suggest they probably had a poorly developed social hierarchy for a significant stretch of their history. Some, but not all, settlements were surrounded by stone walls. They built mud-brick houses, originally round, but later developing into subrectangular designs with structures of <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> rooms, multiple rooms centered around an open space, or rectilinear designs.|$|E

25|$|Sharp {{played as}} a {{right-handed}} middle-order batsman; as an amateur, he acted as captain of Leicestershire {{many times over}} his long career, and was official captain in 1921 and for part of 1922. A solicitor, Sharp never played a full season, but he appeared in first-class matches in every season from 1908 to 1935 {{with the exception of}} 1925. Most of his first-class cricket was concentrated into the years either side of the First World War: from 1926 onwards, he played in most years <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> matches and he passed 50 only once in the 10 seasons before his very last appearance in 1935.|$|E
25|$|Aphasia is best {{thought of}} as a {{collection}} of different disorders, rather than a single problem. Each individual with aphasia will present with their own particular combination of language strengths and weaknesses. Consequently, it is a major challenge just to document the various difficulties that can occur in different people, let alone decide how they might best be treated. Most classifications of the aphasias tend to divide the various symptoms into broad classes. A common approach is to distinguish between the fluent aphasias (where speech remains fluent, but content may be lacking, and the person may have difficulties understanding others), and the nonfluent aphasias (where speech is very halting and effortful, and may consist of <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> words at a time).|$|E

25|$|A {{total of}} about 27,000 people {{received}} ECT in 1980. The authors of the survey estimated that ECT use had approximately halved since the early 1970s. There was wide regional variation, with the heaviest user, Jersey and Guernsey, using ECT at more than 5 {{times the rate of}} the lowest user, the Oxford region. There was a 17 fold difference in rates of ECT use between different hospitals and in many hospitals a large proportion of ECT was given by <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> psychiatrists. Some psychiatrists didn’t use ECT at all; others thought that the main, or even the only, indication for ECT was in psychotic or endogenous depression; yet others thought it appropriate in the treatment {{of a wide range of}} disorders. The median age of patients was mid-fifties. About 900 people over 80, and about 420 people under 20, were given ECT in 1980. 69 per cent were women. 21 per cent were treated with unilateral ECT.|$|E
25|$|Concerning the {{practice}} of psalm recitation, the recitation by a congregation of educated chanters is already testified by the soloistic recitation of abridged psalms {{by the end of}} the 4th century. Later it was called prokeimenon. Hence, there was an early practice of simple psalmody, which was used for the recitation of canticles and the psalter, and usually Byzantine psalters have the 15 canticles in an appendix, but the simple psalmody itself was not notated before the 13th century, in dialogue or papadikai treatises preceding the book sticheraria. Later books, like the akolouthiai and some psaltika, also contain the elaborated psalmody, when a protopsaltes recited <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> psalm verses. Between the recited psalms and canticles troparia were recited according to the same more or less elaborated psalmody. This context relates antiphonal chant genres including antiphona (kind of introits), trisagion and its substitutes, prokeimenon, allelouiarion, the later cherubikon and its substitutes, the koinonikon cycles as they were created during the 9th century. In most of the cases they were simply troparia and their repetitions or segments were given by the antiphonon, whether it was sung or not, its three sections of the psalmodic recitation were separated by the troparion.|$|E

25|$|Khan {{continued}} {{to act in}} <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> films a year, then an unusual trait for a mainstream Hindi cinema actor. His only release in 1996 was the Dharmesh Darshan-directed commercial blockbuster Raja Hindustani, {{in which he was}} paired opposite Karisma Kapoor. The film earned him his first Filmare Award for Best Actor, after seven previous nominations, and {{went on to become the}} biggest hit of the year, as well as the third-highest grossing Indian film of the 1990s. Khan's career seemed to hit a plateau at this point of time, and most of the films to follow for the next few years were only partially successful. In 1997, he co-starred alongside Ajay Devgn, Kajol and Juhi Chawla in Ishq, which performed well at the box office. The following year, Khan appeared in the moderately successful Ghulam, for which he also did playback singing. John Mathew Matthan's Sarfarosh, Khan's first release in 1999, was also moderately successful, gaining an above average box office verdict. The film and Khan's role in it were highly appreciated by movie critics, as was his role in Deepa Mehta's art house film Earth. His first release for the new millennium, Mela, in which he acted alongside his real-life brother Faisal Khan, was both a box office and critical bomb.|$|E
25|$|After its subjugation, {{the state}} of Xu was forced to remain a vassal of the Zhou dynasty for almost one hundred years. The turning point came in the mid 10th century BC: Around 957 BC, the Zhou dynasty lost a {{disastrous}} war against Chu. This defeat appears to have thrown the dynasty into chaos. Based on archaeological findings, Edward L. Shaughnessy even speculates that the Zhou dynasty was so weakened that it largely retreated to its capital area, leaving most of its empire to fend for itself. Building upon this theory, Manfred Frühauf believes that the Huaiyi, among them Xu, regained their independence as consequence of this general Zhou retreat. Regardless of whether this was the case, by 944 BC, Xu and the Huaiyi had definitely regained their independence, as Lord Yan of Xu managed to unite thirty-six Dongyi and Huaiyi states under his leadership, declared himself king and proceeded to invade the Zhou empire. The reasons for this invasion are unknown, but Frühauf speculates {{that it was a}} preventive strike to prevent the Zhou from restoring their domination over the Huaiyi, while Sawyer considers it possible that the Xu either wanted to plunder the Zhou royal domain or aimed to supplant the Zhou rule and establish their own dynasty. The course and scale of the invasion are equally controversial, based on different interpretations of bronze inscriptions and historical texts. It is even disputed if there was <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> invasions. Generally agreed, however, {{is the result of the}} attacks: Even though the Zhou forces had eventually succeeded in driving the invaders back, they could not subjugate the Huaiyi again and were forced to acknowledge their independence in a peace treaty. If records in the Book of the Later Han, probably based upon early texts of the Bamboo Annals, are to believed, Xu was particularly strengthened by the war. Recognizing that he could not defeat the Huaiyi, King Mu of Zhou recognized King Yan of Xu as overlord over a large confederation that covered most of the Huai River valley and regions south of it. As result, Xu became the new major power of the east and a serious political rival to the Zhou dynasty. The Zuo Zhuan suggests that this confederation also included the remaining Xu enclaves in western Shandong. In the course of its political ascent, Xu's cultural influence began to spread as far as the Yangtze delta region.|$|E

50|$|Many {{elements}} are often alloyed with steel. The main purpose for alloying most elements with steel {{is to increase}} its hardenability and to decrease softening under temperature. Tool steels, for example, may have elements like chromium or vanadium added to increase both toughness and strength, which is necessary for things like wrenches and screwdrivers. On the other hand, drill bits and rotary files need to retain their hardness at high temperatures. Adding cobalt or molybdenum can cause the steel to retain its hardness, even at red-hot temperatures, forming high-speed steels.
