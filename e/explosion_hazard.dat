5|$|As {{a powder}} {{or in the}} form of metal shavings, {{titanium}} metal poses a significant fire hazard and, when heated in air, an <b>explosion</b> <b>hazard.</b> Water and carbon dioxide are ineffective for extinguishing a titanium fire; Class D dry powder agents must be used instead.|$|E
5|$|Like many powders, {{dysprosium}} powder {{may present}} an <b>explosion</b> <b>hazard</b> when {{mixed with air}} and when an ignition source is present. Thin foils of the substance can also be ignited by sparks or by static electricity. Dysprosium fires cannot be put out by water. It can react with water to produce flammable hydrogen gas. Dysprosium chloride fires, however, can be extinguished with water, while dysprosium fluoride and dysprosium oxide are non-flammable. Dysprosium nitrate, Dy(NO3)3, is a strong oxidizing agent and will readily ignite on contact with organic substances.|$|E
30|$|Town {{industrial}} <b>explosion</b> <b>hazards</b> mainly involve chemical leak accidents, {{which are}} often caused by either technical failures or human mistakes (Jin 2000). Therefore, the following sections discuss how to handle and prevent <b>explosion</b> <b>hazards</b> {{from the perspective of}} management.|$|R
50|$|The {{health and}} safety hazards of {{nanomaterials}} include the potential toxicity of various types of nanomaterials, as well as fire and dust <b>explosion</b> <b>hazards.</b> Because nanotechnology is a recent development, the {{health and safety}} effects of exposures to nanomaterials, and what levels of exposure may be acceptable, are subjects of ongoing research. Of the possible hazards, inhalation exposure appears to present the most concern, with animal studies showing pulmonary effects such as inflammation, fibrosis, and carcinogenicity for some nanomaterials. Skin contact and ingestion exposure, and dust <b>explosion</b> <b>hazards,</b> are also a concern.|$|R
30|$|In {{examining}} {{safety problems}} confronting town industrial development and analyzing {{the importance of}} industrial <b>explosion</b> <b>hazards</b> control, this article proposes work safety planning improvement and work safety management as key measures. Because governments of higher levels and line authorities in charge have more resources in terms of management, skills, and coordination, they are more capable of effectively preventing and handling major explosive hazards. Multilevel management of industrial <b>explosion</b> <b>hazards</b> makes objectives and duties clear and authorities more accountable. Some sectors and companies have applied this management method in their operation, which has produced favorable results in return.|$|R
5|$|Natural {{ytterbium}} is {{a mixture}} of seven stable isotopes, which altogether are present at concentrations of 3 parts per million. This element is mined in China, the United States, Brazil, and India in form of the minerals monazite, euxenite, and xenotime. The ytterbium concentration is low because it is found only among many other rare earth elements; moreover, it is among the least abundant. Once extracted and prepared, ytterbium is somewhat hazardous as an eye and skin irritant. The metal is a fire and <b>explosion</b> <b>hazard.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{characteristic}} {{features of}} tungsten deposition from the WF6/SiH4 are high speed, good adhesion and layer smoothness. The drawbacks are <b>explosion</b> <b>hazard</b> and high {{sensitivity of the}} deposition rate and morphology to the process parameters, such as mixing ratio, substrate temperature, etc. Therefore, silane is commonly {{used to create a}} thin tungsten nucleation layer. It is then switched to hydrogen, that slows down the deposition and cleans up the layer.|$|E

30|$|The {{industrial}} <b>explosion</b> <b>hazards</b> {{control mechanism}} consists of disaster monitoring and forecasting, disaster relief, and post-disaster recovery components. It {{is recommended that}} each administrative area sets up a special organization {{to deal with the}} industrial <b>explosion</b> <b>hazards</b> within its borders and to improve cooperation with other regions. A contingency capability appraisal system should be created based on each area’s industrial explosion threats, the perceived vulnerability of its public service systems (for example, water supply system) and existing or proposed emergency management skills. Cooperation and joint action should be strengthened among various government organizations, between governments and nongovernmental organizations, at the interface between government and the media, as well as between governments and research institutions. An effective disaster control system will enable better allocation of disaster relief resources and make sharing information both possible and more frequently attained.|$|R
25|$|Coal dust is {{responsible}} for the lung disease known as pneumoconiosis, including black lung disease that occurs among coal miners. The danger of coal dust resulted in environmental legislation regulating work place air quality in some jurisdictions. In addition, if enough coal dust is dispersed within the air in a given area, in very rare circumstances, it can create an <b>explosion</b> <b>hazard</b> under certain circumstances. These circumstances are typically within confined spaces.|$|E
25|$|Other {{issues to}} surface during {{disposal}} operations were {{high levels of}} mercury contamination and the tendency of the aluminum casing to explode inside the decontamination furnace. Molten aluminum and water presents a potential <b>explosion</b> <b>hazard</b> and because the Weteye contained a liquid nerve agent the potential for an interaction of molten aluminum and the liquid agent existed. These issues combined to make the Weteye sufficiently difficult to dispose of that it required special handling.|$|E
25|$|In the U.S., OSHA lists vinyl {{chloride}} as a Class IA Flammable Liquid, with a National Fire Protection Association Flammability Rating of 4. Because of its low boiling point, liquid VCM will undergo flash evaporation (i.e., autorefrigerate) upon its release to atmospheric pressure. The portion vaporized will form a dense cloud (more {{than twice as}} heavy as the surrounding air). The risk of subsequent explosion or fire is significant. According to OSHA, the flash point of {{vinyl chloride}} is −78°C (−108.4°F). Its flammable limits in air are: lower 3.6 volume% and upper 33.0 volume%. The explosive limits are: lower 4.0%, upper 22.05 by volume in air. Fire may release toxic hydrogen chloride (HCl) and carbon monoxide (CO). VCM can polymerise rapidly due to heating and {{under the influence of}} air, light and contact with a catalyst, strong oxidisers and metals such as copper and aluminium, with fire or <b>explosion</b> <b>hazard.</b> As a gas mixed with air, VCM is a fire and <b>explosion</b> <b>hazard.</b> On standing VCM can form peroxides, which may then explode. VCM will react with iron and steel in the presence of moisture. Vinyl chloride is a gas at normal atmospheric temperature and pressure.|$|E
5|$|Highly {{concentrated}} {{sources of}} oxygen promote rapid combustion. Fire and <b>explosion</b> <b>hazards</b> exist when concentrated oxidants and fuels are brought into close proximity; an ignition event, such as heat or a spark, {{is needed to}} trigger combustion. Oxygen is the oxidant, not the fuel, but nevertheless the source {{of most of the}} chemical energy released in combustion.|$|R

50|$|The Zasyadko Mine {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{dangerous}} coal mines in the world due to naturally high levels of gas (particularly methane) and coal dust <b>explosion</b> <b>hazards.</b> Additionally, gradual exhaustion made the mine as large as having 6 shafts and, most importantly, very deep. As of 2004, depths of excavation varied from 529m to 1270m.|$|R
25|$|A fire {{extinguisher}} {{is an active}} fire protection device used to extinguish or control small fires, often in emergency situations. It is not intended for use on an out-of-control fire, such as one which has reached the ceiling, endangers the user (i.e., no escape route, smoke, <b>explosion</b> <b>hazard,</b> etc.), or otherwise requires the expertise of a fire department. Typically, a {{fire extinguisher}} consists of a hand-held cylindrical pressure vessel containing an agent which can be discharged to extinguish a fire. Fire extinguishers manufactured with non-cylindrical pressure vessels also exist, but are less common.|$|E
25|$|Some engines use air or {{nitrogen}} as {{the working}} fluid. These gases have much lower power density (which increases engine costs), {{but they are}} more convenient to use and they minimize the problems of gas containment and supply (which decreases costs). The use of compressed air in contact with flammable materials or substances such as lubricating oil introduces an <b>explosion</b> <b>hazard,</b> because compressed air contains a high partial pressure of oxygen. However, oxygen can be removed from air through an oxidation reaction or bottled nitrogen can be used, which is nearly inert and very safe.|$|E
25|$|Percentage {{reading on}} {{combustible}} air monitors {{should not be}} confused with the LEL concentrations. Explosimeters designed and calibrated to a specific gas may show the relative concentration of the atmosphere to the LEL—the LEL being 100%. A 5% displayed LEL reading for methane, for example, would be equivalent to 5% multiplied by 5.0%, or approximately 0.25% methane by volume at 20 degrees C. Control of the <b>explosion</b> <b>hazard</b> is usually achieved by sufficient natural or mechanical ventilation, to limit the concentration of flammable gases or vapors to a maximum level of 25% of their lower explosive or flammable limit.|$|E

40|$|Manmade {{disasters}} due to accidental {{explosions in}} fireworks industries {{are a common}} one in Sivakasi town of Tamilnadu. With around 450 firework factories employing about 40000 direct labours and 100000 indirect labours, an equal proportion of unauthorized manufacturing sector is controlling the manufacturing of firework products. Due to the accidental explosions during the manufacturing process, loss of men, material, money and infrastructure is reported regularly. Hence, an attempt is made to identify the nature of <b>explosion</b> <b>hazards</b> by conducting questionnaire survey in fireworks industries. The survey was conducted in 77 authorized industries and 16 unauthorized firework industrial areas, which aimed at studying the status of working environment, type of construction and other social factors of firework industries. The survey concludes with the recommendation {{for the construction of}} an explosion resistant industrial estate for the firework industries with necessary infrastructure facilities for the rehabilitation of unauthorized industries, considering the <b>explosion</b> <b>hazards</b> and the Socio-economic and environmental factors...|$|R
25|$|Discovered in 1831 by an American {{physician}} Samuel Guthrie (1782–1848), and independently a {{few months}} later by Frenchman Eugène Soubeiran (1797–1859) and Justus von Liebig (1803–73) in Germany, chloroform was named and chemically characterised in 1834 by Jean-Baptiste Dumas (1800–84). Its anaesthetic properties were noted early in 1847 by Marie-Jean-Pierre Flourens (1794–1867). The use of chloroform in anesthesia is linked to James Young Simpson, who, in a wide-ranging study of organic compounds, found chloroform's efficacy on 4 November 1847. Its use spread quickly and gained royal approval in 1853 when John Snow gave it to Queen Victoria during the birth of Prince Leopold. Unfortunately, though free of ether's flammability and consequent <b>explosion</b> <b>hazard,</b> chloroform is not as safe pharmacologically, especially when administered by an untrained practitioner (medical students, nurses, and occasionally members of the public were often pressed into giving anesthetics at this time). This led to many deaths from the use of chloroform that (with hindsight) might have been preventable. The first fatality directly attributed to chloroform anesthesia was recorded on 28 January 1848 after the death of Hannah Greener.|$|E
25|$|Methanogenic archaea are {{responsible}} for all biological sources of methane. Some live in symbiotic relationships with other life forms, including termites, ruminants, and cultivated crops. Other sources of methane, the principal component of natural gas, include landfill gas, biogas, and methane hydrate. When methane-rich gases are produced by the anaerobic decay of non-fossil organic matter (biomass), these {{are referred to as}} biogas (or natural biogas). Sources of biogas include swamps, marshes, and landfills, as well as agricultural waste materials such as sewage sludge and manure by way of anaerobic digesters, in addition to enteric fermentation, particularly in cattle. Landfill gas is created by decomposition of waste in landfill sites. Excluding water vapor, about half of landfill gas is methane and most of the rest is carbon dioxide, with small amounts of nitrogen, oxygen, and hydrogen, and variable trace amounts of hydrogen sulfide and siloxanes. If the gas is not removed, the pressure may get so high that it works its way to the surface, causing damage to the landfill structure, unpleasant odor, vegetation die-off, and an <b>explosion</b> <b>hazard.</b> The gas can be vented to the atmosphere, flared or burned to produce electricity or heat. Biogas can also be produced by separating organic materials from waste that otherwise goes to landfills. This method is more efficient than just capturing the landfill gas it produces. Anaerobic lagoons produce biogas from manure, while biogas reactors can be used for manure or plant parts. Like landfill gas, biogas is mostly methane and carbon dioxide, with small amounts of nitrogen, oxygen and hydrogen. However, with the exception of pesticides, there are usually lower levels of contaminants.|$|E
500|$|There are {{no clear}} {{indications}} that europium is particularly toxic {{compared to other}} heavy metals. Europium chloride, nitrate and oxide have been tested for toxicity: europium chloride shows an acute intraperitoneal LD50 toxicity of 550mg/kg and the acute oral [...] LD50 toxicity is 5000mg/kg. Europium nitrate shows a slightly higher intraperitoneal LD50 toxicity of 320mg/kg, while the oral toxicity is above 5000mg/kg. The metal dust presents a fire and <b>explosion</b> <b>hazard.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Metal-based {{nanoparticles}} exhibit {{more severe}} explosions than do carbon nanomaterials, and their chemical reaction pathway is qualitatively different.

30|$|Explosion {{prevention}} {{is dependent on}} an ability to detect and identify potential threats. Only then {{is it possible to}} document, register, and evaluate the threats comprehensively. An effective preventive protocol involves making contingency plans for possible explosions. Each step of the above process requires consistent government spending and input, which may include policy incentives, financial support, and human resources. Governments may install fiscal incentive policies that promote work safety and explosion prevention. These policies might include tax cuts for technology firms that specialize in <b>explosion</b> <b>hazards</b> control. Governments need to increase fiscal spending on work safety and explosion prevention and put such spending into their budgets. Moreover, government entities at all levels should also manage work safety funds to raise their efficiency of use. It is necessary for governments not only to employ safety experts to provide training and consultation, but also to attract outstanding personnel to join the public administration sector. Governments can also set up special education programs to train personnel for industrial <b>explosion</b> <b>hazards</b> control.|$|R
40|$|Mist or aerosol explosions {{present a}} serious hazard to process industries. Heat {{transfer}} fluids {{are widely used}} in the chemical process industry, are flammable above their flash points, and can cause aerosol explosions. Though the possibility of aerosol explosions has been widely documented, knowledge about their explosive potential is limited. Studying the formation of such aerosols by emulating leaks in process equipment will help define a source term for aerosol dispersions and aid in characterizing their <b>explosion</b> <b>hazards.</b> Current research conducted at the Mary Kay O’Connor Process Safety Center involves the non-intrusive measurement of heat transfer fluid aerosol sprays using a Malvern Diffraction Particle Analyzer. A predictive correlation relating aerosol droplet diameters to bulk liquid pressures, temperatures, thermal and fluid properties, leak sizes, and ambient conditions is presented. This correlation {{can be used to}} predict the conditions under which leaks will result in the formation of aerosols and ultimately help in estimating the <b>explosion</b> <b>hazards</b> of heat transfer fluid aerosols.

2500|$|While {{becoming}} the medium-range workhorse of the Hump airlift, the C-46 throughout its service experienced frequent mechanical failures (in particular, {{a tendency to}} engine failure and fuel leaks that puddled at the wing root to become an <b>explosion</b> <b>hazard)</b> that led to such unflattering sobriquets Air Force-wide as [...] "Dumbo" [...] and [...] "Plumber's Nightmare", and among ATC crews as the [...] "flying coffin." [...] In its first five months of operations, 20% of the C-46s assigned to the airlift crashed. When it first arrived in theater, {{in addition to being}} accompanied by technical orders that required 50 field modifications before it could be flown operationally, the C-46 also required additional training for inexperienced crews, and a transition school was established that drained the airlift of ten aircraft and crews. Worse, spare parts were in such scarce supply until the fall of 1943 that 26 of the first 68 C-46s sent were out of commission.|$|E
