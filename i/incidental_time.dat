40|$|In recent <b>times</b> <b>incidental</b> {{teaching}} {{has become}} the preferred method for encouraging children's learning and language development within the early childhood setting. It is argued that this naturalistic, unstructured and predominantly child-led style of teaching {{is the best way}} of fostering children's language acquisition and generalisation across settings. Few studies however have compared this method with more traditional, structured, adult-led teaching strategies. The present experiment compared the effectiveness of child-led and adult-led teaching interactions in the acquisition, retention and generalisation of object names in seven, 4 -year old children. A comparison {{of the effects of the}} two teaching conditions revealed that children learned more object names during the adult-led interactions. However this difference did not prove to be significant. No difference was found between the two groups in either retention or generalisation. These findings have significant implications for the way in which young children should be taught and raises questions about one of the fundamental assumptions underlying developmentally appropriate practice...|$|R

40|$|Inducing {{depressed}} and anxious individuals {{to write about}} their personal goals decreases natural killer (NK) cell activity, revealing a psychobiological pathway whereby experiences of failure can influence health (Strauman et al., 1993). However, {{it is unclear whether}} similar effects also occur in non-distressed individuals. This study used the same writing task to examine the acute physiological effects of presenting idiographic success and failure feedback by priming self-congruencies or self-discrepancies on three occasions (including a control condition). Blood samples were collected after each writing session to determine NK activity, and the number and type of lymphocytes in circulation were enumerated to help explain the cytolytic changes. The two self-relevant priming conditions were associated with significant alterations in immunity, and the high self-discrepant participants were more responsive. Both self-congruent (success) and self-discrepant (failure) priming induced significant shifts in mood, which partially mediated immune alterations but did not account for them completely. If repeated and sustained over <b>time,</b> <b>incidental</b> activation of self-discrepancies and self-congruencies could account for individual variation in immune responses...|$|R
40|$|The {{abundance}} {{of the three}} species of endemic Black Sea marine mammals represented by Delphinus delphis ponticus (Barabasch-Nikiforov 1935), Tursiops truncatus ponticus (Barabasch-Nikiforov 1940) and Phocoena phocoena relicta (Abel 1905) has shown a dramatic decline due to direct killing practiced in earlier <b>times,</b> <b>incidental</b> catches in fishing gears, depletion of the fish populations entering the cetacean food web, and habitat degradation. These threats are more severe in the Black Sea owing to its semi-enclosed nature, high human density, and human activities being carried out especially in coastal zones. Each year, incidental cetacean catches are registered on the Romanian littoral and, consequently, mortalities occur among individuals which strand on the beaches. These mortalities affect in particular the species Phocoena phocoena, considered the most vulnerable one to gillnet fishing. The greatest hazard for Black Sea marine mammals is turbot gillnets, taking into account their number and distribution area. This paper presents data on {{the description of the}} current fishing system used in the commercial fisheries of the Romanian Black Sea area, the geographical distribution of the incidental catches, fishing effort, IUU fishing and ghost fishing, CPUE values of cetacean by-catches, indirect impacts of fisheries and recommendations...|$|R
40|$|When {{asked how}} much money is enough, a wealthy {{individual}} replied, “Just a little bit more. ” Most families find there is never enough money, so sooner or later they squabble about how to spend the limited dollars. Meshing different styles of handling money doesn’t just happen because people love each other. It takes effective communication, time, and effort. Couples often have a harder time resolving money issues than other conflicts. Money issues tend to be raised repeatedly {{and are more likely to}} be mishandled. If your money discussions escalate to shouting matches or tearful sessions, changes are needed. Realize each of you will have different attitudes and values. To one, money may represent power. To another, it may mean security or status. One may be a spender, the other a saver. The concern is not that you always agree about money, but how you disagree and that you come to a suitable compromise. What Is an Argument Worth? Save arguments for important issues and major expenditures. Decide amounts each person can spend without reporting to anyone. It might be $ 5, $ 20, $ 50, or whatever fits your budget. These regular allowances provide a sense of spending freedom and eliminate discussions over personal items and <b>incidentals.</b> A <b>Time</b> and a Place Talking about money “later ” or promising to discuss it “some other time ” may never happen. Schedule regular meetings to discuss financial matters. This keeps you and your co-spender informed and can prevent minor concerns from becoming major problems. The particular time you decide to meet will depend on family schedules. Try to avoid meeting between 5 : 00 p. m. and 7 : 00 p. m. when people are usually tired and hungry. Meeting just before pay day or when bills are due is often a good choice. For your meeting, choose a place with minimum distractions. Do not let the television, radio, and phone interfere with your communications. Include all family members when appropriate. Children can learn from this process.

40|$|Almost {{from the}} moment that the Supreme Court {{abandoned}} the religious exemption doctrine in Employment Division v. Smith, its defenders have worked to bring it back. More than a decade later, however, Smith remains well-entrenched; {{not only has the}} Court confirmed Smith 2 ̆ 7 s basic holding, but it also struck the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, Congress 2 ̆ 7 s first effort to restore the exemption doctrine, at least as it applied to the states. Proponents of religious exemptions cannot ignore the hard truth that they can no longer be defended. During the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, American society viewed the practice of religion-mostly Christian or 2 ̆ 2 Judeo-Christian 2 ̆ 2 religion-as an especially good activity entitled to special privileges and to be encouraged by government. This understanding of religious practices has been displaced by an understanding that has reduced religious practices to a personal preference that is to be neither encouraged nor discouraged by government. In terms of its social place and importance, contemporary belief enjoys no greater cultural status than a number of indisputably secular activities. In this cultural environment, it is difficult to justify giving religious practices special constitutional protection that is not afforded to morally serious and socially valuable secular activities. In light of the new and diminished place of religion, religious practice should receive only the constitutional protection afforded to expression and association under the Speech and Equal Protection Clauses. <b>Incidental</b> restriction, <b>time,</b> place, and manner regulation, and prior restraint of religious activity should be handled doctrinally {{in the same way that}} such restrictions, regulations, and restraints of expression are dealt with by the Speech Clause. Likewise, burdens imposed on religious practices by underinclusive but nonsuspect classifications should be handled doctrinally in the same way that such burdens on fundamental rights are dealt with under the Equal Protection Clause. These constitutional analogues suggest a plausible, defensible, and meaningful doctrine that takes account of the place of religion in contemporary society...|$|R
40|$|Depth and {{sea water}} {{temperature}} values recorded by a Minilog system during several bottom trawl surveys {{carried out in}} the Strait of Sicily (Central Mediterranean Sea) in spring (MEDITS) and late summer (GRUND), were analyzed by using an ad hoc developed software (MiSeAT). Depth and temperature profiles were analyzed for each haul. Three sea water temperature (t°C) values were considered: the upper and lower water layers temperature, and the difference between them. Mean values by depth stratum and the corresponding standard deviations were estimated for the three parameters, then compared between the two seasons. Haul parameters recorded during the more heterogeneous GRUND surveys (due to the vertical waters stratification occurring in summer), were fed to a GIS system in order to produce thematic spatial maps by survey and variable. Data recorded support an ongoing warming up of the water masses in the Strait of Sicily (13. 5 °C representing the asymptotic temperature between 200 and 800 m), and confirm the existence of the basic three layers structure (Atlantic, Levantine and Transitional waters) reported for the area by classic literature. In spite of the limitations related to the use of Minilog (i. e., short coverage in space and <b>time,</b> <b>incidental</b> loss of devices, lower precision and accuracy of data if compared to those recorded by other devices), present results strongly support the validity of the Minilog-system-obtained temperature values...|$|R
40|$|Apraxia {{caused by}} left hemispheric stroke {{typically}} impairs skilled sequential movements. After stroke, apraxic patients need to reacquire motor skills by motor learning. The current study assessed {{for the first}} <b>time</b> <b>incidental</b> motor sequence learning in apraxic patients. Forty-eight human subjects (henceforth called "patients") with left hemispheric stroke affecting the middle cerebral artery territory (18 with apraxia and 30 without apraxia) and 17 age-matched healthy controls were tested on a visuomanual serial reaction time task. Subjects performed four blocks consisting of repetitions of a complex six element sequence containing ambiguous pairwise transitions before a new and unfamiliar sequence was introduced in block 5. Reaction time (RT) disadvantages in this fifth block indicated incidental sequence-specific motor learning. The intentional retrieval of the learned motor knowledge was assessed subsequently with a free recall task. Voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping (VLSM) was performed to investigate {{for the first time}} the lesion correlates of deficits in learning and retrieving sequential motor knowledge. Despite generally prolonged RTs, apraxic patients showed sequence-specific motor learning as could be observed in nonapraxic patients and healthy controls. However, apraxic patients showed reduced intentional retrieval of the learned sequence. VLSM revealed that impaired intentional retrieval of motor sequence knowledge resulted from dorsal premotor cortex lesions. Apraxic patients showed a dissociation of preserved incidental motor (sequence) learning and deficient intentional retrieval of this incidentally learned motor knowledge. The data suggest that novel approaches for treating apraxia should focus on incidental motor learning, but that automatic rather than intentional retrieval strategies should be enforced...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} was qualitative with case study approach. The {{purposes of this}} study were to identify the strategies used by teachers, to describe how the teachers implement those strategies, and to describe problems faced by teachers in teaching English to visually-impaired students in SLB Prof. Dr. Sri Soedewi Mascjun Sofwan, SH., MH. The participants of this research were two English teachers. This research focused on the teachers who taught English for visually-impaired students. The data for this study were collected through demographic questionnaire, observation, and in-dept interview with English teachers. The demographic data and the data from the observation sheet were analyzed descriptively. The interview data were analyzed by using within case and cross case displays; and analysis within case is the way in analyzing individual data from the participants and cross case is the way in cross checking all of individual data from the participants to get the common things. Related to research questions, there were three major themes and fourteen sub themes: strategies in teaching English to visually-impaired students, the implementation of those strategies, and teachers’ problems in teaching English to visually-impaired students. The subthemes were vocabulary and language development, guided interaction, metacognition and authentic assessment, explicit instruction, meaning based context and universal themes and using media, dictation, drilling, class-discussion, and role-play, lack of the Braille text book, lack of teachers ability in understanding Braille symbols, lack of students ability in spelling and <b>incidental</b> reading, and <b>time</b> limitation.

40|$|Previous {{literature}} {{shows that}} both explicit and incidental exposure to novel words can boost vocabulary. By comparing stories and definitions as ways of presenting novel words to children, {{the present study}} was able to assess the effectiveness of context on word-learning. It was predicted that learning would be greater when words are presented explicitly (in a definition) than incidentally (in a story). A comparison was also drawn between vocal and ‘passive’ interactions during word-teaching, where it was predicted that vocalised taught words will be learnt significantly better than words which are not vocalised by participants. Twenty preschool children were presented with 4 novel words, which were counterbalanced across 4 teaching conditions: words were presented explicitly through definitions or incidentally through stories, and were either vocalised or not vocalised by participants in each context. Each condition was a different combination of context-type and vocalisation-type (Definition Vocal/Non-vocal, Story Vocal/Non-vocal). The children then played 5 games, 3 of which tested word comprehension and 2 tested word production abilities. These were again played one week later to track learning over time. Using a repeated measures design, no significant difference was found between explicit teaching and <b>incidental</b> learning at <b>Time</b> 1 or Time 2. However, a significant difference between vocalisation and ‘passive’ learning was found at both Time 1 and Time 2. There was no effect of time on learning, but {{there was a significant difference}} between conditions at both times of testing, where the Story Vocal condition was significantly better than other teaching conditions. This suggests that stories are important tools for word-learning, but only when target words are vocalised during teaching. These findings have major implications on teaching methods, which may be applied to a more naturalistic setting...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{investigates the}} {{phenomena}} of edges as a differentiation that both divides and conjoins space and process. Edge conditions {{as a species}} of edges {{are responsible for the}} founding and development of our cities and they continue to influence the metropolis through a membranous separation - communication.. These edge conditions in process and spatial things can be explained through the analogy of a step. Step covers both meanings, the action of taking a step and the interval which is a step, consequently it describes the process and the spatiality or the time and space of step as an edge condition. A step links ‘instants’ of process and spatiality. A step is both end and bridge as an edge is both an end and an intersection. Its perhaps not <b>incidental</b> that mechanical <b>time</b> relies on serial steps {{in the form of a}} set of interlinked rotating cogs operating step by step to generate motion. This clockwork action becomes increasingly complex three dimensionally using the edges of serial cams and the stepping action of ‘cam followers’ between cams to develop complex programmed motion. This programmed motion through a series of edges and steps was used to create breathtaking imitations of nature such as ‘The Writer’ by Pierre Jaquet Droz and ‘The Swan’ by John Joseph Merlin. Today’s cities can be conceived of emerging as a reflective pattern of the programmatic activities and expectancies of their milieus where edge conditions form the basis of this reflective control. The edge is where happenings intensify it’s the meeting of phenomena and consequently both barrier and bridge to other spaces containing the ‘novel’ as in Simmel’s strangers. “All human action takes and makes place. The past is the set of places made by human action. History is a map of these places”. (Ethington, P. J: 2007) Ethington P.

40|$|Thesis (M. Ed.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, 2007. The study {{aimed at}} {{exploring}} curriculum responses to community-based air pollution. This was done through {{an analysis of}} educator and learner perceptions of community-based air pollution and an examination of how the curriculum (teaching and learning content) responds to local air pollution. The key forms of the study - (what are the perceptions of educators and learners to community-based air pollution and how do educators and learners respond to community-based air pollution within the formal curriculum). Ethnography as a qualitative methodology was adopted in the study. This methodological tool created spaces to understand curriculum responsiveness {{in the context of}} wider social and political power relations in the South Durban Basin. Ethnography suited the study since it was a unique example of educators and learners in real situations and lived experiences, and enabled a clearer understanding of the theory and praxis of curriculum. The primary research methodology used in order to gather data to answer the research questions was observation, participant observation and interviewing of educators and learners. This study was conducted with educators and learners in the Further Education and Training phase (Grade 10), within the Human and Social Sciences in the year 2006. Curriculum responses to community-based air pollution in Geography and Life Orientation were investigated. Learners were traced from previous primary schools in the area and who were in Grade 10. It was found that all participants in the study were knowledgeable and well informed about air pollution through consistent exposure to local air pollution. Collectively, they presented a sense of enduring struggle against community-based air pollution. They {{have been part of the}} struggle for clean air for many years and reside in the South Durban Basin. Participants display perspicuity in respect of how air pollution infects and affects them. Attempts at including community-based air pollution into the curriculum have been sporadic and at <b>times</b> <b>incidental</b> from learners' point of view. On the other hand, educators' responses were very constructive and established. Furthermore with reference to curriculum response to the subjects Geography and Life Orientation, both educators and learners responses were similar in that they displayed sophisticated accounts of knowledge of community-based air pollution. There was a deep sense of understanding of content and related to lived experiences. It was also found that educators and learners choose to live optimistically amidst the air pollution at Valley Secondary. Issues of class, poverty and powerlessness emerge from the data - these govern the lives of educators and learners. Participants in the study provided several motivations for Environmental Education to be included as a separate subject for future curriculum initiatives by the Department of Education. The recommendations included a strong need for responsive teaching to community-based air pollution. Learners should also be guided on how they should handle air pollution incidents. Recommendations in respect of re-organising the existent Environmental Club at Valley Secondary School also emerged. There is a clear sense that schools in the area should mobilise against the cooperate giants. Recommendations were provided for Curriculum Planners, Policy, and Policy Makers at the level of the Department of Education for the inclusion of Environmental Education as a separate subject rather than a devolved input...|$|R
