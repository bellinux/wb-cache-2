40|$|A self-healing, {{self-organizing}} {{evolvable hardware}} system is developed using SRAM-based reconfigurable Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) and group testing principles. It employs adaptive group testing techniques to autonomously maintain resource viability information as an organic means of transient and permanent fault resolution. Reconfigurability of the SRAM-based FPGA is leveraged to identify logic resource faults which are successively excluded by group testing using alternate device configurations. This simplifies the system architect’s role to <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> <b>functionality</b> using a high-level Hardware Description Language (HDL) and system-level performance versus availability operating point.

40|$|This case {{presents}} {{two issues}} that justify this Court’s review. First, the Federal Circuit upheld {{a finding of}} design patent infringement based on the very same Apple designs that it found functional under trade dress law. Such a counterintuitive outcome is possible because the Federal Circuit has constructed a highly constrained <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> <b>functionality</b> in design patent law, which {{is at odds with}} this Court’s precedent in both utility patent and trade dress cases. Coupled with its recent re-interpretation of the design patent infringement standard, the Federal Circuit’s approach to functionality makes it quite likely that defendants will be held liable for doing nothing more than implementing functional features that could not be protected with utility patents. This Court should grant review to address the relationship <b>of</b> <b>functionality</b> to design patent infringement. Second, despite Samsung’s own patents, its engineering and design work, and the fact that technologies developed by Google and countless other inventors are incorporated in Samsung’s phones, the Federal Circuit affirmed the jury’s damages award of Samsung’s entire profit from phones that were held to infringe Apple’s design patents. Under the Federal Circuit’s reading of 35 U. S.

In [14], the authors {{address the problem of}} evaluating the reliability of WSNs designed for industrial inventory management. They assume that {{for the purposes of this}} specific application, the data collected by each SN are stored redundantly on several other SNs to account for random SN failures. Accordingly, the WSN is deemed functional as long as there is a sufficient number of functional SNs that are both connected to each other and to the sink node. Based on this <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> network <b>functionality</b> and the assumption that the WSN deployment is homogeneous, the reliability evaluation problem is reduced to the famous K-out-of-N reliability problem ([URL] The authors also present a Monte Carlo (MC) simulation approach similar to that proposed in [10] to estimate the reliability of the WSN at hand.

40|$|For much of American history, {{in order}} to promote {{competition}} among the producers of useful products, the law did not grant protection to the design of such products unless the design met the demanding requirements for patent or copyright protection. In the 1980 s, an expansion of trade dress law resulted in protection of product designs, with the courts relying primarily on the functionality doctrine to preserve the interest in competition. The functionality doctrine, however, riddled by ambiguity and conflicting interpretations, was not effective in preventing overly broad protection of the designs of useful products. As a result, more and more designs of useful products were insulated from com-petition through trade dress law protection, and society’s interest in obtaining the best goods at the lowest cost was hampered. In the last ten years, the Supreme Court has indicated its distrust of this expansion of trade dress law. In particular, in TrafFix Devices v.

The <b>functionality</b> <b>of</b> a WSN {{can be divided into}} two major elements. The first element is the sensing functionality, which is the ability of a WSN to detect all the targets or phenomena that occur inside the boundaries of the RoI during its mission time. Hence, for a WSN to be functional in terms of sensing, it must provide full coverage for the RoI area (in case of area coverage) or all the targeted locations in the RoI (in case of point coverage) during its mission time. The second element <b>of</b> the WSN <b>functionality</b> is the connectivity functionality, which is the ability of the WSN to deliver sensed data from its sources (i.e., SNs) to the designated destination (i.e., sink node(s)) during its mission time. Hence, for a WSN to be functional in terms of connectivity, any target or a phenomenon detected by one or more SNs has to be recognized at the sink node(s) through multi-hop wireless communication throughout the WSN mission time. Based on this <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> WSN <b>functionality,</b> a WSN is said to have failed if either of its sensing or connectivity functionality elements fail [4].|$|R
