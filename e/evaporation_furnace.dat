40|$|Exposure to {{nano-sized}} and nanostructured {{aerosol particles}} with tailored properties {{are likely to}} increase in society. Occupational exposure to various kinds of nanostructured aerosol particles such as soot and metal aggregates already exists. To understand the adverse human health effects of these particles, {{there is a need}} for systems that can Generate a stable output of aerosol particles, Characterize their exposure and dose, and determine their toxicological and biological effects in an Air-liquid interface setting (GCA). The research presented in this thesis developed and validated a GCA that combines a high output of aerosol particles, online characterization, collection capabilities for a scanning electron microscope (SEM) and transmisson electron microscopy (TEM), as well as wet samples for protein interaction studies and particle toxicological effects. The GCA is composed of an air-liquid interface cellular exposure chamber – the Nano Aerosol Chamber for In Vitro Toxicity (NACIVT) – and an electrostatic precipitator. It also includes a high output aerosol particle generator with built-in capabilities for sintering and online mass mobility characterization, a scanning mobility particle sizer, and a tapered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM) for continuous characteristics and exposure measurements. The output characteristics of two spark discharge generators and a high temperature <b>evaporation</b> <b>furnace</b> were determined, including mass mobility relation. The results show that all three of these generators produced a stable output of nanostructured metal aerosol particles in the 30 - 300 nm size range; when sintered, these were near spherical in shape. In terms of dose, number, mass and surface area, the output was comparable to that of previous studies for all generators. The GCA with respect to toxicological studies was validated using primary human small airway epithelial cells (SAEC) and carcinoma cell line (A 549). Aerosol particles of copper (Cu), palladium (Pd) and silver (Ag) were generated and administerd in the NACIVT during 1 hour exposures. For SAEC exposed to Cu, Pd or Ag, a significant (p< 0. 05) effect on both viability and cytokine expression was oberserved. Also a significant (p< 0. 05) dose response for SAEC exposed to Cu, Pd and Ag could be determined. For the A 549, Cu and Pd exposure induced a significant reduction in cellular viability. The protein interactions of the near-spherical sintered and aggregted Au nanoparticles, that were generated using high temperature <b>evaporation</b> <b>furnace,</b> were investigated in serum and human lung fluid solutions. When administered to the air-liquid interface, the spherical Au particles formed a stable film with a pinkish hue; when agitated, < 100 nm aggregates of particles and proteins were formed. This film formation is suggested as a protective property of the air-liquid interface itself...|$|E
40|$|We report {{growth of}} large single {{crystals}} of the triangular-lattice antiferromagnetic compound Ba 3 CoSb 2 O 9 by the floating-zone technique in an image <b>furnace.</b> <b>Evaporation</b> of Sb {{due to its}} high volatility was controlled by high pressure and addition of excess Sb in the starting materials {{to compensate for the}} losses. The crystal quality was analysed using different X-ray techniques, and the magnetic transition temperature was confirmed by magnetization and heat capacity measurements...|$|R
30|$|For a {{comparative}} study, we chose a 40 -layered Si/SiO sample with thicknesses of SiO and Si layers being 3.75 and 1.00 nm, respectively, and a single-layered sample prepared by co-evaporating Si and SiO {{with the same}} ratio of Si to O and the same contents of Si and O {{as those of the}} multilayered sample. For further EL identification, a pure SiO 2 sample with a thickness of 150 nm was prepared by electron beam <b>evaporation,</b> followed by <b>furnace</b> annealing at 1, 100 °C in nitrogen for 1 h.|$|R
40|$|A totally dried three-layer resist process using {{evaporated}} {{fatty acid}} was proposed for fine pattern fabrication. Oriented thin film of stearic acid or ~-tricosenoic acid was formed on an aluminum-evaporated substrate by <b>evaporation</b> using a <b>furnace</b> with an orifice {{of a few}} millimeters in diameter. Electron-beam delineation {{was performed on the}} film and a 2 -~m line and space negative pattern was developed successfully by heating the substrate and transferring it to aluminum by chlorine gas-etching through theresist window. The pattern on aluminum was transferred successfully tothe third layer of polymer by oxygen plasma-etching. The advance of VLSI has caused interest in nanometer microlithographic technologies. In resist technology, crys-talline fatty acid resists should have higher resolutions compared to amorphous polymeric resists. Actually ~ Bar-raud et al. obtained pattern resolution of 60 nm for the films of 15 monomolecular layer (thickness of 45 nm) of r acid formed by Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) technique. 1 However LB resists have several disadvantage...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{research and}} design of fluidized bed steam boiler natural circulation circuit. The capacity of the drum boiler is 85 MW, superheated steam pressure is 98 bar. There are two variants research results of the designed circulation circuit. The first circulation circuit variant {{was designed as a}} complex circuit with a common downcomers and risers for the boiler evaporating screen. In the second variant the flow is separately supplied to and discharged from the evaporator that is divided into independent sections. We have researched and described the influence of heat absorption inequality on the <b>furnace</b> <b>evaporation</b> pads using the Boiler Designer software. We also have calculated main characteristics of the two-phase flow in the evaporation pads and evaluated reliability of the natural circulation. The circulation circuit is optimized from point of view of reliability and metal expenses. Results demonstrate that the specific quantity of metal of complex and simple circuit variants is approximately the same with equal reliability...|$|R
40|$|Process {{conditions}} in glass furnaces, especially the settings of the combustion system, determine {{the rate of}} the evaporation processes at the glass melt surface. Reduction of volatilization to lower dust and heavy metal emissions, to minimize the refractory attack by the aggressive volatile components, and to limit depletion of volatile glass components at the glass melt surface is of great technological importance. This can be achieved by changes in burner design and burner positioning, optimizing combustion control and avoiding extreme glass surface temperatures. Such high local temperatures at the glass surface may lead to very high concentrations of PbO, NaOH or KOH vapors attacking the crown materials of the <b>furnace.</b> <b>Evaporation</b> model studies show the potential of process measures for the reduction of evaporation and minimizing depletion of alkali, lead or boron compounds at the glass melt surface. Sodium depletion down to 80 % of the original content can take place at the glass melt surface, in lead silicate melting processes depletion may reduce the lead concentrations by more than 50 %. Industrial tests support the results of modeling studies and show the effects of the settings of the combustion processes on glass-melt evaporation kinetics...|$|R
