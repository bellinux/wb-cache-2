40|$|Splined Mandrel Flow Forming (SMFF) is an {{effective}} method for fabricating a variety of internally-ribbed cylindrical parts. The process is, however, prone to premature failure of the splined mandrels and this {{is thought to be}} related to the magnitude of the forming forces exerted by the forming rollers on the mandrel splines. In this thesis an experimentation-based approach is used to investigate the effects of critical process parameters; namely, Inter-roller offset of the X 1 -X 2 forming rollers, Oa, roller inclination angle, roller nose radius, r 0, <b>forming</b> <b>roller</b> feed rate and mandrel rotational speed, on forming forces exerted on an AISI 1020 steel work piece as it is flow formed over a splined mandrel. The combined effect of these parameters on the maximum forming forces, Fmax, the roller forceoscillation amplitude, ΔF, and the roller/ work piece contact area are examined for an X 1 <b>forming</b> <b>roller</b> during the third pass for SMFF tests performed under various process conditions...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In this paper, {{by using}} a {{practical}} 3 D FE model, one power spinning process of parts with transverse inner rib has been simulated. The stress and strain fields have been obtained and the features of metal flow in plastic deformation zone have been discussed thoroughly. Then, the main forming defects and their origins have been explored based {{on the study of}} the metal flow, shown as follows; (1) during the non-rib process, the main forming defect is the wall fracture in finished deformation zone. The origin of this forming defect is the excessive metal flow in thickness direction ahead of the <b>forming</b> <b>roller.</b> (2) in the rib-forming process, the main forming defect is the undesired inner rib. The origin of this forming defect is the excessive metal flow in hoop direction during the former non-rib process. (3) the features of the metal flow during flange part process are almost the same as those in the non-rib process. The achievements of this study can thoroughly reveal the deformation mechanism and provide an important basis for the optimization of the process parameters and the precise control of the power spinning process of parts with transverse inner rib...|$|E
50|$|A simple {{indication}} {{of the quality of}} a printing press is the number of distribution and <b>form</b> <b>rollers.</b> The greater the number of distribution rollers, the more accurate the control of ink uniformity. It is difficult to ink large solid areas on a plate with only one ink <b>form</b> <b>roller.</b> With three (generally the maximum), it is relatively easy to maintain consistent ink coverage of almost any image area on the plate. Business forms presses, which print very little coverage, usually only have one or two ink <b>form</b> <b>rollers.</b> Because of this, they cannot print large solid or screen images. Smaller, less sophisticated presses also have the same problem, however, many of the newer presses today are being equipped with larger, better inking systems to meet the growing print demands of the consumer.|$|R

5000|$|Indirect {{dampening}} systems (or integrated dampening systems) {{feed the}} water directly {{into one of}} the ink <b>form</b> <b>rollers</b> (ink rollers that touch the offset plate) via a water <b>form</b> <b>roller</b> in contact with it. These systems are known as [...] "indirect" [...] since the water travels to the offset plate passing through the inking system and not directly to the offset plate as direct systems do. Some indirect systems will have the ability to feed the water into the inking system {{as well as to the}} offset plate. A fine emulsion of ink and water is then developed on the ink <b>form</b> <b>roller.</b> This is one reason printers need to know about [...] "water pickup" [...] or what percentage of water can be taken up by the ink. These systems are also known as [...] "integrated" [...] dampening systems as they are integrated into the inking system. One of the benefits of these systems, is that they do not use covers thus they react more quickly when dampening changes are made. One generally finds this type of dampening systems on newer and faster press equipment today.|$|R
40|$|Flow forming is an {{advanced}} version of metal spinning process {{which is used}} to manufacture sheet metal products having symmetrically axial geometry and also to produce long thin-wall tubes with precision dimensions and desired mechanical property. In flow forming of tubes, the workpiece is held onto the mandrel as the <b>forming</b> <b>roller</b> moves along the workpiece axially to reduce the diameter. Author has developed a few concepts of flow forming tool that built to accommodate the lathe tool post. One of the concept consists of two rollers set has been fabricated. This tool is rigid enough to perform flow forming at lathe machine and can flow-form tubes with a diameter up to 100 mm. This tooling assembly is attached at Pinacho SP/ 165 conventional lathe machine to perform flow forming process. The selected work material is aluminium alloy 6061 that widely applied at light-weighted industries. The main objectives of this research is to analyse the influences of major process parameters such as feed rate, spindle speed and depth of cut on wall thickness changes, internal diameter growth and roundness of the finished products. The dimensions of the finish products are measured using Carl Zeiss Coordinate Measuring Machine. It is found that wall thickness changes decreases and external diameter increases as the roller travels along the tube. It is also found that higher feed rate of rollers and lower thickness reductions have advantages for obtaining smaller internal diameter growth. The tube with good roundness also can be obtained by flow-form the tube using lower thickness reductions. Material structure test also has been conducted to confirm the direction of the flow of material during the process...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} use CBN {{grinding}} wheels technologically and economically successful, their correct use preparation is of decisive importance. Systematic investigations when truing ceramic bonded CBN grinding wheels with a diamond <b>form</b> <b>roller</b> should show {{the influence of}} the process setting parameters and the contour inclination of the abrasive coating on the grinding result. Analogous considerations made it possible to carry out the tests using a single grinding wheel with a straight profile. In doing so, a loading of the abrasive coating was produced in axial direction by special grinding kinematics. The influence of the inclination angle on the coherence of the abrasive coating becomes clear particulary for the wear behaviour. A reason for this is the loading of the abrasive coating by an axial force component. What is more, {{the influence of the}} speed ratio on the performance of CBN grinding wheels was examined with a high-speed device for diamond <b>form</b> <b>rollers...</b>|$|R
50|$|The ink {{fountain}} stores {{a quantity of}} ink in a reservoir and feeds small quantities of ink to the distribution rollers from the {{ink fountain}} roller and the ink ductor roller. The ink ductor roller is a movable roller that moves {{back and forth between}} the ink fountain roller and an ink distribution roller. As the ductor contacts the ink fountain roller, both turn and the ductor is inked. The ductor then swings forward to contact an ink distribution roller and transfers ink to it. There are generally two types of ink distribution rollers: the ink rotating rollers (or ink transfer rollers), which rotate in one direction, and the ink oscillating rollers (or ink vibrating rollers), which rotate and move from side to side. The ink distribution rollers receive ink and work it into a semiliquid state that is uniformly delivered to the ink <b>form</b> <b>rollers.</b> A thin layer of ink is then transferred to the image portions of the lithographic plate by the ink <b>form</b> <b>rollers.</b>|$|R

In the present paper, the characteristic of corner cracks in the mandrel teeth (made of S 7 tool steel) of a spinning process has been investigated. The rotational speed of the mandrel is about 300 rpm during spinning process and the sheet metal (i. e. AISI 1020) is in contact with mandrel teeth to get the mandrel shape at the end of process. During this process, the mandrel teeth eventually break away. Fractography analyses using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) clearly confirm “fatigue” as being the main reason for the failure...|$|R

40|$|AbstractPerformance of {{grinding}} operation {{is influenced by}} a variety of factors amongst which dressing process is the most important. Through the dressing process, the grinding wheel topography is produced. This affects, in turn, directly the grinding forces, workpiece surface quality and grinding wheel wear. This research aims to develop appropriate dressing strategies for small abrasive wheels in internal cylindrical grinding. For this purpose, three different dressing rollers, including an electroplated, a vitrified bond <b>form</b> <b>roller</b> and a cup-dresser, with four different grinding wheels, two CBN and two corundum wheels, were experimented. The studies on the ground surface roughness values and grinding forces prove the validity of the Schmitt-diagram in internal cylindrical {{grinding operation}}s. When up-dressing, a finer workpiece surface was achieved as compared to the case of down-dressing. This is associated with higher grinding forces which are caused by the finer grinding wheel surface. Further investigation was carried out on the wear rate of CBN grinding wheels. However, no measurable wear was seen up to a specific material removal volume of 9700 mm 3 /mm...|$|R
