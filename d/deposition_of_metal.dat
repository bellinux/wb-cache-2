5|$|Merrifield opens The Archaeology of Ritual and Magic by {{discussing}} how archaeologists have understood magic and ritual practices in past societies, opining {{that on the}} whole {{it had been a}} neglected area of study. Looking at the archaeological evidence for ritual activity in the pre-Roman Iron Age and the Roman Iron Age of Britain, he discusses animal and human sacrifice, as well as the offering of votive deposits in rivers and other bodies of water. He moves on to explore the rituals surrounding death and burial, suggesting areas where this ritual activity is visible in the burial record of multiple societies. Merrifield goes on to discuss the archaeological evidence for ritual practices in Christian Europe, highlighting areas of ritual continuance from earlier pagan periods, in particular the <b>deposition</b> <b>of</b> <b>metal</b> goods in water. Looking at the evidence for foundation deposits in European buildings that likely had magico-religious purposes, he then looks at several examples of written charms and spells which have survived in the archaeological record.|$|E

50|$|Metal marks {{are dark}} lines, often {{accompanied}} by damage in the glaze, caused by the <b>deposition</b> <b>of</b> <b>metal</b> during the use of metal utensils. The cutlery, or other relatively soft metal, will leave a very thin smear of metal on pottery ware if the glaze is minutely pitted.

The fault is also known as cutlery marking.|$|E
50|$|Formation of {{contacts}} to compound semiconductors is considerably {{more difficult than}} with silicon. For example, GaAs surfaces tend to lose arsenic and the trend towards As loss can be considerably exacerbated by the <b>deposition</b> <b>of</b> <b>metal.</b> In addition, the volatility of As limits the amount of post-deposition annealing that GaAs devices will tolerate. One solution for GaAs and other compound semiconductors is to deposit a low-bandgap alloy contact layer {{as opposed to a}} heavily doped layer. For example, GaAs itself has a smaller bandgap than AlGaAs and so a layer of GaAs near its surface can promote ohmic behavior. In general the technology of ohmic contacts for III-V and II-VI semiconductors is much less developed than for Si.|$|E
30|$|Galvanic {{displacement}} {{has been}} widely extended to the fabrication of various Si nanostructures (Peng et al. 2006; Nakamura et al. 2010; Nakamura et al. 2011), such as highly oriented Si nanowires by metal-assisted chemical etching (Huang et al. 2011). Oskam reviewed the electrochemical <b>deposition</b> <b>of</b> <b>metals</b> on Si substrates and demonstrated that the thermodynamics and kinetics <b>of</b> <b>metal</b> <b>deposition</b> on Si surfaces are dependent on several complex factors, such as the doping type of Si, concentration of HF solution, and dropping rate (Oskam et al. 1927). So far, the main research on metal–Si contacts focus on metals as contamination at the Si substrate surface during the ULSI process (Gorostiza et al. 1997). Reports on the electrochemical <b>deposition</b> <b>of</b> <b>metals</b> on semiconductor powder, particularly ultrafine Si powder, are scant. One promising application of Si powder in lithium ion batteries has stimulated research on the low-cost and large-scale fabrication of Si porous structures (Ge et al. 2014). In this application, the etching mechanisms {{are the same as}} etching bulk Si, but with different compositions <b>of</b> etchants.

Later in the period, cremation was adopted as a burial practice with cemeteries of urns containing cremated individuals appearing in the archaeological record, with <b>deposition</b> <b>of</b> <b>metal</b> objects such as daggers. People of this period were also largely responsible for building many famous prehistoric sites such as the later phases of Stonehenge along with Seahenge. The Bronze Age people lived in round houses and divided up the landscape. Stone rows are to be seen on, for example, Dartmoor. They ate cattle, sheep, pigs and deer as well as shellfish and birds. They carried out salt manufacture. The wetlands were a source of wildfowl and reeds. There was ritual deposition of offerings in the wetlands and in holes in the ground.|$|E

The equations that govern the scattering and absorption of light can be shown as:This shows the scattering of light for particles which have diameters below the wavelength of light.This shows the absorption for a point dipole model.This is the polarizability of the particle. V is the particle volume. [...] is the dielectric function of the particle. [...] is the dielectric function of the embedding medium. When [...] the polarizability of the particle becomes large. This polarizability value is known as the surface plasmon resonance. The dielectric function for metals with low absorption can be defined as:In the previous equation, [...] is the bulk plasma frequency. This is defined as:N is the density of free electrons, e is the electronic charge and m is the effective mass of an electron. [...] is the dielectric constant of free space. The equation for the surface plasmon resonance in free space can therefore be represented by:Many of the plasmonic solar cells use nano-particles to enhance the scattering of light. These nano-particles take the shape of spheres, and therefore the surface plasmon resonance frequency for spheres is desirable. By solving the previous equations, the surface plasmon resonance frequency for a sphere in free space can be shown as: ...|$|E
5000|$|Impression-die forging is {{also called}} [...] "closed-die forging". In impression-die forging, the metal {{is placed in}} a die {{resembling}} a mold, which is attached to an anvil. Usually, the hammer die is shaped as well. The hammer is then dropped on the workpiece, causing the metal to flow and fill the die cavities. The hammer is generally {{in contact with the}} workpiece on the scale of milliseconds. Depending on the size and complexity of the part, the hammer may be dropped multiple times in quick succession. Excess metal is squeezed out of the die cavities, forming what is referred to as [...] "flash". The flash cools more rapidly {{than the rest of the}} material; this cool metal is stronger than the metal in the die, so it helps prevent more flash from forming. This also forces the metal to completely fill the die cavity. After forging, the flash is removed.In commercial impression-die forging, the workpiece is usually moved through a series of cavities in a die to get from an ingot to the final form. The first impression is used to distribute the metal into the rough shape in accordance to the needs of later cavities; this impression is called an [...] "edging", [...] "fullering", or [...] "bending" [...] impression. The following cavities are called [...] "blocking" [...] cavities, in which the piece is working into a shape that more closely resembles the final product. These stages usually impart the workpiece with generous bends and large fillets. The final shape is forged in a [...] "final" [...] or [...] "finisher" [...] impression cavity. If there is only a short run of parts to be done, then it may be more economical for the die to lack a final impression cavity and instead machine the final features.Impression-die forging has been improved in recent years through increased automation which includes induction heating, mechanical feeding, positioning and manipulation, and the direct heat treatment of parts after forging.One variation of impression-die forging is called [...] "flashless forging", or [...] "true closed-die forging". In this type of forging, the die cavities are completely closed, which keeps the workpiece from forming flash. The major advantage to this process is that less metal is lost to flash. Flash can account for 20 to 45% of the starting material. The disadvantages of this process include additional cost due to a more complex die design and the need for better lubrication and workpiece placement.There are other variations of part formation that integrate impression-die forging. One method incorporates casting a forging preform from liquid metal. The casting is removed after it has solidified, but while still hot. It is then finished in a single cavity die. The flash is trimmed, then the part is quench hardened. Another variation follows the same process as outlined above, except the preform is produced by the spraying <b>deposition</b> <b>of</b> <b>metal</b> droplets into shaped collectors (similar to the Osprey process).Closed-die forging has a high initial cost due to the creation of dies and required design work to make working die cavities. However, it has low recurring costs for each part, thus forgings become more economical with more volume. This is one of the major reasons closed-die forgings are often used in the automotive and tool industries. Another reason forgings are common in these industrial sectors is that forgings generally have about a 20 percent higher strength-to-weight ratio compared to cast or machined parts of the same material.|$|E

30|$|Recently, it {{has been}} found that tensile {{strength}} of NCs formed by short copper (Cu) immersion deposition in PS is controlled by the variation of PS porosity [11].

The presence of Cu NPs on the pore walls of PS promotes electrochemical <b>deposition</b> <b>of</b> thick <b>metal</b> films (the maximum thickness <b>of</b> <b>metal</b> film without the interlayer of Cu/PS NC is less than 2 μm).
