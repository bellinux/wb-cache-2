The following deep-sea sharks were investigated from 2009 to 2015 : Centrophorus granulosus (27 specimens); Centrophorus uyato (39); Etmopterus spinax (67); Somniosus rostratus (19); Galeus melanostomus (189); Scyliorhinus canicula (261), Hexanchus griseus 3), and <b>Dalatias</b> <b>licha</b> (100). In addition, two pelagic shark species were examined: Alopias vulpinus (7), and Prionace glauca (53). Only two species of gill monogeneans were found. Protocotyle grisea (Cerfontaine, 1899) Euzet et Maillard, 1974 was found on its type-host Hexanchus griseus; comparative measurements are provided, and Algeria is a new geographic record.

[...] 1 pageKnowing {{the feeding}} habits of marine predators is {{essential}} to understanding their ecological role in the ecosystem. Such knowledge can also inform conservation strategies for threatened species. Research conducted on shark species inhabiting the deep sea is very scarce although these species may play a relevant role in {{the dynamics of the}} ecosystem. In the present study, we aimed to examine the feeding ecology (dietary composition and trophic level) of the kitefin shark (<b>Dalatias</b> <b>licha),</b> a deep-sea shark globally considered as Near Threatened and as Data Deficient in the Mediterranean Sea. In particular, by combining the use of stomach content and stable isotopic approaches, we aimed to examine the main feeding strategies of this marine predator at different temporal scales in the western Mediterranean Sea. The results revealed the clear importance of small sharks in the diet of the kitefin shark at different temporal scales, although fin-fish, crustaceans and cephalopods were also found to make up part of its diet.

40|$|Concentrations of {{polychlorinated biphenyls}} (PCBs) and {{organochlorine}} pesticides (DDTs), were determined {{in the liver}} of two different shark species Prionace glauca (blue shark) and <b>Dalatias</b> <b>licha</b> (kitefin shark) from the Mediterranean Sea. In blue shark liver, the concentrations of PCBs (2482 ng g(- 1)) and DDTs (2392 ng g(- 1)) were comparable, while in kitefin shark the hepatic concentrations of DDTs (4554 ng g(- 1)) {{were significantly higher than}} those of PCBs (1827 ng g(- 1)). Contamination levels differed between species, with kitefin shark showing consistently higher concentrations of DDTs, and blue shark higher levels of PCBs. Congener-specific PCB profiles, similar between the two species were dominated by the higher chlorinated congeners (hexachlorobiphenyls: 62. 8 - 63. 9 %, penta-: 15. 2 - 21. 3 %, hepta-: 13. 4 - 14. 5) with most of the lower chlorinated congeners being absent or present at very low levels. In both species, the total 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenz-p-dioxin toxic equivalent (TEQs) concentrations (blue shark: 2. 51 pg/g; kitefin shark: 1. 46 pg/g) seem to be relatively modest. Regards to DDT component pattern, p,p'-DDE was dominant in the liver of both species (blue shark: 81. 5 %; kitefin shark: 38. 0 %), while the percentage composition of the other metabolites was differently characterized. The composition pattern of DDTs and the low value of p,p'-DDE/DDTs ratio in the specimens from Ionian Sea suggest that organochlorine pesticide contamination is still continuing in this marine environment.

40|$|Elasmobranchs are an {{important}} by-catch of commercial fisheries targeting bony fishes. Fisheries targeting sharks are rare, but usually almost all specimen bycatched are marketed. They risk extinction if current fishing pressure continues (Ferretti et al., 2008). Accurate species identification is critical {{for the design of}} sustainable fisheries and appropriate management plans, especially since not all species are equally sensitive to fishing pressure (Walker & Hislop 1998). The identification of species constitutes the first basic step for biodiversity monitoring and conservation (Dayrat B et al., 2005). More recently, mtDNA sequencing has also been used for species identification and its use has become widespread under the DNA Barcode initiative (e. g. Hebert et al. 2003 a, 2003 b; Ward et al. 2005, 2008 a; Moura et al 2008; Steinke et al. 2009).

40|$|Squaliforme {{sharks are}} a common but {{relatively}} vulnerable bycatch in many deep water fisheries. Eleven species of squaliforme shark are commonly caught at depths of 200 – 1200 m on Chatham Rise, New Zealand, and their diversity suggests they might occupy different niches. The diets of 133 Deania calcea and 295 Squalus acanthias were determined from examination of stomach contents. The diet of D. calcea was characterised by mesopelagic fishes, and S. acanthias by benthic to pelagic fishes, but was more adaptive and included likely scavenging. Multivariate analyses found the most important predictors of diet variability in S. acanthias were year, bottom temperature, longitude, and fish weight. The diet of the nine other commonly caught squaliforme sharks was reviewed, and the spatial and depth distribution of all species on Chatham Rise described from research bottom trawl survey catches. The eleven species had {{a variety of different}} diets, and depth and location preferences, consistent with niche separation to reduce interspecific competition. Four trophic groups were identified, characterised by: mesopelagic fishes and invertebrates (Centroselachus crepidater, D. calcea, and Etmopterus lucifer); mesopelagic and benthopelagic fishes and invertebrates (Centroscymnus owstoni, Etmopterus baxteri); demersal and benthic fishes (Centrophorus squamosus, <b>Dalatias</b> <b>licha,</b> Proscymnodon plunketi); and a generalist diet of fishes and invertebrates (S. acanthias).

40|$|Shark fin, {{used as a}} food, is a {{rich source}} of glycosaminoglyans (GAGs), acidic polysaccharides having {{important}} biological activities, suggesting their nutraceutical and pharmaceutical application. A comprehensive survey of GAGs derived from the fin was performed on 11 elasmobranchs, including several deep sea sharks. Chondroitin sulfate (CS) and hyaluronic acid (HA) were found in Isurus oxyrinchus, Prionace glauca, Scyliorhinus torazame, Deania calcea, Chlamydoselachus anguineus, Mitsukurina owatoni, Mustelus griseus and Dasyatis akajei, respectively. CS was only found from Chimaera phantasma, <b>Dalatias</b> <b>licha,</b> and Odontaspis ferox, respectively. Characteristic disaccharide units of most of the CS were comprised of C- and D-type units. Interestingly, substantial amount of CS/dermatan sulfate (DS) was found in the dried fin (without skin and cartilage) of Isurus oxyrinchus and Prionace glauca. 1 H-NMR analysis showed that the composition of glucuronic acid (GlcA) and iduronic acid (IdoA) in shark CS/DS was 41. 2 % and 58. 8 % (Isurus oxyrinchus), 36. 1 % and 63. 9 % (Prionace glauca), respectively. Furthermore, a substantial proportion of this CS/DS consisted of E-, B- and D-type units. Shark CS/DS stimulated neurite outgrowth of hippocampal neurons at a similar level as DS derived from invertebrate species. Midkine and pleiotrophin interact strongly with CS/DS from Isurus oxyrinchus and Prionace glauca, affording Kd values of 1. 07 nM, 6. 25 nM and 1. 70 nM, 1. 88 nM, respectively. These results strongly suggest that the IdoA-rich domain of CS/DS is required for neurite outgrowth activity. A detailed examination of oligosaccharide residues, produced by chondroitinase ACII digestion, suggested that the IdoA and B-type units as well as A- and C-type units were found in clusters in shark CS/DS. In addition, it was discovered that the contents of B-type units in these IdoA-rich domain increased in a length dependent manner, while C- and D-type units were located particularly in the immediate vicinity of the IdoA-rich domain...|$|E
