5000|$|The main crops of {{the area}} are {{vegetables}} which reflect each wave of immigration into Canada, and have traditionally been grown by immigrants for ethnic markets in the Greater Toronto Area and for export. The agricultural plots were originally divided into 5 acre [...] "market garden" [...] family farms, and produce was taken to local markets. In the 1920s the main crops reflected eastern and western European tastes - yellow onions, potatoes, carrots, head lettuce, radish, etc. From the 1950s to the 1980s, Italian greens started to be grown, for example dandelion, <b>escarole,</b> and endive. Demand for Asian greens, such as bok choy, began in the 1990s. With the opening of Highway 400 in the 1950s, farmers quickly gained access to the Ontario Food Terminal in Toronto, vastly expanding their market. Yonge Street and the CN rail (Toronto - Barrie) are situated to the northeast. When the federal government relaxed food import rules in the 1990s and grocery stores consolidated to form large chains across Canada, small family farms growing diverse crops were, for the most part, no longer financially feasible, but a few small family farms still survive. Corporate farms that had bought land in the 1950s sold their plots and a few family farms consolidated, growing mostly onions and carrots for grocery stores, export and food processing companies. Recently the Greenbelt family farmers market introduced by the Ontario government has helped some small family farms.|$|E

40|$|Fluorescent {{emission}} kinetics {{of isolated}} spinach chloroplasts {{have been observed}} at room temperature with an instrument resolution time of 10 ps using a frequency doubled, mode-locked Nd:glass laser and an optical Kerr gate. At 685 nm two maxima are apparent in the time dependency of the fluorescence; the first occurs at 15 ps and the second at 90 ps after the flash. The intervening minimum occurs at about 50 ps. On the basis of theoretical models, lifetimes of the components associated with the two peaks and spectra (in <b>escarole</b> chloroplasts), the fluorescence associated with the first peak is interpreted as originating from Photosystem I (PSI) (risetime ≤ 10 ps, lifetime ≤ 10 ps) and the second peak from Photosystem II (PSII) (lifetime, 210 ps in spinach chloroplasts and 320 ps in <b>escarole</b> chloroplasts). The {{fact that there are}} two fluorescing components with a quantum yield ratio ≤ 0. 048 explains the previous discrepancy between the quantum yield of fluorescence measured in chloroplasts directly and that calculated from the lifetime of PSII. The 90 ps delay in the peak of PSII fluorescence is probably explained by energy transfer between accessory pigments such as carotenoids and Chl a. Energy spillover between PSI and PSII is not apparent during the time of observation. The results of this work support the view that the transfer of excitation energy to the trap complex in both photosystems occurs by means of a molecular excitation mechanism of intermediate coupling strength. Although triplet states are not of major importance in energy transfer to PSII traps, the possibility that they are involved in PSI photochemistry has not been eliminated...|$|E

40|$|Growth {{potential}} (delta) {{is defined}} as the difference between the population of a microorganism at the end of shelf-life of specific food and its initial population. The determination of 6 of Salmonella and Listeria monocytogenes in RTE vegetables can be very useful to determine likely threats to food safety. However, little is known on the behavior of these microorganisms in several RTE vegetables. Therefore, the aim {{of this study was to}} determine the delta of both pathogens in nine different types of RTE vegetables (<b>escarole,</b> collard green, spinach, watercress, arugula, grated carrot, green salad, and mix for yakisoba) stored at refrigeration (7 degrees C) and abuse temperature (15 degrees C). The population of aerobic microorganisms and lactic acid bacteria, including those showing antimicrobial activity has been also determined. Results indicated that L monocytogenes was able to grow (delta >= 0. 5 log(10)) in more storage conditions and vegetables than Salmonella. Both microorganisms were inhibited in carrots, although a more pronounced effect has been observed against L monocytogenes. The highest 5 values were obtained when the RTE vegetables were stored 15 degrees C/ 6 days in collard greens (delta= 3. 3) and arugula (delta= 3. 2) (L monocytogenes) and arugula (delta= 4. 1) and <b>escarole</b> (delta= 2. 8) (Salmonella). In most vegetables and storage conditions studied, the counts of total aerobic microorganisms raised significantly independent of the temperature of storage (p< 0. 05). Counts of lactic acid bacteria were higher in vegetables partially or fully stored at abuse temperature with recovery of isolates showing antimicrobial activity. In conclusion, the results of this study show that Salmonella and L monocytogenes may grow and reach high populations in RTE vegetables depending on storage conditions and the definition of effective intervention strategies are needed to control their growth in these products.

40|$|The {{market of}} freshly {{consumed}} salads is increasing rapidly, {{due to the}} consumer perception of healthiness, their ease to use, and the constant recommendations by many health authorities for a consumption of at least 5 portions of fruit and vegetables by day. Vitamin C, including ascorbic acid (AA) and dehydroascorbic acid (DHA), has many biological activities in the human body. The content of vitamin C in fruits and vegetables can be influenced by {{various factors such as}} genotypic differences, preharvest climatic conditions and cultural practices, maturity and harvesting methods, and postharvest handling procedures (1). Moreover, owing to the lability of vitamin C, the foodstuff content in this compound is frequently used as an indicator of quality and freshness. The determination of vitamin C in freshly consumed salads has therefore a double target: to assess the nutritional value for human vitamin C intake, and to act as a marker of product quality. Many analytical methods, based on different techniques, are reported in the literature for the quantitative determination of vitamin C, but HPLC has demonstrated to be the most reliable (2). The extraction procedure required in vegetables is usually quite time and solvent consuming, involving two or three extraction steps to achieve good recoveries, due mainly to the complexity of the matrix, often with strong cellular walls that encage the analytes. In the present study the application of HPLC to the determination of AA and DHA levels in some freshly consumed salads is described. The method was applied to six varieties of commonly consumed salads: three were vegetables with a soft texture (rocket, red oak leaf, and baby lettuce), the remaining had an harder texture (<b>escarole,</b> continental and romaine lettuce). In order to optimize and to make easier the overall procedure we have introduced some modifications both in the sample pretreatment operations, by the use of an ultrasonic bath, and in the chromatographic determination, with an aqueous mobile phase, achieving good recoveries (> 90 %) and repeatability. Therefore the method demonstrated to be suitable for routine analysis.

40|$|A escarola é uma das hortaliças folhosas mais consumidas em saladas, considerada um alimento rico em nutrientes e compostos antioxidantes. Devido ao seu preparo trabalhoso, este vegetal apresenta forte potencial para o mercado de produtos minimamente processados, porém, este produto apresenta escurecimento nas folhas durante o armazenamento. O objetivo desse trabalho foi avaliar a influência do armazenamento refrigerado, atmosfera modificada passiva e da aplicação de antioxidantes sobre os aspectos de qualidade da escarola minimamente processada. Foram realizados três experimentos. No primeiro experimento, foi avaliado o efeito do armazenamento em quatro temperaturas 0, 5, 10 e 15 °C, por 20 dias a 90 - 95 % UR. No segundo, avaliou-se a utilização da atmosfera modificada passiva pelo acondicionamento do produto em quatro embalagens plásticas: policloreto de polivinila (PVC), polietileno de baixa densidade (PEBD), polipropileno (PP) e polipropileno bi-orientado (BOPP), durante o armazenamento a 0 °C e 90 - 95 % UR por 20 dias. O último experimento objetivou verificar os efeitos da aplicação dos antioxidantes: ácido ascórbico 1 %, ácido cítrico 1 %, ácido oxálico 1 % e ácido etilenodiamino tetra-acético (EDTA) 2 % por 21 dias de armazenamento a 0 °C e 90 - 95 % UR. Em todos os experimentos foram {{realizadas}} as análises de cor, L, C e °h e o índice de escurecimento, teor de ácido ascórbico, teor de clorofila total e carotenoides totais, compostos fenólicos totais e perda de massa. Para o experimento de refrigeração, foram realizadas ainda, as análises de taxa respiratória e produção de etileno. Nos experimentos de embalagens e antioxidantes, foram realizados o monitoramento das concentrações internas de O 2 e CO 2 nas embalagens e a atividade das enzimas polifenoloxidase e peroxidase, sendo que para este último experimento, foram realizadas ainda, análises microbiológicas referentes a ausência ou presença de Salmonella, quantificação de coliformes totais e bactérias psicrotróficas durante o armazenamento. A temperatura de 0 °C é a mais recomendável para a redução de perdas na qualidade da escarola, essa temperatura proporcionou redução da taxa respiratória e perda de massa, bem como foi a que manteve os maiores os teores de ácido ascórbico e de pigmentos dessa hortaliça. Sendo que não foram observados sintomas de dano por frio no produto. Dentre os filmes estudados, constatou-se que as concentrações de 16 % de oxigênio e 3 % de dióxido de carbono geradas no interior do filme de PVC, proporcionaram o menor escurecimento das folhas e maior conservação dos teores de ácido ascórbico, clorofila e carotenoides totais no produto. Observou-se ainda, que a escarola minimamente processada apresenta sensibilidade a altas concentração de CO 2. Para o último experimento, não foi verificada a presença de Salmonella em nenhum dos tratamentos. Entre os antioxidantes aplicados, verificou-se que o tratamento de ácido cítrico 1 % é o mais indicado para conservação dos atributos de qualidade da escarola minimamente processada, por ter mantido baixo índice de escurecimento, os maiores teores de pigmentos e alto teor de ácido ascórbico, bem como ter proporcionado baixa perda de massa e desenvolvimento microbiológico dentro dos limites estabelecidos. <b>Escarole</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} consumed leafy vegetal in salads, it is considered a rich source of nutrients and antioxidant compounds. Due to his arduous preparation for consumption or preparation of dishes, this vegetable shows a strong potential for fresh cut products market, however, this product exhibits browning on its leaves during storage. The objective of this work was to evaluate the influence of refrigerated storage, passive modified atmosphere and the application of antioxidants on quality aspects of fresh cut <b>escarole.</b> Three experiments were carried out. The first experiment evaluated the effect of four storage temperatures 0, 5, 10 and 15 ° C, for 20 days to 90 - 95 % RH. In the second one, the effect of the use of passive modified atmosphere was evaluated by four plastic packaging: polyvinyl chloride (PVC), low density polyethylene (LDPE), polypropylene (PP) and bi-oriented polypropylene (BOPP), during storage at 0 ° C and 90 - 95 % RH for 20 days. The last experiment aimed to check the effects of the application of following antioxidants: ascorbic acid 1 %, citric acid 1 %, oxalic acid 1 % and etilenodiamino tetra-acetic acid (EDTA) 2 % for a period of 21 days of storage at 0 ° C and 90 - 95 % RH. In all experiments were performed the following analysis: color by L, C and °h and observation of browning index, ascorbic acid content, total chlorophyll content, total carotenoids content, total phenolic compounds content and weight loss. For the temperature experiment, the analysis of respiratory rate and ethylene production were also carried out. In the passive modified atmosphere and the antioxidants experiments, the monitoring of concentrations of O 2 and CO 2 in headspace of the packages and the activity of polyphenoloxidase and peroxidase enzymes were also made, and for the last experiment, were carried out microbiological analysis concerning the absence or presence of Salmonella and total coliforms and psychrotrophic bacteria counts during storage. The temperature of 0 °C is the most recommended for the reduction of losses in the fresh cut <b>escarole</b> quality, that temperature provided respiratory rate reduction and reduction of the weight loss as well as was the one that kept the highest contents of ascorbic acid and pigments. Symptoms of chilling injury were not observed on the product during the storage. Among the films studied, it was found that concentrations of 16 % oxygen and 3 % carbon dioxide generated inside the PVC film, provided the minor browning index of the leaves and better conservation of levels of ascorbic acid, chlorophyll and carotenoids. It was observed that the fresh cut <b>escarole</b> is sensitivity to high CO 2 concentrations. In the last experiment, the presence of Salmonella was not detected on the treatments. Between antioxidants applied, it was found that the treatment of citric acid 1 % is the most suitable for the conservation of the fresh cut <b>escarole</b> quality attributes, for keeping low browning index, the highest concentrations of pigments and high content of ascorbic acid, as well as having provided low weight loss and microbiological development within the limits...|$|E
40|$|Optical oxygen sensors {{were used}} to {{ascertain}} the level of oxygen consumed by individual salad leaves for optimised packaging of ready-to-eat (RTE) Italian salad mixes during refrigerated storage. Seven commonly found leaves in Italian salad mixes were individually assessed for oxygen utilisation in packs. Each leaf showed varying levels of respiration throughout storage. Using the information obtained, an experimental salad mix was formulated (termed Mix 3) which consisted of the four slowest respiring salad leaves—Escarole, Frisee, Red Batavia, Lollo Rosso. Mix 3 was then compared against two commercially available Italian salads; Mix 1 (<b>Escarole,</b> Frisee, Radicchio, Lollo Rosso) and Mix 2 (Cos, Frisee, Radicchio, Lollo Rosso). Optical sensors {{were used to}} non-destructively monitor oxygen usage in all mixes throughout storage. In addition to oxygen consumption, all three salad mixes were quality assessed in terms of microbial load and sensorial acceptability. In conclusion, Mix 3 was found to consume {{the least amount of}} oxygen over time, had the lowest microbial load and was most sensorially preferred (p < 0. 05) in terms of overall appearance and acceptability. This study clearly shows the potential that oxygen sensors possess in terms of assisting in the optimised development of commercial RTE salad products...|$|E
