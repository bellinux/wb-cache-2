In this dissertation, we will describe a physical layer that passes information about its confidence in each decoded symbol up to higher layers. These SoftPHY hints have many applications, one of which, more efficient link-layer retransmissions, we will describe in detail. PP-ARQ is a link-layer reliable retransmission protocol that allows a receiver to compactly encode a request for retransmission of only the bits in a packet that are likely in error. Our experimental results show that PP-ARQ increases aggregate network throughput by a factor of approximately 2 x under various conditions. Finally, we will place our contributions in the context of related work and discuss other uses of SoftPHY throughout the wireless networking stack. by Kyle Andrew Jamieson. Thesis (Ph. D.)

5000|$|Dzi stones {{made their}} first {{appearance}} between 2000 and 1000 BC, in ancient India: {{a few hundred}} thousand were supposedly brought back by Tibetan soldiers from Persia or ancient Tajikistan during a raid. The malicious effect of the “evil eye” was taken very seriously by these people. Dzi were considered to counteract the evil eye. The artisans who made the dzi created amulets with “eyes” on them as a “fight fire with fire” form of protection. Artisans used agate as the base stone, and then embellished the beads lines and shapes using ancient methods that remain mysterious. Treatments may have included darkening with plant sugars and heat, bleaching and white line etching with natron, and protecting certain areas with grease, clay, wax or a similar substance. A hole was drilled before the bead was decorated as drilling caused most breakage during the production process, and holes were also useful for stringing and dipping numerous beads as a step in coloration. The earliest holes were conical and done with solid drill bits drilling from both ends and, hopefully, meeting {{near the center of the}} bead. Very small drill tips of chipped flint were used without abrasives and numerous other materials, regardless of hardness, when used with abrasives. Neolithic era beads were also drilled with hollow, tubular abrasion <b>driven</b> <b>bits</b> of reed and, later, during the Chalcolithic, copper. These drilled a hole with a core of agate inside the tubular drill. Tubular bit holes were parallel walled rather than conical, but also done from both ends. Both methods required arduous work done with a bow drill, with time and effort being determined by hardness of abrasive, from ground sand (quartz) to corundum.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, a {{multiple}} electrodynamic type plane loudspeaker <b>driven</b> by 16 <b>bits</b> digital signal is experimentally discussed. The loudspeaker consists of 15 pairs of electrodes and a diaphragm with streamlined sections. The acoustic responses {{are affected by}} the arrangement of the electrodes. Therefore, two cases, (a) a symmetrical and (b) an unsymmetrical arrangements of movingconductors with flat frequency response were examined. Those arrangements of moving conductors are used for suppressing the divided vibration and enlarging the effective area of the vibration. The loudspeaker is driven by discrete voltage, which weighted maximum voltage is 8 Vp-p, and sampling frequency is 48 kHz. The acoustic responses with above two cases were examined. In case of (a), the sound pressure level <b>driven</b> by 16 <b>bits</b> digital signal is about 80 dB at 10 cm from the center of diaphragm, the linearity characteristic is more than 80 dB. In case of (b), each characteristic is the same as (a). However, the frequency responses are different. The klirr factors are 3. 3 % in (a) and 1. 5 % in (b) at 1 kHz. Thus, (b) can reproduce sound more clearer than (a). In conclusion, {{it can be said that}} there is the possibility of 16 bits digital driving loudspeaker...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Presently, digital {{continuous}} media (CM) are well established {{as an integral}} part of many applications. In recent years, a considerable amount of research has focused on the efficient retrieval of such media. Scant attention has been paid to servers that can record such streams in real time. However, more and more devices produce direct digital output streams. Hence, the need arises to capture and store these streams with an efficient data stream recorder that can handle both recording and playback of many streams simultaneously and provide a central repository for all data. We propose a design for a large scale data stream recorder. Our goal was to introduce a unified architecture that integrates multi-stream recording and retrieval in a coherent manner. The discussion raises practical issues such as support for multizone disk <b>drives,</b> variable <b>bit</b> rate media, and disk drives that have a different write than read bandwidth. We provide initial solutions for some issues while others will need to be investigated further. ...|$|R
