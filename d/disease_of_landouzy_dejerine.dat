50|$|FSHD {{was first}} {{described}} in 1884 by French physicians Louis <b>Landouzy</b> and Joseph <b>Dejerine.</b> In their paper <b>of</b> 1886, <b>Landouzy</b> and <b>Dejerine</b> {{drew attention to}} the familial nature of the disorder and mentioned that four generations were affected in the kindred that they had investigated. Formal definition of FSHD's clinical features didn't occur until 1952 when a large Utah family with FSHD was studied. Beginning about 1980 an increasing interest in FSHD led to increased understanding of the great variability in the disease and a growing understanding of the genetic and pathophysiological complexities. By the late 1990s, researchers were finally beginning to understand the regions of Chromosome 4 associated with FSHD.|$|R
40|$|Facioscapulohumeral muscular {{dystrophy}} (FSHD) or <b>Landouzy</b> <b>Dejerine</b> {{muscular dystrophy}} affects one in 20, 000 individuals. It {{is characterized by}} a progressive degeneration of skeletal muscles that progresses asymmetrically from the upper to the lower parts of the body. Although the genetic defect has been known for twelve years, the causative gene has not been identified. Patients exhibit a partial deletion in a series of repeated elements mapping close {{to the end of the}} chromosome 4 long arm. Investigators believe this deletion disturbs chromatin structure over a long distance, affecting the expression of several genes. Our laboratory has identified a gene within the repeated element itself. This gene is functional and encodes a protein, DUX 4, located at the periphery of the cell nucleus. DUX 4 is detected in small amounts in primary myoblasts cultures of patient but not of non-affected individuals. Its forced expression in control cells causes cell death within 48 hours. Patient primary myoblasts present oxidative stress: this phenomenon is also induced by DUX 4 forced expression. In conclusion, we propose the DUX 4 gene as a candidate for FSHD.

50|$|Jules Tinel {{was born}} in 1879 into a family with a five {{generation}} history of medical professionals. He studied in Rouen before moving to Paris. He became externe des hôpitaux in 1901 and interne in 1906. He studied under Charles Emile Troisier, Joseph Jules Dejerine, Louis Théophile Joseph Landouzy and Arnold Netter, and was inspired to study neurology by Dejerine. He received his M.D. in 1910 with a thesis on nerve involvement of tabes which came from work done with <b>Dejerine,</b> <b>Landouzy</b> and Laennec. He became chef de clinique in 1911 and chief of the laboratory at the Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital in 1913.|$|R

All are sulfone-responsive subepidermal bullous diseases associated with linear IgA deposition at the basement membrane zone. In this paper we present a long-term study of 25 cases of adult linear IgA <b>disease,</b> 25 cases <b>of</b> chronic bullous <b>disease</b> <b>of</b> childhood, and four cases of childhood cicatricial pemphigoid, which has revealed further similarities among all three groups. The morphology and distribution of the cutaneous and mucosal lesions were similar; mucosal involvement was present in 80 % of patients with adult linear IgA <b>disease,</b> 64 % <b>of</b> those with chronic bullous <b>disease</b> <b>of</b> childhood, and 100 % of those with childhood cicatricial pemphigoid, and ocular scarring affected patients in all groups.
