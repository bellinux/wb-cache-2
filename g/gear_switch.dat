5000|$|The {{most common}} cause of gear-up {{landings}} is the pilot simply forgetting to extend the landing gear before touchdown. On any retractable gear aircraft, lowering the landing gear is part of the pilot's landing checklist, which also includes items such as setting the flaps, propeller and mixture controls for landing. Pilots who ritually perform such checklists before landing are less likely to land gear-up. However, some pilots neglect these checklists and perform the tasks by memory, increasing the chances of forgetting to lower the landing gear. Even careful pilots are at risk, because they may be distracted and forget to perform the checklist or be interrupted {{in the middle of it}} by other duties such as collision avoidance or another emergency. In the picture shown above, the B-17 Dutchess' Daughter had landed normally, when the copilot inadvertently flipped the landing <b>gear</b> <b>switch</b> to retract. The gear collapsed near the end of the landing roll. [...] The common nature of gear-up landings caused by pilot error has led to an adage within the aviation community: [...] "There are two types of pilots: Those that have landed gear up, and those that will." ...|$|E

Compiled by Stefani J. Evers and Ann L. Shriver. International Institute of Fisheries Economics and Trade (IIFET), Corvallis, 2016. Proceedings of the Eighteenth Biennial Conference of the International Institute of Fisheries Economics and Trade, held July 11 - 15, 2016 at Aberdeen Exhibition and Conference Center (AECC), Aberdeen, Scotland, UK. The paper devises an {{integrated}} ecological–economics–social model {{to assess the}} implementation of ecosystem-based fisheries management in the Pearl River Estuary (PRE) in the South China Sea (SCS). In particular, this paper presents the development of {{an integrated}} model, which links a regional economics social accounting matrix (SAM) model to an ecological model constructed using Ecopath with Ecosim (EwE) software. The impacts on the ecological–economics–social system are examined by varying fishing efforts for four scenarios, including status quo management, fishing effort reduction policy, fishing <b>gear</b> <b>switch</b> policy, and summer closure extension policy. Key results from the predictions (2010 – 2020) and policy simulations illustrate that the collapse effect is apparent in the status quo scenario. Further, re-ducing or switching of fishing effort (e. g. elimination of overfishing and reduced habitat disturbance) positively affects the ecosystem and can lead to economic and social welfare gains in the PRE's economy. The <b>gear</b> <b>switch</b> scenario presents a compromise among the economics, social, and conservation metrics, and also outperforms other scenarios in terms of biomass {{at the end of the}} simulation period. The fishing effort reduction policy performs better than the summer closure extension policy in terms of the con- servation metrics but does relatively poorly in economic terms...|$|E

40|$|Two {{embodied}} gears {{games were}} created. Better learners should use fewer <b>gear</b> <b>switches</b> to reflect their knowledge. Twenty–three 7 th graders, playing as dyads, used gestures to manipulate virtual gears. The Kinect sensor tracked arm-spinning movements and <b>switched</b> <b>gear</b> diameters. Knowledge tests were administered. Statistically significant knowledge gains were seen. For Game 1 (gear spun one direction), switching significantly predicted only pretest knowledge. For Game 2 (gear spun two directions) switching was also {{negatively correlated with}} both tests. For game 2, those who used fewer switches during gameplay understood the construct better scoring higher on both tests. Dyadic analyses revealed the winner used significantly fewer switches. In-process data can provide a window onto knowledge as it is being encoded. However, games should stay within the learner's ZPD, because if the game is too easy (Game 1), meaningful data {{may be difficult to}} gather.

Transient simulation results, i. e. for the activation of the engine brake, show good agreement with measurements. The developed model has been used to analyze the possibility to use the engine brake to facilitate automatic <b>gear</b> <b>switching.</b> This has been verified by measurements on an actual vehicle and resulted in much smoother and faster gear shift...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The extra {{degree of}} freedom offered in hybrid {{electric}} vehicles have inspired many researchers to formulate and solve optimal control problems of various kinds. This paper presents an Approximate Dynamic Programming scheme that efficiently solves the optimal power split between {{the internal combustion engine}} and the electric machine in parallel hybrid powertrains. <b>Gear</b> <b>switches</b> and switches between hybrid and pure electric mode are formally treated. The scheme combines two ideas to reduce the computational time of the iterations performed in the dynamic programming. First, the value function is approximated using piecewise linear functions on a sparse grid. Secondly, by using model approximation the iterations performed in the dynamic programming are reduced to solving scalar quadratic problems. In the simulations the approximation scheme is able to find a good approximation of the optimal control trajectory...|$|R

30|$|As {{seen from}} Fig.  3, the sample {{locomotive}} integration test {{consisted of two}} duty cycles, each with independent acceleration–deceleration procedure. Each time when the locomotive starts up, the air pressurization for air-braking is necessarily carried out at first, {{so that there is}} sufficient compressed air for braking at low speed (≤ 20 km/h). After the preparation as mentioned above, the integration test could be carried out subsequently. As the test rail-line is just about 1  km, it could not test all the <b>gears</b> <b>switching.</b> Besides, as the speed modulation parameters of the two inverters are not optimal, when the locomotive decelerates, in particular in duty cycle # 2, the real-time current drawn is fluctuant with the effect of energy braking, thus resulting in the fluctuating power consumption. The situation that there is some slope in the test rail-line makes the power fluctuation in the return acceleration–deceleration procedure–duty cycle # 2 more serious.|$|R

40|$|In model-based {{nonlinear}} {{optimal control}} switching decisions {{that can be}} optimized often play an important role. Prominent examples of such hybrid systems are <b>gear</b> <b>switches</b> for transport vehicles or on/off valves in chemical engineering. Optimization algorithms {{need to take the}} discrete nature of the variables that model these switching decisions into account. Unnecessarily, for many applications still an equidistant time discretization and either rounding or standard mixed–integer solvers are used. In this article we survey recent progress in theoretical bounds, reformulations, and algorithms for this problem class and show how process control can benefit from them. We propose a comprehensive algorithm based on the solution of a sequence of purely continuous problems and simulations, and provide a new and more compact proof for its well-posedness. Instead of focusing on a particular application, we classify different solution behaviors in the applications section. We provide references to respective case studies with prototype character and cite newly emerging benchmark libraries. We conclude by pointing out future challenges for process control with switching decisions. Key words: hybrid systems, optimal control, integer programming, MINLP 1...|$|R
