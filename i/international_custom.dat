500|$|The {{structure}} of Church heraldry developed {{significantly in the}} 17th century when a system for ecclesiastical hats attributed to Pierre Palliot came into use. The full system of emblems around the shield was regulated in the Catholic Church by the letter of Pope Pius X Inter multiplices curas of February 21, 1905, while {{the composition of the}} shield itself was regulated through the Heraldry Commission of the Roman Curia until this office was abolished by Pope John XXIII in 1960. The Annuario Pontificio ceased publishing the arms of Cardinals and previous Popes after 1969. <b>International</b> <b>custom</b> and national law govern limited aspects of Church heraldry, but shield composition is now largely guided by expert advice.

500|$|Modernisation {{had slowed}} {{by the early}} 1990s; Savile Row tailors were [...] "struggling to find {{relevance}} with an audience that had grown increasingly disassociated". Three tailors, Ozwald Boateng, Timothy Everest (an apprentice of Nutter's), and Richard James, then became known for revitalising the bespoke style for the modern market - [...] having each broken away independently from the Savile Row mould. Public relations professional Alison Hargreaves coined the term [...] "New Bespoke Movement" [...] to describe collectively the work of this [...] "new generation" [...] of tailors. Interest reached a peak in 1997 when the three were featured together in Vanity Fair. The newcomers altered their shop fronts and used marketing and publicity to their advantage; challenging the traditional Savile Row styling, they brought twists and [...] "a fine sense of colour to bespoke suits." [...] They were seen to [...] "push the envelope of modern suit making and bespoke active wear, creating more contemporary silhouettes with bolder fabrics," [...] {{and set out to}} attract celebrity clients, sell their clothing via supermarket chains, and attract wider national and <b>international</b> <b>custom,</b> raising the profile of their new tailoring style.|$|E

50|$|As {{international}} trade, {{exploration and}} warfare became more involved and complex, {{the need for}} common <b>international</b> <b>customs</b> and practices became even more important. The Hanseatic League {{of the more than}} 150 entities in what is now Germany, Scandinavia, and the Baltic states developed many useful <b>international</b> <b>customs,</b> which facilitated trade and communication among other things. The Italian city-states developed diplomatic rules, as they began sending ambassadors to foreign capitals. Treaties—agreements between governments intended to be binding—became a useful tool to protect commerce. The horrors of the Thirty Years' War, meanwhile, created an outcry for rules of combat that would protect civilian communities.|$|R

5000|$|Customary {{international}} law, like {{international treaty}} law, {{is recognized as}} a primary source of public international law. While international treaties are written agreements by which States establish certain rules, customary international law consists of unwritten rules which derive from “general practice accepted as law”. [...] Therefore, for a rule of <b>international</b> <b>custom</b> to be established, two elements are required: “an objective one, the repeated behaviour of States ... and a subjective one, the belief that such behaviour depends on a legal obligation (opinio juris sive necessitatis)”. The objective element is also {{often referred to as}} State practice; the subjective element as opinio juris.|$|E

5000|$|Article 38 (1) of the Statute of the International Court of Justice is {{generally}} {{recognized as a}} definitive statement {{of the sources of}} international law.

50|$|It {{provided}} {{admission of}} foreign-built ships to the American registry for foreign trade, {{making it easier}} for them to legally hoist the American flag. The bill provided for the survey, measurement, and inspection of such ships, though it did not require American ownership of a majority of stock in corporations applying for American registry, which was a clear violation of <b>international</b> <b>custom</b> and international law. Theoretically, Germany could get American registration, hoist the U.S. flag on its merchant vessels, and avoid the British Blockade. This possibility provoked much British protest; however, the German owners of vessels in American harbors dared not risk losing their property and did not take advantage of the act.|$|E
50|$|On the {{question}} of preference between sources of international law, rules established by treaty will take preference if such an instrument exists. It is also argued however that international treaties and <b>international</b> <b>custom</b> are sources of international law of equal validity; this is that new custom may supersede older treaties and new treaties may override older custom. Also, is cogens (peremptory norm) is a custom, not a treaty. Certainly, judicial decisions and juristic writings are regarded as auxiliary sources of international law, whereas {{it is unclear whether}} the general principles of law recognized by 'civilized nations' should be recognized as a principal or auxiliary source of international law. Nevertheless, treaty, custom, and general principles of law are generally recognized as primary sources of international law.|$|E
