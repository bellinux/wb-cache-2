40|$|International audienceToday, the new {{measurement}} techniques without contact like the laser sensors are used {{more and more}} in industrial applications. They allow to obtain many points in a short time. However these techniques have a less good accuracy than the classical process with contact probe for metrology application. The work presented in this paper, is part of a research project on the <b>in-process</b> <b>product</b> inspection. In the case of <b>in-process</b> <b>product</b> inspection, the throughput time must be the shortest with a good dimensional accuracy. So, it is necessary to increase the measurement accuracy of the points cloud for using the laser scanners. For this first approach, we suggest to build a measurement procedure based on the digitised points quality: the points having the required quality alone are kept for the numerical calculation. To do that, a quality cartography giving the measurement accuracy is developed. This one is based on the sensor dispersion modelling. We show, by a concrete example, how it is possible to increase the accuracy of the inspection results in introducing the local measurement uncertainty...|$|E
40|$|The current sets of internationally-recognized {{standards}} and some national guidelines {{in the area}} of coordinate measurement systems (CMS) represent a fundamental way to ensure better communication about a system 2 ̆ 019 s specifications between users and manufacturers. The documentary and physical standards produced to date help solve part of an issue faced by companies that integrate contact or non-contact three-dimensional (3 D) coordinate measurement machines (CMM) into their production pipeline: deciding in which technology to invest. Quality CMMs typically involve a significant investment when considering the cost of equipment, training, software, and maintenance contracts over the functional lifetime of a given system or systems, notwithstanding the requirements of the global nature of manufacturing activities. With recent interests in portable CMMs, documentary and physical standards have attracted the attention of industrial users and the technical community at large. Both tethered like articulated arm CMM (AACMM) and untethered like optically tracked CMM (OTCMM) systems have emerged from being nice to have to the must have 3 D equipment on the shop floor.

40|$|Due to {{increasing}} international competition, shorter product life-cycles, variable demand, diverse customer needs and customized products, manufacturers are forced from mass production {{to the production}} of a large product mix. Traditional manufacturing systems, such as job shops and flow lines, cannot provide such requirements efficiently coupled with flexibility to handle these changes. Cellular Manufacturing (CM) is an alternate manufacturing system combining the high throughput rates of line layouts with the flexibility offered by functional layouts (job shops). The benefits include reduced set-up times, material handling, <b>in-process</b> inventory, better <b>product</b> quality, and faster response time. The benefits of CM can only be achieved by sufficiently incorporating the real-life structural and operational features of a manufacturing plant when creating the cellular layout.

The proposed Dynamic Cellular Manufacturing Systems (DCMSs) model considers several manufacturing attributes such as multiperiod production planning, dynamic system relocation, duplicate machines, machine capacities, available time for workers, worker assignments, and machine breakdowns. The objective is to minimize total manufacturing cost comprised of holding cost, outsourcing cost, intercell material handling cost, maintenance and overhead cost, machine relocation cost as well as salary, hiring, and firing costs of the workers.

The concept of total quality control test refers to the process of striving to produce a quality product by a series of measures, requiring an organized effort in order to eliminate errors at every stage in the production. In process product testing is done in order to check the conformance of the final product with the compendial standards as specified in the pharmacopoeias. As the final sample taken for the finished product testing is only a representative of a large batch, a significant difference still remains. The pharmacopoeias have laid down the specified limits within which the value should fall in order to be compliant as per the standards. The official pharmacopoeias {{in different parts of the}} world specify the quality requirements for pharmaceutical products. However the parameters and standards differ to some extent from each other.

Includes bibliographical references (page 71 - 74). Quality control of pharmaceutical product emphasizes on various testing of the product which include both <b>in-process</b> and finished <b>product</b> quality control tests that are conducted prior to release of the drug in the market. In the present study the quality control parameters of ten different brands of Montelukast tablets available in Bangladesh were evaluated and compared to assess {{the quality of the}} tablets. The samples of the tablets were taken from five leading pharmaceutical companies of Bangladesh represented as A to E respectively, three medium ranked companies designated as F, G, H and two low ranked companies denoted as I and J respectively. Quality control tests such as weight variation, friability, hardness as well as disintegration tests were performed. In vitro dissolution study was carried out and analyzed by HPLC to determine the percentage release of drug after 30 minutes which may reflect in vivo performance of the drug. The weight variation results show that there was hardly any variation among the leading pharmaceutical companies (value ranging 0. 17 ± 0. 01 gm to 0. 2 ± 0. 01 gm) except for company B (0. 35 ± 0. 01 gm) and the middle and lower ranked company showed slightly higher results. The tablets of all the ten companies showed acceptable values of hardness except for one low-ranked company J with a high value of 16. 57 ± 1. 4 kg/cm 2. There is a marginal difference in the result of the friability test of the all the ten companies (all values less than 1 % according to BP specification), signifying that the Montelukast tablets produced by the different companies of Bangladesh have sufficient mechanical strength to withstand the pressure due to processing, storage and shipment. Disintegration times of the tablets of leading companies were found to be within 3 minutes indicating a very good result except for company A (7. 40 ± 0. 9 minutes). Company F and company I showed the highest disintegration times (9. 4 ± 1. 17 minutes and 9. 8 ± 3. 6 minutes respectively). Consequently, the percentage release of drug for company A, company F and company I are less compared to other companies as shown by the dissolution study. Nevertheless, all the companies showed greater than 90 % dissolution of drug after 30 minutes, thus complying with the specifications of British Pharmacopeia and US FDA guidelines for INN drugs. Hence, it can be concluded that Montelukast tablets produced by the pharmaceutical companies in Bangladesh are of consistent quality with very little variation among them and complies with the specifications of British Pharmacopeia.

40|$|Cellular {{manufacturing}} (CM) {{has emerged}} {{because of the}} need for manufacturing organizations to supply products that require more customization and that have shorter product life cycles and times to market. This shift from mass production to demands for mid-volume and mid-variety product mixes has shown that traditional manufacturing systems relying on functional or line layouts are not efficient and flexible enough. CM is an alternate manufacturing system combining the high throughput rates of line layouts with the flexibility offered by functional layouts (job shops). The benefits include reduced set-up times, material handling, <b>in-process</b> inventory, better <b>product</b> quality and market response time. The benefits of CM can only be achieved by sufficiently incorporating the real-life structural and operational features of a manufacturing plant when creating the cellular layout. This research presents two integrated CM models, with an extensive coverage of important manufacturing structural and operational features. The first CM model is initially formulated as a mixed integer non-linear program that incorporates multi-period production planning and dynamic system reconfiguration with deterministic production requirements. It consists of alternate process routings, the operation sequence of parts, machine duplication, machine procurement and machine capacity. Preliminary computational experiments show that only small-scale problems can be solved using the developed mixed integer non-linear program. This warrants the linearization procedures that are proposed to convert it into a linearized mixed integer programming formulation so as to solve problems of larger scale. This linearized mixed integer program is first solved using an exact solution (ES) procedure through the simplex-based branch and cut procedure of CPLEX software. Computational results are presented by solving some small-scale to large-scale numerical examples, extracted from existing literature. Although small to medium-sized problems can be solved using ES, larger ones (representing real-life sized problems) cannot be solved within reasonable computational times. A tabu search meta-heuristic is, therefore, developed to solve this mixed integer linear program. The results show that the tabu search procedure generates good quality solutions for real-life size problems within acceptable computational times. The second model addresses the same attributes as the first one but an important extension is the introduction of routing flexibility in the system by the formation of additional alternate part process routings, called contingency routings. In addition to the alternate main process routings being created for each part type, the model forms contingency routings, which serve as backups so as to effectively address the reality of part process routing disruptions, thus allowing the cellular manufacturing system to operate in a continuous manner even in the event of any breakdowns. This enhanced model is formulated as a mixed integer linear program and is then solved using the simplex-based branch and cut procedure of CPLEX (ES). The results show that the contingency and main routings can be formed simultaneously, thus bringing enhanced system and routing flexibility. The trade-off between the increased system flexibility obtained versus the additional cost to be incurred through the formation of contingency routings for all parts is discussed by comparing the solutions obtained from the model without routing flexibility and the one with routing flexibility. It is found that the enhanced system flexibility enabled by contingency routings offsets the additional system investment costs.
