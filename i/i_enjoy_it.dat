After the season, Brown joined the basketball team, but eventually re-dedicated his focus on football.|$|E
500|$|Within {{his first}} year on Coronation Street, Thompson had acted out scenes that {{involved}} his character stealing a car, graffiting {{the wall of the}} local newsagents, and discovering that his mother's fiancée was having a gay affair with her male best friend. Still impressed with Thompson's acting ability, producers of the series had his contract extended to 2009. Reflecting on {{his first year}} in the soap, Thompson said: [...] "It's been a really strange year and a lot of things have happened. It's been absolutely brilliant. The filming is everything that I could have wanted it to be. It's fantastic and <b>I</b> <b>enjoy</b> <b>it</b> more than anything." [...] He added: [...] "My favourite story lines so far have been doing the graffiti and stealing the car. I really enjoyed filming those two." ...|$|E

500|$|Loud was {{recorded}} in various recording studios worldwide including the Larrabee Sound Studios, The Village and Westlake Recording Studios in Los Angeles, Platinum Sound Recording Studios, and Roc the Mic Studios in New York City and The Bunker Studios in Paris. In September 2010, during a webchat with her fansite Rihannadaily.com, Rihanna announced that the album would be called Loud, saying [...] "get Loud everybody, get crazy, get excited, because I'm pumped. I'm just gonna be me, because that's what you guys love the most, and that's what makes me feel best. Just being normal, normal for me is Loud! Sassy, fun, flirty, energetic." [...] While Rihanna was filming Battleship, she explained {{in an interview with}} Entertainment Tonight, [...] "Loud is, the word, the name of the album definitely reflects the attitude of it, it's really sassy and flirty and it grabs your attention and that's why <b>I</b> <b>enjoy</b> <b>it.</b> It takes you through a really really interesting ride. So colorful the album." ...|$|E

From the start of August, Darwin began going there each day to [...] "dine at the Athenæum like a gentleman, or rather like a Lord, for I am sure the first evening I sat in that great drawing room, all on a sofa by myself, I felt just like a duke. – I am full of admiration at the Athenæum; one meets so many people there, that one likes to see. ... <b>I</b> <b>enjoy</b> <b>it</b> the more, because I fully expected to detest it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Searching for the Young Soul Rebels was {{released}} to positive reviews from music critics. Melody Maker named {{it one of}} the best albums of 1980 in its year-end list, while NME named it the tenth best album of the year. David Hepworth, however, reviewing the album in Smash Hits, was dismissive and felt that [...] "potentially good songs are dragged down by mannered vocals and would-be epic arrangements". Calling it [...] "a weird record", Robert Christgau wrote: [...] "Never have soul horns sounded remotely as sour, and Kevin Rowland can't carry a tune to the next note. There are horn interjections that make me laugh out loud at their perfectly timed wrong rightness, and with Kevin Rowland quavering through his deeply felt poesy and everybody else blaring away, <b>I</b> <b>enjoy</b> <b>it</b> {{in much the same way}} I enjoy a no wave band on a good night".|$|E

2500|$|Ian Beale {{has gone}} on to be the longest running {{character}} in the soap's history and, until the returns of Sharon Watts in August 2012, Kathy Beale in February 2015 and Michelle Fowler in December 2016, was the only remaining original character. Woodyatt confirmed his desire to remain with the show in 2010, during the show's 25th anniversary: [...] "Why would I want to leave when I'm {{not going to get the}} chance to portray even half the range of emotions I get to here in a one-off drama or a six-part series? And you're not going to get the same viewing figures either. You have your moments when things go wrong and you perhaps don't want to work with a certain person. In any office there are going to be people who don't get along but you get on with it and on the whole <b>I</b> <b>enjoy</b> <b>it.</b> Over the last couple of years we've had a really tight crew and it's the best atmosphere I can remember.
