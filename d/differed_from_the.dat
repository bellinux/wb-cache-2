60|$|Science is, I believe, {{nothing but}} trained and {{organised}} common sense, <b>differing</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> latter {{only as a}} veteran may <b>differ</b> <b>from</b> a raw recruit: and its methods <b>differ</b> <b>from</b> those of common sense only {{so far as the}} guardsman's cut and thrust <b>differ</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> manner in which a savage wields his club.|$|R

5|$|The Russian system <b>differed</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> British and American {{systems in}} its {{relationship}} with indigenous peoples. Using the same method they had used in Siberia, the Russians employed or enserfed Aleut and Alutiiq people, the latter being a subgroup of the Yupik Eskimo people. The Aleut and Alutiiq people were expert sea otter hunters, noted for their use of kayaks and baidarkas. Russian ships were mainly used for transporting and assisting native hunting parties. This <b>differed</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> British and American system, where the natives hunted sea otters and prepared the furs on their own, and were essentially independent agents of the fur trade. The Russians did not trade freely with the native Alaskans; rather, they imposed a fur tribute known as yasak. The yasak system, which was widely used in Siberia, essentially enslaved the natives. In 1788, it was banned in Russian America, only {{to be replaced by}} compulsory labor.|$|E
5|$|The basic Su-25 {{model was}} used as the basis for a {{commercial}} export variant, known as the Su-25K (Komercheskiy). This model was also built at Factory 31 in Tbilisi, Georgia.

A total of 180 Su-25K aircraft were built between 1984 and 1989.|$|E

5|$|After the Second World Congress in 1948, the International Secretariat {{attempted}} to open communications with Josip Broz Tito's regime in Yugoslavia. In their analysis, it <b>differed</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{rest of the}} Eastern Bloc because it was established by the partisans of World War II who had fought against Nazi occupation, as opposed to by Stalin's invading armies. The British RCP, led by Jock Haston and supported by Ted Grant, were highly critical of this move.|$|E
5|$|Grant's {{claims that}} Indian spiritual traditions like Tantra and Yoga {{correlate}} to Western esoteric traditions, {{and that both}} stem from a core, ancient source, has parallels in the perennial philosophy promoted by the Traditionalist School of esotericists. However, Grant differed from Traditionalists like René Guénon and Ananda Coomaraswamy in his positive assessment of Western occultism. Moreover, Grant's appreciation of Asian spiritual traditions has {{much in common with}} Theosophy, although Grant <b>differed</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Theosophical movement with his valorisation of the 'left hand path'.|$|E
5|$|House Democrats had {{expected}} {{to be able to}} negotiate changes in a House-Senate conference before passing a final bill. Since any bill that emerged from conference that <b>differed</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Senate bill would have to pass the Senate over another Republican filibuster, most House Democrats agreed to pass the Senate bill on condition that it be amended by a subsequent bill. They drafted the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, which could be passed by the reconciliation process.|$|E

5|$|In 1906, Charles Horton Peck {{described}} the variety magna from material collected in North Elba, New York. Peck {{explained that the}} variety <b>differed</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> typical species in several ways: var. magna grew among fallen leaves under balsam fir trees, or among mosses on the ground, not on buried wood; it lacked a stem, and was instead broad and rounded underneath; its hymenium was more yellow-brown then the nominate variety; and, its spore were slightly longer.|$|E
5|$|In 1985, G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero spawned {{an annual}} {{publication}} called G.I. Joe: Yearbook. G.I.

Each issue contained articles about the animated TV program, a summary of the comic book's plot to date, and one or two original stories written by Larry Hama. G.I. Joe: Yearbook ran until 1988.|$|E
5|$|In addition, Constantine {{appears to}} have reorganised the border forces along the Danube, {{replacing}} the old-style alae and cohortes with new units of cunei (cavalry) and auxilia (infantry) respectively. It is unclear how the new-style units <b>differed</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> old-style ones, but those stationed on the border (as opposed {{to those in the}} comitatus) may have been smaller, perhaps half the size. In sectors other than the Danube, old-style auxiliary regiments survived.|$|E

5|$|On 23 February 1908, {{less than}} six weeks after the inquiry closed, the Local Government Board issued a draft {{provisional}} bill for the federation of the six towns. This was not unexpected but the rating scheme proposed <b>differed</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> schemes discussed during the inquiry and included a complicated valuation of the properties belonging to each municipality, something {{that none of the}} towns wished to carry out. Nevertheless, Hanley, Longton and Tunstall all supported the draft order while Stoke, Fenton and Burslem opposed it.|$|E
5|$|Oryzomys from Costa Rica have {{historically}} been referred to O.c.couesi, but Hanson and colleagues found that two specimens from Refugio Nacional de Vida Silvestre Mixto Maquenque, northeastern Costa Rica, differed as much from other O.couesi (11.93% Cytb sequence divergence) as O.couesi <b>differed</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> marsh rice rat (11.30%). They suggested that these animals represented a species distinct from O.couesi, but were unable to resolve the correct name for the species {{because they could not}} examine samples of dimidiatus or richmondi.|$|E
5|$|The Pilgrims were Brownist English Dissenters; {{they sought}} {{a version of}} the Christian {{religion}} without things they deemed nonessential, such as bishops or Christmas. They <b>differed</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Puritans; the Pilgrims were stricter, and instead of seeking to reform the Church of England from within, sought to separate themselves from it. They had left England for the Netherlands because in 1608, King James I began to persecute Separatists. Among those who fled then was William Bradford.|$|E
