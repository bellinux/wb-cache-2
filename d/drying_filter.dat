40|$|The {{control of}} coating layer {{properties}} {{is becoming increasingly}} important {{as a result of}} an emerging demand for novel coated paper-based products and an increasing popularity of new coating application methods. The governing mechanisms of microstructure formation dynamics during consolidation and drying are nevertheless, still poorly understood. Some of the difficulties encountered by experimental methods can be overcome by the utilisation of numerical modelling and simulation-based studies of the consolidation process. The objective of this study was to improve the fundamental understanding of pigment coating consolidation and structure formation mechanisms taking place on the microscopic level. Furthermore, it is aimed to relate the impact of process and suspension properties to the microstructure of the coating layer. A mathematical model based on a modified Stokesian dynamics particle simulation technique was developed and applied in several studies of consolidation-related phenomena. The model includes particle-particle and particle-boundary hydrodynamics, colloidal interactions, Born repulsion, and a steric repulsion model. The Brownian motion and a free surface model were incorporated to enable the specific investigation of consolidation and <b>drying.</b> <b>Filter</b> cake stability was simulated in various particle systems, and subjected to a range of base substrate absorption rates and system temperatures. The stability of the filter cake was primarily affected by the absorption rate and size of particles. Temperature was also shown to have an influence. The consolidation of polydisperse systems, with varying wet coating thicknesses, was studied using imposed pilot trial and model-based drying conditions. The results show that drying methods have a clear influence on the microstructure development, on small particle distributions in the coating layer and also on the mobility of particles during consolidation. It is concluded that colloidal properties can significantly impact coating layer shrinkage as well as the internal solids concentration profile. Visualisations of particle system development in time and comparison of systems at different conditions are useful in illustrating coating layer structure formation mechanisms. The results aid in understanding the underlying mechanisms of pigment coating layer consolidation. Guidance is given regarding the relationship between coating process conditions and internal coating slurry properties and their effects on the microstructure of the coating...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background A simple {{filter paper}} method was {{developed}} for, the {{transport and storage}} of monoclonal antibodies (Mabs) at room temperature or - 20 °C after spotting on filter paper, for subsequent serotyping of outer membrane antigens of N. meningitidis by dot-blot ELISA. Methods Monoclonal antibodies (Mabs) were spotted within a 0. 5 – 1 cm diameter area of Whatman grade 903 paper, which were stored individually at room temperature or at - 20 °C. These MAbs were stored and analyzed after periods of one week, 4 weeks, 12 months, or 13 years {{in the case of}} frozen Mab aliquots, or after 4 weeks at - 20 °C or at room temperature (RT) in the case of Mabs <b>dried</b> on <b>filter</b> paper strips. Assays were performed in parallel using dot-blot ELISA. In addition to the MAbs specific for serotyping class 1, 2 or 3, we used a larger number of Mabs for polysaccharides, lipooligosaccharides (LOS), class 5 and cross-reactive antigens for native outer membrane of N. meningitidis. The Mabs <b>dried</b> on <b>filter</b> paper were eluted with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0. 2 % gelatin. Results Mabs of the isotypes IgG and IgM <b>dried</b> on <b>filter</b> papers were not affected by duration of storage. The detection by serotyping Mabs was generally consistent for <b>dried</b> <b>filter</b> paper MAb samples stored frozen for over 1 year at - 20 °C, and although decreased reactive antibody titers were found after storage, this did not interfere with the specificity of the Mabs used after 13 years as <b>dry</b> spots on <b>filter</b> paper. Conclusion The use of filter paper is an inexpensive and convenient method for collecting, storing, and transporting Mab samples for serotyping studies. In addition, the samples occupy little space and can be readily transported without freezing. The efficiency of using immunoglobulin G (IgG) or M (IgM) eluted was found to be consistent with measurement of IgG or IgM titers in most corresponding, ascites Mabs stored frozen for over 1 year. The application of meningococcal typing methods and designations depend on the question being asked. </p...|$|R

40|$|The lack of falcilities for {{veterinary}} services, such as analytical laboratories, {{which are}} {{distant from the}} field and at immense distances are aggravated by the constraint of transporting and preserving the samples. A method where a certain amount of the urine sample is absorbed onto <b>filter</b> paper, but <b>dried</b> in the field and then sent to the laboratory (<b>Dried</b> <b>Filter</b> Paper Method, DFPM), has been used in human medicine, but never applied in the veterinary field. The practice of expressing various urinary minerals/electrolytes relative to till' concentration of creatinine has recently become generally accepted. A single sample obviates the need for collection of urine over a 24 -hour period. Fractional excretion (FE) of minerals and electrolytes (which is the mineral or electrolyte to creatinine ratio), is a simple, inexpensive measurement and a reasonable indicator of the renal clearance of minerals/electrolytes, using a single urine sample. The investigation was divided into two phases, The first was conducted entirely in vitro, using simulated urine (artificial and goat urine) <b>dried</b> on <b>filter</b> paper, manipulated in various ways under laboratory conditions, and the second phase was conducted in vivo and in vitro, using urine (collected from water-deprived goats) <b>dried</b> on <b>filter</b> paper and manipulated in various ways under laboratory conditions. Determination of mineral/electrolyte to creatinine ratios using the <b>dried</b> <b>filter</b> paper method consisted of Impregnating a specific filter paper with a specific volume of artificial/goat urine, diluted in a specific eluent, and then analysed for the analytes (creatinine, phosphate, chloride, magnesium, calcium, sodium, and potassium). Due to the wide range of filter papers, which could have been used for the trial, it was necessary to run an experiment to identify the best for the purpose. The experiment used filter papers from : 2 different brands (Whatman® and Scheicher&Schuel filter papers). The following filter paper were compared: Whatman® no 2, 3, 5, 6, 42, 43, 44, and 542 and 860, 593, 595. 597, 598 for Schleicher&Schuell (very high quality). There were few significant differences. Whatman filter paper number 6, was chosen, because of the constant and uniform mineral/electrolyte to creatinine ratios. The very high variability of urine mineral/electrolyte concentrations in ruminants, and the limited linearity range of routine analytical equipment, constrains the routine use of laboratory analysers in urine mineral and electrolyte assessment. One of the approaches is to use a diluent, with a particular mineral/electrolyte concentration near to {{the lower end of the}} linear/standardised range. Therefore, "mixing" a small volume of urine with the diluent will result in a final mineral/electrolyte concentration, that falls into a linear and controlled/standard range for the particular mineral and electrolyte. A diluent was tested and the results for analytes show a high interclass correlation (R 1 > 0. 75) between the expected and the calculated values of this ratio. The stability of mineral/electrolyte to creatinine ratio (B/Cr) in artificial and goat urine specimens using the <b>dried</b> <b>filter</b> paper method stored at 2 different temperatures during ten days was also evaluated experimently. While it has been found that P/Cr ratio, Mg/Cr ratio, K/Cr ratio are stable for the 10 days, the Cl/Cr ratio, Ca/Cr ratio, and Na/Cr were found to be less stable during the same period of time. The average results do not differ significantly from the control in either the artificial urine or the goat urine. Experiments were conducted to evaluate the reproducibility of artificial urine and artificial urine diluted 1 : 5 to simulate reproducibility of mineral/electrolyte to creatinine ratios with higher and lower concentrations, respectively. The results indicate a relatively good reproducibility of the method, because the variation, as measured by standard deviation, is small relative to the mean, except for Cl/Cr ratio and Ca/Cr ratio, where the results presented showed a relatively low reproducibility. In theory, since ratios can be obtained, and should be unchanged by taking measurements at different dilutions even if the amount of specimen is unknown, there should be no need to absorb a fixed amount of urine onto the filter paper when urine is collected, using this method. However, there appear to be limits to this in reality, dilution of urine below a 1 : 10 dilution and/or the volume impregnated onto the filter paper below 0. 525 ml on Whatman® number 6 filter paper. An experiment with goats on the relationship between the influence of water deprivation on minerallelectrulvte to creatinine ratio over a period of time demonstrated that concentrations and excretion of electrolytes vary from animal to animal, but the mineral/electrolyte to creatinine ratios by DFPM hardly vary, even if the goat is deprived of water. Using goat urine to determe mineral/electrolyte to creatinine ratio with the <b>dried</b> <b>filter</b> paper method gives high interclass correlation for mineral/electrolyte to creatinine ratio between the control (fresh urine sample, preserved in freezer) and the <b>dried</b> <b>filter</b> paper method on goats given water ad libitum. Interclass correlation agreement for the two methods was R 1 > 0. 75. On the basis of the results, the method is robust for use as a urine sample preservation and transportation method for the determination of mineral/electrolyte to creatinine ratio with an added advantage of not needing either preservative or refrigeration.
