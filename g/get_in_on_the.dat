2500|$|Lucky's rich life {{experience}} for his young age makes him wise beyond his years. He plays cons {{with his parents}} and is always {{able to make a}} quick get away; in his introduction storyline, he travels from Canada to Port Charles on his own when his parents have to send him ahead for safety. He later is able to stay one step ahead of his parents when he and his friend Emily Quartermaine (then Tamblyn) briefly run away. He has a loving relationship with his unconventional parents, who often treat him as a friend and peer, especially his father. Luke in turn looks to see himself in Lucky, and the two have a very close bond. In 1995, Jackson described to the Los Angeles Times: [...] "Lucky lives every boy's dream. He has loving parents, a baby sister, a loyal dog, and even a little bit of danger in his life. But with parents like Luke and Laura, he can't help but <b>get</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> action." ...|$|E

The creative industries - film, music, games, for example - are different. We all know that. But they are spectacularly different from more traditional industries. And the differences are inherent in the very nature of the creative process. Failure is endemic in corporate life. More than 10 per cent of firms disappear every year - here, in Europe and in America. But side by side with failure comes success.
