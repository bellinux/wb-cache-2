5|$|Despite {{a serious}} {{heart attack in}} 1988 MacMillan {{continued}} to work intensely. In 1989 {{he made his first}} new ballet for Covent Garden for five years, a new version of Britten's The Prince of the Pagodas. The company had never found the original 1956 Cranko version satisfactory, and it was neglected during the composer's lifetime. MacMillan thought the piece could be successfully reworked with some cuts to the score, but the Britten estate refused to allow any alterations. MacMillan reverted to classical ballet for the piece, creating a fairy-tale work far from his accustomed style. The result was not judged among his best works, but it marked the emergence of the 19-year-old Darcey Bussell, whom he picked to dance the young heroine. Along with the former Bolshoi principal dancer Irek Mukhamedov, who joined the Royal Ballet in 1991, Bussell was MacMillan's final important muse. For the two of them he created Winter Dreams (1991), inspired by Chekhov's Three Sisters. Mukhamedov was the brutish male leading character in MacMillan's last ballet, The <b>Judas</b> <b>Tree</b> (1992).|$|E

She began writing in the nineteen twenties and states in her introduction, “It was not necessary to go to Paris to write poetry. ” Her verse is replete with the cadences and landscape of the West. Flanner’s poetry has both urban and contemporary themes, but its main emphasis lies with Earth—cicadas, valley weeds, sassafras and <b>Judas</b> <b>trees.</b> Flanner’s imagery takes the reader beyond the surface of description.

60|$|He put an {{arm over}} the back of the seat, and assumed a more {{comfortable}} attitude. He glanced at Miriam, who was sitting in a lax, thoughtful pose with her eyes on the flowers. She was wearing her old dress, she had not had time to change, and the blue tones of her old dress brought out a certain warmth in her skin, and her pose exaggerated whatever was feminine in her rather lean and insufficient body, and rounded her flat chest delusively. A little line of light lay along her profile. The afternoon was full of transfiguring sunshine, children were playing noisily in the adjacent sandpit, some <b>Judas</b> <b>trees</b> were brightly abloom in the villa gardens that bordered the Recreation Ground, and all the place was bright with touches of young summer colour. It all merged with the effect of Miriam in Mr. Polly's mind.|$|R

5000|$|The Garden of Forgiveness is {{a project}} under {{development}} in the BCD. The garden is a socio-cultural project that commemorates the scars of the Lebanese Civil War, hence its location along the Green Line that once divided the city between warring factions. Members from more than six religious denominations {{have participated in the}} concept, plan, and development of the project. The garden's site is currently filled with uncovered ruins from over fifteen civilizations, most importantly the remains of the Roman city of Berytus. The square is surrounded by three mosques (Mohammad Al-Amin Mosque, Emir Assaf Mosque, Grand Omari Mosque) and three churches (Saint George Maronite Cathedral, St. Elie Greek Melkite Catholic Cathedral, St. Georges Greek Orthodox Cathedral). The award-winning design was conceived by Kathryn Gustafson, the acclaimed architect behind the Princess Diana Memorial Fountain in London. According to the designers, Lebanon's [...] "will to become unified and prosperous" [...] will be symbolized by selecting plants representing the regions of Lebanon, including <b>Judas</b> <b>trees</b> from the mountains, olive groves from the agricultural plains, and citrus trees from the coast. The archaeological heritage of the site will be respected by referencing the Cardo (main north-south road) and Decumanus (main east-west road), to create strong linear axes. Traces of the ancient pathway will also be highlighted in the design, along with a 4000-year-old heart-shaped well that is believed to had been related to the goddess Astarte. A proposal was also made to add a 9/11 memorial for all the Lebanese victims that went down in the attack.|$|R
