Despite recent advances in experimental and theoretical studies of FTJs, many questions concerning their electrical behaviour still remain open.

40|$|Abstruct-Characterization and {{simulation}} of minority-carrier well-type guard rings in epitaxial substrate at 77 K were per-formed and {{compared with those}} at RT. The escape probability in a narrow guard-ring structure under {{the same amount of}} minority carrier injection increases by about one order of mag-nitude when temperature decreases to 77 K. This degradation in the guard-ring efficiency {{can be attributed to the}} enhanced drift mechanism in the conductivity-modulated layer between the well bottom <b>junction</b> and the <b>epitaxial</b> highnow <b>junction</b> at 77 K. In contrast, this mechanism enhances the width dependence of the escape probability at 77 K. The higher minority-carrier recombination velocity of the <b>epitaxial</b> high-low <b>junction</b> con-tributes to the stronger width dependence secondarily. When the epitaxial layer thickness becomes thinner, the simulation also demonstrates a stronger width dependence of the escape current as well as a reduction in its magnitude. A lightly-doped epitaxial layer on a heavily-doped substrate exhibits even more importance in the guard ring efficiency for low temperature operation, and its thickness should be kept as thin as possible.

40|$|We {{propose a}} {{hypothesis}} and a numerical {{model for the}} formation of branching plagioclase textures visible at both macroscopic (∼cm to ∼m) and microscopic scale within melagabbro of the Isle of Rum, Scotland, based on macroscopic, microscopic observations and relevant geological history. The plagioclase crystals are typically linked as twins and form meshes of planar stellate structures (m-scale) with a large range in geometrical organization from patchy to radiating. Evidence of macroscopic crystal aggregation and alignment is attributed to interfacial free energy minimization at the microscopic scale during growth. Accordingly, a binary immiscible Lattice Boltzmann model was developed to simulate diffusion of simplified plagioclase in the melt phase. Isothermal phase transitions modelled via first order chemical reactions are subsequently coupled with stochastic dynamics at the crystal growth front to simulate energy minimization processes including twinning during crystallization in an igneous environment. The solid phase and the liquid phase are coupled with a temporal flexibility that sets the overall ratio between the rate of diffusion and chemical enrichment in the liquid state and the rate of crystallization. The parameter space of the model is explored extensively, followed by a reasonable transcription of physical parameters and an estimation of other parameters to construct realistic simulation scenarios yielding synthetic plagioclase stellates. The results are presented, analyzed and discussed. They appear to be in reasonable qualitative agreement with observations, and several aspects of the natural stellates such as the stellate spacing and long continuous stretches of plagioclase with <b>epitaxial</b> <b>junctions</b> seem to be in reasonable quantitative agreement with observations...|$|R
40|$|Results of first-principles {{calculations}} of the Fe/GaAs/Ag(001) <b>epitaxial</b> tunnel <b>junctions</b> reveal that hybridization of interface resonances formed at both interfaces {{can enhance the}} tunnelling anisotropic magnetoresistance (TAMR) of the systems. This mechanism is manifested by a non-monotonic dependence of the TAMR effect on {{the thickness of the}} tunnel barrier, with a maximum for intermediate thicknesses. A detailed scan of k-resolved transmissions over the two-dimensional Brillouin zone proves an interplay between a few hybridization-induced hot spots and a contribution to the tunnelling from the vicinity of the Gamma-bar point.

Using the short-gate concept [1], the ambipolar {{behavior of the}} TFET is successfully suppressed. The measured TFET performance is not yet beyond that of the MOSFET, most likely due {{to the use of}} silicon that has a large bandgap and the use of ion implantation for the formation of the tunnel junction which results in a low junction abruptness.

If the resonance condition for these hybrid states is met, the electron tunnels through the barrier without attenuation. Even when both hybrid states move together and form a single resonance, strongly enhanced transmission is still observed. The effect explains why, for intermediate barrier thicknesses, the tunneling conductance can be dominated by interface states, although hot spots only occur in a tiny fraction of the surface Brillouin zone...|$|R
40|$|The {{temperature}} dependence of resistance in parallel (P) and antiparallel (AP) configurations (RP,AP) {{has been investigated}} in <b>epitaxial</b> Fe/MgO/Fe <b>junctions</b> with varying MgO barrier thicknesses tMgO.

Possible origins of this {{temperature dependence}} of resistance, which include taking into account a spin independent term and consideration of spin-flip scattering, are discussed.

However, quantitative understanding of bulk-related torque and interface-related torque is still lacking because of their identical symmetry for current-in-plane devices.
