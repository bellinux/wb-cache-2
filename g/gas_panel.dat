40|$|Background. Serum sodium is {{commonly}} measured by di-rect potentiometry (DNa), in blood <b>gas</b> <b>panels,</b> or indirect potentiometry (INa), in metabolic panels run on chemistry analyzers. Abnormal {{values of the}} serum non-water fraction interfere with INa, with low values causing pseudohypernatre-mia (INa>DNa) and high values causing pseudohyponatremia (INa <DNa). Previous attempts to derive a linear correction for the difference between INa and DNa (ΔNa) arising from non-water bias—using serum total protein (TP) or albumin (ALB) to represent the non-water fraction—have yielded inconsistent results, possibly owing to differences in sample inclusion cri-teria, analytic platforms and statistical approach. Methods. We quantified the effects of TP and ALB on ΔNa in 774 critical care patients with closely timed metabolic and <b>gas</b> <b>panels,</b> adjusting for other known effects. Results. ΔNa varied inversely with TP, ALB, and the glucose difference between chemistry and <b>gas</b> <b>panels</b> (ΔGlu), and directly with pH and bicarbonate. The effect of TP on ΔNa was essentially linear, but that of ALB was not; hence, further analysis focused on TP. By multiple linear regression, ΔNa decreased by 0. 64 ± 0. 06 mEq/L for each 1 g/dL increase in TP, adjusted for ΔGlu, pH, and regression to the mean; the TP effect was slightly steeper (0. 69 ± 0. 06 mEq/L), when adjusted for bicarbonate instead of pH. Conclusions. For each 1 g/dL rise or fall in TP, clinicians may find it useful to adjust INa by 0. 7 mEq/L {{in the same direction}} in order to correct INa for non-water bias...|$|R

25|$|The <b>gas</b> <b>panel</b> may {{be fairly}} large and {{mounted on a}} board for {{convenience}} of use, or may be compact and mounted inside a portable box, for ease of transport.

25|$|An {{alternative}} to a low-pressure compressor for gas supply is high-pressure storage cylinders feeding through a pressure regulator which will be set to the required supply pressure for the depth and equipment in use. In practice HP storage {{may be used for}} either reserve gas supply or both main and reserve gas supplies to a <b>gas</b> <b>panel.</b> High-pressure bulk cylinders are quiet in operation and provide gas of known quality (if it has been tested). This allows the relatively simple and reliable use of nitrox mixtures in surface-supplied diving. Bulk cylinders are also quiet in operation compared to a low-pressure compressor, but have the obvious limitation of amount of gas available.|$|E
25|$|The {{control point}} {{is the place where}} the {{supervisor}} can best monitor the status of the diver and progress of the dive. For scuba dives this is commonly on deck of the dive boat where there is {{a good view of the}} surface above the operational area, or on the shore at a nearby point where the divers can be seen when surfaced. For surface supplied diving, the view of the water is usually still necessary, and a view of the line tenders handling the umbilicals is also required, unless there is live video feed from the divers and two-way audio communications with the tenders. The control position also includes the <b>gas</b> <b>panel</b> and communications panel, so the supervisor can remain as fully informed as practicable of the status of the divers and their life support systems during the dive. For bell diving and saturation diving the situation is more complex and the control position may well be inside a compartment where the communications, control and monitoring equipment for the bell and life-support systems are set up.|$|E
500|$|Decompression may be {{shortened}} (or accelerated) by breathing an oxygen-rich [...] "decompression gas" [...] {{such as a}} nitrox blend or pure oxygen. The high {{partial pressure}} of oxygen in such decompression mixes produces the effect known as the oxygen window. This decompression gas is often carried by scuba divers in side-slung cylinders. Cave divers who can only return by a single route, can leave decompression gas cylinders attached to the guideline at the points {{where they will be}} used.

500|$|There {{are several}} types of {{equipment}} used to help divers carry out decompression.

40|$|Nowadays, it is {{increasingly}} common that industries and laboratories work {{with a wide range}} of gas mixtures to run their businesses; due to the high demand existing, there are many companies engaged in manufacturing and supplying the most frequently gas mixtures.

2500|$|A closed diving bell, {{also known}} as {{personnel}} transfer capsule or submersible decompression chamber, is used to transport divers between the workplace and the accommodations chambers.

Bells are usually designed to carry two or three divers, one of whom, the , stays inside the bell {{at the bottom and}} is [...] to the working divers.
