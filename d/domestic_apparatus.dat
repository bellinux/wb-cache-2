Grisell's spirits rose with an undefined hope that, like Sir Gawaine's bride, or her own namesake, Griselda the patient, she should at last win her lord's love; and, deprived as she was of all her own relatives, there arose strongly within her the affection that ten long years ago had made her haunt the footsteps of the boy at Amesbury Manor.|$|E

Only if one worked in a really sweeping and masterly way, and laid on the colour in great washes, it might drip down again on one's face in floods of rich and mingled colour like some strange fairy rain; and that would have its disadvantages. I am afraid it would be necessary to stick to black and white in this form of artistic composition.

60|$|Mr. Vincy's answer {{consisted}} chiefly in {{a demand}} that Lydgate should insure his life--a demand immediately conceded. This was a delightfully reassuring idea supposing that Lydgate died, {{but in the}} mean time not a self-supporting idea. However, it seemed to make everything comfortable about Rosamond's marriage; and the necessary purchases went on with much spirit. Not without prudential considerations, however. A bride (who is going to visit at a baronet's) must have a few first-rate pocket-handkerchiefs; but beyond the absolutely necessary half-dozen, Rosamond contented herself without the very highest style of embroidery and Valenciennes. Lydgate also, finding that his sum of eight hundred pounds had been considerably reduced since {{he had come to}} Middlemarch, restrained his inclination for some plate of an old pattern which was shown to him when he went into Kibble's establishment at Brassing to buy forks and spoons. He was too proud to act as if he presupposed that Mr. Vincy would advance money to provide furniture; and though, since it would not be necessary to pay for everything at once, some bills would be left standing over, he did not waste time in conjecturing how much his father-in-law would give in the form of dowry, to make payment easy. He was {{not going to do anything}} extravagant, but the requisite things must be bought, and it would be bad economy to buy them of a poor quality. All these matters were by the bye. Lydgate foresaw that science and his profession were the objects he should alone pursue enthusiastically; but he could not imagine himself pursuing them in such a home as Wrench had--the doors all open, the oil-cloth worn, the children in soiled pinafores, and lunch lingering in the form of bones, black-handled knives, and willow-pattern. But Wrench had a wretched lymphatic wife who made a mummy of herself indoors in a large shawl; and he must have altogether begun with an ill-chosen <b>domestic</b> <b>apparatus.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract: – The voltage {{fluctuations}} of {{the electrical}} power supply and their effects on both industrial and <b>domestic</b> <b>apparatuses</b> are today a central topic of discussion. The aim {{of this paper is}} the evaluation {{of the effects of the}} low-frequency voltage amplitude modulation on induction motors, with both numerical and experimental analysis. For the numerical analysis different kinds of modulations have been considered, as suggested by the international committees; an experimental analysis has been applied to a three phase, 7. 5 kW induction motor with the adoption of an ad hoc system for the EMC low-frequency immunity testing, with the adoption of rectangular amplitude modulations. The numerical and the experimental results show that a few percent amplitude modulations can involve a critical behavior in terms of torque. As for the light flicker effect measurement, a statistical approach can be adopted for the evaluation of the torque ripple, and a simplified relation can be used to relate the torque ripple to the measurement of the instantaneous voltage waveforms, without direct mechanical measurements.

40|$|This report {{presents}} {{an overview of}} the use of non-ionising radiation in health services and the effects on patients and on public health in general. It points out the controllable problems where (policy-) measures are possible. In health services the use of non-ionising radiation for therapeutic and diagnostic means increases. The controllable problems are in the field of UV-therapy, the use of RF in physiotherapy and ultrasound in prenatal diagnostics. Also in non-medical environments people can be exposed to non-ionising radiation. Protection against overexposure from UV radiation (both solar and from artificial sources) can effectively contribute to a significant reduction of the total dose. Also information and education about the negative effects can lead to adaptation of behaviour and a reduction of skin cancer incidence on the long term. Exposure to laser radiation (e. g. in disco's) can lead to eyedamage. Further research should indicate if surveillance or regulations for the use of these high power lasers are necessary. Technical (PTT) standards for exposure from RF-emitters protect against health hazards. Exposure to RF radiation from hand held telephones (GSM) and theft-prevention equipment can possible interfere with medical implants like pacemakers or insulin pumps. Radio- and tv-broadcasting emitters in the Netherlands do not exceed standards and do not lead to acute health hazards. Exposure to radiation from powerlines in the Netherlands is below the limits, but for certain <b>domestic</b> <b>apparatus</b> they can be exceeded. Specific information can create clarity on the actual exposure and contribute to reducing the concern among people...|$|E
40|$|AIM: Breastlight is a {{new product}} to improve breast health {{awareness}} of women. However, its accuracy in detection of breast lesions (BLs) is unknown. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the Breastlight accuracy in detection of BLs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From July 2011 to September 2013, a total of 500 women referred to mammography unit in Yazd, Iran for screening were recruited to the study. The sensitivity and specificity of Breast light was measured with clinical breast examination (CBE), mammography and sonography. Sonographic and mammography examinations were performed according to breast density among women in two groups of younger (n = 105) and older (n = 395) than 30 years. RESULTS: The results have shown a statistically significant positive correlation between Breastlight, CBE, sonography, and mammography in detection of BLs. Breastlight significantly detected 60. 3 %, 35. 8 %, and 59 % of lesions which were detected by mammography, CBE, and sonography, respectively. Its sensitivity varied significantly with breast density. Comparing the sensitivity of Breastlight among women younger and older than 30 years indicated that the Breastlight had a higher sensitivity for women older than 30 years. The greatest and lowest portion of positive predictive value occurred with CBE (94. 7 %) and mammography (91. 1 %). As well, its greatest and lowest portion of negative predictive value occurred with CBE (65. 6 %) and sonography (29. 7 %). CONCLUSION: The results of this study showed that the efficacy of Breastlight in detection of breast changes as <b>domestic</b> <b>apparatus</b> was appropriate. However, it is recommended further studies to evaluate the Breastlight efficacy and accuracy in detection of the BLs...|$|E

40|$|Examination of {{the process}} of reform in {{domestic}} trade suggests the Vietnamese economic reforms are the result of an essentially political process dating back to the 1970 s. Political change can be explained in terms of the interests and objectives of groups in society interacting with the economic context to produce political action. Also important is the changing cognition of different actors about how their objectives could be given expression in reality. Pressure for change came both from the expression of economic interests and from the sense of people working in areas such as the <b>domestic</b> trade <b>apparatus</b> that they were caught in an impasse in attempting to carry out their day-to-day functions. During the 1980 s, as experiments with modifying the system were tried, the relative importance of different interests changed and ideological positions shifted in response.

40|$|Since {{coming to}} power in 1949, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has {{constructed}} a multi-layered system for censoring unwanted news and stifling opposing viewpoints within China. Over the past two decades, this <b>domestic</b> <b>apparatus</b> has spawned mechanisms that extend information controls to media outlets based outside China. This study provides a survey of this phenomenon, finding {{that over the past}} five years, its nature and scope have intensified and expanded. In many cases, Chinese officials directly impede independent reporting by media based abroad. However, more prevalent [...] and often more effective [...] are methods of control that subtly induce self-censorship or inspire media owners, advertisers, and other international actors to take action on the CCP's behalf.

40|$|Over {{the past}} two decades, the Chinese <b>domestic</b> {{security}} <b>apparatus</b> has expanded dramatically. “Stability maintenance” operations have become a priority for local Chinese authorities. We argue that the birth of these trends dates to the early 1990 s, when central Party authorities adopted new governance models that differed dramatically from those that of the 1980 s. They increased the bureaucratic rank of public security chiefs within the Party apparatus, expanded {{the reach of the}} Party political-legal apparatus into a broader range of governance issues, and altered cadre evaluation standards to increase the sensitivity of local authorities to social protest. We show that the origin of these changes lies in a policy response to the developments of 1989 - 1991, namely the Tiananmen democracy movement and the collapse of Communist political systems in Eastern Europe. Over the past twenty years, these practices have flowered into an extensive stability maintenance apparatus, where local governance is increasingly oriented around the need to respond to social protest, whether through concession or repression. Chinese authorities now appear to be rethinking these developments, but the direction of reform remains unclear...|$|R

40|$|The Australian Federal Police has {{in recent}} years become an {{important}} actor in both the implementation and design of Australian-led state building interventions in Australia's near region of Southeast Asia and the South Pacific. The article focuses on the recent expansion of the Australian Federal Police {{as a way of}} understanding {{the emergence of a new}} partly (and strategically) deterritorialized, 'regional' frontier of the Australian state. Within this new frontier, whose fluctuating outlines the Australian Federal Police not only polices but also to a considerable extent shapes and reshapes, as one of the primary expert agencies on identifying and managing transnational security risks, Australian security is portrayed as contingent on the quality of the domestic governance of neighbouring states, thereby creating linkages between the hitherto <b>domestic</b> governing <b>apparatus</b> of the Australian state and those of other countries. This allows for the rearticulation of the problems affecting intervened states and societies - indeed, their very social and political structures - in the depoliticized terms of the breakdown of 'law and order' and the absence of 'good governance', which not only rationalizes emergency interventions to stabilize volatile situations, but also delegitimizes and potentially criminalizes oppositional politics. The Australian Federal Police, however, does more than merely provide justification for intrusive state transformation projects. Its transnational policing activities open up a field of governance within the apparatus of intervened states that exists in separation from international and domestic law. The constitution of such interventions 'within' the state leaves intact the legal distinction between the domestic and international spheres and therefore circumvents the difficult issue of sovereignty. As a result, police and other executive-administrative actors obtain discretionary ordering powers, without dislodging the sovereign governments of intervened countries...|$|R
40|$|Marianne is Watching" {{presents}} {{a history of}} the institutionalization of professional intelligence and counterintelligence services in France from 1870 to 1914. As the practice of secret politics, once exclusive to the domain of royal authority, gave way to calls for greater transparency in the nineteenth century, the acceptable exercise of state secrecy shifted from leadership to professional surveillance teams. This process, which notably took place during a period of peace, not war, highlights the enduring tension between surveillance, secrecy and national defense within an ostensibly open, democratic society. Interrogating these concerns in the French case, the Third Republic appears as a regime that ultimately valued security over transparency and other freedoms. Led by the army's administration, with contributions from services within the police and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, espionage and counterespionage teams became {{an integral part of the}} French state. They carved out important roles in determining France's international policy, in policing domestic populations, and in regulating speech and expression. What began as a reconnaissance service to achieve military parity with enemies like Germany thus grew to be a professional <b>domestic</b> surveillance <b>apparatus</b> with considerable autonomy in identifying threats to the nation. The embedding of institutions devoted to secrecy had a significant effect on French fin-de-siècle society and culture by contributing to fears of competition, weakness, and decline, as well as popular ideas of citizenship and belonging. The atmosphere created by the perceived presence of foreign spies in turn gave rise to a shared mindset of desperation, paranoia, and yearning for honor and heroism. As understandings of the reality of international espionage changed, views of spies changed, facilitating the popular acceptance of the notion of raison d'état, or the idea that the state has the right to act by whatever means necessary. This study of the origins of bureaucratized intelligence shows the extent to which regimes rely on the perception of real or imagined enemies to justify the establishment of legal and social structures that permit secret state actions, even in the most open society...|$|R
40|$|From {{the initial}} {{emergence}} of Intelligence Studies as a recognised academic {{discipline in the}} 1980 s to the present day, official voices have been preeminent. This {{is especially true of}} counter-espionage. Only a few histories on the evolution of American counter-espionage have developed entirely exogenously from those who have worked within the country’s intelligence community. Unsurprisingly, this has had a rather distorting effect on our understanding of the context and nature of American counter-espionage. This thesis considers how America changed from a nation that partly defined itself at the outset by constricting the state <b>apparatus</b> of <b>domestic</b> spying to creating one of the largest domestic security systems. Meanwhile counterespionage changed from being used only during states of exception, to a state of permanence. In exploring the rise of American counter-espionage, this thesis makes three important claims of three key eras – the Revolutionary, the Gilded and the Progressive. First, it argues that the framers of the United States Constitution endeavoured to counteract the creation of a centralised security service. Second, it argues that this framework for limited counter-espionage, established by the framers, began to unravel following the Homestead Strike in 1892 and the passing of the ‘Anti-Pinkerton Act’. Lastly, it critically assesses the Progressive Era, where the foundation for the modern surveillance state was laid, with the creation of the Bureau of Investigation, the 1917 Espionage Act and a new state interventionist spirit. Along with progressivism, this thesis argues that the other dominant influences on the expansion of American counter-espionage were Britain and the private sector. More broadly, this thesis argues that Intelligence Studies has taken a wrong turn. In seeking to restore the ‘missing dimension’, it has at the same time created a separate field of study that often fails to connect to wider ideas of constitutional history, labour history and civil rights. Therefore, whilst analysing the origins, expansion and influences on America’s <b>domestic</b> security <b>apparatus,</b> the thesis continually connects the use of counterespionage to the political events that initiated its use. I do this so as to provide a critical revisionist account of American counter-espionage that challenges the existing narrative on the rise of spying in America...|$|R
30|$|Although {{homogeneous}} catalysts are advantageous {{in terms}} of fast reaction rates, the drawback of this application is that the reaction products require longer separation and purification times. Use of heterogeneous catalysts can be advantageous in microwave-enhanced transesterification reactions since the catalyst can provide locations for hotspots for rapid heating. In addition, they are recyclable and reusable with acceptable performance. Patil et al. employed heterogeneous catalysts such as BaO, CaO, MgO, and SrO for transesterification of Camelina Sativa oil into biodiesel. They reported the kinetic rate constants for different catalysts. Two orders of magnitude of difference in the kinetic rate constants between the conventional heating method and microwave heating methods was reported in their study [159]. Sol gel type catalysts were also developed and tested by {{the same group of}} researchers. Heterogeneous catalysts also reportedly provide for cleaner products and easier separation of the end products. Variety of heterogeneous catalysts were tested. Few examples include: diphenylammonium salts - DPAMs (mesylates), DPABs (benzenesulfonate), DPATs (tosylate), sulfated zirconia, ZnO/ La 2 O 2 CO 3, TiO 2 /SO 4, heteropolyacids, aluminum oxides with sulfuric acid. whether reactions involving homogeneous or heterogeneous catalysts, when the reaction is carried out under microwaves, transesterification is efficiently activated, with short reaction times, and as a result, a drastic reduction in the quantity of by-products and a short separation time is obtained (> 90 % reduction in separation time), and all with a reduced energy consumption [66, 136]. The rate acceleration in solid-state catalytic reactions, on exposure to microwave radiation, is attributed to high temperatures {{on the surface of the}} catalyst. The increase in the local surface temperature of the catalyst results in enhancement of the catalytic action, leading to an enhanced rate of reaction. It has been observed that when the catalyst is introduced in a solid granular form, the yield and rate of the heterogeneous oxidation, esterification and hydrolysis reactions increases with microwave heating, compared to conventional heating under the same conditions [160]. Solid base catalysts are more efficient than solid-acid catalysts. The advantage with the solid catalysts is that they are not sensitive to the presence of water in the reactants [25]. Breccia et al. reported on the use of a <b>domestic</b> microwave <b>apparatus</b> for the synthesis of biodiesel by reaction between methanol and commercial seed oils [161]. In this work, they found that the reaction was complete in less than 2  min under microwave irradiation. Activities of several catalysts such as sodium methylate, sodium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, sulfuric acid, benzensulfonic acid and boron carbide were also briefly discussed in their study.|$|R
