5|$|According to critics, the {{inherent}} {{problem with this}} approach is that it relied heavily upon an assumption that Michelangelo only painted buon fresco, that he was always satisfied with the result {{at the end of the}} day, and that in <b>four</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>years</b> spent on the ceiling, he stuck exclusively to one approach, and never made small alterations or added details. Arguimbau, on his website, quotes Colalucci, the head of the team, as contradicting himself on this matter.|$|E

She remained there for <b>four</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>years,</b> mostly engaged on the suppression of the slave trade.

She was transferred back to the East Indies after two years on the Cape. Her crew was relieved in 1884 by another sent out from Britain and the ship remained on station until she was sold, less her armament, in Bombay in 1887.|$|E

Lord and an associate were caught and convicted, and Lord was sentenced to <b>four</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>years</b> in prison.|$|E
5|$|Shooting long {{scenes in}} a zero-g {{environment}} was a challenge. Eventually, the team {{decided to use}} computer-generated imagery for the spacewalk scenes and automotive robots to move Bullock's character for interior space station scenes. This meant that shots and blocking had to be planned well in advance for the robots to be programmed. It also made the production period much longer than expected. When the script was finalized, Cuarón assumed it would take about a year to complete the film, but it took <b>four</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>years.</b>|$|E

5|$|Phips and {{the crew}} were rewarded by the investors with medals, and Phips was knighted by James in June. James also rewarded Phips with the post of provost marshal general (chief sheriff) of the Dominion of New England, serving under Sir Edmund Andros. In September 1687 Phips {{returned}} to the wreck, {{though he did not}} command the venture. Admiral Narborough elected to personally lead the expedition, but it was not nearly as successful. The wreck had been discovered by others, and the arrival of the English scattered more than 20 smaller ships. Treasure worth £10,000 was recovered before Narborough's death in May 1688 brought the expedition to an end. Phips had by then already left the wreck site in early May, sailing for Boston for what seems to have been his first time home in <b>four</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>years,</b> to take up his new post as provost marshal general.|$|E
