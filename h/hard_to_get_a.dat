25|$|After a {{few weeks}} Genie became much more {{responsive}} to other people, and shortly afterwards began paying attention to people speaking, but at first she remained mostly unexpressive and {{it was unclear whether}} she responded more to verbal or nonverbal stimuli. Shortly afterwards Genie showed clear responses to nonverbal signals, and her nonverbal communication skills quickly became exceptional. A month into her stay Genie started becoming sociable with familiar adults, first with Kent and soon after with other hospital staff. She was clearly happy when someone she knew visited and sometimes worked very <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> person to stay, expressing disappointment if she failed; for no discernible reason, her greetings were far more energetic than her relatively mild unhappiness when people left. After the state dropped charges against Genie's mother she began visiting Genie twice a week, and {{over the course of a}} few months they steadily grew better at interacting with each other.|$|E
25|$|Social class {{mobility}} {{could be}} low because of housing inequality. People who live or {{were born in}} the housing inequality, they have more problems to solve instead of making money. And what's more, Their children are less likely to get higher education in order to get into higher class in their futures. It could lower the social class mobility to our self and so does our next generation. The major problem of first generation is about earning money for family because of housing inequality. It's <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> loan from bank and lots of bills to pay. They just worry how to survive to tomorrow. But for our children, they deserve a better future, but under housing inequality, they need more time and money to get the same education as who are not suffering from housing inequality. These makes them give up their education easily but {{this is the only way}} they can get into higher class in the future. Not so many of people can make it.|$|E

2500|$|Setting {{up sound}} {{reinforcement}} for live music clubs and dance events often poses unique challenges, {{because there is}} such a large variety of venues which are used as clubs, ranging from former warehouses or music theaters to small restaurants or basement pubs with concrete walls. Dance events may be held in huge warehouses, aircraft hangars or outdoor spaces. In some cases, clubs are housed in multi-story venues with balconies or in [...] "L"-shaped rooms, which makes it <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> consistent sound for all audience members. The solution is to use fill-in speakers to obtain good coverage, using a delay to ensure that the audience does not hear the same sound at different times.|$|E

2500|$|Many of {{the local}} actors and crew were eager to {{participate}} in the project, since the Vancouver winter weather creates a yearly lull in the local acting business.

2500|$|The 79th {{running of}} the Tokyo Yushun took place over 2400 metres on firm ground at Tokyo on 27 May. World Ace headed the betting from Gold Ship with Deep Brillante third choice on 7.5/1.

He's an intelligent horse, and he always runs his heart out in races". After tracking the leaders Iwata sent the colt into third approaching the final turn before taking the lead 200 metres out. In an extremely tight finish Deep Brillante held on to win by a nose from Fenomeno, with Tosen Homareboshi, World Ace, Gold Ship and Cosmo Ozora close behind.

2500|$|Lili's {{official}} {{style is}} street fighting, combined with gymnastic maneuvers such as flips, cartwheels and handstands. Mike Reilly of Game Revolution {{said in his}} 2006 review of Tekken 5: Dark Resurrection that Lili [...] "takes {{a good deal more}} practice to master", an issue he opined was offset by the presence of an in-game training mode. Brett Elston of GamesRadar commented on Lili's fighting style in the game: [...] "She doesn't really have a definable combat style, so it's mostly all flash and sexy high kicks ... her quick movements and wide-reaching legs make her ideal for first-timers—those same dance-like attacks also make it <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> bead on her next move". According to IGN, Lili's counterattacks, juggles and wall fighting in Tekken 6 are known to cause a lot of damage, but she was [...] "lacking in the low attack department and many of her crush attacks will leave her vulnerable." [...] Mike Harradence of PlayStation Universe wrote in 2012 that Lili's [...] "quirky yet ultimately unique style provides ample opportunity for juggles and she can mix it up {{with the best of them}} thanks to an arrange of low-mid attacks." [...] Tom Goulter of GamesRadar said of the character in Tekken Tag Tournament 2: [...] "Lili is one of the series' less fleet-footed characters, with a gymnastic-influenced style that favors precision over quickness." ...|$|E

2500|$|With over 5,000 {{supporters}} {{struggling to}} get through the Plainmoor turnstiles for the match with Crawley, there was a fifteen-minute delay to the kick off to {{what turned out to be}} an ill-tempered Fourth Round tie. [...] Torquay found it <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> foothold in the first half of the game and eventually fell behind in the 39th minute to a Matt Tubbs strike. [...] However, worse was to follow in the second period when Chris Zebroski was sent off in the 61st minute for a second bookable offence after a handball in the six yard box. [...] However, when keeper Scott Bevan managed to save the resulting penalty from Tubbs, the Gulls spirits were raised again until another penalty was awarded to Crawley just minutes later. [...] Astonishingly, Bevan pulled off his second penalty save of the match, this time from Craig McAllister, to give Torquay another lifeline. [...] Unfortunately, they were unable to capitalise on Bevan’s heroics and, despite the sending off of Dean Howell for Crawley in the 83rd minute, the score remained 1-0 until the final whistle. [...] In a match which saw seven bookings in addition to the two dismissals, many Torquay supporters were angered by the tactics employed by Crawley manager Steve Evans (two of Crawley’s yellow cards were for time wasting) and their misery was compounded the following day when Evans’ men were rewarded with a trip to Old Trafford to play Manchester United in the Fifth Round draw.|$|E
