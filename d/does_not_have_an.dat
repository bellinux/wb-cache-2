If maple syrup does not meet the requirements of Processing Grade maple syrup (including a fairly characteristic maple taste), it is classified as Substandard.|$|E

Traffic on SR-202 has increased 12% between 2002 and 2007, with a daily average of 735cars per day using SR-202 in 2007, compared to 475cars per day in 2002. Half of the traffic on SR-202 consists of buses and trucks.|$|E
5|$|Commander Keen is {{the final}} game in the series, {{released}} on May 30, 2001 for the Game Boy Color. Developed by David A.

Id was not a major partner in development, though it retained editorial control over the game, and Adrian Carmack contributed some artwork. The idea for a Game Boy Color Keen game came from John Carmack and id, who approached Activision, which in turn proposed Palmer as the developer.|$|E
5|$|I-97 <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> {{official}} name. However, the Interstate {{is dedicated}} to John A.

The Maryland General Assembly passed a dedication bill in 1998, and the Maryland State Highway Administration (MDSHA) installed a pair of signs noting the dedication in Millersville and near Parole. Like all Interstate Highways, I-97 {{is a part of}} the National Highway System for its entire length. I-97 is the shortest 2-digit mainline Interstate and only intracounty 2-digit Interstate in the contiguous United States.|$|E

5|$|In January 2114, 42 {{years after}} the Citadel events and 12 years into {{rebuilding}} TriOptimum, the company created an experimental FTL starship, the Von Braun, which is now on its maiden voyage. The ship is also followed by a UNN space vessel, the Rickenbacker, which is controlled by Captain William Bedford Diego, son of Edward Diego, the Citadel Station's infamous commander and public hero of the Battle of the Boston Harbor during the Eastern States Police Action. Because the Rickenbacker <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> FTL system of its own, the two ships are attached for the trip. However, Korenchkin was egotistical enough to make himself {{the captain of the}} Von Braun despite being inexperienced.|$|E

He is then drafted into the resistance after failing to disrupt its operations, and unintentionally signals {{the start of the}} resistance's uprising after one of his Antlions accidentally kills a Combine police officer. During the fighting, he accompanies Freeman himself and mingles with resistance members, aids the Combine in the capture of Alyx Vance, one of Freeman's allies, and reunites with Norman Frohman, his long-lost assassin twin brother, only to promptly witness his death {{at the hands of a}} Strider, a large tripodal assault synth.|$|E
5|$|The Cross-Westchester Expressway, {{which is}} {{maintained}} by the New York State Thruway Authority, is six lanes wide and carries I-287 east to a westbound exit for NY119 that is intertwined with the ramps between the New York State Thruway and NY119/Saw Mill River Parkway. After passing over the Saw Mill River Parkway and the Saw Mill River, the road enters the Village of Elmsford and runs through developed areas as it has a partial diamond interchange with NY9A that <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> eastbound exit. The Cross-Westchester Expressway turns southeast from this point and intersects the Sprain Brook Parkway. I-287 widens to eight lanes at this junction and continues to the exit for NY100A.

5|$|The first F-111C, A8-126 {{selected}} for conversion to the RF-111C variant was modified at General Dynamics plant at Fort Worth, Texas between October 1978 and 18 April 1979. After {{four months of}} test flights, the aircraft returned to Australia in August 1979 where it conducted further tropical weather trials at Darwin. The other three aircraft were modified by the RAAF's No. 3 Aircraft Depot at RAAF Base Amberley in 1980, using kits purchased from General Dynamics. The RF-111C variant proved to be highly successful, and {{was considered to be}} among the best tactical reconnaissance aircraft in the world. Three of the four RF-111Cs remained in RAAF service until 2010. The other aircraft was retired in 2006 after suffering damage from landing on its belly after one of its main wheels separated during take off; although the aircraft was repairable it was judged not worthwhile doing so due to the impending retirement of the entire F-111 fleet. The RAAF <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> aircraft with the RF-111C's intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities since they were retired.|$|E
