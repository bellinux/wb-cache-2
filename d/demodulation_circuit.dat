The measurements again may be taken either by a single voltage measurement circuit multiplexed over the electrodes or a separate circuit for each electrode. Earlier EIT systems still used an analog <b>demodulation</b> <b>circuit</b> to convert the alternating voltage to a direct current level before running it through an analog to digital converter. Newer systems convert the alternating signal directly before performing digital demodulation.

A customised four-channel measurement system (50 kHz) {{was used to assess}} bio-impedance changes caused by ankle-joint motion. Two current excitation electrodes were placed below the patella on the shank and on the dorsum of the foot. Voltage detection electrodes were attached to the posterior surface of lower leg below the calf and on the M. tibialis anterior close to its origin. A <b>demodulation</b> <b>circuit</b> determines changes in the absolute value of the BI from the measured and amplified voltage. All circuits are protected against stimulation artefacts so that the recording of BI is possible while muscle stimulation is active. Calibration of the angle measurement was performed by positioning the ankle joint at three known angles. Reference measurements were taken with a marker-based optical system. Dorsiflexion of the unconstrained ankle joint was achieved by stimulation of the M. tibialis anterior. First-order ILC was applied to realise a pre-defined angle profile in a cycle-to-cycle manner.

40|$|Electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD) {{allows us}} to control {{wettability}} of droplets on a solid surface using electrical inputs and {{has been used in}} a wide range of applications including microfluidics, optical displays, lenses, and others. To date, however, they all have been powered in wired connections, limiting their further employments in hard-to-reach area particularly for implantable EWOD devices. One way to deal with the presented issue, a wireless EWOD system is studied and developed. Due to compatibility of EWOD with AC (less than 1 kHz), a wireless powering as prompt method is achieved by a magnetic induction which essentially utilizes AC signal. The wireless powering with droplets actuation is verified in both using spool-type coils and planar coils. In the spool-type wireless EWOD study, the induced voltage at the receiver is much higher (~ 390 V) than typically required EWOD voltages (at least > 50 V), which is sufficient to actuate the droplets. For reliable wireless EWOD actuation, the voltage induction has to be higher than the conventional EWOD while the current does not have to be necessarily high. Since the voltage induction is proportional to the transmission frequency, a higher voltage can be obtained by increasing the transmission frequency. However, if the transmission frequency is too high, the actuation of droplets might be limited. For an efficient EWOD actuation even at such a high transmission frequency, the system might need to be incorporated with an external <b>demodulation</b> <b>circuit.</b> This issue is addressed in the planar wireless EWOD system in which the powering devices and EWOD electrodes are integrated by standard photolithography process. To oscillate droplets while in lateral actuation irrespective of the coil type, amplitude modulation (AM) technique is applied to the wirelessly transmitted signal. Droplet oscillations are often introduced in many applications and beneficial to reduce the contact angle hysteresis. Eventually, by employing the compact wireless EWOD system into particle collecting and mini-boat propulsion, the unnecessary and cumbersome wire connections between the device components are significantly reduced, and more convenient and flexible EWOD operation is achieved with less constraint of the space and equipment...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—A new CMOS {{active mixer}} {{topology}} can operate at low supply voltages {{by the use}} of switches exclusively connected to the supply voltages. Such switches require less voltage headroom and avoid gate-oxide reliability problems. Mixing is achieved by exploiting two transconductors with cross-coupled outputs, which are alternatingly activated by the switches. For ideal switching, the operation is equivalent to a conventional active mixer. This paper analyzes the performance of the switched transconductor mixer, in comparison with the conventional mixer, demonstrating competitive performance at a lower supply voltage. Moreover, the new mixer has a fundamental noise benefit, as noise produced by the switch-transistors and LO-port is common mode noise, which is rejected at the differential output. An experimental prototype with 12 -dB conversion gain was designed and realized in standard 0. 18 - m CMOS to operate at only a 1 -V supply.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} the modification and assessment of a standard multidistance frequency-domain near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) instrument to perform multifrequency frequency-domain NIRS measurements. The first aim of these modifications was to develop an instrument that enables measurement of small volumes of tissue such as the cervix, which {{is too small to}} be measured using a multidistance approach. The second aim was to enhance the spectral resolution to be able to determine the absolute concentrations of oxy-, deoxy- and total hemoglobin, water, and lipids. The third aim was to determine the accuracy and error of measurement of this novel instrument in both in vitro and in vivo environments. The modifications include two frequency synthesizers with variable, freely adjustable frequency, broadband high-frequency amplifiers, the development of a novel avalanche photodiode (APD) detector and <b>demodulation</b> <b>circuit,</b> additional laser diodes with additional wavelengths, and a respective graphic user interface to analyze the measurements. To test the instrument and algorithm, phantoms with optical properties similar to those of biological tissue were measured and analyzed. The results show that the absorption coefficient can be determined with an error of < 10 %. The error of the scattering coefficient was < 31 %. Since the accuracy of the chromophore concentrations depends on the absorption coefficient and not on the scattering coefficient, the < 10 % error is the clinically relevant parameter. In addition, the new APD had similar accuracy as the standard photomultiplier tubes. To determine the accuracy of chromophore concentration measurements we employed liquid Intralipid® phantoms that contained 99 % water, 1 % lipid, and an increasing concentration of hemoglobin in steps of 0. 010 mM. Water concentration was measured with an accuracy of 6. 5 % and hemoglobin concentration with an error of 0. 0024 mM independent of the concentration. The measured lipid concentration was negative, which shows that the current setup is not suitable for measuring lipids. Measurements on the forearm confirmed reasonable values for water and hemoglobin concentrations, but again not for lipids. As an example of a future application, chromophore concentrations in the cervix were measured and comparable values to the forearm were found. In conclusion the modified instrument enables measurement of water concentration in addition to oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin concentrations with a single source-detector distance in small tissue samples. Future work will focus on resolving the lipid component...|$|E
40|$|The cable {{television}} (CATV) networks, since their introduction {{in the late}} 1940 s, have now become {{a crucial part of}} the broadcasting industry. To keep up with growing demands from the subscribers, cable networks nowadays not only provide television programs but also deliver two-way interactive services such as telephone, high-speed Internet and social TV features. A new standard for CATV networks is released every five to six years to satisfy the growing demands from the mass market. From this perspective, this thesis is concerned with three main aspects for the continuing development of cable networks: (i) efficient implementations of backward-compatibility functions from the old standard, (ii) addressing and providing solutions for technically-challenging issues in the current standard and, (iii) looking for prospective features that can be implemented in the future standard. Since 1997, five different versions of the digital CATV standard had been released in North America. A new standard often contains major improvements over the previous one. The latest version of the standard, namely DOCSIS 3. 1 (released in late 2013), is packed with state-of-the-art technologies and allows approximately ten times the amount of traffic as compared to the previous standard, DOCSIS 3. 0 (released in 2008). Backward-compatibility is a must-have function for cable networks. In particular, to facilitate the system migration from older standards to a newer one, the backward compatible functions in the old standards must remain in the newer-standard products. More importantly, to keep the implementation cost low, the inherited backward compatible functions must be redesigned by taking advantage of the latest technology and algorithms. To improve the backward-compatibility functions, the first contribution of the thesis focuses on redesigning the pulse shaping filter by exploiting infinite impulse response (IIR) filter structures {{as an alternative to the}} conventional finite impulse response (FIR) structures. Comprehensive comparisons show that more economical filters with better performance can be obtained by the proposed design algorithm, which considers a hybrid parameterization of the filter's transfer function in combination with a constraint on the pole radius to be less than 1. The second contribution of the thesis is a new fractional timing estimation algorithm based on peak detection by log-domain interpolation. When compared with the commonly-used timing detection method, which is based on parabolic interpolation, the proposed algorithm yields more accurate estimation with a comparable implementation cost. The third contribution of the thesis is a technique to estimate the multipath channel for DOCSIS 3. 1 cable networks. DOCSIS 3. 1 is markedly different from prior generations of CATV networks in that OFDM/OFDMA is employed to create a spectrally-efficient signal. In order to effectively demodulate such a signal, it is necessary to employ a <b>demodulation</b> <b>circuit</b> which involves estimation and tracking of the multipath channel. The estimation and tracking must be highly accurate because extremely dense constellations such as 4096 -QAM and possibly 16384 -QAM can be used in DOCSIS 3. 1. The conventional OFDM channel estimators available in the literature either do not perform satisfactorily or are not suitable for the DOCSIS 3. 1 channel. The novel channel estimation technique proposed in this thesis iteratively searches for parameters of the channel paths. The proposed technique not only substantially enhances the channel estimation accuracy, but also can, at no cost, accurately identify the delay of each echo in the system. The echo delay information is valuable for proactive maintenance of the network. The fourth contribution of this thesis is a novel scheme that allows OFDM transmission without the use of a cyclic prefix (CP). The structure of OFDM in the current DOCSIS 3. 1 does not achieve the maximum throughput if the channel has multipath components. The multipath channel causes inter-symbol-interference (ISI), which is commonly mitigated by employing CP. The CP acts as a guard interval that, while successfully protecting the signal from ISI, reduces the transmission throughput. The problem becomes more severe for downstream direction, where the throughput of the entire system is determined by the user with the worst channel. To solve the problem, this thesis proposes major alterations to the current DOCSIS 3. 1 OFDM/OFDMA structure. The alterations involve using a pair of Nyquist filters at the transceivers and an efficient time-domain equalizer (TEQ) at the receiver to reduce ISI down to a negligible level without the need of CP. Simulation results demonstrate that, by incorporating the proposed alterations to the DOCSIS 3. 1 down-link channel, the system can achieve the maximum throughput over a wide range of multipath channel conditions...|$|E

40|$|Non-destructive {{testing is}} an {{important}} field of research {{in many areas of}} industry and science. This field covers methods that test some property of an object while not impacting its future usefulness. This project is specifically interested in a method of NDE called Laser Doppler Vibrometry (LDV), which uses light to probe the motion of an object's surface. This thesis presents research into the possibility of developing a full-field LDV camera capable of measuring the vibration at a number of points across an object simultaneously. The approach chosen was to develop a single processing element which contained a light detector as well as the processing required to produce an output signal proportional to the vibration of the surface imaged by the element. This processing element, or pixel, could then be used to produce a full-field LDV camera capable of imaging an object's surface to provide vibration amplitude and frequency for a number of points across the whole surface simultaneously Some early work was carried out measuring the vibration of a piezoelectric target with a CMOS camera and the results were compared with theory. The method of processing chosen is called zero-crossing <b>demodulation</b> and a <b>circuit</b> was designed and simulated using this method. This circuit was then laid-out and a CMOS chip was fabricated with the pixel on it. The circuit was designed such that the different parts of it could be tested separately using electrical signals, and a number of electrical tests were performed to check how well the operation of the fabricated pixel compared with simulation. Using a laser interferometer the pixel was finally tested with real vibrating objects and compared with a commercial LDV...|$|R
