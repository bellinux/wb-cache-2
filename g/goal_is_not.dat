5|$|In Tokyo, after Kaoru learns about Yukishiro Enishi's {{plans to}} kill {{everyone}} connected to Kenshin she teaches Yahiko the ougi of the Kamiya Kasshin. Enishi {{says that his}} <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> to kill Kenshin, but to make him suffer by killing the person most important to him: Kaoru. He kidnaps her, leaving a replica of her dead body. Convinced that he again failed to save {{the one who was}} most important to him, Kenshin flees to the Fallen Village and falls into a catatonic depression. When he learns that Kaoru is alive, he and the group rescue her from Enishi. They marry and have a son, Himura Kenji.|$|E

25|$|Unlike other deep architectures, such as DBNs, the <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> to {{discover}} the transformed feature representation. The structure of the hierarchy {{of this kind of}} architecture makes parallel learning straightforward, as a batch-mode optimization problem. In purely discriminative tasks, DSNs perform better than conventional DBNs.|$|E
25|$|In food production, the <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> {{to simply}} change the {{configuration}} of double bonds while maintaining the same ratios of hydrogen to carbon. Instead, {{the goal is to}} decrease the number of double bonds and increase the amount of hydrogen in the fatty acid. This changes the consistency of the fatty acid and makes it less prone to rancidity (in which free radicals attack double bonds). Production of trans fatty acids is therefore an undesirable side effect of partial hydrogenation.|$|E

50|$|Generative {{economy is}} arguably a better {{approach}} to the outdated extractive economy, but the transition to such a model must attempt to anticipate the difficulty in transforming participants behavior, such that living <b>goals</b> <b>are</b> prioritized and financial <b>goals</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> prioritized. It may be possible, albeit unlikely, that living and financial <b>goals</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> conflicting in the long-run {{for the majority of}} Earth's human population.|$|R
25|$|DNA barcoding is a taxonomic {{method that}} uses a short genetic marker in an organism's DNA to {{identify}} it as belonging to a particular species. It differs from molecular phylogeny in that the main <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> to determine patterns of relationship but to identify an unknown sample {{in terms of a}} preexisting classification. Although barcodes are sometimes used in an effort to identify unknown species or assess whether species should be combined or separated, These provide poor resolution for land plants, and a call was made for regions to be assessed that could complement rbcL and matK.|$|E
25|$|The easiest fusion {{reaction}} to achieve {{is found in}} a 50–50 mixture of tritium and deuterium. For fusion power experiments this mixture must be held at high temperatures for relatively lengthy times {{in order to have}} an efficient reaction. For explosive use, however, the <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> to produce efficient fusion, but simply provide extra neutrons early in the process. Since a nuclear explosion is supercritical, any extra neutrons will be multiplied by the chain reaction, so even tiny quantities introduced early can have a large effect on the final outcome. For this reason, even the relatively low compression pressures and times (in fusion terms) found {{in the center of a}} hollow pit warhead are enough to create the desired effect.|$|E
25|$|A behind, worth 1 point, is scored {{when the}} ball passes between a goal post and a behind post at any height, or if the ball hits a goal post, or if any player sends the ball between the goal posts by {{touching}} it with {{any part of the}} body other than a foot. A behind is also awarded to the attacking team if the ball touches any part of an opposition player, including his foot, before passing between the goal posts. When an opposition player deliberately scores a behind for the attacking team (generally as a last resort to ensure that a <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> scored) this is termed a rushed behind. As of the 2009 AFL season, a free kick is awarded against any player who deliberately rushes a behind.|$|E

25|$|Justice Anthony Kennedy did {{not join}} {{the rest of the}} opinion by the Chief Justice, therefore, those parts of the opinion did not command a majority. In this Plurality Opinion, Roberts wrote that the Schools at issue contend that a racially diverse {{environment}} is beneficial for education and they submit this as the reason why they consider race alone in their school assignments. However, Roberts considers that this interest is not compelling and that the use of race for this <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> narrowly tailored, it is instead used for racial balancing, which is unconstitutional. The schools base their numbers in demographics, therefore making this goal a means to achieve a numerical quota to achieve racial balancing. Roberts concludes that racial balancing cannot be a compelling state interest.|$|E
25|$|In the {{earliest}} texts of Mahayana Buddhism, {{the path of}} a bodhisattva was to awaken the bodhicitta. Between the 1st and 3rd century CE, this tradition introduced the Ten Bhumi doctrine, which means ten levels or stages of awakening. This development was followed by the acceptance {{that it is impossible to}} achieve Buddhahood in one (current) lifetime, and the best <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> nirvana for oneself, but Buddhahood after climbing through the ten levels during multiple rebirths. Mahayana scholars then outlined an elaborate path, for monks and laypeople, and the path includes the vow to help teach Buddhist knowledge to other beings, so as to help them cross samsara and liberate themselves, once one reaches the Buddhahood in a future rebirth. One part of this path are the Pāramitā (perfections, to cross over), derived from the Jatakas tales of Buddha's numerous rebirths.|$|E
25|$|The {{uprising}} {{began in}} early morning of June 22, 1941, {{the first day}} of the war. The main forces of the LAF were concentrated in Kaunas. At 10am LAF held a meeting in Žaliakalnis, dividing the responsibilities. It was decided that the main <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> to fight with the Russians, but to secure the city from inside (secure organizations, institutions, enterprises) and declare independence. By the evening of June 22, the Lithuanians controlled the Presidential Palace, post office, telephone and telegraph, radio station and radiophone. Control of the telephone allowed Lithuanians to disconnect all known communist numbers and talk to each other without passwords or codes. The radio station was sabotaged by the Russians, therefore repair works were carried out during the night from June 22 to 23. Spare parts were delivered by medical students, driving an ambulance. Despite fears of inadequate Lithuanian forces guarding the radio, in the morning of June 23, Leonas Prapuolenis read the declaration of Lithuanian independence and the list of members of the Provisional Government. The broadcast was repeated several times in Lithuanian, German, and French.|$|E

500|$|Because {{children}} with tics often present to physicians when their tics are most severe, {{and because of}} the waxing and waning nature of tics, it is recommended that medication not be started immediately or changed often. Frequently, the tics subside with explanation, reassurance, understanding of the condition and a supportive environment. When medication is used, the <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> to eliminate symptoms: [...] it should be used at the lowest possible dose that manages symptoms without adverse effects, given that these may be more disturbing than the symptoms for which they were prescribed.|$|E
500|$|The game's playable character, William [...] "B.J." [...] Blazkowicz, {{has been}} {{previously}} featured as the playable protagonist of all Wolfenstein games. When developing the character of Blazkowicz for The New Order, MachineGames considered his appearances in previous games in the series. When doing this, they realised that the character had never really developed at all throughout the games; [...] "He's just the guy that you play," [...] said Pete Hines, Vice President of PR and Marketing for Bethesda. The team discovered that {{they were interested in}} exploring his story, which is what they later invested in. One particular scenario that the team envisioned is putting Blazkowicz in situations where he is uncomfortable. Matthies said, [...] "that's really interesting to me. I love taking things and making them real." [...] Throughout the game, Blazkowicz communicates some of his inner thoughts through short monologues, many of which reveal that he has been traumatized by some of his experiences. [...] "We always loved the idea of a prototypical action hero exterior juxtaposed with a rich and vulnerable interior psychology," [...] said Matthies. One of the largest priorities for the team when developing the character of Blazkowicz was to [...] "reveal whatever needs to be revealed to [...] and the player" [...] simultaneously; Matthies felt that, despite the simplicity of this concept, it is rarely used in games. Prior to developing The New Order, the team had primarily worked on games that involved antihero protagonists. However, id Software wished Blazkowicz to be portrayed differently in the game. Matthies said, [...] "It's really important to [...] that BJ is a hero, and not an anti-hero." [...] The team attempted to develop Blazkowicz into a character that players could relate to, as they felt that players are generally unable to relate to video game protagonists. [...] "The <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> to have a protagonist that's so neutral that you can project yourself into them; the goal is to have a protagonist that is so relatable that you become them," [...] said Matthies. They also tried to make players become [...] "emotionally in sync" [...] with Blazkowicz, using the morality choice in the game's prologue to do so.|$|E

2500|$|Education in Scouting is individual, {{because every}} Scout, {{no matter what}} their capabilities, must be {{inspired}} to learn.

2500|$|Certain {{exceptions}} to the ban on alcohol apply. Alcohol derived from a source other than the grape (or its byproducts) and the date is allowed in [...] "very small quantities" [...] (loosely defined as a quantity that does not cause intoxication) under the Sunni Hanafi madhab, for specific purposes (such as medicines), where the <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> intoxication. However, modern Hanafi scholars regard alcohol consumption as totally forbidden.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "DaCapo" [...] project, {{funded by}} the German Federal Ministry of Health, began at the DZB in 2003 to produce {{specialty}} sheet music for the blind.
