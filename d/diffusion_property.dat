We present {{a study on the}} <b>diffusion</b> <b>property</b> of iterated vectorial Boolean functions. The measure that will be of main interest here is the notion of the de-gree of completeness, which has been suggested by the NESSIE project. We provide the first (to the best of our knowledge) two constructions of (n, n) -functions having perfect <b>diffusion</b> <b>property</b> and optimal alge-braic degree. We also obtain the complete enumeration results for the constructed functions...|$|E
40|$|We study time {{evolution}} of critical fluctuations of conserved charges near the QCD critical {{point in the}} context of relativistic heavy ion collisions. A stochastic diffusion equation is employed in order to describe the <b>diffusion</b> <b>property</b> of the critical fluctuation arising from the coupling of the order parameter field to conserved charges. We show that the <b>diffusion</b> <b>property</b> gives rise to a possibility of probing the early time fluctuations through the rapidity window dependence of the second-order cumulant and correlation function of conserved charges. It is pointed out that their non-monotonic behaviors as functions of the rapidity interval are robust experimental signals for the existence of the critical enhancement around the QCD critical point.

40|$|International audienceA good linear {{diffusion}} {{layer is}} a prerequisite {{in the design of}} block ciphers. Usually it is obtained by combining matrices with optimal <b>diffusion</b> <b>property</b> over the Sbox alphabet. These matrices are constructed either directly using some algebraic properties or by enumerating a search space, testing the optimal <b>diffusion</b> <b>property</b> for every element. For implementation purposes, two types of structures are considered: Structures where all the rows derive from the first row and recursive structures built from powers of companion matrices. In this paper, we propose a direct construction for new recursive-like MDS matrices. We show they are quasi-involutory {{in the sense that the}} matrix-vector product with the matrix or with its inverse can be implemented by clocking a same LFSR-like architecture. As a direct construction, performances do not outperform the best constructions found with exhaustive search. However, as a new type of construction, it offers alternatives for MDS matrices design...|$|E
40|$|Using {{molecular}} dynamics method, we investigate the <b>diffusion</b> <b>property</b> of lithium in different silicon structures and silicon structure's disorder extent during lithium's diffusion process. We {{find that the}} pathway and the incident angle between the direction of barrier and diffusion of lithium are also the essential factors to the lithium's <b>diffusion</b> <b>property</b> in silicon anode besides the barrier. Smaller incident angle could decrease the scattering of lithium in silicon structure effectively. Moreover, lithium diffuses easier in the Li-Si alloy structure of higher lithium concentration with deeper injection depth. The silicon's structure will be damaged gradually during the charge and discharge process. However, it will also recover to initial state {{to a great extent}} after relaxation. Therefore, the damage of lithium diffusion to silicon anode in the structure of low lithium concentration is reversible to a great degree. In addition, the silicon structure of crystal orientation perform better properties in both lithium's diffusivity and structural stability...|$|E

40|$|International audiencePropagation of an ultrashort {{laser pulse}} through a {{scattering}} medium forms a speckle {{pattern in the}} spatio-spectral domain.
