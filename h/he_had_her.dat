5|$|As in Africa, dynastic {{struggles in}} Ostrogothic Italy {{provided}} an opportunity for intervention. The young king Athalaric had died on 2 October 534, and a usurper, Theodahad, had imprisoned queen Amalasuntha, Theodoric's daughter and mother of Athalaric, {{on the island of}} Martana in Lake Bolsena, where <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>her</b> assassinated in 535. Thereupon Belisarius with 7,500 men invaded Sicily (535) and advanced into Italy, sacking Naples and capturing Rome on 9 December 536. By that time Theodahad had been deposed by the Ostrogothic army, who had elected Vitigis as their new king. He gathered a large army and besieged Rome from February 537 to March 538 without being able to retake the city.|$|E
5|$|Catelyn {{arrives in}} King's Landing, {{supposedly}} in secret. However, she is {{taken by a}} pair of city watchmen to a brothel owned by Littlefinger. He meets her to tell her that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>her</b> brought there to keep her safe and hidden. Varys, also present, reveals that he learned of Catelyn's arrival through his spies. The three of them and Ser Rodrik discuss the attempted murder of Bran. Littlefinger shocks them all by admitting that the assassin's dagger was once his own. He claims that he lost it to Tyrion Lannister, betting on Jaime Lannister to win a previous tourney. Littlefinger arranges a meeting between Eddard and Catelyn, and Eddard reluctantly takes on Littlefinger as an ally who will help them find Bran's assailant.|$|E
5|$|Production {{started in}} October 1953, {{but had to}} be halted within weeks when Masina dislocated her ankle during the convent scene with Quinn. With {{shooting}} suspended, De Laurentiis saw an opportunity to replace Masina, whom he had never wanted for the part and {{who had not yet}} been signed to a contract. This changed as soon as executives at Paramount viewed the rushes of the scene and lauded Masina's performance, resulting in De Laurentiis announcing that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>her</b> on an exclusive and ordering her to sign a hastily prepared contract, at approximately a third of Quinn's salary.|$|E

5|$|The end {{came first}} for Virginia. Because the {{blockade}} was unbroken, Norfolk was of little strategic {{use to the}} Confederacy, and preliminary plans were laid to move the ship up the James River to the vicinity of Richmond. Before adequate preparations could be made, the Confederate Army under Major General Benjamin Huger abandoned the city on May 9, without consulting anyone from the Navy. Virginias draft was too great to permit her to pass up the river, which had a depth of only , and then only under favorable circumstances. She was trapped and could only be captured or sunk by the Union Navy. Rather than allow either, Tatnall decided to destroy his own ship. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>her</b> towed down to Craney Island in Portsmouth, where the gang were taken ashore, {{and then she was}} set afire. She burned {{through the rest of the}} day and most of the following night; shortly before dawn, the flames reached her magazine, and she blew up.|$|E
25|$|February – Apostle Lee gave {{a lengthy}} anecdote {{about a woman}} in love with another woman stating that the ugly {{practice}} and unpardonable sin of homosexuality is more common than we realize. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>her</b> promise to never return to homosexuality and pray to become a normal, natural woman.|$|E
25|$|Sometimes {{cited as}} a {{possible}} inspiration of Saint Catherine, comes from the writer, Eusebius, who wrote around the year 320, that the Emperor had ordered a young Christian woman {{to come to his}} palace to become his mistress, and when she refused <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>her</b> punished, by having her banished and her estates confiscated. Although Eusebius did not name the woman, she had been identified with Dorothea of Alexandria.|$|E

25|$|When Theseus {{abandoned}} Ariadne {{sleeping on}} Naxos, Dionysus found and married her. She bore him a son named Oenopion, but {{he committed suicide}} or was killed by Perseus. In some variants, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>her</b> crown put into the heavens as the constellation Corona; in others, he descended into Hades to restore her to the gods on Olympus. Another different account claims Dionysus ordered Theseus to abandon Ariadne {{on the island of}} Naxos for he had seen her as Theseus carried her onto the ship and had decided to marry her.|$|E
25|$|By 1871, Whistler {{returned}} to portraits and soon produced {{his most famous}} painting, the nearly monochromatic full-length figure entitled Arrangement in Grey and Black No.1, but usually (and incorrectly) referred to as Whistler's Mother. A model failed to appear one day, according to a letter from his mother, so Whistler turned {{to his mother and}} suggested that he do her portrait. In his typically slow and experimental way, at first <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>her</b> stand, but that proved too tiring so the famous seated pose was adopted. It took dozens of sittings to complete.|$|E

25|$|Later {{on during}} the march, Muhammad's wife Aisha was rumoured to have {{committed}} adultery and Ibn Ubay was among those spreading the rumour. One of the chiefs of the Aws asked for the permission to punish the slanderers (without incurring a feud), but the Khazraj opposed this. After Muhammad had {{announced that he had}} received a revelation confirming Aisha's innocence, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>her</b> three of her accusers, who had come forward, punished by eighty lashes.

25|$|During the Battle of Xiapi in late 198, {{when the}} allied forces of Cao Cao and Liu Bei fought against Lü Bu, Guan Yu made a request to Cao Cao, asking to marry Qin Yilu's wife Lady Du (杜氏) after they had {{achieved}} victory. Cao Cao agreed, and Guan Yu repeatedly reminded Cao Cao about his promise before the battle was won. After Lü Bu's defeat and death, Cao Cao was curious about why Guan Yu wanted Lady Du so badly and he guessed that she must be very beautiful, so <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>her</b> brought to him. Cao Cao broke his promise to Guan Yu, as he took Lady Du as his concubine and adopted her son Qin Lang (whom she had with Qin Yilu).|$|E

25|$|Laumer's books do not portray one {{consistent}} {{version of}} Oz. Because {{most of his}} books were collaborations, he often included elements of other author's visions of Oz {{which may have been}} inconsistent with his own. For example, while he explicitly made Dorothy sixteen in A Fairy Queen in Oz, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>her</b> physically eight in Aunt Em and Uncle Henry in Oz; and while he portrayed Volkov's Oz as a parallel universe in Farewell to Oz he also showed Volkov's characters living in Baum's Oz in many of his other books, such as Aunt Em and Uncle Henry in Oz. Despite these discrepancies, many of his books are consistent with each other, and characters introduced in some often appear in others.|$|E
25|$|When {{the prince}} became Amir in 1919 and {{subsequently}} King in 1926, the queen {{had an important}} role in the evolution of the Country and was always close to her husband. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>her</b> take part in all national events. He was said, ”I am your king, but the Minister of Education is my wife—your Queen”. Queen Soraya was the first Muslim consort who appeared in public together with her husband, something which was unheard of at the time. She participated with him in the hunting parties, riding on horseback, and in some Cabinet meetings. She was present at military parades with the king. During the war of Independence, she visited the tents of wounded soldiers, talked to them, offered them presents and comfort. She accompanied the king even in some rebellious provinces of the country, something which was a very dangerous thing to do at that time.|$|E
25|$|Consort Yang {{became so}} favored that {{whenever}} she rode a horse, the eunuch Gao Lishi would attend her. 700 laborers were conscripted to sew fabrics for her. Officials and generals flattered her by offering her exquisite tributes. In 746, she angered Emperor Xuanzong by being jealous and rude to him, and <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>her</b> sent to her cousin Yang Xian's mansion. Later that day, however, his mood {{was such that}} he could not eat, and he battered his servants for minor offenses. Gao knew that he missed Consort Yang, and requested that the treasures in Consort Yang's palace be sent to her. Emperor Xuanzong agreed, and sent imperial meals to her as well. That night, Gao requested that Emperor Xuanzong welcome Consort Yang back to the palace, a request that Emperor Xuanzong easily agreed to. Thereafter, she was even more favored, and no other imperial consort drew his favor.|$|E

Seeking revenge, the {{stranger}} found Clementine on his walkie-talkie and manipulated her into keeping tabs on the group under the guise that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>her</b> parents and had been following them ever since. Realizing that the man is insane, Lee, with Clementine's help, kills him. As Lee and Clementine leave the hotel, Clementine spots her parents, both of whom have turned into walkers, and Lee falls unconscious. Awakening soon after, he realizes he is near conversion, and instructs her to escape the city and meet Omid and Christa at the edge of town. The player can choose to have Lee order Clementine to either kill him or leave him to become a walker, or can opt to do nothing, in which case Clementine will choose based on the culmination of the player's choices within the game.|$|E
