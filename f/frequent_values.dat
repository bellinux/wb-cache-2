5000|$|Galton is {{regarded}} as the founder of psychometry. He studied the work of his older half-cousin Charles Darwin about biological evolution. Hypothesizing that eminence is inherited from ancestors, Galton did a study of families of eminent people in Britain, publishing it in 1869 as Hereditary Genius. Galton's ideas were elaborated from the work of two early 19th-century pioneers in statistics: Carl Friedrich Gauss and Adolphe Quetelet. Gauss discovered the normal distribution (bell-shaped curve): given a large number of measurements of the same variable under the same conditions, they vary at random from a most frequent value, the [...] "average", to two least <b>frequent</b> <b>values</b> at maximum differences greater and lower than the most frequent value. Quetelet discovered that the bell-shaped curve applied to social statistics gathered by the French government in the course of its normal processes on large numbers of people passing through the courts and the military. His initial work in criminology led him to observe [...] "the greater the number of individuals observed the more do peculiarities become effaced...". This ideal from which the peculiarities were effaced became [...] "the average man".|$|E

In this paper we demonstrate how this <b>frequent</b> <b>value</b> phenomenon can be exploited in designing a cache that trades off performance with energy efficiency. We propose the design of the <b>Frequent</b> <b>Value</b> Cache (FVC) in which storing a <b>frequent</b> <b>value</b> requires few bits as they are stored in encoded form while all other values are stored in unencoded form using 32 bits. The data array is partitioned into two arrays such that if a <b>frequent</b> <b>value</b> is accessed only the first data array is accessed; otherwise an additional cycle is needed to access the second data array. Experiments with some of the SPEC 95 benchmarks show that on an average a 64 Kb/ 64 -value FVC provides 28. 8 % reduction in L 1 cache energy and 3. 38 % increase in execution time delay over a conventional 64 Kb cache...|$|R

40|$|The need in {{low power}} {{processor}} design is growing {{due to the}} reliability problem for high frequency, high temperature processor chips and the expanding market for battery powered mobile devices. The memory hierarchy is a known source of significant power consumption. This dissertation develops low power techniques for two parts in the memory hierarchy, namely the data cache and the off-chip data bus. The proposed techniques are based on new observations of the memory residing <b>frequent</b> <b>values.</b> The study on memory values shows that a small set of <b>frequent</b> <b>values</b> occupy a substantial fraction of memory spaces allocated to an executing program. Those values remain fairly stable over a program run. Moreover, the <b>frequent</b> <b>values</b> are distributed in the memory quite uniformly and periodically. Techniques in identifying the set of <b>frequent</b> <b>values</b> through software method and hardware methods are developed. Those techniques are adopted in the low power applications for the data cache and data bus. A conventional data cache is redesigned into frequent value cache (FVC) so that power consumption is reduced for every access of <b>frequent</b> <b>values.</b> However, this comes with a cost of extra cycles for nonfrequent value accesses. To overcome the loss in speed, a load marking technique is developed so that for {{a substantial number of}} nonfrequent value accesses there is no degradation in speed. Experimental results of the FVC design show an energy reduction of 28. 8 % in L 1 data cache is achieved. On the off-chip data bus, an FV encoding technique is developed exploring <b>frequent</b> <b>values.</b> The encoding scheme reduces the total bus switching by using "one-hot" codes for <b>frequent</b> <b>values.</b> Variations of the FV encoding technique are also designed to achieve maximum switching reduction across different configurations and different benchmarks. The FV encoding technique can reduce the total number of bus switching counts 1. 5 to 4 times more than that is achieved by other data bus encoding schemes. In addition to the frequent value based cache design, a cache access limiting mechanism is developed to achieve low power from a different angle. A subset of cache accesses is removed by reusing their results in history. The reuse hardware is fine tuned to keep the overhead minimum while achieving low power in the data cache. The reuse hardware for the data cache can achieve 11 % net cache energy saving...|$|E

40|$|Since {{the energy}} {{consumed}} by I/O pins of a CPU {{is a significant}} source of energy consumption, work has been done on developing encoding schemes for reducing switching activity on external buses. Modest reductions in switching can be achieved for data and address busses using a number of general encoding schemes. However, by exploiting the characteristic of memory reference locality, switching activity at address bus can be reduced by as much as 66 % [3]. Till now no characteristic has been identied {{that can be used to}} achieve similar reductions in switching activity on the data bus. We have discovered a characteristic of values transmitted over the data bus according to which a small number of distinct values, called <b>frequent</b> <b>values,</b> account for 5868 % of transmissions over the external data bus. Exploiting this characteritic we have developed an encoding scheme that we call the FV (frequent value) encoding scheme. To implement this scheme we have also developed a technique for dynamically identifying the <b>frequent</b> <b>values.</b> Our experiments show that FV encoding of 32 <b>frequent</b> <b>values</b> yields an average reduction of 42. 7 % (with on-chip data cache) and 67. 63 % (without on-chip data cache) in data bus switching activity for SPEC 95 benchmarks.

The sample included 13. 939 rallies, including attack (n= 7. 090), block (n= 7. 090), and serve reception (n= 5. 161). Descriptive statistics were applied in order to obtain frequencies and percentages. Inferential statistics were calculated (p<. 05) through chi square tests.

40|$|Abstract — The {{proliferation}} of Chip Multiprocessors (CMPs) {{has led to}} the integration of large on-chip caches. For scalability reasons, a large on-chip cache is often divided into smaller banks that are interconnected through packet-based Network-on-Chip (NoC). With increasing number of cores and cache banks integrated on a single die, the on-chip network introduces significant communication latency and power consumption. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme that exploits <b>Frequent</b> <b>Value</b> compression to optimize the power and performance of NoC. Our experimental results show that the proposed scheme reduces the router power by up to 16. 7 %, with CPI reduction as much as 23. 5 % in our setting.

40|$|Reducing {{the power}} {{consumption}} of computing devices {{has gained a}} lot of attention recently. Many research works have focused on reducing power consumption in the off-chip buses as they consume a significant amount of total power. Since the bus power consumption is proportional to the switching activity, reducing the bus switching is an effective way to reduce bus power. While numerous techniques exist for reducing bus power in address buses, only a handful of techniques have been proposed for data-bus power reduction, where <b>frequent</b> <b>value</b> encoding (FVE) is the best existing scheme to reduce the transition activity on the data buses. In this article, we propose improved <b>frequent</b> <b>value</b> data bus-encoding techniques aimed at reducing more switching activity and, hence, power consumption. We propose three new schemes and five new variations to exploit bit-wise temporal and spatial locality in the data-bus values. Our techniques just use one external control signal and capture bit-wise locality to efficiently encode data values. For all the embedded and SPEC applications we tested, the overall average switching reduction is 53 % over unencoded data and 10 % more than the conventional FVE scheme...|$|R

Value locality [1] describes the recurrence of a previously seen value within a storage location.
