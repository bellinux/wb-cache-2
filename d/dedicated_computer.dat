25|$|The first {{computer}} on campus {{was installed in}} Dearborn Observatory in 1949 and in 1950 a <b>dedicated</b> <b>Computer</b> Center opened featuring an IBM 650 mainframe computer. A $2 million IBM 709 was installed in July 1961 in the Technological Institute for computing satellite orbits among other problems. The Vogelback Computing Center was the first building to open on the Lakefill campus in October 1964. Starting in 1970, Northwestern's Chess program won eight of the first ten North American Computer Chess Championships.|$|E

25|$|The Newington College Preparatory School was {{established}} initially at Killara (1957) and later at Lindfield (1967), {{in response to}} requests from Old Newingtonians that a preparatory school be established on the North Shore of Sydney. The Head of Newington College, Lindfield, is Mr Ben Barrington-Higgs. It is a single-stream school, with approximately 160 students from Kindergarten to Year 6 and {{is set in a}} bushland location where the Students are constantly in touch with nature. The school features a basketball/tennis court, climbing gym areas, swimming pool and connects to the bush trails of Swain Gardens. Each classroom includes effective information communication technology tools. Classrooms have <b>dedicated</b> <b>computer</b> and wet areas, and bag storage areas. There are special facilities for music, art and French. A tuckshop operates three days a week. The campus has just undergone a major redevelopment of classrooms and the addition of a new hall, library and visual arts room. Students in Years 3–6 compete in the Independent Primary School Heads of Australia (IPSHA) Competition held on Saturday mornings. Every student competes in a summer (basketball or cricket) or winter sport (rugby or soccer). Newington's preparatory schools combine for annual carnivals in swimming, athletics and cross country.|$|E

Almost all indoor sports are catered for, including Swimming and the Tyn-Y-Waen Climbing Wall – which was opened by climber Ben Moon in June 2005. The school has buildings, known as [...] "blocks" [...] for subject groups, and a separate Sixth Form Centre. There are a number of <b>dedicated</b> <b>computer</b> rooms, a staffed library, a Connexions career room, and all classrooms are equipped with Interactive whiteboards. The school also has a modern fitness suite as well as a new building with changing rooms and a sports Pavilion.|$|E
2500|$|With {{the risk}} {{assessment}} complete, the IA practitioner then develops a risk management plan. This plan proposes countermeasures that involve mitigating, eliminating, accepting, or transferring the risks, and considers prevention, detection, {{and response to}} threats. A framework published by a standards organization, such as Risk IT, CobiT, PCI DSS or ISO/IEC 27002, may guide development. Countermeasures may include technical tools such as firewalls and anti-virus software, policies and procedures requiring such controls as regular backups and configuration hardening, employee training in security awareness, or organizing personnel into <b>dedicated</b> <b>computer</b> emergency response team (CERT) or computer security incident response team (CSIRT). [...] The cost and benefit of each countermeasure is carefully considered. Thus, the IA practitioner does not seek to eliminate all risks, were that possible, but to manage them in the most cost-effective way.|$|E
