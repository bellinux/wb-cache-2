Formaldehyde improves colorfastness through crosslinking reac-tions. Improvement in the fastness properties occur during the reaction of two dye molecules with one molecule of formaldehyde through the formation of a methylene bridge. 3 It is also possible that one formaldehyde molecule could react with one dye molecule and one hydroxyl group of cellulose. Both reac-tions could decrease the dye desorption from the fiber. Because of its high reac-tivity, formaldehyde {{is one of the most}} effective fixatives for direct dyes.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to appraise the fastness properties of some natural dyes of plant origin on cotton fabric. Owing to the growing trend of going "green" throughout the world, a renewed international interest has developed in the dyeing of textiles with natural colourants. These dyes exhibit better biodegradability and are usually well compatible with the environment. They contain natural colouring matter which is generally non-allergic, non-toxic, non-carcinogenic and non-hazardous to the user and environment. Common drawbacks of natural dyes are their non-uniform shades and poor to moderate colourfastness. In this research project, solvent extracted dyes from alkanet (Alkana tinctoria), cutch (Acacia catechu), madder (Rubia tinctorum) and ready to use dyes from marigold flower (Tegetes erecta L) and Turkey red (Rubia cordifolia) have been applied on cotton fabric through pad-steam dyeing procedure. To evaluate the possibility of increasing their colour fastness, various dyeing auxiliaries (mordants, UV absorbers, cationizing agents, crosslinkers, etc.) have been applied by pre-treatment and post-treatment techniques. Metallic mordants included aluminium sulphate, copper sulphate, ferric chloride, potassium dichromate and hydrated potassium aluminium sulphate or alum. Better fastness (wash, light, crocking), colour coordinates (lightness, chroma, hue and colour strength) as well as improvement in tensile strength was achieved with postmordanting of copper sulphate on most of these dyes. Pre-mordanting of potassium dichromate brutally damaged the tensile strength of the alkanet dyed sample. Cationization of cotton with quaternary ammonium compound (Albafix WFF) has improved the fastness properties, tensile strength as well as relative colour strength (K/S) of <b>cotton</b> <b>dyed</b> with alkanet, cutch and marigold flower dyes. Post-padding of reactive UV absorber based on oxalanilide (UV-SUN) and UV absorber Rayosan C (heterocyclic compound) greatly increased the light fastness of <b>cotton</b> fabric, <b>dyed</b> with these dyes. Similarly, post-treatment of soft polyurethane emulsion (Dicrylan) has enhanced the light and wash fastness as well as retained the tensile strength of natural <b>dyed</b> <b>cotton.</b> The use of crosslinkers could not bring further enhancement in the K/S value of <b>cotton</b> <b>dyed</b> with alkanet and generally, they yielded lighter shade. Cutch root extract yielded variety of beautiful brown shades with different mordants. It made an excellent demonstration of the colour fastness and tensile strength of cotton. Improved fastness properties and tensile strength have resulted from the postpadding of crosslinkers i. e., Knittex (modified dihydroxyethylene urea) and Fixapret F ECO (modified dimethyloldihydroxyethylene urea) on cutch <b>dyed</b> <b>cotton.</b> Pre-treatments of most of the metallic mordants have decreased the tensile strength of Turkey red <b>dyed</b> <b>cotton</b> to a great extent. Madder was the least successful dye in terms of fastness and tensile properties. The post-padding of crosslinkers glyoxalmonourein (Fixapret CPF) on marigold flower dyed sample imparted good fastness properties in addition to improving the tensile strength of the fabric. However, the shade of sample was lighter (pale yellow) than the other dye formulations. Among the two types of treatments, post padding proved significantly better in most of the dyeing recipes...|$|R

Our results show that enzyme removing is the most effective method, among all tested methods, in the removing of resistant old adhesives and stains. The tested enzymes for the removing technique solved the problems caused by other traditional removing techniques of resistant old adhesives from museum textiles.

Furthermore, the effect of enzymes on the morphology of the surface of the untreated and enzymatically treated dyed fabric was investigated by using SEM and Stereoscopy. The effect of enzymes as a function of enzyme concentration and time of treatment on the fabrics color parameters was extensively studied.
