25|$|Conventional {{inbreeding}} procedures {{take six}} generations to achieve approximately complete <b>homozygosity,</b> whereas doubled haploidy achieves {{it in one}} generation. Dihaploid plants derived from tetraploid crop plants may be important for breeding programs that involve diploid wild relatives of the crops.|$|E
25|$|Diploid Artemia parthenogenetica {{reproduce}} by automictic parthenogenesis {{with central}} fusion (see diagram) and low but nonzero recombination. Central fusion {{of two of}} the haploid products of meiosis (see diagram) tends to maintain heterozygosity in transmission of the genome from mother to offspring, and to minimise inbreeding depression. Low crossover recombination during meiosis likely restrains the transition from heterozygosity to <b>homozygosity</b> over successive generations.|$|E
25|$|Achondroplasia can be {{detected}} before birth {{by the use of}} prenatal ultrasound. A DNA test can be performed before birth to detect <b>homozygosity,</b> wherein two copies of the mutant gene are inherited, a lethal condition leading to stillbirths. Clinical features include megalocephaly, short limbs, prominent forehead, thoracolumbar kyphosis and mid-facial hypoplasia. Complications like dental malocclusion, hydrocephalus and repeated otitis media can be observed. The risk of death in infancy is increased due to the likelihood of compression of the spinal cord with or without upper airway obstruction.|$|E
25|$|Serum {{transferrin}} and transferrin saturation {{are commonly}} used as screening for haemochromatosis. Transferrin binds iron and is responsible for iron transport in the blood. Measuring transferrin provides a crude measure of iron stores in the body. Fasting transferrin saturation values in excess of 45% for males or 35% in premenopausal women (i.e. 300ng/L in males and 200ng/L in females) are recognized as a threshold for further evaluation of haemochromatosis. Transferrin saturation greater than 62% is suggestive of <b>homozygosity</b> for mutations in the HFE gene.|$|E
25|$|Somatic {{cells are}} an {{additional}} resource {{which can be}} retrieved for gene banking, particularly {{in the cases of}} emergency wherein gametes cannot be collected or stored. Tissues can be taken from living animals or shortly after death. These tissues can be saved via cryopreservation or dehydrated. Blood cells can also be useful for DNA analysis such as comparing <b>homozygosity</b> It is recommended by the FAO that two vials of blood be drawn to reduce the chance that all samples will be lost from a particular animal. DNA can be extracted using commercial kits, making this an affordable and accessible strategy for collecting germplasms.|$|E
25|$|Mutations of the HFE gene {{account for}} 90% {{of the cases}} of non-transfusional iron overload. This gene is {{closely linked to the}} HLA-A3 locus. <b>Homozygosity</b> for the C282Y {{mutation}} is the most common genotype responsible for clinical iron accumulation, though heterozygosity for C282Y/H63D mutations, so-called compound heterozygotes, results in clinically evident iron overload. There is considerable debate regarding the penetrance—the probability of clinical expression of the trait given the genotype—is for clinical disease in HHC homozygotes. Most, if not all, males homozygous for HFE C282Y will show manifestations of liver dysfunction such as elevated liver-specific enzymes such as serum gamma glutamyltransferase (GGT) by late middle age. Homozygous females can delay the onset of iron accumulation because of iron loss through menstruation.|$|E
25|$|In humans, {{a common}} {{polymorphism}} involves {{the substitution of}} an arginine for a proline at codon position 72. Many studies have investigated a genetic link between this variation and cancer susceptibility; however, {{the results have been}} controversial. For instance, a meta-analysis from 2009 failed to show a link for cervical cancer. A 2011 study found that the TP53 proline mutation did {{have a profound effect on}} pancreatic cancer risk among males. A study of Arab women found that proline <b>homozygosity</b> at TP53 codon 72 is associated with a decreased risk for breast cancer. One study suggested that TP53 codon 72 polymorphisms, MDM2 SNP309, and A2164G may collectively be associated with non-oropharyngeal cancer susceptibility and that MDM2 SNP309 in combination with TP53 codon 72 may accelerate the development of non-oropharyngeal cancer in women. A 2011 study found that TP53 codon 72 polymorphism was associated with an increased risk of lung cancer.|$|E
25|$|The lower Himalayan foothills and Inner Terai or Doon Valleys of Nepal and India {{are highly}} malarial {{due to a}} warm climate and marshes {{sustained}} {{during the dry season}} by groundwater percolating down from the higher hills. Malarial forests were intentionally maintained by the rulers of Nepal as a defensive measure. Humans attempting to live in this zone suffered much higher mortality than at higher elevations or below on the drier Gangetic Plain. However, the Tharu people had lived in this zone long enough to evolve resistance via multiple genes. Medical studies among the Tharu and non-Tharu population of the Terai yielded the evidence that the prevalence of cases of residual malaria is nearly seven times lower among Tharus. The basis for resistance has been established to be <b>homozygosity</b> of α-Thalassemia gene within the local population. Endogamy along caste and ethnic lines appear to have prevented these genes from being more widespread in neighboring populations.|$|E
500|$|Both {{dominant}} {{white and}} [...] "Sabino-White" [...] horses are identified by all-white or near-white coats with underlying pink skin and dark eyes, often with residual pigment along the dorsal midline. [...] However, there are genetic differences. [...] The term [...] "dominant white" [...] {{is reserved for}} known W alleles. Dominant white horses are heterozygous for any one of 11 known alleles of the KIT gene (e.g. W8/+). <b>Homozygosity</b> {{for some of the}} 11 known alleles may not create a viable embryo. In contrast, Sabino-White horses are homozygous for the Sabino 1 allele of the KIT gene (SB1/SB1).|$|E
500|$|Parthenogenesis is {{a natural}} form of {{reproduction}} in which growth and development of embryos occur without fertilization. A. piscivorus can reproduce by facultative parthenogenesis, that is, {{they are capable of}} switching from a sexual mode of reproduction to an asexual mode. [...] The type of parthenogenesis that likely occurs is [...] "automixis with terminal fusion", a process in which two terminal products from the same meiosis fuse to form a diploid zygote (see Figure). [...] This process leads to genome wide <b>homozygosity,</b> expression of deleterious recessive alleles and often to developmental failure (inbreeding depression). [...] Both captive-born and wild-born A. piscivorus specimens appear to be capable of this form of parthenogenesis.|$|E

2500|$|Analysis of {{mountain}} gorilla genomes by whole genome sequencing {{indicates that a}} recent decline in their population size has led to extensive inbreeding. [...] As an apparent result, individuals are typically homozygous for 34% of their genome sequence. [...] Furthermore, <b>homozygosity</b> and the expression of deleterious recessive mutations as consequences of inbreeding have likely resulted in the purging of severely deleterious mutations from the population.|$|E
2500|$|The {{existence}} of the LSI mechanism among different taxa and in general, is subject for scientific debate. Criticizers claim, that absence of fruit set is due to genetic defects (<b>homozygosity</b> for lethal recessive alleles), which are {{the direct result of}} self-fertilization [...] (inbreeding depression). Supporters, on the other hand, argue for the {{existence of}} several basic criteria, which differentiate certain cases of LSI from the inbreeding depression phenomenon.|$|E

2500|$|Flowers of Lacandonia [...] are {{bisexual}} and self-pollinate and fertilize {{before the}} flower opens (preanthesis cleistogamy). They are true flowers {{as opposed to}} pseudanthia as had been suggested earlier in the literature. The three-celled pollen grains germinate within the anthers and the pollen tube grows through the receptacle to reach the ovaries. L. schismatica can be found flowering year-round when its environment is moist enough, with a particularly active flowering period in November and December. Owing to the prenathesis cleistogamy, a form of autogamy (self-pollination), the known population of L. schismatica lacks genetic variability and has a high instance of <b>homozygosity.</b> The haploid chromosome number of this species is n=9.|$|E
2500|$|Parthenogenesis is {{a natural}} form of {{reproduction}} in which growth and development of embryos occur without fertilization.

2500|$|The disease most {{commonly}} associated with mutations in SCNN1A is the multi-system form of type I pseudohypoaldosteronism (PHA1B) that was first characterized by A. Hanukoglu as an autosomal recessive disease. This is a syndrome of unresponsiveness to aldosterone in patients that have high serum levels of aldosterone but suffer from symptoms of aldosterone deficiency with {{a high risk of}} mortality due to severe salt loss. Initially, this disease was thought to be [...] a result of a mutation in the [...] mineralocorticoid receptor (NR3C2) that binds aldosterone. But <b>homozygosity</b> mapping in 11 affected families revealed that the disease is associated with two loci on chromosome 12p13.1-pter and chromosome 16p12.2-13 that include the genes for SCNN1A and SCNN1B and SCNN1G respectively. Sequencing of the ENaC genes identified mutation in affected patients, and functional expression of the mutated cDNAs further confirmed that identified mutations lead to the loss of activity of ENaC.|$|E
5000|$|This {{analysis}} is often extended by analyzing autozygosity, {{an extension of}} <b>homozygosity,</b> in the genomes of affected individuals. [...] This {{can be accomplished by}} plotting a cumulative LOD score alongside the overlaid blocks of <b>homozygosity.</b> By taking into consideration the population allele frequencies for all SNPs via autozygosity mapping, the results of <b>homozygosity</b> can be confirmed. [...] Furthermore, if two suspicious regions appear as a result of <b>homozygosity</b> mapping, autozygosity mapping may be able to distinguish between the two (ex. If one block of <b>homozygosity</b> is a result of a very non-diverse region of the genome, the LOD score will be very low).|$|E

50|$|Single queen {{colonies of}} the narrow headed ant Formica exsecta provide an illustrative example of the {{possible}} deleterious effects of increased <b>homozygosity.</b> In this ant the level of queen <b>homozygosity</b> is negatively associated with colony age.

50|$|Introducing alleles from a {{different}} population can reverse inbreeding depression. Different populations {{of the same species}} have different deleterious traits, and therefore their cross breeding will not result in <b>homozygosity</b> at most loci in the offspring.

50|$|Malformations or harmful traits {{can stay}} within a {{population}} {{due to a}} high <b>homozygosity</b> rate, and this will cause a population to become fixed for certain traits, like having too many bones in an area, like the vertebral column of wolves on Isle Royale or having cranial abnormalities, such as in Northern elephant seals, where their cranial bone length in the lower mandibular tooth row has changed. Having a high <b>homozygosity</b> rate is problematic for a population because it will unmask recessive deleterious alleles generated by mutations, reduce heterozygote advantage, and it is detrimental {{to the survival of}} small, endangered animal populations. When deleterious recessive alleles are unmasked due to the increased <b>homozygosity</b> generated by inbreeding, this can cause inbreeding depression.|$|E
5000|$|In the {{sub-section}} on [...] "The sample gamodemes - Genetic drift", {{a series}} of gamete samplings was followed, an outcome of which {{was an increase in}} <b>homozygosity</b> at the expense of heterozygosity. From this viewpoint, the rise in <b>homozygosity</b> was due to the gamete samplings. Levels of <b>homozygosity</b> can be viewed also according to whether homozygotes arose allozygously or autozygously. Recall that autozygous alleles have the same allelic origin, the likelihood (frequency) of which is the inbreeding coefficient (f) by definition. The proportion arising allozygously is therefore (1-f). For the A-bearing gametes, which are present with a general frequency of p, the overall frequency of those that are autozygous is therefore (f p). Similarly, for a-bearing gametes, the autozygous frequency is (f q). These two viewpoints regarding genotype frequencies must be connected to establish consistency.|$|E
5000|$|The {{compound}} allele G*-13915 & C*-3712 was {{proved to}} be located on {{a long stretch of}} <b>homozygosity</b> (1.1 Mb [...] to 1.3 Mb [...] ).|$|E
50|$|Inbreeding {{increases}} {{the chances of}} the expression of deleterious recessive alleles by increasing <b>homozygosity</b> and therefore {{has the potential to}} decrease the fitness of the offspring. With continuous inbreeding, genetic variation is lost and <b>homozygosity</b> is increased, enabling the expression of recessive deleterious alleles in homozygotes. The inbreeding coefficient, a term used to describe the degree of inbreeding in an individual, is an estimate of the percent of homozygous alleles in the overall genome. The more biologically related the parents are, the greater the inbreeding coefficient (See Coefficient of Inbreeding), since their genomes have many similarities already. This overall <b>homozygosity</b> becomes an issue when there are deleterious recessive alleles in the gene pool of the family. By pairing chromosomes of similar genomes, the chance for these recessive alleles to pair and become homozygous greatly increases, leading to offspring with autosomal recessive disorders.|$|E
5000|$|Automixis with {{terminal}} fusion {{tends to}} promote <b>homozygosity</b> {{in the passage}} of the genome from mother to daughter. This form of automixis has been observed in the water flea Daphnia magna and the Colombian rainbow boa constrictor Epicrates maurus. [...] Parthenogenesis in E. maurus is only the third genetically confirmed case of consecutive virgin births of viable offspring from a single female within any vertebrate lineage. [...] However, survival of offspring over two successive litters was poor, suggesting that automixis with terminal fusion leads to <b>homozygosity</b> and expression of deleterious recessive alleles (inbreeding depression).|$|E
