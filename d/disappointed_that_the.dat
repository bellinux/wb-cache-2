5|$|Mr. Eko {{received}} many positive responses from critics and fans, who were <b>disappointed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> character was killed after one season. A toy figure of Mr. Eko {{was included in}} a second series of Lost toy figures distributed by McFarlane Toys.|$|E
5|$|In 1844, the community, perpetually {{struggling}} financially, drafted {{an entirely}} new constitution and committed to following more closely the Fourierist model. Not everyone at the community supported the transition, and many left. Many were <b>disappointed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> new, more structured daily routine de-emphasized the carefree leisure time {{that had been a}} trademark. Ripley himself became a celebrity proponent of Fourierism and organized conventions throughout New England to discuss the community.|$|E
5|$|The DS {{version of}} the game, which was {{significantly}} different from the other versions, received praise for its unique gameplay, but criticism for its short length. IGN lauded the DS version's unique gameplay experience and GameSpot proclaimed that it was satisfying from start to finish. GameSpot and GameZone, however, were both <b>disappointed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> game was extremely brief. 1UP found that even though The Simpsons Game parodied numerous 2D platform game conventions, it used them anyway, making it a pointless endeavor.|$|E
5000|$|It was <b>disappointing</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Bayern {{management}} didn't show us any respect, {{there was}} an air of arrogance about them. We used that as a stimulus.|$|R
50|$|It is <b>disappointing</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> 30th {{amendment}} {{has been}} narrowly defeated but the Constitution is something <b>that</b> belongs to <b>the</b> {{people and we}} acknowledge and accept the people's democratic decision. We will reflect and carefully consider {{the outcome of this}} referendum.|$|R
5000|$|Senator Jeff Sessions (R-AL), {{the ranking}} member on the Senate Budget Committee said <b>that</b> [...] "it's <b>disappointing</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{president}} produced a campaign document {{instead of putting}} forth a serious budget blueprint <b>that</b> makes <b>the</b> tough choices necessary to get our fiscal house in order." ...|$|R
5|$|Curie's {{quest to}} create a new {{laboratory}} did not end with the University of Paris, however. In her later years, she headed the Radium Institute (Institut du radium, now Curie Institute, Institut Curie), a radioactivity laboratory created for her by the Pasteur Institute and the University of Paris. The initiative for creating the Radium Institute had come in 1909 from Pierre Paul Émile Roux, director of the Pasteur Institute, who had been <b>disappointed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> University of Paris was not giving Curie a proper laboratory and had suggested that she move to the Pasteur Institute. Only then, with the threat of Curie leaving, did the University of Paris relent, and eventually the Curie Pavilion became a joint initiative of the University of Paris and the Pasteur Institute.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} session of the 33rd Congress, Breckinridge acted as {{spokesman}} for Ways and Means Committee bills, including a bill to assume and pay the debts Texas incurred prior to its annexation. Breckinridge's friends, W. W. Corcoran and Jesse D. Bright, were two of Texas's major creditors. The bill, which was approved, paid only those debts related to powers Texas surrendered to Congress upon annexation. Breckinridge was <b>disappointed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> House defeated a measure to pay the Sioux $12,000 owed them for the 1839 purchase of {{an island in the}} Mississippi River; the debt was never paid. Another increase in the subsidy to the Collins Line passed over his opposition, but Pierce vetoed it.|$|E
5|$|Reviewers {{commented that}} the imaginative {{character}} designs and use of advanced graphics technology, such as hardware transform and lighting, and bump mapping, made the graphics of the game unrivaled in its time; ActionTrip was so impressed by the game's visuals that they thought their graphics card was supporting the complex hardware environmental bump mapping it was incapable of. The animation of Kabuto's antics such as elbow dropping onto tiny enemies, and tossing up and catching food with his mouth, in particular, won the praises of reviewers. Many critics, however, were <b>disappointed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> computer versions of the game could not run smoothly at full details on the recommended system specifications.|$|E

50|$|The {{tortured}} wording and {{the many}} limitations in this Annex shows the Swiss Government trying to preserve as much bank secrecy as it can for the future, while pushing to conceal the names {{of tens of thousands}} of suspected U.S. tax cheats. It is <b>disappointing</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> U.S. government went along.|$|R
40|$|The {{process of}} {{scientific}} discovery is presented by David Paydarfar and William J. Schwartz as a tongue-in-cheek flow diagram, {{as well as}} a (presumably) more serious set of informal heuristics (or “principles”) (Editorial, 6 Apr., p. 13). I find it somewhat <b>disappointing</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> psychology of discovery would be treated in such an informal fashion [...] ...|$|R
5|$|After {{the death}} of the Prince Imperial, Beatrice's brother, Albert Edward, the Prince of Wales, {{suggested}} that she marry their sister Alice's widower, Louis IV, the Grand Duke of Hesse, who had lost his wife to diphtheria in 1878. Albert Edward argued that Beatrice could act as replacement mother for Louis's young children and spend most of her time in England looking after her mother. He further suggested the Queen could oversee the upbringing of her Hessian grandchildren with greater ease. However, at the time, it was forbidden by law for Beatrice to marry her sister's widower. This was countered by the Prince of Wales, who vehemently supported passage by the Houses of Parliament of the Deceased Wife's Sister Bill, which would have removed the obstacle. Despite popular support for this measure and although it passed in the House of Commons, it was rejected by the House of Lords because of opposition from the Lords Spiritual. Although the Queen was <b>disappointed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> bill had failed, she was happy to keep her daughter at her side.|$|E
5|$|Jim Henson {{originally}} {{conceived of}} his Muppets as characters aimed at an adult audience. He was <b>disappointed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{popularity of the}} characters that appeared in Sesame Street, including Big Bird and Bert and Ernie, had solidified a public perception his Muppets were solely intended for educating children. Henson worried he would be stuck forever working on children's television series. He felt his Muppet characters {{should be able to}} be appreciated by individuals of any maturity level. Henson told The Saturday Evening Post he had constantly dealt with others looking down upon the idea of puppet performers. He envied ventriloquist Edgar Bergen for his ability to appeal to a mature audience. Henson said he wanted to work on a program that was broadcast during the peak adult-viewing time and said he had prior difficulty persuading the major television networks to create a puppet program for mature audiences.|$|E
5|$|Mulder and Scully rent a {{boat and}} head out onto the lake; their boat is quickly struck by {{something}} and sinks. The two find a large rock to climb up on and talk for a while about Mulder's quest to catch Big Blue, and the book Moby-Dick. When Dr. Farraday walks by the two realize they were close to shore all along. Mulder thinks the drop in the frog supply has caused Big Blue to move closer to shore and seek alternative food sources. Farraday is soon attacked but manages {{to make it out}} alive. Mulder chases the attacker into the woods and fires at it, revealing it to be an alligator. Mulder is <b>disappointed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> killer ended up being an alligator and not Big Blue. As the agents leave, Big Blue swims nearby in the lake, unnoticed.|$|E

Unfortunately, a reunited Cyprus will not now be joining the European Union on 1 May." ...|$|R
5|$|The {{official}} {{soundtrack of}} Ocarina of Time {{was published by}} Pony Canyon and released in Japan on December 18, 1998. It comprises one compact disc with 82 tracks. A US version was also released, although with fewer tracks and different packaging artwork. Many critics praised the music in Ocarina of Time, although IGN was <b>disappointed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> traditional Zelda overworld theme was not included. In 2001, {{three years after the}} initial release of Ocarina of Time, GameSpot labeled it {{as one of the top}} ten video game soundtracks. The soundtrack, at the time, was not released in Europe or Australia. In 2011, however, a 51-track limited edition soundtrack for the 3DS version was available in a free mail out through a Club Nintendo offer to owners of the 3DS edition, as an incentive to register the product. The original musical theme for the Fire Temple area was altered before release of the game, due to Nintendo's policy of not including real religious references in their products, with the altered theme simply removing the chanting samples.|$|E
5|$|Gateshead International Stadium {{has been}} used for many years as a concert venue. On 31 July 1982, The Police {{performed}} at the stadium as part of their Ghost in the Machine Tour, with U2 as a supporting act. Reports in the local press suggested that The Police seemed <b>disappointed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> stadium was only half full and cited high ticket prices and poor weather as possible causes. On 16 June 1992 Guns N' Roses, supported by Soundgarden and Faith No More, performed at the stadium. This time the weather was hot and sunny which helped ensure that the concert, part of the Use Your Illusion Tour, was a sell-out. American rock group Bon Jovi have played twice at the stadium. The first occasion was on 27 June 1995, while supported by Skin, on their These Days Tour. The group returned to Gateshead on 22 August 2000 as part of their Crush Tour. Another artist who has performed multiple times at Gateshead International Stadium is Tina Turner. As part of her , Turner performed twice on consecutive nights (2122 July 1990) and attracted a total of 60,000 spectators. Turner performed for a third time at the stadium as part of her Wildest Dreams Tour on 12 July 1996. Other artists to have played at the stadium include Bryan Adams, Rod Stewart, Simple Minds and Simply Red.|$|E

But considering Shontelles high-achieving past, its <b>disappointing</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> handful of shining moments are dimmed by a barrage of mediocrity. Still, with her strong ambition and clear determination to succeed, you wouldnt bet against her best being yet to come.|$|R

25|$|At a {{press conference}} in Enfield, Connecticut, on Friday, March 20, Dodd responded to critics and {{explained}} that his original answer to a CNN answer was based on a misunderstanding of the question.

25|$|Dyer ran unsuccessfully {{for reelection}} in 1932, 1934 and 1936, during the Great Depression. Black voters had been <b>disappointed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Republicans {{had failed to}} deliver on their promise to pass an anti-lynching law, part of the {{national}} platform in 1920, and by President Hoover's approach to dealing with economic problems. The administration of President Franklin D. Roosevelt attracted many voters to Democratic candidates because he was putting people to work through the Works Progress Administration and providing social aid programs.|$|E

5000|$|The CNN review {{called the}} novel [...] "well researched, and quite imaginative" [...] with [...] "compelling battle sequences" [...] and also at times even evoking [...] "sentimental pride for the USMC." [...] On SFRevu, Ernest Lilley said the novel {{was similar to}} a Tom Clancy techno-thriller with its well {{constructed}} and plausible world political situation. Though praising Douglas for his depiction of extraterrestrial combat he found it <b>disappointing</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> alien artifacts had such a low profile.|$|R

The tour moved to the South of France and Barcelona, Spain, then on to Italy. While in Rome, a Wild West delegation was received by Pope Leo XIII. Buffalo Bill was <b>disappointed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> condition of the Colosseum did not allow it to be a venue; however, at Verona, the Wild West did perform in the ancient Roman amphitheater. The tour finished with stops in Austria-Hungary and Germany.|$|E
25|$|Coombs's most {{important}} post-retirement role {{was as a}} supporter of the Australian Aboriginal people. In 1967, he became chairman of the Council for Aboriginal Affairs, set up by the Holt Government {{in the wake of the}} referendum that gave the Commonwealth Parliament power to legislate specifically for the Aboriginal people. He was, however, <b>disappointed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Gorton and McMahon Governments took up few of the Council's recommendations. He became a close advisor to the Labor leader Gough Whitlam in the years before Whitlam became prime minister in 1972, and he largely wrote Labor's policy on Aboriginal affairs, particularly the commitment to Aboriginal land rights. In 1972, he was named Australian of the Year.|$|E

The station turned Tracht's request for privacy into a marketing ploy. Curtains were hung {{in the window of}} the broadcast booth, a TV interview showed only his lips, and Tracht wore a gorilla costume at personal appearances. Tracht was named as the top radio personality in the United States for 1977 and 1980. In 1979, he signed a five-year contract worth $1 million.|$|E
