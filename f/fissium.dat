40|$|The heat {{contents}} of high-purity uranium and uranium-fissium alloys containing 3, 5, and 8 wt. % <b>fissium</b> were measured at temperatures from 0 deg C through their fusion temperatures. The total heat content above 0 deg C {{was determined by}} drop calorimetry and quantitative differential thermal analysis. The total heat content from 0 to 1200 deg C {{was found to be}} 16. 1 plus or minus 0. 3, 16. 3 plus or minus 0. 6, 16. 3 plus or minus 0. 6, and 16. 4 plus or minus 0. 4 kcal per equivalent gram atom, for the 0, 3, 5, and 8 wt. % <b>fissium</b> alloys, respectively. Curves of the heat content versus temperature are plotted for all the alloys and the high-purity uranium. Heats of transition and of fusion were determined. The directly measured value of 2. 9 plus or minus 0. 1 kcal/g-atom for the heat of fusion of uranium is consistent with that of the alloys. (auth...|$|E
40|$|AbstractA new an {{innovative}} separation method {{has been developed}} using N-n-octylaniline (liquid anion exchanger) coated on silica gel. Ruthenium(III) has been extracted quantitatively from 0. 05 M hydrochloric acid, striped with aqueous solution of various acids and then determined by spectrophotometric method. Mutual separation scheme for ruthenium(III), iridium(III) and osmium(VIII) has been developed. Ruthenium(III) has been separated from commonly associated elements. Different parameter are studied viz effect of acid concentration, reagent concentration, striping agent, flow rate, foreign ion and synthetic mixture corresponding to alloys. Validity of method has been verified by separation of ruthenium(III) from <b>fissium</b> alloy...|$|E
40|$|Report {{regarding}} "[t]he Fuel Cycle Facility for the Second Experimental Breeder Reactor (EBR-II), {{the process}} equipment, and the operations {{to be conducted}} in the facility are described. The Fuel Cycle Facility is a plant for reprocessing, by pyro-metallurgical methods, the core and blanket material discharged from EBR-II. The reactor core alloy is uranium- 5 percent <b>fissium</b> and contains about 46 wt. % Uranium- 235. The blanket material consists of uranium in which plutonium is bred. Core and blanket subassemblies contained in transfer coffins are transferred between EBR-II and the Fuel Cycle Facility, which is in an adjacent building. " (p. 13...|$|E
40|$|The {{possibilities}} of purification of reactor fuel materials by processing in liquid zinc media were studied. Information was accumulated on solubilities of uranium, zirconium, ruthenium, palladium, banium, cerium, and molybdenum In liquid zinc {{as a function}} of temperature. Additional information on solubilities of ruthenium, zirconium, barium, and cerium in uranium-saturated zinc solutions was obtained along with data on the behavior of individual elements in complex zinc solutions resulting from solution in zinc of <b>fissium</b> alloys. The effects of magnesium addition to zinc solutions were examined, and several of the engineering operations required for fullscale development were demonstrated. Some chemical reactions in liquid zinc media were briefly explored. (auth...|$|E
40|$|The EBR-II {{environmental}} instrumented subassembly (EISA), or Test XX 07, was designed, fabricated, and irradiated {{to provide}} in-core measurements of irradiation conditions. This subassembly contained 57 elements with uranium metal- 5 wt. % <b>fissium</b> fuel and four non-fueled elements. It was instrumented with two permanent-magnet flowmeters, 13 coolant thermocouples at various axial and radial locations, 10 fuel-centerline thermocouples, and two self-powered detectors. The subassembly was irradiated in EBR-II for about 11, 600 MWd (- 186 days), reaching a peak burnup of about 2. 9 at. % During its {{residence in the}} reactor, XX 07 provided in-core measurements of flow, temperature and flux levels under both steady-state and dynamic conditions...|$|E
40|$|The Pacific Northwest Laboratory has {{evaluated}} {{the basis for}} moving selected spent nuclear fuels in the CPP- 603 and CPP- 666 storage pools at the Idaho Chemical Processing Plant from wet to dry interim storage. This work is being conducted for the Lockheed Idaho Technologies Company {{as part of the}} effort to determine appropriate conditioning and dry storage requirements for these fuels. These spent fuels are from 22 test reactors and include elements clad with aluminum or stainless steel and a wide variety of fuel materials: UAl{sub x}, UAl{sub x}-Al and U{sub 3 }O{sub 8 }-Al cermets, U- 5 % <b>fissium,</b> UMo, UZrH{sub x}, UErZrH, UO{sub 2 }-stainless steel cermet, and U{sub 3 }O{sub 8 }-stainless steel cermet. The study also included declad uranium-zirconium hydride spent fuel stored in the CPP- 603 storage pools. The current condition and potential failure mechanisms for these spent fuels were evaluated to determine the impact on conditioning and dry storage requirements. Initial recommendations for conditioning and dry storage requirements are made based on the potential degradation mechanisms and their impacts on moving the spent fuel from wet to dry storage. Areas needing further evaluation are identified...|$|E
