Copper is used mostly as a pure metal, but when greater hardness is required, it <b>is</b> <b>put</b> <b>into</b> such alloys as brass and bronze (5% of total use). For {{more than two}} centuries, copper paint has been used on boat hulls to control the growth of plants and shellfish. A {{small part of the}} copper supply is used for nutritional supplements and fungicides in agriculture. Machining of copper is possible, although alloys are preferred for good machinability in creating intricate parts.|$|E

Diego secretly plans to steal an experimental mutagenic virus being tested on Citadel Station, and to sell it on the black market as a biological weapon.

5|$|Homer, {{who still}} wants to party, rents an airboat and forces his family to come with him. He races through a swamp, accidentally killing the state's most famous {{resident}} and reptile – an alligator named Captain Jack, whom Marge, Maggie, Lisa, and Bart saw on a tour earlier while Homer made a fool of himself at the concert. A sheriff quickly arrives {{on the scene and}} despite the fact that Homer is the sole guilty culprit, the entire family is charged for killing the alligator. The family members flee from the sheriff and during a car chase they are hit by a train that pushes their car on the rail for several miles. When the Simpsons get off of the rail, they escape to a restaurant where they are given employment. They live in a nearby trailer and progressively turn into hillbillies. The sheriff eventually tracks them down and kidnaps them while they are sleeping. For their crimes (and Homer's foolish attempt at defending himself in court), the family <b>is</b> <b>put</b> <b>into</b> forced labor. One night when they are working at a party held by a judge in front of the capitol, tending to the guests (and failing to escape), Captain Jack strolls out of the capitol's doors.

50|$|All {{of these}} linearized objects <b>are</b> <b>put</b> <b>into</b> {{envelopes}} that enable {{the client and}} server agents to coordinate their processing. In DDM architecture, these envelopes are called Data Stream Structures (DSS).

Further many OBJDSSes can be chained to a RQSDSS or a PRYDSS to accommodate as many objects as necessary A DSS consists of the total length of the DSS, a flag byte identifying the type of DSS, a request identifier, and the linearized objects in the DSS. The request identifier ties an RQSDSS with subsequent OBJDSSes from the client, such as the records to be loaded into a file by the Load File command. The request identifier also ties the RQSDSS from the client with a RPYDSS or the OBJDSSes from the server to the client.|$|R
