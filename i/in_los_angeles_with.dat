5|$|Blackout {{represents}} a musical departure from Spears' earlier work featuring a foreboding and atmospheric tone {{in terms of}} musical and lyrical direction. She collaborated with producers including Danja, Bloodshy & Avant, Sean Garrett, and The Neptunes in several recording studios around the United States, including Spears' home <b>in</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles,</b> <b>with</b> the intention of creating uptempo, high-energy music. Their efforts resulted in a primarily dance-pop and electropop record, which sees additional influences from Euro disco, dubstep and funk. The lyrical themes revolve around love, fame, media scrutiny, sex, and clubbing.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, {{joined by}} her sister Kelley, Deal began {{recording}} sessions with engineer Steve Albini in Chicago. Fear members Mando Lopez and Richard Presley, and musician Jose Medeles, joined the line-up. The group continued recording with Albini in 2001. Title TK was compiled from {{the output of}} these sessions and supplemented with two tracks recorded <b>in</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles</b> <b>with</b> engineers Andrew Alekel and Mark Arnold. Of the twelve songs on the album, ten are credited solely to Kim Deal; {{the other two were}} written by all five band members.|$|E
5|$|Lovato {{also stated}} that her struggles with addictions not only caused her to nearly {{overdose}} several times, but later began to impact her ability to perform and promote her third studio album Unbroken, referencing a 2012 performance on the eleventh season of American Idol where she was severely hungover. After her management team had expressed their intentions to leave her, Lovato agreed to resume treatment and counseling for her addictions, leading to her move to a sober-living facility <b>in</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles</b> <b>with</b> roommates and responsibilities to help her overcome her drug and alcohol struggles.|$|E

5|$|Recorded <b>in</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles</b> <b>with</b> {{producer}} David Schiffman, {{the album}} was initially released on October 20, 2009, by Indica Records in Canada. By design, the album lacks the production values of the band's debut album, Hello Master, {{in order to achieve}} a more natural sound. As the band took more progressive rock influences and applied them to their songwriting, they changed their lyrical focus and wrote about themes considered to be more unusual for rock music, such as film and television characters, for this album.|$|E
5|$|Reign in Blood was {{recorded}} and produced <b>in</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles</b> <b>with</b> Rubin. The album was the label boss' first professional experience with heavy metal, and his fresh perspective {{led to a}} drastic makeover of Slayer's sound. Steve Huey of AllMusic believed Rubin drew tighter and faster songs from the band, and delivered a cleanly produced sound that contrasted sharply with their previous recordings. This resulted in drastic changes to Slayer's sound, and changed audiences' perception of the band. Araya has since stated their two previous releases were not up to par production-wise.|$|E
5|$|Song of Innocence is {{the debut}} album of American {{composer}} and producer David Axelrod. It {{was released in}} October 1968 by Capitol Records. Axelrod sought {{to capitalize on the}} experimental climate of popular music at the time and composed the album as a suite-like tone poem based on Songs of Innocence, a 1789 illustrated collection of poems by William Blake. It was recorded at Capitol Studios <b>in</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles</b> <b>with</b> an orchestra and a variety of studio musicians, including keyboardist and conductor Don Randi, guitarist Al Casey, bassist Carol Kaye, and drummer Earl Palmer.|$|E

5|$|The band entered Music Box Studios <b>in</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles</b> <b>with</b> Gordon and Fleming in March 1991, {{and worked}} on the album for one week; the songs were {{recorded}} {{over a period of}} four days, and were mixed {{over the course of a}} further three days. During the recording sessions for the album, Love purportedly gargled whiskey and excessively smoked cigarettes before takes to give a raw edge to her vocals.|$|E
5|$|The {{involvement}} of Lance Reddick and Ashly Burch was revealed in January 2017. Burch voiced Aloy, whose likeness was portrayed by Hannah Hoekstra and motion capture {{was performed by}} Amanda Piery in London. Following an auditioning process in 2014, Burch {{was called in to}} do the E3 2015 trailer and worked on the game for two years, providing facial motion capture as well. Her work was done <b>in</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles,</b> <b>with</b> the Dutch developer brought in via Skype. Reddick voiced Sylens and also provided his likeness to the character.|$|E
5|$|Thriller is {{the sixth}} studio album by American singer Michael Jackson, {{released}} on November 30, 1982, in the United States by Epic Records and internationally by CBS Records. The follow-up to Jackson's successful previous studio album, Off the Wall, it explores genres {{similar to those}} of its predecessor, including pop, post-disco, rock and funk. Recording sessions for the album took place from April to November 1982 at Westlake Recording Studios <b>in</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles,</b> <b>with</b> a production budget of $750,000.

5|$|Girlschool {{embarked}} {{in a long}} US tour {{to promote}} the album, sometimes as support to Quiet Riot and Blue Öyster Cult, but more often as headliner in small venues after uncomfortable travels. Johnson, unable to tolerate the unhealthy life on the road, quit the band before completing the US tour, hurting {{the promotion of the}} album in America. She went to live <b>in</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles</b> <b>with</b> Vicki Blue, former bassist of The Runaways. With the departure of Kelly Johnson, who was often considered the visual and musical focal point of the band, the almost bankrupt Bronze Records failed to extend the band's recording contract for a follow-up album.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} shot on {{location}} over 24 days <b>in</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles,</b> <b>with</b> {{a budget of}} $8 million. It was filmed by cinematographer Xavier Pérez Grobet, with whom Holofcener had previously worked on the HBO television series Enlightened. Although each scene was scripted, the actors would often ad-lib lines of dialogue. The final scene of the film, in which Eva and Albert reunite {{in front of his}} house, was improvised by Louis-Dreyfus and Gandolfini. It was edited by Robert Frazen, Holofcener's boyfriend at the time, who had also worked on all four of her previous films.|$|E
5|$|After {{the success}} of No Doubt's {{breakthrough}} album Tragic Kingdom (1995), the band wrote more than 20 songs for a new album, influenced by artists such as The Cure. Having toured extensively {{for two and a}} half years since the release of Tragic Kingdom, they initially had trouble producing material and decided to experiment with new sounds. Many of the songs were written in a rented house in Hollywood Hills, Los Angeles, where bassist Tony Kanal was living. During early production in mid-1998 the band worked on seven tracks <b>in</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles</b> <b>with</b> Matthew Wilder, who had produced Tragic Kingdom, but had creative differences with him. They planned on going to New York City to work with producer Michael Beinhorn, who had produced for alternative rock acts such as Red Hot Chili Peppers, Hole, and Soundgarden.|$|E
