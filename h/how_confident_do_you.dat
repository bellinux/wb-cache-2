40|$|Background: Cognitive {{behavioral}} therapy (CBT) {{usually involves}} homework, {{the completion of}} which is a known predictor of a positive outcome. The aim {{of the present study was}} to examine the session-by-session relationships between enthusiasm to complete the homework and the improvement of psychological distress in depressed people through the course of therapy. Methods: Working people with subthreshold depression were recruited to participate in the telephone CBT (tCBT) program with demonstrated effectiveness. Their enthusiasm for homework was enhanced with motivational interviewing techniques and was measured by asking two questions: "How strongly <b>do</b> <b>you</b> feel <b>you</b> want to <b>do</b> this homework?" and "How <b>confident</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> feel you can actually accomplish this homework?" at the end of each session. The outcome was the K 6 score, which was administered at the start of each session. The K 6 is an index of psychological distress including depression and anxiety. We used structural equation modeling (SEM) to elucidate the relationships between enthusiasm and the K 6 scores from session to session. Results: The best fitting model suggested that, throughout the course of behavior therapy (BT), enthusiasm to complete the homework was negatively correlated with the K 6 scores for the subsequent session, while the K 6 score measured at the beginning of the session did not influence the enthusiasm to complete the homeworks assigned for that session. Conclusions: Empirical data now support the practitioners of BT when they try to enhance their patient's enthusiasm for homework regardless of the participant's distress, which then would lead to a reduction in distress in the subsequent week.

S. and the fast growing population of international students coming to pursue degrees in America, the exploration of international students? perceived needs and expectations towards this new learning experience becomes critical. Chinese students are the second largest group of international students in the U. S., yet, studies on their learning needs and challenges in on-line learning are limited. This case study aims at exploring the experiences of three Chinese graduate students, who major in education and have taken at least one on-line course in their programs. Data were collected through three in-depth individual interviews with the participants. Three research questions guided the study: 1) How do Chinese students feel about taking an on-line course as compared with traditional face-to-face lecture? 2) <b>How</b> <b>confident</b> <b>do</b> Chinese students feel about their language competency when they participate in the discussions of an on-line course? 3) What is Chinese students? understanding of the cultural issues as they participate in the discussions of an on-line course? There were four themes generated from the cross-case analysis. The themes were: a) preference of face-to-face courses over on-line courses; b) English language proficiency as a major challenge; c) enjoyment of cross-cultural interaction, and personal growth from the experience. Results revealed that: 1) Participants always have a preference for face-to-face format and regarded face-to-face interaction as an indispensible component; yet, since participants also welcome the {{adoption of}} on-line technology, they recommended a combination of two or more instruction methods such as an on-line method with face-to-face method or synchronous on-line chats with asynchronous discussion; 2) Limitation in English language proficiency is constantly a major challenge for participants as international students; 3) Participants enjoyed the cross-cultural communication with peers; and 4) Participants consolidated their knowledge base and developed the awareness of being a culturally responsive teacher...|$|R
40|$|In July 2015, a {{legal duty}} came into force {{requiring}} that ‘specified authorities’, including schools and further education colleges (‘colleges’), show ‘due {{regard to the}} need to prevent people from being drawn into terrorism’ – popularly referred to as the ‘Prevent duty’. Since the Prevent duty was put before Parliament, it {{has been the focus of}} extensive and often highly polarised public debate. While the UK government has argued that the duty ‘doesn’t and shouldn’t stop schools from discussing controversial issues’, critics of the duty have maintained that it will have, and is having, a ‘chilling effect’ on free speech on schools and colleges. In addition, while the UK government has insisted that Prevent and the Prevent duty relate to all forms of extremism, critics argue that, whatever the intention of individual policymakers, practitioners and professionals, Prevent and the Prevent duty continue in practice to concentrate overwhelmingly on Muslim communities, thereby exacerbating stigmatisation of Muslim students. These debates made clear an urgent requirement for a stronger evidence base from which to understand and assess how the Prevent duty is playing out in schools and colleges. This report begins to respond to this requirement. Focusing on the experiences and attitudes of school and college staff, it examines four questions: 1) How has the new Prevent duty been interpreted by staff in schools and colleges in England? 2) <b>How</b> <b>confident</b> <b>do</b> school/college staff feel with regards to implementing the Prevent duty? 3) What impacts, if any, do school/college staff think the Prevent duty has had on their school or college, and on their interactions with students and parents? 4) To what extent, if at all, have school/college staff opposed or questioned the legitimacy of the Prevent duty? The report is based on in-depth qualitative interviews with 70 education professionals across 14 schools and colleges in 2 areas of England (West Yorkshire and London); in-depth qualitative interviews with 8 local authority level Prevent practitioners working in different local authority areas to support schools and colleges; and a national online survey of educationalists (n= 225) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{interview}} processes and techniques used in selected Indiana school corporations. More specifically, answers were sought to these questions: 1. How are interviews presently conducted in selected Indiana school corporations to obtain pertinent information needed to select the most competent candidate for each position? 2. How can interviews be conducted so that applicants can relate personal philosophy, preparation, and abilities in greater depth than the usual written confidential papers provide? 3. What kinds of questions are asked the candidate which lead to information needed in making decisions for employment of teachers? 4. <b>How</b> <b>confident</b> <b>do</b> personnel administrators feel when making judgments concerning the employment of potential teacher candidates?A questionnaire was developed to obtain information on the processes and techniques used by personnel administrators when interviewing teacher candidates. The study waslimited to school corporations having an administrator who spends half time or more in supervision and administering the personnel programs. The study was further limited tosixteen school corporations identified by Dr. Robert Cowan in his 1967 "Study of Personnel Administrators in Selected Indiana School Corporations. "Questionnaire results from the sixteen selected personnel administrators were recorded in table form. Review of data led to the following conclusions:The initial teacher candidate interviews, in selected Indiana school corporations, were conducted by administrators with experience in supervising the personnel program. Personnel administrators generally spend at least thirty minutes in the initial teacher candidate interview. In addition, the optimum upper limit on the number of teacher candidates to be interviewed in succession would appear to be no more than four candidates. Personnel administrators indicated that the interviewee should do most of the talking during the initial teacher candidate interview. In an effort to achieve this objective, most administrators use a warm and friendly approach during the interview. Even if the interviewer is successful in putting the candidate at ease during the interview, no real depth of conversation can be achieved unless the setting allows freedom from outside interruptions. The director of personnel should be able to ask questions of the interviewee which reveal answers to questions that the applicant might not reveal in any other manner. More specifically, questions which solicit narrative answers would appear to be an effective method for obtaining information necessary to make intelligent employment decisions. Personnel administrators appear to be, at least moderately confident concerning personal ability to assess selected indicators of teacher competency. However, the administrators place greatest confidence in personal ability to judge personality, sense of humor, friendliness, enthusiasm, poise, and self-confidence. Thesis (Ed. S. ...|$|R
