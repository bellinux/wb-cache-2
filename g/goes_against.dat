5|$|Peribsen's name is unusual, in that Set, not Horus, was {{his patron}} deity. This <b>goes</b> <b>against</b> the Egyptian {{tradition}} {{of a king}} choosing the falcon-shaped deity Horus as his royal patron.|$|E
5|$|In 1924, Kartodikromo {{published}} Rasa Merdika (A Sense of Independence), which {{dealt with}} {{a young man who}} <b>goes</b> <b>against</b> his priyayi father, a tool of the Dutch colonial government, and tries to find personal independence. Another novel, Cermin Buah Keroyalan (Mirror of the Fruit of Royalty), and stage play, Kromo Bergerak (Kromo is Moving), were published not long after.|$|E
5|$|In {{more recent}} years, the {{original}} Piagetian object permanence account {{has been challenged}} {{by a series of}} infant studies suggesting that much younger infants do have a clear sense that objects exist even when out of sight. Bower showed object permanence in 3-month-olds. This <b>goes</b> <b>against</b> Piaget's coordination of secondary circular reactions stage because infants aren't supposed to understand that a completely hidden object still exists until they are eight to twelve months old. The two studies below demonstrate this idea.|$|E

5|$|Even {{before the}} election, {{tensions}} grew between the French and British delegations, already in Singapore. The Paris bid team considered submitting {{a complaint against}} London bid consultants Jim Sloman and Rod Sheard after they stated that the Stade de France was not adequate for athletics, an action that <b>goes</b> <b>against</b> the IOC rules which forbid any bid to make statements about a rival bid. The London team promptly denied {{that the two men}} were under contract with the bid at that time, and underlined that their opinions did not reflect the views of the London bid.|$|E
5|$|In 1931, 9.4% of Wigan's {{population}} was middle class compared with 14% in England and Wales, and by 1971, this had increased to 12.4% compared with 24% nationally. Parallel to this {{slight increase in}} the middle classes of Wigan was {{the decline of the}} working class population. In 1931, 38.7% were working class compared with 36% in England and Wales; by 1971, this had decreased to 33.5% in Wigan and 26% nationwide. The rest of the {{population was}} made up of clerical workers and skilled manual workers or other miscellaneous. The slow decrease in the working class <b>goes</b> <b>against</b> the trend for a steeper national decline, reinforcing the perception of Wigan as a working-class town.|$|E
5|$|Toriyama enjoyed {{designing}} and drawing the distinctive machines of the series. He finds {{the most fun}} in designing original mecha, thinking about how a pilot enters and where the engine is. With real world items {{he would have to}} look at references, and being off even a little would be noticeable. He <b>goes</b> <b>against</b> whatever is popular at the time, explaining that when he was creating Dragon Ball, most cars were very square, so he drew only round car designs. He drew square ones later on when cars in reality started to become sleek and aerodynamic.|$|E

5|$|Evidence for a virus {{as a cause}} {{include the}} {{presence}} of oligoclonal bands {{in the brain and}} cerebrospinal fluid of most people with MS, the association of several viruses with human demyelination encephalomyelitis, and the occurrence of demyelination in animals caused by some viral infections. Human herpes viruses are a candidate group of viruses. Individuals having never been infected by the Epstein–Barr virus are at a reduced risk of getting MS, whereas those infected as young adults are at a greater risk than those having had it at a younger age. Although some consider that this <b>goes</b> <b>against</b> the hygiene hypothesis, since the non-infected have probably experienced a more hygienic upbringing, others believe that there is no contradiction, since it is a first encounter with the causative virus relatively late in life that is the trigger for the disease. Other diseases that may be related include measles, mumps and rubella.|$|E
5|$|During an interview, Satoh said Rurouni Kenshin {{was one of}} {{the first}} manga he read to the point he would play sword-fights with his friends. Additionally, once he was cast as Kenshin, Satoh started intense swordsmanship training. Satoh said he liked Kenshin's {{character}} to the point of enjoying role in the three films. However, the actor expressed pressure in doing the role as a result of having to take part in multiple fighting scenes. Nevertheless, Satoh said he enjoyed Kenshin's lines due to the impact they have on most characters, most notably his enemies. Due to the Kyoto films showing a darker characterization of Kenshin as he struggles against different strong rivals, Satoh also said his work became more challenging. Still, he found it interesting. A scene that Satoh enjoyed was Kenshin's fight against Sawagejō Chō due to the fact Kenshin is forced to attack his enemy even though he does not know his weapon is deadly which <b>goes</b> <b>against</b> his morals; as a result, Satoh briefly showed Kenshin's hitokiri side for a brief moment. The actor said he discussed this scene with the director who pleased with the result. Kenshin's strongest technique, the Amakakeru Ryū no Hirameki, was Satoh's favorite move as he likes its meaning. While Kenshin shouts his attacks' names in both manga and anime, Satoh instead decided to say the names after performing those moves.|$|E

However, the North has also been the traditional seat of the Portuguese nobility.|$|R

25|$|Shan shui {{painting}} {{is a kind}} of painting which <b>goes</b> <b>against</b> the common definition of what a {{painting is}}. Shan shui painting refutes color, light and shadow and personal brush work. Shan shui painting is not an open window for the viewer's eye, it is an object for the viewer's mind. Shan shui painting is more like a vehicle of philosophy.|$|E
25|$|The hymn {{was one of}} the exclamations of {{the fathers}} at the Council of Chalcedon (451), and is common not only to all the Greek Oriental liturgies, but was used also in the Gallican Liturgy (see Saint Germain of Paris, d. 576), which shows that the hymn is ancient. Some believe it is {{extremely}} ancient perhaps of apostolic-era origin. However this <b>goes</b> <b>against</b> the Tradition in regards to the hymn.|$|E

25|$|The {{method of}} {{tenacity}} (policy of sticking to initial belief) — which brings comforts and decisiveness but leads {{to trying to}} ignore contrary information and others' views as if truth were intrinsically private, not public. The method <b>goes</b> <b>against</b> the social impulse and easily falters since one may well notice when another's opinion seems as good as one's own initial opinion. Its successes can be brilliant but tend to be transitory.|$|E

25|$|While {{the main}} intent of DRM {{is to prevent}} {{unauthorized}} copies of a product, there are mathematical models that suggest that DRM schemes can fail {{to do their job}} on multiple levels. Ironically, the biggest failure that can result from DRM is that they have a potential to increase the infringement rate of a product. This <b>goes</b> <b>against</b> the held belief that DRM can always reduce unauthorized distribution. There also seems to be evidence that DRM will reduce profits.|$|E
