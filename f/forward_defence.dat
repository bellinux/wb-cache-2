5|$|Late Roman {{emperors}} continued {{major and}} frequent offensive operations beyond the imperial borders throughout the 4th century. These were strikingly {{similar to the}} pincer movements described by Luttwak as being characteristic of <b>forward</b> <b>defence</b> in the early Principate. For example, Valentinian I's campaign against the Quadi in 375. Julian in 356–60 and Valentinian I in 368–74 carried out several operations across the Rhine and Danube designed to force the submission of local tribes and their acceptance of tributarii status.|$|E
5|$|According to Luttwak, the <b>forward</b> <b>defence</b> {{system was}} always {{vulnerable}} to unusually large barbarian concentrations of forces, as the Roman army was too thinly spread along the enormous borders {{to deal with}} such threats. In addition, the lack of any reserves {{to the rear of the}} border entailed that a barbarian force that successfully penetrated the perimeter defences would have unchallenged ability to rampage deep into the empire before Roman reinforcements from other border garrisons could arrive to intercept them.|$|E
5|$|The {{essential}} {{feature of}} defence-in-depth, according to Luttwak, was an acceptance that the Roman frontier provinces themselves {{would become the}} main combat-zone in operations against barbarian threats, rather than the barbarian lands across the border. Under this strategy, border-forces (limitanei) would not attempt to repel a large incursion. Instead, they would retreat into fortified strongholds and wait for mobile forces (comitatenses) to arrive and intercept the invaders. Border-forces would be substantially weaker than under <b>forward</b> <b>defence,</b> but their reduction in numbers (and quality) would be compensated by the establishment of much stronger fortifications to protect themselves.|$|E
50|$|Over {{the course}} of time, the {{fortification}} systems were improved. The outer walls of the defenses were faced with stone blocks, the moat was broadened and <b>forward</b> <b>defences</b> were added {{in front of the}} rampart.|$|R

5|$|Until the 1970s, Australia's {{military}} strategy centred {{on the concept}} of <b>Forward</b> <b>Defence,</b> in which the role of Australian military and naval forces were to co-operate with Allied forces to counter threats in Australia's region. Following the adoption of the Guam Doctrine by the United States in 1969, and the British withdrawal 'east of Suez' in the early 1970s, Australia developed a defence policy emphasising self-reliance and the defence of the Australian continent. Known as the Defence of Australia Policy, it focused Australian defence planning on protecting the nation's northern maritime approaches (the 'air-sea gap') against possible attack.|$|E
5|$|The Luftwaffes {{target was}} the Marfee heights which lay behind Sedan {{to the south}} east. They {{contained}} the fortified artillery positions and dominated the approaches to the strategic and operational depths beyond Sedan and the Meuse. The Luftwaffe was two hours late in appearing but the effort made was considerable. The attacks were made in Gruppe (group) strength and against the line of maximum resistance along the enemy gun line. To restrict enemy movements and communications, German fighters swept the area to cut land-lines and strafe fortifications, with some shooting of radio antennae off command posts. The attacks isolated the <b>forward</b> <b>defence</b> lines. Sturzkampfgeschwader 77 struck first {{in the morning of}} 13 May. In just five hours, 500 Ju 87 sorties had been flown.|$|E
5|$|With the {{withdrawal}} of the battalion serving in Singapore as part of the Far East Strategic Reserve, 1973 finally saw all units of the regiment stationed in Australia for the first time. Thus began a period of peace-time soldiering of a sort not before seen in the regiment. The end of National Service significantly diminished the strength of the Army, and at this time the government directed that the number of battalions in the regiment be reduced to six, which was achieved by linking 2 and 4 RAR, 5 and 7 RAR, and 8 and 9 RAR. The strength of units and resources were also reduced, with a shift in strategic and tactical concepts from <b>forward</b> <b>defence</b> to defence of continental Australia. Regardless, from September 1973 the battalions of the regiment provided a company on three monthly rotations to Rifle Company Butterworth in Malaysia as part of the Five Power Defence Arrangements. Meanwhile, the 10th Independent Rifle Company, Royal Australian Regiment (10 IRC) was raised on 23 May 1974 to provide an opposing force for units training at the Jungle Training Centre at Canungra.|$|E
25|$|Peter Wykeham {{suggested}} that the government in London was more to blame {{than any of the}} British commanders in the Far East. Despite repeated requests, the British government did not provide the necessary reinforcements and they denied Brooke-Popham – and therefore Percival – permission to enter neutral Thailand before {{it was too late to}} put in place <b>forward</b> <b>defences.</b>|$|R

During clashes in the <b>Forward</b> <b>Defence</b> Lines, separating their forces, both sides exchange heavy artillery fire, after which military incursions follow. By December 22, 2007 the LTTE defences at Uyilankulama and Thampanai were lost to advancing troops of the Sri Lanka Army. On December 29, 2007 the Army overran the LTTE stronghold at Parappakandal, Mannar.|$|E

25|$|Fierce {{fighting}} erupted {{between the}} LTTE and the SLA {{at the final}} <b>forward</b> <b>defence</b> line (FDL) of LTTE, at their Beirut complex in Narakamulla, Thoppigala area between 22–24 June 2007. The FDL was fortified with 6 bunker lines and 3 minor camps. The LTTE did not vacate their positions due to SLA's heavy barrage of artillery and tank gun fire. Finally, around 50 SLA commando's infiltrated the LTTE bunkers and killed 30 of them. Three LTTE cadres committed suicide. This series of events turned the tide {{of the battle of}} Thoppogala against the LTTE.|$|E

25|$|By October, the British {{forces on}} the island of Leros {{numbered}} ca. 3,000 men of the 2nd Bn The Royal Irish Fusiliers, (under Lt Col Maurice French), the 4th Bn The Buffs (The Royal East Kent Regiment) (Lt Col Douglas Iggulden), the 1st Bn The King's Own Royal Regiment (Lancaster), and a company of the 2nd Bn Queen's Own Royal West Kent Regiment, the whole force under Brigadier Robert Tilney, who assumed command on 5 November. Initially, the British had planned to secure the high ground of the island's interior, but Brig Tilney insisted on a <b>forward</b> <b>defence</b> on the coastline, which had the effect of spreading his forces too thinly.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the end of}} the war, it was {{proposed}} in 1924 that Coalhouse Fort should be re-equipped with 4-inch guns but post-war defence cuts meant that this plan was abandoned. Instead, the fort was reduced to care and maintenance status and East Tilbury Battery was decommissioned in 1930. The continuing development of artillery firepower meant that the forts and batteries further downriver took on an increased responsibility for the <b>forward</b> <b>defences</b> of the Thames. The forts on Gravesend Reach were relegated to a second line of defence.|$|R
50|$|The Orašje pocket was {{defended by}} the 6,000-strong HVO Orašje Corps, {{consisting}} of one guards brigade and three Home Guard regiments. Overall {{command of the}} corps was held by Staff Brigadier Đuro Matuzović. The defences lacked depth, and did not exceed 10 km. To offset this, the HVO had prepared strong <b>forward</b> <b>defences,</b> including trenches and bunkers, built along the 18 km front line. The HVO positions were supported by HV artillery and multiple rocket launchers deployed north of the Sava River, in Croatia.|$|R
25|$|Unmanned Predator {{aircraft}} fired Hellfire missiles into Sadr City {{every day}} targeting the mortar and rocket teams. The fighting mostly stopped early on April 11, as U.S. and Iraqi forces managed to advance {{down the main}} road through Sadr City {{and set up a}} <b>forward</b> <b>defence</b> line inside the district. However, that night fighting continued when U.S. and Iraqi units were attacked with small-arms, machine guns and RPGs from high-rise buildings in Sadr City. Snipers and roadside bombs were also used against a Coalition convoy transporting concrete barriers for use in constructing an Iraqi Army checkpoint. The U.S. military claimed it killed at least 13 Madhi Army militiamen in three separate engagements following the attacks on its forces.|$|E
25|$|A further {{powerful}} {{objection to}} defence-in-depth {{is that it}} is clear from Ammianus that Rome continued major offensive operations across the imperial borders in the fourth century. These were strikingly similar to the pincer movements described by Luttwak as being characteristic of <b>forward</b> <b>defence</b> in the early Principate. For example, Valentinian I's campaign against the Quadi in 375. The barbarian tribe that were the target of the operation rarely resisted the Romans in pitched battle and more often took refuge in forests and hills. The Romans would then systematically ravage their crops and burn their hamlets until starvation forced the barbarians to surrender. They would then be forced to conclude treaties of alliance with the Romans, often involving the client status described below. But there was no aspect of this activity that was peculiar to the fourth century.|$|E
25|$|The {{fortified}} {{position of}} Liège was established following World War I by Belgium {{to block the}} traditional invasion corridor from Germany through Belgium to France. The Belgian experience of World War I, in which the Belgian Army held up the invading force for a week at Liège, impeding the German timetable for the conquest of France, caused Belgium to consider a refined defence strategy. Belgium upgraded the existing fortifications of Liège and extended them onto the Herve plateau closer to Germany, using the most advanced fortifications available to Belgian military technology. However, in 1936, Belgium's neutrality was proclaimed by King Leopold III of Belgium in a vain attempt to forestall another conflict, preventing France {{from being able to}} make active use of the Belgian defences and territory in the <b>forward</b> <b>defence</b> of France. At the outbreak of World War II, Belgium's defences had to resist alone until France could advance into Belgium after neutrality failed. Again the fortifications could not hold the Germans.|$|E
50|$|Ronald Easterbrook always {{maintained}} that his arrest {{had been a}} set up between the police and a police informant, later named as Seamus Rae. Easterbrook also believed {{that the police had}} operated a shoot-to-kill policy. Easterbrook maintains that robber Tony Ash had been trying to give himself up when he was shot dead. Easterbrook's solicitor had refused to put <b>forward</b> this <b>defence</b> because it was deemed too political. Easterbrook believed that since he {{had not been able to}} put <b>forward</b> this <b>defence</b> and did not have legal counsel, he had not received a fair trial.|$|R
25|$|The Soviet {{victory in}} the Korsun-Shevchenkovsky Offensive marked the {{successful}} implementation of Soviet deep operations. Soviet Deep Battle doctrine envisaged {{the breaking of the}} enemy's <b>forward</b> <b>defences</b> to allow fresh operational reserves to exploit the breakthrough by driving into the strategic depth of the enemy front. The arrival of large numbers of U.S. and British built trucks and halftracks gave the Soviet forces much greater mobility than they had in the earlier portion of the war. This, coupled with the Soviet capacity to hold large formations in reserve gave the Red Army the ability to drive deep behind German defenses again and again.|$|R

500|$|The June 1687 Raid on the Medway by the Dutch fleet {{during the}} Second Anglo-Dutch War exposed the {{weaknesses}} of the Thames defences. It took another hundred years for the defences on Gravesend Reach to be improved, {{in the form of}} new works at Gravesend and Tilbury built in the 1780s, but even then the potential of <b>forward</b> <b>defence</b> – to prevent enemies accessing the lower Thames – continued to be neglected. It was not until the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars that the need for effective <b>forward</b> <b>defence</b> was addressed. Lieutenant Colonel Hartcup of the Royal Engineers carried out a survey of the Thames in 1794 in which he recommended building a triangle of artillery batteries to guard the entrance to Gravesend Reach and the next reach of the river, Lower Hope Reach. Two of the batteries would be located on the south bank at Shornemead, about [...] north-west of Higham; at Lower Hope Point, about [...] north-west of Cliffe; and on the north bank at East Tilbury, about [...] north of the old Henrician blockhouse. The batteries would have a maximum range of about [...] and their arcs of fire would overlap, enabling them to support each other.|$|E
500|$|The {{question}} arises {{as to why}} the 4th-century army needed forts with enhanced defensive features whereas the 2nd-century army apparently did not. Luttwak argues that defensible forts were an integral feature of a 4th-century defence-in-depth [...] "grand strategy", while in the 2nd century [...] "preclusive defence" [...] rendered such forts unnecessary [...] But the existence of such a [...] "strategy" [...] is strongly disputed by several scholars, as many elements of the late Roman army's posture were consistent with continued <b>forward</b> <b>defence.</b> An alternative explanation is that preclusive defence was still in effect but was not working as well as previously and barbarian raids were penetrating the empire more frequently.(see Strategy, below) ...|$|E
500|$|McCauley instigated the {{redevelopment}} of RAAF Base Darwin in the Northern Territory {{as the first}} stage of a <b>forward</b> <b>defence</b> strategy. He aimed to make Darwin the [...] "main Australian base for war" [...] and a launching point for deployments to Southeast Asia, rather than simply a transit station. Over the next ten years, No. 5 Airfield Construction Squadron transformed the base's runways, buildings and other infrastructure into a modern facility capable of handling major operations. This concept was taken another step by McCauley's successor as CAS, Air Marshal Scherger, who conceived a series of front-line [...] "bare bases" [...] across Northern Australia, beginning with plans for RAAF Base Tindal in 1959. Alan Stephens later described McCauley and Scherger as [...] "among the RAAF's better chiefs".|$|E
500|$|The {{second phase}} would follow immediately. While the {{remaining}} four infantry brigades of the 2nd Canadian and 51st (Highland) divisions cleared up the isolated German <b>forward</b> <b>defences</b> and the 3rd Canadian and 49th (West Riding) divisions from I Corps began subsidiary attacks to widen the base of salient captured in the first phase, the 4th Canadian Armoured Division and 1st Polish Armoured Division would move up the corridor to Cramesnil and prepare to advance further south. To prepare for their attack, bombers of the US Eighth Air Force would bombard the German reserve positions at Hautmesnil. The ultimate objective was the high ground north of Falaise, [...] beyond the start line.|$|R

Prince Muhammad participated in fights during the formation years of the Kingdom with his older brothers and cousins. In 1934, King Abdulaziz ordered his forces to attack Yemen's <b>forward</b> <b>defences.</b> Then, Faisal bin Sa'd, the son of the Saudi king's brother Saad, advanced to Baqem and the son of his other brother Mohammed, Khaled bin Muhammed, advanced to Najran and Saada. King's son Prince Faisal assumed command of the forces on the coast of Tihama and Mohammed bin Abdulaziz had advanced from Najd {{at the head of a}} reserve force to support his brother Saud.|$|R
50|$|Purdy's men spent {{a miserable}} night marching through swampy woods in pouring rain, {{becoming}} quite lost. As dawn broke on 26 October, they located the correct trail, but inexperienced or unwilling guides first led them about mid-morning {{to a point}} on the river opposite de Salaberry's <b>forward</b> <b>defences.</b> Some time after noon, Purdy's brigade encountered the detachment de Salaberry had posted to guard the ford. Captain Daly, leading the light company of the 3rd Select Embodied Militia, launched an immediate attack against the Americans, while other Canadian troops engaged them from across the river. Captain Daly and Captain Brugière were severely wounded but the Americans were driven back.|$|R
