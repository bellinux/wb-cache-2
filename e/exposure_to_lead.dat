5|$|In most cases, lead {{poisoning}} is preventable by avoiding <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> <b>lead.</b> Prevention strategies {{can be divided}} into individual (measures taken by a family), preventive medicine (identifying and intervening with high-risk individuals), and public health (reducing risk on a population level).|$|E
5|$|Symptoms of lead {{poisoning}} include nephropathy, colic-like abdominal pains, and possibly {{weakness in the}} fingers, wrists, or ankles. Small blood pressure increases, particularly in middle-aged and older people, may be apparent and can cause anemia. Several studies, mostly cross-sectional, found an association between increased lead exposure and decreased heart rate variability. In pregnant women, high levels of <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> <b>lead</b> may cause miscarriage. Chronic, high-level exposure {{has been shown to}} reduce fertility in males.|$|E
5|$|<b>Exposure</b> <b>to</b> <b>lead</b> {{also can}} be {{evaluated}} by measuring erythrocyte protoporphyrin (EP) in blood samples. EP {{is a part of}} red blood cells known to increase when the amount of lead in the blood is high, with a delay of a few weeks. Thus EP levels in conjunction with blood lead levels can suggest the time period of exposure; if blood lead levels are high but EP is still normal, this finding suggests exposure was recent. However, the EP level alone is not sensitive enough to identify elevated blood lead levels below about 35μg/dL. Due to this higher threshold for detection and the fact that EP levels also increase in iron deficiency, use of this method for detecting lead exposure has decreased.|$|E
50|$|The {{developing}} {{nervous system}} of the fetus is particularly vulnerable <b>to</b> <b>lead</b> toxicity. Neurological toxicity is observed in children of exposed women {{as a result of}} the ability of <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> cross the placental barrier. A special concern for pregnant women is that some of the bone lead accumulation is released into the blood during pregnancy. Several studies have provided evidence that even low maternal <b>exposures</b> <b>to</b> <b>lead</b> produce intellectual and behavioral deficits in children.|$|R

5000|$|Various {{regulatory}} bodies refer to styrene, in various contexts, {{as a possible}} or potential human carcinogen. The International Agency for Research on Cancer considers styrene to be [...] "possibly carcinogenic to humans". [...] Chronic <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> styrene <b>leads</b> <b>to</b> tiredness/lethargy, memory deficits, headaches and vertigo.|$|R
5|$|<b>Exposure</b> <b>to</b> <b>lead</b> {{can occur}} by {{contaminated}} air, water, dust, food, or consumer products. Children are {{at greater risk}} as {{they are more likely to}} put objects in their mouth such as those that contain lead paint and absorb a greater proportion of the lead that they eat. Exposure at work is a common cause of lead poisoning in adults with certain occupations at particular risk. Diagnosis is typically by measurement of the blood lead level. The Centers for Disease Control (US) has set the upper limit for blood lead for adults at 10µg/dl (10µg/100 g) and for children at 5µg/dl. Elevated lead may also be detected by changes in red blood cells or dense lines in the bones of children as seen on X-ray.|$|E
5|$|<b>Exposure</b> <b>to</b> <b>lead</b> {{may also}} {{decrease}} lifespan and have health {{effects in the}} long term. Death rates {{from a variety of}} causes {{have been found to be}} higher in people with elevated blood lead levels; these include cancer, stroke, and heart disease, and general death rates from all causes. Lead is considered a possible human carcinogen based on evidence from animal studies. Evidence also suggests that age-related mental decline and psychiatric symptoms are correlated with lead exposure. Cumulative exposure over a prolonged period may have a more important effect on some aspects of health than recent exposure. Some health effects, such as high blood pressure, are only significant risks when lead exposure is prolonged (over about one year).|$|E
5|$|In adults, {{occupational}} exposure {{is the main}} cause of lead poisoning. People can be exposed when working in facilities that produce a variety of lead-containing products; these include radiation shields, ammunition, certain surgical equipment, developing dental x-ray films prior to digital x-rays (each film packet had a lead liner to prevent the radiation from going through), fetal monitors, plumbing, circuit boards, jet engines, and ceramic glazes. In addition, lead miners and smelters, plumbers and fitters, auto mechanics, glass manufacturers, construction workers, battery manufacturers and recyclers, firing range instructors, and plastic manufacturers are at risk for lead exposure. Other occupations that present lead exposure risks include welding, manufacture of rubber, printing, zinc and copper smelting, processing of ore, combustion of solid waste, and production of paints and pigments. Parents who are exposed to lead in the workplace can bring lead dust home on clothes or skin and expose their children. Occupational <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> <b>lead</b> increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, in particular: stroke, and high blood pressure.|$|E

40|$|Two neurochemically {{distinct}} {{forms of}} stress-induced analgesia {{were examined in}} adult rats following prenatal ethanol exposure. Rats were exposed to ethanol during the last 2 weeks of gestation through a liquid diet presented to the dams. Analgesia testing was conducted when the offspring were 150 – 210 days of age. Two forms of footshock stress were administered; one {{that resulted in a}} naloxone-sensitive (opioid-mediated) analgesia and one that resulted in a naloxone-insensitive (nonopioid) form of analgesia. Rats prenatally exposed to ethanol demonstrated significantly enhanced opioid-mediated analgesia, but unaltered nonpoioid analgesia compared to controls. These results confirm previous findings that prenatal <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> ethanol <b>leads</b> <b>to</b> long-term alterations in responding to some, but not all forms of stress. The possibility that prenatal <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> ethanol <b>leads</b> <b>to</b> perturbations in the endogenous opioid systems is discussed...|$|R

25|$|Lead poisoning* is {{uncommon}} in dogs. <b>Exposure</b> <b>to</b> <b>lead</b> is from eating paint chips from lead-based paint (found in houses painted prior to 1950), and eating lead {{objects such as}} shot, fishing sinkers, or counterweights. Signs of poisoning include vomiting, diarrhea, blindness, seizures, and tremors.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1990s an {{extensive}} government funded Lead Education program was established {{and people with}} children under 5 were able to have free lead testing of their children, homes and gardens to assess lead contamination levels. Any property that had considerably high lead levels in ceiling dust or garden soil was provided with free remediation works to reduce potential <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> <b>lead</b> dust.|$|E

25|$|Sociologists and criminologists {{have not}} reached {{consensus}} on the explanation for the dramatic decrease in the city's crime rate. Some attribute the phenomenon to new tactics used by the NYPD, including its use of CompStat and the broken windows theory. Others cite {{the end of the}} crack epidemic and demographic changes, including from immigration. Another theory is that widespread <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> <b>lead</b> pollution from automobile exhaust, which can lower intelligence and increase aggression levels, incited the initial crime wave in the mid-20th century, most acutely affecting heavily trafficked cities like New York. A strong correlation was found demonstrating that violent crime rates in New York and other big cities began to fall after lead was removed from American gasoline in the 1970s. Another theory cited to explain New York City's falling homicide rate is the inverse correlation between the number of murders and the increasingly wetter climate in the city.|$|E

500|$|Further {{evidence}} of the threat that lead posed to humans was discovered in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Mechanisms of harm were better understood, lead blindness was documented, and the element was phased out of public use in the United States and Europe. The United Kingdom introduced mandatory factory inspections in 1878 and appointed the first Medical Inspector of Factories in 1898; as a result, a 25-fold decrease in lead poisoning incidents from 1900 to 1944 was reported. The last major human <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> <b>lead</b> was the addition of tetraethyllead to gasoline as an antiknock agent, a practice that originated in the United States in 1921. [...] It was phased out in the United States and the European Union by 2000. Most European countries banned lead paint—commonly used because of its opacity and water resistance—for interiors by 1930.|$|E
2500|$|However, on his return, May {{began work}} on complex allegorical texts. He {{considered}} the [...] "question of mankind"; pacifism and the raising of humans from evil to good. Sascha Schneider provided symbolistic covers for the Fehsenfeld edition. On 22 March 1912, May was invited by the Academic Society for Literature and Music in Vienna to present a lecture entitled Empor ins Reich der Edelmenschen ("Upward to the Realm of Noble Men"). There, he met Bertha von Suttner. Karl May died one week later on 30 March 1912. According to the register of deaths, the cause was cardiac arrest, acute bronchitis and asthma but according to Ralf Harder from the Karl-May-Stiftung, May's death certificate {{does not include the}} cause of death. Scientists examining the remains of May in 2014 found excessive quantity of lead and other heavy metals, and concluded that he was probably poisoned due to a long-time <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> <b>lead</b> in water as well as tobacco.

2500|$|The Guidotti {{paper was}} called into {{question}} {{by members of the}} DC Council in February 2009, after the Washington Post ran an article about a more recent study by Marc Edwards that found a correlation between water and blood lead levels in area children. [...] The National Institutes of Health, publisher of the journal in which the paper appeared, were unaware that George Washington University's contract with WASA gave the water authority final approval over anything Guidotti wrote concerning the authority. [...] Guidotti was also supposed to remove the sentence about public health impact from the paper before publication, because experts reviewing the paper had rejected that finding; he failed to do so. [...] Guidotti and WASA both denied that the agency influenced the paper; Guidotti said he didn't view the contract as giving WASA preapproval over the paper, and therefore didn't disclose it to the journal. In an August 2006 e-mail obtained by the Post from Edwards, Guidotti agreed to replace the sentence with [...] "Measures to protect residents from <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> <b>lead</b> in drinking water may have prevented more frequent elevations in blood lead" [...] before its publication, but that did not happen. The journal refuses to accept research that is under a sponsor's control; it conducted a review to determine if the paper should be retracted—the journal's first such review in its 30-year history. The paper had been cited as evidence that the lead contamination had not harmed District residents.|$|E
