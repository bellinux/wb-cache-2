40|$|Greenroofs are roofs {{that grow}} plants” Greenroofs are roofs that grow plants. Just like {{conventional}} roofs they are waterproof – {{a series of}} membranes seal the building, keeping the weather out and the occupants dry. Unlike conventional roofs, the plants and growing media provide benefi ts, ranging from noise and energy insulation to storm-water mitigation and animal habitat – and they also look great! Th e ancestor of modern greenroofs is the thick Scandinavian and Irish turf or sod roof, once common because sod was inexpensive and readily available. Th e parents of modern greenroofs are roof gardens in which plants are grown either in irrigated containers or relatively deep beds (Fig. 1) to enhance aesthetics and provide passive recreational space. Some London Parks are greenroofs, for example, the Jubilee Gardens in Canary Wharf (Gedge and Kadas 2005). Roof gardens include New Zealand’s most famous greenroof, on <b>Kawakawa’s</b> Hundertwasser toilets (Fig. 2). Th ey are technically described as intensive greenroofs. A heavily reinforced roof supports a relatively deep substrate growing a range of plants that are not very diff erent from those found in landscaped areas. Such greenroofs require regular weeding and maintenance and are usually irrigated. Extensive greenroofs are lightweight, cover the majority of a roof, and are not usually designed to be walked on excpet during amintenance. Th eir lightness (75 to 150 kg/m 2 saturated mass) comes {{from a combination of}} a shallow (50 to 150 mm) and low density substrate – they have dry weights of 0. 5 to 0. 8 T/m 3 compared with common natural soils that weigh in at 0. 9 to 1. 3 T/m 3. Th e roofs are planted with dense, wind and drought-resistant groundcovers (< 200 mm high) and are generally not irrigated. Extensive greenroofs are therefore much cheaper than intensive greenroofs and roof gardens because additional structural support, needed to hold up the roof, is minimised and maintenance is low. Extensive greenroofs can provide the following benefi ts: • cost savings by extending the life of the underlying roof, and insulating the building. The insulation helps the building stay warmer in winter and cooler in summer (Wong et al. 2003) • sound insulation – both substrate and plants absorb sound waves • stormwater reduction – the substrate acts like a sponge to absorb, delay, and slowly release stormwater, therefor...|$|R

2500|$|Initially, the {{syndicate}} {{was disappointed}} with the government's progress, as work did not commence until March 1892 due to a shortage of labour. [...] However, by 2 July 1894, the line was opened to Waro. [...] Locals believed {{this was the first}} part of the link to <b>Kawakawa,</b> but Richard Seddon had not authorised the full project, just the extension to the Puhipuhi forest. [...] This was originally meant to terminate in Whakapara, but a further extension to Waiotu was required to provide easier access and this opened on 28 December 1898. [...] A further extension to Hukerenui was requested, but it was delayed due to the failure of the Railway Authorisation Act of 1898 to pass parliament. [...] Considerable political pressure was applied to close the gap between the <b>Kawakawa</b> and Whangarei sections as the road in between was poor and muddy, and the Railway Authorisation Act of 1899 accordingly authorised Waiotu - Hukerenui along with 8km of line south from <b>Kawakawa.</b> [...] The succeeding year's Act allowed for the construction of the remaining 24km to complete the line via Otiria.|$|E

2500|$|In 1876, a {{settlement}} with a deepwater port was proposed, and in 1881 plans of a town named [...] "Newport" [...] were published. [...] It became known as Opua and the railway from <b>Kawakawa</b> opened on 7 April 1884.

2500|$|In the tramway {{days and}} {{the first years of}} the line, the {{predominant}} traffic was coal from <b>Kawakawa</b> for export. [...] By the late 1890s coal traffic had all but disappeared and the government initially expressed a desire to remove the line. [...] Local indignation was such that instead of removing the line, it was connected to Whangarei and then the national network.|$|E
2500|$|There is {{currently}} a proposal by the Kaikohe Rau Marama Community Trust to convert the trackbed between Okaihau and Kaikohe into a walking and cycling track, much like the Otago Central Rail Trail and the Little River Rail Trail in the South Island. [...] This {{would be the first}} step in a plan to establish a rail trail through to the Bay of Islands Vintage Railway in <b>Kawakawa.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In November 1956, railcars {{replaced}} the Opua Express. [...] Unfortunately for Opua, the railcars operated {{to the other}} northern terminus of Okaihau on the Okaihau Branch, leaving Opua without any dedicated passenger trains. [...] Passengers {{had to rely on}} mixed trains, which did not connect with the railcars. [...] Nonetheless, the mixed trains lasted another two decades (longer than the railcars, which ceased operating in 1967); the last one ran between Whangarei and Opua on 18 June 1976. [...] From this time, this part was used to carry solely freight, almost all of which was output from the Moerewa Dairy Factory and Affco Meat Works to the port of Opua. [...] By the 1980s, regular freight services beyond <b>Kawakawa</b> were becoming irregular due to the decline of shipping to Opua as a result of containerisation. [...] It was last used in 1985 and leased to the Bay of Islands Vintage Railway to operate tourist passenger services from Opua to <b>Kawakawa,</b> including running down the centre of Kawakawa's main street.|$|E
2500|$|It {{was some}} time before the {{isolated}} KawakawaOpua line {{was connected to the}} rest of the national rail network. [...] There were questions over its viability, but in 1899 parliament approved a connection with the line that was progressing north from Whangarei. [...] A line 44 kilometres in length was required to link <b>Kawakawa</b> to the Whangarei section's northern railhead in Waiotu, and factors such as poor winter weather and difficulties in accessing the construction due to the relative isolation of the region at the time meant that it was not until 1911 that the rails from each end met.|$|E
2500|$|By the mid-1870s, the {{inadequacy}} of the Taumarere wharf was becoming apparent; accordingly, in 1876, plans were drawn up for a deepwater wharf and associated township named [...] "Newport", later Opua. [...] A railway was surveyed to link <b>Kawakawa</b> to Opua, and on 7 April 1884, it opened. [...] It left the original line {{not far from the}} Taumarere wharf, relegating the short section from junction to Taumarere wharf to the status of spur. [...] Both spur and wharf were made redundant by the new extension and accordingly closed the day of the opening to Opua.|$|E
2500|$|The {{first section}} of what became the North Auckland Line opened as a private {{industrial}} line on 2 March 1868 between <b>Kawakawa</b> and a wharf at Taumarere.

2500|$|On 1 March 1901, {{the line}} was opened to Hukerenui, and by 1904, the PWD was able to run trains south of <b>Kawakawa</b> for 12.8km. [...] However, a lack of {{detailed}} surveys, poor finances, unstable terrain, and the PWD being overburdened with jobs contributed to a slow rate of progress. [...] In May 1910, the 7km section from Hukerenui to Towai was able to open, and the full section was finally completed the next year. [...] It was handed over from the PWD to the New Zealand Railways Department on 13 April 1911, thus linking Whangarei to the Bay of Islands. [...] Construction had cost nearly a million dollars.|$|E
2500|$|Waipatiki Domain is {{situated}} {{at the edge of}} the village on the northern side of the valley off the beach road. [...] This is an area of regenerated native New Zealand bush. The area is fenced (to protect it against goats) and a pest control program is set up to eradicate possums. This kind of coastal bush is hard to find in Hawke's Bay these days. The forest is dominated by kahikatea (Dacrycarpus dacrydioides). Some of these are thought to be around 400 years old. Two very large trees are perhaps 600 years old. The larger tree has a circumference of 7.4 metres. The tracks through the domain lead you through impressive archways formed by the fronds of the nikau palm (Rhopalostylis sapida).

2500|$|In {{the latter}} half of the 1880s, impetus {{developed}} to link Kamo and <b>Kawakawa.</b> [...] Surveys had already been undertaken in 1879 and 1883 for a line, but both times, government disapproval blocked construction. [...] Ultimately, dispute about the fate of the Puhipuhi forest brought about the extension. [...] Logging interests wished to chop down the forest, but lacked viable transportation to Whangarei so the timber could be exported; others wished to burn the forest so the land could be used for agriculture. [...] In 1888, fires were started deliberately in the forest and it became obvious that considerable timber wealth would be lost if a railway were not built soon. [...] The local member of parliament announced the construction of a tramway on 7 August 1889, but both that year and next, the Public Works Department (PWD) rebuffed him. [...] In 1891, Whangarei interests established a syndicate to extend the line under the Railway Construction Act 1881, and their detailed offer prompted a newly elected government to act. [...] The Railway Authorisation Act of 1891 approved the extension by transferring funds from a plan to duplicate the line from central Auckland to Penrose.|$|E
