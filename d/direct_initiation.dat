To this end, we first model the dynamics of unsteady propagation of detonation using the one-dimensional compressible Euler equations with a one-step chemical reaction model and cylindrical geometrical source terms. Subsequently, we use two-dimensional compressible Euler equations with just the chemical reaction source term to directly model cylindrical detonations. The one-dimensional results suggest that there are three regimes in the <b>direct</b> <b>initiation</b> for stable detonations, that the critical energy for mildly unstable detonations is not unique, and that highly unstable detonations are not self-sustainable. These phenomena agree well with one-dimensional theories and computations available in the literature. However, our two-dimensional results indicate that one-dimensional approaches are valid only for stable detonations. In mildly and highly unstable detonations, one-dimensional approaches break down because they cannot take the effects and interactions of multidimensional instabilities into account. In fact, instabilities generated in multidimensional settings yield the formation of strong transverse waves that, on one hand, increase the risk of failure of the detonation and, on the other hand, lead to the initiation of local over-driven detonations that enhance the overall self-sustainability of the global process.

40|$|An {{analytical}} model is presented for the <b>direct</b> <b>initiation</b> of gaseous detonations by a blast wave. For stable or weakly unstable mixtures, numerical simulations of the spherical <b>direct</b> <b>initiation</b> event and local {{analysis of the}} one-dimensional unsteady reaction zone structure identify a competition between heat release, wave front curvature and unsteadiness. The primary failure mechanism {{is found to be}} unsteadiness in the induction zone arising from the deceleration of the wave front. The quasi-steady assumption is thus shown to be incorrect for <b>direct</b> <b>initiation.</b> The numerical simulations also suggest a non-uniqueness of critical energy in some cases, and the model developed here is an attempt to explain the lower critical energy only. A critical shock decay rate is determined in terms of the other fundamental dynamic parameters of the detonation wave, and hence this model {{is referred to as the}} critical decay rate (CDR) model. The local analysis is validated by integration of reaction-zone structure equations with real gas kinetics and prescribed unsteadiness.

40|$|Initiation of {{detonation}} in the cylindrical geometry {{is important}} in validating a general theory of initiation, and has particular significance to the interaction of high velocity projectiles with combustible gas. In the present study, an experimental investigation of the <b>direct</b> <b>initiation</b> of gaseous detonations by a line source of condensed explosives (detonating cord) is presented. Due to the high velocity of detonation in the condensed explosive cord (6 [...] 7 km/s), the rapid chemical energy release along its length generates a quasi-cylindrical blast wave in the surrounding combustible mixture. For a sufficiently strong detonating cord, the generated blast wave is observed to decay to a stable Chapman-Jouguet (CJ) conical detonation. Below a certain critical energy, the blast wave decays to low velocities without initiating detonation. In the critical regime of initiation, measurements of the combustion front velocity and direct flow visualization indicate that the blast wave decays to sub-CJ velocities {{before the onset of}} detonation. The onset of detonation is associated with discrete explosion centers. This phenomenon is similar to what has been previously observed for spherical initiation, suggesting a universal mechanism of detonation initiation. The critical shock radius at which the onset of detonation occurs is correlated to the detonation cell size (lambda) of the mixture, consistently yielding a radius of 4 to 8 lambda. Using the invariance of the explosion length R 0 in the critical regime of initiation for spherical and cylindrical detonations, it is shown how the critical radii and critical energies scale between the two geometries, clarifying the correct length scales that should be used in the theory of <b>direct</b> <b>initiation</b> of detonation...|$|E

In the experiment, <b>direct</b> <b>initiation</b> of detonation is achieved via a spark discharge from a high-voltage and low-inductance capacitor {{bank and the}} spark energy is estimated from {{the analysis of the}} current output. To determine the blast wave energy from the powerful spark, the time-of-arrival of the blast wave in air is measured at different radii using a piezoelectric pressure transducer. Good agreement is found in the scaled blast trajectories, i. e., scaled time c o·t/R o where c o is the ambient sound speed, as a function of blast radius R s/R o between the numerical simulation of a spherical blast wave from a point energy source and the experimental results where the explosion length scale R o is computed using the equivalent spark energy from the first 1 / 4 current discharge cycle.

Optimal binding occurred with genes having A block-B block distances of 30 - 60 base pairs; the relative helical orientation of the A and B blocks was unimportant.
