George Călinescu summarized this contrast by stating: [...] "The 'corrosives' left by Creangă are not known publicly." [...] An exception to this rule was Kirileanu's Creangă reader of 1938, published by Editura Fundațiilor Regale as the first critical edition of his entire literature. According to critic Adrian Solomon, the Romanian tradition of silencing obscene language and sexually explicit literature through censorship made [...] "The Tale of All Tales" [...] circulate [...] "rather like a samizdat", which left writers with [...] "no solid tradition to draw on, and precious little chance to evade... the vigilant morals of a straitlaced public." [...] The nationalist aspects of Ion Creangă's public discourse were however approved of and recovered by the far right of the 1920s and '30s. High-ranking Orthodox cleric Tit Simedrea referred to Creangă as a predecessor when, in 1937, he urged his congregation to refrain from purchasing merchandise sold by Jews (a measure which he believed was a practical alternative to the Jews' <b>forced</b> <b>eviction).</b> In 1939, {{as part of a}} press campaign targeting Călinescu's work, the fascist journal Porunca Vremii accused the literary historian of having exposed Creangă's biography for the sake of compromising the [...] "genial Moldavian" [...] by turning him into [...] "an unfrocked epileptic and a drunk." ...|$|E

In December 2007, the Gaddafi government stripped Toubou Libyans of their citizenship, claiming {{that they were not}} Libyans, but rather Chadians. In addition, local authorities denied Toubou people access to education and healthcare. In response, an armed group called the Toubou Front for the Salvation of Libya (TFSL) staged an uprising in November 2008 which lasted for five days and claimed 33 lives before being crushed by government security forces. Despite resistance and public condemnation, the Gaddafi regime continued its persecution of the Toubou minority in Libya. Beginning in November 2009, the government began a program of <b>forced</b> <b>eviction</b> and demolition of Toubou homes, rendering many Toubou homeless. Several dozen who protested the destruction were arrested, and families who refused to leave their homes were beaten.|$|E
2500|$|UNITED KINGDOM: India-UK {{strategic}} {{relationship is}} hugely driven by commerce & trade, shared {{history and the}} Indian diaspora in the UK. The 1.5 million British Indian diaspora, representing 1.8% of the UK population, ensures representation of Indian interests in UK politics. Continuity in India-UK relations is compelled by business imperatives and British nostalgia for a bygone era where the sun never sets. Both India and the UK are influential members of the Commonwealth of Nations. India now has more people who speak or understand English language {{than any other country}} in the world. The legacy and dynamics of a colonial past, the British Raj, acts like a double-edged sword serving both as an asset and an inconvenient reminder in bilateral relations. Historians have noted that during the British Empire, [...] "evangelical influence drove British policy down a path that tended to minimize and denigrate the accomplishments of Indian civilization and to position itself as the negation of the earlier British Indomania that was nourished by belief in Indian wisdom." [...] Broken promises by the British government on Indian independence after World War One, the creation of contentious international borders which divided peoples (Partition of Bengal) and contiguous geographies (Partition of Punjab) and the exploitative nature of British colonial policies (India's contribution to the global economy fell from around 20% to less than 4% during the British administration), are the most conspicuous legacy of British imperial rule. India maintains that the Koh-i-Noor diamond was taken away illegally from India and that artefacts which were removed during colonial times should be returned. United Kingdom's influence in Asia was severely diminished after the end of the British Raj. British military presence in the Indian Ocean suffers from the combined effect of reduced blue-water capabilities of the Royal Navy and contested sovereignty over British territories in the Indian Ocean. The Chagos Archipelago sovereignty dispute with Mauritius, revelations of deceit and ongoing investigations into human rights violations caused by the <b>forced</b> <b>eviction</b> of Chagossians from the British Indian Ocean Territory by the United Kingdom, allegations of US Government extraordinary rendition and Black Sites on Diego Garcia and historic support among Asian countries for the decolonization process; render the islands unsuitable as a commercial launch-pad into Indian Ocean trade. United Kingdom is a P5 veto-wielding permanent member of the UN Security Council (UNSC) albeit constrained by strategic subservience to the USA via the UK-US 'special relationship' and restrained by domestic politics (On 29 August 2013 a motion for military intervention in the Syrian civil war was defeated 285-272 in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom). France and Germany have eclipsed the influence of the United Kingdom within Europe (and in the USA). The peer-reviewed Historical Journal of Film, Radio and Television published a study into BBC's coverage of South Asian geopolitics and economics from 1947 through 2008 which exposed pervasive Indophobic bias.|$|E
