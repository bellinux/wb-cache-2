5|$|Officials {{recommended}} the citizens on Smith Island to evacuate {{on the day}} prior to the hurricane making landfall, the only evacuations for the Eastern shore of Maryland. Mandatory evacuations were ordered for low-lying and other specific areas in Calvert, St. Mary's, and Charles counties, and the residents in six homes were asked to leave in Howard County. Officials recommended residents in flood areas of Baltimore County to evacuate, and some {{in the city of}} Baltimore left spontaneously due to flooding. Evacuation rates were low throughout the Maryland coastline, with the highest rate being in the southernmost counties on the western shore. The primary reason for people staying was due to the track of the hurricane. Between 20% and 33% of those who participated in an evacuation survey said they had concerns about being caught on roadways while trying to evacuate as the storm arrived, with similar numbers expressing concern about being able {{to return to their homes}} if they evacuated. Of those who left, most went to the house of a <b>friend</b> <b>or</b> <b>family</b> <b>member,</b> with two-thirds to three-fourths going to destinations in their own neighborhood or county. Most did not evacuate until the day before or the day of landfall. In most areas, the public response to the evacuation orders was normal to fast, with traffic during the evacuation described as light to normal. The most significant problems experienced during the evacuation were downed trees, inadequate signage, flooded roads, or stalled cars. In all, 3,080people evacuated their homes in preparation for Hurricane Isabel. Boats, trucks, and school buses helped more than 1,000people evacuate the Inner Harbor of Baltimore, as well.|$|E

25|$|These {{individuals}} {{may be trying}} to reenact unresolved issues with their parents. A history of frequent illnesses may also {{contribute to the development of}} this disorder. In some cases, individuals afflicted with FD are accustomed to actually being sick, and thus return to their previous state to recapture what they once considered the 'norm.' Another cause is a history of close contact with someone (a <b>friend</b> <b>or</b> <b>family</b> <b>member)</b> who had a severe or chronic condition. The patients found themselves subconsciously envious of the attention said relation received, and felt that they themselves faded into the background. Thus medical attention makes them feel glamorous and special.|$|E

2500|$|Blood {{donations}} {{are divided}} into groups based on who will receive the collected blood. [...] An 'allogeneic' (also called 'homologous') donation is when a donor gives blood for storage at a blood bank for transfusion to an unknown recipient. [...] A 'directed' donation is when a person, often a family member, donates blood for transfusion to a specific individual. [...] Directed donations are relatively rare when an established supply exists. [...] A 'replacement donor' donation is a hybrid of the two and is common in developing countries such as Ghana. [...] In this case, a <b>friend</b> <b>or</b> <b>family</b> <b>member</b> of the recipient donates blood to replace the stored blood used in a transfusion, ensuring a consistent supply. [...] When a person has blood stored that will be transfused back to the donor at a later date, usually after surgery, that is called an 'autologous' donation. [...] Blood {{that is used to}} make medications can be made from allogeneic donations or from donations exclusively used for manufacturing.|$|E

In some areas, the addict who is celebrating a [...] "clean anniversary" [...] will be able to have support group members read the readings for the meeting and he or she will have a speaker carry the NA message. Then the addict celebrating will have his or her sponsor or a <b>friend</b> <b>or</b> <b>family</b> <b>member,</b> give them a medallion at which time the friend will share some of the celebrating addict's achievements during the last year, or from during the entire course of his or her recovery. Then the addict celebrating can share his or her experience, strength, and hope with the group on how they did it.|$|E
2500|$|Next, Dawkins {{questions}} whether the Bible really does provide a suitable moral framework, and {{contends that the}} texts are of dubious origin and veracity, are internally contradictory and, examined closely, describe a system of morals that any civilised person should find poisonous. He describes the Old Testament as the root of Judaism, Christianity and Islam; and, as example, readings are given of Deuteronomy 13 which instructs believers to kill any <b>friend</b> <b>or</b> <b>family</b> <b>member</b> who favours serving other gods, and Numbers 31 where Moses, angered at the mercy his victorious forces show in taking women and children captive, instructs them to kill all save virgin girls, who are to be taken as slaves: an act Dawkins describes as genocide. Dawkins also questions another story from Genesis 19 in which Lot, an old man, offers his maiden daughter out to an angry mob of [...] "wicked men" [...] to be raped and humiliated to save his male guests (Angels sent from God) from being raped by the [...] "wicked men". In Dawkins's opinion, the Old Testament God must be [...] "the most unpleasant character in all fiction".|$|E
