40|$|The Indian Ocean tsunami of December, 2004 {{was one of}} {{the most}} severe natural {{disasters}} in human history and resulted in extensive relocation by people living in damaged areas. We describe post-tsunami geographic mobility in the provinces of Aceh and North Sumatra in Indonesia, the area worst-affected by the tsunami. Data from a unique longitudinal survey of 10, 000 households who were interviewed both before and after the tsunami are used to quantify and map various dimensions of mobility and to provide insights into the individual, household and contextual factors that influence mobility. Levels of mobility increased dramatically with the extent of tsunami damage. Displacement from heavily damaged areas occurred primarily beyond the community of origin. Results from multivariate statistical models indicate that in damaged areas individuals were <b>displaced</b> <b>similarly</b> across demographic and socioeconomic lines, and that semi-voluntary decisions about mobility were influenced by household assets and prior livelihood strategies...|$|E
40|$|The {{attachment}} of rhinoviruses to cellular receptors was {{studied by}} displacing bound virus particles with an anti-receptor monoclonal antibody. The two serotypes studied differed significantly {{with respect to}} the temperature dependence of displacement {{and the nature of the}} particles displaced. Binding was shown to be a two-step process, the first of which is reversible and is seen when viruses are bound either to isolated cell membranes or to cells at lower than physiological temperatures. Second-stage binding was seen with serotype 14 when bound to intact cells. Viral particles released from such cells by incubation at 37 degrees C or by anti-receptor antibody exhibited altered physical changes in the capsid and a loss of infectivity. In contrast, serotype 67 bound efficiently to cells at 37 degrees C and did not elute spontaneously but could be displaced by anti-receptor antibody to produce complete, infectious particles. Rhinoviruses labeled with [3 H]myristic acid or with [35 S]methionine were <b>displaced</b> <b>similarly</b> from cells or membranes by anti-receptor antibody, indicating that the majority of VP 4 of rhinoviruses does not enter or remain attached to cells during either the first or second stage of virus binding.

40|$|The CC {{chemokine}} ligand 18 (CCL 18) {{was first}} {{identified as a}} chemoattractant for na&# 239;ve T cells. It {{has been reported to}} recruit T and B lymphocytes, and we show here, Natural killer (NK) cells, but with low efficacy. Investigation of its ability to elicit G-protein coupled signaling showed that it does not involve extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation, and it is not able to induce receptor internalization, as assessed on CCR 3. CCL 18 has recently been reported to possess activities unrelated to cellular recruitment, but it had no effect on T lymphocyte proliferation. We postulated that a more potent chemoattractant may be produced under inflammatory conditions but only minor truncations were observed, with the major form being the full-length protein. In view of the lack of potent immunomodulatory properties, we wondered if binding to CCL 18 by the tick chemokine binding proteins (CkBPs) Evasin- 1 and Evasin- 4 was an artifact of the methods used, but complex formation was confirmed by size exclusion chromatography, and abrogation of its binding to, and antagonism of, CCR 3. Its receptor has remained elusive since its cloning in 1997, although it has been reported to induce migration of breast cancer cells by signaling through PITPNM 3, but we show that this receptor is not expressed on lymphocytes. We have developed a radiolabelled equilibrium competition binding assay and demonstrated that it bound with high affinity to peripheral blood leukocytes (PBLs), but the binding was <b>displaced</b> <b>similarly</b> by both unlabelled CCL 18 as well as heparin.

40|$|The core {{idea behind}} detective fiction {{is to have}} the {{audience}} indentify with the sleuth. In this regard, the sleuth(s) must represent the feelings, anxieties, and morals of the reading audience. During the so-called Golden Age of detective fiction, British and American detectives try to uncover racial and political threats in order to find some semblance of order and comfort in the pessimistic post-World War I world. Principally, the British school of interwar detective fiction relies heavily on the notions of the political Other. In the traditional British tale, a gentleman amateur comes from his ivory tower (of sorts) into a chaotic world which he then puts to rights. Specifically speaking, the “cozy” British mystery of the 1920 s and 1930 s is concerned with threats to the British status quo, and these are typically political threats stemming from foreign nationals such as Wilhemite Germans, mafia-infested Italians, and Soviet Russians. In such diverse Anglophonic texts as the late Sherlock Holmes canon, Agatha Christie’s The Secret Adversary, and Ngaio Marsh’s The Nursing Home Murder, the political Other represents a foreign and a radical threat to the shaky British order of the interwar years. In the British tradition, the detective is a stabilizing agent. In the American “hard-boiled” tradition, the detective unveils the lies underlying the American myths of morality, political fairness, and cultural utopianism. Dashiell Hammett’s “Dead Yellow Women” presents an odyssey through the criminal maze that is San Francisco’s Chinatown. The Continental Op, the id of the white working class of California, navigates the cultural barriers of race in urban American only to be left utterly confounded and <b>displaced.</b> <b>Similarly,</b> Chandler’s Sam “Spanish” Delaguerra in “Spanish Blood” asserts that his upstanding and pure Spanish blood is a mechanism that allows for his honesty in a corrupt world of Filipino stick-up men, junkies, and Irish American political bosses. In both Hammett and Chandler, the issues of race and ethnic identity complicate the already hectic world of crime detection in the urban jungle, and ultimately these themes provide a counter-myth to the ideal of the Sunshine State. In short, my paper will examine the detective trope of using the detective as a mechanism for the unveiling of the threatening Other. In the British school, the Other is usually political other who seeks to destabilize the British legal, political, and cultural traditions. In the American school, the Other is a racial minority or outsider that stands as a symbol for the greater corruption of the American city. In doing this, my paper seeks to highlight the lie that detective fiction is a diversionary pursuit rather than a serious attempt to grapple with the thorny issues of race, politics, and social class...|$|E

Using hour level historical demand and weather data, we modelled wind and concentrating solar thermal (CST) at 50 % penetration across the National Electricity Market (NEM).

40|$|The {{tropical}} deforestation literature advocates multi-agent enquiry in recognition that key dynamics arise from inter-agent interactions. Studies of tropical forest-cover gain have lagged in this respect. This article explores {{the roles and}} key aspects of interactions shaping natural forest regeneration and active reforestation in Eastern Panama since 1990. It employs household surveys of agricultural landholders, interviews with community forest-restoration organisations, archival analysis of plantation reforestation interests, satellite image analysis of forest-cover change, and the consideration of State reforestation policies. Forest-cover gain reflected a convergence of interests and land-use trends amongst agents. Low social and economic costs of sustained interaction and organisation enabled extensive forest-cover gain, but low transaction costs did not. Corporate plantation reforestation rose to the fore of regional forest-cover gain via opportunistic land sales by ranchers and economic subsidies indicative of a State preference for autonomous, self-organising forest-cover gain. This reforestation follows a recent history of neoliberal frontier development in which State-backed loggers and ranchers <b>similarly</b> <b>displaced</b> agriculturalists. Community institutions, long neglected by the State, struggled to coordinate landholders and so effected far less forest-cover gain. National and international commitments to tropical forest restoration risk being similarly characterised as ineffective by a predominance of industrial plantation reforestation without greater State support for community forest management...|$|R

The 20 second to 50 second wave in the 1990 quake that developed a new east-west sub-fault was so strong that it terminated disastrously at the city of Baguio in Benguet, Cordillera.

40|$|AbstractIn Part I of this study, the Ural {{blocking}} (UB) -induced amplification role {{of winter}} warm Arctic?cold Eurasian (WACE) anomalies has been examined. It {{was found that}} the long-lived UB together with the positive North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO+) significantly contributes to the amplification of the WACE pattern. The present study examines how the UB variability affects quasi-biweekly WACE (QB-WACE) anomalies and depends on the NAO+ and North Atlantic conditions by classifying the UB based on a case study of a cold event that occurred over southern China in January 2008. A composite analysis during 1979 ? 2013 shows that the QB-WACE anomalies associated with the UB that often occur with the NAO+ are strong and influenced by the North Atlantic jet (NAJ) and zonal wind strengths over Eurasia. For NAO+-related UB, the QB-WACE anomaly depends strongly on the location of UB, and the UB anomalies lag the NAO+ by approximately 4 ? 7 days. The strength of the NAJ determines whether the combined NAO+ and UB anomalies exhibit a negative East Atlantic/West Russia (EA/WR?) pattern, while the region of weak zonal winds over Eurasia and the zonal extent of the NAJ dominate the location of UB. For southward-, eastward-, and westward-displaced UBs associated with a strong NAJ, the NAO+ favors the UB with a southward-displaced QB-WACE anomaly through wave train propagation like an EA/WR? pattern. Eastward- and southward-displaced UB anomalies induce <b>similarly</b> <b>displaced</b> cold anomalies with intrusion into southern China. However, for a northward-displaced UB, this happens without pronounced EA/WR? patterns because of a weak NAJ and is accompanied by a northward-displaced QB-WACE anomaly...|$|R
40|$|By {{combining}} high resolution, {{radiative transfer}} cosmological simulations of z~ 6 galaxies with a sub-grid multi-phase model of their interstellar medium we derive the expected intensity of several far infrared (FIR) emission lines ([C II] 158 micron, [O I] 63 micron, and [N II] 122 micron) for different {{values of the}} gas metallicity, Z. For Z = Z_sun the [C II] spectrum is very complex due {{to the presence of}} several emitting clumps of individual size < 3 kpc; the peak is displaced from the galaxy center by ~ 100 km/s. While the [O I] spectrum is also <b>similarly</b> <b>displaced,</b> the [N II] line comes predominantly from the central ionized regions of the galaxy. When integrated over ~ 500 km/s, the [C II] line flux is 185 mJy km/s; 95 % of such flux originates from the cold (T~ 250 K) H I phase, and only 5 % from the warm (T~ 5000 K) neutral medium. The [O I] and [N II] fluxes are ~ 6 and ~ 90 times lower than the [C II] one, respectively. By comparing our results with observations of Himiko, the most extended and luminous Lyman Alpha Emitter (LAE) at z = 6. 6, we find that the gas metallicity in this source must be sub-solar. We conclude that the [C II] line from z~ 6 galaxies is detectable by the ALMA full array in 1. 9 < t_ON < 7. 7 hr observing time, depending on Z.

5000|$|Voyager's {{observations}} {{revealed that}} Uranus's magnetic field is peculiar, both {{because it does}} not originate from its geometric centre, and because it is tilted at 59° from the axis of rotation. In fact the magnetic dipole is shifted from the Uranus's centre towards the south rotational pole by as much as one third of the planetary radius. This unusual geometry results in a highly asymmetric magnetosphere, where the magnetic field strength on the surface in the southern hemisphere can be as low as 0.1 gauss (10 µT), whereas in the northern hemisphere it can be as high as 1.1 gauss (110 µT). The average field at the surface is 0.23 gauss (23 µT). Studies of Voyager 2 data in 2017 suggest that this asymmetry causes Uranus's magnetosphere to connect with the solar wind once a Uranian day, opening the planet to the Sun's particles. In comparison, the magnetic field of Earth is roughly as strong at either pole, and its [...] "magnetic equator" [...] is roughly parallel with its geographical equator. The dipole moment of Uranus is 50 times that of Earth. Neptune has a <b>similarly</b> <b>displaced</b> and tilted magnetic field, suggesting that this may be a common feature of ice giants. One hypothesis is that, unlike the magnetic fields of the terrestrial and gas giants, which are generated within their cores, the ice giants' magnetic fields are generated by motion at relatively shallow depths, for instance, in the water-ammonia ocean. Another possible explanation for the magnetosphere's alignment is that there are oceans of liquid diamond in Uranus's interior that would deter the magnetic field.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{purpose of}} this study was to obtain new details of {{three-dimensional}} left ventricular wall motion related to ventricular remodeling in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. METHODS: Cardiac-gated, phase-contrast measurements using navigator-gated, high temporal resolution, tissue phase mapping were obtained on 19 patients (66 ± 7 years old) before and after CABG. Left ventricular motion patterns and myocardial velocities were recorded for radial, circumferential and longitudinal motion. Radial, circumferential and longitudinal velocity curves were obtained separately for 16 ventricular segments. Ventricular torsion rate and longitudinal strain rate were also derived pre- and post-surgery. RESULTS: After CABG, there was a significant improvement in apical contraction, with an apparent paradoxical decrease in the radial inward motion of the septal segments at the left ventricular base. Despite improved ventricular contractility during systole, peak longitudinal and rotational velocities decreased or showed no significant changes. An altered pattern of rotational motion with decreased initial counter-clockwise rotation at the beginning of systole and subsequent lower amplitude of reversed motions in diastole was also noted in most left ventricular segments. Lower peak clockwise rotational velocities were recorded in the basal anteroseptal segment with relatively higher values in the rest of the basal segments. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that post-operative changes after CABG are limiting ventricular rotational and longitudinal motions, despite an increase in ventricular contractility due to revascularization. At the ventricular base, the restrained rotational motion of basal anteroseptal segment, located proximally to the right ventricular insertion, and higher rotational velocities of the rest of the segments are pushing the septum toward the right ventricle during ventricular twisting. At the ventricular apex, the restrain in rotational motion caused by post-operative adhesions is affecting all apical segments due to a much smaller left ventricular diameter at this level. The rotating apex and the apical septum are <b>similarly</b> <b>displaced</b> toward the right ventricle during ventricular twisting...|$|R

N-terminal fragments of the type 1 receptor were expressed with and without the S 1 splice site; its removal had no effect on [(3) H]IP(3) binding to the 1 - 604 protein, but abolished binding to the 224 - 604 protein. The 1 - 604 fragment and full-length receptor bound adenophostin A with the same affinity, but the fragment had 3 -fold greater affinity for IP(3), suggesting that C-terminal residues selectively inhibit IP(3) binding. The 224 - 604 S 1 (+) fragment bound IP(3) and adenophostin A with increased affinity, but as with the 1 - 604 fragment it bound adenophostin A with only 2 -fold greater affinity than IP(3). High-affinity binding of adenophostin A may be partially determined by its 2 '-phosphate interacting more effectively than the 1 -phosphate of IP(3) with residues within the IP(3) -binding core. This may account for the 2 -fold greater affinity of adenophostin A relative to IP(3) for the minimal IP(3) -binding domain. In addition we suggest that C-terminal residues, which impede access of IP(3), may selectively interact with adenophostin A to allow it unhindered access to the IP(3) -binding domain...|$|R

Two linear hexapeptides (MSRAKE and CAKELR) and two disulfide-constrained hexapeptides (CLRSGRFC and CLPWKENC) were recovered by panning phage libraries on hCXCR 1 - and hCXCR 2 -transfected murine pre-B cells after specific elution with hCXCL 8. Sequence analysis revealed homology between the linear hexapeptides and the N-terminal domain (1 -SAKELR- 6), whereas the constrained peptides are composed of non-contiguous amino acids mimicking spatial structure {{on the surface of}} folded C-terminal portion of hCXCL 8 (50 -CLDPKENWVQRVVEKFLKRAENS- 72). The synthetic linear and structurally constrained peptides competed for (125) I-hCXCL 8 binding to hCXCR 1 and hCXCR 2 (IC(50) comprised between 10 and 100 μM). Furthermore, they inhibited the intracellular calcium flux and the migration of hCXCR 1 /hCXCR 2 transfectants; and desensitized hCXCR 1 and hCXCR 2 receptors on neutrophils, reducing their chemotactic responses induced by ELR-CXC chemokines (hCXCL 8, hCXCL 1, hCXCL 2, hCXCL 3, and hCXCL 5). To better characterize the residues required for hCXCL 8 binding, we identified three linear peptides MLRQTR, HASILP and KKEPWI specific to hCXCL 8. These peptides <b>similarly</b> <b>displaced</b> the binding of (125) I-hCXCL 8 to hCXCR 1 (IC(50) ranging from 8. 5 to 10 μM) in a dose-dependent manner, inhibited hCXCL 8 induced increases in the intracellular calcium, and migration of hCXCR 1 - and hCXCR 2 -transfected cells. The identified peptides could be used as antagonists of hCXCL 8 -induced activities related to its interaction with hCXCR 1 and hCXCR 2 receptors and may help in the design of new anti-inflammatory therapeutic molecules...|$|R
40|$|The article explores Roberta Torre’s film Sud Side Stori (2000), {{an extravagant}} Italian re-vision of Romeo and Juliet {{set in the}} Sicilian city of Palermo which {{displays}} awareness of the global circulation {{of the story of}} the two ‘‘star-crossed lovers’’. In the film, which combines neo-realist cinematographic techniques with the artificial style of the musical, Shakespeare’s young lovers become Toni Giulietto, a lousy local rock singer, and Romea Wacoubo, a beautiful Nigerian prostitute who falls in love with him when she sees him standing on his balcony. Not unlike West Side Story, the inter-racial passion between Toni and Romea exacerbates pre-existing ethnic conflicts. It is opposed not only by the two lovers’ ‘‘households’’ _ respectively, Toni’s three ugly aunties and Romea’s closest friends Mercutia and Baldassarra _ but also by the whole Nigerian immigrant community, including those African characters who run the racket of prostitution, and, more indirectly, by the local Mafia. The article argues that Torre’s film is a reiteration which ‘‘produces’’ the ‘‘textual body’’ of Shakespeare’s Romeo and Juliet as an ensemble of spectral/textual fragments which remain to be translated into Italian, and thus draws attention to translation as an interminable process. It adds that these fragments are often re-mediated, de-contextualized and forced to cohabit with the language of the body, music and dance, or even with the conventions of silent films, in ways which are reciprocally illuminating. The article also shows that in Torre’s film ‘‘Shakespearecentric’’ concerns _ what counts as Shakespeare, which includes the multifarious ways in which Romeo and Juliet has been recycled in contemporary global media culture _ and ‘‘Shakespeareccentric’’ concerns repeatedly interact with one another. Particularly significant in this respect {{is the fact that the}} film often brings an allegorical dimension to bear on the issues of migration and hospitality it continually foregrounds, so that the response to the alterity of the body of the ‘‘other’’/foreigner/migrant (i. e. especially Romea but also the <b>similarly</b> <b>displaced</b> ‘‘native’’ Toni Giuletto) becomes inextricably intertwined with the question of the incorporation of the ‘‘foreignness’’ of Shakespeare, a ‘‘textual body’’ which itself migrates from an Anglophone to a non-Anglophone context...|$|R
40|$|Old myths Die Hard": The Transformation of the Mounted Police in Alberta and Saskatchewan, 1914 - 1939 " {{is about}} the {{transformation}} of the world's most famous police force, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP). The force, formed in 1873, quickly gained mythic qualities. This mythic view of the Mounted Police would survive into the 1970 s. The impetus for change was the First World War, {{at the end of which}} the force found its very existence threatened. A Mountie unit had been dispatched to Europe to fight in the war. In order to gain enough strength for such an undertaking, Mounted Policemen gave up their regular policing duties in Alberta and Saskatchewan, the only provinces where they served in such a capacity. Suddenly, Alberta and Saskatchewan discovered that they could survive without the scarlet-clad policemen. During the war, the Mounted Police began extensive security intelligence operations in Alberta and Saskatchewan as Mounties, among other security duties, dropped the uniform and went undercover. By the end of the conflict, the Mounted Police controlled security operations in western Canada. In 1920, the force absorbed its security rival, the Dominion Police, and the RCMP came into being. In 1927, the force replaced the Saskatchewan Provincial Police. In 1932, it <b>similarly</b> <b>displaced</b> the Alberta Provincial Police. By the start of the Second World War, the RCMP's powerful post as Canada's national police and security force was without challenge. The Mounties symbolized all that was important and powerful in the Canada of the period. They were Anglo-Canadian males who belonged to an organization with strong connections to the dominant British values of the Canadian elite. Between 1914 and 1939, these men increasingly directed both their regular policing operations and security activities against those who somehow represented a challenge to the status quo in Canada. Non-Anglo-Canadian minorities in Alberta and Saskatchewan, including those of Ukrainian and Chinese background, received a great deal of overt and covert Mountie attention in the interwar period. The state linked east and central Europeans to the tremendous disorder that erupted in Canada in the concluding months of the war and in its immediate aftermath. Labour unrest was blamed on "foreigners. " In the 1920 s, the appearance and activities of the RCMP's biggest foe, the Communist Party of Canada, were also connected to non-Britishers. Throughout the period, the Mounties in Alberta and Saskatchewan increasingly focused their resources upon those outside the middle-class and ethnic mainstream: left-wing radicals who challenged the status quo, ethnic groups who refused to assimilate to the Anglo-Canadian ideal, other minorities who practiced activities deemed immoral by the Canadian majority, and workers of the employed and unemployed variety who protested against economic inequality. In doing so, Mounted Policemen made themselves indispensable to the Canadian state, ensuring the force's survival and turning it into one of the world's most powerful police forces. In the 1970 s, the force, specifically its security service, found itself surrounded by controversy. Scandals involving illegal activities by Mounties in Quebec in the war against separatism continually occupied news headlines across the country. The federal government eventually appointed a Royal Commission to investigate the breaking of laws by law enforcers. Based on the McDonald Commission's recommendations, the Liberal government of Pierre Trudeau stripped the force of its security/intelligence role, creating the Canadian Security Intelligence Service as a replacement.

40|$|Although {{the results}} we have {{recorded}} merely serve {{to indicate the}} possibilities of this interesting field of investigation, we have sufficient data to enable us to draw certain general conclusions. In the first place {{it is evident that}} the bloods of the more highly developed marine invertebrates, such as the active Crustacia and the Cephalopods, are specially adapted for the carriage of carbon dioxide. The quantity of carbon dioxide taken up by the blood of Maia, Palinurus, or Octopus at any given tension of the gas is, in general, about twice or three times as great as that which is taken up by sea water under the same conditions. On the other hand, the blood of a slow, creeping form, such as Aplysia, or of a sessile animal such as the ascidian Phallusia shows no more adaptation for the carriage of carbon dioxide than does sea water. But our estimations of the CO 2 content of the blood as it circulates in the bodies of these more active invertebrates show that the conditions of transport of this gas differ considerably in some respects from those which obtain in mammals. For the invertebrate blood in the body contains only a relatively small quantity of carbon dioxide, averaging in the forms we examined from 3 to 10 cc. per 100 cc. of blood. This forms a marked contrast with the condition found in mammals where even the arterial blood contains about 50 cc. of CO 2 per 100 cc. of blood. The invertebrate, therefore, works at a very low CO 2 tension. There is a twofold significance in this circumstance. In the first place, it means that only the first portion of the carbon dioxide dissociation curve is in use in the respiratory mechanism. Now an inspection of our curves will show that at these low carbon dioxide tensions the dissociation curves tend to be steeper than at higher tensions. As we intend to show in a later paper it can be proved mathematically that, other things being equal, a blood with a carbon dissociation curve of moderate steepness, i. e. one in which the carbon dioxide content of the blood increases fairly rapidly with increase of carbon dioxide tension, is a more efficient carrier of the gas from the tissues to a respiratory surface than a blood in which the dissociation curve is either steeper or flatter. It would seem as if the active invertebrates avoid the use of too flat a part of their CO 2 dissociation curves by working over the initial steeper portion. Furthermore, it is seen that over the range of this initial steep portion of the curves the changes of reaction produced by the uptake of carbon dioxide are much smaller than at higher tensions of the gas; for these initial portions of the curves are more nearly parallel to the lines of constant reaction calculated for a temperature of 15 °C. according to Hasselbalch's method (10) {{on the assumption that the}} whole of the combined CO 2 is in the form of sodium bicarbonate. It is evident also that on this assumption the hydrogen ion concentration of the blood of invertebrates (with the exception of the tunicates) would appear to be practically the same as that of the warm-blooded vertebrates—a conclusion confirmed by the direct measurements of Quagliariello (9). On the other hand, our measurements do not lend support to the idea put forward by Collip (4) that in order to maintain an appropriate faintly alkaline reaction an invertebrate needs to retain carbon dioxide in its blood at a comparatively high tension. This idea was based on the observation that at comparatively high CO 2 tensions the blood of invertebrates contains considerably more sodium bicarbonate than does sea water. But our curves show that this is no longer true at the lower values of carbon dioxide tension, the amount of sodium bicarbonate falling off more rapidly in the blood than in the sea water with diminution of the carbon dioxide tension so that in order to maintain an appropriate reaction in the blood only a comparatively small tension of CO 2 is required. The largest amount of carbon dioxide that we found present in the circulating blood of any of the types examined was 9. 7 cc. per 100 cc. of blood in the case of Maia, and in most cases the amount was considerably less. But even this lowest value corresponds to a tension of CO 2 of only about 3 mm., so that the tension gradient across the gill membrane must be even less than this. We would emphasize rather the circumstances that as the portion of the dissociation curve over which the reaction is approximately constant is of but small extent, it is necessary that in an active form like Octopus the carbon dioxide produced should be removed rapidly lest an accumulation of it should cause the limits of normal reaction to be exceeded; and this need is correlated with the extreme efficiency of the respiratory apparatus in this animal. It is interesting to notice that the mammal which, in order to obtain an appropriate reaction in the blood, has to work at relatively high carbon dioxide tensions where the dissociation curve is comparatively flat, secures a steeper physiological CO 2 dissociation curve in the body, and with it a more efficient carriage of carbon dioxide and a more constant reaction in the circulating fluid, in virtue of the effect of oxygenation on the carbon dioxide-combining power of its blood (3, 6). Returning now to the consideration of the actual form of the dissociation curves we have obtained—it is a significant fact that it is in those forms such as Maia, Palinurus, and Octopus whose bloods are rich in proteins—particularly hemocyanine—that the initial steep portion of the curve is observed. This suggests that in these forms the blood proteins act as weak acids and expel carbon dioxide from the blood at the low tensions which include the physiological range, just as in vertebrates the hemoglobin <b>similarly</b> <b>displaces</b> carbonic acid from its combination with alkali metal. On the other hand the cœlomic fluid of Aplysia contains no pigment and only 0. 00672 per cent of protein nitrogen (Bottazzi (11)) and shows no initial rapidly ascending portion of the CO 2 dissociation curve. This is supported by the observation of Quagliariello (9) that the acid-neutralising power of the blood of an invertebrate is roughly proportional to its protein content. It seems as if the proteins of invertebrate blood like the blood proteins of vertebrates, exist in the form of sodium salts which are capable of giving up sodium for the transport of carbon dioxide as sodium bicarbonate. That this is so in the case of hemocyanine follows from the fact that the isoelectric point of this pigment occurs at a hydrogen ion concentration of 2. 12 x 10 – 5 N, i. e. at a pH of 4. 67 (Quagliariello (12)) so that in the alkaline blood of the invertebrates possessing it, hemocyanine will act as a weak acid. It is probable that the initial steep portion of the carbon dioxide dissociation curves which we have found to be of such importance in the respiration physiology of Octopus, Palinurus, and Maia is produced by the competition of this acid with carbonic acid for the available sodium of the blood...|$|R

ENGLISH ABSTRACT: The {{moderately}} thermophilic (45 to 50 DC), highly acidophilic (pH 1. 5 to 2. 5), chemolithoautotrophic Acidithiobaci/lus caldus strain "f' {{was isolated}} from a biooxidation process {{used to treat}} nickel ore concentrates. Trans-Alternating Field Electrophoresis (TAFE) analysis of total DNA from the At. caldus cells revealed two plasmids of approximately 14 and 45 -kb. The 14 -kb plasmid, designated pTC-F 14, was cloned and shown by replacement of the cloning vector with a kanamycin resistance gene {{to be capable of}} autonomous replication in Escherichia coli. Autonomous replication was also demonstrated in Pseudomonas putida and Agrobacterium tumefaciens LBA 4404 which suggested that pTC-F 14 was a broad host-range plasmid. Sequence analysis of the pTC-F 14 replicon region revealed five open-reading frames, and a replicon organization like that of the broad host-range IncQ plasmids. Three of the open-reading frames encoded replication proteins with amino acid sequence identities {{similar to that of the}} IncQ-like plasmid pTF-FC 2 (RepA, 81 %; RepB, 78 %; RepC, 74 %). This high level of relatedness suggested that the two replicons had evolved from a common ancestor. Since closely related replicons are usually incompatible, the compatible replicons of pTC-F 14 and pTFFC 2 raised the question of how the replicons of the two sister plasmids had evolved such that they can now co-exist in the same host cell line. Further incompatibility testing with the IncQ-like plasmid pIEll 08 and the IncQ prototype plasmid RSF 10101 R 11621 R 300 B determined that pTC-F 14 was compatible with pIEI 108, but incompatible with the IncQ prototype plasmid. It was found that the RepB and RepA replication proteins ofpTF-FC 2 and pIEll 08 were able to complement the pTC-FI 4 orthologs only ifpTC-F 14 RepC was present in trans. The RepC protein ofpTC-F 14 was thus plasmid-template specific, while the RepA and RepB proteins were less plasmid-template specific. A five nucleotide possible iteron-discriminating region in the direct repeats of IncQ-like plasmid oriV regions has been identified (Tietze, E. (1998) Plasmid 39 : 165 - 181). The iteron sequence ofpTC-F 14 differs from pTF-FC 2 and pIE 1108 by three nucleotides in this iteron-discriminating region. It was therefore proposed that co-evolution of the iterons and the RepC protein to a point where the RepC protein no longer recognizes the iteron sequence of a closely related sister plasmid is the mechanism by which replicons evolve to become compatible in the same host cell. The incompatibility determinant of the IncQ prototype plasmid RSFlOlOIR 11621 R 300 B was also sought, and subsequently localized to the region encoding the IncQ prototype plasmid's repAC genes. Interference with the initiation of pTC-F 14 replication by the IncQ prototype plasmid was demonstrated by growth inhibition of a replication-deficient M 13 bacteriophage into which oriVpTC-F 14 had been cloned. Secondly, the IncQ prototype derivative pKE 462 displaced a ColEloriVpTC- F 14 construct in complementation assays, and a construct containing only the pTC-F 14 repBAC genes <b>similarly</b> <b>displaced</b> the pKE 462 plasmid. As the oriVRSFIOIO region was not incompatible with a pTC-F 14 replicon, this suggested that it was not the oriV region which was expressing incompatibility, but the products of the IncQ prototype plasmid repAC genes. It is proposed that incompatibility between pTC-F 14 and the IncQ prototype plasmid was the consequence of the repAC gene products binding to the iterons of the related rep licon, and that these products are unable to initiate replication. The compatible phenotypes expressed by members of the IncQ plasmid family indicates the inadequacy of using plasmid incompatibility as a classification system. Alignment of the amino acid sequences of the three replication protein orthologs clearly showed that the IncQ plasmid family was divided into two groups. To account for replication protein relatedness and the incompatibility phenotype expressed, it is now proposed that that members of the IncQ family be classified into subdivisions that reflect the different IncQ-like replicons identified in this study. Investigation of pTC-F 14 replicon regulation identified a putative promoter sequence which is believed to regulate the initiation of a 5. l- 5. 7 -kb polycistronic transcript that encodes all the replication proteins of the pTC-F 14 replicon and the MobB and MobA proteins of the IncP-type mobilization module. The large polycistronic transcript appears to regulated by the RepB protein of the pTC-F 14 replicon, and is not subject to cross-regulation by related IncQ plasmids. This suggested that the RepB primase function was not plasmid specific, but that its regulatory function was replicon specific. A second putative promoter sequence identified upstream of the pTC-F 14 pasAB operon was, however, cross-regulated by the closely related pTF-FC 2 plasmid. The pTC-F 14 pas operon encodes two proteins with high amino acid sequence identity (PasA, 81 %; PasB, 72 %) to the plasmid addiction system ofpTF-FC 2. This is the second time a plasmid addiction system of this type has been found on an IncQ-like plasmid. AFRIKAANSE OPSOMMING: Die matig termofiliese (45 to 50 °C), hoogs asidofiliese (pH 1. 5 to 2. 5), chemolitooutotrofiese Acidithiobaci/lus caldus ras "f' is geïsoleer vanaf 'n biooksiderende proses wat gebruik word om gekonsentreerde nikkel-erts te behandel. Trans- Afwisselende Veld Elektroforese (TAVE) analise van totale DNA vanaf die At. caldus selle, het twee plasmiede van ongeveer 14 en 45 -kb. onthul. Die 14 -kb plasmied, genaamd pTC-F 14, is gekloneer en deur vervanging van die kloneringsvektor met 'n kanamisien weerstandsgeen is daar gewys dat hierdie plasmied in staat is tot outonome replikasie in Escherichia coli. Outonome replikasie is ook gedemonstreer in Pseudomonas putida en Agrobacterium tumefaciens LBA 4404 wat suggereer dat pTC-F 14 'n wye gasheer-reeks plasmied is. Volgorde analise van die pTC-F 14 replikon area het vyf oop leesrame onthul, en 'n replikon organisasie soortgelyk aan dié van die wye gasheer-reeks IncQ plasmiede. Drie van die oop leesrame kodeer vir replikasie proteïene met aminosuur volgordes ooreenstemmend met dié van die IncQ-tipe plasmied pTF-FC 2 (RepA, 81 %; RepB, 78 %; RepC, 74 %). Hierdie hoë vlak van verwantskap stel voor dat die twee replikons vanaf 'n gemeenskaplike voorouer ontwikkel het. Aangesien naby-verwante replikons gewoonlik onverenigbaar is, het die verenigbaarheid van die replikons van pTC-F 14 en pTF-FC 2 die vraag laat onstaan van hoe die replikons van twee susterplasmiede ontwikkel het, sodat hulle nou gelyktydig in dieselfde gasheer sellyn kan voortbestaan. Verdere onverenigbaarheid toetsing van die IncQ-tipe plasmied pIE 1108 en die IncQ prototipe plasmied RSF 10101 R 11621 R 300 B, het bepaal dat pTCF 14 verenigbaar is met pIE 1108, maar onverenigbaar met die IncQ prototipe plasmied. Daar is gevind dat die RepB en RepA replikasie proteïene van pTF-FC 2 en pIE 1108 in staat was om die pTC-F 14 ortoloë te komplementeer, slegs as pTC-F 14 RepC in trans teenwoordig was. Die RepC proteïen van pTC-F 14 is dus plasmiedtemplaat spesifiek, terwyl die RepA en RepB proteïene minder plasmied-templaat spesifiek is. 'n Moontlike iteron-onderskeidende vyf-nukleotied area in die direkte herhalings van die IncQ-tipe plasmied oril/ areas, is geïdentifiseer (Tietze, E. (1998) Plasmid 39 : 165 - 181). Die iteron volgorde van pTC-F 14 verskil van pTF-FC 2 en pIEll 08 met drie nukleotiedes in hierdie iteron-onderskeidende area. Om hierdie rede is daar voorgestel dat ko-evolusie van iterons en die RepC proteïen, tot by 'n punt waar die RepC proteïen nie meer die iteron volgorde van 'n naby-verwante susterplasmied herken nie, die meganisme is waardeur replikons ontwikkel om verenigbaar te word in dieselfde gasheersel. Die onverenigbaarheidsbepaler van die IneQ prototipe plasmied RSFIOIOIR 11621 R 300 B is ook ondersoek en gelokaliseer tot die area wat kodeer vir die IneQ prototipe plasmied se repAC gene. Inmenging met die inisiasie van pTC-F 14 replikasie deur die IneQ prototipe plasmied is gedemonstreer deur groei vertraging van 'n replikasie-gebrekkige M 13 bakteriofaag waarin die oriVpTC-F 14 gekloneer is. Tweedens is die ColEl-oriVpTc-FI 4 konstruk vervang deur die IneQ prototipe-afgeleide pKE 462 in komplementasie proewe, en is die pKE 462 plasmied op soortgelyke wyse vervang deur 'n konstruk wat slegs die pTC-F 14 repBAC gene bevat. Aangesien die oriVRSF 1010 area nie verenigbaar was met 'n pTC-F 14 replikon nie, stel dit voor dat dit nie die oriV area is wat onverenigbaarheid uitdruk nie, maar die produkte van die IneQ prototipe plasmied se repAC gene. Dit is voorgestel dat onverenigbaarheid tussen pTC-F 14 en die IneQ prototipe plasmied die gevolg is van die repAC geenprodukte wat bind aan die iterons van die verwante replikon en dat hierdie produkte nie in staat is om replikasie te inisieer nie. Die verenigbare fenotipes wat deur die lede van die IneQ plasmied familie uitgedruk word, dui aan op die ontoereikendheid van die gebruik van plasmied onverenigbaarheid as 'n klassifikasie sisteem. Vergelyking van die aminosuur volgordes van die drie replikasie proteïen ortoloë wys duidelik daarop dat die IneQ plasmied familie in twee groepe verdeel is. Om verantwoording te doen vir die replikasie proteïen verwantskap en die onverenigbare fenotipe wat uitgedruk is, word daar nou voorgestel dat die lede van die IneQ familie geklassifiseer word in subafdelings wat die verskillende IneQ-tipe replikons geïdentifiseer in hierdie studie, reflekteer. Ondersoek na die pTC-F 14 replikon regulering het 'n moontlike promotor volgorde geïdentifiseer. Daar word gemeen dat hierdie promotor die inisiasie van 'n 5. l- 5. 7 -kb polisistroniese transkrip reguleer, wat kodeer vir al die replikasie proteïene van die pTC-F 14 replikon en die MobB en Mob A proteïene van die IneP-tipe mobilisasie module. Die groot polisistroniese transkrip blyk om gereguleer te word deur die RepB proteïen van die pTC-F 14 replikon, en word nie gekruis-reguleer deur die IneQ plasmiede nie. Dit stel voor dat die RepB primase se funksie nie plasmiedspesifiek is nie, maar dat die reguleerbare funksie replikon-spesifiek is. 'n Tweede moontlike promotor volgorde wat stroom-op van die pTC-F 14 pasAB operon geïdentifiseer is, is egter gekruis-reguleer deur die pTF-FC 2 plasmied. Die pTC-F 14 pas operon kodeer vir twee proteïene met hoë aminosuur volgorde verwantskappe (PasA, 81 %; PasB, 72 %) aan die plasmied-verslaafde sisteem van pTF-FC 2. Dit is die tweede keer dat hierdie tipe plasmied-verslaafde sisteem in 'n IncQ-tipe plasmied gevind is...|$|R
