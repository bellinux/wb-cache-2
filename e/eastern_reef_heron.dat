40|$|The {{foraging}} behaviour of the <b>Reef</b> <b>Heron</b> {{contains elements}} of hunting behaviour seen {{in many other}} species of heron. None the less, the <b>Reef</b> <b>Heron</b> relies mostly on a narrow range of techniques that minimize the problems created by the clear water and bright sunshine typical of coral reef habitats. These make fish, which are the Reef Heron's principal food, difficult to approach and prevent {{the use of that}} classic hunting method of herons of 'stand and wait'. The particular behaviour used by a foraging <b>Reef</b> <b>Heron</b> is determined by the kind and size of prey, the conditions of the substrate and water, and the weather...|$|R

50|$|The Tanji Bird Reserve has had around 300 {{species of}} birds {{recorded}} within it, including 82 species of Palearctic migrants. The reserve has been declared as an Important Bird Area by Birdlife International. Species seen regularly on the reserve's lagoons include Black-headed heron, white-fronted plover, Caspian tern, spur-winged plover, sanderling, Western <b>reef</b> <b>heron,</b> royal tern and lesser black-backed gull. While the Bijol Islands are an important feeding and roosting area for substantial numbers of shorebirds, seabirds, ospreys, and other birds, including Gambia's only breeding seabirds, including colonies of grey-headed gulls, slender-billed gulls, royal terns, Caspian terns, long-tailed cormorants and Western <b>reef</b> <b>herons.</b>|$|R
50|$|Sixteen {{species of}} native land birds and 15 species of native coastal birds have been {{recorded}} in the park. Wetland birds include the Australasian bittern, spotless crake and fernbird.

50|$|The western <b>reef</b> <b>heron</b> (nominate subspecies) {{occurs as}} a vagrant in North America, South America and the Caribbean islands. Based {{on the growing}} number of records it is {{suspected}} that they may establish breeding colonies in Brazil. Several records around 1980-90 in Germany, Austria and France have been attributed to birds that escaped from an animal dealer in Mittelfranken.|$|R

50|$|The western <b>reef</b> <b>heron</b> (Egretta gularis) {{also called}} the western reef egret, is a {{medium-sized}} heron found in southern Europe, Africa and parts of Asia. It has a mainly coastal distribution and occurs in several plumage forms: a slaty-grey plumage in which {{it can only be}} confused with the rather uncommon dark morph of the little egret (Egretta garzetta); a white form which can look very similar to the little egret although the bill tends to be paler and larger and the black form with white throat E. g. gularis of West Africa. There are also differences in size, structure and foraging behaviour. There have been suggestions that the species hybridizes with the little egret, and based on this, some authors treat schistacea and gularis as subspecies of Egretta garzetta. Works that consider the western <b>reef</b> <b>heron</b> as a valid species include the nominate gularis and schistacea as subspecies.|$|R
50|$|Mangrove swamps are {{important}} feeding grounds for fish, birds and animals. Marine wildlife includes oysters and shrimps. Mammals found here include the African manatee. Birds in these wet habitats include Goliath heron, purple heron, cattle egret, striated <b>heron,</b> western <b>reef</b> <b>heron,</b> greater flamingo, lesser flamingo, African spoonbill, and African sacred ibis. The forests also provide important habitat for migratory birds.|$|R

The sanctuary is also host to mudskippers, fiddler crabs and other mangrove habitat specialists. A species of crustacean Teleotanais indianis was described based on specimens obtained in the sanctuary.|$|R
5|$|Ochetellus ants are omnivores {{that feed}} {{primarily}} on arthropods, but they show {{a preference for}} fluids and sweets when they enter human houses. Workers will prey on Ornithoptera richmondia eggs, fruit fly pupae, Plutella larvae and attack wasp nests. Honeydew, nectar, Pacific <b>reef</b> <b>heron</b> feces, carrion, Pandanus fruits, plants, seeds, sucrose, fats and grease will also be consumed.

40|$|A {{survey of}} temperature, {{salinity}} and oxygen isotope ratio {{was conducted on}} the reefal waters of a lagoonal platform <b>reef,</b> <b>Heron</b> <b>Reef,</b> situated near {{the southern end of the}} Great Barrier Reef. The oxygen isotope ratio of the water changed by nearly 2 ‰ during a 3 -week period. Daily variations of 1. 4 ‰ were detected. As the maximum oxygen isotope ratios occurred at low tide, during times of high temperature and high salinity, temperature-induced variation in oxygen isotope ratios of skeletal material was masked. Such a phenomenon can easily explain why previous workers have failed to detect the full range of oxygen isotope ratios in coral skeletons and other calcareous organisms...|$|R
40|$|This is {{the first}} modern, {{comprehensive}} account of non-geniculate coralline algae (Corallinales, Rhodophyta) occurring on the Great Barrier <b>Reef</b> (<b>Heron</b> <b>Reef).</b> Species were identified in a modern context, using repro-ductive and vegetative anatomy as diagnostic features. In a collection of 300 specimens, 11 different species were identified. Eight of the species were found exclusively on calcareous substrata, one was exclusively epiphytic, while the remaining two were both epiphytic and found growing on calcareous substrata. Although none of the species are new to science, one is newly recorded for Australia (Hydrolithon reinboldii) and 5 are newly recorded for the Great Barrier Reef region (Spongites fruticulosus, Lithophyllum frondosum, L. pustula-tum, Mastophora pacifica and Mesophyllum erubescens). Collections made by A. B. Cribb in the 1960 s on <b>Heron</b> <b>Reef</b> were also studied, once again using reproductive and vegetative anatomy as diagnostic features. Illustrations of each species and a tabular key are provided to facilitate non-geniculate coralline algal identifi-cation on <b>Heron</b> <b>Reef.</b> Information on their distribution and growth-forms are provided along with references to more detailed morphological accounts and published illustrations. The reported species are compared to findings from other tropical reef systems...|$|R

Species breeding during 1988 included the brown booby, red-footed booby, great frigatebird, red-tailed tropicbird, sooty tern, white tern, brown noddy, and possibly the <b>reef</b> <b>heron.</b> Migratory birds present included the bristle-thighed curlew, turnstone, wandering tattler, golden plover, and the sanderling. The densest bird populations are on three islets {{to the north of}} Sibylla: North (Kita), Kamwome and an unnamed islet. Bokak is the only known breeding ground of Christmas shearwater and possibly Bulwer's petrel.|$|R
50|$|By contrast, the Hawar Islands {{have fewer}} habitat types {{and only about}} 60 migratory species have been {{recorded}} here. Many of these are seabirds and after the spring migrants have departed northwards, the breeding birds start to arrive. The Hawar Islands have been designated as an Important Bird and Biodiversity Area by BirdLife International. The main trigger species are the western <b>reef</b> <b>heron,</b> Socotra cormorant, white-cheeked tern, Saunders's tern and the Sooty falcon.
