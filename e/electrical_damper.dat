The core of this work is to investigate development of power converters for an electromagnetic suspension system which allows for regeneration of {{vibration energy}} and dynamics control of vehicle suspension. We present a variable <b>electrical</b> <b>damper</b> mechanism which can be controlled using unity power-factor AC/DC converter topologies. By controlling the synthesized <b>electrical</b> <b>damper,</b> the system is capable of providing variable damping forces, ranging from under-damped to over-damped cases, while regenerating mechanical vibration energy into electric charge stored in a battery. To demonstate the concept, the developed converter {{is attached to a}} small-scale one-degree-of-freedom suspension prototype which emulates a vehicle suspension mechanism. The energy regeneration mechanism consists of a mass-spring system and a ball-screw motion converter mechanism coupled to a DC machine, excited by a hydraulic shaker. The motion converter stage converts vibrational motion into a bi-directional rotatory motion, resulting in generation of back-emf in the rotary machine. We also introduce an optimized start/stop algorithm for the harvesting of energy using the proposed power converter. The algorithm allows for improvements in power conversion efficiency enhancement (≈ 14 % under class C road profile) through turning the circuit on/off during its operation. The idea is to ensure that the converter only operates in the positive conversion efficiency region; meaning that when there is enough energy the converter starts the energy harvesting process. Furthermore, an estimation of range enhancement for a full-scale electric vehicle (EV) is furnished using regenerative suspension. It is estimated that for a full size EV (e. g., Tesla model S), a range extension of 10 - 30 % is highly realistic, depending on the road conditions...|$|E

40|$|Because {{miniaturized}} systems store little energy, their lifespans {{are often}} short. Fortunately, vibrations are consistent and abundant in many applications, so ambient kinetic energy {{can be a}} viable source. Vibrations induce the charges in piezoelectric transducers to build electrostatic forces that damp vibrations and convert kinetic energy into the electrical domain. The shunting switches and switched-inductor circuit of bridge rectifiers in [1 - 2] increase this output energy by extending the damping (i. e., harvesting) duration within a vibration cycle. Because the output voltages of bridge rectifiers clamp and limit the <b>electrical</b> <b>damping</b> forces built, switched-inductor converters in [3 - 4], whose damping voltages can exceed their rectified outputs, draw more power from vibrations. Still, electrical–mechanical coupling factors in tiny transducers are low, so <b>electrical</b> <b>damping</b> forces (i. e., voltages) remain weak. Investing energy into the transducer can increase this force, but unlike in [5 - 6], which demand multiple inductors and high-voltage sources, the system presented here invests energy with only one inductor at low voltages...|$|R
40|$|A type of dual-mass {{vibration}} energy harvester, where two masses are connected {{in series with}} the energy transducer and spring, is proposed and analyzed in this paper. The dual-mass {{vibration energy}} harvester is proved {{to be able to}} harvest more energy than the traditional single degree-of-freedom (DOF) one when subjected to harmonic force or base displacement excitation. The optimal parameters for maximizing the power output in both the traditional and the new configurations are discussed with taking the parasitic mechanical damping of the system into account. In consistent of the previous literature, we find that the optimal condition for maximum power output of the single DOF vibration energy harvester is when the excitation frequency equals to the natural frequency of the mechanical system and the <b>electrical</b> <b>damping</b> due to the energy harvesting circuit {{is the same as the}} mechanical damping. However, the optimal conditions are quite different for the dual-mass vibration energy harvester. It is found that two local optimums exist, where the optimal excitation frequency and <b>electrical</b> <b>damping</b> are analytically obtained. The local maximum power of the dual-mass vibration energy harvester is larger than the global maximum power of single DOF one. Moreover, at certain frequency range between the two natural frequencies of the dual-mass system, the harvesting power always increases with the <b>electrical</b> <b>damping</b> ratio. This suggests that we can obtain higher energy harvesting rate using dual-mass harvester.

40|$|The {{performance}} of cantilever-beam piezoelectric energy harvester is usually analyzed with pure resistive circuit. The optimal {{performance of}} such a vibration-based energy harvesting system is limited by narrow bandwidth around its modified natural frequency. For broadband piezoelectric energy harvesting, series and parallel inductive-resistive circuits are introduced. The electromechanical coupled distributed parameter models for such systems under harmonic base excitations are decoupled with modified natural frequency and <b>electrical</b> <b>damping</b> to consider the coupling effect. Analytical solutions of the harvested power and tip displacement for the electromechanical decoupled model are confirmed with numerical solutions for the coupled model. The optimal performance of piezoelectric energy harvesting with inductive-resistive circuits is revealed theoretically as constant maximal power at any excitation frequency. This is achieved by the scenarios of matching the modified natural frequency with the excitation frequency and equating the <b>electrical</b> <b>damping</b> to the mechanical damping.

The thesis proposes and studies a new method, the Ideal Phase-Shifter (IPS) method, for selection and rating of Power Flow Controllers (PFC) in a power grid. The IPS method, which is based on steady-state calculations, is proposed as a first step in the design process for a PFC. The method uses the Power controller plane, introduced by Brochu et al in 1999. The IPS method extends the usage of decoupling methods in the Power controller plane to a power system of arbitrary size. The IPS method was in the thesis used to compare the ratings of different PFC:s required to improve the power transfer capability in two test systems. The studied devices were here the PST, the TSSC/TSSR and the DPFC. The thesis treats control of ideal Controlled Series Capacitors (CSC), TCSC, TSSC/TSSR, and DPFC.

40|$|With current {{electronic}} designs {{becoming more}} versatile and mobile, applications that were wired and bulky before have now seen a great reduction {{in size and}} increase in portability. However, the issue is that the scaling down in size and cost of electronics has far outpaced the scaling up of energy density in batteries. Therefore, {{a great deal of}} research has been carried out to search for alternative power sources that can replace or enhance the conventional battery. Energy harvesting (also known as energy scavenging) is the process whereby ambient energy is captured and stored. The ambient energy here refers to energy that is pre-existing in nature, and is self-regenerating and has extended life time from a battery. After reviewing many possible energy scavenging methods, the conversion of ambient vibrations to electricity is chosen as a method for further research. There are plenty of different methods to transform ambient vibration to electricity, but in this research only piezoelectric and electromagnetic conversions are pursued. In order to harvest the most energy with the harvesting device, the harvester’s fundamental mode must be excited. However, this is not always possible due to fluctuations in the frequency of the vibration source. By being able to change the natural frequencies of the device, the harvester could be more effective in capturing ambient energy. In this thesis, the behaviour of the various types of energy sources is studied and the obtained information is later used to generate a vibration signal for subsequent simulation and experiments. A converter based on a piezoelectric bimorph is investigated. The resultant outputs from the design are compared to the model and the analysis is presented. The mechanical strain distributions on the beam’s surface for five different geometric structures are compared and discussed. This is followed by a discussion of the feasibility of improving the strain distribution by changing the beam’s depth (height) along the cantilever beam length. Lastly, a novel frequency tuning method, which involves applying a different effective <b>electrical</b> <b>damping</b> in different quadrants of the oscillating cycle, is proposed. The results of this analysis are presented, along with experimental results that indicate that the behaviour of the system can be changed over a limited range by changing the effective <b>electrical</b> <b>damping</b> during the oscillation cycle...|$|R
