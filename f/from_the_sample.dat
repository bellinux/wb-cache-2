5|$|Soviet chemist D. K. Dobroserdov was {{the first}} {{scientist}} to claim to have found eka-caesium, or francium. In 1925, he observed weak radioactivity {{in a sample of}} potassium, another alkali metal, and incorrectly concluded that eka-caesium was contaminating the sample (the radioactivity <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> was from the naturally occurring potassium radioisotope, potassium-40). He then published a thesis on his predictions of the properties of eka-caesium, in which he named the element russium after his home country. Shortly thereafter, Dobroserdov began to focus on his teaching career at the Polytechnic Institute of Odessa, and he did not pursue the element further.|$|E

25|$|The first {{commercial}} {{development of the}} ESEM in the late 1980s allowed samples to be observed in low-pressure gaseous environments (e.g. 1–50 Torr or 0.1–6.7nbsp&kPa) and high relative humidity (up to 100%). This {{was made possible by}} the development of a secondary-electron detector capable of operating in the presence of water vapour and by the use of pressure-limiting apertures with differential pumping {{in the path of the}} electron beam to separate the vacuum region (around the gun and lenses) <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> chamber.|$|E
25|$|In {{secondary}} electron imaging, or SEI, the {{secondary electron}}s are emitted from {{very close to}} the specimen surface. Consequently, SEM can produce very high-resolution images of a sample surface, revealing details less than 1 nm in size. Back-scattered electrons (BSE) are beam electrons that are reflected <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> by elastic scattering. They emerge from deeper locations within the specimen and consequently the resolution of BSE images is less than SE images. However, BSE are often used in analytical SEM along with the spectra made from the characteristic X-rays, because the intensity of the BSE signal is strongly related to the atomic number (Z) of the specimen. BSE images can provide information about the distribution of different elements in the sample. For the same reason, BSE imaging can image colloidal gold immuno-labels of 5 or 10nm diameter, which would otherwise be difficult or impossible to detect in secondary electron images in biological specimens. Characteristic X-rays are emitted when the electron beam removes an inner shell electron <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>sample,</b> causing a higher-energy electron to fill the shell and release energy. These characteristic X-rays are used to identify the composition and measure the abundance of elements in the sample.|$|E
25|$|Imaging {{methods in}} TEM use the {{information}} contained in the electron waves exiting <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> to form an image. The projector lenses allow for the correct positioning of this electron wave distribution onto the viewing system. The observed intensity, I, of the image, assuming sufficiently high quality of imaging device, can be approximated as proportional to the time-averaged amplitude of the electron wavefunctions, where the wave that forms the exit beam is denoted by Ψ.|$|E

25|$|As in any {{longitudinal}} study, it {{is possible}} that the characteristics and behaviors of the sample are a partial result of the era they lived in. Indeed, many members of the sample could not attend college, due to the Great Depression and World War II. Almost half of women in the sample were homemakers for most of their lives. Despite these shortcomings, the data <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> is often used for studies because there is no other group of people who have been followed for so long.|$|E
25|$|The use of {{a primary}} X-ray beam to excite {{fluorescent}} radiation <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> was first proposed by Glocker and Schreiber in 1928. Today, the method {{is used as a}} non-destructive analytical technique, and as a process control tool in many extractive and processing industries. In principle, the lightest element that can be analysed is beryllium (Z = 4), but due to instrumental limitations and low X-ray yields for the light elements, {{it is often difficult to}} quantify elements lighter than sodium (Z = 11), unless background corrections and very comprehensive inter-element corrections are made.|$|E
25|$|Atom probes are unlike {{conventional}} optical or electron microscopes, in {{that the}} magnification effect comes from the magnification provided by a highly curved electric field, {{rather than by the}} manipulation of radiation paths. The method is destructive in nature removing ions from a sample surface in order to image and identify them, generating magnifications sufficient to observe individual atoms as they are removed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> surface. Through coupling of this magnification method with time of flight mass spectrometry, ions evaporated by application of electric pulses can have their mass-to-charge ratio computed.|$|E
