5|$|A {{second meeting}} {{occurred}} on 8 May, when Virginia came out while Monitor {{and four other}} Federal ships bombarded Confederate batteries at Sewell's Point. The Federal ships retired slowly to Fort Monroe, hoping to lure Virginia into the Roads. She did not follow, however, and after <b>firing</b> <b>a</b> gun to windward {{as a sign of}} contempt, anchored off Sewell's Point. Later when Confederate forces abandoned Norfolk on 11 May 1862, they were forced to destroy Virginia.|$|E
5|$|An {{observer}} was {{vulnerable to}} an enemy sniper <b>firing</b> <b>a</b> bullet through his loophole, but Hesketh-Prichard devised a metal-armoured double loophole {{that would protect}} him. The front loophole was fixed, but the rear was housed in a metal shutter sliding in grooves. Only when the two loopholes were lined up—a one-to-twenty chance—could an enemy shoot between them.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} it was {{uncertain}} which submarine had launched the torpedoes. Its periscope remained visible as lifeboats were lowered.

5|$|In {{the evening}} of 6 December, U-43 spotted a ship and pursued her {{for three and a}} half hours before <b>firing</b> <b>a</b> single torpedo, which missed. The U-boat fired another torpedo 20 minutes later, hitting the unknown ship and sinking her in 63 seconds. The vessel is {{believed}} to be the 1,902 ton Norwegian merchant ship Skrim, which had lost contact with Convoy OB-252 two days before in heavy weather and was never seen again.|$|E

5|$|After the {{outbreak}} of the American Revolution, George Rogers Clark was sent from Virginia to enforce its claim to much of the land in the Great Lakes region. In July 1778, Clark and about 175men crossed the Ohio River and took control of Kaskaskia, Vincennes, and several other villages in British Indiana. The occupation was accomplished without <b>firing</b> <b>a</b> shot because Clark carried letters from the French ambassador stating that France supported the Americans. These letters made most of the French and Native American inhabitants of the area unwilling to support the British.|$|E
5|$|At the French right flank, General Ferino {{attempted}} {{to push the}} Austrians back, first with a cannonade, followed by an attack through the woods {{on both sides of}} the road between Asch and Stockach. Two columns made two attacks, both of which were repulsed; finally, Ferino added his third column to the assault, which resulted in the Austrian reformation of the line, cannons at the center <b>firing</b> <b>a</b> heavy cannonade. Ferino could not respond because he had run out of artillery ammunition. The French fixed bayonets and charged the village of Wahlwies, successfully taking it, but they were unable to hold it in the night, and subsequently fell back.|$|E

5|$|Before dawn on January 30, 1964, General Nguyễn Khánh ousted the {{military}} junta led by General Dương Văn Minh from {{the leadership of}} South Vietnam without <b>firing</b> <b>a</b> shot. It came {{less than three months}} after Minh's junta had themselves come to power in a bloody coup against then President Ngô Đình Diệm. The coup was bloodless and took less than a few hours—after power had been seized Minh's aide and bodyguard, Major Nguyễn Văn Nhung was arrested and summarily executed.|$|E
5|$|Changes in {{legislation}} aided the cause. From 1968, county councils {{could set}} up country parks, under the Countryside Act 1968, and the Transport Act 1968 enabled the British Waterways Board to allow local authorities to maintain or purchase inland waterways. By 1969, BWB had stated that {{they were prepared to}} hand over the canal to Devon County Council, together with some money for maintenance. With some representatives within the council wavering, the preservation committee organised a walk along the entire canal on 18 October 1969. Around 400 walkers set off, with the local member of Parliament <b>firing</b> <b>a</b> starting gun, and by the time Tiverton was reached, the party totalled about 1200 people.|$|E
5|$|Coker {{was awarded}} the Navy Commendation Medal for his actions {{as part of a}} coordinated 23-aircraft attack on {{petroleum}} storage tanks in Hai Phong on August 2, 1966, consisting of four waves of A-6 Intruders and A-4 Skyhawks, <b>firing</b> <b>a</b> combination of 750 and 1,000 pound bombs and rockets. The attack was the third in a series of attacks on North Vietnamese oil storage depots dating back to June. Despite heavy anti-aircraft fire, Coker provided accurate guidance to the pilot on airspeed, altitude and dive angle, while operating both the attack navigation radar system and electronic countermeasures. Despite adverse weather conditions, Coker's actions contributed to an attack that destroyed {{all but one of the}} facility's storage tanks.|$|E
50|$|The Shock Blaster is the close-range {{weapon of}} the Ghostbusters arsenal. It <b>fires</b> <b>a</b> blast of {{stripped}} dark matter particles that diffuse quickly {{when they come}} in contact with the outside world. The Ghostbusters use the Shock Blaster for fighting close-proximity entities and inhabiting swarmers. The Shock Blaster also <b>fires</b> <b>a</b> Stasis Stream which <b>fires</b> <b>a</b> high-capacity stream that hypobond to ectoplasmic matter.

5|$|Eleven {{days later}} Dundas claimed a {{probable}} victory against a Bf 110, after {{a battle with}} German aircraft six miles north of RAF Warmwell at 16:30. Despite <b>firing</b> <b>a</b> 12–14 second burst at the enemy fighter, {{he did not see}} it crash. During the battle Dundas was hit in the leg when a cannon round exploded in his cockpit, but flew again the next day. The Spitfire Dundas flew that day, R6915, still exists, having been preserved by the Imperial War Museum. By 9 October 1940, his score stood at 10 and he was award the Distinguished Flying Cross.|$|E
5|$|General Nguyễn Khánh {{had come}} to power in January 1964 after {{surprising}} the ruling junta of General Dương Văn Minh in a pre-dawn operation, taking control without <b>firing</b> <b>a</b> shot. Because of American pressure, he retained the popular Minh as a token head of state, while holding the real power by controlling the Military Revolutionary Council (MRC). In August, the Vietnam War expanded with the Tonkin Gulf incident, a disputed encounter between North Vietnamese and American naval vessels; Washington accused the communists of launching an attack in international waters.|$|E
5|$|He {{took one}} touch {{to control a}} long 60-yard aerial pass from Frank de Boer, brought the ball down through Argentine defender Roberto Ayala's legs, and finally {{finished}} by <b>firing</b> <b>a</b> volley with the outside of his right foot, past keeper Carlos Roa at a tight angle from the right. The goal, cited by Bergkamp as his favourite in his career, was his 36th for the national team, overtaking Faas Wilkes as the record goalscorer. In the semi-finals, the Netherlands lost to Brazil on penalties after drawing 1–1 in normal time. Bergkamp made the All-Star team of the tournament, alongside Frank de Boer and Edgar Davids.|$|E

5|$|In July 1778, Clark {{and about}} 175 men crossed the Ohio River at Fort Massac and marched to Kaskaskia, {{capturing}} {{it on the}} night of July 4 without firing their weapons. The next day, Captain Joseph Bowman and his company captured Cahokia in a similar fashion without <b>firing</b> <b>a</b> shot. The garrison at Vincennes along the Wabash River surrendered to Clark in August. Several other villages and British forts were subsequently captured, after most of the French-speaking and Indian inhabitants refused to take up arms on behalf of the British. To counter Clark's advance, Hamilton recaptured the garrison at Vincennes, which the British called Fort Sackville, with a small force in December 1778.|$|E

Bond follows him to Switzerland, where Tilly, Jill's sister, makes an unsuccessful attempt at revenge by <b>firing</b> <b>a</b> rifle at Goldfinger.|$|E
5|$|Jack {{surfaced}} {{again after}} dark, and successfully attacked after the moon set. Dykers {{found that the}} Japanese escorts were alert, {{and was unable to}} penetrate the convoy.

These attacks sank the 5,425-ton freighter SS Yoshida Maru No. 1, which was carrying an entire regiment of the 32nd Division. All 3,000 soldiers onboard drowned when the ship sank quickly. The remaining Japanese ships continued to Manila, arriving there on 29 April.|$|E
