According to Paparrigopoulos, history vindicated Cimon, because Athens, after Pericles' death, sank into the abyss of political turmoil and demagogy. Paparrigopoulos maintains that an unprecedented regression descended upon the city, whose glory perished {{as a result of}} Pericles' populist policies.|$|E

He said he had not been keeping track of the number of gunshots fired in Dealey Plaza because he {{believed}} them to be fireworks, but <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>certain</b> of at least two. Altgens believed Kennedy's wounds suggested a final shot that came from the vicinity of the book depository building, but he could not say with any certainty.|$|E

Her estranged husband, Roger, had an alibi for the night concerned, and was eliminated from police inquiries. Other male friends and boyfriends were questioned and discounted as suspects. Her parents confirmed that Sandra had a good working relationship with Lady Lucan, and was extremely fond of the children. Meanwhile, Lucan had yet to make an appearance, and so his description was circulated to police forces across the country. Newspapers and television stations were told only that Lucan was wanted by the police for questioning.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, Cecil and Noirin Carmody {{met with}} Sean Brennan, then-head of {{publishing}} at Virgin Interactive, and spoke {{about how the}} Knights Templar would make an ideal subject to base a game on. Later, Virgin agreed to issue the game. In a September 1992 interview for French magazine Génération 4, Charles Cecil stated that he had begun working on a scenario for Revolution's third game, after 1992's Lure of the Temptress and 1994's then-upcoming Beneath a Steel Sky. The game would be set in Paris with a Templar story line. The following month, Cecil visited Paris to research the Templars; after reading The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>certain</b> there was enough known about the Templars to make them a good subject for a game. Cecil, Dave Cummins, and Jonathan Howard began work on the story and design. Cecil and Cummins attended a film-writing course and their script was read by Alan Drury, a senior BBC scriptwriter and dramatist. Revolution artist Steve Ince created initial location sketches for the game before working on Beneath a Steel Sky. He was promoted to producer halfway through the project.|$|E
5|$|In {{clear and}} {{forceful}} language Floyd reasserted the state sovereignty theory of government, as {{guaranteed by the}} 'Compact or Constitution,' holding the Federal Government to be merely the 'Agent of the States' entrusted only with such powers as were originally intended to operate 'externally' and 'upon nations foreign to those composing the Confederacy.' He {{called attention to the}} disregard with which 'an unrestrained majority' had received the memorials and protests of some of the 'sovereign states,' justifying their acts by precedent and expediency and thus melting away 'the solder of the Federal chain;' also {{to the fact that it}} was then 'strongly insinuated' that the states could not 'interpose to arrest an unconstitutional measure.' Such a course, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>certain,</b> could result only in nullifying the federal constitution and in a complete failure in our experiment in government.|$|E

5|$|On {{the advice}} of Rommel and Jodl, Hitler decided that the Italian Peninsula could not be held without the {{assistance}} of the Italian Army. Kesselring was ordered to withdraw from southern Italy and consolidate his Army Group C with Rommel's Army Group B in Northern Italy, where Rommel would assume overall command. Kesselring was slated to be posted to Norway. Kesselring was appalled at the prospect of abandoning Italy. It would expose southern Germany to bombers operating from Italy; risk the Allies breaking into the Po Valley; and was completely unnecessary, as <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>certain</b> that Rome could be held until the summer of 1944. This assessment was based on his belief that the Allies would not conduct operations outside the range of their air cover, which could only reach as far as Salerno. Kesselring submitted his resignation on 14 August 1943.|$|E
5|$|Following Cortés' visit, no Spanish {{attempted}} {{to visit the}} warlike Itza inhabitants of Nojpetén for almost a hundred years. In 1618 two Franciscan friars set out from Mérida in Yucatán {{on a mission to}} attempt the peaceful conversion of the still pagan Itza in central Petén. Bartolomé de Fuensalida and Juan de Orbita were accompanied by some Christianised Maya. Andrés Carrillo de Pernía, a Criollo who was the alcalde of Bacalar (a colonial official), joined the party at Bacalar and escorted them upriver as far as Tipuj, returning to Bacalar once <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>certain</b> of the friars receiving a good welcome there. After an arduous six-month journey the travellers were well received by the current Kan Ek'. They stayed at Nojpetén for some days in an attempt to evangelise the Itza, but the Aj Kan Ek' refused to renounce his Maya religion, although he showed interest in the masses held by the Catholic missionaries. Kan Ek' informed them that according to ancient Itza prophecy it was not yet time for them to convert. In the time since Cortés had visited Nojpetén, the Itza had made a statue of the deified horse. Juan de Orbita was outraged when he saw the idol and he immediately smashed it into pieces. Fuensalida was able to save the lives of the visitors from the infuriated natives by means of a particularly eloquent sermon that resulted in them being forgiven. Attempts to convert the Itza failed, and the friars left Nojpetén on friendly terms with Kan Ek'.|$|E

25|$|The third {{expedition}} by Columbus in 1498 was {{the beginning}} of the first successful Castilian (Spanish) colonization in the West Indies, on the island of Hispaniola. Despite growing doubts, Columbus refused to accept that he had not reached the Indies. During the voyage he discovered the mouth of the Orinoco River on the north coast of South America (now Venezuela) and thought that the huge quantity of fresh water coming from it could only be from a continental land mass, which <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>certain</b> was the Asian mainland.|$|E

Although it was an odd promise, Prefontaine was up for the challenge. Sometime after Prefontaine announced that he signed a letter of intent to attend the University of Oregon on the first of May in 1969, Bowerman wrote a letter addressed to the community of Coos Bay describing his appreciation for their role in helping Steve become a great runner.|$|E

His plan was to defeat Pope before McClellan's army could arrive {{to reinforce}} it by cutting bridges in Pope's rear and then attacking his left flank and rear. Pope spoiled Lee's plans by withdrawing to the line of the Rappahannock River; he was aware of Lee's plan because a Union cavalry raid captured a copy of the written order.|$|E

25|$|Returning in the ships, Antón de Alaminos imposed {{slow and}} {{vigilant}} navigation, moving only by day, because <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>certain</b> that Yucatán was an island. The travellers' greatest hardship, {{a scarcity of}} potable water aboard, added to their woes. The stores of water, casks and jugs were not of the quality required for long voyages ("we were too poor to buy good ones", laments Bernal); the casks were constantly losing water and they also failed to keep it fresh, and so de Córdoba's ships needed to replenish their supplies ashore. The Spaniards had already noted that the region seemed to be devoid of freshwater rivers.|$|E

By this time some cricket had resumed in England and the KFE had played a number of matches against other service sides. Blythe's final match was at Lord's in August 1917 for an Army and Navy side against one made up of Australians and South Africans. By this time <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>certain</b> {{that he would not}} be able to play cricket professionally once the war was over and was appointed as cricket coach at Eton College, intending to take up the position once the war was over.|$|E
25|$|The Confederates {{lost two}} key commanders, Mouton and Green, and {{suffered}} casualties {{they could not}} afford. Perhaps more importantly, relations between the aggressive Taylor and cautious Smith were permanently damaged by their disagreement over Smith's decision to remove half of Taylor's troops following the Battle of Pleasant Hill. The lost opportunity to capture the entire Union fleet as it lay helpless above the falls at Alexandria haunted Taylor to his dying day; <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>certain</b> that Smith had robbed {{him a chance to}} cripple the Union forces. The arguments between the two generals resulted in Taylor's transfer to command of the Department of East Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama soon after the campaign ended.|$|E

25|$|In 1974, Marjorie Garber {{argued that}} {{metamorphosis}} {{is both the}} major subject of the play and the model of its structure. She noted that in this play, the entry in the woods is a dream-like change in perception, a change which affects both the characters and the audience. Dreams here take priority over reason, and are truer than the reality they seek to interpret and transform. Also in 1974, Alexander Leggatt offered his own reading of the play. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>certain</b> that there are grimmer elements in the play, but they are overlooked because the audience focuses {{on the story of}} the sympathetic young lovers. He viewed the characters as separated into four groups which interact in various ways. Among the four, the fairies stand as the most sophisticated and unconstrained. The contrasts between the interacting groups produce the play's comic perspective.|$|E
25|$|On August 13, Lee sent Longstreet to {{reinforce}} Jackson, {{and on the}} following day Lee sent all of his remaining forces (except for two brigades) after <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>certain</b> that McClellan was leaving the Peninsula. Lee arrived at Gordonsville to take command on August 15. He massed the Army of Northern Virginia south of Clark's Mountain and planned a turning movement to defeat Pope before McClellan's army could arrive {{to reinforce}} it. His plan was to send his cavalry under Stuart, followed by his entire army, north to the Rapidan River on August 18, screened from view by Clark's Mountain. Stuart would cross and destroy the railroad bridge at Somerville Ford and then move around Pope's left flank into the Federal rear, destroying supplies and blocking their possible avenues of retreat. Logistical difficulties and cavalry movement delays caused the plan to be abandoned.|$|E
25|$|When McLane entered Jackson’s cabinet he {{immediately}} assumed {{a position of}} leadership. Articulate, persuasive and energetic, he had mastered the issues under debate and was confident he could lead {{the others in the}} administration, including the President. Recognizing there was a difference of opinion with Jackson over the Bank, he sought to work out a plan with the bank president, Nicholas Biddle, to provide for the upcoming renewal of the bank’s charter in return for the accomplishment of a key objective of the President, the retirement of the national debt. On December 7, 1831 he proposed a sweeping plan to accomplish that and more. Acclaimed for its Hamiltonian creativity, McLane had taken the initiative on the administration’s agenda, and was acting very much in the role of a Prime Minister. With enough time <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>certain</b> Jackson would soften his position and consent to the approach.|$|E
