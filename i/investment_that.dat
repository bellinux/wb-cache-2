5|$|Sawyer is in {{bed with}} a young woman, Jessica (Kristin Richardson). After he {{declares}} his love for her, she realizes he is late for a meeting. As he rushes to leave, his briefcase falls open, revealing thousands of dollars in cash he claims she was not supposed to have seen. Sawyer then informs her that he is meeting someone to get money for an <b>investment</b> <b>that</b> will triple his cash in two weeks, and Jessica tells him that she will get additional money from her husband, David (Michael DeLuise), so that she and Sawyer can split the profit. Later, Sawyer is revealed to be a con artist in debt with a loan shark, Kilo (Billy Mayo), who demands his money back, plus fifty percent, by the next day. Sawyer goes to Jessica's house to finalize the deal, but reconsiders upon seeing a small boy (Jim Woitas) emerge from another room. He suddenly calls off the con, drops his briefcase of money, and rushes out of their house.|$|E

40|$|Preliminary, {{please do}} not quote We develop a dynamic politico-economic model of public {{investment}} where decisions can be made at several levels of government: federal, state, or county. The model predicts that {{in the absence of}} internal mobility, the higher level of government would fund all <b>investments</b> <b>that</b> present positive externalities not fully internalized at lower levels. But when there are important internal migrations unrelated to fiscal policy, <b>investments</b> <b>that</b> are embodied — and therefore are useful to citizens if they move to other jurisdictions, like education — {{are more likely to be}} funded at the local level than <b>investments</b> <b>that</b> are physically sunk, as infrastructure.

25|$|Value {{investing}} is {{an investment}} paradigm which generally involves buying securities that appear underpriced by some form of fundamental analysis, though it has taken many forms since its inception. It derives from the ideas on <b>investment</b> <b>that</b> Benjamin Graham and David Dodd began teaching at Columbia Business School in 1928 and subsequently developed in their 1934 text Security Analysis. As examples, such securities may be stock in public companies that trade at discounts to book value or tangible book value, have high dividend yields, have low price-to-earning multiples or have low price-to-book ratios.|$|E
25|$|To {{deal with}} the problem of zero {{interest}} creating unlimited demand for <b>investment</b> <b>that</b> is limited in supply, activists such as Siddiqi suggest a two-tier mudarabah model as the basis of a riba-free banking system. This involves the bank acting as the capital partner in a back-to-back mudarabah contract with the depositor {{on one side and the}} entrepreneur on the other side. This model can be supplemented by a number of fixed-return models (like Ijara, Istisna, Murabaha etc.). In practice the murabaha model is the bank's favourite, as it bears results most similar to the interest-based finance models.|$|E

It does not mark the start of philanthropy as a solution to public insolvency. This is a unique, clear-eyed move to push forward positive negotiations, with our philanthropic dollars being exclusively pegged for two roles: safeguarding the DIA and protecting pensions.|$|E

25|$|The first oil was {{discovered}} {{at the small}} Balder field in 1967, production only began in 1999. In 1969, the Phillips Petroleum Company discovered petroleum resources at the Ekofisk field west of Norway. In 1973, the Norwegian government founded the State oil company, Statoil. Oil production did not provide net income until the early 1980s {{because of the large}} capital <b>investment</b> <b>that</b> was required to establish the country's petroleum industry. Around 1975, both the proportion and absolute number of workers in industry peaked. Since then labour-intensive industries and services like factory mass production and shipping have largely been outsourced.|$|E

This district includes both private and public <b>investment</b> <b>that</b> builds upon the rich heritage of the district, educational opportunities, historic interpretation, architectural significant building and recreational amenities.

The main line east from Swansea was exceptionally congested with mineral traffic, impeding the passage of the premium express passenger trains. The section between Court Sart and Port Talbot was widened, subsuming all of the former R infrastructure in the Court Sart and Briton Ferry area into the main line there.|$|E
