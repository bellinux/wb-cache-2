Lennon continued to be casually inconsiderate towards her, later saying, [...] "I was <b>in</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> a blind rage for two years. I was either drunk or fighting. It had been the same with other girl friends I'd had. There was something the matter with me." [...] Tony Bramwell—a friend of Lennon's since his youth—later said: [...] "Cynthia was beautiful, physically, and on the inside. Although she knew he [...] was apt to find love on the road, she was totally dedicated to his success... and extremely influential. He was insecure and Cynthia was there to pump him up, to buttress, sort of, his weak side." ...|$|E
500|$|At the 2006 San Diego Comic-Con International, Wright {{said he was}} {{intrigued}} by the story's high concept and character. Wright also stressed that the film {{would not be a}} spoof but an action-adventure with some comedic elements and would incorporate both the Hank Pym and Scott Lang incarnations of the character. Wright said that he was looking to [...] "do a prologue where you see Pym as Ant-Man in action in the 60s, <b>in</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> Tales to Astonish mode basically, and then the contemporary, sort of flash-forward, is Scott Lang's story, and how he comes to acquire the suit, how he crosses paths with Hank Pym, and then, in an interesting sort of Machiavellian way, teams up with him." [...] The next February, Wright said that the project was in [...] "a holding pattern" [...] while the script was being revised, and that he had been doing research for the film by studying nanotechnology. In March 2008, Wright said that the first draft of the script had been completed and he was working on the second.|$|E

Jennifer, now possessed by a demon and subsequently altered into a succubus, sets out on a bloody rampage in which she devours boys, and {{it is up to}} Needy to stop her. <b>In</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> a reversal aspect of how puberty changes a girl's life, Jennifer must consume the blood of others once a month or she becomes weak and plain-looking. [...] "It's a meek shall inherit the Earth sort of thing. I think it's always really satisfying and cathartic to see a character that was previously bullied become super human", said Cody. Cody said the script is not a reflection of any part of her own life, but that she is more like character Needy. [...] "I would say I was more of a Needy than a Jennifer. I was never an Alpha female, and I've never gotten off with bullying other people", she said. [...] "If I had to choose, I was definitely the one being shoved, not the one shoving." ...|$|E

500|$|Brothers Glenn and Todd Kessler {{decided to}} work with Daniel Zelman because [...] "we have a third brother, but Daniel {{is kind of like}} our fourth brother that we've known for over 20 years." [...] When the Kesslers and Zelman devised the series, they did not {{specifically}} intend for Patty and Ellen to be lawyers. They wanted to explore the power structures in two strong women—feeling that the male power dynamics had been seen before—and considered a number of professions, including entertainment and pharmaceuticals, before deciding on law. Zelman said that the writers' main motivation to write about the law [...] "was our interest in power dynamics, the dynamics of power in society. We're very much interested in the ambiguity of it. We're just interested in seeing how far we can push these characters." [...] According to Kessler, [...] "One thing that's crucial is that Patty Hewes is {{on one end of the}} spectrum and Ellen Parsons is on the other." [...] The relationship the writers were most interested in showing was that between a mentor and a mentee, which is represented by Patty and her protégée Ellen. Todd Kessler called the real life Enron case [...] "a big part" [...] of the inspiration for Patty's main case involving Arthur Frobisher, though Zelman claims that Enron was not used as a basis in particular: [...] "It was more just the culture of all those corporate scandals at the time. There seemed to be one after the other of them, and we became very interested <b>in</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> the characters who were a part of those scandals." ...|$|E

2500|$|After the game, Lyle Blackwood {{criticized the}} referee's ruling of Freddie Solomon's fumble as an {{incomplete}} pass. [...] "You don't want {{the game to}} hinge on that play, but you never know," [...] Blackwood said. [...] "I could have taken the ball up the sideline. That's a 14-point swing." [...] However, other Dolphins were not convinced. [...] "We were dominated {{to the point where}} one play didn't make much of a difference," [...] said Dolphins coach Don Shula. [...] "Our major objective was to contain Montana, and we did a terrible, terrible job of it," [...] added defensive coach Chuck Studley. Even Reggie Roby, who averaged only 39.3 yards per punt and didn't place any of his 6 punts inside the 20, took some responsibility for the loss. [...] "I was trying to kill the ball, and I kicked it bad," [...] he said. [...] "I didn't hit one well. I was scared – scared to make a mistake. It was the worst game of my life, counting high school, college, counting everything." [...] Meanwhile, in the 49ers' locker room, Joe Montana had his own explanation for the win. [...] "As far as my own game, well, I'd have to admit it was pretty close to the best I've ever played. I didn't throw anything I didn't have confidence in. We got <b>in</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> a groove. Once you get going like that you gain confidence, and it carries over to the defense, and then back to the offense.

6000|$|As feels {{a dreamer}} what doth most create [...] His own {{particular}} fright, so these three felt: [...] Or like one who, in after ages, knelt [...] 900 [...] To Lucifer or Baal, when he'd pine [...] After a little sleep: or when in mine [...] Far under-ground, a sleeper meets his friends [...] Who know him not. Each diligently bends [...] Towards common thoughts and things for very fear; [...] Striving their ghastly malady to cheer, [...] By thinking it {{a thing of}} yes and no, [...] That housewives talk of. But the spirit-blow [...] Was struck, and all were dreamers. At the last [...] Endymion said: [...] "Are not our fates all cast? [...] 910 [...] Why stand we here? Adieu, ye tender pair! [...] Adieu!" [...] Whereat those maidens, with wild stare, [...] Walk'd dizzily away. Pained and hot [...] His eyes went after them, until they got [...] Near to a cypress grove, whose deadly maw, [...] In one swift moment, would what then he saw [...] Engulph for ever. [...] "Stay!" [...] he cried, [...] "ah, stay! [...] Turn, damsels! hist! one word I have to say. [...] Sweet Indian, I would see thee once again. [...] It is a thing I dote on: so I'd fain, [...] 920 [...] Peona, ye should hand in hand repair [...] Into those holy groves, that silent are [...] Behind great Dian's temple. I'll be yon, [...] At vesper's earliest twinkle--they are gone-- [...] But once, once, once again--" [...] At this he press'd [...] His hands against his face, and then did rest [...] His head upon a mossy hillock green, [...] And so remain'd as he a corpse had been [...] All the long day; save when he scantly lifted [...] His eyes abroad, to see how shadows shifted [...] 930 [...] With the slow move of time,--sluggish and weary [...] Until the poplar tops, in journey dreary, [...] Had reach'd the river's brim. Then up he rose, [...] And, slowly as that very river flows, [...] Walk'd towards the temple grove with this lament: [...] "Why such a golden eve? The breeze is sent [...] Careful and soft, that not a leaf may fall [...] Before the serene father of them all [...] Bows down his summer head below the west. [...] Now am I of breath, speech, and speed possest, [...] 940 [...] But at the setting I must bid adieu [...] To her for the last time. Night will strew [...] On the damp grass myriads of lingering leaves, [...] And with them shall I die; nor much it grieves [...] To die, when summer dies on the cold sward. [...] Why, I have been a butterfly, a lord [...] Of flowers, garlands, love-knots, silly posies, [...] Groves, meadows, melodies, and arbour roses; [...] My kingdom's at its death, and just it is [...] That I should die with it: so in all this [...] 950 [...] We miscal grief, bale, sorrow, heartbreak, woe, [...] What is there to plain of? By Titan's foe [...] I am but rightly serv'd." [...] So saying, he [...] Tripp'd lightly on, <b>in</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> deathful glee; [...] Laughing at the clear stream and setting sun, [...] As though they jests had been: nor had he done [...] His laugh at nature's holy countenance, [...] Until that grove appear'd, as if perchance, [...] And then his tongue with sober seemlihed [...] Gave utterance as he entered: [...] "Ha!" [...] I said, [...] 960 [...] "King of the butterflies; but by this gloom, [...] And by old Rhadamanthus' tongue of doom, [...] This dusk religion, pomp of solitude, [...] And the Promethean clay by thief endued, [...] By old Saturnus' forelock, by his head [...] Shook with eternal palsy, I did wed [...] Myself to things of light from infancy; [...] And thus to be cast out, thus lorn to die, [...] Is sure {{enough to make a}} mortal man [...] Grow impious." [...] So he inwardly began [...] 970 [...] On things for which no wording can be found; [...] Deeper and deeper sinking, until drown'd [...] Beyond the reach of music: for the choir [...] Of Cynthia he heard not, though rough briar [...] Nor muffling thicket interpos'd to dull [...] The vesper hymn, far swollen, soft and full, [...] Through the dark pillars of those sylvan aisles. [...] He saw not the two maidens, nor their smiles, [...] Wan as primroses gather'd at midnight [...] By chilly finger'd spring. [...] "Unhappy wight! [...] 980 [...] Endymion!" [...] said Peona, [...] "we are here! [...] What wouldst thou ere we all are laid on bier?" [...] Then he embrac'd her, and his lady's hand [...] Press'd, saying: [...] "Sister, I would have command, [...] If it were heaven's will, on our sad fate." [...] At which that dark-eyed stranger stood elate [...] And said, in a new voice, but sweet as love, [...] To Endymion's amaze: [...] "By Cupid's dove, [...] And so thou shalt! and by the lily truth [...] Of my own breast thou shalt, beloved youth!" [...] 990 [...] And as she spake, into her face there came [...] Light, as reflected from a silver flame: [...] Her long black hair swell'd ampler, in display [...] Full golden; in her eyes a brighter day [...] Dawn'd blue and full of love. Aye, he beheld [...] Phœbe, his passion! joyous she upheld [...] Her lucid bow, continuing thus: [...] "Drear, drear [...] Has our delaying been; but foolish fear [...] Withheld me first; and then decrees of fate; [...] And then 'twas fit that from this mortal state [...] 1000 [...] Thou shouldst, my love, by some unlook'd for change [...] Be spiritualiz'd. Peona, we shall range [...] These forests, and to thee they safe shall be [...] As was thy cradle; hither shalt thou flee [...] To meet us many a time." [...] Next Cynthia bright [...] Peona kiss'd, and bless'd with fair good night: [...] Her brother kiss'd her too, and knelt adown [...] Before his goddess, in a blissful swoon. [...] She gave her fair hands to him, and behold, [...] Before three swiftest kisses he had told, [...] 1010 [...] They vanish'd far away!--Peona went [...] Home through the gloomy wood in wonderment.|$|E
