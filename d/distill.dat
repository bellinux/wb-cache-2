5|$|In the 1850s, {{the process}} to <b>distill</b> {{kerosene}} from petroleum was invented by Abraham Gesner. The demand for the petroleum as a fuel for lighting around the world quickly grew. Petroleum exploration developed {{in many parts of}} the world with the Russian Empire, particularly the Branobel company in Azerbaijan, taking the lead in production by the end of the 19th century.|$|E
5|$|In 1933, Stroud {{advertised in}} a {{publication}} {{that he had}} not received any royalties from the sales of Diseases of Canaries. In retaliation, the publisher complained to the warden, and, as a result, proceedings were initiated to transfer Stroud to Alcatraz, where he would not be permitted to keep his birds. In the end, however, Stroud was able to keep both his birds and canary-selling business at Leavenworth. Stroud avoided trouble for several more years, until it came to light that some of the equipment Stroud had requested for his lab was in fact being used as a home-made still to <b>distill</b> alcohol. Officials finally had the wedge they needed to drive Stroud out.|$|E
5|$|The {{cognitive}} ability {{of children with}} AS often allows them to articulate social norms in a laboratory context, where {{they may be able}} to show a theoretical understanding of other people's emotions; however, they typically have difficulty acting on this knowledge in fluid, real-life situations. People with AS may analyze and <b>distill</b> their observations of social interaction into rigid behavioral guidelines, and apply these rules in awkward ways, such as forced eye contact, resulting in a demeanor that appears rigid or socially naive. Childhood desire for companionship can become numbed through a history of failed social encounters.|$|E

5|$|Unlike {{many other}} states, New Jersey imposes no {{restrictions}} on the types or quantities of alcoholic beverages that a person of legal age may purchase. Grain alcohol, caffeinated alcoholic beverages, and absinthe can be legally sold, and state law imposes no limitations on the alcohol content of beer or wine. New Jersey does not require kegs to be registered, and state ABC regulations prohibit municipal keg registration laws. A resident can import any amount of alcohol into the state for personal use, but a $50 permit is required if more than 3 gallons of beer, 1 gallon of wine, or a half-gallon of spirits are being imported within a 24-hour period. Any person who is 21 years or older may produce up to 200 gallons of beer or wine per year. No permit is required, but any brewing or winemaking must take place at a private home or non-commercial property, and any beer and wine produced cannot be sold. It is a criminal offense to possess an unregistered still, or <b>distill</b> any amount of hard liquor.|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} a methodology {{for evaluating the}} statistical performance of information distillation systems {{and apply it to}} a sim-ple illustrative example. (An information <b>distiller</b> provides written English responses to English queries based on automated searches/transcriptions/translations of English and foreign-language sources. The sources include written documents and sound tracks.) The evaluation methodology extracts information nuggets from the <b>distiller</b> response texts and gathers them into fuzzy equivalence classes called nugs. The methodology supports the usual performance metrics, such as recall and precision, as well as a new information-theoretic metric called proficiency, which measures how much information a <b>distiller</b> provides relative to all of the information provided by a col-lection of distillers working on a common query and corpora. Unlike previous evaluation techniques, the methodology evaluates the relevance, granularity, and redundancy of information nuggets explicitly. 1. Information Distillers An autonomous information <b>distiller</b> takeswritten queries as inputs, and in response, automatically gathers, transcribes, translates (if necessary), and <b>distills</b> relevant information frommultilingual text and speech sources.

25|$|Berlioz was {{especially}} taken with Shakespeare's ability {{to pinpoint the}} heart of a dramatic conflict and penetrating the secrets of intense love. These secrets, Berlioz suggested in the text of Roméo et Juliette the playwright took with him to heaven. Time and again through the years, Berlioz would <b>distill</b> the favorite image of a play and <b>distill</b> it into musical terms. Roméo et Juliette may have been the first. Later came The Tempest, King Lear, a funeral march for the final scene in Hamlet, the love scene for Les Troyens (which, some claim, Berlioz took from The Merchant of Venice), and Béatrice and Benedict.|$|E

40|$|A thermal {{distillation}} system {{utilizing a}} part of the thermal energy of biomass burned in a stove during cooking is proposed. The thermal energy is transported from the stove to the <b>distiller</b> by means of a heat pipe. The <b>distiller</b> is a vertical multiple-effect diffusion <b>distiller,</b> in which a number of parallel partitions in contact with saline-soaked wicks are set vertically with narrow gaps of air. A pilot experimental apparatus was constructed and tested with a single-effect and multiple-effect distillers to investigate primarily whether a heat pipe can transport thermal energy adequately from the stove to the <b>distiller.</b> It was found that the temperatures of the heated plate and the first partition of the <b>distiller</b> reached to about 100  °C and 90  °C, respectively, at steady state, showing that the heat pipe works sufficiently. The distilled water obtained was about 0. 75 and 1. 35  kg during the first 2  h of burning from a single-effect and multiple-effect distillers, respectively...|$|R
25|$|A {{range of}} local, low-tech {{solutions}} are {{being pursued by}} a number of companies. These efforts center around the use of solar power to <b>distill</b> water at temperatures slightly beneath that at which water boils. By developing the capability to purify any available water source, local business models could be built around the new technologies, accelerating their uptake. For example, bedouins from the town of Dahab in Egypt have installed AquaDania's WaterStillar, which uses a solar thermal collector measuring two square metres to <b>distill</b> from 40 to 60 litres per day from any local water source. This is five times more efficient than conventional stills and eliminates the need for polluting plastic PET bottles or transportation of water supply.|$|E
25|$|Phenomenological models: <b>distill</b> the {{functional}} and distributional shapes from observed {{patterns in the}} data, or researchers decide on functions and distribution that are flexible enough to match the patterns they or others (field or experimental ecologists) have found in the field or through experimentation.|$|E
25|$|The {{distillery}} {{was also}} becoming quite {{popular with the}} locals at this time. Mid-summer in 1858 marked the opening Walker’s whisky operation.

40|$|Abstract The {{experimental}} study on a solar <b>distiller</b> {{was carried out}} in our laboratory. The experimental <b>distiller</b> includes two condensing surfaces. The first one is a glass cooled by a free air, the second surface is, made of aluminum and cooled by water. The other walls are thermally isolated. The obtained results allowed us to identify the humid air flow regime inside the <b>distiller,</b> to evaluate the mean heat and mass exchange coefficients, and write some correlations for the Sherwood and Nusselt Numbers. A theoretical model is established to simulate the <b>distiller.</b> It is written {{on the basis of the}} global balance equations. A stagnant zone in the <b>distiller</b> was observed and inserted into the model. All the obtained numerical results are in good agreement with those of the experimental ones. In the range of low temperatures, the proposed model can be used in many modeling applications such as small units of solar distillation, solar dryers, agricultural greenhouses and others...|$|R

25|$|In a kugelrohr a {{short path}} {{distillation}} apparatus is typically used (generally {{in combination with}} a (high) vacuum) to <b>distill</b> high boiling (> 300°C) compounds.

The vacuum is normally generated by using a high vacuum pump.|$|E
25|$|Another common {{variation}} was to <b>distill</b> in {{the presence}} of sulphuric acid. Although the acid itself does not distil, it imparts the additional aroma of diethyl ether to the resulting gin. Sulphuric acid subtracts one water molecule from two ethanol molecules to create diethyl ether, which also forms an azeotrope with ethanol, and therefore distils with it. The result is a sweeter spirit, and one that may have possessed additional analgesic or even intoxicating effects – see Paracelsus.|$|E
