50|$|Fire {{resistance}} of varying degrees {{can be achieved}} by several methods. Standard production hollow wall block will offer little fire resistance; however, resistance is improved by utilising specially produced hollow blocks with thicker sidewalls, or the inclusion of a special layer of <b>fire</b> <b>resisting</b> material between the two halves of the block during manufacture. Some manufacturers of glass blocks have developed a method of bonding two glass blocks together with adhesive, producing blocks of up to 160 mm (6½") thick with enhanced fire resistance. It is important that the block manufacturer's recommendations are followed with regards to the installation of <b>fire</b> <b>resisting</b> glass block walls, as without special construction techniques, the wall will not achieve the desired fire resistance.|$|E

50|$|For example, in the United Kingdom a <b>fire</b> <b>resisting</b> doorset {{should be}} {{subjected}} to either a British Standard Fire Test BS 476 Part 22 1987, or a BS/EN 1634-1 2000 test. The results are recorded by the test agency and provided in a report which detail such things as constructional details, distortion data and pressure readings. The numerical fire resistance rating that is required to be installed in a particular building is provided in the Building Regulations approved Document B, or British Standards such as the BS 5588 series (e.g., 30 minutes FD30, or FD30(S) if cold smoke resistance is also required).|$|E

Clearly the fire regulations specified here fall short of any requirement to state life saving requirements of fire spread by external cladding, cladding specification is entirely dependent on type of building construction combined with fire strategy dictated by the local fire officer, all is very ambiguous and clearly needs some serious changes to effect a fire resistant building, only apparent since the Grenfell Tower fire.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. When fire {{occurs in}} a {{concrete}} structure, {{it is hard to}} extinguish it because of its unique form and location, which results in a very high internal temperature of the maximum 1400 ℃. Due to the fine structural characteristic of concrete, the structure is likely to suffer fatal damages such as the reduction of resisting force and the damages to the cross section caused by explosive fracture. In this research, the author tested the effect of fire on structures by using fire boards with perlite-added silicone and confirmed that the <b>fire</b> <b>resisting</b> capacity varies according to the weight ratio of the addition agent, which shows what effect perlite has for the pyrolysis process. A <b>fire</b> <b>resisting</b> capacity test was also carried out by attaching a silicone composite fire board to a real size specimen. As a result of the test carried out by installing the fire boards with different thickness by section, most fire boards had excellent <b>fire</b> <b>resisting</b> capacity, and fire boards with 20 mm or more thickness had also excellent <b>fire</b> <b>resisting</b> capacity...|$|E
40|$|There are {{proposals}} on using <b>fire</b> <b>resisting</b> construction and structural elements with fire resistance ratings {{lower than the}} values specified in the fire codes. The equal temperature-time exposure concept or t-equivalent rule is commonly applied to support the argument. However, there are concerns in applying such an approach for bigger fires as the radiative heat flux acting on the construction element is not included. Fire hazard assessment on that should be watched. This is a short note on discussing possible problems associated with <b>fire</b> <b>resisting</b> construction with lower ratings.

40|$|Performance-based {{design is}} {{commonly}} applied to projects that have difficulties in complying with prescriptive fire codes in the Far East. There are procedures for evaluating <b>fire</b> <b>resisting</b> construction and structural elements with fire resistance ratings {{lower than the}} values specified in the fire codes. The equal temperature-time exposure concept or t -equivalent rule is commonly applied to support the argument. This paper will discuss whether installing two fire shutters each of a 2 -hour fire resistance period is equivalent to one 4 -hour shutter. The standard temperature-time curve under ASTM E 119 was applied to show they are not equivalent and to illustrate the inadequacy. Further, there are concerns in applying such an approach for bigger fires as the radiative heat flux acting on the construction element is not included. Fire hazard assessment on <b>fire</b> <b>resisting</b> construction with lower ratings under postflashover fires should be evaluated with caution. Full-scale burning tests with bigger fires are suggested {{as a means to}} support the argument or demonstrate that the equal temperature-time concept would work as expected.

40|$|Many modern {{fire safety}} codes for {{building}} structures use either a prescriptive approach or a performance-based approach. It is widely recognised that performance-based approaches provide great advantages over prescriptive approaches as they allow designers to use rational fire engineering methods to assess structural fire safety. However, performance assessments of entire structures are not straightforward, so {{the majority of}} modern fire codes still adopt either a prescriptive approach {{or a combination of}} prescriptive and performance-based approaches. In Hong Kong, the prescriptive approach is still widely regarded as the fundamental method assuring <b>fire</b> <b>resisting</b> construction, and assuring building compartmentation. However, there is growing interest in the practical application of structural fire engineering, and with this technique, it is essential to recognise that the key feature for implementing performance-based structural fire engineering is the assessment of a structure's fire resistance under specific fire exposures. This paper presents an overview of well established analysis methods for the assessment of building structure fire resistance. All the basic principles of these methods are presented and discussed through their application in assessing the performance of composite slabs under fire. Structural engineers are strongly recommended to recognise and acquire the skills of fire resistant design so that they can proactively contribute to <b>fire</b> <b>resisting</b> construction in practice.

40|$|A {{drencher}} {{system might}} be installed to substitute <b>fire</b> <b>resisting</b> {{construction in the}} Far East. Whether the discharged water curtain (or screen) can block thermal radiation and prevent smoke spreading depends on the air voids or porosity. This can be visualized by taking photographs of the spray pattern. Eight nozzles commonly used in the industry were selected. Photographs of the water curtain discharged from the nozzles were taken with suitable optical arrangement. Results radicated that the water curtains discharged from the selected nozzles are not continuous water layers. There are many air voids inside. Therefore, only thermal radiation can be blocked, but not smoke. Department of Building Services Engineerin...|$|E
40|$|FOREWORD Fire/smoke {{resisting}} dampers {{represent a}} major method {{used in the}} United Kingdom and other countries to prevent fire and smoke from passing from one compartment to another through Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems. It is imperative that <b>fire</b> <b>resisting</b> dampers are adequately fire tested and are installed {{in accordance with the}} damper manufacturer’s instructions. Such instructions must take into account site conditions and the variable order of different trades from contract to contract. This document attempts to provide practical advice so that damper manufacturers, system designers and installers are able to consider the appropriate issues and at the design stage, to make the necessary decisions to ensure that dampers will function as intended by current regulations...|$|E
