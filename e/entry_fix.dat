The flight path is divided into several descent and deceleration segments. Results for {{the case of a}} B- 737 airliner indicate that wind and nonstandard atmospheric properties {{have a significant effect on}} the flight path and must be taken into account. While a range of combinations of Mach number and calibrated airspeed is possible for the descent segments leading to the metering fix, only small changes in the fuel consumed were observed for this range of combinations.

40|$|The {{influence}} of several parameters {{on the time}} required to fly a nominal profile descent of a B- 737 from an <b>entry</b> <b>fix</b> to a metering fix 75 n. mi. away was studied. The ground distance for the constant speed segment was adjusted in each case so that the aircraft would always arrive at the metering fix position at the completion of the five segments of the profile descent. The {{influence of}} eight parameters on the same nominal profile descent is outlined, but the method used for the off nominal cases was changed. The time calculated for the constant speed segment in the nominal case is used for all off nominal cases. This method allows the aircraft to arrive at the metering fix before or after the profile descent is complete. It is shown that descent Mach number and wind speed have a large effect on the time error, whereas weight was a much smaller effect...|$|E
40|$|Concepts to save fuel while {{preserving}} airport capacity by combining time based metering with profile descent procedures were developed. A computer algorithm is developed {{to provide the}} flight crew with the information needed to fly from an <b>entry</b> <b>fix</b> to a metering fix and arrive there at a predetermined time, altitude, and airspeed. The flight from the metering fix to an aim point near the airport was calculated. The flight path is divided into several descent and deceleration segments. Descents are performed at constant Mach numbers or calibrated airspeed, whereas decelerations occur at constant altitude. The time and distance associated with each segment are calculated from point mass equations of motion for a clean configuration with idle thrust. Wind and nonstandard atmospheric properties have a large effect on the flight path. It is found that uncertainty in the descent Mach number has a large effect on the predicted flight time. Of the possible combinations of Mach number and calibrated airspeed for a descent, only small changes were observed in the fuel consumed...|$|E

It argues that competition policy {{should strive to}} reduce <b>entry,</b> <b>fixed</b> and variable costs where that is technically feasible; reduce the costs of reallocating resources across firms and sectors; and foster tough price competition.

While Chile’s competition policies are not bad by international standards, there is con-siderable room for improvement. The government has ample discretion to affect competitive conditions in markets, many regulations soften price competition, bureaucratic red tape is still widespread, and economic analysis by antitrust authorities is generally of mediocre quality.

40|$|<b>Fixed</b> <b>entry</b> costs play an {{important}} role to explain the heterogeneity among exporters in terms of the geographical scope of their export activities. Yet, the existing literature has paid little attention to the nature and variation of such costs across different markets. This paper proposes a link between familiarity and <b>fixed</b> <b>entry</b> costs, such that (all else equal) the cost of entering a familiar market is lower than entering an unfamiliar one. A testable implication of this is that familiarity should primarily affect the extensive margin (number of exporters) of exports. This hypothesis is tested by estimating a gravity equation on a panel that describes Swedish firms’ exports to 150 destination countries over a period of seven years. The results are consistent with the hypothesis and show that the effect of familiarity on the volume of aggregate exports is primarily due to adjustments on the extensive margin. Adjustments on the extensive margin are large and {{have a significant impact on}} aggregate export volumes. The findings do not only help to clarify the nature and variation of <b>fixed</b> <b>entry</b> costs across destination markets: they also suggest a precise mechanism through which familiarity affects trade. international trade; <b>fixed</b> <b>entry</b> costs; transaction costs; gravity models; extensive margin; intensive margin; heterogeneous firms...|$|R

40|$|Wet {{scrubbers}} {{are used}} {{in a range of}} industries for exhaust gas cleaning and are the Australian sugar industry’s most effective means of removing dust from boiler flue gas, being responsible for significantly reducing its environmental footprint. In virtually all cases, the collection efficiency of wet scrubbers is high enough for boilers with them installed to comfortably comply with the dust emission limits set by environmental authorities. However, wet scrubbers often cause boiler operational problems such as excessive vibration, deposit build-up and wear of boiler induced draft fans due to water droplet carryover and reduced boiler steam output due to blockages in and/or around the scrubber. In some cases, blockages become so severe that a boiler has to be taken off line for scrubber cleaning. Sugar milling operations are adversely affected by the reduced throughput and/or factory stoppages caused by these problems. This paper describes modelling and experimental investigations carried out as part of a project that aims to improve the design and operation of the tangential <b>entry</b> <b>fixed</b> vane wet scrubbers that are widely used in the Australian sugar industry...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} model of fixing or {{patching}} a software problem after the product has been released in the market. Specifically, we model a software firm's trade-off in releasing a buggy product early and investments in fixing it later. Just as the marginal cost of producing software can be effectively zero, so can the marginal cost of repairing multiple copies of defective software by issuing patches. We show that due to the fixed cost nature of investments in patching, a software vendor has incentives to release a buggier product early and patch it later in a larger market. Thus, a software monopolist releases a product with fewer bugs but later than what is socially optimal. We contrast this result with physical good markets where market size does not play any role in quality provision. We also show that for comparable costs, a software monopolist releases the product with more bugs but invests more in post-patching support later than the physical good monopolist. patching, software quality, time of <b>entry,</b> <b>fixed</b> costs, software bugs...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{proposes a}} model to {{investigate}} the influences of agglomeration on heterogeneous firms' exporting behaviors. Competition and thus selection effect caused by agglomeration forces less productive firms to exit the market while agglomeration externalities increase firms' productivity and decreases industrial <b>fixed</b> <b>entry,</b> <b>fixed</b> and variable exporting costs, and effective labor wage. The former factors decrease while the latter increase firms' exporting possibilities and sales. The model shows that the composite effect of agglomeration on firms' exports takes on a Parabola-shape pattern. Moreover, higher-productivity firms benefit more export premium from agglomeration, which explains why larger and more productive firms in larger cities are more possible to export and exports more. Empirical results {{based on data from}} Chinese Industrial Enterprises between 1998 and 2007 verify the theoretical results. The paper also investigates the influences of different agglomeration patterns on firms exports, including home market effect, urban economies and competition effect and diversification effect. It shows that the former two patterns exert a positive while the latter two have a positive influence on firms' exporting behaviors. ...|$|R

40|$|Supply chains often {{consist of}} several tiers, with {{different}} numbers of firms competing at each tier. A major determinant {{of the structure}} of supply chains is the cost structure associated with the underlying manufacturing process. In this paper, we examine the impact of fixed and variable costs on the structure and competitiveness of supply chains with a serial structure and price-sensitive linear deterministic demand. The entry stage is modeled as a simultaneous game, where the players take the outcomes of the subsequent post-entry (Cournot) competition into account in making their entry decisions. We derive expressions for prices and production quantities as functions of the number of entrants at each tier of a multitier chain. We characterize viability and stability of supply-chain structures and show, using lattice arguments, that there is always an equilibrium structure in pure strategies in the entry game. Finally, we examine the effects of vertical integration in the two-tier case. Altogether, the paper provides a framework for comparing a variety of supply-chain structures and for studying how they are affected by cost structures and by the number of entrants throughout the chain.

40|$|The {{engineering}} {{design of a}} particle detector is usually performed in a Computer Aided Design (CAD) program, and simulation of the detector's performance {{can be done with}} a Geant 4 -based program. However, transferring the detector design from the CAD program to Geant 4 can be laborious and error-prone. SW 2 GDML is a tool that reads a design in the popular SOLIDWORKS CAD program and outputs Geometry Description Markup Language (GDML), used by Geant 4 for importing and exporting detector geometries. Other methods for outputting CAD designs are available, such as the STEP format, and tools exist to convert these formats into GDML. However, these conversion methods produce very large and unwieldy designs composed of tessellated solids that can reduce Geant 4 performance. In contrast, SW 2 GDML produces compact, human-readable GDML that employs standard geometric shapes rather than tessellated solids. This paper will describe the development and current capabilities of SW 2 GDML and plans for its enhancement. The aim of this tool is to automate importation of detector engineering models into Geant 4 -based simulation programs to support rapid, iterative cycles of detector design, simulation, and optimization.
