40|$|The main {{objective}} of this research paper is to estimate the new-ice production in the Laptev Sea <b>flaw</b> <b>lead</b> during the 1991 / 1992 winter season. A one-dimensional energy balance model was applied to calculate ocean-to-atmosphere heat flux and the resulting new-ice formation over open water. For a detailed estimate of regional ice production, the <b>flaw</b> <b>lead</b> was divided into 14 sections based on the analysis of NOAA-satellite images and Russian ice charts. Opening and maintenance of the lead sections are controlled by offshore winds, whereas closing of open water is caused by onshore winds. Since {{the orientation of the}} lead varies from section to section, the same regional wind forcing can cause different local lead behavior. Model results reveal that the seasonally accumulated thickness of new ice formed in the different lead sections—under the assumption of instantaneous lateral new-ice removal from the water surface—varies from 1. 3 m to 13 m over temporarily open water and may reach 20 m over permanently open water. The corresponding ice volume produced in the sections varies between 3. 4 km 3 and 59 km 3 and amounts to 258 km 3 for the entire lead. The significant regional variations in new-ice production are due to differences in (i) the number of days that a lead section is open (open-lead days), (ii) the oceanic heat loss during open-lead days, and (iii) the areal extent of the lead sections. As compared to other studies,—at least during 1991 / 1992 winter season—the Laptev Sea <b>flaw</b> <b>lead</b> produced between 28 and 617 % more initial sea ice than the Kara, Barents, East Siberian and Chukchi leads. Despite its limited areal extent of roughly 36, 000 km 2, which represents only 8 % of the entire Laptev Sea, the <b>flaw</b> <b>lead</b> produces about 32 % of the annual shelf ice. The ice production in the <b>flaw</b> <b>lead</b> is 5. 3 times higher than the remainder of the shelf (7. 4 m vs. 1. 4 m).

Photosynthesis-irradiance measurements were taken at 15 sites primarily from the depth of the subsurface chlorophyll a (Chl a) maximum (SCM) within the Beaufort Sea <b>flaw</b> <b>lead</b> polynya. The physiological response of phytoplankton to a range of light levels was used to assess maximum rates of carbon (C) fixation (P*m), photosynthetic efficiency (alpha*), photoacclimation (Ek), and photoinhibition (beta*). SCM samples taken along a transect from under ice into open water exhibited a > 3 -fold increase in alpha* and P*m, showing these parameters can vary substantially over relatively small spatial scales, primarily in response to changes in the ambient light field. Algae were able to maintain relatively high rates of C fixation despite low light at the SCM, particularly in the large (> 5 µm) size fraction at open water sites. This may substantially impact biogenic C drawdown if species composition shifts in response to future climate change. Our results suggest that phytoplankton in this region are well acclimated to existing environmental conditions, including sea ice cover, low light, and nutrient pulses. Furthermore, this photoacclimatory response can be rapid and keep pace with a developing SCM, as phytoplankton maintain photosynthetic rates and efficiencies in a narrow ''shade-acclimated'' range...|$|E

We use this significant dataset to investigate the halo-thermodynamic evolution of sea ice from growth to melt. A strong desalination phase is observed over a small time window in the spring. Using calculated proxies of sea-ice permeability (brine volume fraction) and of the intensity of brine convection (Rayleigh number) we demonstrate that this phase corresponds to full-depth gravity drainage initiated by a restored connectivity of the brine network with warming in the spring. Most stations had a textural sequence typical of Arctic first-year ice, with granular ice overlying columnar ice. Unusual textural features were observed sporadically: sandwiched granular ice, platelet ice and draped platelet ice.

40|$|We used holes augered {{partially}} into first-year sea ice (sumps) {{to determine}} a- and g-HCH concentrations in sea-ice brine. The overwintering of the CCGS Amundsen in the Canadian western Arctic, {{as part of}} the Circumpolar <b>Flaw</b> <b>Lead</b> (CFL) System Study, provided the circumstances to allow brine to accumulate in sumps sufficiently to test the methodology. We show, for the first time, that as much as 50 % of total HCHs in seawater can become entrapped within the ice crystal matrix. On average, in the winter first-year sea ice HCH brine concentrations reached 4. 013 ± 0. 307 ng/L and 0. 423 ± 0. 013 ng/L for the a- and g-isomer, respectively. In the spring, HCHs decreased gradually with time, with increasing brine volume fraction and decreasing brine salinity. These decreasing concentrations could be accounted for by both the dilution with the ice crystal matrix and under-ice seawater. We propose that the former process plays a more significant role considering brine volume fractions calculated in this study were below 20 %. Levels of HCHs in the brine exceed under-ice water concentrations by approximately a factor of 3, a circumstance suggesting that the brine ecosystem has been, and continues to be, the most exposed to HCHs...|$|E

Lack of knowledge of sea-ice assemblages during the dark period has left questions about the retention and survival of protist species that initiate the ice algal bloom. Sea-ice and surface water samples were collected between December 27, 2007 and January 31, 2008 within the Cape Bathurst <b>flaw</b> <b>lead,</b> Canadian Beaufort Sea.

The diversity of winter ice protists (134 taxa) was comparable to spring ice assemblages. Pennate diatoms dominated the winter protist assemblage numerically (averaging 77 % of total protist abundances), with Nitzschia frigida being the most abundant species.

This study investigated the impacts of the variability in timing and extent of the ice algal bloom on the reproduction and population success of C. glacialis. The vertical distribution, reproduction, amount of storage lipids, stable isotopes, fatty acid and fatty alcohol composition of C. glacialis were assessed during the Circumpolar <b>Flaw</b> <b>Lead</b> System Study.

Developmental stages CIII and CIV dominated the overwintering population, which resulted in the presence of very few CV and females during spring 2008. Spawning began at the peak of the ice algal bloom that preceded the precocious May ice break-up.

As part of the International Polar Year-Circumpolar <b>Flaw</b> <b>Lead</b> system study (IPY-CFL), this investigation quantified zooplankton in the meltwater layer below landfast ice and remaining ice fauna below melting ice during June (2008) in Franklin Bay and Darnley Bay, Amundsen Gulf, Canada. The ice {{was in a state}} of advanced melt, with fully developed melt ponds. Intense melting resulted in a 0. 3 - to 0. 5 -m-thick meltwater layer below the ice, with a strong halocline to the Arctic water below. Zooplankton under the ice, in and below the meltwater layer, was sampled by SCUBA divers. Dense concentrations (max. 1, 400 ind. /m** 3) of Calanus glacialis were associated with the meltwater layer, with dominant copepodid stages CIV and CV and high abundance of nauplii. Less abundant species included Pseudocalanus spp., Oithona similis and C. hyperboreus. The copepods were likely feeding on phytoplankton (0. 5 - 2. 3 mg Chl-a/m** 3) in the meltwater layer. Ice amphipods were present at low abundance (< 10 ind. /m** 2) and wet biomass (< 0. 2 g/m** 2). Onisimus glacialis and Apherusa glacialis made up 64 and 51 % of the total ice faunal abundance in Darnley Bay and Franklin Bay, respectively.

40|$|Due to the physico-chemical {{conditions}} given, i. e. {{the high}} salinity and the icy matrix, sea ice as habitat favors production of {{high levels of}} dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) by the inhabiting microalgae. DMSP and DMS (dimethylsulfide) are frequently found in high concentrations in sea ice during spring and summer. Records from winter are yet scarce, but of importance for global budgeting. Our study presents profiles of the DMS(P) in sea ice cores collected during the AWECS (Antarctic Winter Ecosytem Climate Study) cruise on RV Polarstern (ANT 29 - 6) in the Weddell Sea. Results show that DMS(P) production in sea ice in the Weddell Sea is also significant during winter. This stands in contrast to previous measurements in Arctic winter sea ice (CFL-IPY cruise in the Circumpolar <b>Flaw</b> <b>Lead</b> Polynya), where DMS(P) concentrations were very low. Possible explanations for the differences between DMS(P) levels in the Arctic and Antarctic might be the different snow cover and thus insulation, light regimes and also microbial community structure within the ice. The DMS profiles mirrored the permeability of the sea ice following DMSP in the impermeable areas while showing losses to the ice surface and ice-water interface in the more permeable regions.

Investigations were performed on first-year ice from three pack- and three fast-ice stations. Additionally, 5 -cm bottom-ice sections were sampled at 13 pack-ice and 5 fast-ice stations. The metazoan community was composed of nematodes, rotifers, copepods, copepod nauplii, platyhelminthes and a few rare taxa such as mollusks, cnidarians and nemerteans. High numbers of eggs, between 50 and 2, 188 eggs L - 1, particularly of nematodes and copepods, {{were present in the}} ice. Investigations revealed also eggs of the pelagic species Calanus hyperboreus and Sagitta spp. within the ice, so that {{further research is needed to}} clarify whether more organisms than expected might use this habitat as a reproduction ground. Many different morphotypes of protozoans were observed in the samples, especially ciliates of the order Euplotida. The highest abundance was always found in the lowermost 5 cm of the ice cores, nevertheless sympagic meiofauna was not restricted to that part of the ice. Integrated meiofauna abundance ranged between 41 and 4, 738 Ã 10 2 Ind. m - 2 and was highest in the fast ice in early May.
