2500|$|For {{some time}} the Duke {{and his colleagues}} {{had been looking for}} a way out of their difficulty, by which they could save themselves, satisfy public clamor and yet avoid {{responsibility}} before history. Bazaine stated in his defence [...] "I have graven on my chest two words - Honneur et Patrie. They have guided me for the whole of my military career. I have never failed that noble motto, no more at Metz than anywhere else during the forty-two years that I have loyally served France. I swear it here, before Christ". Despite a vigorous defence of Bazaine's actions by Lachaud, and the presentation of a number of strong witness statements from his staff including Colonel Willette, the court found Bazaine guilty of negotiating with and capitulating to the enemy before doing all that was prescribed by duty and honour. It was clear even to the most partial observer, that the verdict bore very little relation to the evidence. For example, the Marshal surrendered only after receiving letters recommending him to do so from his generals, but the presentation of these at the trial was ignored. [...] "I have read every word of the evidence [...] and believe it to be the most malicious casuistry" [...] (New York Times correspondent). A letter which Prince Frederick Charles wrote in Bazaine's favour only added to the wrath of the people, who cried aloud for his execution. The court sentenced Bazaine to 'degradation and death', and to pay the costs of the enormous trial (300,000 francs), which was to leave the Marshal's young family penniless. [...] Bazaine's reaction on being read the sentence of the court was [...] "It is my life you want, take it at once, let me be shot immediately, but preserve my family". Since the Revolution, only two French Marshals have been condemned to death — Ney, by a Bourbon, and Bazaine, by an Orléans. But, as though the judges themselves <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> <b>twinge</b> <b>of</b> conscience at the sentence, they immediately and unanimously signed a petition for 'Executive Clemency' to the President of the Third Republic, Marshal MacMahon, although Bazaine refused to sign this petition himself.|$|E

60|$|When Sim Burns woke {{the next}} morning he <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> sharper <b>twinge</b> <b>of</b> remorse.

Little Pet lay with the warm June sunshine filling his baby eyes, curiously content in striking at flies that buzzed around his little mouth.|$|R
60|$|Old Silas Croft was {{to drive}} her with Bessie, who wished to do some {{shopping}} in Wakkerstroom, as ladies sometimes will; {{but at the last}} moment the old man <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> premonitory <b>twinge</b> <b>of</b> the rheumatism to which he was a martyr, and could not go. So, of course, John volunteered, and, though Jess raised some difficulties, Bessie furthered the idea, and in the end his offer was accepted.|$|R
60|$|It was the {{conclusion}} I arrived at {{in my own}} mind. But just why I had been chosen for the honour, especially at such a time, was a riddle. Jerry's invitations were charily given, and valued accordingly; and more than once, at our table, I had <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> <b>twinge</b> <b>of</b> envy when Conybear or someone else had remarked, with the proper nonchalance, in answer to a question, {{that they were going}} to Weathersfield. Such was the name of the Kyme place....|$|E
60|$|Sadly {{dismounting}} I led {{him back}} to the stable. It was evident that he would never again career with me across the hills. Bowed and dejected he resumed his place in the paddock. Standing thus, with hanging head, he appeared to be dreaming of the days when {{as a part of the}} round-up, in the far Northwest, he had carried his master over the range and through the herd with joyous zeal. Each time I looked at him I <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> <b>twinge</b> <b>of</b> pain.|$|E
60|$|Frank <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> <b>twinge</b> <b>of</b> disappointment. Bannington's {{was still}} a good way off, {{and it seemed to}} him that the gale was {{increasing}} every moment. He scrambled forward with Harry, however, and when they loosened the rope the tall peak of the sail swung down. Soon after they had done this Mr. Oliver put down his helm, causing the mainboom to jerk and thrash to and fro furiously, while as the boat came up head to wind a white sea struck her side and foamed on board her.|$|E
60|$|The Dyak boy {{was beating}} up an egg in brandy. Woodhouse took this and sat up. He <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> sharp <b>twinge</b> <b>of</b> pain. His ankle was tied up, so were {{his arm and}} {{the side of his}} face. The smashed glass, red-stained, lay about the floor, the {{telescope}} seat was overturned, and by the opposite wall was a dark pool. The door was open, and he saw the grey summit of the mountain against a brilliant background of blue sky.|$|R
60|$|Her room gave on {{one side}} of the sitting room, and her father's on the other. She waited until Colonel Harris went away, having helped him on with his overcoat. After he left she <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> little <b>twinge</b> <b>of</b> remorse. The night was cold and raw and he really had not wanted to go out. He would have been quite willing to sit in front of the fire, smoking and reading. He had only gone because his own innate kindliness and tact had {{suggested}} to him that Louisa wished to remain alone.|$|R
60|$|He <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> {{momentary}} <b>twinge</b> <b>of</b> selfishness. Yet, after all, {{the great}} truths were incontrovertible. He could lighten her lot but little. There {{was very little}} of himself that he could give her--of his youth, his strength, his vigorous hold upon life. Through all the tangle of his expanding interests in existence, the medley of strange happenings in which he found himself involved, one thing alone was clear. He was passing on into a life making larger demands upon, him, a life in which their companionship must naturally become a slighter thing. Nevertheless, he spoke to her reassuringly.|$|R
60|$|As Norman of Torn rode {{back to his}} grim {{castle in}} the hills of Derby, he had much food for thought upon the way. Never till now had he {{realized}} what might lie in another manner of life, and he <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> <b>twinge</b> <b>of</b> bitterness toward the hard, old man whom he called father, and whose teachings from the boy's earliest childhood had guided him in the ways that had cut him off completely from the society of other men, except the wild horde of outlaws, ruffians and adventurers that rode beneath the grisly banner of the young chief of Torn.|$|E
60|$|Somerset, as they proceeded, {{pointed out}} where roofs {{had been and}} should be again, where gables had been pulled down, and where floors had vanished, showing her how to {{reconstruct}} their details from marks in the walls, much as a comparative anatomist reconstructs an antediluvian from fragmentary bones and teeth. She appeared to be interested, listened attentively, but said little in reply. They were ultimately in a long narrow passage, indifferently lighted, when Somerset, treading on a loose stone, <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> <b>twinge</b> <b>of</b> weakness in one knee, and knew in a moment {{that it was the}} result of the twist given by his yesterday's fall. He paused, leaning against the wall.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am trying}} my best," [...] said the cosmopolitan, still calmly companionable. [...] "A moment since, we talked of Pizarro, gold, and Peru; no doubt, now, you {{remember}} that when the Spaniard first entered Atahalpa's treasure-chamber, and saw such profusion of plate stacked up, right and left, with the wantonness of old barrels in a brewer's yard, the needy fellow <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> <b>twinge</b> <b>of</b> misgiving, of want of confidence, as to the genuineness of an opulence so profuse. He went about rapping the shining vases with his knuckles. But it was all gold, pure gold, good gold, sterling gold, which how cheerfully would have been stamped such at Goldsmiths' Hall. And just so those needy minds, which, through their own insincerity, having no confidence in mankind, doubt lest the liberal geniality of this age be spurious. They are small Pizarros in their way--by the very princeliness of men's geniality stunned into distrust of it." ...|$|E
6000|$|Eustacia bounded {{into the}} vehicle {{and sat on the}} stool, ensconced from view on the side towards the trackway. Soon she heard the {{brushing}} of other feet than the reddleman's, a not very friendly [...] "Good day" [...] uttered by two men in passing each other, and then the dwindling of the footfall of one of them in a direction onwards. Eustacia stretched her neck forward till she caught a glimpse of a receding back and shoulders; and she <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> wretched <b>twinge</b> <b>of</b> misery, she knew not why. It was the sickening feeling which, if the changed heart has any generosity at all in its composition, accompanies the sudden sight of a once-loved one who is beloved no more.|$|R
50|$|According to {{the views}} of scholars, {{especially}} Muhammad Khawja Bukhari in his book Fasl-ul-Khetab, Hamidah the daughter of Muhammad al-Jawad, the ninth Shia Imam, and the aunt of Hasan al-Askari, used to pray a lot to witness the son of Hasan al-Askari. On the eve of 14 Sha'ban in 255 AH she met Hasan al-Askari. When she decided to return, Hasan al-Askari asked her to stay with {{them in order to}} witness the birth of the child whom she wished so much to see. Hamidah narrates that when it was the dawn, Nargis <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> sudden <b>twinge</b> <b>of</b> pain. Hakima went to her. After a few moments, Narjis delivered the child. Hakima embraced the child and brought him to Hasan al-Askari. He took the child in his arms and he stroked his back and his eyes. Then he said aloud Adhan (call to prayer) in his right ear and Iqama (the second call to prayer) in his left ear.|$|R

60|$|Hereupon {{a glorious}} shouting, a rapping, a jingling, a clattering, and a shouting, with {{plentiful}} da capo, pleasanter than {{a strain of}} sublimest music in the ears that receive such a tribute for the first time. Arthur had <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> <b>twinge</b> <b>of</b> conscience during Mr. Poyser's speech, {{but it was too}} feeble to nullify the pleasure he felt in being praised. Did he not deserve what was said of him on the whole? If there was something in his conduct that Poyser wouldn't have liked if he had known it, why, no man's conduct will bear too close an inspection; and Poyser was not likely to know it; and, after all, what had he done? Gone a little too far, perhaps, in flirtation, but another man in his place would have acted much worse; and no harm would come--no harm should come, for the next time he was alone with Hetty, he would explain to her that she must not think seriously of him or of what had passed. It was necessary to Arthur, you perceive, to be satisfied with himself. Uncomfortable thoughts must be got rid of by good intentions for the future, which can be formed so rapidly that he had time to be uncomfortable and to become easy again before Mr. Poyser's slow speech was finished, and {{when it was time for}} him to speak he was quite light-hearted.|$|E

I have not yet received the package you sent me but the mail situation here is kind of rough and I will just have to sweat it out. Well it is Xmas Eve here and it is a lot different than the one we would have at home. Over here the people are of a different religion than we are and do not celebrate Xmas. We have tried {{to make it look like}} Xmas here but with the hot weather and being away from home we just cannot get into the mood. I guess we will have to save it up until we get home. They are keeping us on the go all the time here and we are pretty busy. I have not met any of the fellows from Bryant since I have been over here but last year I met some of them in Africa. I guess we are scattered all over the globe and it sure will be a grand reunion when this mess is all cleaned up.

I sure <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> little <b>twinge</b> <b>of</b> homesickness when I read of the first smokers and the dances that you are holding but I hope to be back there someday to make up for lost time.

6000|$|When Edward Blandford {{found himself}} alone {{after his wife}} had {{undertaken}} to fulfil his abandoned filial duty at her parents' house, he <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> slight <b>twinge</b> <b>of</b> self-reproach. He could not deny {{that this was not}} the first time he had evaded the sterile Sabbath evenings at his mother-in-law's, or that even at other times he was not in accord with the cold and colorless sanctity of the family. Yet he remembered that when he picked out from the budding womanhood of North Liberty this pure, scentless blossom, he had endured the privations of its surroundings with a sense of security in inhaling the atmosphere in which it grew, and knowing the integrity of its descent. There was a certain pleasure also in invading this seclusion with human passion; the first pressure of her hand when they were kneeling together at family prayers had the zest without the sin of a forbidden pleasure; the first kiss he had given her with their heads over the family Bible had fairly intoxicated him in the thin, rarefied air of their surroundings. In transplanting this blossom to his own home with the fond belief that it would eventually borrow the hues and color of his own passion, he had no further interest in the house he had left behind. When he found, however, that the ancestral influence was stronger than he expected, that the young wife, instead of assimilating to his conditions, had imported into their little household the rigors of her youthful home, he had been chilled and disappointed. But he could not help also remembering that his own boyhood had been spent in an atmosphere like her own in everything but its sincerity and deep conviction. His father had recognized the business value of placating the narrow tyranny of the respectable well-to-do religious community, and had become a conscious hypocrite and a popular citizen. He had himself been under that influence, and it was partly a conviction of this that had drawn him towards her as something genuine and real. It occurred to him now for the first time, as he looked around upon that compromise of their two lives in this chilly artificial home, that it was only natural that she would prefer the more truthful austerities of her mother's house. Had she detected the sham, and did she despise him for it? ...|$|R
60|$|As {{he walked}} away toward his hotel he amused himself with the {{conjecture}} whether he, with his forty-one years and his hundred and eighty five pounds, were not still a pathetic and even a romantic figure to this pretty and kindly woman, who probably imagined him as heart-broken as ever. He was very willing {{to see more of}} her, if she wished; but with the rain beginning to fall more thick and chill in the darkening street, he could have postponed their next meeting till a pleasanter evening without great self-denial. He <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> little <b>twinge</b> <b>of</b> rheumatism in his shoulder when he got into his room, for your room in a Florentine hotel is always some degrees colder than outdoors, unless you have fire in it; and with the sun shining on his windows when he went out after lunch, it had seemed to Colville ridiculous to have his morning fire kept up. The sun was what he had taken the room for. It was in it, the landlord assured him, from ten in the morning till four in the afternoon; and so, in fact, it was, when it shone; but even then it was not fully in it, but had a trick of looking in at the sides of the window, and painting the chamber wall with a delusive glow. Colville raked away the ashes of his fire-place, and throwing on two or three fagots of broom and pine sprays, he had a blaze that would be very pretty to dress by after dinner, but that gave out no warmth for the present. He left it, and went down to the reading-room, as it was labelled over the door, in homage to a predominance of English-speaking people among the guests; but there was no fire there; that was kindled only by request, and he shivered at the bare aspect of the apartment, with its cold piano, its locked bookcases, and its table, where the London Times, the Neue Freie Presse of Vienna, and the Italie of Rome exposed their titles, one just beyond the margin of the other. He turned from the door and went into the dining-room, where the stove was ostentatiously roaring over its small logs and its lozenges of peat, But even here the fire had been so recently lighted that the warmth was potential rather than actual. By stooping down before the stove, and pressing his shoulder against its brass doors, Colville managed to lull his enemy, while he studied the figures of the woman-headed, woman-breasted hounds developing into vines and foliage that covered the frescoed trellising of the quadrangularly vaulted ceiling. The waiters, in their veteran dress-coats, were putting the final touches to the table, and the sound of voices outside the door obliged Colville to get up. The effort involved made him still more reluctant about going out to Mrs. Bowen's.|$|R

Life went back to normal for all the Bryants, but Sarah still <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> <b>twinge</b> <b>of</b> uncertainty. Even though she has recovered, she {{remember}}ed all the bad things she had done while under the Organization's control. Worst of all, she remembers trying to kill Jacky. She is also unable to remember clearly enough if the desire to do it was a result of J6's brainwashing, or if it was part of her own wishes all along. When she finds out that Jacky intends to join the fourth tournament, she decides to do so as well, so that she can beat Jacky and resolve matters once and for all.|$|E

When he met Clinton in 1993 Hartman remarked, [...] "I guess I owe you a few apologies", adding later that he [...] "sometimes <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> <b>twinge</b> <b>of</b> guilt about Clinton impression". Clinton showed good humor and sent Hartman a signed photo with the text: [...] "You're not the president, but you play one on TV. And you're OK, mostly." [...] For his Clinton impression, Hartman copied the president's [...] "post-nasal drip" [...] and the [...] "slight scratchiness" [...] in his voice, {{as well as his}} open, [...] "less intimidating" [...] hand gestures. Hartman opted against wearing a larger prosthetic nose when portraying Clinton, as he felt it would be distracting. He instead wore a wig, dyed his eyebrows brighter and used makeup to highlight his nose. One of Hartman's more famous sketches as Clinton saw the president visit a McDonald's restaurant and explain his policies by eating other customers' food. The writers told him that he was not eating enough during rehearsals for the sketch - {{by the end of the}} live performance, Hartman had eaten so much he could barely speak.Backstage at SNL, Hartman was called [...] "the Glue", a name coined by Adam Sandler, according to Jay Mohr's book Gasping for Airtime. However, according to a biography on Hartman's life entitled You Might Remember Me: The Life and Times of Phil Hartman written by Mike Thomas, author and staff writer for the Chicago Sun-Times, the nickname was created by SNL cast member and Hartman's frequent on-screen collaborator Jan Hooks. Hartman often helped other cast members. For example, he aided Jan Hooks in overcoming her stage fright. SNL creator Lorne Michaels explained the reason for the name: [...] "He kind of held the show together. He gave to everybody and demanded very little. He was very low-maintenance." [...] Michaels also added that Hartman was [...] "the least appreciated" [...] cast member by commentators outside the show, and praised his ability [...] "to do five or six parts in a show where you're playing support or you're doing remarkable character work". Hartman won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing for a Variety, Music or Comedy Program for SNL in 1989, sharing the award with the show's other writers. He was nominated in the same category in 1987, and individually in 1994 for Outstanding Individual Performance in a Variety or Music Program.|$|E
