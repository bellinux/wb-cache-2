40|$|<b>Elongate</b> <b>surgeonfish,</b> Acanthurus mata is a {{commercial}} fish targetting by local fishermen in Makassar Strait, South SulawesiThe study aims to analyze reproductive biology of <b>elongate</b> <b>surgeonfish</b> including., sex ratio, gonad maturity stage (GS), size at first maturity sexual, and gonad maturity index (GI). The specimens {{were collected from}} the fishermen. Total length and body-wet weight were measured for each specimen. Sex ratio was determined for each sampling period and the whole samples. Sex-ratio balance was examinede by using chi-square test to compare two means values. Gonad maturity stage was classified into five stages (immature, early development, developing, mature, and spawning). Size at first maturity sexual was esteemed by using Spearman-Karber method. Gonad maturity indexes were calculated by using the Johnson equation. The study revealed that: (1) the sex ratio of elongate surgeon for female and male fish was equal (1 : 1); (2) Gonad maturity Stage (GS) IV and V were abundant in October when the peak spawning season occurred, (3) size at the first maturity sexual at male and female were 263 mm and 271 mm, respectively, and (4) at the same GS, the Gonad maturity Index (GI) for female fish was bigger than at the male fish...|$|E
