They formed the first settled rural communities, thus forging the most fundamental civilizational advance.|$|E
5|$|The 1885 {{election}} {{in this district}} was held on September 17, 1885 {{as part of the}} 1885 Northwest Territories election. This was the first major election held in the Northwest Territories.

5|$|The Rhodesian {{pursued the}} He111 over the Saltdal valley and, with three attacks from astern, set the bomber ablaze, forcing it to crash. Hull then downed a Junkers Ju52 {{transport}} plane and, after unsuccessfully chasing another He111, destroyed two more Ju52s. The transports <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>coming</b> {{to the aid}} of the hard-pressed German forces fighting around Narvik; one was loaded with supplies, while the other two were carrying Fallschirmjäger paratroops. One of the latter aircraft successfully landed in German-held territory before burning out, allowing the crew and paratroopers aboard to exit safely, but the second spiralled out of control and crashed, killing eight German paratroopers. Hull then attacked another He111, which soon retreated, giving off smoke. Having used up all his ammunition, Hull returned to Bodø. In the space of about an hour, in a technologically-outdated aircraft and without assistance, he had destroyed four German planes and damaged a fifth.|$|E

5|$|On 28 June, {{helicopter}} gunships conducted dawn {{air strikes}} against insurgents who were attacking troops at the university campus. By this point, the city <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>coming</b> under continuous air strikes for three days, which included barrel bombs. An all-out ground offensive was launched during the day {{in an attempt to}} capture the city. A column of troops started out from Samarra towards Tikrit to the north and by sundown had reached the edge of the city. According to Lt. Gen. Ahmed Abu Ragheef, another column was directed towards the Camp Speicher air base. There were initial claims by government sources of capturing Tikrit, but in fact Tikrit itself remained under insurgent control as heavy fighting continued to rage on the city outskirts during the night. In the evening, helicopters struck a gathering of people preparing for a wedding ceremony in the village of Al Bu Hayazi, east of Tikrit, killing four civilians.|$|E

25|$|With his {{experience}} with the MCC, and his county success behind the stumps, Taylor <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>coming</b> to the notice of England captain Ray Illingworth. Though Knott was incumbent, Illingworth rewarded Taylor's patience with a Test cap. Taylor made his Test debut against New Zealand at Christchurch on 25 February 1971. In an eight-wicket England victory, he took two catches and a stumping, but scored only four runs before being stumped by his opposite number. His quiet debut escaped any reference in Wisdens match report. He did not play another match on the tour, and would not play another Test for six more years.|$|E
25|$|During this period, Stieglitz became {{increasingly}} intrigued {{with a more}} modern visual aesthetics for photography. He became aware {{of what was going}} on in avant-garde painting and sculpture and found that pictorialism no longer represented the future – it was the past. He was influenced in part by painter Charles Sheeler and by photographer Paul Strand. In 1915, Strand, who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>coming</b> to see shows at 291 for many years, introduced Stieglitz to a new photographic vision that was embodied by the bold lines of everyday forms. Stieglitz was one of the first to see the beauty and grace of Strand's style, and he gave Strand a major exhibit at 291. He also devoted almost the entire last issue of Camera Work to his photographs.|$|E

Shortly after the request for more public funding, District asked Marriott to cut the cost of the {{facility}} by reducing the number of rooms to about 1,000. Marriott agreed to build only 1,150 rooms, and to scrap the underground ballroom and meeting space (saving an estimated $100 million). Marriott and the city also resolved their dispute over the room set-aside for convention business. This issue <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>coming</b> to a conclusion since early 2007, when Mayor Fenty gave Marriott a take-it-or-leave-it offer to reserve 80 percent of the rooms for the convention center, so long as convention center business was booked three years in advance.

25|$|On 6 January 2006 Kennedy was {{informed}} that ITN would be reporting that he had received treatment for a drinking problem. He decided to pre-empt the broadcast, called a sudden news conference, and made a personal statement {{that over the past}} eighteen months he <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>coming</b> to terms with a drinking problem, but had sought professional help. He told reporters that recent questions among his colleagues about his suitability as leader were {{partly as a result of}} the drinking problem but stated that he had been dry for the past two months and would be calling a leadership contest, in which he would stand, to resolve the issues surrounding his authority once and for all. It was later claimed that the source for ITN's story was his former press secretary turned ITV News correspondent, Daisy McAndrew.|$|E
25|$|Richard Blandy, a constable, gave {{evidence}} that he <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>coming</b> from Drury-Lane house and that as he came by the piazzas in Covent Garden he heard two pistol shots and then heard somebody say two people were killed. Approaching, he saw the surgeon had Hackman and a pistol in his hand. A Mr Mahon had given Blandy the pistol {{and asked him to}} take care of the prisoner and to take him to Mahon's house. The prisoner was bloody, wounded in the head, and very faint. When Blandy came to the corner by the Red Lion, the door was shut, and he was then asked to take the prisoner back to the Shakspeare tavern, where Mr Mahon was. Blandy searched the prisoner's pocket and found two letters, which he gave to Mr Campbell, master of the Shakspeare tavern. He could say nothing else about the letters.|$|E
500|$|The {{basic concept}} behind [...] "Rush" [...] <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>coming</b> {{together}} since the sixth season.

He noted, [...] "it {{had been a long time}} since we had dealt with teenage angst. [...] it was being done everywhere else and we wanted to take a run at it." [...] David Amman, who wrote the episode, later explained that the original idea for the episode was simply [...] " [...] effect having the power of super speed would have on troubled teens." [...] However, the story quickly developed [...] "deeper" [...] meanings: drug abuse, boredom, and the teenage experience.|$|E

500|$|Robert Bianco of USA Today was {{critical}} of the episode, writing [...] "It is possible [...] has worn out the Treehouse franchise. [...] three installments just seem to be reaching for jokes that aren't there, and falling in the attempt. [...] As you'd hope from The Simpsons, the segments all boast a few clever moments {{that will make you}} smile if not laugh. But they're not scary, they're not particularly funny, and outside of some tepid Twilight jokes, they're no longer even trying to be real parodies of the original stories." [...] Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club also gave the episode a negative review, and felt that [...] "There were laughs in all three segments, but the episode as a whole left something to be desired. The first [...] eventually descended into a long string of mostly lame board game jokes, as if the writers <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>coming</b> up with board game puns for the last 15 seasons or something and wanted an excuse to unload a bunch of them all at once. The idea of Bart and Milhouse playing with a Ouija board ripoff was promising, so to see it descend into gags about Marge getting sucked into Clue was disappointing. There were fewer good gags [...] than in the board game segment, but it was balanced out by a fairly solid Hugh Laurie performance. Fortunately, the last segment, the inevitable Twilight parody, was funny across the board, both in how it took the piss out of the Twilight films and how it satirized vampire mania. [...] Still, it wasn't the best [...] "Treehouse" [...] ever, and you could make a good claim for it being the worst, particularly if the Twilight segment wasn't in there." ...|$|E

2500|$|Robert E.

After the famine was over the four following years produced more emigrants than during the four years of the blight.
