5|$|In {{the book}} and the lectures, Lewis argues that {{significant}} changes are required to meet the Millennium Development Goals in Africa by their 2015 deadline. Lewis explains the historical context of Africa since the 1980s, citing a succession of disastrous economic policies by international financial institutions that contributed to, rather than reduced, poverty. He connects the structural adjustment loans, with conditions of limited public spending on health and education infrastructure, to the uncontrolled spread of AIDS and subsequent food shortages as the disease infected much of the working-age population. Lewis also addresses such issues as <b>discrimination</b> <b>against</b> <b>women</b> and primary education for children. To help alleviate problems, he ends with potential solutions which mainly require increased funding by G8 countries to levels beyond what they promise.|$|E
5|$|Rosemary Hennessy and Chrys Ingraham {{say that}} materialist forms of {{feminism}} {{grew out of}} Western Marxist thought and have inspired {{a number of different}} (but overlapping) movements, all of which are involved in a critique of capitalism and are focused on ideology's relationship to women. Marxist feminism argues that capitalism is the root cause of women's oppression, and that <b>discrimination</b> <b>against</b> <b>women</b> in domestic life and employment is an effect of capitalist ideologies. Socialist feminism distinguishes itself from Marxist feminism by arguing that women's liberation can only be achieved by working to end both the economic and cultural sources of women's oppression. Anarcha-feminists believe that class struggle and anarchy against the state require struggling against patriarchy, which comes from involuntary hierarchy.|$|E

40|$|Background: Freedom from {{discrimination}} {{is one of}} the key principles in a human rights-based approach to maternal and newborn health. Objective: To review the published evidence on <b>discrimination</b> <b>against</b> Romani <b>women</b> in maternity care in Europe, and on interventions to address this. Search strategy: A systematic search of eight electronic databases was undertaken in 2015 using the terms “Roma” and “maternity care”. A broad search for grey literature included the websites of relevant agencies. Data extraction and synthesis: Standardised data extraction tables were utilised, quality was formally assessed and a line of argument synthesis was developed and tested against the data from the grey literature. Results: Nine hundred papers were identified; three qualitative studies and seven sources of grey literature met the review criteria. These revealed that many Romani women encounter barriers to accessing maternity care. Even when they are able to access care, they can experience discriminatory mistreatment on the basis of their ethnicity, economic status, place of residence or language. The grey literature revealed some health professionals held underlying negative beliefs about Romani women. There were no published research studies examining the effectiveness of interventions to address <b>discrimination</b> <b>against</b> Romani <b>women</b> and their infants in Europe. The Roma Health Mediation Programme is a promising intervention identified in the grey literature. Conclusions: There is evidence of <b>discrimination</b> <b>against</b> Romani <b>women</b> in maternity care in Europe. Interventions to address <b>discrimination</b> <b>against</b> childbearing Romani <b>women</b> and underlying health provider prejudice are urgently needed, alongside analysis of factors predicting the success or failure of such initiatives...|$|R
