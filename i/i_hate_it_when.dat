500|$|Morrissey {{deliberately}} used archaic language when composing the voice-over style lyrics for [...] "This Charming Man". His use of {{phrases and}} {{words such as}} 'hillside desolate', 'stitch to wear', 'handsome' and 'charming' are used to convey a more courtly world than the mid-Eighties north of England, and evoke a style that has, {{in the words of}} the music critic Mat Snow [...] "nothing to do with fashion". Morrissey had already used the word 'handsome' in a song title—in [...] "Handsome Devil", the B-side to [...] "Hand in Glove"—and observed in a 1983 interview with Barney Hoskyns that he used the word to [...] "try and revive some involvement with language people no longer use. In the daily scheme of things, people's language is so frighteningly limited, and if you use a word with more than 10 letters it's absolute snobbery." [...] Snow puts forward the case that through the use of the dated word 'charming', Morrissey sought to rebel against the then mainstream gay culture from which he felt alienated. Morrissey told Hoskyns: [...] "I hate this 'festive faggot' thing ... People listen to [...] "This Charming Man" [...] and think no further than what anyone would presume. I hate that angle, and it's surprising that the gay press have harped on more than anyone else. <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> <b>it</b> <b>when</b> people talk to me about sex in a trivial way." ...|$|E
5000|$|On March 10, 2011, Rihanna {{ruled out}} playing the part, saying [...] "Absolutely not. <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> <b>it</b> <b>when</b> singers do singing movies all the time, {{because you can}} never look at them as anybody else. I {{want to play a}} character. My whole life is playing Rihanna; being a singer won't be a stretch for me." ...|$|E

Cox urged the legislature to overturn the 2004 constitutional amendment banning gay marriage and civil unions. Cox said his views [...] "evolved", and went on to say [...] "Usually, <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> <b>it</b> <b>when</b> politicians say their views have evolved, but I guess mine have," [...] Cox said. [...] "Part of it is I've just become more libertarian. I still think of myself as a social conservative." ...|$|E

5000|$|As {{the start}} of {{production}} neared, Ava Gardner got cold feet about co-starring with an actor she had idolized since childhood. Hornblow asked Gable to call her, and he told her: [...] "I'm supposed to talk you into doing this thing. But I'm not going to. <b>I</b> <b>hated</b> <b>it</b> <b>when</b> they did that to me. But I hope you change your mind, kid, I {{think it would be}} fun to work together." [...] The two remained friends for life.|$|R

5000|$|In {{regards to}} the 2009 Donnie Darko sequel S. Darko Kelly has said, [...] "I {{had nothing to do}} with it.

I had to relinquish them when I was 24-years old. I hate when people ask me about that because I’ve never seen it and I never will, so… don’t ask me about the sequel." ...|$|E

Aside from general users, pull-to-refresh was also well {{received by the}} overall interaction design community. Designer Tim Van Damme reportedly emailed Brichter following the release of pull-to-refresh, saying “Thanks to you, I just tried to refresh my inbox by pulling the list down and releasing it. <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> <b>it</b> <b>when</b> you do things better than Apple.” [...] Other interaction designers expressed similarly positive sentiments regarding the technique.|$|E
5000|$|... "My father {{tried to}} teach me a little piano playing when I was 8, but <b>I</b> <b>hated</b> <b>it.</b> <b>When</b> <b>I</b> was {{nine and a half}} he sent me to a piano teacher. I didn’t like {{classical}} music at all. At eleven and a half, after two years of lessons, I was supposed to play a Beethoven sonata. It was after this point that playing the piano began to really give me pleasure. Today, however, my relating to classical music is diminishing again; to be honest, it isn’t easy to run on two tracks and my heart beats much louder for the blues." ...|$|R

"I {{thought it}} would only tease him," [...] said Ethel, [...] "and that he might call it a petty female squabble; and when Margaret is well, it will come right, if Fanny Anderson has not spoiled {{the girls in the}} meantime.

5000|$|Walliams {{hinted at}} being pansexual {{in the book}} Inside Little Britain, but {{said he did not}} like to be {{labelled}} by that word. In an interview with Radio Times in 2013, he stated: [...] "I think it's all about falling in love with the person and that is overlooked, really. <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> <b>it</b> <b>when</b> people 'confess' or 'reveal' their sexuality and also things can change for people over the years. So it is about the person but I also think it goes beyond that. You don't just fall in love with someone's body, do you? You fall in love with someone's soul and heart and brain." ...|$|E
5000|$|Scott {{discussed}} {{his role in}} the recordings and how Devo came to choose him for the album: [...] "I consider my job to put the act across in the best way possible, in the way THEY wish to be perceived. <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> <b>it</b> <b>when</b> I'm part of the final equation. The act was signed for their talent not mine. I just wish the modern A&R people saw things that way. I know they chose me because of the Bowie records I did, but I don't know if it was a direct recommendation from Mr. Jones. Devo always wanted to learn. That's why they worked with each producer only once. Took what they needed and then time to move on." ...|$|E
5000|$|In June 2010 Jim Lynch {{reviewed}} Lubuntu 10.04, saying, [...] "One thing you’ll notice {{about using}} the Lubuntu desktop is that it’s fast. Very, very fast. Even on an underpowered machine, Lubuntu should perform very well. It’s {{one of the best}} things about this distro; it leaves behind the bloated eye candy that can sometimes bog down GNOME and KDE... I didn’t run into any noticeable problems with Lubuntu. It was very fast and stable, and I didn’t see noticeable bugs or problems. <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> <b>it</b> <b>when</b> this happens since it’s so much more interesting for my readers when I run into one nasty problem or another. Hopefully the next version of Lubuntu will be chock full of horrendous problems and bugs. Just kidding." ...|$|E
2500|$|While Jiang Wei was aggressively leading Shu {{forces to}} attack Wei year after year, the campaigns {{had taken a}} toll on Shu's {{resources}} but failed to yield any significant gains. In the years {{after the death of}} the Shu chancellor Dong Yun in 246, the eunuch Huang Hao came to power and indirectly controlled the Shu government. Huang Hao wanted to remove Jiang Wei from his position of power and replace him with Yan Yu (閻宇), whom he favoured. When Jiang Wei heard about it, he wrote to the Shu emperor Liu Shan to accuse Huang Hao of corruption and treachery, and urge Liu Shan to execute Huang Hao. However, Liu Shan replied, [...] "Huang Hao is merely a minor official. In the past, <b>I</b> <b>hated</b> <b>it</b> <b>when</b> he got into conflict with Dong Yun. Why should you mind him?" [...] Jiang Wei saw that Huang Hao had many supporters in the imperial court and realised that he had gotten himself into trouble when he openly denounced Huang Hao. Hence, he decided to retreat to Tazhong and garrison there instead of returning to the capital, Chengdu.|$|R

[...] Kennedy said the Bree and Orson scenes led to [...] "a tender moment", but said Susan was annoying and the Lynette plotline was somewhat insulting toward women. Isabelle Carreau of TV Squad {{said he was}} surprised Robin's back story was fleshed out so quickly, and speculated {{it could lead to}} a permanent role in the series. Carreau said the pairing of Robin and Katherine could be [...] "very interesting", and that {{the best part of the}} episode was the comical conversation between Robin and Karen McCluskey (Kathryn Joosten) at the end.|$|R

5000|$|We'll {{never use}} American accents. <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> <b>it</b> <b>when</b> singers go overthere and do that.

Following {{the success of the}} group's MOBO Award-winning single [...] "Playing with Fire", the group announced that they would be embarking on a trip to the United States in an attempt to secure a record deal for themselves there. The group, however, were banned from travelling to the country because of visa issues which were later resolved in early February. Def Jam Recordings boss L.A. Reid, a big N-Dubz fan, then arranged a meeting with the group with the intention of signing the trio to his label. In May 2010, it was announced that the group had secured a five-album recording deal with Def Jam, and that they would be flying to Los Angeles to record their third studio album with American producers Dr. Luke and Jim Jonsin. The group recorded the album with American producers Salaam Remi, Jean Baptiste Kouame and Jim Jonsin on the album who are well known for their work with the likes of Amy Winehouse, The Black Eyed Peas and Beyoncé Knowles. The producers recording with the album issues with the group's British slang on the tracks and as a result the group improved their vocabulary but put their creative foot down and in the end lost none of their roots on the album. Words like [...] "Blood" [...] and [...] "You get me?" [...] were removed from the final edit of the album, but the group's trademark phrase [...] "Na, na, niii" [...] remained as the group did not want to lose the respect they had earned from their British fans. The making of the album was released on DVD.|$|E
