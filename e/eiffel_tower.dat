5|$|Six {{visual effects}} {{companies}} worked in The Rise of Cobra, {{the most prominent}} being Digital Domain, which handled the Paris action sequences and the opening convoy sequence. For the <b>Eiffel</b> <b>Tower</b> destruction, special software was written for depicting how the crumbling metal works. To create the digital <b>Eiffel</b> <b>Tower,</b> the technicians {{had access to the}} original building plans, and built a digital model so complex that it could not fit in a single computer file. For the nanomites, designers used two proprietary software applications for their depiction—one made by Digital Domain, and another by Prime Focus VFX, which also created tools to generate 3D cloud and sky environments for the aerial scenes. Many scenarios were almost fully developed by computer-generated imagery, such as the landing platform of the Pit, the Cobra ice caverns, and the final underwater battle. As for the sound effects themselves, only one is considered popular and isn't instantly recognizable. When the pulse cannon fires upon the main submarine during the polar assault, the sound of a program de-resolution from the 1982 cult movie classic TRON can be heard.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} shot at Pinewood Studios in London, Iceland, Switzerland, France and the United States.

5|$|As a {{newspaper}} columnist, Prus {{commented on the}} achievements of scholars and scientists such as John Stuart Mill, Charles Darwin, Alexander Bain, Herbert Spencer and Henry Thomas Buckle; urged Poles to study science and technology and to develop industry and commerce; encouraged the establishment of charitable institutions to benefit the underprivileged; described the fiction and nonfiction works of fellow writers such as H.G. Wells; and extolled man-made and natural wonders such as the Wieliczka Salt Mine, an 1887 solar eclipse that he witnessed at Mława, planned building of the <b>Eiffel</b> <b>Tower</b> for the 1889 Paris Exposition, and Nałęczów, where he vacationed for 30 years.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, while {{posted in}} Paris as Peruvian air attaché, Bielovucic {{actively}} {{cooperated with the}} French Resistance. At the age of 57, he parachuted from the <b>Eiffel</b> <b>Tower.</b> Bielovucic died in Paris on 14 January 1949 and was buried at the Cimetiere nouveau de Neuilly in the Nanterre commune of Paris.

50|$|St. Stephen was {{the product}} of 19th century {{experimentation}} with prefabricated iron churches. The British, who invented corrugated iron in 1829, manufactured portable iron churches to send to far-flung colonies like Australia. The <b>Eiffel</b> <b>Tower's</b> creator, French engineer Gustave Eiffel, designed iron churches that were sent as far as the Philippines and Peru. Now St Stephen is one of the world's few surviving prefabricated cast iron churches.|$|R
25|$|On {{the evening}} of the attack, the Brandenburg Gate in Germany and Tel Aviv City Hall in Israel were {{illuminated}} with the Union Jack. At midnight that evening, the <b>Eiffel</b> <b>Tower's</b> lights were switched off to honour those killed in the London attack. On 23 March, Jean-Marc Ayrault, France's Minister of Foreign Affairs, came to London, where he first visited the hospital where three French high school students injured in the attack were being treated and later attended the morning session in the House of Commons.|$|R
5|$|In 1911, Pound {{introduced}} {{two other}} poets to the <b>Eiffel</b> <b>Tower</b> group: his former fiancée Hilda Doolittle (who had started signing her work H.D.) and {{her future husband}} Richard Aldington. These two were interested in exploring Greek poetic models, especially Sappho, an interest that Pound shared. The compression of expression that they achieved by following the Greek example complemented the proto-Imagist interest in Japanese poetry, and, in 1912, during a meeting {{with them in the}} British Museum tea room, Pound told H.D. and Aldington that they were Imagistes and even appended the signature H.D. Imagiste to some poems they were discussing.|$|E
5|$|In Paris it {{was planned}} that two stunt men, B.J. Worth and Don Caldvedt, would help film two takes of a {{parachute}} drop off a (clearly visible) platform that extended from a {{top edge of}} the <b>Eiffel</b> <b>Tower.</b> However, sufficient footage was obtained from Worth's jump, so Caldvedt was told {{he would not be}} performing his own jump. Caldvedt, unhappy at not being able to perform the jump, parachuted off the tower without authorisation from the City of Paris. He was subsequently sacked by the production team for jeopardising the continuation of filming in the city.|$|E
5|$|International Street is a themed area at Canada's Wonderland {{theme park}} in Vaughan, Ontario. Similar to the Main Street, U.S.A. {{sections}} of Walt Disney Parks and Resorts, {{it acts as}} an entrance way to the park. The street ends at Wonder Mountain, a visual landmark for navigating {{through much of the}} park. A similar format is used in Kings Island and Kings Dominion theme parks, albeit with a replica of the <b>Eiffel</b> <b>Tower</b> at the end in both parks. In each instance, the International Street section was created while the park was owned by Kings Entertainment Company, then transferred to Paramount Parks, and finally to the current owners, Cedar Fair Entertainment Company.|$|E
50|$|The Atlantic City Seagulls of the United States Basketball League drafted Langel in the 2000 USBL Draft. He {{tried out}} for the Seattle SuperSonics in 2000, but {{did not make the}} squad.

50|$|During his seven-year {{tenure at}} German Basketball Bundesliga side TVG Trier (1994-2001), Beck guided {{the team to}} two German Cup titles (1998 and 2001) {{and a trip to}} the Bundesliga semifinals in 1998. In 2001, Beck took the reins at fellow Bundesliga team EWE Baskets Oldenburg, where he worked until May 2007. He was then named head coach of Euphony Bree of Belgium until January 2009 and served as head coach of the <b>Eiffel</b> <b>Towers</b> Den Bosch, a member of the Dutch top-flight Eredivisie, from January 2009 to April 2010.|$|R
50|$|With a {{total height}} of 472 meters, Troll A was the tallest {{structure}} {{ever to be}} built and moved. Many sources erroneously state {{that it is the}} largest. The largest structure ever moved (also a Condeep) was the Gullfaks C platform in the Norwegian North Sea. The total weight of the Troll A Condeep when launching was 1.2 million tons. 245,000 m³ of concrete and 100,000 tons of steel for reinforcement were used. The amount of steel corresponds to 15 <b>Eiffel</b> <b>towers.</b> The platform is placed at a depth of 300 meters. For stability, it is dug 35 meters into the sea floor.|$|R
5|$|Just as the <b>Eiffel</b> <b>Tower</b> {{is often}} used in popular culture to {{immediately}} locate a scene in Paris, France, the Tokyo Tower {{is often used}} in the same way for Tokyo. It is used in anime and manga such as Tokyo Magnitude 8.0, Magic Knight Rayearth, Please Save My Earth, Cardcaptor Sakura, Digimon, Detective Conan, Sailor Moon, and Death Note. The tower is also frequently used in the Japanese kaiju (giant monster) film genre. It has been the location of the climactic 'battles' between Godzilla, Mothra, Gamera and King Kong (King Kong Escapes) wherein it is frequently destroyed and rebuilt. Based on the popular manga series by Ryōhei Saigan, the 2005 film Always Sanchōme no Yūhi was a nostalgic view of life in the neighbourhoods under the construction of the Tokyo Tower.|$|E
5|$|Production for {{the special}} began in Berlin on October 2, 2017, moved to Brussels on October 12, and then to Paris later within the day, where it {{remained}} up to October 24. Around midnight of October 22, production filmed a four-minute fireworks show near the <b>Eiffel</b> <b>Tower.</b> Due to insufficient notices posted by the Paris City Hall, reportedly some Parisians were taken by surprise and mistook {{the sound of the}} fireworks for a terrorist attack. On October 25 production moved to Naples where it remained up to November 4. They donated €7,000 to the local community to thank them for the hospitality, and to fund the construction of a pedestrian plaza.

5|$|The added {{height of}} the spire allowed the Chrysler Building to surpass 40 Wall Street as the tallest {{building}} {{in the world and}} the <b>Eiffel</b> <b>Tower</b> as the tallest structure. The Chrysler Building was thus the first man-made structure to be taller than , and as one newspaper noted, the tower was also taller than the highest points of five states. The new Chrysler Building, appraised at $14 million, was also exempt from city taxes as per an 1859 law that gave tax exemptions to sites owned by the Cooper Union. Although the city had attempted to repeal the tax exemption, Cooper Union opposed that measure, and because the Chrysler Building retains the tax exemption, it has paid Cooper Union for the use of their land since opening.|$|E
