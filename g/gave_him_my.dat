500|$|Murphy {{became a}} {{national}} celebrity following his World War II military service when Life magazine proclaimed him America's [...] "most decorated soldier" [...] in its 16 July 1945 issue cover story. That magazine cover {{brought him to the}} attention of veteran actor James Cagney who invited him to Hollywood. When Murphy arrived in California after his military discharge, Cagney cancelled the hotel reservations he'd made for Murphy and instead took him into his own home, [...] "I got the shock of my life. Audie was very thin. His complexion was bluish-gray." [...] Commenting years later on his first impression, Cagney said, [...] " [...] in such a nervous condition that I was afraid he might jump out of a window. I took him home and <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>my</b> bed." [...] He spent three weeks as a guest of Cagney and then returned to Texas before finally agreeing to an offer from brothers James and William Cagney of $150 a week as a contract player with their production company. The Cagneys gave Murphy personal attention on acting techniques. He also took lessons at the Actors' Lab on Sunset Boulevard. Murphy studied voice techniques, learned judo, and trained with choreographer John Boyle, Cagney's dance coach for Yankee Doodle Dandy. A 1947 disagreement with William Cagney ended his association with the brothers without having been cast in a film production.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{months after}} Truffaut's Stolen Kisses Claude Jade starred in Alfred Hitchcock's Topaz (1969), as Michèle Picard, a secret agent's anxious daughter, {{married to a}} {{reporter}} (Michel Subor). Recommended to Hitchcock by Truffaut, she was 19 years old when cast, with Dany Robin playing her mother. Hitchcock said he chose the two actresses to provide glamor, and later quipped, [...] "Claude Jade is a rather quiet young lady, but I wouldn't guarantee [...] about her behavior in a taxi". Jade recounted that they [...] "talked in a Paris hotel about cooking, and I <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>my</b> recipe for soufflé and told him I liked Strangers on a Train, and that was that." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I did. Remembering Jake's theory, I {{saw it was}} {{possible}} {{he had come to}} push me off, but I knew he hadn't. That's why I <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>my</b> hand afterwards." ...|$|E

60|$|I {{met him in}} {{the hall}} {{at the foot of}} the stairs, and put a witless cheeriness into the voice I bade him good-evening with, while I <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>my</b> hand and led the way into the parlor.|$|E
60|$|I {{composed}} {{myself as}} best I {{could in the}} face of his incredulity, swallowing with an effort the aversion I felt to <b>giving</b> <b>him</b> <b>my</b> story.|$|R

6000|$|I <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>my</b> general {{impression}} {{as to the}} future. The bare idea [...] that Parnell might find no inconsiderable following came upon him [...] {{as if it had}} been a thunder-clap. He listened, and catechised, and [...] knit his brow.|$|E
60|$|I <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>my</b> hand, of course, because I {{could not}} help it; but the sympathy I had been {{prepared}} to feel for Clara's father was immediately soured by his appearance, and the wheedling, unreal tones in which he spoke.|$|E
60|$|I <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>my</b> card. My cards, {{being part}} of my wedding outfit, {{necessarily}} had the false name printed on them--Mrs. Eustace Woodville. The servant showed me into a front room on the ground-floor, and disappeared with my card in his hand.|$|E
