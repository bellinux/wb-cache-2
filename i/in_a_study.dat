5|$|After 55 to 65 days, juveniles reach full adult {{measurements}} and battle among themselves until a dominant juvenile forces its siblings {{to leave the}} natal area. The dominant bird remains with its parents until the following season, while its siblings leave the natal territory to join an unrelated pair who failed to breed. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>study</b> by Dan Strickland, two-thirds of dominant juveniles were male.|$|E

30|$|It is {{also not}} easy to operationalize {{complexity}} of the regional economic development and wellbeing (for a discussion see e. g. Russ and Jones 2008). The previously reported studies (e. g. Audretsch and Keilbach 2004) often work with the Gros Domestic Product (GDP) only. To increase robustness of our findings, we work with the three outcome variables representing the regional economic development and country’s wealth: Gross Domestic Product per capita (GDP) that {{was used as a}} representation of economic growth for example <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>studies</b> by Dvouletý (2017 a); Armeanu et al. (2015) or Valliere and Peterson (2009), Gross National Income (GNI) that was used for example <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>studies</b> by Smith (2010) or Ahmad et al. (2011), and the Human Development Index (HDI) that was used for example <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>studies</b> by Dhahri and Omri (2018) or Gries and Naudé (2011).|$|R

5|$|Current {{preclinical}} {{tests show}} that the SEGRAMs available so far would elicit fewer side effect or at least less grave side effects than classic glucocorticoids would. For example, skin atrophy in rats was significantly less pronounced than under prednisolone <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>study</b> using the SEGRAM Mapracorat, and metabolic effects like weight gain or increase of blood glucose were practically inexistent.|$|E
5|$|Entoloma austroprunicolor is a {{commonly}} occurring mushroom of wet sclerophyll forests in Tasmania. Fruiting occurs from late spring to early winter, with most fruit bodies recorded between {{the months of}} January to March. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>study</b> {{of the distribution of}} mushroom species in this area, it was found to occur only in mature or uncut forests.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>study</b> {{carried out}} in Britain, the {{survival}} rate for juveniles {{in their first year}} is 57per cent, and the adult annual survival rate is 62per cent.

5|$|<b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>study</b> of 19th-century warfare, {{historian}} James Reid {{posits that}} Anderson suffered from delusional paranoia, which exacerbated his aggressive, sadistic personality. He sees Anderson as obsessed with, and greatly enjoying, {{the ability to}} inflict fear and suffering in his victims, and suggests he suffered from the most severe type of sadistic personality disorder. Reid draws a parallel between the bashi-bazouks and Anderson's group, arguing that they behaved similarly.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>study</b> {{of grass}} {{selectivity}} among the wildebeest, zebra, and the Coke's hartebeest, the hartebeest showed the highest selectivity.

The time spent grazing increased by about 100% during the dry season. Though the choice of diet remained the same in both the dry and the wet season, the animals were more selective during the latter.|$|E

This study recorded worms of genera such as Cooperia, Cooperoides, Fasciola, Gongylonema.

5|$|River otters are {{renowned for}} {{their sense of}} play. Otter play mostly {{consists}} of wrestling with conspecifics. Chasing is also a common game.

5|$|The American robin {{is known}} to be a rejecter of cowbird eggs, so brood {{parasitism}} by the brown-headed cowbird is rare.
