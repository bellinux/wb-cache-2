500|$|Swift solely penned [...] "Today Was a Fairytale" [...] in {{the summer}} of 2008 and stored it away for a while. After being cast as Felicia Miller on Valentine's Day, Swift offered the song to the film {{producers}} for the soundtrack as she did not believe it fit on her upcoming album. [...] "When this movie opportunity came about, I reached back <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>pocket</b> and thought, 'I think this is perfect for the soundtrack. I hope it's perfect for the soundtrack'", Swift told The Tennessean. [...] "Today Was a Fairytale" [...] was released as a single from the Valentine's Day soundtrack on January 22, 2010, exclusively through the iTunes Store. The single was re-released on February 15, 2011.|$|E
2500|$|...The Lady made a {{sign for}} me to approach; but I was seized with fear, and I did not dare, {{thinking}} that I was faced with an illusion. I rubbed my eyes, but in vain. I looked again, and I could still see the same Lady. Then I put my hand <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>pocket,</b> and took my rosary. I {{wanted to make the}} sign of the cross, but in vain; I could not raise my hand to my forehead, it kept on dropping" ... "The Lady took the rosary that she held in her hands and she made the sign of the cross".|$|E
60|$|Doubling up the newspaper, I thrust it <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>pocket,</b> {{and sped}} swiftly {{out of the}} patio.|$|E
60|$|Fail. No longer ago {{than last}} night he met me in the dark, and offered to dive <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>pockets.</b>|$|R
60|$|Among {{the many}} other things I had brought from the outer world {{were a number of}} pedometers. I slipped three of these <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>pockets</b> with the idea that I might arrive at a more or less {{accurate}} mean from the registrations of them all.|$|R
60|$|Having {{conceived}} the thought, I rose calmly, shut the book carefully, but with decision, thrust <b>my</b> hands firmly <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>pockets,</b> knitted <b>my</b> brows, {{and went out}} in search of my bosom friend John Brown--also a commonplace name, I believe--at least, so it is said.|$|R
60|$|MRS. CHEVELEY. I {{find that}} somehow Gertrude Chiltern’s dying speech and {{confession}} has strayed <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>pocket.</b>|$|E
60|$|Then I put {{the letter}} <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>pocket</b> with a clumsy {{assumption}} of carelessness, and knelt {{down to the}} fender and sausages.|$|E
60|$|Rho. By that I {{should be}} a very covetous person; for I am ever pulling out my money, and putting it <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>pocket</b> again.|$|E
60|$|I {{could not}} contain myself. I started {{up from my}} seat--looked round on the company with fiery indignation--thrust both <b>my</b> hands <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>pockets,</b> and strode {{up to one of}} the windows, as though I would have walked through it. I stopped short; looked out upon the {{landscape}} without distinguishing a feature of it; and felt my gorge rising almost to suffocation.|$|R
6000|$|And I did go on--went on {{at such a}} rate, that {{in another}} {{quarter of an hour}} the croupier called out, [...] "Gentlemen, the bank has {{discontinued}} for to-night." [...] All the notes, and all the gold in that [...] "bank," [...] now lay in a heap under my hands; the whole floating capital of the gambling-house was waiting to pour <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>pockets!</b> ...|$|R
60|$|I {{took the}} gold, slipped {{it with an}} {{indifferent}} air <b>into</b> <b>my</b> waistcoat <b>pocket,</b> and then refolded my arms across my breast.|$|R
6000|$|... "Come now!" [...] said Tur-il-i-ra, [...] "Ting-a-ling, get <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>pocket.</b> I {{must see}} into this myself, for I can't be waiting here all night, you know." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Let no man stir," [...] said Cetewayo, {{and they}} stood {{as though they}} were rooted to the ground, while I slipped my pistol back <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>pocket.</b>|$|E
60|$|These {{first three}} {{paragraphs}} I did not read to Ethelbertha. Fortunately they just filled the first sheet, which I took an opportunity of slipping <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>pocket</b> unobserved.|$|E
60|$|My hand closed {{suddenly}} upon it, {{and again}} I looked searchingly around. There {{was not a}} soul in sight. I slipped the ring <b>into</b> <b>my</b> waistcoat <b>pocket</b> and {{moved back to the}} white railings. I leaned against them, and, taking a pipe and tobacco from <b>my</b> <b>pocket,</b> began to smoke.|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear Glencora, if I am to give {{my cousin}} money I shall do so by putting <b>my</b> hand <b>into</b> <b>my</b> own <b>pocket</b> in {{preference}} to {{that of any other}} person." ...|$|R
60|$|I stored {{the boat}} with meat and drink, and took six cows and two bulls alive, with as many ewes and rams, {{intending}} to carry them <b>into</b> <b>my</b> own country; and to feed them on board, I had a good bundle of hay {{and a bag of}} corn. I would gladly have taken a dozen of the natives; but this was a thing the Emperor would by no means permit, and besides a diligent search <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>pockets,</b> his Majesty pledged my honor not to carry away any of his subjects, though with their own consent and desire.|$|R
60|$|Sadly I {{dropped them}} back <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>pocket,</b> sadly we yearned toward the blessed stove and the arm-chairs, and sadly {{we went out}} the door into the frosty night.|$|E
6000|$|... "Unfortunately I had {{forgotten}} to put my translatophone <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>pocket,</b> and it was lying in full view on the table. Mary gave a scornful glance toward the innocent tube.|$|E
60|$|Before I {{had reached}} the lodge, where I had left my bicycle, I met Brownster, and when I saw him I put my hand <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>pocket.</b> He had {{certainly}} been very attentive.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{folded up}} the paper flat, put it <b>into</b> <b>my</b> inside <b>pocket,</b> and went to Rufe's room. He was nearly dressed, and was feeding the pig {{the rest of the}} milk and some apple-peelings.|$|R
60|$|I {{thrust the}} {{telegram}} <b>into</b> <b>my</b> waistcoat <b>pocket</b> {{and finished the}} rubber. Soon afterwards I cut out and took a hansom round to Claridge's Hotel. I found my brother in and expecting to hear from me.|$|R
6000|$|... "On my honor, Louis, {{the note}} is in <b>my</b> <b>pocket,</b> already torn in four pieces when I put <b>my</b> hand <b>into</b> <b>my</b> {{waistcoat}} <b>pocket</b> to pay <b>my</b> bill. In three minutes {{it will be}} in a hundred pieces--gone! You need have no fear. The note Mr. Giatron is guarding so carefully is a very excellent ten-pound note of my own." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "See, boy, {{this is no}} jest," [...] {{said his}} uncle. [...] "You are too big {{to be told that}} 'I'll put you <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>pocket</b> and carry you off.' I am in earnest." ...|$|E
60|$|Hardly had the {{reflection}} {{crossed my mind}} when a noise outside startled me. I had just time enough to thrust the paper <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>pocket</b> when the door was swung open and the tramp appeared.|$|E
6000|$|I {{put my hand}} <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>pocket.</b> [...] "One pound seventeen," [...] I answered, {{counting}} it. [...] "It {{will pay}} my fare to London--or buy me a dinner and a second-hand revolver. I haven't quite decided yet." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Larks and {{starlings}} chiefly, {{but there}} were other kinds amongst 'em. Why, sir, they flew about my head and round the lantern like clouds of snowflakes. I was sittin' on the lantern just as Shales is sittin' now, and the birds came so thick that I had to pull my sou'-wester down over my eyes, and hold up my hands sometimes before my face to protect myself, for they hit me all over. I snapped at 'em, and caught 'em as fast as I could use my hands--gave their heads a screw, and crammed 'em <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>pockets.</b> In a short time the pockets were all as full as they could hold--coat, vest, and trousers. I had to do it so fast that many of 'em wasn't properly killed, and some came alive agin, hopped out of <b>my</b> <b>pockets,</b> and flew away." ...|$|R
6000|$|I stored {{the boat}} with the {{carcases}} of a hundred oxen, and three hundred sheep, with bread and drink proportionable, and as much meat ready dressed as four hundred cooks could provide. I took with me six cows and two bulls alive, with as many ewes and rams, intending to carry them <b>into</b> <b>my</b> own country, and propagate the breed. And to feed them on board, I had a good bundle of hay, {{and a bag of}} corn. I would gladly have taken a dozen of the natives, but this was a thing the emperor would by no means permit; and, besides a diligent search <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>pockets,</b> his majesty engaged my honour “not to carry away any of his subjects, although with their own consent and desire.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ay, I don't suppose there's much to settle. Nor many {{tears to}} shed—when a fellow spends his years an' his prime on the Lord knows who, you can't expect those that {{remember}} him young {{to feel his}} loss too keenly. He'd had his fling in his day, though, ma'am. Ay—must ha' had some rich times. No lasting satisfaction in it though—always wanting, craving. There's nothing like marrying—you've got your dish before you then, and you've got to eat it." [...] He lapsed again into reflection, from {{which he did not}} rouse till we had locked up the desk, burned the useless papers, put the others <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>pockets</b> and the black bag, and were standing ready to depart. Then the doctor looked up suddenly and said: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's no use wearing {{out your}} {{stockings}} on this snow-covered ground, my good girl," [...] said Diogenes good-humouredly. [...] "All the kneeling {{in the world}} will not put half a guilder <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>pocket</b> nor apparently into yours." ...|$|E
6000|$|I thrust it hurriedly <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>pocket,</b> and ran back. As I {{passed through}} the gateway I asked a peon to send Enriquez to me. The man stared. Did I not know that Don Enriquez had ridden away two minutes ago? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How did {{you know}} I had it? If it hadn't been for her, I shouldn't have brought any. She put it <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>pocket</b> just as I was leaving. She said you would all {{want to see what}} she looked like." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The hussar {{took the}} beef from the table, {{set it on}} the {{charcoal}} dish (to keep it hot till wanted); he did the like with the fish and roast game; and poured me out wine and beer--[was ever such a lucky Barmecide!] I ate and drank till I had abundantly enough. Dessert, confectionery, what I could,--a plateful of big black cherries, and a plateful of pears, my waiting-man wrapped in paper and stuffed them <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>pockets,</b> to be a refreshment on the way home. And so I rose from the Royal table; and thanked God and the King in my heart, that I had so gloriously dined,"--HERRLICH, [...] "gloriously" [...] at last. Poor excellent down-trodden Linsenbarth, one's heart opens to him, not one's larder only.|$|R
6000|$|On leaving I would {{formally}} {{hand him}} my half-crown, [...] "with mamma's compliments," [...] {{and he would}} formally accept it. But on putting <b>my</b> hand <b>into</b> <b>my</b> jacket <b>pocket</b> when outside the gate I would invariably find it there. The first time I took it back to him, but unblushingly he repudiated all knowledge.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now how in thunder {{did that}} get <b>into</b> <b>my</b> {{right-hand}} <b>pocket?</b> I always {{keep it in}} my vest," [...] he exclaimed; and the matter continued to disturb him after {{they were in the}} automobile. [...] "It's my lucky piece. I guess I was so excited at the prospect of seeing you when I dressed this morning I put it <b>into</b> <b>my</b> change. Just see what you do to me!" ...|$|R
