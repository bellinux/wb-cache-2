500|$|Critics who {{disliked the}} album cited what they {{viewed as a}} ridiculous concept. Salon remarked in its review that [...] "Musically [...] their 1995 album Clouds Taste Metallic offers the same {{psychotic}} results without all the technological hassle. And conceptually? The same thing, just all at once: stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid." [...] Jason Josephes from Pitchfork awarded the album a score of 0.0 out of 10; in a scathing review, Josephes criticized the album for being inaccessible, asking [...] "Do <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> three more CD players with which to enjoy Zaireeka or, say, eat?" [...] and derided the band's fans. Further, in October 2009, editor-in-chief of Pitchfork, Mark Richardson, wrote a book titled Zaireeka for the 33 1/3 book series, published by Continuum International Publishing, now owned by Bloomsbury Publishing. In it, Richardson chronicles {{the creation of the}} album, praises it from multiple angles, and discusses the impact the album has had on music since its release. The album was included in Pitchforks 2010 list of [...] "ten unusual CD-era gimmicks".|$|E
500|$|Because Witherspoon's {{father worked}} for the U.S. {{military}} in Wiesbaden, Germany, she lived there for four years as a child. After returning to the U.S., she spent her childhood in Nashville, Tennessee. Witherspoon was raised as an Episcopalian, and has said she is proud of the [...] "definitive Southern upbringing" [...] which she received. She said that it gave her [...] "a sense of family and tradition" [...] and taught her about [...] "being conscientious about people's feelings, being polite, being responsible and never taking for granted {{what you have in}} your life." [...] At the age of seven, Witherspoon was selected as a model for a florist's television advertisements, which motivated her to take acting lessons. At age eleven, she took first place in the Ten-State Talent Fair. Witherspoon received high grades in school, loved reading, and considered herself [...] "a big dork who read loads of books." [...] On mentioning her love for books, she said, [...] "I get crazy in a bookstore. It makes my heart beat hard because <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> everything." [...] She {{has been described as a}} [...] "multi-achiever" [...] and was given the nickname [...] "Little Type A" [...] by her parents. Witherspoon attended middle school at Harding Academy and graduated from the all-girls' Harpeth Hall School in Nashville, during which time she was a cheerleader. She later attended Stanford University as an English literature major, [...] but left the school prior to completing her studies to pursue an acting career.|$|E

30|$|Well, {{from the}} outside, [Wedding] is always {{presented}} as bad and terrible and dangerous. That’s {{not the case}} at all. Of course, there are dealers and there is drug trade. But it never affects the neighborhood as such. The people who do that, they do it among themselves, and the residents are aware of that, because they see that people deal, but they are never directly approached. As I said, I’ve been living here since 1985, and they never asked me whether <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> something.|$|R

6000|$|... "That last account sounds all right," [...] {{interrupted}} Mr. Atwood. [...] "Sounds as if {{it could}} be stretched. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> a new flag, a monkey, a guitar and a barrel of pineapples. Will that rubber account stretch over 'em?" ...|$|E
60|$|It was {{the most}} {{critical}} time I had yet experienced in my career as a baseball manager. And {{there was more than}} the usual reason why I must pull the team out. A chance for a business deal depended upon the good-will of the stockholders of the Worcester club.

My whole future happiness depended upon the little girl I hoped to install in that cottage.|$|R

6000|$|... "Mr. Stillwell," [...] she began, and paused, strangely {{aware of}} a hurried note, a deeper ring in her voice. [...] "Mr. Stillwell, <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> your ranch--to engage you as my superintendent. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> Don Carlos's ranch and other {{property}} to the extent, say, of fifty thousand acres.
