40|$|The {{applicability}} of residual stress analysis is expanded {{to the full}} 2 theta range, particularly to lower diffraction angles (2 θ<< 120 o), {{in order to be}} able to analyze residual stress in complex samples. For reliable results it is crucial that systematic errors are absent. The systematic errors considered in this paper are alignment errors like specimen displacement and incident beam misalignment. Verification measurements on a stress-free sample are required in combination with a suitable test criterion. A search in the standardization literature leads to three different criteria, which are compared with each other. From these three criteria only the <b>Euronorm</b> criterion appears to be generally applicable and is selected for further evaluation. Various experiments are performed to test different setups for their applicability at low diffraction angles. These experiments and the use of the <b>Euronorm</b> criterion lead to recommendations with respect to the applicable angular range. Only high diffraction angles (above 120 o) should be applied in case of the focusing optics geometry. Much lower angles (above 60 - 70 o) can be used when software corrections for alignment errors are applied in combination with the focusing optics geometry. The lowest angles (above 30 - 40 o) can be used with the parallel beam geometry...|$|E

Steel was tested in two different conditions. First of all in as-received state after rolling and secondly after annealing by regime 6750 C / 5 h / air, which caused a precipitation of the phase σ.

40|$|In {{the last}} two decades {{architectural}} glass has made an enormous leap from a secondary material to a material that combines structural and cladding roles. The structural role is a new and problematic one. In contrast to most other engineering materials the strength of glass is not a material parameter but a parameter dependent on processing quality and damage to the glass surface. There is also no real agreement on how strong glass is. There is a concept <b>Euronorm</b> for structural glass that has values for the characteristic strength for annealed, heat-strengthened, fully tempered and chemically toughened glass. There is however no real agreement on the validity of these values for design of glass beams or columns. To provide an independent set of values a statistically significant series of four-point bending tests on glass were conducted using both lying and standing positions resulting in a set of values for the characteristic strength...|$|E
40|$|A simple {{model to}} {{estimate}} the bit error probability (BEP) for a digital radio receiver, co-located with an undesired radiated interference source, is proposed. Co-location {{is defined as the}} area around the receiver (radius r), where an interferer has {{a significant impact on the}} BEP. The interference source is approximated to be of Gaussian type. A comparison of the emission limits given in <b>Euronorm</b> EN 55022, Class A and B, and RE 102 in MIL-STD- 461 D on this radius r is presented. For Differential Phase-Shift Keying systems, assuming BEP < 10 - 3, at SNR = 12 dB, the model delivers for Class A: r 70 m, for Class B: r 35 m and for RE 102 : r 10 m.

40|$|The 2. 7 {{kilometers}} {{double track}} elevated viaducts of Doha metro green line, currently under construction, consist of cast-in-situ and precast segmental simply supported spans ranging from 20 to 35 m and continuous cast-insitu {{two and three}} spans (30 - 57 m), (50 - 51 - 44 m) and (37 - 68 - 37 m) U-trough decks. The non-typical configuration of the continuous span arrangements was imposed to the designer by existing underneath utilities and infrastructures. In order to ensure the passenger comfort and traffic safety by preventing track instability during train operation for this special landmark project, performing a dynamic analysis was vital. The dynamic analysis focuses on the vertical accelerations and vertical displacements as well as lateral frequencies of vibration. All simply supported spans {{as well as the}} continuous spans of the project are considered. The real train of the project composed of 6 vehicles with a total length of 120 m and with actual axle loads (maximum axle load of 160 kN with 4 axles per vehicle) is adopted in the dynamic analysis. The analysis is carried out using both direct time integration of the equation of motion and modal time history analysis for different train speeds ranging from 60 km/hr to the maximum permissible speed along the metro line (160 km/hr) with the maximum operating speed ranging from 100 to 130 km/hr. For each train speed the maximum vertical acceleration and the maximum vertical deflection are monitored using the CSI bridge software and are compared to the allowable values given in EN 1991 - 2 and EN 1990 -Annex 2. According to relevant <b>Euronorm</b> requirements, the vertical accelerations and the vertical deflections were found acceptable for all segments of the elevated viaduct...|$|E
40|$|Within {{the last}} years modern diesel {{applications}} had to satisfy increasingly challenging European exhaust emission standards, especially the <b>Euronorm</b> 5 and 6. All the automotive firms focused her efforts to reduce soot emissions by developing new after treatment systems. Common concepts for diesel exhaust after treatment systems rely on Diesel Oxidation Catalysts (DOC), Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) and NOx absorbers. The most effective of these systems is the DPF, actually providing filtration rates better than 90 %. The geometry of the DPF structure has an important influence on its performance. Simulation offers a valuable tool for the evaluation and optimisation of various DPF designs. The present paper demonstrates the usage of the COMSOL multi physics code for modelling DPF systems. The complete model {{is based on a}} single pair of DPF channels composed of inlet / outlet channel, porous wall and the ash layer. Alternating plugs sealing the inlet- and outlet channels force the soot loaded exhaust gas to flow through the porous walls, where the soot is deposited into porous structure and at a growing soot cake layer. It is advantageous to separate the modelling of a DPF into several stages. In a first stage the pressure drop over the complete DPF channel structure unit cell is analysed in a CFD-analysis, also incorporating nonlinear pressure loss contributions due to flow contraction and expansion at the channel in and outlets. The pressure difference across the porous walls and the soot cake follows from Darcy's Law. In a next stage the soot deposition with its effect on the permeability of the porous walls and initiation of soot cake growth is included into the analysis. Phenomenological approximations on a continuum level are applied to account for the different microscopic and molecular processes of soot deposition within and at the surface of the porous wall structures. There is a strong both way interaction between gas flow field and soot deposition. The model results are compared to experimental measures of the DPF filter segments. A further level of model analysis is necessary to account for non-ideal effects of the measuring system...|$|E
