40|$|This paper proposes an {{acoustic}} <b>echo</b> <b>control</b> solution for voice <b>control</b> <b>devices.</b> An important property of {{an acoustic}} echo canceller is its capability to handle double-talk {{and be able}} to operate in real time. When it is applied to intelligent voice <b>control</b> <b>device</b> with interactive conversations, it is important to suppress the speech from the device and enhance the speech of the user for speech recognition, where doubletalk situation is frequently occurred. The main idea is to use a robust adaptive algorithm to handle the double-talk. In order to achieve real-time adaptation, subband processing together with a hardware accelerator implemented in an FPGA fabric surrounding a PowerPC on a Xilinx XUP V 2 P platform.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{influence}} of the mouth-to-ear delay and distortion (due to voice compression and packet loss) on the quality of a phone call, since these parameters are likely to be larger when the call is transported over a packet-based network instead of over a circuit-switched network. First, the need for <b>echo</b> <b>controlling</b> packetized phone calls is discussed. Second, it is shown that some codecs, in particular predictive codecs, do not attain high enough quality at low bit rates. In the same context also the potential danger of transcoding is recognized. Third, the merit of a packet loss concealment technique to considerably increase the robustness against packet loss is demonstrated. Next, the bounds on the mean one-way mouth-to-ear delay and packet loss that need to be respected in order to attain traditional PSTN quality, are derived for standard codecs (even the recently developed Adaptive MultiRate (AMR) codec) and various levels of <b>echo</b> <b>control</b> (i. e. perfect <b>echo</b> <b>control</b> and standard-compliant <b>echo</b> <b>control).</b> Finally, a gateway-to-gateway scenario in which the transport between the gateways is governed by a Service Level Specification (SLS), is discussed and a numerical example is given to show how the quality bounds can be met in this scenario by tuning the gateway parameters correctly. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{contribution}} {{of this paper}} is two-fold. At first, we introduce a modification of the linear statistical signal model in acoustic <b>echo</b> <b>control.</b> In contrast to the traditional approach, the acoustic echo path is characterized as a random process with statistical mean and covariance, while the echo path input is modeled as a deterministic signal. Based on the modified signal model, we then derive the linear MMSE estimator for the near-end speech components in the microphone signal. The result {{can be seen as a}} generalized Wiener filter that consists of an acoustic echo canceler and a postfilter for residual echo suppression. The presented theory entails several fundamental advantages: a) the new signal model better matches the practical applications of acoustic <b>echo</b> <b>control,</b> b) it proves the principal coexistence of echo canceler and postfilter in hands-free communication systems, c) the generalized Wiener solution simplifies the realization of acoustic echo controllers, and d) we obtain a better insight into the performance bounds of acoustic <b>echo</b> <b>control.</b> 1...|$|R

40|$|A Cabin Car Communication System (CCCS) has {{the goal}} of {{improving}} the communication among passengers inside the car. Wind, road and engine noise, the distance between passengers and other factors make difficult the communication inside vehicles. The driver must often look away from the road and passengers move out of normal seating positions. The CCCS makes use {{of a set of}} microphones to pick up the speech and the car-audio loudspeakers to reinforce the sound level. This scenario presents a great challenger for acoustic <b>echo</b> <b>control</b> and noise reduction. Acoustic <b>echo</b> <b>control</b> must prevent the overall system from howling and becoming unstable with the additional problem that the system must always work with double talk. The noise reduction must clean the microphone signal to avoid the reinforce of the noise inside the car.

40|$|To {{economically}} {{enhance the}} performance of active/passive <b>control</b> <b>devices</b> for seismic response reduction of tall buildings, this paper investigates the optimal placement and optimal parameter of <b>control</b> <b>devices</b> using the linear quadratic performance index as an objective function. The linear relation between the increment of performance index and the change of the position matrix of <b>control</b> <b>devices</b> is first established {{based on the assumption}} that the control gain remains unchanged. The optimal placement of <b>control</b> <b>devices</b> is then determined in terms of the sequence of the calculated performance index increments and the number of <b>control</b> <b>devices</b> to be used. With the <b>control</b> <b>devices</b> at their optimal places, the seismic response of the building is finally computed using the suboptimal control gain derived using the minimum error principle, from which the equivalent optimal parameters of passive devices can be also determined. The applicability of the proposed approach and its limitation are carefully examined through numerical examples. The results from the numerical examples show that the suggested approach is quite accurate and effective in determining the optimal placement and optimal parameter of <b>control</b> <b>devices</b> if the number of removed <b>control</b> <b>devices</b> is limited to a certain range.

40|$|Voltage {{regulation}} {{by means}} of coordinated voltage control {{is one of the}} challenging aspects of distribution system operation. Integration of distributed generation (DG), which can also be operated in voltage control mode, in distribution systems may introduce adverse effects including control interactions, operational conflicts and long term oscillations. The seamless operation of distribution systems embedded with DG for effective voltage control is one of the challenging tasks, mainly because (a) DG may interact with the conventional voltage <b>control</b> <b>devices</b> and (b) prioritised operation of different voltage <b>control</b> <b>devices</b> depends on the network topology and real-time characteristics of the system. Coordinated operation involving multiple voltage <b>control</b> <b>devices</b> (i. e., on-load tap changers and voltage regulators in addition to local capacitor banks) and DG units is one of the feasible technical solutions at medium voltage distribution system level. In most of the methods proposed in the literature, the voltage <b>control</b> <b>devices</b> and DG units are tuned and coordinated online using Volt/VAR optimization strategies in accordance with the time-graded operation.
