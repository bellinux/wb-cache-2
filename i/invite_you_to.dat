25|$|Sir, I {{have the}} honor of informing you that I have arrived in this port with a {{commission}} from the Supreme Government of the United Provinces of the Rio de la Plata to take possession of these islands {{on behalf of the}} country to which they belong by Natural Law. While carrying out this mission I want to do so with all the courtesy and respect all friendly nations; one of the objectives of my mission is to prevent the destruction of resources necessary for all ships passing by and forced to cast anchor here, as well as to help them to obtain the necessary supplies, with minimum expenses and inconvenience. Since your presence here is not in competition with these purposes and in the belief that a personal meeting will be fruitful for both of us, I <b>invite</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> come aboard, where you'll be welcomed to stay as long as you wish; I would also greatly appreciate your extending this invitation to any other British subject found in the vicinity; I am, respectfully yours. Signed, Jewett, Colonel of the Navy of the United Provinces of South America and commander of the frigate Heroína.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{features}} a guest appearance by actor William Daniels as KITT, a character from the Knight Rider television series of which Homer is a fan. KITT is an artificially intelligent electronic computer module installed in an automobile. In the episode, {{after failing to}} cheer Homer up with a film reel of his life, the family shows him a video featuring KITT. The automobile, seen driving in the desert, tells Homer the following: [...] "Hello Homer. It's me, KITT, from TV's Knight Rider. Your family has asked me to <b>invite</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> a very special ..."; the film reel breaks just before KITT finishes his sentence. This of course leads to Homer becoming even more depressed. [...] Daniels' appearance in [...] "The Wizard of Evergreen Terrace" [...] {{was the first and}} only time that he voiced KITT outside of Knight Rider and the film Knight Rider 2000. He recalls that [...] "when I told my son in New York that I {{was going to be on}} The Simpsons, I think that was the first time that he was really impressed with what I was doing! The Simpsons is a great show and I'm glad they thought of KITT in one of their jokes." ...|$|E

[...] The second stated [...] "'Jeremy Deller presents '1997 What The Fuck's Going On'", a reference to The JAMs' debut album 1987 (What the Fuck Is Going On?). [...] It continued, [...] "Jimmy Cauty and Bill Drummond <b>invite</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> a 23 minute performance during which the next 840 days of our lives will be discussed".

2500|$|The {{writer and}} {{television}} personality Alexander King said I think the outstanding characteristics of my friend's personality are affirmation, emphasis, and overemphasis. He chooses to express himself predominantly in superlatives and the gestures which accompany his utterances are sometimes dangerous {{to life and}} limb. Of the bystanders, I mean. King also spoke with affectionate amusement about Margules' pride in his cooking, speaking of how [...] "if he should ever <b>invite</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> dinner, he may serve you a hamburger with onions, in his kitchen-living room, with such an air of gastronomic protocol, such mysterious hints and ogliing innuendoes, as if César Ritz and Brillat-Savarin had sneaked out, only a moment before, with his secret recipe in their pockets." ...|$|E

2500|$|Lucius sent Fronto few {{messages}} at {{the beginning}} of the war. He sent Fronto a letter apologizing for his silence. He would not detail plans that could change within a day, he wrote. Moreover, there was little thus far to show for his work: [...] "not even yet has anything been accomplished such as to make me wish to <b>invite</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> share in the joy". Lucius did not want Fronto to suffer the anxieties that had kept him up day and night. One reason for Lucius' reticence may have been the collapse of Parthian negotiations after the Roman conquest of Armenia. Lucius' presentation of terms was seen as cowardice. The Parthians were not in the mood for peace.|$|E
2500|$|Further YPA troop {{movements}} {{took place in}} the early hours of 27 June. A unit of the YPA's 306th Anti-Aircraft Regiment, based in Karlovac, Croatia, crossed the Slovenian border at Metlika. A few hours later, a column of tanks and armoured personnel carriers of the YPA 1st Armoured Brigade left their barracks at Vrhnika near the Slovenian capital Ljubljana, heading for the airport at Brnik. They arrived a few hours later and took control of the facilities. As the YPA was the federal army, its forces were customarily deployed in various places within the federal republics including Slovenia. To the east, YPA units left Maribor heading for the nearby border crossing at Šentilj and the border town of Dravograd further west. The Yugoslav Air Force aircraft dropped leaflets over various parts of Slovenia bearing the messages [...] "We <b>invite</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> peace and cooperation!" [...] and [...] "All resistance will be crushed." ...|$|E
2500|$|Berlusconi owns via Mediaset 3 of 7 {{national}} TV channels: (Canale 5, Italia 1, and Rete 4). [...] In 2002, Luciano Violante, {{a prominent}} {{member of the}} Left, {{said in a speech}} in Parliament: [...] "Honourable Anedda, I <b>invite</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> ask the honourable Berlusconi, because he certainly knows that he received a full guarantee in 1994, when the government changed— that TV stations would not be touched. He knows it and the Honourable Letta knows it." [...] The authors of the book Inciucio cite this sentence as evidence for the idea that the Left made a deal with Berlusconi in 1994, in which a promise was made not to honour a law in the Constitutional Court of Italy that would have required Berlusconi to give up one of his three TV channels in order to uphold pluralism and competition. According to the authors, this would be an explanation of why the Left, despite having won the 1996 elections, did not pass a law to solve the conflicts of interest between media ownership and politics.|$|E

2500|$|In 2005, The Colbert Report premiered on Comedy Central.

2500|$|The Islamic prophet, Muhammad's first {{interaction}} {{with the people of}} Egypt occurred in 628, during the Expedition of Zaid ibn Haritha (Hisma). He sent Hatib bin Abi Baltaeh with a letter to the king of Egypt (in reality Emperor Heraclius) and Alexandria called Muqawqis In the letter Muhammad said: [...] "I <b>invite</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> accept Islam, Allah the sublime, shall reward you doubly. But if you refuse to do so, you will bear the burden of the transgression of all the Copts". During this expedition one of Muhammad's envoys Dihyah bin Khalifa Kalbi was attacked, Muhammad sent Zayd ibn Haritha to help him. Dihya approached the Banu Dubayb (a tribe which converted to Islam and had good relations with Muslims) for help. When the news reached Muhammad, he immediately dispatched Zayd ibn Haritha with 500 men to battle. The Muslim army fought with Banu Judham, killed several of them (inflicting heavy casualties), including their chief, Al-Hunayd ibn Arid and his son, and captured 1000 camels, 5000 of their cattle and 100 women and boys. The new chief of the Banu Judham who had embraced Islam appealed to Muhammad to release his fellow tribesmen, and Muhammad released them.|$|E
2500|$|The showpiece {{aesthetic}} {{stretch of}} the Reichsautobahn was the Irschenberg on the autobahn from Munich to the Austrian border, where instead of passing through the valley, the highway was routed in a curving path {{up the hill to}} the summit, from which there was a full view of the Alps to the south. A rest stop was located there. (The Irschenberg autobahn segment was one of those that limited the usefulness of the highways for freight transport, and with the increase in traffic after the war it became a notorious bottleneck and accident site. Many such segments have been straightened and in some cases the highway has been relocated.) In 1936 Otto Illauer's view of this stretch of highway won first prize in the photography contest Die schöne Straße in Bau und unter Verkehr (the beautiful road under construction and in use); the only criticism of the picture was that the contrast between the light-colored road and the landscape was too harsh, illustrating the strong desire for harmony between the highway and its surroundings. In fact this entire [...] segment epitomizes planning to maximize aesthetic appreciation of the landscape. Todt, who was credited with choosing the route, described it as an orchestrated experience culminating in the surprise view of the Chiemsee, where [...] "nyone who has a proper feel for this landscape... turns off the motor and silently glides down the three-kilometer-long slope to the southern shore of the lake, where a bathing beach, parking places, or the [...] <b>invite</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> stay and rest"; and according to Seifert, of the 13 possibilities for the continuation from the Chiemsee down to the Salzburg plain, the engineers had selected the only one that [...] " [...] the impossible possible" [...] by [...] "continu... on another level".|$|E

Ray Charles <b>Invites</b> <b>You</b> <b>to</b> Listen consists mostly of standards. Sid Feller chose ten songs for the album, and wrote their arrangements. A big band provided instrumentation for two of the songs, while the others were backed with fourteen string instruments, eight brass instruments, guitar, bass and drums; Feller conducted the strings, and Adams engineered the record. Ray Charles <b>Invites</b> <b>You</b> <b>to</b> Listen contains a cover version of The Beatles' [...] "Yesterday"; Charles purposely recorded the song with a hoarse voice so that the title lyric sounded as [...] "yeshh-terday".
