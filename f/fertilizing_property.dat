The pyrolysis of SS increases its stability in a degree which depends on the thermal treatment used. Thus, chars produced by using hydrothermal carbonization are typically more stable than normal soil organic matter (SOM), but less stable than chars from dry pyrolysis (Libra et al., 2011).

40|$|The present review {{provides}} {{an understanding of}} principles of struvite crystallization and examines the techniques and processes experimented to date by researchers at laboratory, pilot, and fullscale to maximize phosphorus removal and reuse as struvite from wastewater effluents. Struvite is mainly known as a scale deposit causing concerns to wastewater companies. Indeed, struvite naturally occurs under the specific condition of pH and mixing energy in specific areas of wastewater treatment plants (e. g., pipes, heat exchangers) when concentrations of magnesium, phosphate, and ammonium approach an equimolar ratio 1 : 1 : 1. However, thanks to struvite composition and its <b>fertilizing</b> <b>properties,</b> the control of its precipitation could contribute to the reduction of phosphorus levels in effluents while simultaneously generate a valuable byproduct. A number of processes such as stirred tank reactors and air-agitated and -fluidized bed reactors have been investigated as possible configurations for struvite recovery.

Therefore, identification of alternative eco-friendly disposal routes with potential financial benefits has become necessary, and the energetic valorization of these biomasses is particularly promising. Poultry litter represents one of the more challenging bio-fuel feedstocks for energy generation, being easy to handle and showing a composition that potentially assures a high energy content and the production of a byproduct (ash) with good <b>fertilizing</b> <b>properties.</b> In this paper an evaluation of the technical and economic feasibility of the energy conversion technologies usable to recover both the potential energy and fertilizer properties of poultry litter was provided.

40|$|There is {{interest}} in recovering phosphate (P(V)) from secondary sources, such as waste water streams for potential use as fertilizers reducing {{the environmental impacts}} of P(V) discharges and providing alternative phosphorus sources. The goal of this work was to provide an understanding of P(V) removal by fly ash (FA) from coal power plants. Phosphate removal using Ca(II) rich FA was evaluated in terms of i) sorption equilibrium, ii) sorption kinetics under the expected pH values and P(V) concentrations in wastewaters effluents, and iii) P(V) availability of the FAs in agricultural applications. At the pH values (6 – 9) expected for wastewater effluents, P(V) removal proceeds as a combination of CaO(s) dissolution and brushite (CaHPO 4 (s)) formation on the FA particles. This process avoids the formation of relatively insoluble Ca–phosphates, such as, hydroxyapatite (Hap) with limited <b>fertilizing</b> <b>properties.</b> High P-loadings were achieved (up to 50 mgP-PO 4 /g FA (5 % P(V) by weight)) at a pH of 8. The removal kinetics data were well described as a diffusion-based process of phosphate ions (H 2 PO 4 - and HPO 42 -) on FA particles, and the CaO(s) dissolution process was discarded as the rate controlling step. The P(V) availability from loaded samples was determined via an agronomical assay with NaHCO 3 solutions with P(V) release ratios of 10 – 30 mgP-PO 4 /g in FA, confirming the appropriateness of this material as a potential fertilizer, even in calcareous soils.

At that time, massive deposits of guano existed on some islands, in some cases more than 50 m deep. In this context the United States passed the Guano Islands Act in 1856, which gave U.S. citizens discovering a source of guano on an unclaimed island exclusive rights to the deposits. Nine of these islands are still officially U.S. territories. Control over guano {{played a central role in}} the Chincha Islands War (1864-1866) between Spain and a Peruvian-Chilean alliance. Indentured workers from China played an important role in guano harvest. The first group of 79 Chinese workers arrived in Peru in 1849; by the time that trade ended a quarter of a century later, over 100,000 of their fellow countrymen had been imported.

Among different Brassica DSMs, the best results in the reduction of M. incognita infestation were achieved by Eruca sativa, Barbarea verna and Brassica nigra DSMs. These first results open new perspectives for innovative bioactive molecules for biofumigation applied in cropping systems where nematode suppression is critical. Finally, the effect of Brassica DSMs, applied in formulations with and without crude glycerin, on seed germination inhibition was evaluated. The most effective formulations were applied in in vitro and glasshouse trials to evaluate the germination inhibition of black-grass (Alopecurus myosuriodes Huds.).

After its incorporation into the soil this pyrogenic organic matter (PyOM) or as it is also called “Black Carbon” may have considerable contribution to its organic matter (OM) pool. In addition, during the last years, the <b>fertilizing</b> <b>properties</b> of charred plant residues were re‐discovered and are nowadays divulged and encouraged within the concept of using biochars produced in a low/no oxygen environment (pyrolysis conditions) as soil amendment. The long‐term impact of this practice as well as that of burning harvest residues on soil properties and on soil OM quality has not been well studied and therefore doubts persist. Thus, the present exploratory workshop entitled “Impact of natural and anthropogenic pyrogenic Carbon in Mediterranean ecosystems” is a clear consequence of the international growing interest in solving these key questions. Which are strongly demanded to be answered by the scientific community, Mediterranean farmers as well as public agents and stakeholders. This Exploratory Workshop funded by the European Science Foundation and organised by the “Geoecología, Biogeoquímica y Microbiología Ambiental” Department of the “Instituto de Recursos Naturales y Agrobiología de Sevilla” (IRNAS‐CSIC) is intended to permit the initiation of close collaborations between leading researchers from different european institutions and also with the network eBRN (European Biochar Research Network) of the COST Action to form a multidisciplinary team.

Indeed, studies dealing with waste management aim {{to assess the}} environmental impacts of different organic waste treatments that enhance the organic waste <b>fertilizing</b> and amending <b>properties.</b> This is expressed in LCA studies by a primary function (to treat the waste) and secondary functions (to fertilize or provide an organic amendment to agricultural soils). The induced multifunctionality is often treated by system expansion by subtracting the secondary functions, leading to potentially avoided impacts. When dealing with residual organic fertilizing materials, scientific papers are used to substitute the function &# 8220;fertilizing with organic wastes&# 8221; by an alternative function &# 8220;fertilizing with mineral fertilizers&# 8221;. Occasionally, the function &# 8220;amending with organic wastes&# 8221; can be substituted by an alternative function &# 8220;amending with peat&# 8221;. This paper aims to present the results of a literature review dealing with methodological choices and quantitative rates to substitute residual organic fertilizing materials (digestates, composts issued from various substrate origins: Sludge, crop residues, manure [...] .) with mineral fertilizers. Based on a corpus of 132 peer-reviewed papers dealing with LCA case studies of residual organic fertilizing materials including land spreading, a set of 41 papers detailing system expansion by subtraction (substitution) was selected among this corpus. Those selected papers were used to state how the authors solve the above-mentioned multifunctionality problem and to highlight the quantitative rates to substitute residual organic fertilizing materials with mineral fertilizers. The literature review highlights nine different forms to consider substitution. In most of these papers, substitution is based on the fertilizing potential 1 of the residual organic fertilizing material and/or on its utilization rate based on the nutrient availability 2 (referred later on as substitution coefficient). Regarding P and K, the substitution coefficients are often close and most of the papers consider a 100 % substitution coefficient whatever the organic waste. The substitution coefficient for N ranges 20 to 30 % for compost and 40 to 90 % for digestate. These range differences depend on the substrate origin, the type of treatment and its performances. When considering the alternative function (i. e. to fertilize with mineral fertilizers), most of reviewed papers only take into account the mineral fertilizer production but do not consider their transport, spreading operation and spreading emissions. The main mineral fertilizers substituted are ammonium nitrate for N, superphosphate or triple superphosphate for P and potassium chloride for K. Whereas the 41 case studies of the review have different system boundaries, functional units and hypothesis, the impact on the results of the substituted mineral fertilizers can be barely compared between the studies. The impact of substitution is not significant in most of the case studies; however some authors highlight a significant contribution of the substituted mineral fertilizers. This is pointed out regarding mainly climate change, acidification and eutrophication, and generally these impacts are respectively caused by the N 2 O, NH 3, nitrate and phosphate emissions of the potentially avoided spread mineral fertilizers. Therefore, the way system expansion is led has a decisive influence on results. Impacts on smog, particulate matter formation, toxicity, ecotoxicity, resources, ozone layer depletion and primary energy barely emerged. The review led to an overview of the LCA habits when considering substitution of residual organic fertilizing materials used as agricultural fertilizers. It pointed out the need to superimpose the boundaries of the substituted activities. The way authors deal with the N, P and K content of digestates has been examined, leading to an overview of substitution practices. It has also been demonstrated that the most often substituted mineral fertilizers reflect the most often sold mineral fertilizers.

About 200 t of the total produced wastes are composted using an open windrows system at the Sanandaj MSW Composting Plant, which is located in 10 km of Sanadaj-Kamiaran road and the rest are disposed at the landfill site. The compost manufactured by the composting plant has been collected around it in two different locations. The first belonges to the product of 2004 - 2008 (type A) and the second belonges to the product of 2009 - 2013 (type B). Till now, due to lack of quality information associated with these products, they have remained unused. Therefore, in this study, we sampled 3 samples composed of six subsamples (each containing 2 kg) from the products in March 2013. The samples were analyzed to determine the physical properties (including undesirable impurities, initial moisture content, particle size distribution, particle density, bulk density (ρb), porosity, and maximum water holding capacity), and the chemical properties (including organic carbon, ash content, pH and salinity) and total amounts of N, P, Ca, Mg, K, Na, Mn, Fe, Cr, Zn, Pb, Ni and Cd using standard methods. Results and Discussion: The results showed that bulk density, ash content, and the amounts of elements based on the dry weight of compost increased with composting time, however particle size decreased. It is well known that dry bulk density increased with composting time as ash content increased and particle size decreased by decomposition, turning and screening. The decreases of particle size with composting time cause an enrichment of metals based on the dry weight of compost. It is likely due to solubilization of metals in waste by organic acid produced during the microbial decomposition of organic matter and their subsequent adsorption on finer particles due to the higher surface area and the higher ion exchangeable capacity. The evaluation of the fertilizing potential of the surveyed composts by comparing their properties with different standard sets showed that the both composts under test in this study were failed to meet the standard permissible limits with regard to glass content (on average, 21. 7 times over the permissible limit), gravel content (on average, 1. 4 times over the permissible limit), lead content (on average, 1. 6 times over the permissible limit), and salinity content (on average, 1. 4 times over the permissible limit). Furthermore, compost type B also failed to meet the standard permissible limits with regard to initial moisture content (on average, 1. 4 times over the permissible limit) and ρb (0. 2 gcm- 3, less than permissible limit) for agricultural purposes. The results showed that excessive amount of glass impurity bigger than 2 mm, salinity and lead contents are the major problems {{in the use of the}} composts for agricultural purposes. It should be noted that according to the maximum permissible limit of lead (150 - 300 mg kg- 1) for compost C 1 quality class described by Australian standard; both the composts can be used as fertilizers or soil amendments. In order to eliminate glass impurity, remediation approaches such as fine milling and pelleting is needed to disguise the residual glasses and render it as relatively harmless. A feasible approach to eliminate these problems is probably physical fractionation of the studied composts. It allows us to assess the distribution of nutrients and contaminants values in the different physical fractions of the composts, which is useful to detect and to eliminate of the particle sizes which are the responsible for these impurities. Conclusion: The assessment of MSW-based compost for use in agricultural soil as fertilizer or conditioner is a sustainable recycling practice owing to its nutrient content and its positive effects on soil physico-chemical properties. Thus, we evaluated the fertilizing potential of two MSW composts produced in Sanandaj city for agricultural purposes. Altogether, the results of the study showed that excessive amount of glass impurity bigger than 2 mm and salinity were the major problems in the use of the composts for agricultural purpose. As a result, the quality of the surveyed composts was not suitable for agricultural purposes without appropriate remediation of these restrictions...|$|R
