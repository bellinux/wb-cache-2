25|$|Satirical {{pamphlets}} {{directed against}} royalty were a {{common form of}} literature and the chronicles left by courtiers were influenced by rivalries or prejudice, so {{he may not have}} looked so bad. Based on collaborating evidence from other sources, however, it is probably safe to assume that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>tall,</b> <b>and</b> not plump.|$|E
25|$|Above medium {{pace and}} right-handed, Geary {{was able to}} swing the new ball very {{effectively}} but relied {{for most of his}} success on his amazing persistence and ability to bowl with slight yet well-disguised variations of pace and cut. He was able to bowl quite incredible numbers of overs on unresponsive pitches, as shown in the last Test of the 1928/1929 Ashes tour, when he bowled an amazing 81 overs on a typical billiard-table Australian wicket in very hot weather. Because <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>tall</b> <b>and</b> very solidly built, he was able both to get bounce and to bowl the long spells required for success in Australian conditions which destroyed the reputations of all English bowlers of slighter build.|$|E

25|$|He is {{described}} as having a dark complexion, large eyes and a long beard. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>tall</b> <b>and</b> slender and his hair and beard remained black until he was very old. He was attentive to his health, avoiding red meat, fats and other foods he deemed unhealthy. He was seldom sick before his last decade when he suffered from bouts of pleurisy. When he was ill, he treated himself (to the approval of physicians). He {{had a sense of}} humour, though serious subjects he treated seriously. He had studied poetry when young and enjoyed writing, reciting and participating in poetic exchanges. It is said that he was asked in Egypt about al-Tirimmah and was able to recite this 7th century poet's work for Egyptians who had merely heard al-Tirimmah's name.|$|E
25|$|Turgenev never married, but he {{had some}} affairs with his family's serfs, one of which {{resulted}} in the birth of his illegitimate daughter, Paulinette. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>tall</b> <b>and</b> broad-shouldered, but was timid, restrained, and soft-spoken. When Turgenev was 19, while traveling on a steamboat in Germany, the boat caught fire and Turgenev reacted in a cowardly manner. Rumors circulated in Russia and followed him for his entire career, providing the basis for his story A Fire at Sea. His closest literary friend was Gustave Flaubert, with whom he shared similar social and aesthetic ideas. Both rejected extremist right and left political views, and carried a nonjudgmental, although rather pessimistic, view of the world. His relations with Leo Tolstoy and Fyodor Dostoyevsky were often strained, as the two were, for various reasons, dismayed by Turgenev's seeming preference for Western Europe.|$|E
25|$|Benaud {{was not a}} large spinner of the ball, but he {{was known}} for his ability to extract {{substantial}} bounce from the surface. In addition to his accurate probing consistency, he possessed a well-disguised googly and topspinner which tricked many batsmen and yielded him many wickets. In his later career, he added the flipper, a combination of the googly and top spinner which was passed to him by Bruce Dooland. Coupled with his subtle variations in flight and angle of the delivery, he kept the batsman under constant pressure. Benaud had the tendency to bowl around the wicket {{at a time when he}} was one of the first players to do so; it had an influence on spin bowlers like Shane Warne and Ashley Giles. Benaud was regarded as one of the finest close-fielders of his era, either at gully or in a silly position. As a batsman, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>tall</b> <b>and</b> lithe, known for his hitting power, in particular his lofted driving ability from the front foot.|$|E

25|$|Roope {{was born}} in Fareham, Hampshire. After {{spending}} five years developing his cricketing talent at St John's School in Porthcawl, he was educated at Bradfield College in Berkshire, and played for Public Schools against Combined Services at Lord's in 1963 and 1964. He played Minor Counties cricket for Berkshire in 1963, before making his county cricket debut for Surrey in 1964. He received his Surrey cap in 1969. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>tall</b> <b>and</b> wiry, with distinctive curly hair. He was an all-rounder: an outstanding slip fielder, often said {{to be one of}} the best of his generation, he was also an attacking middle-order batsman and a medium-pace bowler. He took fifty first-class wickets in 1968, and 5–14 against the touring West Indians in 1969, but bowled less later in his career. He was a member of the Surrey sides that won the County Championship in 1971; making a major contribution with 1,641 runs and an exceptional 59 catches in all first-class matches; and the Benson & Hedges Cup in 1974. He retired from full-time first-class cricket after the 1982 season, and played his last first-class match in 1986. In a career of 403 first-class matches, he scored 19,116 runs at 36.90, and took 225 wickets at 37.35, as well as holding 599 catches and making two stumpings as a substitute wicket-keeper. He scored over 1,000 runs in a season on eight occasions.|$|E
