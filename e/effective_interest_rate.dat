It {{was the first}} publicly marketed, asset-backed bond issue by a European football club. The <b>effective</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> on these bonds is 5.14% and 5.97%, respectively, and are due to be paid back over a 25-year period; the move to bonds has reduced the club's annual debt service cost to approximately £20million a year.

This article explores the conceptions that student teachers have about nominal and <b>effective</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates.</b> The APOS theory illuminates analysis of students’ levels of conception. Seventy second-year mathematics students’ responses to Grade 12 tasks on <b>effective</b> and nominal <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> were analysed, after which 12 students were interviewed about their mathematical thinking in solving the tasks. The findings varied. While some students could not do the tasks due to erratic use of formulae (algebra), I ascertained that some students obtained correct answers through scrupulous adherence to the external prompt of formulae. Most of those students remained stuck at the action and process stages and could not view their processes as mathematical objects. A few students had reached the object and schema stages, showing mature understanding of the relationship between nominal and <b>effective</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates.</b> As most students remained at the operational stages rather than the structural, the findings accentuate that when teaching this topic, teachers ought to take their time to build learners’ schema for these notions. They need to guide their learners through the necessary action-process-object loop and refrain from introducing students to formulae too soon as this stalls their advancement to the object and schema stages which are useful in making them smart consumers of financial products...|$|R

Many non-government organizations around the world have built major non-governmental economic platforms with the capital accumulated from Grameen-stylemicrolending activities. Investigated in this paper is whether Grameen is the extraordinary success that it is widely reported to be. Data for this study was gathered by following the entire universe of borrowers at a single Grameen banking center in the rural Rajberry District of Bangladesh over a period of eight years. Developed is a calculation methodology for determining post hoc rates of return on Grameen-style lending contracts. Concluded is that lower than expected loan default rates are not the explanation for the accumulation of capital by Grameen and Grameen clones. Instead, it is the charging of <b>effective</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> that are very high relative to those of traditional lending institutions that produces rates of return sufficient to pay for their substantial loan administrative costs and make possible the accumulation of capital over time.

The paper considers seven variables explaining <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> spread such as general prices, Gross Domestic Product (GDP), exchange rate, credibility index, level of international reserves, foreign trade deficit, and budget deficit. Four distinct periods were selected to explore the influences of the above mentioned variables on on <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> spreads in these different time periods. The period covering 1994. 1 - 2006 : 12 was splitted into three sub-periods: the sub-period covering 1994 : 1 - 1998 : 12, crisis period covering 1999 : 1 - 2001 :. 12, and post-crisis period covering 2002 : 1 - 2006. 12.
