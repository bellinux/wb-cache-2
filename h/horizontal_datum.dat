50|$|A {{vertical}} datum {{is used as}} a reference point for elevations of surfaces and features on the Earth including terrain, bathymetry, water levels, and man-made structures. Vertical datums are either: tidal, based on sea levels; gravimetric, based on a geoid; or geodetic, based on the same ellipsoid models of the Earth used for computing <b>horizontal</b> <b>datums.</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{surveying}} and geodesy, a datum is {{a reference}} system or an approximation of the Earth's surface against which positional measurements {{are made for}} computing locations. <b>Horizontal</b> <b>datums</b> are used for describing a point on the Earth's surface, in latitude and longitude or another coordinate system. Vertical datums are used to measure elevations or underwater depths.|$|R
5000|$|The first {{nationwide}} datum in the United States {{was established}} in 1879. At that time, a region of contiguous triangulation existed from Maine to Georgia. The New England Datum was chosen with a benchmark in Maryland, near {{the middle of this}} region, as the <b>horizontal</b> <b>datum,</b> and a second Maryland mark used to define the azimuth (horizontal) direction. [...] To account for the Earth's curvature, the datum used a model called the Clarke spheroid, developed in 1866.|$|E
50|$|Even today, when highly {{accurate}} {{navigational equipment}} {{is readily available}} and universally used, there is still scope for error. Using the incorrect <b>horizontal</b> <b>datum</b> for the chart of an area may mislead the navigator, especially as many charts have not been updated to use modern data. It is also important for the navigator to appreciate that charts may be significantly in error, especially on less frequented coasts. For example, a recent revision of the map of South Georgia in the South Atlantic showed that previous maps were in some places in error by several kilometres.|$|E
50|$|The precise {{location}} of each degree confluence uses the WGS 84 <b>horizontal</b> <b>datum,</b> and visitors to degree confluences almost always {{make use of}} GPS receivers. For a successful visit, the visitor must get within 100 metres of the confluence point, and post a narrative and several photographs to the project website. A visit, or attempted visit, which does not conform to these rules may still be recorded on the website as an incomplete visit. The project encourages visits to degree confluences which have been visited previously, and many confluence points in North America and Europe have been visited several times.|$|E
50|$|Reference Datum:The {{reference}} datum is {{a reference}} plane that allows accurate, and uniform, measurements to any {{point on the}} aircraft. The location of the reference datum is established by the manufacturer and is defined in the aircraft flight manual. The <b>horizontal</b> reference <b>datum</b> is an imaginary vertical plane or point, placed along the longitudinal axis of the aircraft, from which all horizontal distances are measured for weight and balance purposes. There is no fixed rule for its location, {{and it may be}} located forward of the nose of the aircraft. For helicopters, it may be located at the rotor mast, the nose of the helicopter, or even at a point in space ahead of the helicopter. While the <b>horizontal</b> reference <b>datum</b> can be anywhere the manufacturer chooses, most small training helicopters have the <b>horizontal</b> reference <b>datum</b> 100 inches forward of the main rotor shaft centerline. This is to keep all the computed values positive. The lateral reference datum is usually located {{at the center of the}} helicopter.|$|R

30|$|Digital {{elevation}} {{data was}} collected from the GeoBase Web portal of Canada. The source data was extracted from the National Topographic Data Base (NTDB) or various data acquired from the provinces and territories. Digital data at the scale of 1 : 50, 000 were chosen for the study area. The grid spacing, based on geographic coordinates, was in the resolution of 0.75 arc seconds. Ground Elevations were recorded in meters relative to Mean Sea Level (MSL), based on the North American Datum 1983 (NAD 83) <b>horizontal</b> reference <b>datum.</b> The DEM sections were first converted to raster files and then combined using ArcGIS tools. The obtained DEM map of Jackpine watershed is shown in Figure  2.|$|R
50|$|The <b>horizontal</b> <b>datum</b> is {{the model}} used to measure {{positions}} on the Earth. A specific point on the Earth can have substantially different coordinates, depending on the datum {{used to make the}} measurement. There are hundreds of local horizontal datums around the world, usually referenced to some convenient local reference point. Contemporary datums, based on increasingly accurate measurements of the shape of the Earth, are intended to cover larger areas. The WGS 84 datum, which is almost identical to the NAD83 datum used in North America and the ETRS89 datum used in Europe, is a common standard datum.|$|E
50|$|As {{more new}} surveys and {{previously}} isolated survey networks {{were incorporated into}} the system, it became increasingly difficult {{to make the necessary}} corrections. By the mid-1920s, it was realized that the coordinate system needed to be adjusted. From 1927 to 1932, the approximately 25,000 existing control locations were recalculated and a new coordinate system developed, known as NAD27. The new system continued to use the 1901 coordinates of Meades Ranch as its <b>horizontal</b> <b>datum,</b> and the Clarke spheroid as its model for the Earth's surface. However, it now defined horizontal directions in terms of 175 Laplace azimuths, which use astronomical azimuths corrected for the difference between the astronomic and geodetic meridians. Under NAD27, the azimuth to the Waldo station changed by about 5".|$|E

Workshop space is shaped as a mass supporting a great, publicly accessible belvedere from which the entire city can be viewed in a 200-degree. This <b>horizontal</b> <b>datum</b> is then broken, horizon-like, by an architectural landscape of steps, terraces and pavilions that frame views of Alcatraz, Coit Tower, and the shifting pastoral maritime landscape of San Francisco Bay beyond. In so doing, the roof becomes the frame through which the viewer perceives both the city and its occupants. Quotations from similar Corbusian buildings of the period are everywhere such as the light cannons of LaTourette or the hand railings standard in the Atelier.

40|$|Glacial {{mass balance}} {{estimated}} through the geodetic method requires glacial surface coordinate observations from {{historical and contemporary}} sources. Contemporary observations and historical topographic maps are typically referenced to separate horizontal and vertical datums and observed with different sampling intervals. This research demonstrates the sensitivity of glacial change detection to the datum considerations and sampling schemes through case studies of Andrei, Bridge and Peyto glaciers in Western Canada. To simulate the procedure of observing the glacial surfaces, profile lines were sampled from Digital Elevation Model (DEMs) on contour intervals for historical data and horizontal intervals for contemporary data. Profile lines from the following scenarios were compared: (1) different horizontal and vertical sampling schemes; (2) the <b>horizontal</b> <b>datum</b> was correctly reconciled but the vertical datum was not; (3) the vertical datum was correctly reconciled but the <b>horizontal</b> <b>datum</b> was not; (4) both the horizontal and vertical datums were correctly reconciled; and (5) both the horizontal and vertical datums were incorrectly reconciled. Vertical errors of up to 6. 9 m, 6. 0 m and 5. 0 m were observed due to sampling effects and vertical errors of 22. 2 m, 9. 9 m and 55. 0 m were observed due to datum inconsistencies on Bridge, Andrei and Peyto glacier respectively. <b>Horizontal</b> <b>datum</b> inconsistencies manifested as erratic levels of growth or downwasting along the glacial surface profile and vertical datum errors manifested as a consistent vertical offset. Datum inconsistencies were identified to contribute errors of up to 257. 2 × 10 6 m 3 (or 87 %) and 54. 6 × 10 6 m 3 (or 580 %) of estimated volume change below and above the equilibrium line respectively on Peyto Glacier.

40|$|In this {{contribution}} we formulate {{and solve}} the problem of determining transformation parameters in the transformation between a geodetic coordinate system (G-System) and the Conventional Terrestrial (geocentric) coordinate system (CT-system), or equivalently, between the datums associated with these systems.

It is shown that if the heights of these points above the <b>horizontal</b> <b>datum</b> are disregarded, as Vanek and Steeves [1996] argued they should be, one can obtain transformation parameters of a <b>horizontal</b> <b>datum</b> positioned at “the origin of the geodetic network ” (called also the “datum point”, or “fundamental datum point ” by some people) and oriented with respect to the Local Astronomical coordinate system at this “origin”, to a very good accuracy.

The paper aimed to present a list of error sources and describe the major contributors of error for positional accuracy with practical examples using new ASPRS standard, “Geospatial Data Accuracy and the New Mapping Accuracy Standard”. We consider to present few important considerations about the resultant positional accuracy for the orthophotos obtained with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), using the new standard of the American Society of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ASPRS) which is the major standards body for this profession. Positional accuracy means the accuracy of the position of features, including horizontal and vertical positions, with respect to <b>horizontal</b> and vertical <b>datums</b> and, as a conclusion, positional accuracy for the orthophotos, obtained with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), {{is a product of the}} entire drone system (aircraft, sensors, operation, and processing software) not any single component.

It is concentrically zoned from a biotite granodiorite/adamellite rim that grades over a narrow boundary into a hornblende-biotite tonalite/granodiorite core. Megacrystic alkali feldspar is sporadically developed in both zones. The pluton is cut by felsic dikes that have coexisting biotite, garnet, and muscovite and is enveloped by Abukuma-type, sillimanite-grade schist, amphibolite and quartzite. Major-element analyses indicate a narrow Si 02 range from 68...|$|R
