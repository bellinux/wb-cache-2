Floor buffers were invented to scrub and polish the floor with linoleum surface. The machines use rotary brushes with soft material to clean and make the floor shine. For marble and wood floors, <b>floor</b> <b>polishers</b> may be used to apply protective coating to floor.|$|E

5000|$|From 1935 {{through the}} 1980s, {{continuous}} improvements and refinements {{were made to}} the Kirby home care system. One of the popular selling points is that it can be easily configured into a canister vacuum, hand portable vacuum, air pump, <b>floor</b> <b>polisher,</b> and more.

Malcolm Arnold's A Grand, Grand Overture, Op. 57 (1956), is a 20th-century parody of the late 19th century concert overture, scored for an enormous orchestra with organ, additional brass instruments, and obbligato parts for four rifles, three Hoover vacuum cleaners (two uprights in B, one horizontal with detachable sucker in C), and an electric <b>floor</b> <b>polisher</b> in E; it is dedicated [...] "to President Hoover".|$|R
50|$|Security guards Chuck and Bobby {{play a game}} of Red light/Green light {{while being}} night watchmen for Howard County Bank and Trust and are obsessed with {{elaborate}} schemes of would-be thieves. They hear a sound coming from a <b>floor</b> <b>polisher</b> that Ernest is trying to turn on for operation - he works as a night custodian at the bank - and dreams that he would be a clerk, but he ends up making a mess in the bank and he becomes magnetic from a mishap with the <b>floor</b> <b>polisher.</b> The next day, bank president Oscar Pendlesmythe's assistant, Charlotte Sparrow requires him to clean up his supernatural mess. Pendlesmythe wants to terminate Ernest's employment at the bank, but Charlotte has a soft heart for misfits and stray dogs, so she argues on his behalf. Ernest takes a bath at home in a tumble dry washing machine and uses a blow dryer with a windtunnel force for his evening dinner with Charlotte in a restaurant. He later receives in the mail a summons to jury duty in court and tells the two watchmen about it. During the trial Dracup Maximum Security Prison convict Rubin Bartlett notices that death row inmate Felix Nash is a dead ringer for Ernest. Rubin's lawyer convinces the jury to tour the prison, where Ernest is kidnapped by Nash and another inmate named Lyle and forced to switch places with Nash. Even though he tries to tell the guards he is not Nash, they refuse to believe him. Ernest also does not know that he has a death sentence which is for Nash.|$|R
50|$|At the hospital, Mma Ramotswe {{meets with}} Dr Cronje, who feels these deaths {{were all of}} natural causes. Their {{conversation}} is tender, as she senses his feeling of belonging nowhere as a biracial man, in contrast to her knowing exactly where she fits in life, in Africa. She then speaks to the cleaner, who uses a very long extension cord to clean {{the area where the}} deaths occurred. This woman recently changed her procedure; she had been unplugging a machine so she could plug in the <b>floor</b> <b>polisher</b> she operated. This is the explanation for the deaths, which Tati Monyena learned, and then directed her never to use the outlets in that room. The woman did not know the effect of her prior procedure and needs her job. They resolve this delicate situation without putting the blame on her, the lowest level staff.|$|R
50|$|In 1962 Georgiy Daneliya invited Shpalikov for a joint effort, and {{together}} they wrote a comedy film Walking the Streets of Moscow. Similar to Ilyich's Gate in tone and message, it seemed suspicious to the Artistic Council at first as they saw it as another movie about «young people wandering around the city doing nothing». But after Daneliya assured one of the head officials at the State Committee for Cinematography that they had nothing tricky on their minds, the work became «easy, fast and fun». When the film was ready, the Council was still unsure {{what to make of}} it. Daneliya and Shaplikov then came up with a «meaningful» episode (a <b>floor</b> <b>polisher</b> who works at the house of a big writer and criticizes beginning writers on this account). According to Daneliya, the pun was obvious, but the Council «was smarter than we thought and pretended they didn't notice anything».|$|R
5000|$|In 1963 Daneliya {{invited a}} young talent Gennady Shpalikov to {{collaborate}} {{on his first}} comedy film. By that time Shpalikov had already fallen out of favour for writing Ilyich's Gate, a movie which Nikita Khrushchev compared to an ideological diversion. To avoid censorship, Danelia {{paid a visit to}} Vladimir Baskakov, one of the head officials at the State Committee for Cinematography, and assured him they had nothing tricky on their minds. After that the work became «easy, fast and fun». They ended up with a movie Walking the Streets of Moscow inspired by the French New Wave, similar to Ilyich's Gate in style and mood. This alarmed the Artistic Council, an executive body responsible for pre-production and post-production. They saw no point in the movie. Daneliya and Shaplikov then came up with a «meaningful» episode (a <b>floor</b> <b>polisher</b> who works at the house of a big writer and criticizes beginning writers on this account), mocking the Council along the way, and a new genre of [...] "lyric (or sad) comedy" [...] which became Daneliya's trademark.|$|R
60|$|He {{knew the}} masters {{in the other}} arts also. If {{he had a problem}} in {{architecture}} or medaling or painting to decide, he went to Mead or St. Gaudens, or Blashfield. Under his administration the White House had resumed its fine colonial character. At his direction Mead and McKim had restored it to the noble simplicity of Madison's time. They had cleared out the business offices and removed the absurd mixture of political machinery and household furniture which had accumulated under the rule of his predecessors, most of whom (coming from small inland towns) knew nothing of any art but government, and in some cases not too much of that. On this particular visit I recall the fact that repairs were going on, for the President invited me to take luncheon with his family, and we ate in a small room {{on the front of the}} house for the reason that the dining-room was in process of being restored and the howl of the <b>floor</b> <b>polisher</b> was resounding through the hall.|$|R
40|$|The {{computerized}} database {{is fundamentally}} changing society. From communication, to government, transport, shopping, friendship, health, education, narrative {{and even the}} way we watch film, the database is radically transforming our lives. And yet we are only barely aware of its existence, we don't really know what a database is : like electricity, it's pervasive and all around us, but we cannot actually see it. Digital media artists YOHA set about making the database visible. Working with Bristol City Council in England, they use local government expenditure to explore {{the relationship between the}} database, power and expenditure. Turning the pounds sterling of expenditure into the pounds per square inch of pneumatic pressure, they make a suite of engineered mechanical contraptions : a Potato Cannon, an Old People Pneumatic <b>Floor</b> <b>Polisher,</b> an Expenditure Riding Saddle and a Library Book Stabber. But as they tour these contraptions around Bristol, they become embroiled in the more visceral realities of the city, {{in the form of the}} Royal Wedding, local anti Tesco riots and the censorship of a local outdoor cinema. "Invisible Airs" is very much a story of our time, of our obsessions with the virtual world and its uneasy relationship to the physical world that we actually inhabit.

25|$|Arnold was a {{relatively}} conservative composer of tonal works, but a prolific and popular one. He acknowledged Hector Berlioz as an influence, alongside Gustav Mahler, Béla Bartók and jazz. Several commentators have drawn a comparison with Jean Sibelius. Arnold's most significant works are {{generally considered to be}} his nine symphonies. He also wrote a number of concertos, including one for guitar for Julian Bream, one for cello for Julian Lloyd Webber, two for clarinet for Frederick Thurston and Benny Goodman respectively, one for harmonica for Larry Adler and one – enthusiastically welcomed at its premiere during the 1969 Proms – for three hands on two pianos for the husband-and-wife team of Cyril Smith and Phyllis Sellick. His sets of dances — comprising two sets of English Dances (Opp. 27 and 33), along with one set each of Scottish Dances (Op. 59), Cornish Dances (Op. 91), Irish Dances (Op. 126), and Welsh Dances (Op. 138) — are mainly in a lighter vein and are popular both in their original orchestral guise and in later wind and brass band arrangements. The English Dances also form the basis for Kenneth MacMillan's short ballet Solitaire, {{and one of them is}} used as the theme music for the British television programme What the Papers Say (the Cornish Dances provide the theme music for the television programmes of the cook Rick Stein). Arnold also wrote some highly successful concert overtures, including Beckus the Dandipratt (an important stepping stone in his early career), the strikingly scored Tam o' Shanter (based on the famous Robert Burns poem), the rollicking A Grand Grand Overture (written for a Hoffnung Festival and featuring three vacuum cleaners and a <b>floor</b> <b>polisher,</b> all in turn polished off by a firing squad in uproarious mock 1812 manner), and the dramatic Peterloo Overture (commissioned by the Trades Union Congress to commemorate the historic massacre of protesting workers in Manchester). Another popular short work is his Divertimento for Flute, Oboe and Clarinet (Op. 37). Arnold is also known for his relatively large number of compositions and arrangements of his own compositions for brass band.|$|R
