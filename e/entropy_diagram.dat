40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{relation}} between the grading curve and a physical property (or property function) is described by a transfer function. It is practically impossible to determine empirically a transfer function due to {{the large number of}} the grading curves. It is assumed that the problem can be simplified using the grading entropy concept of Lőrincz (1986), treating together those grading curves that map into the same non-normalised <b>entropy</b> <b>diagram</b> point. In this paper the main properties of the grading entropy map are analysed (e. g. the continuity properties, the shape of the <b>entropy</b> <b>diagram</b> and the inverse image of the <b>entropy</b> <b>diagram</b> points). On the basis of these, a general transfer function generation method is outlined. ...|$|E
40|$|A {{transfer}} function describes {{the relation between}} the grading curve and some physical property or physical property function of a soil. It can not be determined empirically due to the large number of possible grading curves. To overcome this difficulty, a double interpolation technique is suggested based on some measured data and the grading entropy concept. The first interpolation is made in the grading <b>entropy</b> <b>diagram</b> on the basis of some "optimal" grading curve data. The so-determined preliminary {{transfer function}} is then extended onto the inverse image of the <b>entropy</b> <b>diagram</b> points by a second interpolation or by a curve-fitting technique. In this paper, a double interpolation method to find a transfer function to predict the soil water retention curve for well-graded sands from soil grading data is described. An experimental program and measured data to validate the method is also presented...|$|E

Considering the realistic case of an InP based NWFET, we present current-voltage characteristics and <b>entropy</b> <b>diagrams</b> for a range of equilibrium and non-equilibrium states.

40|$|The direct {{interpolation}} of {{a transfer}} function needs exponentially many data {{in terms of}} the number of the fractions in the grading curve. The suggested transfer function construction method - based on a double approximation technique, the grading entropy concept and at most quadratic many data {{in terms of the}} fraction number – is tested on the example of the dry density of sands here using some previously measured data. In the first approximation step a “preliminary transfer function” is interpolated in the nonnormalized grading <b>entropy</b> <b>diagram</b> on the basis of some “optimal” soil data. In the second approximation step the preliminary transfer function is extended to the space of the possible grading curves with the constant function. The so determined transfer function is tested against an independent “non-optimal” data set, measured on some soil series with basically continuous (i. e., not gap-graded) grading curves.
