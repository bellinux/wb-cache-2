5|$|Shortly {{before his}} death in 1953, Stalin {{considered}} launching a new purge against Mikoyan, Vyacheslav Molotov, and several other Party leaders. Mikoyan and others gradually began to fall out of favor and, in one instance, were accused of plotting against Stalin. Stalin's plans never came to fruition, however, as he died before <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>put</b> them into motion. Mikoyan originally argued in favor of keeping Stalin's right-hand man Beria from punishment but later gave in to popular support among Party members for his arrest. Mikoyan remained in the government after Stalin's death, in the post of Minister of Trade, under Malenkov. He supported Nikita Khrushchev in the power struggle to succeed Stalin, and became First Deputy Premier in recognition of his services.|$|E
5|$|In June Metternich left Vienna to {{personally}} handle negotiations at Gitschin in Bohemia. When he arrived he benefitted from the hospitality of Princess Wilhelmine, Duchess of Sagan and began {{an affair with}} her that lasted several months. No other mistress ever achieved such influence over Metternich as Wilhelmine, and {{he would continue to}} write to her after their separation. Meanwhile, French Foreign Minister Hugues-Bernard Maret remained elusive, though Metternich did manage to discuss the state of affairs with the Tsar on 18–19 June at Opotschna. In talks which would later be ratified as the Reichenbach Convention they agreed on general peace demands and set out a process by which Austria could enter the war on the Coalition side. Shortly afterwards Metternich was invited to join Napoleon at Dresden, where <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>put</b> the terms directly. Though no reliable record of their meeting on 26 June 1813 exists, it seems it was a stormy but effective meeting. Agreement was finally reached as Metternich was about to leave: peace talks would start in Prague in July and run until 20 August. In agreeing to this Metternich had ignored the Reichenbach Convention, and this angered Austria's Coalition allies. The Conference of Prague would never properly meet, since Napoleon gave his representatives Armand Caulaincourt and the Count of Narbonne insufficient powers to negotiate. At the informal discussions held in lieu of the conference, Caulaincourt implied that Napoleon would not negotiate until an allied army threatened France itself. This convinced Metternich, and, after an ultimatum Metternich issued to France went unheeded, Austria declared war on 12 August.|$|E
25|$|During {{the summer}} of 1974, Gibson felt hopeful <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>put</b> {{together}} a winning streak, but he continually encountered swelling in his knee. In January 1975, Gibson announced he would retire {{at the end of}} the 1975 season, admittedly using baseball to help cope with his recent divorce from his former wife, Charline. During the 1975 season, he went 3–10 with a 5.04 ERA.|$|E

25|$|In the morning, Castello Branco would twice {{try to stop}} Mourão's {{march on}} Rio. At the same time, news of the march had reached General Argemiro Assis Brasil, João Goulart's {{military}} aide, who felt confident <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>put</b> the rebellion down. As the day progressed, minor revolts and military actions ensued, such as Castello Branco's barricades at the Ministry of War building, and at the , in Rio de Janeiro. Despite this, the crucial support needed for the coup (that of General Kruel's 2nd Army) {{had not yet been}} implemented.|$|E
25|$|When {{war broke}} out against Nazi Germany in 1939, he {{immediately}} volunteered for the British army, feeling that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>put</b> his military training to good use to fight against fascism. Instead of being sent abroad to fight, he was stationed in Britain, where he was set to work training new recruits in various combat techniques, and as such was stationed {{at a variety of}} different barracks. In 1940 he was stationed at Whitstable, though soon moved to Ashford, and the following year, his first son, Tony, was born. He was subsequently moved to Pembrokeshire in Wales, where he began having an affair with his secretary. Soon after this he divorced his wife, who likewise was also having an affair. Meanwhile, his war work largely involved working as an instructor in Anti-aircraft gunnery during World War II. He also wrote an instruction manual for a Bofors gun.|$|E

[...] In a 1998 Boston Globe article, Paul refers to a tattoo of Woody Guthrie on his right shoulder saying that Woody's image {{was the only thing}} <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>put</b> on his body that would be [...] "like a badge of who he was." [...] Paul's tattoo of Woody Guthrie resulted in a chance meeting with Nora Guthrie, Woody Guthrie's daughter, at a Folk Alliance Conference when Nora asked to see Paul's tattoo. [...] That chance meeting resulted in Paul being invited to perform at a Woody Guthrie tribute show at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland, Ohio. [...] The 10-day celebration, held in September 1996, included other notable musicians such as Bruce Springsteen, Billy Bragg, The Indigo Girls and Ani DiFranco.

The people around him felt that the media had already made a {{sensation}} about the paedophile allegations. He continued to blame the press for his downfall and called them [...] "the worst enemy in the world", alleging 'entrapment' by them by paying local girls in a bar to arrange a photo-scoop. He did not comment about his previous conviction for downloading child pornography several years earlier.|$|E

[...] Ashley Cooper also named Gonzales, whom [...] "I never beat on the tour. But I did beat him a couple of times on clay where his serve wasn’t as good." [...] Gonzales's frequent opponent Frank Sedgman said, [...] "I played against probably the greatest of all time, Jack Kramer. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>put</b> his serve on a dime and had a great first volley.

2500|$|In 1916, the Oakland Tribune {{published}} an article ranking Snow as one of North America's greatest all-around athletes, naming Snow, Elmer Oliphant and Christy Mathewson as the runners-up to Jim Thorpe. [...] The Tribune wrote of Snow:"Undoubtedly {{one of the greatest}} was the late Neil Snow of Michigan. [...] Snow stood {{as one of the great}} football players of the game. [...] He was an all-American end and a great plunging full back. [...] As a ball player he batted over [...]390 for Michigan his last two years and received at least three good offers from big league clubs. [...] He was one of the best college first basemen that ever lived. [...] On the track Snow could high jump around six feet; <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>put</b> the shot 45 feet; he was a fine hurdler.

2500|$|For 11 months, Abagnale {{impersonated}} a chief resident pediatrician in a Georgia hospital {{under the}} alias Frank Williams. He chose this course {{after he was}} nearly arrested disembarking a flight in New Orleans. Afraid of possible capture, he retired temporarily to Georgia. When filling out a rental application he impulsively listed his occupation as [...] "doctor", fearing that the owner might check with Pan Am if he wrote [...] "pilot". After befriending a real doctor {{who lived in the}} same apartment complex, he agreed to act as a supervisor of resident interns as a favor until the local hospital could find someone else to take the job. The position was not difficult for Abagnale because supervisors did no real medical work. However, he was nearly exposed when an infant almost died from oxygen deprivation because {{he had no idea what}} a nurse meant when she said there was a [...] "blue baby." [...] He was able to fake his way through most of his duties by letting the interns handle the cases coming in during his late-night shift, setting broken bones and other mundane tasks. He left the hospital only after he realized <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>put</b> lives at risk by his inability to respond to life-and-death situations.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the same}} time, the nizam was {{involved}} in an alliance with the Marathas. Both he and the Marathas' ruling peshwa, Madhavrao I were concerned over the expansionist threat posed by Hyder Ali. After assisting the Marathas in dealing with one of their confederates 1765, the allies began developing plans to invade Mysore. When the British began occupying the Northern Circars in March 1766, the nizam objected, issuing threatening letters to company authorities in Madras. He considered going to war against the company, but his poor financial condition made this impossible. Instead he negotiated a treaty with the company in November 1766. Under its terms the company received {{four of the five}} circar immediately (Guntur, the fifth, having been granted to the nizam's son as a jaghir, was to be delivered upon the son's death) in exchange for 7 lakh rupees or military support to the nizam in his endeavours. One historian describes the nizam's agreement to the treaty as one of financial necessity, and that he was [...] "resentful" [...] of English power. Pursuant to this treaty, the company provided two battalions of troops to the nizam. Under the treaty, there were no limits placed on the number of troops the nizam could request, nor were there checks on the uses (offensive or defensive) to which <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>put</b> them.|$|E
2500|$|Soap Opera Digest {{revealed}} that Yancey's Cameron {{would play a}} key role in the upcoming storyline featuring Celeste Perrault (Beverly Todd) and Lexie Carver (Renée Jones). According to Owens, with the recast, the character of Cameron would develop an edge and bring more excitement; not unstable, just edgier. In an interview with Soapdom.com, Owens {{revealed that}} Cameron has issues that need to be explored. The actor explained that the character has [...] "skeletons" [...] in his closet and those secrets will eventually bring him to a breaking point. Owens drew on personal experience to help him prepare for the role as he also faced issues with his family — Cameron has to develop a sense of family and what it means to him because he does not grow up in the [...] "ideal" [...] family. Owens also avoided seeing clips of Yancey's portrayal to make sure <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>put</b> his own spin on the character. However, he did take the opportunity to learn more about the cast members and Days as a whole. Cameron wants a relationship with the his late sister, Lexie's family, the DiMeras because he longs for familial acceptance, something he did not grow up with. According to Owens, Cameron has strong feelings for Abigail and does not see her ex, Chad DiMera (Casey Jon Deidrick) as an obstacle. Owens revealed that he hoped for the chance to work with the veteran Mascolo as Stefano.|$|E

2500|$|Remembered by {{his contemporaries}} as a tragic figure who held much {{literary}} promise, Thomas Parker Sanborn {{came to be}} linked {{with a group of}} other 1890s Harvard poets who died young, including Hugh McCulloch, Philip Henry Savage, Trumbull Stickney and George Cabot Lodge. Santayana published two obituaries for Sanborn, the first of which appeared in the Harvard Monthly Volume eight, Number One, March 1889. [...] "The rare facility and delicacy of Mr. Sanborn's verses," [...] Santayana wrote, [...] "and his general literary aptitude, marked him out among his class-mates. His witty conversation, and much more the inward seriousness and idealism of his nature endeared him to those that knew him well. He was too sensitive and retiring to like general society, or to speak out his thoughts: he was more at ease with his pen. Mr. Sanborn had not only great felicity of style in his light verses, but <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>put</b> into them what is far more rare in the work of very young men,-- a true love of whatever is charming, beautiful and ideal. Yet with this idealism was joined a genuine and pathetic modesty. He was afraid he was wrong, he longed for recognition and external encouragement. This premature death is a calamity not to Mr. Sanborn's family and intimate friends alone. The class of '86 and Harvard College lose a man whose life would have been devoted to letters, and whose genuine and versatile talent would hardly have failed to leave some mark in the world." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rawle {{explained}} that Silas has accepted {{he is to}} be in the secure psychiatric unit until he dies so he plans to manipulate the outside world from inside as a means of living out his murderous fantasies. Rawle revealed that Silas has a [...] "nagging feeling" [...] that he made a mistake in killing India and that he wishes <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>put</b> it right. He said that his character meant to murder Texas so he now wants to kill her as she is the [...] "one that got away". Hendrickse-Spendlove also commented that Silas initially intended to kill Texas so she is [...] "the final piece of the puzzle for him, and then his 'work' will be complete". Silas tells Texas another murder will soon occur which is an opportunity to [...] "play games". He is [...] "delighted" [...] to have an audience during the visits and begins to [...] "make lots of threats". Rawle {{explained that}} Silas sees that Texas has India's ring which is [...] "symbolic" [...] for Silas as he had previously taken it as a trophy. Texas taunts Silas with the ring and agrees to exchange it for information on Lynsey's murder. Rawle explained that Silas tells Texas that Will Savage (James Atherton) is responsible for Lynsey's murder which is because [...] "Silas knows that Texas and Will are close, so he points the finger of suspicion his way". He said that Silas would [...] "put quite a few people in the frame" [...] for the murder. Hendrickse-Spendlove said that Texas is [...] "manipulated" [...] by Silas when he makes her believe Will is responsible for Lynsey's murder. Silas escapes from hospital and goes to visit Texas. Hendrickse-Spendlove explained that Texas [...] "opens her front door, sees Silas and thinks, 'This is it - my life is over', to see him standing there with no police restraint, knowing that he murdered her sister India, is absolutely petrifying". Silas tells Texas that he now intends to complete what he began. Hendrickse-Spendlove would not reveal whether Texas survives the ordeal but said that Texas is [...] "never going to be safe again" [...] regardless of the outcome. In August 2012, Laura-Jayne Tyler from Inside Soap confirmed that there were no current plans for Silas to return, but the door had been left open for him. On 20 January 2016, Silas is set to return to visit Trevor Royle (Greg Wood) in prison after he was framed by Lindsey Butterfield (Sophie Austin) for the murders and attempted murders at Dee Valley Hospital. Silas left again after he killed Lindsey.|$|E
