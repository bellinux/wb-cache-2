40|$|The {{difference}} in phenotypes of queens and workers is {{a hallmark of}} the highly eusocial insects. The caste dimorphism is often described as a switch-controlled polyphenism, in which environmental conditions decide an individual’s caste. Using theoretical modeling and empirical data from honeybees, we show that there is no discrete larval developmental switch. Instead, a combination of larval developmental plasticity and nurse worker feeding behavior make up a colony-level social and physiological system that regulates development and produces the caste dimorphism. Discrete queen and worker phenotypes are the result of discrete <b>feeding</b> <b>regimes</b> imposed by nurses, whereas a range of experi-mental <b>feeding</b> <b>regimes</b> produces a continuous range of phenotypes. Worker ovariole numbers are reduced through feeding-regime-mediated reduction in juvenile hormone titers, involving reduced sugar in the larval food.

50|$|The {{observations}} that long-term feed restriction does not significantly affect lep expression in Atlantic salmon {{has also been}} noted in other teleosts. However {{it is likely that}} prolonged feed restriction can influence several endocrine parameters to adapt to the nutritional condition. For example, in common carp, a rapid response in ob gene expression in hepatic tissue of common carp shortly after feeding, but no changes in expression in response to different long-term <b>feeding</b> <b>regime</b> was observed. These authors suggested that this effect could be {{explained by the fact that}} starved fish do not lose weight as rapidly as mammals, a consequence of being ectothermic and possessing a much lower standard metabolic rate, and therefore can withstand longer periods of starvation. A similar study on grass carp showed that chronic injection of species-specific Lep did not affect long-term food intake and body weight, while acute injection decreased food intake. Conversely, Murashita et al., (unpublished results) observed increased proopiomelanocortin a1(pomca1) levels following chronic injection of Lep in Atlantic salmon, which suggests that chronic exposure to elevated Lep levels can decrease food intake through the Pomc pathway in this species. Recent studies in Atlantic salmon did not observe any difference of feed restriction in circulating plasma levels, which contrasts recent results in rainbow trout and suggest that the relation between circulating lep levels and energy status differs from that in mammals. However, salmon RIA appears to allow interspecies assessment of plasma lep levels. This only confirms that more comprehensive studies are needed for conclusive data interpretation. Studies on rainbow trout also implicated Lep as an anorectic hormone as in mammals. Injection of rainbow trout with recombinant trout leptin (rt-leptin) resulted in a significantly reduced appetite over two days that coincided with a decrease in hypothalamic mRNA expression of neuropeptide Y (npy) and increase of pomc mRNAs, respectively. Whether these observations are due to species-specific differences in long-term leptin regulation of appetite or growth is not known, however, consensus data indicate that the effects of Lep on appetite regulation may be short-term in teleosts.|$|E

40|$|AbstractNutrient {{supply in}} organic pig {{production}} {{is characterized by}} limited amino acids (AA) availability due to the preferable use of home-grown feedstuffs and restrictions on purchased feedstuffs. This can cause large variations {{in the quality of}} diets, carcasses, and pork. The objective of two feeding trials was to assess the interactions between feeding regimes, genotype, and birth weight on carcass and pork quality. A control regime was compared with two feeding regimes that were partly (only in the finishing phase (FIN)) or both in the growing and finishing phase (GRO+FIN) restricted to home-grown feedstuffs, thus differing in AA supply. Using an isocaloric ration, individually housed pigs differing in genotype (Experiment 1) or birth weight (Experiment 2) were allocated to the three feeding regimes. The highest daily live weight gain, the best feed conversion, and the highest values for performance traits and meat composition were achieved by Du×DL pigs, while the highest carcass yield was achieved by Pi×(DL×DE) pigs. In Experiment 1, performance traits were significantly higher in the control <b>feeding</b> <b>regime</b> than in the GRO+FIN treatment, with the <b>feeding</b> <b>regime</b> FIN being intermediate. Lean meat percentage was significantly lower in the GRO+FIN <b>feeding</b> <b>regime</b> than in the control while the fat area was not influenced by <b>feeding</b> <b>regime.</b> Intramuscular fat content was higher under the GRO+FIN <b>feeding</b> <b>regime</b> without AA supplementation than in the control.

40|$|In recent years, the Danish {{milk market}} has shown an {{increase}} in the consumption of organic milk as well as a growing variety of milk with specific features including farm milk. The production of milk from a single farm and pasture-based (PB) <b>feeding</b> <b>regimes</b> is of special interest as it implies a “sense of place” or terroir. The PB <b>feeding</b> <b>regimes</b> vary with season and might also vary on a day-to-day basis. It is therefore important to understand the impact of the feed on the sensory properties of the milk [1]. This study aims at demonstrating how analytical sensory analysis can provide important information about the influence of breed, season and variation in farm management from PB <b>feeding</b> <b>regimes</b> on the sensory properties of organic farm milk. The study was performed in 2007 and 2008 during two seasons (spring/autumn) representing 28 milk samples from 7 organic farms with either Holstein or Jersey cows. PB <b>feeding</b> <b>regimes</b> were based on pastures with varying amounts of white clover together with perennial ryegrass and supplement feeding with silage and concentrates. Significant results were found for season and breed with a larger variation in sensory flavour properties of spring milk and milk from Holstein cows. In general, there was a tendency of the milk being characterized as having a ‘greener’ odour, ‘sweet’ and ‘maize-like’ flavour in spring and a more ‘bitter’ taste in the autumn. The results show a distinct relation between sensory milk properties and the amount of pasture in the ration and white clover in the pasture. Relations to other production conditions such as composition of the supplement feed also tended {{to have an impact on}} the sensory characteristics of the milk. It is thus concluded, that a sensory analytical tool can provide important information about the sensory properties of organic farm milk, reflecting time and place. Seasonal variations appear to be an important factor in the terroir dimension of milk and may be more actively used in relation to communication of the sensory properties to the consumer. ...|$|R
