2500|$|I'm not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> it's about - that's for YOU {{to figure}} out. (I've gotten {{a kick out}} of all the well-meaning interpretations I've read.) ...|$|E
2500|$|In an October {{election}} {{debate with}} Tester, regarding the Iraq War, Burns said that Tester [...] "says our president doesn't have a plan. I think he's got one. He's {{not going to}} tell everyone in the world", and later told Tester, [...] "We're not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> our plan is, Jon, because you're just {{going to go out and}} blow it." [...] These comments were likened by critics to then presidential candidate Richard Nixon's unfulfilled 1968 promise of a [...] "secret plan" [...] to end the war in Vietnam. Burns was also hurt politically when he confronted a U.S. Forest Service Hotshot Crew from Virginia at an airport about a fire.|$|E
6000|$|Williams went on. [...] "He's weak, {{too weak}} to talk much, and so I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> he wants. He wants you to marry him before he dies." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Look here," [...] he said, [...] "what I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> is the truth. What I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> I'd as soon {{say in the}} {{presence}} of the lady as here." ...|$|R
60|$|Admiral Harrington here is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> {{all that}} I have left untold. I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> all that I know, {{and then he}} will follow up with such rags and {{remnants}} as he can find, and <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> what he knows.|$|R
6000|$|... "What do {{you mean}} by talking about a story? I'm not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> a story; I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> make a {{statement}}. A statement is a matter of fact, therefore the exact opposite of a story, which is a matter of fiction. What I am now <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> really happened <b>to</b> me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> {{you want}} to know," [...] the General {{continued}} glancing at a document in his hand. [...] "Well, close the door, Harewood. Out with it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|This time, {{the doctor}} grasped the idea. He looked round cunningly to the door. [...] "Any eavesdroppers?" [...] he asked. [...] "Hush! Whisper--this is serious--whisper! What was it I was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you?</b> <b>What</b> was the secret, old boy?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> I know," [...] {{retorted}} Sammy Jay. [...] "You'll {{find out}} soon enough. And {{when you do}} find out, you'll never steal another tree from our Green Forest. Somebody is going to catch you, and it isn't Farmer Brown's boy either!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> how <b>to</b> {{have trained}} service {{and how to}} make your hotels distinctive. They're good hotels, as hotels go, and you really do give people good coffee and good beds and credit conveniences, as you promise, but your hotels are not distinctive. I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> how <b>to</b> make them so." ...|$|R
60|$|And {{this is all}} I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> {{about how}} Reddy Fox went fishing.|$|R
60|$|RIDGEON. I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you.</b> I did {{it because}} I {{was in love with}} you.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> {{all this}} is for. We are going, lads, to get gold; and if we succeed, as I doubt not we shall, each man on his return will, in {{addition}} to his wages, have a share in the spoil--such a share as will, I hope, make him comfortable for life." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Buddy," [...] I said, [...] "I've {{thought of}} a plan. I'm not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> it is, but you are to consent to it without knowing. I think it will quench Uncle Abimelech, but you must have perfect {{confidence}} in me. You must back me up no matter what I do and let me have my own way in it all." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{do not ask}} {{you to tell me}}. I am not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> is in my heart; and I do not ask you to tell me what is in yours. We {{are free}} Englishmen, who keep {{ourselves}} to ourselves, and think for ourselves, each man in the depths of his own heart; and who are the stronger and the wiser for not talking about our feelings to any man, priest or layman.|$|E
50|$|An omelette is {{what the}} guests need for breakfast. <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> {{something}} about an omelette.|$|R
60|$|And {{this is all}} I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> {{about the}} fuss in the big pine.|$|R
5000|$|We were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> earlier. (past {{form of the}} going-to future, {{formed with}} the past copula were) ...|$|R
6000|$|When {{the first}} {{old man had}} {{finished}} his story, the second, who was leading the two black dogs, said to the genius, [...] "I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> happened to me, and I am sure that you will find my story even more astonishing than the one to which you have just been listening. But when I have related it, will you grant me also the third part of the merchant's punishment?" ...|$|E
60|$|Ah, my {{arms are}} really benumbed. I have been {{pressing}} my {{elbows on the}} arms of my chair, and dreaming that I {{was standing on the}} bridge in front of Dorlcote Mill, as it looked one February afternoon many years ago. Before I dozed off, I was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> Mr. and Mrs. Tulliver were talking about, as they sat by the bright fire in the left-hand parlor, on that very afternoon I have been dreaming of.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then {{you will}} hear what I have to say patiently, and you will believe that I am {{speaking}} for your good, even if my words should distress you?" [...] (Nanina turned away her head.) [...] "Now, tell me; should I be wrong, to begin with, if I said that my brother's pupil, the young nobleman whom we call 'Signor Fabio,' had been {{here to see you}} to-day?" [...] (Nanina started up affrightedly from her stool.) [...] "Sit down again, my child; I am not going to blame you. I am only <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> you must do for the future." ...|$|E
60|$|The moral {{in this is}} {{perfectly}} clear, and I think there's one in they next memory I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> about.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nope," [...] he said lightly, [...] "this {{man from}} the bad, wicked world ain't <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> nothing of the kind. He's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> {{of the good things}} in that world. He's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> how he loved hosses when he was a shaver, and about the first hoss he straddled, and the first hoss he owned. Hosses ain't like men. They're better. They're clean--clean all the way through and back again. And, little fairy, I want <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> one thing--there sure ain't nothing in the world like when you're settin' a tired hoss {{at the end of a}} long day, and when you just speak, and that tired animal lifts under you willing and hustles along. Hosses! They're my long suit. I sure dote on hosses. Yep. I used to be a cowboy once." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I an't a <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you.</b> Get away! I shouldn't <b>tell</b> <b>you,</b> if you was by yourself; {{much less}} with your old {{sweetheart}} here.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now I'm {{going to}} begin at the beginning," [...] he said resolutely. [...] "I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> I ought to have told you before. In the first place, I've never {{been in love with}} other women, but I've had other women. Then I've great faults. I'm very lazy, I'm moody--" [...] He persisted, in spite of her exclamation, [...] "You've got to know the worst of me. I'm lustful. I'm {{overcome}} by a sense of futility--incompetence. I ought never to have asked you to marry me, I expect. I'm a bit of a snob; I'm ambitious--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{found it}} was no use! Well, I thank you for trying. It's curious to think that I once had your trust, your regard, and now I haven't it. You don't mind my remembering that I had? It'll be some little consolation, and I {{believe it will be}} some help. I know I can't {{retrieve}} the past now. It is too late. It seems too preposterous--perfectly lurid--that I could have been <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> a tangle I'd got myself in, and to ask you to help untangle me. I must choke in the infernal coil, but I'd like to have the sweetness of your pity in it--whatever it is." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "To a very {{possible}} Prime Minister," [...] Norgate replied, [...] "but I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> I think, all the same. I'm {{fed up with}} you all. I bring you some certain and sure information, proving conclusively that Germany is maintaining an extraordinary system of espionage over here, {{and you tell me}} to mind my own business. I tell you, Hebblethwaite, you and your Party are thundering good legislators, but you'll ruin the country before you've finished. I've had enough. It seems to me we thoroughly deserve the shaking up we're going to get. I am going to turn German spy myself and work for the other side." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You've {{surprised}} our secret," [...] she exclaimed, [...] "but anyhow, Stephen was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> to-day. We {{were married}} {{the day before}} yesterday." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> {{that you}} might be more happy as Mrs. Sowerby of Chaldicotes than you can be as Miss Dunstable--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... “The story I was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you,</b> boys, {{is an old}} fable {{about making}} enemies. It is called ‘The Bear and the Tomtit.’ ” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Aunt Emmy, I {{thought for}} days over your meaning ... thought until I was dizzy. And then one evening {{it just came}} to me, without any {{thinking}} at all, and I knew that I could give some gifts after all. I thought of something new {{every day for a}} week. At first I didn't think I could give some of them, and then I thought how selfish I was. I would have been willing to pay any amount of money for gifts if I had had it, but I wasn't willing to pay what I had. I got over that, though, Aunt Emmy. Now I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> I did give.|$|E
6000|$|... 18. There is {{this great}} {{advantage}} in the writing real letters, that the direct correspondence is a sufficient reason for saying, {{in or out of}} order, everything that the chances of the day bring into one's head, in connection with the matter in hand; and as such things very usually go out of one's head again, after they get tired of their lodging, they would otherwise never get said at all. And thus to-day, quite out of order, but in very close connection with another part of our subject, I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> I was thinking on Friday evening last, in Covent Garden Theater, as I was looking, and not laughing, at the pantomime of 'Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "All {{the world}} knows, lad, that George, Earl of March and Dunbar, was mightily {{offended}} at Rothesay breaking off the match with his daughter, and marrying {{the child of}} his rival Douglas; but now I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> the world does not know, and which is a secret that would cost many a life, were it to be blabbed abroad, and which I should not tell you, had I not a perfect confidence in your discretion. The anger of March--as he is mostly called {{on this side of}} the border, while in Scotland they more often call him Earl of Dunbar--goes beyond mere displeasure with the Douglas, and sullen resentment against Rothesay. He has sent a confidential messenger to me, intimating that he is ready to acknowledge our king as his sovereign, and place himself and his forces at his disposal.|$|E
6000|$|... "In short, Gran and godfather," [...] says Jemmy, looking up, [...] "the date is this time, and I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> Mr. Edson's story." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The entertainment," [...] he said, [...] "will incur {{no greater}} {{hardship}} upon you {{than a little}} patience. I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> a story." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, yes, of course," [...] {{answered}} Shep. [...] "But er---it all fits in {{with what}} I was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> about in the first place." ...|$|R
