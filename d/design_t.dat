50|$|In 1926, {{the city}} council {{organised}} an open competition for the new layout of the Civic Centre, however, many of the designs were deemed 'Too Ambitious'. As a result, the city engineer was asked {{to work with the}} architects of the Hall of Memory, S. N. Cooke, to create a better <b>design.</b> <b>T.</b> Cecil Howitt of Nottingham was asked to design the first building, which was to become Baskerville House. This was approved in 1936 and construction began in 1938. It became the only component to be built from the plan for the Civic Centre which would have covered all of Centenary Square and the Convention Centre, and included the Masonic Hall (1926-7 Rupert Savage) (demolished 2008) and Birmingham Municipal Bank (recently TSB) building (1931-3 also T. Cecil Howitt) on Broad Street. World War II halted construction of Baskerville House (hence the rear brick wall, intended to be temporary), and after the war the use of Roman Imperial imagery on public buildings went out of fashion. A 1941 model of the proposed Civic Centre, designed by William Haywood, Secretary of The Birmingham Civic Society, is displayed in the Birmingham Museum & Art Gallery.|$|E

In {{contrast}} to general fuzzy systems, i. e., type- 1 FS, the reasons for choosing T 2 FS asresearch topic are that T 2 FS have better noise robustness, uncertain information processingabilities and {{is a relatively new}} research topic. The project will take three years to designT 2 FS in three different learning problems, apply them on different control problems, andimplement the designed type- 2 fuzzy controllers by FPGA. The followings detail theresearch contents of each year. The first year will handle supervised learning problem, wherethe input-output training pairs are available. In this year, a self-organizing type- 2 fuzzyneural network with on-line structure and fast parameter learning abilities will be proposed. The designed T 2 FS will be implemented by FPGA and applied on a noisymulti-input-multi-output temperature control problem. The second year will handle theproblem where the control objective is clear but the desired outputs for T 2 FS training areunavailable. A two-phase swarm intelligence (TPSI) learning algorithm will be proposed toefficiently <b>design</b> <b>T</b> 2 FS with high accuracy. The first and second phases in TPSI will useclustering-aided ant colony optimization and particle swarm optimization algorithms,respectively. The proposed design method will be applied linear motor position control. Thethird year will <b>design</b> <b>T</b> 2 FS in reinforcement learning environment. Design by ant colonyoptimization incorporated with fuzzy Q-leaning will be proposed to reduce error trials.

Cognitive assessments were made {{by means of the}} Graphic Test of Reasoning (GTR) and the Kohs Block <b>Design</b> <b>Test</b> (KBDT). Blood lead levels and other laboratory tests were performed. RESULTS: Children with lead > 10 ug/dl presented greater prevalence of low scores in the Graphic Test of Reasoning (18. 9 % vs. 7. 1 %, p = 0. 049) and in the Kohs Block <b>Design</b> <b>Test</b> (KBDT) (39. 6 % vs. 18. 6 %, p = 0. 01) compared with those with lower lead blood levels. A deficit of 1 category in the Graphic Test of Reasoning was associated with an increase in lead blood level of 16. 78 ug/dl (assuming a linear relationship) and from 1 to 5. 19 ug/dl (logarithmic model). For each 10 ug/dl of increase in lead levels, the Kohs Block <b>Design</b> <b>Test</b> decreases in 6. 24 units (12. 91 in males and 0. 216 in females) (linear model), and an increase from 1 to 10 ug/dl corresponds to a drop of 16. 44 points in the Kohs Block <b>Design</b> <b>Test</b> (31. 19 in males and 3. 98 in females) (logarithmic model).
