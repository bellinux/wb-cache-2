5|$|In {{addition}} to suppressing hepatic <b>glucose</b> production, metformin increases insulin sensitivity, enhances peripheral <b>glucose</b> uptake (by inducing the phosphorylation of GLUT4 enhancer factor), decreases insulin-induced suppression of fatty acid oxidation, and decreases absorption of <b>glucose</b> from the gastrointestinal tract. Increased peripheral use of <b>glucose</b> {{may be due}} to improved insulin binding to insulin receptors. The increase in insulin binding after metformin treatment has also been demonstrated in patients with NIDDM.|$|E
5|$|<b>Glucose,</b> {{dextrose}} or grape sugar, occurs {{naturally in}} fruits and plant juices {{and is the}} primary product of photosynthesis. Most ingested carbohydrates are converted into <b>glucose</b> during digestion {{and it is the}} form of sugar that is transported around the bodies of animals in the bloodstream. It can be manufactured from starch by the addition of enzymes or in the presence of acids. <b>Glucose</b> syrup is a liquid form of <b>glucose</b> that is widely used in the manufacture of foodstuffs. It can be manufactured from starch by enzymatic hydrolysis.|$|E
5|$|In general, {{galactose}} {{does not}} occur {{in the free state}} but is a constituent with <b>glucose</b> of the disaccharide lactose or milk sugar. It is less sweet than <b>glucose.</b> It is a component of the antigens found on the surface of red blood cells that determine blood groups.|$|E
5|$|Metformin's {{main effect}} is to {{decrease}} liver <b>glucose</b> production.|$|E
5|$|The brain consumes up {{to twenty}} percent of the energy used by the human body, more than any other organ. Brain {{metabolism}} normally relies upon blood <b>glucose</b> as an energy source, but during times of low <b>glucose</b> (such as fasting, endurance exercise, or limited carbohydrate intake), the brain uses ketone bodies for fuel with a smaller need for <b>glucose.</b> The brain can also utilize lactate during exercise. Long-chain fatty acids cannot cross the blood–brain barrier, but the liver can break these down to produce ketone bodies. However, short-chain fatty acids (e.g., butyric acid, propionic acid, and acetic acid) and the medium-chain fatty acids, octanoic acid and heptanoic acid, can cross the blood–brain barrier and be metabolized by brain cells. The brain stores <b>glucose</b> in the form of glycogen, albeit in significantly smaller amounts than that found in the liver or skeletal muscle.|$|E
25|$|<b>Glucose</b> {{enters the}} β-cells through the <b>glucose</b> {{transporters}}, GLUT2. These <b>glucose</b> transporters {{have a relatively}} low affinity for <b>glucose,</b> ensuring {{that the rate of}} <b>glucose</b> entry into the β-cells is proportional to the extracellular <b>glucose</b> concentration (within the physiological range). At low blood sugar levels very little <b>glucose</b> enters the β-cells; at high blood <b>glucose</b> concentrations large quantities of <b>glucose</b> enter these cells.|$|E
25|$|Fasting blood <b>glucose</b> {{levels are}} in a {{continuum}} within a given population, with higher fasting <b>glucose</b> levels corresponding to a higher risk for complications caused by the high <b>glucose</b> levels. Impaired fasting <b>glucose</b> {{is defined as a}} fasting <b>glucose</b> that is higher than the upper limit of normal, but not high enough to be classified as diabetes mellitus. Some patients with impaired fasting <b>glucose</b> also may be diagnosed with impaired <b>glucose</b> tolerance, but many have normal responses to a <b>glucose</b> tolerance test.|$|E
25|$|<b>Glucose</b> {{tolerance}} testing (GTT) {{instead of}} fasting <b>glucose</b> can increase diagnosis of impaired <b>glucose</b> tolerance and frank diabetes {{among people with}} PCOS according to a prospective controlled trial. While fasting <b>glucose</b> levels may remain within normal limits, oral <b>glucose</b> tests revealed that up to 38% of asymptomatic women with PCOS (versus 8.5% in the general population) actually had impaired <b>glucose</b> tolerance, 7.5% of those with frank diabetes according to ADA guidelines.|$|E
25|$|Glycogen is a {{branched}} biopolymer {{consisting of}} linear chains of <b>glucose</b> residues {{with an average}} chain length of approximately 10-14 <b>glucose</b> units. <b>Glucose</b> units are linked together linearly by α(1→4) glycosidic bonds from one <b>glucose</b> to the next. Branches {{are linked to the}} chains from which they are branching off by α(1→6) glycosidic bonds between the first <b>glucose</b> of the new branch and a <b>glucose</b> on the stem chain.|$|E
25|$|Many <b>glucose</b> meters {{employ the}} {{oxidation}} of <b>glucose</b> to gluconolactone catalyzed by <b>glucose</b> oxidase (sometimes known as GOx). Others use a similar reaction catalysed instead by another enzyme, <b>glucose</b> dehydrogenase (GDH). This {{has the advantage}} of sensitivity over <b>glucose</b> oxidase but is more susceptible to interfering reactions with other substances.|$|E
25|$|Plasma <b>glucose</b> {{is said to}} be {{maintained}} when there is an equal rate of <b>glucose</b> appearance (entry into the blood) and <b>glucose</b> disposal (removal from the blood). In the healthy individual, the rates of appearance and disposal are essentially equal during exercise of moderate intensity and duration; however, prolonged exercise or sufficiently intense exercise can result in an imbalance leaning towards a higher rate of disposal than appearance, at which point <b>glucose</b> levels fall producing the onset of fatigue. Rate of <b>glucose</b> appearance is dictated by the amount of <b>glucose</b> being absorbed at the gut as well as liver (hepatic) <b>glucose</b> output. Although <b>glucose</b> absorption from the gut is not typically a source of <b>glucose</b> appearance during exercise, the liver is capable of catabolizing stored glycogen (glycogenolysis) as well as synthesizing new <b>glucose</b> from specific reduced carbon molecules (glycerol, pyruvate, and lactate) in a process called gluconeogenesis. The ability of the liver to release <b>glucose</b> into the blood from glycogenolysis is unique, since skeletal muscle, the other major glycogen reservoir, is incapable of doing so. Unlike skeletal muscle, liver cells contain the enzyme glycogen phosphatase, which removes a phosphate group from glucose-6-P to release free <b>glucose.</b> In order for <b>glucose</b> to exit a cell membrane, the removal of this phosphate group is essential. Although gluconeogenesis is an important component of hepatic <b>glucose</b> output, it alone can not sustain exercise. For this reason, when glycogen stores are depleted during exercise, <b>glucose</b> levels fall and fatigue sets in. <b>Glucose</b> disposal, {{the other side of the}} equation, is controlled by uptake of <b>glucose</b> at the working skeletal muscles. During exercise, despite decreased insulin concentrations, muscle increases GLUT4 translocation of and <b>glucose</b> uptake. The mechanism for increased GLUT4 translocation is an area of ongoing research.|$|E
25|$|By catalyzing the {{phosphorylation}} of <b>glucose</b> {{to yield}} <b>glucose</b> 6-phosphate, hexokinases maintain the downhill concentration gradient that favors the facilitated transport of <b>glucose</b> into cells. This reaction also initiates all physiologically relevant pathways of <b>glucose</b> utilization, including glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway. The {{addition of a}} charged phosphate group at the 6-position of hexoses also ensures 'trapping' of <b>glucose</b> and 2-deoxyhexose <b>glucose</b> analogs (e.g. 2-deoxyglucose, and 2-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose) within cells, as charged hexose phosphates cannot easily cross the cell membrane.|$|E
25|$|<b>Glucose</b> {{loading test}} (GLT) – screens for gestational diabetes; if > 140mg/dL, a <b>glucose</b> {{tolerance}} test (GTT) is administered; a fasting <b>glucose</b> > 105mg/dL suggests gestational diabetes.|$|E
25|$|While all neurons use <b>glucose</b> for fuel, certain glucose-sensing neurons {{alter their}} firing rates in {{response}} to rising or falling levels of <b>glucose.</b> These glucose-sensing neurons are concentrated primarily in the ventromedial nucleus and arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus, which regulate many aspects of <b>glucose</b> homeostasis (especially the response to hypoglycemia), fuel utilization, satiety and appetite, and weight maintenance. These neurons are most sensitive to <b>glucose</b> changes in the 0.5–3.5mmol/L <b>glucose</b> range.|$|E
25|$|While {{the regular}} <b>glucose</b> test is taken {{at a certain}} point in time, the <b>glucose</b> {{tolerance}} test involves repeated testing to determine the rate at which <b>glucose</b> is processed by the body.|$|E
25|$|A <b>glucose</b> meter is {{a medical}} device for {{determining}} the approximate concentration of <b>glucose</b> in the blood. The first <b>glucose</b> meter was invented by Leland Clark and Ann Lyons at the Cincinnati Children's Hospital which was first known as a <b>glucose</b> enzyme electrode. The sensor worked by measuring the amount of oxygen consumed by the enzyme.|$|E
25|$|Per the World Health Organization {{people with}} fasting <b>glucose</b> levels from 6.1 to 6.9mmol/l (110 to 125mg/dl) are {{considered}} to have impaired fasting <b>glucose.</b> people with plasma <b>glucose</b> at or above 7.8mmol/l (140mg/dl), but not over 11.1mmol/l (200mg/dl), two hours after a 75g oral <b>glucose</b> load {{are considered to}} have impaired <b>glucose</b> tolerance. Of these two prediabetic states, the latter in particular is a major risk factor for progression to full-blown diabetes mellitus, as well as cardiovascular disease. The American Diabetes Association since 2003 uses a slightly different range for impaired fasting <b>glucose</b> of 5.6 to 6.9mmol/l (100 to 125mg/dl).|$|E
25|$|When blood <b>glucose</b> {{levels are}} high, <b>glucose</b> {{molecules}} {{attach to the}} hemoglobin in red blood cells. The longer hyperglycemia occurs in blood, the more <b>glucose</b> binds to hemoglobin in the red blood cells and the higher the glycated hemoglobin.|$|E
25|$|World Health Organization (WHO) {{criteria}} for impaired fasting <b>glucose</b> {{differs from the}} American Diabetes Association (ADA) criteria, because the normal range of <b>glucose</b> is defined differently by each. Fasting plasma <b>glucose</b> levels 100mg/dL (5.5mmol/L) and higher {{have been shown to}} increase complication rates significantly, however, WHO opted to keep its upper limit of normal at under 110mg/dL for fear of causing too many people to be diagnosed as having impaired fasting <b>glucose,</b> whereas the ADA lowered the upper limit of normal to a fasting plasma <b>glucose</b> under 100mg/dL.|$|E
25|$|The {{predominant}} {{cells of}} the liver are the hepatocytes, and GK is found exclusively in these cells. During digestion of a carbohydrate meal, when blood <b>glucose</b> is plentiful and insulin levels are high, hepatocytes remove <b>glucose</b> from the blood and store it as glycogen. After completion of digestion and absorption, the liver manufactures <b>glucose</b> from both non-glucose substrates (gluconeogenesis) and glycogen (glycogenolysis), and exports it into the blood, to maintain adequate blood <b>glucose</b> levels during fasting. Because GK activity rises rapidly as the <b>glucose</b> concentration rises, {{it serves as a}} central metabolic switch to shift hepatic carbohydrate metabolism between fed and fasting states. Phosphorylation of <b>glucose</b> to glucose-6-phosphate by GK facilitates storage of <b>glucose</b> as glycogen and disposal by glycolysis. The separate liver promoter allows glucokinase to be regulated differently in hepatocytes than in the neuroendocrine cells.|$|E
25|$|There {{is another}} protein {{involved}} in carbohydrate metabolism that {{is worthy of}} mention along with GLUT-4. The enzyme hexokinase phosphorylates a six-carbon sugar, most notably <b>glucose,</b> {{which is the first}} step in glycolysis. When <b>glucose</b> is transported into the cell it is phosphorylated by hexokinase. This phosphorylation keeps <b>glucose</b> from leaving the cell, and by changing the structure of <b>glucose</b> through phosphorylation, it decreases the concentration of <b>glucose</b> molecules, maintaining a gradient for more <b>glucose</b> to be transported into the cell. Hexokinase II transcription is increased in both red and white skeletal muscle upon treatment with AICAR. With chronic injections of AICAR, total protein content of hexokinase II increases in rat skeletal muscle.|$|E
25|$|Although other {{cells can}} use other fuels (most {{prominently}} fatty acids), neurons depend on <b>glucose</b> {{as a source}} of energy, unless the person is in ketosis. They do not require insulin to absorb <b>glucose,</b> unlike muscle and adipose tissue, and they have very small internal stores of glycogen. Glycogen stored in liver cells (unlike glycogen stored in muscle cells) can be converted to <b>glucose,</b> and released into the blood, when <b>glucose</b> from digestion is low or absent, and the glycerol backbone in triglycerides {{can also be used to}} produce blood <b>glucose.</b>|$|E
25|$|Approximately 4grams of <b>glucose</b> {{are present}} in the blood of humans at all times; in fasted individuals, blood <b>glucose</b> is {{maintained}} constant at this level at the expense of glycogen stores in the liver and skeletal muscle. Glycogen stores in skeletal muscle serve as a form of energy storage for the muscle itself; however, the breakdown of muscle glycogen impedes muscle <b>glucose</b> uptake, thereby increasing the amount of blood <b>glucose</b> available for use in other tissues. Liver glycogen stores serve as a store of <b>glucose</b> for use throughout the body, particularly the central nervous system. The human brain consumes approximately 60% of blood <b>glucose</b> in fasted, sedentary individuals.|$|E
25|$|The Minimed Paradigm series' RF link also {{supports}} a continuous blood <b>glucose</b> sensor {{known as the}} Paradigm REAL-Time Continuous <b>Glucose</b> Monitor that wirelessly provides an interstitial <b>glucose</b> value every 5 minutes on the pump screen. The Medtronic REAL-Time System {{was the first to}} link a continuous monitor with an insulin pump system. In the Minimed 530G with Enlite (in the US) or Paradigm Veo (in other countries), the pump can enter a low <b>glucose</b> suspend mode stopping all insulin delivery (bolus and basal insulin) if interstitial <b>glucose</b> values fall below the hypoglycemia threshold. In the Minimed 640G insulin pump series, low <b>glucose</b> suspend mode can also be entered based on predicted hypoglycemia.|$|E
25|$|<b>Glucose</b> 6-phosphate (sometimes {{called the}} Robison ester) is a <b>glucose</b> sugar {{phosphorylated}} on carbon 6. This is a compound {{that is very}} common in cells as the vast majority of <b>glucose</b> entering a cell will become phosphorylated in this way.|$|E
25|$|<b>Glucose</b> {{tolerance}} test: Oral <b>glucose</b> {{tolerance test}} (OGTT) {{used to assess}} the body's ability to metabolize <b>glucose.</b> Can be useful in detecting various disorders such as diabetes, an insulinoma, Cushing's Syndrome, hypoglycemia and polycystic ovary syndrome.|$|E
25|$|Since the <b>glucose</b> that {{normally}} enters the cells {{is unable to}} do so without insulin, it begins to build up in the blood where it can be seen as hyperglycemia or high blood <b>glucose</b> levels. The tubules of the kidneys are normally able to re-absorb <b>glucose,</b> but they are unable to handle and process the amount of <b>glucose</b> they are being presented with. At this point, which is called the renal threshold, the excess <b>glucose</b> spills into the urine (glycosuria), where it can be seen in urine <b>glucose</b> testing. It is the polyuria, or over-frequent urination, which causes polydipsia, or excessive water consumption, through an osmotic process. Even though there is an overabundance of <b>glucose,</b> the lack of insulin does not allow it to enter the cells. As a result, they are not able to receive nourishment from their normal <b>glucose</b> source. The body begins using fat for this purpose, causing weight loss; the process {{is similar to that of}} starvation.|$|E
25|$|Normal <b>glucose</b> {{homeostasis}} {{is controlled}} by three interrelated processes. These processes include gluconeogenesis (<b>glucose</b> production that occurs in the liver), uptake and utilization of <b>glucose</b> by the peripheral tissues of the body, and insulin secretion by the pancreatic beta islet cells. The presence of <b>glucose</b> in the bloodstream triggers the production and release of insulin from the pancreas' beta islet cells. The main function of insulin {{is to increase the}} rate of transport of <b>glucose</b> from the bloodstream into certain cells of the body, such as striated muscles, fibroblasts, and fat cells. It also is necessary for transport of amino acids, glycogen formation in the liver and skeletal muscles, triglyceride formation from <b>glucose,</b> nucleic acid synthesis, and protein synthesis.|$|E
25|$|Insulin is {{produced}} in the pancreas and the Brockmann body (in some fish), and released when any of several stimuli are detected. These stimuli include ingested protein and <b>glucose</b> in the blood produced from digested food. Carbohydrates can be polymers of simple sugars or the simple sugars themselves. If the carbohydrates include <b>glucose,</b> then that <b>glucose</b> will be absorbed into the bloodstream and blood <b>glucose</b> level will begin to rise. In target cells, insulin initiates a signal transduction, which {{has the effect of}} increasing <b>glucose</b> uptake and storage. Finally, insulin is degraded, terminating the response.|$|E
25|$|Evidence of {{impaired}} first-phase insulin release {{can be seen}} in the <b>glucose</b> tolerance test, {{demonstrated by}} a substantially elevated blood <b>glucose</b> level at 30 minutes after the ingestion of a <b>glucose</b> load (75 or 100 g of <b>glucose),</b> followed a slow drop over the next 100 minutes, to remain above 120mg/100 ml after two hours after the start of the test. In a normal person the blood <b>glucose</b> level is corrected (and may even be slightly over-corrected) by the end of the test.|$|E
25|$|When ample <b>glucose</b> is available, {{glycogen}} synthesis proceeds at {{the periphery}} of the hepatocytes until the cells are replete with glycogen. Excess <b>glucose</b> is then increasingly converted into triglycerides for export and storage in adipose tissue. Glucokinase activity in the cytoplasm rises and falls with available <b>glucose.</b>|$|E
25|$|The USDA food {{database}} {{reveals that}} many common fruits contain nearly {{equal amounts of}} the fructose and <b>glucose,</b> {{and they do not}} present problems for those individuals with fructose malabsorption. Some fruits with a greater ratio of fructose than <b>glucose</b> are apples, pears and watermelon, which contain {{more than twice as much}} fructose as <b>glucose.</b> Fructose levels in grapes varies depending on ripeness and variety, where unripe grapes contain more <b>glucose.</b>|$|E
25|$|The average {{ratio was}} 56% {{fructose}} to 44% <b>glucose,</b> but the ratios {{in the individual}} honeys ranged {{from a high of}} 64% fructose and 36% <b>glucose</b> (one type of flower honey; table 3 in reference) to a low of 50% fructose and 50% <b>glucose</b> (a different floral source). This NMR method was not able to quantify maltose, galactose, and the other minor sugars as compared to fructose and <b>glucose.</b>|$|E
25|$|In animals, {{this is a}} rate-controlling step of gluconeogenesis, {{the process}} by which cells {{synthesize}} <b>glucose</b> from metabolic precursors. The blood <b>glucose</b> level is maintained within well-defined limits in part due to precise regulation of PEPCK gene expression. To emphasize the importance of PEPCK in <b>glucose</b> homeostasis, over expression of this enzyme in mice results in symptoms of type II diabetes mellitus, by far {{the most common form of}} diabetes in humans. Due to the importance of blood <b>glucose</b> homeostasis, a number of hormones regulate a set of genes (including PEPCK) in the liver that modulate the rate of <b>glucose</b> synthesis.|$|E
25|$|After a meal {{has been}} digested and <b>glucose</b> levels begin to fall, insulin {{secretion}} is reduced, and glycogen synthesis stops. When {{it is needed}} for energy, glycogen is broken down and converted again to <b>glucose.</b> Glycogen phosphorylase is the primary enzyme of glycogen breakdown. For the next 8–12 hours, <b>glucose</b> derived from liver glycogen is {{the primary source of}} blood <b>glucose</b> used {{by the rest of the}} body for fuel.|$|E
25|$|Approximately 3 million cell {{clusters}} called pancreatic islets {{are present}} in the pancreas. Within these islets are four main types of cells which are involved in the regulation of blood <b>glucose</b> levels. Each type of cell secretes a different type of hormone: α alpha cells secrete glucagon (increase <b>glucose</b> in blood), β beta cells secrete insulin (decrease <b>glucose</b> in blood), δ delta cells secrete somatostatin (regulates/stops α and β cells) and PP cells, or γ (gamma) cells, secrete pancreatic polypeptide. These act to control blood <b>glucose</b> through secreting glucagon to increase the levels of <b>glucose,</b> and insulin to decrease it.|$|E
