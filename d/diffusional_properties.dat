40|$|Hydrogels possess several {{physical}} and chemical properties suitable for engineering cellular environments for biomedical applications. Despite recent advances in hydrogel systems for cell culture, it is still a significant challenge to independently control the mechanical and <b>diffusional</b> <b>properties</b> of hydrogels, both of which are well known to influence various cell behaviors when using hydrogels as 3 D cell culture systems. Controlling the crosslinking density of a hydrogel system to tune the mechanical properties inevitably affects their <b>diffusional</b> <b>properties,</b> as the crosslinking density and diffusion are often inversely correlated. In this study, a polymeric crosslinker is demonstrated that allows for the adjustment of the degree of substitution of reactive functional groups. By using this polymeric crosslinker, the rigidity of the resulting hydrogel is controlled in a wide range without changing the polymer concentration. Furthermore, their <b>diffusional</b> <b>properties,</b> as characterized by their swelling ratios, pore diameters, and drug release rates, are not significantly affected by the changes in the degree of substitution. 3 D cell studies using this hydrogel system successfully demonstrate the varying effects of mechanical properties on different cell types, whereas those in a conventional hydrogel system are more significantly influenced by changes in <b>diffusional</b> <b>properties...</b>|$|E

Previously, we demonstrated that a pre-Lipobead, consisting of phospholipids covalently attached to the surface of a hydrogel, could give rise to a Lipobead when incubated with liposomes because the attached phospholipids promote self-assembly of a phospholipid membrane on the pre-Lipobead. We now report the properties of that Lipobead membrane. The lateral diffusion coefficient of fluorescently labeled phosphatidylcholine analogs in the membrane was measured by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching and was found to decrease as the surface anchor density and hydrogel crosslinking density increased. Results from the quenching of phosphatidylcholine analogs suggest that the phospholipid membrane of the Lipobead was composed mostly of a semipermeable lipid bilayer. However, the <b>diffusional</b> barrier <b>properties</b> of the Lipobead membrane were demonstrated by the entrapment of 1. 5 – 3. 0 K dextran molecules in the hydrogel core after liposome fusion.

40|$|ABSTRACT Cervicovaginal mucus (CVM) {{can provide}} a barrier that precludes HIV and other sexually {{transmitted}} virions from reaching target cells in the vaginal epithelium, thereby preventing or reducing infections. However, the barrier prop-erties of CVM differ from woman to woman, and the causes of these variations are not yet well understood. Using high-resolution particle tracking of fluorescent HIV- 1 pseudoviruses, we found that neither pH nor Nugent scores nor total lac-tic acid levels correlated significantly with virus trapping in unmodified CVM from diverse donors. Surprisingly, HIV- 1 was generally trapped in CVM with relatively high concentrations of D-lactic acid and a Lactobacillus crispatus-dominant microbiota. In contrast, a substantial fraction of HIV- 1 virions diffused rapidly through CVM with low concentrations of D-lactic acid that had a Lactobacillus iners-dominant microbiota or significant amounts of Gardnerella vaginalis, a bacte-rium associated with bacterial vaginosis. Our results demonstrate that the vaginal microbiota, including specific species of Lactobacillus, can alter the <b>diffusional</b> barrier <b>properties</b> of CVM against HIV and likely other sexually transmitted viruses and that these microbiota-associated changes may account in part for the elevated risks of HIV acquisition linked to bacte-rial vaginosis or intermediate vaginal microbiota.

We proposed previously that imprinted genes can regulate nutrient supply by the placenta. Here, we tested the hypothesis that the insulin-like growth factor 2 gene (Igf 2) transcribed from the placental-specific promoter (P 0) regulates the development of the <b>diffusional</b> permeability <b>properties</b> of the mouse placenta. Using mice in which placental-specific Igf 2 had been deleted (P 0), we measured the transfer in vivo of three inert hydrophilic solutes of increasing size (14 C-mannitol, 51 CrEDTA, and 14 C-inulin). At embryonic day 19, placental and fetal weights in P 0 conceptuses were reduced to 66 % and 76 %, respectively, of wild type. In P 0 mutants, the permeability·surface area product for the tracers at this stage of development was 68 % of that of controls; this effect was independent of tracer size. Stereological analysis of histological sections revealed the surface area of the exchange barrier in the labyrinth of the mouse placenta to be reduced and thickness increased in P 0 fetuses compared to wild type. As a result, the average theoretical diffusing capacity in P 0 knockout placentas was dramatically reduced to 40 % of that of wild-type placentas. These data show that placental Igf 2 regulates the development of the diffusional exchange characteristics of the mouse placenta. This provides a mechanism for the role of imprinted genes in controlling placental nutrient supply and fetal growth.

The catalyst was coked using different coke precursors in the gas oil under accelerated conditions at temperatures of 400 to 450 °C to yield different deactivated catalysts containing 2 - 20 wt % C. Two cases were studied; crushed catalyst without diffusional resistance and extruded pellets with <b>diffusional</b> resistance. Physical <b>properties</b> and catalytic activities of the coked catalysts were measured using the thiophene sulfur removal in the gas oil. It is concluded that coking occurs by selective deactivation on hydrotreating catalyst and the experimental results of the catalyst activity under different operating conditions, obey a power law {{as a function of the}} coke cantent. In the pellet catalyst showed a lower rate of coking and deactivation in comparison to the catalyst without diffusional resistance. It is inferred that high level of coke content (higher than 12 wt % C) affects the tortusity factor of the catalyst,considerably.

40|$|Thesis (MSc (Pharmaceutics)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2013. In {{pharmaceutical}} sciences, topical {{delivery is}} a transport process {{of an active}} pharmaceutical ingredient (API) from a formulated dosage form to the target site of action. For most topical delivery systems, the skin surface, or the specific skin layers, such as the outermost layer of the stratum corneum, the lipids amid the corneocytes within the stratum corneum, the corneocytes themselves, the epidermis, dermis, Langerhans cells, Merckle cells or the appendageal structures can be the target delivery location. When an API is delivered to the skin, it has to firstly diffuse from the formulation {{in which it is}} applied, to the skin surface. From there the API may partition into the stratum corneum, permeate across the stratum corneum and partition into the viable epidermis, from where it may partition further into the dermis and permeate across the dermis into the bloodstream (Wiechers, 2008 : 1 - 3, 7). With respect to the barrier function of the skin, the intercellular spaces within the stratum corneum contain lipids and its main purpose is to operate as a barrier to water-loss and to provide an imperative diffusional barrier to the absorption of APIs. This resistance is comprised of a complex interaction of lipids that creates a hydrophilic and lipophilic penetration pathway. The fundamental aspect underlying the impermeability of the skin, therefore, is the lipophilic nature of the stratum corneum (Bouwstra et al., 2003 : 4; Franz & Lehman, 2000 : 25; Walker & Smith, 1996 : 296). A common approach for the promotion of poorly penetrating APIs in transdermal delivery is the incorporation of chemical penetration enhancers in delivery systems, in order to promote the partitioning of an API into the stratum corneum. These chemicals are also referred to as accelerants, promoters and absorption promoters. Penetration enhancers are added to topical formulations and usually also partition into the stratum corneum, where they temporarily and reversibly disrupt its fundamental <b>diffusional</b> barrier <b>properties,</b> hence facilitating the absorption of an API through the skin (Büyüktimkin et al., 1997 : 358 - 359; Sinha & Kaur, 2000 : 1131; Walker & Smith, 1996 : 296). The mechanisms for the enhancement of diffusion of the API should therefore increase the solubility and partitioning of the drug from the formulation into the skin. It should further increase the solubility of the API within the skin and promote its permeability and diffusion coefficient (Rajadhyaksha et al., 1997 : 489). Fatty acids are recognised to effectively enhance the penetration of transdermally delivered hydrophilic and lipophilic APIs. Many penetration enhancers contain saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbon chains, and a popular fatty acid that has been used in this regard is oleic acid (Williams & Barry, 2004 : 609 - 610). It is believed that fatty acids disrupt the lipid organisation of the intercellular lipids within the stratum corneum to cause fluidisation of these bilayers, making the stratum corneum more permeable to APIs. Excipients with polar (hydrophilic) head groups and long hydrophobic chains i. e. fatty acids, can penetrate into the intercellular lipids of the stratum corneum and disrupt these endogenous lipid components, thereby increasing diffusion of an API within the skin (Barry, 2006 : 9 - 10; Hadgraft & Finnin, 2006 : 367 - 368; Kanikkannan et al., 2006 : 18; Williams & Barry, 2004 : 610). Natural oils are widely used in topical formulations and were an obvious choice in this study. Oils are liquids at room temperature, whereas fats are in solid form. They are relatively easy to obtain from both plants and animals. The main constituents of fats and oils are triglycerides comprising of fatty acids and a glycerol. Oils control the evaporation of moisture from the skin, spread easily and evenly and are partly metabolised in the skin to release valuable fatty acids (Fang et al., 2004 : 170, 173; Lautenschläger, 2004 : 46; Mitsui, 1997 : 121 - 122). The focus of this study was not formulation per se, but included the formulation of avocado-, grapeseed-, emu-, crocodile, olive and coconut oil into semisolid emulgel- and two foam formulations. This was done in order to investigate the penetration enhancing properties of their fatty acid content on flurbiprofen which was chosen as the marker API. The emulgels containing the natural oils were compared to the same emulgel formulation containing liquid paraffin, and a hydrogel without the inclusion of an oil. Six natural oils were analysed by gas chromatography (GC) in order to quantify their fatty acid compositions, whilst also providing qualitative information by indicating the retention times of the materials with an alkyl chain composition (Mitsui, 1997 : 260). Data obtained with the GC indicated that olive- (76 %), avocado- (68 %), emu- (46 %) and crocodile oil (40 %) presented with high levels of oleic acid, also known as a mono-unsaturated fatty acid (MUFA). Lower levels of oleic acid were observed within grapeseed- (27 %) and coconut oil (8 %). The only oil demonstrating high levels of the poly-unsaturated fatty acid (PUFA), linoleic acid, was grapeseed oil (61 %), whereas the remainder of the oils showed levels below 24 %. Contrary, coconut oil seemed to have been the only oil high in saturated fatty acids (SFAs) and consisted of a lauric acid content of 52 % and medium levels of myristic acid (21 %). Average levels of palmitic acid (SFA) were found in crocodile- (21 %) and in emu oil (21 %), both of animal origin, whereas avocado-, grapeseed-, olive- and coconut oils from plants presented with levels below 15 %. Stearic acid was also present in levels below 10 % in all of these oils, with the oils of animal origin portraying the highest values. A method was developed and validated to determine the concentration of the marker flurbiprofen after diffusion from the formulations into the skin, as well as concentrations of the marker that diffused through the skin, by means of high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Franz cell membrane diffusion studies were conducted prior to the skin diffusion studies in order to verify the actual release of the marker from the semisolid formulations. Skin diffusion experiments were performed using dermatomed excised, human skin to which the six emulgel formulations, containing the natural oils, were applied. A comparative study was performed utilising liquid paraffin and a hydrogel, in order to compare the diffusion of the marker, flurbiprofen, into and through the skin. The two oil emulgel formulations that had indicated the best flux values were subsequently formulated into foam preparations in order to compare the penetration enhancement properties on flurbiprofen of these two oils in a foam preparation, to those in the equivalent emulgels. The data generated for all ten the formulations were compared, and the formulations that yielded the best results with regards to median flux values and the flurbiprofen concentrations within the stratum corneum-epidermis and epidermis-dermis, were identified. Application of the liquid paraffin emulgel (21. 29 μg/ml) depicted the highest average concentration of the diffused lipophilic flurbiprofen within the stratum corneum-epidermis, followed by the olive oil foam (21. 47 μg/ml), olive oil emulgel (17. 82 μg/ml) and grapeseed oil emulgel (17. 78 μg/ml). Very similar concentrations for the marker were demonstrated by the hydrogel (16. 73 μg/ml) and crocodile oil emulgel (14. 89 μg/ml), whereas a lower concentration was shown for coconut oil emulgel (7. 18 μg/ml). The remainder of the formulations yielded concentrations below 3 %, i. e. the avocado oil emulgel (2. 72 μg/ml), the coconut oil foam (1. 57 μg/ml) and finally the emu oil emulgel (1. 25 μg/ml). The penetration of the marker, flurbiprofen, being trapped within the skin seemed to have been enhanced more by the oleic acid (UFA) containing emulgels and foam, especially. This was followed by oils containing high linoleic acid values, which indicated that the more kinked shaped the fatty acids, the more difficult it became to insert themselves within the lipid structures of the stratum corneum, with a resulting accumulation of the marker (Fang et al., 2003 : 318 - 319). It therefore seemed that those oils that predominantly consisted of unsaturated fatty acids (UFAs) (grapeseed-, crocodile- and olive oils) seemed to have increased the concentration of the diffused marker more significantly than those oils containing an almost even combination of MUFAs and PUFAs (avocado oil), or those mainly consisting of SFAs (coconut oil). Average concentrations of the diffused flurbiprofen found in the epidermis-dermis region of the skin for all of the formulations demonstrated low concentrations, ranging between 0. 97 - 5. 39 μg/ml, {{with the exception of the}} emu oil emulgel that presented with a higher concentration of 16. 15 μg/ml. The reason for the high accumulation of the marker might have been as a result of epidermal proliferation, with subsequent accumulation of the marker within the epidermis-dermis due to high oleic- and linoleic acid values, as well as small amounts of palmitoleic acid present within this oil (Katsuta et al., 2005 : 1011). The resistance of the epidermis-dermis region to the general permeation of flurbiprofen might have been caused by its lipophilic nature, resulting in a reduced solubility within the hydrophilic environment of this region (Hadgraft, 1999 : 5). Median results from the skin diffusion studies demonstrated that the hydrogel (23. 79 μg/cm 2. h) had the highest flux, followed by the olive oil- (17. 99 μg/cm 2. h), liquid paraffin- (15. 70 μg/cm 2. h), coconut oil- (13. 16 μg/cm 2. h), grapeseed oil- (11. 85 μg/cm 2. h), avocado oil- (8. 31 μg/cm 2. h), crocodile oil- (6. 68 μg/cm 2. h) and emu oil emulgels (4. 41 μg/cm 2. h). The fact that the hydrogel presented a higher flux value for the marker could have been as a result of its high water content that had caused hydration of the skin. Hydration opens up the dense lipid structures inside of the stratum corneum, due to swelling of the corneocytes, with a subsequent increase in the marker‘s flux (Benson, 2005 : 28; Ranade & Hollinger, 2004 : 213). The high flux value of flurbiprofen with the liquid paraffin emulgel might also have resulted from the fact that it occluded the skin, which increased the hydration of the stratum corneum, with a subsequent increase in the flux (Mitsui, 1997 : 124; Thomas & Finnin, 2004 : 699). Results from the skin diffusion studies could be explained by the fact that the fatty acids differ in their hydrocarbon chain by (1) the length of the chain, and (2) the position- and number of the double bonds (Babu et al., 2006 : 144). It is suggested that fatty acids with hydrocarbon (lipophilic) chains between C 12 to C 14 (also present within coconut oil) have an optimal balance of the partition coefficient and its affinity for the skin (Ogiso & Shintani, 1990 : 1067). It appears as though the branched UFAs, especially oleic acid, present in high quantities in olive oil, were more powerful enhancers of the diffusion of the marker, flurbiprofen (Chi et al., 1995 : 270). Foam formulations were manufactured with the olive- and coconut oil emulgels that had demonstrated the best median flux values of flurbiprofen from the natural oil emulgel formulations. These formulated foams, however, did not significantly increased flux values for flurbiprofen through the skin, but only achieved values of 5. 56 μg/cm 2. h for the olive oil foam and 4. 36 μg/cm 2. h for the coconut oil foam formulations. The low flux values could have been attributed to the nature of the formulation itself, which was filled with trapped air that could have resulted in the formulation not making optimal direct contact with the available skin surface. Throughout this study, it became evident that olive oil, predominantly consisting of oleic acid (UFA), was most effective in enhancing the flux of the lipophilic marker, flurbiprofen, through the skin, closely followed by coconut oil consisting of SFAs, with lauric- and myristic acid as its main constituents. Better enhancement effects were observed with those oils containing high amounts of oleic acid (MUFA), than oils consisting of almost equal amounts of both PUFAs and MUFAs (avocado-, emu- and crocodile oil), or oils mainly consisting of PUFAs (grapeseed oil) as its main components, but their effect was not more significant than the oil containing SFAs (coconut oil) as its key components.

Drug-induced F-actin depolymerization disrupted both the apicobasal-like polarity and the diffusion barriers within the syncytial PM. These events correlated with perturbations in the spatial pattern of dorsoventral Toll signaling. We propose that epithelial-like properties and an intact F-actin network compartmentalize the PM and shape morphogen gradients in the syncytial embryo...|$|E
40|$|Signaling {{from the}} {{epidermal}} growth factor receptor (EGFR) via phosphorylation on its C-terminal tyrosine residues requires self-association, which depends on the <b>diffusional</b> <b>properties</b> of the receptor and its density in the plasma membrane. Dimerization is a key event for EGFR activation, but the role of higher order clustering is unknown. We employed single particle tracking to relate the mobility and aggregation of EGFR to its signaling activity. EGFR mobility alternates between short-lived free, confined and immobile states. In the immobile state, EGFR tends to aggregate in clathrin-coated pits, which is further enhanced in a phosphorylation-dependent manner and does not require ligand binding. EGFR phosphorylation is further amplified by cross-phosphorylation in clathrin-coated pits. Because phosphorylated receptors can escape from the pits, local gradients of signaling active EGFR are formed. These results show that amplification of EGFR phosphorylation by receptor clustering in clathrin-coated pits supports signal activation at the plasma membrane...|$|E
40|$|A {{differential}} dialysis flask, {{constructed with}} three chambers and two membranes of different porosity, {{was used to}} effect the separation and concentration of enterotoxin B produced extracellularly by a culture of Staphylococcus aureus. Variables were examined that affected the diffusion of glucose, as measured by half-equilibration time and permeability coefficient; the relative chamber volume, type of membrane, membrane masking, and mixing all exerted a substantial influence on diffusion rates. A number of membrane filters were tested for usefulness; one type, made with vinylidene fluoride, had desirable physical and <b>diffusional</b> <b>properties,</b> but neither it nor others consistently withheld the bacteria {{for more than a}} marginally useful period of about 50 hr. In ordinary two-chambered dialysis culture, the amount of enterotoxin reached 10 times that in control culture; in differential, three-chambered dialysis culture the comparable factor of increase was about 7, with about two-thirds of this amount being separated from cells in the product chamber of the flask...|$|E
40|$|We used single-molecule {{fluorescence}} microscopy to study self-diffusion of a feedstock-like probe molecule with nanometer accuracy in the macropores of a micrometer-sized, real-life {{fluid catalytic cracking}} (FCC) particle. Movies of single fluorescent molecules allowed their movement through the pore network to be reconstructed. The observed tracks were classified into three different states by machine learning and all found to be distributed homogeneously over the particle. Most probe molecules (88 %) were immobile, with the molecule most likely being physisorbed or trapped; the remainder was either mobile (8 %), with the molecule moving inside the macropores, or showed hybrid behavior (4 %). Mobile tracks had an average diffusion coefficient of D = 8 × 10 – 14 ± 1 × 10 – 13 m 2 s– 1, with the standard deviation thought {{to be related to}} the large range of pore sizes found in FCC particles. The developed methodology can be used to evaluate, quantify and map heterogeneities in <b>diffusional</b> <b>properties</b> within complex hierarchically porous materials. status: accepte...|$|E
40|$|AbstractFour {{different}} tandem EGFPs {{were constructed}} to elucidate the nuclear microenvironment by quantifying its <b>diffusional</b> <b>properties</b> in both aqueous solution and the nuclei of living cells. Diffusion of tandem EGFP {{was dependent on}} the length of the protein as a rod-like molecule or molecular ruler in solution. On the other hand, we found two kinds of mobility, fast diffusional mobility and much slower diffusional mobility depending on cellular compartments in living cells. Diffusion in the cytoplasm and the nucleoplasm was mainly measured as fast diffusional mobility. In contrast, diffusion in the nucleolus was complex and mainly much slower diffusional mobility, although both the fast and the slow diffusional mobilities were dependent on the protein length. Interestingly, we found that diffusion in the nucleolus was clearly changed by energy depletion, even though the diffusion in the cytoplasm and the nucleoplasm was not changed. Our results suggest that the nucleolar microenvironment is sensitive to energy depletion and very different from the nucleoplasm...|$|E
40|$|ZSM- 5 zeolite nanocrystals {{having a}} {{rectangular}} morphology (French fries-like) and a size comprised between 50 and 100 nm were prepared using cheap {{sugar cane bagasse}} as a sacrificial template. Two sugar cane biomass types, un-treated and acid hydrolyzed bagasse, were used. A relationship has been established between the chemical composition of the sacrificial vegetal and the morphology of grown zeolite crystals. Aligned zeolite nanocrystals were allowed to grow on non hydrolyzed sugar cane substrate, {{using a combination of}} supramolecular templating and conventional self-assembly of template cations and silica species. The latter material allowed enhanced <b>diffusional</b> <b>properties</b> in comparison with purely microporous zeolite, as well as ZSM- 5 crystals grown on hydrolyzed bagasse. Their catalytic behavior in n-hexane cracking reaction led to a higher selectivity toward light olefins. The double novelty consists in the manufacture of hierarchical zeolite microspheres (diameter about 1 μm) formed by the self-aggregation of rectangular subunits. In addition, a renewable vegetal source {{can be used as a}} supramolecular template in replacement of expensive polymers...|$|E
40|$|The {{oxidation}} {{properties of}} niobium were {{studied in the}} temperature ange 450 ~ 176 at oxygen pressures 1 - 760 Torr. Particular {{emphasis was placed on}} correlating the morphology of the reaction products with the oxidation kinetics. During the initial, approximately parabolic oxidation period the scale appears compact, and at the transition from parabolic to l inear kinetics the scale blisters and cracks. Scale formed during l inear oxidation grows in a series of crude layers. From the relationships determined between the rate of oxidation and the thickness of the oxide layers, it is deduced that the rate of oxidation is controlled at all times by the <b>diffusional</b> <b>properties</b> of the oxide layer in contact,with the metal phase. The sensitivity of the rate of oxi-dation to oxygen pressure is ascribed to the pressure sensitivity of the under-lying parabolic rate constant of formation of the niobium pentoxide, {{and to a lesser extent}} to changes in the width of the oxide layers with the rate of their formation. The inversion in the temperature coefficient of the oxidatio...|$|E
40|$|A novel {{differential}} electrochemical {{mass spectrometry}} (DEMS) cell {{has been developed}} to study gas diffusion electrodes (GDEs) used in fuel cells under operating conditions. In this way, catalytic and diffusion properties of the electrodes can be evaluated at the same time. Moreover, DEMS, allows the detection of volatile and gaseous products and intermediates generated in the electrochemical reactions with good sensitivity. In this way, CO 2 conversion efficiencies are evaluated during alcohol oxidation reaction. In the present communication, the electrochemical behaviour towards hydrogen evolution and CO and alcohol electrooxidation at different platinum-based catalysts has been studied using the new DEMS cell configuration. The relative yields of CO 2 and by-side products during methanol oxidation have been evaluated to determine the CO 2 conversion efficiency. In addition, the <b>diffusional</b> <b>properties</b> of diverse GDEs have been considered.

40|$|AbstractThe {{possibility}} of predicting the overall {{shape of a}} macromolecule in solution from its <b>diffusional</b> <b>properties</b> has gained increasing importance in the structural genomic era. Here we explore and quantify the influence that unstructured and flexible regions have on the motions of a globular protein, a situation that can occur from the presence of such regions in the natural sequence or from additional tags. I 27, an immunoglobulin-like module from the muscle protein titin, whose structure and properties are well characterized, was selected for our studies. The backbone dynamics and the overall tumbling of three different constructs of I 27 were investigated using 15 N NMR relaxation collected at two 15 N frequencies (60. 8 and 81. 1 MHz) and fluorescence depolarization spectroscopy after labeling of a reactive cysteine with an extrinsic fluorophore. Our data show {{that the presence of}} disordered tags clearly exerts a frictional drag that increases with the length of the tags, thus affecting the module tumbling in solution. We discuss the use and the limitations of current approaches to hydrodynamic calculations, especially when having to take into account local flexibility...|$|E
30|$|We have {{investigated}} the MSF {{in a number of}} earlier publications and reported their microstructural [37] and <b>diffusional</b> <b>properties</b> [38, 40]. In this work, part of these results will be presented as a reference to delineate effects of other variables. The growth starts with a thin amorphous layer at the interface of the two-phase mixture within 2  days of induction followed by slow growth of a white matrix of fibers attached to the thin amorphous layer in the water phase. Regular particulates also emerge along the fibers in the water bulk and precipitate {{at the bottom of the}} beaker (see Figure  1). We noticed that 10 to 14  days is a typical period for fiber growth over which the yield and pore order of fibers increase markedly with time. The long time is due to quiescent conditions where species has to interdiffuse slowly in absence of any bulk movement. TBOS species diffuse from the silica layer into the water phase; surfactant micelles also diffuse in the water bulk to interact with silica species in the interfacial region. Water and alcohol (resulting from the hydrolysis) diffuse as well and evaporate at the interface. This was reported to influence the growth in this method [42].|$|E
