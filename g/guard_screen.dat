50|$|The basic theory {{behind the}} flex offense {{is that all}} players are interchangeable—no player has a {{traditional}} role. The point guard advances the ball up the court to start the offense, while other players set screens to create openings. Typically, the point guard sets the offense {{on the same side}} as a low-post player positioned at the right block. The point guard passes opposite to a high-post {{at the top of the}} key while a wing player cuts off a screen by the low post player towards the ball to receive a pass from the high post player. The point <b>guard</b> <b>screens</b> down to the low post player who moves to the top of the key to receive a pass from the high post player. The same cut occurs on the other side of the ball and the offense begins its continuous cycle.|$|R

During flight operations on 3 January, a Hellcat crashed while taking off, and the destroyer-seaplane tender sped to the rescue. The ship's whaleboat, soon in the water, rescued the soaked pilot, and William B. Preston subsequently returned the aviator to his carrier via highline transfer.|$|R
50|$|While Caxaro himself {{synthetically}} states his concepts, {{especially as}} regards the unpleasantness of illusion, he prefers to express himself under “deceptive” clothing.

50|$|The Confederates {{continued}} to attack Steele's column along their march. After {{a series of}} skirmishes or small battles, starting with a battle between Steele's and Marmaduke's forces at Okolona on April 3, and the Battle of Elkin's Ferry on April 3-4, 1864. On April 9, Thayer's force met up with Steele's, but brought almost no food along with them. Steele decided he could not remain in the barren area around Elkin's Ferry and ordered supplies {{to be sent to}} him at Camden. After the Battle of Prairie D'Ane, at which the Union column forced the Confederates to withdraw toward Washington, Arkansas, and the Union rear <b>guard</b> <b>screened</b> the Union move, Steele turned his force to the east toward Camden. Camden had been evacuated by the Confederates so their entire force in Arkansas could pursue Steele's men. Steele marched into the Confederate fortifications at Camden having been opposed only in a stiff two-hour fight by Marmaduke's cavalry which had caught up with the Union force but was unable to stop it from entering Camden on the night of April 15. Finding few supplies at Camden, Steele had to send out foraging parties which the Confederates attacked with disastrous results for the Union foraging parties at the Battle of Poison Spring and the Battle of Marks' Mill.|$|R

5000|$|The play {{begins with}} a defender {{guarding}} a ballhandler. The ballhandler moves toward a teammate, who sets a [...] "screen" [...] (or [...] "pick") by {{standing in the way}} of the defender, who is separated from the moving ballhandler. The defender is forced to choose between guarding the ballhandler or the screener. If the defender tries to guard the ballhandler, then the screener can move toward the basket (as the man marking the screener may try to trap or mark the ballhandler, giving the screener space) sometimes by a foot pivot ("roll"), and is now open for a pass. If the defender chooses instead to <b>guard</b> the <b>screening</b> teammate, then the ballhandler has an open shot. Alternatively, the ballhandler may pass the ball to an open teammate. A well-executed pick and roll is the result of teamwork, but many players fail by executing the play too quickly; they must ignore the defense and control their own speed.|$|R
