5|$|In endometrioid adenocarcinoma, {{the cancer}} cells grow in {{patterns}} reminiscent of normal <b>endometrium,</b> with many new glands formed from columnar epithelium with some abnormal nuclei. Low-grade endometrioid adenocarcinomas have well differentiated cells, have not invaded the myometrium, and are seen alongside endometrial hyperplasia. The tumor's glands form very close together, without the stromal tissue that normally separates them. Higher-grade endometrioid adenocarcinomas have less well-differentiated cells, have more solid sheets of tumor cells no longer organized into glands, and {{are associated with}} an atrophied <b>endometrium.</b> There are several subtypes of endometrioid adenocarcinoma with similar prognoses, including villoglandular, secretory, and ciliated cell variants. There is also a subtype characterized by squamous differentiation. Some endometrioid adenocarcinomas have foci of mucinous carcinoma.|$|E
5|$|The proliferative {{phase is}} {{the second phase of}} the uterine cycle when {{estrogen}} causes the lining of the uterus to grow, or proliferate, during this time. As they mature, the ovarian follicles secrete increasing amounts of estradiol, and estrogen. The estrogens initiate the formation of a new layer of <b>endometrium</b> in the uterus, histologically identified as the proliferative <b>endometrium.</b> The estrogen also stimulates crypts in the cervix to produce fertile cervical mucus, which may be noticed by women practicing fertility awareness.|$|E
5|$|Fertilization by a spermatozoon, when it occurs, {{usually takes}} place in the ampulla, the widest section of the fallopian tubes. A fertilized egg {{immediately}} begins the process of embryogenesis, or development. The developing embryo takes about three days to reach the uterus and another three days to implant into the <b>endometrium.</b> It has usually reached the blastocyst stage at the time of implantation.|$|E
5|$|The vast {{majority}} of endometrial cancers are carcinomas (usually adenocarcinomas), meaning that they originate from the single layer of epithelial cells that line the <b>endometrium</b> and form the endometrial glands. There are many microscopic subtypes of endometrial carcinoma, but they are broadly organized into two categories, Type I and Type II, based on clinical features and pathogenesis. The two subtypes are genetically distinct.|$|E
5|$|Dilation and {{curettage}} or an {{endometrial biopsy}} {{are used to}} obtain a tissue sample for histological examination. Endometrial biopsy is the less invasive option, {{but it may not}} give conclusive results every time. Hysteroscopy only shows the gross anatomy of the <b>endometrium,</b> which is often not indicative of cancer, and is therefore not used, unless in conjunction with a biopsy. Hysteroscopy can be used to confirm a diagnosis of cancer. New evidence shows that D has a higher false negative rate than endometrial biopsy.|$|E
5|$|Endometrial {{cancer is}} a cancer that arises from the <b>endometrium</b> (the lining of the uterus or womb). It {{is the result of}} the {{abnormal}} growth of cells that have the ability to invade or spread to other parts of the body. The first sign is most often vaginal bleeding not associated with a menstrual period. Other symptoms include pain with urination, pain during sexual intercourse, or pelvic pain. Endometrial cancer occurs most commonly after menopause.|$|E
5|$|The {{secretory}} {{phase is}} {{the final phase of}} the uterine cycle and it corresponds to the luteal phase of the ovarian cycle. During the secretory phase, the corpus luteum produces progesterone, which plays a vital role in making the <b>endometrium</b> receptive to implantation of the blastocyst and supportive of the early pregnancy, by increasing blood flow and uterine secretions and reducing the contractility of the smooth muscle in the uterus; it also has the side effect of raising the woman's basal body temperature.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to endometrial carcinomas, the uncommon endometrial stromal sarcomas are cancers that {{originate in the}} non-glandular connective tissue of the <b>endometrium.</b> They are generally non-aggressive and, if they recur, can take decades. Metastases to the lungs and pelvic or peritoneal cavities are the most frequent. They typically have estrogen and/or progesterone receptors. The prognosis for low-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma is good, with 60–90% five-year survival. High-grade undifferentiated endometrial sarcoma (HGUS) has a worse prognosis, with high rates of recurrence and 25% five-year survival. HGUS prognosis is dictated by {{whether or not the}} cancer has invaded the arteries and veins. Without vascular invasion, the five-year survival is 83%; it drops to 17% when vascular invasion is observed. Stage I ESS has the best prognosis, with five-year survival of 98% and ten-year survival of 89%. ESS makes up 0.2% of uterine cancers.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{transcriptional}} regulation of EFS, but several transcriptional regulators for EFS have been proposed based on consensus binding sites in its promoter region for ATF (Activating transcription factor), NF-κβ, NF-κβ1, GATA-3, C/EBPα (CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha), glucocorticoid receptors α and β, and p53. Expression of isoforms 1 and 2 has been detected in multiple tissues, with maximal expression in the placenta, and the embryonal central nervous system, heart, testes and lungs. Although its expression has been reported as lower in thymus and lymphocytes, functional studies of EFS to date have best defined it as important for immune system function. One screen for implantation-related genes regulated by progesterone found that EFS was downregulated by 17β-estradiol and progesterone in explants of late proliferative phase <b>endometrium.</b>|$|E
5|$|Many {{mammalian}} serpins {{have been}} identified that share no obvious orthology with a human serpin counterpart. Examples include numerous rodent serpins (particularly some of the murine intracellular serpins) {{as well as the}} uterine serpins. The term uterine serpin refers to members of the serpin A clade that are encoded by the SERPINA14 gene. Uterine serpins are produced by the <b>endometrium</b> of a restricted group of mammals in the Laurasiatheria clade under the influence of progesterone or estrogen. They are probably not functional proteinase inhibitors and may function during pregnancy to inhibit maternal immune responses against the conceptus or to participate in transplacental transport.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the risk}} factors for endometrial cancer involve high levels of estrogens. An {{estimated}} 40% of cases {{are thought to be}} related to obesity. In obesity, the excess of adipose tissue increases conversion of androstenedione into estrone, an estrogen. Higher levels of estrone in the blood causes less or no ovulation and exposes the <b>endometrium</b> to continuously high levels of estrogens. Obesity also causes less estrogen to be removed from the blood. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), which also causes irregular or no ovulation, is associated with higher rates of endometrial cancer for the same reasons as obesity. Specifically, obesity, typeII diabetes, and insulin resistance are risk factors for TypeI endometrial cancer. Obesity increases the risk for endometrial cancer by 300–400%.|$|E
5|$|Serous {{carcinoma}} is a Type II endometrial tumor {{that makes}} up 5–10% of diagnosed endometrial cancer and is common in postmenopausal women with atrophied <b>endometrium</b> and black women. Serous endometrial carcinoma is aggressive and often invades the myometrium and metastasizes within the peritoneum (seen as omental caking) or the lymphatic system. Histologically, it appears with many atypical nuclei, papillary structures, and, in contrast to endometrioid adenocarcinomas, rounded cells instead of columnar cells. Roughly 30% of endometrial serous carcinomas also have psammoma bodies. Serous carcinomas spread differently than most other endometrial cancers; they can spread outside the uterus without invading the myometrium.|$|E
25|$|Some sources {{recommend}} endometrial ultrasounds {{every two}} years. Testosterone usually causes atrophy of the <b>endometrium.</b> Any transgender {{man with an}} <b>endometrium</b> that is not thinned on ultrasound should have a biopsy to evaluate for endometrial cancer and possibly use progesterone to cause sloughing of the <b>endometrium.</b> Vaginal bleeding from progesterone may be emotionally uncomfortable for a trans man, but is medically preferable to developing endometrial cancer.|$|E
25|$|In {{anovulatory}} cycles using progestogen-only contraceptives, the <b>endometrium</b> is {{thin and}} atrophic. If the <b>endometrium</b> was also thin and atrophic during an ovulatory cycle, this could theoretically interfere with implantation of a blastocyst (embryo).|$|E
25|$|Estrogen stimulates {{growth and}} vascularity of the <b>endometrium,</b> {{the lining of}} the uterus.|$|E
25|$|Fluctuations of {{hormone levels}} {{can result in}} changes of {{adequacy}} of blood supply to parts of the <b>endometrium.</b>|$|E
25|$|Estrogen {{promotes}} endometrial cell {{growth and}} in postmenopausal women with an intact uterus, estrogen monotherapy results in continued endometrial development without the physiological secretory changes normally {{brought on by}} progesterone. This action is {{associated with an increased}} incidence of endometrial hyperplasia and carcinoma. Additional protection with progestogens is therefore important in patients with an intact uterus who receive estrogen replacement therapy. Dydrogesterone counters the proliferative effect of estrogens on the <b>endometrium</b> and ensures the transition to a secretory pattern and cyclical shedding of the <b>endometrium</b> in serial HRT regimes. Dydrogesterone effectively protects against the ontogenesis of endometrial hyperplasia. Unlike androgenic progestogens, dydrogesterone does not reverse the benefits brought on by 17β-oestradiol on lipid profiles and carbohydrate metabolism. In a continuous, combined HRT regimen, dydrogesterone retards the proliferation of the <b>endometrium</b> so that it remains atrophic or inactive.|$|E
25|$|Dydrogesterone {{has also}} been {{registered}} as hormone replacement therapy (HRT) to counter-check {{the negative effects of}} unopposed estrogen on the <b>endometrium</b> in women with an intact uterus.|$|E
25|$|The ERα {{is found}} in <b>endometrium,</b> breast cancer cells, ovarian stromal cells, and the hypothalamus. In males, ERα protein {{is found in}} the {{epithelium}} of the efferent ducts.|$|E
25|$|During a woman's menstrual cycle, the <b>endometrium</b> thickens in {{preparation}} for potential pregnancy. After ovulation, if the ovum is not fertilized {{and there is no}} pregnancy, the built-up uterine tissue is not needed and thus shed.|$|E
25|$|No {{specific}} {{hormonal signal}} for menarche is known; menarche as a discrete event {{is thought to}} be the relatively chance result of the gradual thickening of the <b>endometrium</b> induced by rising but fluctuating pubertal estrogen.|$|E
25|$|In normal endometrial tissue, {{there is}} no H19 {{expression}}; however, in endometrial cancer, H19 is expressed. The expression level of H19 RNA in the epithelial cells of the <b>endometrium</b> increases as tissue differentiation is lost in endometrial cancer.|$|E
25|$|The <b>endometrium,</b> {{the inner}} {{lining of the}} uterus, is the only adult tissue to undergo rapid cyclic {{shedding}} and regeneration without scarring; shedding and restoring roughly inside a 7-day window on a monthly basis. All other adult tissues, upon rapid shedding or injury, can scar.|$|E
25|$|Rising {{levels of}} {{estradiol}} produce the characteristic estrogenic body changes of female puberty: growth spurt, acceleration of bone maturation and closure, breast growth, increased fat composition, {{growth of the}} uterus, increased thickness of the <b>endometrium</b> and the vaginal mucosa, and widening of the lower pelvis.|$|E
25|$|Secondary {{amenorrhea}} is not {{a specific}} disease, but is instead a symptom. Dydrogesterone {{has been found to}} adequately induce bleeding within a sufficiently estrogen-primed <b>endometrium.</b> When estradiol levels are found to be low, dydrogesterone treatment is more effective when supplemented with estrogens.|$|E
25|$|The <b>endometrium</b> is not {{directly}} sampled with the device used to sample the ectocervix. Cells may exfoliate onto the cervix and be collected from there, so as with endocervical cells, abnormal cells can be recognised if present but the Pap Test {{should not be used}} as a screening tool for endometrial malignancy.|$|E
25|$|Dydrogesterone is characterised by progestational and PR-mediated antiestrogenic activity. This is {{demonstrated}} by its ability to induce a secretory transformation in the <b>endometrium</b> of immature or ovariectomised animals {{after they have been}} primed with estrogens (cf. the Clauberg test). The oral progestogenic potency of dydrogesterone is 20 times higher than that of progesterone.|$|E
25|$|The primary {{mechanism}} of action of progesterone receptor modulator emergency contraceptive pills like low-dose and mid-dose mifepristone and ulipristal acetate is to prevent fertilization by inhibition or delay of ovulation. One clinical study found that post-ovulatory administration of ulipristal acetate altered the <b>endometrium,</b> but whether the changes would inhibit implantation is unknown.|$|E
25|$|Like all {{combined}} hormonal contraceptives, Ortho Evra / Evra works {{primarily by}} preventing ovulation. A secondary {{mechanism of action}} is inhibition of sperm penetration by changes in the cervical mucus. Hormonal contraceptives also have effects on the <b>endometrium</b> that theoretically could affect implantation; however, no scientific evidence indicates that prevention of implantation actually results from their use.|$|E
25|$|Most of the {{research}} into immunity that inhibits gamete outcome has focused on human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). hCG is not necessary for fertilization, but is secreted by embryos shortly thereafter. Therefore, immunity against hCG does not prevent fertilization. However, {{it was found that}} anti-hCG antibodies prevent marmoset embryos from implanting in the <b>endometrium</b> of their mother's uterus.|$|E
25|$|Estrogen was {{originally}} included in oral contraceptives for better cycle control (to stabilize the <b>endometrium</b> and thereby {{reduce the incidence}} of breakthrough bleeding), but was also found to inhibit follicular development and help prevent ovulation. Estrogen negative feedback on the anterior pituitary greatly decreases the release of FSH, which inhibits follicular development and helps prevent ovulation.|$|E
25|$|A {{miscarriage}} may {{be confirmed}} by an obstetric ultrasound and by {{the examination of the}} passed tissue. When looking for microscopic pathologic symptoms, one looks for the products of conception. Microscopically, these include villi, trophoblast, fetal parts, and background gestational changes in the <b>endometrium.</b> When chromosomal abnormalities are found in more than one miscarriage, genetic testing of both parents may be done.|$|E
25|$|In decidual {{cells and}} in {{lymphocytes}} the distal promoter and thus prolactin expression is stimulated by cAMP. Responsivness to cAMP is mediated by an imperfect cAMP–responsive element and two CAAT/enhancer binding proteins (C/EBP). Progesterone upregulates prolactin synthesis in the <b>endometrium</b> and decreases it in myometrium and breast glandular tissue. Breast and other tissues may express the Pit-1 promoter {{in addition to}} the distal promoter.|$|E
25|$|Tamoxifen is a SERM. Even {{though it}} is an {{antagonist}} in breast tissue it acts as partial agonist on the <b>endometrium</b> and {{has been linked to}} endometrial cancer in some women. Therefore, endometrial changes, including cancer, are among tamoxifen's side effects. With time, risk of endometrial cancer may be doubled to quadrupled, which is a reason tamoxifen is typically only used for 5 years.|$|E
25|$|Insufficient {{evidence}} exists on whether {{changes in the}} <b>endometrium</b> could actually prevent implantation. The primary mechanisms of action are so effective {{that the possibility of}} fertilization during combined hormonal contraceptive use is very small. Since pregnancy occurs despite endometrial changes when the primary mechanisms of action fail, endometrial changes are unlikely to play a significant role, if any, in the observed effectiveness of combined hormonal contraceptives.|$|E
25|$|In the female, {{estradiol}} acts as {{a growth}} hormone for tissue of the reproductive organs, supporting {{the lining of the}} vagina, the cervical glands, the <b>endometrium,</b> and the lining of the fallopian tubes. It enhances growth of the myometrium. Estradiol appears necessary to maintain oocytes in the ovary. During the menstrual cycle, estradiol produced by the growing follicles triggers, via a positive feedback system, the hypothalamic-pituitary events that lead to the luteinizing hormone surge, inducing ovulation. In the luteal phase, estradiol, in conjunction with progesterone, prepares the <b>endometrium</b> for implantation. During pregnancy, estradiol increases due to placental production. The effect of estradiol, together with estrone and estriol, in pregnancy is less clear. They may promote uterine blood flow, myometrial growth, stimulate breast growth and at term, promote cervical softening and expression of myometrial oxytocin receptors. In baboons, blocking of estrogen production leads to pregnancy loss, suggesting estradiol has a role in the maintenance of pregnancy. Research is investigating the role of estrogens in the process of initiation of labor. Actions of estradiol are required before the exposure of progesterone in the luteal phase.|$|E
