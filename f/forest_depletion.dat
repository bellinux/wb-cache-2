The lack {{of information about the}} specific agents and forces of <b>forest</b> <b>depletion</b> is worrying. This is due to the inter-generational and intra-generational equity notions that affect mankind. As such, there is the need to maintain such resources on a non-declining value basis so as to maintain human welfare over time. Thus, the objective {{of this study is to}} empirically examine the determinants of <b>forest</b> <b>depletion</b> in Ghana over the 1970 - 2012 period in Ghana. This study employs multiple regression concepts to examine the effects of the determinants on <b>forest</b> <b>depletion.</b> The findings of the study indicate that gold extraction for export, population growth and logging increase the rate of <b>forest</b> <b>depletion</b> for the study period. More significantly, population growth reflected in settlement expansion, agriculture purposes, increased use of fuel wood, etc have greater effect on forest loss in Ghana. This suggests that, protection of the forest is necessary and sufficient condition for economic growth.

The data is taken from the Adjusted Net Savings data of World Bank. Our panel consists of 213 countries and spans the period between 1970 and 2008. To investigate the causal effect of economic growth on nature we employ two strategies; fixed-effects and fixed-effects instrumental-variables (IV) regressions. Cross-country analysis reveals that there is a positive relationship between income and pressure on nature. However, the relationship is not linear across countries; the effect is much stronger in middle-income countries than in low and high-income countries. Our results are robust to the inclusion of various covariates and moreover they do not support the Environmental Kuznets Curve hypothesis which foresees a reduction in environmental degradation once a certain level of development is reached. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we attempt to}} isolate {{spatially}} those factors responsible for forest degradation in Brunei Darussalam. While human activities {{are one of the}} deforestation forces, the degradation of forest far from development corridors may implicate extra-human factors in its explanation. In the absence of apparent sources of pollution, mean temperature rise is a good candidate factor as heat stress is capable of reducing photosynthesis, which can manifest itself in a drop in canopy density. Considering that leaves are the most active scattering kernels of electromagnetic waves within tree canopies, especially in the C-band (Î»= 5. 3 cm), one can expect that the shuttle radar topography mission elevation data product (SRTM) developed for that band should exhibit a variable bias over forest depending on its density. This relationship, e. g., vegetation density versus elevation bias, is used to measure <b>forest</b> <b>depletion.</b> Based on data from a forest map, SRTM and a reference DTM we calculated a typical bias for seven forest types. A linear relationship was established between elevation bias and <b>forest</b> <b>depletion</b> level. The typical bias means zero depletion, and bias equal to zero means 100 % depletion. A map of <b>forest</b> <b>depletion</b> was developed using that relationship. By excluding pixels most likely to be affected by human activities (2. 5 km buffer around settlements and 0. 5 km buffer around sealed roads), depletion levels for all remaining pixels were categorized by forest type.

It would indicate the presence of a forest depleting force, possibly an increase in the mean monthly average temperature, which has been observed in Brunei over the last 30 years. 1...|$|E

The objective {{of the study is}} to empirically investigate a two-way statistical relationship between the tourism development indicators and carbon emissions in Pakistan over a period of 1991 - 2010. To recognize this relationship, a time series, co-integration and Granger Causality Tests have been employed. The study further evaluates four alternative but equally plausible hypotheses, each with different policy implications. These are: i) tourism indicators cause carbon emission (the conventional view), ii) carbon emission cause tourism indicators, iii) There is a bi-directional causality between the two variables and iv) both variables are causality independent (although highly correlated). The results reveal that tourism indicators significantly increase carbon emissions in Pakistan. The causality results only moderately support the conventional view that tourism indicators have significant long run casual effect on carbon emissions in Pakistan.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the economic impact}} of forest management on gender and food security of rural poor in Africa. The analyses reveal that deforestation places major demands on women and children 2 Ì 019 s time, limiting their opportunities to obtain an education or undertake income-generating activities. It also impairs the capacity of forests to contribute to food security. The econometric evidence applied in Cameroon taken as an accurate picture of Africa suggests that the producer prices of coffee, and cocoa, timber prices, and food crop prices influence at various degrees the decision to deforest. The agricultural value added per hectare positively affects forest cover. The fertilizer price index, the credit to farmers and the per capita GNP have no effect on the activities of deforestation. Food security is negatively correlated to <b>forest</b> <b>depletion.</b> Finally, the oil boom, the structural adjustment policies and the devaluation of the CFA franc have seriously increased the speed of <b>forest</b> <b>depletion</b> in Cameroon.

Comprehensive wealth includes manufactured, human and natural capital along with knowledge base and institutions. This study offers methodological improvements and provides estimates of the growth rate of per capita comprehensive wealth over the period 1970 - 2006 for Indian economy.

40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the effect of land-use and <b>forest</b> cover <b>depletion</b> on the distribution of soil organic carbon (SOC) within particle-size fractions in a volcanic soil. Emphasis was given to the thermal properties of soils. Six representative sites in Mexico were selected in an area dominated by Andosols: a grassland site, four forested sites with different levels of degradation and an agricultural site. Soils were fractionated using ultrasonic energy until complete dispersion was achieved. The particle-size fractions were coarse sand, fine sand, silt, clay and particulate organic matter from the coarse sand sized fraction (POM-CS) and fine sand (POM-FS). Soil organic carbon decreased by 70 % after forest conversion to cropland and long-term cultivation; forest cover loss resulted in a decrease in SOC of up to 60 %. The grassland soil contained 45 % more SOC than the cropland one. Soil organic carbon was mainly associated with the silt-size fraction; the most sensitive fractions to land-use change and <b>forest</b> cover <b>depletion</b> were POM followed by SOC associated with the silt and clay-sized fractions. Particulate organic matter can be used as an early indicator of SOC loss. The C lost from the clay and silt-sized fractions was thermally labile; therefore, the SOC stored in the more degraded forest soils was more recalcitrant (thermally resistant). Only the transformation of forest to agricultural land produced a similar loss of thermally stable C associated with the silt-sized fraction...|$|R

40|$|Despite {{the fact}} that no major piece of {{environmental}} legislation was passed in 1994, the environmental movement is not receding. Some deny that environmental problems exist, while others say that they exist but have progressed too far for intervention to be effective. The truth lies somewhere in between. Environmental problems such as acid rain, ocean pollution, destruction of rain <b>forests,</b> <b>depletion</b> of the ozone layer, indiscriminate dumping of hazardous wastes, and misuse of land and water cannot continue indefinitely, and there is no "quick fix. " Who can doubt that the major contributors to the degradation of our environment are humans? Environmental problems as instigated by humans are primarily "behavioral problems " as defined by Skinner (1) and are, therefore, subject to examination by using applied behavior analysis (2). Skinner believed that human behavior is determined to a large extent by its consequences (3) and not simply through the transfer of information or advice. That is true of children and nations when the advice involves futures that lie beyond the immediate horizon. Few people would be expected to change behavior based simply on the advice of others but when their quality of life is affected by environmental problems, such as water shortages or air pollution, change can occur very quickly. The mediating factor here is the change in attitude. Attitude change can effectively and quiddly lead to changes in behavior. These principles seem to apply not only to individuals; it is becoming increasingly evident that they may apply also at the national and international levels. There is evidence that attitudes toward the environment are changing. For example, {{there is little doubt that}} the earth's dimate is undergoing some marked alterations.
