Although it was initially believed that <b>Red</b> <b>John</b> wasnt involved in the murder, and that it was either the victims husband or uncle, it is revealed that <b>Red</b> <b>John</b> committed the murder with the help of Miriam Gottlieb, a social worker who wanted Eileen Turners child. Gottlieb tricked Turner into separating herself from her volatile husband and moving into a motel, where <b>Red</b> <b>John</b> struck. In transit after her arrest, Gottlieb commits suicide by swallowing a cyanide pill, refusing, like almost all <b>Red</b> <b>Johns</b> operatives, to be taken alive.
