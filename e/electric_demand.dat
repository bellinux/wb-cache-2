40|$|This paper {{deals with}} Turkey's {{hydropower}} potential and its long-term <b>electric</b> energy <b>demand</b> predictions. In the paper, at first, Turkey's energy sources are briefly reviewed. Then, hydropower potential is analyzed {{and it has}} been concluded that Turkey's annual economically feasible hydropower potential is about 188 Â TWh, nearly 47 % greater than the previous estimation figures of 128 Â TWh. A review on previous prediction models for Turkey's long-term <b>electric</b> energy <b>demand</b> is presented. In order to predict the future demand, new increment ratio scenarios, which depend on both observed data and future predictions of population, energy consumption per capita and total energy consumption, are developed. The results of 11 prediction models are compared and analyzed. It is concluded that Turkey's annual <b>electric</b> energy <b>demand</b> predictions in 2010, 2015 and 2020 vary between 222 and 242 (average 233) Â TWh; 302 and 356 (average 334) Â TWh; and 440 and 514 (average 476) Â TWh, respectively.

2500|$|Solar {{water heating}} makes an {{important}} contribution to renewable heat in many countries, most notably in China, which now has 70% of the global total (180 GWth). Most of these systems are installed on multi-family apartment buildings and meet a portion of the hot water needs of an estimated 50–60 million households in China. Worldwide, total installed solar water heating systems meet a portion of the water heating needs of over 70 million households. The use of biomass for heating continues to grow as well. In Sweden, national use of biomass energy has surpassed that of oil. Direct geothermal for heating is also growing rapidly.

2500|$|Demand for {{electricity}} from the world's various grids varies {{over the course}} of the day and from season to season. For the most part, variation in <b>electric</b> <b>demand</b> is met by varying the amount of electrical energy supplied from primary sources. Increasingly, however, operators are storing lower-cost energy produced at night, then releasing it to the grid during the peak periods of the day when it is more valuable. In areas where hydroelectric dams exist, release can be delayed until demand is greater; this form of storage is common and can make use of existing reservoirs. This is not storing [...] "surplus" [...] energy produced elsewhere, but the net effect is the same – although without the efficiency losses. [...] Renewable supplies with variable production, like wind and solar power, tend to increase the net variation in electric load, increasing the opportunity for grid energy storage.|$|E

[...] In this form of Geothermal, a Geothermal Heat Pump and Ground-coupled heat exchanger are used together to move heat energy into the earth (for cooling) and out of the earth (for heating) on a varying seasonal basis. [...] Low temperature Geothermal (generally referred to as [...] "GHP") is an increasingly important renewable technology because it both reduces total annual energy loads associated with heating and cooling, and it also flattens the <b>electric</b> <b>demand</b> curve eliminating the extreme summer and winter peak electric supply requirements. [...] Thus Low Temperature Geothermal/GHP is becoming an increasing national priority with multiple tax credit support and focus as part of the ongoing movement toward Net Zero Energy.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{potential}} of electric vehicles to meet the mobility demand currently met by conventional fuel vehicles and explores the application of GIS datasets to geo-reference the <b>electric</b> energy <b>demand</b> resulting from their deployment on large geographical areas. The study is based on driving patterns collected from conventional fuel vehicles in the Italian provinces of Modena and Firenze by means of on-board GPS systems. The analysis is carried out over one month, considering approximately 28, 000 vehicles and 36 million kilometres. Two types of battery electric vehicles and five recharging behavioural models are considered, to evaluate the trips and the fleet share suitable to be served by EVs, by following all the trips and parking sequences in the databases. This allows deriving {{the impact on the}} electricity grid of the electrification of urban vehicles in terms of additional <b>electric</b> energy <b>demand</b> and its geographical distribution. The results show that more than 80 % of the urban trips can be covered by electric vehicles and that an urban fleet share between 8 % and 28 % could be replaced by the current generation of electric vehicles without any change in their driving patterns. The derived <b>electric</b> energy <b>demand</b> increase remains below 5 % of the total <b>electric</b> energy <b>demand,</b> and below 20 % of the domestic <b>electric</b> energy <b>demand</b> in the analysed areas. The geographical analysis shows in detail how this additional demand is distributed over the areas analysed, and how it compares with the already available recharging infrastructures in the two provinces.
