25|$|Tron was {{released}} on July 9, 1982, in 1,091 theaters grossing USD $4 million on its opening weekend. It went on to make $33 million in North America, which Disney saw as a disappointment, {{and led to the}} studio writing off a <b>good</b> <b>chunk</b> <b>of</b> its $17 million budget.|$|E
25|$|Christmas Island, due to {{its close}} {{proximity}} to Australia's northern neighbours, falls within many of the satellite footprints throughout the region. This results in ideal conditions for receiving various Asian broadcasts, which locals sometimes prefer to those emanating from Western Australia. Additionally, ionospheric conditions are conducive to terrestrial radio transmissions, from HF through VHF and sometimes into UHF. The island plays home to a small array of radio equipment that spans a <b>good</b> <b>chunk</b> <b>of</b> the usable spectrum. Avariety of government owned and operated antenna systems are employed on the island {{to take advantage of}} this.|$|E
500|$|... "Eh, Eh (Nothing Else I Can Say)" [...] {{received}} mixed {{to negative}} reviews from music critics. Alexis Petridis from The Guardian noted that [...] "Eh, Eh" [...] bears {{the influence of}} early 1990s Europop and [...] "is the first song {{in a long time}} that warrants comparison to the œuvre of Ace of Base. Matthew Chisling of AllMusic gave a negative review of the song saying [...] "The Fame has it's 'ballad,' however the breezy 'Eh, Eh' doesn't hold water on this album; rather, it feels dry and lifeless, something which holds this album back". Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine said that [...] "the breezy island vibe and soft demeanor of 'Eh, Eh (Nothing Else I Can Say)' is hard to buy when sandwiched between songs like 'Poker Face' and 'Beautiful, Dirty, Rich.'" [...] In another article analysing about the music videos released by Gaga, Oscar Moralde from Slant Magazine noted that [...] "Eh, Eh" [...] as a track [...] "is an intriguing case: rather than the tech-assisted sexy-androgynous dance pop that dominates a <b>good</b> <b>chunk</b> <b>of</b> The Fame, it and its sister tracks 'Brown Eyes' and 'Again Again' are evidence of a stripped-down, simpler, sincere Gaga.|$|E

50|$|Falling {{out of the}} Football League were Tranmere Rovers, who {{suffered}} a second relegation {{in a row and}} dropped into the Football Conference after 94 years. Cheltenham Town filled the second relegation spot, falling out of the Football League after 16 years; they had started the season reasonably well with 23 points from 14 games, but imploded disastrously after long-serving manager Mark Yates was sacked in favour of Paul Buckle, with not even the late-season arrival of veteran manager Gary Johnson saving them. Hartlepool United had been in the relegation zone for <b>good</b> <b>chunks</b> <b>of</b> the season, but an impressive March saw the club fight their way to safety.|$|R
50|$|Couper's work {{is little}} known, both because <b>good</b> <b>chunks</b> <b>of</b> his life are left {{entirely in the}} dark and because many of his {{publications}} have become exceedingly difficult to locate, particularly The Canadian Sportsman and Naturalist. His specimens have also been scattered: the Lyman Museum of McGill University owns many of his Coleoptera specimens, and a number of moths. Laval also owns a large collection of insects and a number of higher animals. Other naturalized specimens are scattered between various institutions, from the Royal Ontario Museum to the Smithsonian Institution. He remained all his life an enthusiastic promoter of entomology, and his influence on the work of those who followed his lead {{in the early years of}} Canadian Entomology is perhaps his greatest legacy.|$|R
500|$|Harley Carlson of MetalReview.com {{regarded}} Octavarium as [...] "successfully [...] the band's {{ability to}} craft emotive music," [...] although {{noted that it}} is [...] "unquestionably Dream Theater, yet there is something missing." [...] Vik Bansal of musicOMH praised [...] "Never Enough", [...] "Panic Attack" [...] and [...] "Sacrificed Sons", but dismissed [...] "The Root of All Evil" [...] as [...] "Dream Theater by the numbers". He criticized [...] "Octavarium" [...] as [...] "bloated", although noted that fans of the band's A Change of Seasons would enjoy it. He said that [...] "there's enough on the remainder of Octavarium to keep {{the rest of us}} interested and the prog rock haters whining dismissively". Writing for Exclaim!, Greg Pratt praised the album's artwork and production, but said that [...] "there’s nothing that blows any minds here, or even gives a mild bend; hell, a <b>good</b> <b>chunk</b> <b>of</b> this disc feels like basic radio rock from the local old-guy bar band". He noted that although there were some longer songs on the album, [...] "this just feels like 76 minutes of overdramatic rock, too heavy on the light and weak, and not enough time spent on just showing off".|$|E
500|$|Richard Eisenbeis of Kotaku {{described}} Makoto Yuki {{as being}} an initially [...] "ambivalent, broken character" [...] and added that the character's growth took center stage in the film. He also remarked that the film could have [...] "been a very dark, difficult-to-see movie" [...] since the majority of it takes place at night but praised the lighting effects and contrasts which rendered the action easily visible while creating a [...] "visual style all its own". On the flip side, Eisenbeis explained that while the movie covers only {{the very beginning of}} the Persona 3 story, there was [...] "the unfortunate side effect of a <b>good</b> <b>chunk</b> <b>of</b> the main cast and the majority of the antagonists not even being in the movie." [...] Adding that since none of the game's key plot twists are reached, he felt that it was [...] "a very simple, straight-forward movie." [...] Eisenbeis also noted that the film had [...] "more images of teen suicide than you can shake a stick at". The [...] "Evokers" [...] which in the Persona 3 world allowed the characters to summon Personas by putting one to their heads and pulling the trigger, were likened to guns in this context. Despite not being actual weapons, Eisenbeis stated that [...] "it still looks like they are blowing their brains out — often complete with spiritual brain and skull fragments." ...|$|E

Wesley Morris of The Boston Globe wrote that though the film is [...] "built on too much {{ponderous}} self-regard...here is a <b>good</b> <b>chunk</b> <b>of</b> Lady in the Water that is simply too well made and affectingly acted to dismiss as a mere exercise in arrogance." ...|$|E
5000|$|The TV/EP {{received}} generally mixed {{to positive}} reviews from critics, {{many of which}} note the EP's positive feeling but its limited appeal. James Greene Jr. of Crawdaddy.com said that [...] "the TV/EP will surely appease the band’s legions of rabid fans and anyone who likes a <b>good</b> 15-minute <b>chunk</b> <b>of</b> novelty music." [...] TheyWillRockYou.com gave the album 4-out-of-5 stars and concluded {{that it is a}} [...] "fun throwaway album from a great band" [...] but that its [...] "lasting value... is debatable." [...] Likewise, Allmusic.com called the record [...] "fast and fun," [...] with a [...] "cool idea" [...] but ultimately [...] "too disjointed to be anything more than a one-listen novelty." ...|$|R

2500|$|By {{the late}} 1970s with acting {{assignments}} becoming scarcer, Oliver turned to directing. She {{was one of}} the original 19 women admitted to the American Film Institute's Directing Workshop for Women (AFI DWW) [...] "who, upon her early death, left a <b>good</b> <b>chunk</b> <b>of</b> funding for the DWW." [...] In 1977, she wrote and directed Cowboysan, her AFI DWW short film which presents the fantasy scenario of a Japanese actor and actress playing leads in an American western. Oliver directed two TV episodes, the October 25, 1982, installment of M*A*S*H and the December 4, 1983, entry of one of its sequel series, Trapper John, M.D..|$|E
2500|$|GameSpy's Thierry Nguyen {{scored the}} PC version 2.5 out of 5, calling it [...] "well-meaning but {{ultimately}} flawed." [...] He too disliked Billy's levels, especially the platforming sections. He concluded [...] "Call of Juarez {{is a game}} we wanted to like, as it has most of the requisite elements that we {{look for in a}} Western. It's just that the really sloppy platforming and box-moving, which take up a <b>good</b> <b>chunk</b> <b>of</b> the game, puts a big damper on any joy that we might find in shooting up bandits and cowboys." [...] Sterling McGarvey also scored the Xbox 360 version 2.5 out of 5, calling it [...] "yet another Tex-Mex shooter that seems to have been made by a bunch of guys who've watched a few too many Westerns but haven't figured out how to get the ambience and authenticity of the historical period down." [...] He praised the shooting mechanics, but concluded [...] "For the most part, Call of Juarez has taken two core ideas and melded them into a game. [...] There will be inevitable comparisons to Neversoft's GUN, but CoJ feels much more a next-gen version of the lackluster Dead Man's Hand than anything else." ...|$|E
2500|$|Critics gave The Simpsons Cartoon Studio {{generally}} favorable reviews, and {{it received}} a lot of hype in the United States around the time it was released. A reviewer for The Palm Beach Post wrote that it is not very easy to create the cartoons: [...] "Layering characters, props, sound effects and dialogue into seamless animation is no small task, and you'll invest a <b>good</b> <b>chunk</b> <b>of</b> time with this CD-ROM before you're ready to premiere your own Simpsons episodes. But if you're fan enough to go the distance, this is a remarkably versatile program that turns out great-looking cartoons." [...] Similarly, Jane Clifford of The San Diego Union-Tribune called it [...] "quite a challenging product" [...] which produces cartoons that [...] "really look professional." [...] Benjamin Svetkey of Entertainment Weekly gave it a B+ rating, commenting that the cartoons created [...] "can be entertaining, but they're hampered by a failing common to the make-your-own-movie genre: Since Cartoon Studio has a limited number of voice clips ('Ay, caramba!', 'Mmm... donuts', and about 50 variations on 'Bart!'), your plot choices are restricted to the usual pranks, pratfalls, and catchphrases. Still, as Homer would say, The Simpsons Cartoon Studio is more 'Woohoo!' than 'D'oh!'." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Italian band Lacuna Coil {{has also}} become a [...] "premiere act" [...] of the gothic metal genre. The group employs both a female vocalist Cristina Scabbia and a male vocalist Andrea Ferro, {{although}} the group uses less of a 'beauty and the beast' style, with Ferro primarily using clean vocals. Formed in Milan in 1994, they released a demo tape in 1996 strongly influenced by Paradise Lost and Type O Negative. The band [...] "turned a lot of heads in Italy's ambient/goth scene" [...] with their self-titled EP in 1998. Their debut album In a Reverie was released in 1999 with a style that bore [...] "some similarities to contemporaries like the Gathering and Moonspell". Lacuna Coil's music was also [...] "more accessible than many of their peers". A second album Unleashed Memories arrived in 2001 but it was their third full length Comalies that became their breakthrough album, [...] "highly praised by the metal world after its release in October 2002". On the strength of Comalies, Lacuna Coil became the most successful artist {{in the history of}} their label Century Media Records as well as the highest selling rock act in their home country Italy. The band has also achieved the distinction of being the first and, as of late 2007, the only European gothic metal band to successfully break into the United States market with radio airplay and impressive album sales. Their highly anticipated fourth album Karmacode was even more successful, debuting at number28 on the Billboard charts, and also debuting on many European music charts. The Comalies and Karmacode albums [...] "reportedly sold nearly 1million units combined worldwide, a <b>good</b> <b>chunk</b> <b>of</b> that in the States". The band has also performed on the main stage of the American heavy metal festival Ozzfest. Their last two albums Shallow Life and Dark Adrenaline debuted at number 16 and number 15, respectively, on the Billboard charts.|$|E
