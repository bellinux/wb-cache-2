40|$|SUMMARY Toluidine blue {{staining}} {{was used}} to detect Chlamydia trachomatis inclusions in both McCoy and HeLa- 229 cells from clinical specimens. This method was more sensitive than iodine staining for detecting C trachomatis inclusions in both McCoy and HeLa- 229 cells and also more sensitive than Giemsa staining for detecting chlamydial inclusions in HeLa- 229 cells. While its sensitivity for detection of chlamydial inclusions in McCoy cells is {{equal to that of}} Giemsa staining, toluidine blue staining is easier and faster to perform. Different staining methods have been used to detect chlamydial inclusions in cell cultures. Giemsa stain-ing followed by dark ground microscopy has been the most commonly used technique. The glycogen matrix of Chlamydia trachomatis inclusions can be detected using various stains-for example, iodine' carmine, 2 and periodic acid Schiff. 3 Iodine staining combined with bright field microscopy is probably the simplest of all staining techniques for detecting C trachomatis inclusions, but compared with Giemsa and carmine it is less sensitive. 4 Periodic acid Schiff stain is useful in that inclusions are detectable by both bright and dark field microscopy, but the actual staining technique is quite complex, as is that for carmine. 5 Methylene blue stain combined with dark field microscopy is said to be useful for the diagnosis of infection caused by the <b>enzootic</b> <b>ovine</b> <b>abortion</b> strain of C psittaci. 6 But it offers no advantage over Giemsa or iodine stains for the detection of C trachomatis inclusions. : Immunofluorescent staining 7 seems to be both fast and sensitive but it requires the use of expensive reagents. Recently, a methyl green-neutral red stain-ing technique {{has been found to be}} highly sensitive for detecting C psittaci inclusions combined with bright field microscopy. 8 It is as sensitive as Giemsa staining combined with dark field microscopy for detecting C trachomatis inclusions.

40|$|<b>Ovine</b> <b>enzootic</b> <b>abortion</b> is an {{infectious}} and contagious disease clinically characterized by abortion and weak neonates, affecting sheep and goats. The etiological agent is Chlamydophila (C.) abortus, {{which is considered}} one of the most common animal pathogens of small ruminants; it has important economic implications and represents a significant zoonotic risk. Clinical diagnosis is often difficult because the clinical signs and the pathological lesions are not specific for C. abortus infection, in fact they can also be observed as a result of infections with other abortifacient agents. Moreover, the involvement of the laboratory is necessary to perform the definitive diagnosis. One hundred and seventeen vaginal swabs from sheep with clinical signs related to chlamydial infection were examined by a PCR-RFLP assay that demonstrated high specifity and sensitivity. Six samples were positive for C. abortus. Vaginal swabs are easy to handle and allow to deal with biohazardous material in safety conditions. [ [...] . ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Prevention {{and control}} of <b>ovine</b> <b>enzootic</b> <b>abortion</b> (OEA) can be {{achieved}} by application of a live vaccine. In this study, five sheep flocks with different vaccination and infection status were serologically tested using a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (cELISA) specific for Chlamydophila (Cp.) abortus over a two-year time period. Results Sheep in Flock A with recent OEA history had high antibody values after vaccination similar to Flock C with natural Cp. abortus infections. In contrast, OEA serology negative sheep (Flock E) showed individual animal-specific immunoreactions after vaccination. Antibody levels of vaccinated ewes in Flock B ranged from negative to positive two and three years after vaccination, respectively. Positive antibody values in the negative control Flock D (without OEA or vaccination) are probably due to asymptomatic intestinal infections with Cp. abortus. Excretion of the attenuated strain of Cp. abortus used in the live vaccine through the eye was not observed in vaccinated animals of Flock E. Conclusion The findings of our study indicate that, using serology, no distinction can be made between vaccinated and naturally infected sheep. As a result, confirmation of a negative OEA status in vaccinated animals by serology cannot be determined. </p...|$|R
40|$|Proteins {{present in}} the outer {{membrane}} of chlamydiae {{that are involved in}} mucosal epithelial cell infection must clearly be identified and characterized if we are to understand and modify the pathogenic mechanisms utilized by these organisms. We have identified and isolated a family of four genes encoding putative outer membrane proteins (POMPs), a group of proteins of approximately 90 kDa {{present in the}} outer membrane of the subtype of Chlamydia psittaci that causes <b>ovine</b> <b>enzootic</b> <b>abortion</b> (strain S 26 / 3). These proteins, although minor components, are major immunogens, as shown by the immunoblotting of chlamydial outer membrane complexes with postabortion sheep sera, and are therefore potential diagnostic and/or protective antigen candidates. Immunoblotting of the expressed amino- and carboxy-terminal halves of one of the POMPs with postabortion sheep sera showed that the major humoral immune response appeared to be directed solely against the amino-terminal half. This result, in combination with the positive immunofluorescence staining of S 26 / 3 -infected cells using POMP-specific (specific to the amino-terminal half of the proteins) monoclonal antibodies, suggests the probable surface localization of the POMPs and, more specifically, the surface exposure of the amino-terminal half of these proteins. The four pomp genes are highly homologous, sharing 82 to 100 % similarity with each other (two of the genes are identical). Genes with strong and weak homologies were also detected in C. psittaci avian and feline pneumonitis strains, respectively. No pomp homologs were found in strains of C. trachomatis and C. pneumoniae, but this does not preclude their existence. The absence of homology with various subtypes of C. pecorum, which complicate the diagnosis of the <b>ovine</b> <b>abortion</b> subtype, indicates the possible suitability of the these 90 -kDa proteins as serodiagnostic antigens...|$|R

Limited evidence exists {{that members of the}} order Chlamydiales can also cause ocular disease in sheep. In the current study, the prevalence of chlamydiae in the eyes of sheep was investigated by using PCR methods. Data obtained in sheep by broad-range 16 S rRNA order Chlamydiales-specific PCR were compared to the prevalence of antibodies against chlamydiae detected by a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (cELISA). Flocks tested included a clinically healthy flock and two flocks suffering from ocular disease and with histories of <b>Ovine</b> <b>Enzootic</b> <b>Abortion</b> (OEA). PCR detected DNA of Chlamydophila (Cp.) abortus and Cp. pecorum in the eyes of both healthy and sick animals but also identified Chlamydia (C.) suis and a variety of uncultured chlamydia-like organisms. Good correlation was found between the presence of Cp. abortus DNA in sheep conjunctival samples and seropositivity detected by cELISA. Despite these findings, no association was found between the presence of chlamydial DNA in the sheep conjunctival samples and the onset of clinical disease. These results suggest that the biodiversity of chlamydiae in the eyes of sheep is greater than that previously thought. Further investigations are needed to determine whether a causal relationship between infection by chlamydiae and ocular disease exists in these animals...|$|R

An initial analysis performed with 34 selected genetic loci on 34 ruminant strains including the variant Greek strains LLG and POS resulted {{in the identification of}} 5 polymorphic loci, confirming the widely held notion that is a very homogeneous species. Analysis of additional 111 samples with the selected 5 loci resulted in the classification of all strains into 6 genotypes with distinct molecular patterns termed genotypes [1] through [6]. Interestingly, the classification of the isolates in the 6 genotypes was partly related to their geographical origin. Direct examination of clinical samples proved the MLVA to be suitable for direct typing. Analysis of the genomic sequences in 6 prototypes of amplicons generated with each of the 5 selected VNTR primers revealed that variation between genotypes was caused by {{the presence or absence of}} coding tandem repeats in 3 loci.

So far there are only diagnostic tools available to confirm the disease after abortion. The purpose of this study was to measure and monitor the IgG antibody response against polymorphic outer membrane protein POMP 90 - 3 (which is a part of a protein present on the surface of C. abortus) during the development of a model of latency and see if there are possibilities to predict abortion, using the indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay rOMP 90 - 3 iELISA (developed at Moredun Research Institute, Edinburgh). Three groups were intranasally infected with different doses of C. abortus before they were mated. A negative control group was intranasally challenged with uninfected yolk sacs before mating and a positive control group was infected subcutaneous over the left prefemoral lymp node at 10 weeks of gestation (the standard method of infection in OEA studies). The antibody responses of all groups were followed for the first 13 months. During the latent phase a significant difference in antibody titers between groups 1 and 2 and the control group was detected. This shows that it is possible to detect an infection early in gestation or may be even before pregnancy. Although due to huge variations between animals, the test is perhaps not appropriate for that purpose. The intranasal route of infection before mating seems to be a better model for natural infection than the traditional method, subcutaneous over the left prefemoral lymph node. The intranasally way of infection shows the latency period and gives a higher percentage of abortion...|$|R
40|$|Chlamydophila abortus {{is one of}} the {{pathogens}} which induce {{abortion in}} small ruminants; this pathogen has a tropism for ruminant placenta and causes the disease commonly referred to as <b>Ovine</b> <b>Enzootic</b> <b>Abortion</b> (OEA). In Europe are estimated economic losses of around 20 million pounds a year by OEA. In the American Continent the disease has been reported only in Canada, the United States, Colombia and Chile while in Mexico it is unknown whether OEA is common and it is causing abortions in flocks of sheep from ÂEstado de MexicoÂ. The objective of this study was investigating the prevalence of anti-Chlamydophila abortus IgG antibodies and detection of C. abortus DNA in sheep with clinical abort history by mean of ELISA assay (C. abortus ELISA, Institute Pourquier, Montpellier, France) and molecular identification of the principal outer membrane protein (POMP 90 - 91 B) gene by PCR, respectively. A cross-sectional study was carried out to enroll and random sample of ewes from november 2003 until march 2005. A total of 349 sera and vaginal swabs samples were collected from 35 flocks of sheep from Xalatlaco. The results showed that the seropositive rate was 31. 1 % (14 / 45) for healthy and 21. 3 % (65 / 304) for sheep with history clinical of abort.

The {{purpose of this study was}} to characterise the transcriptional expression patterns of this family during the developmental cycle of C. abortus. McCoy cells were infected with C. abortus and analysed for pmp mRNA expression over a 72 Â h period. Few pmp transcripts were detected in the early stages of the developmental cycle. Peak expression occurred at 48 Â h post-infection (p. i.) other than for pmp 5 E, where it was observed at 24 Â h p. i. Overall, expression of pmps 5 E, 18 D and 10 G were found to be 40 to 100 -fold higher than the lowest expressing pmps (6 H, 13 G and 15 G) at 24 Â h p. i., while pmps 18 D and 17 G were 14 to 16 -fold higher than the lowest (11 G, 14 G and 15 G) at 48 Â h. Levels of expression for all the other pmp genes were below one copy per genome at any time point. The expression of all the pmps reduced to near base-line levels by 60 Â h p. i. These results demonstrate that pmp expression in C. abortus is mid to late cycle, consistent with conversion of the reticulate body to the elementary body. The low level of pmp transcription may be indicative of heterogeneity in expression, suggesting a possible role for some of the Pmps in antigenic variation and chlamydial pathogenesis...|$|R

In this study. a recombinant enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (rELISA) (medac, Hamburg, Germany), based on a unique chlamydial genus-specific epitope of Chlamydia trachomatis L 2 lipopolysaccharide, was evaluated for sensitivity and specificity as a primary screening assay for OEA by comparison with the CFT. A comparative inclusion immunofluorescence assay (IFA), in which antibody titers to C. psittaci and Chlamydia pecorum were examined, {{was used as the}} reference test for 573 serum samples from four flocks. Reactivity to C. pecorum was measured since inapparent intestinal infections by C. pecorum are believed to be common in British flocks. In detecting positive sera from an abortion-affected flock, in which a C. pecorum infection was also suggested by IFA, the rELISA outperformed the CFT with significant evidence for increased sensitivity (P = 0. 003). In two flocks in which C. pecorum infections alone were suggested by IFA, the rELISA and CFT were prone to detect low levels of false-positive results, but the values were not significant. The rELISA provided results in one flock in which sera that were anticomplementary could not be resolved by the CFT. In another flock in which abortion had not occurred but infection by both chlamydial species was suspected, no significant difference was found between the sensitivities of the rELISA and CFT. The rELISA could not differentiate ovine C. psittaci and C. pecorum infections but was shown to be a more sensitive primary screening test for OEA than was the CFT, particularly where abortion had occurred and even when antibodies due to additional inapparent infection(s) by C. pecorum were present...|$|R

In addition to reproductive failures, infection may impact lamb growth {{during the first}} weeks after birth, yet this effect has not been well characterized. Vaccination can help to control the disease but variable efficacy values have been described, possibly related with factors associated with the host, the vaccine, the parameter used for efficacy determination and the challenge conditions. In this context, we evaluated the efficacy of an inactivated standard commercial vaccine and a 1 / 2 diluted dose in pregnant sheep challenged with C. abortus by examining multiple indicators ofvaccine effect (including incidence of reproductive failures, bacterial excretion, and evolution of weight gain of viable lambs during {{the first month of}} life). Three groups of ewes [control non-vaccinated, C (n = 18); vaccinated with standard dose, SV (n = 16) and vaccinated with 1 / 2 dose, DV (n = 17) ], were challenged approximately 90 days post-mating and tested using direct PCR (tissue samples and vaginal swabs) and ELISA (serum) until 31 days post-reproductive outcome. There were not significant differences in the proportions of reproductive failures or bacterial shedding after birth/abortion regardless the vaccination protocol. However, a beneficial effect of vaccination on offspring growth was detected in both vaccinated groups compared with the controls, with a mean increase in weight measured at 30 days of life of 1. 5 and 2. 5 Kg (p = 0. 056) and an increase in the geometric mean of the daily gain of 8. 4 and 9. 7 % in lambs born from DV and SV ewes compared to controls, respectively.

40|$|Abstract. Chlamydia psittaci is a {{major cause}} of <b>ovine</b> <b>abortion</b> in the fourth to fifth months of gestation. During the lambing seasons of 1986, 1987, and 1988, fetuses from 52 cases of <b>ovine</b> <b>abortion,</b> stillbirth, or {{perinatal}} death were submitted to the laboratory for necropsy examination. Placenta or fetal tissues from 34 cases were cultured on mouse L cells for C. psittaci. Chlamydia psittaci was identified by immunofluorescence on cultures in 20 of these cases. The major gross lesion consistently associated with Chlamydial abortion was placentitis with multifocal cotyledonary necrosis and accumulation of red-brown exudate in the intercotyledonary placenta Chlamydiae appeared as spherical organisms, less than 1 Âµm in diameter, in the cytoplasm of tropho-blasts in impression smears of cotyledons. H istologically, placentitis was sometimes accompanied by pneumonia or encephalitis in the fetus. Chlamydia psittaci was considered the cause for fetal death when Chlamydial isolation was associated with placentitis or inflammation of other fetal tissues and when other abortifacient agents were not detected.

Over the last 50 years the serological diagnosis of infection has been based mainly on the complement fixation test (CFT), which lacks both sensitivity and specificity because of cross-reactive antibodies to other gram-negative bacteria, including another common chlamydial pathogen of sheep, Chlamydophila pecorum. In the present study, a series of overlapping recombinant antigens representing the polymorphic outer membrane protein POMP 90 of C. abortus was assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with a panel of 143 serum samples from sheep experimentally infected with C. abortus, from sheep clinically free of OEA, and from specific-pathogen-free lambs experimentally infected with different subtypes of C. pecorum. The results were compared to those obtained by CFT and another recently described test, an indirect ELISA (iELISA) with the recombinant OMP 91 B (rOMP 91 B) fragment (rOMP 91 B iELISA) (D. Longbottom, E. Psarrou, M. Livingstone, and E. Vretou, FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 195 : 157 - 161, 2001). The rOMP 90 - 3 and rOMP 90 - 4 ELISAs were identified as being more sensitive and specific than CFT. Assays with both fragments were evaluated further with a panel of 294 field serum samples from flocks with documented histories of abortion, from flocks with no clinical histories of abortion but which had {{a high proportion of}} samples seropositive by CFT, and from animals with no histories of abortion but from which various C. pecorum subtypes had been isolated. ELISAs with both POMP 90 fragments outperformed CFT with serum samples from C. pecorum-infected animals, producing no false-positive results. However, the ELISA with the rOMP 90 - 4 fragment appeared to be more sensitive than the one with rOMP 90 - 3, as it identified more of the OEA-positive samples. The ELISA with the rOMP 90 - 4 fragment was also able to identify apparently healthy animals that were infected with an enteric strain of C. abortus in flocks that were probably infected with both enteric C. abortus and C. pecorum strains. The identification of animals infected with enteric C. abortus is extremely important in controlling the spread of OEA.

The same findings were also recorded in the foetus and the foetal membranes of a pregnant ewe that died and was necropsied; on the foetal membranes of that animal, bright yellow-coloured amniotic plaques were also seen. Lameness was recorded in 3 % of the ewes in the flock; oedema of the periarticular tissues and sparse synovial fluid in the infected joints were evident in a ewe that died and was necropsied. Long-standing lameness was recorded in two fattening pigs, reared in the farm. E. rhusiopathiae was isolated in pure culture and heavy growth from joints of the pigs, joints, lungs, liver, foetuses and placentae of the ewe that died, aborted foetuses and placentae from the ewes that aborted, synovial fluid from the lame ewes.

Etiologic diagnoses {{were made in}} 786 (44 %). Infectious agents were found responsible in 702 accessions (39 %), and noninfectious causes were involved in 84 (5 %). No diagnosis was made in 998 accessions (56 %), 61 of which were mummified fetuses. Lesions, most of which indicated {{the presence of an}} infectious agent, were found in 274 cases (15 %) in which no agent could be identified. Together, Toxoplasma gondii, Campylobacter sp., and Chlamydia psittaci caused- 25 % of all abortions and stillbirths examined. In a 10 -year period, 1980 - 1989, 1, 799 ovine abor-tions and stillbirths were submitted to the South Da...|$|R
40|$|During 2009 â 2010, 161 {{tissue samples}} (142 placentas, 16 brains, and 3 livers) from aborted ovine fetuses on Sardinia Island, Italy, were tested for toxoplasmosis. Organs {{that showed a}} {{positive}} result by nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) targeting the ITS 1 region for Toxoplasma gondii were also amplified with 11 genetic markers (SAG 1, 5 â²-SAG 2, 3 â²-SAG 2, SAG 3, BTUB, GRA 6, c 22 - 8, c 29 - 2, L 358, PK 1, and Apico) and then subjected to PCR/RFLP for genetic typing. T. gondii DNA was found in 5 placentas, 14 brains, and 2 livers by PCR analysis and all isolates displayed Type II alleles at all 11 loci with all 11 markers.

40|$|Salmonella {{montevideo}} is a recognised {{cause of}} <b>ovine</b> <b>abortion</b> {{and can cause}} disease in other domestic animals and humans. The organism was isolated from the aborted fetuses of a bitch from a pack of foxhounds. The subsequent collection of rectal swabs from the foxhounds at approximately two week inter-vals over a 48 -day period resulted in the isolation of S monte-video from 50 of the 61 hounds in the pack on one or more occasions. Some of the hounds had gained access to an open pit containing dead ewes and aborted fetuses on a farm where the housed ewe flock was experiencing S montevideo infection. The S montevideo isolates from both the ovine and canine samples had a plasmid of 120 kilobases with an identical restriction endonuclease fragmentation pattern. The only other isolate from a contemporary outbreak lacked this plas-mid. It was concluded that this case offered further evidenc...|$|R
40|$|Chlamydophila abortus (C. abortus) is the {{responsible}} agent for chlamydial abortion [commonly known as Enzootic Abortion of Ewes (EAE) ] and, as such, it causes major financial losses to the sheep industry worldwide. Isolation of the pathogen {{is considered the}} 'gold standard' and most sensitive method of detection for diagnosing chlamydial infection. So far, {{there has been no}} isolation of C. abortus from ovines in Sardinia, Italy. This letter describes the results of a study conducted on a total of 89 aborted samples (40 foetuses and 49 placentae) collected in 2010 in Northern Sardinia, Italy. Three placentae resulted PCR-positive when analyzed using the putative outer membrane protein (pmp) specific primers, the test lead to the identification and first isolation in cell culture of C. abortus. This letter to the editor describes the first isolation of C. abortus from ovine placentae and increases the knowledge of one of the agents that causes <b>ovine</b> <b>abortion</b> in Sardinia and, more generally, in the Mediterranean basin...|$|R
40|$|Chlamydiaceae are {{a family}} of obligate {{intracellular}} Gram-negative bacteria causing disease in man and animals. C. abortus is a major abortigenic agent in ruminants, causing <b>ovine</b> <b>enzootic</b> <b>abortion</b> (OEA). C. psittaci causes respiratory disease (avian chlamydiosis) in birds and psittacosis or parrot-fever in man. In Chapter I, an overview is given of the epidemiology, prevention, treatment and zoonotic risk of Chlamydiaceae infections in Chinese livestock. Differences in risk-factors, such as bio-security measures, and use of diagnostic tests and veterinary practices applied in China are compared to the West. In Chapter II, we examined the occurrence of C. abortus in Belgian ruminants by serology and molecular diagnosis. Sampling herds at n â¥ 10 revealed a seropositive herd status in 14. 3 % (6 / 42), 50 % (1 / 2) and 11. 6 % (11 / 95) of sheep, goat and cattle herds, respectively. Seroprevalence in one goat herd was 52. 9 % (9 / 17), but prevalence in positive sheep and cattle herds was generally limited to only 1 or 2 seropositive animals on 10 to 20 tested animals per herd. Molecular diagnosis on rectal swabs sampled at 3 cattle farms tested all negative for Chlamydiaceae DNA. In Chapter III, part A, we examined the pathogenicity of the well characterized C. psittaci genotype B (CP 3) and D (92 / 1293) strains in experimentally (aerosol) infected SPF chickens. Both strains caused conjunctivitis, rhinitis and dyspnoea. Pharyngeal and cloacal C. psittaci excretion was observed in all infected animals, indicative for systemic dissemination as proven by immunofluorescence staining of frozen tissue sections. Histopathological lesions were present in all infected chickens. However, differences in pathology were observed as genotype D was more virulent than genotype B, creating mortality and more severe clinical signs and lesions. In Chapter III, part B, sera of 30 Belgian and 10 Northern French chicken farms were tested by a C. psittaci MOMP-based ELISA. Ninety-six percent, 93 % and 90 % of the Belgian broilers, broiler breeders and layers were seropositive. Ninety-one percent of the French broilers were seropositive. In addition, tissues of 5 Belgian and 5 French broiler farms were examined at slaughter. All French farms ware culture positive while C. psittaci was cultured from the lungs of 80 % of examined Belgian farms. Chlamydia psittaci infections are apparently emerging in chickens raised in Belgium and Northern France. We could proof Hill-Evans postulates for chicken-derived C. psittaci genotype B and D strains. In Chapter III, part C, we focused on the histopathological lesions caused in experimentally infected SPF chickens. SPF chickens were experimentally infected with C. psittaci strain 10 / 423 (genotype B), 10 / 525 (genotype B) or 10 / 298 (genotype D), which were all isolated from Belgian or French broilers with pneumonia. All strains induced conjunctivitis, rhinitis, sinusitis, tracheitis, bronchitis, pneumonitis, airosacculitis, splenitis, hepatitis, nephritis and enteritis. Inflammation of the ovaries was only observed in genotype D infected chickens. Overall, the genotype D strain caused more severe histopathological lesions and a high mortality rate (54. 5 %) early upon infection. In addition, severity of lesions increased more rapidly in genotype D as compared to genotype B infected birds, which suggests faster replication in internal organ...|$|R
40|$|Infectious disease: Minireview. [...] 5 pÃ¡ginas, 1 figura. Conditions causing {{reproductive}} failure are {{a significant}} concern in the livestock industry, and amongst these, ovine toxoplasmosis {{is one of the}} most important. Despite decades of research, there remain gaps in knowledge about this disease, especially regarding the pathogenesis of abortion in sheep. As for other diseases causing <b>ovine</b> <b>abortion,</b> such as chlamydial abortion or border disease, the consequences of infection with Toxoplasma gondii depend largely on the stage of gestation, but the mechanisms involved are not well understood. Immunological modulation occurring during gestation has been proposed as the main mechanism accounting for this clinical variation. However, the extent and effect of such modulation has not yet been identified clearly in sheep and the involvement of other unknown factors has been proposed. Recent experimental studies have defined an unacknowledged clinical presentation of <b>ovine</b> toxoplasmosis, where <b>abortions</b> occur during the acute phase of infection, resulting in as high as 100 % fetal loss in susceptible sheep. The pathogenesis of this clinical form differs from that of classically described ovine toxoplasmosis, and its pathological features resemble those of the perinatal syndrome known as cerebral palsy in man. A range of variables, including individual susceptibility, isolate virulence and infective dose, have been proposed as key factors in the development of one or the other of these clinical forms and warrants further investigation in this important disease.

40|$|A chlamydial plasmid, 6. 2 kb in size, was {{isolated}} from an avian strain of Chlamydia psittaci and cloned into the EcoRI site of pUC 13. A restriction enzyme cleavage {{map of the}} resultant clone, pAPp, was {{very similar to the}} published map of the plasmid cloned from the C. psittaci meningopneumonitis strain Cal- 10. Southern hybridisation analyses using pAPp as a probe, revealed the presence of plasmids with homologous DNA sequences in avian psittacosis, avian ornithosis, ovine polyarthritis and sporadic bovine encephalomyelitis strains of C. psittaci, as well as the LGV strain of Chlamydia trachomatis. Plasmid was not detected in koala conjunctivitis, <b>ovine</b> <b>abortion</b> or feline conjunctivitis isolates. The plasmid-containing isolates could be grouped according to size (6. 2 or 7. 2 - 7. 3 kb) and restriction endonuclease pattern. These three plasmid categories correlate with previously reported C. psittaci biotypes, immunotypes and serotypes. The absence of plasmid from three infectious, pathogenic strains of C. psittaci suggests that, in this species at least, plasmid-encoded genes are not essential for survival, infectivity or virulence of the parasite...|$|R
40|$|Monoclonal {{antibodies}} (MAbs) {{were produced}} to four Chlamydia psittaci isolates: NJ 1 and TT 3 from turkeys, VS 1 from a parakeet, and B 577 from an <b>ovine</b> <b>abortion.</b> MAbs were tested for reactivity with each isolate by the indirect immunofluorescent antibody technique and for neutralization by an inclusion reduction neutralization technique in tissue culture. Two genus-specific and 14 serovar-specific MAbs were produced. Genus-specific MAbs reacted with all avian and mammalian isolates; however, each failed to neutralize its homologous chlamydial isolate. Turkey isolates NJ 1 and TT 3 were antigenically similar; serovar-specific MAbs produced to each reacted equally with both isolates yet showed {{little or no}} reaction with other serovars. Serovar-specific MAbs to the parakeet and abortion isolates were distinct; no cross-reactions were seen with other serovars. None of the serovar-specific MAbs reacted with an ovine arthritis isolate. Of the 14 serovar-specific MAbs, 13 partially neutralized homologous strains {{with or without the}} addition of complement. Because of the high specificity, the serovar-specific MAbs used with the immunofluorescence technique provided a rapid and precise method to identify three serovars of C. psittaci...|$|R
40|$|Neospora caninum and Toxoplasma gondii {{are closely}} related {{intracellular}} protozoan parasites associated with bovine and <b>ovine</b> <b>abortion</b> respectively. Little {{is known about the}} extent of Neospora/Toxoplasma co-infection in naturally infected populations of animals. Using nested PCR techniques, based on primers from the Nc 5 region of N. caninum and SAG 1 for T. gondii, the prevalence of N. caninum and its co-infection with T. gondii were investigated in populations of Mus domesticus, Rattus norvegicus and aborted lambs (Ovis aries). A low frequency of infection with N. caninum was detected in the Mus domesticus (3 %) and Rattus norvegicus (4 Â· 4 %) populations. A relatively high frequency of infection with N. caninum was detected in the brains of aborted lambs (18 Â· 9 %). There was no significant relationship between N. caninum and T. gondii co-infection. Investigation of the tissue distribution of Neospora, in aborted lambs, showed that Neospora could not be detected in tissues other than brain and this was in contrast to Toxoplasma where the parasite could be frequently detected in a range of tissues...|$|R
40|$|Polyclonal and {{monoclonal}} antibodies {{were used}} to study the immunogenic and antigenic characteristics of chlamydiae. We focused on the most predominant proteins in the outer membrane complex, the major outer membrane protein (MOMP) and the doublet consisting of proteins of 57 and 62 kilodaltons (57 - 62 kDa doublet). Immunoblot analyses were performed with chlamydial elementary bodies by using (i) immune sera from sheep which had undergone a recent episode of abortion due to the <b>ovine</b> <b>abortion</b> (OA) strain of C. psittaci, (ii) rabbit hyperimmune anti-C. psittaci (OA) and -C. trachomatis sera, and (iii) monoclonal antibodies to the MOMP of C. trachomatis. The typical pattern of response with polyclonal antisera against heterologous elementary bodies was reactivity with the 57 - 62 kDa doublet and lipopolysaccharide with weak and sometimes no anti-MOMP activity. Three distinct genus-specific anti-C. trachomatis MOMP monoclonal antibodies showed different patterns of reactivity with the MOMPs of the two immunotypes of C. psittaci and C. trachomatis serovars. Our data confirm the predominance of a genus-specific 57 - 62 kDa doublet response {{despite the presence of}} genus-specific epitopes on the MOMP...|$|R

O primeiro contÃªm as espÃ©cies C. trachomatis, C. suis e C. muridarum e o segundo as espÃ©cies C. abortus, C. pecorum, C. psittaci, C. felis, C. pneumoniae e C. caviae. Entre as espÃ©cies do gÃªnero Chlamydophila causadoras de doenÃ§a da esfera reprodutiva em animais de interesse econÃ´mico, a C. abortus tem sido descrita em vÃ¡rios paÃ­ses, como causa de abortamento, nascimento de animais prematuros e natimortalidade. A doenÃ§a causada pela C. abortus Ã© conhecida como aborto enzoÃ³tico ovino, aborto enzoÃ³tico caprino e pelo aborto epizoÃ³tico bovino, causando prejuÃ­zos econÃ´micos e problemas de saÃºde publica. A dificuldade em se realizar o diagnÃ³stico da clamidofilose tanto por isolamento, por provas de biologia molecular, como por provas sorolÃ³gicas, pode ser a causa da ausÃªncia de citaÃ§Ãµes da C. abortus em ovinos, no Brasil, atÃ© a presente data. O objetivo deste trabalho foi estimar a soroprevalÃªncia de anticorpos contra Chlamydophila em ovinos de propriedades localizadas em municÃ­pios da regiÃ£o de Londrina, Estado do ParanÃ¡. A prova de fixaÃ§Ã£o de complemento, recomendada pela OIE, foi realizada em 267 amostras de soro sanguÃ­neo de ovinos, provenientes de oito propriedades, sendo considerados positivos os animais que apresentaram tÃ­tulos > 32. Foram detectados 19 (7, 11 %) animais positivos, e sete (87, 50 %) propriedades tiveram pelo menos um animal positivo. Nestas propriedades, foram relatados sinais clÃ­nicos de abortamento, natimortalidade, nascimento de crias fracas e repetiÃ§Ã£o de cio. Dos 19 soros positivos, 17 (89, 50 %) apresentaram tÃ­tulos de 32, um (5, 30 %) apresentou tÃ­tulo de 64 e um (5, 30 %) apresentou tÃ­tulo de 128. Este resultado indica a presenÃ§a de anticorpos contra Chlamydophila nas propriedades estudadas. Bacteria {{from the}} family Chlamydiaceae are {{classified}} in genres Chlamydia and Chlamydophila. The former contains the species C. trachomatis, C. suis and C. muridarum and the latter, the species C. abortus, C. pecorum, C. psittaci, C. felis, C. pneumoniae and C. caviae. Among the species from genre Chlamydophila, which are known as the causers of reproductive diseases in animals of economic interests, C. abortus has been described in several countries {{as a cause of}} abortion, birth of premature animals and natimortality. The disease caused by C. abortus is known as <b>ovine</b> <b>enzootic</b> <b>abortion,</b> caprine enzootic abortion and as cattle epizootic abortion, causing great economic losses and public health problems. The difficulty in reaching a diagnosis of chlamydophilosis whether by isolation, by molecular biology tests, or by serological tests can be the cause for the lack of literature on C. abortus in ovines in Brazil until the present date. The aim {{of this paper is to}} estimate the seroprevalence of antibodies against Chlamydophila in ovines from farms in cities from the region of Londrina, in the state of Parana, Brazil. The complement fixation test, recommended by OIE, was performed in 267 samples from ovine sera samples collected from eight different properties. Animals presenting titers > 32 were considered positive. From the samples analyzed, a total of 19 animals (7. 11 %) were considered positive, and seven properties (87. 50 %) had at least one animal considered positive. In these properties, clinical symptoms of abortion, natimortality, birth of weak offsprings and repetition of estrus were reported. From the 19 sera samples considered positive, 17 (89. 50 %) presented titers of 32, one (5. 30 %) presented titer of 64 and one (5. 30 %) presented titer of 128. This result indicates the presence of antibodies against Chlamydophila in the properties analyzed in this study...|$|R
