50|$|River deltas {{form when}} a river {{carrying}} sediment reaches either (1) {{a body of}} water, such as a lake, ocean, or reservoir, (2) another river that cannot remove the sediment quickly enough to stop delta formation, or (3) an inland region where the water spreads out and deposits sediments. The tidal currents also cannot be too strong, as sediment would wash out into the water body faster than the river deposits it. Of course, the river must carry enough sediment to layer into deltas over time. The river's velocity decreases rapidly, causing it to deposit the majority, if not all, of its load. This alluvium builds up to form the river delta. When the flow enters the standing water, {{it is no longer}} confined to its channel and expands in width. This <b>flow</b> <b>expansion</b> results in a decrease in the flow velocity, which diminishes the ability of the flow to transport sediment. As a result, sediment drops out of the flow and deposits. Over time, this single channel builds a deltaic lobe (such as the bird's-foot of the Mississippi or Ural river deltas), pushing its mouth into the standing water. As the deltaic lobe advances, the gradient of the river channel becomes lower because the river channel is longer but has the same change in elevation (see slope).|$|E
40|$|Due {{to their}} simplicity, blade element {{momentum}} models, {{such as the}} double-multiple streamtube (DMS) model, {{are among the most}} common models to predict the performance of Darrieus vertical-axis wind turbines (VAWTs). A two-dimensional energy-based iteration scheme of the DMS model (EB-DMSM) is shown in the present work. Its purpose is to improve predictions of power performance and <b>flow</b> <b>expansion.</b> This new approach is compared with a momentum-based iteration scheme (MB-DMSM) and the results of a two-dimensional computational simulation of a 12 -kW straight-bladed VAWT. The mathematical representation of streamlines used for modeling the <b>flow</b> <b>expansion</b> is in good agreement with the simulations. Convergence of both schemes is achieved for tip-speed ratios (TSRs) up to 4. Failure of the models to convergence at higher TSRs is attributed to their inability to adequately represent the aerodynamic forces acting on the blades, due to the simplicity of their formulation. Relative to computational simulations, the maximum differences in the peak power coefficient predictions are 16 and 32 % and in the <b>flow</b> <b>expansion</b> predictions are 53 and 5 % for the MB-DMSM and EB-DMSM, respectively.

In these flows, the system rotation induces additional body forces, i. e. centrifugal and Coriolis forces, acting on the turbulent flow, so that the momentum mechanism becomes more complicated. The present doctoral thesis concerns the system rotation influence on turbulent shear flows. To this end, direct numerical simulations (DNSs) have been performed in order to investigate the effect of system rotation on different turbulent flow configurations including plane Couette <b>flow,</b> sudden <b>expansion</b> <b>flow</b> and wake behind a flat plate. In addition, the PIV measurements for rotating plane channel and sudden <b>expansion</b> <b>flows</b> have been carried out in order to support the numerical simulations results.

In awake rhesus monkeys, 4 MST neurons {{were considered to be}} activated antidromically if they emitted action potentials at fixed, short latencies after stimulation in the FPA and if the activation passed the collision test. Antidromically activated neurons (n = 37) and a sample of the overall population of MST neurons (n = 110) then were studied during pursuit eye movements across a dark background and during laminar motion of a large random-dot texture and optic <b>flow</b> <b>expansion</b> and contraction during fixation. Antidromically activated neurons showed direction tuning during pursuit (25 / 37), during laminar image motion (21 / 37), or both (16 / 37). Of 27 neurons tested with optic flow stimuli, 14 showed tuning for optic <b>flow</b> <b>expansion</b> (n = 10) or contraction (n = 4). There were no statistically significant differences in the response properties of the antidromically activated and control samples. Preferred directions for pursuit and laminar image motion did not show any statistically significant biases, and the preferred directions for eye versus image motion in each sample tended to be equally divided between aligned and opposed. There were small differences between the control and antidromically activated populations in preferred speeds for laminar motion and optic flow; these might have reached statistical significance with larger samples of antidromically activated neurons. We conclude that the population of MST neurons projecting to the FPA is highly diverse and quite similar to the general population of neurons in MST.

40|$|This thesis {{combines}} measurements {{with the}} development of simulation tools for vertical axis wind turbines (VAWT). Numerical models of aerodynamic blade forces are developed and validated against experiments. The studies were made on VAWTs which were operated at open sites. Significant progress within the modeling of aerodynamics of VAWTs has been achieved by the development of new simulation tools and by conducting experimental studies.          An existing dynamic stall model was investigated and further modified for the conditions of the VAWT operation. This model was coupled with a streamtube model and assessed against blade force measurements from a VAWT with curved blades, operated by Sandia National Laboratories. The comparison has shown that the accuracy of the streamtube model has been improved compared to its previous versions. The dynamic stall model was further modified by coupling it with a free vortex model. The new model has become less dependent on empirical constants and has shown an improved accuracy.      Unique blade force measurements on a 12 kW VAWT were conducted. The turbine was operated north of Uppsala. Load cells were used to measure the forces on the turbine. A comprehensive analysis of the measurement accuracy has been performed and the major error sources have been identified. The measured aerodynamic normal force has been presented and analyzed {{for a wide range of}} operational conditions including dynamic stall, nominal operation and the region of high <b>flow</b> <b>expansion.</b> The improved vortex model has been validated against the data from the new measurements.

The extreme limits of this problem are compared {{to those of the}} plane Poiseuille flow (α = 0 o) and the sudden <b>expansion</b> <b>flows</b> (α = 90 o). The base flow obtained by direct numerical simulations shows two picthfork type of bifurcations. At very low Reynolds numbers (Re) the flow is steady and symmetric with two symmetric separated regions at the walls. With an increase in Re the symmetric flow evolves into an asymmetric flow with separated regions of unequal lengths. The linear stability analysis on symmetric base flows confirms the primary instability to be a symmetry-breaking type thus leading to a picthfork bifurcation. With a further increase in Re the steady asymmetric flow develops into a base state with ‘tertiary’ separated region. The appearance of the tertiary separated region is a bifurcation of the flow, but is not related to an instability. The Re beyond which the tertiary flow develops is characterized for the various parameters and compared with literature for the sudden <b>expansion</b> <b>flows</b> (α = 90 o).
