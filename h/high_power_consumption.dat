25|$|The Intel Core {{microarchitecture}} (previously {{known as}} the Next-Generation Micro-Architecture) is a multi-core processor microarchitecture unveiled by Intel in Q1 2006. It {{is based on the}} Yonah processor design and can be considered an iteration of the P6 microarchitecture, introduced in 1995 with Pentium Pro. The <b>high</b> <b>power</b> <b>consumption</b> and heat intensity, the resulting inability to effectively increase clock speed, and other shortcomings such as the inefficient pipeline were the primary reasons for which Intel abandoned the NetBurst microarchitecture and switched to completely different architectural design, delivering high efficiency through a small pipeline rather than high clock speeds. The Core microarchitecture never reached the clock speeds of the Netburst microarchitecture, even after moving to 45nm lithography; however, after many generations of successor microarchitectures which are developed with the Core as the basis (such as Nehalem, Sandy Bridge and more) Intel managed to surpass the clock speeds of Netburst using the Devil's Canyon (Improved version of Haswell) microarchitecture which reached a base frequency of 4 GHz and a maximum tested frequency of 4.4 GHz using 22nm lithography and ultimately derives from the P6 microarchitecture through the Core microarchitecture and many other succeeding improvements.|$|E
500|$|The Sovereign used a Mostek MK50321N main {{integrated}} circuit, {{the same}} as the Sinclair Wrist Calculator and some variants of the Sinclair Cambridge. Clive Sinclair had assumed that people would prefer attractive illuminated LED displays to LCD displays, which incidentally also required more expensive CMOS chips. However, his calculators were designed with the assumption they would be turned off between calculations, which did not prove to be the case. Advertisements suggested that the batteries would last [...] "about a year" [...] under normal use, but in reality the small button cell batteries and comparatively <b>high</b> <b>power</b> <b>consumption</b> meant a short battery life compared to the competition.|$|E

500|$|Thermal drills, which cut ice by {{electrically}} {{heating the}} drill head, {{can also be}} used, but they have some disadvantages. [...] Some have been designed for working in cold ice; they have <b>high</b> <b>power</b> <b>consumption</b> and the heat they produce can degrade {{the quality of the}} retrieved ice core. [...] Early thermal drills, designed for use without drilling fluid, were limited in depth as a result; later versions were modified to work in fluid-filled holes but this slowed down trip times, and these drills retained the problems of the earlier models. [...] In addition, thermal drills are typically bulky and can be impractical to use in areas where there are logistical difficulties. [...] More recent modifications include the use of antifreeze, which eliminates the need for heating the drill assembly and hence reduces the power needs of the drill. Hot-water drills use jets of hot water at the drill head to melt the water around the core. The drawbacks are {{that it is difficult to}} accurately control the dimensions of the borehole, the core cannot easily be kept sterile, and the heat may cause thermal shock to the core.|$|E
2500|$|Phase {{noise is}} {{another type of}} jitter {{observed}} in PLLs, and {{is caused by the}} oscillator itself and by elements used in the oscillator's frequency control circuit.

2500|$|High-intensity {{discharge}} (HID) {{lights were}} the brightest lights available for bicycles until recently eclipsed by the advances in LED lights. [...] They are very efficient, very bright, but expensive. They {{also tend to}} have <b>high</b> <b>power</b> <b>consumption</b> (although they use less power than halogens for higher output), so a relatively limited burn time. Otherwise {{they have the same}} advantages and disadvantages as rechargeable halogen systems, and like halogen systems they are designed primarily for off-road use, having rotationally symmetrical beams which cast as much light up as down. [...] An additional disadvantage compared with halogen or LED lights is that the HID lamp does not tolerate repeated strikes, and in many cases does not relight immediately after shutting down. [...] Likewise, should the battery level fall too low, the lamp will shut down rather than dimming. [...] But the longer battery life than halogens tends to negate these problems, as many riders simply switch the light on and leave it running throughout the ride.|$|E

The <b>high</b> <b>power</b> <b>consumption</b> of Wi-Fi makes battery life in mobile devices a concern.|$|E
50|$|These {{benefits}} {{are at the}} cost of <b>high</b> <b>power</b> <b>consumption</b> and concomitant heat generation: minimal stereo power amplifier (Atma-Sphere S-30) continuously dissipates 400 watts, while practical low-impedance stereo setups approach 1 kilowatt, the power of a small electric heater.|$|E
50|$|The <b>high</b> <b>power</b> <b>consumption</b> of the calculators, {{which drew}} 40 mA when in operation, {{four times the}} {{recommended}} limit of the batteries, meant a short battery life.

50|$|Since {{these devices}} {{are used to}} run countless {{different}} types of programs, these CPU designs are not specifically targeted at one type of application or one function.

50|$|The <b>high</b> <b>power</b> <b>consumption</b> {{associated}} with ECL {{has meant that}} it has been used mainly when high speed is a vital requirement. Older high-end mainframe computers, such as the Enterprise System/9000 members of IBM's ESA/390 computer family, used ECL as did the Cray-1; and first generation Amdahl mainframes.
