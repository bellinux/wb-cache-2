Ramachandra Rao, the district collector for Nellore {{and the secretary of}} the Indian Mathematical Society. Rao was impressed by Ramanujan's research but doubted that it was his own work. Ramanujan mentioned a correspondence he had with Professor Saldhana, a notable Bombay mathematician, in which Saldhana expressed a lack of understanding of his work but concluded that he was not a phony. Ramanujan's friend C. V. Rajagopalachari tried to quell Rao's doubts about Ramanujan's academic integrity. Rao agreed to give him another chance, and listened as Ramanujan discussed elliptic integrals, hypergeometric series, and his theory of <b>divergent</b> <b>series,</b> which Rao said ultimately converted him to a belief in Ramanujan's brilliance. When Rao asked him what he wanted, Ramanujan replied that he needed work and financial support. Rao consented and sent him to Madras. He continued his research, with Rao's financial aid taking care of his daily needs. With Aiyer's help, Ramanujan had his work published in the Journal of the Indian Mathematical Society.|$|E
25|$|Before the 19th century, <b>divergent</b> <b>series</b> {{were widely}} used by Leonhard Euler and others, but often led to {{confusing}} and contradictory results. A major problem was Euler's idea that any <b>divergent</b> <b>series</b> {{should have a}} natural sum, without first defining {{what is meant by}} the sum of a <b>divergent</b> <b>series.</b> Augustin-Louis Cauchy eventually gave a rigorous definition of the sum of a (convergent) series, and for some time after this, <b>divergent</b> <b>series</b> were mostly excluded from mathematics. They reappeared in 1886 with Henri Poincaré's work on asymptotic series. In 1890, Ernesto Cesàro realized that one could give a rigorous definition of the sum of some <b>divergent</b> <b>series,</b> and defined Cesàro summation. (This was not the first use of Cesàro summation, which was used implicitly by Ferdinand Georg Frobenius in 1880; Cesàro's key contribution was not the discovery of this method, but his idea that one should give an explicit definition of the sum of a <b>divergent</b> <b>series.)</b> In the years after Cesàro's paper, several other mathematicians gave other definitions of the sum of a <b>divergent</b> <b>series,</b> although these are not always compatible: different definitions can give different answers for the sum of the same divergent series; so, when talking about the sum of a <b>divergent</b> <b>series,</b> it is necessary to specify which summation method one is using.|$|E

25|$|A summability method M is regular if it {{agrees with}} the actual limit on all {{convergent}} series. Such a result is called an Abelian theorem for M, from the prototypical Abel's theorem. More interesting, and in general more subtle, are partial converse results, called tauberian theorems, from a prototype proved by Alfred Tauber.
