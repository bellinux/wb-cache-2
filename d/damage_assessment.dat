5|$|In {{anticipation}} of Dean's significant damage, several emergency response groups gathered funds and readied personnel. On August 14 the Caribbean Disaster Emergency Response Agency (CDERA) placed its Regional Response Mechanism on standby and contacted the National Disaster Coordinators of {{all member states}} in the Lesser Antilles. On August 15 the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) dispatched teams to Barbados, Dominica, and St. Kitts {{in advance of the}} hurricane to provide <b>damage</b> <b>assessment</b> should the hurricane affect those islands. The Eastern Caribbean Donor Group convened a meeting on August 16 under the Chair of the Resident Representative United Nations Development Programme Barbados in anticipation that member states would require international assistance.|$|E

50|$|As Typhoon Bopha {{passed to}} the south of the island, power outages {{occurred}} across the island chain. Communication network disruptions delayed updates on <b>damage</b> <b>assessments</b> after the storm passed. Initial <b>damage</b> <b>assessments</b> in Koror indicated slight damage, with uprooted trees and power disruption. Outside of Koror, coastal villages were affected by strong winds and rain, which flooded outlying areas. Heavy rains flooded areas of Peleliu, and houses in Babeldaob were destroyed.|$|R
40|$|Remote-sensing {{information}} {{provides an}} effective {{basis for the}} rapid <b>assessment</b> of wind <b>damage.</b> The development of remote-sensing based assessments has received notable attention over the past decade, although automated algorithms have not yet achieved the speed, objectivity, and reliability desired for practical implementation in time-critical <b>damage</b> <b>assessments.</b> The current standard practice for making swift, objective, and widespread <b>assessments</b> of wind <b>damage</b> currently consists of rapid visual interpretation of first-available imagery. Techniques for rapidly accomplishing widespread <b>damage</b> <b>assessments</b> by visual inspection have been implemented in recent major tornado outbreaks in Birmingham-Tuscaloosa, Alabama and Joplin, Missouri (2011). Quickly emerging technologies, such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and laser scanners, are helping to improve both the speed and the accuracy of <b>damage</b> <b>assessments,</b> in particular for rapid and target-specific data collection at very high spatial resolutions. Applications of these emerging technologies following recent severe tornadoes at Pilger, Nebraska (2014) and Pampa, Texas (2015) have demonstrated their role in helping to refine strategies for making rapid semi-automated <b>damage</b> <b>assessments.</b> Algorithms for comparing before-and-after remote sensing imagery are also of great interest for the future development of automated damage detection. Current development activities are centered on high-resolution before-and-after aerial images of recent tornado damage...|$|R

5|$|There were problems. Inflated bomb <b>damage</b> <b>assessment</b> reports during {{operations}} in northeastern Laos were common, but {{the cause was}} not difficult to discern. Mountainous terrain, poor weather, ground cover, the lack of ground forces for confirmation, and the language barrier all contributed to overestimation of the damage inflicted on communist forces by the bombing effort. The result was a skewed sense of the effectiveness and {{the capabilities of the}} campaign. The results of the campaign (which were made obvious by the repeating seasonal nature of PAVN and Pathet Lao offensives), however, indicated that American airpower was quite effective.|$|E
5|$|Thirty-two <b>damage</b> <b>assessment</b> {{committees}} {{were installed}} to help estimate {{and analyze the}} cost of damage to public infrastructure. Subcommittees were established to help assess damage to schools, houses, and water supplies. Ten shelters were opened in both Chilpancingo and Acapulco. All survivors form the La Pintada mudslide were transported to a basketball gym in Acapulco, who were all provided with a $150USD pension.

5|$|The CIA <b>Damage</b> <b>Assessment</b> Team (DAT) {{reviewed}} {{the credibility of}} all of the Agency's Soviet agents from the mid-1980s onward, then separated them into three groups: those who Ames admitted to betraying but continued providing intelligence; those whom Ames was suspected of betraying and those whom Ames' spying may have helped the Soviets identify; and the agents whom neither Ames nor Moscow uncovered. The DAT thus deemed intelligence supplied by the first group suspicious, although investigators acknowledged that it may have included genuine material as feed. The debate over the second group's bona fides proved especially contentious, while the information from the third group of agents was considered credible despite some concerns that even they may have been compromised.|$|E
5|$|The FSM {{government}} {{estimated that}} residents on Fais and Ulithi would need food rations for 3–6 {{months following the}} typhoon. Debris removal at Chuuk International Airport allowed for flights to the state to resume on April1. Emergency assistance across the nation was hampered by the remote and small nature of the islands it comprises. In many instances, communities can only be reached by boat. Further complicating issues was {{the large number of}} trees uprooted or downed by the storm which blocked numerous roads. Generators had been supplied to Ulithi and Fais by April6, allowing for water pumps to be activated and supply clean water. Power and water supply was gradually restored, although many remained without power by two weeks after the storm. On April6, a United States Coast Guard helicopter provided an aerial assessment of the islands affected. <b>Damage</b> <b>assessment</b> was difficult due to the many sparse islands affected across open ocean. Relief supplies stockpiled by the Micronesian Red Cross were distributed {{in the immediate aftermath of}} Maysak; however, these supplies were exhausted by April8. On April14, the FSM government sent a patrol boat to Chuuk, delivering rice, ramen noodles, and water.|$|E
5|$|The National Hurricane Center {{consistently}} {{predicted that}} the storm would intensify and pass through the islands. As Hurricane Dean approached, the island nations began to prepare with a flurry of activity. On August 14 the Caribbean Disaster Emergency Response Agency (CDERA) placed its Regional Response Mechanism on standby and contacted the National Disaster Coordinators of all member states in the Lesser Antilles. On August 15 the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) dispatched teams to Barbados, Dominica, and St. Kitts {{in advance of the}} hurricane to provide <b>damage</b> <b>assessment</b> should the hurricane affect those islands. At 11p.m.AST August 15 (0300UTC August 16) the respective governments of St. Lucia, Martinique, Saba, St. Eustatius, and Guadeloupe and its dependencies issued Hurricane watches and the government of the Netherlands Antilles issued a tropical storm watch for the island of St. Maarten, as then-Tropical Storm Dean was expected to intensify to hurricane strength and reach the Windward Islands within 36hours. Authorities in Martinique canceled a memorial to the victims of West Caribbean Airways Flight 708 and began to set up shelters.|$|E
