500|$|The {{first two}} {{books in the}} Inheritance Cycle, Eragon and Eldest, sold over 15million copies {{worldwide}} together. Alfred A. Knopf Books for Young Readers, an imprint of Random House Children's Books and {{the publisher of the}} books, prepared Brisingrs release by printing 2.5million copies in advance, Random House's biggest initial print run of a children's book. Paolini said he tried not to let the expectations surrounding Brisingr affect him, stating that [...] "As an author, <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> can't really allow myself to think about those things. I actually fell into that trap with the first part of Brisingr. I sat there and I started obsessing about every single word." [...] He turned away from his computer and began writing on parchment paper instead. The pages were rewritten on a computer document afterwards by his mother.|$|E
500|$|At the 1963 {{convention}} of the newly formed East Coast Homophile Organizations, the audience heard a speaker named Dr. Albert Ellis tell them that [...] "the exclusive homosexual" [...] was a psychopath. Articles and essays in The Ladder sometimes carried these viewpoints, since {{it was difficult to}} get psychiatrists and doctors to address homosexuality in any form. Gittings said, [...] "People like Ellis talked about homosexuality being a sickness. And they talked about a cure...We'd sit there and listen and politely applaud and then go for the social hour afterward." [...] However, after Dr. Ellis spoke, so did gay activist Frank Kameny, making an impression upon Gittings with his point that it is useless to try to find cures and causes for homosexuality since there is no valid evidence that it is an illness. Said Gittings, [...] "My thinking didn't change until Frank Kameny came along and he said plainly and firmly and unequivocally that homosexuality is no kind of sickness or disease or disorder or malfunction, it is fully on par with heterosexuality...Suddenly <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was looking at things that had happened in the past in a very different light and I was taking a position that was increasingly diverging from DOB’s positions." ...|$|E

5000|$|Singer Russ Rankin later {{remarked that}} [...] "I think A Comprehensive Guide to Moderne Rebellion is {{important}} because <b>that's</b> when <b>I</b> <b>found</b> out <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was a song-writer ... it was where I realized like, 'Hey I guess I'm the song writer for this band.|$|R
6000|$|... "You will {{very soon}} {{find out whether}} I'm a fool or not! I mean it! Do you think I'd stay here one second after <b>I</b> <b>found</b> out <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was {{injuring}} you? At least I have enough sense of justice not to do that." ...|$|R
500|$|Pound taught Hemingway {{to write}} sparingly. Pound wrote {{to him that}} [...] "anything put {{on top of the}} subject is BAD... The subject is always {{interesting}} enough without blankets." [...] Hemingway would write in A Moveable Feast (published posthumously in 1964), [...] "If I started to write elaborately, like someone presenting or introducing something, <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> could cut that scrollwork or ornament out and throw it away and start with the first true simple declarative sentence I had written." [...] In Our Time was written during the author's experimentation phase, his first attempts towards a minimalist style. The prose in [...] "Indian Camp" [...] and [...] "Big Two-Hearted River" [...] is sharper and more abstract than in other stories, and by employing simple sentences and diction– techniques he learned writing for newspapers– the prose is timeless with an almost mythic quality, explains Benson. The tightly compressed sentence structure emulates and reflects Pound's imagist style, bringing to prose narrative the stripped-down style Pound famously established in 1913 with poems such as [...] "In a Station of the Metro". Thomas Strychacz compares Hemingway's prose to Pound's poetry, writing, [...] "Hemingway's terse, tight-lipped, tightly wound fragments are equally extraordinary in their dramatic intensity." ...|$|E
500|$|For Kilgrave, Maslansky used many suits {{created by}} {{designer}} Paul Smith, rather than custom-making {{them as she}} originally planned, as Smith [...] "was [...] about purple" [...] in the previous fashion season. On the suits, Maslansky added that the designers [...] "wanted {{to find a place}} where we could utilize clothing in shades of purple, but not go so over the top that it would look silly and that he would stop feeling ominous or menacing." [...] Expanding on this, Maslansky called purple a traditionally [...] "fairly friendly color, and he’s anything but friendly. So I had to find ways to make him be ominous and frightening and terrifying. <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> needed the right proportion of shades of purple to other shades that were similar: navy, black, maroon." [...] Maslansky felt Luke Cage was also someone [...] "who wears his clothing like an armor," [...] with his wardrobe consisting of T-shirts, jeans, leather jackets or an army jacket. For a character like Trish Walker, who does not {{have the same kind of}} [...] "statement costume" [...] as Jones, Maslansky tried to create a certain character style. Maslansky said that Walker's uniform is fashion, so [...] "even when she was hanging around the house, she was wearing a pair of rag & bone jeans with a Chloé top, and this was her version of a T-shirt and jeans." [...] Maslansky added that Robin was [...] "a blast to dress" [...] because of her [...] "quirky" [...] personality, yet she was still able to [...] "put herself together aesthetically." [...] For Malcolm, as his story progressively became brighter throughout the season, so did his wardrobe, becoming [...] "a little brighter and a little more hopeful." ...|$|E
2500|$|Similar to Mascis's guitar work, Barlow's bass lines, {{with their}} {{alternating}} heavily distorted, fast chords and pulverizing lows, draw heavily from both his hardcore past and musicians such as Lemmy from Motörhead and Johnny Ramone. [...] "Johnny Ramone is my hero. I {{wanted to make}} that rhythmic chugging sound like he got playing guitar with the Ramones. And, <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> got a bigger sound by strumming farther up the neck." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I did {{not manage}} quite so well as I {{ought to have}} done; for <b>I</b> <b>found,</b> afterwards, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had been {{suspected}} before we got to Chitral. Then Colonel Kelly took {{me out of the}} ranks and made me a temporary officer, and afterwards got a commission for me." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> soon <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had {{undertaken}} {{what was}} no easy task, for he required feeding {{so early in}} a morning <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was obliged to take him and his bread crumbs into my bedroom, and jump up to feed {{him as soon as}} he began to chirp, which he did in very good time.|$|R

2500|$|The book {{consumed}} Naipaul. [...] In 1983, he wrote:The book {{took three}} years to write. [...] It felt like a career; {{and there was a}} short period, {{towards the end of the}} writing, when I do believe I knew all or much of the book by heart. [...] The labour ended; the book began to recede. [...] And <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was unwilling to re-enter the world I had created, unwilling to expose myself again to the emotions that lay below the comedy. [...] I became nervous of the book. [...] I haven't read it since I passed the proofs in May 1961.|$|E
2500|$|In 1945, Sills {{made her}} {{professional}} stage debut with a Gilbert and Sullivan touring company produced by Jacob J. Shubert, playing twelve {{cities in the}} US and Canada, in seven different Gilbert and Sullivan operas. In her 1987 autobiography, she credits that tour with helping to develop the comic timing she soon became famous for: [...] "I played the title role in Patience, and I absolutely loved the character, because Patience is a very funny, flaky girl. ... I played her as a dumb Dora {{all the way through}} and really had fun with the role. ... My Patience grew clumsier and clumsier with each performance, and audiences seemed to like her. ... <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had a gift for slapstick humor, and it was fun to exercise it onstage." [...] Sills sang in light operas for several more years.|$|E

5000|$|John Manley: Former Member of Parliament {{and former}} Deputy Prime Minister under Jean Chrétien {{released}} an announcement saying [...] "I <b>found</b> <b>that</b> there was indeed {{water in the}} pool.... However, <b>I</b> truly <b>found</b> <b>that</b> {{in my mind and}} heart, I have moved on from the world of elected office. <b>I</b> also <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> lacked the burning ambition necessary to mount and sustain such a campaign." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You see," [...] Clementina resumed. [...] "He was the fust one, and I did ca'e {{for him a}} great deal; and I {{might have}} gone on caring for him, if--When <b>I</b> <b>found</b> out <b>that</b> <b>I</b> didn't care any longer, or so much, {{it seemed to me}} as if it must be wrong. Do you think it was?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Lindgren has reiterated {{his belief}} is [...] "Karma" [...] {{as a large}} factor in his running success. He claims that [...] "Karma comes from serving other people instead of serving yourself. <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> if <b>I</b> could serve others people without them knowing about it I could grow Karma faster," [...] and that this would lead to success on the track.|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{reason why}} I {{had to give}} up the fishing expedition," [...] he said, [...] "was, <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> could not depend upon your obeying me." ...|$|E
6000|$|Barker laughed. [...] "But listen. <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{could buy}} up their whole plant {{and all the}} {{ditching}} along the Black Spur Range for ten thousand dollars." ...|$|E
60|$|LADY UTTERWORD. So I thought, Mr Dunn. But I {{know now}} that it was only the last of my influenza. <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was not remembered and not wanted.|$|E
6000|$|... "My silence," [...] Wrayson said, [...] "was {{really an}} impulse. There {{have been times}} since when I have {{wondered}} whether I was wise. There are people now at work in London {{trying to solve the}} mystery of this murder. I acted upon the supposition that no one had seen your sister leave the flat except myself. <b>I</b> <b>found</b> afterwards <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was mistaken!" ...|$|R
6000|$|DON JUAN. Yes; {{but even}} my coxcombry pleased. Well, <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> when <b>I</b> had touched a woman's imagination, she {{would allow me}} to persuade myself that she loved me; but when my suit was granted she never said [...] "I am happy: my love is satisfied": she always said, first, [...] "At last, the {{barriers}} are down," [...] and second, [...] "When will you come again?" ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{possession}} of anything {{then became a}} troublesome thing and a burden. Exploring the cause of <b>that</b> joy, <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> if <b>I</b> kept anything as my own, I had to defend it against the whole world[...] [...] [...] And I said to myself: if people want it and would take it, they do so not from any malicious motive but [...] [...] because theirs was a greater need than mine.|$|R
60|$|Gradually <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was {{expected}} to keep it up. Others might speak sanely on business matters and the day's topics, but from me something gamesome and airy was required.|$|E
60|$|And {{that evening}} when I {{got back to}} the club and talked about it at dinner to my {{business}} friends, <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had only heard a small part of it.|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{was quite}} able to help, too. We raised Gambril up between us. He {{tried to help}} himself along like a man but {{all the time he}} was inquiring piteously: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am in charge, sir," [...] he said, [...] "of the {{investigations}} concerning {{the murder of}} Mr. Hamilton Fynes and Mr. Richard Vanderpole. The news of the reward came to us at Scotland Yard this morning. Its unusual amount led me to make some injuries at the Home Office. <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> what <b>I</b> partly expected was true. <b>I</b> <b>found,</b> sir, <b>that</b> your department has shown some interest in the apprehension of these two men." ...|$|R
60|$|It was a {{good while}} before they would feed; but {{throwing}} them some sweet corn, it tempted them, {{and they began to}} be tame: and now <b>I</b> <b>found,</b> <b>that</b> if <b>I</b> expected to supply myself with goat's flesh, when I had no powder or shot left, breeding some up tame was my only way, when perhaps I might have them about my house like a flock of sheep.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{liked them}} the more, {{because it was}} just like her last reading with us, and like that letter. Well, then I {{wondered}} as I lay on the grass at Groveswood, whether she would have thought it best for me to be reinstated, and <b>I</b> <b>found</b> out <b>that</b> <b>I</b> should have been rather afraid of what you might say when she had talked it over with you." ...|$|R
60|$|So {{they were}} laid on and I went away {{as hard as}} my legs would carry me. Very soon <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had left all those curly-tailed dogs a long way behind.|$|E
6000|$|... "Queer country this, isn't it?" [...] {{he remarked}} pleasantly. [...] "Do you know, I never heard you come in. It gave me quite a start when <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had a fellow-passenger." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{can tell}} you I was terrified myself when <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had to come fifteen miles across {{the country with a}} pair of old jades who could hardly get up a trot.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh no,' said Anne. 'I do {{not think}} it is--at least, I {{do not think}} Uncle Woodbourne would have liked the lecture we heard much better than Lizzie and I did; and after it was too late, <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> Helen had {{declared}} it was very wrong of us to go. She would not go; and <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> when <b>I</b> was out of the room, she and Lizzie had had a great debate about it.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So she was!" [...] exclaimed Ruth, {{with a look}} of triumph. <b>I</b> have <b>found</b> <b>that</b> out--only <b>I</b> fear <b>that</b> is not proof positive, because, you know, {{although}} not a common name, Bream is by no means singular.|$|R
5000|$|They {{made their}} way to San Francisco, where they knew no one, and with only $60 between them. With limited education, and now a {{stateless}} refugee, he did his best to make something of himself: [...] I came to this country feeling <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had capabilities and talents. I read a lot. I talked to people. I wanted to do things. <b>I</b> <b>found</b> out <b>that</b> <b>I</b> can cope reasonably well." ...|$|R
