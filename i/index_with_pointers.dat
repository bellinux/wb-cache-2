40|$|We {{propose a}} text {{indexing}} technique for approximate pattern matching, which is practical and especially aimed at Information Retrieval (IR). Unlike other indices of this kind, it {{is able to}} retrieve any string that approximately matches a given search pattern. Every sequence of a fixed length appearing in the text is stored in the <b>index,</b> together <b>with</b> <b>pointers</b> to all the positions where it appears. The search pattern is cut into pieces so that at least one must match exactly. All the pieces are searched in the index and the union of candidate positions is verified. To reduce space requirements, pointers to blocks instead of exact positions can be used, which increases querying costs. We design an algorithm to optimize the pattern partition into pieces so that the total number of verifications is minimized. This also allows to know in advance the expected cost of the search and the expected relevance of the query to the user. We show experimentally the build time, space requirements an [...] ...|$|R
40|$|We propose an {{indexing}} technique for approximate text searching, which is practical and powerful, and especially optimized for natural language text.

40|$|Abstract:- Textual {{substitution}} methods, {{often called}} dictionary methods or Lempel-Ziv methods, after the important work of Lempel and Ziv, are one-dimensional compression methods that maintain a constantly changing dictionary of strings to adaptively compress {{a stream of}} characters by replacing common substrings <b>with</b> <b>indices</b> (<b>pointers)</b> into a dictionary. Lempel and Ziv proved that the proposed schemes were practical as well as asymptotically optimal for a general source model. Two-dimensional (i. e. images) applications of textual substitution methods have been widely studied in the past. Those applications involve first {{the application of a}} linearization strategy to the input data, and then the encoding of the resulting mono-dimensional vector using LZ type one-dimensional methods. More recent strategies blend textual substitution methods with Vector Quantization. In this paper we discuss the textual substitution methods for image compression, with particular attention to the AVQ class of algorithms, and review recent advances in the field...|$|R
40|$|Large {{inverted}} {{indices are}} by now {{common in the}} construction of web-scale search engines. For faster access, inverted indices are indexed internally so {{that it is possible to}} skip quickly over unnecessary documents. The classical approach to skipping dictates that a skip should be positioned every √ f document pointers, where f is the overall number of documents where the term appears. We argue that due to the growing size of the web more refined techniques are necessary, and describe how to embed a compressed perfect skip list in an inverted list. We provide statistical models that explain the empirical distribution of the skip data we observe in our experiments, and use them to devise good compression techniques that allow us to limit the waste in space, so that the resulting data structure increases the overall index size by just a few percents, still making it possible to <b>index</b> <b>pointers</b> <b>with</b> a rather fine granularity. ...|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn {{this paper}} we {{introduce}} a new symbolic semantics for a class of recursive programs which feature dynamic creation and unbounded allocation of objects. We use a symbolic representation of the program state in terms of equations to model the semantics of a program as a pushdown system with a finite set of control states and a finite stack alphabet. Our main technical result is a rigorous proof of the equivalence between the concrete and the symbolic semantics. Adding pointer fields {{gives rise to a}} Turing complete language. However, assuming the number of reachable objects in the visible heap is bounded in all the computations of a program <b>with</b> <b>pointers,</b> we show how to construct a program without pointers that simulates it. Consequently, in the context of bounded visible heaps, programs <b>with</b> <b>pointers</b> are no more expressive than programs without them...|$|R
40|$|Program slicing, a {{technique}} to compute the subset of program statements that can affect {{the value of a}} program variable at a specific program point, is widely used in tools to support maintenance activities. To be useful for supporting these activities, a slicing technique must be sufficiently precise and efficient. Harrold and Ci propose a method for improving the efficiency of slicing by reusing slicing information for subsequent slicing. This paper presents an interprocedural slicing algorithm that improves the efficiency and precision of Harrold and Ci's algorithm for programs <b>with</b> <b>pointer</b> variables and recursion. Our empirical results show that our improvements can effectively achieve more reuse in slice computation, for programs <b>with</b> <b>pointers,</b> and can significantly reduce the sizes of slices, for programs with recursion.
