[...] Gedeon's cousin recalled: [...] "The last time I saw him, he told me, 'I had my accident. It's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>good</b> flying from now on.' He said he had used up his bad luck." [...] In February 1943, the Associated Press ran a feature story about Gedeon's war service under the headline: [...] "Gedeon Will Return to Baseball If War Doesn’t Last Too Long." [...] Gedeon {{was quoted in the}} article as saying [...] "he hopes to pick up after the war where he left off." [...] He added that [...] "it's a matter of time." [...] "If the war ends before I’m past the playing age I’ll return to the game. [...] If I’m too old, I’ll do something else." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hedberg {{occasionally}} added disclaimers {{to the end}} of a joke if it wasn't sufficiently well received, frequently {{variations on}} [...] "that joke's dumb, I'm aware of that." [...] During recordings for CDs, he would often say that he would find a way to edit a failed gag to make it seem well-received, for example by [...] "adding laughter" [...] to a failed joke containing arithmetic. Following such a failure on Strategic Grill Locations, Hedberg suggested, [...] "All right ... that joke is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>good</b> because I'm going to take all the words out and add new words. That joke will be fixed." ...|$|E
2500|$|Both Tom Brown's Schooldays and Harry Potter involve {{an average}} eleven-year-old, better at sport than {{academic}} study, who {{is sent to}} boarding school. Upon arrival, the boy gains a best friend (in Tom's case, East, in Harry's case, Ron Weasley) who helps him adjust to the new environment. They are set upon by an arrogant bully – in Tom Brown's case, Flashman, in Harry's case Draco Malfoy. Stephen Fry, who both narrates the British audio adaptations of the Harry Potter novels and has starred in a screen adaptation of Tom Brown, has commented many times about {{the similarities between the}} two books. [...] "Harry Potter – a boy who arrives in this strange school to board {{for the first time and}} makes good, solid friends and also enemies who use bullying and unfair tactics", notes Fry, [...] "then is ambiguous about whether or not he is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>good</b> or bad. His pluck and his endeavour, loyalty, good nature and bravery are the things that carry him through – and that is the story of Tom Brown's Schooldays".|$|E

2500|$|The role of Reverend Paul Coates {{was written}} with actor Arthur Darvill in mind, {{and was the}} first role cast. Darvill was offered a role in Broadchurch in April 2012 while filming [...] "The Angels Take Manhattan", his final {{appearance}} on Doctor Who. Darvill accepted without knowing what role he was to play or having read any scripts. Only later did Chibnall tell Darvill that the role was that of a young Anglican priest struggling with alcoholism. Darvill says that, as Chibnall wrote the scripts, he would call Darvill and tell him what he was thinking of doing with the character of Coates. Chibnall's writing of the character was, in a way, collaborative: [...] "We talked a lot about the role of a vicar in a community like that and {{what are the implications of}} the circumstances that the town is put in," [...] said Darvill, [...] "and what that means for someone in that position and certainly the responsibility of having to be a spiritual guide, a point of comfort, a figurehead, especially being quite young." [...] Darvill was very interested in the way Coates always felt he was in the public spotlight (even in a private setting) and the burden that Coates felt in being a moral guide and trustworthy person. Darvill was also intrigued by the way Coates struggled to avoid letting his ego come into play once he became a spokesperson for the community, and the way Coates reacted when he became a police suspect. Darvill was also pleased that Chibnall said he would not permit any bad attitudes or diva-like behavior on the set. [...] "Early on I knew it was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>good</b> because Chris said...veryone has to be nice and good." ...|$|E

6000|$|Fairway replied, and the waxing {{went on with}} {{unabated}} vigour. [...] "'Tis <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a <b>good</b> bed, by {{the look}} o't," [...] continued Sam, after an interval of silence. [...] "Who may it be for?" ...|$|R

6000|$|Leland nodded, {{though there}} <b>was</b> light enough <b>to</b> show the curious {{look in his}} eyes. [...] "Well," [...] he said, [...] "that ought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> excuse enough for me, and it's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a <b>good</b> deal colder presently." ...|$|R

5000|$|In July 2010, Patterson {{performed}} {{again at}} the Just for Laughs comedy festival in Montreal on a Gala hosted by Steve Martin. Following his performance, Martin said [...] "If I knew he <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> THAT <b>good,</b> I would have canceled him." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Then I {{know we are}} <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>good</b> friends," [...] replied Piny. As he {{said this}} he turned and Peter noticed that his tail was {{distinctly}} forked instead of being square across like that of Welcome Robin. Piny whistled, and almost at once he was joined by another bird who in shape was just like him, but who was dressed in slaty-gray and olive-yellow, instead of the bright red that he himself wore. Piny introduced the newcomer as Mrs. Grosbeak.|$|E
