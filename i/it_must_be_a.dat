If a kickoff is chosen <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> place kick, and the ball can be held, placed on the ground, or placed on a tee prior to the kick. As in American football, the ball must go at least ten yards before it can be recovered by the kicking team.|$|E
5|$|The Shangani Patrol {{continued}} its approach {{during the late}} evening, and scouted close to the bush enclosure housing Lobengula. Captain William Napier repeatedly called to the king in the Matabele language, Sindebele, but received no reply from the Matabele leaders, who remained silent and hid themselves. The patrol's actions confused the Matabele, who could not understand why {{there appeared to be}} so few Company soldiers, nor why they would reveal their position like this. They concluded that <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> trap, and were only satisfied that it was not when Wilson's men had stopped during their approach to call to Lobengula five times. Following the fifth call from Napier, Mjaan ordered his riflemen to gather around the patrol, intending to pocket it. Noticing this, Wilson ordered a retreat, and took up a well-covered position in the bush where he could hide until daybreak. When Lieutenant Hofmeyer and Troopers Bradburn and Colquhoun were lost amid the increasingly stormy night, Wilson briefly backtracked to recover them.|$|E

25|$|The Heavenly Doctrine {{rejects the}} concept of {{salvation}} through faith-alone (sola-fide in Latin), since he considered both faith and charity necessary for salvation, not one without the other, whereas the Reformers taught that faith-alone procured justification, although <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> faith which resulted in obedience. The purpose of faith, according to The Heavenly Doctrine, is to lead a person to a life according to the truths of faith, which is charity, as is taught in 1 Corinthians 13:13 and James 2:20.|$|E
25|$|On {{the morning}} of Friday, 10 May, Germany invaded the Netherlands and Belgium. Chamberlain {{initially}} felt that a change of government {{at such a time}} would be inappropriate, but upon being given confirmation that Labour would not serve under him, he announced to the War Cabinet his intention to resign. Scarcely more than three days after he had opened the debate, Chamberlain went to Buckingham Palace to resign as Prime Minister. (Despite resigning as PM, he continued to be the leader of the Conservative Party.) He explained to the King why Halifax (who, the King thought, was the obvious candidate) did not want to become Prime Minister. The King then sent for Churchill and asked him to form a new government; according to Churchill, there was no stipulation that <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> coalition government.|$|E

25|$|Another {{version of}} {{formalism}} is often known as deductivism. In deductivism, the Pythagorean theorem {{is not an}} absolute truth, but a relative one: if one assigns meaning to the strings {{in such a way}} that the rules of the game become true (i.e., true statements are assigned to the axioms and the rules of inference are truth-preserving), then one must accept the theorem, or, rather, the interpretation one has given <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> true statement. The same is held to be true for all other mathematical statements. Thus, formalism need not mean that mathematics is nothing more than a meaningless symbolic game. It is usually hoped that there exists some interpretation in which the rules of the game hold. (Compare this position to structuralism.) But it does allow the working mathematician to continue in his or her work and leave such problems to the philosopher or scientist. Many formalists would say that in practice, the axiom systems to be studied will be suggested by the demands of science or other areas of mathematics.|$|E

500|$|Many {{waveguide}} filter components work {{by introducing}} a sudden change, a discontinuity, to the transmission {{properties of the}} waveguide. [...] Such discontinuities are equivalent to lumped impedance elements placed at that point. [...] This arises in the following way: the discontinuity causes a partial reflection of the transmitted wave back down the guide in the opposite direction, {{the ratio of the}} two being known as the reflection coefficient. [...] This is entirely analogous to a reflection on a transmission line where there is an established relationship between reflection coefficient and the impedance that caused the reflection. [...] This impedance must be reactive, that is, <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> capacitance or an inductance. [...] It cannot be a resistance since no energy has been absorbed—it is all either transmitted onward or reflected. [...] Examples of components with this function include irises, stubs, and posts, all described later in this article under the filter types in which they occur.|$|E

500|$|Gilroy {{conceived}} {{the idea for}} Nightcrawler in 1988, after reading the photo-book Naked City, a collection of photographs taken by American photographer Weegee of 1940s New York City residents at night. Often lewd and sensationalized in content, Weegee would sell these photos to tabloid newspapers. Intrigued by {{what he described as}} [...] "an amazing intersection of art and crime and commerce", Gilroy wrote a film treatment with a [...] "Chinatown feel". However, when The Public Eye (1992) was released, a film loosely based on Weegee's life, Gilroy shelved the idea. Two years later, he moved to Los Angeles, and noted the predominance of violent crime stories on local news stations. [...] "I suddenly became aware of and intrigued by the idea that <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> powerful force for a TV station, when they realize their ratings go through the roof when they show something with the potential for violence, like a police chase", says Gilroy. Sometime later, he discovered the stringer profession, and considered it to be the modern day equivalent of Weegee. Unaware of any film that focused on the livelihood of stringers, he began writing a screenplay.|$|E

She calls the number, pretends to be the Jamaican dental receptionist, and asks the man {{to come back to}} see Dr. Kaplan. At the appointed time, she returns to the dentist's office, but does not recognize anyone there; so she calls the number again. When the man (Michael Sheen) answers, she sees him and hangs up. Unbeknownst to Liz, her number is already listed in his cellphone under [...] "future wife". He calls her back upon seeing she called, and they arrange a date; she learns that his name is Wesley. On their date, the two fail to hit it off: they find each other annoying and share many flaws but few interests. Later, at the 30 Rock studios, Liz discovers that Wesley was the person who retrieved NBC page Kenneth Parcell's (Jack McBrayer) wallet, after Kenneth threw it out of a window earlier. Because of this coincidence, Liz and Wesley decide to go on another date.|$|E
