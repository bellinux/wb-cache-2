50|$|An <b>honorary</b> <b>trust,</b> {{under the}} law of trusts, is a device by which a person {{establishes}} a trust {{for which there is}} neither a charitable purpose, nor a private beneficiary to enforce the trust. While such a trust would normally be void for lack of a beneficiary, many jurisdictions have carved out two specific exceptions to this rule: trusts for the care of that person's pets; and trusts to provide for the maintenance of cemetery plots.|$|E

5000|$|The National Children’s Centre (NCC) was {{established}} in Huddersfield in 1975 by the National Educational Research and Development Trust (NERDT). The Trust had been founded by Brian Jackson, co-author with Dennis Marsden of the groundbreaking book, Education and the Working Classes. The <b>Trust's</b> <b>Honorary</b> Vice Presidents were The RH Keith Joseph, MP and Lord Sainsbury. One of the Trustess was Dennis Healey MP. The NCC {{was established}} to be [...] "a Multidisciplinary Centre - deliberately based outside London - where work on improving all aspects of childhood could be pursued. Sometimes {{this was to be}} through research, sometimes through innovative action, sometimes by informing the media or by discussing progress with politicians, administrators, or members of the many professions that touch on the field." [...] Brian and NERDT enlisted the expertise of Hazel Wigmore, as Director (from setting up to 2001), and two other teachers who were trained with her at the then Huddersfield Polytechnic, John Cashman and Raymond Ball. Brian Jackson was a man of great energy who worked relentlessly to further various causes connected with the education and welfare of children. His imaginative and innovative ideas, combined with Hazel Wigmore's relentless energy and organisational skills,enabled the setting up of unusual practical schemes and research projects, the findings of which were disseminated nationally and internationally. The first home of the National Children's Centre was in Huddersfield at Longroyd Bridge, in a 1940s building (now listed) which straddles the river on long legs and was adjacent to a bus depot and workshop.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{illustrates}} how love, legality, money, sex(uality) and sin direct Malays’ marital {{strategies in the}} face of various social, moral, religious and structural pressures. Passionate love (cinta) is cherished and celebrated by Malays – that is, if it is indulged within marriage. Marriage serves as a license to engage in (otherwise illicit) sexual desires by rendering them “halal” or lawful in the eyes of Islam and Malay adat (traditions). A vigilant State-led Islamic Bureaucracy, which polices and punishes pre- or extramarital sexual liaisons between unmarried couples through strict moral surveillance, further ensures that access to physical intimacy remains a conjugal privilege. However, hindered by complex bureaucratic procedures for marriage and pressured by escalating passions, many of my Malay informants are compelled to seek cheaper, quicker, and discreet alternatives in neighboring Southern Thailand to “halal-ize” pre- or extramarital romances, resulting in secret – and legally contentious – monogamous or polygamous cross-border marriages. Cross-border marriages – specifically polygamous ones – are subsequently explored here as a careful (and often failed) negotiation between discretion and disclosure: their stability decreases with increased exposure, rendering them highly precarious. Contrary to the dominant male-centric scholarship on polygamy, this study privileges the perspectives and experiences of polygamous wives by considering how their position within the marriage informs their capacity to engage in – or conversely, disengage from – this multi-marital arrangement. Polygamy is embraced by some women as a female choice that secures access to marriage and motherhood – both crucial towards achieving Malay womanhood. For others, polygamy is hardly a “choice” at all, and they must cope with the discomforting reality in which the husband’s money, time, and attention are now “halved” between his wives. Love in polygamy is experienced in visible and measurable terms, and the husband’s unequal distribution of his emotional and economic resources create discontent among wives that may culminate in divorce, or covertly confronted through sorcery. In Malay polygamy, more therefore means less. William Wyse Fund, Cambridge Commonwealth <b>Trust</b> (<b>Honorary</b> Scholar), the DayaDiri Foundatio...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{provides}} {{an analysis of}} the complex relationship between law and legitimacy in the WTO. It focuses on the notional dichotomy between ‘Member-driven’ (input-based) and ‘results-oriented’ (output-based) narratives of the WTO’s legitimacy, and how such narratives are both framed by, and reflected in, WTO law. It demonstrates how these narratives are used to legitimate the exercise of legal power in ways that exceed the reach of their internal normative claims; how they are used to displace responsibility for decision-making in the WTO; and the consequences of choosing to emphasize particular forms of legitimacy for our understandings of the WTO’s place in the world. In the process, the thesis also seeks to destabilize these legitimacy narratives by highlighting their partial, contingent and often mutually contradictory natures. The thesis proceeds in three parts. The first part (Chapter Two) clarifies what is meant by the terms ‘power’ and ‘legitimacy’ as used in the thesis and stresses their significance for WTO law. The second part (Chapters Three and Four) addresses two key input-oriented narratives of legitimacy associated with WTO law — those of consent and democracy. It argues that although consent has been central to understanding the legitimacy of WTO law as it is, and democracy is increasingly advanced in relation to WTO law as it should be, both narratives suffer from serious normative and descriptive limitations. The third part delves further into the concept of output legitimacy and its limits (Chapter Five), before exploring its application in relation to the legal-institutional dynamics of WTO negotiation rounds (Chapter Six) and the treatment of economic evidence in WTO dispute settlement (Chapter Seven). This part ultimately concludes that a more critical engagement with the concept of output legitimacy could open up productive avenues for rethinking the law and practice of the WTO.
