25|$|Working {{extended}} <b>hours</b> <b>or</b> <b>overnight</b> shifts also {{poses the}} added difficulty of requiring performance {{from an individual}} at a time with the body is driven to sleep by the circadian system. Sleep, alertness, and cognitive functioning {{are determined by the}} interaction of two processes: the endogenous circadian pacemaker and the homeostatic drive for sleep. The endogenous circadian pacemaker generates the 24-hour circadian rhythm that regulates subjective alertness and sleep propensity as well as core body temperature, cognitive functions, and melatonin secretion, as described above. It is also highly sensitive to light, which is its primary synchronization. Misalignment of the circadian rhythm results in disturbed sleep, impaired performance alertness, waking-hour melatonin secretion, and reduced levels of nocturnal secretion of growth hormone. The outcome, therefore, can range from performance error to long-term health decrements.|$|E
2500|$|To fulfil this role, Crawley needed {{plenty of}} venues to {{entertain}} guests {{for a few}} <b>hours</b> <b>or</b> <b>overnight,</b> with rooms to accommodate overnight stops and facilities for changing teams of horses. Several medieval buildings on the High Street, such as the George Hotel, the Ancient Priors and the Old Punch Bowl, met this need to some extent, but none were built for that purpose: all had been adapted from existing structures with different uses. The Ancient Priors was built as {{a house with a}} small agricultural plot; the Old Punch Bowl had been a large farmhouse; and although the George had always been an inn, it expanded gradually and haphazardly across several neighbouring buildings. The Ancient Priors in particular was too small to meet the demand for its facilities. In 1753—at which point it was operating under the name The White Hart—it was sold, and soon afterwards became a farm. The proceeds were used to build a new White Hart Inn. A site [...] further north on the High Street was selected; this was large enough to provide both a bigger building and a substantial area at the rear for the stabling of horses. Most sources agree that the new White Hart Inn opened in 1770, although some identify 1790 as the date. Architectural studies made in 1995 and 2003 attributed a date of around 1600 to {{the southern part of the}} building, suggesting that the inn was built around the core of an older structure.|$|E

Some recipes require the meat to be marinated in a vinegar solution (grape vinegar is traditional but balsamic and cider also work very well) for a few hours, then the vinegar is poured off before the meat is flavoured with salt and spices. The spice mix is sprinkled liberally over the meat and rubbed in. Saltpetre is optional and can be added as an extra preservative (necessary only for wet biltong {{that is not going}} to be frozen). The meat should then be left for a further few <b>hours</b> (<b>or</b> refrigerated <b>overnight)</b> and any excess liquid poured off before the meat is hung in the dryer.|$|R
40|$|Preeclampsia is {{associated}} with widespread maternal vascular dysfunction, which {{is thought to be}} mediated by circulating factor(s). The aim {{of the study was to}} characterize vascular function in the reduced uterine perfusion pressure (RUPP) rat model of preeclampsia and to investigate the role of plasma factors in mediating any observed changes in vascular reactivity. Mean arterial blood pressure and vascular function were measured in RUPP and control rats. Mesenteric vessels from both virgin and pregnant rats were exposed for 1 <b>hour</b> <b>or</b> <b>overnight</b> to plasma from both RUPP and control rats and their vascular function assessed. RUPP rats were characterized by severe hypertension, restricted fetal growth, and reduced placental weight (P< 0. 001). Vasorelaxation was impaired in resistance vessels from RUPP compared with control rats (acetylcholine: R(max) 70 +/- 3 versus 92 +/- 1 [NP] and 93 +/- 3 % [sham], P< 0. 01; bradykinin: 40 +/- 2 versus 62 +/- 2 [NP] and 59 +/- 4 % [sham], P< 0. 001). Incubation of vessels from pregnant (but not virgin) animals with RUPP plasma overnight resulted in an attenuation of vasorelaxant responses (acetylcholine: 63 +/- 7 versus 86 +/- 2 %, P< 0. 05; bradykinin: 35 +/- 5 versus 55 +/- 6 %, P< 0. 001). The residual relaxant response in RUPP plasma-treated vessels was not further attenuated after treatment with N(omega) -nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (acetylcholine: 57 +/- 7 versus 63 +/- 7 %, ns; bradykinin: 37 +/- 5 versus 35 +/- 5 %, ns). The RUPP rat model is characterized by an impaired response to vasodilators which may be attributable to one or more circulating factors. This plasma-mediated endothelial dysfunction appears to be a pregnancy-dependent effect. Furthermore, nitric oxide-mediated vasorelaxation appears to be absent in RUPP plasma-treated vessels...|$|R

5000|$|... in {{countries}} like India and Nepal, the price of fuel is set by the government, and {{it is illegal to}} sell the fuel over the set price. Due to the petrol crisis in Nepal, black marketing in fuel has been a common trend, especially during mass petrol shortage. At times, people need to queue for <b>hours</b> <b>or</b> even sometimes <b>overnight</b> to get the fuel. On the other hand, the petrol pump operators are alleged to hoarding the fuel, and selling it to black marketers. Black marketing in vehicle/cooking fuel became widespread during the 2015 economic blockade imposed on Nepal. Even after the economic blockade was eased, and petrol imports resumed, people are not getting the fuel as they were supposed to and are resort to buying from the black market.|$|R
50|$|Henna paste {{is usually}} applied {{on the skin}} using a plastic cone, a paint brush or a stick. After about 15-20 minutes, the mud will dry and begin to crack, and during this time, a mixture of lemon juice and white sugar can be applied over the henna design to remoisten the henna mud so that the henna will stain darker. The painted area is then wrapped with tissue, plastic, or medical tape to lock in body heat, {{creating}} a more intense colour on the skin. The wrap (not a traditional method), is worn for two to six <b>hours,</b> <b>or</b> sometimes <b>overnight,</b> and then removed. When first removed, the henna design is pale to dark orange in colour and gradually darkens through oxidation, {{over the course of}} 24 to 72 hours. The final color is reddish brown and can last anywhere from one to three weeks depending on the quality and type of henna paste applied, as well as where it was applied on the body (thicker skin stains darker and longer than thin skin). Moisturizing with natural oils, such as olive, sesame seed, or coconut, will also help extend the lifetime of the stain. Skin exfoliation causes the henna tattoo to fade.|$|R
50|$|Filderkraut is {{a special}} kind of Sauerkraut which is not {{prepared}} from ordinary white cabbage but from pointed cabbage which is grown on the Fildern Plains near Stuttgart.The Swabian potato salad is also very famous in Germany and even in other countries. In contrast to the mayonnaise-dressed potato salad in Northern Germany, it is lighter and contains less fat. Waxy potatoes are cooked and peeled when they are still hot. Then they are sliced and mixed with diced onions before they are poured over with warm broth, vinegar and oil (great emphasis is laid {{on the fact that the}} liquid components are not mixed before being poured over the potatoes although the chronological order may vary from recipe to recipe). Optional they can be garnished with chive, diced pickles or spiced with mustard.The salad should rest for a few <b>hours</b> <b>or</b> even <b>overnight</b> before serving and can then be enjoyed as accompaniment for different dishes or solely with bread.Of course there are many recipe variations differing in tiny details: the choice of the potato breed, the temperature for peeling, the thickness of the slices and the way of slicing, the amount and addition order of the liquid component, the amount and kind of spices. Naturally most Swabians are convinced that the potato salad of their mother is the very best and only true one.|$|R
50|$|Ambrosia is a {{variation}} on the traditional fruit salad. Most ambrosia recipes contain fresh or sweetened pineapple, mandarin oranges or fresh orange sections, miniature marshmallows, and coconut. Other ingredients can include maraschino cherries, bananas, strawberries, peeled grapes, or crushed pecans. Ambrosia can also include whipped cream (or whipped topping), sour cream, cream cheese, pudding, yogurt, or cottage cheese. The mixture is refrigerated for a few <b>hours</b> <b>or</b> <b>overnight</b> before serving. Although the name references the food of Greek gods, it is widely believed to be an American dish originated in the late 19th century.|$|E
50|$|Corruption and {{impunity}} {{were also}} serious {{problems in the}} police force in 2011, and the government rarely held security officials accountable or prosecuted them for abuses.

There were numerous reports that police arbitrarily detained individuals for several <b>hours</b> <b>or</b> <b>overnight</b> at roadblocks in Nouakchott or other towns. According to these reports, police detained motorists or passengers without asking for identity papers or vehicle registration, and without searching the vehicles. Judicial corruption was also a problem.|$|E
50|$|Kongbap is a Korean dish {{consisting}} of white or brown rice cooked together {{with one or}} more beans (and sometimes also other grains). Kongbap may be made from scratch by combining and cooking together dried rice and beans, although it is also commercially available premixed packages in dried form in grocery stores throughout Korea, as well as in Korean grocery stores in other nations. Although the exact mixture may vary, typical ingredients include short-grain brown rice, green peas, azuki beans, black soybeans, Job's tears, black glutinous rice, barley, and sorghum. Another typical mixture consists only of white rice and green peas. The dried kongbap mixture is generally soaked in water for several <b>hours</b> <b>or</b> <b>overnight</b> before cooking, in order to ease the softening process of the beans while cooking.|$|E
30|$|Pulque is a {{traditional}} Mexican, non-distilled alcoholic fermented beverage currently produced and consumed mainly in the Central Mexico Plateau. It is obtained from the fermentation of a fresh sap, known as aguamiel, which is extracted from several maguey (Agave) species, such as Agave atrovensis and A. americana. The production of this traditional beverage requires for the freshly collected aguamiel to be deposited in large open containers where previously fermented pulque acts as seed for a new batch. Fermentation time varies from a few <b>hours,</b> <b>overnight,</b> <b>or</b> even for several days. Fermented pulque is gradually retired from the container but always leaving a residual volume of the fermented beverage {{to start a new}} fermentation. The viscosity resultant from EPS synthesis and the alcohol content of the beverage are the main parameters used {{to determine the extent of}} fermentation as they define its distinctive sensorial properties (Escalante et al. 2008; Escalante et al. 2012).|$|R

50|$|VideoGuard {{is unusual}} in that {{legitimate}} external conditional-access modules are not available, the encryption system instead being built into the hardware and firmware of platform-supplied set-top boxes. However, several groups have managed to reverse-engineer VideoGuard {{to the point where}} a legitimate subscriber's card can be utilised in third-party receivers to decrypt those channels which that subscriber is authorised to view. A software CAM emulator exists for the Dreambox & Triple-Dragon Linux-powered satellite receivers, along with the Diablo, Dragon, Giga-Blue and T-Rex conditional-access modules. Some of the reverse-engineered solutions are unable to update the card, meaning the legitimate card needs to be returned to official Sky receiver for a few <b>hours</b> (<b>or</b> <b>overnight)</b> to be refreshed, or programmes will no longer decrypt. An example of a reverse-engineered solution that does support card updates is NDSCam.|$|E

5000|$|To make Idli, four parts {{uncooked}} rice (Idli rice or parboiled rice) to {{one part}} whole white lentil (urad dal, Vigna mungo) are soaked separately {{for at least}} four hours to six <b>hours</b> <b>or</b> <b>overnight.</b> Optionally spices such as fenugreek seeds can be added at the time of soaking for additional flavor. Once done soaking, the lentils are ground to a fine paste and the rice is separately coarsely ground, then they are combined. Next, the mixture is left to ferment overnight during which its volume will more than double. After fermentation some of the batter may be kept as a starter culture for the next batch. The finished idli batter is put into greased moulds of an idli tray or [...] "tree" [...] for steaming. The perforated molds allow the idlis to be cooked evenly. The tree holds the trays above the level of boiling water in a pot, and the pot is covered until the idlis are done (about 10-25 minutes, depending on size). A more traditional method is to use leaves instead of molds.|$|E

50|$|Thermal storage {{technologies}} allow heat or cold to {{be stored}} for periods of time ranging from <b>hours</b> <b>or</b> <b>overnight</b> to interseasonal, and can involve storage of sensible energy (i.e. by changing the temperature of a medium) or latent energy (i.e. through phase changes of a medium, such between water and slush or ice). Short-term thermal storages {{can be used for}} peak-shaving in district heating or electrical distribution systems. Kinds of renewable or alternative energy sources that can be enabled include natural energy (e.g. collected via solar-thermal collectors, or dry cooling towers used to collect winter's cold), waste energy (e.g. from HVAC equipment, industrial processes or power plants), or surplus energy (e.g. as seasonally from hydropower projects or intermittently from wind farms). The Drake Landing Solar Community (Alberta, Canada) is illustrative. borehole thermal energy storage allows the community to get 97% of its year-round heat from solar collectors on the garage roofs, which most of the heat collected in summer. Types of storages for sensible energy include insulated tanks, borehole clusters in substrates ranging from gravel to bedrock, deep aquifers, or shallow lined pits that are insulated on top. Some types of storage are capable of storing heat or cold between opposing seasons (particularly if very large), and some storage applications require inclusion of a heat pump. Latent heat is typically stored in ice tanks or what are called phase-change materials (PCMs).|$|E
