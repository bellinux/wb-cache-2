50|$|On their way, {{they stop}} at an {{abandoned}} {{factory in the}} French countryside to rest and refill their supplies. While they eat, the upper floor of the building collapses, and a German soldier appears from between the <b>hay</b> <b>bundles.</b> Captured by Yeager's group, he tells them {{that he is in}} fact an escaped prisoner sentenced to death just like them. Although Tony and Fred want to kill him, Yeager prefers to take him along in case the Nazis attack again.|$|R
60|$|It {{was a long}} barn indeed. Rollo {{thought he}} had never seen so large a building. On each side was a long range of stalls for cattle, facing towards the middle, and great {{scaffolds}} overhead, partly filled with <b>hay</b> and with <b>bundles</b> of straw. They walked down the barn floor, and in one place Rollo passed a large bull chained by the nose in one of the stalls. The bull uttered a sort of low growl or roar, as Rollo and his father passed, which made him a little afraid; but his attention was soon attracted to some hens, a little farther along, which were standing {{on the edge of the}} scaffolding over his head, and cackling with noise enough to fill the whole barn.|$|R
60|$|As soon as {{the firing}} commenced, the {{detachment}} under General Thomas set out on its cautious and secret march from the lines of Roxbury and Dorchester. Everything was conducted as regularly and quietly as possible. A covering party of eight hundred men preceded the carts with the intrenching tools; then came General Thomas with the working party, twelve hundred strong, followed by a train of three hundred wagons, laden with fascines, gabions, and <b>hay</b> screwed into <b>bundles</b> of seven or eight hundred weight. A great number of such bundles were ranged in a line along Dorchester Neck on the side next the enemy, to protect the troops, while passing, from being raked by the fire of the enemy. Fortunately, although the moon, as Washington writes, was shining in its full lustre, the flash and roar of cannonry from opposite points, and the bursting of bombshells high in the air, so engaged and diverted {{the attention of the}} enemy, that the detachment reached the heights about eight o'clock without being heard or perceived. The covering party then divided; one half proceeded to the point nearest Boston, the other to the one nearest to Castle Williams. The working party commenced to fortify, under the directions of Gridley, the veteran engineer, who had planned the works on Bunker's Hill. It was severe labor, for the earth was frozen eighteen inches deep; but the men worked with more than their usual spirit; for the eye of the commander-in-chief was upon them. Though not called there by his duties, Washington could not be absent from this eventful operation.|$|R
