5|$|The {{original}} Sera Monastery is {{a complex}} of structures founded in 1419 by Jamchen Chojey Sakya Yeshe of Zel Gungtang (1355–1435), a disciple of Je Tsongkhapa. Prior to establishing this monastery, Tsongkhapa, assisted by his disciples, <b>had</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> hermitages at higher elevations above Sera Utsé Hermitage.|$|E
5|$|Andretti had {{continued}} to race, and occasionally win, in the USAC National Championship during {{his time in the}} Formula One world championship. In 1979 a new organization, Championship Auto Racing Teams, <b>had</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> the Indycar world series as a rival to the USAC National Championships that Andretti had won three times in the 1960s. The new series had rapidly become the top open wheel racing series in North America.|$|E

5|$|Augvald <b>had</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> {{his base}} in the {{north-eastern}} part of Karmøy, but {{the western part of}} the island was still ruled by another king, Ferking. The two were not enemies at first, but that changed after Augvald and his men attended a midwinter sacrificial banquet in Ferkingstad. What started as a friendly visit turned sour, and Augvald returned home with his men, leaving his daughters held captive at Ferkingstad.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 1980s, the company opened its 1,000th Public Storage {{location}} {{and the company}} was three times larger than its nearest competitor in the US market. By 1989, $2.7 billion had been invested from 200,000 investors. Public Storage helped popularize the use of self-storage businesses as a real estate investment vehicle {{and became one of}} the longest-running RELP investment vehicles. By 1991, Public Storage <b>had</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> more than 150 RELPs and real estate investment trusts (REITs).|$|E
5|$|Hawkes & Son (later Rivière & Hawkes), a rival to Boosey & Company, {{was founded}} in 1865 by William Henry Hawkes selling orchestral sheet music. The company also made musical {{instruments}} and spare parts such as clarinet reeds, and by 1925 Hawkes <b>had</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> an instrument factory in Edgware, North London. The business, which was particularly known for brass and military band music, was eventually inherited by Ralph Hawkes (1898–1950).|$|E

5|$|In 1976 Josephson {{travelled}} to California to meet {{two leading}} {{members of the}} group, laser physicists Russell Targ and Harold Puthoff, authors of Mind Reach (1977). Targ and Puthoff <b>had</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> a parapsychology ("psi") lab at SRI and had had papers published about their work – which included testing later-discredited claims by Uri Geller {{that he could make}} objects move using psychokinesis – in Nature and other peer-reviewed journals. The San Francisco Chronicle covered Josephson's visit.|$|E
5|$|By mid-July Wiesenthal {{and other}} Jewish {{residents}} had to register to do forced labour. Within six months, in November 1941 the Nazis <b>had</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> the Lwów Ghetto using Jewish forced labour. All Jews {{had to give}} up their homes and move there, a process completed in the following months. Several thousand Jews were murdered in Lvov by Ukrainian nationals and German Einsatzgruppen in June and July 1941. In his autobiographies, Wiesenthal tells how he was arrested on 6 July, but saved from execution by his former foreman, a man named Bodnar, who was now a member of the Ukrainian Auxiliary Police. There are several versions of the story, which may be apocryphal.|$|E
5|$|Chapman's subterfuge succeeded, as {{he managed}} to bargain the inebriated Bolton {{directors}} down to £10,890. He was less successful {{in his attempt to}} sign Jimmy McGrory from Celtic. He <b>had</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> a meeting with Celtic manager Willie Maley and young McGrory in summer 1928 when Maley and McGrory {{were on their way to}} a pilgrimage in Lourdes. A huge sum was offered (a blank cheque, some say) for the prolific McGrory, and Maley was more than ready to accept, for Celtic needed money to pay for their new stand. The deal fell through when McGrory, a homesick young Scotsman with an intense love for Celtic, refused to sign. He later (in 1935) broke the all-time goalscoring record.|$|E

5|$|During the 1952 Winter Olympics, Rødkleiva {{hosted the}} men's slalom and the women's slalom, {{with the other}} events taking place at Norefjell. The {{organizing}} committee <b>had</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> 15,000 tickets for the men's discipline on 19 February, but between 25,000 and 30,000 people attended the race, the surplus who did not pay for tickets. The large popularity was to see Norway's favoured Stein Eriksen. Although leading after the first heat, {{he came out of}} balance in the second and finished second behind Austria's Othmar Schneider. The women's race held the following day was won by the American Andrea Mead-Lawrence.|$|E
5|$|In July 1938, {{at the age}} of 23, Dundas was {{commissioned}} as a pilot officer in No. 609 Squadron RAF, a Royal Auxiliary Air Force squadron. Hugh and John's godfather <b>had</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> the unit. At that time, the squadron was manned by part-time civilians and was equipped with Hawker Hind bombers. It was converted from a bomber to a fighter aircraft squadron and later, in August 1939, re-equipped with the Supermarine Spitfire. John Dundas was well respected by his peers and he frequently flew his commanding officer's Hind.|$|E
5|$|Intertainment won {{the case}} and was awarded $121.7 million in damages. Samaha himself was {{declared}} by the court to be personally liable for $77 million in damages. The jury rejected Intertainment's claims under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) statute, which would have tripled the damages if Franchise had been convicted on that charge. The judgment forced Franchise into bankruptcy a few months later. The failure of the film was also reported to have led in 2002 to Travolta firing his manager Jonathan Krane, who <b>had</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> the deal with Franchise in the first place.|$|E

5|$|North Korean troops {{promptly}} set up {{a roadblock}} directly behind the 19th Infantry's line in its main route of supply along the road {{near the village of}} Tuman, just south of Yusong on Taejon's western outskirts. The roadblock quickly became a serious problem for U.S. forces trying to move ammunition and wounded to and from the Kum River line. Around 13:00 on July 16, the 19th Infantry Regimental commander contacted Dean, who ordered him to break the roadblock. However, North Korean troops <b>had</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> at least six machine-gun nests above the road at Tuman, and repeated attacks against it were unable to drive the North Korean troops away.|$|E
5|$|On February 17, 1859, the French {{warships}} {{opened fire}} on the citadel with artillery. This attack focused on the southeastern corner of the citadel, {{where most of the}} Vietnamese artillery had been installed. The Vietnamese artillery commanders had miscalculated and <b>had</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> their cannons incorrectly, firing at excessively high angles. The cannons were not easily adjusted and thus the Vietnamese firepower was misdirected and ineffective. At around 10:00, Captain Des Pallieres led 300 French soldiers in an infantry attack. They used bamboo ladders to scale the walls under artillery support from the river. The defenders were caught off guard by this manoevre and many fled in chaos.|$|E
5|$|Raël founded Clonaid in March 1997, {{shortly after}} the Dolly the Sheep cloning, believing that the process was {{important}} because the human species had been created by an extraterrestrial cloning project. On a practical level, Raël promoted the practice {{as a way to}} develop more desirable genetics and eventually prolong memories in new bodies. Shortly after Clonaid's launch, Boisselier began publicizing and managing its operations. In 1999, she announced that she <b>had</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> cloning laboratories and had hired a team of six scientists. She said she had limited knowledge of cloning but was skilled in selecting experts.|$|E

5|$|Shortly after dawn, Reshef {{conducted}} a reconnaissance {{of the battlefield}} from a hilltop. He saw that the Egyptians <b>had</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> a strong blocking position defending the junction, composed of Egyptian tanks situated in hull-down positions and infantrymen in foxholes and the now-dry irrigation ditches of the Chinese Farm. The infantry were from the 16th Brigade's right-flank battalion and {{had the support of}} recoilless rifles, RPG-7s, and some manually guided AT-3 Sagger missiles. Reshef discovered that the Egyptians had mined both sides of Lexicon Road, to which he had lost several of his tanks.|$|E
5|$|The Austrian {{national}} broadcaster, Österreichischer Rundfunk (ORF), broadcasts {{the event}} within Austria and organises {{the selection process}} for the nation's entry. From 2011 to 2013, ORF <b>had</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> national finals with several artists to choose both the song and performer to compete at Eurovision for Austria, with {{both the public and}} a panel of jury members involved in the selection. For the 2014 Eurovision Song Contest, ORF held an internal selection to choose the artist and song to represent Austria at the contest. This method had last been used by ORF in 2007.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{budget was}} quickly surpassed, {{and back in}} Los Angeles, Wasserman grew increasingly frustrated. He was regularly confronting Ned Tanen, the executive in charge of production for Universal, in person over the costs. Sean Daniel, another studio executive, was not reassured {{when he came to}} Chicago and saw the production <b>had</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> a special facility for the 70 cars used in the chase sequences. Filming there, which was supposed to have concluded in the middle of September, continued into late October.|$|E
