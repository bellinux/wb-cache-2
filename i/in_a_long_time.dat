Subsequent to the Giro, both he and third-place finisher Franco Pellizotti became embroiled in doping scandals, were given bans, and had their results stripped.|$|E

The series debuted in De Standaard in 1972. The series was the first <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> to renew the enthusiasm of Vandersteen, and the {{graphical}} quality and the stories were a lot better than most of the Studio production of the time.|$|E

He scored 34goals in Calgary, and combined with the 6 scored in Colorado, finished with his fifth 40-goal campaign in six years.|$|E

5|$|While {{talking to}} the camera, Jim (John Krasinski) and Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) reveal that Jim was offered an {{entrepreneurial}} sports job by an old college friend based on an idea the two had in college. Jim tells the camera that he turned it down, because {{it would not be}} good for his family. Pam and Jim begin to take off their microphones and Pam makes a remark, noting that, after nine years, the cameramen should have enough footage for a documentary. One of the cameramen then addresses the two, saying that they are more interested in the developments of the office workers themselves, especially Jim and Pam, rather than the office now. Jim looks pensive when Pam tells the cameramen that, with work and kids, nothing interesting will happen to the Halperts <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time.</b>|$|E

25|$|D was a {{difficult}} money-making venture for some time. It traversed {{some of the most}} rural and mountainous areas of New York and Pennsylvania.

25|$|Despite his {{personal}} reputation and authority, Parākramabāhu {{did not take}} any steps towards ensuring a smooth succession. One reason offered is the strength of Sri Lankan conventional law, which contained fairly fluid conventions for the replacement of rulers. The chronic instability of the years after his reign undid many of his accomplishments and developed into a crisis that the country never recovered from. The popularity of Parākramabāhu is attested {{by the fact that}} no less than seven monarchs adopted his name over the next four centuries, of whom only two or three could lay claim to even a fraction of his successes. His ultimate weakness was the lack of restraint in his spending, taking Sri Lanka to greater heights that it had reached <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time,</b> but exhausting the island's resources in the process.|$|E
25|$|The D {{has been}} a {{difficult}} money-making venture for some time. Originally constructed as a coal hauling route and when that business declined it proved difficult to turn a profit. It operates {{in some of the}} most rural areas of New York State, and very few industrial customers between Binghamton and Rouses Point remain. The railroad's current prognosis is arguably better than it has been <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time.</b> Along with the NYC connection, haulage agreements with other railroads are greatly increasing traffic. CP has been steadily using their high power AC traction locomotives on their road trains that run on the line, instead of their aging SD40-2 models. This is an indication of the increasing importance of reliable service. There are also major signal and track projects underway to modernize the former D lines.|$|E
25|$|The {{battle was}} the first major blow to the Medes, as this {{was the first}} time <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> that Media had been {{defeated}} in a battle. As Cyrus's first victory in the war, it did not go well with Astyages, the king of the Medes. It also caused the northern satraps to revolt, and ally their provinces with Persia. Years after the war, the Persians and Medes still held a deep appreciation of one another, and some Medes were allowed to become part of the Persian Immortals. Since the early 1900s this battle was almost forgotten to history. As most of its account comes from fragments, only in the later modern age historians have renewed interest in this (now considered) historic event which changed the ancient world. This is because the battle started a chain reaction of events which led Persia to become the most powerful state for the next quarter of a millennia.|$|E

For {{the first time}} <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time,</b> the West Indies were {{considered}} realistic contenders for the title, {{a measure of how}} the team has matured under the auspices of Sammy. However, it was as an individual player that he came under scrutiny in the tournament. In the journey from group stages to the final, Sammy contributed 27 runs with the bat from four visits to the crease and overall bowling figures of 2/125, and drew a lot of criticism as many people felt he was keeping better players out of the side. But in the final, when it mattered most, Sammy scored 26 not out from 15 balls and took two key wickets (almost matching his batting and bowling tally {{for the rest of the}} tournament) to help his team overcome a slow start and defeat Sri Lanka.|$|E
25|$|The 2008 Giro d'Italia was led {{for many}} days by Giovanni Visconti who had gained the lead after {{participating}} in a breakaway. Eventual winner Alberto Contador first took {{the lead of the}} race after the second mountain stage, to Marmolada, by finishing nearly fifteen minutes ahead of previous race leader Gabriele Bosisio– who had just gained the lead the stage before. In the race's final week, Contador faced stern challenges from Riccò and defending Giro champion Danilo Di Luca; however, their efforts bore no fruits as Contador {{went on to win the}} race. Russian Denis Menchov won the 2009 centennial edition of the Giro, after having taken the lead <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> trial in stage 12, and defended it vigorously against attacks from his closest challenger, Danilo Di Luca, during the mountain stages of the final week.

Subsequent to the Giro, both he and third-place finisher Franco Pellizotti became embroiled in doping scandals, were given bans, and had their results stripped.|$|E
25|$|Setsuna being a Kurd was an {{international}} decision by Sunrise. This was done as critique to Japan's apathy towards religion. Director Seiji Mizushima {{wanted to give}} viewers a close approach to the wars in the Middle East, believing the problem would not be solved <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time.</b> Mizushima aimed to make the viewers understand Setsuna's feelings {{as a result of}} living under war conditions. In regards to his personality, Mizushima wanted the series' protagonist that could not be related with the audience. This was done to contrast previous Gundam protagonists and appeal to young viewers. While he saw his past as difficult to understand he might look appealing as a result. The staff also wanted to create a character the audience could relate to. Late in the series, Setsuna's Quanta system was introduced in order to convey his message that he wants war to end through communication rather than violence. This idea was explored once again in the movie where the plot was written so that nobody except Setsuna could end the conflict.|$|E

Game Revolution editor Jesse Constantino comments that while Grasshopper Manufacture tries to portray him as punk, he's no more punk than his grandmother's doll collection, comparing him to Sam Spade of The Maltese Falcon. He was also described as what the love child between Fight Clubs Tyler Durden and Kill Bills The Bride would be. Game designer Steve Gaynor compared Travis' clothing to Durden's as well. He {{has been compared}} to another character from Goichi Suda in the video game Flower, Sun, and Rain called Sumio Mondo. Gaming Nexus editor Matt Mirkovich praised the voice work of his voice actor Robin Atkin Downes, calling it one of the best works in gaming. Game Style editor Garry Webber described him as an unashamedly geeky otaku as well as an amoral contemptuous assassin, but added that this was why he was so likable. G4 TV editor Matt Kiel stated that Travis is an especially noteworthy aspect of the quality plot, adding that while he's amoral and a jerk, {{he is one of the}} most likable video game characters <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time.</b> Fox News editor Lou Kesten described Travis as the Wii's most ridiculously violent hero.
