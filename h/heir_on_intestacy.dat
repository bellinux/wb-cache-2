50|$|The only persons {{liable to}} collate are {{descendants}} who are <b>heirs</b> <b>on</b> <b>intestacy,</b> {{or who are}} heirs under a will of an ancestor (provided {{that they would have}} been his heirs had there been no will); a hence a grandchild, whose father is alive, and who is an appointed heir under his grandfather’s will, need not collate. If his father is dead, however, he must collate not only what he has received from his grandfather, but also amounts his father received.|$|R
50|$|The above laws conferred a {{right of}} {{succession}} <b>on</b> <b>intestacy</b> <b>on</b> the deceased’s blood relations, but none on a surviving spouse or an adopted child, and furthermore restricted the intestate succession rights of the extra-marital child. Because marriage in community of property was the norm, such a spouse ipso facto took half of the joint estate.|$|R
40|$|This work {{deal with}} a {{heirship}} from the historical view. It contains legal form of heirship in the Roman law and continues with this question in Czech law in the past. In the Roman Law it discusses descent <b>on</b> <b>intestacy,</b> testaments, status of heritors, their protection {{and other kinds of}} last wills. In the Czech heirship it handles about indivisible system, testaments and descent <b>on</b> <b>intestacy.</b> Further it deals with the development of the Civil Code from 1627 to 1964. The last chapter compares the present Civil Code with the project of new Civil Code and there are formuled positives and negatives of these legal forms...|$|R
50|$|Collation is an {{obligation}} imposed by law on all descendants {{who wish to}} share as heirs in the estate of their ancestor, either by will or <b>on</b> <b>intestacy.</b> The obligation is to account to the estate for any gifts or advances received by them from their ancestor, or debts incurred to him, during his lifetime.|$|R
50|$|When a donor {{makes an}} {{imperfect}} gift during his lifetime, and the donee is subsequently appointed as the donor's executor or becomes the donor's administrator <b>on</b> <b>intestacy,</b> the gift is perfected because the donee obtains legal {{title to the}} donor's property, including {{the subject matter of}} the intended gift, in the donee's capacity as executor or administrator.|$|R
50|$|The {{general rule}} is that all persons, born or unborn, natural or juristic, and {{regardless}} of their general legal capacity—minor children, too, therefore—may take validly any benefit conferred on them by will or <b>on</b> <b>intestacy.</b> There are, however, various factors that may influence a beneficiary’s capacity to inherit. Persons who have limited legal capacity are still capable of inheriting. However, their ability to enjoy their inheritance {{as they see fit}} is affected.|$|R

50|$|Parajāta yogas (Sanskrit: परजात - meaning {{stranger}} or servant or born of another) {{are special}} planetary combinations or yogas that indicate birth {{of children who}} are not genetically related to their father or non-marital children or born out of illicit connections of their married mothers. Illegitimate children are stigmatized for no fault of theirs; some, like T.E.Lawrence, are made to seek redemption of their mother’s status but most accept their fate like Satyakama Jabala did. In India, illegitimate children of a Hindu father do not inherit from him <b>on</b> <b>intestacy</b> but they do inherit from their mother at par with her legitimate children.|$|R
50|$|The law <b>on</b> <b>intestacy</b> in Scotland broadly {{follows that}} of England and Wales with some variations. A notable {{difference}} is that all possible (blood) relatives can qualify for benefit (i.e. they {{are not limited to}} grandparents or their descendants). Once a class is 'exhausted', succession continues to the next line of ascendants, followed by siblings, and so on. In a complete absence of relatives of the whole or half-blood, the estate passes to the Crown (as ultimus haeres). The Crown has a discretion to benefit people unrelated to the intestate, e.g. those with moral claims on the estate.|$|R
50|$|Post-hoc legitimisation was {{introduced}} under the Legitimacy Act 1926 (16 & 17 Geo. 5 c. 60) and the Family Law Reform Act 1969 (c. 46) allowed a bastard to inherit <b>on</b> the <b>intestacy</b> of his parents.|$|R
50|$|Under Roman-Dutch law, {{an illegitimate}} or extra-marital child {{inherited}} upon the intestacy of its mother, {{but not of}} its father. This limitation on {{the capacity of the}} extra-marital child to inherit <b>on</b> <b>intestacy</b> has been swept away by the Intestate Succession Act, which provides that, in general, illegitimacy shall not affect the capacity of one blood relation to inherit the intestate estate of another blood relation. Illegitimacy arising from incest, too, no longer presents a problem. Furthermore, as noted earlier, the tenuous position of extra-marital children under African customary law of succession, too, has been removed by making the Intestate Succession Act applicable to all children.|$|R

50|$|The Missionaries didn't {{recognize}} Tavita as rightful <b>heir,</b> <b>on</b> {{the excuse}} {{that he was}} not born in church wedlock. The opposition opposed Tione as <b>heir,</b> <b>on</b> the grounds that he was part Rarotongan. Tavita, however, died before his father. On the death of Numangatini, in 1878, a district chief installed No'oroa as ariki on the grounds that he was of senior descent, and full Mangaian.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} {{findings}} from a large-scale study of public attitudes to inheritance law, particularly the rules <b>on</b> <b>intestacy.</b> It argues {{that far from}} {{the assumption that the}} 'family' is in terminal decline, people in England and Wales still view their most important relationships, at least for the purposes of inheritance law, as centred on a nuclear family model. However, there is also widespread acceptance of re-partnering and cohabitation, producing generally high levels of support for including cohabitants in the intestacy rules and for ensuring that children from former relationships are protected. We argue that these views are underpinned by a continuing sense of responsibility to the members of one's nuclear family, arising from notions of sharing and commitment, dependency and support, and a sense of lineage...|$|R

5000|$|In Ireland, {{the term}} [...] "next of kin" [...] {{does have a}} meaning with regard to {{inheritance}} law. If a person dies intestate, that is without leaving a will, then {{the rules of the}} Succession Act 1965 apply. Part VI of the Act — Distribution <b>on</b> <b>Intestacy</b> (sections 66-75) — explains the rules of intestacy; this was amended by Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010. With regard to medical law, [...] "next of kin" [...] is a very vague concept which has no legally defined meaning. If a patient is incapable of making a decision (for instance due to unconsciousness), the present medical ethics in Ireland is to consult with the next of kin (in order: spouse, children, parents, siblings). However, the next of kin have no general right to make decisions on behalf of adult patients.|$|R

50|$|The Penn-Calvert {{boundary}} dispute (also known as Penn vs. Baltimore) was a long-running legal conflict between William Penn and his <b>heirs</b> <b>on</b> one side, and Charles Calvert, 3rd Baron Baltimore and his <b>heirs</b> <b>on</b> the other side. The overlapping {{nature of their}} charters of land in Colonial America required numerous attempts at mediation, surveying, and intervention by the king and courts of England to ultimately be resolved. Subsequent questions over these charters have also been adjudicated by American arbitrators and the Supreme Court of the United States.
