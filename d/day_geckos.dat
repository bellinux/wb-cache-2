2500|$|Naultinus {{species are}} {{commonly}} known as [...] "green geckos" [...] in New Zealand for their striking bright green colouration. In addition, they are diurnal, which allows them to take advantage of warmer day-time temperatures. Both of these features are shared only with the <b>day</b> <b>geckos</b> (Phelsuma) of Madagascar. Almost every other type of gecko in the world is nocturnal and brown or grey in colour. All Naultinus are arboreal, and though most of them are predominantly green, their skin patterns are known to be plain (N. manukanus, [...] N. punctatus), spotted (N. elegans, N. gemmeus, N. grayii, N. punctatus, N. rudis, N. stellatus, N. tuberculatus), or striped (N. gemmeus). Occasionally, individuals of an overall lemon-yellow colour are encountered; this is a rare genetic colour morph similar to albinism.|$|E
