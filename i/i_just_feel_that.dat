500|$|That {{night at}} the Marott Hotel, Kennedy hosted a meeting with 14 local black leaders. The meeting had been {{arranged}} before the assassination by aide James Tolan and took place in Tolan's room. The group had debated among themselves {{as to whether they}} should hold the meeting. Kennedy eventually arrived, and the conversation quickly became heated as leaders accused him of being an unreliable member of [...] "the white establishment." [...] He lost his temper, saying, [...] "I don't need all this aggravation. I could sit next to my swimming pool. You know, God's been good to me and I really don't need anything. But <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> if He's been that good, I should try to put something back in. And you all call yourselves leaders and you've been moaning and groaning about personal problems. You haven't once talked about your own people." [...] The meeting ended with most attendees pledging their support to Kennedy's campaign. One of them later acknowledged that Kennedy was [...] "completely sympathetic and understanding".|$|E

500|$|In the Court of Appeals seat, Sotomayor {{gained a}} {{reputation}} for vigorous and blunt behavior toward lawyers appealing before her, sometimes {{to the point of}} brusque and curt treatment or testy interruptions. [...] She was known for extensive preparation for oral arguments and for running a [...] "hot bench", where judges ask lawyers plenty of questions. Unprepared lawyers suffered the consequences, but the vigorous questioning was an aid to lawyers seeking to tailor their arguments to the judge's concerns. The 2009 Almanac of the Federal Judiciary, which collected anonymous evaluations of judges by lawyers who appear before them, contained a wide range of reactions to Sotomayor. Comments also diverged among lawyers willing to be named. Attorney Sheema Chaudhry said, [...] "She's brilliant and she's qualified, but <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> she can be very, how do you say, temperamental." [...] Defense lawyer Gerald B. Lefcourt said, [...] "She used her questioning to make a point, as opposed to really looking for an answer to a question she did not understand." [...] In contrast, Second Circuit Judge Richard C. Wesley said that his interactions with Sotomayor had been [...] "totally antithetical to this perception that has gotten some traction that she is somehow confrontational." [...] Second Circuit Judge and former teacher Guido Calabresi said his tracking showed that Sotomayor's questioning patterns were no different from those of other members of the court and added, [...] "Some lawyers just don’t like to be questioned by a woman. [...] was sexist, plain and simple." ...|$|E

That's as much as I usually eat. And by the time I had finished the rest of the food, I felt simply waterlogged, and I do still. More than that. The knowledge that I had to make a speech congratulating this society of yours on its fiftieth anniversary haunted and racked me all through the meal. I am not, in plain truth, the ready and brilliant speaker you take me for. That is a pure myth. If you could see the desperate home scene that goes on in my family when I am working up a speech, your minds would be at rest on that point.|$|R

He went on to make 40 appearances during the campaign, with the Stevenage defence being particularly strong once again. However, he suffered an injury following the club's 1–1 home draw against Preston North End on 9 April 2012. The game ultimately {{turned out to be}} Henry's last match for the club. After spending seven years at Stevenage, Henry left the club when his contract expired in May 2012.

2500|$|Publicist Marvet Britto stated, [...] "Jackson embodies grace, {{style and}} integrity...She {{has never been}} known as a bad person." [...] Britto {{describes}} Jackson’s videotaped apology as [...] "impersonal", saying, [...] "She has never been an impersonal artist, so it made it seem like she was guilty of something, and she wasn't. I would have had her and Timberlake apologizing side by side right from the beginning, since they performed side by side. Otherwise, it made the whole apology seem calculated and contrived." [...] Jackson said of the apology, [...] "I probably {{should have done it}} live. But there was so much going on at the time that I needed to just get it done. It is what it is. And it will pass, and I'm fine with it." [...] At one point Jackson was scheduled to be interviewed about the incident by Diane Sawyer on the ABC newsmagazine Primetime, however, the interview never came to fruition. Jackson later briefly discussed the incident on Good Morning America and the Late Show with David Letterman. Jackson's outfit was designed by famed designer Alexander McQueen, with Jackson later commenting [...] "I don't blame him; he didn't rip it. Alexander is so great at what he does – he's a genius." [...] In an interview with Australia's Herald Sun, Jackson commented on Timberlake (whom, as mentioned, Jackson had previously known personally and aided when she selected his former group 'N Sync to open for her Velvet Rope World Tour at the start of their career) distancing himself from the incident and seemingly changing with fame. [...] "I really want to be honest about this, but <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> anything I say about him will be taken the wrong way", said Jackson. [...] "I do think that Justin is very talented and that he has a very big career ahead of him. But he seems to have changed recently. He's gotten a bit cocky. You know, some people can handle success and some people can't. I'm starting to wonder if (the latter) is the case with Justin. And it hurts me to say that." [...] Producer Jimmy Jam revealed Jackson considered writing a song about the incident for her Damita Jo album, saying, [...] "I don't know whether it will or not. But I have a feeling it probably will, because kind of whatever's happening in her life tends to be what she writes about [...] It'd be kind of interesting to see what her feeling is about it." ...|$|E

Group member Heidi Range revealed that the band {{wanted to write a}} song with which they could have fun; it was inspired by different situations experienced during a night out. Keisha Buchanan, another member of the Sugababes, told Digital Spy that she wrote 90% of the song but could not comprehend the meaning of the lyrics: [...] "I think it's because as I've got older I don't really relate to the lyrics. It was more of a fun song but <b>I</b> <b>just</b> don't really <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> attached to it any more." [...] Higgins, Xenomania and Jeremy Wheatley produced the song; the latter mixed it at the Town House Studios, London. [...] "In the Middle" [...] was programmed by Matt Duguid, Nick Coler, Tim Powell and Tim Larcombe.|$|R
2500|$|Clarkson {{presented}} [...] "Piece by Piece" [...] {{in a short}} {{live acoustic}} performance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon on March 2, 2015, and explained how she co-wrote the song. She revealed that the song's lyrical content had also made it {{hard for her to}} perform it live, saying [...] "It's not even the sad parts of it because I'm not there. I'm not in that place anymore, like where I'm sad about it. I'm in a very forgiving place about it and everybody's human. But I think I get really choked up because <b>I</b> <b>just</b> realize how lucky I am...

[...] To promote the album, Clarkson had also performed the song in a stripped-down performance as part of her set list during her Piece by Piece Tour. On February 25, 2016, she performed [...] "Piece by Piece" [...] in a live performance a year after its release on the fifteenth season of American Idol. Her rendition of the song was met with a standing ovation from the audience and critical acclaim from music critics— with Olivia Waring Metro praising it as poignant while USA Todays Erin Jensen describing it as a [...] "heartfelt performance that we just can't get enough of". On March 3, 2016, Clarkson appeared on The Ellen DeGeneres Show where she discussed her American Idol performance and closed the program with a rendition of the song.|$|R

[...] "Perhaps after a while I'll get used to it, but I'm afraid concerts spoil people for everyday life. I suppose that is why Marilla disapproves of them. Marilla is such a sensible woman. It must be a great deal better to be sensible; but still, I don't believe I'd really want to be a sensible person, because they are so unromantic. Mrs. Lynde says there is no danger of my ever being one, but you can never tell. <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>just</b> now <b>that</b> <b>I</b> may grow up to be sensible yet.
