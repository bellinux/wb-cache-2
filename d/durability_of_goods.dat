40|$|This paper {{compares the}} <b>durability</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> {{produced}} in competitive and monopolistic markets.

In this paper, we relax the assumption of constant returns to scale and derive more general conditions under which optimal durability is independent of the level of output.

40|$|The {{point of}} this paper is that if output is durable then optimal {{behavior}} of a supplier is characterized by production smoothing. <b>Durability</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> (such as capital) has opposite effects on the supply of the goods. Higher durability on the one hand raises the variability of investment demand for the goods by lowering the user’s cost, which tends to raise the variability of supply; on the other hand it lowers the expected future demand for the goods, which tends to reduce the variability of supply. These opposite effects of durability manifest in economies where suppliers of durable goods opt to use inventories to buffer demand shocks. Due to inventory adjustment and rational expectation, the variability of production can be reduced both absolutely and relative to sales if output is durable...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the effects of}} market structure [...] monopoly versus competition [...] on the quality and <b>durability</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods.</b> Also, it tries to find the impact of government regulation on these variables. The types of quality improvements discussed are: quality as pure substitute for quantity; quality which increases the demand for the good; and quality improvement which increases the durability of the good. In general, {{it is impossible to}} deduce that quality is independent of market structure. It depends on the cost structure. The paper shows that when quality is a substitute for quantity, both quality and quantity of the monopoly might fall short of those in the competitive market. Regulating only quality, or only quantity, may increase the monopoly misallocations of resources. In other types of quality improvements discussed, it may turn out that quality and durability may be better or worse in the monopolized industry than in the competitive one. Regulating only quality may improve the resource allocation but not eliminate the bias. Quantity regulation by itself may be sufficient for producing the optimal flow of services. ...|$|E

I next specify dynamic network formation game to model the adoption decision of hardware platforms by software providers. Counterfactual experiments indicate that vertical integration and exclusivity benefited the smaller entrant platforms and not the dominant incumbent, which stands contrary to the interpretation of exclusivity as primarily a means of foreclosure and entry deterrence. ...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the main}} causes behind the trade {{collapse}} of 2008 - 09 was a significant fall in the demand for durable goods. This paper develops a small country, overlapping generations model of international trade in which goods durability {{gives rise to a}} more than proportional fall in trade volumes, as observed in 2008 - 09. The model has three goods - two durable, traded goods and one non-durable, non-traded good and two factors of production. The <b>durability</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> affects consumers’ lifetime wealth and their optimal consumption bundle across goods and time periods. A uniform productivity shock reduces consumers’ lifetime wealth inducing a re-optimisation away from durables. This gives rise to a more than proportional effect on international trade, provided the non-traded sector is sufficiently capital intensive. The elasticity of trade flows to GDP is found to be increasing in both the degree of durability {{and the size of the}} shock. The model thus provides microfoundations for the asymmetric shock to the demand for durable goods observed in recessions and clarifies the link between this endogenous shift in preferences and international trade flows. It also explains the observation that deeper downturns are associated with a higher elasticity of trade to GDP. Furthermore, the greater the degree of durability of traded goods, the larger is the share of domestically produced goods in consumption, for plausible factor intensities. This provides an alternative explanation for the home bias in consumption, and hence another explanation for Trefler’s "missing trade"...|$|E
40|$|Consumer product {{warranties}} are {{our most}} common of written contracts, but {{little is known}} about what determines their content or how they relate to the reliability and the <b>durability</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods.</b> Since the first appearance of standardized warranties early in this century, two theories have been proposed to explain their role in sales transactions. The first emphasizes the absence of bargaining over warranty provisions. It views warranties as devices of manufacturers to exploit consumers by unilaterally limiting legal obligations. The second and more recent theory focuses on the difficulty consumers face at the time of purchase in estimating the risk of product defects. This theory regards express warranties as messages signaling the mechanical attributes of goods. Both theories have influenced substantially judicial and legislative responses to product warranties. The view of the warranty as an exploitative device has provided crucial support to the policy of enterprise liability and the replacement of contract principles with tort principles in product defect cases. In addition, the exploitation theory is the intellectual basis for the modern judicial treatment of consumer warranty issues, in particular for the expansive interpretation of warranties implied by law, for the elimination of the requirement of privity of contract, and for the restriction of the manufacturer 2 ̆ 7 s authority to limit available remedies or to disclaim general obligations. More recently, the signal theory has informed the design of the federal Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act, which directly regulates both the form and content of consumer product warranties...|$|E

It has been hypothesized that early initiation of treatment with the combination of oral anti-diabetes agents with complementary mechanisms of action can increase the <b>durability</b> <b>of</b> glycaemic control compared with metformin monotherapy followed by a stepwise addition of oral agents. Dipeptidyl peptidase- 4 inhibitors are good candidates for early use as they are efficacious in combination with metformin, show weight neutrality and a low risk of hypoglycaemia. We aimed to test the hypothesis that early combined treatment of metformin and vildagliptin slows β-cell deterioration as measured by HbA 1 c. METHODS: Approximately 2000 people with Type 2 diabetes mellitus who were drug-naive or who were treated with metformin for less than 1 month, and who have HbA 1 c of 48 - 58 mmol/mol (6. 5 - 7. 5 %), will be randomized in a 1 : 1 ratio in VERIFY, a 5 -year multinational, double-blind, parallel-group study designed to compare early initiation of a vildagliptin-metformin combination with standard-of-care initiation of metformin monotherapy, followed by the stepwise addition of vildagliptin when glycaemia deteriorates. Further deterioration will be treated with insulin. The primary analysis for treatment failure will be from a Cox proportional hazard regression model and the <b>durability</b> <b>of</b> glycaemic control will be evaluated by assessing treatment failure rate and the rate of loss in glycaemic control over time as co-primary endpoints.

As {{the amount of money}} involved in virtual goods sales increases, market performance questions gain relevance. In this thesis, we examine the effects of secondary markets on the profitability of a virtual world service provider operating under a virtual goods sales model. More specifically, we ask whether the service provider should tolerate secondary markets or seek to kill them off. The structure of this thesis is as follows: we first review how virtual worlds operate as businesses and provide an analysis of the market conditions faced by a virtual world operator to provide sufficient context for the reader. We then examine the inner workings of virtual economies and review structures commonly encountered within them. Next, we conduct a literature review on real world secondary market models and analyses. Finally, we evaluate the implications of real world secondary market results on secondary markets for virtual goods. In the final section, we present conclusions and possible avenues for further study. We find that recent durable goods research suggests that a profit-maximizing monopolist will not shut down secondary markets, but will choose to reduce <b>durability</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> instead and that these results can apply to virtual worlds as well. However, we also show that the question of allowing or not allowing secondary markets cannot be answered based on profitability alone and that service providers have to also account for externalities brought on by secondary markets...|$|E
40|$|The {{principle}} aim of {{this thesis}} is to construct a consumption function for Turkey for policy analysis using the annual State Planning Organisation (SPO) time-series data. This study commences from 1962 and extends {{until the end of}} 1994, when a financial crisis occurred in Turkey. It attempts to analyse not only the decline in the private savings rate {{during the first half of}} the 1980 s, but also the significant rise from 1986 onwards. The thesis starts with an introduction which explodes the main research objectives, considers the existing consumption theories and extentions, records the main data features to be explained, briefly overviews the modelling strategy and discusses the basic considerations of the research and gives the structure of thesis. A literature survey on the theory of consumption is given in Chapter 2. The LifeCycle/ Permanent-Income hypothesis is considered as central to the two mainstream approach. : the Euler approach and the solved-out approach. These approaches are further extended by considering uncertainty and precautionary saving, credit restrictions, saving and leisure. habit or costs of adjustments and the <b>durability</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods,</b> the role of assets and asset prices. financial liberalisation and demographic factors. Finally, comparisons between the two approaches arc made in the conclusion of that chapter. Theory can deliver concepts with permanent relationships in economics, but it should be supported by empirical findings, since theory alone is insufficient to determine the actual economic relationship. Hence, Chapter 3 focuses on theoretical and appl ied modelling issues to construct a theory-consistent, congruent and encompassing consumption function. Congruency implies that the empirical model matches the available evidence in al l measured attributes (i. e., it is consistent with the theory from which it was derived, has unexplained components that arc innovations against available information, has basic parameters that are constant, is data admissible, and where any conditioning variables are weakly exogenous for the parameters of interest). Encompassing denotes that the model of interest can account for the result of rival models of the same phenomena. I also define structure as the set of invariant features of the economic mechanism. A parameter can be structural only if it is invariant for an extension of the sample period (constant), is invariant with respect to changes elsewhere in the economy (regime shifts), and is invariant over extensions of the information set (adding more variables). Chapter 4 examines the small-sample properties of the statistical methods used by means of Monte Carlo simulations. The informativeness of the data is investigated in an unrestricted Vector Auto-regression (VAR) with small-samples of noisy data combined with a high real growth rate and nominal inflation. This is to see how the relative drift dominates in explaining the informativeness of the data. The Monte results are summarised by using response surfaces to relate the biases to sample size. The ratio of standard deviations to standard errors in each equation is also analysed. The strong impacts of the system error variances in these response surfaces indicate the importance of high variances in VA Rs. Furthermore, I found noise, and a function of the signal to noise ratio. and cross-equation correlation had a large impact, but less effect from the relative drift. Chapter 5 presents an overview of the Turkish Economy, particularly during the sample period. by pointing out the lessons to be drawn from the stabilisation experiments and their effect on the private sector saving decision in Turkey. The aim of Chapter 6 is to get nominal housing wealth and housing price data from the available data, such as the nominal private disposable income. nominal private investment in the housing sector and the consumer price index, since housing wealth is claimed to be a major determinant of private savings in Turkey. Chapter 7 aims to reveal the problems of Turkish data by analysing the history of the Turkish a 1 ional Accounts to construct a data-base for estimating a consumption function for Turkey. GDP by expenditure is constructed from five different sources. Turkish accounting residuals are allocated by applying the linear regression approach. The results show that GDP-by-output is more reliable than the GDP-by-expenditure measure for Turkey. Chapter 8 is devoted to the time series modelling and evidence. Previous findings on consumption for Turkey have been formulated using conventional econometric techniques with a static estimation methodology within the Permanent Income Hypothesis (PIH). I adopted the equilibrium correction model (ECM) solved-out consumption function approach and tried to incorporate the effects of age. precautionary behaviour in the case of uncertainty, credit constraints, habits or costs of adjustments. and the <b>durability</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> for developing belier understanding of private sector savings behaviour in Turkey. The modelling is based on the dynamic econometric methodology that involves the estimation of a general unrestricted model (GUM). a co-integration and long-run analysis, and the simplification of the GUM to a parsimonious dynamic model that is deduced by applying a sequential testing procedure. The final model is congruent: It matches the available evidence in all measured attributes and forecasts well, has white noise errors and constant parameters, and encompasses the VAR model equation as well as other specifications in previous models. Moreover, the model has a structural interpretation. The results of the final model reveal strong positive effects of the real interest rate. inflation and inflation uncertainty, a strong negative effect of population aged 15 - 44, a positive effect after one lag period of the change in the average propensity to consume. which represents the effects of expectations, habits or adjustment costs, in addition to the significant effect of the inverse of per capita Private Disposable Income and the change in housing wealth to income ra 1 io on the private average propensity to consume in Turkey. These findings offer an explana 1 ion for the salient features of the Turkish consumption pattern observed from 1 he lime series data. These results also provide some policy implications such that inOation control should be strengthened and improved for consumption stabilisation. Furthermore. interest rate policy also has an important role to play in the savings process in Turkey. The research on small-sample properties of 1 hc statistical methods by means of Monte Carlo Simulations strengthens the results of the empirical model. These. confirm the poor determination of intercepts in I(I) VARs, and the corresponding advantages of an equilibrium correction model formulation. Furthermore. the insignificance the of irrelevant dynamics should encourage model builders to use a dynamic econometric methodology to develop parsimonious models, such as used for building a consumption model for Turkey in this thesis. </p...|$|E

40|$|We {{examine the}} effects <b>of</b> <b>durability</b> on {{equilibrium}} producer behavior in the car market In this setting forward-looking producers {{take into account the}} effect that their current production decisions have on their current and future profits due to the existence of a secondary market First we construct a dynamic oligopoly model of a vertically-differentiated product market to understand the equilibrium production dynamics which arise from the <b>durability</b> <b>of</b> the <b>goods</b> and their active trade in secondary markets Second we use data from the automobile industry to estimate a tractable linear-quadratic version of this model One result suggests that durability may be a particularly desirable car feature for high-quality car producers since by overproducing today they can exploit durability and the existence of a secondary market to potentially reduce their lower-quality competitors' future production: planned obsolescence appears to be a more profitable strategy for lower-end than higher-end producer...|$|R
40|$|Models {{predict that}} oligopolists {{producing}} a durable good {{have an incentive}} to reduce the <b>durability</b> <b>of</b> the <b>good</b> as a means to appropriate the returns to investments in R&D. Using these theoretical insights, the paper empirically examines these strategies of appropriation in wheat breeding. Breeders face a unique appropriation problem because plant varieties (a durable good) demonstrate easy reproducibility and heritability of characteristics. In addition, the available legal scope of protection, till recent revisions, has tended to provide limited protection compared to protection available in other sectors. Strategies of planned obsolescence are indicated in the effort to reduce the <b>durability</b> <b>of</b> plant varieties so as to induce regular replacement purchases by farmers. Empirical evidence of the strategy is provided in decreasing tendency of the market-weighted age of varieties, which falls from 13 years in the 1960 s to 5 years in the 1990 s. In addition, the paper reports evidence of a lax approach towards developing broad-based disease resistance, which can be interpreted as a means to support the strategy of planned obsolescence.

40|$|We first {{estimate}} {{the effects of}} a euro area-wide monetary policy change on output growth in eleven industries of seven euro area countries over the period 1980 - 98. On average the negative effect of an interest rate tightening on output is significantly greater in recessions than in booms. There is, however, considerable cross-industry heterogeneity in both the overall policy effects and the degree of asymmetry across the two business cycle phases. We then explore which industry characteristics can account for this cross-industry heterogeneity. Differences in the overall policy effects can mainly be explained by the <b>durability</b> <b>of</b> the <b>goods</b> produced in the sector. This can be regarded as evidence for the conventional interest rate/cost-of-capital channel. In contrast, differences in the degree of asymmetry of policy effects are related to differences in financial structure, in particular the maturity structure of debt, the coverage ratio, financial leverage and firm size. This suggests that financial accelerator mechanisms can partly explain cross-industry differences in asymmetry. Copyright 2005 Royal Economic Society. ...|$|R
