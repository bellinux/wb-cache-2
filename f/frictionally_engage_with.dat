40|$|A braking {{apparatus}} {{is described}} for a tape transport device having two stacked coaxial reels and feelers mounted in {{proximity to the}} reels for sensing the tape being wound on each reel. A device is mounted in proximity to adjacent central hubs of the reels to a simultaneously, <b>frictionally</b> <b>engage</b> both hubs and brake both reels. A mechanical actuator is coupled to both feelers and to the brake device. The brake means comprises a pair of rubber shoulders that extend in opposite directions relative to a common axis, and turns about the axis in response to either of the feelers...|$|R
40|$|A novel {{configuration}} of contact and friction models is outlined to describe friction in rough line contacts operating under mixed friction. The load distribution between fluid and solid body contacts is iteratively determined {{with a combination}} of the half-space theory and an established elasto-hydrodynamic model. On this basis, boundary friction and fluid friction are determined with a frictional work method and a fluid friction model, respectively. The calculation results based on the developed model are compared with experimental results achieved <b>with</b> rolling bearings, <b>frictionally</b> <b>engaged</b> freewheels as well as tribometers for contact pressures up to 2500 MPa. In wide ranges, experimental results show good compliance with the calculated results...|$|R
40|$|<b>Frictionally</b> <b>engaged</b> joints {{are widely}} used in {{mechanical}} engineering and require a high static friction. Thermally sprayed hardmetal coatings have a high potential to fulfil this requirement. However, almost all research activities are traditionally focused on the decrease of the dynamic coefficient of friction. In this paper the static coefficient of friction of as-sprayed Cr 3 C 2 -NiCr coatings in torsion experiments with different contact pressures was studied. The form, orientation and the geometric characteristics of the friction surface have been investigated. The slipping curves have been determined and a static coefficient of friction μmax up to 0. 80 was measured. The results show a standard deviation depending on the nominal contact pressure...|$|R
40|$|An energy {{absorbing}} system for controlling the force where a moving object engages a stationary stop {{and where the}} system utilized telescopic tubular members, {{energy absorbing}} diaphragm elements, force regulating disc springs, and a return spring to return the telescoping member to its start position after stroking is presented. The energy absorbing system has frusto-conical diaphragm elements <b>frictionally</b> <b>engaging</b> the shaft and are opposed by a force regulating set of disc springs. In principle, this force feedback mechanism serves to keep the stroking load at a reasonable level even if the friction coefficient increases greatly. This force feedback device also serves to desensitize the singular and combined effects of manufacturing tolerances, sliding surface wear, temperature changes, dynamic effects, and lubricity...|$|R

50|$|To recapitulate, these ligands {{activate}} the NK, as we explained. However, before the activation, Killer Inhibition Receptors (KIRs) recognize certain molecules in the MHC class I of the hosted cell and get <b>engaged</b> <b>with</b> them. These molecules {{are typical of}} healthy cells but some of these molecules are repressed in infected or transformed cells. For this reason when the hosted cell is really infected the proportion of KARs <b>engaged</b> <b>with</b> ligands is bigger than the proportion of KIRs <b>engaged</b> <b>with</b> MHC I molecules. When this happens the NK is activated and the hosted cell is destroyed. On the other hand, if there are more KIRs <b>engaged</b> <b>with</b> MHC class I molecules than KARs <b>engaged</b> <b>with</b> ligands, the NK isn't activated and the suspicious hosted cell remains alive. To conclude, we should add that each KAR has its specific KIR and they always work together. For instance, the C-type lectins receptors are inhibited by some CD94/NKG2 complex.|$|R
