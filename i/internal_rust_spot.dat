40|$|This is {{the first}} report {{of the results of}} the series of {{experiments}} which have been carried on by the authors from December 1978 to February 1979. This series of experiments, named Experiments 6, aimed to determine the threshold values of NaCl concentrations in concrete for steel bar rusting. A method of electrical potential difference measurements of spots of concrete specimen surfaces over Cu/CuSO_ 4 half cell, having been developed by California Division of Highways and having been widely used to detect the <b>rusting</b> <b>spots</b> of steel bars in concrete, are also performed in this series of experiments. We planned to examine the method, if it can be applicable to the RC structures in Okinawa Prefecture to detect <b>rusting</b> <b>spots.</b> The following results about steel bar corrosion are obtained by and at six months after embedding steel bars in concrete. 1. Steel bars in the concrete contained 0. 033 % of NaCl have not corroded yet without adding any amount of corrosion inhibitors. 2. Steel bars in the concrete contained 0. 067 % of NaCl do not also corrode yet, if adequate amount of corrosion inhibitors are added to the concrete. 3. In case of the concrete contained 0. 100 % of NaCl by weight, there have been steel bars corroded some, but their areas of corrosion were small. Some of the steel bars have no corrosion spots where adequate amount of corrosion inhibitors had added to the concrete. 4. All steel bars in the concrete contained 0. 133 % of NaCl by weight except A_ 4 D_ 2 C_ 2 O_ 1 specimens have been observed some corrosion. And as the time has passed, the areas of corrosion on steel bar surfaces are becoming larger. 5. There have not been any significant differences in the effects of types of corrosion inhibitors on steel bar corrosion. 6. The effects of water-cement ratio on corrosion of steel bars are not obvious. 7. The beneficial effects of doubled dosage of corrosion inhibitors into concrete are observed on steel bar corrosion. The results of electrical potential measurments on the basis of Cu/CuSO_ 4 half cell are as follows. 1. It has not been decided yet that the standards of California Division of Highways on steel bar corrosion in concrete can be applicable to the RC structures in Okinawa Prefecture. 2. Steel bars in concrete need not be connected by metalic means each other when half cell potential measurment method is applied. 3. <b>Rusting</b> <b>spots</b> on steel bar surfaces have high potentials, and the electrical circuit directly contained a <b>rusting</b> <b>spot</b> exhibit high potentials in the sense of absolute value. 4. Almost rusting places have occured in the underside of steel bars, and the underside of the specimen has considerable larger cover depth over steel bars than the upperside. The electrical potentials measured on the underside of a specimen were always higher than on upperside. 5. Moisture condition of the specimen concrete has strong effect on measured potential values. 6. There have been no corrosion on the steel bars in the specimens which exhibit 0. 2 volt or less of electrical potential. 7. There have been very few specimens which exhibit the electrical potential value of 0. 3 volt or higher. 8. The almost specimens having corroded steel bars at 3 or 6 months after embedding exhibit 0. 20 to 0. 30 volt higher on the basis of Cu/CuSO_ 4 half cell...|$|R

50|$|The {{wire brush}} is {{primarily}} an abrasive implement, used for cleaning rust and removing paint. It {{is also used}} to clean surfaces and to create a better conductive area for attaching electrical connections, such as those between car battery posts and their connectors, should they accumulate a build-up of grime and dirt. When cleaning stainless steel, it is advisable to use a stainless steel bristle wire brush, as a plain carbon steel brush can contaminate the stainless steel and cause <b>rust</b> <b>spots</b> to appear. Brass bristle brushes are used on softer surfaces or in potentially flammable environments where non-sparking tools are required. Wire brushes are also used to clean the teeth of large animals, such as crocodiles and pigs. They are also used widely in surface engineering to clean the castings to paint the castings.|$|R

40|$|An {{outbreak}} of a previously unrecorded shell {{disease in the}} Portunid mud crab Scylla serrata from Gladstone Harbour, Port Curtis, Queensland, was investigated. The shell lesions called 'rust spots' appeared as orange coloured areas on the dorsal carapace, which in severe cases would ulcerate to expose underlying soft tissues. Through the examination of over 3000 mud crabs the disease prevalence in Port Curtis compared {{to a number of}} other locations in Queensland, was determined. Although the prevalence varied over the three successive sampling periods, the average prevalence (14. 3 %) in Gladstone Harbour was higher than the normal background prevalence of 5 % reported for shell disease in other crustacean populations. The lesion pathology of <b>rust</b> <b>spot</b> lesions was determined to be unique compared to the described pathology of other shell diseases, where there is an external erosion of the shell primarily due to pathogenic organisms. In non-perforated <b>rust</b> <b>spot</b> lesions, however, the external shell layers remain intact, with the lesions being restricted to the endocuticle layer and adjacent muscle attachments. As this layer is fonned in the postmoult period, it is likely the lesions are due to a defect in the manufacturing of this layer rather than one of pathogenic degeneration. The histopathology was supported by observations of diseased mud crabs held over a moulting period, in which lesions were also observed to form in the postmoult phase. Although chitinoclastic bacteria are considered to be the primary causative agents of shell disease in other crustaceans, {{there was no evidence of}} an infectious or parasitic agent being associated with the internal organs or carapace lesions of the diseased mud crabs examined. Furthermore, water and inoculation transmission experiments failed to reproduce the disease in juvenile mud crabs, sand crabs (Portunus pelagicus) or prawns (Penaeus japonicus). Although the nature of transmission experiments is that failure to reproduce the disease does not necessarily mean definitively a noninfectious cause, in combination with the pathology results they suggest that the cause of <b>rust</b> <b>spot</b> shell lesions is likely to be non-infectious. Haemolympl 1. assays were undertaken in an endeavour to measure the health status of diseased mud crabs. Results indicated elevated biochemical factors (two immune factors; antibacterial and phenoloxidase and one cellular enzyme; glutamate dehydrogenase) in both diseased and non-diseased crabs from Gladstone compared to the crabs from Ayr, a non-impacted site where no shell disease had been recorded. Levels in the diseased group of crabs were, however, depressed in comparison to their non-diseased cohorts from the same location, indicating a possible suppression of immune responses in diseased crabs. As shell disease had been associated with polluted environments, the metal analyses of diseased and non-diseased mud crab tissues from Gladstone were also compared with those from Ayr. Copper and zinc were elevated in mud crab hepatopancreas from Gladstone compared to Ayr in two consecutive years. Mean copper concentrations of Gladstone crabs were two to three times greater than for mud crabs sampled from other locations in Queensland. Total metal burdens were also elevated in the Gladstone mud crabs, with a high variation in the diseased mud crabs suggesting that this group may be unable to regulate metal levels. As copper and other metals have been demonstrated to cause inhibition of calcium uptake in other crustaceans, copper exposure experiments were conducted to test the hypothesis that copper could cause <b>rust</b> <b>spot</b> shell lesions by inhibiting calcium uptake in the developing postmoult cuticle. The experiment confirmed that calcium uptake into the carapace of softshelled juvenile, mud crabs was inhibited by sublethal copper exposure. The copper exposure experiments supported the pathology findings that <b>rust</b> <b>spot</b> shell lesions are likely to be caused by a defect in the manufacturing process of the endocuticle. The source of elevated copper accumulations in mud crabs, whether water or sediment borne or dietary was investigated. Water and sediments collected from mud crab burrows and analysed for metals determined that very low concentrations of metals exist in the burrows. A comparison was made between the diets of Gladstone mud crabs and those from Ayr to determine whether diet could be implicated as a source of elevated copper in the Gladstone mud crabs. Stable isotope analyses (carbon and nitrogen) of mud crab muscle was undertaken as an alternative to gut content analysis to determine the dietary sources of carbon and trophic position of crabs from the two areas. Although Gladstone and Ayr crabs had a similar trophic position the disparate delta carbon results suggests the diets of the crabs are different with a correlation established between delta carbon and copper concentration in the tissues. It is possible that diet may be a source of copper in Gladstone mud crabs through biomagnification along the food chain. Although results are preliminary, research into this poorly defined area of ecosystem health in Port Curtis should be continued...|$|R
