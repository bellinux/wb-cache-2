40|$|Purpose: In {{societies}} such as Australia with {{a strong}} multicultural makeup, culturally determined attitudes to genetics, testing, and counseling may be <b>incompatible</b> <b>with</b> current genetics <b>service</b> <b>provision.</b> Methods: An ethnographic investigation using purposive sampling to increase subject diversity was used to explore the range of beliefs about kinship and inheritance using Chinese-Australians as a case. Participants comprised a sample of 15 Chinese-Australians who had been recruited through several community-based organizations. Results: The level of acculturation does not correlate with holding beliefs about inheritance, kinship, and causes of hereditary cancer {{that are based on}} "Western" biomedical or traditional concepts. Mismatch between beliefs may exist within families that can impact participation in cancer genetic testing. Family history taking that underpins the surveillance, management, and referral to genetic counseling where there is a strong family history of breast, ovarian, or colorectal cancer can also be impacted unless recognition is made of the patrilineal concept of kinship prevalent in this Chinese-Australian community. Conclusion: This community-based study confirmed and validated views and beliefs on inheritance and kinship and inherited cancer attributed to senior family members by Chinese-Australians who attended cancer genetic counseling. Barriers to communication can occur where there may be incompatibility within the family between "Western" and traditional beliefs. The findings were used to develop strategies for culturally competent cancer genetic counseling with Australian-Chinese patients. These include nonjudgmental incorporation of their belief systems into the genetic counseling process and avoidance of stereotyping. They have also influenced the development of genetics education materials to optimize family history taking...|$|R

The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the reliability of the next generation FAMCARE tool, which was adapted to reflect inpatient and team-based care using palliative care services who are participating in the Australian Palliative Care Outcomes Collaboration. FAMCARE- 2 was distributed to a consecutive cohort of carers whilst in the caregiving role nationally. Analyses of internal consistency, generated structure and relationships of satisfaction <b>with</b> <b>service</b> <b>provision</b> by three demographic variables were undertaken. A total of 497 carers were recruited from 29 palliative care services across Australia, a mix of inpatient and community services. The scale achieved a high level of internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha coefficient of 0. 93) and item-to-total correlation coefficient of 0. 49 - 0. 72. Factor analysis of FAMCARE- 2 revealed a 4 -factor structure (management of physical symptoms and comfort, provision of information, family support and patient psychological care). Results of the survey indicated satisfaction <b>with</b> <b>service</b> <b>provision</b> across the FAMCARE- 2 subscales. Older, female carers without a culturally and linguistically diverse background were more satisfied <b>with</b> <b>service</b> <b>provision.</b> We conclude that FAMCARE- 2 is a psychometrically sound instrument useful for measuring family carer satisfaction <b>with</b> <b>service</b> <b>provision</b> in a variety of palliative care settings...|$|R

Design and Methods: Structural equation modeling was used with a sample of American Indians (N  =  860), aged 50 and older, who were consecutively discharged from hospitals across the United States over a 12 -month period. Results: As posited, addressing spiritual needs was positively associated with overall satisfac-tion <b>with</b> <b>service</b> <b>provision.</b> The relationship between spiritual needs and satisfaction was fully mediated by 4 variables: nursing staff, the discharge process, phy-sicians, and visitors.

Satisfaction <b>with</b> <b>service</b> <b>provision</b> {{has been found to}} be related to the expectations prior to receiving the service and the actual experience of the service. OBJECTIVES: To explore the expectations and satisfaction that caregivers of children with cerebral palsy havewhen they attend physiotherapy services. Methods: A qualitative study using two focus groups. A semi-structured interview guide was used to facilitate the focus group discussions. Data was collected and thematic analysis was undertaken PARTICIPANTS: Nine caregivers, five mother, three grand mothers and one grandfather, participated in the focus group discussions. SETTING: A cerebral palsy clinic in Kampala, Uganda. Intervention: No intervention but an interview schedule was used to obtain information. RESULTS: The caregivers were satisfied with seeing an improvement in the children's abilities, the outcome of the home programme and the assistive devices. Not all the caregivers were satisfied with the knowledge they had gained and the development of their skills. Caregivers were dissatisfied with regards to communication with the physiotherapists. CONCLUSION: Physiotherapy plays an important role in the improvement of cerebral palsy children's physical abilities and knowledge given to caregivers but physiotherapists need to improve in their communication skills...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the experience of}} South Asian carers of a person with cerebral palsy. Previous {{research in this area}} has failed to explore carers' perceptions of causation or their views on the quality of service support. Qualitative interviews were carried out with twenty carers in two localities in the north of England with the aim of providing in-depth contextualized data on their experiences over time, their attitudes towards cerebral palsy and their interactions <b>with</b> <b>service</b> <b>provision.</b> Results show that parents' views on causation differ markedly from explanations based on a medical, genetic model of cause. Parental attitudes towards cerebral palsy are shown to be influenced both by interactions <b>with</b> <b>service</b> professionals and by parents' ability to manage their situation. The absence of adequate material and emotional resources may foster a negative construction of disability by parents that, in turn, has detrimental effects on the individual with cerebral palsy. Parents' religious beliefs can act as a source of emotional support that helps them develop a constructive perspective on disability and deal with future uncertainty. We conclude that developments in <b>service</b> <b>provision</b> need to build on the perspectives of South Asian individuals and communities to respond effectively to their needs. ...|$|R
