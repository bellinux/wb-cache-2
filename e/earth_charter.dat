25|$|The University of Wisconsin- Oshkosh {{also offers}} many courses in many {{different}} disciplines that implement fair trade learning.

25|$|A Fair Trade University is {{one that}} {{develops}} all aspects of Fair Trade practices in their coursework. In 2007, the Director of the Environmental Studies program at the University of Wisconsin-Oshkosh, David Barnhill, started a push {{to become the first}} Fair Trade University. This push received positive reactions from faculty and students. To begin the process, the University as a whole agreed that it would need support from four institutional groups—faculty, staff, support staff, and students—to maximize support and educational efforts. The University officially endorsed the <b>Earth</b> <b>Charter</b> and created a Campus Sustainability Plan to align with the efforts of becoming a Fair Trade University.|$|E
500|$|The simple {{definition}} that sustainability {{is something that}} improves [...] "the quality of human life while living within the carrying capacity of supporting eco-systems", though vague, conveys the idea of sustainability having quantifiable limits. But sustainability is also a call to action, a task in progress or [...] "journey" [...] and therefore a political process, so some definitions set out common goals and values. The <b>Earth</b> <b>Charter</b> speaks of [...] "a sustainable global society founded on respect for nature, universal human rights, economic justice, and a culture of peace". This suggested a more complex figure of sustainability, which included {{the importance of the}} domain of 'politics'.|$|E

2500|$|At the 1992 Earth Summit in Brazil the Kari-Oka Declaration and the Indigenous Peoples <b>Earth</b> <b>Charter</b> were {{presented}} by the representatives of indigenous peoples from around the world. The Kari-Oka Declaration states [...] "We continue to maintain our rights as peoples despite centuries of deprivation, assimilation and genocide". The declaration also asserted that the genocide convention must be amended so as to include the genocide of indigenous peoples. The International Work Group for Indigenous Affairs (IWGIA) was founded in 1968 {{in response to the}} genocide of indigenous peoples in Brazil and Paraguay, and in 1969 Survival International was founded in London {{as a response to the}} atrocities, theft of land and genocide occurring in the Brazilian Amazon.

In India, Bharat Soka Gakkai (SGI in India) debuted the traveling exhibit [...] "Seeds of Hope", a joint initiative of SGI and <b>Earth</b> <b>Charter</b> International.

2500|$|It {{was argued}} at the World Summit on the Information Society {{and has been}} {{advocated}} by academics that global communication between individuals over the internet {{should be regarded as}} part of the Common Heritage of Mankind. From a spiritual or natural law perspective, {{it has been argued that}} for world peace to be achieved, laws and government policies should create the social preconditions whereby conscience, properly understood, can be delinked from (often destructive) fundamentalist religious ideologies, and associated with a universal consciousness, access to which is the Common Heritage of Humanity. Such thinking with associated implications about how a sustainable world in the future should be regulated is common to members of the Global Ecovillage Network. Equatorial countries have proposed that the geostationary orbit over the high seas should be declared the common heritage of mankind. It has been argued that a World government would manage common heritage areas according to principles of planetary democracy. The international law concept of common heritage of humanity has also been linked with cosmopolitanism. Common heritage of humanity as a concept of international law is supported by many of the principles in the <b>Earth</b> <b>Charter</b> civil society Initiative ...|$|E
2500|$|Some {{writers have}} {{misunderstood}} Naess, taking his ecosophy T, with its self-realization norm, as something meant {{to characterize the}} whole deep ecology movement {{as part of a}} single philosophy called [...] "deep ecology". Naess was not doing either of these. He emphasized that movements cannot be precisely defined, but only roughly characterized by very general statements. They are often united internationally by means of such principles as found in the United Nations (UN) <b>Earth</b> <b>Charter</b> (1980), and in UN documents about basic human rights. Naess was doing something more subtle than many thought. He was not putting forth a single worldview and philosophy of life that everyone should adhere to in support of the international ecology movement. Instead, he was making an empirical claim based on overwhelming evidence that global social movements, from the grass roots up, consist of people with very diverse religious, philosophical, cultural, and personal orientations. Nonetheless, they can agree on certain courses of action and certain broad principles, especially at the international level. As supporters of a given movement, they can treat one another with mutual respect. Because of these misunderstandings Naess introduced an apron diagram to clearly illustrate his subtle distinctions. The apron diagram is meant to illustrate logical, as distinct from genetic, relations between views and their connection with social movements, policies and practical actions. By [...] "logical relations" [...] this means verbally articulated relations between the premises and conclusions. There is collective cooperation on global concerns, and yet a great variety of ultimate premises from which each person or group acts locally. Within global movements there is diversity at the local level because each place and community is different and must adapt to its unique setting. Thus, Naess stressed that his ecosophy T is not meant to hold for everyone, since it is tailored to his very modest lifestyle suitable to a place such as Tvergastein. The ultimate premises for his whole view might be conceptually incompatible with those in someone else's whole views. But even if this is true, they could both support the platform principles of the deep ecology movement and other social-political global movements, such as for peace and social justice. In recognizing the principle that all living beings have intrinsic worth, there is an acknowledgement that they are good for their own sake. This does not mean committing to biocentric equality or egalitarianism between species. Within the vast diversity of living beings, there are complex relationships the range of which is predation, competition, cooperation, and symbiosis. Many think that symbiosis and complementarity are important values to embrace as they are consistent with global cooperation, community life, and support for the deep ecology movement platform.|$|E

At the age of 17, Severn participated in the Earth Summit of 1997 and made sure that concerns of young people were taken seriously {{in the process of}} drafting the <b>Earth</b> <b>Charter.</b> She contributed to the inclusion of principle 12c in {{the final version of the}} <b>Earth</b> <b>Charter</b> which stresses the need to: “Honor and support the young people of our communities, enabling them to fulfill their essential role in creating sustainable societies.” The launch of the <b>Earth</b> <b>Charter</b> Youth program was inspired by this ethical principle.
