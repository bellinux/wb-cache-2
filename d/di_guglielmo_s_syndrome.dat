40|$|Two {{patients}} with chronic myelocytic leukemia who developed an erythroblastic rather than a myeloblastic phase were studied with respect {{to whether or not}} the megaloblastic erythropoiesis was subject to normal control mechanisms. After transfusion, no significant reduction was observed in the percentage of nucleated erythroid precursors or of proerythroblasts in marrow or in blood reticulocytes. In one of the two patients, ferrokinetics and urinary erythropoietin levels were studied and were also compatible with the conclusions that erythropoiesis was autonomous in this rare syndrome. Three {{patients with}} clinical pictures compatible with <b>Di</b> <b>Guglielmo's</b> syndrome were studied as controls. As has been reported previously, erythropoiesis in this syndrome appeared to be responsive to normal control mechanisms. These data suggest that these two clinically similar syndromes, erythroblastic crisis of chronic myelocytic leukemia and <b>Di</b> <b>Guglielmo's</b> syndrome may represent qualitatively different defects in hematopoietic stem cells...|$|R
