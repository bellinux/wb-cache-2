25|$|Most labyrinthodonts {{had special}} sense organs in the skin, forming a lateral line organ for {{perception}} of water flow and pressure, like {{those found in}} fish {{and a number of}} modern amphibians. This would enable them to pick up the vibration of their prey and other waterborne sounds while hunting in murky, weed filled waters. Early labyrinthodont groups had massive stapes, likely primarily anchoring the brain case to the skull roof. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> some doubt whether early terrestrial labyrinthodonts had the stapes connected to a tympanum covering their otic notch, and if they had an aerial sense of hearing at all.

The Ohio Works club gained steam, however, and began to win games.

500|$|Edward Teller {{was opposed}} to the hearing, feeling it was {{improper}} to subject Oppenheimer to a security trial, but was torn by longstanding grievances against him. He was called by Robb to testify against Oppenheimer, and shortly before he appeared Robb showed Teller a dossier of items unfavorable to Oppenheimer. Teller testified that he considered Oppenheimer loyal, but that [...] "in {{a great number of}} cases, I have seen Dr. Oppenheimer act – I understand that Dr. Oppenheimer acted – in a way which for me was exceedingly hard to understand. I thoroughly disagreed with him in numerous issues and his actions frankly appeared to me confused and complicated. To this extent I feel that I {{would like to see the}} vital interests of this country in hands which I understand better, and therefore trust more." [...] Asked whether Oppenheimer should be granted a security clearance, Teller said that [...] "if <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> wisdom or judgement, as demonstrated by actions since 1945, then I would say one would be wiser not to grant clearance."

500|$|On 18 June {{the judge}} began his summing-up. He drew the jury's {{attention}} to the previous good character of the defendants, whom he characterised as [...] "men of hitherto unblemished reputation." [...] Cantley described Thorpe as [...] "a national figure with a very distinguished public record". The judge was scathing about the principal witnesses: Bessell was a [...] "humbug" [...] whose contract with The Sunday Telegraph was [...] "deplorable"; Scott was a fraud, a sponger, a whiner, a parasite—"but of course he could still be telling the truth. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> belief." [...] Newton was characterised as a perjurer and a chump, [...] "determined to milk the case {{as hard as he}} can." [...] The mystery surrounding the £20,000 that Thorpe had obtained from Hayward was dismissed as an irrelevance: [...] "The fact that a man obtains money by deceit does not [...] that the man {{was a member of a}} conspiracy." [...] Waugh felt that the judge's lack of even-handedness could well provoke a counteraction against the accused from the jury. The summing-up became the subject of a scathing parody by the satirist Peter Cook, written and delivered shortly after the trial at The Secret Policeman's Ball in aid of Amnesty International. Cook's version, according to Freeman and Penrose, was [...] "actually not that different from the original." ...|$|E
