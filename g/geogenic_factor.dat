30|$|In the Mount Cameroon area, Factor 1, which {{explains}} 24.68  % {{of the total}} variance, has strong positive loadings on Na and Cl and moderate loadings on K and EC. This association strongly suggests that PC 1 may represent an ionic enrichment factor: gentle slope and sluggish drainage conditions supporting longer residence time of groundwater, more water–rock interaction and higher solubility of minerals together with saline water leading to enrichment of Na and Cl (UNESCO 1984; Subba Rao et al. 1997). Enrichment of EC, Na, Cl and K is also possible, because {{of the effect of}} urban wastewaters (Subba Rao and Rao 1990; Somasundaram et al. 1993) and high rate of evapotranspiration (Drever 1988; Karanth 1991). Factor 2 has strong positive loadings on Ca and Mg, moderate loading on SiO 2 and weak loadings on HCO 3 and pH. It accounts for 17.14  % of the total variance of the data set. PC 2 represents the natural process by which water acquires its chemical characteristics through rock–water interactions, and hence a <b>geogenic</b> <b>factor.</b> Factor 3 which accounts for 13.43  % of the total variance has strong positive loadings on TDS and HCO 3 and moderate loadings on SO 4 and EC. PC 3 also seems to represent a <b>geogenic</b> <b>factor.</b> Factor 4 accounts for 9.92  % with strong positive loading on NO 3 only and weak loadings on SO 4 and SiO 2 (negative). PC 4 can be considered an anthropogenic factor. Factor 5 has strong loading on ORP, moderate loadings on DO, weak loading on PCO 2 and accounts for 8.49  % of the total variance. Factor 6 accounts for 7.12  % of variance of the data set having strong loading on temperature and moderate loading on pH. PC 5 and PC 6 {{can be attributed to the}} physico-chemical properties of recharge water.|$|E
30|$|The {{result of}} the {{principal}} component analysis/FA suggests that although two areas {{are part of the}} CVL, there are differences in their water chemistry that are very apparent. The major differences in the composition of groundwater from the two sampled areas are in the concentrations of nitrate, bicarbonate and sulfate. It can be concluded that three factors are responsible for the groundwater chemistry of the selected areas. The first factor represents the natural hydrogeochemical processes by which the groundwaters acquire their chemical characteristics by interaction with aquifer material and hence a <b>geogenic</b> <b>factor.</b> ‘Anthropogenic factor’ due to anthropogenic contamination from domestic and agricultural sources represents the second factor. Ionic enrichment due to the input of oceanic monsoon chloride-rich rainwater and the enrichment of Na and Cl from urban wastewaters is the third factor. In the Banana Plain, the geogenic and anthropogenic factors are the most preponderant, while in the Mount Cameroon area, the ionic enrichment and geogenic factors are the most important.|$|E
30|$|Dry {{climate is}} known to {{increase}} both the solubility {{and the rate of}} dissolution of soil salts and/or rock minerals. In addition to this, the climate also increases the rate of evaporation. The slope of the study area is gentle, which leads to slow movement of water. It causes a longer contact time of water with the aquifer material, thereby increasing the solubility of ions. The sand aquifer occurs mainly in the northern part, which reflects the higher rate of water circulation due to its high hydraulic conductivity. Thus, it supports a lesser solubility of ions. The increase of clay content from the northern to the southern part tends to slow water movement, because of its low hydraulic conductivity. This not only causes the increase of ions solubility, but also supports anion exchange. The occurrence of the Charnockite Group of rocks in the southern part (especially in and around Ongole) shows low weathered and fractured portions, thereby causing a low hydraulic conductivity. In addition to this, the rocks contain the F−-bearing minerals (apatite, hornblende and biotite). The influences of salt pans and aqua-cultural activity on the groundwater system are dominant in the central part, while the impact of domestic wastes, leakage of septic tanks and agro-chemicals on the groundwater body is predominant in the remaining part. Thus, the soil–rock–water interaction appears as a prime <b>geogenic</b> <b>factor</b> for a source of F− and the influences of anthropogenic activities as a supplementary factor for further increase of F− in the groundwater system. This hypothesis is explained below, using binary diagrams, for understanding the factors that control the F− content in the groundwater in the study area.|$|E
40|$|This {{study shows}} that the <b>geogenic</b> <b>factors</b> landform, {{lithology}} and underlying mineral deposits (expressed by elevated metal concentrations in overlying soils) are key-drivers of microbial community diversity in naturally metal-rich Australian soils with different landuse, i. e., agriculture vs. natural bushland. 168 soil samples were obtained from two metal-rich provinces in Australia, i. e., the Fifield Au-Pt-field (New South Wales) and the Hillside Cu-Au-U-rare-earth-element (REE) deposit (South Australia). Soils were analyzed using three-domain multiplex terminal-restriction-fragment-length-polymorphism (M-TRFLP) and PhyloChip microarrays. <b>Geogenic</b> <b>factors</b> were determined using field-mapping techniques and analyses of > 50 geochemical parameters. At Fifield, microbial communities differed significantly with <b>geogenic</b> <b>factors</b> and equally with landuse (P 0. 2 m) differed significantly with lithology and the mineral deposit (P< 0. 05). Across both sites, elevated metal contents in soils overlying mineral deposits were selective {{for a range of}} bacterial taxa, most importantly Acidobacteria, Bacilli, and Beta- and Epsilon-Proteobacteria. In conclusion, long-term <b>geogenic</b> <b>factors</b> can be equally important in determining soil microbial community diversity than landuse. Frank Reith, Carla M.

40|$|Links between {{microbial}} community assemblages and <b>geogenic</b> <b>factors</b> were assessed in 187 soil samples collected from four metal-rich provinces across Australia. Field-fresh soils and soils incubated with soluble Au(III) complexes were analysed using three-domain multiplex-terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism, and phylogenetic (PhyloChip) and functional (GeoChip) microarrays. <b>Geogenic</b> <b>factors</b> of soils were determined using lithological-, geomorphological- and soil-mapping combined with analyses of 51 geochemical parameters. Microbial communities differed significantly between landforms, soil horizons, lithologies {{and also with}} the occurrence of underlying Au deposits. The strongest responses to these factors, and to amendment with soluble Au(III) complexes, was observed in bacterial communities. PhyloChip analyses revealed a greater abundance and diversity of Alphaproteobacteria (especially Sphingomonas spp.), and Firmicutes (Bacillus spp.) in Au-containing and Au(III) -amended soils. Analyses of potential function (GeoChip) revealed higher abundances of metal-resistance genes in metal-rich soils. For example, genes that hybridised with metal-resistance genes copA, chrA and czcA of a prevalent aurophillic bacterium, Cupriavidus metallidurans CH 34, occurred only in auriferous soils. These data help establish key links between <b>geogenic</b> <b>factors</b> and the phylogeny and function within soil microbial communities.

The results of these experiments show that the Lottenbachtal is significantly affected by abandoned coal mines and diversity of land use. These effects represent by additional loads of the chemical elements, which include calcium, magnesium, sodium, potassium, chloride, sulphate, nitrate, carbonate, iron, aluminium and zinc.

30|$|The terms ‘strong’, ‘moderate’ and ‘weak’ {{as applied}} to factor {{loadings}} refer to absolute loading values of > 0.75, 0.75 – 0.5 and 0.5 – 0.3, respectively (Liu et al. 2003). For the Banana Plain, Factor 1 which explains 36.00  % {{of the total variance}} has strong positive loadings on TDS, HCO 3, Ca and TH, moderate loading on EC, Eh (negative), Na, Mg and SiO 2 and weak loading on SO 4. This PC can be ascribed to natural hydrogeochemical evolution of groundwater by groundwater–geological medium interactions and hence a <b>geogenic</b> <b>factor.</b> Factor 2 accounts for 17.52  % of the variance of the data set. It has strong positive loadings on NO 3 and Cl and weak loadings on Mg and Na. This PC indicates anthropogenic contamination from domestic and agricultural sources and thus can be termed ‘the anthropogenic factor’ (Esteller and Andreu 2005). Factor 3 which accounts for 9.99  % of the total variance has strong positive loading on temperature only, moderate loadings on pH and PCO 2 (negative) and weak loading on SiO 2 (negative). PC 3 seems to represent recharge water because of positive loadings on temperature and pH which could be acquired during infiltration of rainwater through soil zones. The loadings on PCO 2 and SiO 2 represent the interaction between CO 2 -charged recharge water and basaltic rocks. Factor 4 has strong positive loading on DO and weak loading on SiO 2 and accounts for 7.83  % of the total variance of the data set. Factor 5 accounts for 6.13  % of the total variance and has a strong positive loading on K with weak (negative) loading on SiO 2. Major cations including Ca, Na and Mg have positive correlations with alkalinity (HCO 3) and EC (Table  3). This can be explained by acidic hydrolysis of mafic minerals in basaltic rocks. This hydrolysis reaction consumes water and acid that might have originated from CO 2 and increased the pH, alkalinity and cation concentration of groundwater.|$|E
40|$|Evapotranspiration is a nexus for {{planetary}} {{energy and}} carbon cycles, as yet poorly constrained. Here I use stable isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen to partition flux of water due to plant transpiration from the direct evaporative flux from soils, water bodies and plant. The study areas, Langat and Kelantan watersheds represent examples of domains {{dominated by the}} respective Southwest and Northeast monsoons on {{the two sides of}} the main orographic barrier (Titiwangsa mountain range). Mean annual rainfall for the Langat watershed, obtained from 30 years of hydrological data, is 2145 ± 237 mm. Tentatively, 48 % of this precipitation returns to the atmosphere via transpiration (T), with 33 % partitioned into discharge (Q), 8 % into interception (In), and 11 % into evaporation (Ed). In the Kelantan watershed, the mean annual rainfall, also based on the 30 year hydrological data, is 2383 ± 120 mm. Similar to Langat, the T accounts for 43 % of precipitation (P), 45 % is discharged into South China Sea (Q), 12 % partitioned into interception (In) and tentatively 0 % for evaporation (Ed). Ed for the Langat watershed represents only a small proportion in terms of volumetric significance, up to almost ~ 11 % with strong effect on the isotopic fingerprints of waters associated with the summer Southwest Monsoon (SWM). Note, however, that insignificant Ed for the Kelantan watershed may be an artefact of rain and river water sampling at only coastal downstream portion of the watershed. High humidity (80 %) also was recorded for the Malaysian Peninsula watershed. 	T appropriates about half of all solar energy absorbed by the continents, here ~ 1000 * 103 g H 2 O m- 2 yr- 1 similar to other tropical regions at 900 - 1200 * 103 g H 2 O m- 2 yr- 1. The associated carbon fluxes are ~ 1300 g C m- 2 yr- 1, independent of P. Vegetation responses to solar irradiance, via T and photosynthesis reflects the importance of stomatal regulation of the water and carbon fluxes. In order to maintain high transpiration in the tropical region, “constant” water supply is required for continuous pumping of water that delivers nutrients to the plant, suggesting that water and carbon cycle are co-driven by the energy of the sun. The existence of the water conveyor belt may be precondition for nutrient delivery, hence operation of the carbon cycle. Potentially, this may change our perspective on the role that biology plays in the water cycle. In such perspective, the global water cycle is the medium that redistributes the incoming solar energy across the planet, and the anatomical structures of plants then help to optimize the loop of energy transfer via evaporation and precipitation in the hydrologic cycle. The main features of aquatic geochemistry of the Langat and Kelantan rivers inferred from the Principal Component Analysis are controlled by three components that explain 80 % and 82 % of total variances. These components are reflecting of the <b>geogenic</b> <b>factor</b> with superimposed pollution, the latter particularly pronounced in urbanized sections of the Langat river and dominant in downstream of the Kelantan river. There is no correlation between seasonal variations in major ion chemistry and environmental variables such as precipitation, discharge, temperature or solar activity...|$|E

Hydrogeologically the study area belongs to Indo-Gangetic alluvial plains, which are dominated by clay-silt, clay and grey micaceous sand formations. Clay rich formations are rich in fluorine and other salts and their weathering is most probably causing the continuous escalation in the fluoride and salinity concentration in groundwater.

Soil genesis and development of representive residual pedons were studied for each parent material. Total content of Si, Al, Ca, Mg, Fe, Mn, K, Na, Ti and P of soil horizons were measured and compared to the geochemical and mineralogical composition of parent materials. Maximum concentrations of Fe 2 O 3 and MgO {{were found in the}} soils derived from Pe and Do; however, these soils had low content of SiO 2 and Al 2 O 3, which is in conformity with the geochemical composition of the parent rocks. On the contrary, FeCBD content of these soils was lowest, indicating the low degree of soil development and, by the same fact, the importance of inheritance factor in soil Fe concentration. However, comparison of total Fe and FeCBD in Li 1, Sh 2 and To 2 revealed that relative development of these pedons is higher than the others. Silicon depletion in Ph 1, To 2 and Sh 2 pedons, relative to parent rocks, is higher than in Pe and Do pedons. However, this element is enriched in Li pedons. MnO content of Pe and Do pedons is governed by <b>geogenic</b> <b>factors,</b> while in Sh pedons, pedogenic factors, especially redox conditions, play the major role.

Hence, {{it is essential to}} protect the fresh groundwater as per the quality and quantity points of view. In the last decade, the growing population has increased the stress on groundwater resources due to which the quality has degraded due to anthropogenic as well as <b>geogenic</b> <b>factors.</b> The contamination of groundwater in many parts of India is caused by the disposal of domestic waste (Pujari et al. 2007, 2012; Jangam et al. 2015). The anthropogenic factors are, namely, the disposal of untreated industrial and municipal wastewater, application of fertilizers and pesticides in the agricultural fields, leakage from underground storage tanks, underground pipelines, and plumes generation from landfill site and septic tank effluents. The problem assumes more importance when proper safeguards are not in place during the disposal of waste. The groundwater pollution caused by On-site sanitation was a major concern in many urban and peri-urban areas when organized sewerage is lacking and where the drinking water requirements are met from groundwater sources. The contamination is likely to take place {{in the event of a}} pathway existing between a source, i.e., On-site sanitation system and a receptor, i.e., groundwater source. The growing population has led to adopt the On-site sanitation system as compared to conventional sewerage. The On-site sanitation system poses a significant adverse impact on the groundwater quality in the long run. It assumes more importance when the geological settings favor the migration of contaminants. The problem becomes alarming when the groundwater table is shallow.

Nitrate concentrations, together with physical-chemical parameters and major anions and cations, were determined in 49 spring waters flowing out of granitic and metamorphic rocks in Sardinia (Italy). Nitrate in the spring waters was in the range of < 0. 1 mg/L to 47 mg/L, a range similar to that observed in 404 rain samples collected in Sardinia, with highest values mostly occurring in spring waters located downstream villages. The median nitrate might be considered an estimate of background values in the study area. The median nitrate in waters from metamorphic aquifers was 1. 9 mg/L, close to the 1. 3 mg/L median value observed in the Sardinian rain. The median values of nitrate in waters from granitic aquifers was higher, i. e. 7. 0 mg/L. These results were compared with an historical dataset consisting of 183 spring water samples collected between 2000 and 2012 in the same area. Again, nitrate in spring waters from granitic rocks was higher (maximum value 80 mg/L, median: 7. 6 mg/L) than nitrate in spring waters from metamorphic rocks (maximum value 48 mg/L, median 1. 5 mg/L). <b>Geogenic</b> <b>factors</b> may affect nitrate occurrence in groundwater and might explain the higher median values observed in springs flowing out of granitic rocks. In the study area, the soils developed on granitic rocks had higher permeability and lower cation exchange capacity, as compared to soils developed on metamorphic rocks.

A total of 210 groundwater samples were collected from 35 shallow wells (3. 15 – 7. 86 m) within the residential, commercial, industrial and agricultural areas of the metropolis during the dry and wet seasons. The average daily dose intake (ADD), hazard quotient (HQ) and hazard index (HI) of arsenic, antimony and selenium exposure in groundwater were calculated from these four studied areas for children and adults. Results. Average concentrations of arsenic, antimony and selenium in groundwater ranged between 2. 17 ± 3. 49 to 33. 8 ± 37. 2 μg/L, 13. 5 ± 15. 0 to 33. 2 ± 36. 8 μg/L and 7. 33 ± 6. 22 to 46. 3 ± 22. 4 μg/L, respectively. A corresponding analysis relay plot showed the order of occurrence of these trace metals in groundwater to be antimony>selenium>arsenic. The principal component analysis biplot showed that arsenic, antimony and selenium were fairly distributed {{in all of the}} study areas, suggesting the influence of <b>geogenic</b> <b>factors.</b> A total of 74. 3 % of sampling locations had antimony levels slightly above the World Health Organization (WHO) safe limit of 20 μg/L.

MarszałThe Łódź basin, and {{particularly}} its north-eastern fragment, {{has a very}} high economic importance in terms of abundance, still good quality of groundwaters, and their availability in the watershed zone. More than 150 years of anthropogenic pressure is currently only recorded in the qualitative aspect of groundwaters, affected by both the anthropopressure <b>factors</b> and <b>geogenic</b> conditions. The re sults of the regional monitoring, supplemented with own research of the Laboratory of Geology of the University of Łódź, show substan tial pollution of shallow aquifers. This is determined {{by a number of}} factors, not always related to urban landscape. Due to their nat ural conditions, deeper Cretaceous aquifers are much less polluted, although the pressure is higher within the small Łódź basin than outside of it. This relates to the forms and intensity of land manage ment, particularly in zones of alimentation of aquifers. The quality of groundwaters of the Łódź basin is also determined by <b>geogenic</b> <b>factors,</b> as exemplified by the Lower Cretaceous aquifer, locally of geothermal character. Contaminants penetrating groundwaters lead to the hydro chemical differentiation of waters in the same aquifer, particularly distinguishing its uppermost layer. Moreover, they cause the degra dation of other elements of the hydrosphere used by man, such as rivers right from their springs, and waters retained in usually small reservoirs. A change in the conditions of transport of pollutants re sults in the activation of some of their forms, e. g. biogenic substanc es, and leads to secondary changes in the quality of stagnant waters. From the perspective of time and area in which the Laboratory of Geology of the University of Łódź conducted research on ground waters in the years 1993 – 2013, a diminishment of old threats within cities, and activation of new ones outside of cities is observed, often in areas of alimentation of Cretaceous aquifers {{in the eastern part of}} the Łódź agglomeration. In the conditions of limited possibilities of registration of groundwater quality by the currently functioning regional monitoring system, and total withdrawal of elements of the national monitoring from the Łódź region, the functioning of our unit is supplemented by the system of identification and registra tion of groundwater quality in the region of the small Łódź basin.

The geometric means of indoor thoron concentration (with geometric standard deviations in brackets) in winter, spring, summer and autumn were obtained to be: 39 Bq m− 3 (3. 4), 32 Bq m− 3 (2. 8), 18 Bq m− 3 (2. 8), 31 Bq m− 3 (2. 9), respectively. Seasonal variations of thoron appear lower than those of radon. The seasonal corrected annual mean concentration ranges between 3 and 272 Bq m− 3 with a geometric mean of 28 Bq m− 3 (2. 12). A detailed statistical analysis of the <b>geogenic</b> and building <b>factors</b> which influence the indoor thoron concentration is also reported. This survey represents the first national survey on indoor thoron in continental Europe...|$|R
40|$|The {{quality of}} {{drinking}} water is a powerfulenvironmental determinant for human health. Assured drinking water is afoundation for the prevention and control of waterborne diseases. All over theworld, human population has inadequate access to potable water and use sourcescontaminated with disease vectors, pathogens or unacceptable levels of toxins orsuspended solids. Drinking or using such water leads to widespread chronicillness and is a major cause for death. Reduction of waterborne diseases is amajor public health goal for a civilized society. WQI values are computed forwater quality measures in Torehalla. In the present investigation 71 groundwatersamples have been analysed and interpreted. WQI values {{in the study area}} variesbetween 39. 6 to 201. 7 with an average of 86. 4. According to the WQIclassification, about 7 % of the total groundwater samples represent excellentwater quality, 69. 1 % as good, 22. 53 % as poor and about 1. 37 % as very poor waterin quality. The higher percent of WQI values in poor and very poor water qualityclasses is mainly due to <b>geogenic</b> and anthropogenic <b>factors.</b> Although the waterquality is mainly controlled by rocks and soil chemistry, excessive utilizationof agro inputs has also compounded to this problem. The results obtained fromthe study indicates that groundwater is generally suitable for both drinking anddomestic purpose, except in few cases...|$|R
40|$|The main aim of {{this article}} was to assess the {{atmospheric}} pollution with heavy metals due to copper mining Bucim near Radovis, the Republic of Macedonia. The open pit and mine waste and flotation tailings are continually exposed to open air, which leads to winds carrying the fine particles into the atmosphere. Samples of attic dust were examined as historical archives of mine emissions, with the aim of elucidating the pathways of pollution. Dust was collected from the attics of 29 houses, built between 1920 and 1970. Nineteen elements (Ag, Al, As, Ba, Ca, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Li, Fe, K, Mg, Mn,Na, Ni, Pb, Sr, and Zn) were analyzed by atomic emission spectrometry with inductively coupled plasma. The obtained values of the investigated elements in attic dust samples were statistically processed using nonparametric and parametric analysis. Factor analysis revealed three factors governing the source of individual chemical elements. Two of them grouping Ca, Li, Mg, Mn, and Sr (Factor 1) and Co, Cr, and Ni (Factor 2) can be characterized as <b>geogenic.</b> The third <b>factor</b> grouping As, Cu, and Pb is anthropogenic and mirrors dust fallout from mining operation and from flotation tailings. Maps of areal deposition were prepared for this group of elements, from which correlation of these anthropogenic born elements was confirmed...|$|R
30|$|The {{study area}} is a fast-growing {{suburban}} district where inhabitants depend on both surface water and groundwater resources for drinking and domestic purposes. Recently, Egbunike (2018) assessed the water types and suitability of groundwater resources in Umunya area for drinking purpose using limited approach. Nevertheless, the literatures reporting on the hydrogeochemistry and quality of water resources in Umunya district are very scarce. This makes it necessary and compelling that a more sophisticated approach be employed to examine both natural (<b>geogenic)</b> and anthropogenic <b>factors</b> that influence and govern the hydrogeochemistry and quality of water resources (surface and groundwater) in this district. It is, therefore, {{in line with this}} conviction that the aim of this work was built. To that end, this study evaluates the hydrogeochemistry, quality and suitability of these natural resources for drinking and domestic purposes, using a more integrated, sophisticated approach. Moreover, this study also examines the various natural and anthropogenic factors that affect the hydrogeochemistry, quality and suitability of the water resources. The methods integrated to achieve the aim of this work included geochemical investigations, stoichiometry, WQI, multivariate statistical analyses (correlation matrix analysis and principal component analysis) and health risk analysis. This research is important because the information provided in it would help government and policy makers in the water resources planning and management for the Umunya district.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Different {{sampling}} media (moss, lichen and attic dust) {{were used}} for monitoring the distribution of 15 elements, including certain trace elements, {{in the vicinity of}} an intensively exploited copper mine in the east of the Republic of Macedonia. Moss species (Hypnum cupressiforme and Campothecium lutescens), epiphytic lichens (Hypogymnia physodes and Evernia prunastri) and attic dust were collected for comparative analysis for monitoring air pollution. In both cases (lithological and anthropogenic affected areas) for the distribution of elements, the sampling media follows the expression capabilities: attic dust > moss > lichens. Enrichment factors M/L—moss vs. lichen, for plant response to elements distribution and D/L—attic dust vs. lichen, for historical response of elements distribution were significant for Cu and Ni, which were singled out as the main markers for anthropogenic and <b>geogenic</b> distribution. The <b>factor</b> analysis highlighted <b>geogenic</b> (F 1 : Ni-Cr-Cd-Fe-Al-K-Mn-Zn) and anthropogenic (F 2 : As-Cu-Pb) association of elements from three types of media samples. For anthropogenic affected areas, T value and F value for Cu content were significant at p < 0. 05 and higher enrichment factors were obtained for lichen, moss and attic dust media (3. 8, 5. 0 and 5. 7, respectively). Spatial distribution for element deposition (with emphasis on Cu and Ni) is not disturbed by the significant differences in the sampling media matrix. Treated sample materials (attic dust, moss, lichen) are shown to be useful in determining an anthropogenic impact, as well as the chemical properties or geological background on orographic diverse terrain in the presence of complex geological structure...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2016 - 12 Arsenic {{contamination}} of groundwater {{is a global}} concern, with environmental presence attributable to both <b>geogenic</b> and anthropogenic <b>factors.</b> Presence in the environment threatens both public and environmental health. In this study, we explored both the mobilization and sequestration of arsenic in subsurface environments, both in in situ treatment systems that sought to sequester the arsenic by intentional interference with the biochemistry and in natural systems where anthropogenic activities hold the potential to inadvertently exacerbate existing public health problems caused by arsenic contamination. Our investigation into these arsenic stabilization mechanisms involved fieldwork and laboratory-based experiments and analysis methods to study three different groundwater systems. The fieldwork collected sediment and water samples from these different locations. Laboratory batch incubation experiments were conducted for two locations, to elucidate arsenic mobilization processes, with further laboratory characterizations of these experimental materials and those collected from the third site, including solid-phase speciation of arsenic and iron in sediment, molecular characterization of microbially-altered organic carbon, and isotopic characterization of carbon pools. Our work conducted on in situ treatment systems analyzed two different treatments that utilized induced sulfate reduction (ISR) in permeable reactive barriers (PRB) {{as a means to}} form sulfide and iron minerals that incorporate or sorb arsenic, removing it from groundwater. Our work found that PRBs that are formed using zerovalent iron (ZVI) in conjunction with the sulfate and carbon materials are more effective at arsenic removal, likely due to the formation of more stable minerals. Our data suggest that arsenic stabilization in non-ZVI PRBs are primarily controlled by arsenic-sulfide associations, while ZVI PRBs saw greater formation of iron sulfides and iron oxyhydroxides. Our investigations into mechanisms responsible for subsurface mobilization of arsenic into groundwater were primarily driven by laboratory incubation experiments of aquifer materials collected from arsenic-contaminated locations. Materials collected from an aquifer in Bangladesh were incubated and sampled over one-half year, with the goal of better understanding the labile organic carbon available to fuel reductive dissolution processes that drive arsenic mobilization. Ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry revealed a large, heterogeneous pool of bioavailable organic carbon in the sediment porewater. Despite the substantial microbial degradation of this carbon pool, most of the compounds were those types traditionally considered recalcitrant or less energetically-favorable. Our results lend weight to an ever-growing shift in understanding of carbon bioavailability. Additionally, both this sediment porewater and the aquifer recharge waters contained many organosulfur compounds, suggesting that the presence of such compounds may potentially be useful as a fingerprint for organic matter derived from organic-rich, anaerobic subsurface environments. The existence of this pool of organic carbon in subsurface sediments that holds the potential to fuel microbial reactions that impact groundwater quality, led to our final investigation of a process that may occur in situ and mobilize such a pool: microbial priming. Laboratory incubations of aquifer sediment from Cambodia were conducted to show the occurrence of microbial priming and its potential to release mobilize arsenic in the subsurface. The results did not show explicit evidence of priming, but did show an increase in the onset of microbial activity in treatments amended with labile organic carbon. Moreover, even in treatments amended with high concentrations of labile carbon, notable arsenic mobilization was not observed. More energetically-favorable electron acceptors, iron and manganese, were reduced and dissolved into solution, but at later timepoints in the experiment began to decrease in dissolved concentrations, indicating mineral precipitation...|$|R
