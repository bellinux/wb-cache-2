50|$|The London Rubber Company {{was founded}} in 1915 by LA Jackson, selling {{imported}} condoms and barber shop supplies. Subsequently renamed London International Group (LIG) plc, it developed a consumer based product portfolio, spanning health and beauty products including Durex, medical markets with Regent surgical gloves, and business-to-business with Marigold <b>Industrial</b> <b>Gloves.</b>|$|E
5000|$|From 2002 to 2004 the Company {{disposed}} of its medical and industrial products {{to focus on}} its two main brands {{as part of a}} [...] "strategic repositioning". The first major diversification was of 21 OTC brands to Thornton & Ross Limited in March 2002. Marigold <b>Industrial</b> <b>Gloves</b> was sold to Comasec SAS in November 2003. The wound management products were sold to Medlock Medical Limited (owned by Apax Partners) in May 2004. Regent Infection Control (makers of Biogel surgical gloves and Hibi antiseptics) was also sold to a business owned by Apax Partners in May 2004 for £173 million. The final sale was of the minor Silipos business to Langer Inc in October 2004.|$|E
50|$|The city lacks {{any major}} sources of commerce. The largest {{business}} is Best Glove, Inc., a medical and <b>industrial</b> <b>glove</b> supplier.|$|R
50|$|In the 15th century, Saxons built {{a church}} (called St. Andrews Church) {{with a tall}} spire but this was {{destroyed}} in a great storm of 1733. Shortly after this disaster, the spire was rebuilt. It was constructed by using the ingenious method of kite flying to carry up the stones. Worcester people took the new masterpiece to their hearts and named it the 'Glover's Needle'. This name came from the <b>industrial</b> <b>glove</b> making that was executed in Worcester. The entire structure measures approximately 245 feet. It is the tallest spire {{in the country to}} have such a narrow angle of taper. In the 1920s the slum housing which crowded round the church was demolished. The congregation of the church was thus reduced by a large degree. The church fell into decay, had an overgrown churchyard, few parishioners and a tiny parish of five acres. In the 1940s, the council accepted the Bishop of Worcester's offer of the church. They decided to demolish the church and create a garden of remembrance to replace it. However the council decided to leave the tower and spire, freestanding. Thus St Andrew's church was demolished in 1949.Glovers needle is also called St.Andrews spire.|$|R
50|$|In 1977, {{the company}} {{developed}} a non-metallic cut-resistant protective glove for meat processors and <b>industrial</b> applications. The <b>glove</b> had greater dexterity and was warmer to wear than the chain-mail glove products then in use. It manufactured these gloves for 17 years until selling the product line to Wells Lamont in 1996.|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} the effects of wearing typical <b>industrial</b> <b>gloves</b> on hand performance capabilities (muscle activity, wrist posture, touch sensitivity, hand grip and forearm torque strength) and subjective assessments for an extended duration of performing a common assembly task, wire tying with pliers, which requires a combination of manipulation and force exertion. Three commercially available gloves (cotton, nylon and nitrile gloves) were tested and compared with a bare hand condition while participants performed the simulated assembly task for 2 h. The results showed that wearing gloves significantly increased the muscle activity, wrist deviation, and discomfort whilst reducing hand grip strength, forearm torque strength and touch sensitivity. The combined {{results showed that the}} length of time for which gloves are worn does affect hand performance capability and that gloves need to be evaluated in a realistic working context. The results are discussed in terms of selection of gloves for industrial assembly tasks involving pliers...|$|E
40|$|Daily working {{activities}} and functions require a high contribution of hand and forearm muscles in executing grip force. To study {{the effects of}} wearing different gloves on grip strength, under a variety of hand skin temperatures, an assessment of the maximum grip strength was performed with 32 healthy male workers with a mean age (standard deviation) of 30. 44 (5. 35) years wearing five <b>industrial</b> <b>gloves</b> at three hand skin temperatures. Their ages and anthropometric characteristics including body mass index (BMI), hand length, hand width, hand depth, hand palm, and wrist circumference were measured. The hand was exposed to different bath temperatures (5 °C, 25 °C, and 45 °C) and hand grip strength was measured using a Jamar hydraulic hand dynamometer with and without wearing the gloves (chemical protection glove, rubber insulating glove, anti-vibration impact glove, cotton yarn knitted glove, and RY-WG 002 working glove). The data were analyzed using the Shapiro–Wilk test, Pearson correlation coefficient, Tukey test, and analysis of variance (ANOVA) of the within-subject design analysis. The results showed that wearing gloves significantly affected the maximum grip strength. Wearing the RY-WG 002 working glove produced a greater reduction on the maximum grip when compared with the bare hand, while low temperatures (5 °C) had a significant influence on grip when compared to medium (25 °C) and high (45 °C) hand skin temperatures. In addition, participants felt more discomfort in both environmental extreme conditions. Furthermore, they reported more discomfort while wearing neoprene, rubber, and RY-WG 002 working gloves...|$|E
5000|$|Saint-Junien {{is a city}} {{of strong}} {{communist}} tradition, marked by the municipality of Roland Mazoin, (mayor from 1965 to 2001), now headed by Pierre Allard, member of the [...] (locally implanted party born of a split with the PCF). This peculiarity is largely inherited from the importance of the <b>industrial</b> sector of <b>glove</b> making, especially in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, like Limoges.|$|R
40|$|MOST hand infections {{cannot be}} traced to a precise source, though {{it is likely that}} in all of them a minor, unnoticed breach of skin surface has allowed entry of pyogenic organisms. Prophylaxis is {{therefore}} difficult, but attention to pricks, small cuts or abrasions as soon as they are sustained, simple cleansing or the early application of a protective dressing will help to reduce them. <b>Industrial</b> and household <b>gloves</b> and barrier creams are also useful. The chance of a minor injury giving rise to a hand infection is increased in those whose skin habitually harbours pathogens. Williams and Miles (I 949) showed that hand infections after minor injury occur more often in carriers of staphylococcus aureus, and the infectin...|$|R
