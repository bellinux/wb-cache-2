5|$|David Furness {{stood for}} the British National Party. At {{the time of}} the {{election}} he was the party's organiser in west London and had stood in the 2011 Feltham and Heston by-election. The British National Party were de-registered by the Electoral Commission on 8 January 2016 for failing to pay the required registration <b>fee</b> <b>to</b> the Electoral Commission, putting Furness' candidacy at risk.

5|$|Despite Riley {{serving as}} the act's main draw, he was not {{permitted}} to become an equal partner in the venture. Nye and Pond both received {{a percentage of the}} net profit, while Riley was paid a flat rate for each performance. In addition, because of Riley's past agreements with the Redpath Lyceum Bureau, he was required to pay half of his <b>fee</b> <b>to</b> his agent Amos Walker. This caused the other men to profit more than Riley from his own work.|$|E
50|$|The American Arbitration Association charges {{two types}} of <b>fees</b> <b>to</b> parties in an arbitration: {{administrative}} <b>fees</b> <b>to</b> the AAA for its case management services and arbitrator <b>fees</b> <b>to</b> pay for the services of the arbitrator. Prior to March 1, 2013, the AAA had a tiered fee structure that capped the <b>fees</b> charged <b>to</b> a consumer claiming only monetary damages of up to $75,000 and required the business to pay the remaining fees (see below). Under the pre-2013 rules, unless the parties agreed otherwise, the arbitrator had the authority <b>to</b> reallocate the <b>fees</b> in the award.|$|R

5|$|U.S. President Abraham Lincoln {{diverted}} several regiments of militia {{and volunteer}} troops after the Battle of Gettysburg {{to control the}} city. The rioters were overwhelmingly working-class men, mostly Irish or of Irish descent, who feared free black people competing for work and resented that wealthier men, who could afford to pay a $300 (equivalent to $9,157 in 2017) commutation <b>fee</b> <b>to</b> hire a substitute, were spared from the draft.|$|E
5|$|A Welsh shipbroker, W. J. Orders, {{organised}} {{a collection}} fund {{on the floor}} of the Cardiff Coal Exchange and floated a public testimonial of one shilling. The national response was considerable and within weeks the total was into hundreds of pounds. This drew the Welsh Football Union (WFU) into a confrontation with the IRFB, as rule 2 on professionalism stated that no player was allowed to receive money from his club, or any member of his club, for services rendered to football. The fund could have been seen as a professional <b>fee</b> <b>to</b> Gould, henceforth making him ineligible to play for his country. The WFU argued that the money raised was not given by the club, but rather an outpouring of thanks from the Welsh public to a national hero.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} to Puerto Rico in 1859, Betances established {{a very successful}} surgery and ophthalmology practice in Mayagüez. Even fierce political enemies such as Spanish pro-monarchy journalist José Pérez Morís regarded Betances as the best surgeon in Puerto Rico at the time. His good reputation in Puerto Rico would survive his stay in the island nation for many years. In 1895, while Betances was living in Paris, the manufacturers of the Emulsión de Scott (a codfish liver oil product that is still sold today, manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline in modern times), paid an endorsement <b>fee</b> <b>to</b> Betances to have him appear on advertisements on Spanish language magazines and newspapers all over New York City and the Caribbean, based on his solid reputation as a doctor.|$|E

5|$|An {{offshoot}} of the work at MIT {{was the beginning of}} digital circuit design theory by one of Bush's graduate students, Claude Shannon. Working on the analytical engine, Shannon described the application of Boolean algebra to electronic circuits in his landmark master's thesis, A Symbolic Analysis of Relay and Switching Circuits. In 1935, Bush was approached by OP-20-G, which was searching for an electronic device to aid in codebreaking. Bush was paid a $10,000 <b>fee</b> <b>to</b> design the Rapid Analytical Machine (RAM). The project went over budget and was not delivered until 1938, when it was found to be unreliable in service. Nonetheless, it was an important step toward creating such a device.|$|E
5|$|Crucial to the {{attractiveness}} to investors of all MIS schemes is their taxation treatment. The Australian government had {{for many years}} been encouraging agricultural and forestry investment schemes by allowing investors to claim up-front tax deductions {{of the costs of}} investment. Investors paid Great Southern a <b>fee</b> <b>to</b> lease plantation woodlots. Great Southern managed the woodlot, and the investor could deduct the cost of the lease from the income they declared that year for tax assessment purposes. The tax deductible status of the investment was widely regarded as the main attraction of MIS schemes to investors.|$|E

However, Homer brushes aside her worries; he has grand plans of building a theme park in their backyard, and decides to charge others a <b>fee</b> <b>to</b> use the trampoline. Inevitably, however, people begin to get injured, and Homer accepts Marge's advice {{to get rid of the}} trampoline. After failing at his various attempts to do so, Bart steps in to help, by chaining the trampoline to a pole and waiting for Snake to break the chain and steal it for himself.|$|E

After that, 79 cyclists signed up for the race, of whom 60 actually started the race.|$|E
