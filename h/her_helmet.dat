Thrown into a grille in a compromised environmental suit, Gail (Rosalind Lloyd) removes <b>her</b> <b>helmet</b> and freezes {{to death in the}} toxic atmosphere while trying to amputate her trapped foot with a chainsaw. Documentation officer Kate Frost (Stephanie Beacham) shoots Ricky with a harpoon gun before he opens both the inner and outer airlock doors and renders the air inside the base unbreathable.|$|E
5|$|Mulan is {{praised by}} the Emperor {{and the people}} of China, who all bow to her, an {{unprecedented}} honor. Mulan accepts the Emperor's crest and Shan Yu's sword as gifts but politely declines his offer to be his advisor and instead asks to return to her family. She returns home and presents the imperial gifts to her father, but he is more overjoyed to have his daughter back safely. Li Shang, who has become enamored with Mulan, soon arrives under the guise of returning <b>her</b> <b>helmet</b> but accepts the family's invitation for dinner. Earlier in the film, Mulan was declared unfit for marriage, but this now appears not to be the case with her strong budding romance with Li Shang. Mushu is granted a position as a Fa family guardian by the ancestors amid a returning celebration.|$|E
5|$|The United States, Canada and Germany, {{together}} with two unnamed teams, lodged a protest with officials following Williams' successful {{first day of}} competition. The protest alleged that <b>her</b> <b>helmet</b> was illegal, as ridges in it might give her an unfair aerodynamic advantage. In accordance with competition rules, the jury of officials inspected the helmet, and rejected the protest. Their grounds for doing so were that the ridges in the helmet were not a separate piece affixed to the helmet, expressly banned by FIBT rules, but rather {{an integral part of}} the helmet, which made the helmet legal. A second protest, filed jointly by the US and Canada on the 19th, was also rejected.|$|E

Another spaceman witnesses Minogue nude but covers herself with a red blanket, and closes the window. The video ends with Minogue laying on a soft bedding, turning the lights off, and the spacecraft traveling to another destination.|$|E
5|$|According to Thai tradition, however, Thado Dhamma Yaza and Maha Chakkraphat {{engaged in}} single elephant-combat. (The custom {{of the time}} was for two commanders/leaders of the same status to fight in single combat. It is unclear {{as to why the}} Siamese king would have {{accepted}} to face someone of lesser rank. If he did issue the challenge, he would have challenged his counterpart Tabinshwehti and accepted to face only Tabinshwehti.) The Thai narrative continues that Maha Chakkraphat's elephant panicked and gave flight, charging away from the enemy; Thado Dhamma Yaza swiftly gave chase. Fearing for the life of her husband, Queen Sri Suriyothai charged ahead to put her elephant between the King and the Viceroy, thereby blocking his pursuit. The Viceroy then engaged the Queen in single combat, fatally cleaving her from shoulder to heart with his spear, also wounding her daughter—both mother and child met their deaths {{on the back of the}} same elephant. It is said that the Viceroy did not know he was fighting a woman until his blow struck—as she fell dying <b>her</b> <b>helmet</b> came off, exposing her long hair. Prince Ramesuan and Prince Mahin then urged their elephants forward to fight the Viceroy, drove him and his remaining forces from the field, then carried the bodies of their mother and sister back to Ayutthaya. The Siamese king meanwhile rallied his army, and retreated in good order back towards the capital. The Burmese chronicles however do not mention any instance of single combat (on elephant-back or otherwise) by the viceroy of Prome.|$|E

In the scene where Carol is flying a fighter jet, her call sign is 'Sapphire' and the Star Sapphire sign can be spotted on <b>her</b> <b>helmet.</b> While the Star Sapphires were never {{involved}} in the film, Lively has commented that there is potential for Star Sapphire to appear in any possible sequels {{and that she would}} enjoy the chance to return as Star Sapphire.|$|E

25|$|Little Orphan Annie {{was also}} parodied in {{an episode of}} the stop-motion {{television}} series Robot Chicken in which Little Orphan Annie fails to grasp {{the true meaning of}} a hard knock life when a fellow orphan shows that their lives are relatively decent compared to orphans around the world. Annie reappears in another episode as a vulgar, demanding, and spoiled teenager featured in a parodic documentary chronicling her preparations for her ostentatious upcoming sixteenth birthday celebration in a sketch lampooning reality programs based on the same concept. She quickly tires of her gift from Daddy Warbucks— the planet Mars— and soon winds up suffocating to death after losing <b>her</b> <b>helmet</b> while exploring the planet.|$|E
25|$|On {{the first}} slab, BM 536, {{the battle is}} evenly balanced, one Amazon and one Greek having the better of the {{fighting}} {{in a pair of}} duels. On the following slab, BM 533, appears the first casualty, BM 533:1, an Amazon probably holding the handle of an axe in her right hand as she collapses. <b>Her</b> <b>helmet</b> lies on the ground to her right side. The dress of the dying Amazon here, an overgirt peplos and mantle, distinguishes her from the other Amazon warriors who wear the more typical chitoniskos. The axe and helmet identify her as a combatant, and the peplos therefore must indicate that {{she is one of the}} three Amazonian queens who take part in the battle. As a queen and the first casualty she must be Melanippe, and the Greek who kills her must be Telamon. Telamon, BM 533:2, stands adjacent to his victim but now has tumed his spear to another.|$|E
25|$|Here Marie {{is shown}} in allegorical fashion as the {{personification}} of Justice itself and flanked by a retinue {{of some of the}} primary personifications/gods in the Greek and Roman pantheon. These have been identified as Cupid, Minerva, Prudence, Abundance, Saturn, and two figures of Pheme, all indicated by their traditional attributes, all bestowing their bounties on the Queen. (Cupid has his arrow; Prudence carries a snake entwined around her arm to indicate serpent-like wisdom; Abundance also appears with her cornucopia, also a reference to the fruits of Marie's regency. Minerva, goddess of wisdom, bears <b>her</b> <b>helmet</b> and shield and stands near Marie's shoulder, signifying her wise rule. Saturn has his sickle and is personified as Time here guiding France forward. Fame carries a trumpet to herald the occasion.) These personifications are accompanied in turn by several allegorical figures in the guise of four putti and three vanquished evil creatures (Envy, Ignorance, and Vice) {{as well as a number}} of other symbols that Rubens employed throughout the entire cycle of paintings.|$|E

5|$|Hilde {{appears as}} a slender woman with long, red hair. Her primary {{appearance}} encases her fully in form-fitting body armor, with red and black fabric underneath. A wolf's head, the character's family symbol, extends from the right pauldron and covers <b>her</b> <b>helmet's</b> visor, while the left pauldron is covered by red fabric, fastened {{to the center of}} her breastplate's collar underneath a large brooch. Beneath the armor, a red coat covers her torso, the tail of which extends past her waist. Her alternate character design consists of a long, blue dress, extending to her feet and neck, exposing her shoulders and angled towards her right leg. White gloves, shoes, and stockings cover her arms and legs, while a darker colored sash surrounds her waist and midsection, also angled to the right.|$|R
5000|$|Played by Rajia Baroudi, is the White Aquitian Ranger. She was {{the leader}} of the team, and was the first female to be a Power Rangers team leader. She is also the first female White Ranger. The White Aquitian Ranger's symbol is the arrow (left-pointing on <b>her</b> <b>helmet's</b> forehead, downward-pointing on her visor). She pilots the White Battleborg and the White Shogunzord. Her last unmorphed {{appearance}} was in [...] "Rangers of Two Worlds" [...] when she and Cestro visited Earth to help Billy's ailment. Delphine has more endurance and can survive far longer outside of water than her team. Water is the essential element for the survival and regeneration of the Alien Rangers. She would later return in Power Rangers Super Megaforce to battle alongside other veteran Ranger teams and the Megaforce Rangers.|$|R
25|$|The Exchange of Princesses {{celebrates the}} double {{marriage}} of the Anna of Austria to Louis XIII of France and Louis XIII's sister, Princess Elisabeth, to future king of Spain, Philip IV on 9 November 1615. France and Spain present the young princesses, {{aided by a}} youth who is probably Hymen. Above them, two putti brandish hymeneal torches, a small zephyr blows a warm breeze of spring and scatter roses, and a circle of joyous butterfly-winged putti surround Felicitas Publica with the caduceus, who showers the couple with gold from her cornucopia. Below, the river Andaye is filled with sea deities come {{to pay homage to}} the brides: the river-god Andaye rests on his urn, a nereid crowned with pearls offers a strand of pearls and coral as wedding gifts, while a triton blows the conch to herald the event. The wedding, which was thought to secure peace between France and Spain, took place on a float midway across the Bidassoa River, along the French-Spanish border. In Ruben's depiction, the princesses stand with their right hands joined between personifications of France and Spain. Spain with a recognizable symbol of a lion on <b>her</b> <b>helmet</b> is on the left, whereas France, with fleur-de-lis decorating her drapery, is on the right. Anna, at age fourteen the older of the two, turns back as if to take leave of Spain, while France gently pulls her by the left arm. In turn, Spain can be seen taking the thirteen-year-old Elisabeth by her left arm.|$|E
25|$|A subplot {{in which}} the Rohirrim are aided by the {{primitive}} Drúedain during their journey to the besieged Gondor is excised from the film. The Red Arrow brought by a messenger from Gondor to ask for aid is absent. Éowyn's presence on the battlefield is unknown to the reader until she takes off <b>her</b> <b>helmet,</b> but in the film the audience is aware, {{as it would have}} been difficult to have Miranda Otto playing a man. When hope seems lost, Gandalf comforts Pippin with a description of the Undying Lands, which is a descriptive passage in the book's final chapter. The film depicts the Army of the Dead fighting in the Battle, whereas in the book they are released from service prior to this, after helping Aragorn defeat the Corsairs of Umbar at the port city of Pelargir in Lebennin; Aragorn's reinforcements are merely more Gondorians, and the Dúnedain, Aragorn's people (the rangers of the North). An unstoppable and invulnerable force, the Dead wipe out Sauron's forces. The film also cuts out several supporting characters, such as Halbarad, a friend of Aragorn's, who helps lead the Dúnedain, Beregond, a member of the Citadel Guard of Gondor, whom Pippin befriends, and Elladan and Elrohir, the twin sons of Elrond who deliver Aragorn's banner and accompany him to the Pelennor Fields. Elladan and Elrohir are replaced by Elrond in the film, instead delivering Andúril in Dunharrow, and then returning to Rivendell. In the books Aragorn isn't doubtful about his destiny, but had already decided to claim the throne of Gondor {{from the beginning of the}} Quest; thus, it was he who had the shards of Narsil forged to Andúril in Rivendell, carrying it from there on the whole journey.|$|E

5|$|The post-credits scene {{puts the}} player {{in control of}} Six's last stand against {{overwhelming}} Covenant forces. After sustaining heavy damage, Six drops his or <b>her</b> shattered <b>helmet</b> and is overwhelmed and killed. Decades later, Six's helmet remains on the grassy plains of a now-restored Reach. A narration by Halsey eulogizes Noble Team, who ultimately enabled humanity's victory over the Covenant.|$|R
500|$|At the 2014 Winter Paralympics in Sochi, Bor {{was again}} Melissa Perrine's guide. She {{finished}} {{fourth in the}} women's downhill for visually impaired, and did not finish in three other events.

500|$|James Stansfield of the {{entertainment}} website Den of Geek considers [...] "Attack on Cloudbase" [...] the best episode of Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons, ranking it first in his [...] "Top 10" [...] list. Describing the instalment as highly entertaining, even if [...] "shocking and surprisingly bleak", he praises the characterisation and Tony Barwick's writing in general, {{and in particular the}} shocking killing of Rhapsody Angel and the conflict between Captain Blue and Colonel White. Stansfield's review is not without criticism, conveying disappointment with the plot twist conclusion and also questioning a minor plot hole: why Symphony Angel discards <b>her</b> <b>helmet</b> after crash-landing, thereby breaking off radio communication with Cloudbase.|$|E
500|$|The next day, Calafia duels with King Amadis, and Radiaro duels with Esplandián. With Leonorina, his betrothed, looking on, Esplandián masters Radiaro with {{a flurry}} of weapon thrusts. Calafia and Amadis trade blows until he disarms her and knocks <b>her</b> <b>helmet</b> off. Both Calafia and Radario {{surrender}} to the Christians. While being held prisoner, Calafia acknowledges the astonishing beauty of Leonorina, daughter of the Constantinople emperor and the intended bride of Esplandián, and resolves not to interfere with their union. She accepts Christianity as the one true faith, saying, [...] "I have seen the ordered order of your religion, and the great disorder of all others, I have seen that {{it is clear that}} the law which you follow must be the truth, while that which we follow is lying and falsehood." [...] She marries Talanque, a large and handsome knight who fought with her outside the city gate; similarly, her sister Liota marries Maneli, Talanque's companion in arms. The women return to California with their husbands to establish a new dynasty complete with both sexes, as a Christian nation.|$|E

25|$|Trolls are {{the least}} {{intelligent}} of the non-magical creatures. Most of their decisions are based on their instincts. They are quick for their size and have large serrated tusks which produce a narcotic venom which renders the prey mindlessly—and defenselessly—happy. If they can, their preferred kill tactic is to slip their claws under the rib cage and pop the heart out before the muscles have time to tense up, rendering the meat mostly unharmed and tender. They have an extreme aversion to light, noise, and water. The largest pack of trolls were seen in the Eleven Wonders of the World Exhibit in a run-down part of Haven. Very few people have ever managed to single-handedly down a troll. Holly Short once did it with <b>her</b> <b>helmet's</b> eight-hundred-watt high beams, {{the shock of the}} light rendering the troll unconscious. Domovoi Butler became the only human ever to do so with a combination of medieval weaponry and modern combat techniques.|$|R
50|$|In The Power of Shazam! #32 (November 1997), James Barr and Susan Kent-Barr {{were given}} a {{daughter}} named Deanna Barr, who donned <b>her</b> mother's <b>helmet</b> and operated briefly under the name Windshear (not {{to be confused with}} the Marvel Comics superhero of the same name).
