50|$|Small-hole gauges {{require a}} {{slightly}} different technique to the telescopic gauges, the small <b>hole</b> <b>gauge</b> is initially set smaller than the bore to be measured. It is then inserted into the bore and adjusted by rotating the knurled knob at the base, until light pressure is felt when the gauge is slightly moved in the bore. The gauge is then removed and measured with a caliper or micrometer. To accurately detect the maximal distance between {{the two halves of}} the gauge head, move the head of the gauge around while making the measurement to insure you get the maximal reading. Grasp the gauge near the head to aid in your maneuvering of the gauge while adjusting the micrometer so it just stops the gauge's motion at one spot only. A bit of practice will quickly give you the idea.|$|E
40|$|A general {{covariant}} quantization of superparticle, Green-Schwarz superstring and a supermembrane with manifest supersymmetry and duality symmetry is proposed. This quantization {{provides a}} natural quantum mechanical description of curved BPStype backgrounds {{related to the}} ultra-short supersymmetry multiplets. Half-size commuting and anticommuting Killing spinors admitted by such backgrounds in quantum theory become truncated κ-symmetry ghosts. The symmetry of Killing spinors under dualities transfers to the symmetry of the spectrum of states. GS superstring in the generalized semi-light-cone gauge can be quantized consistently {{in the background of}} ten-dimensional supersymmetric gravitational waves. Upon compactification they become supersymmetric electrically charged black holes, either massive or massless. However, the generalized light-cone gauge breaks S-duality. We propose a new family of gauges, which we call black hole gauges. These gauges are suitable for quantization both in flat Minkowski space and in the black hole background, and they are duality symmetric. As an example, a manifestly S-duality symmetric black <b>hole</b> <b>gauge</b> is constructed in terms of the axion-dilaton-electric-magnetic black hole hair. We also suggest the U-duality covariant class of gauges for type II superstrings. ...|$|E

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} that Kerr-CFT duality {{can be extended}} to super-entropic black holes, which have non-compact horizons with finite area.

40|$|We {{extend the}} {{investigation}} of the recently proposed Kerr/CFT correspondence to large classes of rotating black <b>hole</b> solutions in <b>gauged</b> and ungauged supergravities. The correspondence, proposed originally for four-dimensional Kerr black holes, asserts that the quantum states in the near-horizon region of an extremal rotating black hole are holographically dual to a two-dimensional chiral theory whose Virasoro algebra arises as an asymptotic symmetry of the near-horizon geometry. In fact in dimension D there are [(D − 1) / 2] commuting Virasoro algebras. We consider a general canonical class of near-horizon geometries in arbitrary dimension D, and show that in any such metric, the [(D − 1) / 2] central charges each imply, via the Cardy formula, a microscopic entropy that agrees with the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of the associated extremal black hole.

We obtain new regular supersymmetric black holes in seven and four dimensions, as well as reproducing known examples in five and four dimensions. We also obtain new supersymmetric non-singular topological solitons in five and seven dimensions. The rest of the supersymmetric solutions either have naked singularities or naked time machines. The latter can be rendered non-singular if the asymptotic time is periodic. This leads to a new type of quantum consistency condition, which we call a Josephson quantisation condition.
