2500|$|Geoff Eley {{summed up}} the change in {{attitude}} at this time as follows:By the Fifth Comintern Congress in July 1924 … the collapse of Communist support in Europe tightened the pressure for conformity. A new policy of [...] "Bolshevization" [...] was adopted, which dragooned the CPs toward stricter bureaucratic centralism. This flattened out the earlier diversity of radicalisms, welding them into a single approved model of Communist organization. Only then did the new parties retreat from broader Left arenas into their own belligerent world, even if many local cultures of broader cooperation persisted. Respect for Bolshevik achievements and defense of the Russian Revolution now transmuted into dependency on Moscow and belief in Soviet infallibility. Depressing cycles of [...] "internal rectification" [...] began, disgracing and expelling successive leaderships, {{so that by the}} later 1920s many founding Communists had gone. This process of coordination, in a <b>hard-faced</b> drive for uniformity, was finalized at the next Congress of the Third International in 1928.|$|E
2500|$|The {{reaction}} to {{the horrors of the}} First World War prompted a return to pastoral subjects as represented by Paul Nash and Eric Ravilious, mainly a printmaker. [...] Stanley Spencer painted mystical works, as well as landscapes, and the sculptor, printmaker and typographer Eric Gill produced elegant simple forms in a style related to Art Deco. The Euston Road School was a group of [...] "progressive" [...] realists of the late 1930s, including the influential teacher William Coldstream. [...] Surrealism, with artists including [...] John Tunnard and the Birmingham Surrealists, was briefly popular in the 1930s, influencing [...] Roland Penrose and Henry Moore. Stanley William Hayter was a British painter and printmaker associated in the 1930s with Surrealism and from 1940 onward with Abstract Expressionism. In 1927 Hayter founded the legendary Atelier 17 studio in Paris. [...] Since his death in 1988, it has been known as Atelier Contrepoint. Hayter {{became one of the most}} influential printmakers of the 20th century. Fashionable portraitists included Meredith Frampton in a <b>hard-faced</b> Art Deco classicism, Augustus John, and Sir Alfred Munnings if horses were involved. [...] Munnings was President of the Royal Academy 1944–1949 and led a jeering hostility to Modernism. [...] The photographers of the period include Bill Brandt, Angus McBean and the diarist Cecil Beaton.|$|E
60|$|Anson was met at {{the door}} by a <b>hard-faced,</b> middle-aged woman.|$|E
60|$|The {{door was}} opened {{for them by}} a tall, raw-boned, <b>hard-faced</b> woman, the very {{embodiment}} and personification of Edie's ideal skinflint London landlady. Might they see the lodgings, Edie asked dubiously. Yes, they might, indeed, mum, answered the <b>hard-faced</b> woman. Edie glanced at Ernest significantly, as who should say that these would really never do.|$|E
60|$|Austin {{sat down}} on the settee and blinked at the burly, <b>hard-faced</b> man in front of him.|$|E
60|$|The silent, <b>hard-faced</b> Hans leant {{forward and}} stared up the darkling water, his hand behind his ear.|$|E
60|$|He {{went down}} the steps into the street, and the lean, <b>hard-faced</b> {{storekeeper}} turned to Drummond with an ominous frown.|$|E
60|$|I {{passed them}} both, and when I reached the crown I was riding {{level with the}} little, <b>hard-faced</b> English huntsman.|$|E
60|$|It was Dan Baxter, as impudent and <b>hard-faced</b> as ever. He came a {{step closer}} and fairly glared at Tom.|$|E
60|$|As it happened, the grim, <b>hard-faced</b> Sager, who {{had come}} there from Michigan, was just then talking about him to Stukely.|$|E
6000|$|Five {{minutes later}} an elderly, <b>hard-faced</b> man with grizzled hair flung open the door. As he emerged {{a voice from}} somewhere in the shadows cried-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Will {{you have}} cold pork for your supper," [...] asked the <b>hard-faced</b> maid, as she cleared the table, [...] "or {{will you have}} it hotted up?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Larry Grant," [...] said Clavering. [...] "I {{guess he}} was too busy at the depot {{bringing}} a fat Dutchman and a crowd of <b>hard-faced</b> Dakota ploughboys in." ...|$|E
60|$|Like {{everyone}} else, I turned frankly round. She {{was coming}} up the aisle {{on the arm of}} a <b>hard-faced,</b> rather gipsy-looking man, dressed in a farmer's very best.|$|E
60|$|I {{rang the}} bell and sent for Jacky's chauffeur. He {{appeared}} after a few minutes' delay,--a short, <b>hard-faced</b> young man, who before Jacky had engaged him had driven a racing car.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{thinking}} all isn't {{quite as}} it should be aboard of this ship, sir," [...] said he. He was a <b>hard-faced</b> man, and yet I could see that he had been startled.|$|E
60|$|Presently {{there was}} an interruption, for a man in white shirt and store {{clothing}} pushed forward through the crowd, with another, who was big and lank and <b>hard-faced,</b> and wore old blue duck, following close behind him.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Arf a suvveran, mum? Well, I 'ardly rightly know,' {{said the}} <b>hard-faced</b> landlady deliberately. 'I can't say without askin' of my 'usband whether he'll let me. Excuse me a minnit, mum; I'll just run down and ask 'im.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I'm glad you're {{so fond of}} flowers, Mrs.----. Oh, you haven't told us {{your name}} yet,' Edie said, {{beginning}} vaguely to suspect that perhaps the <b>hard-faced</b> landlady wasn't quite as bad as she looked to a casual observer.|$|E
6000|$|... "'Tis old Bowker's pup," [...] {{explained}} the old man, whom the <b>hard-faced</b> maid had addressed as George. [...] "She was main fond of you; never seemed {{the same after}} you went away to Australee. She died 'bout a year agone. 'Tis her pup." ...|$|E
6000|$|All {{the birds}} are folded in a silent ball of sleep, [...] All the flowers are faded from the asphalt isle in [...] the sea, Only we <b>hard-faced</b> creatures go round and round, [...] and keep [...] The shores of this {{innermost}} ocean alive and [...] illusory.|$|E
60|$|When {{they had}} finished, Brant bade the two women, Red Bow and the other, leave the cellar and {{send in the}} sentry, {{replacing}} him as guards. He entered, a <b>hard-faced,</b> grizzled man, and, taking {{a seat at the}} table, began to fill himself with food and wine.|$|E
6000|$|The one was Corporal Robert Dick, Bearded and burly, {{short and}} thick, Rough {{of speech and}} in temper quick, [...] A <b>hard-faced</b> old rapscallion. The other, fresh from the barrack square, Was a raw recruit, smooth-cheeked and fair Half grown, half drilled, with the weedy air [...] Of a draft from the home battalion.|$|E
60|$|The <b>hard-faced</b> landlady went up {{the stairs}} again, only {{stopping}} a moment to observe parenthetically that a sweeter little lady she never did, and what was 'arf-a-crown a week to you and me, John? and then, holding {{the corner of her}} apron in her hand, she informed Edie that her 'usband was prepared to accept the ten shillings weekly.|$|E
6000|$|Said a <b>hard-faced</b> skipper, [...] "God help us all! [...] She {{will not}} float till the turning tide!" [...] Said his wife, [...] "My darling will hear MY call, [...] Whether in sea or heaven she bide;" [...] And she lifted a quavering voice and high, [...] Wild and strange as a sea-bird's cry, [...] Till they shuddered and {{wondered}} at her side.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Not that, he shan't, indeed, mum,' {{cried the}} <b>hard-faced</b> landlady, hastily; 'beggin' your pardon for sayin' so. Our John shall go--that's my 'usband, mum; and you shall give 'im the ticket. I wouldn't let your good gentleman there go, and 'im so tired, too, {{not for the}} world, I wouldn't. Just {{you give me the}} ticket, mum, and John shall go this very minnit and fetch it.' ...|$|E
60|$|But {{early that}} morning the dwellers by the Wingdam turnpike, miles away, heard a voice, pure as a skylark's, singing afield. They who were asleep turned over on their rude couches to dream of youth and love and olden days. <b>Hard-faced</b> men and anxious gold-seekers, already at work, ceased their labors and leaned upon their picks, {{to listen to a}} romantic {{vagabond}} ambling away against the rosy sunrise.|$|E
60|$|The two {{men stood}} quite {{still in the}} heat, watching. The elder was a short, <b>hard-faced</b> {{energetic}} man of middle age, the younger a labourer of twenty-three or so. They stood in silence watching the advance of the sisters. They watched whilst the girls drew near, and whilst they passed, and whilst they receded down the dusty road, that had dwellings on one side, and dusty young corn on the other.|$|E
6000|$|... "They are all Englishmen, {{some of the}} {{household}} and others who like yourself, are captains of companies. There is Lord Neville, Sir Stephen Cossington, and Sir Matthew Gourney, with Sir Walter Huet, Sir Thomas Banaster, and Sir Thomas Felton, who is {{the brother of the}} high steward. Mark well the man with the high nose and flaxen beard who hath placed his hand upon the shoulder of the dark <b>hard-faced</b> cavalier in the rust-stained jupon." ...|$|E
60|$|Allie's heart {{seemed to}} come to her throat. She shook all over, and she gazed with {{piercing}} intensity at the man. When he had arisen from the table he had appeared the same black-garbed, <b>hard-faced</b> gambler as any of the others. But looked at closely, he was different. Underneath the cold, expressionless face worked something mobile and soft. His eyes were of crystal clearness and remarkable for a penetrating power. They shone with wonder, curiosity, sympathy.|$|E
60|$|While {{they were}} away other men, strangers, {{inhabitants}} of desert Nephi, came into camp and stalked about. They were white men, like us, {{but they were}} <b>hard-faced,</b> stern-faced, sombre, and they seemed angry with all our company. Bad feeling was in the air, and they said things calculated to rouse the tempers of our men. But the warning went out from the women, and was passed on everywhere to our men and youths, {{that there must be}} no words.|$|E
60|$|Winifred {{permitted}} Sproatly to {{help her}} into his waggon--a high, narrow-bodied vehicle, mounted on tall, spidery wheels, {{but she had to}} hold fast to it while they jolted across the track and through a sea of mire into the unpaved street of the little town. She liked her companion's voice and manner, though she was far from prepossessed by his appearance. Two or three minutes later he drew up before a little wooden house, where they were received by a tall, <b>hard-faced</b> woman, who frowned at Sproatly.|$|E
60|$|In {{an instant}} he was rubbing his hands again with his blandest {{professional}} smile. These were patients, then, {{whom he had}} tried to hunt from his doorstep--the very first patients, whom he had waited for so impatiently. They did not look very promising. The man, a tall, lank-haired gypsy, had gone back to the horse's head. There remained a small, <b>hard-faced</b> woman with a great bruise all round her eye. She wore a yellow silk handkerchief round her head, and a baby, tucked in a red shawl, was pressed to her bosom.|$|E
60|$|At length a small square {{block cut}} against the {{dazzling}} brightness and slowly {{grew into a}} lonely homestead. After some consideration, George headed for it, and toward noon reached a little, birch-log dwelling, with a sod stable beside it. Both had an uncared-for appearance, which suggested their owner's poverty. As George approached the door, a gaunt, <b>hard-faced</b> man in dilapidated overalls came out and gazed at him in surprise. George's clothing, which had been torn when he was seized in the bluff, had further suffered during the deluge. He looked a weary, ragged outcast.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Burns {{dealt with}} him at some length. He was a {{peculiar}} man--of sixty-five about--iron gray, <b>hard-faced,</b> obstinate, and uncommunicative. He used to keep the ship loafing at sea for inscrutable reasons. Would come on deck at night sometimes, take some sail off her, God only knows why or wherefore, then go below, shut himself up in his cabin, and play on the violin for hours--till daybreak perhaps. In fact, {{he spent most of}} his time day or night playing the violin. That was when the fit took him. Very loud, too.|$|E
6000|$|... "He is {{the tall}} <b>hard-faced</b> man in yellow silk, he with the hairless cheeks and the split lip. He is little older than yourself, {{and his father}} was a cobbler in Chester, yet he has already won the golden spurs. See how he dabs his great hand in the dish and hands forth the gobbets. He is more used to a camp-kettle than a silver plate. The big man with the black beard is Sir Bartholomew Berghersh, whose brother is the Abbot of Beaulieu. Haste, haste! for the boar's head is come and the plate's to be cleaned." ...|$|E
