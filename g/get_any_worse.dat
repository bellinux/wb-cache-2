40|$|The {{purpose of}} this comment is to {{advocate}} {{for the release of}} people, who because of the symptomology associated with their mental disorder end up in jail, usually because of the commission of relatively minor crimes. This class of jailed mentally ill misdemeanants ("MIMs") suffers from severe and persistent mental disorders, usually either a psychotic or mood disorder, without symptoms of or a diagnosis of a personality disorder. For purposes of this comment, those with a serious and persistent mental disorder, without any personality disorder diagnosis, who tend to get arrested and confined because of their symptoms, will be referred to as Mentally Ill Misdemeanants (MIMs). Part II of this comment will {{look at the history of}} the treatment that our society has given its mentally ill, as well as a discussion of the differences among mentally ill persons in jail. Part III presents the legal questions and problems in the discussion of MIMs and the types of crimes they commit, their criminal responsibility, and why incarceration of MIMs does not serve the needs of society or the MIM. Part IV, the last section, is designed to offer alternatives that may serve to help those involved in the criminal justice and mental health care systems to more effectively help stop this problem from <b>getting</b> <b>any</b> <b>worse...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{identify}} any barriers or enablers as influences on wound care self-management by Indigenous people. A qualitative, interpretive study sought to investigate how participants perceived their wounds and their general health, and to identify the influences on them accessing wound care services. There is a dearth of information on culturally appropriate practice in wound management for Indigenous Australians. This research project was therefore significant in attempting to bridge the gap in nursing knowledge of Indigenous clients' perceptions of barriers and enablers for seeking wound care services,especially in relation to lower leg ulcers. The lack of culturally sensitive wound management practices potentially impacts on Indigenous clients' behaviours in seeking treatment from their health service providers. Participant observations and semi-structured interviews with the research participants investigated the management of their wounds, and the ways in which their culture influences wound management. The main aim was to understand participants' comprehension of the importance of wound care through reflection. Understanding the enhancing or obstructive influences on wound management practices was expected to provide a foundation for teaching self care of wounds in Indigenous populations and inform health professionals' approach to health education. The data were analysed using thematic analysis, which generated common themes related to the research questions. These themes are: visibility, of the problem, 4 perceived versus actual level of knowledge, acceptance of co-morbid health conditions and pre-determined path of ill health. These findings indicated that in one region, participants' perception of poor health was related to visibility of the problem. Participants chose to have their visible wounds managed by Silver Chain Nursing Association, whereas Diabetes and Hypertension and any other non-visible disorders were seen as appropriate to the Aboriginal Medical Service (AMS). Further to this finding, most participants displayed a sense of helplessness and hopelessness when sharing information about their diagnosis of diabetes, believing this was the norm. Many also believed that having a strong family history of a particular disease resulted in the participants also inheriting the disease. During post interview educational sessions many of the Indigenous participants were surprised by the evidence based-research reported to them by the researcher that diabetes is a manageable disease with life style changes. Another issue highlighted was the perceived level of knowledge the participants had about wound care. Reassurance was given by the participants that their level of knowledge about how to manage their wounds was adequate. However, none of the participants were concerned about the length of time that their wound/s had or were being managed, between 3 months and 5 years. This acceptance that although a wound is not <b>getting</b> <b>any</b> <b>worse</b> and not <b>getting</b> <b>any</b> better was the norm is cause for concern, and indicates a low level of health literacy. This theme was 'perceiving an imbalance in perceptions of wound care knowledge with actual knowledge'. The most important recommendation from the study findings is the need to consider health literacy more carefully in the development of health promotion and health education for Indigenous clients with wounds...|$|R
40|$|Now 2012 has arrived, the Public Health Agency is {{encouraging}} people to make a New Year 2 ̆ 7 s resolution to know their limits {{when it comes to}} alcohol, not to drink excessively and to cut back for a while, especially if the festive period led to a little too much consumption. Owen O 2 ̆ 7 Neill, PHA Health and Social Wellbeing Improvement Manager and drugs and alcohol lead, explained: "The New Year is a great opportunity for us to be positive about our health, making resolutions that make us look and feel better. If people choose to drink, staying within the safe drinking limits is important. Excessive and binge drinking can have lasting effects on health, such as damage to the liver, heart, brain and stomach. Drinking too much can also increase the risk of accidents and antisocial behaviour as well as sexually transmitted infections and unplanned pregnancy. And it doesn 2 ̆ 7 t have to be drinking to extremes - regularly drinking over the recommended limits can have a damaging effect. "Remember that for each unit you drink over the daily limit, the risk to your health increases. It 2 ̆ 7 s important to spread the units throughout the week and not 2 ̆ 7 save 2 ̆ 7 them for the weekend and to drink plenty of water, ideally matching the amount of alcohol you have consumed. "For those who have consumed a lot of alcohol over the festive season, cutting back in the New Year and being careful can have immediate, positive effects particularly on helping you to look and feel better, being less tired during the day, feeling fitter and perhaps losing weight. Longer term, the benefits include improved mood, sleep, memory and general health, particularly improving liver function, immunity to illness and preventing any damage caused by <b>any</b> excessive drinking <b>getting</b> <b>any</b> <b>worse.</b> "Daily alcohol limits are recommended by the government to avoid the dangers of excessive and binge drinking in any one session. These are:MenNo more than 3 to 4 units of alcohol a day and no more than 21 units {{over the course of the}} week. WomenNo more than 2 to 3 units of alcohol a day and no more than 14 units over the course of the week.
