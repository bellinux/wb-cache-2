40|$|Amitriptyline and <b>imipramine,</b> two {{tricyclic}} <b>antidepressant</b> <b>drugs,</b> {{have been}} studied to evaluate their phototoxic potential using various models. Reactive oxygen species production was investigated. A negligible production of singlet oxygen was observed for both compounds whereas a significant production of superoxide anion was noted for amitriptyline in particular. Moderate red blood cell lysis under UVA light (365 nm) was induced {{in the presence of}} the two drugs at a concentration of 50 mu M. Cellular phototoxicity was investigated on a murine fibroblast cell line (3 T 3). The two drugs were phototoxic causing cell death at a concentration of 100 mu M and a WA dose in the range of 3. 3 - 6. 6 J/cm(2). Furthermore, the two drugs photosensitized the peroxidation of linoleic acid, as monitored by the formation of dienic hydroperoxides. The presence of BHA and GSH, two free radical scavengers, significantly reduced the lipid oxidation photoinduced by the drugs, suggesting a predominant involvement of radical species. Finally, the involvement of nucleic acids in the phototoxicity mechanism was also investigated using a pBR 322 plasmid DNA as a model...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe {{examined}} {{the effect of}} <b>imipramine</b> (a tricyclic <b>antidepressant</b> <b>drug)</b> on hydroxyl radical (·OH) generation induced by 1 -methyl- 4 -phenylpyridinium ion (MPP+) in extracellular fluid of rat striatum, using a microdialysis technique. Imipramine enhanced the formation of ·OH trapped as 2, 3 -dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHBA) induced by MPP+ (5 mM). Introduction of imipramine (0. 1, 0. 5 and 1. 0 mM) dose-dependently increased the level of dopamine (DA) release. Concomitantly, imipramine enhanced DA efflux {{and the level of}} DHBA induced by MPP+, as compared with MPP+-treated control. When corresponding experiments were performed with reserpinized rats, there were small increases in the levels of DA and nonsignificant increase in the formation of DHBA. When iron (II) was administered to imipramine (1 mM) -treated animals, a marked elevation of DHBA was observed, compared with MPP+-only treated animals. A positive linear correlation was observed between iron (II) and DHBA (R 2 = 0. 985) in the dialysate. These results indicate that imipramine enhances generation of ·OH induced by MPP+ during enhanced DA overflow...|$|R
40|$|Introduction The {{present study}} was {{designed}} to assess the antidepressant effects of UFP- 101, a selective nociceptin/ orphanin FQ peptide (NOP) receptor antagonist, in a validated animal model of depression: the chronic mild stress (CMS). Materials and methods and Results UFP- 101 (5, 10 and 20 nmol/rat; i. c. v., once a day for 21 days) dose- and timedependently reinstated sucrose consumption in stressed animals without affecting the same parameter in nonstressed ones. In the forced swimming test, UFP- 101 reduced immobility of stressed rats from day 8 of treatment. After a 3 -week treatment, rats were killed for biochemical evaluations. UFP- 101 abolished increase in serum corticosterone induced by CMS and reverted changes in central 5 -HT/ 5 -HIAA ratio. The behavioural and biochemical effects of UFP- 101 mimicked those of <b>imipramine,</b> the reference <b>antidepressant</b> <b>drug,</b> administered at the dose of 15 mg/kg (i. p.). Co-administration of nociceptin/orphanin FQ (5 nmol/rat, from day 12 to 21) prevented the effects of UFP- 101. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor mRNA and protein in hippocampus were not reduced by CMS nor did UFP- 101 modify these parameters. Discussion and Conclusion This study demonstrated that chronic treatment with UFP- 101 produces antidepressantlike effects in rats subjected to CMS supporting the proposal that NOP receptors represent a candidate target for the development of innovative <b>antidepressant</b> <b>drugs...</b>|$|R
40|$|Recently we {{identified}} GANT 61, a small-molecule antagonist of Gli transcription factors, {{which are the}} final effectors of the mam-malian Hedgehog (HH) signaling pathway. Here we describe a diamine substructure of GANT 61 that carries the biological activity and show that {{this part of the}} molecule is structurally related to trans- 1, 4 -bis(2 -chlorobenzaminomethyl) cyclohexane dihy-drochloride (AY 9944), an inhibitor of the enzymatic activity and transcriptional inducer of 7 -dehydrocholesterol-reductase (Dhcr 7, EC 1. 3. 1. 21). Treatment of cells with the GANT 61 diamine, AY 9944, or overexpression of DHCR 7 results in the attenuation of Smoothened-dependent and-independent HH signaling. Whereas GANT 61 function is independent of Dhcr 7, AY 9944 does require up-regulation of endogenous Dhcr 7. In line with these findings, Dhcr 7 -modulating antipsychotic (clozapine, chlor-promazine, haloperidol) and <b>antidepressant</b> (<b>imipramine)</b> <b>drugs</b> regulate HH signaling in vitro and in vivo. Modulation of HH sig-naling may represent a hitherto undiscovered biological (side) effect of therapeutics used to treat schizophrenia and depression...|$|R
40|$|Cholinergic {{as well as}} monoaminergic {{neurotransmission}} {{seems to}} be involved in the etiology of affective disorders. Chronic treatment with <b>imipramine,</b> a classical <b>antidepressant</b> <b>drug,</b> induces adaptive changes in monoaminergic neurotransmission. In order to identify possible changes in cholinergic neurotransmission we measured total, membrane-bound and soluble acetylcholinesterase (Achase) activity in several rat brain regions after chronic imipramine treatment. Changes in Achase activity would indicate alterations in acetylcholine (Ach) availability to bind to its receptors in the synaptic cleft. Male rats were treated with imipramine (20 mg/kg, ip) for 21 days, once a day. Twenty-four hours after the last dose the rats were sacrificed and homogenates from several brain regions were prepared. Membrane-bound Achase activity (nmol thiocholine formed min- 1 mg protein- 1) after chronic imipramine treatment was significantly decreased in the hippocampus (control = 188. 8 ± 19. 4, imipramine = 154. 4 ± 7. 5, P< 0. 005) and striatum (control = 850. 9 ± 59. 6, imipramine = 742. 5 ± 34. 7, P< 0. 005). A small increase in total Achase activity was observed in the medulla oblongata and pons. No changes in enzyme activity were detected in the thalamus or total cerebral cortex. Since the levels of Achase seem to be enhanced through the interaction between Ach and its receptors, a decrease in Achase activity may indicate decreased Ach release by the nerve endings. Therefore, our data indicate that cholinergic neurotransmission is decreased after chronic imipramine treatment which is consistent with the idea of an interaction between monoaminergic and cholinergic neurotransmission in the antidepressant effect of imipramin...|$|R
40|$|Algae {{have been}} {{recognized}} as important resources providing functional components due to their capacity to exert beneficial effects on health. Therefore, there is increasing interest in investigating the biological activity of algae. In this study, we evaluated the antidepressant-like effect of the administration of 100 mg/kg/day of the ethanol extract of colonial green alga Botryococcus braunii (EEB) for 14 consecutive days in the forced swimming test (FST) -induced depression in imprinting control region (ICR) mice. <b>Imipramine,</b> a commercial <b>antidepressant</b> <b>drug,</b> {{was used as a}} positive control. In addition, we investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying the effect of EEB by measuring ATP production and by assessing any change in gene expression {{at the end of the}} treatment using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and microarray assays. We showed that the immobility time in the water-administered control (FST stress) group gradually increased from day 1 to day 14. However, treatment with EEB caused a significant decrease of immobility time in the FST compared with that in the FST stress group. Microarray and real-time PCR results revealed that EEB treatment induced variation in the expression of several genes associated with neurogenesis, energy metabolism, and dopamine synthesis. Interestingly, we revealed that only EEB treatment enhanced the promotion of energy production, while treatment with imipramine was ineffective. Our study provides the first evidence that B. braunii enhances energy production, which may contribute to the modulation of neurogenesis and to the enhancement of dopaminergic function, in turn potentially underlying the antistress- and antidepressant-like effects that we observed...|$|R

40|$|<b>Antidepressant</b> <b>drugs</b> {{are known}} to inhibit some changes evoked by glucocorticoids, {{as well as a}} {{hyperactivity}} of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, often observed in depression. The aim of present study was to investigate effects of various <b>antidepressant</b> <b>drugs</b> on the glucocorticoid-mediated gene transcription in fibroblast cells, stably transfected with an MMTV promoter (LMCAT cells). The present study have shown that <b>antidepressants</b> (<b>imipramine,</b> amitriptyline, desipramine, fluoxetine, tianeptine, mianserin and moclobemide), but not cocaine, inhibit the corticosterone-induced gene transcription in a concentration- and a time-dependent manner. Drugs which {{are known to}} augment clinical effects of medication in depressed patients (lithium chloride, amantadine, memantine), do not affect the inhibitory effects of imipramine on the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) -mediated gene transcription. Inhibitors of phospholipase C (PLC), protein kinase C (PKC), Ca 2 +/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMK) and antagonists of the L-type Ca 2 + channel also inhibit the corticosterone-induced gene transcription. Inhibitors of protein kinase A (PKA) and protein kinase G (PKG) are without effect on the GR-induced gene transcription. Phorbol ester (an activator of PKC) attenuates the inhibitory effect of imipramine on the GR-induced gene transcription. Imipramine decreases binding of corticosterone-receptor complex to DNA. It is concluded that <b>antidepressant</b> <b>drugs</b> inhibit the corticosterone-induced gene transcription, and that the inhibitory effect of imipramine depends partly on the PLC/PKC pathway...|$|R

The frequency of <b>antidepressant</b> <b>drugs</b> prescription based on patients’ sex and age group (10 -year age groups), the prescribed drug group and the prescriber (general practitioner or psychiatrist) was assessed. Results - In whole, 3. 1 % of prescriptions included <b>antidepressant</b> <b>drugs.</b> Females` share of receiving <b>antidepressant</b> <b>drugs</b> was 63. 7 % and males’ was 36. 3 %. Maximum prescription rate was for the age group of 30 - 39 years (28 %), while the lowest rate of <b>antidepressant</b> <b>drugs</b> prescription belonged to the age groups of fewer than 10 years and over 80 years.

In this study, we investigated whether 44 oral <b>antidepressant</b> <b>drugs,</b> which have not previously been tested for effi cacy through gavage, could be adapted to the simple suspension method. Materials and Methods: Adaptability of antidepressants to the simple suspension method was assessed by incubating at room temperature a drug in 20 mL of warm water (at 55 °C) in a 30 mL-syringe for 5 and 10 min.
