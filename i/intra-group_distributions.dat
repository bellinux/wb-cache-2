40|$|Each {{population}} isolate has {{a unique}} demographic history in terms of initial size, time since foundation and growth rate. These factors can shape their genetic makeup both at the individual and population level. However, {{is it possible to}} identify patterns relating genomic diversity and demographic history? To answer this question we analyzed approximately 90, 000 autosomal ancestry informative markers (AIMs) as part of the Genochip (National Geographic Society, Washington, DC & Family Tree DNA, Houston, Texas, USA) in eight Italian populations, all subject to geographic and/or cultural isolation factors. Four were from Sardinia (old and large isolates) and as many from the eastern Alps (young and small isolates). The same panel of AIMs was analyze d in literature data relative to both open and isolated European groups, for a total of 24 populations. Alpine isolates (German-speaking linguistic islands of Sappada, Sauris and Timau) showed stronger signals of genetic isolation [i. e. frequency and size of Runs of Homozygosity, LD decay and <b>intra-group</b> <b>distributions</b> of Identity by State (IBS) ] than older and larger groups (Sardinians, Basques and Orcadians). Rather unexpectedly, the ADMIXTURE and PCA analyses, as well as the comparison of intra-group IBS distributions, highlighted a noticeable genetic heterogeneity within Sappada, Sauris and Timau, likely due to relatively recent admixture events. This pattern, undetected in any other population sample, is at odds with the conventional view of a substantial genetic homogeneity within population isolates. Significance and implications of our results are discussed in relation to both micro-evolutionary aspects and bio-medical applications...|$|E
40|$|Research {{on income}} {{distribution}} in South Africa has, for obvious reasons, focused on inter-racial (inter-group) income distribution. Quite dramatic changes {{have occurred in}} inter-racial income distribution patterns since the 1970 s, with the black share of income rising {{for the first time}} and at times exceeding the rise in their population share. This implies a narrowing inter-racial income gap. Data on income distribution remain scarce, so that it remains difficult to obtain the full picture about changes in income distribution. In particular, widening inequality within the black population has received much attention. Rises in black unemployment and in black wages have had inequality-inducing effects on black incomes. Is maldistribution of income between races now making way for maldistribution of income within race groups? Put differently, is inequality shifting from inter-group to intra-group inequality (from between group to within group inequality) ? This paper pieces together information from various sources of data (censuses, household surveys, marketing surveys, published wage data series, etc.) to inform estimates of inter- and <b>intra-group</b> <b>distribution</b> over a longer time frame, in an effort to improve analysis of income inequality and poverty trends. These income distribution patterns also have considerable implications for the growth and evolution of the South African consumer market. income distribution, South Africa, time series, poverty...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The paper {{discusses}} methodologies addressing {{income distribution}} and poverty in a Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model framework, by describing how to link CGE results with household survey data to analyze income distribution and poverty implications. The most basic approach {{is simply to}} fit the household income/expenditure to the survey data by suitable parametric distribution functions. The post-simulation poverty indices can be estimated by either assuming that the income of each individual household within the group moves proportionally with the group’s mean income, or by our proposed elasticity method. In our proposed method, we use the elasticity estimated from existing surveys to calculate the change in expenditure of each subgroup category in response {{to change in the}} household category’s mean consumption, supplied by the core model’s simulation, to derive post-simulation poverty indices. Our approach may better capture <b>intra-group</b> income <b>distribution</b> of households and moderate gains or losses in welfare from economic growths...|$|R
40|$|We {{all know}} that our eyes can {{inherently}} and effectively recognize/classify objects under complex conditions. Hence, we believe that an efficient clustering approach not only depends {{on the principles of}} physical systems by which the data are generated but also on the manner that human eyes sense the structure of the data. In this study a visual system theoretic cost criterion function is proposed and based upon which a new clustering algorithm is derived. The new cost criterion is visual sampling and Weber’s law is applied. The new criterion function can be made “kernelized” so that developed based on a visual system modeling of the multi-dimensional data where the visual system theories like different kernel functions can be used under different practical requirements. Furthermore, it evaluates the tightness of <b>intra-group’s</b> data <b>distribution</b> and the separable degree among groups simultaneously. The experimental results demonstrate that the new clustering algorithm is especially suitable for nonlinearly separable datasets...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an applied microsimulation model built on household data with explicit treatment of heterogeneity of skills, labor preferences and opportunities, and consumption preferences {{at the individual}} and/or household level, while allowing for an endogenous determination of relative prices between sectors. The model is primarily focused on labor markets and labor allocation at the household level, but consumption behavior is also modeled. Modeling choices are driven {{by a desire to}} make the best possible use of microeconomic information derived from household data. This framework supports analysis of the impact of different growth strategies on poverty and income distribution, without making use of the ""representative agent"" assumption. The model is built on household survey data and represents the behavior of 4, 508 households. Household behavioral equations are estimated econometrically. Different sets of simulation are carried out to examine the comparative statics of the model and study the impact of different growth strategies on poverty and inequality. Simulation results show the potential usefulness of this class of models to derive both poverty and inequality measures and transition matrices without prior assumptions regarding the <b>intra-group</b> income <b>distribution.</b> Market clearing equations allow for the endogenous determination of relative prices between sectors. The impact of different growth strategies on poverty and inequality is complex given general equilibrium effects and the wide range of household positions in markets for factors and goods markets. Partial equilibrium analysis or the use of representative households would miss these effects. Discussion paperNon-PRIFPRI 1 TM...|$|R
40|$|We {{examine the}} impacts of WTO {{agreements}} and domestic trade policy reforms on production, welfare and poverty in Bangladesh. A sequential dynamic computable general equilibrium (CGE) model, which takes into account accumulation effects, is used allowing for long run analysis. The study is based on 2000 SAM of Bangladesh including fifteen production sectors, four factors of production (skilled and unskilled labour, agricultural and non-agricultural capital) and mine household groups (five in rural areas and four in urban areas) based on the year 2000 household survey. To examine {{the link between the}} macro effects and micro effects in terms of poverty we use the representative household approach with actual <b>intra-group</b> income <b>distributions.</b> The study presents five simulations for which the major findings are: (1) the Doha scenario has negative implications for the overall macro economy, household welfare and poverty in Bangladesh. Terms of trade deteriorate and consumer prices, particularly food prices, increase more than nominal incomes, especially among poor households; (2) Free world trade has similar, but larger, impacts; (3) Domestic trade liberalisation induces an expansion of agricultural and light manufacturing sectors, favourable changes in the domestic terms of trade. Although the short run welfare and poverty impacts are negative, these turn positive in the long run when capital has adjusted through new investments. Rising unskilled wage rates make the poorest household the biggest winners in terms of welfare and poverty reduction; (4) Domestic liberalisation effects far outweigh those of free world trade when these scenarios are combined; (5) Remittances constitute a powerful poverty-reducing tool given their greater importance in the income of the poor.
