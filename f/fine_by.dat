5|$|During the half-time {{break of}} Luton's 3–0 defeat {{away at his}} former club York on 24 September 2011, Lawless broke his hand after {{punching}} a wall out of frustration, resulting in him being ruled out for around a month and being handed a <b>fine</b> <b>by</b> his club. He played in Luton's 2012 Conference Premier play-off Final 2–1 defeat at Wembley, coincidentally against York, on 20 May 2012. Lawless signed a one-year contract extension in July 2012, despite poor performances during the 2011–12 season making him a target for fans.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the English Civil War Lady Drake {{was joined}} at her Devon home, Ash House in the parish of Musbury, by her fourth {{daughter}} Elizabeth Drake and her husband Winston Churchill (1620–1688), a Royalist cavalry captain. Unlike his mother-in-law who had supported the Parliamentary cause, Winston had the misfortune of fighting on the losing side of the war – for which he, like so many other Cavaliers, was forced to compound; in his case £446 18s. Although Winston had paid off the <b>fine</b> <b>by</b> 1651, it had impoverished him. From this episode may derive the Churchill family motto: Fiel Pero Desdichado ("Faithful but Unfortunate").|$|E

25|$|The {{next game}} for the Reds was away to Tottenham. With Arsenal playing and winning again earlier in the day, a win was {{essential}} for United {{to go back to}} the top of the league. However, Tottenham did their North London rivals a massive favour by going ahead in the 21st minute. They should have gone two up soon after, but a poor shot from Berbatov was saved by Edwin van der Sar. Spurs defended well for the remainder of the game, and were unfortunate to concede a volleyed goal from Tevez, who had been largely anonymous for the entire game, in the last minute. The result meant that United were now two points behind Arsenal at the top of the league, but still four ahead of Chelsea, who drew 1–1 with Portsmouth. Seven United players were booked in the game at Tottenham, meaning that the club was handed a £25,000 <b>fine</b> <b>by</b> the Football Association. This was the standard fine for any team that has six or more players booked during a game. However, should the same occur again in the season, the fine would be increased to £50,000.|$|E
25|$|Result: Kinetic {{immediately}} left Tussauds, but initially {{suffered a}} lack of organization, with Haya not setting a specific list of who should buy what, which nearly resulted in the team buying two three-piece suits for Tussauds' Justin Bieber waxwork. However, the team generally negotiated well, with James in particular being a stand-out. One item which caused the team trouble was a Dashiki, which they spent the day fruitlessly searching for, with Harry H. being mistakenly told it was an Arabic garment instead of an African one. Despite being initially more organized, Atomic's sub-team, Zara and Hayley, wasted time travelling to and from Croydon {{in order to obtain}} a pocketwatch which they paid wildly over the odds for, under the mistaken belief that they were required to purchase one made of gold. On top of that, Harry M. led the team on a wild chase to buy the suit, continually asking adult tailors even after repeatedly being told that they would need to ask a children's tailor for a suit in Bieber's dimensions. Lizzie also made a serious mistake by deciding not to negotiate any discount on a set of shoes {{near the end of the}} day, resulting in a massive fine, with Lord Sugar noting that they would have actually received less of a <b>fine</b> <b>by</b> just not buying the shoes. Kinetic spent £969.10, while Atomic spent £1,480.87.|$|E

In addition, she felt her husband was too emotionally immature to be a parent, having watched his daily interactions with other people; she believed he was the one in need of parenting.

500|$|On March 10, 2016, FCC Deputy General Counsel David Gossett {{announced}} that the Commission would investigate Media General's actions as possibly being in violation of Section 310(d) of the Communications Act.

He also stated that the FCC could consider a license revocation hearing against Media General under Section 312 of the Communications Act. On March 23, 2016, the Supreme Court of Georgia struck down the injunction without addressing the litigation, and Gray took back control of WAGT. On July 13, 2016, Media General was issued a $700,000 <b>fine</b> <b>by</b> the FCC. WAGT's spectrum sold for $40,763,036.|$|E
