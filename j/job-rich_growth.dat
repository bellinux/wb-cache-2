40|$|This Selected Issues {{paper for}} France {{provides}} an analytical framework {{to explain the}} consequences of the downward shift in the unemployment/wages relationship. This framework is also used to analyze possible changes in the equilibrium unemployment rate resulting from cuts in employers’ social security contributions and movements in the user cost of capital. The contribution of wage moderation to the reduction in the equilibrium unemployment is quantified. The paper also addresses the question of fiscal benefits of <b>job-rich</b> <b>growth</b> in France during 1997 – 2000. ...|$|E

40|$|The paper aims to {{shed light}} on the effects of {{different}} types of financing constraints on firm sales and employment growth in Emerging Europe before and after the onset of the financial crisis. It analyzes the group of emerging NMS- 10 economies (plus Turkey) and the group of economically and financially lagging Western Balkan countries. The paper demonstrates that financing constraints significantly obstruct firm growth, particularly in the Western Balkan countries, which calls for policy intervention to ensure swifter <b>job-rich</b> <b>growth</b> and catching-up with the rest of Europe. It also emphasizes that particular firm characteristics are essential for growth in Emerging Europe and demonstrates that exporting only and innovating are recipes for faster firm growth, while importing only and a high foreign ownership share seriously retard firm growth. Finally, it stresses the importance of the particular institutional environment for firms to thrive...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to provide a measure of the {{relationship}} between employment and output growth in Italy and to illustrate its dynamics across a relatively extended time-span (1970 - 2004). Given the well-known and persisting regional differences of labour market performance and dynamics in Italy, our analytical approach favours the exploitation of spatially disaggregated information, employing regional (NUTS 2) data. The availability of industry composition of employment and value added also allows light to be shed on sector employment intensity of output growth, and the estimation of sector elasticity to GDP describes structural change. The empirical analysis supplies quantitative information about the evolution of employment elasticity during the period considered, clearly depicting the well-known period of <b>job-rich</b> <b>growth</b> (observed since the mid- 1990 s), after a period of jobless growth. The outcomes also show how regional levels of analysis, together with industry breakdown, may provide very useful information, especially on policy grounds and the desirability of the extension of the study to European level. employment elasticity, growth, productivity, regions...|$|E
40|$|Preliminary version The 1992 - 1993 income policy {{agreements}} {{were crucial}} {{to introduce the}} wage moderation, favouring the employment growth, helping the fiscal adjustment and finally the joining of the Euro currency. In 1993 the wage bargaining was specialised with macro-stability devoted to the national contracts level and the wages micro-flexibility to the firm-level. The main national contracts halted any price-wages spiral, driving the inflation expectations and coordinating the wage dynamics. The diffusion of firm-level flexible wage-premia remained confined to the medium-large firms; productivity gains were only partly distributed to wages; insufficient elements of wage flexibility and differentiation were introduced. Compared to the other European countries Italy {{can be considered a}} low wages country; especially in the Southern regions, where the larger share of irregular jobs and poverty is concentrated. The overall effects are not obvious: the income distribution could be biased toward a reduction of the labour share; there is a consensus that the <b>job-rich</b> <b>growth</b> period experienced since 1995 was mainly due to the wage moderation; the predominance of a national level bargaining has not jet given rise to wage differentials reflecting the higher unemployment in the South...|$|E
