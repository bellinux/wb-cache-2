5|$|A manga adaptation, {{illustrated}} by Ayato Sasakura, was serialized <b>in</b> <b>ASCII</b> Media Works' manga magazine Dengeki Daioh between the April 2005 and October 2011 issues. The individual chapters were collected {{and published in}} ten tankōbon volumes from October 27, 2005 and October 27, 2011. A special limited edition version of volume two was bundled with a booklet titled Grimoire including contributions from guest artists and writers for various illustrations, manga, and short stories. Viz Media licensed the manga for English distribution in North America. Viz released six volumes between April 17, 2007 and September 21, 2010, but then cancelled {{the release of the}} final four volumes. The manga is also licensed in South Korea by Daewon C.I., in Taiwan and Hong Kong by Kadokawa Media, and in Germany by Egmont.|$|E
5|$|The {{game is a}} {{spin-off}} of Key's earlier game Little Busters! {{rated for}} all ages and its expanded, adult version Little Busters! Ecstasy. Kudryavka appears as a heroine in both Little Busters! and Ecstasy. Kud Wafter is an expansion of Kudryavka's story after the events of Ecstasy and is written by Chika Shirokiri. Na-Ga and Itaru Hinoue returned as co-art directors. The game ranked as the best-selling PC game sold in Japan for {{the time of its}} release. A manga adaptation illustrated by Bakutendō was serialized <b>in</b> <b>ASCII</b> Media Works' Dengeki G's Magazine. A 40-minute theatrical anime adaptation by J.C.Staff will premiere in Q4 2019.|$|E
5|$|To Heart 2 has {{received}} multiple manga adaptations since its original visual novel release. The first manga series was illustrated by Haruka Ogataya and serialized in the shōnen manga magazine Dengeki Daioh between February 21, 2005 and January 21, 2007. The individual chapters were later compiled into three bound volumes published by MediaWorks between October 22, 2005 and May 26, 2007. The second manga adaptation, titled To Heart 2: Colorful Note, is a retelling {{of the entire}} To Heart 2 story. Colorful Note was illustrated by Tsuna Kitaumi and serialized in the shōnen manga magazine Monthly GFantasy between March 18, 2005 and March 18, 2008. It was later collected into five volumes published by Square Enix between October 27, 2005 and April 27, 2009. Another manga, titled To Heart 2 SD: Seitokai Days, was serialized in the manga magazine Manga 4-koma Kings Palette Lite between July 2, 2008 and September 2, 2010 and was illustrated by Natsuki Miyama. It was released as a single bound volume by Ichijinsha on December 22, 2009. A manga adaptation of To Heart 2 Another Days was serialized <b>in</b> <b>ASCII</b> Media Works's Dengeki G's Festival! Comic between July 26, 2008 and August 26, 2010. Another Days was illustrated by Sō, and was collected into two bound volumes released on February 26, 2010 and April 27, 2011.|$|E

25|$|Each file {{stored in}} an ar archive {{includes}} a file header to store {{information about the}} file. The common format is as follows. Numeric values are encoded <b>in</b> <b>ASCII</b> and all values right-padded with ASCII spaces (0x20).|$|E
25|$|Since the 19th century, Pali {{has also}} been written in the Roman script. An {{alternate}} scheme devised by Frans Velthuis, called the Velthuis scheme (see § Text <b>in</b> <b>ASCII)</b> allows for typing without diacritics using plain ASCII methods, but is arguably less readable than the standard IAST system, which uses diacritical marks.|$|E
25|$|The {{typewriter}} apostrophe (') was inherited {{by computer}} keyboards, {{and is the}} only apostrophe character available in the (7-bit) ASCII character encoding, at code value 0x27 (39). As such, it is a highly overloaded character. <b>In</b> <b>ASCII,</b> it represents a left single quotation mark, right single quotation mark, apostrophe, vertical line or prime (punctuation marks), or an acute accent (modifier letters).|$|E

25|$|Kamikaze Explorer! had overall {{very good}} sales, {{charting}} as the best-selling visual novel {{at the time}} of its release, and the fourth best-selling visual novel of 2011 according to Getchu.com. Various media based on the game has been produced, such as two manga adaptations which serialized <b>in</b> <b>ASCII</b> Media Works' Dengeki Hime magazine, an art book, music CD, and merchandise.|$|E
25|$|For {{historical}} reasons, {{there is}} a similar but larger character, , which is also included <b>in</b> <b>ASCII</b> but {{often referred to as}} caret instead. It is, however, unsuitable for use as a diacritic on modern computer systems, as it is a spacing character. Another spacing circumflex character in Unicode is the smaller , mainly used in phonetic notationsor as a sample of the diacritic in isolation.|$|E
25|$|Other than {{counting}} {{the number of}} ions crossing the channel, sometimes it is desirable to study their behavior at different regions of the channel. Such examples would be the average occupancy of ions or their average moving velocity inside the channel or a nanopore. BioMOCA has been equipped with the option of dumping every ions position, average and instantaneous velocities, potential and kinetic energies, average and instantaneous displacements and other info at every step (or few steps) of the simulations <b>in</b> <b>ASCII</b> format, so such trajectory information could be studied later on to gather further statistics. From a technical point of view however, dumping such information for tens of ions, even at every few hundreds of time steps, could slow down the simulations and end up with huge files accumulating to tens of gigabytes. Loading such files later on from disk storage is also a very time consuming and computationally inefficient procedure. Over and above that, recoding the numerical information <b>in</b> <b>ASCII</b> format does not hold its machine precision and has loss of accuracy.|$|E
50|$|Another {{alternative}} is Ascii85, which encodes four binary characters <b>in</b> five <b>ASCII</b> characters. Ascii85 {{is used in}} PostScript and PDF formats.|$|R
5000|$|For example, {{the string}} [...] "Wiki" [...] (01010111 01101001 01101011 01101001 <b>in</b> 8-bit <b>ASCII)</b> can be {{encrypted}} with the repeating key 11110011 as follows: ...|$|R
50|$|For example, {{lowercase}} i {{would be}} represented <b>in</b> the <b>ASCII</b> encoding by binary 1101001 = hexadecimal 69 (i is the ninth letter) = decimal 105.|$|R
25|$|SAMPA was devised as a hack to {{work around}} the {{inability}} of text encodings to represent IPA symbols. Consequently, as Unicode support for IPA symbols becomes more widespread, the necessity for a separate, computer-readable system for representing the IPA <b>in</b> <b>ASCII</b> decreases. However, text input relies on specific keyboard encodings or input devices. For this reason, SAMPA and X-SAMPA are still widely used in computational phonetics and in speech technology.|$|E
25|$|However, the Unicode hyphen is {{awkward to}} enter on most keyboards, so the hyphen-minus {{character}} remains very common. They {{are often used}} instead of dashes or minus signs in situations where the preferred characters are unavailable (such as ASCII-only text), where the preferred characters take effort to enter (via dialog boxes or multi-key, unmemorable keyboard shortcuts), or when the writer is unaware of the distinction. Some writers use two hyphen-minuses (--) to represent a dash <b>in</b> <b>ASCII</b> text.|$|E
25|$|In {{most other}} written media and in {{television}} news reporting, Literary Arabic is used. Literary Arabic is a standardized language {{based on the}} language of the Quran, i.e. Classical Arabic. The Egyptian vernacular is almost universally written in the Arabic alphabet for local consumption, although it is commonly transcribed into Latin letters or in the International Phonetic Alphabet in linguistics text and textbooks aimed at teaching non-native learners. Also, it is written <b>in</b> <b>ASCII</b> Latin alphabet mainly online and in SMSs.|$|E
50|$|Some romanization schemes, like Jyutping, use tone numbers. Even for Pinyin, tone {{numbers are}} used instead when {{diacritics}} are not available, as <b>in</b> basic <b>ASCII</b> text.|$|R
25|$|When an en dash is {{unavailable}} in {{a particular}} character encoding environment—as <b>in</b> the <b>ASCII</b> character set—there are some conventional substitutions. Often two hyphens are the substitute.|$|R

25|$|Although {{often said}} to be obsolete, in fact the {{half-width}} katakana are still used in many systems and encodings. For example, the titles of mini discs can only be entered <b>in</b> <b>ASCII</b> or half-width katakana, and half-width katakana are commonly used in computerized cash register displays, on shop receipts, and Japanese digital television and DVD subtitles. Several popular Japanese encodings such as EUC-JP, Unicode and Shift JIS have half-width katakana code as well as full-width. By contrast, ISO-2022-JP has no half-width katakana, and is mainly used over SMTP and NNTP.|$|E
25|$|By early 1992, {{the search}} was on for a good byte stream {{encoding}} of multi-byte character sets. The draft ISO 10646 standard contained a non-required annex called UTF-1 that provided a byte stream encoding of its 32-bit code points. This encoding was not satisfactory on performance grounds, among other problems, and the biggest problem was probably {{that it did not}} have a clear separation between ASCII and non-ASCII: new UTF-1 tools would be backward compatible with ASCII-encoded text, but UTF-1-encoded text could confuse existing code expecting ASCII (or extended ASCII), because it could contain continuation bytes in the range 0x21–0x7E that meant something else <b>in</b> <b>ASCII,</b> e.g., 0x2F for '/', the Unix path directory separator, and this example is reflected in the name and introductory text of its replacement. The table below was derived from a textual description in the annex.|$|E
25|$|Persona Q was {{announced}} in 2013 alongside the mainline entry Persona 5, fellow spin-off title , and the PlayStation 3 port of Persona 4 Arena Ultimax. The game was released in Japan on June 5, 2014. People who pre-ordered the game received a special soundtrack sampler CD. The CD features select original music from the game, in addition to special re-arrangements by the Atlus sound team {{that can only be}} heard on this CD. The full soundtrack was released on July 16. There is also a Persona Q: Shadow of the Labyrinth Famitsu DX Pack with the game itself, a B2-size tapestry illustrated by the Persona Q anime staff, an A3-size clear poster illustrated by Atlus, a set of five different visual clear file folders, an original mug cup, and a Graphig paper figure of Rei. A manga adaptation illustrated by Akaume will begin serialization <b>in</b> <b>ASCII</b> Media Works' Dengeki Maoh magazine in its October 2014 issue. In 2015, two manga adaptations were released. Side: P4 written by Mizunomoto centeres on Persona 4 protagonist. It launched in Kodansha's Monthly Shōnen Sirius magazine in January. Side: P3 written by Sō Tobita centeres on Persona 3 protagonist. It was launched in Kodansha's Bessatsu Shōnen Magazine in February. Side: P3 will end in November. Like previous games such as Catherine, Atlus posted a statement requesting that players refrain from posting video spoilers of the game's later story events on sharing sites upon its release in Japan.|$|E
