40|$|Aim The aim of {{this study}} is to evaluate, both in vitro and in vivo, two {{different}} types of implant-abutment connections: screwed connection and cemented connection, analyzing the permeability of the IAI to bacterial colonization and the stability to chewing forces. Materials and Methods In this study were compared two different types of implant-abutment connections: internal <b>hexagon</b> <b>screwed</b> connection (Winsix®, BioSAF IN, Ancona, Italy) Group 1; and internal hexagon cemented-conical connection (Bone System®, Milano, Italy) Group 2. Group 1 and Group 2 were compared on three levels: impermeability to bacterial penetration an in vitro study, resistance to loading for 5 years a simulated computer model, type of peri-implant bacterial colonization and health of peri-implant soft tissues around the implant for 2 year in an in vivo study. Results The results had showed the lower stability to the screwed implant-abutment connection than the cemented implant-abutment connection both for the permeability to the bacterial colonization than for the stability to the chewing forces. Conclusion Also if the implants long-term failures are consequences of multi-factorial elements the choice of an adequate implant system is fundamental for the long-term success. Also the choice of connection system is very important and would be preferable to choose implants with cemented connection instead of implants with screwed connection...|$|R
40|$|Background: Microgap {{is defined}} as the {{microscopic}} space that exists between the implant body and abutment. The main mechanism proposed for microgap-related crestal bone loss is the role of this space as a trap for bacteria and thus, as a putative etiological factor for inflammatory reaction in the peri-implant soft tissues. The aim of this paper was to evaluate, with X-ray 3 D microtomography, the microscopic space that exists between the implant body and abutment with internal hexagon versus cone morse. Methods: A total of 20 implants were used in this in vitro study. Ten implants per group were used. Ten implants presented a <b>screw</b> retained internal <b>hexagon</b> abutment (Group I) and 10 had a Cone Morse taper internal connection (Group II). Results: In both types of Cone Morse internal connection implants there was no detectable separation at the implant/abutment {{in the area of the}} conical connection, and there was an absolute congruity without any microgaps between abutment and implant. No line was visible separating the implant and the abutment. On the contrary, in the internal <b>hexagon</b> <b>screwed</b> abutment numerous gaps and voids were present between the implant body and abutment. Conclusion: The results of the present study seem, then, to support the hypothesis that the length and the characteristics of the implantabutment joint could be a reason for the observed differences in mechanical stability...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to investigate aspects of hybrid joint design for a shear connection. Part 1 is design considerations and a case study based on a engine mount. In Part 2, an experimental study is conducted regarding how relaxation and creep affects properties of a hybrid joint between carbon fiber vinylester and steel. Failure modes, loss of clamped force and ultimate strength of the joint and how these are affected by elevated temperature and different clamped forces are presented. Test specimens were 184 × 45 × 5 mm CFRP, in double lap joint between two steel plates of same dimensions, with either a single or double M 10 <b>hexagon</b> flange <b>screw.</b> Creep/ relaxation testing was preformed over a 28 day period. Results shows that the amount of initial clamped force does not effect amount of loss of clamped force, but increase in temperature significantly does. Average loss was between 8. 3 an 8. 8 % for single joint specimens, initial torque of 28, 37 and 46 Nm, and 10. 8 % for double joint specimens, 37 Nm. But losses for specimens subjected to heat, 80 °C, was 35. 5 %. Ultimate bearing strength of the lamina was not effected by any circumstances. Slip load was lower for specimens clamped with lower clamped force, the loss over the 28 day period was not enough to produced any clear results regarding the amount of loss. But tendencies point towards a lowered slip load of the same magnitude as the loss of clamped force i. e around 8 - 9 %. Slip load for specimens subjected to 80 °C did not decreased, even though the clamped force had been lowered. All specimens fail in bearing, single bolted joints had a far more progressive failure than the double joints, which failed catastrophically...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of an experimental campaign aimed to evaluate the performance of timber beams strengthened in bending using GFRP (Glass Fiber Reinforced Polymer) plates mechanically attached with high-strength metal screws. Modest ratios of GFRP composite reinforcement can increase beam load-carrying capacity and manipulate failure mode from the brittle tensile in the unreinforced beams to a more extensible failure in the strengthened timber beams. Application of mechanical reinforcement presents a solution of reversibility, compatibility and durability for reinforced timber. The experimental campaign focused on load-deflection relationship and failure modes in order to increase the bending capacity and stiffness of the timber beam. Oak beams with dimensions 145 x 145 x 2450 mm were reinforced with un-bonded pultruded GFRP plates. <b>Hexagon</b> head coach <b>screws</b> 16 mm diameter, 130 mm length, grade 8. 8, were used to mechanically attach the reinforcement along with 34 mm outer diameter fender washers, distributing the fastening load away from the screw’s position. All beams were tested until failure under the four-point bending configuration. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the reinforcement method and ability to reversibly repair the timber, representing a capability to be utilised in the new constructions or restoration of timber structures...|$|R

Nos implantes, cônico interno e hexágono externo, com a carga axi-oclusal de 100 N sobre a prótese parcial fixa metalocerâmica de 03 elementos, retida por 02 minipilares cônicos e 02 implantes de mesmo modelo, objetivou-se, por fotoelasticidade: Mensurar e comparar as tensões transmitidas às regiões adjacentes aos implantes; Avaliar e comparar a relação entre o local de aplicação de carga e a distribuição das tensões nas regiões adjacentes aos implantes; Avaliar e comparar a influência do modelo da conexão implante-pilar nas tensões transmitidas ao redor dos terços {{cervical}}, médio e apical dos implantes. Foram confeccionados 10 modelos fotoelásticos, sendo 05 contendo 02 implantes de hexágono externo de 3, 75 x 13 mm e 02 minipilares de hexágono externo, parafusados e torqueados a 20 N e 05 contendo 02 implantes friccional de 3, 75 x 13 mm e 02 minipilares, ativados de acordo com as recomendações do fabricante. Os modelos fotoelásticos de ambos os grupos foram submetidos à carga axial de 100 N variando os pontos sobre a superfície oclusal (G 1 - ponto no pilar 47; G 2 - ponto no pilar 45; G 3 - ponto pôntico 46; G 4 ? ponto no pilar 47 e no pôntico 46; G 5 ? ponto no pilar 45 e no pôntico 46, G 6 ? ponto nos pilares 47 e 45 e; G 7 - ponto no pôntico 46 e nos pilares 47 e 45. Para análise fotoelástica, dividiu-se as regiões circunvizinhas aos implantes em 11 pontos, sendo os pontos 3 e 9 nos ápices dos implantes; 2, 4, 8 e 10 no terço médio dos implantes; 1, 5, 7 e 11 na cervical dos implantes e o 6 no ponto médio entre os implantes. As imagens das tensões no modelo fotoelástico foram obtidas e mensuradas pelo conjunto do equipamento do polariscópio de reflexão. A tensão nos implantes bucais, cônico interno e hexágono externo, não apresentaram diferenças significativas entre sí. Não houve diferença significativa, nos diferentes pontos de carga axial. Houve diferença significativa para a região apical dos implantes cônico interno. Houve diferença significativa para a distribuição da tensão, nos pontos estudados. Conclui-se que as tensões transmitidas ao redor dos implantes, cônico interno e hexágono externo, foram similares; Os locais de aplicação da carga produziram tensões semelhantes, em ambos os sistemas de implantes; Independente da localização da aplicação da carga e do tipo de implantes, as tensões ocorreram nos ápices dos implantes, concentrando-se no implante mais próximo a carga; O modelo cônico interno da conexão implante-pilar influenciou na transferência das tensões para o terço apical do implante. The {{quest for}} better distribution {{of stress in}} areas adjacent to implants {{is the subject of}} many studies and enables the evolution of implant dentistry. In implant, tapered internal and external hexagon, with an axi-occlusal load of 100 N on the metal ceramic fixed partial denture of 03 elements and retained by 02 conical mini pillars 02 implants of the same pattern, the objective was to, by photoelasticity: Measure and compare the stress transmitted to regions adjacent to the implants; Evaluate and compare the relationship between the location of load application and distribution of stress in the regions adjacent to the implants; Evaluate and compare the influence of the connection implant-abutment model tensions transmitted around the cervical, middle and apical thirds of the implants. Ten photoelastic models were made, 05 containing 02 external hexagon implants of 3. 75 x 13 mm and 02 external <b>hexagon</b> mini pillars, <b>screwed</b> and torqued to 20 N and 05 containing 02 frictional implants of 3. 75 x 13 mm and 02 mini pillars, activated according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The photoelastic models of both groups were subjected to an axial load of 100 N varying the points on the occlusal surface (G 1 - point on pillar 47; G 2 - point on pillar 45; G 3 - point on pontic 46; G 4 - point on pillar 47 and on pontic 46; G 5 - point on pillar 45 and on pontic 46, G 6 - point on pillars 47 and 45 and; G 7 - point on pontic 46 and pillars 47 and 45. For photoelastic analysis, the regions surrounding the implants were divided in 11 points, points 3 and 9 being located in the apex of the implants; 2, 4, 8 and 10 in the middle third of the implants; 1, 5, 7 and 11 in the cervical of the implants, and 6 on the midpoint between the implants. The images of the stress in the photoelastic model were obtained and measured by the entire reflection polariscope equipment. The oral implants, tapered internal and external hexagon, did not presented any significant differences in stress. There {{was no significant difference in}} the different axial load points. There was significant difference to the apical region of the tapered internal implant. There was significant difference in the stress distribution on the points studied.
