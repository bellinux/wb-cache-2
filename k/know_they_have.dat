25|$|In {{a typical}} class action, a {{plaintiff}} sues a defendant or {{a number of}} defendants {{on behalf of a}} group, or class, of absent parties. This differs from a traditional lawsuit, where one party sues another party for redress of a wrong, and all of the parties are present in court. Although standards differ between states and countries, class actions are most common where the allegations involve {{a large number of people}} (usually 40 or more) who have been injured by the same defendant in the same way. Instead of each damaged person bringing his or her own lawsuit, the class action allows all the claims of all class members—whether they <b>know</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> been damaged or not—to be resolved in a single proceeding through the efforts of the representative plaintiff(s) and appointed class counsel.|$|E
25|$|A {{complete}} {{understanding of}} the causes of prostate cancer remains elusive. The primary risk factors are obesity, age and family history. Prostate cancer is very uncommon in men younger than 45, but becomes more common with advancing age. The average age at the time of diagnosis is 70. However, many men never <b>know</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> prostate cancer. Autopsy studies of Chinese, German, Israeli, Jamaican, Swedish, and Ugandan men who died of other causes have found prostate cancer in 30% of men in their fifties, and in 80% of men in their seventies. Men who have first-degree family members with prostate cancer appear to have double the risk of getting the disease compared to men without prostate cancer in the family. This risk appears to be greater for men with an affected brother than for men with an affected father. In the United States in 2005, there were an estimated 230,000 new cases of prostate cancer and 30,000 deaths due to prostate cancer. Men with high blood pressure are more likely to develop prostate cancer. There is a small increased risk of prostate cancer associated with lack of exercise. A 2010 study found that prostate basal cells were the most common site of origin for prostate cancers.|$|E

The tour was an unhappy one for the Australian team, losing the series three Tests to nil to England and the {{embryonic}} World Series Cricket concept caused rifts between the team members. Hughes did not play much cricket early in the tour; Wisden Cricketers' Almanack saying that he was [...] "kept in such idleness that [...] might have claimed restraint of trade." [...] He was selected to make his Test debut in the fifth Test, after the series had already been decided. Hughes, bitter about his treatment by the tour selectors, was unhappy.

[...] Many of the KLF's friends and collaborators gave their reactions in the magazine. Movie director Bill Butt said that [...] "Like everything, they're dealing with it in a very realistic way, a fresh, unbitter way, which is very often not the case. A lot of bands disappear with such a terrible loss of dignity". Scott Piering said that [...] "They've got a huge buzz off this, that's for sure, because it's something that's finally thrilling. It's scary to have thrown away a fortune which I <b>know</b> <b>they</b> <b>have.</b> Just the idea of starting over is exciting. Starting over on what? Well, they have such great ideas, like buying submarines". Even Kenny Gates, who as a director of the KLF's distributors APT stood to lose financially from the move, called it [...] "Conceptually and philosophically... absolutely brilliant".
