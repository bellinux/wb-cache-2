During this highly productive period he also published the first version of his popular book Vibration Analysis.|$|E
40|$|A {{simple method}} for an {{unsteady}} aerodynamic model tuning is proposed in this study. This method {{is based on}} the direct modification of the aerodynamic influence coefficient matrices. The aerostructures test wing 2 flight-test data is used to demonstrate the proposed model tuning method.

In this study, unsteady aerodynamic model tunings are performed at two time invariant flight conditions, at Mach numbers of 0. 390 and 0. 456. When the Mach number for the unsteady model tuning approaches to the measured fluttering Mach number, 0. 502, at the flight altitude of 9, 837 ft, the estimated <b>flutter</b> <b>speed</b> is approached to the measured <b>flutter</b> <b>speed</b> at this altitude.

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation was}} made of a preloaded spring-tab flutter model {{to determine the effects}} on <b>flutter</b> <b>speed</b> of aspect ratio, tab frequency, and preloaded spring constant. The rudder was mass-balanced, and the flutter mode studied was essentially one of three degrees of freedom (fin bending coupled with rudder and tab oscillations). Inasmuch as the spring was preloaded, the tab-spring system was a nonlinear one. Frequency of the tab was the most significant parameter in this study, and an increase in <b>flutter</b> <b>speed</b> with increasing frequency is indicated. At a given frequency, the tab of high aspect ratio is shown to have a slightly lower <b>flutter</b> <b>speed</b> than the one of low aspect ratio.

40|$|This study {{deals with}} the {{possibility}} of raising the <b>flutter</b> <b>speed</b> of an aeroelastic system by feedback control. Emphasis is given to feedback control through a control surface driven by a powered actuator. It is shown that only for certain aeroelastic systems is it possible to significantly raise the <b>flutter</b> <b>speed</b> by this type of feedback control. In addition, a second type of feedback control is considered, a jet reaction torquer acting on the wing itself. A marked increase in <b>flutter</b> <b>speed</b> is possible in essentially all aeroelastic systems with this form of control. Despite the fact that this type of controller requires more power than the control surface actuator, its use may be practical in many cases. The question of the reliability of the feedback control used to raise <b>flutter</b> <b>speed</b> is becoming less important in this era of missiles where the entire system is controlled by automatic devices. Part I discusses the basic problem. Parts II and III develop a general feedback theory. This theory, when applied to a specific aeroelastic system, permits ready determination of whether an increase in <b>flutter</b> <b>speed</b> is possible for that system. Parts IV and V consider numerical investigations of many systems using a control surface actuator. Analyses are made by both the general feedback theory and by analog computer, showing similar numerical results.

40|$|Two {{formulations}} of the oblique wing flutter problem are presented: one formulation allows wing bending deformations and the rigid body roll {{degree of freedom}} while the second formulation includes bending-torsional deformation and roll degrees of freedom. Flutter is found to occur in two basic modes. The first mode is associated with bending-roll coupling and occurs at low reduced frequency values. The other instability mode is primarily one of classical bending-torsion with negligible roll coupling; this mode occurs at much higher reduced frequencies. The occurrence of bending-roll coupling mode leads to lower <b>flutter</b> <b>speeds</b> while the bending-torsion mode is associated with higher <b>flutter</b> <b>speeds.</b> The ratio of the wing mass moment of inertial in roll to the fuselage moment of inertia evidently {{plays a major role}} in the determination of which of the two instabilities is critical...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} piezoelectric (PZT) material on the <b>flutter</b> <b>speed,</b> vibration mode and frequency, and energy harvesting power and efficiency of a flexible flag in various fluids. We develop a fully coupled fluid-solid-electric model by combining the inviscid vortex sheet model with a linear electro-mechanical coupling model. A resistance only circuit and a resonant resistance-inductance (RL) circuit are considered. For a purely resistive circuit, an increased electro-mechanical coupling factor results in an increased <b>flutter</b> <b>speed,</b> vibration frequency, averaged electric power and efficiency. A consistent optimal resistance is found that maximizes the <b>flutter</b> <b>speed</b> and the energy harvesting power. For a resonant RL circuit, by tuning the inductance to match the circuit frequency to the flag's vibration frequency, the <b>flutter</b> <b>speed</b> can be greatly decreased, and a larger averaged power and efficiency are obtained. We also consider a model scale set-up with several commonly used commercial materials for operating in air and water. Typical ranges of dimensionless parameters are obtained for four types of material that span {{a wide range of}} solid density and rigidity values. We find that the resistance only circuit is more effective when the flag is placed in a lighter fluid (e. g. air), while the RL circuit is able to reduce the <b>flutter</b> <b>speed</b> when the flag is placed in a heavier fluid (e. g. water) ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} an analytical study on optimization of a laminated composite wing structure for achieving a maximum <b>flutter</b> <b>speed</b> and a minimum weight without strength penalty. The investigation {{is carried out}} {{within the range of}} incompressible airflow and subsonic speed. In the first stage of the optimization, attention has been paid mainly to the effect on <b>flutter</b> <b>speed</b> of the bending, torsion and, more importantly, the bending-torsional coupling rigidity, which is usually associated with asymmetric laminate lay-up. The study has shown that the torsional rigidity plays a dominant role, while the coupling rigidity has also quite a significant effect on the <b>flutter</b> <b>speed.</b> In the second stage of the optimization, {{attention has been paid to}} the weight and laminate strength of the wing structure, which is affected by the variation in laminate lay-up in the first stage.

The angle of sweepback was varied from 0 degrees to 60 degrees on wings of aspect ratio 4, and the aspect ratio was varied from 2. 4 to 6. 4 on wings with 45 degrees of sweepback. The results are presented as ratios between the experimental <b>flutter</b> <b>speeds</b> and the reference <b>flutter</b> <b>speeds</b> calculated on the basis of incompressible two-dimensional flow. These ratios, designated the flutter-speed ratios, are given as functions of Mach number for the various wings. The flutter-speed ratios were characterized, in most cases, by values near 1. 0 at subsonic speeds with large increases in the speed ratios in the range of supersonic speeds investigated. Increasing the sweep effected increases in the flutter-speed ratios between 0 degrees and 30 degrees followed by progressive reductions of the speed ratios to nearly 1. 0 as the sweep was increased from 30 degrees to 60 degrees. Reducing the aspect ratio from 6. 4 to 2. 4 resulted in progressively larger values of the flutter-speed ratios throughout the Mach number range investigated...|$|R
