500|$|On May 5, 2011, Interscope {{sent out}} {{an e-mail to}} radio {{stations}} across the United States, which stated that [...] "The Edge of Glory" [...] was to be released on Monday, May 9, 2011, as {{the first of two}} promotional single for Born This Way. It was to serve as the first song in the [...] "Countdown to Born This Way" [...] promotion on iTunes Store. However, after its release to the digital stores, [...] "The Edge of Glory" [...] started selling a considerable amount of digital downloads, prompting Gaga to make it the third single from Born This Way. On her Twitter account Gaga revealed the cover for the single. It showed Gaga topless with <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>open,</b> wearing her facial prosthetics from the [...] "Born This Way" [...] cover, and her hair wildly cascading around her.|$|E
2500|$|The {{woman has}} a kanzashi hairpin and a comb placed casually in her hair. [...] She has <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>open</b> slightly, {{as if she were}} about to speak, and has a seductive look in her eyes. [...] The {{background}} is dusted with muscovite, a variety of mica, which produces a glittering effect. [...] The vegetable pigments have faded from their original colours; the kimono was most likely a pale blue.|$|E
2500|$|A more {{effective}} {{variant of the}} over-the-mouth gag is called the cleave gag. Instead of being tied over the person's mouth, the scarf or cloth is pulled between his or her teeth. While such a gag of thin material is not very effective, a thick scarf {{can be used to}} hold his or <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>open.</b> [...] Cleave gags are difficult to remove as they are between the teeth, not over the mouth. When it is applied properly, the gagged person's speech is muffled, but not completely silenced.|$|E
60|$|She seemed stricken. The kindly eyes changed, rolled. <b>Her</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>opened</b> wide. She {{gasped and}} fainted in his arms.|$|R
60|$|Miriam looked up. <b>Her</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>opened,</b> <b>her</b> {{dark eyes}} blazed and winced, {{but she said}} nothing. She {{swallowed}} her anger and her shame, bowing her dark head.|$|R
60|$|<b>Her</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>opened</b> and <b>her</b> frothy tongue lolled out. Jones {{pointed to}} her quivering sides and then raised her eyelids. We saw the eyes already glazing, solemnly fixed.|$|R
60|$|But at {{the look}} on his face she stopped, with <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>open.</b>|$|E
60|$|She {{took the}} path, leaving Millicent with <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>open,</b> too amazed to speak again, {{and yet not}} knowing why.|$|E
60|$|Caroline, Duchess of Worcester, sat {{perfectly}} {{still for a}} moment with <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>open,</b> a condition which was entirely natural but unbecoming.|$|E
60|$|She shot up {{from her}} chair like an automaton--rigid and upright, <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>opened</b> as for a wild shriek, but all power of sound was choked in her throat. She ran into the inner room like one possessed, <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> still wide <b>open</b> for the frantic shriek which would not come, for that agonizing call for help.|$|R
6000|$|Gavinia {{thought she}} heard the chink of another five shillings, and <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>opened</b> so wide that a {{chaffinch}} could have built therein. [...] "Is he {{to look for a}} bottle in the pond?" [...] she asked, eagerly.|$|R
6000|$|She {{threw back}} her kimono for Gyp to inspect her dress--a girdled cream-coloured shift, {{which made her}} ivory arms and neck seem more than ever dazzling; and <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>opened,</b> as if for a sugar-plum of praise. Then, {{lowering}} her voice, she murmured: ...|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Thomas {{listened to}} the story with <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>open,</b> lost between admiration of Augusta's courage, and regret that her {{shoulders}} should have been ruined in that fashion.|$|E
60|$|As the revellers {{came back}} from Viceregal Lodge in the mists of the evening, they met a {{temporarily}} insane woman, on a temporarily mad horse, swinging round the corners, with her eyes and <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>open,</b> and her head like {{the head of a}} Medusa. She was stopped by a man at the risk of his life, and taken out of the saddle, a limp heap, and put on the bank to explain herself. This wasted twenty minutes, and then she was sent home in a lady's 'rickshaw, still with <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>open</b> and her hands picking at her riding-gloves.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Hodges {{went over}} and looked at Liza; she was lying just as when she left in the morning, her cheeks flushed, <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>open</b> for breath, and tiny beads of sweat stood on her forehead.|$|E
6000|$|Her {{face turned}} white. <b>Her</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>opened</b> and closed. [...] "Mr. Lewisham," [...] she said deliberately, [...] "you may not believe it, {{it may sound}} impossible, but on my honour ... I did not know--I did not know for certain, that is--that my {{stepfather}} ..." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, it {{was never}} that," [...] Gavin said with such {{conviction}} that <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>opened</b> in alarm to {{ask him if he}} did not think her pretty. She did not speak, however, and he continued, [...] "You must have known that I loved you from the first night." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Help it!" [...] exclaimed Mrs. Carson. [...] "I didn't {{expect him}} to help it. What I want--" [...] Suddenly she stopped. Her eyes flashed brighter, <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>opened</b> wider, and she {{became more and more}} excited as she noticed the absence of the sheds, fences, or vegetable-beds which had found {{themselves}} {{in the course of my}} all-destroying dwelling.|$|R
60|$|He {{turned the}} corner. A woman {{was coming out}} of a doorway, loaded down with packages. Conger stepped aside to let her pass. The woman glanced at him. Suddenly her face turned white. She stared, <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>open.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Well, I {{turned down}} that kaross and next instant stepped back amazed and, {{to tell the}} truth, {{somewhat}} disappointed, for there, with <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>open,</b> lay no wondrous and spiritual Mameena, but the stout, earthly and most prosaic--Kaatje! ...|$|E
6000|$|Christie {{certainly}} did look wild, for Lucy had {{burst into the}} room like a small hurricane, and her rapid words rattled about the listeners' ears as if a hail-storm had followed the gust. While Christie still sat with <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>open,</b> too bewildered to reply, Mrs. Black said in her cosey voice: ...|$|E
2500|$|Ceaușescu fled {{with her}} husband on 22 December 1989, after the events in Timișoara led to the Romanian Revolution, but {{she and her husband}} were {{captured}} in the town of Targoviste. [...] At the show trial that took place, she answered only a few questions since her husband took a protective role, asked her to calm down and shook his head each time <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>opened</b> to reply in anger.|$|R
60|$|It went on {{just the}} same. She lay with her cheek in <b>her</b> hand, <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> fallen <b>open,</b> and the great, ghastly snores came and went.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Peter {{had listened}} with <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> wide <b>open.</b> When Peter finished, she closed {{it with a}} snap and hopped over and felt of his head.|$|R
60|$|Fiorsen was {{standing}} hall-way {{in the darkened}} room staring out into the garden, where the girl had halted, transfixed before the window, her eyes as round as saucers, <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>open,</b> her limbs rigid with interest and affright. Suddenly she turned and, gathering her garment, fled, her limbs gleaming in the moonlight.|$|E
60|$|He {{had been}} too fast. But she said nothing. He {{questioned}} her more, then got hot. It made his blood rouse to see her there, as it were, at his mercy, <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>open,</b> her eyes dilated with laughter that was afraid, apologetic, ashamed. Then Edgar came along with two buckets of milk.|$|E
60|$|The {{shock of}} this blow was so violent and sudden, that Mrs Gamp sat staring at nothing with uplifted eyes, and <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>open</b> {{as if she}} were gasping for breath, until Betsey Prig had put on her bonnet and her shawl, and was {{gathering}} the latter about her throat. Then Mrs Gamp rose--morally and physically rose--and denounced her.|$|E
60|$|He leaned towards <b>her,</b> his <b>mouth</b> <b>open,</b> {{his eyes}} wild with virtuous anger, but meeting the {{absolute}} candour of her raised glance threw himself {{back into his}} corner again.|$|R
6000|$|She {{was engaged}} in pulling onions in the little garden before her daughter's cottage {{when she saw him}} coming through the garden gate. She stood for a moment [...] "consternated," [...] as the country folks say, and then folded her arms, and with the little bunch of onions held defensively under her left elbow, awaited his approach. <b>Her</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>opened</b> and shut several times; she mumbled her {{remaining}} tooth, and once quite suddenly she curtsied, like the blink of an arc-light.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Walters rose and, {{replacing}} {{a box of}} matches in his pocket, stood watching <b>her</b> with his <b>mouth</b> <b>open.</b>|$|R
6000|$|In the car, {{sprawling}} upon {{a sort of}} bed-bench, in {{an attitude}} of elaborate self-abandonment, was a large, blond lady, wearing a fur coat and a big floriferous hat. Her head lolled back against the padded corner of the car, {{and her eyes were}} shut and <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>open.</b> [...] "Me dear!" [...] said Mr. Butteridge, in a common, loud voice, [...] "we're safe!" ...|$|E
60|$|Miss P. Gauntlet {{looked as}} though she thought {{a great deal of}} it. She {{certainly}} did think that had such an accident happened to her, she would not have spoken of it with such a voice, or before such an audience. But now her face, which was always long and thin, became longer and thinner, and she sat with <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>open,</b> expecting further news.|$|E
6000|$|... "'Now, Abu,' I said, 'directly she {{has gone}} off to sleep, you must force <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>open,</b> and put the handle of your dagger between her teeth. It will not hurt her at all. But I cannot get at the tooth unless the mouth is open, and we cannot open it until she is asleep, for the whole {{side of her face}} is swollen, and the jaw almost stiff.' ...|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Porter made no reply. <b>Her</b> <b>mouth</b> {{was wide}} <b>open</b> {{and she was}} gazing with {{starting}} eyeballs at Mr. Catesby.|$|R
60|$|She started, {{she stared}} at him with {{distended}} eyes, and <b>her</b> small <b>mouth</b> was <b>open</b> like a ring.|$|R
60|$|The greenish pallor of {{her skin}} {{intoxicated}} him, and her thin white lips had an extraordinary fascination. Her anaemia made her rather short of breath, and she held <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> slightly <b>open.</b> It seemed to add somehow to the attractiveness of her face.|$|R
