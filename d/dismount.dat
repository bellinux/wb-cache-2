5|$|A Titan's {{durability}} {{depends on}} its size; larger Titans will take more effort to defeat than others and a few are immune to Crash's attacks. To defeat them, Crash has to jack a smaller Titan to fight them. On defeating the larger Titan, he can <b>dismount</b> the Titan he previously jacked and directly jack the larger Titan. The dismounted Titan will then be destroyed.|$|E
5|$|Florida mice breed {{throughout}} the year with a peak between July and December, a lesser peak in January and February, and a lull or cessation in April and May. Unlike most murids, copulatory behavior lacks intravaginal thrusting, the intromission thrust is more intense than the <b>dismount,</b> there is no lock, and ejaculation occurs with every thrust.|$|E
5|$|Following Nationals, Liukin {{was named}} to the American team for the World Championships in Stuttgart, Germany, where she competed {{all-around}} in the team qualifying round and on bars and beam in the finals. Liukin's score for her bars routine in team finals was a 16.375, the highest score of the day and, in the end, the entire World Championships. However, {{at the end of her}} beam routine, her foot slipped while she was setting up her <b>dismount,</b> prompting her to change her usual skill, a two and a half twisting salto, to a simple back tuck. While she lost credit for her <b>dismount,</b> she also avoided a deduction for a fall, and earned a 15.175. The team recovered from this and other mistakes to finish first overall with 184.400, nearly a point ahead of the silver-medal Chinese.|$|E
2500|$|On 1 October 1916, 1/1st Scottish Horse and 1/2nd Scottish Horse of the 1st <b>Dismounted</b> Brigade were amalgamated to form 13th (Scottish Horse Yeomanry) Battalion, Black Watch. [...] As the 1st <b>Dismounted</b> Brigade had {{now been}} reduced to just two regiments (1/1st Ayrshire Yeomanry and 1/1st Lanarkshire Yeomanry), it was {{dissolved}} and the remaining elements absorbed into the 2nd <b>Dismounted</b> Brigade.|$|R
50|$|The Lowland Mounted Brigade was {{transferred}} to Egypt, arriving on 7 February 1916 and was immediately absorbed into the 1st <b>Dismounted</b> Brigade (along with the Scottish Horse Mounted Brigade). In October 1916, {{the remnants of the}} 1st <b>Dismounted</b> Brigade (Ayrshire Yeomanry and Lanarkshire Yeomanry) were absorbed into 2nd <b>Dismounted</b> Brigade which was later renamed as 229th Brigade in the 74th (Yeomanry) Division.|$|R

5|$|In {{an address}} to the troops after the battle, Chetwode {{expressed}} his appreciation for the mounted rifle and light horse method of attack. He said that in the history of warfare he had never known cavalry to not only locate and surround the opponent's position, but to <b>dismount</b> and fight as infantry with rifle and bayonet.|$|E
5|$|Johnson left Washington, D.C. {{just before}} Congress adjourned. He raised one {{thousand}} men, nominally {{part of the}} militia brigade under Kentucky Governor Isaac Shelby, but largely operating independently. He disciplined his men, required that every man have arms in prime condition and ready to hand, and hired gunsmiths, blacksmiths, and doctors at his own expense. He devised a new tactical system: when any group of men encountered the enemy, they were to <b>dismount,</b> take cover, and hold the enemy in place. All groups not in contact were to ride {{to the sound of}} firing, and <b>dismount,</b> surrounding the enemy when they got there. Between May and September, Johnson raided throughout the Northwest, burning the war supply centers of Indian villages, surrounding Indian fighting units and scattering them, killing some Indian warriors each time.|$|E
5|$|Liukin {{performed}} all-around in the qualifying {{round of}} competition. She fell on her <b>dismount</b> from the uneven bars, but nevertheless qualified to the all-around final {{with a score}} of 63.325, which ranked her just behind Shawn Johnson, her friend and Olympic roommate. Liukin also qualified to three event finals: beam, uneven bars (in spite of the fall) and floor exercise.|$|E
50|$|In October 1916, the {{remnants}} of the 1st <b>Dismounted</b> Brigade (Ayrshire Yeomanry and Lanarkshire Yeomanry) were absorbed into 2nd <b>Dismounted</b> Brigade which was later renamed as 229th Brigade in the 74th (Yeomanry) Division.|$|R

5|$|Battles are turn-based {{and take}} place on grid-based maps. Victory is {{achieved}} when an enemy base is captured or all enemies are defeated. Each character holds four weapons and four items, and each has an assigned character class, which affects their movement range, damage and what weapons can be used. Mounted units also {{have the option to}} <b>dismount,</b> which changes their abilities and stats while reducing movement range.|$|E
5|$|Commenting on the gameplay, Famitsu {{noted that}} it was rather simple, but {{approved}} of the inclusion of Casual Mode and praised the content of each chapter for being just the right size. Moehnke praised the alterations made from the original version, such as not needing to <b>dismount</b> steeds when indoors, but also noted that some elements such as mechanics surrounding Marth showed the game's age. Nishioka generally enjoyed the gameplay experience, praising the inclusion of user-friendly options, but felt that these same new additions would divide fans.|$|E
5000|$|The Legged Squad Support System was to [...] "Go where <b>dismounts</b> go, do what <b>dismounts</b> do, {{work among}} dismounts," [...] carry 400 lb of squad equipment, sense and {{negotiate}} terrain, maneuver nimbly, and operate quietly when required.|$|R
50|$|The main {{version of}} the ASCOD is the tracked {{infantry}} fighting vehicle. It follows a conventional layout with front-mounted engine and rear compartment for the <b>dismounts.</b> The driver's seat {{is located at the}} left hull front, whereas the commander and gunner are sitting in the slightly off-center-mounted two-men turret. The rear compartment also has two hatches at the roof. The Ulan can carry a total of 8 <b>dismounts,</b> whereas the Pizarro only carries 7 <b>dismounts.</b>|$|R

5|$|Liukin's {{struggles with}} the balance beam {{continued}} in the all-around final, where she fell from the apparatus during her flight series. In spite of a 16.100 on bars, the highest score of the day from any competitor on any event, she finished the competition in fifth place. In the event finals, however, Liukin rallied and regained her world champion title on the balance beam with a score of 16.025. She also earned a silver on the uneven bars behind Russia's Ksenia Semenova, scoring a 16.300 after taking a step on her <b>dismount.</b>|$|E
5|$|Underground {{is built}} upon the skateboarding formula of {{previous}} Tony Hawk's games: the player explores levels and completes goals while performing tricks. The game features a new focus on customization; the player, instead of selecting a professional skater, creates a custom character. Underground adds {{the ability for}} players to <b>dismount</b> their boards and explore on foot. The plot follows the player character {{and his or her}} friend Eric Sparrow as the two become well-known professionals and grow apart.|$|E
5|$|Upon its establishment, the {{regiment}} comprised twenty-six officers and 523 other ranks, who were mounted on 528 riding horses, seventy-four draught horses and six pack horses. Each squadron of 158 men {{had a field}} headquarters and four troops. Although {{the regiment}} used horses, they were not cavalry but mounted infantry, and were expected to ride to the battlefield, <b>dismount</b> and fight as traditional infantry. The regiment {{was assigned to the}} New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade, serving alongside two other mounted infantry regimentsthe Wellington Mounted Rifles and the Canterbury Mounted Rifles.|$|E
50|$|The Eastern Mounted Brigade was a {{formation}} of the Territorial Force of the British Army, organised in 1908. After serving <b>dismounted</b> in the Gallipoli Campaign, it was absorbed into the 3rd <b>Dismounted</b> Brigade in Egypt in February 1916.|$|R

5000|$|In February 1916, {{the brigade}} landed in Egypt and on 22 February was {{absorbed into the}} 3rd <b>Dismounted</b> Brigade (along with the Eastern Mounted Brigade). [...] 3rd <b>Dismounted</b> Brigade was later renamed as 230th Brigade in the 74th (Yeomanry) Division.|$|R
5|$|As {{soon as the}} two armies {{were drawn}} up, a clamour arose from the German ranks, loudly {{demanding}} that Chnodomar and his entourage of chiefs should <b>dismount</b> and lead {{the main body of}} German foot warriors from the front. Chnodomar and the chiefs immediately complied. In so doing, Chnodomar forfeited any strategic control of the battle, as, trapped in the centre of the action, he would {{have no way of knowing}} what was happening in other sectors. Julian, on the other hand, maintained a detached position throughout (with his escort) and so was able to respond to events all over the field, such as the initial rout of his cavalry. It is unclear exactly where Julian was stationed but it was likely in the gap between the two Roman lines.|$|E
5|$|Each unit is {{assigned}} a character class, while affects their assigned weapon, strengths and weaknesses, and range {{and speed of}} movement on the battlefield. These classes range from axemen and swordsmen to thieves, to mounted units and magic users such as healers. Some characters, such as main protagonist Leif, have unique classes. Classes also naturally evolve {{during the course of}} the story. Mounted units have the option of dismounting their steeds to fight on-foot. Weapons within a unit's selected character class can be freely swapped out for more powerful versions: when mounted units <b>dismount,</b> they swap spears for axes or swords. Weapon effectiveness is governed by the Weapons Triangle: swords are strong against axes, axes against spears, and spears against swords.|$|E
5|$|In {{the central}} sector, at Gaulier, the Germans began moving 3.7 cm Pak 36 light {{infantry}} field artillery across the Meuse {{to provide support}} to infantry across the river. By 01:00 on 14 May, a pontoon bridge had been erected over which Sdkz 222, SdKfz 232 and SdKfz 264 armoured cars began to <b>dismount</b> in the bridgeheads. French reports spoke of German tanks crossing the bridges. Such reports were in error, as the first Panzers only crossed at 07:20 on 14 May. Prior to this masses of lorries, armoured cars and other traffic had passed through but not tanks.|$|E
60|$|Reaching {{the rustic}} bridge, Nat <b>dismounted,</b> {{and with his}} valise still over his shoulder, walked towards the cabin. As he did this Dave and Roger came quite close and they, too, <b>dismounted,</b> keeping in the shelter of some trees near by.|$|R
50|$|Collision with a {{computer-controlled}} enemy {{results in}} one warlord being <b>dismounted,</b> {{depending on who}} had the altitudinal advantage. If the player is <b>dismounted,</b> he loses one of four lives. If the enemy is <b>dismounted,</b> the figure tumbles downwards as his mount flies away. This <b>dismounted</b> warlord may be attacked again for bonus points. If left unattented, the warlord eventually calls a new mount and re-enters the battle (coloured magenta instead of cyan.) Occasionally the Winged Warlord equivalent of Joust's pterodactyl will appear; the Evil Bird of War (which appears {{to be some kind}} of large duck.) Contact with this is lethal for the player; it must be avoided as it makes its way across the screen.|$|R
50|$|This gradual {{rise in the}} {{dominance}} of infantry led {{to the adoption of}} <b>dismounted</b> tactics. From the earliest times knights and mounted men-at-arms had frequently <b>dismounted</b> to handle enemies they could not overcome on horseback, such as in the Battle of the Dyle (891) and the Battle of Bremule (1119), but after the 1350s this trend became more marked with the <b>dismounted</b> men-at-arms fighting as super-heavy infantry with two-handed swords and poleaxes. In any case, warfare in the Middle Ages tended to be dominated by raids and sieges rather than pitched battles, and mounted men-at-arms rarely had any choice other than <b>dismounting</b> when {{faced with the prospect of}} assaulting a fortified position.|$|R
5|$|Liukin's {{first meet}} of the 2008 season was the American Cup in New York City, where she {{defeated}} 2007 winner Shawn Johnson to regain her title. She posted the highest {{score of the}} meet, a 16.600 on the uneven bars. In March, Nastia competed at the Pacific Rim (formerly Pacific Alliance) Championships in San Jose, where she led the American team to a gold medal and won the all-around and balance beam titles. In the team competition, Liukin posted an all-time high score of 16.650 on the uneven bars, but in event finals, she fell on her Gienger release move {{and took a step}} on her <b>dismount,</b> earning a 15.225 and taking second place.|$|E
5|$|Liukin's {{gymnastics}} career {{came to an}} end {{after the}} 2012 Olympic Trials. On the final night of competition, she fell off the bars on her Gienger release, but got back up to finish her routine and landed her first competitive <b>dismount</b> since her comeback. After falling, she was helped up by her coach (her father) to continue her routine. Her bars routine received a 13.950. After she finished her beam routine, which scored a 14.950, she received a standing ovation from the 18,000 fans in the HP Pavilion in San Jose. Despite the end of her gymnastics career, Liukin went to London as the athlete representative for the International Gymnastics Federation (FIG).|$|E
5|$|Near {{the top of}} the inrun, {{there is}} a 'start gate' – a metal or wooden beam – on which an athlete sits and awaits their signal to jump via a set of traffic lights (green, amber, and red). These lights are {{operated}} directly by Borek Sedlák. An athlete may enter the gate when amber is shown. If red is shown after this point, the wind conditions will have been deemed unfavourable for a safe jump: the athlete must then carefully exit the gate as they had entered it and await another opportunity to jump. Failure to <b>dismount</b> the gate within ten to fifteen seconds of being shown a red light, or jumping without having been given the signal to go, will disqualify the athlete.|$|E

50|$|The {{origins of}} mounted {{infantry}} {{go back to}} at least the beginnings of organised warfare. With the weight of ancient bronze armour national champions would travel to battle on chariots before <b>dismounting</b> to fight. With the evolution of hoplite warfare, some hoplites would travel to battle on horseback, before again <b>dismounting</b> {{to take their place}} in the phalanx. Early pre-Marian Roman military had units consisting of mounted infantry with units clinging to the saddles of the cavalry to take them to battle and then <b>dismounting</b> to fight. Gallic and Germanic warbands were reported to use double-riders, with a second warrior joining a horseman only for a short distance before <b>dismounting</b> to fight on foot.The Han Dynasty also extensively used mounted infantry in their campaigns against the Xiongnu confederation. During many of the Han campaigns, {{the vast majority of the}} army rode on horseback;either as mounted cavalry or mounted infantry who fought <b>dismounted.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Stryker's thermal sights can see out to 7,800 ft, {{compared}} to 330 ft for night vision sights used by <b>dismounted</b> soldiers. This capability allows {{the vehicle to}} warn <b>dismounted</b> soldiers of threats which lie beyond the range of their night vision sights.|$|R
