25|$|Ulyses Petit de Murat {{was born}} in Buenos Aires on January 28, 1907 and was {{interested}} in literature and journalism from a young age. He {{was in charge of}} the music page in the daily magazine Crítica and, with Jorge Luis Borges, co-directed its literary supplement. In 1932 he moved to the motion <b>film</b> <b>section</b> of Crítica and in 1939 wrote his first cinematographic script for the movie Prisioneros de la Tierra, an adaptation of four tales of Horacio Quiroga, made with his son, Dario Quiroga, who later in 1940 wrote Con el Dedo en el Gatillo, with the collaboration of Homero Manzi.|$|E
25|$|In November 1990, Hiroki {{directed}} a romance about modern young couples in Japan, A Love Affair With Sawako for the Shochiku company. This {{was followed by}} the erotic horror V-cinema production Sadistic City which took the Japanese <b>Film</b> <b>Section</b> Grand Prize for a video at the Yubari International Fantastic Film Festival. Hiroki's breakthrough into mainstream film, however, came with his 1994 feature 800 Two Lap Runners which looked at teenage heterosexual and homosexual relationships against a track and field background. The film opened at the Berlin International Film Festival in February 1994 before being released in Japan in July 1994. It placed number 7 on the Kinema Junpo's list of the ten best Japanese movies of 1994.|$|E

2500|$|As a child, Cosmatos frequented a {{video store}} named Video Addict. During these trips he would browse the horror <b>film</b> <b>section</b> {{looking at the}} boxes {{although}} he {{was not allowed to}} watch such films. During such times he would instead imagine what the film was. He would later reflect upon this experience when making Black Rainbow where one of his goals was [...] "to create a film that is a sort of imagining of an old film that doesn’t exist." [...] The year 1983 was chosen for the story as it's the first year he went to Video Addict. Additionally he thought the idea of setting such a film one year before 1984 was funny. The film's genesis was an overlap between two projects Cosmatos wanted to do. One of these was a film about a girl trapped in an asylum while the other was an installation promoting a research facility that didn't exist. Eventually Cosmatos realized that he could use both ideas in the same project.|$|E
2500|$|The {{project was}} {{revealed}} by Hayes in a PR launch in Detroit {{at the end}} of 1965, but the engine was not ready until the third race of the 1967 season, on the 4 June at Zandvoort. [...] Its debut proved electric. Graham Hill, who was in the team at the specific request of Ford and Hayes, put his DFV-powered Lotus 49 on pole position by half a second and led for the first 10 laps but was then sidelined by a broken gear in the camshaft drive. Team-mate Jim Clark moved up through the field in his identical car and came home to win. However, this dominant performance belied a serious fault in the timing gear. Clark took three more wins that season, but reliability problems left him third in the Drivers' Championship, 10 points behind Champion Denny Hulme. The progress of the engine was documented in a film produced by the Ford Motor Company's <b>film</b> <b>section,</b> entitled [...] "9 Days in Summer".|$|E
