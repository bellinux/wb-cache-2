5|$|The US Navy Heliox {{saturation}} decompression rates {{require a}} partial pressure of oxygen {{to be maintained}} at between 0.44 and 0.48 atm when possible, but not to exceed 23% by volume, to restrict the risk of fire. For practicality the decompression is done in increments of 1fsw at a rate not exceeding 1fsw per minute, followed by a stop, with the average complying with the table ascent rate. Decompression is done for 16 hours in 24, with the remaining 8 hours split into two rest periods. A further adaptation generally made to the schedule is to stop at 4fsw for the time that is would theoretically take to complete the decompression at the specified rate, i.e. 80 minutes, and then complete the decompression to surface at 1fsw per minute. This is done to avoid the possibility of losing the <b>door</b> <b>seal</b> at a low pressure differential and losing the last hour or so of slow decompression.|$|E

2500|$|The V20 Camry {{originated}} {{from a time}} at Toyota when considerable cost and attention to detail was engineered into its cars such as high-quality materials and build quality to transcend the competition. Sedans retained the V10's rear quarter glass; however, the styling is less angular than before. To appease export customers, styling {{lost some of its}} Japanese legacy in its transition to a more Americanized design, with a softer and sleeker silhouette. Toyota designed the body with aerodynamics in mind, with performance of [...] for the sedan. V20 also features headlamps and a grille that are sculptured into a gently curved hood that partially conceal the windscreen wipers, wind splitters up the ends of the windscreen, near-flush glass, and a third <b>door</b> <b>seal</b> to close the gap between the body and window frames. Body dimensions were largely unchanged from the previous model, including an identical wheelbase, although length increases [...] Basic sub-skin hardware is also closely related, including the platform and the fully independent suspension with a strut and a coil spring at each corner and an anti-roll bar at each end. Noise isolation is improved by mounting the rear suspension on a subframe akin to the Toyota Celica (T160) that had now switched to Camry-based mechanicals. As before, the braking package encompasses ventilated discs up front, conventional drums in the rear, upgraded to rear discs in some cars. The braking system has a tandem-type booster and diagonally divided hydraulic circuits. Wagons receive a load-sensing proportioning valve that grants greater braking pressure when laden and prevents wheel lockup under light payloads. Entry-level V20 wheel size increases from 13 to 14inches.|$|E

50|$|Woven ceramic fabrics {{allow for}} the {{opportunity}} to create new, imaginative solutions for previously impossible problems. These fabrics are utilized for thermal, mechanical and electrical applications for a variety of reasons. Ceramic-impregnated fabrics are most importantly used in three main fields: aerospace, electronic, and industrial. In aerospace, the fabrics are used in space shuttles for the exit cone, <b>door</b> <b>seals,</b> micrometeorite shield, gaskets, booster access doors, shuttle tiles, and in the Whipple shield. Ceramic-impregnated fabrics are utilized in aerospace because they have low thermal conductivity and can be fabricated into high temperature thermal insulators. In the electronic industry, the fabrics are used primarily for insulation and seals, because of its low porosity. Ceramic fabric's industrial uses include furnace linings, furnace zone dividers, <b>door</b> <b>seals,</b> tube seals, gaskets, and expansion joints. In addition to being an effective thermal insulator, these fabrics do not shrink or elongate with high temperature changes, making them useful for industrial uses that involve high temperatures.|$|R

50|$|This type is {{intrinsically}} safe, since opening the cam-locks under pressure releases the <b>door</b> <b>seal</b> and depressurizes the vessel.

Even when opened, the cam-lock does not allow the bolt to disengage from the latching lug {{if there is any}} pressure against the door. Since it is mounted at a small angle to the lug, the bolt cannot be swung outward away from the engaging lug on the door if there is any pull on it.|$|E

40|$|Due to the {{increasing}} concern with the acoustic environment within automotive vehicles, there is an interest in measuring the acoustical properties of automotive <b>door</b> <b>seals.</b> These systems {{play an important role}} in blocking external noise sources, such as aerodynamic noise and tire noise, from entering the passenger compartment. Thus, it is important to be able to conveniently measure their acoustic performance. Previous methods of measuring the ability of seals to block sound required the use of either a reverberation chamber, or a wind tunnel with a special purpose chamber attached to it. That is, these methods required the use of large and expensive facilities. A simpler and more economical desktop procedure is thus needed to allow easy and fast acoustic measurement of automotive <b>door</b> <b>seals.</b> In the present work, a desktop, four-microphone, square cross-section standing wave tube was modified by the addition of a new sample holder to make it possible to measure the transmission loss of <b>door</b> <b>seals</b> under various states of compression. In this new procedure, the sample is clamped between a sliding piston and one wall of the standing wave tube. Since the clamp partially blocks the channel, thus impacting the measured transmission loss, a correction is necessary to determine the transmission loss of the seal by itself. Therefore, an initial set of measurements was performed to identify the correction factor required to adjust the measured transmission loss of the clamp plus seal to eliminate the contribution of the clamp itself. Once the accuracy of the correction procedure was verified, a number of typical <b>door</b> <b>seals</b> were tested at various degrees of compression. The transmission losses of the seals were generally in excess of 30 dB, and the transmission loss was found to increase significantly as the seals were compressed. The latter point, in particular, indicates that careful design of the seal mounting arrangements in the vehicle is crucial to ensuring their optimal performance...|$|R
