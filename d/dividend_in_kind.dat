40|$|This paper {{examines}} <b>dividend</b> changes <b>in</b> {{an emerging}} market: Thailand. We begin {{by considering the}} possible effects of the Thai corporate environment on dividend policy. We develop a theoretical model that considers {{the relationship between the}} strength of investor power and <b>dividends</b> <b>in</b> an agency cost/free cashflow framework. This allows us to consider the conditions for the outcome (positive relationship) or substitute (negative relationship) models, as discussed by La Porta et al. (2000). Our model also allows us to consider the expropriation hypothesis, in which the presence of large controlling shareholders may actually reduce outside investor power, leading to lower dividends. We then turn to our empirical analysis. Employing a large sample of companies that changed <b>dividends</b> <b>in</b> Thailand during the period 1996 – 2009, we test for the signaling, free cashflow and life-cycle hypotheses. A further contribution of our analysis is that we consider the impact of investor power and ownership on <b>dividends</b> <b>in</b> Thailand. Overall, we find little support for the signaling hypothesis, but we find considerable support for the free cashflow and life-cycle hypotheses. Our analysis of ownership variables suggests that increasing investor power (for example, high ownership concentration together with the presence of domestic institutional ownership) results <b>in</b> higher <b>dividends,</b> <b>in</b> support of the outcome model, rather than the substitution or expropriation models...|$|R

30|$|In {{addition}} to considering {{the implications of}} developments within each megatrends category {{for the future of}} work, new threats and opportunities can be anticipated by combining megatrend categories - e.g., People and Productivity. This enables, in turn, different global perspectives concerning the shift in the future of work to be discovered and considered and avoids the trap of imposing a “one size fits all” global blueprint. For example, emerging economies are rethinking demographic <b>dividends</b> <b>in</b> the context of digital divides, and advanced industrialised economies are grappling with the digital <b>dividend</b> <b>in</b> the context of rapidly ageing societies.|$|R
