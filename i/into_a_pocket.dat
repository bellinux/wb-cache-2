5|$|The 10th SS Panzer Division {{launched}} its attack behind schedule at 1430. Following clashes {{earlier in the}} day the British were waiting but after five hours of battle, the Scottish infantry defending Gavrus had been pushed back <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>pocket</b> around the bridge, north of the village. An artillery bombardment caused the Germans to withdraw but the British did not reoccupy the village. Moving towards Hill 113, the 2nd Grenadier Battalion, Panzergrenadier Regiment 21 and 2nd Battalion, Panzer Regiment 10 of 10th SS Panzer ran into the 44th Battalion The Royal Tank Regiment and 2nd Battalion (The King's Royal Rifle Corps) in Évrecy, who thwarted their attempt to occupy the hill. Dealing with this obstacle took the remainder of the day and the attack on Hill 112 was postponed. The Germans claimed the destruction of 28 tanks while the British recorded the loss of 12.|$|E

After shattering the Axis defence on the Mareth Line, the Allies squeezed Axis forces <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>pocket</b> around Tunis.

Jon isn't erased from history, and his actions outside of the pocket universe are well remembered, but he is truly gone, leaving Kon-El once again as Superboy.

25|$|By 27 April the Soviet Armies had {{penetrated}} the German's S-Bahn outer defensive ring from all directions.

Perkohorovitch's 47th Army was now approaching Spandau, and was also heavily involved in a battle to capture Gatow airfield, which was defended by Volkssturm and Luftwaffe cadets using the feared 88mm anti-aircraft guns in their anti-tank role. In the north, Colonel-General Semyon Bogdanov's 2nd Guards Tank Army was bogged down just south of Siemensstadt. Colonel-General Vasily Kuznetsov's 3rd Shock Army had bypassed the Humboldthain flak tower (leaving it to follow-up forces), and had reached the north of the Tiergarten and Prenzlauerberg.|$|E

Illegal shots which are not fouls unless a ball is pocketed on the same stroke (thus resulting {{in a loss of}} turn, no score, but not a loss of points), include: causing an [...] to touch the bottle at all before the cue ball touches it (without knocking it over); and causing the bottle to go <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>pocket</b> or off the table as a result of action by the cue ball, after it has caromed off an object ball.|$|E

Through Obito's left eye, Kakashi can create a long-ranged portal that is primarily based on line-of-sight and can increase in size. As a result, Obito and Kakashi are unable to use Kamui against each other as the attacks cancel each other. Once Obito regained his left eye, his abilities increase {{to the point where}} he can use his eyes to create two distortions and then connect them to produce a wormhole from one location to another. However, as this ability has nothing to do with his pocket dimension, it places a significant strain on Obito.|$|E
500|$|During the afternoon, the German LXXXIV Corps ordered its reserve, Kampfgruppe Meyer, {{to strike}} into the {{flank of the}} 50th Division north of Bayeux.

On 7 June, {{the bulk of the}} 7th Armoured Division landed on schedule and XXX Corps secured its remaining D-Day objectives, including Bayeux and Port-en-Bessin-Huppain. The LXXXIV Corps sent its last reserve unit, Mobile Brigade 30, towards Gold Beach to repeat the counter-attack, which also failed and the brigade was destroyed north of Bayeux. The survivors of the two counter-attacks were driven <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>pocket</b> north of the city by the Anglo-American advance, although the Americans did not discover that this had happened. From Sword Beach, the 3rd Infantry Division of I Corps had advanced towards Caen but diverted units to capture German positions along the [...] route, which reduced the strength of the infantry attack and the accompanying 27th Armoured Brigade was delayed by congestion in the beachhead.
