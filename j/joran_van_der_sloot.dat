5|$|On 5 July 2011, St. Martin's Press {{published}} Portrait of a Monster: <b>Joran</b> <b>van</b> <b>der</b> <b>Sloot,</b> a Murder in Peru, and the Natalee Holloway Mystery by Lisa Pulitzer and Cole Thompson.|$|E
5|$|In December 2006, the Kalpoes filed a slander and {{libel suit}} against Skeeters (who died in January 2007) and Dr. Phil. in Los Angeles. Holloway's parents responded by filing a {{wrongful}} death {{lawsuit against the}} Kalpoes in the same venue. The wrongful death suit was dismissed for lack of personal jurisdiction on June 1, 2007; the libel and slander case was initially set for trial on October 12, 2011 but was later set for April 2015. An earlier suit had been filed in New York City by the parents against Paulus and <b>Joran</b> <b>van</b> <b>der</b> <b>Sloot</b> and served on them {{on a visit to}} New York. The case had been dismissed in August 2006 as filed in an inconvenient forum.|$|E
5|$|<b>Joran</b> <b>van</b> <b>der</b> <b>Sloot</b> {{was born}} in Arnhem, Netherlands. He {{is one of three}} sons born to Paulus van der Sloot (1952–2010), a lawyer, and Anita van der Sloot-Hugen, an art teacher. In 1990, his family moved from Arnhem to Aruba, where he was an honor student at the International School of Aruba. He was {{considered}} a star soccer and tennis athlete at the school. Van der Sloot competed in doubles tennis with his father at the Moët et Chandon Anniversary Cup in 2005 and hoped to play for Saint Leo University near Tampa, Florida. Van der Sloot's mother said he had a problem with lying and had a tendency to sneak out of the house at night to go to casinos.|$|E

50|$|In August 2005, while {{covering}} the Natalee Holloway disappearance in Aruba, NBC arranged {{an interview with}} the director of Aruban prisons and a tour of suspect <b>Joran</b> <b>van</b> <b>der</b> <b>Sloot's</b> prison. During the tour, she ran into <b>van</b> <b>der</b> <b>Sloot</b> and conducted an off-camera interview. Prison director Fred Maduro appeared live on MSNBC and admitted that he offered her the tour. After <b>Van</b> <b>der</b> <b>Sloot's</b> attorneys called for a hearing on the matter, NBC declined to air the footage.|$|R
50|$|Holloway's family, however, {{took the}} {{opposite}} approach and criticized the lessening of {{coverage of the}} young woman's disappearance due to a shift in news priority when Hurricane Katrina struck on August 23, 2005. The saturation coverage of Holloway's disappearance was finally eclipsed by the hurricane. Beth Twitty and Dave Holloway alleged that Aruba {{took advantage of the}} extensive coverage of the hurricane to release the suspects, however the deadline for judicial review of <b>Joran</b> <b>van</b> <b>der</b> <b>Sloot's</b> detention was set long before the hurricane.|$|R
5|$|Holloway was {{scheduled}} to fly home from Aruba on May 30, 2005, but she failed to appear for her flight. She was last seen by her classmates outside of Carlos'n Charlie's, a restaurant and nightclub in Oranjestad. She {{was in a car}} with local residents <b>Joran</b> <b>van</b> <b>der</b> <b>Sloot</b> and the Kalpoe brothers, Deepak and Satish. When the three men were questioned, they said that they dropped off Holloway at her hotel and denied knowing what had become of her. Upon further investigation by authorities, Van der Sloot was arrested twice on suspicion of involvement in her disappearance and the Kalpoes were each arrested three times. Due to lack of evidence, the three suspects were released each time without being charged with a crime. Holloway's parents have criticized Aruban police for the lack of progress in the investigation and interrogation of the three men who were last seen with their daughter. The family also called for a boycott of Aruba, which gained Alabama Governor Bob Riley's support but failed to gain widespread backing.|$|E
25|$|On February 16, 2006, <b>Joran</b> <b>van</b> <b>der</b> <b>Sloot</b> and {{his father}} Paul were in New York City for an {{interview}} with ABC Primetime when they were served with a lawsuit filed by Twitty and her former husband David Holloway. The lawsuit alleged personal injury against Natalee Holloway and also alleged that Van der Sloot's father created a permissive environment. However, the case was dismissed on jurisdictional grounds on August 3, 2006.|$|E
25|$|Around March 29, 2010, <b>Joran</b> <b>van</b> <b>der</b> <b>Sloot</b> {{contacted}} Twitty's attorney John Q. Kelly with {{an offer}} to reveal the location of her daughter's body and the circumstances surrounding her death for an advance of US$25,000 against a total of $250,000. Kelly said that he secretly went to Aruba in April to meet with Van der Sloot, who was desperate for money, and gave him $100. Kelly notified the Federal Bureau of Investigation {{to set up a}} sting operation with the Aruban authorities. On May 10, Van der Sloot accepted the amount of $15,000 by wire transfer from Birmingham to his account in the Netherlands, following a cash payment of $10,000 that was videotaped by undercover investigators in Aruba. In exchange, Van der Sloot told Kelly that his father buried Natalee's remains in the foundation of a house. Authorities determined that the information that he in return provided was false, because the house had not yet been built at the time of Natalee's disappearance. Van der Sloot later e-mailed Kelly that he lied about the house. Holloway was shocked that the FBI did not promptly file extortion charges against Van der Sloot, allowing him to leave freely with the money to Bogotá, Colombia, on his way to Lima, Peru. The FBI and the Office of the U.S. Attorney in Birmingham later claimed in a joint statement that they were working as quickly as possible and that the Lima murder was in no way the result of them allowing Van der Sloot to flee Aruba with the extorted money.|$|E
500|$|<b>Joran</b> Andreas Petrus <b>van</b> <b>der</b> <b>Sloot</b> ( [...] ; born 6 August 1987) is a Dutch {{convicted murderer}} who killed Stephany Flores Ramírez in Lima, Peru in 2010. He {{is also the}} prime suspect in the 2005 {{disappearance}} of Natalee Holloway in Aruba.|$|R
5|$|In August 2014, <b>Van</b> <b>der</b> <b>Sloot</b> was {{transferred}} to Challapalca prison in the mountainous South of Peru, where circumstances are harsh due to the location's altitude. Two months later, a Dutch online news service claimed that <b>Van</b> <b>der</b> <b>Sloot</b> was stabbed and critically injured by fellow prisoners in Peru. Although <b>Van</b> <b>der</b> <b>Sloot's</b> wife's claim of a stabbing is contested by Peruvian authorities, photos have been published showing <b>Van</b> <b>der</b> <b>Sloot</b> as suffering from multiple stab wounds from two separate attacks.|$|R
5|$|The broadcast, {{aired on}} February 3, 2008, {{included}} excerpts from footage recorded from hidden cameras and microphones {{in the vehicle}} of Patrick <b>van</b> <b>der</b> Eem, a Dutch businessman and ex-convict who gained <b>Van</b> <b>der</b> <b>Sloot's</b> confidence. <b>Van</b> <b>der</b> <b>Sloot</b> was seen smoking marijuana and stating that he was with Holloway when she began convulsively shaking, then became unresponsive. <b>Van</b> <b>der</b> <b>Sloot</b> stated that he attempted to revive her, without success. He said that he called a friend, who told <b>Van</b> <b>der</b> <b>Sloot</b> {{to go home and}} who disposed of the body. An individual reputed to be this friend, identified in the broadcast as Daury, has denied <b>Van</b> <b>der</b> <b>Sloot's</b> account, indicating that he was then in Rotterdam at school.|$|R
500|$|On November 24, 2008, Fox News aired an {{interview}} with Van der Sloot in which he alleged that he sold Holloway into sexual slavery, receiving money both when Holloway was taken, and later on to keep quiet. Van der Sloot also alleged that his father paid off two police officers who had learned that Holloway was taken to Venezuela. Van der Sloot later retracted the statements made in the interview. The show also aired part of an audio recording provided by Van der Sloot, which he alleged is a phone conversation {{between him and his}} father, in which the father displays knowledge of his son's purported involvement in human trafficking. According to Mos, this voice heard on the recording is not that of Paulus van der Sloot—the Dutch newspaper De Telegraaf reports that the [...] "father's" [...] voice is almost certainly that of <b>Joran</b> <b>van</b> <b>der</b> <b>Sloot</b> himself, trying to speak in a lower tone. Paulus van der Sloot {{died of a heart attack}} on February 10, 2010.|$|E
2500|$|Twitty {{was criticized}} for her focus on <b>Joran</b> <b>van</b> <b>der</b> <b>Sloot</b> and the Kalpoe brothers, to the {{exclusion}} of any other theory as to what happened to Natalee. According to the lawsuit filed by the Kalpoe brothers, she has (on various television programs) repeatedly accused them and van der Sloot of [...] "sexual assault" [...] and [...] "gang rape" [...] of her daughter.|$|E
2500|$|In May 2005, Twitty's {{daughter}} Natalee was in Aruba on {{a graduation}} trip with fellow students from Mountain Brook High School. Natalee {{was scheduled to}} fly home on May 30, but failed to appear for her flight. [...] She was last seen by her classmates outside Carlos'n Charlie's, a Caribbean restaurant and nightclub in Oranjestad, {{in a car with}} locals <b>Joran</b> <b>van</b> <b>der</b> <b>Sloot</b> and brothers Deepak and Satish Kalpoe.|$|E
50|$|On February 8, 2008, <b>Van</b> <b>der</b> <b>Sloot</b> {{met with}} Aruban {{investigators}} in the Netherlands. <b>Van</b> <b>der</b> <b>Sloot</b> denied {{that what he}} said on the tape was true, stating that he was {{under the influence of}} marijuana at the time. <b>Van</b> <b>der</b> <b>Sloot</b> indicated that he still maintains that he left Holloway behind on the beach.|$|R
5|$|Peruvian {{officials}} named <b>Van</b> <b>der</b> <b>Sloot</b> as {{the lone}} {{suspect in the}} homicide investigation. Interpol issued an international arrest warrant for <b>Van</b> <b>der</b> <b>Sloot,</b> believing that he had fled the country to Chile, possibly intending to return to Aruba through Argentina. <b>Van</b> <b>der</b> <b>Sloot</b> was sighted entering Chile via the Chacalluta border crossing, north of Arica, on 31 May 2010. His ex-girlfriend, Melody Granadillo, said that <b>Van</b> <b>der</b> <b>Sloot</b> sent her a text message asking for {{money to buy a}} ticket back to Aruba.|$|R
50|$|The {{broadcast}} aired February 3, 2008. The broadcast included {{excerpts from}} footage recorded from hidden cameras and microphones {{in the vehicle}} of Patrick <b>van</b> <b>der</b> Eem, a Dutch businessman and ex-convict who gained <b>Van</b> <b>der</b> <b>Sloot's</b> confidence. <b>Van</b> <b>der</b> <b>Sloot</b> was seen smoking marijuana and stating that he was with Holloway when she began convulsively shaking, then became unresponsive. <b>Van</b> <b>der</b> <b>Sloot</b> stated that he attempted to revive her, without success. He said that he called a friend, who told <b>Van</b> <b>der</b> <b>Sloot</b> {{to go home and}} who disposed of the body. An individual reputed to be this friend, identified in the broadcast as Daury, has denied <b>Van</b> <b>der</b> <b>Sloot's</b> account, indicating that he was then in Rotterdam at school.|$|R
2500|$|Twitty also {{alleged that}} the person who van der Sloot {{supposedly}} called that evening was his father Paul, who according to Holloway [...] "orchestrated what to do next". She and Dave Holloway alleged that <b>Joran</b> <b>van</b> <b>der</b> <b>Sloot</b> was receiving [...] "special legal favors". After the court decision not to rearrest Van der Sloot was affirmed, Twitty stated, [...] "I think that what I do take comfort in, his life is a living hell", later adding, [...] "I'd be good with a Midnight Express prison anywhere for Joran." ...|$|E
2500|$|Twitty {{was also}} criticized for making what have been {{deemed to be}} {{inconsistent}} and contradictory statements (for example, as to whether there were operating security cameras at the Holiday Inn). [...] According to Julia Renfro, U.S.-born editor of the Aruban tourist-oriented newspaper, Aruba Today, who befriended Holloway {{in the early days}} of the investigation, Holloway pandered to tabloid television and her [...] "behavior was odd from the get-go". Renfro noted that [...] "Holloway immediately concluded that her daughter had been kidnapped and made no effort to check hospitals or police", adding that within a couple of days, after fixing responsibility on <b>Joran</b> <b>van</b> <b>der</b> <b>Sloot,</b> Twitty [...] "was telling TV interviewers that she knew her daughter had been gang-raped and murdered".|$|E
2500|$|Beth Twitty alleged in {{televised}} {{interviews that}} <b>Joran</b> <b>van</b> <b>der</b> <b>Sloot</b> and the Kalpoe brothers {{knew more than}} they told, and {{that at least one}} of them sexually assaulted or raped her daughter. Holloway stated that she received copies of police statements stating that van der Sloot admitted having sex with Natalee at his home and described intimate details of her. She has never released copies of the alleged statement, though she characterizes them as admissions of [...] "sexual assault" [...] However, Vinda de Sousa, former Holloway/Twitty family attorney from Aruba understood that the admission may have been for consensual sex. In addition, former Aruban deputy police commissioner Gerold G. Dompig denied that any such statement was made, stating that Van der Sloot and the Kalpoe brothers consistently denied having sex with Natalee.|$|E
5|$|On 3 June 2010, the U.S. District Court of Northern Alabama charged <b>Van</b> <b>der</b> <b>Sloot</b> with {{extortion}} {{and wire}} fraud. U.S. Attorney Joyce White Vance issued {{an arrest warrant}} through Interpol to have <b>Van</b> <b>der</b> <b>Sloot</b> prosecuted in the United States. On 4 June, {{at the request of}} the U.S. Justice Department, Dutch authorities raided and confiscated items from two homes in the Netherlands, one of them belonging to reporter Jaap Amesz, who had previously interviewed <b>Van</b> <b>der</b> <b>Sloot</b> and claimed knowledge of his criminal activities. Aruban investigators used information gathered from the extortion case to launch a new search at a beach, but no new evidence was found. Aruba's Solicitor-General said they would not seek <b>Van</b> <b>der</b> <b>Sloot's</b> extradition to Aruba. On 30 June, a federal grand jury formally indicted <b>Van</b> <b>der</b> <b>Sloot</b> of the two charges. The indictment filed with the U.S. District Court seeks the forfeiture of the $25,100 that had been paid to <b>Van</b> <b>der</b> <b>Sloot.</b>|$|R
500|$|On May 30, 2010—five {{years to}} the day after Holloway's disappearance—Stephany Flores Ramírez, a 21-year-old {{business}} student, was reported missing in Lima, Peru. She was found dead three days later in a hotel room registered in <b>Van</b> <b>der</b> <b>Sloot's</b> name. On June 3, <b>Van</b> <b>der</b> <b>Sloot</b> was arrested in Chile on a murder charge and extradited to Peru the next day. On June 7, Peruvian authorities said that <b>Van</b> <b>der</b> <b>Sloot</b> confessed to killing Flores after he lost his temper because she accessed his laptop without permission and found information linking him to Holloway. Police chief César Guardia related that <b>Van</b> <b>der</b> <b>Sloot</b> told Peruvian police that he knew where Holloway's body was and offered to help Aruban authorities find it. However, Guardia stated that the interrogation was limited to their case in Peru, and that questions about Holloway's disappearance were avoided. On June 11, <b>Van</b> <b>der</b> <b>Sloot</b> was charged in Lima Superior Court with first-degree murder and robbery. On June 15, Aruban and Peruvian authorities announced an agreement to cooperate and allow investigators from Aruba to interview <b>Van</b> <b>der</b> <b>Sloot</b> at Miguel Castro Castro prison in Peru. In a September 2010 interview from the prison, <b>Van</b> <b>der</b> <b>Sloot</b> reportedly admitted to the extortion plot, stating: [...] "I wanted to get back at Natalee's family—her parents have been making my life tough for five years." [...] On January 11, 2012, <b>Van</b> <b>der</b> <b>Sloot</b> pleaded guilty to murdering Ramírez and was sentenced to 28 years in prison.|$|R
500|$|Aruban {{investigators}} cited {{what was}} described as newly discovered evidence, and <b>Van</b> <b>der</b> <b>Sloot</b> and the Kalpoe brothers were rearrested November 21, 2007, on suspicion of involvement in [...] "manslaughter and causing serious bodily harm {{that resulted in the}} death of Holloway." [...] <b>Van</b> <b>der</b> <b>Sloot</b> was detained by Dutch authorities in the Netherlands, while the Kalpoe brothers were detained in Aruba. <b>Van</b> <b>der</b> <b>Sloot</b> returned to Aruba and was incarcerated.|$|R
2500|$|On April 19, 2009, Lifetime aired Natalee Holloway, {{starring}} Tracy Pollan as Beth Holloway-Twitty, Grant Show as George [...] "Jug" [...] Twitty, Amy Gumenick as Natalee Holloway and Jacques Strydom as <b>Joran</b> <b>van</b> <b>der</b> <b>Sloot.</b> The film re-enacts Natalee's disappearance and stages re-creations {{of various}} scenarios, {{based on the}} testimony of key players and suspects. The broadcast of the film attracted 3.2 million viewers, garnering the highest television ratings in the network's history at the time. Although it set ratings records for Lifetime, the movie was not received well by critic Alec Harvey of The Birmingham News. Harvey called the movie [...] "sloppy and uneven, a forgettable look at the tragedy that consumed the nation's attention for months". However, Jake Meaney of PopMatters found the film to be surprisingly [...] "calm and levelheaded", and praised Tracy Pollan's portrayal of Beth. Twitty {{said that she was}} honored by Pollan's portrayal and that there [...] "could not have been a better choice." ...|$|E

5|$|In {{the months}} {{following}} his release, <b>Van</b> <b>der</b> <b>Sloot</b> gave several interviews that explained {{his version of}} events. The most notable discussion included a lengthy interview with Fox News that aired over three nights in March 2006. During the interview, <b>Van</b> <b>der</b> <b>Sloot</b> indicated that Holloway wanted {{to have sex with}} him, but he did not because he didn't have a condom. <b>Van</b> <b>der</b> <b>Sloot</b> stated that Holloway wanted them to stay on the beach, but that {{he had to go to}} school in the morning. According to <b>Van</b> <b>der</b> <b>Sloot,</b> he was picked up by Satish Kalpoe at about 3:00am and left Holloway sitting on the beach. In August 2005, David Kock, Satish Kalpoe's attorney, stated that his client had gone to sleep, and had not returned to drive <b>Van</b> <b>der</b> <b>Sloot</b> home. <b>Van</b> <b>der</b> <b>Sloot</b> stated that he was somewhat ashamed to have left a young woman alone on the beach, albeit by her own request, and related that he was not truthful at first because he was convinced that Holloway would soon turn up.|$|R

500|$|Patrick <b>van</b> <b>der</b> Eem, working {{undercover}} for De Vries, had befriended <b>Van</b> <b>der</b> <b>Sloot,</b> who {{was unaware}} {{that he was}} being taped when he said that Holloway had suffered some kind of seizure while having sex on the beach. After failing to revive her, <b>Van</b> <b>der</b> <b>Sloot</b> said that he summoned a friend named Daury. The two men neither phoned for medical help nor checked Natalee to determine if she might still be alive. [...] Then, according to <b>Van</b> <b>der</b> <b>Sloot,</b> Daury volunteered to load her on a boat, and he dumped Natalee's body into the sea. The prosecutor in Aruba determined the video was admissible, but the evidence was deemed [...] "insufficient" [...] to warrant <b>Van</b> <b>der</b> <b>Sloot's,</b> or anyone's, arrest. Although the taped confession appeared damning, <b>Van</b> <b>der</b> <b>Sloot</b> argued that he was lying to impress <b>Van</b> <b>der</b> Eem, who he believed was a drug dealer.|$|R

500|$|On 15 June, Aruban and Peruvian {{authorities}} {{announced that}} they would cooperate in their respective cases involving <b>Van</b> <b>der</b> <b>Sloot.</b> Aruban investigators expected {{to be able to}} interview <b>Van</b> <b>der</b> <b>Sloot</b> in Peru in August, after Peruvian authorities had completed their investigation. At his first formal hearing within the on-site courtroom of Miguel Castro Castro prison on 21 June, <b>Van</b> <b>der</b> <b>Sloot</b> refused to discuss the case with Judge Carlos Morales Cordova, claiming that his rights and due process were violated. <b>Van</b> <b>der</b> <b>Sloot</b> {{filed a complaint with the}} National Police of Peru, accusing chief detective Miguel Angel Canlla Ore of misconduct. He also claimed that his laptop had been improperly searched. <b>Van</b> <b>der</b> <b>Sloot's</b> defense counsel filed a motion of habeas corpus disputing the legality of his detention and to nullify statements he gave to police, but the motion was declared [...] "" [...] by Superior Court Judge Wilder Casique Alvizuri on 25 June.
