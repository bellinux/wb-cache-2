All land, <b>internal</b> <b>waters,</b> territorial seas and EEZs in the Arctic {{are under the}} jurisdiction of one of the five Arctic coastal states: Canada, Norway, Russia, Denmark (via Greenland), and the United States.

40|$|The present work {{examines}} {{the impact of}} internal curing on the compressive strength of high strength concrete. High strength concrete is used in more complex structures as it have very good mechanical properties. However, due to low water-binder ratio is more susceptible to shrinkage. Shrinkage of high strength concrete can limited or eliminated with internal curing – <b>internal</b> <b>water</b> reservoirs, but this may affect on {{the reduction of the}} compressive strength. In experimantal studies we were finding out if the introduction of <b>internal</b> <b>water</b> reservoirs in concrete mixture using lightweigth aggregate effect on reducing of compressive strength or compressive strength due to better cement hydration increases. We found out that the compressive strength of concrete using <b>internal</b> <b>water</b> reservoirs at the age of 28 days increased...|$|R

After the Russian Revolution of 1917, the Soviet Union was {{isolated from the}} western powers, which made it imperative to use this route.

The waters around, between, and connecting the islands of the archipelago, regardless of their breadth and dimensions, form part of the <b>internal</b> <b>waters</b> of the Philippines.|$|E
25|$|Management of {{offshore}} resources is complex; although {{management of the}} beds of <b>internal</b> <b>waters</b> is vested in the provincial Crowns, management of beds of territorial seas is vested in the federal Crown (with management of the continental shelf and the exclusive economic zone). The beds and islands of the waters between Vancouver Island and mainland British Columbia have been declared {{the property of the}} Crown in right of British Columbia. Federal-provincial management agreements have been implemented concerning offshore petroleum resources in the areas around Newfoundland and Labrador and Nova Scotia.|$|E
40|$|AbstractAlthough <b>internal</b> <b>water</b> {{molecules}} {{are essential}} for the structure and function of many proteins, the structural and physical factors that govern internal hydration are poorly understood. We have examined the molecular determinants of internal hydration systematically, by solving the crystal structures of variants of staphylococcal nuclease with Gln- 66, Asn- 66, and Tyr- 66 at cryo (100 K) and room (298 K) temperatures, and comparing them with existing cryo and room temperature structures of variants with Glu- 66, Asp- 66, Lys- 66, Glu- 92 or Lys- 92 obtained under conditions of pH where the internal ionizable groups are in the neutral state. At cryogenic temperatures the polar moieties of all these internal side chains are hydrated except {{in the cases of}} Lys- 66 and Lys- 92. At room temperature the <b>internal</b> <b>water</b> molecules were observed only in variants with Glu- 66 and Tyr- 66; water molecules in the other variants are probably present but they are disordered and therefore undetectable crystallographically. Each <b>internal</b> <b>water</b> molecule establishes between 3 and 5 hydrogen bonds with the protein or with other <b>internal</b> <b>water</b> molecules. The strength of interactions between internal polar side chains and water molecules seems to decrease from carboxylic acids to amides to amines. Low temperature, low cavity volume, and the presence of oxygen atoms in the cavity increase the positional stability of <b>internal</b> <b>water</b> molecules. This set of structures and the physical insight they contribute into internal hydration will be useful for the development and benchmarking of computational methods for artificial hydration of pockets, cavities, and active sites in proteins...|$|R

It was proved that the first type of testing is appropriate for simulating {{the time course of}} the temperature at a selected depth of a thermally loaded, hot-working die surface layer, i. e., the temperature field on the die surface layer.

25|$|The naval Battle of Vuelta de Obligado {{took place}} on the waters of the Paraná River on 20 November 1845, between the Argentine Confederation, under the {{leadership}} of Juan Manuel de Rosas, and a combined Anglo-French fleet. The action was part of the larger Anglo-French blockade of the Río de la Plata. Although the attacking forces broke through the Argentine naval defenses and overran the land defenses, the battle proved that foreign ships could not safely navigate Argentine <b>internal</b> <b>waters</b> against its government's wishes. The battle also changed political feeling in South America, increasing support for Rosas and his government.|$|E
25|$|In 2006, {{following}} a debate and {{vote in the}} House of Commons, the Harper government renewed the NORAD (North American Aerospace Defense Command, initially created in 1957) agreement with the United States, making it permanent and adding maritime defense to the agreement, which previously covered only air defense. The additional coverage {{was a response to}} the increasing threat of mass terror attacks, and scenarios that included maritime dimensions. The NDP, which traditionally takes a pacifist position and has historically been opposed to Canadian participation in NORAD, was highly critical of the agreement, arguing that the arrangement will reduce Canadian sovereignty over the country's <b>internal</b> <b>waters.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{the context}} of the Cold War, Canada sent Inuit {{families}} to the far north in the High Arctic relocation, partly to establish territoriality. The Canadian monarch, Queen Elizabeth II, accompanied by the Duke of Edinburgh, Prince Charles, and Princess Anne, undertook in 1970 a tour of Northern Canada, in part to demonstrate to an unconvinced American government and the Soviet Union that Canada had certain claim to its Arctic territories, which were strategic during the Cold War. In addition, Canada claims the water within the Canadian Arctic Archipelago as its own <b>internal</b> <b>waters.</b> The United States is one of the countries which does not recognize Canada's, or any other countries', Arctic archipelagic water claims and has allegedly sent nuclear submarines under the ice near Canadian islands without requesting permission.|$|E

40|$|Protein {{crystals}} typically {{consist of}} ≈ 40 - 60 % <b>water.</b> The <b>internal</b> <b>water</b> forms solvent channels (≈ 2 - 4 nm in diameter) inside the crystals. We {{have studied the}} phase behavior of water inside protein crystals using a novel crystal freezing method: high-pressure cryocooling. Using x-ray diffraction, we demonstrated that the high-density amorphous (HDA) ice induced inside the high-pressure cryocooled protein crystal undergoes a phase transition to low-density amorphous (LDA) ice as the crystal is warmed from 80 to 170 K. We also found evidence for a liquid state of water during the ice transition. These results have significant implications for {{the understanding of the}} anomalous behavior of supercooled water. Protein crystals used in x-ray protein crystallography have properties that distinguish them from typical inorganic crystals. An important difference is that protein crystals contain <b>internal</b> <b>water,</b> typically amounting to 40 to 60 % of the volume of the crystal. This <b>internal</b> <b>water</b> forms solvent channels inside protein crystals, as shown i...|$|R
40|$|Using {{magnetic}} relaxation dispersion (MRD), we have previously {{shown that the}} four <b>internal</b> <b>water</b> molecules in bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI) exchange with bulk water on time scales between 10 (- 8) and 10 (- 4) s at room temperature. Because this exchange {{is controlled by the}} protein structure, <b>internal</b> <b>water</b> molecules can be used to probe rare conformational fluctuations. Here, we report (2) H and (17) O MRD data at three temperatures for wild-type BPTI and two BPTI variants where the 14 - 38 disulfide bond has been cleaved by a double Cys [...] > Ser mutation or by disulfide reduction and carboxamidomethylation. The MRD data show that the <b>internal</b> <b>water</b> molecules are conserved on disulfide cleavage. However, the exchange rate of the water molecule buried near the disulfide bond is enhanced by 2 - 4 orders of magnitude. The relation of water exchange to other dynamic processes in BPTI is discussed...|$|R
