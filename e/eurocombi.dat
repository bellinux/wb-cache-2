50|$|The maximum {{overall length}} in the EU and EEA member states was 18.75 m with a maximum weight of 40 tonnes, or 44 tonnes if {{carrying}} an ISO container. However, rules limiting the semi-trailers to 16.5 m and 18.75 m are met with trucks carrying a standardized 7.82 m body with one additional 7.82 m body on tow as a trailer. 25.25 metre truck combinations were developed under the branding of EcoCombi which influenced the name of <b>EuroCombi</b> for an ongoing standardization effort where such truck combinations shall be legal to operate in all jurisdictions of the European Economic Area. With the 50% increase in cargo weight, the fuel efficiency increases {{with an average of}} 20% with a corresponding relative decrease in carbon emissions and with the added benefit of one third fewer trucks on the road. The 1996 EU regulation defines a Europe Module System (EMS) as it was implemented in Sweden. The wording of EMS combinations and <b>EuroCombi</b> are now used interchangeably to point to truck combinations as specified in the EU document; however apart from Sweden and Finland the <b>EuroCombi</b> is only allowed to operate on specific tracks in other EU member states. Since 1996, when Sweden and Finland formally won a final exemption from the European Economic Area rules with 60 tonne and 25.25 m combinations, all other From 2006, 25.25 m truck trailer combinations are to be allowed on restricted routes within Germany, following a similar (on-going) trial in The Netherlands. Similarly, Denmark has allowed 25.25 m combinations on select routes. These vehicles will run a 60 tonne weight limit. Two types are to be used: 1) a 26 tonne truck pulling a dolly and semi-trailer, or 2) an articulated tractor unit pulling a B-double, member states gained the ability to adopt the same rules. In Italy the maximum permitted weight (unless exceptional transport is authorized) is 44 tonnes for any kind of combination with five axles or more.|$|E
