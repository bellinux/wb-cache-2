500|$|Cardcaptor Sakura {{was first}} {{conceived}} {{shortly before the}} conclusion of Clamp's Magic Knight Rayearth, which was serialized in Nakayoshi. Clamp's head editor Yamonouchi asked them to do another series in Nakayoshi, and Clamp {{decided to make a}} [...] "Nakayoshi-esque" [...] series, as opposed to Rayearth, which Clamp described as unlike anything they had done before. <b>Head</b> <b>Clamp</b> writer Nanase Ohkawa's first impulse was to create a magical girl series, despite not being well-versed in the genre. Ohkawa wanted the heroine Sakura {{to be in the same}} age group as the majority of Nakayoshis readers so that fans could relate to her. Due to it being different from how Clamp normally conceived characters, Ohkawa designed the other characters such as Tomoyo and Cerberus to be more like Clamp's previous creations. Once Ohkawa had enough information on the characters, she had the three artists in Clamp—Mokona, Tsubaki Nekoi and Satsuki Igarashi—design them based on her descriptions. When designing Cerberus, Ohkawa wanted a mascot-type companion for Sakura, but Nekoi tried various forms, including dogs and squirrels, before designing the final version. Syaoran and Toya were conceived to be a common type of character featured in Clamp's works.|$|E

40|$|The {{ability of}} facial {{thermography}} to detect {{disease in the}} internal carotid artery was evaluated. Unilateral forehead cooling of 0. 7 °C or greater was observed in 57 % of 30 cases with angiographically proved stenosis. Two provocative tests, facial cooling and a <b>head</b> <b>clamp,</b> increased the sensitivity rate to 83 %. The greatest overall sensitivity and specificity was obtained by using a <b>head</b> <b>clamp</b> especially designed to bilaterally occlude superficial temporal arteries. Facial thermography is a useful screening device in detecting carotid occlusive disease.

It has been found that, for the majority of impacts, the magnitude of the ball rebound spin was dependant on string stiffness.

In many cases, surgery is performed with complete reliance on the safety of the MHC. However, we experienced an extremely rare case in which the MHC accidentally broke while installing this system for immobilization of the head and neck.

The patient was a 58 -year-old female who was scheduled to undergo cervical laminoplasty under the diagnosis of degenerative spondylotic cervical stenosis. In an attempt to install an MHC, we fixed three pins in the scalp; however, the arm of the MHC system broke when force was applied from both directions. Fortunately, the patient remained in a stable position and did not sustain an injury to the head or neck. Fixation was performed using another MHC, and the surgery was performed successfully. The patient was discharged after surgery with no specific complications related to the MHC system.

40|$|M. Tech. (Biological and Health Technology) The {{manner in}} which ritual slaughterings are {{executed}} in the R. S. A. is unknown {{to the majority of}} the population. The requirements with which religious slaughterings must comply as well as the facilities used for that purpose are even less familiar. The subject of the Jewish method of slaughter (Shechita) has especially elicited much discussion, due to the major divergence of opinion between the Jewish community and animal welfare organisations, as far as the slaughter technique and restraining facilities are concerned. This study was undertaken in an endeavour to find a solution to the problems in the form of restraining facilities acceptable to both groups. The first phase comprised a literature study of Shechita. The second phase consisted of a study tour to the United States of America and Israel, to become acquainted with the latest technology employed for Shechita. The last phase entailed the construction of a prototype restrainer facility at the Johannesburg Abattoir to facilitate experiments {{for the development of a}} <b>head</b> <b>clamp.</b> The function of the <b>head</b> <b>clamp</b> is to restrain the animal in such a manner that it can be slaughtered in the upright position but still in full compliance with the rules of Shechita.

40|$|In this paper, we {{describe}} an experimental {{investigation of the}} oblique impact between a tennis ball and <b>head</b> <b>clamped</b> tennis racket. It {{was found that the}} magnitude of the ball rebound spin was not a function of the material, gage or tension of the string used in the tennis racket. Furthermore, it was concluded that all strings exhibit a sufficiently large friction coefficient that the ball begins to roll during impact. There is anecdotal evidence from tennis players that suggests that a high string tension or a rough string surface enable them to impart more spin to the ball. For example, players have been quoted as saying that a high string tension makes the strings “bite” into the ball, giving more spin. The data reported in this study do not support these observations. Analysis of the experimental data has shown that the balls are rebounding from the surface with more spin than would typically be associated with rolling. A second experiment showed that the balls commenced rolling at the mid-point of the impact. This information was used in a theoretical model to show that the spin that acts on the ball during the impact can be higher than the value of the rolling spin {{at the end of the}} impact. </p...|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages [67]- 69) The vibrational {{modes of}} several tennis rackets, including wooden, composite, and wide-body rackets, were determined {{through the use}} of impact modal analysis and a single frequency driving/scanning technique. It was observed that the mode frequencies of the rackets made of new composite materials and of a wide-body construction had a higher stiffness than the traditional wooden racket, as well as higher modal damping. The modes were divided into two catagories: one in which the motion was dominated by the frame, and one in which the motion was dominated by the strings. The dwell time and coefficient of restitution (COR) of a tennis ball was measured for three cases: 1) for the ball being dropped onto a hard surface, 2) for the ball being dropped onto the geometric center of the strings of the rackets with their <b>heads</b> <b>clamped,</b> and 3) for the ball being dropped onto the geometric center of the strings of the rackets with their handles firmly clamped. The COR for a new ball on a hard surface was found to be about 0. 79, and decreased with increasing impact velocity. The CORs for dropping the ball on the rackets with fixed heads were found to be approximately the same for all of the rackets, in the range 0. 90 - 0. 93. For the clamped handle case, the wide-body composite rackets had much higher CORs than the other rackets of about 0. 55 - 0. 53. M. S. (Master of Science...|$|R

40|$|A {{model of}} a tennis ball impact on a tennis racket has been {{developed}} in this study. An experimental investigation was conducted to detennine the dynamic properties of several different tennis balls. The balls were propelled at a piezoelectric force platform and the force acting on the ball was sampled, along with the ball rebound velocity. A visco-elastic model of this impact was developed {{and a set of}} model parameters were determined empirically for each ball type. The values of these parameters were independent of the ball impact velocity. The next stage of the study involved an experimental investigation of a ball impact on a <b>head</b> <b>clamped</b> tennis racket. In this experiment, tennis balls were propelled at the geometric string centre of a tennis racket. High speed cinematography was used to determine the ball and stringbed deformation during impact, and speed gates were used to measure the ball rebound velocity. A visco-elastic model of this impact was developed. The ball component of this model was identical to that for a {{model of a}} ball impact on a rigid force platform. The model parameter for the stringbed component was obtained from a simple quasi-static compression of the stringbed in which the applied force and resulting deformation were measured. The final stage of this study involved an investigation of the impact between a tennis ball and a freely supported tennis racket (this support method {{has been shown to be}} equivalent to a player gripping the tennis racket). In these experiments, the ball, stringbed and racket deformation were measured during impact, along with the velocity of the ball and racket after impact. A model was developed to simulate this impact in which it was assumed that the racket acted as a onedimensional flexible beam. The models which have been developed in this study are advancements of those which have been used in previously published literature. Experimental data was used to assess the accuracy of the results which were calculated by the models.
