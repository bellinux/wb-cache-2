25|$|A graham cracker is cookie or {{digestive}} biscuit {{made with}} <b>graham</b> <b>flour,</b> {{a combination of}} fine-ground white flour and coarse-ground wheat bran and germ. Graham crackers are often used for making s'mores and pie crusts. Graham bread was invented by a Presbyterian minister, Reverend Sylvester Graham in 1829, for his vegetarian diet. The Graham bread was high in fiber, made with non-sifted whole wheat flour and cut into little squares now known as graham crackers.|$|E

We all resented this displacement of our usual salt-rising loaf and delicious saleratus biscuits but we ate the hot gems, liberally splashed with butter, just as we would have eaten dog-biscuit or hardtack had it been put before us.|$|E
60|$|How correct Bertie Messener was I never dreamed. I {{decided that}} he was an alarmist. As for myself, I was content to remain and watch the fun. After I dropped him, instead of going {{directly}} home, I went on in a hunt for more food. To my surprise, I learned that the small groceries where I had bought in the morning were sold out. I extended my search to the Potrero, and by good luck managed to pick up another box of candles, two sacks of wheat flour, ten pounds of <b>graham</b> <b>flour</b> (which would do for the servants), a case of tinned corn, and two cases of tinned tomatoes. It did look as though {{there was going to be}} at least a temporary food shortage, and I hugged myself over the goodly stock of provisions I had laid in.|$|E

50|$|<b>Graham</b> <b>flour</b> is {{a special}} type of whole wheat flour. The {{endosperm}} is finely ground, as in white flour, while the bran and germ are coarsely ground. <b>Graham</b> <b>flour</b> is uncommon outside of the US (but see atta flour, a similar product, below). <b>Graham</b> <b>flour</b> {{is the basis of}} true graham crackers. Many graham crackers on the market are actually imitation grahams because they do not contain <b>graham</b> <b>flour</b> or even whole-wheat flour.|$|E
50|$|<b>Graham</b> <b>flour</b> {{is similar}} to whole wheat flour in that both are made from the whole grain; however <b>graham</b> <b>flour</b> is not sifted during milling (i.e. unbolted), and is ground more coarsely.|$|E

50|$|<b>Graham</b> <b>flour</b> is {{available}} at health food stores, some grocery stores, bakery supply stores, and some specialty and gourmet food shops, or directly from a flour mill that has experience making it.|$|E
50|$|Like Graham crackers, Graham bread {{was high}} in fiber and made from <b>graham</b> <b>flour</b> {{free from the}} {{chemical}} additives that were common in white bread at that time such as alum and chlorine. He argued that these chemical additives were unwholesome.|$|E
5000|$|Unbleached flour {{is simply}} flour {{that has not}} {{undergone}} bleaching and therefore {{does not have the}} color of [...] "white" [...] flour.

5000|$|As {{his fame}} spread, [...] "Grahamism" [...] became a {{movement}} and others, {{inspired by his}} preaching, began to develop and market <b>graham</b> <b>flour,</b> graham bread, and graham crackers; he neither invented nor endorsed any specific product, nor did he receive any money from their sale.|$|E
50|$|Granula was {{the first}} {{manufactured}} breakfast cereal. It was invented by James Caleb Jackson in 1863. Granula {{could be described as}} being a larger and tougher version of the somewhat similar later cereal Grape-Nuts. Granula however, consisted primarily of bran-rich <b>Graham</b> <b>flour</b> made into nugget shapes. The cereal had to be soaked overnight before it could be eaten.|$|E
50|$|The Reverend Sylvester Graham (July 5, 1794 - September 11, 1851), a 19th-century Presbyterian minister, was an American dietary reformer, {{best known}} for his {{emphasis}} on vegetarianism, the temperance movement and his emphasis on eating whole-grain bread; he did not invent <b>graham</b> <b>flour,</b> graham bread, or graham crackers, but those products were inspired by his preaching.|$|E
5000|$|Graham cracker {{crust is}} {{a style of}} pie crust made from crushed graham {{crackers}}. Graham crackers are a sweet American cracker made from unbleached, whole wheat <b>graham</b> <b>flour.</b> The crust is usually flavored and stiffened with butter or vegetable oil and sometimes sugar. [...] Graham cracker crust is a very common type of crust for cheesecakes and cream pies in America.|$|E
50|$|A {{substitute}} for {{it would be}} a mix of unbleached white flour and wheat middlings and this was commonly done prior to and after the passage of the Pure Food and Drug Act in 1906, but the FDA gradually established standards and eliminated imitations from the market.

50|$|<b>Graham</b> <b>flour</b> {{is a type}} {{of flour}} named after Sylvester Graham (1794-1851), an early {{advocate}} for dietary reform. Graham despised the discarding of nutrients such as germ and bran when making flour for white bread, and believed that using all of the grain in the milling of flour and baking of bread, was a remedy for the poor health of his fellow Americans during changes in diet brought on by the Industrial Revolution.|$|E
50|$|Nabisco {{considers}} Teddy Grahams to be {{a healthy}} snack choice. In a 1992 New York Times article, Eating Well, Marian Burros {{pointed out that}} Teddy Grahams use more bleached flour than actual whole wheat <b>graham</b> <b>flour.</b> In response, Nabisco increased the amount of whole grain flour used in the snack. The snacks also contain no trans fat and are also considered {{a good source of}} calcium with a significant amount of iron.

50|$|Aglossa cuprina {{has similar}} feeding habits {{to those of}} the grains moths. The larval stages feed {{primarily}} on dried grain based products including corn meal, whole wheat flour, <b>graham</b> <b>flour,</b> granola, and dried oats. The adults feed on butter, suet, and grease, and have even been found in excrement. They have been known to feed on dried remains of other insects as well. The adults fly at dusk between June and July. They hide in dark corners during the day and can be found in stables, outhouses, barns, warehouses, and cellars. They are also attracted to light and sugar.|$|E
50|$|Boston brown bread's colour {{comes from}} a mixture of flours, usually a mix {{of several of the}} following: cornmeal, rye, whole wheat, <b>graham</b> <b>flour,</b> and from the {{addition}} of sweeteners like molasses and maple syrup. Leavening most often comes from baking soda (sodium bicarbonate) though a few recipes use yeast. Raisins are often added. The batter is poured into a can, and steamed in a kettle. While most variations are quick breads, and can be made in less than an hour, several commercial brands are available. Brown bread is somewhat seasonal, being served mostly in fall and winter, and is frequently served with baked beans.|$|E
50|$|Another variety, the Hardangerlefse (from Hardanger in Norway), is {{made from}} yeast-risen <b>Graham</b> <b>flour</b> or a fine ground whole wheat flour (krotekake). The dough is rolled with a {{conventional}} rolling pin (and much more flour) until it is thin and does not stick to the surface. It is then cut with a grooved rolling pin in perpendicular directions, cutting a grid into the dough which prevents it from creating air pockets as it cooks. The grid cut can also aid in thinner rolling of the lefse, as the ridges help preserve structural integrity. The lefse is cooked at high temperature (400 °F or 205 °C) until browned, and then left to dry. It can also be freeze dried by repeatedly freezing and thawing.|$|E
5000|$|Schech's Mill is a {{historic}} mill in Houston County, Minnesota, United States. It {{is one of three}} watermills in Minnesota still operating solely with water power and the only one to have its original millstones. Built by John Blinn in 1876, it was purchased by a Minneapolis miller, Michael Schech who had emigrated from Bavaria, Germany. The mill produced cornmeal, rye buckwheat, wheat flour, <b>graham</b> <b>flour,</b> and whole wheat cereal, which was sold in Caledonia and Houston, Minnesota. Schech's Mill is unique in the state for retaining intact and operable machinery from the 1870s, after the middlings purifier had been introduced but before millstones were supplanted by roller mills. [...] In 1922, a concrete dam was built to replace the original wooden one.|$|E
5000|$|The Graham Cracker was {{inspired}} by the preaching of Sylvester Graham, who was a part of and strongly influenced by the 19th century temperance movement; Graham believed that a vegetarian diet anchored by home-made whole grain bread, made from wheat coarsely ground at home, as part of a lifestyle that involved minimizing pleasure and stimulation of all kinds, was how God intended people to live and that following this natural law would keep people healthy. His preaching was taken up widely in the US {{in the midst of the}} 1829-51 cholera pandemic. [...] His followers, Grahamites, formed one of the first vegetarian movements in the US, and <b>graham</b> <b>flour,</b> graham crackers, and graham bread were created for them and marketed to them; Graham did not invent these products nor profit from them.|$|E
5000|$|The main {{festival in}} the Savji {{community}} is Dasara or Dusshera, {{during which the}} goddess of power or Shakti is worshiped. Special culinary dishes such as edimi (made from wheat flour and <b>graham</b> <b>flour)</b> and arithi (made from wheat flour {{in the shape of}} Diyas) are prepared, and lalpani (intoxicants) are offered to the Goddess Bhavani. On every Kartika month Sapthami tithi in Shravana Nakshatra Savjis celebrate the birthday of Sri Sahastrarjun called [...] "Sahastrarjuna Jayanti" [...] with much pomp and gaiety. Sahastrarjun's image is carried in a procession in many places on the Sahastrarjuna Jayanti. Other traditional Hindu festivals that are celebrated include Diwali and Holi. Every year, communities in some places organize social gatherings and prayers to the deity called [...] "Bhandara". The function is preceded with prayer, bhajan, and aarti of the deity, followed by meals in the form of Prasad. The meal served during the function is mostly vegetarian food.|$|E
50|$|Modern mills {{typically}} use {{electricity or}} fossil fuels to spin heavy steel, or cast iron, serrated and flat rollers {{to separate the}} bran and germ from the endosperm. The endosperm is ground to create white flour, which may be recombined with the bran and germ to create whole grain or <b>graham</b> <b>flour.</b> The different milling techniques produce visibly different results, but {{can be made to}} produce nutritionally and functionally equivalent output. Stone-ground flour is, however, preferred by many bakers and natural food advocates because of its texture, nutty flavour, and the belief that it is nutritionally superior and has a better baking quality than steel-roller-milled flour. It is claimed that, as the stones grind relatively slowly, the wheat germ is not exposed to the sort of excessive temperatures that could cause the fat from the germ portion to oxidize and become rancid, which would destroy some of the vitamin content. Stone-milled flour {{has been found to be}} relatively high in thiamin, compared to roller-milled flour, especially when milled from hard wheat.|$|E
50|$|The names Granula and Granola were {{registered}} trademarks {{in the late}} 19th century United States for foods consisting of whole grain products crumbled and then baked until crisp, {{in contrast to the}} at that time (about 1900) contemporary invention, muesli, which is traditionally neither baked nor sweetened. The name is now a trademark only in Australia and New Zealand, but is still more commonly referred to as muesli there. The trademark is owned by the Australian Health & Nutrition Association Ltd.'s Sanitarium Health Food Company in Australia and Australasian Conference Association Limited in New Zealand.Granula was invented in Dansville, New York, by Dr. James Caleb Jackson at the Jackson Sanitarium in 1863. The Jackson Sanitarium was a prominent health spa that operated into the early 20th century on the hillside overlooking Dansville. It was also known as Our Home on the Hillside; thus the company formed to sell Jackson's cereal was known as the Our Home Granula Company. Granula was composed of <b>Graham</b> <b>flour</b> and was similar to an oversized form of Grape-Nuts. A similar cereal was developed by John Harvey Kellogg. It too was initially known as Granula, but the name was changed to Granola to avoid legal problems with Jackson.|$|E
