In the series of 37 tests, the ground was made by river sand whose particle size was adjusted by sieving to a mean particle size of 0. 6 mm. The diameter of the model footing and the <b>embedded</b> <b>depth</b> were considered as influential parameters in this study. The diameter of the model footings varied from 5 to 40 mm and the ratio of the footing diameter to the mean particle size was calculated as 8. 3 – 66. 7. The ratio of the <b>embedded</b> <b>depth</b> to the footing diameter was 0, 0. 5 and 1. 0. As a result, the bearing capacity in the same equivalent diameter of footing was not dependent on the diameter of model footing when the ratio of footing diameter to particle size is more than 50 with any ratio of <b>embedded</b> <b>depth</b> to footing diameter. Our results that the proposed relationship between the ratio of footing diameter to the particle size and the ratio of the <b>embedded</b> <b>depth</b> to the footing diameter can be used to choose a reasonable model footing diameter, <b>embedded</b> <b>depth</b> and the particle size of ground material for centrifugal model tests...|$|E

40|$|Embedded {{stabilizing}} piles are new anti-slide {{structures that}} are unlike traditional stabilizing piles. The pile heads are embedded {{at a certain}} depth {{below the surface of}} a slope. The piles do not need to support the thrust of the entire upslope sliding mass, and it is, therefore, possible to reduce the sliding thrust on the piles. The <b>embedded</b> <b>depth</b> of the pile heads is an important parameter to maximize the anti-sliding function. Based on an analysis of the stability mechanism of a reinforced landslide with one row of embedded stabilizing piles, a calculation method for the <b>embedded</b> <b>depth</b> of a pile head using limit equilibrium theory is proposed. The related calculation formula is derived in detail using the transfer coefficient method. The proposed method features a close correlation between the <b>embedded</b> <b>depth</b> of a pile head and the design factor of safety of a slope to be reinforced. Additionally, the method can quantitatively demonstrate the relationship that the factor of safety of the slope for the failure mode of the surpassing pile head decreases as the <b>embedded</b> <b>depth</b> of the pile head increases. For a given factor of safety, the range of the maximum bending moment, the maximum shear force on a pile and the lateral displacement at the pile head also can be approximately predicted. Several calculation examples that are closely related to practical engineering applications are examined to show the convenience and rationality of the proposed method. In addition, the theoretical analysis is compared with the results of the numerical simulation of an actual accumulation landslide control engineering project. The results further demonstrate that the proposed theoretical analysis method is reasonable and applicable...|$|E

Furthermore, the post installed on an embankment should have the resisting force of a construction site higher than 90 % of that of a test site.

The methods presented do not require a visible laser beam, but they assume the planar checkerboards patterns are visible for both the catadioptric camera and the 2 D laser range finder. Unlike other approaches, the methods proposed are evaluated at pixel error level using ground truth data from the calibration patterns projected in the omnidirectional image.

These pipelines are frequently subjected to earthquake induced upward displacements, {{which can cause}} significant social-economic loss to consumers and utility management. Further, high thermal and pressure of the conveying medium can induce differential stresses on the axial restrained pipe to result upward buckling of the pipeline that can disturb the serviceability conditions.

40|$|The {{paper is}} devoted {{to develop a new}} scheme to {{calculate}} impedance matrices for axial-symmetric foundations embedded in half-space medium. The half-space medium can be approximated by increasing thickness of one layer stratum on rigid bedrock due to the effect of material damping.

In reality, the effect of these reflection waves on impedance is getting small as the thickness of the one layer stratum increases. Therefore, the scheme will employ the solutions for one layer stratum with suppressing these reflection waves to generate the impedance for the case of half-space.
