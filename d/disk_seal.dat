40|$|Case StudyA 2500 HP {{integral}} gear compressor in an {{air separation}} plant experienced an impeller failure {{in the first stage}} of compression. The failure was extensive and took the dry air compressor off-line. Plant production was curtailed for several weeks. Initial investigation focused on the 1 st stage centrifugal compressor impeller and upstream dust filter. Most of the aluminum impeller was missing and portions of the air filter element had melted. With the sequence and cause unclear, a formal root cause analysis (RCA) was undertaken. The RCA process ultimately revealed that an unexpected thermite reaction occurred and consumed most of the aluminum impeller. During compressor shutdown, products of the intensely exothermic thermite reaction backflowed into the upstream dust filter causing the element to partially melt. The thermite reaction initiated in the impeller back <b>disk</b> <b>seal</b> area where metal oxides and fuel (debris) had collected. Viscous heating and temperatures greater than expected allowed the rotating labyrinth seal to creep. Contact with the babbitted stationary seal generated additional heat and further accelerated the creep process. Frictional heating in the impeller back <b>disk</b> <b>seal</b> initiated the reaction. Corrective actions to prevent reoccurrence included a creep resistant impeller back <b>disk</b> <b>seal</b> and a passive debris removal system to prevent debris particles from collecting in the impeller back <b>disk</b> <b>seal</b> area.

One drives the cracked gas compressor train {{and the other}} drives the propylene refrigeration compressor. The two machines are similar and this paper concentrates on the turbine driving the cracked gas compressors. Both turbines {{had a history of}} high vibration, short bearing life, and unusual sensitivity to thermal changes and imbalance due to operation near the second critical speed. In addition, numerous blade failures had occurred. When additional turbine performance was required, a complete review of the entire turbine including the blade designs, rotordynarnics, and governor operation was commissioned. The performance upgrade included new blading, <b>disks,</b> <b>seals,</b> and other changes to the steam path. A turning gear was added for slow-roll operation to relieve thermal effects and rotor bow. A technique was developed for mounting the turbine disks on the rotor to minimize axial disk runout and local couple imbalances. The high bearing temperatures and high vibration issues were addressed with changes in shaft and bearing designs. A submerged arc welding process increased the governor end journal diameter from 51 / 4 inches to 7 inches. A rotordynamic optimization analysis resulted in replacing the tilting pad bearing on the governor end with an offset-half lobed journal bearing. The tilting pad bearings on the exhaust end of the turbines were retained but redesigned for optimum performance. Interchangeability of bearings between the two machines was maintained. These shaft and bearing changes resulted in a significant reduction in babbitt temperature, shaft vibration, and imbalance sensitivity as well as control of the second critical speed. The interaction of the rotor with the foundation substructure was found to be significant, and its inclusion in the analysis was required to properly design the optimized bearings. The blade design changes and steam path changes produced a more reliable design and greater than the required extra power. The addition of a turning gear drive has eliminated the thermal bow problems. A new electronic governor system has eliminated the wear associated with the original hydraulic governor. Both turbines are now operating very smoothly at the capacity of the production facility...|$|R

40|$|Pigs (pipeline {{inspection}} gauges) {{are free}} moving piston-like devices, {{that are used}} for inspecting or cleaning pipelines in for example {{the oil and gas}} industry. Here they are used for onshore and offshore pipelines, where they are propelled by the production fluids. A better control of the velocity of the pig in the pipeline can be achieved by using so-called bypass pigs, which have an opening (bypass) that allows that some fluid passes by which reduces the pig velocity. A new development is a by-pass pig with speed control, in which the bypass area is adjusted when the pig moves through the pipeline to obtain a constant preset pig velocity. The goal of this research was to accurately describe the forces on a pig, with special emphasis on the friction between the pig and the pipe wall. Such a wall friction model can be used in pipeline simulation tools, that are used to prepare a pigging operation. The friction force is divided into two parts: (1) the normal force that the pig imposes on the pipeline wall (F_wall), and (2) the coefficient of friction (?) which converts F_wall to a friction force. F_wall is calculated by a non-linear finite element model for a 12 " <b>sealing</b> <b>disk</b> for a range of oversizes. A uniaxial tensile lab test was performed to fit the material coefficients used in the non-linear Mooney-Rivlin material model. It was shown that the results could be matched by a linear elastic analytical model with a correction factor Cor = 1. 45. An experiment was designed to measure both ? and F_wall for a range of pig disk oversizes. These values were measured for <b>sealing</b> <b>disks</b> with different thicknesses and made of different materials. The models were able to accurately describe the experiment results. Due to lubrication the coefficient of friction can drop by orders of magnitude. Lubrication can be described by the Reynolds equation for the fluid pressure of thin fluid films. The material of a pig that makes contact with the pipeline wall is deformed by this fluid pressure which can be described by soft elastohydrodynamic lubrication theory. To couple the linear elastic material of the <b>sealing</b> <b>disk</b> to the non-linear Reynolds equation, two numerical approaches were followed. Firstly, the linear elastic contact was described by a row of closely spaced linear springs. Secondly a lubrication model was made in which the linear elastic contact was described by the boundary element method. It was shown that these models give a good qualitative description of the lubrication behaviour. The model validation is left for future work. In addition, pressure drop measurements were performed in a flow loop for a model of the bypass pig. These measurements were compared with correlations from the literature.

40|$|In this thesis, {{manufacturing}} of microirradiators, electrodeposition {{of radioactive}} {{elements such as}} Ni- 63, and applications of these radioactive sources are discussed. Ni- 63 has a half life of 100 years and a low energy beta electron of 67 keV, ideal for low dose low linear energy transfer (LET) research. The main focus of the research is on the novel Ni- 63 microirradiator. It contains {{a small amount of}} total activity of radiation but a large flux, allowing the user to safely handle the microirradiator without extensive shielding. This thesis is divided into nine chapters. Properties of microirradiators and various competing radioactive sources are compared in the introduction (chapter 1). Detailed description of manufacturing Ni- 63 microirradiator using the microelectrode as the starting point is outlined in chapter 2. The microelectrode is a 25 µm in diameter Pt <b>disk</b> <b>sealed</b> in a pulled 1 mm diameter borosilicate capillary tube, as a protruding wire or recessed disk microelectrode. The electrochemically active surface area of each is verified by cyclic voltammetry. Electrodeposition of nickel with a detailed description of formulation of the electrochemical bath in a cold "non-radioactive setting" was optimized by using parameters as defined by pourbaix diagrams, radioactive electroplating of Ni- 63, and incorporation of safety regulations into electrodeposition. Calibration and characterization of the Ni- 63 microirradiators as protruding wire and recessed disk microirradiators is presented in chapter 3. In chapters 4 through 6, applications of the Ni- 63 microirradiators and wire sources are presented. Chapter 4 provides a radiobiological application of the recessed disk microirradiator and a modified flush microirradiator with osteosarcoma cancer cells. Cells were irradiated with 2000 to 1 Bq, and real time observations of DNA double strand breaks were observed. A novel benchtop detection system for the microirradiators is presented in chapter 5. Ni- 63 is most commonly measured by liquid scintillation counters, which are expensive and not easily accessible within a benchtop setting. Results show liquid scintillation measurements overestimates the amount of radiation coming from the recessed disk. A novel 10 µCi Ni- 63 electrochemically deposited wire acting as an ambient chemical ionization source for pharmaceutical tablets in mass spectrometry is in chapter 6. Typically, larger radioactive sources (15 mCi) of Ni- 63 have been used in an ambient ionization scenario. Additionally, this is the first application of using Ni- 63 to ionize in atmosphere pharmaceutical tablets, leading to a possible field portable device. In the last chapters, chapters 7 through 8, previous microirradiator experiments and future work are summarized. Chapter 7 illustrates the prototype of the electrochemically deposited microirradiator, the Te- 125 microirradiator. In conjunction with Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Te- 125 m is a low dose x-ray emitting element determined to be the best first prototype of an electrochemically deposited microirradiator. Manufacturing, characterization, and experiments that were not successful leading {{to the development of the}} Ni- 63 microirradiator are discussed.

40|$|The hydroacoustic nuclear {{explosion}} monitoring regime, like it's {{counterpart in}} seismic monitoring, requires ground truth calibration. Model predictions of traveltimes, blockages, reflections, diffractions, and waveform envelopes {{need to be}} verified with ground truth experiments, particularly in the high latitudes where models often fail. Although pressure detonated explosives are a simple, reliable, and flexible method to generate an impulsive hydroacoustic calibration source at a desired depth; safety procedures, specialized training, and local regulations often preclude their use. This leaves few alternatives since airgun and other seismic marine sources are designed for use only at shallow depths and hence do not effectively couple into the SOFAR channel, a necessary requirement for long range propagation. Imploding spheres could be an effective source at mid-ocean depths and below but development of a method to reliably break such spheres has been elusive. We designed and tested a prototype system to initiate catastrophic glass sphere failure at a prescribed depth. The system firmly holds a glass sphere in contact with a piston-ram assembly. The end cap on the cylinder confining the piston and opposing the ram has a rupture <b>disk</b> <b>sealed</b> to it. The rupture disk is calibrated to fail within 5 % of the calibrated failure pressure, 1000 psi in our tests. Failure of the rupture disk results in a sudden inrush of high pressure water into the air-filled piston chamber, driving the piston [...] and attached ram [...] towards the glass sphere. The spherecracker was first tested on Benthos Corp. flotation spheres. The spherecracker mechanism successfully punched {{a hole in the}} Benthos sphere at the nominal pressure of 1000 psi or at about 700 meters depth in each of four tests. Despite the violent inrush of high pressure water the spheres did not otherwise fail. We concluded that the Benthos spheres were too thick-walled to be used as an imploding source at nominal SOFAR channel depths (500 meters- 1200 meters in mid-latitudes). A much thinner walled sphere, a special order modification of a standard 22 liter laboratory boiling flask made by the Kontes Glass Company, was also tested and found to fail in the desired manner, i. e. catastrophically. A test off the coast of California successfully initiated implosion of a Kontes sphere at 685 meters depth. The recorded signal showed a peak pressure slightly larger than that from 1 lb of high explosive detonated at the same depth. The signal spectra showed relatively broad band higher frequency energy with little signal below about 50 Hz and a broad peak in the amplitude spectra between about 200 and 800 Hz, similar to that from an explosive source detonated at the same depth. Although additional testing and development is needed, an imploding sphere source for hydroacoustic calibrations appears viable. Since the source spectra frequencies are generally higher than the frequency band used for nuclear explosion monitoring, low frequency signals (1 - 50 Hz) will be absent from the implosion source spectra. Calibration will have to be accomplished with frequencies above 50 Hz unless larger spheres, multiple spheres, or shallower implosion depths are used...|$|R

Scaling and correlations of the velocity and temperature length scales as well as heat transfer effectiveness are also discussed in terms of Reynolds and rotational Grashof numbers.

40|$|This Six-Sigma Case Study was {{conducted}} in a local aerospace company that produces high quality precision-machined jet engine components. These complex turbine components have thin walls that must meet tight tolerances. <b>Disks,</b> shafts, rotating <b>seals,</b> plates, and cases {{range in size from}} 3 " to 80 " in diameter. This case focused on a 16 ” (diameter) rear cooling plate whose production required 18 machining processes. The objective was to determine if it was possible to eliminate the final manual lathing process. Manual lathing was used as the last step because the material characteristics of the plate and the stress induced by the previous processes caused the final product to expand. Stress can cause unsatisfactory changes in the plate’s dimensions. Stress is not only inherent in the material’s internal properties but is also induced during machining. It is critical that the operator’s cut is precise and does not remove too much material. During the two most critical steps of 18, measurements were taken. It was theorized that relaxing the first process tolerances could allow later processes to be numerically machine controlled to conform closer to the prescribed tolerance of the final product. Plates were tested using these revised tolerances. After the plate was shot peened (a stress redistribution process) measurements confirmed that non-conformance had been eliminated and the final machining process could be discontinued. Cost savings for eliminating the last machining and inspection process was $ 268 per plate or an annual saving of approximately 11 % of total cost for the item studied...|$|R
40|$|In digital forensics, {{data stored}} in a hard disk usually {{contains}} valuable evidence. Preserving {{the integrity of the}} data in the hard disk is a critical issue. A single hash value for the whole hard disk is not appropriate as the investigation may take a long time and latent sector errors (LSEs) (bad sectors due to media imperfection, for example) which cause a sector suddenly unreadable will make the hash value inconsistent. On the other hand, using a hash per sector may need to store a lot of hash values. Previous research has been conducted to use fewer hash values, but can resist some of LSEs to decrease the number of unverifiable sectors even if there are LSEs. This integrity problem is more complicated in the presence of Legal Professional Privileged (LPP) data inside a seized hard disk in digital forensic as the hard disk has to be cloned once seized and the original hard <b>disk</b> will be <b>sealed</b> after cloning. Hash values need to be computed during this cloning process. However, the cloned copy will be returned to the suspect for the deletion of LPP data before the investigator can work on the sanitized copy. Thus, the integrity of unmodified sectors has to be verified using the hash values computed based on the original hard disk. This paper found that existing schemes are not good enough to solve the integrity problem in the presence of both LSEs and deletion of LPP data. We then propose the idea of a "Dual Cube" hashing scheme to solve the problem. The experiments show the proposed scheme performs better than the previous schemes and fits easily into the digital forensic procedure. © 2011 IEEE. published_or_final_versionThe 6 th International Workshop on Systematic Approaches to Digital Forensic Engineering In conjunction with the IEEE Security and Privacy Symposium (IEEE/SADFE 2011), Oakland, CA., 26 May 2011.
