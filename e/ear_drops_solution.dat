40|$|Microbiological and {{clinical}} examinations have been made, {{related to the}} effect of Aurin <b>ear</b> <b>drops</b> - the <b>solution</b> "Primavet - Sofia" on dogs with acute and chronic conditions of external and media otitis. The pharmaceutical compatibility of the active substances and solution stability were examined. The inhibitory effects in vitro of Acidum boricum, Acidwn salicylicum Ethanolum and Aurin - solution on laboratory referents {{and clinical}}ly isolated strains of microorganisms were studied. The dosage and manner of application were specified and was considered the effect on different clinical forms of otitis were specified. In the course of the one-year examination period, it was ascertained that Aurin-solution possesses the necessary stability. The active Aurin-solution substances (Acidum boricum Acidum salicylicum, Novocainum) secure optimal composition of supporting substances, and high inhibitory activity in vitro on microbial strains in the examined agents of dog otitis. A dosage of 10 to 20 drops and touching the earconch with 5 - 10 drops twice a day, in the course of 5 - 7 days, has local antiseptic, anti-inflammatory, antimycotic and pain soothing effects. The healing effect of Aurin is due to selective antibacterial and antimycotic effects of the active substances used. The effectiveness against otitis is due to synergism of the effects of active and supporting substances.

40|$|To {{evaluate}} the variability and discrepancies {{among the most}} commonly prescribed <b>ear</b> <b>drops</b> sold at pharmacies in southern California. Prospective study evaluating 11 commonly used <b>ear</b> <b>drops</b> to treat otologic disorders. Randomly selected drug stores in three major counties in Southern California (Los Angeles, Orange, and San Diego) were included. Mean, range, minimum, and maximum prices for each drug were calculated and analyzed. The median income of pharmacy ZIP code was also cross-referenced. Data were collected from 108 pharmacies. The mean prices are noted {{for each of the}} individual drugs: Cortisporin (brand) 10 mL, $ 82. 70; neomycin, polymyxin B sulfates, and hydrocortisone (Cortisporin-generic) 10 mL, $ 34. 70; ofloxacin (generic) 10 mL, $ 99. 95; sulfacetamide (generic) 15 mL, $ 40. 18; Ciprodex (brand) 7. 5 mL, $ 194. 44; Cipro HC (brand) 10 mL, $ 233. 32; Vosol (brand) 15 mL, $ 120. 75; acetic acid (Vosol-generic) 10 mL, $ 116. 55; VosolHC (brand) 10 mL, $ 204. 14; acetic acid/aluminum acetate (Domeboro-generic) 60 mL, $ 22. 91; and Tobradex (brand) 5 mL, $ 166. 47.

40|$|Introduction and objective: Otitis externa, {{commonly}} called ear disease, {{is characterized by}} inflammation of the external ear canal. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the antimicrobial potential of Cassia fistula flowers, leaves and bark extracts against Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus mirabilis, Escherchia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter sp., and Candida albicans, pathogens causing otitis externa and their comparison with locally available <b>ear</b> <b>drops.</b> Materials and methods: Methanol, ethanol, acetone, aqueous (hot and cold) extracts from the flowers, leaves and bark of C. fistula were tested for their antimicrobial activity against six ear pathogens causing otitis externa determined by agar well diffusion method. Results: Organic flower and bark extracts displayed activity against all tested ear pathogens whereas leaf extract showed activity against four tested bacteria and aqueous extracts were unable to exhibit any antimicrobial activity. Of the three organic solvents evaluated, acetonic flower extract was found to be best against S. aureus followed by bark extract and leaf extract. The acetonic flower extract showed larger inhibition zones compared to the herbal <b>ear</b> <b>drops</b> with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 6. 25 mg/ml. Conclusion: Acetonic extract of C. fistula flower may be used to treat otitis externa especially caused by S. aureus. However, more detailed studies such as in vivo testing and pharmacokinetics properties are needed to determine its therapeutic potential. Significance and impact of the study: Due to antimicrobial effects of amaltas organic extracts on ear pathogens, use of flower acetonic extract in herbal <b>ear</b> <b>drops</b> is recommended...|$|R

40|$|In chronic {{draining}} ear {{associated with}} a tympanic membrane perforation, cholesteatoma, or both, the infection i s that of bacterial contamination. Both aerobic and anaerobic organisms are found, notably pseudomonas, staphylococcus, and en-teric organisms, particularly bacteroides. The disease exists because of a structural defect in the middle ear cleft, which requires surgery as definitive treatment. Medical therapy is valuable as a temporary measure in preoperative preparation, and in preven-tion and management of intracranial extension. Topical therapy with antibiotic <b>ear</b> <b>drops</b> is often helpful, but also important is local care with cleansing, drying, and an-tiseptic solutions or powders. Therapy i s usually directed toward the pseudomonas organisms with aminoglycoside-polymyxin combination otic drops. However, Bacteroides fragi l is now looms as an important pathogen in 73 % of affected patients. Chloramphenicol otic drops are indicated when such an infection is suspected or iden-tified.

50|$|Fungal {{ear canal}} infections, {{also known as}} otomycosis, range from inconsequential to {{extremely}} severe. Fungi can be saprophytic, {{in which there are}} no symptoms and the fungus simply co-exists in the ear canal in a harmless parasitic relationship with the host, in which case the only physical finding is the presence of a fungus. If the fungus begins active reproduction, the ear canal can fill with dense fungal debris, causing pressure and ever-increasing pain that is unrelenting until the fungus is removed from the canal and anti-fungal medication is used. Most antibacterial <b>ear</b> <b>drops</b> also contain a steroid to hasten resolution of canal edema and pain. Unfortunately, such drops make the fungal infection worse. Prolonged use of them promotes the growth of fungus in the ear canal. Antibacterial <b>ear</b> <b>drops</b> should be used a maximum of one week, but 5 days is usually enough. Otomycosis responds more than 95% of the time to a three-day course of the same over-the-counter anti-fungal solutions usedfor athlete's foot.|$|R
