25|$|The {{region is}} {{influenced}} by a major ocean current system. Off the coast, the west wind <b>drift</b> <b>current</b> splits to create the Alaska and the California currents (the California current system). The direction and strength of the currents regulate the upwelling/downwelling regime along the coast, with a flow towards the equator in summer (California current) and reversal in winter (Alaska current). In addition to these two currents, a large submarine canyon acts as a primary conduit for the transfer of sediment from the continental slope to the deep-sea.|$|E
25|$|The Atlantic Ocean to {{the west}} and the Eurasian {{continent}} to the east interact to modify the climate of the country. The warm waters of the Gulf Stream and the North Atlantic <b>Drift</b> <b>Current,</b> which warm Norway and Sweden, also warm Finland. Westerly winds bring the warm air currents into the Baltic areas and to the country's shores, moderating winter temperatures, especially in the south. These winds, because of clouds associated with weather systems accompanying the westerlies, also decrease the amount of sunshine received during the summer. By contrast, the continental high pressure system situated over the Eurasian continent counteracts the maritime influences, occasionally causing severe winters and high temperatures in the summer.|$|E
25|$|Finland's {{climate and}} soils make growing crops a {{particular}} challenge. The country lies between 60° and 70° north latitude - {{as far north}} as Alaska - and has severe winters and relatively short growing seasons that are sometimes interrupted by frosts. However, because the Gulf Stream and the North Atlantic <b>Drift</b> <b>Current</b> moderate the climate, and because of the relatively low elevation of the land area, Finland contains half of the world's arable land north of 60° north latitude. In response to the climate, farmers have relied on quick-ripening and frost-resistant varieties of crops. Most farmland had originally been either forest or swamp, and the soil had usually required treatment with lime and years of cultivation to neutralise excess acid and to develop fertility. Irrigation was generally not necessary, but drainage systems were often needed to remove excess water.|$|E

2500|$|Another factor {{currently}} being {{taken into consideration}} when designing conservation plans for future generations are anthropogenic barriers {{in the form of}} urban development and roads. These elements are acting as obstacles, causing fragmentation of the remaining grizzly bear population habitat and prevention of gene flow between subpopulations (for example, Banff National Park). This, in turn, is creating a decline in genetic diversity, and therefore the overall fitness of the general population is lowered. In light of these issues, conservation plans often include migration corridors by way of long strips of [...] "park forest" [...] to connect less developed areas, or by way of tunnels and overpasses over busy roads. Using GPS collar tracking, scientists can study whether or not these efforts are actually making a positive contribution towards resolving the problem. To date, most corridors are found to be infrequently used, and thus genetic isolation is currently occurring, which can result in inbreeding and therefore an increased frequency of deleterious genes through genetic <b>drift.</b> <b>Current</b> data suggest female grizzly bears are disproportionately less likely than males to use these corridors, which can prevent mate access and decrease the number of offspring.|$|E
50|$|Diffusion {{current is}} a current in a {{semiconductor}} {{caused by the}} diffusion of charge carriers (holes and/or electrons).

40|$|It {{is pointed}} out that the motion of the surface water over the world's oceans is a {{critical}} factor in controlling the large-scale transport processes of mass, momentum, and energy. It is also the key to solving the global air-sea interaction problem. The formulation used in the reported analysis is based on that of Leibovich (1977) with the essential modification of adding the Coriolis term so that the Ekman drift can be included. This modification does not invalidate the results of Craik and Leibovich (1976) and Leibovich (1977), which are primarily for the small-scale motions, but rather extends their work to cover large-scale mean motion. The results of the model indicate that the sea state could have strong influence on surface <b>drift</b> <b>currents</b> in the ocean.

25|$|The {{wind and}} waves create surface {{currents}} (designated as « <b>drift</b> <b>currents</b> »). These currents can decompose in one quasi permanent current (which varies within the hourly scale) and one movement of Stokes drift under {{the effect of}} rapid waves movement (at the echelon {{of a couple of}} seconds).).

It is shown that the diamagnetic drift, which is essential for the new physical phenomena obtained by Mecheri & Marsch (2008), can not contribute to the flux in the continuity equation. Moreover, the part of the ion polarization drift contribution to the ion cancels out exactly with the contribution of the part of the stress tensor drift to the same flux. Conclusions.
