40|$|This study {{proposed}} a novel framework for ear recognition based on Gabor wavelets and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The framework has three steps. In the first step, the ear is detected from {{an image of}} the face. In the second step, Gabor wavelets are used to extract <b>ear</b> <b>feature.</b> The Gabor wavelets, whose kernels are similar to the 2 D receptive field profiles of the mammalian cortical simple cells, exhibit desirable characteristics of spatial locality and orientation selectivity.

40|$|We propose an ear {{recognition}} {{system based}} on 2 D ear images which includes three stages: ear enrollment, feature extraction, and ear recognition. Ear enrollment includes ear detection and ear normalization. The ear detection approach based on improved Adaboost algorithm detects the ear part under complex background using two steps: offline cascaded classifier training and online ear detection. Then Active Shape Model is applied to segment the ear part and normalize all the ear images to the same size. For its eminent characteristics in spatial local feature extraction and orientation selection, Gabor filter based <b>ear</b> <b>feature</b> extraction is presented in this paper. Kernel Fisher Discriminant Analysis (KFDA) is then applied for dimension reduction of the high-dimensional Gabor features. Finally distance based classifier is applied for ear recognition. Experimental results of ear recognition on two datasets (USTB and UND datasets) {{and the performance of}} the ear authentication system show the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach...|$|E

40|$|Scientists {{claim that}} {{sometimes}} just 20 seconds are enough {{time in which}} to recognize a person. However, the human ability to recognize a person is quite limited {{to people who are}} closer or that have been known or associated with. On the contrary, an automatic identification system may require a longer time for recognition, but is able to recognize people in a larger set of potential identities. Nowadays, the most popular biometric identification system is certainly represented by fingerprints. However, present biometric techniques are numerous and include, for example, those exploiting hand shapes, iris scanning, face and <b>ear</b> <b>feature</b> extraction, handwriting recognition, and voice recognition. Early biometric systems were implemented by exploiting one-dimensional (1 D) features such as voice sound, as well as two-dimensional (2 D) ones such as images from fingerprints or the face. With technology advances and cost decreases, better and better devices and capture techniques have become available. These have been investigated and adopted in biometric settings too. Image vision techniques have not been excluded from this evolution-supported acceleration. The increase of computational resources has supported the development of stereo vision and multiview reconstruction. Later, three-dimensional (3 D) capture devices, such as laser or structured-light scanners as well as ultrasound-based systems, were introduced. The third dimension has therefore represented a significant advancement for the implementation of more and more accurate and efficient recognition systems. However, it also presents new challenges and new limits not yet overcome, which are the main motivation for the research in this context...|$|E

To this regard, a novel multi-modal approach to person authentication based on ear biometrics and gesture analysis is proposed in this paper. The idea is to coupling the discriminant power of ear, captured during the act of responding to a phone call, with the user's arm dynamics affecting the smartphone motion pattern due to behavioral and anatomical characteristics involved in this gesture. According to experiments conducted on a specifically built multi-modal database comprising a hundred subjects, we confirm that the 'responding gesture' has significant discriminating power and combined to <b>ear</b> <b>features</b> provides even greater robustness and accuracy in mobile authentication scenarios...|$|R
