The Phantom forces Christine to don the wedding dress and once again professes his love, and orders Christine to marry him.

Just then, Raoul enters the lair, and the Phantom ties him to a gate and threatens to kill him if Christine refuses to marry him. Christine reflects over the impossible choice before passionately kissing the Phantom to show him he is not alone in the world.

50|$|Bezel {{settings}} for <b>diamond</b> <b>rings</b> are also called rub-over settings; {{they have a}} diamond completely surrounded by a precious metal band which fastens the diamond securely into place.

This type of <b>diamond</b> <b>rings</b> setting is the most secure fastener for the stones. The bezel setting also protects the diamond better than other types of settings, such as the prong setting. A flush setting for <b>diamond</b> <b>rings</b> is a variation on the rub-over or bezel setting. In the flush setting, the stone is placed into an opening and affixed {{at the bottom of the}} stone. The top of the diamond is extended above the base.|$|R
