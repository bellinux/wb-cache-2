5|$|Belief that Cooper did {{not survive}} was bolstered {{by the fact that}} none of the money has ever been used. A {{quantity}} was found under riverbank silt, but its location <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>consistent</b> with Cooper dying or losing the ransom in the jump. This, combined with the knowledge that with law enforcement involved, a ransom would in effect be 100% bait money (a fact known to the public since the trial following the Lindbergh kidnapping) makes it less likely that Cooper had any intention of actually using the ransom money. A minority opinion is that a North American of Cooper's apparent sophistication could hardly have expected to spend or fence currency as hot as the ransom would predictably be, and he had carried out a planned dumping of the money before disappearing.|$|E
5|$|Wright met Darwin in {{the early}} 1760s, {{probably}} through their common connection of John Whitehurst, first consulting Darwin about ill health in 1767 when {{he stayed in the}} Darwin household for a week. The energy and vivacity of both Erasmus and Mary (Polly) Darwin impressed Wright. In the 1980s Eric Evans (National Gallery) suggested that Darwin is the figure in the left foreground who holds a watch. As this composed timekeeper <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>consistent</b> with Darwin's flamboyant character, {{it is more likely that}} this is Dr William Small. The attention to timekeeping fits with Dr Small's role as the social secretary for the Lunar circle. Small returned from Virginia in 1764 and established his practice in Birmingham in 1765, consistent with this being a meeting in 1767. The profile and wig of this figure are consistent with a contemporary portrait of Small by Tilly Kettle.|$|E

5|$|In Katherine Buetow's {{guide to}} the Australian Cattle Dog, Ian Dunbar {{makes the point that}} while people think of dog {{training}} as teaching a dog to sit, speak and roll over, the dog already knows how to do these things. Training, he says, involves teaching the dog that {{it is a good idea}} to do these things when a particular word is said or signal is given. He goes on to explain his belief that training is about opening communication channels, so that the dog knows what the handler wants it to do, and knows that it will be worth its while to do it. Consequences for the dog can be rewards for doing what is required, as recommended by Dunbar, or corrections where an unwanted behaviour is performed. Like other working breeds, the Australian Cattle Dog is intelligent and responsive; both of these traits can be an advantage in training where a structured, varied program is used, but can lead to unwanted outcomes if training <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>consistent,</b> or is repetitive and boring for the dog. Stock dog trainer Scott Lithgow recommends making training a game so the Cattle Dog learns that obedience leads to enjoyment. Many of a Cattle Dog's natural behaviours are undesirable in a pet: barking, chewing, chasing, digging, defending territory, and nipping heels. Training, therefore, involves helping the dog adopt a lifestyle that is probably very different from that of its droving ancestors. The Australian Cattle Dog is biddable, and responds well to training.|$|E
5|$|S. validum {{is known}} from the late Late Cretaceous Belly River Group (the Canadian {{equivalent}} to the Judith River Group in the US), and specimens have been recovered from the Dinosaur Park Formation (late Campanian, 76.5 to 75 mya) in Dinosaur Provincial Park (including the lectotype specimen), and the Oldman Formation (middle Campanian, 77.5 to 76.5 mya) of Alberta, Canada. The pachycephalosaurs Hanssuesia and Foraminacephale are also known from both formations. S. novomexicanum is {{known from the}} Fruitland (late Campanian, about 75 mya) and lower Kirtland Formation (late Campanian, about 74 mya) of New Mexico, and if this species correctly belongs in Stegoceras, the genus {{would have had a}} broad geographic distribution. The presence of similar pachycephalosaurs in both the west and north of North America during the latest Cretaceous shows that they were {{an important part of the}} dinosaur faunas there. It has traditionally been suggested that pachycehalosaurs inhabited mountain environments; wear of their skulls was supposedly a result of them having been rolled by water from upland areas, and comparisons with bighorn sheep reinforced the theory. In 2014, Jordan C. Mallon and Evans disputed this idea, as the wear and original locations of the skulls <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>consistent</b> with having been transported in such a way, and they instead proposed that North American pachycephalosaurs inhabited alluvial (associated with water) and coastal plain environments.|$|E
