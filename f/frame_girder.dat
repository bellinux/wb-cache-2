50|$|The {{fuselage}} of the Doris had {{a wooden}} <b>frame</b> <b>girder</b> structure with a rectangular cross section, tapering aft to a horizontal wedge. Forward {{of the wing}} trailing edge it was ply covered, with fabric covering elsewhere. At the nose the sides curved round smoothly {{and there was also}} rounded decking immediately ahead of the open cockpit, which was under the leading edge with the vertical front face of the wing support column against the pilot's back. The rear edge of the column dropped gradually away from the trailing edge to the upper fuselage. The angles of incidence were adjusted from the control column via pushrods, sideways movement rotating the wings in opposite directions to roll. Fore and aft movement decreased and increased the angles of incidence together. The intention was that in level flight the pilot should largely allow the wings to follow their optimum setting by themselves. In addition there was a tailplane trim lever, originally fixed to the control column. The high aspect ratio, all-moving tailplane was nearly rectangular in plan apart from angled tips and was fabric covered behind its leading edge. The Doris was a short aircraft and its vertical tail was therefore large, with a quadrant shaped fin and a near rectangular rudder which had a small cut-away at its base for tailplane movement. The vertical tail surfaces were fabric covered. Like the Stehaufchen, the Doris had a pair of horizontal landing skids. These were fixed to the fuselage at the nose and mounted on the ends of a pair of transverse, arched ash brackets on rubber shock absorbers.|$|E

40|$|AbstractPlastic {{analysis}} {{is used in}} design of steel structures composed of various elements such as beams, <b>frames,</b> <b>girders,</b> arches etc. Here it is applied for determining the load-carrying capacity or limiting load at which the structure collapses. In this paper is presented a C# program, which computes {{the value of the}} load factor and determines whether the static distribution of the bending moment is safe, using methods of plastic analysis. The program has the capability of generating the possible mechanisms of collapse visually. Basic and combined mechanisms, generated by the program, could be viewed on screen. This is particularly important when choosing the optimal solution, because different mechanisms with the same load factors can be compared. Several examples, presented here, show {{how easy it is to}} create the model and perform the analysis. This is not only a simple analysis program, but also a program to enable the designer to create his models and to explore as many alternatives as he wishes...|$|R
40|$|A {{lattice girder}} frame was {{compared}} with a combined lattice and Vierendeel girder frame on a single-story building with a frame span of 62. 0 m, column height of 15. 0 m, and ridge height of 17. 3 m. The lattice girder frame {{has the advantage of}} being a cheaper solution when considering steel usage. In contrast, the combined girder frame is a less complex production that has the advantage of cheaper labor costs in relation to the higher material consumption costs. The T-joint in Vierendeel girders, designed in accordance with EN 1993 - 1 - 8, was analyzed because of its key importance when designing the overall frame. Guidelines for the preliminary selection of the chord and post member cross sections in the Vierendeel girders based on their geometrical compatibility are given in this paper. This paper also describes a method for selecting the optimal static system for combined girder frames to achieve a more uniform bending moment distribution along the <b>frame</b> <b>girder</b> by adding additional posts...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Test of two {{specimens}} (four different joints) {{of steel}} secondary beam embedded in reinforced concrete girder in frame structure and one specimen with steel cantilever beam embedded in reinforced concrete girder under static load were conducted. The steel beam up-flange was pulled {{out because of}} the concrete cracks caused by the moment, shear and torsion at the upper zone of the concrete beam near the steel beam end. Shear failure of the concrete beam and the top flange pullout failure are the most hazardous failure modes. Lacking restraint of concrete and the reinforcement of steel bar in the concrete slab and catenary action of restraint steel beam, the capacity of steel cantilever beam is much smaller than other beams. Load-slip curve of top flange of steel beam, load-rotation curve of the steel beam end are obtained through experiment. Primary calculation method of joints flexural capacity related to section size of composite steel beam, embedded depth of steel beam, flange width of steel beam embedded end, height of <b>frame</b> <b>girder,</b> is put up with. Analytical results of ABAQUS are shown as follows. Top flange pullout failure of steel beam {{is caused by the}} detachment of concrete and steel beam end, and the warp of the concrete slab near the support plays an unfavorable action on the performance of the steel beam. The end rotational angle of the steel beam with anchor bar is smaller than that without. The steel beam with shear connectors develops a smaller rotational angle and a higher load capacity. 1...|$|E

50|$|Influenced by {{aerodynamicist}} Paul Jaray, {{the hull}} shape was more streamlined than the preceding P class, although traditionalists {{in the company}} insisted that {{a portion of the}} hull should be parallel sided to prevent instability. The structure consisted of 20 wire braced 13-sided transverse frames, all but the rear three and front two frames made up of kingpost-braced girders. These were spaced 10 m (32 ft 9 in) apart, with an intermediate frame in the middle of each bay, and were attached to a triangular section ventral keel, the apex of which was braced {{to the ends of the}} outer ends of the lower transverse <b>frame</b> <b>girders</b> on each side. The transverse frames were connected by 13 principal longitudinal girders, of which the one at the top of the hull was a more substantial W-section girder. There were secondary longitudinal girders between the principal girders. A central axial bracing cable running the length of the hull was fitted to reduce the load on the transverse bracing of the mainframes in the case of the deflation of a single gasbag. This feature was the subject of a Schütte Lanz patent, and had not previously been used by Zeppelin.|$|R

40|$|A new {{computerised}} design {{model for}} the buckling strength assessment of stiffened panels is presented. The overall formulation is very general, and in principle, any type of stiffening arrangements of open or closed profile type, corrugations etc. can be analysed. The model {{is based on an}} orthotropic version of Marguerre’s non-linear plate theory. The stiffened panel is treated as an integrated unit, allowing for internal redistribution of membrane stresses between component plates, while preventing overall buckling and permanent deformations/sets. By using non-linear plate theory, the strength model is more theoretical consistent than existing code formulations, which are mainly based on empirical curve fitting to a limited number of numerical and experimental results. Complicated items such as bi-axial loading combined with in-plane shear loads and non-linear mode interaction problems are dealt with in a sound physical framework, and empirical approximations are reduced to a minimum. The model also provides a set of reduced anisotropic/orthotropic macro material coefficients {{that can be used in}} refined linear global FE analysis of ship hulls to reflect the increased membrane flexibility experienced by compressed stiffened panels. This area of application allows for redistribution of loads between gross elements such as stiffened panels, <b>frames,</b> <b>girders</b> and bulkheads and ensures a more realistic assessment of the nominal stress flow in a ship hull. The presented model is planned to constitute the basis for a new DNV buckling procedure for stiffened panels...|$|R
30|$|Krauss and Rogalla (1996) conducted, what is likely, {{the most}} {{comprehensive}} study to date. They surveyed 52 transportation agencies in the United States and Canada to evaluate early age transverse cracking. Over 100, 000 bridges {{were found to have}} developed early transverse cracks. Analytical studies were also performed using both theoretical and finite element analysis to evaluate the influence of several parameters on transverse cracking. The researchers determined that span type, concrete strength, and girder type were the most important design factors influencing transverse cracking. Material properties such as cement content, cement composition, early-age elastic modulus, creep, aggregate type, heat of hydration, and drying shrinkage also influenced deck cracking. Researchers conducted a field investigation of 72 bridge decks in Minnesota. The researchers determined that the most related design factors to transverse cracking were longitudinal restraint, deck thickness, and top transverse bar size. The material factors that affect transverse cracking the most were cement content, aggregate type and quantity, and air content. Researchers in Minnesota performed a parametric study considering bridges with steel and prestressed concrete girders. Among variables considered for steel girder bridges were end conditions, girder stiffness, locations of cross <b>frames,</b> <b>girder</b> splices, supplemental reinforcing bars, shrinkage properties, concrete modulus of elasticity, and temperature differential due to heat of hydration. Variables considered for prestressed girder bridges were the times casting in relation to the times of both strand release and deck casting and shrinkage properties of the deck and girders.|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (page 76) The {{purpose of}} this study is to introduce the design concept of tapered structural members. At present, there exists a variety of books and papers about this subject which go into depth however there are not many books available regarding applications of the concept into design of these members as a whole. This paper will serve as a summary discussion of the subject and application of the concept into design of a real structure. The project consists of two parts. The first part of the project deals with theoretical aspects of the subject and its relations to the AISC Specifications. The second part is a complete design example of the applications of the subject in real life structure. For this purpose; it was decided to design a 747 Jumbojet airplane hanger. Due to the large dimensions of the airplane, a common steel frame building is not a good and economical choice. Large wing spans of the airplane will dictate long beam spans and not allow interior bracing members. In other words there will not be any resistance against wind or seismic effects, therefore rigid <b>frame</b> tapered <b>girders</b> are the most appropriate solutions...|$|R
