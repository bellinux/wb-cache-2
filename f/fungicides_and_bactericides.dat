40|$|Only a small {{percentage}} of insect species are pests. However, pest species cause significant losses in agricultural and forest crops, and many are vectors of diseases. Currently, many scientists are focused on developing new tools to control insect populations, including secondary plant metabolites, e. g., alkaloids, glycoalkaloids, terpenoids, organic acids and alcohols, which show promise for use in plant protection. These compounds can affect insects at all levels of biological organization, but their action generally disturbs cellular and physiological processes, e. g., by altering redox balance, hormonal regulation, neuronal signalization or reproduction in exposed individuals. Secondary plant metabolites cause toxic effects that can be observed at both lethal and sublethal levels, but the most important effect is repellence. Plants from the Solanaceae family, which contains numerous economically and ecologically important species, produce various substances that affect insects belonging to most orders, particularly herbivorous insects and other pests.

40|$|Although the European Union {{is aiming}} at banning copper {{fungicides}} in organic farming, an alternative {{with the same}} efficacy as copper is not yet available and the control of phytopathogenic oomycetes is still based mainly on the application of this metal. Thus the combination of low doses of copper with a biocontrol agent could be a short term strategy. Copper is a large spectrum <b>fungicide</b> <b>and</b> <b>bactericide,</b> so the combination with microbial biocontrol agents could be very difficult. Up to now the selection of new biocontrol agents did not take in account the possibility to be combined or alternated in strategies with reduced doses of copper and no studies exist regarding this approach. On this basis, we selected a bacterial strain, Lysobacter capsici AZ 78, which is able to survive in presence of copper ions and effectively control Plasmopara viticola and Phytophthora infestans. Trials carried out under controlled conditions showed {{that the combination of}} L. capsici AZ 78 and low doses of copper-based fungicides provided a better control of both the oomycetes than the two active ingredients used solo. Following the sequencing and annotation of the genome of L. capsici AZ 78, we hypothesize that the copper resistance relies on the presence of genes encoding for copper efflux system as the copper exporting PIB-type ATPases (ctpA) and the copper resistant operon that contains the genes encoding for the multicopper oxidase (copA) and copper resistance protein B (copB). Interestingly, mining the genome of L. capsici AZ 78 also showed the presence of several genes involved in the resistance to other heavy metals as arsenic (arsenate reductase), cadmium, cobalt and zinc (Resistance-nodulation-cell division multidrug transporters). Overall, the results achieved in this work suggest that L. capsici AZ 78 could be a suitable candidate for developing a new biofungicide that can be combined with low doses of copper in organic farming. Furthermore, the resistance to other heavy metals of L. capsici AZ 78 may be the basis for other type of uses, for example as biofungicide in heavy metal contaminated soils...|$|R

After four years of repeated additions, we measured microbial biomass by fumigation-extraction and phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis, the fungal to bacterial biomass ratio by PLFA analysis and estimated the numbers of protozoa and nematodes, assigned into feeding groups. The fungal to bacterial ratio of nematode feeding groups was around 0. 2, indicating a bacterial-based food web in both communities. The size of the microbial biomass did not change after the additions, except when the amount of available carbon was increased (low altitude heath) or when addition of carbon was combined with fertilizer (high altitude heath). In contrast, fertilizer but not carbon increased the number of microbivores. This suggests that the amount of available carbon and not grazing pressure controls the size of the microbial biomass, Furthermore, it suggests that the food quality, e. g. nutrient content of the micro-organisms, had a larger effect on the microbivore than the size of the microbial biomass.

40|$|Potato (Solanum tuberosum) is {{the fourth}} most {{important}} food crop {{in the world and}} its production has been increasing lately by 1. 4 % per year. However, this crop is affected by many soil-borne diseases that can cause major economic losses. The main causal agents are fungi (e. g. Phytophthora infestans causing late blight and Fusarium solani producing dry rot), bacteria (e. g. Pectobacterium carotovorum, responsible for tuber soft-rotting and Streptomyces scabies causing tuber common scab) and some viruses. At present, some of these phytopathogens are controlled by an extensive use of agro-chemicals, causing the emergence of pathogens resistant to the available commercial pesticides, whereas for others there is no active pesticide in the market (i. e. S. scabies). Within an environmental-friendly integrated pest management programme, the use of bacterial strains with proven ability to suppress plant pathogens seems {{to be one of the}} best alternatives. Therefore, this work aimed at isolating and characterizing indigenous soil bacteria associated to potato-agrosystems for disease biocontrol. For this purpose, 2, 600 strains of Bacillus spp. and Pseudomonas spp. were isolated from several soil substrates associated with potato-agrosystems in Belgium. On the basis of this collection, broad screenings of antagonistic activities against P. infestans, F. solani, P. carotovorum and S. scabies were performed and permitted to select 60 strains (45 Bacillus spp. and 15 Pseudomonas spp.) displaying a high biocontrol potential. The selected strains were identified by sequencing of their 16 S rRNA gene, and preliminary genetic characterizations indicated that they do not represent any pathogenic potential to vertebrates or plants. The <b>fungicide</b> <b>and</b> <b>bactericide</b> activities displayed by the selected strains, coupled with the capacity to elicit the plant defense responses in Arabidopsis thaliana, pointed out that a versatile nature of metabolites is produced by these strains. Remarkably, some strains strongly inhibit S. scabies growth in vitro, representing excellent candidates to evaluate for biocontrolling common scab. PCR screenings for genetic determinants and other tests showed that molecules related to Zwittermicin A, Fengycin, Bacillicin, AHL-lactonases, surfactin and siderophores might be produced by the selected strains. Currently, the strains with the highest antagonistic activity and/or eliciting capacities are being intensively studied in order to decipher the different bioactive molecules they are able to produce. Moreover, formulations like sporulation for Bacillus spp. and lyophilisation for Pseudomomas spp., are being tested on plants. These antagonistic indigenous soil bacteria will offer a save alternative to the indiscriminate use of pesticide in potato-agrosystems, along with the possibility of combined application with other control measures.

30|$|Pesticides {{are widely}} used within the industrialized {{agriculture}} {{as shown by the}} great amounts that are worldwide applied (ca. 395, 944.4  t a− 1 in Europe 2014 —Eurostats, Pesticide sales Reg. 1185 / 2009, [54]). The majority of the applied pesticides in Europe are <b>fungicides</b> <b>and</b> <b>bactericides</b> (44 %) followed by herbicides (33 %). Insecticides and acaricides still share 5 % of the total amount, which corresponds to 20, 706.3  t a− 1 in entire Europe in 2014. In spite of intensified efforts in terms of regulation and technological advances for environmental risk mitigation, recent studies revealed that pesticides still massively contribute to the toxicity to non-target organisms within surface waters in Europe [37, 53]. Regular monitoring programs of surface waters revealed thereby that pesticides do not occur equally during the year, but appear to specific seasons, which, of course, correlates with respective agricultural activities. In late summer to autumn, primarily herbicides are used in terms of pre harvest application (siccation), post-harvest preparation, pre emergence treatment, as well as for weed treatment within the crops. In spring and early summer, predominantly insecticides are used to control emerging insect pests. Therefore, non-target organisms within the aquatic environment are regularly exposed to different pesticides during respective developmental stages of their life cycle. Consequently, the seasonal exposure pattern may cause harmful effects either directly or indirectly, which pose a specific risk for insects with uni- or paravoltine lifecycles in the aquatic environment.|$|E

The aim of this work was to monitor the distribution of some toxic heavy metals such as cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr), copper (Cu), nickel (Ni), lead (Pb) zinc (Zn), iron (Fe) and arsenic (As) during craft beers production (three types of beer produced in four different breweries). The instrumental method adopted in this investigation was inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The collected results demonstrated how a very low (μg/L) heavy metal contamination (mainly Cr, Zn and Cu) was provided by raw materials (water, malt, hops and yeasts) and that these toxic metals mostly pass into the residuals (spent grains, hot trub and yeasts), so only a negligible fraction of them can be detected in beer. For example, treating hops with a high dose of pesticides containing Cu did not cause an increase in its content in final beer because a large part of copper remains in hot trub. Furthermore, the filtration phase caused the increase in the concentration of Cd, Zn, Fe and As, probably due to the use of filtration aids. These increases were insignificant healthwise [[URL] edqm. eu/en/Metals-and-alloys-used-in-food-contact-materials- and-articles- 1 st-Edition-(CouncilofEurope, 2002) ].

40|$|Thesis (MScAgric) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2012. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: Fruit {{trees are}} exposed to various factors that can {{adversely}} affect the production of quality fruit. These factors can directly affect the fruit {{and the health of}} the tree and can be classified according to their biotic or abiotic nature, such as pathogenic attacks and drought stress respectively. One of the cultural practices used commercially to address these stresses is the application of <b>fungicides</b> <b>and</b> <b>bactericides.</b> The fruit production industry is under severe pressure from consumers, retailers and environmentalists, locally and internationally, to reduce chemical applications to fruit and fruit trees. The use of natural plant defence elicitor compounds and nutrients offer a potential alternative to fungicide and bactericide sprays and may also increase fruit quality and size as result of a reduction of plant stress. Trials were conducted to evaluate the efficiency of natural plant defence elicitors i. e. salicylic acid (SA) and flavonoids, in addition to mineral nutrients and bactericide/fungicides, on peach (incidence of Xanthomonas infection), plum (induced drought stress and Mg/Mn deficiencies) and apple (Mg/Mn deficiencies) fruit and trees against specified biotic or abiotic stress factors. Trial on Prunus persica cv. ‘Sandvliet’were conducted over two seasons (2008 / 2009 and 2011 / 2012) on a commercial site, Protea Farm, in the Worcester area in the Western Cape Province. During the 2008 / 2009 season the SA (AlexinTM, AlexiboostTM) containing treatments were applied first at 75 % petal drop at concentrations of 125 and 250 ml. 100 L- 1. The copper (StCu, Cu) -containing treatment was applied at 50 % petal drop, while dichlorophen (XanbacTM) treatments were applied at fruit set at concentrations of 150, 300 and 200 ml. 100 L- 1. The flavonoid (CroplifeTM) treatment was applied at the start of petal drop at a concentration of 150 ml. 100 L- 1. During the 2011 / 2012 season, a new flavonoid (CropbiolifeTM) treatment, as well as potassium (K-MaxTM) treatment, were incorporated into the trial and applied at concentrations of 150 and 500 ml. 100 L- 1 respectively. Additionally a SA (AlexinTM) and dichlorophen (XanbacTM) treatments that performed well during the first season, were incorporated into the second season with application times and rates similar to the first season’s protocol. In addition to fruit size and quality measurements, the percentage Xanthomonas infection was determined on the leaves and fruit of the experimental trees. The SA (AlexinTM) containing treatment significantly reduced the incidence of Xanthomonas infection on leaves and fruit compared to the control in the first season. However, results varied between the two seasons, as no significant difference from the control could be obtained in the following season. The AlexinTM treatments also significantly increased the fruit size and quality. The flavonoid (CropbiolifeTM) and K (K-MaxTM) containing treatments similarly reduced the Xanthomonas infection on leaves and fruit, as well as increasing the fruit size and quality in the second season. The dichlorophen (XanbacTM) containing treatment recorded varying results as it significantly reduced the Xanthomonas infection on the fruit only in the second season. The plum trials were conducted over the 2011 / 2012 season on ‘Laetitia’ and ‘Songold’ plum trees, Welgevallen Experimental Farm, Stellenbosch University. Three SA (AlexinTM, AlexSal and RezistTM) containing foliar treatments were applied on the ‘Laetitia’ trees. Only two SA (AlexinTM, AlexSal) containing foliar treatments were applied on the ‘Songold’ trees. Additionally, a foliar treatment containing only K, Ca, Mg and B, was applied in both the ‘Laetitia’ and ‘Songold’ trials. All the treatments were first applied at 75 % petal drop, at the same concentration of 250 ml. 100 L- 1. Additionally to fruit size and quality, the mineral nutrient content of the leaves and fruit was determined. The ascorbic acid and glutathione content was determined in fruit at harvest and again after storage. None of the treatments had a positive effect on the parameters measured, except the SA (AlexinTM) containing treatments which increased the titratible acidity (TA) in both at harvest and after storage. The treatments also did not alleviate the induced stress compared to the control. The apple and plum tree trials were conducted over the 2011 / 2012 season in a semi-closed greenhouse, at the Welgevallen Experimental Farm, Stellenbosch. Magnesium (Mg) and Manganese (Mn) deficiencies were induced in one-year-old ‘Royal Beaut’ apple and ‘Laetitia’ plum trees planted in 10 L nursery bags, by omitting these nutrients from a standard Long Ashton soil application. Foliar treatments of Mg (MagMaxTM) and Mn (ManMaxTM) containing sprays were subsequently applied at concentrations of 250 and 75 ml. 100 L- 1 respectively, after deficiency symptoms for these nutrients were visually observed. Mineral nutrient analysis of the leaves were analysed on the 13 th of February for the plums and 30 th of March 2012, for the apples. The Mn (ManMaxTM) containing treatment successfully overcame the Mn induced deficiency. The Mg (MagMaxTM) containing treatment did not overcome the induced Mg deficiency and was probably due to the deficient nitrogen levels in the plants, caused by an error in the initial Long Ashton nutrient solution formulation. In conclusion AlexinTM, K-MaxTM and CropbiolifeTM have shown their ability to decrease Xanthomonas infection in peaches. Additionally to their positive effect on fruit size and quality on the peaches. SA was not able to overcome the induced stress on plums, but had a positive effect on the fruit quality and size. The ManMaxTM been proven to overcome the induced Mn deficiency, while MagMaxTM was unsuccessful to overcome the Mg deficiency. AFRIKAANSE OPSOMMING: Vrugtebome word blootgestel aan verskeie faktore wat die produksie van kwaliteit vrugte nadelig kan beïnvloed. Hierdie faktore kan ‘n direkte invloed hê op die vrugte en op die gesondheid van die boom en kan geklassifiseer word op grond van hulle biotiese of abiotiese natuur, soos patogeen infeksie en droogte stres onderskeidelik. Van die produksie praktyke wat gebruik word sluit in die toepassing van verskillende swamdoders en bakterisiede. Die vrugtebedryf is onder geweldige druk van verbruikers, die kleinhandel en omgewingsbewustes om die toediening van chemikalieë aan vrugte en vrugtebome te verminder. Die gebruik van natuurlike plant verdediging stimulerende verbindings en nutriënte, bied 'n moontlike alternatief tot die spuit van swamdoders en bakterisiede, en kan ook moontlik ŉ bydrae maak tot verbeterde vrugkwaliteit en -grootte. Proewe is uitgevoer om die effektiwiteit van die natuurlike plant verdediging stimulante, salisielsuur (SA) en flavonoïede, addisioneel tot verskillende voedingstowwe en bakterieële / swamdoders op perske, pruim en appels teen Xanthomonas infeksie, droogte stres en Mg / Mn tekorte as biotiese en abiotiese stres faktore onderskeidelik te evalueer. Die Prunus persica ‘Sandvliet’ proewe is oor twee seisoene (2008 / 2009 en 2011 / 2012) op 'n kommersiële perseel, Protea Farm, in die Worcester-area in die Wes-Kaap Provinsie, uitgevoer. Gedurende die 2008 / 2009 seisoen is die SA (AlexinTM, AlexiboostTM) bevattende behandelings eers toegedien by 75 % blomblaarval teen konsentrasies 125 en 250 ml. 100 L- 1. Die koper (StCu, Cu) bevattende behandeling is toegedien by 50 % blomblaarval, terwyl die dichlorofen (XanbacTM) bevattende behandelings toegedien is by vrugset, teen konsentrasies van 150, 300 en 200 ml. 100 L- 1. Die flavonoïde (CroplifeTM) behandeling is toegedien by die begin van blomblaarval teen 'n konsentrasie van 150 ml. 100 L- 1. Gedurende die 2011 / 2012 seisoen was 'n nuwe flavonoïd (CropbiolifeTM) en ‘n kalium (K-MaxTM) behandeling toegevoeg tot die eksperiment, met ŉ toediening teen konsentrasies van onderskeidelik 150 en 500 ml. 100 L- 1. Daarbenewens is die SA (AlexinTM) en dichlorofen (XanbacTM) behandeling van die 2008 / 2009 seisoen herhaal teen dieselfde konsentrasies en toedieningstye soos in die protokol van die eerste seisoen. Behalwe vir die bepaling van vruggrootte en –kwaliteit, is die persentasie Xanthomonas infeksie op blare en vrugte ook bepaal. Die SA (AlexinTM) bevattende behandeling het die voorkoms van Xanthomonas infeksie op die blare en vrugte betekenisvol verminder in vergelyking met die kontrole. Resultate het egter gewissel in die daaropvolgende seisoen en geen beduidende verskille tussen die behandelings is waargeneem nie. Hierdie SA-bevattende behandelings het ook tot ‘n toename in vruggrootte en -kwaliteit gelei. Die flavonoïde bevattende behandelings, (CropbiolifeTM) en K (K-MaxTM), het soortgelyke afnames in Xanthomonas infeksie op die blare en vrugte in die tweede seisoen getoon, sowel as ‘n toename in vruggrootte en -kwaliteit. Die dichlorofen (XanbacTM) bevattende behandeling het variërende resultate getoon aangesien dit slegs tot ‘n beduidende afname in Xanthomonas infeksie op die blare en vrugte in die tweede seisoen kon lei. Pruim proewe is uitgevoer in die 2011 / 2012 seisoen op ‘Laetitia’ en ‘Songold’ pruimbome te Welgevallen Proefplaas, Universiteit van Stellenbosch. Drie SA (AlexinTM, AlexSal en RezistTM) bevattende blaar behandelings is toegedien op die ‘Laetitia’ bome. Slegs twee SA (AlexinTM, AlexSal) blaar behandelinge is toegedien op die ‘Songold’ bome. ŉ Verdere K, Ca, Mg en B blaar behandeling is ook toegedien in beide die ‘Laetitia’ en ‘Songold’ proewe. Al die behandelings se eerste toediening het saamgeval met 75 % blomblaarval, teen dieselfde konsentrasie van 250 ml. 100 L- 1. Addisioneel tot vruggrootte en –kwaliteit, is die mineraal element inhoud van die blare en vrugte bepaal. Die askorbiensuur en glutatioon inhoud is bepaal in die vrugte met oes asook na opberging. Geen behandeling het 'n positiewe uitwerking op die parameters wat gemeet is getoon nie, behalwe een van die SA (AlexinTM) bevattende behandelings wat die titreerbare sure (TS) verhoog het in beide kultivars. Die behandelings kon ook nie die geïnduseerde stres verlig in vergelyking met die kontrole nie. Die appel- en pruim proewe is uitgevoer gedurende die 2011 / 2012 seisoen in 'n semi-geslote glashuis te Welgevallen Proefplaas, Universiteit van Stellenbosch. Magnesium (Mg) en Mangaan (Mn) tekorte is geïnduseer in een-jaar-oue ‘Royal Beaut’ appel en ‘Laetitia’ pruim bome, aangeplant in 10 L kwekerysakke, deur dié elemente uit ŉ toediening van standaard Long-Ashton voedingsoplossing aan die grond weg te laat. Mg (MagMaxTM) en Mn (ManMaxTM) bevattende blaarspuite is daarna toegepas teen onderskeidelik konsentrasies van 250 en 75 ml. 100 L- 1. ŉ Minerale analise van die blare is uitgevoer op 13 Februarie, op die pruime en 30 Maart 2012, op die appels. Die Mn (ManMaxTM) bevattend behandeling het die Mn-geïnduseerde tekort verlig. Die Mg (MagMaxTM) bevattende behandeling het nie die geïnduseerde Mg-tekort verlig nie. Dit is moontlik toe te skryf aan die stikstof tekort in die plante wat te wyte was aan ŉ foutiewe Long Ashton voedingsoplossing formulasie wat aanvanklik toegedien is. Ten slotte het AlexinTM, K-MaxTM en CropbiolifeTM getoon dat hul die vermoë het om Xanthomonas infeksie te verminder, asook om vruggrootte en kwaliteit in perskes te verbeter. SA was nie in staat om die geïnduseerde stres op pruime te oorkom nie, maar het 'n positiewe uitwerking op die vruggroote en kwaliteit gehad. ManMaxTM het getoon dat dit ŉ geïnduseerde, visuele Mn tekort kan oorkom, terwyl MagMaxTM onsuksesvol was om die Mg-tekort te oorko...|$|E

A concentration-response design was chosen and results were analyzed using univariate and multivariate approaches. Effects on juvenile proportions were less pronounced and more variable than effects on abundance, but effects in general were species- and chemical-specific, and temporal variations distinct. Esfenvalerate and picoxystrobin appeared to elicit stronger effects than triclosan at laboratory-based ECx values, which is in accordance with our previous laboratory study on Eisenia fetida. The mixture affected abundance and juvenile proportions, but the latter only at high mixture concentrations. Esfenvalerate and picoxystrobin {{appeared to be the}} main drivers for the mixture's toxicity. Species-specific toxicity patterns question the reliability of mixture toxicity predictions derived on E. fetida for field earthworms. Biocide concentrations equaling EC 50 s (reproduction) for E. fetida provoked effects on the field earthworms mainly exceeding 50 %, indicating effect intensification from the laboratory to field as well as the influence of indirect effects produced by species interactions.
