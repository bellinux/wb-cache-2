5|$|Although a {{judicial}} system still existed in Buenos Aires, Rosas removed any independence the courts might have exercised, either by controlling appointments to the judiciary, or by circumventing their authority entirely. He {{would sit in}} judgement over cases, issuing sentences which included fines, service in the army, imprisonment, or execution. The exercise of state terror {{as a tool of}} intimidation was restricted to Rosas himself; his subordinates had no control over it. It was used against specific targets, rather than randomly. Terrorism was orchestrated rather than a product of popular zeal, was targeted <b>for</b> <b>effect</b> rather than indiscriminate. Anarchic demonstrations, vigilantism and disorderliness were antithetical to a regime touting a law and order agenda. Foreigners were exempted from abuses, as were people too poor or inconsequential to serve as effective examples. Victims were selected for their usefulness as tools of intimidation.|$|E
5|$|By the 12th century Middle English {{was fully}} developed, {{integrating}} both Norse and Norman features; {{it continued to}} be spoken until the transition to early Modern English around 1500. Middle English literature includes Geoffrey Chaucer's The Canterbury Tales, and Malory's Le Morte d'Arthur. In the Middle English period the use of regional dialects in writing proliferated, and dialect traits were even used <b>for</b> <b>effect</b> by authors such as Chaucer.|$|E

5|$|In the 1330s, {{when the}} architects of Europe were {{embracing}} the Flamboyant style, English architecture {{moved away from the}} Flowing Decorated in an entirely different and much more sober direction with the reconstruction, in highly modular form, of the choir of the Norman abbey, now cathedral, at Gloucester. The Perpendicular style, which relies on a network of intersecting mullions and transoms rather than on a diversity of richly carved forms <b>for</b> <b>effect,</b> gives an overall impression of great unity, in which the structure of the vast windows of both clerestory and east end are integrated with the arcades below and the vault above. The style proved very adaptable and continued with variations in the naves of Canterbury and Winchester, and in the choir of York.|$|E

5|$|Henry {{was said}} by chroniclers to be good-looking, red-haired, freckled, {{with a large}} head; he had a short, stocky body and was bow-legged from riding. Often he was scruffily dressed. Not as {{reserved}} as his mother Matilda, nor as charming as his father Geoffrey, Henry was famous for his energy and drive. He was also infamous for his piercing stare, bullying, bursts of temper and, on occasion, his sullen refusal to speak at all. Some of these outbursts, however, may have been theatrical and <b>for</b> <b>effect.</b> Henry {{was said to have}} understood a wide range of languages, including English, but spoke only Latin and French. In his youth Henry enjoyed warfare, hunting and other adventurous pursuits; {{as the years went by}} he put increasing energy into judicial and administrative affairs and became more cautious, but throughout his life he was energetic and frequently impulsive.|$|E
5|$|In essence {{this type}} of massed cavalry attack relied almost entirely on {{psychological}} shock <b>for</b> <b>effect.</b> Close artillery support could disrupt infantry squares and allow cavalry to penetrate; at Waterloo, however, co-operation between the French cavalry and artillery was not impressive. The French artillery did not {{get close enough to}} the Anglo-allied infantry in sufficient numbers to be decisive. Artillery fire between charges did produce mounting casualties, but most of this fire was at relatively long range and was often indirect, at targets beyond the ridge. If infantry being attacked held firm in their square defensive formations, and were not panicked, cavalry on their own could do very little damage to them. The French cavalry attacks were repeatedly repelled by the steadfast infantry squares, the harrying fire of British artillery as the French cavalry recoiled down the slopes to regroup, and the decisive countercharges of Wellington's light cavalry regiments, the Dutch heavy cavalry brigade, and the remaining effectives of the Household Cavalry. At least one artillery officer disobeyed Wellington's order to seek shelter in the adjacent squares during the charges. Captain Mercer, who commanded 'G' Troop, Royal Horse Artillery, thought the Brunswick troops {{on either side of him}} so shaky that he kept his battery of six nine-pounders in action against the cavalry throughout, to great effect.|$|E
5|$|The second {{schedule}} commenced in Manali in late March 2014, after Chopra {{finished her}} other film commitments. Before filming, Chopra had to re-train herself to build muscles. Bhansali planned an elaborate schedule for her, which {{would ensure that}} her physicality and agility were suitable enough for the role. While filming a sequence in a marketplace, more than ten thousand people gathered on the sets. Due to limited security arrangements, the crowds became uncontrollable in what was not {{believed to be a}} heavily populated area. When Chopra stepped out of her van, some fans tried to approach her, causing the general loss of control. As a result, the shoot was cancelled and the whole crew had to leave. Filming in Manali continued till early April 2014, before shifting to Dharamsala. While filming fight sequence in Dharamsala, Chopra suffered an eye injury, which the makeup team exaggerated <b>for</b> <b>effect.</b> The filming in Dharamsala continued till 19 April 2014. Cinematographer Keiko Nakahara used a hand-held camera during the shooting of the film. The filming was done in 57 days over the course of two years.|$|E

Also, Edward died on campaign two years after Wallace's execution, not in bed at his home.|$|E

Previous Catholic Church councils had rarely felt the need to pronounce on these matters, unlike Orthodox ones which have often ruled on specific types of images.|$|E

40|$|Objective. To {{evaluate}} {{the quality of}} evidence {{and the strength of}} recommendation for yoga as an ancillary intervention in rheumatic diseases. Methods. Medline/PubMed, Scopus, the Cochrane Library and IndMED were searched through February 2013. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing yoga with control interventions in patients with rheumatic diseases were included. Two authors independently assessed the risk of bias using the Cochrane Back Review Group risk of bias tool. The quality of evidence and the strength of the recom-mendation for or against yoga were graded according to the GRADE recommendations. Results. Eight RCTs with a total of 559 subjects were included; two RCTs had a low risk of bias. In two RCTs on FM syndrome, there was very low evidence <b>for</b> <b>effects</b> on pain and low evidence <b>for</b> <b>effects</b> on disability. In three RCTs on OA, there was very low evidence <b>for</b> <b>effects</b> on pain and disability. Based on two RCTs, very low evidence was found <b>for</b> <b>effects</b> on pain in RA. No evidence <b>for</b> <b>effects</b> on pain was found in one RCT on CTS. No RCT explicitly reported safety data. Conclusion. Based on the results of this review, only weak recommendations can be made for the ancillary use of yoga in the management of FM syndrome, OA and RA at this point...|$|R
25|$|Adolf Hitler {{was greatly}} {{influenced}} by the psychological tactics of warfare the British had employed during WWI, and attributed the defeat of Germany to the effects this propaganda had on the soldiers. He became committed {{to the use of}} mass propaganda to influence the minds of the German population in the decades to come. By calling his movement The Third Reich, he was able to convince many civilians that his cause was not just a fad, but the way of their future. Joseph Goebbels was appointed as Propaganda Minister when Hitler came to power in 1933, and he portrayed Hitler as a messianic figure for the redemption of Germany.

And <b>for</b> <b>effect,</b> they have a solid defence in Ramos and Varane to defend leads.

He wrote over 2,000 stories; he specialised in the short, short story and contributed many of these to the magazines Pan, 20-Story, The Passing Show, John Bull, Illustrated, Everybody's Magazine, John O' London's Weekly, London Opinion, The Humorist, Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine and The Star as well as The Strand Magazine and The Evening News to which he contributed 94 stories.
