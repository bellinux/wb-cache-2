50|$|The gold {{exchange}} standard {{usually does}} not involve the circulation of gold coins. The main feature of the {{gold exchange standard}} {{is that the government}} guarantees a fixed exchange rate to the currency of another country that uses a <b>gold</b> <b>standard</b> (<b>specie</b> or bullion), regardless of what type of notes or coins are used as a means of exchange. This creates a de facto gold standard, where the value of the means of exchange has a fixed external value in terms of gold that is independent of the inherent value of the means of exchange itself.|$|R

5000|$|The British Gold Standard Act 1925 both {{introduced}} the {{gold bullion standard}} and simultaneously repealed the <b>gold</b> <b>specie</b> <b>standard.</b> The new standard ended the circulation of gold specie coins.

John Maynard Keynes, citing deflationary dangers, argued against resumption of the gold standard.|$|E
50|$|In modern times, the British West Indies {{was one of}} {{the first}} regions to adopt a <b>gold</b> <b>specie</b> <b>standard.</b> Following Queen Anne's {{proclamation}} of 1704, the British West Indies gold standard was a de facto gold standard based on the Spanish gold doubloon. In 1717, Sir Isaac Newton, the master of the Royal Mint, established a new mint ratio between silver and gold that had the effect of driving silver out of circulation and putting Britain on a gold standard.|$|E
40|$|According to the {{classical}} view, an economy’s lender of last resort should be its central bank. For brief periods of time, the bank might suspend convertibility {{in order to provide}} the liquidity needed to support the domestic credit market. Recent experience of financial crises demonstrates the conflict between maintaining a fixed exchange rate and serving as a lender of last resort. The lesson of Sweden’s history of crises under {{the classical}} <b>specie</b> <b>standard</b> is that a transitional, capital importing economy has to pay closer attention to the <b>specie</b> <b>standard</b> rules than do capital exporting economies. While the Swedish central bank, for a limited time, could support the credit market within the limits of the <b>specie</b> <b>standard,</b> if the crises persisted support mechanisms other than abandoning convertibility were required. The solution adopted was to import high powered money through loans guaranteed by the Swedish State.

5000|$|In 1834, President Jackson began {{action to}} {{strengthen}} the U.S. economy. His goal was to retire the notes of the Bank of the United States prevalent in society {{at that time and}} to replace them with <b>specie</b> <b>gold.</b> In addition, he realized that the ratio between gold and silver must be adjusted if <b>gold</b> <b>specie</b> was to remain in circulation. At that time, the gold to silver ratio was 15:1 while in Europe, the ratio was 15.5:1. This led to the practice of melting down contemporary U.S. gold coins for profit because there was a slightly higher gold content than the face value. This practice led to significant coin rarities in the Capped Bust series of gold coins minted from 1808-1834. <b>Gold</b> <b>specie</b> fineness was reduced from [...]9167 fine to [...]8992 fine and the gold to silver ratio was increased to 16:1. This action was extremely astute and ensured that the new $2.5 and $5 coins would remain in circulation. These were the first widely circulated gold coins in US history.|$|R

50|$|A formal <b>gold</b> <b>specie</b> <b>standard</b> {{was first}} {{established}} in 1821, when Britain adopted it following {{the introduction of}} the gold sovereign by the new Royal Mint at Tower Hill in 1816. The United Province of Canada in 1853, Newfoundland in 1865, and the United States and Germany (de jure) in 1873 adopted gold. The United States used the eagle as its unit, Germany introduced the new gold mark, while Canada adopted a dual system based on both the American gold eagle and the British gold sovereign.|$|E
50|$|Under the <b>gold</b> <b>specie</b> <b>standard,</b> {{anyone in}} {{possession}} of gold bullion could deposit it at a mint {{where it would be}} processed into gold coins. Less a nominal seigniorage to cover processing costs, the coins would then be paid to the depositor; this was free coinage of gold by definition. The objective of the free silver movement was that the mints should accept and process silver bullion according to the same principle, notwithstanding the fact that the market value of the silver in circulating coins of the United States was substantially less than face value.|$|E
5000|$|Political {{conditions}} {{in the aftermath of}} the Battle of Waterloo in 1815 smoothed informal adoption of the British Pound Sterling in New South Wales with relative ease, such adoption proceeding to expand out to New Zealand and other regions of Oceania in time. Having adopted a successful <b>Gold</b> <b>Specie</b> <b>Standard</b> in 1821, the British Government decided in 1825 to introduce the sterling coinage to all of its colonies as a matter of policy. From the latter half of the 19th century until the outbreak of World War I, a monetary union, based on the British gold sovereign existed in a part of the British Empire which included all of both countries and their dependencies.|$|E
40|$|In {{this essay}} I {{propose that the}} {{adoption}} of the U.

This is because the dollar and all that came with it monetized the modern sector of the U. S. economy and tied the supply of money more closely to the capital market and the provision of credit [...] feats that were not possible in an era when colonial legislatures were unable to credibly commit to controlling paper money emissions. The switch to a <b>specie</b> <b>standard</b> was at the time necessary to promote domestic and international confidence in the nascent financial system, and {{paved the way for the}} long transition to the point when the standard was no longer required. ...|$|R
50|$|A year earlier, in 1933, Executive Order 6102 {{had made}} it a {{criminal}} offense for U.S. citizens to own or trade gold anywhere in the world, with exceptions for some jewelry and collector's coins. These prohibitions were relaxed starting in 1964 - gold certificates were again allowed for private investors on April 24, 1964, although the obligation to pay the certificate holder on demand in <b>gold</b> <b>specie</b> would not be honored. By 1975 Americans could again freely own and trade gold.|$|R

Worse, due to inflation, the Notes were worth only about half what <b>gold</b> <b>specie</b> was worth. Willard sued for relief.|$|R
50|$|This {{sterling}} {{monetary union}} existed throughout {{much the same}} period that the Latin Monetary Union existed, and in both cases, {{the first world war}} was the major factor that signalled the end of the union. In both cases, the union was maintained by virtue of the <b>gold</b> <b>specie</b> <b>standard.</b> During the period of monetary union, a standard issue of sterling coinage, minted at the Royal Mint at Tower Hill London circulated in the United Kingdom, Australia and its dependencies such as Papua New Guinea, New Zealand and its dependencies such as Western Samoa, as well as in Fiji and the British Western Pacific Territories. As regards paper money, banknotes were issued by banks in England, Scotland, Ireland, Australia, and New Zealand.|$|E
5000|$|A full or 100%-reserve gold {{standard}} exists when the monetary authority holds sufficient gold to convert all the circulating representative money into gold at the promised exchange rate. It is {{sometimes referred to}} as the <b>gold</b> <b>specie</b> <b>standard</b> to more easily distinguish it. Opponents of a full standard consider it difficult to implement, saying that the quantity of gold in the world is too small to sustain worldwide economic activity at or near current gold prices; implementation would entail a many-fold increase in the price of gold. Gold standard proponents have said, [...] "Once a money is established, any stock of money becomes compatible with any amount of employment and real income." [...] While prices would necessarily adjust to the supply of gold, the process may involve considerable economic disruption, as was experienced during earlier attempts to maintain {{gold standard}}s.|$|E
50|$|Unlike Australia, in the {{critical}} period between 1914 and the Great depression, New Zealand did not have anything that corresponded to a central bank or a monetary authority. New Zealand's link to the pound sterling was purely through the <b>Gold</b> <b>Specie</b> <b>Standard,</b> and when the <b>Gold</b> <b>Specie</b> <b>Standard</b> was suspended at {{the outbreak of the}} first world war, the linkage was based on nothing other than existing practice. The banks controlled telegraphic transfers between New Zealand and London, and so the exchange rate was entirely in their hands. New Zealand was now effectively on a sterling exchange standard, controlled by the largely Australian trading banks, and this sterling exchange standard became a gold exchange standard for the period between 1925 and 1931 when the United Kingdom was on a gold bullion standard. It wasn't however until the Great depression that the Australian banks created any substantial divergence from the traditional one-to-one parity between the London pound and the New Zealand pound. Australian and New Zealand raw exports to London were badly hit by the depression, and in an attempt to sustain demand, the Australian banks decided to sell the New Zealand pound at a 9% discount, taking the exchange rate to 110 New Zealand pounds to 100 pounds sterling by 1931. As this was new territory in the history of money, the situation became somewhat confused because a state of affairs now existed in which the exchange rate as between Australia and New Zealand was at par and did not correspond to their respective exchange rates with London. By 1933 the situation had settled to a state of affairs in which the New Zealand pound and the Australian pound were both at a 20% discount with respect to the London pound, taking the exchange rate to New Zealand 125 pounds equaling 100 pounds sterling. New Zealand joined the sterling area in 1939 at the outbreak of the second world war and in 1948, the New Zealand pound once again returned to parity with the pound sterling.|$|E
40|$|The <b>specie</b> <b>standard</b> {{that prevailed}} before 1914 was a {{contingent}} rule. Under the rule specie convertibility could be {{suspended in the}} event of a well understood, exogenously produced emergency, such as a war, on the understanding that after the emergency had safely passed convertibility would be restored at the original parity. Market agents would regard successful adherence as evidence of a credible commitment and would allow the authorities access to seigniorage and bond finance at favorable terms. This paper surveys the history of the <b>specie</b> <b>standard</b> as a contingent rule for 21 countries divided into core and peripheral countries. As a comparison we alsobriefly consider the Bretton Woods system and the recent managed floating regime. We offer some evidence on capital flows 1865 to 1914 from England to two countries of recent settlement [...] Argentina and the United States [...] during episodes of both suspension and adherence to convertibility.

40|$|This short {{book does}} not deal solely with bimetallism, in {{contrast}} with what one would expect from the title.

First, it examines why, over the very long run (between 1200 and 1800), <b>specie</b> <b>standards</b> based on <b>gold,</b> silver, or both failed to provide a nominal anchor. Second, it argues that bimetallism was an inescapable stage on the road of monetary progress a road leading to the glittering (if short-lived) gold standard. ...|$|R
50|$|Australia {{returned}} to the gold standard in 1925 {{in conjunction with the}} United Kingdom and South Africa. As {{in the case of the}} United Kingdom, there was no return to a <b>gold</b> <b>specie</b> <b>standard,</b> but rather the introduction of a gold bullion standard. This once again formally locked the pound in Australia to parity with the pound in the United Kingdom. During the period between 1914 and 1925, the telegraphic money transfers between London and Australia had deviated somewhat from parity, but at that time, it was merely seen as a temporary hitch due to the emergency and the suspension of the gold standard. Nobody considered the Australian pound as such to be a separate currency from sterling. However, in 1929 the Great Depression occurred, and the raw producing nations in the southern hemisphere, such as Argentina, Chile, Australia, and New Zealand were the first to feel the effects. The Australian banks that controlled the exchanges with London began to sell the Australian unit at a discount in order to increase the competitiveness of their exports to London. The gold standard in Australia was simultaneously abandoned and the Australian pound was now at a 25% discount to the pound sterling.|$|E
50|$|The British {{victory at}} the Battle of Waterloo in 1815 heralded the {{beginning}} of a new world order in which Britain would be the supreme world power for the next one hundred years. At the time of Waterloo, the British Empire consisted of the new world territories in the West Indies and in North America which had been retained following the loss of the thirteen colonies. In addition to this, there was the penal colony of New South Wales, the Rock of Gibraltar at the entrance to the Mediterranean Sea, and the territories controlled by the British East India Company. Victory in the Napoleonic wars brought spoils to Britain which added more territories such as Malta, British Guiana, and Mauritius to the empire. It was {{the beginning of a}} golden era for Britain, and the new Royal Mint at Tower Hill coined a new gold sovereign in 1817. At the same time, the Spanish Empire was in decline with revolutions underway in the new world. The silver Spanish pieces of eight that had formed the staple international currency for nearly four hundred years were mostly minted at the new world mints at Potosi, Mexico, and Lima. The supplies of these silver dollars were cut off due to revolutionary wars, and since Britain had formally adopted a successful <b>gold</b> <b>specie</b> <b>standard</b> in 1821, the British government decided in 1825 to introduce the sterling coinage to all of its colonies. An imperial order-in-council was issued in order to set ratings for the sterling coinage against the already circulating Spanish and other foreign coins, for the purposes of facilitating the transition to sterling.|$|E

We then present evidence across four regimes (pre- 1914 gold standard; interward gold standard; Bretton Woods; the subsequent managed exchange rate float) for the 21 countries on the stability of macro variables as well as on the demand shocks (reflecting policy actions specific to the regime) and supply shocks (reflecting shocks to the environment independence of the regime). These measures allow us to determine whether adherents to the rule consistently pursued different policy actions from nonadherents, and whether persistent adverse shocks to the environment may, for some countries, have precluded adherence to the rule. ...|$|R

50|$|The silver {{standard}} is a monetary {{system in which}} the standard economic unit of account is a fixed weight of silver. The silver <b>specie</b> <b>standard</b> was widespread from the fall of the Byzantine Empire until the 19th century.

These silver dollar coins played the role of an international trading currency for nearly four hundred years.|$|R
50|$|The Panic of 1837 was a {{detrimental}} blow to James Petigru’s financial affairs. He {{had invested}} heavily in Mississippi’s speculated land market, and the new requirement of <b>gold</b> <b>specie</b> backing forced him to sell, among other items, his land holdings, his rice plantation, {{and most of his}} 137 slaves. Payments to creditors took almost the entirety of his wealth, and left him with only his home and his law office. Because of these dramatic losses Sue’s mother, Jane Amelia, pushed both daughters to marry for wealth. Eldest Caroline was the first daughter to cede, marrying William Carson, a man twice her age, in 1841. Sue followed two years later, marrying Henry Campbell King in 1843.|$|R

Breckinridge convinced them to abandon their scheme after paying them their wages from the treasury, but some of them refused to escort Breckinridge and the bullion any further. Breckinridge's party arrived in Washington on May 4 and, after paying out several requisitions from the treasury, deposited the rest in banks there.

25|$|There was a {{great deal}} of money to be made in this way. The record breaker was the capture of the Spanish frigate Hermione, which was {{carrying}} treasure in 1762.

In January 1807 the frigate Caroline took the Spanish San Rafael which brought in £52,000 for her captain, Peter Rainier (who had been only a Midshipman some thirteen months before).

Boutwell and Grant finally met on Thursday, September 23, and agreed to release gold from the treasury if the gold price kept rising. Grant wanted $5,000,000 in gold to be released while Boutwell wanted $3,000,000 released.

2500|$|At the {{beginning}} of the American Civil War, the Confederate government sought to counter the United States Navy in part by appealing to private enterprise world-wide to engage in privateering against United States shipping. Privateering was the practice of fitting ordinary private merchant vessels with modest armament, then sending them to sea to capture other merchant vessels in return for monetary reward. The captured vessels and cargo fell under customary prize rules at sea. [...] Prizes would be taken to the jurisdiction of a competent court, which could be in the sponsoring country or theoretically in any neutral port. If the court found that the capture was legal, the ship and cargo would be forfeited and sold at a prize auction. The proceeds would be distributed among owners and crew according to a contractual arrangement.
