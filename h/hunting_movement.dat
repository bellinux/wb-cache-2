The dynamic performance of a railway vehicle can be seriously damaged, due to the phenomenon of instability of the hunting motion that occurs when a certain speed is exceeded – the critical one. An important role is played b y the suspension parameters in the extension of the stability interval during hunting motion at high velocities. And this is what the paper draws attention to, based on the analysis of how the elasticity and damping suspension characteristics influence the critical spee...|$|E
40|$|An efficient, smart, {{energy-saving}} automated {{container terminal}} (ACT) scheme is introduced in this paper, {{in which one}} three-dimensional container distribution system is proposed between crane yard and storage yard. In this scheme, container vehicle-low bridge coupled vibration greatly affects the ACT’s structural safety and handling efficiency. Firstly, the coupled vibration time-domain responses, inspired by self-excitation including track irregularity and <b>hunting</b> <b>movement</b> as well as environmental (wind and seismic) load, were obtained by using free-interface component mode synthesis (CMS) method. The relationship of response and vehicle speed, wind velocity and ground motion intensity was studied as well. Accordingly, the structural safety, running safety and stationarity were assessed by indicators such as deflection-span ratio, vibration acceleration, wheel-rail relative displacement, etc. The container vehicle speed limits of the low bridge rigid supported or lead rubber bearing (LRB) supported under seismic and operational wind load were compared. The results of model test and prototype simulation prove with each other, which validates LRB’s effects on vibration isolation and absorption, thus can increase ground motion intensity and vehicle speed thresholds to structural safety...|$|E

40|$|Populist <b>hunting</b> <b>movements</b> {{have risen}} {{in recent years}} to {{safeguard}} rural interests against nature conservation. In extreme cases this movement has been accompanied by the illegal hunting of protected species. Using Sweden and Finland as a case study, the article elucidates how the perceived exclusion of hunters in the public debate on conservation mobilised this subculture toward resistance against regulatory agencies. Establishment of an alternative discursive platform comprising several ruralities - counterpublic in Negt and Kluge's original term - allowed hunters to publicise oppositional needs, interests and rationalities in the debate, and was a key juncture in their radicalisation trajectory. Finally the paper argues that failure to grant recognition to the counterpublic radicalised some individuals beyond counterpublic by engaging in illegal hunting. This practice is marked by the termination of political debate with society and represents a danger to political legitimacy...|$|R

40|$|Behavioral {{effects of}} living under {{predation}} risk may inﬂuence {{the dynamics of}} prey species more than direct demographic effects. Human recreation, especially hunting, can also force prey to increase their vigilance and can inﬂuence distribution and habitat use even more than natural predators. However, behavioral effects do not play {{a prominent role in}} conservation or wildlife management. Whereas the demographic consequences of hunting are documented for large carnivores, behavioral effects of hunting on their dynamics remain unexplored. We studied the movement patterns of brown bears (Ursus arctos) in Scandinavia as a model species, before and after the start of the annual bear hunting season. Bears were expected to become more active at daytime as the season progressed due to shortening daylight. How- ever, the start of hunting disrupted this pattern. Solitary bears subject to <b>hunting</b> increased <b>movements</b> during the dark hours after hunting started, losing their nocturnal rest, probably to compensate for decreased daytime activity. Females with cubs-of-the-year, which are protected from hunting, also mod- iﬁed their movement pattern, but much less than hunted bears. Bears altered their movement pattern at a critical time of the year, during hyperphagia, when they must store fat reserves before hibernation, which is critical for reproduction. Behavioral effects of hunting should be a relevant issue for the conser- vation and management of large carnivores, especially when hunting occurs during highly sensitive peri- ods of the year. This concern applies to many species managed under hunting regimesPeer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|The NAACP’s early successes with {{test-case}} litigation {{created a}} model for using law as a social movement strategy that has since been replicated by advocates for such wide-ranging interest groups as consumers, environmentalists, gays and lesbians, economic libertarians, and the poor. Today, organizations that specialize in planned litigation continue to proliferate, despite critiques from both the political left and right about the efficacy of litigation strategies as tools for social reform (Handler 1978; Horowitz 1977; Rosenberg 1991). Indeed, this proliferation of legal advocacy organizations across movements suggests that litigation must provide some benefits to social movements; otherwise the prevalence of these groups makes neither organizational nor political sense (see Morag-Levine 2001). And, in fact, a growing literature on cause lawyering has identified a litany {{of ways in which}} litigation strategies can benefit social movements.

40|$|AbstractRecreational {{hunters have}} largely {{replaced}} natural predators of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) {{across much of}} North America; thereby, providing the greatest form of risk (both direct and indirect) to survival. On a 1861 -ha property in Oklahoma, USA, we evaluated how controlled <b>hunting</b> influenced <b>movement</b> behaviour (using movement rate [m/h] and relative displacement index [%]) of 37 adult (≥ 2. 5 years) male deer at three risk treatment levels (i. e., control=no risk; low-risk= 1 hunter/ 101 ha; and high-risk= 1 hunter/ 30 ha), two temporal periods of risk (i. e., diurnal [06 : 00 – 18 : 00] and nocturnal [18 : 00 – 06 : 00]), and across time (36 days); time was modelled as a continuous variable that covered five risk exposure periods (risk present or absent in brackets; i. e., pre-season [absent], scout [present], pre-hunt [absent], hunt [present], and post-hunt [absent]). Movement rate (m/h) decreased over time for all risk treatment levels and temporal period of risks; however, the magnitude (i. e., slope) of decrease varied across treatments. The magnitude of decrease in movement rate was similar for control and low risk treatments during diurnal and nocturnal periods, but was different between low and high risk, and high risk and control treatments. Relative displacement (%) of deer was greatest {{at the start of}} the study, decreasing during the study finally resulting in displacement values being three times less after hunting season. Deer responded to the presence of hunters on the landscape by adapting movement strategies both spatially and temporally to avoid potential contact with hunters. During the study, deer reduced movements and used smaller areas more intensively, as indicated by the relative displacement index. Reducing movement or space use may lead to lower detection of deer by hunters, thus increasing the probability of survival through reduced harvest. Understanding deer behavioural responses to hunters (and at different levels of risk) could be used to facilitate or reduce harvest based on population management objectives...|$|R
40|$|Responding only to {{individuals}} of a predator species which display threatening behaviour allows prey species to minimise energy expenditure {{and other costs}} of predator avoidance, such as disruption of feeding. The threat sensitivity hypothesis predicts such behaviour in prey species. If hunted animals are unable to distinguish dangerous humans from non-dangerous humans, human hunting {{is likely to have}} a greater effect on prey populations as all human encounters should lead to predator avoidance, increasing stress and creating opportunity costs for exploited populations. We test the threat sensitivity hypothesis in wild Poeppigi's woolly monkeys (Lagothrix poeppigii) in Yasuní National Park, Ecuador, by presenting human models engaging in one of three behaviours "hunting", "gathering" or "researching". These experiments were conducted at two sites with differing <b>hunting</b> pressures. Visibility, <b>movement</b> and vocalisations were recorded and results from two sites showed that groups changed their behaviours after being exposed to humans, and did so in different ways depending on the behaviour of the human model. Results at the site with higher hunting pressure were consistent with predictions based on the threat sensitivity hypothesis. Although results at the site with lower hunting pressure were not consistent with the results at the site with higher hunting pressure, groups at this site also showed differential responses to different human behaviours. These results provide evidence of threat-sensitive predator avoidance in hunted primates, which may allow them to conserve both time and energy when encountering humans which pose no threat...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{survival}} of captive-bred individuals from release {{into the wild}} to their first breeding season is crucial to assess the success of reintroduction or translocation programmes, and to assess their potential impact of wild populations. However, assessing the {{survival of}} captive-bred individuals following their release is often complicated by immediate dispersal once in the wild. Here, we apply Lindberg's robust design model, a method that incorporates emigration from the study site, to obtain true estimates of survival of captive-bred Mallards Anas platyrhynchos, a common duck species released {{on a large scale}} in Europe since the 1970 s. Overall survival rate from release in July until the onset of the next breeding season in April was low (0. 18 ± 0. 07 se) and equivalent to half the first-year survival of local wild Mallards. Higher overall detectability and temporary emigration during the <b>hunting</b> period revealed <b>movements</b> in response to hunting pressure. Such low survival of released Mallards during their first year may help prevent large-scale genetic mixing with the wild population. Nevertheless, by combining our results with regional waterfowl counts, we estimated that a minimum of 34 % of the Mallards in the region were of captive origin {{at the onset of the}} breeding season. Although most released birds quickly die, restocking for hunting may be of sufficient magnitude to affect the wild population through genetic homogenization or loss of local adaptation. Robust design protocols allow for the estimation of true survival estimates by controlling for permanent and temporary emigration and may require only a moderate increase in fieldwork effort...|$|R
