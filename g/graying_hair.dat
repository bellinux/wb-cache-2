2500|$|Ruppelt {{concluded}} that Adamski was a talented con artist whose UFO stories {{were designed to}} make money from his gullible followers and listeners, and he compared Adamski to the famed hoaxer, carnival, and circus showman PT Barnum. In describing Adamski's speaking style, Ruppelt wrote [...] "to {{look at the man}} and listen to his story you had an immediate urge to believe him...he was dressed in well-worn, but neat, overalls. He had slightly <b>graying</b> <b>hair</b> and the most honest pair of eyes I've ever seen. He spoke softly and naively, almost pathetically, giving the impression that 'most people think I'm crazy, but honestly, I'm really not.'" [...] According to Ruppelt, Adamski had a persuasive effect on his audience, [...] "you could actually have heard the proverbial pin drop" [...] in the restaurant as Adamski told of his initial 1952 meeting with Orthon. When Adamski finished his story, Ruppelt noted that many of his listeners purchased copies of Adamski's UFO photos that were on sale in the restaurant. At another lecture led by Adamski and other well-known contactees, Ruppelt wrote that [...] "people shelled out hard cash to hear Adamski's story." ...|$|E

60|$|Mrs. De Graf sighed. There {{was little}} in common between mother and daughter; but that, to a grave extent, was the woman's fault. She had never tried to {{understand}} her child's complex nature, and somewhat resented Beth's youth and good looks, which she considered contrasted unfavorably with her own deepening wrinkles and <b>graying</b> <b>hair.</b> For Mrs. De Graf was vain and self-important, and still thought herself attractive and even girlish. It would really be a relief to have Beth {{out of the way}} for a few months.|$|E
50|$|Graying is {{a gradual}} process; {{according}} to a study by L'Oreal, while 74% of those between the age of 45 and 74 had <b>gray</b> <b>hair,</b> <b>gray</b> <b>hairs</b> covered only 27% of their head on average, and approximately 1 in 10 people had no <b>gray</b> <b>hairs</b> even after the age of 60.|$|R
40|$|Alopecia areata is an unpredictable, non-scarring {{hair loss}} condition. Patchy {{alopecia}} areata sparing <b>gray</b> <b>hairs</b> is rare. Here we present 4 cases with patchy non-scarring hair loss, which attacked pigmented hairs only and spared <b>gray</b> <b>hairs.</b> It should be differentiated from vitiligo, colocalization of vitiligo and alopecia areata, and depigmented hair regrowth after alopecia areata. Key words: alopecia areata, <b>gray</b> <b>hairs,</b> pigmented hairs...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Melanocyte {{stem cells}} (MelSCs) {{are known to}} be {{depleted}} in <b>gray</b> <b>hair</b> follicles. Hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs) are important for maintenance of stemness of MelSCs. Methods: We compared the proportion of CD 200 + (Cluster of Differentiation 200 positive) stem cells in the outer root sheath cell suspension of <b>gray</b> and pigmented <b>hair</b> follicles of three patients with the premature <b>graying</b> of <b>hair.</b> In addition, explants culture for HFSCs was also carried out from <b>gray</b> and pigmented <b>hair</b> follicles. Cultured HFSCs were also differentiated into melanocytes. Results: The mean ± SD CD 200 + HFSCs population were 9. 4 ± 1. 4 % and 3. 5 ± 0. 5 % for pigmented and <b>gray</b> <b>hair</b> follicles, respectively (P = 0. 002). In explants culture, the growth of HFSCs from the <b>gray</b> <b>hair</b> follicle stopped at around day 20 - 22, whereas the growth of the cells from the pigmented follicle continued. Conclusion: CD 200 + HFSCs are depleted in prematurely <b>gray</b> <b>hair</b> in the humans. CD 200 + hair follicle stem cell yield is poorer in <b>gray</b> <b>hair</b> explant culture than pigmented hair explant culture...|$|R
60|$|In {{those few}} days, I {{perceived}} life without its glamor. I no longer looked upon these toiling {{women with the}} thoughtless eyes of youth. I saw no humor in the bent forms and <b>graying</b> <b>hair</b> of the men. I began to understand that my own mother had trod a similar slavish round with never {{a full day of}} leisure, with scarcely an hour of escape from the tugging hands of children, and the need of mending and washing clothes. I recalled her as she passed from the churn to the stove, from the stove to the bedchamber, and from the bedchamber back to the kitchen, day after day, year after year, rising at daylight or before, and going to her bed only after the evening dishes were washed and the stockings and clothing mended for the night.|$|E
50|$|For centuries, {{people have}} tried to hide <b>graying</b> <b>hair</b> with methods like dyeing, {{coloring}} and henna since gray hair appears most often on older adults and aging is stigmatized in most Western societies. A recent beauty trend has seen women defying stereotypes and opting to leave <b>graying</b> <b>hair</b> natural or purposely gray their hair prematurely.|$|E
50|$|Aging (senescence) {{increases}} {{vulnerability to}} age-associated diseases, whereas genetics determines vulnerability or resistance between species and individuals within species. Some age-related changes (like <b>graying</b> <b>hair)</b> {{are said to}} be unrelated to an increase in mortality. But some biogerontologists believe that the same underlying changes that cause <b>graying</b> <b>hair</b> also increase mortality in other organ systems and that understanding the incidence of age-associated disease will advance knowledge of the biology of senescence just as knowledge of childhood diseases advanced knowledge of human development.|$|E
50|$|Changes in {{hair color}} {{typically}} occur naturally as people age, eventually turning the <b>hair</b> <b>gray</b> and then white. This is called achromotrichia. Achromotrichia normally {{begins in the}} early to mid-twenties in men and late twenties in women. More than 60 percent of Americans have some <b>gray</b> <b>hair</b> by age 40. The age at which graying begins seems almost entirely due to genetics. Sometimes people are born with <b>gray</b> <b>hair</b> because they inherit the trait.|$|R
40|$|Aims and Objectives: To {{determine}} {{the association between}} smoking, chewing tobacco (gutka), and age of individual on <b>graying</b> of <b>hair.</b> Materials and Methods: The present study was conducted on 120 patients attending the Outpatient Department of the DJ College of Dental Sciences and Research, Modinagar, UP. The individuals were classified into four groups (group I, II, III, IV) {{on the basis of}} the form of tobacco use (smoking or chewing). The Pearson correlation coefficient was utilized to find the correlation between the mean percentage of individuals with <b>gray</b> <b>hair,</b> risk multiplication factor (RMF), and age of the individual. Results: Mean percentage of individual with <b>gray</b> <b>hair</b> and RMF (r = 0. 6487) are found to be positively associated. A significant and positive correlation was observed between the age of the individual and the frequency of individuals with <b>gray</b> <b>hair.</b> Conclusion: This study suggests that there is a significant association between tobacco use and aging on <b>graying</b> of <b>hair...</b>|$|R

50|$|According {{to recent}} {{scientific}} studies, {{low levels of}} catalase {{may play a role}} in the graying process of human hair. Hydrogen peroxide is naturally produced by the body and catalase breaks it down. If catalase levels decline, hydrogen peroxide cannot be broken down as well. This allows the hydrogen peroxide to bleach the hair from the inside out. This finding is under investigation in hopes of developing cosmetic treatments for <b>graying</b> <b>hair</b> based on catalase supplements.|$|E
