25|$|A {{site in the}} Crane Brook Valley was {{selected}} to be dammed to create a reservoir which would provide water to the new stretch of canal. Excavations started in the valley floor in 1796 and were used to build earthwork dams along the eastern and western edges of the reservoir. A <b>feeder</b> <b>channel</b> to supply water to the canal was cut through from the eastern dam {{to the top of}} the locks at Ogley Hay 1.5 miles to the south east.|$|E
25|$|The {{reservoir}} {{was constructed}} and opened in 1842 as a feeder for the Manchester Bolton & Bury Canal. The water {{was used to}} top up the canal as water was lost at the bottom end of the canal. Initially, water {{was to have been}} taken from the River Irwell, however local mill owners objected citing a loss of water for their mills so the reservoir was constructed. Today water is still taken from the Irwell at Burrs Country Park and taken by <b>feeder</b> <b>channel</b> to Elton Reservoir which in turn feeds the remains of the canal.|$|E
40|$|Alluvial fans develop at {{the base}} of drainages where <b>feeder</b> <b>channels</b> release their solid load (Blair and McPherson, 2009; Leeder et al., 1998; Har-vey et al., 2005). A classic fan-shape forms where there is a {{well-defined}} topographic apex. Multiple <b>feeder</b> <b>channels,</b> however, often blur the fan-shape resulting in a merged bajada.

50|$|There are two <b>feeder</b> <b>channels,</b> two sluices, and two surplus {{courses for}} the Kapra Lake, this lake {{being part of}} a chain of water bodies, wherein the surplus course of the upper water body flows down into the lower water body.

30|$|The {{second type}} of {{submarine}} fan is basin floor fan. Due to differential subsidence, there was no typical Miocene abyssal plain developed in the Qingdongnan Basin. Conversely, many wide low-lying areas existed from slope toe {{to the center of}} the Ledong and Lingshui sags, making it easy to form stable superposed gravity fluid flow deposits. The basin floor fans have classical fan shapes with several sedimentary units, such as inner fan feeding channel, branch channel, overbank-natural, bank front lobe, and so on. Their <b>feeder</b> <b>channels</b> locate in the slope toe along NW–SE direction. There are two short-straight <b>feeder</b> <b>channels</b> developing successively, which extend about 10  km long and 1  km wide. The ends of channels converge and overlap each other, indicating a stable environment in their depositional center. The seismic profiles present the features of medium-strong amplitude reflection and continuous seismic events, and the V-shaped incisions can be seen on underlying stratums. In addition, a few natural levees are developed on the margin of channels. Drilling results reveal that the fillings in the channels are moderate-coarse sandstone with poorer sorting and box-shaped logs.|$|R

2500|$|In 1840 {{ownership}} of the reservoir passed to Birmingham Canal Navigations after the company acquired the Wyrley and Essington Canal Company. During the mid-19th century the coal deposits beneath the reservoir {{and the surrounding area}} began to be mined on a large scale due to the Industrial Revolution. The landowner of the area, the Marquess of Anglesey planned to open pits near to the reservoir. The Anglesey anch of the Wyrley and Essington Canal was created between 1848 and 1850 and made the existing <b>feeder</b> <b>channel</b> navigable. In 1849 the Marquess opened the Hammerwich Colliery, located adjacent to the Anglesey Branch at the toe of the dam. After barely eight years of operation the colliery last drew coal in January 1857, as it became impossible to work due to the influx of sand and gravel caused by working too close to unconsolidated surface deposits. [...] Many other collieries were opened at this time around the reservoir and continued to be mined into the 20th century.|$|E

It was also supplemented by several <b>feeder</b> <b>channels</b> along its course. The name probably derives from the purity and clarity of the water because it does not chalk significantly. According to a legend repeated by Frontinus, thirsty Roman soldiers asked a young girl for water who directed them to the springs that later supplied the aqueduct; Aqua Virgo was named after her.|$|R

40|$|The {{subsurface}} feeder complexes of mud volcanoes and seepage systems potentially {{provide valuable}} {{information on the}} evolution of seepage dynamics. Ancient seepage systems in outcrops allow for the observation of expulsion features, which are otherwise commonly beyond seismic resolution. In the Maiella hydrocarbon seep area, the evolution of fluid migration through the sedimentary column during the Messinian Salinity Crisis generated distinctive seep-plumbing features, geological responses, and geochemical signatures in the “Brecciated Limestones” unit. The fluid migration pathways evolved from funnel-shaped <b>feeder</b> <b>channels</b> (Flow-mobilized Sediments) into hydrofractured microbial carbonate buildups (Limestone Buildups), and finally into blow-out micropipes in the host sediment (Patchy Limestones), as overpressure dissipated through the plumbing system. The Flow-mobilized Sediments (δ 13 C down to − 24. 5 ‰ PDB- 1) correspond to the highest flow rates in the whole area, whereas the Patchy Limestones (δ 13 C down to − 39. 3 ‰ PDB- 1) correspond to the slowest flow rates within the intrusive zone. The Limestone Buildups show different degrees of hydrofracturing that reflect different flow rates (δ 13 C down to − 27. 5 ‰ PDB- 1). The fluid transport mechanisms evolved from focused venting through neoformed <b>feeder</b> <b>channels,</b> where sediments elutriated from depths were carried out (the sediment-prone response to fluid migration), to high-rate seepage triggering high hydrofracturation in the microbial buildups. While the hydrocarbon-rich fluids contemporaneously triggered authigenic precipitation (the mineral-prone response to fluid migration), progressive upward and lateral flow deceleration resulted in gradually weaker hydrofracturing of the microbial buildups and finally only local cementation in the form of carbonate patches within the host sediments...|$|R
50|$|Average {{rainfall}} in Cholistan is 7.5 to 12.5 centimeters and subsoil {{water is}} brackish. Density population in Cholistan is only 09 persons per square kilometers. Animal population is around 1,200,000 which comprises camels, goats, sheep and cows. Cholistan is home of wildlife. Main source {{of drinking water}} both for human beings and animals, is rain water which is stored in “Tobas” and “Kunds” (water reservoir). Cholistanis constantly move in search of water. The desert on south was once habitable and forts of Derawar, Din Garh, Mauj Garh and Marot were situated {{at the bank of}} the dried up river called Sarswati, Hakra or Chughra.

40|$|Core, {{logging and}} {{high-resolution}} seismic data from ODP Leg 166 {{were used to}} analyse deposits of the Neogene (Miocene±Lower Pliocene) Bahamian outer carbonate ramp. Ramp sediments are cyclic alternations of light- and dark-grey wackestones/packstones with interbedded calciturbidite packages and minor slumps. Cyclicity was driven by high-frequency sea-level changes. Light-grey layers containing shallow-water bioclasts were formed when the ramp exported material, whereas the dark-grey layers are dominantly pelagic. Calciturbidites are arranged into mounded lobes with <b>feeder</b> <b>channels.</b> Internal bedding of the lobes shows a north-directed shingling {{as a result of}} the asymmetrical growth of these bodies. Calciturbidite packages occur below and above sequence boundaries, indicating that turbidite shedding occurred during third-order sea-level highstands and lowstands.

40|$|Mudrock-dominated channel fills {{are common}} {{features}} of the fluvial Palaeogene Willwood Formation of Wyoming. These fills are small, on average 30 m wide and 3 m deep, and they vary from simple plugs to more lithologically complex fills with internal scour surfaces. Some fills preserve plant material, and others show pedogenic modification. All fills are located within metre-thick intervals of weakly pedogenically modified mudstones that surround ribbon sandstones. The intervals have previously been attributed to channel avulsion; the fine-grained channel fills are interpreted as crevasse-splay <b>feeder</b> <b>channels</b> within these avulsion deposits. Variation in fill type, particularly the presence of pedogenic features, appears {{to be related to}} floodplain drainage.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Miocene–Pliocene {{deposits}} {{of the northern}} Norwegian North Sea, quadrant 35, have been analysed on three 3 D seismic surveys, 2 D seismic sections and well logs to interpret the detailed stratigraphy, morphology and facies of regionally defined depositional systems. The interpretations might serve as analogues for subtle stratigraphic hydrocarbon traps in older deposits. A major Miocene channel system, possibly submarine formed, has been mapped. Analyses of the reflection heterogeneity attribute suggest sandy channel-fills and crevasse splays. Time-slices show pronounced Miocene–Pliocene incision close to the Norwegian continental North Sea margin. In a basinward direction mounded fans of high reflection intensity are identified at the mouths of narrow, sinuous <b>feeder</b> <b>channels</b> in the earliest Pliocene depositional sequence. Facies changes through prograding, deltaic systems tracts of the succeeding Pliocene sequence are identified from the reflection intensity attribute and logs.
