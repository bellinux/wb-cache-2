40|$|The primary {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to quantify instantaneous and cumulative spinal loads in orthodontic practice. The study consisted of two parts. The first part of the study included the mailing out of the standardized nordic questionnaire to all orthodontists residing in the province of Alberta, Canada to find out the prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) within the occupation. There was a 56 percent response rate: 32 respondents out of 57 distributed questionnaires. Of the 32 respondents, 19 (59 %) reported low back trouble, 18 (56 %) neck trouble and 15 (47 %) shoulder trouble. The second part of the study included a sample of graduate orthodontic students (n = 9) from the University of Alberta. The subjects were videotaped performing their regular duties and the recorded postures were printed for biomechanical analysis of instantaneous compression and shear loads on the low back and neck. Cumulative loads were calculated from the <b>instantaneous</b> <b>loads.</b> A postural discomfort questionnaire was also administered to the subjects to be completed at four different times during the work day. The results showed the average <b>instantaneous</b> lumbosacral compression <b>loads</b> for males and females to be 1, 383 N and 936 N respectively. The average daily cumulative lumbosacral compression loads for males and females were 16. 2 MNs and 9. 9 MNs respectively. The conclusion arises from the results that <b>instantaneous</b> <b>loads</b> are not indicative of cumulative loads, particularly for the occupation of orthodontistry. Furthermore, prolonged static sitting exerts large cumulative loads on the spine, which is compelling evidence to show and confirm that orthodontic practice is of high risk for MSDs.

40|$|This study {{evaluated}} the inelastic torsional response due to <b>instantaneous</b> <b>load</b> eccentricities. The load eccentricities, which {{caused by the}} motion of the center of mass are time-dependent, even exist for two-way symmetric structures under seismic excitations. The eccentricities and bi-directional horizontal excitations can lead to the torsional motion. The study of the impacts of such a second-order effect (called A-Delta effect) on structural systems and, this effect in combination with the P-Delta effect on structural systems has not been reported in the literature. This study is focused on the investigation of the structural responses under the A-Delta and/or P-Delta effects. For the assessment of inelastic seismic displacement demand and inelastic torsional response of buildings, the structure is represented using idealized one-story model and each lateral load resisting element is modeled using the Bouc-Wen hysteretic model. The governing equations of motion were developed by considering these effects and the structures that are subjected to biaxial excitations. The numerical analyses were carried out by implementing the governing equations in MATLAB. Since the ground motion is uncertain and varies from record-to-record, 123 ground motion records from 11 California seismic events were considered to take into account this record-to-record variability. The results indicate that a slight underestimation of seismic displacement demand is observed, if the <b>instantaneous</b> <b>load</b> eccentricities are ignored, especially for two-way symmetrical systems. On the other hand, when considering both the <b>instantaneous</b> <b>load</b> eccentricities and P-Delta effect, the <b>instantaneous</b> <b>load</b> eccentricities can introduce significant changes on both lateral and torsional displacements, if the stability factor is large...|$|E

The strategy distributes the essential resources by the average loads on the vertices and integrates the fluctuations of the <b>instantaneous</b> <b>loads</b> into the distribution of the extra resources. The fluctuations are calculated with the assumption of unlimited resources, where the calculation is incorporated into the calculation of the average loads without adding to the time complexity.

40|$|By {{incorporating}} the nonlinear variation of a soil’s compressibility and permeability {{during the process}} of consolidation, an analytical solution for the radial consolidation of vertical drains has been developed for a general time-variable loading.

Detailed solutions were further derived for two special loading schemes: multistage loading and preloading– unloading–reloading. The nonlinear consolidation behavior of a vertical drain subjected to these two types of loading schemes was then investigated by a parametric study. The results show that the loading rate, the ratio of the compressibility index to the permeability index (CdCk) and the initial stress state have a significant influence on the consolidation rate. A smaller value of CdCk a larger initial stress, or a fast loading rate always leads to a rapid consolidation rate.

Due to soaking, loading levels up to 50 percent have no effect on further strength reduction. Modulus of rupture increases by 4 percent after 60 days soaking.

The median fraction of total loads discharged with the first 25 % of the total volume ranged from 28 % (theophylline) to 40 % (Total Suspended Solids (TSS)) and loads remained high for the duration of the events. E. coli and TSS loads originated primarily from wastewater (WW) (63 % and 75 %, respectively). However, a mix of stormwater (SW) and sewer deposit (SD) resuspension contributed from 73 to 95 % for the first 50 % of the volume discharged of total TSS loads for 2 events. The contribution of SD resuspension was not negligible for Wastewater Micropollutants (WWMPs), especially for carbamazepine.

The {{aim of this study}} was to quantify <b>instantaneous</b> and cumulative <b>loads</b> on the low back and neck of osteopaths while performing the pre-thrust positioning for a commonly used high velocity, low amplitude (HVLA) thrust technique applied to the thoracic spine. Method: The sample included 8 undergraduate students and 16 graduate students in the osteopathy programme at Unitec New Zealand and two registered osteopaths (male n= 16, female n= 10). Digital still images of operators performing the pre-thrust positioning for a thoracic spine HVLA thrust technique on a variable height table were analysed with motion analysis software. From the observed data, instantaneous compression and shear loads at the L 5 -S 1 and C 7 -T 1 segments were estimated using a static biomechanical model. Estimates of weekly and yearly cumulative compressive and shear loads were calculated based on assumptions from osteopaths’ anecdotal clinical experience. Results: <b>Instantaneous</b> compression <b>loads</b> on the L 5 -S 1 segment ranged from 1023 N to 7575 N and 33 N to 477 N on the C 7 -T 1 segment. <b>Instantaneous</b> shear <b>loads</b> on the L 5 -S 1 segment ranged between 160 N and 829 N and between 18 N and 112 N for the C 7 -T 1 segment. Conclusions: This study found a distinct correlation between body mass and <b>instantaneous</b> lumbosacral spinal <b>loading</b> (Pearson’s r = 0. 96). The magnitude of instantaneous compressive lumbosacral spinal loads in this study were found to be within the range to cause vertebral endplate fracture.
