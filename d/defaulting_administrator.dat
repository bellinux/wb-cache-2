5000|$|... xYzZY {{is used as}} {{the default}} {{boundary}} marker by the Perl HTTP::Message module for multipart MIME messages, and was used in Apple's AtEase for workgroups as the <b>default</b> <b>administrator</b> password in the 1990s.|$|R
50|$|Most {{administration}} of the server is done through a web interface, which runs on the ports 9090 (HTTP) and 9091 (HTTPS) by <b>default.</b> <b>Administrators</b> can connect from anywhere and edit the server and configuration settings.|$|R
50|$|When SmartScreen is left at its <b>default</b> settings, the <b>administrator</b> {{needs to}} launch {{and run the}} program.|$|R
5000|$|... callout, a {{callback}} function {{exposed by}} a filtering driver. The filtering drivers provide filtering capabilities {{other than the}} <b>default</b> block/allow. <b>Administrators</b> specify a callout function during registration of a filter rule. When the filter matches, the system invokes the callout, which handles a specified action.|$|R
50|$|HP ePrint Enterprise can be {{configured}} for guest user access. This enables users {{outside the}} company to remotely print to company devices. Guest users are given access for 30 days by <b>default.</b> An <b>administrator</b> can change the access period to any time value and or revoke access at any time.|$|R
50|$|For a user losing {{access to}} their key, support for {{recovery}} agents that can decrypt files is built into EFS. A Recovery Agent is a user who is authorized by a public key recovery certificate to decrypt files belonging to other users using a special private key. By <b>default,</b> local <b>administrators</b> are recovery agents however they can be customized using Group Policy.|$|R
50|$|Files and folder permissions can {{be edited}} by various tools {{including}} Windows Explorer, WMI, command line tools like Cacls, XCacls, ICacls, SubInACL, the freeware Win32 console FILEACL, the free software utility SetACL, and other utilities. To edit a security descriptor, a user needs WRITE_DAC permissions to the object, a permission {{that is usually}} delegated by <b>default</b> to <b>administrators</b> and the object's owner.|$|R
50|$|Microsoft Windows 2000 and XP, and {{possibly}} other versions, have an account named Guest by default, {{which has no}} password and grants a very basic access to the operating system. Even though it is disabled by <b>default,</b> some <b>administrators</b> may choose to activate it, change the password and disable it once more for good measure. This account cannot be deleted.|$|R
50|$|SSL is {{disabled}} by <b>default,</b> meaning that <b>administrator</b> passwords are sent in clear text.The administrator should to use the builtin functionality to generate a CSR and have it signed by an accepted CA.|$|R
25|$|Since Windows Vista is, by <b>default,</b> a {{computer}} <b>administrator</b> that runs everything under limited user privileges, when a program requires administrative privileges, a User Account Control pop-up will prompt {{the user to}} allow or deny the action. This improves on the design used by previous versions of Windows.|$|R
50|$|Because of its {{elevated}} importance, from Vista onward the winsxs directory {{is owned}} by the Trusted Installer service SID. By <b>default</b> not even <b>administrators</b> can modify its contents (without taking ownership first). Uninstalling applications does not immediately free space in the winsxs directory; space for unused assemblies is garbage-collected over time by the Installer service.|$|R
5000|$|Determine {{the least}} cost paths {{to the root}} bridge. [...] The {{computed}} spanning tree has the property that messages from any connected device to the root bridge traverse a least cost path, i.e., a path from the device to the root that has minimum cost among all paths from the device to the root. The cost of traversing a path {{is the sum of}} the costs of the segments on the path. Different technologies have different <b>default</b> costs. An <b>administrator</b> can configure the cost of traversing a particular network segment. The property that messages always traverse least-cost paths to the root is guaranteed by the following two rules.|$|R
5000|$|Windows XP {{has been}} criticized for its {{vulnerabilities}} due to buffer overflows and its susceptibility to malware such as viruses, trojan horses, and worms. Nicholas Petreley for The Register notes that [...] "Windows XP was the first version of Windows to reflect a serious effort to isolate users from the system, so that users each have their own private files and limited system privileges." [...] However, users by <b>default</b> receive an <b>administrator</b> account that provides unrestricted access to the underpinnings of the system. If the administrator's account is compromised, there is no limit to the control that can be asserted over the PC. Windows XP Home Edition also lacks the ability to administer security policies and denies access to the Local Users and Groups utility.|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} is to get participants thinking about how they can solve problems associated with a dual submission of ETDs. Many institutions choose to archive ETDs in their repositories, but also mandate, insist, or permit ETDs to be submitted to ProQuest via the UMI ETD Administrator. The Administrator offers a no-submission-fee route for ETD inclusion in ProQuest’s ubiquitous subscription databases. At FIU, after deciding on a mandatory ETD Policy in July 2011, we considered moving from a payment/snail mail submission to altogether scrapping submission to ProQuest; however, our librarians made a case for keeping at least an option for ProQuest submission. After consideration of all the options, implementing the UMI ETD Administrator seemed the most logical because it relieves payment, paperwork, and snail mail. Unfortunately, the UMI ETD Administrator creates as many problems as it solves e. g., the dual submission. According to the Berkman Center’s Good Practices for University Open-Access Policies, the university should offer to make additional deposits outside of the institutional repository. Thus, we sought {{to find a way}} for the students to only submit once to our DigitalCommons Institutional Repository. By June 2012, we manually triaged our first batch of ETDs from our DigitalCommons to the UMI ETD Administrator; however, since that first batch we have identified problems with metadata submission, entering student information, and the ETD <b>Administrator</b> <b>default</b> setup. For instance, with our second batch, we eliminated discrepancies with the department field; in our third batch, we eliminated concerns with FERPA and submitting student information; in our fourth batch, we look to cut down the time of each manual submission. Attendees, with institutions considering the ETD Administrator, should expect to anticipate and solve several issues associated with implementing the system in conjunction with an institutional repository. Attendees, who work with both the ETD Administrator and an Institutional Repository, should expect to gain new ideas for eliminating a dual submission for students, a quicker publication turn around, and/or decreased workflow time...|$|R
