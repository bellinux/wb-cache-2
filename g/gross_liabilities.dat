40|$|With the {{commencement}} of Phase III of the European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) in 2013, it is projected that approximately one-half of emission allowances will be acquired through auctioning {{and the provision of}} free allocations to installations will be substantially tightened. As a result, it is likely that many companies will hold purchased (as opposed to freely allocated or gratis) allowances and will have more significant liabilities under the scheme. The accounting treatment of emission allowances has therefore become more relevant and the lack of uniformity in practice that resulted after the withdrawal of IFRIC 3 is now a more pressing concern. This study uses content analysis to examine disclosed accounting policies of companies with significant emission liabilities under the EU ETS and identifies three more common approaches adopted to date. These can be generally described as the following: (i) a net liability approach, based on the classification of allowances as intangibles but only showing an emission liability when it exceeds the free allocation; (ii) an approach broadly based on IFRIC 3 (recognising the free allocation at fair value and a corresponding <b>gross</b> <b>liability</b> under the EU ETS); and (iii) an approach based on inventory classification, with free allocations given at nil value. The diversity in these treatments highlights the need for guidance from the International Accounting Standards Board. 17 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Recent global {{imbalances}} {{and large}} gross external financial movements have raised interest in modeling {{the relationship between}} international financial market structure and capital flows. This paper constructs a model in which the composition of national portfolios is an essential element in facilitating international capital flows. Each country chooses an optimal portfolio in face of real and nominal risk. Current account deficits are financed by net capital flows which reflect differential movements in the holdings of gross external assets and liabilities. A country experiencing a current account deficit will be accumulating both gross external liabilities and gross external assets. Net capital flows generate movements in risk premiums such {{that the rate of}} return on a debtor country's <b>gross</b> <b>liabilities</b> is lower than the return on its gross assets. This ensures stability of the world wealth distribution. An attractive feature of the model is that portfolio shares, returns, and the wealth distribution can be characterized analytically.

40|$|The paper explores what {{information}} on cross-border fund flows between Hong Kong and the Mainland can be extracted from existing statistics on banking transactions. As {{the stock of}} <b>gross</b> <b>liabilities</b> has been larger than claims since mid- 1999, the Mainland remains a net supplier of funds (in terms of both Hong Kong dollar and foreign currency) to the banking system in Hong Kong. Hong Kong ran a current account surplus with the Mainland {{in the past few}} years, thereby contributing to a rise in claims by Hong Kong banks on the Mainland (or a decline in liabilities), assuming that all transactions are effected through the banking system. Separately, Hong Kong was a net investor in the Mainland in terms of direct investment and portfolio investment, implying an increase in liability of Hong Kong banks vis-a-vis the Mainland. Adjusting for the fund flows that were related to current account, direct and portfolio investment activities, Hong Kong banks maintained a net "residual" liability to the Mainland. This residual can be interpreted as unexplained fund flows between the two economies. It appears that placements of funds abroad by the Mainland arising from an accumulation of foreign exchange reserve was likely to be a key reason behind this. Although net Hong Kong dollar liabilities vis-a-vis the Mainland have remained a small proportion of total Hong Kong dollar funding of our banking system, they accounted for {{a significant part of the}} movements of the latter. This can be an important influence on local interest rates and hence monetary conditions. ...|$|E

When looking at <b>gross</b> tax <b>liabilities</b> (incl. employer contributions) and a wider benefit measure that includes tax allowances and tax credits, the correlation coefficient increases notably to - 0.78.

When including employee and employer social insurance contributions, taxation ranges between 32 % of disposable income in Bulgaria to 106 % in Sweden. Obviously, the high taxation levels shown in Figure 1 are also due to the separation of tax schedules, tax allowances and tax credits. Part of the income tax liabilities shown in the blue bars above are returned via tax allowances and tax credits 10. In fact, {{there is a very}} close relationship between taxation levels and the use of tax allowance and tax credit instruments 11. Broadly speaking, countries may be loosely categorised as having either simple and low tax rates systems (Cyprus, Bulgaria) or more complicated higher taxation ones (Denmark, Austria). Essentially, higher initial <b>gross</b> tax <b>liabilities</b> are reduced via tax allowances and tax credits, thus resulting in much lower average tax rates than what the tax schedule alone would suggest.

Problems in the balance sheet either cause a financial crisis that develops into a run on the central bank, or generate a run on the central bank once contingent liabilities exceed reserves and the yield differential moves against domestic assets.

6000|$|When, in 1895, Susan Hayman, {{the married}} Forsyte sister, {{followed}} {{her husband at}} the ludicrously low age of seventy-four, and was cremated, it made strangely little stir among the six old Forsytes left. For this apathy there were three causes. First: the almost surreptitious burial of old Jolyon in 1892 down at Robin Hill--first of the Forsytes to desert the family grave at Highgate. That burial, coming a year after Swithin's entirely proper funeral, had occasioned {{a great deal of}} talk on Forsyte 'Change, the abode of Timothy Forsyte on the Bayswater Road, London, which still collected and radiated family gossip. Opinions ranged from the lamentation of Aunt Juley to the outspoken assertion of Francie that it was 'a jolly good thing to stop all that stuffy Highgate business.' Uncle Jolyon in his later years--indeed, ever since the strange and lamentable affair between his granddaughter June's lover, young Bosinney, and Irene, his nephew Soames Forsyte's wife--had noticeably rapped the family's knuckles; and that way of his own which he had always taken had begun to seem to them a little wayward. The philosophic vein in him, of course, had always been too liable to crop out of the strata of pure Forsyteism, so they were in a way prepared for his interment in a strange spot. But the whole thing was an odd business, and when the contents of his Will became current coin on Forsyte 'Change, a shiver had gone round the clan. Out of his estate (L145,304 <b>gross,</b> with <b>liabilities</b> L35 7s. 4d.) he had actually left L15,000 to [...] "whomever do you think, my dear? To Irene!" [...] that runaway wife of his nephew Soames; Irene, a woman who had almost disgraced the family, and--still more amazing was to him no blood relation. Not out and out, of course; only a life interest--only the income from it! Still, there it was; and old Jolyon's claim to be the perfect Forsyte was ended once for all. That, then, was the first reason why the burial of Susan Hayman--at Woking--made little stir.|$|R
40|$|This paper explores farmers' {{willingness}} to adopt genetically modified (GM) oilseed rape {{prior to its}} commercial release and estimates the 'demand' for the new technology. The analysis is based upon choice experiments with 202 German arable farmers. A multinomial probit estimation reveals that GM attributes such as <b>gross</b> margin, expected <b>liability</b> from cross pollination, or flexibility in returning to conventional oilseed rape significantly affect the likelihood of adoption. Neighbouring farmers' attitudes towards GM cropping {{and a number of}} farmer and farm characteristics were also found to be significant determinants of prospective adoption. Demand simulations suggest that adoption rates are very sensitive to the profit difference between GM and non-GM rape varieties. A monopolistic seed price would substantially reduce demand for the new technology. A monopolistic seed supplier would reap between 45 % and 80 % of the GM rent, and the deadweight loss of the monopoly would range between 15 % and 30 % of that rent. The remaining rent for farmers may be too small to outweigh possible producer price discounts resulting from the costs of segregating GM and non-GM oilseed rape along the supply chain.

30|$|Since direct {{income taxes}} {{are often the}} result of complex {{taxation}} systems, we disaggregate them into three components not {{all of which are}} necessarily present in all countries: tax schedules, tax allowances, and tax credits. Tax allowances and tax credits are so-called fiscal benefits and they may be an important channel through which the tax benefit system directs resources towards households. A tax allowance is any type of deduction from initial taxable income that would lower the effective tax base. This includes social insurance contributions whenever they are deductible from the tax base, as well as any tax bands where the tax rate is zero. A tax credit is any type of non-refundable deduction from the initial tax <b>liability</b> (<b>gross</b> tax). To effect the decomposition we take following approach. First, using EUROMOD, we estimate the gross tax (i.e. before any tax credits) payable in the baseline scenario. We then re-calculate gross tax when all tax allowances in the system (including social insurance contributions when deductible, 0 rate bands etc.) are removed, i.e. set to zero. The difference between the gross taxes calculated in the two scenarios provides a measure of the ‘value’ of tax allowances for each household, i.e. the amount of income each household gains via lower taxes due to the existence of tax allowances. We measure the size of tax schedules as the gross tax that would be payable in the absence of tax allowances. The size of this variable is driven by the tax schedule but also by other elements of the income tax system such as the extent to which various types of incomes are subject to taxation, joint vs. individual taxation, progressivity adjustments etc. In the remainder of the paper we will refer to the tax schedule/taxable base component of the income tax system as “taxes”. Finally, tax credits are the difference between gross and net taxes. Refundable tax credits are treated as benefits and thus included in the benefit concepts, not in tax credits, as explained above.|$|R
40|$|As {{entities}} {{where the}} production process takes place, non financial corporations deserve full attention {{in the analysis of}} the real and financial accounts. However, the examination of the financial behaviour of non financial corporations is traditionally confined to their financing : thus, the Bank’s annual report generally only considers their liabilities. Yet the formation of financial assets by non financial corporations is a significant item of information, in both statistical and economic terms. The total financial assets held by non financial corporations in Belgium are considerable, as they far exceed the total financial assets of households. A study recently revealed the historically high level of financial asset formation by non financial corporations in the main industrialised countries, a factor which could help to explain the relatively low level of long-term interest rates. In recent years, Belgian non financial corporations have formed substantially more financial assets than their counterparts in the euro area. In 2005, the financial assets held by Belgian companies were – partly for that reason – almost double the financial assets, expressed in percentages of GDP, of non financial corporations in the euro area. However, this situation certainly does not indicate any risk aversion on the part of Belgian non financial corporations. In fact the liabilities side of their balance sheets also records growth of new financial liabilities in excess of the figure for non financial corporations in the euro area, so that – in terms of liabilities, too – the outstanding total in Belgium is comparatively much higher than the outstanding total in the euro area. This paradoxical situation of Belgian non financial corporations – the fact that they hold much more substantial assets {{while at the same time}} contracting significantly greater liabilities – is due to the fact that the Belgian non financial corporations sector includes coordination centres and non financial holding companies, i. e. undertakings acting, as it were, as financial intermediaries. If the coordination centres and non financial holding companies are excluded, the overall outstanding total <b>gross</b> assets and <b>liabilities</b> of Belgian non financial corporations reverts to a level very close to the figure for the euro area. Finally, in 2005 Belgian non financial institutions recorded an outstanding total of net liabilities amounting to around 100 p. c. of GDP, i. e. slightly more than the outstanding total for non financial corporations in the euro area. It is also apparent that the exclusion of the coordination centres and non financial holding companies has hardly any effect on Belgium’s net debtor position, confirming that these two types of institutions perform an intermediary function. Although it is not possible to isolate the coordination centres and non financial holding companies in the case of new transactions (flows), there is no reason to think that the effect would be any different : there would be a significant decline in the gross flows of new assets and liabilities, but that would have a negligible influence on the financial balance. That balance is very similar to the one for the euro area. flow of funds, corporate finance...|$|R
