40|$|A small open economy’s optimal {{environmental}} policy is studied {{in a model}} with international capital mobility and local pollution. The country produces traded as well as non-traded goods. Is it in the country’s interest to engage in <b>ecological</b> <b>dumping</b> by choosing generous pollution allowances for the traded-good sector? The answer depends decisively on the policy regime in use. Dumping is not optimal if the country ensures that the implicit rent on pollution is completely appropriated within the country. However, if the implicit factor reward on pollution leaves the country because it accrues to (foreign) owners of mobile capital, the local welfare maximizing government tends to discriminate against the traded-good sector, the opposite of <b>ecological</b> <b>dumping.</b> Copyright Kluwer Academic Publishers 1997 <b>ecological</b> <b>dumping,</b> international trade, {{environmental policy}} instruments, traded and non-traded goods, capital mobility,...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we examine}} the {{discrimination}} of emission taxes between the export and nontradable sectors in a small country. A few articles indicate {{that there should be}} no differentiation of environmental policies between sectors in a small country if the government uses indirect instruments as emission taxes. However, we show that the discrimination of emission taxes may occur in a small country that imposes foreign investment quotas. In particular, the possibility that <b>ecological</b> <b>dumping</b> occurs is higher if export goods are more labor intensive than import goods, as in developing countries. Moreover, in the case where imported goods are most capital intensive, both emission tax rates may be lower than marginal environmental damage, and <b>ecological</b> <b>dumping</b> may occur. It is also shown that easing foreign capital quotas may deteriorate the small countryfs welfare. <b>ecological</b> <b>dumping,</b> emission tax, nontraded goods, international trade, capital movement...|$|E
5|$|Off {{the coast}} of Fort Lauderdale is the Osborne Reef, an {{artificial}} reef made of discarded tires that {{has proven to be}} an <b>ecological</b> disaster. The <b>dumping</b> began in the 1960s, with the intent to provide habitat for fish while disposing of trash from the land. However, in the rugged and corrosive environment of the ocean, nylon straps used to secure the tires wore out, cables rusted, and tires broke free. The tires posed a particular threat after breaking free from their restraints. The tires then migrated shoreward and ran into a living reef tract, washed up on its slope and killed many things in their path. In recent years, thousands of tires have also washed up on nearby beaches, especially during hurricanes. Local authorities are now working to remove the 700,000 tires, in cooperation with the U.S. Army, Navy and Coast Guard.|$|R

40|$|To {{guarantee}} a safe access to harbours, dredging of the maritime access channels is needed. Moreover, shipping channels {{have to be}} adapted to the continuously increasing size of vessels. In some cases, the dredged material is reused for beach nourishments or infrastructure projects, but mostly, it is dumped on offshore dumping sites. The efficiency of a dumping place is determined by economic, physical and <b>ecological</b> criteria: (1) <b>dumping</b> places need to be situated close to the navigation channels; (2) a low recirculation of the dumped material towards the dredging places is aimed at; and (3) a negligible effect on the ecosystem should be ensured. The goal {{of this research is}} providing baseline information on the impact of dumping on the morphology, sedimentology and biology and the adaptation after cessation of dumping. Both the dumping site as its environment have been considered. The investigated dumping site S 1, the largest on the Belgian Continental Shelf, and its surroundings were surveyed with a multibeam echosounder (RV Belgica) providing bathymetrical and backscatter data. Additionally, seabed samples were taken for sedimentological/biological analyses with a box corer, a Reineck corer or Van Veen grab. Finally, chrono-sequential single-beam echosounding was used to investigate the morphodynamic evolution from 1995 until 2002. Generally, the results reveal that on a short- and medium-term, the impact of the dumping of dredged material on the morphology, sedimentology and ecology is drastic, but localised. After the cessation of the disposal of dredged sediments, it seems that the site has restored a morphodynamic equilibrium, both from a morphological, sedimentological point of view, however this is hard to say for the biology (cf. nine stations are devoid of macrobenthos) ...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} fifteen years, the {{connection}} between free trade and the environment {{has been the subject}} of considerable debate. Among other things, it has been proposed that freer trade may harm the environment if it induces national governments to compete by undercutting each others’ environmental standards. We assess this proposition in a federal economy with free movement of capital and goods, but labour that is immobile. Our analysis shows that if the member states are small, firms perfectly competitive and pollution non-transboundary, the national governments’ choice of environmental standards coincide with that of the federal government’s. However, if the third assumption is relaxed, without cooperation, all states choose less strict standards than the federal government, even if pollution is only partially transboundary. If we assume monopolistically instead of perfectly competitive firms, the result that non-cooperative regulations are federally efficient when pollution is non-transboundary holds no longer. Nonetheless, there is nothing to suggest that environmental policy is less strict under non-cooperation than under cooperation. Intuitively, this is because the choice of emission tax by one country imposes a number externalities on the other. These externalities are partly positive and partly negative. Without assigning values to at least one of the model’s parameters, we are not able to say whether the negative or the positive externalities dominate, that is, whether the non-cooperative equilibrium is characterised <b>ecological</b> <b>dumping</b> or not-in-my-back-yard. In the special case of perfectly transboundary pollution, we find that <b>ecological</b> <b>dumping</b> occurs regardless of the choice of values for the model’s other parameters. We contribute to the literature in three ways. First, we show that the existence of pollution that spills from one country into another works in favour of <b>ecological</b> <b>dumping</b> both in perfect and in monopolistic product market competition. Second, we show that for <b>ecological</b> <b>dumping</b> to occur, a priori, pollution must be perfectly transboundary if firms are monopolistically competitive, whereas it suffices that pollution is partially transboundary if firms are perfectly competitive. Third, we show that perfect competition, and the standard results associated with it are obtained as a special case of monopolistic competition when the monopolistically competitive firms’ market power is eliminated.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} effect of foreign direct {{investment}} (FDI) on environmental policy stringency in a two-country model with trade costs, where FDI could be unilateral and bilateral and both governments address local pollution through environmental taxes.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyze the {{connection}} between <b>ecological</b> <b>dumping</b> and environmental capital flight which in the literature is presented in three versions: capital flees in order to ecologically dump, firms flee and thus ecologically dump, and capital flees because governments ecologically dump. We find that 'ecological dumping' describes an ill posed problem: it {{has little to do}} with dumping and need not have any impact on the environment. Looking at the existing literature we find that although 'capital flight' is a misnomer, too, there are real problems dealt with under this heading. Nevertheless, because of their emotive and misleading undertone, we should better give up both notions...|$|E
40|$|Our paper {{discusses}} {{the management of}} global pollution issues in a North-South economic geography model with capital mobility and trading costs. We first show that a unilateral environmental policy adopted by the developed country drives the industrial firms out {{of the region and}} lowers real income. However, the <b>ecological</b> <b>dumping</b> argument has only found partial theoretical support as the Northern larger market still attracts firms. More importantly, the total effect on the environment appears ambiguous: due to multiple interactions at work, globalization can make pollution even worse. These outcomes provide arguments for international cooperation. However, although efficient in reducing global pollution, this second option hurts the South both in terms of industrial relocation and real income...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{environmental policies}} {{in response to}} foreign direct investment (FDI) in a symmetrie two-country setting, where firms' behavior affects government policy decisions. We show that two alternative equilibria with FDI are possible: (i) one with unilateral FDI, where one firm is a multinational firm, and the other firm is a national firm; (ii) and one with bilateral FDI, where both firms become multinational firms. With regard to strategic environmental policies, we show that the country attracting FDI introduces a Pigouvian environmental tax, whereas the country served by the local firm only levies a smaller tax rate. Hence, FDI {{does not lead to}} <b>ecological</b> <b>dumping.</b> With regard to welfare, we show that the impact on welfare is negative for the country hosting the national firm; positive for the country hosting the multinational firm, if FDI is unilateral; and ambiguous, for both countries, if FDI is bilateral.

40|$|Recent {{political}} {{discussions about}} the possible advantages of first-mover behaviour in terms of environmental policy again {{called attention to the}} well-established controversy about the effects of environmental regulation on international competitiveness. Conventional theory claims that the trade-off between regulation and competitiveness will be negative while the revisionist view, also known as the Porter Hypothesis, argues for the opposite. Several previous attempts that analysed this quarrel by means of strategic trade game settings indeed support the former claim and conclude that, to increase a firm’s competitiveness, <b>ecological</b> <b>dumping</b> is the most likely outcome in a Cournot duopoly configuration. However, these results were derived from one period games in which so-called innovation offsets are unlikely to occur. The present paper considers a two-period model that includes an intertemporally growing firm-level knowledge capital. In doing so the accumulation of knowledge is modelled in a unilateral and a bilateral variant. It is shown that for both scenarios in period 1 the domestic government will set a higher emission tax rate compared to its foreign counterpart. Furthermore, we identify conditions for which the domestic tax rate will be set above the Pigouvian level in period 1 in both model variants. first-mover behaviour, Porter Hypothesis, strategic environmental policy, environmental regulation, international competitiveness...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we extend a model by A. Ulph (1997) on the {{relationship}} between free trade agreements, environmental regulation and trade under imperfect competition. Ulph's model focused on the effectiveness of harmonisation policies against <b>ecological</b> <b>dumping.</b> It turned out that harmonised policies are rarely optimal under perfect information, but some rationale for them is granted when asymmetric information between the Commission and national governments is considered. This paper analyses two extensions of that model: transboundary pollution and the inclusion of consumer's surplus. Our interest in these issues rests in their importance for the environmental regulation of the European electricity sector, where imperfect competition can be expected to prevail even after the opening of the Single Market. Allowing for consumers' surplus has a very limited impact on Ulph's conclusions, but considering transboundary pollution has important consequences. Under perfect information, it makes harmonisation a much more attractive option. Under asymmetric information, it affects the governments' incentives to misreport, making them stronger and changing the kind of report the Commission should be wary of, it calls for a much less differentiated treatment of the countries, and makes delegating the regulatory power to the Commission a more attractive option than acting non co-operatively.
