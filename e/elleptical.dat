5000|$|Description : {{found in}} sand from lowtide line to depths up to 50 m; evenly <b>elleptical</b> shell with {{alternating}} darker brown and grayish-brown bands; outer lip and columellar folds are whitish; large spire; ovate columella strongly twisted, with a pointed posterior notch and a rounded base.|$|E
5000|$|The name {{is derived}} from two Greek words kalux, [...] "cup", and stegos, [...] "a {{covering}}", meaning [...] "a covering cup". The stem is creeping over the ground, not winding or hardly winding. The leaves are dark green and reniform. The petioles are ovate or <b>elleptical.</b> The corolla is pink or pale purplish, with 5 white stripes.|$|E
50|$|The SIM-XIV-H {{was a low}} winged {{monoplane}} {{of mixed}} wood and metal construction, with an oval section monocoque fuselage. The wing was braced to the fuselage by steel-tube struts, with the tail also braced. It had a glazed nose, with a gun turret armed with a single machine gun mounted above the nose. The pilot and radio operator/gunner sat in tandem under a long canopy, with the observer also armed with a single machine gun. The rear fuselage was fabric covered, while the moving tail surfaces were metal clad.The <b>elleptical</b> wing was of wooden construction,and was clad in plywood. It was powered by two 240 hp (179 kW) Argus As 10C air-cooled V8 engines driving fixed two-bladed propellers, also designed by engineer Sima MilutinoviÄ‡. Two Alclad floats made by the EDO Corporation were attached to the engine nacelles and fuselage.|$|E
40|$|Slow anastomotic {{function}} {{is a common}} problem {{in the management of}} congenital duodenal obstruction. We describe a simple technique of excision duodenoplasty (ED) that results in a fixed open anastomosis, which facilitates early commencement of feeds and discharge from hospital. A retrospective case-note review (1981 - 2000) was undertaken to compare the results of ED with side-to-side duodenoplasty (SSD) and diamond-shaped anastomosis (DD). The outcome measures were days to commencement of feeds, duration of total parenteral nutrition (TPN), and length of hospital stay. In ED a 1. 0 to 1. 5 -cm <b>elleptical</b> segment of dilated duodenum is excised. A longitudinal incision is made in the smaller distal duodenum. A side-to-side one-layer anastomosis is performed. The wall of the proximal duodenal stump is thick, and excision of the ellipse keeps the anastomosis open by preventing apposition or the opposing walls. This facilitates good drainage across the anastomosis. The time to onset of feeding was longer after SSD (median 7 days) compared to ED (5 days) and DD (5 days). The total duration of TPN was also longer for SSD (9 days) in comparison to ED (7 days) and DD (7 days). Although the duration of hospital stay was more for SSD (18 days) than ED (13 days) and DD (16 days), this difference was not statistically significant. The ED technique thus gives an equally good result as DD and a better result than SSD. It is simple to perform and to teach...|$|E
