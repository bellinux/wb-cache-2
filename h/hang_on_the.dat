25|$|In {{the first}} half of 1799 Blanckmann, in Anacréon, was highly {{successful}} as a privateer. He would <b>hang</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> flanks of convoys, pick of stragglers, and escape before the convoy's escorts could reach him. In one three-day period he captured six large merchantmen. One month later he was again on the prowl.|$|E
25|$|The Sheares Room is {{a private}} dining hall named after Dr. Benjamin Sheares, the second President of Singapore. It {{is used by the}} President and his/her family or, in some cases, the Cabinet. Name cards {{indicating}} the sitting positions of each person are printed and gold-plated by Risis. Besides the unique boat-shaped dining table in the room, seven painted panels depicting the seven presidents and their respective Cabinet members <b>hang</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> right of the room.|$|E

25|$|Desperate to <b>hang</b> <b>on,</b> <b>the</b> {{club was}} keen {{to enlist the}} biggest names and identities in the AFL, and {{recruited}} legendary coach Ron Barassi who helped save the club from extinction while serving them as coach from Round 7, 1993 to 1995. At roughly the same time, Hawthorn legend Dermott Brereton was also recruited, albeit with little on-field impact. On a much brighter side for the Swans, their captain Paul Kelly won the League's highest individual honour, the Brownlow Medal, in 1995.|$|E
25|$|There is, however, no {{consensus}} among scholars about Finberg's suggestion. Simon Keynes and Gale R. Owen object {{that there is}} no sign of royal relatives or connections in Wynflæd's will and Finberg's assumptions about Ælfgifu's family therefore stand on shaky ground. Andrew Wareham is less troubled about this and suggests that different kinship strategies may account for it. Much of the issue of identification also seems to <b>hang</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> number of years by which Wynflæd can plausibly have outlived her daughter. In this light, it is significant that on palaeographical grounds, David Dumville has rejected the conventional date of c. 950 for the will, which he considers “speculative and too early” (and that one Wynflæd was still alive in 967).|$|E
25|$|A stair {{carpet in}} a shade of red {{has been used}} since the {{administration}} of Theodore Roosevelt. During the Kennedy restoration, the carpet was made deeper, more crimson. A mahogany pier table with gilded caryatid supports attributed to New York cabinetmaker Charles-Honoré Lannuier {{is located at the}} bottom of the stair. Portraits of 20th century presidents and first ladies <b>hang</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> walls. An English cut crystal chandelier of the mid-19th century hangs over the first landing. In 1998 Hillary Clinton working with then Curator of the White House Betty Monkman refurbished the Grand Staircase. A new carpet for the Grand Staircase and the Cross Hall was designed incorporating a border of laurel leaves and five pointed stars within a circle, a motif found in Winslow's carved marble Truman era string course entablature and in the balusters of the Grand Staircase. A more vivid red was selected, and several shaded of yellow gold. New swag and jabot drapery in the same red and yellow-gold colors were made for the staircase and Entrance Hall.|$|E

25|$|Compared to filters that <b>hang</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{back of the}} aquarium, canister-style {{external}} filters offer {{a greater}} quantity of filter materials to be used along with {{a greater degree of}} flexibility with respect to filter material choice. Water enters the canister filled with the chosen filter material through an intake pipe {{at the bottom of the}} canister, passes through the material, and is fed back to the aquarium through the return pipe. Water is forced to circulate through the filter by a pump typically installed at the top of the canister. It is important to note that canister filters are sealed, fully flooded systems, meaning that the aquarium, intake pipe, filter interior and the return pipe form a continuous body of water. In this configuration both the intake and return path form two siphons, which precisely counterbalance each other. Under these circumstances, the filter pump does not have to spend any effort to lift the water back to the aquarium, regardless of how high the latter is installed above the canister. The pump should only be powerful enough to push the water through the filtering material as well as overcome the drag in the intake and return pipes. This makes canister filter pumps virtually insensitive to the height difference between the aquarium and the filter (although exceeding the manufacturer-specified height limit can lead to leaks).|$|E
25|$|Another ambitious {{restoration}} effort {{began in}} 2004, when Conservancy staff and contractors {{worked together to}} refurbish the 15,876 Minton tiles that <b>hang</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ceiling of the Bethesda Arcade. Originally designed by Calvert Vaux and Jacob Wrey Mould, {{the ceiling of the}} Arcade is lined by 15,876 elaborately patterned encaustic tiles. Made by Minton and Company, a leading 19th-century ceramic manufacturer in England, the ceiling tiles are divided into 49 panels, each containing 324 tiles. Salt and water infiltration from the roadway above had badly damaged the tiles, leaving their backing plates so corroded they had to be removed in the 1980s. The tiles sat in storage for more than 20 years until the Conservancy received a generous private donation for their restoration. The Conservancy embarked on a $7 million restoration effort to return the Minton tiles to their original luster in 2004. A team of seven conservation technicians cleaned and repaired more than 14,000 original tiles by hand. Only three panels of replica tiles were needed to replace those that had been damaged beyond repair. For those recreations, the Conservancy decided to commission Maw and Company, Minton's successor in Stoke-on-Trent, England. The completed Bethesda Terrace Arcade was unveiled to much fanfare in March 2007. In 2006, the Conservancy completed a nine-month renovation of the Mall in a project that returned the landscape to its original character and ensured the protection of its great American Elms.|$|E
25|$|The {{painting}} Louis XIII Comes of Age {{represents the}} historical {{scene of the}} transferring of power from mother to son in abstract, or allegorical means. Marie has reigned as regent during her son's youth, and now she has handed the rudder of the ship to Louis, the new king of France. The ship represents the state, now in operation as Louis steers the vessel. Each of the rowers can be identified by the emblematic shields that <b>hang</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> side of the ship. The second rower's shield depicts a flaming altar with four sphinxes, a coiling serpent and an open eye that looks downwards. These characteristics {{are known to be}} that of Piety or Religion, both of which Maria would want her son to embody. What is also known as a parade boat, Rubens referencing Horace's boat, is adorned with a dragon on front and dolphins on the stern. Louis looks upwards to his mother for guidance on how to steer the ship of state. In the violent clouds are two Fames, one with a Roman buccina and the second with {{what seems to be a}} trumpet. Louis guides, while the ship's actual movement is due to the four rowing figures, personifying Force, Religion, Justice, and Concord. The figure adjusting the sail is thought to be Prudence or Temperance. At the center in front of the mast stands France, with a flame in her right hand illustrating steadfastness and the globe of the realm, or the orb of government, in her left. Force, extending her oar and heaving to, is identified by the shield just beneath her showing a lion and column. She is paired with Marie by the color of their hair, and similarly Louis is paired with Religion, or the Order of the Holy Spirit.|$|E

500|$|Burges died in 1881 after {{catching}} a severe chill during a site {{visit to the}} castle. His brother-in-law, the architect Richard Pullan, took over the commission and delegated {{most of the work}} to Frame, who directed the work on the interior until its completion in 1891. Bute and his wife Gwendolen were consulted over the details of the interior decoration; replica family portraits based on those at Cardiff were commissioned to <b>hang</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> walls. Clark approved of the result, commenting in 1884 that the restoration was in [...] "excellent taste". An oratory originally built {{on the roof of the}} Well Tower was removed before 1891 but in other respects the completed castle was left unaltered.|$|E
500|$|Wootton Hall is {{the grand}} hall {{entrance}} {{on the central}} south side of Althorp house. [...] "Perfectly proportioned" [...] with a two-storey high ceiling, it was cited by Sir Nikolaus Pevsner as [...] "the noblest Georgian room in the county". It {{takes its name from}} the painter John Wootton who was commissioned by the family in 1733 to paint a number of massive paintings in his Marylebone studio to reflect the family's love of equestrian pursuits, particularly fox hunting. At the time, Wootton was considered to be the finest painter of horses in the country. The paintings still <b>hang</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> walls. The hall has a substantial collection of artefacts collected over the years. Aside from the hall porter's chair, there is a dozen or so lavish-looking hall chairs, one of which is a sedan chair, rediscovered in the Stable Block in 1911, which had once been in Spencer House.|$|E

500|$|The most {{expensive}} wines made from Riesling are late harvest dessert wines, produced by letting the grapes <b>hang</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> vines well past normal picking time. Through evaporation {{caused by the}} fungus Botrytis cinerea ("noble rot") or by freezing, {{as in the case}} of ice wine (in German, Eiswein), water is removed and the resulting wine is felt to offer richer layers on the palate. These concentrated wines have more sugar (in extreme cases hundreds of grams per litre), more acid (to give balance to the sugar), more flavour, and more complexity. These elements combine to make wines which are amongst the most long lived of all white wines. The beneficial use of [...] "noble rot" [...] in Riesling grapes was discovered in the late 18th century at Schloss Johannisberg. Permission from the Abbey of Fulda (which owned the vineyard) to start picking Riesling grapes arrived too late and the grapes had begun to rot; yet it turned out that the wine made from them was still of excellent quality.|$|E
500|$|The {{television}} {{show that the}} Simpson family watches {{at the beginning of}} the episode, in which the two reviewers discuss the latest McBain film, is a parody of the American television series Siskel & Ebert & the Movies. In the flashback sequence, Homer is seen singing along to the 1973 song [...] "The Joker" [...] by the Steve Miller Band while driving to school. Pink Floyd and Led Zeppelin posters <b>hang</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> wall of Homer's 1974 bedroom. The 1970 song [...] "(They Long to Be) Close to You" [...] by The Carpenters is heard when Homer sees Marge for the first time. Homer eats a bucket of Shakespeare Fried Chicken when he reveals his feelings towards Marge to Grampa. At the debate, Homer disagrees about the idea of lowering the United States national speed limit to 55mph (90km/h), arguing that [...] "Sure, it'll save a few lives, but millions will be late!" [...] This is a reference to the National Maximum Speed Law provision of the 1974 Emergency Highway Energy Conservation Act that prohibited speed limits higher than 55mph. Barney asks a girl named Estelle if she wants to go to the prom with him, but she tells him that she would not go to the prom with him even if he were American actor Elliott Gould. Artie says he can think of a dozen highly cogent arguments to why Marge should accept his prom offer, one of which is from a Time magazine titled [...] "America's Love Affair with the Prom: Even wallflowers can look forward to one date a year," [...] a reference to the American magazine Time. Songs played in the episode include [...] "The Streak" [...] by Ray Stevens , [...] "Goodbye Yellow Brick Road" [...] by Elton John, [...] "Colour My World" [...] by Chicago, [...] "Pick Up the Pieces" [...] by Average White Band, and [...] "The Hustle" [...] by Van McCoy.|$|E
