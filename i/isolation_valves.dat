2500|$|In the United States, Title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 50, Appendix A, General Design Criteria (GDC 54-57) or {{some other}} design basis {{provides}} the basic design criteria for isolation of lines penetrating the containment wall. Each large pipe penetrating the containment, such as the steam lines, has <b>isolation</b> <b>valves</b> on it, configured as allowed by Appendix A; generally two valves. [...] For smaller lines, one {{on the inside and}} one on the outside. For large, high-pressure lines, space for relief valves and maintenance considerations cause the designers to install the <b>isolation</b> <b>valves</b> near to where the lines exit containment. In the event of a leak in the high-pressure piping that carries the reactor coolant, these valves rapidly close to prevent radioactivity from escaping the containment. Valves on lines for standby systems penetrating containment are normally closed. [...] The containment <b>isolation</b> <b>valves</b> may also close on a variety of other signals such as the containment high pressure experienced during a high-energy line break (e.g. main steam or feedwater lines). [...] The containment building serves to contain the steam/resultant pressure, but there is typically no radiological consequences associated with such a break at a pressurized water reactor.|$|E
2500|$|Containment {{buildings}} in the U.S. are subjected to mandatory testing of the containment and containment isolation provisions under 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix J. [...] Containment Integrated Leakage Rate Tests (Type [...] "A" [...] tests or CILRTs) are performed on a 15-year basis. [...] Local Leakage Rate Tests (Type B or Type C testing, or LLRTs) are performed much more frequently , both to identify the possible leakage in an accident and to locate and fix leakage paths. [...] LLRTs are performed on containment <b>isolation</b> <b>valves,</b> hatches and other appurtenances penetrating the containment. [...] A nuclear plant is required by its operating license to prove containment integrity prior to restarting the reactor after each shutdown. [...] The requirement can be met with satisfactory local or integrated test results (or {{a combination of both}} when an ILRT is performed).|$|E
2500|$|During normal operation, the {{containment}} is air-tight and access is only through marine style airlocks. High air temperature and {{radiation from the}} core limit the time, measured in minutes, people can spend inside containment while the plant is operating at full power. In {{the event of a}} worst-case emergency, called a [...] "design basis accident" [...] in NRC regulations, {{the containment}} is designed to seal off and contain a meltdown. Redundant systems are installed to prevent a meltdown, but as a matter of policy, one is assumed to occur and thus the requirement for a containment building. For design purposes, the reactor vessel's piping is assumed to be breached, causing a [...] "LOCA" [...] (loss Of coolant accident) where the water in the reactor vessel is released to the atmosphere inside the containment and flashes into steam. The resulting pressure increase inside the containment, which is designed to withstand the pressure, triggers containment sprays ("dousing sprays") to turn on to condense the steam and thus reduce the pressure. A SCRAM ("neutronic trip") initiates very shortly after the break occurs. The safety systems close non-essential lines into the air-tight containment by shutting the <b>isolation</b> <b>valves.</b> Emergency Core Cooling Systems are quickly turned on to cool the fuel and prevent it from melting. The exact sequence of events depends on the reactor design.|$|E

2500|$|At the time, reactor-plant {{operating}} procedures precluded a rapid reactor restart following a scram, {{or even the}} ability to use steam remaining in the secondary system to [...] "drive" [...] the submarine to the surface. After a scram, standard procedure was to isolate the main steam system, cutting off the flow of steam to the turbines providing propulsion and electricity. This was done to prevent an over-rapid cool-down of the reactor. Threshers Reactor Control Officer, Lieutenant Raymond McCoole, was not at his station in the maneuvering room, or indeed on the boat, during the fatal dive. McCoole was at home caring for his wife who had been injured in a household accidentâ€”he had been all but ordered ashore by a sympathetic Commander Harvey. McCoole's trainee, Jim Henry, fresh from nuclear power school, probably followed standard {{operating procedures}} and gave the order to isolate the steam system after the scram, even though Thresher was at or slightly below its maximum depth. Once closed, the large steam system <b>isolation</b> <b>valves</b> could not be reopened quickly. Reflecting on the situation in later life, McCoole was sure he would have delayed shutting the valves, thus allowing the boat to [...] "answer bells" [...] and drive itself to the surface, despite the flooding in the engineering spaces. Admiral Rickover later changed the procedure, creating the [...] "Fast Recovery Startup" [...] procedure. The Fast Recovery Startup allows an immediate reactor restart and for steam to be withdrawn from the secondary system in limited quantities for several minutes following a scram.|$|E
5000|$|In complex {{plants with}} {{multiple}} fluid systems, many interconnecting units holding fluids have <b>isolation</b> <b>valves</b> between them. If {{there is a}} leak in a unit, its <b>isolation</b> <b>valves</b> can be shut to [...] "isolate" [...] the unit {{from the rest of}} the plant.|$|E

50|$|<b>Isolation</b> <b>valves</b> {{are used}} to {{temporarily}} disconnect part of a piping system, to allow maintenance or repair, for example. <b>Isolation</b> <b>valves</b> are typically left in either a fully open or fully closed position. A given isolation valve may be in place for many years without being operated, but must be designed to be readily operable whenever needed, including emergency use.|$|E
50|$|To easily {{understand}} the concept of an isolation valve, one can think of the valves under a kitchen or bathroom sink in a typical household. These valves are normally left open so that the user can control the flow of water with the spigot above the sink, and does not need to reach under the counter to start or stop the water flow. However, if the spigot needs to be replaced (i.e. maintenance needs to take place on the system), the <b>isolation</b> <b>valves</b> are shut to stop the flow of water when the spigot is removed. In this system, the <b>isolation</b> <b>valves</b> and the spigot may even be the same type of valve. However, due to their function they are classified as the <b>isolation</b> <b>valves</b> and, {{in the case of the}} spigot, the control valves.|$|E

50|$|The {{manifold}} {{is usually}} machined {{from a high}} grade brass alloy, and chromium-plated for corrosion resistance and appearance.

25|$|A {{manifolded}} {{twin set}} with <b>isolation</b> <b>valve</b> {{is a special}} case. It is a redundant air supply when the <b>isolation</b> <b>valve</b> is closed, as the cylinders are then for most practical purposes independent, but not when it is open, as a leak will eventually drain both cylinders. Divers who intend {{to rely on a}} manifolded twin for bailout {{need to be able to}} isolate the cylinders quickly, as a major leak can drain a set in quite a short time. In comparison with independent twins, the manifolded set is less task loading through the most of the dive, but requires skilled and immediate reaction in the event of a catastrophic failure, as it does not fail safe. If diving as part of a team, the risk is mitigated by the presence of buddies who can help.|$|R
