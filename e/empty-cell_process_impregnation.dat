2500|$|Two later {{methods for}} creosoting wood were {{introduced}} {{after the turn}} of the century, referred to as <b>empty-cell</b> <b>processes,</b> because they involve compressing the air inside the wood so that the preservative can only coat the inner cell walls rather than saturating the interior cell voids.

40|$|The {{manufacturing}} process of high voltage power transformers consists of several phases such as design, assembly, drying and <b>impregnation</b> <b>process</b> which are time consuming. Before electrical testing, a transformer needs an extra standing time for further impregnation of cellulose material in particular those of high density. It {{should be noted}} that the duration of the standing time depends on the ratings of the transformer. The main reason for considering this standing time is to reduce the probability of failure during electrical testing. This means that the reduction of such standing time is a crucial issue. Therefore, the main goal of this thesis is to optimize the post <b>impregnation</b> <b>process</b> of high density cellulosic material. One of the requirements for shortening the post impregnation standing time is that during the electrical tests of the transformer the PD level should not exceed the PD acceptance given by IEC standard level. In this thesis, it is investigated if the standing time is related to the occurrence of partial discharges in high density materials. This is done by performing a number of partial discharge measurement on different samples. Further on, tan? measurements were performed on different samples in the course of <b>impregnation</b> <b>process</b> to investigate whether the losses decrease in the course of time. In this research, the <b>impregnation</b> <b>processes</b> of two different cellulosic materials, namely transformerboard (PSP) an laminated wood (KP) are studied.
