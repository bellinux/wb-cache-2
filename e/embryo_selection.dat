Pronuclear and nucleolar characteristics have been proposed as an indicator of embryo development and chromosomal complement in humans, providing information about embryo viability. Methods To correlate the zygote-score with the maternal age and the outcome of pregnancy, we analyzed the pronuclear and nucleolar morphology, the polar body alignment and the zygote configuration in 459 clinical pregnancies obtained by IVF and ICSI in our public clinic in Reggio Emilia, Italy. We derived odds ratios (OR) and Corenfield's 95 % confidence intervals (CI). Continuous variables were compared with Student's t-test; P lower than. 05 was considered statistically significant. Results We observed a significant increase of "A" pronuclear morphology configuration in 38 - 41 years old patients in comparison to that lower than or equal to 32 years old and a significant decrease of "B" configuration in 38 - 41 years old patients in comparison to that lower than or equal to 32 and in comparison to that of 33 - 37 years old.

Today, it is preferable to transfer one <b>embryo</b> and therefore <b>selection</b> methods are continually improving and {{we are looking for}} the most suitable parameters for <b>selection.</b> <b>Embryo</b> quality can be judged from many methods. The oldest and most widely used is the classic morphological rating. Another evaluation method is based on the metabolic activity of the embryo during the cultivation, the disadvantage of this method is the cost. Genetic testing as preimplantation genetic diagnosis and preimplantation genetic screening are also costly and invasive, therefore may damage the embryo and due to mosaicism, also is not 100 % effective. Combining morphological and kinetic evaluation provides a non-invasive method of time-lapse monitoring. Embryos are assessed by morphological characters and also on the timing and synchrony cleavage. The aim of the study is to compare the statistical results of car Sanus Pardubice, if morphokinetic method (PrimoVision,Cryo-Innovation,Hungary) help improve the IVF results compared to the classic morphological method of assessing the quality of embryos for two years using the system.

40|$|When one {{considers}} the recognized 'causes' of infertility, problems with gamete quality and availability rank highly, as does the means of their transport, whether it be through the fallopian tubes in the female or vas deferens in the male. Conception {{is seen as the}} primary goal, and fertility therapies are currently focused on helping couples achieve this. In around 25 % of couples with fertility problems, medical investigation reveals no such clear cause. It is now understood however, that while a couple may succeed in conception, implantation failure may be the underlying reason for their difficulties in achieving a pregnancy (Macklon et al., 2002). Implantations depend on the succesful interaction between the embryo and the endometrium of the uterus. Since the earliest days of in vitro fertilization (IVF) the focus of attention has been the embryo. In order to obtain multiple <b>embryos</b> to allow <b>selection</b> for transfer to the uterus, complex ovarian stimulation regimens have been devised which result in many oocytes being harvested for fertilization. In most women, these stimulation regimens succefully achieve this aim. Yet despite the ability to produce large numbers of <b>embryos</b> for <b>selection</b> for transfer, pregnancy rates from IVF remain around 25 % per started cycle (ESHRE 2008). Once the embryo is transferred into the uterus, it must interact with the endometrium, and in the majority of treatment cycles, this is the moment in which failure occurs. The role played by the endometrium as a determinant factor of fertility treatment, and in particular IVF outcomes remains unclear. Moreover, the impact of ovarian stimulation on endometrial quality is only now beginning to be elucidated. In this introductory chapter, the hormonal control of endometrial development is reviewed, and current approaches for assessing the receptivity of the endometrium to the embryo are critically assessed (Chapter 1. 1. 1). The concept of the 'implantation window' is introduced (Chapter 1. 1. 2) and the molecular regulation of endometrial maturation and implantation is reviewed (Chapter 1. 2), with emphasis on the most important of the described markers of receptivity (Chapter 1. 3). The challenges of studying the impact of ovarian stimulation on endometrium are described (Chapter 1. 4) as a prelude to introducing a novel means of addressing these by studying endometrial secretion fluid (Chapter 1. 5). These considerations lead to the defining of the objectives of the research described in this thesis (Chapter 1. 6) ...|$|R
40|$|Controlled slow {{freezing}} and vitrification {{have been successfully}} used for ovine <b>embryo</b> cryopreservation. <b>Selection</b> of <b>embryos</b> for transfer is based on stereomicroscopical embryo scoring after thawing, but the subjectivity inherent to this selection step has been demonstrated by ultrastructural studies of controlled slow frozen, in vivo produced ovine morulae and blastocysts. These {{studies have shown that}} certain abnormalities remain undetected by stereomicroscopy only. In the present study, using ovine in vivo produced morulae and blastocysts, we have studied the ultrastructural alterations induced by open pulled straw vitrification (OPS) and controlled {{slow freezing}}, compared stereomicroscopical embryo scoring with light microscopy evaluation of embryo's semithin sections, and related the ultrastructural cellular damage with the embryo classification by stereomicroscopical embryo scoring of embryos' and semithin section evaluation by light microscopy. The ultrastructural lesions found for OPS-vitrified and controlled slow frozen embryos were similar, independently of embryo stage. A significant higher number of grade 3 embryos was found at stereomicroscopical scoring after controlled slow freezing (P = 0. 02), and a significant higher number of grade 3 blastocysts was found at semithin sectioning after OPS vitrification (P = 0. 037). The extension of ultrastructural damage, especially of mitochondria and cytoskeleton, was related to the semithin classification but not to stereomicroscopical scoring at thawing. This suggests that semithin scoring is a useful tool for predicting ultrastructural lesions and new improvements in cryopreservation and thawing methods of ovine embryos are still warranted, including in the case of blastocysts cryopreserved by OPS vitrification...|$|R

The pIG 121 Hm- Cs plasmid was confirmed via PCR analysis using specific primers of npt II and hpt genes and resulted 700 bp and 500 bp for fragments of npt II and hpt, respectively. After selection, acclimatization and molecular analysis steps, the efficiency levels of transformation of four maize lines were low, ranging from 3. 8 % to 12. 8 %.

O sucesso da criopreservação de embriões bovinos é essencial para melhor aproveitamento de embriões produzidos em excesso, para o estabelecimento de bancos de germoplasma e para comercialização de genética. Neste estudo, foi analisada a alteração na expressão de genes induzida pelo procedimento de vitrificação por Cryotop em blastocistos bovinos usando lâminas de microarranjo EmbryoGENE. Embriões bovinos produzidos {{in vitro}} em estágio de blastocisto (144 a 156 horas pós-inseminação) foram vitrificados com Cryotop e não vitrificados (controle). Após 4 horas de cultivo, embriões que re-expandiram ou evoluíram para o estágio de blastocisto expandido foram usados para análises do microarranjo e para quantificação em reação de cadeia de polimerase em tempo real (qPCR). As análises da expressão global revelaram 43 genes diferencialmente expressos em embriões vitrificados comparados aos do grupo controle (p 0, 05), afeta a produção de blastocistos e também a resposta à criopreservação (p< 0, 05). E ainda, que os touros que produzem embriões mais crioresistentes nem sempre são os que produzem maior taxa de embriões PIV. Além disso, embriões macho e fêmea têm a mesma capacidade de resposta à vitrificação por Cryotop. The {{cryopreservation}} success of bovine embryos {{is essential for}} the better use of excess produced embryos, for the establishment of germplasm banks and genetics commercialization. In this study, gene expression alteration induced by the Cryotop vitrification procedure in bovine blastocysts using EmbryoGENE microarray slides was analyzed. Bovine in vitro produced embryos at blastocyst stage (144 to 156 hours postinsemination) were vitrified with Cryotop and non-vitrified (control). After 4 hours of culture, re-expanded or expanded blastocyst stage embryos were submitted to microarray analyzes and real time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) quantification. Global gene expression analysis revealed 43 differentially expressed genes in vitrified embryos compared to control group (p < 0. 05). Nine genes in total were evaluated by qPCR, of which FOSL 1, involved in apoptosis process, showed differential expression (p < 0. 05) for both methods, being overexpressed in vitrified embryos. The results suggest that apoptosis {{plays a key role in}} embryos response of vitrification process. Considering that vitrification response is closely related to embryo quality, it was hypothesized that <b>embryos</b> <b>selection</b> for vitrification could also influence the difference in male:female ratio due to developmental speed and stress tolerance. Therefore, in the second stage of this study, the bull´s influence on embryo developmental kinetics and embryo response to cryopreservation was evaluated. For this, five bulls were taken and embryos cryopreservation by Cryotop method was compared in addition to embryo production. Initially, blastocyst stage embryos were vitrified (144 to 156 hours post-insemination), to evaluate the cryotolerance relative to the bulls; while expanded blastocyst stage embryos were removed from culture at D 6, D 7 and D 8, then sexed for developmental kinetics. As a second experiment, expanded blastocyst stage embryos were vitrified (168 hours post-insemination). All embryos (re-expanded, hatched blastocyst stage e, and degenerated) of both treatments, with 24 hours post-vitrification culture were used for sexing. The results suggest that sire´s choice, although not interfering in embryonic development kinetics, affects the blastocysts rates and the cryopreservation response. Besides, bulls producing more cryoresistent embryos are not always the ones that produce the highest IVP embryo rate. In addition, male and female embryos have the same Cryotop vitrification response...|$|R
