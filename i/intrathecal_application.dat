40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the effects of}} <b>intrathecal</b> <b>application</b> of GABAA- or GABAB-receptor agonists on detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia (DSD) in spinal cord transection (SCT) rats. Adult female Sprague-Dawley rats were used. At 4 wk after Th 9 - 10 SCT, simultaneous recordings of intravesical pressure and urethral pressure were performed under an awake condition to {{examine the effect of}} <b>intrathecal</b> <b>application</b> of GABAA and GABAB agonists (muscimol and baclofen, respectively) or GABAA and GABAB antagonists (bicuculline and saclofen, respectively) at the level of L 6 -S 1 spinal cord. In spinal-intact rats, the effects of bicuculline and saclofen on bladder and urethral activity were also examined. During urethral pressure measurements, DSD characterized by urethral pressure increases during isovolumetric bladder contractions were observed in 95 % of SCT rats. However, after <b>intrathecal</b> <b>application</b> of muscimol or baclofen, urethral pressure showed urethral relaxation during isovolumetric bladder contractions. The effective dose to induce inhibition of urethral activity was lower compared with the dose that inhibited bladder contractions. The effect of muscimol and baclofen was antagonized by intrathecal bicuculline and saclofen, respectively. In spinal-intact rats, <b>intrathecal</b> <b>application</b> of bicuculline induced DSD-like changes. These results indicate that GABAA- and GABAB-receptor activation in the spinal cord exerts the inhibitory effects on DSD after SCT. Decreased activation of GABAA receptors due to hypofunction of GABAergic mechanisms in the spinal cord might be responsible, at least in part, for the development of DSD after SCT...|$|E
40|$|Apart from {{potential}} roles in anti-tumor surveillance, the TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) has important regulatory {{functions in the}} host immune response. We studied antiinflammatory effects of endogenous and recombinant TRAIL (rTRAIL) in experimental meningitis. Following <b>intrathecal</b> <b>application</b> of pneumococcal cell wall, a TLR 2 ligand, we found prolonged inflammation, augmented clinical impairment, and increased apoptosis in the hippocampus of TRAIL–/– mice. Administration of rTRAIL into the subarachnoid space of TRAIL–/– mice or reconstitution of hematopoiesis with wild-type bone marrow cells reversed these effects, suggesting an autoregulatory role of TRAIL within the infiltrating leukocyte population. Importantly, <b>intrathecal</b> <b>application</b> of rTRAIL in wild-type mice with meningitis also decreased inflammation and apoptosis. Moreover, patients suffering from bacterial meningitis showed increased intrathecal synthesis of TRAIL. Our findings provide what we believe is the first evidence that TRAIL may act as a negative regulator of acute CNS inflammation. The ability of TRAIL to modify inflammatory responses and to reduce neuronal cell death in meningitis suggests {{that it may be}} used as a novel antiinflammatory agent in invasive infections...|$|E
40|$|SummaryBackgroundChronic {{established}} pain, {{especially that}} following nerve injury, {{is difficult to}} treat and represents a largely unmet therapeutic need. New insights are urgently required, and we reasoned that endogenous processes such as cooling-induced analgesia may point the way to novel strategies for intervention. Molecular receptors for cooling {{have been identified in}} sensory nerves, and we demonstrate here how activation of one of these, TRPM 8, produces profound, mechanistically novel analgesia in chronic pain states. ResultsWe show that activation of TRPM 8 in a subpopulation of sensory afferents (by either cutaneous or <b>intrathecal</b> <b>application</b> of specific pharmacological agents or by modest cooling) elicits analgesia in neuropathic and other chronic pain models in rats, thereby inhibiting the characteristic sensitization of dorsal-horn neurons and behavioral-reflex facilitation. TRPM 8 expression was increased in a subset of sensory neurons after nerve injury. The essential role of TRPM 8 in suppression of sensitized pain responses was corroborated by specific knockdown of its expression after <b>intrathecal</b> <b>application</b> of an antisense oligonucleotide. We further show that the analgesic effect of TRPM 8 activation is centrally mediated and relies on Group II/III metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs), but not opioid receptors. We propose a scheme in which Group II/III mGluRs would respond to glutamate released from TRPM 8 -containing afferents to exert an inhibitory gate control over nociceptive inputs. ConclusionsTRPM 8 and its central downstream mediators, as elements of endogenous-cooling-induced analgesia, represent a novel analgesic axis that can be exploited in chronic sensitized pain states...|$|E
40|$|Diabetic neuropathic pain (DNP) {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{clinical}} manifestations of diabetes mellitus (DM), which is characterized by prominent mechanical allodynia (DMA). However, the molecular mechanism underlying it has not fully been elucidated. In this study, we examined the spatio-temporal expression of a major nociceptive channel protein transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV 1) and analyzed its functional involvement by <b>intrathecal</b> (i. t.) <b>application</b> of TRPV 1 antagonists in streptozocin (STZ) -induced DMA rat models. Western blot and immunofluorescent staining results showed that TRPV 1 protein level was significantly increased in the soma of the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons on 14 days after STZ treatment (DMA 14 d), whereas those in spinal cord and skin (mainly from the central and peripheral processes of DRG neurons) had already been enhanced on DMA 7 d to peak on DMA 14 d. qRT-PCR experiments confirmed that TRPV 1 mRNA level was significantly up-regulated in the DRG on DMA 7 d, indicating a preceding translation of TRPV 1 protein in the soma but preferential distribution of this protein to the processes under the DMA conditions. Cell counting assay based on double immunostaining suggested that increased TRPV 1 -immunoreactive neurons were likely to be small-sized and CGRP-ergic. Finally, single or multiple <b>intrathecal</b> <b>applications</b> of non-specific or specific TRPV 1 antagonists, ruthenium red and capsazepine, at varying doses, effectively alleviated DMA, although the effect of the former was more prominent and long-lasting.

We intrathecally injected in sterile saline dissolved TCA six times within three weeks on a regular basis every third day in 161 hospitalized primary and predominant secondary progressive MS patients with spinal symptoms. The MS patients did not experience an acute onset of exacerbation or recent distinct increased progression of symptoms. We simultaneously scored the MS patients with the EDSS and the Barthel index, estimated the walking distance and measured somatosensory evoked potentials.

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the effect of}} duloxetine, a norepinephrine (NE) and serotonin (5 -HT) reuptake inhibitor, on the neurally evoked urethral continence reflex induced by sneezing in rats. To clarify the role of noradrenergic and serotonergic mechanisms in preventing stress urinary incontinence (SUI) during sneezing, we examined the effect of duloxetine followed by intrathecal (it) methiothepin maleate (5 -HT receptor and α 1 -adrenoceptor antagonist) or terazosin or idazoxan (selective α 1 - and α 2 -adrenoceptor antagonists, respectively). Amplitude of urethral pressure responses during sneezing (A-URS), urethral baseline pressure (UBP) at the midurethra, and sneeze-induced leak point pressure (S-LPP) were measured in normal adult female rats and rats with SUI induced by vaginal distension (VD). In normal and VD rats, intravenous application of duloxetine (1 mg/kg) increased A-URS by 35 % and 34 % and UBP by 21 % and 34 %, respectively. Sneezing-induced fluid leakage from the urethral orifice was observed in VD rats but not in normal rats. S-LPP was increased from 39. 1 to 92. 2 cmH 2 O by intravenous duloxetine in incontinent VD rats. Duloxetine-mediated enhancement of A-URS was inhibited by terazosin but not methiothepin maleate (it). In addition, simultaneous <b>intrathecal</b> <b>application</b> of methiothepin and terazosin induced a reduction in A-URS during sneezing, which was not increased by intravenous duloxetine. However, the reduced A-URS after <b>intrathecal</b> <b>application</b> of methiothepin and terazosin returned to the control level when duloxetine (iv) was applied after intrathecal idazoxan administration. These results indicate that duloxetine can prevent SUI by facilitating noradrenergic and serotonergic systems in the spinal cord to enhance the sneeze-induced active urethral closure mechanism...|$|E
40|$|The role of {{neuronal}} {{nitric oxide}} synthase (nNOS) in the central mechanism of neuropathic pain and long-term potentiation (LTP) of peripheral afferents remains obscure. The current study investigated the effect of <b>intrathecal</b> <b>application</b> of 7 -nitroindazole (7 -NI), a selective nNOS inhibitor (8. 15 µg/ 5 µl), on mechanical allodynia on day 14 after L 5 spinal nerve tran-section. Furthermore, using in vivo single unit extracellular recording, we examined the effect of 7 -NI on the induction of LTP of Aδ- and C-fiber-evoked responses.

40|$|The enzyme chondroitinase ABC has {{recently}} been suggested for use in chemonucleolysis.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Malignant {{lymphoma}} of {{the prostate}} is rare. In the literature, about 165 cases with either a primary lymphoma {{of the prostate}} or secondary infiltration of the prostate by a lymphoma are described. CASE REPORT: The case of a 59 -year-old patient with an irregular tumor in the prostatic region, but normal prostate-specific antigen (PSA), a fracture in the vertebral column and a bilateral enlargement of the suprarenal glands is presented. Repetitive prostate biopsy revealed the diagnosis of a diffuse large B cell lymphoma. Further staging examinations gave hints to an epidural infiltration. A polychemotherapy including <b>intrathecal</b> drug <b>applications</b> was initiated. Staging after four therapeutic cycles already showed good partial remission of all lymphoma manifestations. After two further therapeutic cycles, a CT scan showed a small rest of prostatic bulk, but PET-CT did not detect vital lymphatic tissue (complete remission). CONCLUSION: In cases of irregular prostatic enlargements, carcinoma has to be considered as the most frequent diagnosis. Nevertheless, also a solitary lymphoma or infiltration of the prostate by a systemic lymphoma {{has to be taken}} into account, especially if the PSA value is in the normal range...|$|R
40|$|<b>Intrathecal</b> <b>application</b> of μ, δ, and κ opioids {{attenuate}} {{responses on}} several tests of animal nociception. However, {{the potency of}} these opioids differ depending on which tests were used. One factor contributing to these discrepancies is that different types of noxious stimuli activate different sets of nociceptor types, which may be differentially sensitive to opiate inhibition. To examine this hypothesis, we used a recently developed behavioural test which allows for differential assessment of nociception evoked by the activation of myelinated (Aδ) and unmyelinated C thermonociceptors. Administration of a κ-selective agonist was ineffective on either type of response. δ 1 drugs were slightly more potent on C fibre-mediated responses than on Aδ-mediated responses. Intrathecal μ and δ 2 drugs were antinociceptive on both Aδ and C nociceptor-mediated responses. However, unlike the δ 1 effects, the dose-response curves for μ and δ 2 drugs were significantly more steep for Aδ than for C fibre-mediated responses, potentially indicating differences in the mechanisms by which the drugs act on these 2 response types...|$|E
40|$|Visceral pain, {{especially}} in the abdominal region, {{represents one of the}} most common types of pain. Its chronic form is usually very hard to treat by conventional analgesic agents and adjuvants. We investigated the antinociceptive effect of botulinum toxin type A (BTX-A) in male Wistar rats in two models of visceral pain: peritonitis induced by intraperitoneal injection of 1 % acetic acid and colitis induced by intracolonic instillation of 0. 1 % capsaicin. Pain was measured as the number of abdominal writhes. Additionally, referred mechanical sensitivity in the ventral abdominal area was evaluated by von Frey test and the extent of spinal c-Fos expression was immunohistochemically examined. BTX-A significantly reduced the number of abdominal writhes in both models of visceral pain after <b>intrathecal</b> <b>application</b> in a dose of 2 U/kg. In the experimental colitis model, BTX-A (2 U/kg) reduced both referred mechanical allodynia and c-Fos expression in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord (S 2 /S 3 segments).

40|$|Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is {{the most}} common {{malignancy}} in childhood. It represents a group of clinically and biologically heterogenous malignancies that can be subclasified into several subtypes according to the presence of recurrent genetic aberrations.

40|$|Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorders (NMOSD) are {{associated}} with autoantibodies (ABs) targeting the astrocytic aquaporin- 4 water channels (AQP 4 -ABs).

In a recently-established animal model, chronic intrathecal passive-transfer of immunoglobulin G from NMOSD patients (NMO-IgG), or of recombinant human AQP 4 -ABs (rAB-AQP 4), provided evidence for complementary and immune-cell independent effects of AQP 4 -ABs. Utilizing this animal model, we here tested the effects of systemically and intrathecally applied pooled human immunoglobulins (IVIg) using a preventive and a therapeutic paradigm. In NMO-IgG animals, prophylactic application of systemic IVIg led to a reduced median disease score of 2. 4 on a 0 – 10 scale, in comparison to 4. 1 with sham treatment. Therapeutic IVIg, applied systemically after the 10 th intrathecal NMO-IgG injection, significantly reduced the disease score by 0. 8. <b>Intrathecal</b> IVIg <b>application</b> induced a beneficial effect in animals with NMO-IgG (median score IVIg 1. 6 vs. sham 3. 7) or with rAB-AQP 4 (median score IVIg 2. 0 vs. sham 3. 7).

The primary objective {{of this study was}} to identify spinal CSF leaks in young patients, after formulating the hypothesis that spinal CSF leaks are causally related to CSDH. METHODS All consecutive patients 60 years of age or younger who underwent operations for CSDH between September 2009 and April 2011 at Bern University Hospital were included in this prospective cohort study. The patient workup included an extended search for a spinal CSF leak using a systematic algorithm: MRI of the spinal axis with or without <b>intrathecal</b> contrast <b>application,</b> myelography/fluoroscopy, and postmyelography CT. Spinal pathologies were classified according to direct proof of CSF outflow from the intrathecal to the extrathecal space, presence of extrathecal fluid accumulation, presence of spinal meningeal cysts, or no pathological findings. The primary outcome was proof of a CSF leak. RESULTS Twenty-seven patients, with a mean age of 49. 6 ± 9. 2 years, underwent operations for CSDH. Hematomas were unilateral in 20 patients and bilateral in 7 patients. In 7 (25. 9 %) of 27 patients, spinal CSF leakage was proven, in 9 patients (33. 3 %) spinal meningeal cysts in the cervicothoracic region were found, and 3 patients (11. 1 %) had spinal cysts in the sacral region. The remaining 8 patients (29. 6 %) showed no pathological findings.

40|$|Abstract Early onset torsion {{dystonia}} (EOTD) {{is a rare}} {{movement disorder}} characterized by involuntary, repetitive, sustained muscle contractions or postures involving one or more sites of the body. A US study estimated the prevalence at approximately 1 in 30, 000. The estimated prevalence {{in the general population}} of Europe seems to be lower, ranging from 1 in 330, 000 to 1 in 200, 000, although precise numbers are currently not available. The estimated prevalence in the Ashkenazi Jewish population is approximately five to ten times higher, due to a founder mutation. Symptoms of EOTD typically develop first in an arm or leg in middle to late childhood and progress in approximately 30 % of patients to other body regions (generalized dystonia) within about five years. Distribution and severity of symptoms vary widely between affected individuals. The majority of cases from various ethnic groups are caused by an autosomal dominantly inherited deletion of 3 bp (GAG) in the DYT 1 gene on chromosome 9 q 34. This gene encodes a protein named torsinA, which is presumed to act as a chaperone protein associated with the endoplasmic reticulum and the nuclear envelope. It may interact with the dopamine transporter and participate in intracellular trafficking, although its precise function within the cell remains to be determined. Molecular genetic diagnostic and genetic counseling is recommended for individuals with age of onset below 26 years, and may also be considered in those with onset after 26 years having a relative with typical early onset dystonia. Treatment options include botulinum toxin injections for focal symptoms, pharmacological therapy such as anticholinergics (most commonly trihexiphenydil) for generalized dystonia and surgical approaches such as deep brain stimulation of the internal globus pallidus or <b>intrathecal</b> baclofen <b>application</b> in severe cases. All patients have normal cognitive function, and despite a high rate of generalization of dystonia, 75 % of those patients are able to maintain ambulation and independence, and therefore a comparatively good quality of life, with modern treatment modalities. </p...|$|R
40|$|Naked mole-rats are {{extremely}} unusual among mammals in that their cutaneous C-fibers lack the neuropeptide Substance P (SP). In other mammals, SP {{plays an important}} role in nociception: it is released from C-fibers onto spinal neurons where it facilitates NMDA receptor activity and causes sensitization that can last for minutes, hours or days. In the present study, we tested the effects of <b>intrathecal</b> <b>application</b> of: 1) SP, 2) an SP antagonist (GR- 82334), and 3) an NMDA antagonist (APV) on heat-evoked foot withdrawal. In the naked mole-rat, at a high enough concentration, application of SP caused a large, immediate, and long-lasting sensitization of foot withdrawal latency that was transiently reversed by application of either antagonist. However, neither SP nor NMDA antagonists had an effect when administered alone to naïve animals. In contrast, both antagonists induced an increase in basal withdrawal latency in mice. These results indicate that spinal neurons in naked mole-rats have functional SP and NMDA receptors, but that these receptors do not participate in heat-evoked foot withdrawal unless SP is experimentally introduced. We propose that the natural lack of SP in naked mole-rat C-fibers may have resulted during adaptation to living in a chronically high carbon dioxide, high ammonia environment that, in othe...|$|E

CONCLUSION: VGF expression is therefore highly modulated in nociceptive pathways following peripheral nerve injury and can cause dorsal horn cell excitation and behavioral hypersensitivity in naïve animals. Together the results point to a novel and powerful role for VGF in neuropathic pain...|$|E
40|$|Background It {{has been}} {{recently}} {{demonstrated that the}} ghrelin receptor agonist, HM 01, caused defecation in rats that were treated to provide {{a model for the}} constipation of Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 s disease. HM 01 significantly increased fecal output and increased Fos activity in neurons of the hypothalamus and hindbrain, but not in the spinal defecation center. Other ghrelin agonists act on the defecation center. Methods Receptor pharmacology was examined in ghrelin receptor (GHSR 1 a) transfected cells. Anesthetized rats were used to investigate sites and mechanisms of action. Key Results HM 01 activated rat GHSR 1 a at nanomolar concentrations and was antagonized by the GHSR 1 a antagonist, YIL 781. HM 01, intravenous, was potent to activate propulsive colorectal contractions. This was prevented by pelvic nerve section and by intravenous YIL 781, but not by spinal cord section rostral to the defecation centers. Direct <b>intrathecal</b> <b>application</b> of HM 01 to the defecation center at spinal level L 6 -S 1 initiated propulsive contractions of the colorectum. Conclusions & Inferences HM 01 stimulates GHSR 1 a receptors on neurons in the lumbosacral defecation centers to cause propulsive contractions and emptying of the colorectum. It has greater potency when given systemically, compared with other GHSR 1 a agonists...|$|E
40|$|Following {{spinal cord}} injury (SCI) neurons caudal to the injury are capable of rhythmic locomotor-related {{activity}} that can {{form the basis for}} substantial functional recovery of stepping despite the loss of crucial brain stem-derived neuromodulators like serotonin (5 -HT). Here we investigated the contribution of constitutive 5 -HT 2 receptor activity (activity in the absence of 5 -HT) to locomotion after SCI. We used a staggered hemisection injury model in rats to study this because these rats showed a robust recovery of locomotor function and yet a loss of most descending axons. Immunolabeling for 5 -HT showed little remaining 5 -HT below the injury, and locomotor ability was not correlated with the amount of residual 5 -HT. Furthermore, blocking 5 -HT 2 receptors with an <b>intrathecal</b> (IT) <b>application</b> of the neutral antagonist SB 242084 did not affect locomotion (locomotor score and kinematics were unaffected), further indicating that residual 5 -HT below the injury did not contribute to generation of locomotion. As a positive control, we found that the same application of SB 242084 completely antagonized the muscle activity induced by exogenous application of the 5 -HT 2 receptor agonists alpha-methyl- 5 -HT (IT). In contrast, blocking constitutive 5 -HT 2 receptor activity with the potent inverse agonist SB 206553 (IT) severely impaired stepping as assessed with kinematic recordings, eliminating most hindlimb weight support and overall reducing the locomotor score in both hind legs. However, even in the most severely impaired animals, rhythmic sweeping movements of the hindlimb feet were still visible during forelimb locomotion, suggesting that SB 206553 did not completely eliminate locomotor drive to the motoneurons or motoneuron excitability. The same application of SB 206553 had no affect on stepping in normal rats. Thus while normal rats can compensate for loss of 5 -HT 2 receptor activity, after severe {{spinal cord injury}} rats require constitutive activity in these 5 -HT 2 receptors to produce locomotion...|$|R
40|$|Early onset torsion {{dystonia}} (EOTD) {{is a rare}} {{movement disorder}} characterized by involuntary, repetitive, sustained muscle contractions or postures involving one or more sites of the body. A US study estimated the prevalence at approximately 1 in 30, 000. The estimated prevalence {{in the general population}} of Europe seems to be lower, ranging from 1 in 330, 000 to 1 in 200, 000, although precise numbers are currently not available. The estimated prevalence in the Ashkenazi Jewish population is approximately five to ten times higher, due to a founder mutation. Symptoms of EOTD typically develop first in an arm or leg in middle to late childhood and progress in approximately 30 % of patients to other body regions (generalized dystonia) within about five years. Distribution and severity of symptoms vary widely between affected individuals. The majority of cases from various ethnic groups are caused by an autosomal dominantly inherited deletion of 3 bp (GAG) in the DYT 1 gene on chromosome 9 q 34. This gene encodes a protein named torsinA, which is presumed to act as a chaperone protein associated with the endoplasmic reticulum and the nuclear envelope. It may interact with the dopamine transporter and participate in intracellular trafficking, although its precise function within the cell remains to be determined. Molecular genetic diagnostic and genetic counseling is recommended for individuals with age of onset below 26 years, and may also be considered in those with onset after 26 years having a relative with typical early onset dystonia. Treatment options include botulinum toxin injections for focal symptoms, pharmacological therapy such as anticholinergics (most commonly trihexiphenydil) for generalized dystonia and surgical approaches such as deep brain stimulation of the internal globus pallidus or <b>intrathecal</b> baclofen <b>application</b> in severe cases. All patients have normal cognitive function, and despite a high rate of generalization of dystonia, 75 % of those patients are able to maintain ambulation and independence, and therefore a comparatively good quality of life, with modern treatment modalities...|$|R
40|$|To {{clarify the}} role of spinal serotonergic {{mechanisms}} in preventing stress urinary incontinence (SUI) during sneezing, we investigated the effect of <b>intrathecal</b> (it) <b>application</b> of 8 -OH-DPAT (a 5 -HT 1 A agonist), mCPP (a 5 -HT 2 B/ 2 C agonist), and fluoxetine (a serotonin reuptake inhibitor) using a rat model that can examine the neurally evoked continence reflex during sneezing. Amplitudes of urethral pressure responses during sneezing (A-URS), urethral baseline pressure (UBP) at the midurethra, and sneeze-induced leak point pressure (S-LPP) were measured in normal female adult rats and rats with SUI induced by vaginal distention (VD). In normal rats, 8 -OH-DPAT decreased A-URS by 48. 9 %, whereas mCPP increased A-URS by 33. 6 %. However, A-URS was not changed after fluoxetine. 8 -OH-DPAT, mCPP, or fluoxetine did not alter UBP. The effect of 8 -OH-DPAT and mCPP was antagonized by WAY- 100635 (it), a selective 5 -HT 1 A antagonist, and RS- 102221 (it), a selective 5 -HT 2 C antagonist, respectively. Fluoxetine {{in the presence of}} WAY- 100635 did not change either A-URS or UBP, but fluoxetine in the presence of RS- 102221 decreased A-URS. In VD rats, S-LPP was decreased by 14. 6 cmH 2 O after 8 -OH-DPAT, whereas it was increased by 12. 8 cmH 2 O after mCPP. However, S-LPP was not changed after fluoxetine. These results indicate that activation of 5 -HT 2 C receptors enhances the active urethral closure reflex during sneezing at the spinal level, whereas 5 -HT 1 A inhibits it and that no apparent changes in the sneeze-induced continence reflex after fluoxetine treatment are due to coactivation of excitatory 5 -HT 2 C receptors and inhibitory 5 -HT receptors other than the 5 -HT 1 A subtype. Thus, activation of excitatory 5 -HT receptor subtypes such as 5 -HT 2 C could be effective for the treatment of SUI...|$|R
40|$|Altered pain sensations such as {{hyperalgesia}} and allodynia {{are characteristic}} features of various chronic pain states, and remain difficult to treat. We have shown previously that spinal application of dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP 4) enzyme inhibitors {{results in a}} strong antihyperalgesic effect during inflammatory pain states. In this study we observed {{a low level of}} mRNA for DPP 4 in the rat spinal dorsal horn in physiological conditions, which did not change significantly either in carrageenan-induced inflammatory or partial nerve ligation-generated neuropathic states. Although DPP 4 protein was detected in neurons, astrocytes and microglia in naïve animals its expression significantly increased in astrocytes during inflammation and in microglia in neuropathic conditions. <b>Intrathecal</b> <b>application</b> of two DPP 4 inhibitors the tripeptide isoleucin-prolin-isoleucin (IPI) and the antidiabetic drug vildagliptin resulted in robust opioid-dependent antihyperalgesic effect during inflammation and an opioid-independent effect in the Seltzer model. The opioid-mediated antihyperalgesic effect of IPI was exclusively related to mu-opioid receptors, while vildagliptin affected mainly delta-receptor activity, although mu- and kappa-receptors were also involved. Our results suggest a pathology and glia type specific changes of the DPP 4 activity in the spinal cord which contributes to the development and maintenance of hyperalgesia and shapes opioid signalling...|$|E
40|$|In contrast-enhanced (CE) MR myelography, hyperintense signal {{outside the}} {{intrathecal}} space in T 1 -weighted sequences with spectral presaturation inversion recovery (SPIR) is usually {{considered to be}} due to CSF leakage. We retrospectively investigated a hyperintense signal at the apex of the lung appearing in this sequence in patients with SIH (n = 5), CSF rhinorrhoea (n = 2), lumbar spine surgery (n = 1) and in control subjects (n = 6). <b>Intrathecal</b> <b>application</b> of contrast agent was performed in all patients before MR examination, but not in the control group. The reproducible signal increase was investigated with other fat suppression techniques and MR spectroscopy. All patients and controls showed strongly hyperintense signal at the apex of the lungs imitating CSF leakage into paraspinal tissue. This signal increase was identified as an artefact, caused by spectroscopically proven shift and broadening of water and lipid resonances (1 - 2 ppm) in this anatomical region. Only patients with SIH showed additional focal enhancement along the spinal nerve roots and/or in the spinal epidural space. In conclusion CE MR myelography with spectral selective fat suppression shows a reproducible cervicothoracic artefact, imitating CSF leakage. Selective water excitation technique as well as periradicular and epidural contrast collections may be helpful to discriminate between real pathological findings and artefacts...|$|E
40|$|Transient {{receptor}} potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV 1) plays a {{major role}} in hyperalgesia and allodynia and is expressed both in the peripheral and central nervous systems (CNS). However, few studies have evaluated mechanisms by which CNS TRPV 1 mediates hyperalgesia and allodynia after injury. We hypothesized that activation of spinal cord systems releases endogenous TRPV 1 agonists that evoke the development of mechanical allodynia by this receptor. Using in vitro superfusion, the depolarization of spinal cord triggered the release of oxidized linoleic acid metabolites, such as 9 -hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (9 -HODE) that potently activated spinal TRPV 1, leading to the development of mechanical allodynia. Subsequent calcium imaging and electrophysiology studies demonstrated that synthetic oxidized linoleic acid metabolites, including 9 -HODE, 13 -HODE, and 9 and 13 -oxoODE, comprise a family of endogenous TRPV 1 agonists. In vivo studies demonstrated that <b>intrathecal</b> <b>application</b> of these oxidized linoleic acid metabolites rapidly evokes mechanical allodynia. Finally, intrathecal neutralization of 9 - and 13 -HODE by antibodies blocks CFA-evoked mechanical allodynia. These data collectively reveal a mechanism by which an endogenous family of lipids activates TRPV 1 in the spinal cord, leading to the development of inflammatory hyperalgesia. These findings may integrate many pain disorders and provide an approach for developing analgesic drugs...|$|E
40|$|Blocking the neurite growth {{inhibitor}} Nogo-A by neutralizing antibodies improves functional recovery after partial spinal cord injury. In parallel, regeneration and sprouting of cortico- and rubrospinal projections are increased and may partially explain the enhanced functional recovery. The serotonergic raphe-spinal tract, which {{plays a key}} regulatory role for spinal motor circuits, has not been analysed in detail with regard to its response to Nogo-A function blocking antibody treatment after spinal cord injury. We studied the effect of 2 weeks of <b>intrathecal</b> Nogo-A antibody <b>application</b> after partial thoracic spinal cord injury on the lamina-specific restitution of the serotonergic (5 -HT) raphe-spinal projections to the mid-lumbar grey matter. Nine weeks after the lesion, the number of 5 -HT fibres in Rexed's laminae 4 and 7 {{and the number of}} 5 -HT-positive varicosities on motoneurons in lamina 9 returned to their lamina-specific preinjury levels in Nogo-A antibody-treated rats. By contrast, control antibody-treated animals showed only a moderate increase in 5 -HT fibre density in the respective laminae, and the number of 5 -HT-positive varicosities on motoneurons remained low. Our results suggest that the Nogo-A antibody-induced recovery of descending serotonergic projections to the grey matter is lamina-specific and molecular cues must be present to guide the growing axons to the correct target areas. This appropriate restitution of the serotonergic innervation below the lesion site probably contributes to the impressive recovery of motor function...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{present study}} was {{designed}} to further investigate the effect of amitriptyline, a classical tricyclic antidepressant, on carrageenan-induced paw edema in rats. METHODS: First, amitriptyline was administered intraperitoneally (i. p.) at doses of 20, 40 and 80 mg kg- 1, 30 min before subplantar injection of carrageenan. Second, amitriptyline was given intracerebroventriculary or intrathecally at doses of 25, 50 and 100 &# 956;g/rat, 30 min prior to carrageenan challenge. Third, the effect of adrenergic receptor antagonists such as propranolol (10 mg kg- 1, i. p.), prazosin (4 mg kg- 1, i. p.) and yohimbine (10 mg kg- 1, i. p.) and an opioid receptor antagonist (naloxone, 4 mg kg- 1, i. p.) on the anti-inflammatory effect of amitriptyline (40 mg kg- 1, i. p.) was investigated. RESULTS: Our data confirm that intraperitoneally administered amitriptyline exhibits a marked anti-inflammatory effect on carrageenan-induced paw edema in rats 4 h postcarrageenan challenge (P < 0. 001). Intracerebroventricular (i. c. v.) administration of amitriptyline also reduced the development of paw edema at 4 h postcarrageenan (P < 0. 001), but <b>intrathecal</b> (i. t.) <b>application</b> of amitriptyline failed to alter the degree of paw swelling. Furthermore, the applied antagonists did not modify the anti-inflammatory effect of amitriptyline. CONCLUSION: These results support the view that amitriptyline has a considerable anti-inflammatory effect on carrageenan-induced paw edema in rats and suggest that at least a part of this property could be mediated through supraspinal sites. Moreover, it seems unlikely that the investigated adrenergic and opioid receptors have a significant role in this effect of amitriptyline...|$|R
40|$|When {{applied in}} vitro to various CNS {{structures}} 5 -HT and/or NMDA {{have been observed}} to generate rhythmic nervous activity. In contrast, reports of similar in vivo actions are relatively rare. Here we describe a physiological sympathetic motor rhythm regulating the thermoregulatory circulation of the rat tail (T-rhythm; 0. 40 – 1. 20 Hz) that can be elicited following <b>intrathecal</b> (i. t.) <b>application</b> of 5 -HT to an in situ‘isolated’ spinal cord preparation (anaesthetized rats spinalized at T 10 –T 11 and cauda equina cut). i. t. injections were delivered to L 1 as sympathetic neuronal activity to the tail (SNAT) arises from preganglionic neurones at T 11 –L 2. SNAT was abolished after spinal transection (n = 18) {{and it did not}} return spontaneously. The administration of 5 -HT (250 nmol) generated rhythmic sympathetic discharges (n = 6). The mean frequency of the T-like rhythm during the highest level of activity was 0. 88 ± 0. 04 Hz which was not significantly different from the T-rhythm frequency observed in intact animals (0. 77 ± 0. 02 Hz; P > 0. 05 n = 16). In contrast, NMDA (1 μmol) generated an irregular tonic activity, but it failed to generate a T-like rhythm (n = 9), even though the mean levels of activity were not significantly different to those produced by 5 -HT. However, 5 -HT (250 nmol) applied after NMDA generated a T-like rhythm (0. 95 ± 0. 11 Hz, n = 6). Our observations support the idea that 5 -HT released from rostral ventromedial medullary neurones, known to innervate sympathetic preganglionic neurones, can induce sympathetic rhythmic activity...|$|R
