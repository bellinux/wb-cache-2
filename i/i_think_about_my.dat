Pacquiao was ahead {{on all three}} judges' {{scorecards}} before the stoppage, with two judges scoring the fight 80–71 and the other judge scoring it at 79–72. After the bout, Pacquiao's trainer Freddie Roach stated, [...] "We knew we had him after the first round. He had no legs, he was hesitant and he was shot." [...] Confirming Roach's pre-fight predictions that he'd grown too old, De La Hoya crossed the ring to Pacquiao's corner after the bout was stopped and told Roach, [...] "You're right, Freddie. I don't have it anymore." [...] When asked by reporters whether he would continue fighting, De La Hoya responded, [...] "My heart still wants to fight, that's for sure," [...] De La Hoya said. [...] "But when your physical doesn't respond, what can you do? I have to be smart and make sure <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> future plans." [...] During the first episode of the HBO 24/7 Pacquiao–Hatton series, Roach had said he saw IV marks on De La Hoya's arm, pointing out {{that he needed to}} be rehydrated surgically as a last resort.|$|E

The academic parceling up of these subjects can become an impediment to studying what I want to study, so that's the motive for interdisciplinarity. When I think about ethics, I can't help but think about politics. When <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> Christianity, I'm also thinking about social justice.

40|$|At the {{beginning}} of the project I wanted to develop a style of painting that could articulate general experiences of music. However, through my research I also became interested in a codified method of drawing. Straight forward concepts of set theory have been appropriated for artistic purposes. Predictable sets of rules structure the language of my visual imagery. My drawing structures can be summarized -through notation. A method of notating my responses to music changed the way <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> art. <b>My</b> interest in notation and procedural invention corresponds with an interest in intertextuality and new perceptions of literacy. I have developed my work -through a multiplicity of textual concepts. I have used a productive ambiguity of research intentions (practical, theoretical and historical) to drive my research. The written exegesis explains the philosophical underpinnings of my visual research...|$|R

That same day, Beyoncé also released a promotional video, titled [...] "Where is your park" [...] that gives viewers a glimpse of her workout routine, samples of the clothing line and a narration explaining the origin and significance of the brand and its name; Ivy, representing her daughter who is named Blue Ivy Carter, and Park, representing Parkwood Park in Houston where Beyoncé used to go to exercise and find personal strength. She elaborated in the video,I would wake up in the morning, and my dad would come knocking at my door, telling me it's time to go running. I remember wanting to stop, but I would push myself to keep going. It taught me discipline. And <b>I</b> would <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> dreams. <b>I</b> would <b>think</b> <b>about</b> the sacrifices <b>my</b> parents made for me. <b>I</b> would <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> little sister and how I was her hero. I would look at the beauty around me, the sun shining through the trees. I would keep breathing. There are things I'm still afraid of. When I have to conquer those things, I still go back to that park. Before I hit the stage, I go back to that park. When {{it was time for me}} to give birth, I went back to that park. The park became a state of mind. The park became my strength. The park is what made me who I am.

Ever since I came to Green Gables I've been making mistakes, and each mistake has helped to cure me of some great shortcoming. The affair of the amethyst brooch cured me of meddling with things that didn't belong to me. The Haunted Wood mistake cured me of letting my imagination run away with me. The liniment cake mistake cured me of carelessness in cooking. Dyeing my hair cured me of vanity. <b>I</b> never <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> hair and nose now--at least, very seldom.

It was probably easy enough in towered Camelot hundreds of years ago, but romance is not appreciated now. I feel quite sure that you will soon see a great improvement in me in this respect, Marilla." ...|$|R
