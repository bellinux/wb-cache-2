This proved impossible so in 1768 he had the <b>entire</b> <b>house</b> demolished.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} purpose {{of much of}} Bath's architecture is concealed by the honey-coloured classical façades; in an era {{before the advent of}} the luxury hotel, these apparently elegant residences were frequently purpose-built lodging houses, where visitors could hire a room, a floor, or (according to their means) an <b>entire</b> <b>house</b> for the duration of their visit, and be waited on by the house's communal servants.|$|E

5|$|It is {{wonderful}} {{that both of}} these things occurred under Valerian; {{and it is the}} more remarkable in this case when we consider his previous conduct, for he had been mild and friendly toward the men of God, for none of the emperors before him had treated them so kindly and favorably; and not even those who were said openly to be Christians received them with such manifest hospitality and friendliness as he did {{at the beginning of his}} reign. For his <b>entire</b> <b>house</b> was filled with pious persons and was a church of God.|$|E

5|$|Most {{buildings}} in Bath {{are made from}} the local, golden-coloured Bath Stone, and many date from the 18th and 19th century. The dominant style of architecture in Central Bath is Georgian; this style evolved from the Palladian revival style that became popular in the early 18th century. Many of the prominent architects of the day were employed {{in the development of}} the city. The original purpose of much of Bath's architecture is concealed by the honey-coloured classical façades; in an era before the advent of the luxury hotel, these apparently elegant residences were frequently purpose-built lodging houses, where visitors could hire a room, a floor, or (according to their means) an <b>entire</b> <b>house</b> for the duration of their visit, and be waited on by the house's communal servants.

25|$|A {{wife was}} also {{seen as being}} of high value, and was therefore, usually, {{carefully}} looked after. Early nomadic communities practised a form of marriage known as beena, in which a wife would own a tent of her own, within which she retains complete independence from her husband; this principle appears to survive in parts of early Israelite society, as some early passages of the Bible appear to portray certain wives as each owning a tent as a personal possession (specifically, Jael, Sarah, and Jacob's wives). In later times, the Bible describes wives as being given the innermost room(s) of the husband's house, as her own private area to which men were not permitted; {{in the case of}} wealthy husbands, the Bible describes their wives as having each been given an <b>entire</b> <b>house</b> for this purpose.|$|E

The Lion calls Tom and commands him to kill Kelly or risk the <b>entire</b> <b>house</b> blowing up and killing everyone inside. Any attempt to evacuate the house or rescue Kelly will result in everyone getting blown up and the Lion will not accept any substitutions, as he wants Tom to suffer for messing up the Lion's network in the Southwestern United States.
