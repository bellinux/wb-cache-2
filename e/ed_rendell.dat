5|$|Gerald L. Zahorchak is an American {{educator}} {{and the former}} Secretary of Education for the Pennsylvania Department of Education, a position he held from 2006 to 2010. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Zahorchak worked at various Pennsylvania public school districts {{in a number of}} positions, including teacher, football coach, principal, federal programs director, strategic planning coordinator and personnel director. Zahorchak worked as superintendent of the Greater Johnstown School District in Cambria County from 1997 to 2003, when he was chosen to be Deputy Secretary for Elementary and Secondary Education for the state. Governor <b>Ed</b> <b>Rendell</b> appointed him Secretary of Education in 2005.|$|E
5|$|While Holloway's family {{initially}} discouraged {{a travel}} boycott of Aruba, this changed by September 2005. Twitty urged that persons not travel to Aruba and other Dutch territories {{because of what}} she stated were tourist safety issues. In a November 8, 2005, news conference, Governor Bob Riley and the Holloways urged Alabamians and others to boycott Aruba. Riley also wrote to other United States governors seeking their supportâ€”the governors of Georgia and Arkansas eventually joined in the call for boycott. Philadelphia's city council voted to ask the Pennsylvania Governor of Pennsylvania <b>Ed</b> <b>Rendell</b> {{to call for a}} boycott. Rendell did not do so, and no federal support was given.|$|E
5|$|Although Sestak was {{initially}} urged to {{run by the}} Democratic establishment, Specter gained wide support from Democrats after he switched parties. Major political figures like President Barack Obama and Pennsylvania Governor <b>Ed</b> <b>Rendell</b> later tried to sway Sestak from continuing the race, fearing he would damage Specter's chances in the general election. Former President Bill Clinton offered Sestak {{a position in the}} Obama administration if he withdrew his candidacy, an offer Republicans would later criticize. Sestak refused to drop out and criticized Specter's party switch as an opportunistic move aimed solely at self-preservation. Nevertheless, Sestak struggled to overcome problems stemming from low name recognition and Specter's support from such individuals as Joe Biden and Harry Reid, and organizations like the AFL-CIO and Pennsylvania Democratic Committee.|$|E

5|$|In Pennsylvania, Governor <b>Ed</b> <b>Rendell</b> {{declared}} a disaster emergency {{across the entire}} state on the 15th. PPL Electric Utilities Corporation reported 1,542 customers were without power for a time during the storm in the Lancaster, Harrisburg and Allentown areas. Snow began across between 6 AM and 7 AM EST on the 13th in Philadelphia, Delaware, Chester, Montgomery and Berks counties. The snow then overspread Bucks, Northampton, Lehigh, Carbon, Berks, and most of Schuylkill counties between 8 AM and 10 AM EST, but held off in Monroe County until the early afternoon hours. There was a lull in the precipitation during the evening hours of the 13th especially across southeastern Pennsylvania, however the precipitation became widespread overnight and during {{the early morning hours}} of the 14th.|$|E
5|$|Zahorchak was {{appointed}} state Secretary of Education on October 5, 2005, by Governor <b>Ed</b> <b>Rendell,</b> following {{the resignation of}} former Secretary Francis Barnes. He was considered highly regarded by both Democratic and Republican lawmakers involved in education issues. During his Pennsylvania State Senate confirmation hearing in December 2005, Zahorchak said he supported the state's $44million Educational Improvement Tax Credit, which provides tax breaks for businesses that support public education programs and private school scholarships. Zahorchak also said he believed basic education should be the state's primary fiscal educational investment, rather than special education or higher education. The Pennsylvania State Senate Education Committee unanimously approved Zahorchak during his confirmation hearing on December 13, 2005, and the full senate unanimously confirmed him on February 7, 2006.|$|E
5|$|At 10:30 PM, all {{westbound}} Interstate 78 {{traffic is}} {{stopped at the}} Hamburg exit due to numerous disabled vehicles. At 10:40 PM, Governor <b>Ed</b> <b>Rendell</b> declared a disaster emergency. On the 15th at 3:54 AM, state troopers and emergency personnel began walking miles of Interstate 78, waking up truckers who have gone to sleep as traffic begins to move. At 5 PM on the 15th, the state orders Interstate 78 shut down in both directions from Interstate 81 in Lebanon County to Route 100 in Lehigh County. At 6 PM on the 15th, plowing begins and continued through the night. Additional snow removing equipment was brought in from {{the western part of}} the state to help with the clearing of the highway. Highway officials along with the National Guard and State Police worked to clear the stuck trucks and cars from the highway, therefore plowing and ice removal can get fully underway. On the 16th, the interstate remained closed throughout the day as crews continued to plow and remove ice. On the 17th at 4 PM, the interstate reopened.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the arrival}} of Isabel, Governor <b>Ed</b> <b>Rendell</b> {{declared}} a state of emergency for the state. The Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency activated a support team to assist Urban Search and Rescue operations as part of the threat from the storm. The state's National Guard placed 2,990guardsmen on Emergency Condition 5 status to be deployed anywhere in the state for emergency support, with other guardsmen readying equipment such as generators, heavy trucks, water trailers, and engineer equipment for deployment. State police officers were readied for deployment, while the state health department contacted hospitals to ensure generators were in working condition. The state Environmental Protection Agency prepared for the storm by monitoring the status of all dams, water treatment facilities, and nuclear plants. In addition, the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission stationed extra workers to patrol the highways in poor drainage areas, with extra equipment prepared for quick response for potential road blockage. Prior {{to the arrival}} of the storm, officials from PECO Energy prepared its largest workforce in its history with 1,500workers, including employees from Commonwealth Edison in Illinois and Detroit Edison.|$|E
5|$|The {{increased}} speculation led some, like former {{spokesman for}} Hillary Clinton's 2008 presidential campaign Phil Singer, to criticize Matthews for openly weighing {{a political campaign}} bid {{while working as a}} news broadcaster. Singer believed Matthews should resign or be suspended from the network until a decision was made. Speculation grew as Matthews spent much of 2008 attending meetings with Pennsylvania representatives and major Democratic fundraisers. Matthews discussed a possible campaign with Pennsylvania Governor <b>Ed</b> <b>Rendell,</b> and poll numbers for a theoretical race showed him only three percentage points behind Specter. However, the speculation came to an end on January 7, 2009, when Matthews told his Hardball staff {{he was not going to}} run for Senate. Such media outlets as The New York Times and The Washington Post suggested Matthews' alleged consideration was a tactic to ensure a higher salary during negotiations with MSNBC to renew his contract, which was set to expire in June 2009.|$|E
5|$|Liberty Property Trust {{hoped to}} get the One Pennsylvania Plaza site {{designated}} a Keystone Opportunity Improvement Zone (KOZ). KOZ designation was intended to encourage development in poor, blighted areas by exempting the tenants of the building from all state and local taxes. Designating One Pennsylvania Plaza a KOZ was supported by then Pennsylvania Governor <b>Ed</b> <b>Rendell,</b> who said {{it was important to}} keep corporations within the city. At the time, many of Philadelphia's big employers' leases, including Comcast's, were due to expire, and the employers were considering the possibility of moving out of the city and state. Rendell also said allowing Comcast to enlarge its headquarters by moving into One Pennsylvania Plaza could attract other corporate headquarters to the city. However, other Center City building owners, including Comcast's landlord at Centre Square, HRPT Properties Trust, were opposed to the plan. They said giving the tower the KOZ designation would give it an unfair advantage because Liberty Property Trust could charge above-market rents since the tax breaks would offset the cost for tenants. The group believed tenants attracted to One Pennsylvania Plaza because of the tax breaks would cause more vacancies in other Center City skyscrapers, rather than attracting more business to blighted areas as intended under the law. In early 2004, Center City had a vacancy rate of 12.8%.|$|E
25|$|Of the 67 {{counties}} in Pennsylvania, 46 were under {{a state of}} emergency as declared by Governor <b>Ed</b> <b>Rendell.</b> Four deaths were confirmed in Pennsylvania; two in Luzerne County, one near Gettysburg, and one in rural Wayne County.|$|E
25|$|Street {{was once}} again {{challenged}} by Sam Katz. Despite an ongoing FBI investigation, Street was aided by Pennsylvania Governor and former Mayor of Philadelphia, <b>Ed</b> <b>Rendell</b> endorsing and campaigning for him. Street won with 58% of the vote for reelection.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} morning hours of July 7, 2005, <b>Ed</b> <b>Rendell</b> signed a bill into law that {{increased}} pay for state lawmakers, judges, and top executive-branch officials. The vote took place at 2 am without public review or commentary. On November 16, 2005, Rendell signed a repeal of the pay raise after a near unanimous vote for repeal.|$|E
25|$|While not {{representing}} {{a majority of}} the Democratic Party electorate, a decent amount of Democratic elected officials have self-declared as being centrists. Some of these Democrats are former President Bill Clinton, former Vice President Al Gore, Senator Mark Warner, former Pennsylvania governor <b>Ed</b> <b>Rendell,</b> former senator Jim Webb, Vice President Joe Biden, congresswoman Ann Kirkpatrick and former congressman Dave McCurdy.|$|E
25|$|University of Pittsburgh Medical Center's Children's Hospital took in 53 orphans for treatment. The children, {{as young}} as six months, {{had been living in}} the Port-au-Prince Bresma Orphanage run by two Pittsburgh-native sisters. Pennsylvania Governor <b>Ed</b> <b>Rendell</b> and Representative Jason Altmire flew with a group of medical staff to Haiti and {{returned}} with the 53 children. 47 of the children had adoption cases in progress from the United States, Canada and Spain, many of which were in the final stages.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ed</b> <b>Rendell</b> {{was born}} on January 5, 1944 in New York City, the son of Emma (nÃ©e Sloat) and Jesse T. Rendell. His parents were Jewish, and all four of his {{grandparents}} were immigrants from Russia. He attended Riverdale Country School before the University of Pennsylvania, where he joined the Pi Lambda Phi fraternity in 1962 and earned a B.A. degree, 1965, and Villanova University School of Law, Juris Doctor, 1968. He served as a 2nd Lieutenant in the U.S. Army Reserve from 1968 to 1974.|$|E
25|$|In Pennsylvania, Governor <b>Ed</b> <b>Rendell</b> {{declared}} a state of emergency early on the 17th which made state agencies available for assistance. It also freed counties from spending restrictions and allowed routes to be closed to non-emergency vehicles. The state also issued a travel advisory asking people to stay off the roads. Many municipalities (including Philadelphia) declared their own snow emergencies which banned non-essential travel and parking on snow emergency routes. There were two snow-related deaths within Philadelphia. In the southeastern part of the state, area malls closed early on the 16th and churches cancelled services.|$|E
25|$|The Republican Party {{has been}} {{historically}} dominant in county-level politics. For statewide and national-level candidates, Pike County has {{leaned toward the}} Republican Party. In 2000 Republican George W. Bush won 53% to Democrat Al Gore's 42%. In 2004 Republican George W. Bush won 58% to Democrat John Kerry's 40%. In 2008 Republican John McCain won 51% to Democrat Barack Obama's 47%. But, due to population growth, new residents have led an increase in Democratic voting. In 2006, Democratic Governor <b>Ed</b> <b>Rendell</b> won Pike with 53%. Of the four statewide Democratic candidates in the 2008 election, {{the only one to}} carry Pike was Jack Wagner.|$|E
25|$|Villanova has {{produced}} several military and governmental officials, including former Pennsylvania Governor <b>Ed</b> <b>Rendell,</b> former New Hampshire Senator Kelly Ayotte (Villanova Law), and former Connecticut Governor John G. Rowland. Wife {{to the governor}} and federal judge for the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, Marjorie Rendell, is also a graduate. Numerous Marine generals and Naval Admirals are products of Villanova's Naval ROTC program, including William J. Fallon, Admiral in the United States Navy and Commander of United States Central Command; George B. Crist, Marine General and the first Marine to be designated Commander in Chief, Central Command; and Anthony Zinni, retired four-star General in the United States Marine Corps.

25|$|In 2003, Cunningham {{resigned}} as Mayor of Bethlehem to become Secretary of the Department of General Services under Governor <b>Ed</b> <b>Rendell.</b> Cunningham earned $110,000 {{annually in the}} state position. As secretary of the Department of General Services, Cunningham oversaw 1,300 employees and {{was responsible for the}} management of more than 11,000 state-owned buildings, including the State Capitol and Governor's Mansion. In total, the department managed 6.7 million square feet of office space, 117 acres of state grounds and roadways, and 1,350 Commonwealth leases at an annual cost of $110 million. As secretary, Cunningham oversaw $4 billion of Pennsylvania's budget, including his department's own budget of $141.6 million. Within his first month in the post, Rendell tasked him with reducing that budget by 10 percent.|$|E
25|$|The Republican Party {{had been}} {{historically}} dominant in county-level politics; {{prior to the}} Great Depression Pittsburgh and Allegheny County had been Republican. Since the Great Depression on the state and national levels, the Democratic Party has been dominant in county-level politics and is the Democratic stronghold of western Pennsylvania. In 2000, Democrat Al Gore won 56% of the vote and Republican George W. Bush won 41%. In 2004, Democrat John Kerry received 57% of the vote and Republican Bush received 42%. In 2006, Democrats Governor <b>Ed</b> <b>Rendell</b> and Senator Bob Casey, Jr. won 59% and 65% {{of the vote in}} Allegheny County, respectively. In 2008, Democrat Barack Obama received 57% of the vote, John McCain received 41%, and each of the three state row office winners (Rob McCord for Treasurer, Jack Wagner for Auditor General, and Tom Corbett for Attorney General) also carried Allegheny.|$|E
25|$|On April 11, 1997 {{developer}} Rubin, hotelier Jonathan Tisch and Philadelphia mayor <b>Ed</b> <b>Rendell</b> {{announced in}} the PSFS boardroom that the PSFS Building would be converted into a Loews Hotel. Over the next year {{the conversion of the}} building into a hotel was delayed while Loews negotiated with the Rubin Organization to buy out its interest in the building. An agreement was formally reached in June 1998, and work began on the building shortly thereafter. After a year-long delay on starting the renovations, there were concerns more delays would occur if the building's conversion {{turned out to be more}} difficult than first thought. The concern stemmed from the city's attempt to attract a political convention to the city in 2000. A key part of attracting a political convention was the number of available hotel rooms in the host city, and completion of the PSFS Building on time was an important factor.|$|E
25|$|Giuliani {{spoke in}} support of the removal of the People's Mujahedin of Iran (MEK, also PMOI, MKO) from the United States State Department list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations. The group was on the State Department list from 1997 until September 2012. They were placed on the list for killing six Americans in Iran during the 1970s and {{attempting}} to attack the Iranian mission to the United Nations in 1992. Giuliani, along with other former government officials and politicians <b>Ed</b> <b>Rendell,</b> R. James Woolsey, Porter Goss, Louis Freeh, Michael Mukasey, James L. Jones, Tom Ridge, and Howard Dean, were criticized for their involvement with the group. Some were subpoenaed during an inquiry about who was paying the prominent individuals' speaking fees. Giuliani and others wrote an article for the conservative publication National Review stating their position that the group should not be classified as a terrorist organization. They supported their position by pointing out that the United Kingdom and the European Union had already removed the group from their terrorism lists. They further assert that only the United States and Iran still listed it as a terrorist group. However, Canada did not delist the group until December 2012.|$|E
25|$|In March 1998, Philadelphia mayor <b>Ed</b> <b>Rendell</b> {{appointed}} Timoney as Philadelphia Police commissioner. Timoney served {{through the}} end of 2001. His career marked a turnaround in Philadelphia's increasing homicide rate but had controversy. Critics challenged his handling of protests during the 2000 Republican National Convention, particularly his use of undercover agents to infiltrate protest groups. Timoney testified under oath at the trial of Matthew Berghs, who was charged with aggravated assault, a felony, and misdemeanors simple assault, obstruction of justice, and recklessly endangering another person during the convention. Berghs was held in jail for three days on $50,000 bail. During the trial, Berghs' attorney showed the jury photographs of five-day old bruises and scrapes he claimed showed that Berghs had been beaten by police officers. Both the arresting officer and Timoney denied there was violence during the arrest. Berghs, a slight 19-year old activist and Indiana University student, was accused of hitting a Philadelphia police officer, Thomas Donahue, with a seven-foot bamboo stick. The prosecution was unable to supply fingerprint evidence to support their claims and relied solely on eyewitness testimony from the officer and the commissioner. Timoney testified under oath on behalf of officer Donahue, claiming he witnessed the entire incident, but he was unable to convince the twelve-person jury that Berghs was guilty of anything. Berghs was acquitted.|$|E
500|$|One of Hsu's most {{tenacious}} supporters was Pennsylvania Governor <b>Ed</b> <b>Rendell,</b> {{who called}} Hsu [...] "one {{of the best}} 10 people I've met." [...] Later, Rendell said, [...] "Though Norman is my friend and remains so, his failure to appear casts a new light on his assertions regarding the original [...] case. As a result I will follow other elected officials and donate the money he contributed to me to charity." ...|$|E
500|$|Zahorchak {{served as}} acting {{education}} secretary from August 2004, when Phillips left the position, to September 2004, when Francis Barnes was hired. During the Barnes administration, Governor <b>Ed</b> <b>Rendell</b> encouraged local Pennsylvania school boards {{to participate in}} Act 72, a state property tax-relief program. Act 72 used proceeds from slot-machine gambling to finance property tax cuts from homeowners, and included with spending restrictions {{in exchange for the}} tax cuts. Barnes himself did not support the program, and most school boards rejected it because of the spending restrictions. Zahorchak, however voiced support for Act 72 and helped Rendell lobby local school districts to support it, which increased his visibility statewide. Zahorchak claimed Act 72 [...] "includes real property tax relief that shifts more of the responsibility for school funding back to the state". When Barnes resigned in September 2005, Zahorchak was again tapped to serve as acting secretary and was widely considered the most qualified candidate for the permanent position, although Governor <b>Ed</b> <b>Rendell</b> engaged in a thorough search for other potential candidates around the state.|$|E
500|$|Severe ice {{caused a}} [...] stretch of Interstate 78 in Pennsylvania between Lebanon County and Allentown {{to be shut}} down, {{stranding}} motorists for upwards of 24 hours and requiring the National Guard to be called in. Other stretches of highway throughout Pennsylvania were shut down, including Interstate 80, [...] 81, and after the storm, even the Pennsylvania Turnpike. On February 16, Governor <b>Ed</b> <b>Rendell</b> called for a thorough investigation into how the state handled the winter weather emergency, citing a lack of communication and quick action {{as the cause of}} the problems, and even {{going so far as to}} taking responsibility for the situation.|$|E
500|$|In November 2006, Governor <b>Ed</b> <b>Rendell</b> {{and former}} Pennsylvania House Speaker John Perzel raised {{the idea of}} leasing the turnpike longterm to a private group {{to raise money to}} improve other {{infrastructure}} in the state. Such a lease was speculated to raise up to $30 billion for the state. In October 2007, 34 companies submitted 14 proposals to lease the turnpike. [...] On May 19, 2008, a record $12.8 billion proposal by the Spanish firm Abertis Infraestructuras, SA and Citi Infrastructure Investors of New York City to lease the turnpike was submitted. The consortium withdrew the offer on September 30, 2008 as they reasoned the proposal would be approved in the state legislature.|$|E
