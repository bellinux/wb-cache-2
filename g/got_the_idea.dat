5|$|House {{was created}} by David Shore, who <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> for the misanthropic title {{character}} from a doctor's visit. Initially, producer Bryan Singer wanted an American to play House, but British actor Hugh Laurie's audition convinced him that a foreign actor could play the role. Shore wrote House as a character with parallels to Sherlock Holmes—both are drug users, blunt, and close to being friendless. The show's producers wanted House handicapped in some way and gave the character a damaged leg arising from an improper diagnosis.|$|E

It is directed by Ravi Kumar and features Martin Sheen, Mischa Barton, Kal Penn, Rajpal Yadav, Tannishtha Chatterjee, and Fagun Thakrar in important roles. Benjamin Wallfisch composed the film's music. Kumar <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of making a film based on the Bhopal disaster after he read a book based on it. Shot {{over a period of}} 18 months, it was originally slated for a late 2010 release. However, the lack of responses from distributors kept on delaying the release.|$|E

5|$|In July 2011 Austrian pastafarian Niko Alm won {{the legal}} right to be shown in his driving license photo wearing a pasta {{strainer}} on his head, after three years spent pursuing permission and obtaining an examination certifying that he was psychologically fit to drive. He <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> after reading that Austrian regulations allow headgear in official photos only when it is worn for religious reasons. Some sources report that the colander in the form of pasta strainer, was recognised by Austrian authorities as a religious headgear of the parody religion Pastafarianism in 2011. This was denied by Austrian authorities, saying that religious motives were not the reason to grant the permission of wearing the headgear in a passport.|$|E

The book follows Carly Beth, a girl who buys a Halloween mask from a store. After putting on the mask, she starts acting differently and discovers that the mask has become her face; she is unable to pull the mask off. R. L.

5|$|The film {{is based}} on an American sailor who comes to the Yamaki family after his ship wrecks in the ocean. The sailor (Borzage) falls in love with the {{daughter}} (Aoki) of the family, unaware {{of the fact that she}} is cursed by God, such that if she marries, a nearby volcano will erupt and destroy the entire island on which the family lives. Writer and producer Thomas H. Ince <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> for the film from the volcanic eruption on the island of Sakura-Jima in 1914. Hayakawa was paid $500 a week, the highest paid of all oriental stars at the time.|$|E

Hill writes: [...] Wherever he <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>ideas</b> expressed in <b>the</b> heading, Mr. Murray made one serious tactical mistake in saying that Luther [...] "composed" [...] the hymn, and then placing only his own initials where the composer's name is normally given. As a consequence, his fellow compilers of song books apparently supposed that all he had done was to arrange the accompaniment.|$|R
5|$|The {{game was}} {{directed}} by Takeshi Yamazaki and produced by Motohide Eshiro, with character designs by Tatsuro Iwamoto, and music by Noriyuki Iwadare and Yasuko Yamada. Eshiro <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> {{to make a new}} game featuring characters from the original Ace Attorney games while working on Trials and Tribulations. According to Eshiro, the game was made for portable play, and has an interface that uses the touch screen; as this could not be replicated on other platforms such as Xbox Live, he said that the Nintendo DS was the platform that was best suited for it, and that no ports to other hardware were planned.|$|E
5|$|Harrison first <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> {{to stage}} {{what became the}} 1974 Music Festival from India during the Bombay {{sessions}} for his debut solo album, the 1968 film soundtrack Wonderwall Music, after hearing Shankar's orchestral work Nava Rasa Ranga. While in India in early 1974, Shankar and Harrison planned the venture, which consisted of a European tour by Shankar's hand-picked orchestra of Indian classical musicians, after which the ensemble would tour North America with Harrison and his band of Western musicians. For his orchestra, Shankar selected regular accompanists such as tabla player Alla Rakha and singers Lakshmi Shankar and Kamala Chakravarty; other established players including Shivkumar Sharma (santoor), Hariprasad Chaurasia (flute), Rijram Desad (percussion) and Kamalesh Maitra (tabla tarang); and musicians that went on to establish themselves internationally {{as a result of}} their participation, such as violinist L. Subramaniam and sarangi player Sultan Khan.|$|E
5|$|The Scottish author Robert Louis Stevenson wrote Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde in 1885 when he {{was living}} in Bournemouth, on England's south coast. In January 1886 the novella was {{published}} in the United Kingdom by Longmans, Green & Co. and by Charles Scribner's Sons in the United States, where it was frequently pirated {{because of the lack of}} copyright protection in the U.S. for works originally published in the UK. In early 1887, actor Richard Mansfield read Stevenson's novella and immediately <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> to adapt it for the stage. Mansfield was looking for material that would help him achieve a reputation as a serious actor in the U.S., where he lived, and in England, where he had spent most of his childhood. He had played dual roles as a father and son in a New York production of the operetta Rip Van Winkle, and saw another acting opportunity in playing Jekyll and Hyde.|$|E

Rosa claims that he thinks that he <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>ideas</b> for those comics from a mechanical engineering course in an institute of higher education, which he took {{before he became a}} professional cartoonist.|$|R

5|$|The pre-credits {{sequence}} used {{a church}} in Stoke Poges as a cemetery, while the helicopter scenes were filmed at the abandoned Beckton Gas Works in London. The gas works were also the location for some of Stanley Kubrick's 1987 film, Full Metal Jacket. Director John Glen <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> for the remote-controlled helicopter after seeing a child playing with an RC car. Since flying a helicopter through a warehouse {{was thought to be}} too dangerous, the scene was shot using forced perspective. A smaller mock-up was built by Derek Meddings' team closer to the camera that the stunt pilot Marc Wolff flew behind and this made it seem as if the helicopter was entering the warehouse. The footage inside the building was shot on location, though with a life-sized helicopter model which stood over a rail. Stuntman Martin Grace stood as Bond when the agent is dangling outside the flying helicopter, while Roger Moore himself was used in the scenes inside the model.|$|E
5|$|Wirkola <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> {{to create}} a film based on the adult lives of Hansel and Gretel in 2007 while at film school in Australia. After being {{discovered}} by Gary Sanchez Productions, Wirkola pitched the idea at a meeting with Paramount Pictures and won a contract. Production began in March 2011 at the Babelsberg Studios in Germany and included extensive use of traditional special effects. In addition, Renner and Arterton had a month of training beforehand {{to prepare for the}} physical demands of their roles. In terms of the weapons and wardrobe, Wirkola wanted an old-world look with a modern touch, and he was adamant about filming outdoors in European nature rather than in a studio. The project was filmed in Germany and featured an international cast and crew.|$|E

25|$|Alexius Meinong (1853–1920) — Austrian {{psychologist}} and philosopher, who wrote Gegenstandstheorie ("The theory of objects"), where he wrote {{at length about}} the notion of objects that exist only in our minds.

25|$|Frozen food is food {{preserved}} {{by the process}} of freezing. Freezing food is a common method of food preservation which slows both food decay and, by turning water to ice, makes it unavailable for most bacterial growth and slows down most chemical reactions.

Birdseye <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> during fur-trapping expeditions to Labrador in 1912 and 1916, where he saw the natives use freezing to preserve foods.|$|E
