50|$|In January 1976, {{a patent}} was issued for the Chemiluminescent Signal Device, with Vincent J. Esposito, Steven M. Little, and John H. Lyons {{listed as the}} inventors (Patent 3,933,118). This patent {{recommended}} a single <b>glass</b> <b>ampoule</b> that is suspended in a second substance, that when broken and mixed together, provide the chemiluminescent light. The design also included a stand for the signal device {{so it could be}} thrown from a moving vehicle and remain standing in an upright position on the road. The idea was this would replace traditional emergency roadside flares and would be superior, since it was not a fire hazard, would be easier and safer to deploy, and would not be made ineffective if struck by passing vehicles. This design, with its single <b>glass</b> <b>ampoule</b> inside a plastic tube filled with a second substance that when bent breaks the glass and then is shaken to mix the substances, most closely resembles the typical glow stick sold today.|$|R

50|$|Modern {{ampoules}} {{are most}} commonly used to contain pharmaceuticals and chemicals that must be protected from air and contaminants. They are hermetically sealed by melting the thin top with an open flame, and usually opened by snapping off the neck. If properly done, this last operation creates a clean break without any extra glass shards or slivers; but the liquid or solution may be filtered for greater assurance. Glass particle contamination is of ongoing concern, with patients who receive medication parenterally, such as intravenously under hospital care, {{at greater risk of}} receiving glass particulates when medication is aspirated. The space above the chemical may be filled with an inert gas before sealing. The walls of <b>glass</b> <b>ampoules</b> are usually sufficiently strong to be brought into a glovebox without any difficulty.|$|E
5000|$|It {{was during}} his time as a Medical Corps officer that he began his {{research}} into the inoculation of soldiers against typhoid. In 1908, Surgeon General O'Reilly sent Russell to England to observe the work of Sir Almroth Wright, Professor at the Royal Army Medical College, who had been experimenting with a method of prophylaxis with killed culture of typhoid organisms to immunize against the disease. Upon Russell's return, he submitted a report on Wright's research, which O'Reilly considered [...] "a very valuable treatise on the epidemiology of this disease". He conducted trials at the Army Medical Museum comparing the efficacy of both an orally administered and an injected vaccine. He packed the vaccine in small single dosage using small <b>glass</b> <b>ampoules</b> which, unlike the 1 liter flasks used in the United Kingdom, ensured {{that all of the}} typhoid micro-organisms were killed.|$|E

For example, freezing temperatures made the mine inert as the liquid froze, whereas temperatures above 50 degrees Celsius could cause the fuze to detonate spontaneously. Just as problematic {{was the fact that}} M600 fuzes were inherently unstable, making them dangerous to handle, particularly after having been kept in storage for some time.|$|R

Another variety of prank stink bomb comprises two bags, one smaller and inside the other. The inner one contains a liquid and the outer one a powder. When the inner one is ruptured by squeezing it, the liquid reacts with the powder, producing hydrogen sulfide, which expands and bursts the outer bag, releasing an unpleasant odor.|$|R
