5|$|On 3 July 1871, the DR {{opened its}} own tracks between Gloucester Road and High Street Kensington. These tracks, the Cromwell Curve, were opened without Parliamentary {{authority}} in an unsuccessful {{attempt by the}} DR to improve {{its share of the}} revenues between High Street Kensington and South Kensington stations which were <b>divided</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> basis of mileage of track owned by the two companies.|$|E

5|$|Originally {{conceived}} by High Voltage founder Kerry J. Ganofsky, creative expertise from The Lego Group assisted High Voltage in the game's development after Lego Media agreed to begin production. It received {{a mix of}} high and low scoring reviews from critics, who were <b>divided</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> game's graphics, construction system, driving gameplay and other design aspects. Two sequels developed by Attention to Detail, called Lego Racers 2 and Drome Racers, were released in 2001 and 2002, respectively.|$|E
5|$|The episode's {{original}} broadcast was watched by 9.55 million viewers and registered {{the show as}} the week's highest rated drama and third-highest rated scripted series in the 18–49 demographic. It received mixed reviews from the critics who were <b>divided</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> show's handling of Shepherd's death. However, they were largely laudatory of Pompeo, with critic Rick Porter deeming it the best performance of her career.|$|E
5|$|The {{song was}} {{released}} as a promotional single from the album on 9 March 2014.

5|$|Though {{she never}} wed, rumours spread that Sophia became {{pregnant}} by Thomas Garth, an equerry of her father's, and {{gave birth to}} an illegitimate son {{in the summer of}} 1800. Other gossip declared the child was the product of rape by her elder brother the Duke of Cumberland, who was deeply unpopular. Historians are <b>divided</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> validity of these stories, as some believe she gave birth to Garth's child while others call them tales spread by the Royal Family's political enemies.|$|E
5|$|Democrats were <b>divided</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{monetary}} issue. Their eventual nominee, Parker Watkins Hardin, {{was known}} to be a free silver supporter, but he pledged to abide by whatever platform the convention adopted. That platform was ambiguous with regard to the gold and silver question; it praised President Grover Cleveland and his treasury secretary, native Kentuckian John G. Carlisle, both gold supporters, and endorsed the national Democratic platform of 1892. Most believed this meant the platform favored gold, although silverites like Ollie M. James contended that the 1892 platform favored silver. Consequently, most Democrats left the convention not knowing where their nominee would stand on the money question.|$|E
5|$|Griffin and Collett {{were cleared}} {{of half the}} charges against them—the jury {{remained}} <b>divided</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> other charges, and a retrial was ordered. On 10 November 2006, after five hours of deliberations, the jury cleared them of all charges. They were met outside the court by about 200 supporters, who Griffin addressed with a megaphone. He attacked Tony Blair and the BBC, and defended the BNP's right to freedom of speech. BNP Deputy Chairman Simon Darby later claimed that had Griffin been convicted, the BNP leader planned to go on hunger strike.|$|E
50|$|Mount Ball is a {{mountain}} located <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Continental <b>Divide,</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> borders of Banff and Kootenay national parks in Canada. Mt. Ball {{is the highest}} peak of the Ball Range in the Canadian Rockies.|$|R
50|$|It {{is located}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Continental <b>Divide,</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Alberta-British Columbia border, in both Banff National Park and Yoho National Park. It lies <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{eastern edge of}} the Wapta Icefield, and is part of the Waputik Mountains.|$|R
50|$|Haiduk Peak is a peak located <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Continental <b>Divide</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{border of}} Banff and Kootenay National Parks {{at the head}} of Haiduk Creek. The {{mountain}} was named in 1922, probably after the Haiduks of the Balkans.|$|R
5|$|In North America and elsewhere, some Heathen {{communities}} have formalized such values into an ethical code, the Nine Noble Virtues (NNV), {{which is based}} largely on the Hávamál from the Poetic Edda. There are different forms of the NNV, with the number nine having symbolic associations in Norse mythology. Opinion is <b>divided</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> NNV; some practitioners deem them too dogmatic, while others eschew them for not having authentic roots in historical Germanic culture, negatively viewing them {{as an attempt to}} imitate the Judeo-Christian Ten Commandments. The NNV are not universal among Heathens, and it has for instance been noted that they are rare among Swedish practitioners.|$|E
5|$|Johnson was {{initially}} left {{to devise a}} Reconstruction policy without legislative intervention, as Congress was not due to meet again until December 1865. Radical Republicans told the President that the Southern states were economically {{in a state of}} chaos and urged him to use his leverage to insist on rights for freedmen as a condition of restoration to the Union. But Johnson, with the support of other officials including Seward, insisted that the franchise was a state, not a federal matter. The Cabinet was <b>divided</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> issue.|$|E
5|$|Leaders of the ACLU were <b>divided</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> best {{tactics to}} use to promote civil liberties. Felix Frankfurter felt that {{legislation}} was the best long-term solution, because the Supreme Court could not (andin his opinionshould not) mandate liberal interpretations of the Bill of Rights. But Walter Pollack, Morris Ernst, and other leaders felt that Supreme Court decisions were the best path to guarantee civil liberties. A series of Supreme Court decisions in the 1920s foretold a changing national atmosphere; anti-radical emotions were diminishing, {{and there was a}} growing willingness to protect freedom of speech and assembly via court decisions.|$|E
50|$|Isabelle Peak is a peak located <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Continental <b>Divide</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{border of}} Banff and Kootenay National Parks in the Canadian Rockies. The {{mountain}} was named in 1906 by Charles S. Thompson, after his sister Isabelle Thompson.|$|R

5|$|On April 14, 1775, Gage {{received}} {{instructions from}} Secretary of State William Legge, Earl of Dartmouth, to disarm the rebels and to imprison the rebellion's leaders, but Dartmouth gave Gage considerable discretion in his commands. Gage's decision to act promptly {{may have been}} influenced by information he received on April 15, from a spy within the Provincial Congress, telling him that although the Congress was still <b>divided</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> need for armed resistance, delegates were being sent to the other New England colonies to see if they would cooperate in raising a New England army of 18,000 colonial soldiers.|$|E
5|$|Released in July 1968, Thunderbird 6 had {{a mediocre}} {{reception}} at the box office, which ruled out the production of further sequels in the Thunderbirds film series. Critical response has remained mixed: although the special effects have been praised, commentators are <b>divided</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> quality of the plotting, which is considered either well-paced and concluding on a note of high action, or confusing and inordinately long, with little visual spectacle to contrast with the dialogue. Nevertheless, Thunderbird 6 is viewed favourably in comparison to Jonathan Frakes' 2004 film adaptation, receiving praise for the perceived agelessness of its entertainment value.|$|E
5|$|Scholars today remain <b>divided</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{merits of}} the {{electronic}} barrier system and {{the efficacy of the}} bombing campaigns that it directed. The claims of destruction made by the U.S. Air Force, both during and after the war, were originally taken as given. The only exception to this rule was at the CIA, which discounted Air Force claims at the time by as much as 75 percent. This was understandable {{due to the fact that}} the Vietnamese were basically silent during the 1970s and 1980s.|$|E

5|$|The Khitan spoken {{language}} is most {{closely related to}} the Mongolic language family; some broader definitions of the Mongolic family include Khitan as a member. More broadly, Khitan is an Altaic language, although scholars are <b>divided</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> question whether the Altaic is a true language family or linguistic area in which originally distinct languages have influenced each other over a long period. Khitan shares some terms with the Altaic but non-Mongolic Turkic spoken by the Uighur peoples, who shared the steppes of North Asia with the Khitans for several hundred years.|$|E
5|$|The {{game is a}} fast-paced 2D {{platformer}} {{that takes}} place across seven zones, each divided into three acts and a boss fight. It allows one or two players to control any {{two of the five}} characters; each one has different abilities that allow players varying access to parts of levels. While the graphics are mainly 2D, the game features some 3D rotation effects. It sold quickly upon release and received positive reviews from critics, who praised its gameplay and aesthetics, though they were more <b>divided</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> team-up dynamic. The game was later released for the Wii U's Virtual Console in Japan in May 2016.|$|E
5|$|The games {{received}} generally favorable reviews. Most critics {{praised the}} addition of Wi-Fi features and felt that the gameplay, though it had not received much updating from previous games, was still engaging. Reviewers were <b>divided</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> graphics, however, and the audio was criticized as being primitive. The games enjoyed more commercial success than their Game Boy Advance predecessors: with around 18 million units sold worldwide, Diamond and Pearl have sold over 2 million more units than Ruby and Sapphire and almost 6 million more units than FireRed and LeafGreen, while outselling their successors, Black and White, by over 2 million copies.|$|E

5000|$|This {{makes it}} {{possible}} to divide two quaternions p and q in two different ways (when q is non-zero). That is, their quotient can be either p q−1 or q−1p. The notation [...] is ambiguous because it does not specify whether q <b>divides</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> left or the right.|$|R
50|$|Forester Pass is a {{mountain}} {{pass in the}} Sierra Nevada. Located <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Kings-Kern <b>Divide</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> boundary between Sequoia National Park and Kings Canyon National Park, Forester Pass connects the drainages of Bubbs Creek and the Kern River. At 13153 ft, Forester Pass is the highest point along the Pacific Crest Trail.|$|R
