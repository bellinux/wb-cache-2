500|$|Ledbury found Ohio with Penn {{standing}} by Dorset and Bramham dropping depth charges. The {{remnants of the}} convoy were about ten miles away, under attack from the air. Just as Captain Hill suggested to Penn to take Ohio in tow, Ledbury received a signal from the Convoy Commander to stand by Manchester in the Gulf of Hammamet. In view of the delay in signals, and as Penn and Bramham were {{standing by}} these two ships, Ledbury proceeded at [...] to look for Manchester, which according to the signal given by S.O. Cruiser Force had a <b>flooded</b> <b>engine</b> room and was ablaze. As the destroyer searched for the missing ship, it had passed alongside the wreckage of Almeria Lykes, and it had also shot down two three-engined Savoia-Marchetti bombers. After making landfall and identifying a headland as Ras-Mahmur, course was set to follow the coastline looking for Manchester. When the destroyer was almost certain that Manchester {{was not in the}} bay, the coast was closed in case there might be any survivors on the beach. At this moment, the signal station at Neboel started calling up [...] "VHM - VHA" [...] but Ledbury did not reply. The signal station at Hammamet made a flag signal, [...] "show your signal letters". The destroyer hoisted an Italian group consisting of flag [...] " [...] I [...] " [...] and three other flags tied in knots so as to be unreadable. This apparently satisfied the shore station as they hoisted a large French ensign. During this period Ledbury was showing no ensign and no Italian ensign was carried on board. The destroyer carried on down the coast until it was twelve miles (19km) south of Hammamet. During this time there were enemy reports of a cruiser near Zembra and also that two destroyers were making for Pantelleria.The destroyer changed course to pass five miles south of Linosa, and she altered the course after dark in order to rejoin Ohio.|$|E
2500|$|Convoy SL 126 {{departed}} Freetown, Sierra Leone on 12 March 1943 {{and arrived}} at Liverpool on 1 April. Empire Bowman was on a voyage from Karachi, India to Hull via Mormugao, India; Durban, South Africa and Freetown. She was carrying a cargo which included 5,791 tons of general cargo and 2,500 tons of manganese ore. On 30 March, Empire Bowman was torpedoed by U-404 at , some [...] northwest of Cape Finisterre. The captain, 39 crewmembers and six DEMS gunners were rescued by [...] and landed at Liverpool. Four crew were killed; they are commemorated on the Tower Hill Memorial. Her Second Engineer, Gordon Love Bastian, rescued two stokers from the sinking ships' <b>flooded</b> <b>engine</b> room at great personal risk.

2500|$|Divers {{worked to}} tunnel under O-5s bow so lifting cables could be attached. Ajax arrived about midnight, and by early morning, the cable tunnel had been dug, the cable run, and a lift was attempted. [...] Sheppard J. Shreaves, {{supervisor}} of the Panama Canal’s salvage crew and himself a qualified diver, had been working continuously throughout the night to dig the tunnel, snake the cable under the submarine, and hook it to Ajax’s hoist. Now the lift began. As the crane took a strain, the lift cables broke. Shreaves and his crew worked another cable set under the bow and again Ajax pulled. Again, the cable broke. All through the day, the men worked. Shreaves {{had been in his}} diving suit nearly 24 hours. As midnight on [...] the 29th approached, the crane was ready for another lift, this time with buoyancy being added by blowing water out of the <b>flooded</b> <b>Engine</b> Room. Then, just after midnight, the bow of O-5 broke the surface. Men from the salvage force quickly opened the torpedo room hatch, and Breault and Brown emerged into the fresh air.|$|E

50|$|The US Army vessel Southern Seas struck an uncharted reef on 22 July 1942 and was {{severely}} damaged with <b>flooded</b> <b>engine</b> rooms and abandoned in Taruia Pass while {{on an island}} charting assignment {{in support of the}} construction. The ship was later salvaged by the Navy and commissioned for naval use.|$|E
50|$|She had {{previously}} suffered another accident when heavy seas had damaged {{one of the}} funnels and water had nearly <b>flooded</b> her <b>engine</b> room. The damage had been repaired but the next one was far more serious.|$|R
50|$|On {{the second}} day after the grounding, the Metula swung to starboard, holing and <b>flooding</b> its <b>engine</b> room compartments. The U.S. Coast Guard, {{at the request of}} the Chilean {{government}} played a role in removing the cargo from the ship.|$|R

50|$|While {{en route}} from Belgium to Portugal on 18 January 2007, during European {{windstorm}} Kyrill, severe gale-force winds and huge waves caused serious damage to Napolis hull, including a crack in {{one side and a}} <b>flooded</b> <b>engine</b> room. The ship was then 50 miles (80 km) off the coast of The Lizard, Cornwall.|$|E
50|$|Liquids {{inside an}} {{internal}} combustion engine are extremely detrimental because of the incompressibility of liquids. Although not the most common cause, a severely <b>flooded</b> <b>engine</b> {{could result in a}} hydrolock. A hydrolock occurs when a liquid fills a combustion chamber {{to the point that it}} is impossible to turn the crankshaft without a catastrophic failure of the engine or one of its vital components.|$|E
50|$|A <b>flooded</b> <b>engine</b> is an {{internal}} combustion engine that has been fed an excessively rich air-fuel mixture that cannot be ignited. This {{is caused by the}} mixture exceeding the upper explosive limit for the particular fuel. An engine in this condition will not start until the excessively rich mixture has been cleared. It is also possible for an engine to stall from a running state due to this condition.|$|E
50|$|At 21:04 Amoco Cadiz ran aground {{the first}} time, <b>flooding</b> its <b>engines,</b> {{and again at}} 21:39, this time ripping open the hull and {{starting}} the oil spill.

50|$|During the Battle of France and Battle of Britain in 1940, RAF pilots {{discovered}} {{a serious problem}} in fighter planes with Merlin engines, such as the Hurricane and Spitfire. When the plane went nose-down to begin a dive, the resulting negative g-force would <b>flood</b> the <b>engine's</b> carburettor, causing the engine to stall.|$|R
50|$|The Quadrajet {{carburetor}} {{was actually}} a derivative of a variable venturi carburetor called the DOVE (diaphragm operated variable entrance) which {{was developed in the}} 1961-63 time frame at Rochester Products. Testing at the GM test facility in Arizona uncovered a hot engine percolation problem which resulted in hot start difficulties because of <b>flooded</b> <b>engines.</b> Production of the DOVE, which was underway in 1963 when the hot start problem was identified, was suspended and a crash project was initiated to fix the problem. Simultaneously a second crash project was initiated to develop a modified DOVE which became the Quadrajet. Prototype Quadrajet carburetors were in test at Rochester Products by the Fall of 1963. The DOVE hot-start problem was corrected but not in a timely enough manner; the production DOVEs were destroyed and the Quadrajet took its place.|$|R
5000|$|NMEs Victoria Segal, however, {{was less}} {{impressed}} with the LP, stating that the album [...] "is a <b>flooded</b> <b>engine</b> of a record". [...] Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian surmised that Going For Gold showed Shed Sevens [...] "real talent" [...] to be [...] "persistence" [...] and thought that the album lacked diversity; [...] "Few of the tracks diverge from the doggedly catchy guitar rockin model set by their first hit, Dolphin".|$|E
50|$|In worst cases, {{the excess}} fuel can foul spark plugs, {{sometimes}} necessitating their cleaning or replacement before the engine will start. This {{is most likely}} to occur on a carbureted engine in cold weather, after a running engine has been shut off briefly before being restarted. Doing so can cause the choke to configure the mixture for a cold engine start, despite higher actual temperatures, resulting in an overly rich mixture and <b>flooded</b> <b>engine.</b>|$|E
50|$|Ouragan {{participated in}} {{operations}} around the British Isles, {{during which she}} suffered storm damage (<b>flooded</b> <b>engine</b> and boiler rooms) {{and a series of}} debilitating technical problems, requiring a total of 194 days under repair (compared to 31 days at sea). On 30 April 1941, after 287 days in Polish service, Ouragan was returned to the Free French Forces, who in turn passed her to the Royal Navy in 1943. She never returned to active operations, was decommissioned on 7 April 1949 and scrapped.|$|E
5000|$|Some silver-brazed joints {{could have}} been sub-standard. One {{or more of these}} joints is {{believed}} to have failed, resulting in <b>flooding</b> in the <b>engine</b> room.|$|R
50|$|McPhee towed {{the vessel}} to England, finding {{on the way}} that someone, {{probably}} disgusted at the squalid conditions aboard and preferring to abandon ship, had purposefully opened the turncocks and <b>flooded</b> the <b>engine</b> room. On McPhee's return to shore with the hulk and her valuable cargo, {{he and his wife}} received twenty-five thousand pounds sterling, and left the oceans.|$|R

50|$|On 11 September 2000, the SeaFrance Monet {{was renamed}} Volcan de Tacande and {{commenced}} service with Armas around the Canary Islands - services included: Los Cristianos - San Sebastian de la Gomera - La Estaca. On a voyage from Los Cristianos to San Sebastián de La Gomera, on 30 January 2005, the vessel lost all power {{due to a}} <b>flooded</b> <b>engine</b> room. All passengers had to be evacuated. Eventually, the vessel was towed to Port of The Palms where she was later declared a total loss.|$|E
50|$|The {{explosion}} {{caused a}} fire in the 3rd magazine, which had to be filled with water, and the 3rd engine was also hit. The ship started to sink on her port side and the angle of list reached 9°, but the situation was stabilized by the captain, who ordered all the turrets to train their barrels to starboard. Although an additional 11 sailors died of wounds, the situation was stabilized and the ship was moved to shallows, where she was to await the ebb tide. After the water was pumped out of the <b>flooded</b> <b>engine</b> room, it was discovered that the hull was pierced across two sections and the hole was approximately 5 m by 15 m.|$|E

50|$|In mid-August 1957, Wantuck got {{underway}} from San Diego for Hawaii on {{the first}} leg of a voyage to Japan. She was about 180 nautical miles (333 kilometers) from San Diego on a moonless and starless night when at 0318 hours on 15 August 1957 the attack transport USS Lenawee (APA-195) rammed her on the port side between the No.1 boiler room and No. 1 engine room, almost tearing Wantuck in half, the impact being powerful enough to bring her forward momentum to an immediate stop and shove her laterally to starboard. Wantuck suffered two men killed—one who drowned in the <b>flooding</b> <b>engine</b> room and another scalded by high-pressure steam—and five injured, all burned. The submarine rescue ship USS Florikan (ASR-9) and fleet ocean tug USS Cree (ATF-84) came to Wantucks aid, while Lenawee took some of Wantucks injured men aboard and proceeded to Pearl Harbor.|$|R

50|$|The {{conventional}} {{remedy for}} a flooded carbureted engine is to steadily hold the throttle full open (full power position) {{while continuing to}} crank the engine. This permits the maximum flow of air through the engine, flushing the overly rich fuel mixture out of the exhaust. If the exhaust system is hot enough to autoignite, an after-fire may result; {{this can be seen}} as a flame discharging through the exhaust system. On a fuel-injected engine, ignoring the throttle (no fuel) while starting permits electronic logic systems to produce the correct fuel mixture, often based on exhaust gases. Some fuel injection computers interpret 'pumping' the throttle to indicate a <b>flooded</b> <b>engine,</b> and alter the fuel-air mixture accordingly. In a carbureted engine equipped with an accelerator pump (which advances fuel flow to match air ingestion under rapid throttle acceleration), 'pumping' the throttle will force excess fuel into the engine, further flooding it.|$|E
50|$|Before Ajax arrived divers {{had already}} dug a tunnel under O-5's bow for Ajax's lifting cables. Ajax arrived around midnight.

Sheppard was a qualified diver, had been working himself all throughout the night helping to dig the tunnel under the submarine. Ajax was hooked to the cables run under the sub and worked to hoist the sub up. But the lift cables broke. Shreaves and his crew installed another cable under the bow. Shreaves and his men had been in their diving suits nearly 24 hours working on the rescue. The next lift the cable broke again. Near midnight on the 29th Ajax did its third lift, this lift worked as the divers has pumped air into the sub's <b>flooded</b> <b>Engine</b> Room. The bow of the O-5 broke the surface.
