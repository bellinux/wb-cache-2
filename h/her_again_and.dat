5|$|While {{pursuing}} the thief, Spyro discovers a world once inhabited by the dragons, but long abandoned and forgotten. This world {{is under the}} iron-fisted reign of the Sorceress and her Rhynoc army. Spyro meets with Shiela the Kangaroo, Sergeant Byrd the Penguin, Bentley the Yeti, and Agent 9 the Monkey who help him on his quest. Shiela tells Spyro how when the dragons left the realm, the world's magic began to dry up.

25|$|Following a brief move to Salt Lake City, Utah, Underwood {{returned}} to Los Angeles, where she found {{work as a}} waitress at the Pig ‘n Whistle restaurant in downtown Los Angeles. One day in April 1920, she was lamenting to Harry Underwood, a co-worker, that her Hollywood relative had resurfaced and demanded that Underwood live with <b>her</b> <b>again</b> <b>and</b> relinquish her paychecks to her, or she would turn the underage girl over to the authorities. Harry {{told her that the}} relative could not do that if he and Underwood were married. The couple married three weeks later on April 28, 1920.|$|E

25|$|In the German tale , Guinevere's brother Gotegrim kidnaps her and {{intends to}} kill her for refusing to marry Gasozein, who claims to be her {{rightful}} husband. In Ulrich von Zatzikhoven's , Valerin, King of the Tangled Wood, claims the right to marry her and carries her off to his castle in a struggle for power that reminds scholars of her prescient connections to the fertility and sovereignty of Britain. Arthur's company saves her, but Valerin kidnaps <b>her</b> <b>again</b> <b>and</b> places her in a magical sleep inside another castle surrounded by snakes, where only the powerful sorcerer Malduc can rescue her. All of these similar tales of abduction by another suitor – and this allegory includes Lancelot, who whisks her away when she is condemned to burn at the stake for their adultery – are demonstrative of a recurring Hades-snatches-Persephone theme, positing that Guinevere {{is similar to the}} Otherworld bride Étaín, who Midir, king of the Underworld, carries off from her earthly life after she has forgotten her past.|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} {{begins with a}} bruised Madonna being dragged by two {{soldiers}} through a dark corridor, and thrown against a chair in a torture chamber. She starts singing the first verse of the song as her captors laugh at her. An alternate scene shows two people fencing inside a white lit chamber, one in black cloths and one in white. Madonna continues groping with the different objects in the torture chamber and dancing.

500|$|In a 2002 Scripps Treasure Coast Publishing interview, Raucher lamented never {{hearing from}} <b>her</b> <b>again</b> <b>and</b> {{expressed}} his {{hope that she}} was still alive. Raucher's novelization of the screenplay, with the dedication, [...] "To those I love, past and present," [...] serves more as the tribute to Seltzer that he had intended the film to be, with the focus of the book being more on the two boys' relationship than Raucher's relationship with Dorothy. Consequently, the book also mentions Seltzer's death, which is absent from the film adaptation.|$|E
500|$|The book Conversations with Woody Allen {{reports that}} {{director}} Woody Allen wanted to cast Downey and Winona Ryder in his film Melinda and Melinda in 2005, {{but was unable}} to do so because he could not get insurance on them, stating, [...] "We couldn't get bonded. The completion bonding companies would not bond the picture unless we could insure them.

500|$|However, {{in two of}} Sonic's TV adaptations (Sonic X and Sonic Boom), their {{feelings}} are explored to a much deeper extent (although this content is not considered canon). Throughout Sonic X, although Sonic usually attempts to repel her advances when {{in the company of}} friends, the two share a handful of intimate moments when alone together. In episode 52, when Sonic returns to Earth, Amy is the first person whom he chooses to visit. In the ensuing conversation, Sonic silently mouths the words [...] "I love you", causing Amy to break into tears of joy, and the two share a very heartfelt moment. This was changed in the English dub, where Amy demands that Sonic never leave <b>her</b> <b>again</b> <b>and</b> Sonic audibly replies that he never will.|$|E

According to the bodyguard, at 10 a.m. he observed her lying on her bed and tried unsuccessfully to rouse her. This did not raise much suspicion because she usually slept late after a night out. According to the bodyguard, shortly after 3pm, he checked on <b>her</b> <b>again</b> <b>and</b> observed her lying in the same position as before, leading to a further check, in which he concluded that she was not breathing and had no pulse. He said he subsequently called emergency services.|$|E

"Open Your Heart" [...] {{has been}} {{featured}} {{as a full}} song in the set lists of three Madonna tours– 1987's Who's That Girl World Tour (1987), Blond Ambition World Tour (1990), and The MDNA Tour (2012). It served as the opening song on 1987 Who's That Girl Tour. It started off with then young dancer Chris Finch, imitating Felix Howard from the video. Howard did not receive a working license for the tour hence Finch was taken for his part. He {{went on to become}} an integral part of most of the songs performed on the tour. After Finch, two other dancers are introduced, before Madonna herself appears on stage. She wore the same black pointy corset and fishnets as in the music video. She first sings the song alone, then Finch joins <b>her</b> <b>again</b> <b>and</b> they dance together till the song ends.

During the Esthar revolution, Laguna and Dr. Odine devised an artifact to cancel the sorceress power, and placed her in suspended animation in outer space. In the present, after Edea is released from Ultimecia's control, Ultimecia possesses the new sorceress, Rinoa, and commands her to free Adel, so she can become Ultimecia's new and more powerful vessel. Adel is successfully freed, so Rinoa is discarded as a host. However, in order to defeat Ultimecia, Dr. Odine plans for Ultimecia to once again possess Rinoa.

500|$|The video {{begins with}} Brown singing {{alone in a}} desert {{in front of a}} sunset backdrop. It then cuts to Brown waking up in a bedroom as he notices a mysterious woman (played by Araya Nicks) walking through the first of three doors behind him. Each door is labeled with hieroglyphics in gold. During the first chorus, Brown follows the woman through the door and enters a garden maze. This scene is intercut with scenes of Brown singing in the desert. He then returns to bed as the woman walks through the second door.

500|$|Ranaut {{achieved}} success {{later in}} 2013 for her portrayal of Kaya, a shapeshifting mutant, in Rakesh Roshan's science fiction film Krrish 3, alongside Hrithik Roshan, Priyanka Chopra and Vivek Oberoi. When Rakesh Roshan first offered the role to her, she declined it due a disappointing prior association {{with him on}} Kites, in which Roshan had served as producer. Following Ranaut's rejection, other actresses also turned down the role. Roshan approached <b>her</b> <b>again</b> <b>and</b> after assuring her that the role {{would not be a}} minuscule one, Ranaut accepted the part. Critics thought that Krrish 3 was entertaining but lacking in originality, though Ranaut's performance garnered praise. The critic Sarita Tanwar of Daily News and Analysis said: [...] "Kangana Ranaut is delightful as an alien making the weird hair and clothes work for her. She even manages to make you feel her pain. Quite an accomplishment that!" [...] With global ticket sales of , the film {{emerged as one of the}} highest-grossing Bollywood films of all time, becoming Ranaut's most financially profitable venture. Also that year, Ranaut played the eponymous lead in the musical drama Rajjo. The film was a critical and commercial failure and Ranaut's portrayal of a nautch girl was largely criticised. Paloma Sharma of Rediff.com commented that [...] "Kangana Ranaut struggles with her Mumbaiyya dialogues and is not as graceful in the dance sequences as one would have expected." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Redux II" [...] {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from critics. Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club awarded the episode an A rating {{and noted that}} [...] "whatever reservations I may have over a three-episode story arc, this final entry {{does a good job}} of re-investing us in the show's basic ideals, returning us to a rough form of the status quo in a way that's exciting, emotionally powerful, and satisfying despite only incremental forward momentum". In addition, Handlen praised David Duchovny's performance, stating that he [...] "was on fire the whole episode". Tom Kessenich praised {{the second part of the}} episode and wrote [...] "'Redux II' is the standout hour of the two without question. With Scully on her deathbed, Mulder meets his sister only to lose <b>her</b> <b>again</b> <b>and</b> is put in a position where he may deal with the devil. The finale moments [...] are quite simply perfect and as good as any the show ever produced." [...] Shearman and Pearson rated the episode two-and-a-half stars out of five. The two noted [...] " [...] is a likable enough little romp, but it's too leisurely to be exciting, too predictable to be revealing, and–most crucially, not really funny enough to be comedy. Vitaris gave the second part of the episode a slightly less negative review than the first, but only awarded it one-and-a-half stars out of four. She criticized the ending, noting that [...] "it's all wrapped up neatly yet ambiguously." [...] However, Vitaris did note that [...] "what makes 'Redux II' tolerable is Duchovny, who always hits the right notes of anger, despair, grief, relief, or emotional numbness." [...] In the 1999 FX Thanksgiving Marathon, containing fan-selected episodes, [...] "Redux II" [...] (along with [...] "Gethsemane" [...] and [...] "Redux") was presented as the [...] "Best Mythology Episode".|$|E
500|$|The show {{started with}} a {{performance}} by Level 42. As their performance ended, the lights started blinking all around the stadium and Finch appears on stage, looking for Madonna. He is followed by two other dancers, who jump around the stage and disappear. Then Madonna's silhouette is visible behind a screen which has paintings by Tamara de Lempicka on it. She performs dance moves behind the screen, which starts going up slowly. She wore a black pointy corset and fishnets like the costume in the music video of [...] "Open Your Heart". After dancing on the stairs, using a chair as a prop, Madonna descends and starts singing the song. Later Finch joins <b>her</b> <b>again</b> <b>and</b> they dance together till the song ends. This {{was followed by the}} performance of [...] "Lucky Star" [...] during which [...] a disco ball spun above the stage; as Madonna and her dancers moved around it, the light from the ball flickered on them like a star. For [...] "True Blue", Madonna came up on the stage wearing a blue, silk taffeta dress over her corset and a blue scarf hidden in her bosom. The stage had a similar blue setting like the original music video. Madonna is backed up by her singers who play her girlfriends. At the end of the song Madonna is asked to dance again by the dancer playing her man in the performance. During [...] "Papa Don't Preach" [...] Madonna wore a black leather jacket over her dress and walked around the stage while singing.

500|$|Mercedes is {{described}} as a [...] "savvy, ballsy girl that can't say no and is unapologetic about it".

These include her marriages to Russ Owen (Stuart Manning), Malachy Fisher (Glen Wallace) and Dr. Paul Browning (Joseph Thompson), with her second marriage involving her in an HIV storyline, an engagement to Riley Costello (Rob Norbury) and a committed relationship with Joe Roscoe (Ayden Callaghan).
