40|$|Indeed, {{every state}} intends {{to explore and}} exploit its mineral {{resources}}. One {{of the ways to}} increasethe area on which states can explore and exploit its mineral resources is by applying the ExtendedContinental Shelf (“ECS”) regime. This research explains the development and regulation of theECS regime which include its requirements, sovereign rights over it, the role of the Commission on theLimits of the Continental Shelf, et cetera. This research then analyzes the ECS regime in Indonesia. This research uses a legal normative research method—which is of an explanatory and descriptiveanalyticalcharacter—and uses primary, secondary, and tertiary data. This research shows thatIndonesia does not have a strong legal basis to apply the ECS regime nor a utilization plan forits ECS. This regime can be applied in north-west of Sumatera, south of Nusa Tenggara, and northof Papua. Indonesia has made a submission for the ECS in North-West Sumatera which has beenaccepted. The writer offers some advice: Indonesia should have <b>further</b> <b>legal</b> <b>basis</b> to apply the ECSregime and a utilization plan for its ECS...|$|E

40|$|The {{choice of}} the <b>legal</b> <b>basis</b> for a given measure can {{influence}} the procedure by which legislation is adopted, and thereby the scope and content of EU policy. The ambiguity surrounding the choice of <b>legal</b> <b>basis</b> for environmental acts based in Articles 130 s and 100 a {{opened the way for}} a 'legal-basis game', where EU institutions chose the <b>legal</b> <b>basis</b> partly on the basis of political considerations. In the period 1987 - 93, the two most important legal bases for environmental acts (Articles 130 s and 100 a) were subject to very different procedures for adoption (unanimity and qualified majority voting, respectively). From 1993 onwards, both articles were subject to qualified majority voting. After a general discussion of the choice of <b>legal</b> <b>basis</b> and its significance for policy, this paper examines the choice of <b>legal</b> <b>basis</b> for environmental legislation during the period 1987 - 99. I conclude that, although the legal-basis game is played out with respect to certain acts, {{there is little evidence that}} it is a regular and systematic feature of the policy process in the EU. ...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{structure}} of legal bases according to competences, instruments, and procedures; as well as <b>legal</b> <b>basis</b> litigation in the European Union {{before and after the}} introduction of the Treaty of Lisbon. Its main contribution lies in the analysis of general criteria for <b>legal</b> <b>basis</b> litigation as they have been developed under supranational EU law. It discovers several flaws inherited in the quest for the correct <b>legal</b> <b>basis</b> on the grounds of overlapping competences, divergent inter-institutional interests, and inconsistencies in the courts’ judgements. In addition, the previous pillar structure of the EU has also led to cross-pillar litigation which is particularly the case in the area of external relations. With the introduction of the Treaty of Lisbon, the previous pillar structure has been abolished and the former third pillar has been integrated into the realm of supranational EU law. While the intergovernmental sphere is thus minimised to the area of common foreign and security policy, <b>legal</b> <b>basis</b> conflicts will continue to occur between this area and the TFEU as well as within the TFEU itself. In addition, the Lisbon Treaty has even created new problems concerning the choice of the correct <b>legal</b> <b>basis,</b> most notably as regards the newly codified competence categories as well as the new hierarchy of legal instruments. This may require the development of new criteria for <b>legal</b> <b>basis</b> litigation in order to guarantee legal certainty in these areas for future cases...|$|R

40|$|This is {{the author}} {{accepted}} manuscript. The final version is available from Brill. The article examines {{the problem of the}} absence of an express <b>legal</b> <b>basis</b> to detain in the law of non-international armed conflict. It considers the attempts to locate the <b>legal</b> <b>basis</b> by way of logical inference either from a putative power to kill in non-international armed conflicts or from the power to detain in international armed conflicts. It also considers teleological and practical arguments posed against the existence of a legal power to detain. It then argues that the preferred interpretation is to view the <b>legal</b> <b>basis</b> to detain as inherent in the law of non-international armed conflict. The existence of an implicit <b>legal</b> <b>basis</b> is consistent with the understandings and expectations of the drafters of Additional Protocol I, as evidenced by a close examination of the travaux préparatoires. Moreover, the post-World War II practice and some modern-day pronouncements corroborate the existence of an inherent <b>legal</b> <b>basis</b> in customary IHL. Finally, in light of the challenges posed by modern conflicts marked by the asymmetry of the parties and by the extraterritoriality of the hostilities, the law of NIAC is far more effective if it is interpreted to contain a legal power to detain than if it is not...|$|R
40|$|Since the {{competence}} {{provided in the}} CFSP and the AFSJ areas in certain situation can overlap, issues have arisen in the recent case law and literature concerning the choice of <b>legal</b> <b>basis.</b> The provisions of the two policy areas concern important international areas and the institutional balance, {{which is based on}} what <b>legal</b> <b>basis</b> is chosen, leads to a number of institutional consequences such as division of power between the Member states and the Union’s institutions. The idea behind this paper is to display an ample and just picture of a complicated situation in order to highlight the issues at hand that have arisen due to the complexness of the legal framework. If one of the policy areas are chosen as the correct <b>legal</b> <b>basis,</b> different rules in the treaty applies, which leads to different distribution of power since different institutions in EU play different roles depending on <b>legal</b> <b>basis.</b> The purpose of this work is therefore to analyse the external dimension of the AFSJ and the CFSP rules and examine how the correct <b>legal</b> <b>basis</b> can be determined by the legislator {{at the same time as}} the Member States and the EU’s ability to fulfil their objectives and goals is not undermined. ...|$|R
