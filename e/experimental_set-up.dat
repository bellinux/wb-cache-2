2500|$|By {{the spring}} of 1935, GEMA's successes {{made it clear to}} Runge that the idea was {{workable}} after all, so he started a crash program at Telefunken to develop radar systems. With Lorenz already making progress on early warning devices, Runge had the Telefunken team concentrate on a short-range gun laying system instead. Management apparently felt it to be as uninteresting as Runge had a year earlier and assigned it a low priority for development. By the summer they had built a working experimental unit in the [...] band that was able to generate strong returns off a target Junkers Ju 52. By the next summer, the <b>experimental</b> <b>set-up</b> had been developed into a prototype known as the Darmstadt, which offered a range accuracy of [...] at , not nearly enough for gun laying. Attitudes changed in late 1938, when a full development contract was received from the Luftwaffe.|$|E
2500|$|O'Shaughnessy's <b>experimental</b> <b>set-up</b> of 1851–52 {{consisted}} of both overhead and underground lines; the latter included underwater ones that crossed two rivers, the Hooghly and the Haldi. [...] The overhead line was constructed by welding uninsulated iron rods, 13½ {{feet long and}} 3/8inch wide, end to end. [...] These lines, which weighed 1,250 pounds per mile, were held aloft by fifteen-foot lengths of bamboo, planted into the ground at equal intervals—200 to the mile—and covered with a layer each of coal tar and pitch for insulation. [...] The underwater cables had been manufactured in England and {{consisted of}} copper wire covered with gutta-percha. [...] Furthermore, {{in order to protect}} the cables from dragging ship anchors, the cables were attached to the links of a [...] chain cable. An underwater cable of length 2,070 yards was laid across the Hooghly river at Diamond Harbour, and another, 1,400 yards long, was laid across the Haldi at Kedgeree.|$|E

2500|$|Milgram argued (in [...] ) {{that the}} ethical {{criticism}} provoked by his experiments was because his findings were disturbing and revealed unwelcome truths about human nature. Others {{have argued that}} the ethical debate has diverted attention from more serious problems with the experiment's methodology. Australian psychologist Gina Perry found an unpublished paper in Milgram's archives that shows Milgram's own concern with how believable the <b>experimental</b> <b>set-up</b> was to subjects involved. Milgram asked his assistant to compile a breakdown of the number of participants who had seen through the experiments. This unpublished analysis indicated that many subjects suspected that the experiment was a hoax, a finding that casts doubt on the veracity of his results. In the journal Jewish Currents, Joseph Dimow, a participant in the 1961 experiment at Yale University, wrote about his early withdrawal as a [...] "teacher", suspicious [...] "that the whole experiment was designed to see if ordinary Americans would obey immoral orders, as many Germans had done during the Nazi period." ...|$|E

The first analyzed architecture can be characterized as a 2 D paper of randomly oriented, entangled single walled CNTs, also called Bucky-paper. In contrast the second investigated architecture consists of highly oriented, vertically aligned multi walled CNTs grown on a substrate of glassy carbon. The results are evaluated according to findings of various other material quality tests in order to find a significant statement for their possible actuation mechanisms...|$|R
