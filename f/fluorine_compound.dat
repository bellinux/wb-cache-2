40|$|This work {{investigates the}} effects of BF; {{implantation}} on the oxidation resistance of copper films. The BFT ions were implanted into Cu films through a 1000 w thick screen SiOl layer. We found that the oxidation resistance of Cu films can be significantly improved by BFT implantation at appropriate conditions. In particular. SF; implantation at 35 to 30 keV to a dose of I- 8 x 10 ” cm- ’ made the Cu films capable of resisting oxidation at temperatures up to 250 °C. At these BF’implantation energies, boron atoms of peak concentration were projected near the Cu surface; thus the diffusion paths of oxidizing species were efficiently blocked. Implantation at too high energy would result in greater depth of projection, thus a lower concentration of boron at the Cu surface; moreover. it generally leads to increased implantation defects that might serve as diffusion paths for the oxidation species. On the other hand, too high dosage implantation would also have an adverse effect on the capability of oxidation resistance for Cu films owing to the higher density of implantation damage {{as well as the}} formation of reactive <b>fluorine</b> <b>compound</b> (CuF?) near the Cu surface. 0 1999 Elsevier Science S.

40|$|By oral {{administration}} of various NaF solutions (drinking) to young rats and feeding {{them under the}} same conditions for 50 days, the author measured the tail length and body weight of these animals in different groups {{in order to see}} the influences of fluorine on their growth and investigated them experimentally; and obtained the following results. Along with this experiments the author also gave orally pills of cod-liver oil containg 0. 2 mg NaF to kindergarten children repeatedly for one year with the purpose to prevent their tooth-decay and examined their height, body weight, and the percentage of incidence of tooth-decay. Mesthod: 1. For the experimental animals young rats of about forty days old and weighing about 50 g were selected, and they were divided into four groups each consisting of five males and five females to the total of ten in each group. They were made to drink freely NaF apueous solution of various concentrations at 1000 ppm, 500 ppm, 100 ppm, 10 ppm, and 2 ppm. The duration of the drinking of NaF was for 50 days. Namely, observations were limited to the stage of the most active growth and changes were observed in that period. 2. As for the drinking expeariment of fluorine with kindergarten children, sugarcoated cod-liver oil pillets containing 0. 2 mg NaF, 0. 02 g cod-liver oil, and 500 γ vitamin B(1) were used. These pillets were given to the children on every school day for one year under a controlled supervision with exception of sundays, holidays, summer and winter vacation. Their height and body weight were measured once every month, and the rate of incidence of tooth-decay in these children was examined twice, namely, once before the start of NaF-administration and once immediately after the cessation of the administration. Results: 1. Although there can be recognized no great difference in the change of the tail length in the growing young rats given NaF aqueous solution by drinking at a low concentration as compared with the control, there is a slight accelerating tendency. In the group of rats given large amount of NaF solution by drinking in comparison with the control there can be recognized no marked difference up to 30 day after the start of taking <b>fluorine</b> <b>compound,</b> but thereafter the rate of tail growth tends to be retarded and by the fiftieth day the tail growth is diminished as compared with the control. 2. In the groups of young growing rats given orally a low concentration of NaF solution their body weight increases normally. However, in the groups given orally a large amount of NaF solution, although no great change can be recognized up to the 30 th day after the start of the experiment, thereafter a decrease in the body weight can be recognized. 3. In the case of the kindergarten children the {{oral administration}} of fluorine in the minimal amount shows a favorable effect on the increase in their height and body weight as compared with the control group without such a treatment. 4. Judging from the rate of the incidence of tooth-decay in the kindergarten chileren as compared with that in the children of the control school where no such treatment was undertaken. the incidence of tooth-decay in these children is far lower than in the control school children.

Finally, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been used to confirm measurements of liquid absorption into a polymeric matrix conducted using Terahertz time-domain spectroscopy. NMR relaxation measurements were combined with PFG diffusion measurements in order to detail the evolution of pore size distribution (PSD), tortuosity, and surface to volume (S/V) ratio of the pore network, for a range of different formulations at increasing immersion times in water. The results clearly show a decrease in the effective tortuosity and S/V ratio with increasing immersion time in all formulations studied. The PSD’s show a corresponding increase in average pore size, as well as changes in the distribution of pore sizes, particularly in the drug-loaded formulations. Coated formulations show a significant differences in the pore structure evolution, compared to the uncoated formulations. Magnetic resonance images of the formulations have been used to calculate the water absorption rates. Studies have been conducted at both room temperature and 37 °C. The water uptake properties were found to vary significantly between the different formulations studied. NMR experiments conducted on a formulation loaded with a <b>fluorine</b> <b>compound</b> were also used to calculate the specific dissolution rate of the compound.

40|$|PURPOSE: Acute hypoxia (transient {{cycles of}} hypoxia-reoxygenation) {{is known to}} occur in solid tumors and may be a poorly {{appreciated}} therapeutic problem {{as it can be}} associated with resistance to radiation therapy, impaired delivery of chemotherapeutic agents, or metastasis development. The objective {{of the present study was}} to use MR 19 F relaxometry maps to analyze the spontaneous fluctuations of partial pressure of oxygen (pO 2) over time in experimental tumors. METHODS: The pO 2 maps were generated after direct intratumoral administration of a <b>fluorine</b> <b>compound</b> (hexafluorobenzene) whose relaxation rate (1 /T 1) is proportional to the % O 2. The authors used a SNAP inversion-recovery sequence at 4. 7 T to acquire parametric images of the T 1 relaxation time with a high spatial and temporal resolution. Homemade routines were developed to perform regions of interest analysis, as well as pixel by pixel analysis of pO 2 over time. RESULTS: The authors were able to quantify and probe the heterogeneity of spontaneous fluctuations in tumor pO 2 : (i) Spontaneous fluctuations in pO 2 occurred regardless of the basal oxygenation state (i. e., both in oxygenated and in hypoxic regions) and (ii) spontaneous fluctuations occurred at a rate of 1 cycle/ 12 - 47 min. For validation, the analysis was performed in dead mice for which acute changes did not occur. The authors thereby demonstrated that 19 F MRI technique is sensitive to acute change in pO 2 in tumors. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first approach that allows quantitative minimally invasive measurement of the spontaneous fluctuations of tumor oxygenation using a look-locker approach (e. g., SNAP IR). This approach could be an important tool to characterize the phenomenon of tumor acute hypoxia, to understand its physiopathology, and to improve therapies...|$|E

Method: Both the rats with fluorine poisoning and control group are sacrificed and the teeth and bones are extracted. Also the milk teeth at the deciduous stage are extracted from kindergarten children treated with NaF for the prevention of tooth-decay. These teeth and bones are cleaned of tooth pulp and bone marrow as much as possible and pulverized.

40|$|Any reactor that {{utilizes}} fuel {{consisting of}} a fissile material in a gaseous state may {{be referred to as}} a gaseous core reactor (GCR). Studies on GCRs have primarily been limited to the conceptual phase, mostly due to budget cuts and program cancellations in the early 1970 's. A few scientific experiments have been conducted on candidate concepts, primarily of static pressure fissile gas filling a cylindrical or spherical cavity surrounded by a moderating shell, such as beryllium, heavy water, or graphite. The main interest in this area of nuclear power generation is for space applications. The interest in space applications has developed due to the promise of significant enhancement in fuel utilization, safety, plant efficiency, special high-performance features, load-following capabilities, power conversion optimization, and other key aspects of nuclear power generation. The design of a successful GCR adapted for use in space is complicated. The fissile material studied in the pa st has been in a <b>fluorine</b> <b>compound,</b> either a tetrafluoride or a hexafluoride. Both of these molecules {{have an impact on the}} structural material used in the making of a GCR. Uranium hexafluoride as a fuel allows for a lower operating temperature, but at temperatures greater than 900 K becomes essentially impossible to contain. This difficulty with the use of UF 6 has caused engineers and scientists to use uranium tetrafluoride, which is a more stable molecule but has the disadvantage of requiring significantly higher operating temperatures. Gas core reactors have traditionally been studied in a steady state configuration. In this manner a fissile gas and working fluid are introduced into the core, called a cavity, that is surrounded by a reflector constructed of materials such as Be or BeO. These reactors have often been described as cavity reactors because the density of the fissile gas is low and criticality is achieved only by means of the reflector to reduce neutron leakage from the core. Still there are problems of containment since many of the proposed vessel materials such as W or Mo have high neutron cross sections making the design of a critical system difficult. There is also the possibility for a GCR to remain in a subcritical state, and by the use of a shockwave mechanism, increase the pressure and temperature inside the core to achieve criticality. This type of GCR is referred to as a shockwave-driven pulsed gas core reactor. These two basic designs were evaluated as advance concepts for space power and propulsion...|$|E
