Immersive virtual reality systems demand notoriously high computational requirements to deliver adequate real-time graphics, leading {{to the emergence of}} commodity clusters for immersive virtual reality. Such clusters deliver the graphics power needed by leveraging the combined power of several computers {{to meet the demands of}} real-time interactive <b>immersive</b> <b>computer</b> <b>graphics.</b> However, the field of commodity cluster-based virtual reality is still in early stages of development and the field is currently adhoc in nature and lacks order. There is no accepted means for comparing approaches and implementers are left with instinctual or trial-and-error means for selecting an approach. This paper provides a classification system that facilitates understanding not only of the nature of different clustering systems but also the interrelations between them. The system is built from a new model for generalized computer graphics applications, which is based on the flow of data through a sequence of operations over the entire context of the application. Prior models and classification systems have been too focused in context and application whereas the system described here provides a unified means for comparison of works within the field.

40|$|The project Wave form, wave {{function}} is conceived as {{an examination of}} the relational dynamics of form and function in contemporary implementations of electronic media in the visual arts. Creative work comprising installation of digital and analogue media equipment, projection of live rendered and pre-programmed <b>immersive</b> <b>computer</b> <b>graphics,</b> high energy kinetic and video sculpture - in relational configurations, leads the research. The electronic media being intrinsically signals based, consideration is given to a broad definition of the signal encompassing electronic analogue waveforms, digital encodings, programmatic flow control structures and semiotic and language based signal exchange. The electronic media are considered as rhetorical devices that use an expanded language of visual and procedural rhetoric in their processes. The project is premised on a position that considers scientific realism to be a questionable basis for understanding. Quantum physics has demonstrated the entanglements of matter and energy, of object and observer, as relational and transmissible, somewhat magical processes. In this context aspects of form and function in the produced artwork are discussed as poietic work, the process of engaging in ongoing cultural discourse that is world building. A poetic license is allowed in translating between the literal and literary as Scientific Realist and socially constructed models of reality are compared. Noesis, knowing and being in the world, is examined for how contemporary artists employ technoesis, that is cultural production through technological media. Such work is considered as sympoietic, evoking symbiotic, hybrid modes of poiesis. Working with contemporary electronic media in the visual arts entails a grasp {{of the nature of the}} medium that extends to the metaphysical...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a framework for}} generating and interacting with the line congruences associated with four general finite poses. These line congruences are the solution space of spatial 4 C mechanisms which will guide a workpiece through the four prescribed poses. Hence, the contributions of this paper are applicable to developing interactive tools for designing spatial 4 C mechanisms for four pose motion generation. First, a methodology for generating a parameterized representation of the line congruences is reviewed. This is followed by strategies for visually repre-senting the line congruences which are appropriate for both workstation and <b>immersive</b> virtual reality <b>computer</b> <b>graphics.</b> Next, strategies and supporting algorithms for interacting with the line congruences to obtain solution mecha-nisms with fixed links or coupler links in desired regions of the workspace are presented. The result is an intuitive interactive visual design methodology for generat-ing and interacting with the line congruences associated with four general finite spatial poses. Our hope is that this tool will in turn facilitate the creation of both virtual reality and workstation-based computer-aided design software for spatial 4 C mechanism design. ...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{innovative}} {{technologies for}} {{the presentation of}} complex cultural heritage sites with <b>immersive</b> 3 D <b>computer</b> <b>graphics</b> are introduced, {{which are based on}} new concepts, partly having been adopted from other <b>computer</b> <b>graphics</b> areas to the specific needs for cultural heritage presentations, partly having been developed especially for this purpose. The main focus of this project was to develop new concepts for the integration of historical, architectural, and cultural data related to a cultural heritage site, into an immersive Virtual Reality (VR) Environment suited for presentation of the digital model. ~hese concepts include digital storytelling, virtual 3 D avatars and 3 D agents. The 3 D avatar was implemented as a virtual tourist guide, who accompanies the visitors on their tour and shows them the places of interest. Furthermore, specifics of the very detailed and complex digital models of cultural heritage sites are addressed, {{in order to meet the}} high quality requirements of an interactive 3 D visualisation. Special focus has been put on both the frame rate and the visual quality. Beside Level-of-detail mechanisms, texture-paging techniques have been developed to allow the use of very high resolution textures. Lighting simulation based on radiosity simulation, which ensure a high visual quality, have been extended for the efficient simulation of global illumination effects within very complex models. These new concepts and techniques have been successfully applied in the immersive VR presentation of a digital model of the cathedral of Siena, which has been shown to the public during the EXP...|$|R

40|$|Abstract This paper {{presents}} {{a framework for}} generating, representing, and in-teracting with the line congruences associated with four general finite poses. These line congruences are the solution space of spatial 4 C mech-anisms which will guide a moving body through the four prescribed poses. Hence, the contributions of this paper are applicable to develop-ing interactive tools for designing spatial 4 C mechanisms for four pose motion generation. Moreover, the strategies employed to address this difficult interactive visualization challenge are presented. The goal here being to facilitate future works which address other interactive visual-ization challenges. First, a methodology for generating a parameterized representation of the line congruences is reviewed. This is followed by strategies for vi-sually representing the line congruences which are appropriate for both workstation and <b>immersive</b> virtual reality <b>computer</b> <b>graphics.</b> Next, strategies and supporting algorithms for interacting with the line con-gruences to obtain solution mechanisms with fixed links or coupler links in desired regions of the workspace are presented. The result is an intuitive interactive visual design methodology for generating and in-teracting with the line congruences associated with four general finite spatial poses for spatial 4 C mechanism design. It is our desire that this effort, albeit focused upon the challenge of creating computer-aided de-sign environments for spatial 4 C mechanisms, will facilitate as well as motivate other efforts to address the inherent visualization and inter-action challenges in designing three dimensional mechanical systems...|$|R
