40|$|ABSTRACT Recurring {{priapism}} {{is rare in}} pre-pubertal {{children and}} {{may be attributed to}} multiple causes. We propose that voiding dysfunction (VD) may also justify this symptom and detail a clinical case of recurring stuttering priapism associated to overactive bladder that completely resolved after usage of anticholinergics and urotherapy. Sacral parasympathetic activity is responsible for detrusor contraction and for spontaneous <b>erections</b> and a relationship between <b>erections</b> and bladder status has been proved in healthy subjects (morning <b>erections)</b> and models of medullar trauma. High bladder pressures and/or volumes, voiding incoordination and posterior urethritis can potentially trigger reflex <b>erections...</b>|$|R

5|$|Penis pumps induce erections {{without the}} need for drugs or {{invasive}} treatments. To use a pump, the man inserts his penis into a cylinder, then pumps it to create a vacuum which draws blood into the penis, making it erect. He then slides a ring from the outside of the cylinder onto the base of the penis to hold the blood in and maintain the <b>erection.</b> A man who is able to get an <b>erection</b> but has trouble maintaining it for long enough can use a ring by itself. The ring cannot be left on for more than 30 minutes and cannot be used {{at the same time as}} anticoagulant medications.|$|E

40|$|Penile <b>erections</b> are a {{characteristic}} phenomenon of paradoxical sleep (PS), or {{rapid eye movement}} sleep. Although the neural mechanisms of PS-related <b>erections</b> are unknown, the forebrain likely plays a critical role (Schmidt et al., 1999). The preoptic area is implicated in both sleep generation and copulatory mechanisms, suggesting {{it may be a}} primary candidate in PS erectile control. Continuous recordings of penile <b>erections,</b> body temperature, and sleep–wake states were performed before and up to 3 weeks after ibotenic acid lesions of the preoptic forebrain in three groups of rats. Neurotoxic lesions involving the medial preoptic area (MPOA) and anterior hypothalamus (n � 5) had no significant effects on either erectile activity or sleep–wake architecture. In contrast, bilateral lesions of the lateral preoptic region, with (n � 4) or without (n � 5) MPOA involvement, resulted in a significant {{decrease in the number of}} <b>erections</b> per hour of PS...|$|R
5|$|The Battle of Salamis is {{proposed}} by modern scholars {{as one of}} three possible naval battles—along with the Battle of Amorgos (322 BC) and the Battle of Cos (261/255 BC)—that provided the occasion for the <b>erection</b> {{of the statue of}} the Nike of Samothrace.|$|E
5|$|The main {{contractor}} was Hamilston's Windsor Ironworks Company Limited of Garston, Liverpool. They were tasked with the founding and <b>erection</b> {{of the pier}} cylinders on the riverbed, and the <b>erection</b> and riveting of the twenty-one bowstring spans and the swing bridge over the Gloucester and Sharpness Canal. They were also responsible for another swing bridge on the North Docks Branch of the line close to the New Docks at Sharpness. The company manufactured the castings and the wrought iron structures for the bridge. Project manager George Earle was later given a watch praising his ability and enthusiasm for carrying out the project. The engineers for the project were George Wells Owen and George William Keeling.|$|E

40|$|The role of androgens in the {{sexuality}} of men {{is still}} not completely clear. Men with severe hyperprolactinaemia frequently show mild hypogonadism, and many complain of loss of libido and penile erectile dysfunction (ED). We studied the night-sleep related <b>erections</b> and the penile response to visual erotic stimuli (VES) in 44 men: 13 with severe hypogonadism (Group 1; serum testosterone less than 1. 4 ng/ml), 10 with mild hypogonadism (Group 2; serum testosterone 2 - 3. 5 ng/ml), nine with severe hyperprolactinaemia and mild hypogonadism (Group 3) and 12 control men (Group 4). All of the patients complained of loss of libido and ED. Group 1 showed significantly impaired night <b>erections</b> when compared {{with any of the}} other three groups, but no differences were detected between Groups 2, 3, and 4. The penile response to VES did not show any significant difference between the four groups, but was lower in Group 1 than in Group 4. These data confirm that night <b>erections</b> are androgen-dependent, but also suggest that there are two thresholds for serum testosterone: one below which sexual behaviour is impaired with normal night <b>erections,</b> and a lower threshold below which night <b>erections</b> are also impaired. The penile response to VES was confirmed as being only partially androgen-independent. Furthermore, hyperprolactinaemia does not affect night <b>erections</b> or the penile response to VES, suggesting that its effect on libido and sexual behaviour is due mainly to modulation of the psychological pattern of the patient...|$|R

5|$|According {{to another}} legend, two Parmars from Malwa, named Govinddas and Madhavdas, took up their haunt among the rush grass {{that covered the}} {{neighbourhood}} of the Rudra Mahalaya, and lived by plunder.

5|$|An {{example of}} a {{medicinal}} enzyme inhibitor is sildenafil (Viagra), a common treatment for male erectile dysfunction. This compound is a potent inhibitor of cGMP specific phosphodiesterase type 5, the enzyme that degrades the signalling molecule cyclic guanosine monophosphate. This signalling molecule triggers smooth muscle relaxation and allows blood flow into the corpus cavernosum, which causes an <b>erection.</b> Since the drug decreases {{the activity of the}} enzyme that halts the signal, it makes this signal last {{for a longer period of}} time.|$|E

40|$|Further {{evidence}} that nocturnal <b>erections</b> are androgen-dependent and erectile responses to visual erotic stimuli are androgen-independent is presented from six men with secondary hypogonadism and six eugonadal controls. <b>Erections</b> during sleep were substantially {{less in the}} hypogonadal men, {{in terms of both}} tumescence and rigidity. In response to visual erotic stimuli, the percentage increase in circumference over baseline and the increase in rigidity were similar for the two groups...|$|R
40|$|Penile <b>erections</b> were {{regularly}} induced by intermittent subcutaneous injections of apomorphine in five patients with Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 s disease (PD) complicated by motor fluctuations. Four {{of the patients}} reported erectile dysfunction before beginning apomorphine and mio of these report a significant improvement in their sexual function resulting from apomorphine use. Animal studies suggest central D 2 -type dopamine receptor stimulation and oxytocin release from the paraven tricular nucleus of the hypothalamus mediate the effect, <b>Erections</b> reported with other dopamine agonists and levodopa are probably mediated by the same mechanism. Apomorphine-induced <b>erections</b> in PD are probably more common than previously thought.
