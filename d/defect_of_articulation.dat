50|$|In some languages, allophonic palatalization {{developed}} into phonemic palatalization by phonemic split. In other languages, phonemes that were originally phonetically palatalized changed further: palatal secondary place <b>of</b> <b>articulation</b> {{developed into}} changes in manner <b>of</b> <b>articulation</b> or primary place <b>of</b> <b>articulation.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Often the {{resulting}} sound has the place <b>of</b> <b>articulation</b> <b>of</b> {{one of the}} source sounds and the manner <b>of</b> <b>articulation</b> <b>of</b> the other. An example comes from Malay, where the final consonant of the prefix [...] (where N stands for a [...] "placeless nasal", i.e. a nasal with no specified place <b>of</b> <b>articulation)</b> coalesces with a voiceless stop {{at the beginning of}} the root to which the prefix is attached. The resulting sound is a nasal that has the place <b>of</b> <b>articulation</b> <b>of</b> the root-initial consonant. For example: ...|$|R
50|$|It {{may also}} cause a {{consonant}} {{to change its}} manner <b>of</b> <b>articulation</b> from stop to affricate or fricative. The change in the manner <b>of</b> <b>articulation</b> {{is a form of}} lenition. However, the lenition is frequently accompanied by a change in place <b>of</b> <b>articulation.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... the {{assimilation}} of the place <b>of</b> <b>articulation</b> <b>of</b> one speech sound to that of an adjacent speech sound. For example, while the sound [...] of English normally has an alveolar place <b>of</b> <b>articulation,</b> in the word tenth it is pronounced with a dental place <b>of</b> <b>articulation</b> because the following sound, , is dental.|$|R

5|$|The pulmonic {{consonant}} table, {{which includes}} most consonants, is arranged in rows that designate manner <b>of</b> <b>articulation,</b> meaning how the consonant is produced, and columns that designate place <b>of</b> <b>articulation,</b> meaning {{where in the}} vocal tract the consonant is produced. The main chart includes only consonants with a single place <b>of</b> <b>articulation.</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{linguistics}} (articulatory phonetics), articulation {{refers to}} how the tongue, lips, jaw, vocal cords, and other speech organs used to produce sounds are used to make sounds. Speech sounds are categorized by manner <b>of</b> <b>articulation</b> and place <b>of</b> <b>articulation.</b> Place <b>of</b> <b>articulation</b> refers to where the airstream in the mouth is constricted. Manner <b>of</b> <b>articulation</b> refers to {{the manner in which}} the speech organs interact, such as how closely the air is restricted, what form of airstream is used (e.g. pulmonic, implosive, ejectives, and clicks), whether or not the vocal cords are vibrating, and whether the nasal cavity is opened to the airstream. The concept is primarily used for the production of consonants, but can be used for vowels in qualities such as voicing and nasalization. For any place <b>of</b> <b>articulation,</b> there may be several manners <b>of</b> <b>articulation,</b> and therefore several homorganic consonants.|$|R
25|$|Izi {{contains}} 26 consonant phonemes classified {{under six}} manners <b>of</b> <b>articulation</b> and five places <b>of</b> <b>articulation</b> which {{are shown in}} the chart below. Consonants are also distinguished by voicing. Both voiced and voiceless stops occur in labial, alveolar, velar, and labio-velar places <b>of</b> <b>articulation.</b> There are also corresponding nasals {{for each of these}} places <b>of</b> <b>articulation.</b> Fricatives are always labials, alveolars, and velars; affricates are always labials and alveolars. Izi has both a lateral and non-lateral liquid, but some speakers replace the non-lateral with the lateral liquid.|$|R
40|$|Unlike {{most of the}} world's languages, Korean distinguishes {{three types}} of voiceless stops, namely lenis, fortis, and {{aspirated}} stops.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the Hangulphabet, a new writing system that should prove useful {{in a number}} of contexts. Using the Hangulphabet, a user can instantly see voicing, manner and place <b>of</b> <b>articulation</b> <b>of</b> any phoneme found in human language. The Hangulphabet places consonant graphemes on a grid with the x-axis representing the place <b>of</b> <b>articulation</b> and the y-axis representing manner <b>of</b> <b>articulation.</b> Each individual grapheme contains radicals from both axes where the points intersect. The top radical represents manner <b>of</b> <b>articulation</b> where the bottom represents place <b>of</b> <b>articulation.</b> A horizontal line running through the middle of the bottom radical represents voicing. For vowels, place <b>of</b> <b>articulation</b> is located on a grid that represents the position of the tongue in the mouth. This grid {{is similar to that of}} the IPA vowel chart (International Phonetic Association, 1999). The difference with the Hangulphabet being the trapezoid representing the vocal apparatus is on a slight tilt. Place <b>of</b> <b>articulation</b> for a vowel is represented by a breakout figure from the grid. This system can be used as an alternative to the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) or as a complement to it. Beginning students of linguistics may find it particularly useful. A Hangulphabet font has been created to facilitate switching between the Hangulphabet and the IPA...|$|R

5000|$|Clusters must be of {{the same}} manner <b>of</b> <b>articulation</b> so that, e.g. , , and [...] are permitted, but , , and [...] are not. Where the {{morphology}} of Inuktitut places such incompatible consonants together, they are either replaced by a geminated consonant - in effect, total assimilation - or as a single consonant that takes its manner <b>of</b> <b>articulation</b> from one segment, and its place <b>of</b> <b>articulation</b> from the other. The process of eliminating three-segment clusters is similar {{with one of them}} disappearing. As a general rule, assimilation in Inuktitut is regressive - the first consonant takes its manner <b>of</b> <b>articulation</b> from the second consonant. But this varies amongst different dialects; the West Greenland dialect in particular tends to use progressive assimilation - the second consonant takes the manner <b>of</b> <b>articulation</b> from the first.|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the contrastive analysis of the frequency system of common standard Persian and English consonants. Two corpora were selected from Iranian newspapers. One of them is Keyhan newspaper that is published in Persian and the other one is Tehran Times newspaper that goes under press in English in Iran.  Common standard Persian and English consonants were enumerated and analyzed by themselves and with respect to parts of speech, manner <b>of</b> <b>articulation</b> and place <b>of</b> <b>articulation.</b> Results indicated {{a significant difference between the}} frequency of eleven Persian consonants and their English counterparts. Nouns comprised the highest frequency of consonants and while prepositions, determiners and conjunctions had the lowest. With respect to manner <b>of</b> <b>articulation,</b> there was a significant difference between both languages in all manners with stops as the most frequent in both. As for the place <b>of</b> <b>articulation,</b> there was a significant difference between both languages and alveolars were the most frequent in both. Regarding manner <b>of</b> <b>articulation,</b> English stops and liquids were more frequent than those of Persian. With respect to place <b>of</b> <b>articulation,</b> just English alveolars were more frequent than the Persian ones. The frequency of all other places was higher in Persian. In spite of frequent differences between both languages, many similarities were also identified in terms of their frequency systems, and the frequency of consonants with respect to parts of speech, manner <b>of</b> <b>articulation</b> and place <b>of</b> <b>articulation...</b>|$|R

For this study, we selected eight stratified informants distributed by gender (male and female) and age (young and adults). Based on the Theory of Variation and Change, we analyzed the following linguistic factors: vowel of the stressed syllable, vowel between the vowel of the variable and the stressed one, manner <b>of</b> <b>articulation</b> <b>of</b> the preceding segment, place <b>of</b> <b>articulation</b> <b>of</b> the preceding segment, manner <b>of</b> <b>articulation</b> <b>of</b> the next segment and place <b>of</b> <b>articulation</b> <b>of</b> the next segment. We establish that in the city of Ouro Branco occurs vowel harmony triggered by the following high vowel, both for the raising of /e/, and for the raising of /o/. We conclude that for the raising of /o/, occurs also the process of vowel reduction. We also observed that there are lexical restrictions...|$|R
