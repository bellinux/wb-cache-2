The results of the study are used to construct a By-dependent global convection model for southward IMF. A significant element of the model is the coexistence of three types of convection cells ('merging cells', 'viscous cells', and 'lobe cells'). This model can account for observations of a nearly stationary (in local time) convection 'throat', a sunward-antisunward convection reversal zone at the polar-cap boundary in both the morning and afternoon quadrants, the morphology of solar-wind ion injection and transport in the mid-altitude polar cusp, and the By-dependent dawn-dusk asymmetry of polar-cap electron fluxes...|$|R
40|$|We <b>explorer</b> <b>dynamics</b> of cosmological {{models with}} a non-minimally coupled scalar field {{evolving}} on a spatially flat Friedmann–Lemâıtre–Robertson–Walker background. We consider cosmological models including the Hilbert–Einstein curvature term and the N degree monomial of the scalar field non-minimally coupled to gravity. The {{potential of the}} scalar field is the n degree monomial or polynomial. We describe several qualitatively different types of dynamics depending on values of power indices N and n. We identify that three main possible pictures correspond to n 2 N cases. Some special features connected with the important cases of N = n (including quadratic potential with quadratic coupling) and n = 2 N (which share its asymptotics with {{the potential of the}} Higgs-driven inflation) are described separately. A global qualitative analysis allows us to cover most interesting cases of small N and n by a limiting number of phase-space diagrams. The influence of the cosmological constant to the global features of dynamics is also studied. ...|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn {{the early}} 2000 s a Land Parcel Identification System (LPIS) {{was set up}} by each member state of theEuropean Union, to manage {{agricultural}} subsidies. These databases describe field geometry and landcover,and provide information on farm characteristics. LPIS data could therefore be used to describe agriculturallandscape dynamics, but are seldom put to this purpose by scientists and local stakeholdersbecause it requires the use of GIS software and programming skills. The objective of this paper is thusto present RPG Explorer, a new tool that we developed to analyze agricultural landscape dynamics withLPIS data. RPG Explorer doesn’t require any specific skills in GIS and programming allowing non specialistto deal with complex data. RPG Explorer includes a first module which computes the changes in crop proportions and farm characteristics(numbers of farm, farm area, farm type). A second module computes crop sequences on eachfarmer block of LPIS data. We also included a crop rotation model in a third module. We illustrated the use of RPG Explorer for two example neighboring catchments located in westernFrance, the Vivier catchment (16, 000 ha) and the Courance catchment (15, 000 ha). For example, RPGExplorer easily revealed the evolution of crop proportions, such as the increase of temporary grasslandsin the Courance catchment (from 7. 2 % of the Utilized Agricultural Area (UAA) in 2007 to 11. 7 % in 2013). The number of farms was also shown to vary a lot: from 230 in 2007 to 207 in 2013 for the Vivier catchment,with a subsequent increase of their mean UAA (from 101 ha to 119 ha). RPG Explorer also showedthat {{more than half of the}} Vivier catchment UAA (59 %) was occupied by only 50 farms in 2013. Concerning crop sequences, the sunflower ! winter wheat sequence was the most frequent 2 -yearsequence in both catchments, but some differences appeared with for example, a higher proportion ofwinter wheat ! winter wheat sequence in the Courance catchment (7. 2 % against 3. 6 %). Crop rotationmodeling indicated that the rapeseed !winter wheat!sunflower!winter wheat, sunflower !winterwheat and maize monoculture were the three main crop rotations. Finally, these examples illustrate well the ability for scientist and local stakeholders to easily describesome major agricultural landscape <b>dynamics</b> with RPG <b>Explorer...</b>|$|R

50|$|Both {{spacecraft}} had a polygonal shape, {{and were}} approximately 137 cm {{in diameter and}} 115 cm high. Each also had a 200-cm radio antenna and two 6-meter booms which were needed to distance some of the equipment from {{the main body of}} the spacecraft. They were stacked on top of each other and launched aboard a Delta 3000 booster rocket. Upon reaching orbit, the two spacecraft departed from the booster and entered separate orbits. <b>Dynamics</b> <b>Explorer</b> 1 was placed into a high altitude elliptical orbit, while DE-2 was put into a lower orbit that was also more circular.|$|E

He specialised in remote sensing of the atmosphere using Fabry-Pérot interferometers to measure thermospheric wind speeds and temperatures to assess their relationship to the Interplanetary Magnetic Field.

40|$|Plasma {{measurements}} {{from the}} <b>Dynamics</b> <b>Explorer</b> 1 and 2 satellites {{were used to}} characterize the polar cap environment. Analysis of numerous polar-cap passes indicate that, in general, three major regimes of plasma exist: (1) polar rain [...] electrons with magnetosheath-like energy spectra but much lower densities, most intense near the cusp and weakening toward the central polar cap; (2) polar wind [...] low energy upward flowing ions with both field-aligned and conical distributions; and (3) acceleration events [...] sporadic events consistent with the acceleration of electrons and positive ions by parallel electric fields. (1) to (3) were observed at high altitudes by <b>Dynamics</b> <b>Explorer</b> 1, while (1) and (3) were also observed at low altitudes by <b>Dynamics</b> <b>Explorer</b> 2.
