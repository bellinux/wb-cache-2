40|$|The {{current study}} {{assessed}} {{the performance of}} a patient with right neglect (M. A. H.) across various manipulations of the <b>flanker</b> paradigm. When required to identify a central target {{in the presence of a}} unilateral <b>flanker,</b> M. A. H. responded to the <b>flanking</b> distractor on the left (ipsilesional) side as if it were the target, even when the <b>flanker</b> appeared at left peripheral locations. A right (contralesional) <b>flanker</b> did not affect central identification performance (Experiment 1). The "ipsilesional capture" effect persisted when pretrial location markers were introduced to make the <b>flanker</b> and target locations more clearly defined (Experiment 2). However, when the ipsilesional <b>flanker</b> appeared simultaneously with a contralesional <b>flanker,</b> central target detection improved to ceiling (Experiment 3). Interestingly, with these three-stimulus displays, congruency effects in reaction time only occurred in relation to the <b>flanker</b> on the contralesional side (Experiment 3), suggesting impaired response selectivity to ipsilesional stimuli. Congruency effects were produced on both sides only when the two <b>flanking</b> distractors grouped together (by both onset and offset, Experiment 4) and when the ipsilesional <b>flanking</b> distractor grouped with the target by onset (lone contra offset, Experiment 4). The results are attributed to ipsilesional capture in central target detection, which is offset by temporal grouping processes when another stimulus appears on the contralateral side...|$|R

40|$|Word {{reading speed}} in {{peripheral}} vision is slower when words are {{in close proximity}} of other words (Chung, 2004). This word crowding effect could arise {{as a consequence of}} interaction of low-level letter features between words, or the interaction between high-level holistic representations of words. We evaluated these two hypotheses by examining how word crowding changes for five configurations of <b>flanking</b> words: the control condition - <b>flanking</b> words were oriented upright; scrambled - letters in each <b>flanking</b> word were scrambled in order; horizontal-flip - each <b>flanking</b> word was the left-right mirror-image of the original; letter-flip - each letter of the <b>flanking</b> word was the left-right mirror-image of the original; and vertical-flip - each <b>flanking</b> word was the up-down mirror-image of the original. The low-level letter feature interaction hypothesis predicts similar word crowding effect for all the different <b>flanker</b> configurations, while the high-level holistic representation hypothesis predicts less word crowding effect for all the alternative <b>flanker</b> conditions, compared with the control condition. We found that oral reading speed for words <b>flanked</b> above and below by other words, measured at 10 ° eccentricity in the nasal field, showed the same dependence on the vertical separation between the target and its <b>flanking</b> words, for the various <b>flanker</b> configurations. The result was also similar when we rotated the <b>flanking</b> words by 90 ° to disrupt the periodic vertical pattern, which presumably is the main structure in words. The remarkably similar word crowding effect irrespective of the <b>flanker</b> configurations suggests that word crowding arises as a consequence of interactions of low-level letter features. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R

40|$|The {{presence}} of <b>flanking</b> targets can impair depth discrimination, presumably through {{a form of}} lateral interaction or visual crowding. This study investigates how stereoscopic crowding interferes with foveal depth discrimination when tests and <b>flanking</b> stimuli of different spatial configuration are located {{on and off the}} horopter in normal subjects by using psychophysical means. The magnitude of crowding increased when the <b>flanking</b> bars were in close spatial proximity to the test, between 1 to 2 arc min, and returned to unflanked levels for wider separations of 4 arc min and beyond. The magnitude of crowding depended {{on the extent to which}} the test and the <b>flanking</b> bars width matched. When flankers were placed at the optimum crowding distance (OCD) and displaced off the horopter, crowding reduced but the <b>flanker</b> effect was restored at greater <b>flanker</b> disparity. On the contrary, flankers positioned at the least crowding distance (LCD) at the onset generally showed an increase in thresholds from the fixation plane with increasing <b>flanker</b> disparity. Crowding was produced at similar small test- <b>flanker</b> separation for the range of 0. 5 to 4 cpd <b>flanker</b> spatial frequency composition used. The magnitude of crowding was greater for test and <b>flanker</b> of similar spatial frequency, though some crowding was produced when their spatial frequency differed. Overall, the results confirm previous reports showing that depth discrimination thresholds increase in the {{presence of}} <b>flanking</b> contours, but in addition suggest that disparity integration relative to the fixation demonstrates a dichotomy of fine and coarse mechanisms driven by salience attraction. Additionally, the results show that the crowding effect can be reduced by depth cues related to the width, and disparity of <b>flanking</b> stimuli. The crowding effect may be attributed to the action of local disparity interactions, but suggest the involvement of Gestalt factors (for larger <b>flanker</b> widths) and luminance flux (for thinner <b>flanker</b> widths) factors...|$|R

5|$|The female {{is similar}} in {{appearance}} to the male, but may be identified by her slightly paler upperparts, a browner eyestripe and a more washed-out tone to the <b>flanks</b> and lower belly. In the eastern form, S.e.asiatica, some males have buff underparts like the female, and birds with this appearance are difficult to sex in the field. Young birds resemble the female, although their plumage is duller and they have paler legs.

5|$|There is no {{evidence}} that auxiliary infantry fought in a looser order than legionaries. It appears that in a set-piece battle-line, auxiliary infantry would normally be stationed on the <b>flanks,</b> with legionary infantry holding the centre e.g. as in the Battle of Watling Street (AD 60), the final defeat of the rebel Britons under queen Boudicca. This was a tradition inherited from the Republic, when the precursors of auxiliary cohortes, the Latin alae, occupied the same position in the line.

5|$|Acting on Ridgway's prediction, the ROK Army Headquarters {{ordered all}} units to full alert at dusk on December 31, {{but many of}} its {{soldiers}} were either drunk from the New Year celebration or had abandoned their posts in order to escape the cold. The Chinese artillery units began to shell the South Korean defenses at 16:30 on December 31. The first blow fell on the ROK 12th Regiment of the 1st Infantry Division, due to the unit's positioning as both {{the boundary between the}} ROK 1st and 6th Infantry Divisions and the boundary between US I and IX Corps. Because the river banks on ROK 12th Regiment's <b>flanks</b> were composed of high cliffs difficult for the attackers to scale, most of the regiment's strength were used to defend its center. Upon noticing this development, the PVA 39th Corps decided to use ROK 12th Regiment's <b>flanks</b> as the main points of attack in order to achieve maximum surprise. Following a feint attack on the ROK 12th Regiment's center, the PVA 116th and the 117th Divisions of the 38th Corps struck both <b>flanks</b> of the ROK 12th Regiment. The ROK 12th Regiment was caught off guard and offered little resistance, and within hours the regiment was cut to pieces with a battery of the US 9th Field Artillery Battalion seized by the Chinese. Under the cover of the fleeing Korean soldiers, the attacking Chinese forces then penetrated the ROK 15th Regiment's defense without firing a shot. Desperate to contain the Chinese breakthrough, Brigadier General Paik Sun Yup of the ROK 1st Infantry Division used the division's rear service personnel to form an assault battalion, but the battalion was unable to stop the Chinese advance. With only the ROK 11th Regiment remaining intact by the morning of January 1, the ROK 1st Infantry Division was forced to withdraw on January 2.|$|E
