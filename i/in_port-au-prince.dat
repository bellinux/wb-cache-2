By this time, the ship {{was in need of}} a refit in Germany, and met with her replacement, Karlsruhe, <b>in</b> <b>Port-au-Prince,</b> Haiti, the following day. Lüdecke, who had arrived in command of Karlsruhe, traded places with Köhler aboard Dresden. The Admiralstab initially ordered Dresden to return to Germany for overhaul, but the heightened threat of war by the 31st led the staff to countermand the order, instead instructing Lüdecke to prepare to conduct Handelskrieg (trade war) in the Atlantic.|$|E

5|$|South Carolina {{then took}} part in {{training}} exercises off Culebra Island.

5|$|The {{floods and}} mudslides killed {{many people in}} Haiti, {{although}} the exact total will likely never be known. On November19, officials reported 531deaths, and by two days later the total was potentially as high as 2,000. On November24, the death toll reached 824, and the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs reported on December21 that Gordon killed 1,122people in the country. Most of the deaths occurred <b>in</b> <b>Port-au-Prince,</b> Jacmel, and Léogâne. Damage was heavier in Haiti than elsewhere along Gordon's track due to poor infrastructure consisting of shacks on flood-prone denuded hills. The country suffers large death tolls from many hurricanes, caused in part by human activity. Large-scale deforestation left Haiti with about 1.4% of its forests as of 2004, leaving denuded mountain slopes that allows rainwater to wash down unimpeded. The lack of tree cover contributed to the devastating floods that caused most of Gordon's deaths.|$|E
