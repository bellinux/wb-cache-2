5|$|Metal armour was {{of limited}} {{use in the}} hot, wet {{tropical}} climate. It was heavy {{and had to be}} constantly cleaned to prevent rusting; <b>in</b> <b>direct</b> <b>sunlight,</b> metal armour became unbearably hot. Conquistadores often went without metal armour, or only donned it immediately prior to battle. They were quick to adopt quilted cotton armour based upon that used by their native opponents, and commonly combined this {{with the use of a}} simple metal war hat. Shields were considered essential by both infantry and cavalry; generally this was a circular target shield, convex in form and fashioned from iron or wood. Rings secured it to the arm and hand.|$|E
5|$|The {{flowers of}} sundews, as with nearly all {{carnivorous}} plants, are held {{far above the}} leaves by a long stem.This physical isolation of the flower from the traps was originally thought to be an adaptation meant to avoid trapping potential pollinators; a recent study, however, indicated Drosera species attract distinct types of insects as pollinators and prey, with little overlap. Instead, the tall flower stalks probably help raise the flowers to a height where they are noticeable to pollinators. The mostly unforked inflorescences are spikes, whose flowers open {{one at a time}} and usually only remain open for a short period. Flowers open in response to light intensity (often opening only <b>in</b> <b>direct</b> <b>sunlight),</b> and the entire inflorescence is also helitropic, moving in response to the sun's position in the sky.|$|E
25|$|Nepenthes viridis is {{endemic to}} the Philippines. It has been {{recorded}} from coastal areas of Dinagat and Samar, and {{from a number of}} surrounding micro-islands. Plants generally grow terrestrially on humic and rocky soils, often <b>in</b> <b>direct</b> <b>sunlight.</b>|$|E

50|$|Cardisoma guanhumi is omnivorous, {{collecting}} and eating leaves and fruits {{close to its}} burrow whilst also eating insects and carrion. Like many crabs, this species is cannibalistic. They move in the shade {{during the day and}} will eschew moving <b>in</b> prolonged <b>direct</b> <b>sunlight</b> to feed at night instead.|$|R
25|$|Like many {{carnivorous}} plants, Byblis species usually grow in bogs and marshes. They generally prefer seasonally wet {{sandy soil}} <b>in</b> partial or <b>direct</b> <b>sunlight</b> with temperatures between ~ 5-40°C (40-105°F).|$|R
25|$|Most {{carnivorous}} plants require bright light, {{and most}} will look better under such conditions, as this {{encourages them to}} synthesise red and purple anthocyanin pigments. Nepenthes and Pinguicula will do better out of full sun, but most other species are happy <b>in</b> <b>direct</b> <b>sunlight.</b>|$|E
25|$|Electronic {{paper and}} e-paper are display devices that mimic the {{appearance}} of ordinary ink on paper. Unlike conventional backlit flat panel displays that emit light, electronic paper displays reflect light like paper. This may make them more comfortable to read, and provide a wider viewing angle than most light-emitting displays. The contrast ratio in electronic displays available as of 2008 approaches newspaper, and newly (2008) developed displays are slightly better. An ideal e-paper display can be read <b>in</b> <b>direct</b> <b>sunlight</b> without the image appearing to fade.|$|E
25|$|Firm kiwifruit ripen after a {{few days}} to a week when stored at room temperature, but should not be kept <b>in</b> <b>direct</b> <b>sunlight.</b> Faster {{ripening}} occurs when placed in a paper bag with an apple, pear, or banana. Once a kiwifruit is ripe, however, it is preserved optimally when stored far from other fruits, as it is very sensitive to the ethylene gas they may emit, thereby tending to over-ripen even in the refrigerator. If stored appropriately, ripe kiwifruit normally keep for about one to two weeks.|$|E
50|$|This {{species is}} known to {{withstand}} temperatures down to at least -2 or -5 degrees Celsius if kept completely dry. It is not known to do well <b>in</b> <b>direct,</b> intense <b>sunlight,</b> mainly <b>in</b> summer months. It is also sensitive to red spider mite.|$|R

25|$|The {{container}} of food is placed inside the solar cooker, {{which may be}} elevated on a brick, rock, metal trivet, or other heat sink, and the solar cooker is placed <b>in</b> <b>direct</b> <b>sunlight.</b> Foods that cook quickly may {{be added to the}} solar cooker later. Rice for a mid-day meal might be started early in the morning, with vegetables, cheese, or soup added to the solar cooker {{in the middle of the}} morning. Depending on the size of the solar cooker and the number and quantity of cooked foods, a family may use one or more solar cookers.|$|E
25|$|Monochrome {{and later}} color passive-matrix LCDs were {{standard}} in most early laptops (although a few used plasma displays) {{and the original}} Nintendo Game Boy until the mid-1990s, when color active-matrix became standard on all laptops. The commercially unsuccessful Macintosh Portable (released in 1989) {{was one of the}} first to use an active-matrix display (though still monochrome). Passive-matrix LCDs are still used in the 2010s for applications less demanding than laptop computers and TVs, such as inexpensive calculators. In particular, these are used on portable devices where less information content needs to be displayed, lowest power consumption (no backlight) and low cost are desired or readability <b>in</b> <b>direct</b> <b>sunlight</b> is needed.|$|E
25|$|A {{solar cell}} is any device that {{directly}} converts the energy in light into electrical energy {{through the process}} of photovoltaics. Although French physicist Antoine-César Becquerel discovered the photovoltaic effect much earlier in 1839, the first solar cell, according to Encyclopædia Britannica, was invented by Charles Fritts in 1883, who used junctions formed by coating selenium with an extremely thin layer of gold. In 1941, the silicon solar cell was invented by another American named Russell Ohl. Drawing upon Ohl's work, three American researchers named Gerald Pearson, Calvin Fuller, and Daryl Chapin essentially introduced the first practical use of solar panels through their improvement of the silicone solar cell in 1954, which by placing them <b>in</b> <b>direct</b> <b>sunlight,</b> free electrons are turned into electric current enabling a six percent energy conversion efficiency.|$|E
50|$|Because rhubarb is a {{seasonal}} plant, obtaining fresh rhubarb {{out of season}} is difficult in colder climates, {{such as in the}} UK, Ireland, and Russia. Rhubarb thrives <b>in</b> areas of <b>direct</b> <b>sunlight</b> and can successfully be planted in containers if they are large enough to accommodate a season's growth.|$|R

25|$|Like {{many other}} NFL teams located in {{subtropical}} climates, the Buccaneers traditionally wear their white road jerseys at {{home during the}} first half of the season – forcing opponents to wear their darker colors during the hot summers and autumns in Tampa. Additionally, the visitors' bench of Raymond James Stadium is located on the east side of the stadium, which is <b>in</b> <b>direct</b> <b>sunlight</b> for games that kick off at 1:00p.m. Eastern games. The west sideline is in the shade. In , the Buccaneers started to wear white at home to accommodate Vinny Testaverde's color blindness. Vinny Testaverde had bad performances in the darker (orange) uniforms and persuaded head coach Ray Perkins to change the team's home uniform to white. In certain years such as 1989–1991, and in 1996 — the last year of the original uniforms, the Bucs generally wore white at home for the entire season including preseason. Since the new uniforms were adopted, the Bucs wear the red jerseys for the last few home games, and for nearly all night home games. In the preseason, the Bucs may or may not wear white for their home games. The Bucs have worn their red jerseys for all home postseason games except for a January 6, 2008 playoff match against the New York Giants, where the Bucs wore white instead, as the temperature that day was unseasonably high.|$|E
25|$|The third-generation RX comes {{standard}} with a twin-chamber {{front passenger}} airbags, side torso airbags {{for the front}} row, side curtain airbags for front and rear rows, and knee airbags for the front row. Active headrests become standard to help reduce whiplash injuries. Vehicle Stability Control (VSC) and Hill Assist Control (HAC) which helps prevent the vehicle from rolling backwards on inclines are standard while a more advanced Vehicle Dynamics Integrated Management (VDIM) system is optional. VDIM {{is designed to be}} more subtle and less intrusive in performance than VSC alone, VDIM can also engage prior to an actual skid taking place acting as a preventative measure. The Adaptive Front-lighting System (AFS) remains optional, while a new bi-xenon optional Intelligent Highbeam feature is added, this system can dim the high-beams automatically whenever traffic is detected. Other optional safety features include a Pre-Collision System (PCS) and a Head-up Display (HUD) which helps the driver keep attention on the road ahead by displaying navigation, speed, and audio information on the windshield; the HUD uses high-intensity LEDs displaying high contrast white figures on the windshield allowing it to be read <b>in</b> <b>direct</b> <b>sunlight.</b> The optional navigation system offers a backup camera and a Wide-View Side Monitor utilizes a camera on the passenger side view mirror to help eliminate blind spots on the passenger side at low speeds, this system does not include the 180° wide-angle front camera found in the LX 570. To further help improve visibility, water-repellent glass is used on the front doors.|$|E

40|$|Traditional shading design {{principles}} {{guide the}} {{vertical and horizontal}} orientation of fins, louvres and awnings being applied to orthogonal planar façades. Due to doubly curved envelopes characterising many contemporary designs, these rules of thumb are now not always applicable. Operable blinds attempt to regulate the fluctuating luminance of daylight and aid <b>in</b> shading <b>direct</b> <b>sunlight.</b> Mostly they remain closed, as workers are commonly too preoccupied to continually adjust them so a reliance on electrically powered lights remains a preference. To remedy these problems, the {{idea of what it}} is to sustainable enclose space is reconsidered through the geometric and kinetic optimisation of a parametric skin, with sunlight responsive modules that regulate interior light levels. This research concludes with an optimised design and also defines some unique metrics to gauge the design’s performance in terms of, the amount of exterior unobstructed view, its ability to shade <b>direct</b> <b>sunlight</b> and, its daylight glare probability...|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} {{identify}} the species of Pycnoporus a few characteristics must be carefully observed.

P. cinnabarinus has a fruiting body ranging from 5 to 15 mm in thickness while P. sanguineus ranges from 1-5 mm thick. Additionally P. sanguineus typically contains darker red pigments that do not easily fade. Several collected specimens of P. cinnabarinus show pale orange pigmentation <b>in</b> areas with <b>direct</b> <b>sunlight.</b> Lastly, P. cinnabarinus contains larger pores per mm (2-4) than P. sanguineus with 4-6 pores per mm.|$|R
30|$|The {{experiment}} {{was carried out}} at room temperature of about 30  °C. All the pots were kept <b>in</b> the <b>direct</b> <b>sunlight</b> (D/N 12 / 12  h). Twenty milliliters of distilled water was added to each pot every alternate day. The germination rate was determined on day three. The length of the leaves was determined periodically in each pot. At the end of day 30, survival percentage, leaf area and total chlorophyll were determined. All the plantlets from each pot were carefully removed from the soil and washed several times with distilled water to remove all the soil particles. These were then studied for length, wet and dry weight. The dried shoots and the roots were made into powder using mortar and pestle and {{were used to determine}} total phosphorus and total nitrogen for the shoots {{as well as for the}} roots.|$|R
500|$|The HTC First was {{released}} to mixed reviews. Dieter Bohn of The Verge gave the HTC First a 7.9 out of 10, receiving high marks in most categories except for its camera.

500|$|The Verge {{gave the}} HTC One an 8.3 out of 10; {{aside from the}} {{positioning}} of its power button and navigation keys, which {{were considered to be}} hard to reach, its hardware design was praised for having a [...] "totally unique and somehow still understated" [...] look, while its 1080p display was considered {{to be one of the}} sharpest displays on a smartphone—although not bright enough to be seen properly <b>in</b> <b>direct</b> <b>sunlight.</b> In combination with its stereo speakers, the One was considered a good phone for viewing videos and playing games, while its call quality was judged as being sufficient. In regards to performance, the HTC One was considered to be [...] "an impressively powerful phone across the board" [...] due to its high scores on various benchmark tests. Its camera received mixed reviews; while it had better low-light performance than its competitors as advertised, the One’s photos were criticized for looking [...] "soft and mushy" [...] due to extensive post-processing and only looked relatively good at the smaller sizes applied by services such as Facebook and Instagram. The Zoe features were considered unique and useful, but the HTC Share service was panned for being [...] "kind of like Vine, except [...] your clips only last a few months and no one’s ever going to use it."

Its flowers are 1 in long with 4 yellow-green, long narrow bracts. What makes the piratebush unique is in how it survives. The plant does not survive on photosynthesis only as its pale green leaves indicate less chlorophyll than other plants. In addition to photosynthesis, piratebush receives nutrients through parasitizing other species. The plant is hemiparasitic, attaching itself to the root systems of other plants with structures called haustoria and draw nutrients through them. Although originally thought to attach itself only to hemlock trees, it has since been determined that piratebush can attach to many different species.|$|R
