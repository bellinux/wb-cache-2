40|$|Purpose : The {{focus of}} the paper is to explore the best {{practices}} for the delivery of <b>final</b> <b>year</b> engineering project. Students use their own initiatives to accomplish practical design projects in their <b>final</b> <b>year</b> of engineering. Each academia proposes different ways of project approaches that should satisfy engineering accreditation requirements for capstone projects. This paper analyses and compares various undergraduate <b>final</b> <b>year</b> engineering project approaches of different universities in Australia. From this case study analysis, this research will explore the best assessment practice for the delivery of <b>final</b> <b>year</b> project. Design/Methodology : Through desktop analysis methodology, this paper will analyse six universities in Australia who are practicing different approaches in their undergraduate <b>final</b> <b>year</b> engineering project. This analysis will look in to {{the various types of}} <b>final</b> <b>year</b> projects undertaken, their learning outcomes, teaching methods and assessment measures. Findings : From these 6 case studies, this paper will provide a report on its implementation and assessment impact on <b>final</b> <b>year</b> projects based on the analysed results of qualitative review of course units in undergraduate programs. Conclusions : This paper shows the desktop analysis data and compared the six case studies of Australian universities. The above-summarized different <b>final</b> <b>year</b> engineering project approaches were extremely successful in identifying and promoting creativity and innovation through <b>final</b> <b>year</b> projects. From the comparison, it is clearly shown that Deakin University practices one of best assessment methods for the delivery of <b>final</b> <b>year</b> engineering project...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigated}} university student perceptions regarding their employment prospects {{and the extent}} to which differences exist regarding perceptions of employment prospects among beneficiaries and non-beneficiaries of the South African government’s affirmative action policies. A quantitative research design was used in which self administered questionnaires were distributed to respondents. A purposive sampling procedure was utilised. The data was subjected to a number of statistical analyses including one way ANOVA and T-test of independent samples. Results indicated that final Accounting and Pharmacy students reported positive perceptions about their employment prospects than <b>final</b> <b>year</b> sociology students. As hypothesised, female <b>final</b> <b>year</b> students were significantly more confident than male <b>final</b> <b>year</b> students about employment prospects. Also, black <b>final</b> <b>year</b> students were found to be significantly more confident than their white <b>final</b> <b>year</b> counterparts (non-beneficiaries of employment policies) about their employment prospects. It is concluded that differences regarding employment prospects among <b>final</b> <b>year</b> students can be accounted for by factors such as gender, field of study, race and whether or not one is a beneficiary of the SA government’s affirmative employment policies...|$|R
40|$|Background: Most {{medical schools}} require formal {{competence}} assessment of students {{immediately prior to}} graduation, but variation exists in the approach to endpoint assessments. This article reports perceptions of senior students and graduates from a school with a six-year program which has introduced <b>final</b> <b>year</b> workplace immersion placements following a barrier examination {{at the end of}} the penultimate <b>Year</b> 5. Methods: <b>Final</b> <b>year</b> students (22) and recent graduates (4) attended focus groups and in-depth interviews exploring their perceptions of the value of the curriculum experience during the <b>final</b> two <b>years,</b> the structure and timing of assessment, and their preparation for internship. Findings: Participants felt that the penultimate year was more pressured, and focused on passing "artificial" examinations. In contrast, the <b>final</b> <b>year</b> was more relaxed, building skills for postgraduate work and later career development. As a result, students felt well prepared for internship with some indication that the self-directed nature of the <b>final</b> <b>year</b> promoted a lifelong learning approach. Conclusion: The <b>final</b> <b>year</b> workplace immersion model was regarded positively by senior students of this medical school. This model may be a better way of preparing students to be junior doctors than a traditional <b>final</b> <b>year</b> heavy on theoretical learning and assessment...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{highlights}} the importance in Australia of providing an effective <b>final</b> <b>year</b> experience in higher education to bookend the progress {{that has been made}} to develop coherent first year experience programs. Though the observations made are of general application, the paper focuses on legal education and argues that the special circumstances of <b>final</b> <b>year</b> students create an imperative to ensure that we “close the loop” on their university studies. The paper considers the synergies in issues of curriculum renewal for first and <b>final</b> <b>year</b> students of tertiary education, and argues that the development of a coherent <b>final</b> <b>year</b> experience/capstone program in Australian universities, and particularly in legal education, is long overdue...|$|R

40|$|An attempt {{had been}} made to {{investigate}} the seroepidemiology of Helicobacter pylori infection with influencing factors affecting the new entrants and <b>final</b> <b>year</b> medical students. The study was based on the analysis of primary data taken from new entrants and <b>final</b> <b>year</b> MBBS students of Sylhet MAG Osmani Medical College, Bangladesh. To detect H. pylori IgG among first <b>year</b> and <b>final</b> <b>year</b> medical students, we compared the seroprevalence of H. pylori lgG between two groups and found influencing factors affecting the seroprevalence and any association between them. In this study, 80 students from each group were studied. Relevant variables were taken in a pre-designed questionnaire. H. pylori lgG was detected by using ELISA method. The study showed that in first year 41 (50 %) and in <b>final</b> <b>year</b> 47 (about 59 %) students were H. pylori lgG positive respectively. Numerically <b>final</b> <b>year</b> students were more affected by H. pylori than new entrants. The study revealed that in first year, positive seroprevalence of H. pylori significantly differed with only travel history of students. On the other hand, in <b>final</b> <b>year,</b> positive seroprevalence of H. pylori significantly differ with gender of students. Further study needed to be carried out for large scale population to make general inference about seroepidemiology of H. pylori...|$|R
