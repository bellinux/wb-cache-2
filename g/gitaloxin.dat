40|$|<b>Gitaloxin</b> is a {{digitalis}} glycoside {{used for}} the same indications as digoxin and digitoxin. The successful outcome for a 2 1 / 4 -year-old boy who accidentally ingested 3 mg of <b>gitaloxin</b> (100 times the normal therapeutic dose) is reported. At admission the child presented with irregular heart rhythm. He subsequently started vomiting, even after continuous gastric feeding. Only 48 h after ingestion of <b>gitaloxin</b> he became somnolent and developed bradyarrhythmia. The symptoms disappeared 96 h later; the bradyarrhythmia, however, (second-degree atrioventricular block) decreased progressively only after 120 h. The initial clinical presentation of <b>gitaloxin</b> poisoning may be misleading and careful observation in a pediatric intensive care unit is mandatory. A cross-reaction between the fluorescence polarization immunoassay for digitoxin and the radioimmunoassay for <b>gitaloxin</b> was found and {{was used as a}} helpful, but rough, estimate of the severity of <b>gitaloxin</b> poisoning, {{in the absence of a}} specific measurement of <b>gitaloxin.</b> SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
