5000|$|When a European patent {{application}} claims a <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>inventions,</b> [...] "unity of invention" [...] is considered present if [...] "...there is a technical relationship among those inventions involving {{one or more}} of the same or corresponding special technical features." ...|$|E
5000|$|Under , a European patent {{application}} must [...] "...relate to one invention only or to a <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>inventions</b> so linked as {{to form a}} single general inventive concept." [...] This legal provision is the application, within the European Patent Convention, of the requirement of unity of invention, which applies also in many other jurisdictions.|$|E
5000|$|Under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT), an {{international}} application, {{which is also}} called PCT application, [...] "shall relate to one invention only or to a <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>inventions</b> so linked as to form a single general inventive concept". If the requirement of unity of invention is not met, the International Searching Authority (i.e., the patent office in charge of carrying out the international search) [...] "is entitled to request the applicant to pay an additional search fee for each invention beyond the first {{which is to be}} searched".|$|E
5000|$|In {{reaction}} {{to such a}} request from the International Searching Authority (ISA), the applicant may pay all {{or some of the}} requested additional search fees, and the International Searching Authority (ISA) then establishes the international search for all or some <b>of</b> the <b>inventions</b> or <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>inventions,</b> respectively. The applicant may also decide not to pay any of the additional search fees, and, in such case, the ISA does not carry out a search for the <b>inventions</b> or <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>inventions</b> for which no search fees have been paid. The international search report (ISR) is then established only for the first claimed invention.|$|R
5000|$|If, when {{carrying}} out a search, the search division considers that the application lacks unity (i.e., it doesn't meet the provisions of Article 82), a partial search report is established. The EPO then requires one or more further search fees for the other identified <b>inventions,</b> or <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>inventions,</b> that the search may cover.|$|R
25|$|Lumpy Gravy is {{the debut}} solo album by Frank Zappa, {{an album of}} orchestral, {{electric}} and concrete sound written by Zappa and performed by a <b>group</b> <b>of</b> session players he dubbed the Abnuceals Emuukha Electric Symphony Orchestra. Zappa conducted the orchestra but did not perform on the album. It is his third album overall: his previous releases had been under the name <b>of</b> his <b>group,</b> the Mothers <b>of</b> <b>Invention.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{application}} should {{relate to}} one invention only {{or where they}} are a <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>inventions,</b> they must be linked so as to form a single inventive concept. [...] The applicant may opt to amend the application prior to the grant of the right, however, such amendment must not affect {{the core of the}} initial disclosure made. [...] The applicant may,divide the application into divisional applications but each divisional application is only limited to that before the initial disclosure. [...] Each divisional application shall have a filing date and, where applicable, a priority date. It is noteworthy however, that a patent would not be invalidated because it does not comply with the requirement of unity as in subsection (1) of section 6.|$|E
40|$|A {{photograph}} {{from the}} estate of Sasha Morgenthaler has recently come to light in which a previously unknown early work by Paul Klee can be seen. Subsequently the early work is here tentatively assigned to the composition called Father and Son that Klee mentions several times in his correspondence with Lily. For Klee this study, which can be dated to the autumn of 1902, anticipates the <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>inventions.</b> The composition was evidently influenced by Klee’s profound knowledge of human anatomy and studies of form {{in the manner of}} Hodler. Klee reworked the version of Father and Son in different ways but none of them satisfied Klee’s desire for successful visual representation of the ideal fantasy state. He therefore destroyed the different variants of the subject Father and Son, so that the photographic reproduction is all that has survived. In the photograph taken in the artist’s studio and his letters to Lily, Klee for the first time represents the artist’s studio as an interpretation of the artistic myth of creation...|$|E
40|$|FIELD: {{measurement}} equipment. SUBSTANCE: {{method to}} determine properties of a multi-phase process fluid medium includes stages, when: the multi-phase fluid medium is sent along an oscillating movable flow metering tube and a flow metre of alternating pressure difference; {{motion of the}} flow metering tube is caused, and the first apparent property of the fluid medium is determined; at least one apparent intermediate value is determined, {{which is the first}} Froude number for the non-gaseous phase of the fluid medium and the second Froude number for the gaseous phase of the fluid medium; the extent of humidity of the fluid medium is determined on the basis of conversion {{between the first and second}} Froude numbers and the extent of humidity; the second apparent property of the fluid medium is determined using the flow metre of alternating pressure difference; the phase-dependent property of the fluid medium is determined on the basis of extent of humidity and the second apparent property. At the same time the first apparent property is selected from the apparent mass flow or density. The <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>inventions</b> also relates to a flow metre comprising an oscillating movable flow metering tube, connected oscillation exciter and sensor for reading of tube motion, and a controller, and also to a metering converter of the flow metre and the system for determination of properties of the multi-phase fluid medium. EFFECT: higher accuracy for determination of properties of a multi-phase fluid medium and makes it possible to assess accuracy of operation of flow metres...|$|E
50|$|In most patent laws, unity <b>of</b> <b>invention</b> is {{a formal}} {{administrative}} requirement {{that must be}} met by a patent application to become a granted patent. Basically, a patent application can relate only to one <b>invention</b> or a <b>group</b> <b>of</b> closely related <b>inventions.</b> The purpose <b>of</b> this requirement is administrative, as well as financial. That is, the requirement serves to preclude the option of filing one patent application for several inventions, while paying only one set of fees (filing fee, search fee, examination fee, renewal fees, and so on). Unity <b>of</b> <b>invention</b> also makes the classification of patent documents easier.|$|R
2500|$|Frank Zappa {{performed}} in Upland on Foothill Boulevard {{during the early}} 1960s where he played shows on a makeshift stage for college crowds. Zappa also purchased Pal Recording Studio on Archibald Avenue in Rancho Cucamonga where the Surfaris had recorded the surf music classic [...] "Wipe Out." [...] He dubbed it Studio Z and began making recordings which {{eventually led to the}} founding <b>of</b> Zappa's <b>group,</b> The Mothers <b>of</b> <b>Invention.</b> Up until his death in December 2012, singer Ray Collins of the Mothers <b>of</b> <b>Invention</b> lived in the area. Zappa mentions the Inland Empire in the song [...] "Billy the Mountain." ...|$|R
50|$|Smalley's latest {{research}} {{was focused on}} carbon nanotubes, specifically focusing on the chemical synthesis side of nanotube research. He {{is well known for}} his <b>group's</b> <b>invention</b> <b>of</b> the high-pressure carbon monoxide (HiPco) method of producing large batches of high-quality nanotubes. Smalley spun off his work into a company, Carbon Nanotechnologies Inc. and associated nanotechnologies.|$|R
5000|$|Bizarre was {{originally}} {{formed as a}} production company. In 1967 Zappa's label, Verve Records, missed the deadline to renew their option on Zappa's recording contract after his second album, Absolutely Free, recorded with his <b>group</b> the Mothers <b>of</b> <b>Invention.</b> This gave Zappa and Cohen {{the upper hand in}} negotiating their own production deal with Verve. The purpose of forming his own production company was to give Zappa complete creative control over his work and the works he planned to produce for others.|$|R
50|$|The MGM soundtracks {{catalogue}} however {{is managed}} by Warner Bros. Entertainment through its WaterTower Music unit and the catalogs {{of a few}} other artists also have new owners. Frank Zappa for example regained control of his MGM/Verve recordings (including those with his <b>group</b> the Mothers <b>of</b> <b>Invention)</b> in the early 1980s. These recordings were licensed by Zappa to Rykodisc, starting in 1987. Ironically, Zappa's widow, Gail Zappa, negotiated a licensing deal with UME to redistribute all of Zappa's non-mailorder titles (including the six LPs originally released on Verve) in 2012.|$|R
5000|$|In 1970, Billboard {{reported}} that [...] "MGM Records president Mike Curb has dropped 18 acts who, in his opinion, promote and exploit hard drugs through music." [...] Billboard {{reported that}} Curb was {{alarmed by the}} drug-related deaths of Janis Joplin, Jimi Hendrix, and Alan Wilson of Canned Heat. Among the musicians thought {{to be included in}} the purge were The Velvet Underground and Frank Zappa's <b>group</b> The Mothers <b>of</b> <b>Invention.</b> However Zappa spoke out against drug use throughout his career and by early 1969 had fulfilled his MGM/Verve contract and moved to his own Bizarre Records label, distributed by Warner Bros. Also, when Eric Burdon, who was an advocate of psychedelics, dared Curb to release him from his contract although he was his biggest selling artist, Curb acquiesced.|$|R
2500|$|Erotic {{literature}} comprises fictional and/or factual {{stories and}} accounts of human sexual relationships {{which have the}} power to or are intended to arouse the reader sexually. Such erotica takes the form of novels, short stories, poetry, true-life memoirs, and sex manuals. [...] A common feature of the genre is sexual fantasies on such themes as prostitution, orgies, homosexuality, sadomasochism, and many other taboo subjects and fetishes, {{which may or may not}} be expressed in explicit language. Other common elements are satire and social criticism. Despite cultural taboos on such material, circulation of erotic literature was not seen as a major problem before the <b>invention</b> <b>of</b> printing, as the costs of producing individual manuscripts limited distribution to a very small <b>group</b> <b>of</b> readers. The <b>invention</b> <b>of</b> printing, in the 15th century, brought with it both a greater market and increasing restrictions, like censorship and legal restraints on publication on the grounds of obscenity. Because of this, much of the production of this type of material became [...]|$|R

500|$|Science Wonders {{first issue}} {{included}} {{the first part}} of a serial, The Reign of the Ray, by Fletcher Pratt and Irwin Lester, and short stories by Stanton Coblentz and David H. Keller. Air Wonder began with a reprinted serial, Victor MacClure's Ark of the Covenant. Writers who first appeared in the pages of these magazines include Neil R. Jones, Ed Earl Repp, Raymond Z. Gallun and Lloyd Eshbach. The quality of published science fiction at the time was generally low, and Lasser was keen to improve it. On 11 May 1931 he wrote to his regular contributors to tell them that their science fiction stories [...] "should deal realistically with the effect upon people, individually and in <b>groups,</b> <b>of</b> a scientific <b>invention</b> or discovery.... In other words, allow yourself one fundamental assumption—that a certain machine or discovery is possible—and then show what would be its logical and dramatic consequences upon the world; also what would be the effect upon the <b>group</b> <b>of</b> characters that you pick to carry your theme." ...|$|R
