40|$|Distractions can {{interfere}} with driving by causing central processing bottlenecks. In addition to performance <b>decrements,</b> central processing <b>delays</b> may also impair decision-making during critical driving maneuvers such as stop or go decisions at intersections. It was hypothesized that distractions would delay the stop or go decision leading to more go responses. Participants drove 4 simulated drives and made stop or go decisions at intersections with and without a distracting task. Distractions {{did not result in}} more go responses at intersections. Additionally, dual-task interference in braking responses was found to be dependent upon participants’ response strategies. Theoretical implications of response strategy on processing bottlenecks were discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose was}} to {{determine}} the effect of Naproxen in attenuating the symptoms (muscle soreness level) and signs (plasma CK activity and muscular strength <b>decrement)</b> of <b>delayed</b> onset muscle soreness (DOMS). Twenty subjects were randomly assigned Naproxen (500 mg BID) or placebo in a double-blind, crossover design. Two testing phases, each 8 days in duration, were separated by a washout period of 7 days. Eccentric single-leg exercises were performed on Days 1, 3 and 4 to induce DOMS in the quadriceps muscles. Perception of muscle soreness, plasma CK, and knee extensor torque were evaluated throughout each phase. Following the eccentric exercise, plasma CK levels were similarly elevated in both Naproxen and placebo conditions. After DOMS had developed, Naproxen reduced the perception of soreness on Day 3 when muscle soreness was highest. Following treatments with Naproxen, peak quadriceps torque during leg extension at 60 $ sp circ$/s was higher compared to placebo, however at higher velocity (180 and 300 $ sp circ$/s) peak muscle torques were similar. The data indicate that therapeutic doses of Naproxen do not prevent CK release into the plasma but decreases the perception of muscle soreness and positively influences quadriceps peak torque...|$|R
40|$|Insomniacs often {{complain}} of memory deficits, yet objective measures have not consistently corroborated their subjective impressions. A {{possible explanation for}} the partial gap between self-report and behavioral measures of memory impairment is that insomniacs recruit extra effort to compensate for the consequences of poor sleep. The present study investigated whether subjective insomnia severity would predict objective effort mobilization, as indexed by cardiovascular measures, in an easy memory task. Seventy-seven university students, mostly women, {{with a mean age of}} 22 years were asked to memorize four strings of four random letters in 5 min while cardiovascular measures were obtained. After taking an immediate recall test, participants completed the Insomnia Severity Index, the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory, and a questionnaire on last night's sleep and today's fatigue. Finally, they were given a surprise delayed recall test. Analyses indicated that self-reported insomnia severity was associated with an increase in systolic blood pressure during the learning phase. Regarding memory performance, insomnia severity was unrelated to immediate recall but related to a <b>decrement</b> in <b>delayed</b> recall. These findings reveal for the first time that subjective insomnia severity predicts objective effort mobilization in an easy memory task, suggesting that young poor sleepers recruit extra resources to cope with everyday cognitive challenges...|$|R
40|$|Five pigeons were {{successfully}} taught {{a variation of}} the Konorski delayed pair comparison task, using a red and a green stimulus. The bird was required to respond to the left or right hand key, depending on whether the 2 successively presented centre key stimuli were the same (left) or different (right). The delay intervals ranged from zero to 9 s, and stable performance <b>decrements</b> (with increasing <b>delay)</b> were obtained. Chlordiazepoxide which, it has been argued, produces behavioural changes similar to those observed after hippocampal lesions was found to disrupt performance at doses greater than 4 mg/kg (i. m.). All delays (including zero) were affected. Some interpretations of this result in terms of encoding and attention are discussed, and some reference made to the possible neuropharmacological basis of this drug action...|$|R
40|$|Reinforcers {{are known}} to lose their {{effectiveness}} over time. One strategy to prevent or delay a decrease in reinforcer effectiveness is reinforcer variation. That is, a reinforcer is selected by someone other than the respondent from an array of different reinforcers at each scheduled delivery. This {{is in contrast to}} delivering a single constant reinforcer for each reinforced response. Reinforcer variation has been examined in the applied literature and, overall, has had positive effects on preventing or <b>delaying</b> <b>decrements</b> in responding. However, inconsistent results of research investigations exist, and procedures for varying reinforcers differ between studies. Based on a narrative review of the existing literature, the exact mechanisms behind the effectiveness of reinforcer variation are still not known. In this narrative review we examine the applied literature on reinforcer variation, identify potential variables that may affect responding under conditions of varied reinforcers, and provide suggestions for future research...|$|R
40|$|High-intensity {{eccentric}} contractions induce performance <b>decrements</b> and <b>delayed</b> onset muscle soreness. The {{purpose of}} this investigation was to study the magnitude and time course of such decrements and their interrelationships in 26 young women of mean(s. d.) age 21. 4 (3. 3) years. Subjects performed 70 maximal eccentric contractions of the elbow flexors on a pulley system, specially designed for the study. The non-exercised arm acted as the control. Measures of soreness, tenderness, swelling (SW), relaxed elbow joint angle (RANG) and isometric strength (STR) were taken before exercise, immediately after exercise (AE), analysis of variance and at 24 -h intervals for 11 days. There were significant (P < 0. 01, analysis of variance) changes in all factors. Peak effects were observed between 24 and 96 h AE. With the exception of STR, which remained lower (P < 0. 01), all variables returned to baseline levels by day 11. A non-significant correlation between pain and STR indicated that pain was not a major factor in strength loss. Also, although no pain was evident, RANG was decreased immediately AE. There was no relationship between SW, RANG and pain. The prolonged nature of these symptoms indicates that repair to damaged soft tissue is a slow process. Strength loss is considered particularly important as it continues when protective pain and tenderness have disappeared. This has implications for the therapeutic management of patients with myopathologies and those receiving eccentric exercise for rehabilitation...|$|R
40|$|We use {{published}} ROSAT {{observations of}} the X-ray Nova V 1974 Cygni 1992 to test a model for interstellar dust grains consisting of a mixture of carbonaceous grains and silicate grains. The time-dependent X-ray emission from the nova is modelled as the sum of emission from a O-Ne white dwarf plus a thermal plasma, and X-ray scattering is calculated for a dust mixture with a realistic size distribution, and with various spatial distributions. Model results are compared with the scattering halos measured by ROSAT at 9 different epochs, including the early period of rising X-ray emission, the “plateau ” phase of steady emission, and the X-ray decline at late times. We find that the observed X-ray halos appear {{to be consistent with}} the halos calculated for the size distribution of Weingartner & Draine which reproduces the Milky Way extinction with RV = 3. 1, provided that the reddening to the nova is E(B − V) ≈ 0. 19, consistent with E(B − V) = 0. 19 inferred from the late-time Balmer <b>decrement.</b> The time <b>delay</b> of the scattered halo relative to the direct flux from the nova is clearly detected. Models with smoothly-distributed dust give good overall agreement with the observe...|$|R
40|$|In {{a series}} of conditions, pigeons chose between 1. 5 s and 3 s of access to grain, each preceded by some delay. The delay that preceded the small {{reinforcer}} was constant throughout a condition. The delay that preceded the large reinforcer was increased or decreased {{a number of times}} each session in order to estimate an "indifference point," a delay at which the subject chose each alternative about equally often. The experiment was designed to determine whether variations in any of four features of this adjusting-delay procedure would systematically alter the estimated indifference points. The four features were the total trial duration, the number of center-key responses necessary to begin a trial, the number of choice trials that preceded each change in the adjusting delay, and step size [...] the size of each increment and <b>decrement</b> in the <b>delay.</b> Manipulation of the first three features had no systematic effects on the indifference points. As step size was increased from 0. 5 s to 6 s, within-session variability of the adjusting delay steadily increased, and the 6 -s step size produced larger indifference-point estimates for some subjects. The results suggest that, within certain limits, these procedural features can be altered without affecting the indifference-point estimates, but that the use of a large step size can distort the estimates. Some theoretical implications of the relative constancy of indifference points across these procedural variations are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Whereas adults often rely on {{explicit}} memory, children {{appear to}} excel in implicit memory, which {{plays an important role}} in the acquisition of various cognitive skills, such as those involved in language. The current study aimed to test the assertion of an age-dependent shift in implicit versus explicit learning within a theoretical framework that explains the link between implicit sequence memory and word-form acquisition, using the Hebb repetition paradigm. We conducted a one-year, multiple-session longitudinal study in which we presented auditory sequences of syllables, co-presented with pictures of aliens, for immediate serial recall by a group of children (8 - 9 years) and by an adult group. The repetition of one Hebb sequence was explicitly announced, while the repetition of another Hebb sequence was unannounced and, therefore, implicit. Despite their overall inferior recall performance, the children showed better offline retention of the implicit Hebb sequence, compared with adults who showed a significant <b>decrement</b> across the <b>delays.</b> Adults had gained more explicit knowledge of the implicit sequence than children, but this could not explain the age-dependent decline in the delayed memory for it. There was no significant age-effect for delayed memory of the explicit Hebb sequence, with both age groups showing retention. Overall performance by adults was positively correlated with measures of post-learning awareness. Performance by children was positively correlated with vocabulary knowledge. We conclude that children outperform adults in the retention over time of implicitly learned phonological sequences that will gradually consolidate into novel word-forms. The findings are discussed in the light of maturational differences for implicit versus explicit memory systems that also play a role in language acquisition...|$|R

Models with smoothly-distributed dust give good overall agreement with the observed scattering halo, but tend to produce somewhat more scattering than observed at 200 - 300 ", and insufficient scattering at 50 - 100 ". While an additional population of large grains can increase the scattered intensity at 50 - 100 ", this could also be achieved by having ~ 30 % of the dust in a cloud at a distance from us equal to ~ 95 % of the distance to the nova. Such a model also improves agreement with the data at larger angles, and illustrates the sensitivity of X-ray scattering halos to the location of the dust. The observations therefore do not require a population of micron-sized dust grains.
