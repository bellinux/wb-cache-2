5|$|Although {{regulation}} reducing lead {{in products}} has greatly reduced exposure {{in the developed}} world since the 1970s, lead is still allowed in products in many <b>developing</b> <b>countries.</b> In all countries that have banned leaded gasoline, average blood lead levels have fallen sharply. However, some <b>developing</b> <b>countries</b> still allow leaded gasoline, which is the primary source of lead exposure in most <b>developing</b> <b>countries.</b> Beyond exposure from gasoline, the frequent use of pesticides in <b>developing</b> <b>countries</b> adds a risk of lead exposure and subsequent poisoning. Poor children in <b>developing</b> <b>countries</b> are at especially high risk for lead poisoning. Of North American children, 7% have blood lead levels above 10 μg/dL, whereas among Central and South American children, the percentage is 33 to 34%. About one fifth of the world's disease burden from lead poisoning occurs in the Western Pacific, and another fifth is in Southeast Asia.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{develop a}} model of trade with {{imperfect}} competition to study the welfare implications in <b>developing</b> and <b>developed</b> <b>countries</b> of the asymmetry in attitudes towards foreign products. In the <b>developed</b> <b>country,</b> consumers benefit from a better perception of foreign products while the rental rate of capital declines {{as long as the}} location of capital remains unchanged. However, when capital is mobile, the <b>developing</b> <b>country</b> hosts more and more capital {{at the expense of the}} <b>developed</b> <b>country</b> as the perception of varieties produced in the <b>developed</b> <b>country</b> improves and the surplus of consumers in the <b>developed</b> <b>country</b> can decrease...|$|R
5|$|If these {{conditions}} are in place, multinational corporations will transfer via their offshore subsidiaries or to their offshore suppliers, the specific production technologies and market linkages necessary {{to participate in}} the global economy. By themselves, <b>developing</b> <b>countries,</b> even if well-educated, cannot produce at the quality levels demanded in high-value-added industries and cannot market what they produce even in low-value-added industries such as textiles or shoes. Put bluntly, multinational companies possess a variety of factors that <b>developing</b> <b>countries</b> must have if they are {{to participate in the}} global economy.|$|E

5|$|Outsourcing {{is among}} some of the many reasons for {{increased}} competition within <b>developing</b> <b>countries.</b> Aside from being a reason for competition, many First World countries see outsourcing, in particular offshore outsourcing, as an opportunity for increased income. As a consequence, the skill level of production in foreign countries handling the outsourced services increases within the economy; and the skill level within the domestic <b>developing</b> <b>countries</b> can decrease. It is because of competition (including outsourcing) that Robert Feenstra and Gordon Hanson predict {{that there will be a}} rise of 15–33 percent in inequality amongst these countries.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{two models}} {{to study the}} impact of outsourcing on wage inequality between skilled and unskilled labor in the <b>developed</b> <b>country</b> and the <b>developing</b> <b>country.</b> The first model assumes symmetric production technologies in both countries, and predicts that outsourcing will increase wage inequality in the <b>developed</b> <b>country,</b> but decrease wage inequality in the <b>developing</b> <b>country.</b> The second model assumes asymmetric technologies {{in the production of}} the intermediate good and predicts that outsourcing can lead to an increase in wage inequality in both the <b>developed</b> <b>country</b> and the <b>developing</b> <b>country.</b> Key words: wage inequality, endogenous outsourcin...|$|R

5|$|About 222million {{women who}} want to avoid {{pregnancy}} in <b>developing</b> <b>countries</b> are not using a modern birth control method. Birth control use in <b>developing</b> <b>countries</b> has decreased the number of deaths during or around the time of pregnancy by 40% (about 270,000 deaths prevented in 2008) and could prevent 70% if the full demand for birth control were met. By lengthening the time between pregnancies, birth control can improve adult women's delivery outcomes and the survival of their children. In the developing world women's earnings, assets, weight, and their children's schooling and health all improve with greater access to birth control. Birth control increases economic growth because of fewer dependent children, more women participating in the workforce, and less use of scarce resources.|$|E

40|$|Summary. - Export {{development}} {{benefits are}} generated by links between <b>developed</b> <b>country</b> buyers and <b>developing</b> <b>country</b> suppliers. These relationships reduce {{barriers to entry}} into <b>developed</b> <b>country</b> markets by acting as conduits for information about marketing and production technology and by providing access to larger industry networks. Benefits are maximized when the relationships are collaborative and long term. In this paper, bicycle and footwear imports into the United States are used to illustrate the formation, maintenance, and effects on <b>developing</b> <b>country</b> reputations of buyer-seller relationships. Public efforts to support <b>developing</b> <b>country</b> firms in forming and maintaining long-term, collaborative relationships are also discussed. 1...|$|R
40|$|Most of the {{previous}} analyses on the work ethic posit that it occurs {{within the context of}} the job. The article suggests that the work ethic is, in part, a function of different socioeconomic environments and work ethics. The degree of additional labor pursued is a function of the variance in socioeconomic development between less <b>developed</b> <b>countries</b> and highly <b>developed</b> <b>countries.</b> The addition of the socioeconomic variable to the backward bending supply curve causes several questions to arise. These questions concern the value of additional money income compared with the loss of leisure time or the amount of additional goods an individual is able to purchase with the income from the additional labor. The current article suggests that the nature of this labor-leisure tradeoff differs for males in highly <b>developed</b> <b>countries</b> as compared to males in lesser <b>developed</b> <b>countries.</b> Partly due to the pooling of family income, males in lesser <b>developed</b> <b>countries</b> have a greater preference for leisure over consumption. Due to these differences, the labor mobility of the female gender varies between highly <b>developed</b> <b>countries</b> and lesser <b>developed</b> <b>countries.</b> Specifically, male workers in highly <b>developed</b> <b>countries</b> inhibit the mobility of women in the work force, while the opposite is true in lesser <b>developed</b> <b>countries...</b>|$|R
5|$|Given {{the limited}} {{resources}} of many developing nations, funding vitally effects how emergency medicine {{fits into the}} health system. Preventive care is {{a crucial part of}} healthcare in <b>developing</b> <b>countries,</b> and {{it may be difficult to}} budget for emergency medicine without cutting into those resources. This is a particular problem for poorer nations such as Zambia, which had a per capita health expenditure of 23 US dollars in 2003. Regardless of the amount of preventive care available, health problems requiring immediate attention will still occur, and emergency medical programs could increase access to care. Kobusingye et al. argue that expanding emergency medicine does not need to be unreasonably expensive, particularly if <b>developing</b> <b>countries</b> focus on low-cost but effective treatments administered by first responders.|$|E

50|$|Technology, however, is not {{the only}} factor. Trade and the effects of {{globalization}} also play roles in affecting the relative demand for skilled labor.

5|$|Rotavirus A, which {{accounts}} for more than 90% of rotavirus gastroenteritis in humans, is endemic worldwide.

Rotavirus is the leading single cause of severe diarrhoea among infants and children, is responsible for {{about a third of the}} cases requiring hospitalisation, and causes 37% of deaths attributable to diarrhoea and 5% of all deaths in children younger than five. Boys are twice as likely as girls to be admitted to hospital for rotavirus.|$|E
5|$|Some {{challenges}} faced in international emergency medicine include immature or non-existent training programs, {{a lack of}} adequate emergency transport, a shortage of resources to fund emergency medicine development, and an absence of research that could inform <b>developing</b> <b>countries</b> how to best spend the resources they devote to emergency medicine. Additionally, the standards and methods used in countries with mature EMSs are not always suited for use in <b>developing</b> <b>countries</b> {{due to a lack}} of infrastructure, shortage of funds, or local demographics. Ambulances, the developed country standard, are costly and not practical for the road conditions present in many countries; instead, a variety of modes of transportation are used. Furthermore, in place of expensive medication and equipment, <b>developing</b> <b>countries</b> often opt for cheaper if slightly less effective alternatives. Although it may seem that increasing availability to emergency medicine must improve health, there is little empirical evidence to directly support that claim or to point out which methods are most effective in improving patient health. Evidence-based medicine seeks to address this issue by rigorously studying the effects of different interventions instead of relying on logic or tradition.|$|E
