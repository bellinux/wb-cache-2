40|$|This paper aims to {{highlight}} {{the importance of the}} accurate computational modelling of both the inlet and outlet exhaust hood boundary conditions. The computations presented are calculated using the public domain low pressure <b>exhaust</b> <b>diffuser</b> test case proposed by Burton in 2012. The original test case did not include the effect of tip leakage on diffuser flows, but this paper describes the inclusion of tip leakage and the results are shown to be in line with the outputs produced by other authors. The key advance in this paper is that calculations were conducted with a representative condenser pressure gradient caused by the temperature variation inside the condenser tube nest. It is shown that accurately modelling the exit boundary calculation has a large influence on the flow structure and a smaller influence on the pressure recovery inside the <b>exhaust</b> <b>diffuser.</b> This influence is smaller than that seen by other authors when including unsteady effects or accounting for the circumferential non-uniformity of the turbine exit flow but will need to be included in design calculations as diffuser design advances...|$|E

40|$|Low {{pressure}} (LP) exhaust hoods are {{an important}} component of steam turbines. The aerodynamic loss of LP exhaust hoods is almost the same as those of the stator and rotor blading in LP steam turbines. Designing high performance LP exhaust hoods should lead further enhancement of steam turbine efficiency. This paper presents the results of exhaust hood computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analyses using last stage exit velocity distributions measured in a full-scale development steam turbine as the inlet boundary condition to improve the accuracy of the CFD analysis. One of the main difficulties in predicting the aerodynamic performance of the exhaust hoods is the unsteady boundary layer separation of <b>exhaust</b> hood <b>diffusers.</b> A highly accurate unsteady numerical analysis is introduced in order to simulate the diffuser flows in LP exhaust hoods. Compressible Navier-Stokes equations and mathematical models for nonequilibrium condensation are solved using the high-order high-resolution finite-difference method based on the fourth-order compact MUSCL TVD scheme, Roe’s approximate Riemann solver, and the LU-SGS scheme. The SST turbulence model is also solved for evaluating the eddy viscosity.

40|$|Performance of an axial <b>exhaust</b> <b>diffuser</b> {{downstream}} of an un-shrouded {{turbine rotor}} is computationally analyzed. Three-dimensional analysis of two turbine stage-exhaust diffuser configurations has been performed. In one case, the turbine rotor is shrouded {{and in the}} second case, the rotor is un-shrouded. The static pressure recovery coefficient in the <b>exhaust</b> <b>diffuser</b> is used as the diffuser performance parameter. It has been found that the over the tip leakage flow in the un-shrouded rotor emerges as a swirling wall jet at the upper wall of the diffuser. The case of the shrouded rotor produced no wall jet {{at the entrance to the}} diffuser and the turbine exit flow was “quasi-uniform”. The presence of the wall jet allowed the annular diffuser outer wall angle at stall point to increase from 12 ° (in the shrouded rotor case) to 18 ° in the un-shrouded turbine. By changing the angular speed of the rotor, the effect of the swirl in the turbine exit plane on the performance of the diffuser was explored. In the shrouded rotor case, the diffuser recovers higher static pressure when the inlet is swirl-free. In this case, the performance of the diffuser is independent of whether the turbine exit flow has co- or counter-swirl. However, in the presence of un-shrouded rotors, higher static pressure recovery was achieved when the core flow possessed slight counter-swirl. This observation was more pronounced when larger diffuser upper wall angles were considered...|$|E

40|$|<b>Exhaust</b> <b>diffusers</b> are {{utilized}} {{to recover the}} residual kinetic energy of the last turbine stage. The investigated diffuser consists of an annular duct and an attached Carnot diffuser. The baseline diffuser of the investigated gas turbine features a blunt end at hub, which leads to an extensive separated flow region in the Carnot diffuser. In {{order to reduce the}} separation size and the implicated losses, four different hub extension geometries and the baseline are examined numerically and experimentally for two operating conditions. The wind tunnel tests are compared to the numerical results, which are obtained by using the CFD code TRACE. Three competing performance parameters are used for analysis: pressure recovery, total pressure loss and flow uniformity factor. The investigated hub extensions lead to a reduction of the separation zones downstream of the hubs end. This results in a better diffuser performance in terms of pressure recovery and pressure loss of all extensions compared to the baseline. As expected, the ellipsoidal extension gives the highest pressure recovery for an infinite Carnot diffuser length. At the given length of the Carnot in this case, the Hollow Cylinder lead to the best compromise for all performance parameters. In sum, the choice of the geometry depends on the available length of the Carnot diffuser and its related costs...|$|R

A new concept of the combination of indoor heat sources and the exhaust outlet was also employed in this investigation. The results showed that the indoor thermal environment and energy saving were greatly improved by combining the exhaust outlets with some of the room’s heat sources. For further improvement, this concept was also used along with a novel local exhaust ventilation system in the modelled office room. This system was adopted and developed for use in office spaces, where the exhaust opening was combined with the office workstation into a single unit. The main aim was to help extract the warmed and contaminated air locally before it could disperse across the room. Three different amounts of recirculated air and three different heights of the combined system were analysed. The results showed a significant improvement in energy savings and inhaled air quality in the room using the new ventilation system. It was also found that the performance of this system was greatly influenced by the height factor. In addition, in this research, the LES method was employed to investigate the complex characteristics of airflow and temperature distribution in the office room which used the concept of combining the exhaust outlet with room heat sources.

In this study, the effects of the location of exhaust diffusers where the warm and contaminant air is extracted and their relation to room heat sources on thermal comfort and energy saving were investigated numerically for an office served by a displacement ventilation system. The indoor air quality in the breathing level and the inhaled zone were also evaluated. The contaminants were released from window and door frames in order to simulate the contaminants coming from outside. The amount of energy consumption and the indoor thermal environment for various exhaust locations were investigated numerically using the computational fluid dynamics techniques. The results showed that the thermal indoor environment, thermal comfort, quality of indoor air and energy saving were greatly improved by combining the exhaust outlets with some of the room’s heat sources such as ceiling lamps and external walls. In particular, a 25. 0 % of energy saving was achieved by combining the <b>exhaust</b> <b>diffuser</b> with room’s ceiling lamps. In addition, locating the <b>exhaust</b> <b>diffuser</b> near the heat sources also reduced the cooling coil load by 13. 8 %.

Exhaust-diffuser configurations investigated were (1) cylindrical diffusers, (2) diffusers with contraction, and (3) diffusers including a right-angle turn. Cylindrical diffusers were evaluated with primary nozzles of various area ratios and types, as well as two clustered configurations; the other diffusers were evaluated with individual nozzles of constant area ratio and varied type. Air was the working fluid, except for two check points obtained with JP- 4 fuel and liquid-oxygen rocket engines and cylindrical diffusers. The minimum length-diameter ratio of cylindrical diffusers was about 6 for minimum pressure-ratio requirements. With cylindrical diffusers of adequate length, the pressure-ratio requirements were primarily a function of the ratio of diffuser to nozzle-throat areas and were essentially independent of primary-nozzle type (including two clustered configurations) or area ratio. The two check points obtained with rocket engines indicated the pressure-ratio requirements at given ratios of diffuser to nozzle-throat areas were lowered, as compared with the requirements with air, {{as a result of the}} reduced ratio of specific heats. The minimum length-diameter ratio of the contraction throat of convergent-divergent diffusers was also about 6 for minimum pressure-ratio requirements. With adequate contraction-throat length, the pressure-ratio requirements of such diffusers were appreciably below those of comparable cylindrical diffusers when used with conical and cutoff-isentropic nozzles, but not when used with a bell nozzle. Minimum pressure-ratio requirements of a diffuser including a simple long-radius right-angle turn at maximum diffuser area, obtained with the center of radius of the turn a minimum of 2 diffuser diameters downstream of the nozzle exit, were not appreciably above those of a comparable optimum cylindrical diffuser.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{intended}} to clarify some of the rather well-known aerodynamic phenomena. It is also intended to pique {{the interest of the}} layman as well as the professional. All aerodynamic forces on a surface are caused by collisions of fluid particles with the surface. While the standard approach to fluid dynamics, which is founded on the fluid approximation, is effective in providing a means of calculating various behavior and properties, it begs the question of causality. The determination of the causes of many of the most important aerodynamic effects requires a microscopic examination of the fluid and of the surface with which it interacts. The Kutta-Joukowski theorem is investigated from first physical principles.

To validate the computational fluid dynamics simulations, temperature, air velocity and CO 2 concentration were measured and compared. The simulation results of various combinations of ceiling and floor-based air distribution systems show that the exhaust should be located above the occupant and the window in summer; due to the large thermal plume as heat sources that could be generated by {{the window and the}} occupant. Whereas in winter, the supply should be located on the ceiling far from the window and the exhaust should be positioned on the floor near the occupant; as the downward airflow around the cold window surface would become more dominant when compared to the upward airflow associated with any other heat sources.

Both valves have electro-hydraulic actuators which are operated via two hardware outputs to the two coils of the electro-hydraulic actuators. Undesirable compressor operation is prevented via the compressor pressure ratio limit controller (also known as π controller). The function of the cool air limit controller is to rule out mode of operations, which leads to inadequate flow of cooling air to the turbine blades. The system exhausted temperature is being controlled by the IGVs by varying the air mass flow into the combustion chamber.

Dr. Walker's proposed explanation of the variation of rotor wake periodic-average axial-velocity profile with rotor sampling position (see Fig. 6 of [6]) in terms of rotor wake "slip flow " accumulation seems plausible. Perhaps this effect and the IGV wake segment slip flow effect proposed in the present paper both contribute to the trends observed. More definitive data, especially for what is happening at different axial distances downstream from a blade row trailing edge, would help clear up the fluid mechanics involved.

Strutlets are a novel flow-improving vane concept intended to improve the efficiency of flow in turbine exhausts. Strutlets can help reduce turbine back pressure, and incrementally improve turbine efficiency, increase power, and reduce greenhouse gas emmission. The long-term goal is a 0. 5 percent improvement of each item, averaged over the US gas turbine fleet. The strutlets were tested in a physical scale model of a gas turbine <b>exhaust</b> <b>diffuser.</b> The test flow passage is a straight, annular diffuser with three sets of struts. At the end of Phase 1, the ability of strutlets to keep flow attached to struts was demonstrated, but the strutlet drag was too high for a net efficiency advantage. An independently sponsored followup project did develop a highly-modified low-drag strutlet. In combination with other flow improving vanes, complicance to the stated goals was demonstrated for for simple cycle power plants, and {{to most of the}} goals for combined cycle power plants using this particular exhaust geometry. Importantly, low frequency diffuser noise was reduced by 5 dB or more, compared to the baseline. Appolicability to other diffuser geometries is yet to be demonstrated...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{jet engine}} {{maintenance}} process is complex, expensive and time-consuming. It often requires engine disassembly or boroscopic examinations. In order {{to accelerate the}} process and reduce the down time of an engine we intend to develop a method to locate and characterize defects and damage at an early state, without having to disassemble the engine. The assumption is that various defects in the hot gas path of an engine have a noticeable impact on the spatial density distribution of the exhaust jet of an engine. The resulting differences in the exhaust jet pattern will be measured with the Background Oriented Schlieren method (BOS). We perform numerical simulations (CFD) in order to analyze the effects of various general defect types on the density pattern of the exhaust jet. The defects under investigation include the malfunction of one burner, the increase the turbine blade tip clearance and burned trailing edges of the blades. The changes in the pattern resulting from the defects are compared to the density distribution of the undamaged initial state. It is shown that different exhaust jet patterns {{can be linked to}} the investigated hot gas path defects. Furthermore, a BOS set-up is installed in a test cell of a helicopter engine with a two- stage axial turbine to demonstrate the applicability of the BOS method for the measurement of small density gradients resulting from temperature non-uniformities. A cold streak was inserted into the <b>exhaust</b> <b>diffuser</b> to simulate an artificial defect. The completed measurements show that the BOS method is able to detect these small variations. The present paper summarizes the results of different investigations. It presents a combination of BOS measurements of the exhaust jet and CFD simulations of defects within the hot gas path as a promising approach for evaluating the condition of a jet engine...|$|E
