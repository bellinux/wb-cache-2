25|$|On 7 June 2001, a Beechcraft B300C Super King Air 350, {{registration}} F-GOAE, {{departed from}} Le Mans-Arnage Airport (LME), France, to Santiago De Compostela Airport (SCQ), Spain, on a cargo flight according to instrument flight rules. Near the destination airport, the meteorological conditions {{were reported to}} be good, and the crew requested a visual approach to runway 17, even though the active runway was 35. Once cleared to land, the aircraft encountered a <b>fog</b> <b>patch</b> and from this moment it began a high ate descent (2000 to 3000ft/min). A minute after entering an unexpected and unforeseen <b>fog</b> <b>patch,</b> the aircraft struck some trees in level flight and with an airspeed of 148 kt. The wings and engines detached from the fuselage, and they dragged along a scrubland area until {{they came to a}} stop. The crew suffered minor injuries and the aircraft was completely destroyed.|$|E
5000|$|One {{interviewee}} {{reported that}} while hunting along Moll Dyer's Run around 1970 {{he saw a}} [...] "very dense <b>fog</b> <b>patch,</b> cylindrical in shape, with the light emanating about eight inches down from the top.... It crossed the stream and went east ... moving across the wind instead of with the wind ... then turned and went south.... But what made it really strange was that it did it twice! ... I'm not {{saying that it was}} the spirit of Moll Dyer. I just don't know what it was." ...|$|E
50|$|On {{the morning}} of Friday, September 3, 1999, a {{malfunction}} at the Windsor Airport Observation Station failed to detect foggy conditions, and no fog warnings were issued. The malfunction was not discovered until later. Around 8:00 am near Manning Road, a tractor-trailer entered a very dense <b>fog</b> <b>patch</b> and slowed suddenly, causing a following tractor-trailer to jack-knife.Reports indicated that the fog reduced visibility to less than 1 m. Unable to see the obstruction, vehicles continued driving into the dense fog and colliding with crashed vehicles for several minutes. Although no vehicles crossed the median, there were collisions in both directions. 87 vehicles were involved, many burnt and destroyed.|$|E
50|$|The latest actual weather {{conditions}} observed at Gatwick Airport were surface wind calm, visibility 1800 yd, mist, no low cloud, and shallow ground <b>fog</b> <b>patches</b> of only 1 ft to 5 ft in depth.|$|R
50|$|The {{flight to}} Maryborough {{and on to}} Rockhampton was normal. The {{aircraft}} arrived at Rockhampton Airport at 7:12 pm, where the crew received the weather forecast for Mackay, predicting shallow <b>fog</b> <b>patches.</b> VH-TFB was refuelled to 700 gallons, giving sufficient range to continue on to Townsville if fog {{made it impossible to}} land in Mackay.|$|R
40|$|Environmental chamber creates {{realistic}} fog {{and rain}} effects in aircraft simulator. It reproduces clouds, homogeneous <b>fog,</b> <b>patches</b> of <b>fog,</b> rain and fog, and rain only. It is used with real time digital computer, color computer generated image display that simulates airport lights, or color television camera that produces moving display of airport runway as depicted on model terrain board...|$|R
40|$|The {{detection}} of fog and low stratus clouds at night from satellite data {{has been established}} for several years. With MSG SEVIRI (Meteosat Second Generation Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager), not only has this technique been ported to a geostationary platform for the first time, but also daytime fog / low stratus detection has become possible. While the delineation of low stratiform clouds can now be achieved with good skill, the identification of areas where ground visibility is impaired still used to pose a major problem (see figure 1). From the satellite perspective, this step essentially involves the separation of low stratiform cloud with and without ground contact. Figure 1 : Low stratus / terrain geometry {{and its relation to}} ground visibility impairment. The present paper introduces a new technique to achieve both, low stratus area delineation and ground contact decision. 2. DELINEATION OF THE FOG / LOW STRATUS AREA The first step of the scheme involves the identification of all areas of a SEVIRI scene covered by low stratus clouds, including fog. This is implemented as a series of tests implicitly and explicitly addressing a number of properties assumed of a <b>fog</b> <b>patch...</b>|$|E
50|$|Unlike manual {{weather stations}}, {{automated}} airport weather stations cannot report {{the class and}} amount of clouds. Also, precipitation measurements are difficult, especially for snow, as the gauge must empty itself between observations. For present weather, all phenomena that do not touch the sensor, such as <b>fog</b> <b>patches,</b> remain unobserved. The change from manual observations to automatic weather stations is a major non-climatic change in the climate record. The change in instrumentation, enclosure and location {{can lead to a}} jump in, for example, the measured temperature or precipitation values, which can lead to erroneous estimates of climate trends. This change, and related non-climatic changes, have to be removed by homogenization.|$|R
40|$|The {{automation}} of synoptic and aviation weather observations is {{a global}} trend. In planning the transition from manual observations by human observers {{to the use of}} instrumented readings, either as an aid to or as a replacement of manual observations, the representativeness of instrumented readings vis-à-vis those of human observers and the assurance of continuity of the climatological records are two major challenges that need to be addressed. These challenges were dealt with in the introduction of instruments for visibility observations at the Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA) {{in the past several years}}. HKIA is located in a coastal environment with complex terrain in the vicinity. Apart from being an aeronautical meteorological station for issuing METARs in support of civil aviation, the airport meteorological office at HKIA also serves as the SYNOP station in Hong Kong. A dense network of six forward scatterers was installed along the two runways in HKIA in 2002 and the readings have been operationally used for both METAR and SYNOP reporting since late 2004. A study of the data in the past several years showed that the readings from these six sensors could sometimes be affected by localized events (e. g. <b>fog</b> <b>patches).</b> As it is necessary to report...|$|R
50|$|Tule fog {{is a low}} cloud, usually below 2000 ft in {{altitude}} and {{can be seen from}} above by driving up into the foothills of the Sierra Nevada to the east or the Coast Ranges to the west. Above the cold, foggy layer, the air is typically mild, dry and clear. Once tule fog has formed, turbulent air is necessary to break through the temperature inversion layer. Daytime heating sometimes evaporates the <b>fog</b> in <b>patches,</b> although the air remains chilly and hazy below the inversion and reforms soon after sunset. Tule fog usually remains longer in the southern and eastern parts of the Central Valley, because more winter storms affect the northern Central Valley.|$|R
25|$|On August 26, 1990, Vaughan {{performed}} {{two shows}} with Eric Clapton at Alpine Valley Music Theatre in East Troy, Wisconsin. Some {{of the musicians}} boarded four Chicago-bound helicopters, which were waiting on a nearby golf course. Vaughan, along with three members of Eric Clapton's entourage (agent Bobby Brooks, bodyguard Nigel Browne, and assistant tour manager Colin Smythe), boarded the third of the four helicopters—a Bell 206B Jet Ranger—flying to Meigs Field. In Clapton: The Autobiography, Clapton explains that, contrary to rumors, his seat was not given to Vaughan, but three members of Clapton's entourage were on board with Vaughan. According to a witness, there was haze and <b>fog</b> with <b>patches</b> of low clouds. The helicopter took off at about 12:50 am (CDT) on August 27 and, despite the conditions, turned left towards a 150-foot ski hill adjacent to the golf course. It collided with the hill approximately fifty feet from the summit. All on board, including the pilot, Jeff Brown, were killed instantly. According to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, a veteran pilot for Alpine Valley suspected that Brown attempted to fly around the ski hill, but misjudged the location. The Civil Air Patrol was notified of the accident at 4:30 am, and located the crash site almost three hours later.|$|R
