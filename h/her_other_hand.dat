25|$|With Anna in chains, Ingrid asks Anna {{to recall}} {{the tale of a}} king who lost his only daughter, and as a result, used a mirror to cast a spell on his whole kingdom, making them see only the worst qualities in those around them, leading them to kill each other. Ingrid uses a small shard of the mirror to cast the same spell, the Spell of Shattered Sight, on Anna, {{resulting}} in Anna becoming negative and resentful against Elsa for deserting her during their childhood. Elsa suspects a spell has been cast on her sister when Anna comes to the dining room carrying the urn and saying only negative things about her. Ingrid demands that Elsa freeze Anna to prevent her from trapping Elsa inside of the urn; however, Elsa refuses to hurt her sister, crossing her arms to hold in her magic. Still under the spell, Anna traps Elsa inside the urn, even as Elsa tells her that no matter what she does, she will always love her. Anna realizes too late what she has done when Ingrid takes the urn from her, and Kristoff arrives to stop Ingrid. Unfortunately, Elsa's entrapment was not Ingrid's original plan, and in her anger, she uses her powers to freeze Anna, Kristoff, and the entire Kingdom of Arendelle. Rumplestiltskin appears in the dining room, finding Ingrid practicing her Rock Troll magic, pulling memories from Elsa, still inside the urn, over to a rock in <b>her</b> <b>other</b> <b>hand.</b> Rumplestiltskin asks her to give him the Sorcerer's Hat box; when she refuses, he magically takes and hides the urn and Anna's necklace, saying he will return them only in exchange for the box.|$|E
2500|$|The {{north and}} south walls of the temple feature erotic reliefs. The {{junction}} of the vestibule and the sanctum features {{a variation of the}} famous [...] "acrobatic sex" [...] sculpture at the newer Kandariya Mahadeva temple. Like the Kandariya sculpture, this one also features a couple supported by two women, but in this sculpture, the man is on the top. The woman at the bottom fingers the woman on the left with one hand, while <b>her</b> <b>other</b> <b>hand</b> rests on the ground for support. Some sculptures feature men indulging in bestiality, as women cover their eyes.|$|E
2500|$|Though it {{is seldom}} used {{except on the}} admissions {{certificates}} issued {{to members of the}} Virginia State Bar, the Supreme Court has its own seal which is distinct from the Seal of Virginia. The Court's seal is remarkably similar to the mural Justicia, by the artist Raphael, in the [...] Sala di Costantino, Vatican Palace, Rome, 1519-1520. It depicts a seated female figure looking at a balance which she holds up in her left hand, <b>her</b> <b>other</b> <b>hand</b> resting on the neck of an ostrich. In ancient Egypt, the hieroglyph for justice was an ostrich tail feather. The origin of the seal is not known. There were many prints made of this image over the centuries. [...] During a ceremony to celebrate the Court's 225th anniversary, the seal was used {{for the first time in}} many years on the cover of the programs given to guests, and also appears on certificates of admission and other ceremonial documents issued by the Court. [...] The lesser state seal, however, is depicted on the Justices' chairs and on a medallion over the entrance to the main courtroom.|$|E
50|$|Iconography: She {{rides the}} bull, just like Goddess Shailputri. She has four arms, holding a Trishul {{in one of}} her right hands and depicts the Abhayamudra with the <b>other</b> right <b>hand.</b> She carries a Damaru in one left hand and depicts the Varadamudra in <b>her</b> <b>other</b> left <b>hand.</b>|$|R
6000|$|He {{releases}} her hand. Just {{touching his}} bent head with <b>her</b> [...] <b>other</b> <b>hand,</b> CLARE turns and goes. MALISE remains with bowed [...] head, {{listening to the}} sound of her receding footsteps. They [...] die away. He raises himself, and strikes out into the air with [...] his clenched fist.|$|R
60|$|An arm {{went around}} the girl's {{shoulders}} and drew her close to the man she had glorified with her loyalty and <b>her</b> love. The <b>other</b> <b>hand</b> was stretched out toward Professor Maxon.|$|R
60|$|Suddenly Brandt grasped <b>her</b> <b>other</b> <b>hand,</b> {{pulling her}} toward him.|$|E
60|$|The Professor {{tendered}} Malvina his arm. With <b>her</b> <b>other</b> <b>hand</b> {{she gathered}} up the skirts of the Commander's coat.|$|E
6000|$|... "Give me that letter," [...] he insisted, {{and caught}} her wrist. <b>Her</b> <b>other</b> <b>hand,</b> however--the one {{that held the}} sheet--was already behind her back.|$|E
60|$|One hand grasped <b>her</b> wrist, the <b>other</b> <b>hand</b> {{passed around}} and under her forearm and grasped his own wrist. And {{at the first}} hint of {{pressure}} she felt that her arm was a pipe-stem about to break.|$|R
50|$|Kamalatmika has {{a golden}} complexion. She is being bathed by four large elephants, who pour kalashas (jars) of amrita (nectar) over her. She has four hands. In two hands, she holds two lotuses and <b>her</b> <b>other</b> two <b>hands</b> are in abhayamudra (gesture of giving assurance) and varamudra (gesture of conferring boons) respectively. She is shown as seated in padmasana (lotus posture) on a lotus, symbol of purity.|$|R
50|$|When {{she meets}} Berna and Andoy, Emily feels a strong {{connection}} and empathizes {{with them for}} they are orphans just like <b>her.</b> On the <b>other</b> <b>hand,</b> the siblings believe that Emily could be the answer to their prayers that she could stand as their mother.|$|R
60|$|She lifted <b>her</b> <b>other</b> <b>hand</b> {{to tear it}} in pieces. Bishopriggs {{caught her}} by both wrists, at the same moment, and held her fast.|$|E
6000|$|... "Me darling," [...] {{whispered the}} O'Kelly, seizing <b>her</b> <b>other</b> <b>hand</b> and kissing it covertly behind his open Prayer Book, [...] "perhaps ye will be--one day." ...|$|E
60|$|As {{her father}} held {{her in his}} arms, she put <b>her</b> <b>other</b> <b>hand</b> upon his other shoulder, and still looking fixedly in his face, went on.|$|E
60|$|Stepping up to {{the desk}} of the astounded principal, he laid the points of his fingers delicately upon it, and, with a preparatory {{inclination}} of his head towards <b>her,</b> placed his <b>other</b> <b>hand</b> in his breast, and with an invocatory glance at the ceiling, began.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, Sir," [...] {{said the}} young man. He had the {{frequent}} [...] "Sir" [...] of the subaltern. Scrope {{was in the}} centre of the seat, and the young officer sat down on one side of him while Eleanor took up a watching position on <b>her</b> father's <b>other</b> <b>hand.</b> [...] "You see, Sir, we've hardly known each other--I mean we've been associated over a philosophical society and all that sort of thing, but in a more familiar way, I mean...." ...|$|R
60|$|She did {{not hold}} the same opinion all the evening. The two {{children}} made their appearance at dessert, and there began by insisting on both sitting on his knees; Owen consented to come to her, but Lucilla would not stir, though she put on some pretty little coquettish airs, and made herself extremely amiable to the gentleman who sat on <b>her</b> father's <b>other</b> <b>hand,</b> making smart replies, that were repeated round the table with much amusement.|$|R
60|$|Then Hetty's infrequent, grim, melancholy smile showed itself. She {{took the}} young man's arm and pointed with <b>her</b> <b>other</b> <b>hand</b> {{to the door}} of her room.|$|E
6000|$|And, suddenly, with <b>her</b> <b>other</b> <b>hand</b> {{she caught}} Jon's. [...] "Of all {{things in the}} world, don't you think caution's the most awful? Smell the moonlight!" ...|$|E
60|$|I {{found her}} holding Sylvie's hand, and with <b>her</b> <b>other</b> <b>hand</b> {{stroking}} Bruno's {{hair in a}} most tender and motherly fashion: both children were looking bewildered and half-frightened.|$|E
6000|$|He {{had caught}} {{her in his}} arms--the one {{encircling}} <b>her</b> waist, the <b>other</b> <b>hand</b> still grasping hers. She struggled, half laughing; yielded for a breathless moment as his lips brushed her cheek, and--threw him off. [...] "There!" [...] she said, [...] "that will do: the story was not illustrated." ...|$|R
40|$|Photograph of a {{portrait}} of Mrs. John C. Fremont (née Jessie Benton), 1875 or 1878. She {{can be seen from}} the thighs up leaning on something covered with cloth with her left elbow. The index finger on her left hand is touching her left ear. <b>Her</b> <b>other</b> left <b>hand</b> fingers are folded touching her lower cheek. Her right hand grasps at the front of a fur coat she is wearing. Her grey hair is parted down the middle and drawn to the back of her head...|$|R
5000|$|Lucia and Luis Miguel {{were married}} for years, but their {{differences}} were accentuated over time, especially {{her lack of}} interest for the bulls. She never {{became part of the}} [...] "Dominguín" [...] clan, and the Dominguines never liked <b>her.</b> On the <b>other</b> <b>hand,</b> the infidelities of the bullfighter also took their toll. [...] "In a matter of horns, I was a gold medal," [...] Lucia asserted.|$|R
60|$|And, still upon my knees, I turned, {{and taking}} the girl's hand in mine, I kissed it. She smiled at that, and laid <b>her</b> <b>other</b> <b>hand</b> upon my head.|$|E
60|$|He {{looked at}} Ruth for a moment. Then he obeyed her. When he returned, Ruth was {{standing}} up, leaning upon Fenella's arm. She held out <b>her</b> <b>other</b> <b>hand</b> to Arnold.|$|E
60|$|But Nanny did {{not give}} it back; she put <b>her</b> <b>other</b> <b>hand</b> over it to guard it, and there she crouched, warming herself not at the fire, but at the ring.|$|E
60|$|She {{instantly}} suspended her employment. The {{hand holding}} the damp cloth {{with which she}} had been cleaning the inscription dropped to <b>her</b> side. The <b>other</b> <b>hand</b> grasped the marble cross {{at the head of}} the grave. Her face turned towards me slowly, with the blank look of terror set rigidly on it once more. I went on at all hazards--it was too late now to draw back.|$|R
50|$|Maheshwari is {{the power}} of Lord Mahesh (Shiva), also known as Maheshwar. Maheshwari is also known by the names Raudri, Rudrani, Shankari, Shivaa and Maheshi, derived from Shiva's few names of Rudra, Shiv, Shankar and Mahesh. Maheshwari is {{depicted}} seated on Nandi (the bull) and has two, four hands. The white complexioned, the three eyed Goddess holds a trident, drum and <b>her</b> <b>other</b> two <b>hands</b> are in the form of Abhayamudra and varadamudra. She is adorned with serpent bracelets, the crescent moon and a headdress formed of piled, matted hair, with a serpent on it. And just like Lord Shiva, she also wears a serpent around her neck.|$|R
50|$|He makes {{acquaintance}} with young {{social worker and}} psychology student Ana (Ada Condeescu), who asks him {{to fill out a}} questionnaire. On the one hand he likes <b>her,</b> on the <b>other</b> <b>hand</b> he threatens to kill her with a piece of broken glass, and demands that his mother comes. Toward his mother he threatens to kill not only the girl but also himself, and makes her swear she will not take the brother to Italy.|$|R
60|$|She held up <b>her</b> <b>other</b> <b>hand</b> {{and thus}} stood beside him with slender neck {{stretched}} slightly forward, her lips parted, {{a look of}} intentness expressed {{in the whole of}} her exquisite face.|$|E
60|$|The {{trembling}} was now quite {{beyond her}} control. Softly withdrawing her hand, and laying it in <b>her</b> <b>other</b> <b>hand,</b> she sat before {{him with her}} head bent and her whole form trembling.|$|E
60|$|She {{raised the}} hem of her {{handkerchief}} to her blue eyes and slightly turned her head aside. Hoffman gently drew the handkerchief away, and in so doing possessed himself of <b>her</b> <b>other</b> <b>hand.</b>|$|E
60|$|There was {{no answer}} for the moment. Looking in she was taken by surprise. Two people {{appeared}} before her. For one, instead of the drabbish woman she had expected, Mrs. Hall saw a pale, dark-eyed, ladylike creature, whose personality ruled her attire rather than was ruled by it. She was {{in a new and}} handsome gown, of course, and an old bonnet. She was standing up, agitated; her hand was held by her companion--none else than Sally's affianced, Farmer Charles Darton, upon whose fine figure the pale stranger's eyes were fixed, as his were fixed upon <b>her.</b> His <b>other</b> <b>hand</b> held the rein of his horse, which was standing saddled as if just led in.|$|R

Vasu then rescues Thapki and defeats Shraddha.|$|R
