25|$|Fogg and Passepartout reach Suez in time. While {{disembarking}} in Egypt, {{they are}} watched by a Scotland Yard detective, one Fix, {{who has been}} dispatched from London {{in search of a}} bank robber. Because Fogg answers the vague description Scotland Yard was given of the robber, Detective Fix mistakes Fogg for the criminal. Since he cannot secure a warrant in time, Fix boards the steamer (the Mongolia) conveying the travellers to Bombay. Fix becomes acquainted with Passepartout without revealing his purpose. Fogg promises the steamer engineer a large reward <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>gets</b> them to Bombay early. They dock two days ahead of schedule.|$|E
25|$|Look, if I have a {{triangle}} in midfield – Claude Makélélé behind {{and two others}} just in front – I will always have an advantage against a pure 4–4–2 where the central midfielders are side by side. That's because I will always have an extra man. It starts with Makélélé, who is between the lines. If nobody comes to him {{he can see the}} whole pitch and has time. <b>If</b> <b>he</b> <b>gets</b> closed down it means one of the two other central midfielders is open. If they are closed down and the other team's wingers come inside to help, it means there is space now for us on the flank, either for our own wingers or for our full-backs. There is nothing a pure 4–4–2 can do to stop things.|$|E

25|$|Toad bears {{a similar}} {{appearance}} {{to the rest}} of his species with his large mushroom cap and clothes. He is very small in size, and has no legs visible, with just his typical brown shoes showing. Unlike other Toads, he features five red spots on his mushroom cap and wears a blue and yellow vest; however, his coloration will change <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>gets</b> a fire flower, as his cap's colors will be reversed while his clothes turn red. A yellow outline was added to his vest in the recent Mario games, starting with Super Mario Sunshine. Sometimes, Toad appears with a red vest, though he is most often seen with his blue vest. In the Mario cartoons, Toad has on occasion removed his mushroom cap, revealing three strands of hair; however, the games have never confirmed or refuted this. Toad is also seen with pants of a white color that resemble the base of a mushroom or toadstool stalk.|$|E
25|$|There {{are five}} medical {{institutions}} - UM 1, UM 2, DSMA, UM Mdy, and UM Mgy - in Myanmar. Myanmar medical schools are government-funded and require Myanmar citizenship for eligibility. No private medical school exists at this moment. In Myanmar, admission to medical colleges is organized under the Department of Health Science, {{which is the}} branch of Ministry of Health of Myanmar. A student can join one of the Five medical universities of Myanmar <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>gets</b> the highest scores in the science combination of the matriculation examination. This exam is highly competitive. Entrance is solely based on this examination and academic records have very minor consequences on an application. The undergraduate program is five years plus one year for work experience in government hospitals. After medical school, Myanmar medical graduates are under contract to spend one year of internship and three years of tenure in rural areas before they are eligible for most residency positions. The degree granted is Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery (M.B.B.S.). Further postgraduate qualifications may be obtained as a Degree (M.Med. Sc) and (Dr.Med.Sc).|$|E

His [...] "sheer dominance, along with his physical and athletic presence" [...] are what make him a unique talent.

If neither move would place him closer to the player, the Minotaur skips his turn. Theseus may also skip his turn.|$|R

Grant observed {{that some of the}} Confederates (Buckner's) were fighting with knapsacks filled with three days of rations, which implied to him that they were attempting to escape, not pressing for a combat victory.

He has even been on the receiving end from his All Black teammates when playing for the Crusaders, with Neemia Tialata, Jerry Collins and Ali Williams becoming frustrated with his play.

The transfer smashed the club's transfer record which was previously held by the £1.75million signing of Peter Thorne from Stoke City in 2001. He scored on his debut, netting the first and third goals in a 4–0 victory over Rotherham United. Chopra then would score in consecutive matches against Blackpool, Plymouth Argyle, Bristol City and Bristol Rovers. In the post-match ceremony, manager Dave Jones commented, [...] "Chopra is on fire, he's scored seven goals already and he's shown he will get the goals <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>gets</b> the supply". Chopra finished the season with a total of 21 goals, including a four-goal haul against Derby County. For a second time, he was included in the PFA Team of the Year.|$|E

She insists that she cannot {{feel the same way}} about him since she knows about his children's Polynesian mother. [...] Frustrated and uncomprehending, Emile asks Cable why he and Nellie have such prejudices. Cable, filled with self-loathing, replies that [...] "it's not something you're born with", yet it is an ingrained part of their upbringing ("You've Got to Be Carefully Taught"). He also vows that <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>gets</b> out of the war alive, he won't go home to the United States; everything he wants is on these islands. Emile imagines what might have been ("This Nearly Was Mine"). Dejected and feeling that he has nothing to lose, he agrees to join Cable on his dangerous mission.|$|E
500|$|Krabs values money {{more than}} his own {{well-being}} and assesses the other characters based on their financial value to him. The only exceptions are Pearl and his girlfriend Mrs. Puff. His love for Mrs. Puff {{is so strong that}} it temporarily transcends his greed and drives him to buy her expensive gifts. Krabs tolerates his two employees because they work for little pay and because of their positive impact on his finances, but he is quick to rebuke them if they engage in behavior that drives away customers. Krabs has a tentative father-son relationship with SpongeBob; Krabs often scolds him <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>gets</b> in trouble, but at times gives him fatherlike advice. Former showrunner Paul Tibbitt has stated that this Krabs-SpongeBob dynamic is his favorite part of the show, telling Digital Spy in 2011 that [...] "the aspect of SpongeBob I love the most is his undying loyalty to Mr. Krabs. No matter how Mr. Krabs treats him. I try to replicate that in my own life in every way." ...|$|E

500|$|Film writer Paul Simpson notes {{how closely}} Steiger {{prepared}} for his roles, {{and how he}} [...] "effortlessly" [...] recreated the mannerisms of figures such as Mussolini, in a [...] "compelling take on an enigmatic figure". Judith Crist of New York Magazine, reviewing Duck, You Sucker!, commented that Steiger was [...] "totally without mannerisms, always with manner", and noted that his [...] "silences are stunningly effective". Roger Ebert later echoed this statement, concurring that Steiger lacked mannerisms, writing, [...] "When he gets a character worth playing with, he creates it new from the bottom up, out of whole cloth. I don't know how he does it. It's almost as <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>gets</b> inside {{the skin of the}} guy he's playing and starts being that person for a while". Steiger said: [...] "I always tried to do things different. If I got a role which was similar to another I'd try to do it a little different." [...] His explosive screen performances were an influence on many later actors, including Robert De Niro, who used Steiger's portrayal of Al Capone as a reference for his own performance in The Untouchables (1987). Elvis Presley was highly impressed with Steiger's [...] "powerful and wrenching performance" [...] in The Pawnbroker.|$|E
