5|$|A deeper analogy relates tidal {{forces with}} a {{property}} of surfaces called curvature. For gravitational fields, the absence or presence of tidal forces determines {{whether or not}} the influence of gravity can be eliminated by choosing a freely falling reference frame. Similarly, the absence or presence of curvature determines whether or not a surface is equivalent to a plane. In the summer of 1912, inspired by these analogies, Einstein searched for a geometric <b>formulation</b> <b>of</b> gravity.|$|E
5|$|Although a {{complete}} <b>formulation</b> <b>of</b> M-theory is not known, the theory should describe two- and five-dimensional objects called branes {{and should be}} approximated by eleven-dimensional supergravity at low energies.

The metric encodes the information needed to compute the fundamental geometric notions of distance and angle in a curved space (or spacetime).|$|E

Nativism postulates the innateness of many cognitive functions and concepts. For Fodor, this position emerges naturally out of his criticism of behaviourism and associationism.
