The currently largest project supports the extension of sewer networks {{and the construction of}} a wastewater treatment plant in Irbid through a Euro 62.95m loan approved in 2000. The treated wastewater is to be reused for irrigated agriculture. Other projects approved around 2000 include a Water Loss Reduction project for Irbid and Jerash (<b>EUR</b> 18.2 <b>m</b> loan), a Water Loss Reduction project for the Northern Governorates (<b>EUR</b> 21.7 <b>m</b> loan and <b>EUR</b> 3.5 <b>m</b> grant), a Water Loss Reduction project in Karak (<b>EUR</b> 16.2 <b>m</b> loan and <b>EUR</b> 2.24 <b>m</b> grant) and a sanitation project in Karak and Kofranjah (EUR 15m loan and EUR 1.45m in grants). In 2006, KfW approved another series of loans, including for a third project supporting the reduction of distribution losses in Amman in partnership with other donors through a 11m Euro loan with the objective of saving 2.5 million m3 of water per year, enough to provide 70,000 beneficiaries with water. Other projects approved around 2006 include a project for water transmission in the Northern Governorates (<b>EUR</b> 15 <b>m</b> loan) and a project for water management in the Middle Governorates (<b>EUR</b> 5.3 <b>m</b> loan). In 2009, KfW modified its cooperation with Jordan from a project approach to a program approach, bundling its new funding in a single [...] "Water Resources Management Program" [...] (2009–2014) that covers water loss reduction, sanitation and the use of reclaimed water from Irbid for irrigation in the Northern Jordan Valley. The new program approach is expected to allow flexible responses to changing circumstances.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Two {{modes of}} public funding of {{research}} and development are examined: namely indirect tax incentives and direct subsidies to private sector firms carrying out R&D. As well as considering the arguments concerning claimed advantages and disadvantages of these policy instruments, attention is paid to international experience of the effectiveness of each approach. In particular, insights are gained from a review of empirical studies of input-additionality, i. e. when public R&D spending leads to an increase of private investment. A macro-level study from the OECD presents a suitable state-of-the-art approach for comparing additionality generated by the two kinds of funding instruments. Additionality is implied in both cases, 70 percent for direct grants etc. and 32 percent for the indirect effects of tax incentives. Using these estimates the worth of long-term extra spending in Austria is around <b>EUR</b> 120 <b>m</b> for direct, and <b>EUR</b> 100 <b>m</b> for indirect R&D support. ...|$|R

40|$|Background. Atopic {{dermatitis}} (AD) is {{an early}} and important step in the propagation of the allergic march, enhancing food and respiratory allergies via epicutaneous sensitisation to allergens. Objectives. To determine the prevalence and patterns of aeroallergen sensitisation, asthma and allergic rhinitis in South African (SA) children with AD. Methods. This was a prospective, observational study in a paediatric university hospital in Cape Town, SA. Children with moderate to severe AD, aged 6 months - 10 years, were recruited randomly and investigated for food sensitisation and allergy. They were assessed for sensitisation to aeroallergens by the immuno solid-phase allergen chip test. House-dust mite DerP and DerF, dust mite <b>Eur</b> <b>m,</b> Timothy grass, Bermuda grass, tree pollen, mould (Alternaria), cat and dog sensitisation patterns were analysed.

40|$|Our {{objective}} was to clone, express and characterize adult Dermatophagoides farinae group 1 (Der f 1) allergens to further produce recombinant allergens for future clinical applications in order to eliminate side reactions from crude extracts of mites. Based on GenBank data, we designed primers and amplified the cDNA fragment coding for Der f 1 by nested-PCR. After purification and recovery, the cDNA fragment was cloned into the pMD 19 -T vector. The fragment was then sequenced, subcloned into the plasmid pET 28 a(+), expressed in Escherichia coli BL 21 and identified by Western blotting. The cDNA coding for Der f 1 was cloned, sequenced and expressed successfully. Sequence analysis showed {{the presence of an}} open reading frame containing 966 bp that encodes a protein of 321 amino acids. Interestingly, homology analysis showed that the Der p 1 shared more than 87 % identity in amino acid sequence with <b>Eur</b> <b>m</b> 1 but only 80 % with Der f 1. Furthermore, phylogenetic analyses suggested that D. pteronyssinus was evolutionarily closer to Euroglyphus maynei than to D. farinae, even though D. pteronyssinus and D. farinae belong to the same Dermatophagoides genus. A total of three cysteine peptidase active sites were found in the predicted amino acid sequence, including 127 - 138 (QGGCGSCWAFSG), 267 - 277 (NYHAVNIVGYG) and 284 - 303 (YWIVRNSWDTTWGDSGYGYF). Moreover, secondary structure analysis revealed that Der f 1 contained an a helix (33. 96 %), an extended strand (17. 13 %), a ß turn (5. 61 %), and a random coil (43. 30 %). A simple three-dimensional model of this protein was constructed using a Swiss-model server. The cDNA coding for Der f 1 was cloned, sequenced and expressed successfully. Alignment and phylogenetic analysis suggests that D. pteronyssinus is evolutionarily more similar to E. maynei than to D. farinae...|$|E

40|$|Throughout {{many parts}} of the world house dust mites (HDM) are {{considered}} as a major source of indoor aeroallergens and they are powerful inducers of allergic diseases. Proteolytic HDM allergens are recognised as being able to directly activate respiratory epithelial cells and thereby actively participate in innate immune responses. Although several major HDM allergens lack proteolytic activity, their possible ability to similarly interact with epithelial cells is not known. The overall aim of this thesis was therefore to elucidate if and how major non-proteolytic group 2 allergens from different mite species interact with respiratory epithelial cells. The effects of the structurally related Der p 2, Der f 2 and <b>Eur</b> <b>m</b> 2 from different HDM species as well as the storage mite allergen Lep d 2 were studied in vitro using human respiratory epithelial cells. Also the non-proteolytic, but structurally dissimilar, Fel d 1 from cat, Can f 2 from dog, Bet v 1 from birch and Phl p 5 a from timothy were studied. In this thesis evidence that major group 2 mite allergens activate bronchial epithelial cells is presented. Following allergen exposure the secreted amount of the inflammatory mediators G-CSF, GM-CSF, IL- 6, IL- 8, MCP- 1, MIP- 3 α and sICAM- 1 was increased. Surface expression of ICAM- 1 was also increased following allergen exposure. Moreover, Fel d 1 and Can f 2 induced secretion of the same mediators from bronchial epithelial cells, representing two additional protein structures being able to directly induce cell activation. In experiments using specific inhibitors and siRNA transfection, it was shown that the mite allergens engage TLR 4 and activation through MyD 88, MAPK and NF-κB signal transduction pathways. In conclusion, the novel findings in this thesis provide knowledge on how major aeroallergens, in addition to their ability to provoke specific adaptive immune responses, may aggravate a respiratory airway disease by adjuvant-like activation of inflammatory responses in bronchial epithelial cells. This differs from previously reported allergen-induction of epithelial cells by the clear independency of proteolytic activation...|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of this}} PhD thesis {{consists}} of the synergistic combination of both highly efficient synthetic approaches and molecular modelling tools for the structure-based drug design and synthesis of novel bioactive heterocyclic compounds. The work carried	out has followed two main research lines, namely the development of novel disease-modifying anti-Alzheimer agents and still unexplored chemical entities for the treatment	of Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs). The results obtained have been	presented as a compendium of	publications and draft manuscripts. In	the framework	of the anti-Alzheimer research line, first the hit-to-lead optimization of a practically inactive propidium-related	compound easily accessed via a Povarov multicomponent reaction (MCR) approach (Di Pietro O. et al. <b>Eur.</b> J. <b>Med.</b> Chem., 2014, 73, 141), and the subsequent molecular hybridization with a 6 -chlorotacrine unit through a molecular dynamics-driven tether length optimization, overall led {{to one of the}} most potent non-covalent dual binding site acetylcholinesterase inhibitor (AChEI) ever described in the literature (Di Pietro O. et al. <b>Eur.</b> J. <b>Med.</b> Chem., 2014, 84, 107). 	 Second, the combined recourse to the highly versatile	click-chemistry	strategy, through the well-known Cu-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition reaction, and convenient computational chemistry tools, allowed the rational design and synthesis of a novel series of 1, 4 -disubstituted triazole-based	propargylamines as irreversible	MAO-B inhibitors (draft manuscript) with the perspective to be further linked to a second pharmacophoric moiety to derive novel MTDLs as potential anti-Alzheimer drug candidates. Furthermore, an extensive computation of the BACE- 1 apo conformational ensemble by means of combined molecular dynamics technique and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) method, allowed to carry out an exhaustive study of a secondary transient druggable pocket (draft manuscript) and a virtual screening of 500, 000 commercially available fragments for further drug discovery purposes. 	 Finally, in the framework of the NTDs research line, 2 − 4 -step sequences involving as the key step an initial Povarov MCR gave easy access to a small library of quinolones and tricyclic heterofused quinolines, which	were subjected	to phenotypic whole-cell screenings, leading to the individuation of several low micromolar multi-trypanosomatid hit compounds (Di Pietro et al. <b>Eur.</b> J. <b>Med.</b> 	Chem. 2015, accepted with minor revision) ...|$|R
