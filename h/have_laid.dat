5|$|I cannot help being displeased, {{that this}} {{valuable}} observation, purchasable with no money, elegantly described {{and prepared for}} the press, should <b>have</b> <b>laid</b> for two-and-twenty years, and that no-one should {{have been found to}} take charge of so fair an offspring at its father's death, to bring to light a treatise of such importance to astronomy and to preserve a work for our country's credit and for the advantage of mankind.|$|E
5|$|At the {{midpoint}} of the twelfth century, the kingdom was under the overlordship of Diarmait Mac Murchada, King of Leinster (died 1171). The latter's ultimate overking, however, was Muirchertach Mac Lochlainn, King of Cenél nEógain (died 1166). The year after Brodar's death, numerous sources indicate that Mac Murchada, with a force of Dubliners in tow, formally rendered submission to Mac Lochlainn. In 1162, the fifteenth–sixteenth-century Annals of Ulster reveals that Mac Murchada gained an almost-unprecedented authority over Dublin. There is reason to suspect that his success stemmed from assistance received from Mac Lochlainn. The latter, for example, is recorded by the same source to <b>have</b> <b>laid</b> siege to the town within the year. In fact, this military campaign may have been undertaken to counter the Dubliners' attempt to install Gofraid mac Amlaíb, King of the Isles (died 1187) to the kingship of Dublin, as recounted by the thirteenth–fourteenth-century Chronicle of Mann.|$|E
5|$|Capcom's {{partnership}} with Marvel Comics began in 1993 {{with the release}} of The Punisher, an arcade beat 'em up based on the comic book series of the same name. Capcom then created their first Marvel-based fighting game, X-Men: Children of the Atom, in 1994. Marvel Super Heroes soon followed in 1995. Many of the gameplay mechanics used in the Marvel vs. Capcom series were first developed and refined in these two fighting games, serving as precursors to the series. In 2011, then-current Capcom USA Strategic Marketing Director of Online and Community Seth Killian stated that many fighting game aficionados, including himself, consider them to <b>have</b> <b>laid</b> the foundation for the series.|$|E

5|$|Henry's empire quickly {{collapsed}} {{during the}} reign of his youngest son John. Many of the changes Henry introduced during his long rule, however, had long-term consequences. Henry's legal changes are generally considered to <b>have</b> <b>laid</b> the basis for the English Common Law, while his intervention in Brittany, Wales and Scotland shaped the development of their societies and governmental systems. Historical interpretations of Henry's reign have changed considerably over time. In the 18th century, scholars argued that Henry was a driving force {{in the creation of a}} genuinely English monarchy and, ultimately, a unified Britain. During the Victorian expansion of the British Empire, historians were keenly interested in the formation of Henry's own empire, but they also expressed concern over his private life and treatment of Becket. Late-20th-century historians have combined British and French historical accounts of Henry, challenging earlier Anglo-centric interpretations of his reign.|$|E
5|$|Pelicans have mainly light-coloured plumage, the {{exceptions}} being the brown and Peruvian pelicans. The bills, pouches and bare facial skin of all species become brighter before breeding season commences. The throat pouch of the Californian subspecies {{of the brown}} pelican turns bright red, and fades to yellow after the eggs are laid, while the throat pouch of the Peruvian pelican turns blue. The American white pelican grows a prominent knob on its bill that is shed once females <b>have</b> <b>laid</b> eggs. The plumage of immature pelicans is darker than that of adults. Newly hatched chicks are naked and pink, darkening to grey or black after 4 to 14 days, then developing a covering of white or grey down.|$|E
5|$|While no {{evidence}} indicates Diplodocus nesting habits, other sauropods, {{such as the}} titanosaurian Saltasaurus, {{have been associated with}} nesting sites. The titanosaurian nesting sites indicate that they may <b>have</b> <b>laid</b> their eggs communally over a large area in many shallow pits, each covered with vegetation. Diplodocus may have done the same. The documentary Walking with Dinosaurs portrayed a mother Diplodocus using an ovipositor to lay eggs, but it was pure speculation {{on the part of the}} documentary author. For Diplodocus and other sauropods, the size of clutches and individual eggs were surprisingly small for such large animals. This appears to have been an adaptation to predation pressures, as large eggs would require greater incubation time and thus would be at greater risk.|$|E

5|$|D'Eyncourt, who had {{departed}} Brazil in October {{immediately after the}} contract was signed, returned in March 1911 to display the various design options available to the Brazilian Navy. Armstrong evidently thought the second faction would prevail, so he also took with him everything needed to close a deal on Bacellar's design. By mid-March, Armstrong's contacts in Brazil reported that Leão had convinced the recently elected President Hermes Rodrigues da Fonseca to cancel the design with twelve 14-inch guns {{in favor of a}} smaller ship. The credit may not <b>have</b> <b>laid</b> with Leão alone, though; da Fonseca was already dealing with multiple issues. Most importantly, he {{had to deal with the}} fallout from a large naval revolt in November 1910 (the Revolt of the Lash), which had seen three of the new vessels just purchased by the navy, along with one older coast-defense ship, mutiny against the use of corporal punishment in the navy.|$|E
5|$|Strickland and Melville {{established}} that the dodo was anatomically similar to pigeons in many features. They pointed to the very short keratinous portion of the beak, with its long, slender, naked basal part. Other pigeons also have bare skin around their eyes, almost reaching their beak, as in dodos. The forehead was high {{in relation to the}} beak, and the nostril was located low on the middle of the beak and surrounded by skin, a combination of features shared only with pigeons. The legs of the dodo were generally more similar to those of terrestrial pigeons than of other birds, both in their scales and in their skeletal features. Depictions of the large crop hinted at a relationship with pigeons, in which this feature is more developed than in other birds. Pigeons generally have very small clutches, and the dodo is said to <b>have</b> <b>laid</b> a single egg. Like pigeons, the dodo lacked the vomer and septum of the nostrils, and it shared details in the mandible, the zygomatic bone, the palate, and the hallux. The dodo differed from other pigeons mainly in the small size of the wings and the large size of the beak in proportion {{to the rest of the}} cranium.|$|E
5|$|Temnospondyls, {{like all}} amphibians, {{reproduced}} in aquatic environments. Most temnospondyls probably reproduced through external fertilization. Like most living frogs, female temnospondyls would <b>have</b> <b>laid</b> masses of eggs in water while males released sperm to fertilize them. Several fossils were described from the Early Permian of Texas in 1998 {{that may be}} egg masses of dissorophoid temnospondyls. They were the first known fossils of amphibian eggs. The fossils consist of small disks with thin membranes that are probably vitelline membranes and halo-like areas surrounding them that are most likely mucous coatings. They are attached to plant fossils, suggesting that these temnospondyls laid eggs on aquatic plants much like modern frogs. The mucous membranes show that the eggs were laid by amphibians, not fish (their eggs lack mucous), but the type of amphibian that laid them cannot be known because no body fossils are preserved with the eggs. The eggs {{are thought to be}} from dissorophoids because {{they are likely to be}} close relatives of modern amphibians, and probably had similar reproductive strategies. They are also the most common amphibians from the deposit in which the eggs were found.|$|E

5|$|This Amazon {{is famous}} in their traditions: her house or dairy of stone is yet extant; {{some of the}} {{inhabitants}} dwell in it all summer, though it be some hundred years old; the whole is built of stone, without any wood, lime, earth, or mortar to cement it, and is built in form of a circle pyramid-wise towards the top, having a vent in it, the fire being always in {{the centre of the}} floor; the stones are long and thin, which supplies the defect of wood; the body of this house contains not above nine persons sitting; there are three beds or low vaults that go {{off the side of the}} wall, a pillar betwixt each bed, which contains five men apiece; at the entry to one of these low vaults is a stone standing upon one end fix’d; upon this they say she ordinarily laid her helmet; there are two stones on the other side, upon which she is reported to <b>have</b> <b>laid</b> her sword: she is said to have been much addicted to hunting, and that in her time all the space betwixt this isle and that of Harries, was one continued tract of dry land.|$|E
5|$|Geologists {{believe that}} coast of western India {{came into being}} around 100 to 80mya after it broke away from Madagascar. Soon after its detachment, the peninsular region of the Indian plate drifted over the Réunion hotspot, a {{volcanic}} hotspot in the Earth's lithosphere near the island of Réunion. An eruption here some 66mya is thought to <b>have</b> <b>laid</b> down the Deccan Traps, a vast bed of basalt lava that covers parts of central India. This volcanic activity resulted {{in the formation of}} basaltic outcrops, such as the Gilbert Hill, that are seen at various locations in the city. Further tectonic activity in the region {{led to the formation of}} hilly islands separated by a shallow sea. Pleistocene sediments found near Kandivali in northern Mumbai by British archaeologist Todd in 1939 indicate habitation since the Stone Age. The present day city was built on what was originally an archipelago of seven islands of Bombay Island, Parel, Mazagaon, Mahim, Colaba, Worli, and Old Woman's Island (also known as Little Colaba). The islands were coalesced into a single landmass by the Hornby Vellard engineering project in 1784. By 1000 BCE, the region was heavily involved in seaborne commerce with Egypt and Persia. The Koli fishing community had long inhabited the islands. They were Dravidian in origin and included a large number of scattered tribes along the Vindhya Plateau, Gujarat, and Konkan. In Mumbai, there were three or four of these tribes. Their religious practices could be summed up as animism.|$|E

25|$|In September 1922, West Haven was repossessed by the USSB {{after the}} Atlantic, Gulf and Pacific Steamship Corporation went bankrupt.

25|$|Put the {{breeding}} snails in {{the breeding}} pens in April or early May. Feed until mid June when mating begins and the snails stop feeding. Snails resume eating after they lay eggs. Once snails <b>have</b> <b>laid</b> their eggs, the adult snails can be removed. This leaves more food and less crowding for the hatchlings.|$|E
25|$|When the snails <b>have</b> <b>laid</b> their eggs, {{the pots}} {{are put in}} a nursery where the eggs will hatch. The young snails are kept in the nursery for about 6 weeks, and then moved to a {{separate}} pen, as young snails do best if kept with other snails of similar size. Eight hours of daylight is optimal for young snails.|$|E
