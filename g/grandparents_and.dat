Studies investigating the relationship of grandchildren <b>and</b> <b>grandparents</b> have primarily focused on the benefits of this relationship on the health and psychological well-being of the grandparent (Goodman 2 ̆ 6 Silverstein, 2002). ^ This study sought {{to examine the relationship between}} contact, physical proximity, and emotional closeness with <b>grandparents</b> throughout childhood <b>and</b> adolescence and caring, resilience, and emotional intelligence. It was hypothesized that there is a positive association between the amount of contact with a <b>grandparent</b> throughout childhood <b>and</b> adolescence and a grandchild 2 ̆ 7 s resilience, caring, and emotional intelligence as an adult. Specifically, it was thought that the amount of contact with this <b>grandparent</b> throughout childhood <b>and</b> adolescence would predict adult resilience, caring, and emotional intelligence.

In addition, participants were asked to report on the amount of contact, physical proximity, and emotional closeness that occurred between themselves <b>and</b> one chosen <b>grandparent</b> between the ages of birth and 18 years retrospectively. Results indicated a positive correlation between these <b>grandparent</b> variables <b>and</b> caring, resilience, and emotional intelligence.
