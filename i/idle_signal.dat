5000|$|The power {{reduction}} is accomplished {{in a few}} ways. In 100 Mbit/s, 1 gigabit and 10 Gbit/s speed data links, energy is used to keep the physical layer transmitters on all the time. If they could be put into [...] "sleep" [...] mode when no data is being sent, that energy could be saved. When the controlling software or firmware decides that no data needs to be sent, it can issue a low-power idle (LPI) request to the Ethernet controller physical layer PHY. The PHY will then send LPI symbols for a specified time onto the link, and then disable its transmitter. Refresh signals are sent periodically to maintain link signaling integrity. When there is data to transmit, a normal <b>IDLE</b> <b>signal</b> is sent for a predetermined period of time. The data link {{is considered to be}} always operational, as the receive signal circuit remains active even when the transmit path is in sleep mode.|$|E
3000|$|For {{activity}} selection, the ASA exploits {{the information}} {{laying in the}} level-crossing sampled signal nonuniformity [5]. This selection process corresponds to an adaptive length rectangular windowing. It defines a series of selected windows within the whole signal length. The ability of activity selection is extremely important to reduce the proposed system processing activity and consequently its power consumption. Indeed, in the proposed case, no processing is performed during <b>idle</b> <b>signal</b> parts, {{which is one of}} the reasons of the achieved computational gain compared to the classical case.

30|$|PDR, PSR, CST, and SS are {{important}} measures to detect jamming attacks. These parameters {{are influenced by}} channel fading, network congestion, or link failure. Aforementioned jamming detection techniques have been discussed in [1]. Adaptive threshold like in BMAC protocol is suggested in [1], but it has the drawback of continuously increasing the transmission power, eventually jammer blasting at channel and detector which shows the channel <b>idle.</b> Two <b>signal</b> strength measurements are taken into consideration. The basic average for energy detection fails for a constant jammer. The technique of spectral discrimination is used which shows that if higher order crossing is used, then it works for constant and deceptive jammers but cannot distinguish random and reactive jammers. CST is taken as another measure that is the time a node has {{to wait for the}} channel to start its transmission. It is observed that under network congestion, the CST is greater than those of random and reactive jammers.|$|R
40|$|Lowering {{the energy}} {{required}} by base stations (BSs) {{is one of}} the hot issues nowadays in order to achieve green cellular networks. The energy consumption of femto BSs can be reduced, by turning off the radio interface when there is no mobile station (MS) under the coverage area of the femto BSs or MSs served by the femto BSs do not transmit or receive data packets for a long time, especially late at night. In the energy-efficient femto BSs, if MSs have any data packet to transmit and the radio interface of femto BSs is in the off state, MSs wake up the radio interface of femto BSs by using an additional low-power radio interface. In this paper, active (data), <b>idle,</b> active (<b>signaling),</b> sleep entering, sleep and waking up states are defined for the state model for the energy-efficient femto BSs, and the state transitions are modeled analytically. The steady-state probability of each state is derived thoroughly using a semi-Markov approach. Then, the performance of the energy-efficient femto BSs is analyzed in detail, from the aspects of energy consumption, cumulative average delay, cost and low-power radio signaling load. From the results, the tradeoff relationship between energy consumption and cumulative average delay is analyzed in detail, and it was concluded that an appropriate inactivity timer value should be selected to balance the tradeoff...|$|R
40|$|Very {{recent studies}} showed that in a fully loaded dense small cell network (SCN), the {{coverage}} probability performance will continuously decrease with the network densification. Such new results were captured in IEEE ComSoc Technology News with an alarming title of "Will Densification Be the Death of 5 G?". In this paper, we revisit this issue from more practical views of realistic network deployment, such as {{a finite number of}} active base stations (BSs) and user equipments (UEs), a decreasing BS transmission power with the network densification, etc. Particularly, in dense SCNs, due to an oversupply of BSs with respect to UEs, a large number of BSs can be put into <b>idle</b> modes without <b>signal</b> transmission, if there is no active UE within their coverage areas. Setting those BSs into idle modes mitigates unnecessary inter-cell interference and reduces energy consumption. In this paper, we investigate the performance impact of such BS idle mode capability (IMC) on dense SCNs. Different from existing work, we consider a realistic path loss model incorporating both line-of-sight (LoS) and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) transmissions. Moreover, we obtain analytical results for the coverage probability, the area spectral efficiency (ASE) and the energy efficiency (EE) performance for SCNs with the BS IMC and show that the performance impact of the IMC on dense SCNs is significant. As the BS density surpasses the UE density in dense SCNs, the coverage probability will continuously increase toward one, addressing previous concerns on "the death of 5 G". Finally, the performance improvement in terms of the EE performance is also investigated for dense SCNs using practical energy models developed in the Green-Touch project.

40|$|This {{technical}} report {{is based on}} five our recent articles: ”Self-organizing map based visualization techniques and their assessment”, ”Combining neural methods and knowledge-based methods in accident management”, ”Abnormal process state detection by cluster center point monitoring in BWR nuclear power plant”, “Generated control limits as a basis of operator-friendly process monitoring”, and “Modelling power output at nuclear power plant by neural networks”. Neural methods are applied in process monitoring, visualization and early fault detection. We introduce decision support schemes based on Self-Organizing Map (SOM) combined with other methods. Visualizations based on various data-analysis methods are developed in large Finnish research project many Universities and industrial partners participating. In our subproject the industrial partner providing data into our practical examples is Teollisuuden Voima Oy, Olkiluoto Nuclear power plant. Measurement of the information value is one challenging issue. On long run our research has moved from Accident Management to more Failure Management. One interesting case example introduced is detecting pressure drift of the boiling water reactor by multivariate methods including innovative visualizations. We also present two different neural network approaches for industrial process signal forecasting. Preprosessing suitable input signals and delay analysis are important phases in modelling. Optimized number of delayed input signals and neurons in hidden-layer are found to make a possible prediction of an <b>idle</b> power process <b>signal.</b> Algorithms on input selection and finding the optimal model for one-step-ahead prediction are developed. We introduce a method to detect abnormal process state based on cluster center point monitoring in time. Typical statistical features are extracted, mapped to n-dimensional space, and clustered online for every step. The process signals in the constant time window are classified into two clusters by the K-means method. In addition to monitoring features of the process signals, signal trends and alarm lists, a tool is got that helps in early detection of the pre-stage of a process fault. We also introduce data generated control limits, where alarm balance feature clarifies the monitoring. This helps in early and accurate fault detection...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{generate}} a classifier to classify the state of a diesel engine as healthy or faulty from steady-state data acquired from the engine. The motivation behind the work is the necessity to develop an on-board diagnostic tool due to increased regulations on different kinds of diesel emissions, such as Nitrogen Oxide and Nitric Oxide (collectively called NOx), Particulate Matter (PM) and Carbon Monoxide (CO). This on-board diagnostic system must detect and diagnose a fault using minimum resources such as sensors to reduce maintenance, troubleshooting costs and downtime. It also must detect the faults accurately having the least number of false positives. Thus, {{the objective of the}} work is to build a classification model that classifies the engine state at different steady-state operating points from the data acquired from an optimum number of sensors on the engine. ^ The classifier developed in this thesis is based on Sparse Discriminant Analysis. It is a technique performing Linear Discriminant Analysis with a sparseness criterion imposed such that classification, dimension reduction and feature selection are merged into one step. The data mainly comes from the air handling loop which is a critical loop for the operation of a diesel engine. The fault condition considered in this work is the Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) Cooler fouling. The above mentioned technique was first applied to some data sets that were acquired from the engine using the standard AVL 8 test cycle. The classification accuracy was found to be 68 %. To improve the classification performance, data at predefined steady-state regions was extracted from the original data. Using the technique mentioned above, the engine state was successfully classified into healthy or faulty with zero false positives and 100 % classification accuracy for the fault when the engine was at idle. Apart from the classification, minimum number of sensors required were found to achieve the above mentioned result. It was found that only two variables are needed to classify the engine state accurately at <b>idle.</b> The two <b>signals</b> that were found significant were Charge Temperature and Exhaust Temperature. The classifier was also developed at several other steady-state points that are common operating points for a diesel engine. However, the results at those other points were not as successful as the above mentioned ones. To accommodate all the points, a single classifier was built which had 81 % classification accuracy. A possible reason for more misclassifications at other points was suspected to be the insufficient data at those points. This could mean that the engine was not purely in the steady state at those points. To overcome this problem, longer duration data were collected again from all the points and then again a classifier was built. This time the accuracy was almost 100 % and the classifier was performing great. To check the performance of the new classifier over an unknown data set, the earlier data set was applied as a test data set. This gave a classification acuracy of 89. 5 %. Thus the classification accuracy of the earlier data set was improved from 81 % to 89. 5 %. When this classifier was tested on the raw AVL 8 test data set, the classification accuracy increased from 68 % to 74 %. ...|$|R
