5|$|In {{spite of}} {{numerous}} theatrical triumphs, Mahler's Vienna years were rarely smooth; his battles with singers {{and the house}} administration continued {{on and off for}} the whole of his tenure. While Mahler's methods improved standards, his histrionic and dictatorial conducting style was resented by orchestra members and singers alike. In December 1903 Mahler faced a revolt by stagehands, whose demands for better conditions he rejected in the belief that extremists were manipulating his staff. The anti-Semitic elements in Viennese society, long opposed to Mahler's appointment, continued to attack him relentlessly, and in 1907 instituted a press campaign designed to drive him out. By that time he was at odds with the opera house's administration over the amount of time he was spending on his own music, and was preparing to leave. In May 1907 he began discussions with Heinrich Conried, director of the New York Metropolitan Opera, and on 21 June signed a contract, on very favourable terms, for four seasons' conducting in New York. At {{the end of the summer}} he submitted his resignation to the Hofoper, and on 15 October 1907 conducted Fidelio, his 645th and final performance there. During his ten years in Vienna, Mahler had brought new life to the opera house and cleared its debts, but had won few friends—it was said that he treated his musicians <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>a</b> lion tamer treated his animals. His departing message to the company, which he pinned to a notice board, was later torn down and scattered over the floor. After conducting the Hofoper orchestra in a farewell concert performance of his Second Symphony on 24 November, Mahler left Vienna for New York in early December.|$|E

In the comic book storyline, a group of intellectuals uses a tactile, braille-like language to create a black book describing the city of Orqwith.

25|$|Nominative–accusative {{alignment}} {{can also}} be distinguished through behavioral properties, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>a</b> nominative or accusative argument will behave when placed in particular syntactic constructions.

Morphosyntactic alignment determines which arguments can be omitted in a coordinate structure during the process of conjunction reduction (deleting arguments from the ends of joined clauses). In nominative–accusative, only arguments S and A can be omitted and not argument O.|$|E
25|$|In 2002, Kaurna scholar Georgina Yambo Williams (co-authoring a {{paper with}} Robert Amery), {{provided}} a revised {{origin of the}} town's name. Drawing from her own knowledge and various literary sources from the period of colonisation, she relates that Yankalilla comes from the words yerkandi, meaning to fall to, to join onto, much <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>a</b> disease does, and lya and illa, which means 'place'. Thus 'Yankalilla' is literally 'place of the fallen bits'. This is considered by Yambo Williams to be {{in reference to the}} Dreaming story of Tjilbruke, who carried his dead nephew's disintegrating body from (what is now called) the Sturt River to Yankalilla and then collapsed.|$|E

25|$|Outside Western cultures, male {{clothing}} includes {{skirts and}} skirt-like garments. One common form {{is a single}} sheet of fabric folded and wrapped around the waist, such as the dhoti/veshti or lungi in India, and sarong in South and Southeast Asia, and Sri Lanka. In Myanmar {{both women and men}} wear a longyi, a wraparound tubular skirt like a sarong that reaches to the ankles for women and to mid-calf for men. There are different varieties and names of sarong depending on whether the ends are sewn together or simply tied. There is a difference <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>a</b> dhoti and lungi is worn. While a lungi is more like a wrap around, wearing the dhoti involves the creation of pleats by folding it. A dhoti also passes between the legs making it more like a folded loose trouser rather than a skirt.|$|E
500|$|The philosopher Michael Ruse {{wrote in}} [...] (1988) that Bell et al.′s {{findings}} about the parental backgrounds of heterosexuals and homosexuals were [...] "slanted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>a</b> Freudian would expect", adding {{that many other}} studies have pointed to very similar conclusions. Ruse argued {{that there is much}} to support Bell et al.′s conclusion that Freudian explanations of homosexuality confuse the direction of cause and effect and that the cold and distant relationships gay men report having with their fathers are a result of parental reactions to effeminate or sensitive sons. However, he noted that the accuracy of Bell et al.′s findings is open to doubt for many reasons: their subjects could have been unwittingly giving them the answers they wanted to hear, failed to remember accurately, or suppressed painful childhood memories.|$|E

The Nights, however, improved on the Panchatantra in several ways, particularly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>a</b> story is introduced. In the Panchatantra, stories are introduced as didactic analogies, with the frame story referring to these stories with variants of the phrase [...] "If you're not careful, that which happened to the louse and the flea will happen to you." [...] In the Nights, this didactic framework is the least common way of introducing the story, but instead, a story is most commonly introduced through subtle means, particularly as an answer to questions raised in a previous tale.|$|E
