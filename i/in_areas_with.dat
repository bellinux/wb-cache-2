5|$|Collected and {{described}} by Robert Brown {{in the early}} 19th century, Banksia speciosa is classified in the series Banksia within the genus. Its closest relative is B. baxteri. Banksia speciosa plants are killed by bushfire, and regenerate from seed. The flowers attract nectar- and insect-feeding birds, particularly honeyeaters, {{and a variety of}} insects. In cultivation, Banksia speciosa grows well in a sunny location on well-drained soil <b>in</b> <b>areas</b> <b>with</b> dry summers. It cannot be grown <b>in</b> <b>areas</b> <b>with</b> humid summers, though it has been grafted onto Banksia serrata or B.integrifolia.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{population}} {{now appears to}} be declining, the decrease is not rapid or large enough to trigger conservation vulnerability criteria. Given its high numbers and very large range, this thrush is therefore classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as being of least concern. The perceived decline {{may be due to the}} loss of invertebrate-rich pastures and mixed farms through conversion to arable agriculture or more intensively managed grassland. Adult survival, clutch size and fledging success are all lower in arable landscapes than <b>in</b> <b>areas</b> <b>with</b> extensive pasture. In Finland, the loss of ancient forests is thought to have led to a local decline.|$|E
5|$|European {{occupation}} of Australia has, on the whole, benefited black-shouldered kites through land clearing and irrigation for agriculture and grain harvesting and storage practices which provide suitable conditions for much {{larger numbers of}} mice. According to raptor researcher Dr Stephen Debus, this species did not suffer from eggshell thinning {{during the period of}} DDT use in Australia, though he believes it is possible that secondary poisoning may occur from rodenticides used during mouse plagues or from pesticides used during locust plagues. Populations <b>in</b> <b>areas</b> <b>with</b> high sheep and rabbit numbers may decline, as these animals compact the soil and reduce the available habitat for mice.|$|E
5|$|Grasses {{generally}} comprise {{at least}} 80 {{percent of the}} hartebeest's diet, but they account for over 95 percent of their food in the wet season, October to May.

5|$|<b>In</b> <b>areas</b> <b>with</b> {{wet and dry}} seasons, soil {{nutrients}} diminish {{and erosion}} increases during the wet season. Animals have adaptation and survival strategies for the wetter regime. The previous dry season leads to food shortages into the wet season, as the crops have yet to mature. Developing countries have noted that their populations show seasonal weight fluctuations due to food shortages seen before the first harvest, which occurs late in the wet season. Rain may be harvested {{through the use of}} rainwater tanks; treated to potable use or for non-potable use indoors or for irrigation. Excessive rain during short periods of time can cause flash floods.|$|E

40|$|Background. Iodized salt is {{universal}} effort to eliminate iodine deficiency disorders (IDD). Iodine consentration in iodized salt {{needs to be}} evaluated due to many cases of hypothyroid and hyperthyroidism. Objective. The {{purpose of this study}} was to describe whether iodized salt consumed by peoples contributes to hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism cases. Method. This was a descriptive study <b>in</b> <b>area</b> <b>with</b> the highest cases of hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism based on data from Klinik Litbang GAKI Magelang 2005 - 2012. Samples were taken using purposive sampling with a sample size of 90 households per <b>area.</b> <b>Area</b> <b>with</b> the highest case of hyperthyroidism is Mertoyudan Sub District while <b>area</b> <b>with</b> the highest case of hypothyroidism is Salaman Sub Districts, both in Magelang District. Iodine content in salt was by taking sample of salt from households which used for daily consumption. Statistic analysed used were independent sample t test and Chi Square. Result. The results showed that salt consumed <b>in</b> both <b>areas</b> already contains iodine. Salt iodine content level <b>in</b> <b>area</b> <b>with</b> the highest hyperthyroidism (55. 1 ± 23. 84 ppm) was higher than <b>in</b> the <b>area</b> <b>with</b> the highest hypothyroidism (49. 79 ± 39. 28 ppm). According to the category of iodine content in salt, iodine content below standards ( 80 ppm) is higher <b>in</b> <b>area</b> <b>with</b> the highest hyperthyroidism (13. 2 percent). However iodine content <b>in</b> both <b>areas</b> showed no significant difference (p= 0. 27). Conclusion. Iodized salt consumption does not contribute to the high case of hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. Salt consumed <b>in</b> <b>area</b> <b>with</b> the highest cases of hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism already contains iodine as standard. It is possible that there are other factors that cause high incidence of hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism <b>in</b> those <b>areas</b> that needs further research.
