The classification of <b>directed</b> <b>energy</b> <b>weapons</b> microwave (DEWM) is intro-duced together with basic block diagrams of a particular class of DEWM. In the paper, methods for designing virca-tor pulsed power supply, axial vircator structure, meas-urement methods and experimental results are presented. The vircator in electromagnetic ammunition is powered by magneto-cumulative generator and in weapons for defense of objects (WDO), it is powered by Marx generator.
