5|$|Cosimo became perturbed by the {{question}} of the Tuscan Succession following the death of his mother. Ferdinando was lacking any children, as was Anna Maria Luisa. The latter, who was high in her father's estimation, put forward a German princess to marry Gian Gastone. The lady in question, Anna Maria Franziska of Saxe-Lauenburg, nominal heiress of the Duchy of Saxe-Lauenburg, was extremely wealthy. Cosimo once again <b>dreamed</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Medici cadet branch in a foreign land. They were married on 2 July 1697. Gian Gastone and herself did not get along; he eventually abandoned her in 1708.|$|E
5|$|The nation enjoyed great {{international}} prestige {{during the}} final years of the Empire, and it had become an emerging power within the international arena. Predictions of economic and labor disruption caused by the abolition of slavery failed to materialize and the 1888 coffee harvest was successful. The end of slavery had resulted in an explicit shift of support to republicanism by rich and powerful coffee farmers who held great political, economic and social power in the country. Republicanism was an elitist creed which never flourished in Brazil, with little support in the provinces. The combination of republican ideas and the dissemination of Positivism among the army's lower and medium officer ranks led to indiscipline among the corps and became a serious threat to the monarchy. They <b>dreamed</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> dictatorial republic, which they believed would be superior to the monarchy.|$|E

25|$|Kalākaua was {{the first}} monarch to travel around the world. While visiting Europe, he took note of the grand palaces owned by other monarchs.

25|$|Meanwhile, on 1 February 1817, Montgelas {{had been}} dismissed; and Bavaria had entered {{on a new}} era of {{constitutional}} reform. This implied no breach with the European policy of the fallen minister. In the new German confederation Bavaria had assumed the role of defender of the smaller states against the ambitions of Austria and Prussia. Montgelas had <b>dreamed</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Bavarian hegemony in South Germany similar to that of Prussia in the north. It was to obtain popular support for this policy and for the Bavarian claims on Baden that the crown prince pressed for a liberal constitution, the reluctance of Montgelas to concede it being the cause of his dismissal.|$|E

25|$|The {{legend of}} the {{founding}} of the city of Puebla attributes the act to a vision had by friar Julián Garcés, who became the first bishop of Puebla. The legend states that while praying, the friar fell asleep, when he <b>dreamed</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> festival in honor the Archangel Michael happening in a place with leafy trees and a crystal clear river, flowing from springs. As the contemplated the scenery, angels descended from heaven and traced the outlines of the city to be built. When he awake he drew what he had seen, deciding he had had a divine vision. He communicated the dream to other Franciscans and found the place he saw five days later.|$|E
25|$|It was claimed {{even before}} his death that Moscati was a miracle-worker; some {{said that he could}} {{accurately}} diagnose and prescribe for any patient merely by hearing a list of his symptoms, and that he was responsible for impossible cures. Reports of his good works continued well after his death, with further reports that he interceded in impossible cases. Consequently, he was beatified by Pope Paul VI on behalf of the Roman Catholic Church on 16 November 1975. Moscati was canonized on 25 October 1987, by Pope John Paul II. His canonization miracle involved the case of a young ironworker dying of leukemia. The young man's mother <b>dreamed</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> doctor wearing a white coat, whom she identified as Moscati when shown a photograph. Not long after this, her son went into remission and returned to work.|$|E
25|$|Zamenhof {{would later}} {{say that he}} had <b>dreamed</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> world {{language}} since he was a child. At first he considered a revival of Latin, but after learning it in school he decided it was too complicated to be a common means of international communication. When he learned English, he realised that verb conjugations were unnecessary, and that grammatical systems could be much simpler than he had expected. He still had the problem of memorising a large vocabulary, until he noticed two Russian signs labelled Швейцарская (švejtsarskaja, a porter's lodge – from швейцар švejtsar, a porter) and Кондитерская (konditerskaja, a confectioner's shop – from кондитер konditer, a confectioner). He then realised that a judicious use of affixes could greatly decrease the number of root words needed for communication. He chose to take his vocabulary from Romance and Germanic, the languages that were most widely taught in schools around the world and would therefore be recognisable to the largest number of people.|$|E

500|$|Anonymus, {{the unknown}} {{author of the}} Gesta Hungarorumwho wrote his [...] "historical romance" [...] around 1200 or 1210states that Álmos descended [...] "from the line" [...] of Attila the Hun. A late 13th-century chronicler, Simon of Kéza wrote that Álmos was [...] "of the Turul kindred". He also wrote of Attila the Hun's banner, which bore [...] "the image of the bird the Hungarians call turul"identified as either a {{gyrfalcon}} or a hawk. A bird has {{an important role in}} the legend about Álmos's birth, which was preserved both by the Gesta Hungarorum and by the Illuminated Chronicle. The legend says that Álmos's mother, already pregnant with him, <b>dreamed</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> bird of prey [...] "which had the likeness of a hawk" [...] impregnating her. Historians Gyula Kristó and Victor Spinei wrote that this story, which has close analogies in Turkic folklore, initially narrated the origin of Álmos's family from a totemic ancestor.|$|E
500|$|Richard James Appel (born May 21, 1963) is an American writer, {{producer}} and former attorney. Since 2012, {{he has served}} as an Executive Producer and co-showrunner of Family Guy on Fox. Growing up in Wilmette, Illinois, Appel developed a love of comedy and <b>dreamed</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> career as a comedy writer; he attended Harvard University and wrote for the Harvard Lampoon. Following in his mother's footsteps, Appel instead became a lawyer. After attending law school he started out as a law clerk for Judge John M. Walker, Jr. before becoming a federal attorney, serving as assistant U.S. attorney for the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York for three years. In 1994, he moved into comedy writing when he was hired for The Simpsons, writing seven episodes of the show including [...] "Mother Simpson".

Kyle arrives in Mogadishu, but is immediately taken captive by the pirates and held hostage. He pleads with Cartman to let him and his brother leave, but Cartman refuses, believing that Kyle is simply jealous of his new pirate life. Meanwhile, an English-speaking pirate named Guleed asks Butters and Ike why they decided to become pirates. When {{they say that they}} left because they were tired of things like school, chores, homework, and being yelled at by adults, Guleed responds by telling them that he <b>dreamed</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> simple life going to school, and that his mother is suffering with AIDS but cannot be treated, and his father was killed in an attempt to find food for his family. He never set out to be a pirate, but was forced into piracy to support his family. Butters and Ike end up realizing how close-minded they've been and that a life of piracy is one of hardship and suffering rather than fun and adventure like normal life can be. They then tell Cartman that they want to return home, but he refuses to give up his delusions of grandeur and threatens the boys with death by calling the real pirates to hold them at gunpoint. However, Cartman's vision is quickly disrupted when a U.S Navy ship hired by NATO appears off the coast carrying snipers, who shoot all of Cartman's pirate colleagues with a single gunshot to each of their heads. This leaves Cartman dumbfounded and annoyed.|$|E
