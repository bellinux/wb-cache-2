50|$|Doom 64 plays {{similarly}} to earlier {{games in the}} Doom series; the player must advance through 32 levels battling demons, collecting weapons and <b>keys,</b> and <b>activating</b> <b>switches</b> {{in order to reach}} the level's exit while surviving deadly ambushes and traps. Changes were made to the Doom engine for use in Doom 64, and gameplay elements were altered.|$|R
5000|$|The Room {{presents}} the player {{with a series}} of strange boxes that have a number of physical mechanisms on them. The player is challenged {{to figure out how to}} open each one - typically by undoing a series of locks - to access another puzzle box within it. The game uses a variety of motions enabled by mobile device touchscreens to simulate actions in real life, such as looking around the device, turning <b>keys,</b> and <b>activating</b> <b>switches.</b> Through the game, a story involving the research of an unnamed person into the fifth classical element, [...] "null," [...] which is described in notes found through the various box puzzles.|$|R
5000|$|Ford {{issued a}} nonstandard starter, a {{direct-drive}} [...] "movable pole shoe" [...] design that provided cost reduction rather than electrical or mechanical benefits. This type of starter eliminated the solenoid, {{replacing it with}} a movable pole shoe and a separate starter relay. This starter operates as follows: The driver turns the <b>key,</b> <b>activating</b> the starter <b>switch.</b> A small electric current flows through the solenoid actuated starter relay, closing the contacts and sending large battery current to the starter motor. One of the pole shoes, hinged at the front, linked to the starter drive, and spring-loaded away from its normal operating position, is swung into position by the magnetic field created by electricity flowing through its field coil. This moves the starter drive forward to engage the flywheel ring gear, and simultaneously closes a pair of contacts supplying current {{to the rest of the}} starter motor winding. Once the engine starts and the driver releases the starter switch, a spring retracts the pole shoe, which pulls the starter drive out of engagement with the ring gear.|$|R
40|$|ObjectiveThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{establish}} the feasibility of manipulating a prosthetic knee directly by using a brain–computer interface (BCI) system in a transfemoral amputee. Although the other forms of control could be more reliable and quick (e. g., electromyography control), the electroencephalography (EEG) -based BCI may provide amputees an alternative way to control a prosthesis directly from brain. MethodsA transfemoral amputee subject was trained to <b>activate</b> a knee-unlocking <b>switch</b> through motor imagery of the movement of his lower extremity. Surface scalp electrodes transmitted brain wave data to a software program that was <b>keyed</b> to <b>activate</b> the <b>switch</b> when the event-related desynchronization in EEG reached a certain threshold. After achieving more than 90 % reliability for switch activation by EEG rhythm-feedback training, the subject then progressed to <b>activating</b> the knee-unlocking <b>switch</b> on a prosthesis that turned on a motor and unlocked a prosthetic knee. The project took place in the prosthetic department of a Veterans Administration medical center. The subject walked back and forth in the parallel bars and unlocked the knee for swing phase and for sitting down. The success of knee unlocking through this system was measured. Additionally, the subject filled out a questionnaire on his experiences. ResultsThe success of unlocking the prosthetic knee mechanism ranged from 50 to 100 % in eight test segments. ConclusionThe performance of the subject supports the feasibility for BCI control of a lower extremity prosthesis using surface scalp EEG electrodes. Investigating direct brain control in different types of patients is important to promote real-world BCI applications...|$|R

5000|$|All-new styling {{appeared}} in 1969, {{and the two}} Sixty Special models had distinct rooflines from the other Cadillacs. A 60/40 split bench seat was standard in the Sixty Special Brougham, optional in Sixty Special. Safety was a new priority at Cadillac, which introduced a new steering column {{that not only was}} designed to absorb impact and collapse in a collision, but also had theft-deterrent features such as an ignition <b>key</b> <b>switch</b> <b>activated</b> steering wheel and transmission shifter lock mechanism. Head rests were standard on front seats, while seat belts were provided for all six passengers. The [...] 472 cuin L engine carried over from 1968. Also of note this year was the disappearance of the small vent windows on the front and rear doors. Sixty Special Brougham, at $7,092, included a vinyl roof top (available in six colors), as well as rear-seat foot rests and an automatic level control for the rear wheels which kept the car level despite the weight of fuel, passengers, or cargo. Sixty Special Brougham's sales of 17,300 units easily surpassed the 2,545 copies of the standard $6,761 Sixty Special.|$|R

40|$|We analyze {{theoretically}} the finite-temperature polarization {{dynamic in}} displacive-type ferroelectrics. In particular {{we consider the}} thermally <b>activated</b> <b>switching</b> time of a single-domain ferroelectric polarization studied {{by means of the}} Landau-Khalatnikov equation, extended to capture thermal fluctuations. The results are compared with the switching time formula that follows from the analytical solution of Pauli master equations. In a second step we focus on the phase diagram of a prototypical ferroelectric as described by the temperature-dependent Landau-Devonshire model including thermal fluctuations. Our simulations show the emergence of phase instability at reduced sizes which we attribute to thermal fluctuations in the order parameter in the respective phase. We conclude that, along with the temperature-dependent potential coefficients, thermal fluctuations should be taken into account to achieve a comprehensive description of the thermal behavior of reduced-size ferroelectrics. To support our conclusions, we simulated the electric-field <b>activated</b> <b>switching</b> time for a multidomain system and compared the results to the predictions of well-established models such as Kolmogorov-Avrami-Ishibashi...|$|R

40|$|The {{temporal}} {{dependence of}} the resistance of MnAs nanocluster arrangements grown by selective-area metal-organic vapor-phase epitaxy is investigated at different temperatures. The resistance of such arrangements exhibits random telegraph noise with jumps between discrete resistance levels. The effect is attributed to thermally <b>activated</b> <b>switching</b> of the magnetic domain structure resulting in alterations of spin-dependent scattering between the MnAs clusters of the arrangements. The behavior can be qualitatively understood by a simple model {{in which it is}} assumed that the nanocluster arrangement consists of three domains in accordance with investigations by magnetic force microscopy. The magnetizations of the outer larger domains remain fixed, whereas the magnetization of a smaller intermediate domain (or domain wall) exhibits thermally <b>activated</b> <b>switching</b> between local minima of its energy landscape. The results of the model indicate that the time scale of an actual switching event of the entire intermediate domain comprises the nucleation of a seed domain consisting of a few thousand Mn spins followed by the transformation of the entire domain by domain-wall motion in order to reorient its magnetization...|$|R
