5|$|The {{sources of}} most GRBs are billions of {{light years away}} from Earth, {{implying}} that the explosions are both extremely energetic (a typical burst releases as much energy <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>seconds</b> as the Sun will in its entire 10-billion-year lifetime) and extremely rare (a few per galaxy per million years). All observed GRBs have originated from outside the Milky Way galaxy, although a related class of phenomena, soft gamma repeater flares, are associated with magnetars within the Milky Way. It has been hypothesized that a gamma-ray burst in the Milky Way, pointing directly towards the Earth, could cause a mass extinction event.|$|E
5|$|Sandgrouse are gregarious, feeding in {{flocks of}} up to 100 birds. As a {{consequence}} of their dry diet, they need to visit water sources regularly. Drinking times vary among the species. Ten species drink at dawn, four at dusk and two at indeterminate times. When drinking, water is sucked into the beak which is then raised to let the water flow down into the crop. By repeating this procedure rapidly, enough water to last twenty four hours can be swallowed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>seconds.</b> As they travel to water holes, they call to {{members of their own}} species and many hundreds or thousands synchronise their arrival at the drinking site despite converging from many different locations scattered over hundreds of square miles (kilometres) of territory.|$|E
5|$|Scattered {{around each}} level are gold rings. Collecting 100 rings rewards the player {{with an extra}} life. Rings act as a layer of {{protection}} against hazards: if Sonic holds at least one ring when he collides with an enemy or dangerous obstacle, he will survive. However, all rings in his possession will be scattered; they flicker and disappear <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>seconds</b> if not picked up again. If he is hit without holding any rings, he loses a life. Shields and temporary invincibility can be collected to provide additional layers of protection, but certain hazards, such as drowning, being crushed, falling down a bottomless pit or running out of time, will cause Sonic to lose a life regardless of rings or other protection.|$|E

5|$|Principal {{photography}} for Titanic {{began in}} July 1996 at Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, with {{the filming of}} the modern day expedition scenes aboard the Akademik Mstislav Keldysh. In September 1996, the production moved to the newly built Fox Baja Studios in Rosarito, Mexico, where a full scale RMS Titanic had been constructed. The poop deck was built on a hinge which could rise from zero to 90 degrees <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>seconds,</b> just as the ship's stern rose during the sinking. For {{the safety of the}} stuntmen, many props were made of foam rubber. By November 15, the boarding scenes were being shot. Cameron chose to build his RMS Titanic on the starboard side as a study of weather data revealed it was a prevailing north-to-south wind which blew the funnel smoke aft. This posed a problem for shooting the ship's departure from Southampton, as it was docked on its port side. Implementation of written directions, as well as props and costumes, had to be reversed; for example, if someone walked to their right in the script, they had to walk left during shooting. In post-production, the film was flipped to the correct direction.|$|E
25|$|Flux balance {{analysis}} (FBA) is {{a mathematical}} method for simulating metabolism in genome-scale reconstructions of metabolic networks.

However, Petrosian did not even respond, instead went ahead and won the game. As it later turned out, he switched off his hearing aid, and did not hear when Gligorić re-offered the draw.

500|$|Accretion {{provides}} the currently favored mechanism called the single-degenerate model for Type Ia supernovae. In this model, a carbon–oxygen white dwarf accretes mass and compresses its core by pulling mass from a companion star., p.14. It {{is believed that}} compressional heating of the core leads to ignition of carbon fusion as the mass approaches the Chandrasekhar limit. Because the white dwarf is supported against gravity by quantum degeneracy pressure instead of by thermal pressure, adding heat to the star's interior increases its temperature but not its pressure, so the white dwarf does not expand and cool in response. Rather, the increased temperature accelerates {{the rate of the}} fusion reaction, in a [...] runaway process that feeds on itself. The thermonuclear flame consumes much of the white dwarf <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>seconds,</b> causing a Type Ia supernova explosion that obliterates the star. In another possible mechanism for Type Ia supernovae, the double-degenerate model, two carbon-oxygen white dwarfs in a binary system merge, creating an object with mass greater than the Chandrasekhar limit in which carbon fusion is then ignited., p.14.|$|E
500|$|As the {{high-speed}} maneuvers finished at 13:30, Waddle called for Greeneville {{to perform an}} emergency dive (called an [...] "emergency deep") followed by an emergency main ballast blow, a maneuver that brings the submarine from a depth of about [...] to the surface <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>seconds</b> by using high-pressure air to force {{the water out of}} the ship's ballast tanks as quickly as possible. [...] The rise is so rapid that the submarine's bow rises high out of the water upon surfacing. [...] Before executing this maneuver, the submarine was required to go to periscope depth to check for ships or dangerous obstacles on the surface. [...] After completing {{the high-speed}} maneuvers, standing orders called for the submarine to hold a steady course for three minutes to reestablish sonar contact, which had been disrupted by the high speed maneuvers, with any vessels in the area. [...] In this case, however, Waddle ordered the submarine to change course and go to periscope depth after holding the steady course for only 90 seconds.|$|E

500|$|Metacritic had 81 {{favourable}} reviews out of 100 {{for both}} the PlayStation 2 and Xbox versions; the GameCube version received 77 favorable reviews. Louis Bedigian of GameZone praised the interaction with stages {{as one of the}} best parts of the game, commenting that it adds more strategy to the combat. He praised the return of [...] "classic characters", commenting on their new designs and how different their attacks are. Jeremy Dunham of IGN wrote that it was the best game of the Mortal Kombat series. He also stated that the removal of special move buttons, which caused too much damage to an opponent, was one of the developer's best decisions. With the special moves removed from the fights, and the addition of Breakers, players are now able to stop any combo. However, he called character designs in Deception [...] "robotic" [...] in comparison to other fighting games such as the Dead or Alive series or Virtua Fighter 4. The soundtrack was also criticized for having [...] "basic sound effects". GameSpot's Greg Kasavin commented that the fights have been highly improved with the addition of new fighting styles which: [...] "is clearly inspired by kung fu movies".
