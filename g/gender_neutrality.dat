Although feminist advocacy is, and has been, mainly focused on women's rights, some feminists, including bell hooks, argue for the inclusion of men's liberation within its aims because men are also harmed by traditional gender roles.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. Ed.) -University of Kwazulu-Natal, 2005. In {{the recent}} past, {{teachers}} in South African secondary schools {{have begun to}} give lessons on life skills, sexuality and HIV/AIDS. The lessons are located within the curriculum in the learning areas of Life Orientation and Life Skills. These lessons are guided by policy documents which regulate what, when and how much information the learners must have access to. Issues explicitly concerning gender are addressed in these lessons as well. Although policy documents provide clear guidelines as to how policy should be implemented, teachers are still experiencing difficulties delivering life skills, sexuality and HIV/AIDS lessons. Consequently lessons pertaining to these issues are usually minimised in favour of less sensitive topics. Many reasons have been suggested for the poor implementation of these lessons, some of which include inadequate teacher training, a lack of support structures and services, and teacher attitudes and beliefs. Although the way policy is implemented is cause for concern, this dissertation focuses on the assumptions about gender that are concealed by policy documents, which in turn, impacts on the way these documents are interpreted and implemented by teachers. The purpose of this dissertation is to analyse national and provincial South African education policy documents for the gendered assumptions they make about teachers of life skills, sexuality and HIV/AIDS education. Although policy documents are "based on principles of gender equity" (Tallis, 2000 : 58), this research tries to establish whether any gender assumptions exist about teachers of life skills, sexuality and HIV/AIDS education, that limit how effectual these policy documents are at the stage of implementation. The <b>gendered</b> <b>neutrality</b> of these documents conforms {{to the requirements of}} the South African Constitution, in that they are non-discriminatory. Given the inequalities of the apartheid era, it is possible to regard the use of genderless language in policy documents as progress towards the goals of gender equity. However, not differentiating between males and females is also problematic. Unequal gender power relations that exist between males and females ensure that their experiences are not the same. There are unintended consequences that flow from the use of gender-neutral terminology in policy documents and these include that the gendered realities of teachers are not taken into account and this may well be a reason for the reluctance or inability of teachers successfully to teach lessons on sexuality and HIV/AIDS...|$|R
40|$|Background : Previous {{studies suggest}} that in some {{countries}} socioeconomic differences in family formation are highly gendered, whereas gender-neutral patterns are reported in other countries. Most previous studies focus on single events and therefore {{it is unclear how}} the <b>gender</b> differences and <b>neutralities</b> in family transitions combine into variation in longer family-formation trajectories. Objective : We explore how family trajectories vary by educational attainment and gender. The research asks whether there are gender differences in family trajectories by education. We focus on the trajectories of women and men in Finland between the ages of 18 and 39, and on the 1969 and 1970 birth cohorts. The trajectories consist of states entered via the formation and dissolution of cohabitation and marriage and the birth of the first child. Methods : We give a sequence representation of Finnish register data comprising monthly histories of union dynamics and childbearing. We focus on the number and order of family states. Results : We find notable differences in family trajectories by educational attainment; however, the gender differences in the trajectories within educational groups are negligible. For instance, the proportion of never-partnered and childless at age 39 is largest among those with low education, regardless of gender. Further, at age 39, highly educated women and men are most likely to live in the same union in which they became first-time parents. Contribution : This study adds to previous literature by showing that in an egalitarian Nordic welfare state, longitudinal family-formation trajectories are highly stratified by education but remarkably gender-neutral...|$|R

Most other Indo-European languages include more far-reaching use of grammatical gender. In these, the separate gendered desinences (grammatical suffices) of the words may be given divided by slashes or set off with parentheses. For example, in Spanish, [...] is a son and a [...] is a daughter; some proponents of gender-neutral language advocate the use of [...] or [...] when writing for a general audience or addressing a listener of unknown gender. Less commonly, the æ ligature or at sign [...] is used instead: [...] Similarly, in German, [...] refers to any secretary and [...] to an explicitly female secretary; some advocates of <b>gender</b> <b>neutrality</b> support forms such as [...] for general use. This does not always work smoothly, however: problems arise in the case of words like [...] ("doctor") where the explicitly female form [...] is umlauted and words like [...] ("Chinese person") where the explicitly female form [...] loses the terminal -e.|$|E
40|$|The {{inauguration of}} the DUKE JOURNAL OF GENDER LAW 2 ̆ 6 POLICY {{represents}} an exciting {{step in the}} institutionalization of a subject area in academic law formerly found only at the fringe of legal scholarship and law school curriculums. Often shunned as a political activity inappropriate to institutions committed to academic rigor, objectivity, and <b>neutrality,</b> <b>gender</b> law has begun to lay down roots as a disciplined set of inquiries that enhance the rigor of conventional legal study and offer tools for improving the objectivity and neutrality of law, even as it challenges the conventional meanings of those concepts. There are two principal ways scholars have organized the field of gender law.

The second is to identify theoretical perspectives that cross-cut conventional legal boundaries and model alternative relationships between gender and law. This more theoretical approach is common in feminist jurisprudence or feminist legal theory courses. I find a combination of these two approaches desirable but, as my own textbook in this field demonstrates, 1 I believe that the alternative theoretical perspectives are what makes gender a subject in its own right, as opposed to a set of derivations from other, more well-established areas of study.

50|$|<b>Gender</b> <b>neutrality</b> (adjective form: gender-neutral), {{also known}} as gender-neutralism or the <b>gender</b> <b>neutrality</b> movement, {{describes}} the idea that policies, language, and other social institutions should avoid distinguishing roles according to people's sex or gender, {{in order to avoid}} discrimination arising from the impression that there are social roles for which one gender is more suited than another.|$|E

50|$|<b>Gender</b> <b>neutrality</b> in children's {{literature}} {{refers to}} the idea that publishers, writers and illustrators should avoid marketing towards children through the basis of their sex or gender, and should instead focus on expanding content rather than reinforcing social and gender roles. Gender roles and stereotypes permeate our culture and are established through a variety of means such as visual culture or daily interactions with family and peers. Topics of <b>gender</b> <b>neutrality</b> and gender performativity have been discussed in a broader sense amongst scholars such as Judith Butler in Undoing Gender and Gender Trouble in relation to other aspects of society such {{as in the case of}} David Reimer. In relation to children's marketing, <b>gender</b> <b>neutrality</b> is a growing movement amongst parents, children and publishers. Although there are many homes to gender stereotypes, the books that children are encountering have both psychological and social uses during a time when children are constantly constructing ideas from information around them and assimilating new knowledge with previous knowledge. Organizations such as Let Toys Be Toys, Let Books Be Books and Pinkstinks have been gaining publicity for their work in favour of <b>gender</b> <b>neutrality</b> within children's literature and toys.|$|E
