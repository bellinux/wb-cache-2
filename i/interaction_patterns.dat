5|$|Because protein {{structures}} {{are composed of}} amino acids whose side chains are linked by a common protein backbone, {{a number of different}} possible subsets of the atoms that make up a protein macromolecule can be used in producing a structural alignment and calculating the corresponding RMSD values. When aligning structures with very different sequences, the side chain atoms generally are not taken into account because their identities differ between many aligned residues. For this reason it is common for structural alignment methods to use by default only the backbone atoms included in the peptide bond. For simplicity and efficiency, often only the alpha carbon positions are considered, since the peptide bond has a minimally variant planar conformation. Only when the structures to be aligned are highly similar or even identical is it meaningful to align side-chain atom positions, in which case the RMSD reflects not only the conformation of the protein backbone but also the rotameric states of the side chains. Other comparison criteria that reduce noise and bolster positive matches include secondary structure assignment, native contact maps or residue <b>interaction</b> <b>patterns,</b> measures of side chain packing, and measures of hydrogen bond retention.|$|E

2500|$|The {{availability}} of the S.cerevisiae genome sequence {{and a set of}} deletion mutants covering 90% of the yeast genome has further enhanced the power of S.cerevisiae as a model for understanding the regulation of eukaryotic cells. A project underway to analyze the genetic interactions of all double-deletion mutants through synthetic genetic array analysis will take this research one step further. The goal is to form a functional map of the cell's processes. As of 2010 a model of genetic interactions is most comprehensive yet to be constructed, containing [...] "the interaction profiles for ~75% of all genes in the Budding yeast". This model was made from 5.4 million two-gene comparisons in which a double gene knockout for each combination of the genes studied was performed. The effect of the double knockout on the fitness of the cell was compared to the expected fitness. Expected fitness is determined from the sum of the results on fitness of single-gene knockouts for each compared gene. When there is a change in fitness from what is expected, the genes are presumed to interact with each other. This was tested by comparing the results to what was previously known. For example, the genes Par32, Ecm30, and Ubp15 had similar interaction profiles to genes involved in the Gap1-sorting module cellular process. Consistent with the results, these genes, when knocked out, disrupted that process, confirming that they are part of it. From this, 170,000 gene interactions were found and genes with similar <b>interaction</b> <b>patterns</b> were grouped together. Genes with similar genetic interaction profiles tend {{to be part of the}} same pathway or biological process. This information was used to construct a global network of gene interactions organized by function. This network can be used to predict the function of uncharacterized genes based on the functions of genes they are grouped with.|$|E

In other words, routines in organisations constitute collective action that integrates distributed action elements. Routines are also self-actuating and they do not need voluntary deliberation and owing to this characteristic, problems are removed from the conscious influence and cognitive resources are freed up for deliberative action when dealt with routines. Moreover, routines are processual phenomenon, they are context dependent, specific and they can only be transferred to a limited level. In this regard, successful routines application depends on the context specificities where there exist complementarities between routines and context.|$|E

This research was a qualitative case study, investigating deeply about {{the interaction of}} the teacher and the students in order that the <b>interaction</b> <b>pattern</b> can be described in the mathematics teaching learning. The subjects of this research were a mathematics teacher and all students of class IX SMPLB A YKAB Surakarta. The data in this study were in the form of teacher and students interactions obtained from transcriptions of the teaching learning recordings during twice observations. The transcription results were the teacher and the students 2 ̆ 7 conversations that are further reduced in order to obtain certain conversation related to the teaching learning of conceptual and procedural knowledge. Furthermore, labeling speech act and speech interaction was conducted in the conversation of conceptual and procedural teaching learning. Based on the labeling, speech interaction were categorized into three, namely: 1) speech interaction that was begun with speech act of giving information (BIn), 2) speech interaction that was begun with speech act of performing information (UIn), and 3) speech interaction that was begun with speech act of stimulating information (TIn). Each of the categories was analyzed so that the subjects that are interacting can be examined. The result of the analysis became the data of teacher and students interaction. The technique used to validate the data was time triangulation done by matching the data of the teacher and the students 2 ̆ 7 interaction taken from the first observation and the data of the teacher and the students 2 ̆ 7 interaction taken from the second observation.
