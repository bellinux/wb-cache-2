State registration <b>of</b> restrictions and <b>encumbrances</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rights on land spot is a mean to protect <b>the</b> rights <b>of</b> holders of material rights on land spot and {{people for whom}} those rights are encumbranced or restricted. The current legislation, unfortunately, does not regulate explicitly the registration restrictions and <b>encumbrances</b> <b>of</b> land rights. <b>The</b> objective <b>of</b> this article is <b>the</b> analysis <b>of</b> existing system of state registration <b>of</b> restrictions and <b>encumbrances</b> <b>of</b> land rights and provision <b>of</b> propositions for <b>the</b> improvement <b>of</b> national legislation in this area. Studying <b>the</b> legal nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> categories <b>of</b> ?restrictions? and ?<b>encumbrances?</b> <b>of</b> land rights <b>the</b> author supports <b>the</b> position <b>of</b> scholars who consider them as different legal categories. <b>Encumbrances</b> <b>of</b> land rights arise from another person?s rights on land and are established to ensure <b>the</b> interests <b>of</b> third parties in this land spot, while restrictions of land rights ? is narrowing <b>the</b> limits <b>of</b> subjective law, which does not follow from <b>the</b> rights <b>of</b> another person. While studying the issue it is found out that only restrictions established by a contract or court decision and under paragraph 2 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Article 111 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Land Code <b>of</b> Ukraine should be registered. Besides, information about material rights for strange property that encumbrance land spots, and information about other <b>encumbrances</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rights on land spots are submitted to various sections <b>of</b> <b>the</b> State Register <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Rights on Real Estate. In the conclusion the author has stressed {{on the need to}} improve legislation in <b>the</b> sphere <b>of</b> state registration <b>of</b> restrictions and <b>encumbrances</b> <b>of</b> land rights. Firstly, {{there is a need for}} a legislative definition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> concepts <b>of</b> ?restrictions? and ?<b>encumbrances?</b> <b>of</b> land rights; secondly, there should be a list <b>of</b> <b>encumbrances</b> <b>of</b> land rights, which are subject to state registration. ???????? ?????? ???? ???????????????? ? ????????? ???????? ?????????? ?????, ??????? ???????? ??????????????? ??????????? ??????????? ? ??????????? ???? ?? ????????? ???????. ???????? ?????????? ??????? ????????????? ? ????????????? ???? ?? ?????. ?????????? ???? ??????????? ???? ?? ????????? ???????, ??????? ???????? ??????????????? ???????????...|$|R

60|$|In 1786-7, <b>the</b> State <b>of</b> New York, then in {{possession}} of all powers on the subject, abolished entails, and otherwise brought its law of real estate {{in harmony with the}} institutions.

The main cabin had the great table, as a fixture, in the centre, but that of Eve, somewhat shorter, but of equal width, was free from all <b>encumbrance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sort.

40|$|In <b>the</b> summer <b>of</b> 1926 certain plots on <b>the</b> Agronomy Farm <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Iowa Agricultural Experiment Station were sampled {{four times}} and studies made on <b>the</b> amount <b>of</b> nitrates, moisture, and <b>the</b> {{reaction}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>soils</b> at <b>the</b> time <b>of</b> sampling and <b>the</b> nitrifying power <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>soils</b> as determined by three methods, (a) nitrification <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>soils</b> 2 ̆ 7 own nitrogen, (b) nitrification of ammonium sulfate and (c) nitrification of ammonium sulfate in <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> calcium carbonate. <b>The</b> reaction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>soils</b> was also determined after <b>the</b> 30 days <b>of</b> incubation. <b>The</b> following conclusions seem to be justified from this study: 1. <b>The</b> amount <b>of</b> moisture was not affected by the crop rotations used nor by <b>the</b> various <b>soil</b> treatments. Neither did the variations in moisture content which occurred in these soils have any appreciable effect on the crop yields or on their nitrifying power. 2. The crop rotations on the Carrington loam {{did not seem to}} affect appreciably <b>the</b> nitrifying power <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>soils</b> from plots which were left untreated for 12 years nor those which were manured, manured and limed, or treated with crop residues and lime. 3. <b>The</b> application <b>of</b> manure alone did not increase <b>the</b> nitrifying power <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Carrington loam. 4. <b>The</b> <b>soils</b> from <b>the</b> three-year rotation corn plots showed <b>the</b> largest amount <b>of</b> nitrates present at <b>the</b> various times <b>of</b> sampling and <b>the</b> highest nitrifying power when this was measured by <b>the</b> nitrification <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>soils</b> 2 ̆ 7 own nitrogen. 5.
