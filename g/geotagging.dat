2500|$|Users can {{organize}} their Flickr photos into [...] "albums" [...] (formerly [...] "sets") {{which are more}} flexible than the traditional folder-based method of organizing files, as one photo can belong to one album, many albums, or none at all. Flickr provides code to embed albums into blogs, websites and forums. Flickr albums represent a form of categorical metadata rather than a physical hierarchy. <b>Geotagging</b> {{can be applied to}} photos in albums, and any albums with <b>geotagging</b> can be related to a map using imapflickr. The resulting map can be embedded in a website. Flickr albums may be organized into [...] "collections", which can themselves be further organized into higher-order collections.|$|E
2500|$|In recent years, {{the city}} adopted a more {{proactive}} approach to rodent control known as integrated pest management, {{which focuses on}} preventive measures. Such efforts include developing a rodent control map using <b>geotagging</b> to focus countermeasures more systematically, instituting a [...] "Rodent Control Academy" [...] that trains city employees on rat behavior and control, and emphasizing building integrity and garbage disposal. In 2009, the Health Department began offering a half-day course in combating rat infestations. In 2010, the city cut its budget for rodent control programs by $1.5 million to help reduce an overall deficit of $2 billion.|$|E
30|$|On July 3, the Naive Bayes {{classifier}} extracted 4738 <b>geotagged</b> tweets {{that included}} “rain” as a keyword in the “positive” class. We evaluated this classification. The precision of the 4738 <b>geotagged</b> tweets extracted on July 3 is 93.4 %. Therefore, {{according to the}} observed <b>geotagged</b> tweets using the Naive Bayes classifier, the proposed framework can extract topic-related <b>geotagged</b> tweets with high precision and recall.|$|R
30|$|Two {{training}} data sets TDS for “snow” and “rain” were composed of 2, 500 <b>geotagged</b> tweets. One consisted of <b>geotagged</b> tweets that included “snow” as a keyword that were posted on February 8. The other consisted of <b>geotagged</b> tweets that included “rain” as a keyword that were posted on June 4. In these two train data sets, the <b>geotagged</b> tweets in the TDS were labeled manually. The number of <b>geotagged</b> tweets in the “positive” class, which means including topic “snow”, and the “negative” class was 1648 and 852, respectively. Moreover, {{the number of}} <b>geotagged</b> tweets in the “positive” class, which means including the topic “rain”, and the “negative” class was 897 and 1603, respectively.|$|R
40|$|A <b>geotagged</b> digital photo has {{geographic}} coordinates stored in EXIF (Exchangeable Image File) tags {{in the image}} file (typi-cally a JPEG file). The Create <b>Geotagged</b> Image Database process in TNTmips (accessed from the Database menu) cre-ates a database table that records the geographic position and other information {{for each of the}} selected <b>geotagged</b> photo files. The photos can be embedded in a field in the table or the table can merely contain links to the stored locations of the photos. In either case, the resulting table can be pinmapped in any geospatial view, where the default DataTip for each pin symbol is a thumbnail of the image. The <b>geotagged</b> photo table allows you to use the <b>geotagged</b> pho-tos along with your other geospatial data in your projects. The Create <b>Geotagged</b> Image Database process also can as-sign {{geographic coordinates}} for digital photos that are not yet <b>geotagged,</b> either automatically from one or more GPS logs, or manually (see the Technical Guide entitle...|$|R
2500|$|The Exif format has {{standard}} tags for location information. [...] many {{cameras and}} mobile phones have a built-in GPS receiver that stores the location {{information in the}} Exif header when a picture is taken. Some other cameras have a separate GPS receiver that fits into the flash connector or hot shoe. Recorded GPS data can also be added to any digital photograph on a computer, either by correlating the time stamps of the photographs with a GPS record from a hand-held GPS receiver or manually by using a map or mapping software. The process of adding geographic information to a photograph is known as <b>geotagging.</b> Photo-sharing communities like Panoramio, locr or Flickr equally allow their users to upload geocoded pictures or to add geolocation information online.|$|E

30|$|Recently, a {{huge amount}} of <b>geotagged</b> tweets are posted because of the {{popularity}} of geomobile applications on smartphones. These <b>geotagged</b> tweets are useful for extracting local topics and events (Abdelhaq et al. 2013; Hiruta et al. 2012; Hong et al. 2012; Musleh 2014). In particular, <b>geotagged</b> tweet have been expected to be utilized for analyzing emergency topics like natural disasters (Mandel et al. 2012) and epidemic (Hwang et al. 2013).|$|R

40|$|Photo-sharing {{websites}} such as Flickr and Panoramio contain {{millions of}} <b>geotagged</b> images contributed by {{people from all over}} the world. Characteristics of these data pose new challenges in the domain of spatio-temporal analysis. In this paper, we define several different tasks related to analysis of attractive places, points of interest and comparison of behavioral patterns of different user communities on <b>geotagged</b> photo data. We perform analysis and comparison of temporal events, rankings of sightseeing places in a city, and study mobility of people using <b>geotagged</b> photos. We take a systematic approach to accomplish these tasks by applying scalable computational techniques, using statistical and data mining algorithms, combined with interactive geo-visualization. We provide exploratory visual analysis environment, which allows the analyst to detect spatial and temporal patterns and extract additional knowledge from large <b>geotagged</b> photo collections. We demonstrate our approach by applying the methods to several regions in the world. Keywords—Geo visual analytics, <b>geotagged</b> images, spatiotemporal analysis, movement data, clusterin...|$|R
30|$|In this study, {{we focus}} on <b>geotagged</b> tweets posted on the Twitter site. These <b>geotagged</b> tweets are {{referred}} to as georeferenced documents because they usually include not only a short text message, but also the documents’ posting time and location. Users on the Twitter site {{are referred to as}} social sensors and <b>geotagged</b> tweets as sensor data observed by the social sensors. Some of studies that focused on these <b>geotagged</b> tweets are as follows. Sakaki et al. (2010) focused on tweets regarding typhoons and earthquakes using associated geographic information to estimate typhoon trajectories and earthquake epicenters using dense regions. Ozdikis et al. (2013) also proposed a method that estimated the geographical location of events in the case of earthquakes reported on Twitter.|$|R
40|$|AbstractTourism {{recommender}} systems suggest suitable tourist spots {{by matching}} {{the characteristics of}} the tourist spots with those of the user. In this paper, we focus on an essential source of these characteristics—geotagged tweets. To solve the problem of associating <b>geotagged</b> tweets to tourist spots, we propose a mapping method that infers the region of a target spot on the basis of two <b>geotagged</b> items. The first is a <b>geotagged</b> tweet, which demonstrates that the tweeter was indeed at the target spot at the time the tweet was posted. We call this a “now-tweet. ” The second item is a <b>geotagged</b> photo of the target spot, which we call a “spot-photo. ” We regard these now-tweets and spot-photos as training data, and then determine the region of the tourist spot by inferring the geographical distribution of the training data. Next, we map <b>geotagged</b> tweets from the extracted region to the target spot. To improve the accuracy with which the tourist spot is inferred, we apply a clustering algorithm to the training data. Experimental results indicate that photo-based mapping with sophisticated training data produces the most improved performance over baseline methods. When applied to 4, 559, 643 <b>geotagged</b> tweets, our method maps them to tourist spots with an average granularity of 144. 85 m...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We {{introduce}} {{the idea of}} a spatial search engine based on geo-tags. <b>Geotags</b> are keywords linked to a concrete position. User generated <b>geotags</b> are available from Web 2. 0 portals like Flickr 1 or Google Maps 2. We collected a sample dataset of about 300. 000 <b>geotags.</b> In the following we explain a prototype implementation of a search engine and describe how to compute the spatial relevance of a tag. The last section gives an outlook about our research goals in this area and discusses the challenges and possi-ble benefits of integrating semantic information. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Images with GPS {{coordinates}} are a {{rich source}} of information about a geographic location. Innovative user services and applications are being built using <b>geotagged</b> images taken from community contributed repositories like Flickr. Only a small subset of the images in these repositories is <b>geotagged,</b> limiting their exploration and effective utilization. We propose to use optional meta-data along with image content to geo-cluster all the images in a partly <b>geotagged</b> dataset. We formulate the problem as a graph clustering problem where edge weights are vectors of incomparable components. We develop probabilistic approaches to fuse the components into a single measure and then, discover clusters using an existing random walk method. Our empirical results strongly show that meta-data can be successfully exploited and merged together to achieve geo clustering of images missing <b>geotags.</b> I...|$|R

40|$|Obtaining {{geographically}} tagged multimedia {{items from}} so-cial Web platforms such as Flickr is beneficial {{for a variety}} of applications including the automatic creation of travelogues and personalized travel recommendations. In order {{to take advantage of the}} large number of photos and videos that do not contain (GPS-based) latitude/longitude coordinates, a number of approaches have been proposed to estimate the geographic location where they were taken. Such location estimation methods rely on existing <b>geotagged</b> multimedia items as training data. Across application and usage sce-narios, it is commonly assumed that the available <b>geotagged</b> items contain (reasonably) accurate latitude/longitude coor-dinates. Here, we consider this assumption and investigate how accurate the provided location data is. We conduct a study of Flickr images and videos and find that the accu-racy of the <b>geotag</b> information is highly dependent on the popularity of the location: images/videos taken at popular (unpopular) locations, are likely to be <b>geotagged</b> with a high (low) degree of accuracy with respect to the ground truth...|$|R
