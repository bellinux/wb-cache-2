It was recognised that intangibles contributed to the competitiveness of project based organisations as the review of extant intellectual capital literature revealed that intangibles help organisations to be competitive evidenced in the changing value contribution of intangibles to tangibles and the gap between market and book value due to globalisation and its manifestations. A theoretical and empirical approach combined with an interpretivist approach grounded the research in extant project management and project management practice and addressed some of the criticisms of the RPM, CPM, BOKs and BRM. Theoretically, content analysis was applied on extant project management literature and empirically, five organisations consisting of contracting and single project client organisations participated in multiple case studies in two phases using questionnaires that collected both qualitative and quantitative data combined with deductive and inductive analytical approach to data analysis. Demonstrated that the theoretically derived <b>intangible</b> <b>benefits</b> of project management fit broadly into organisational capital, human capital and social capital and a theoretical framework was also developed. Empirically demonstrated that the <b>intangible</b> <b>benefits</b> from project management deployment are types of knowledge and capabilities. The drivers of and attributes of <b>intangible</b> <b>benefits</b> established that <b>intangible</b> <b>benefits</b> are generic and contextual with implications for the contracting and single project client organisation. By analytical triangulation, it was empirically demonstrated that <b>intangible</b> <b>benefits</b> derived from project management follow the mature groupings of contracting and single project client.

40|$|In today’s {{competitive}} environment, {{a comprehensive}} and economically well-founded ex-ante evaluation of IT projects {{is essential for}} companies of all sectors to ensure a focused allocation of available resources and a value-oriented IT portfolio management. Due to the high complexity of modern IT systems, the implications of IT projects are usually versatile and wide-ranging and in particular comprise a variety of so-called <b>intangible</b> <b>benefits,</b> which are difficult to quantify, such as an enhanced information base or improved service quality. In this context, the paper focuses on the possibilities to evaluate <b>intangible</b> <b>benefits</b> by financial methods.

40|$|Today´s {{information}} society is constantly increasing {{the quantity of}} digital information that organisations have access to and depend on. Despite this dependency, few descriptions exist of the benefits which this digital information can provide the organisation with. Examples of what the organisation can use the information for include business intelligence or in a business process. The absence of such benefit descriptions results in missed opportunities in organisational management and a failure to cultivate the artefact. In terms of a practical operational work role, {{this means that the}} artefact just exists and that there are no decisions, communication and discussions connected to it. Earlier research about benefits in the Information Systems field is focused on describing the process of finding benefit factors from different IT investments and how these investments can be measured financially. The result of this was that it was only the measurable benefits that were taken into consideration. Later benefit management research has shown interest in the <b>intangible</b> <b>benefit</b> factors as well and added this as an activity in the evaluation process. Today´s view is that the benefit consists both of tangible and <b>intangible</b> <b>benefit</b> factors. This thesis emphasises benefit factors found by means of qualitative research in organisations producing Technical Information (TI). TI isinformation connected to goods and services and is a part of a product. The <b>intangible</b> <b>benefit</b> factors found which are connected to TI are semantic interoperability and knowledge. Semantic interoperability is beneficial both for the organisation and the individuals – in the first case exemplified by a uniform working process and in the second as efficiency in the internal communication. Knowledge also provides benefit both to the organisation and the individuals – the organisation can operate without depending on certain individuals and information gives the individuals mobility in their profession. The next part in the thesis discusses information management´simpact on benefit factors. In the case of an autocratic approach, it is the organisation that benefits most, whereas a decentralised management style provides the individual co-workers with a greater number of benefit factors. This proves that information management is an important and decisive ingredient, and that it affects benefit factors. One step in the direction of converting the <b>intangible</b> <b>benefit</b> factors into tangible ones is to visualise them. In this work the theoreticallens provided by a boundary object has been used. This lens adds a qualitative view on cross-boundary information and has efficiency approaches. These approaches are the syntactical, semantic andpragmatic. Via interpretations from the thesis´s two empirical cases, those approaches are "measured" by interpretations and visualised by the three leaves of a clover. This gives the opportunity to describewhat information efficiency, in this case connected to a positiveexpectation, can contribute to the organisation or the individuals. By this procedure, different cases or time aspects can be compared,thereby providing a basis for decision-making, communication and discussion. Future research in this area can be made in different directions – one is to investigate whether the <b>intangible</b> <b>benefit</b> factors can be turned into measurable ones. In this way, the internal organisation can be provided with better knowledge of the digital information's impact. Another research direction is to investigate how the passage of time affects the benefit factors that digital information gives the organisation...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} meet the {{different}} public needs and requirements of contemporary urban society, a better understanding of public perceptions, appreciation and knowledge of the assorted values derived from urban trees is beneficial for improved urban greening. Thus, this study carried out an assessment of urban residents’ knowledge and appreciation of the benefits of trees and the role they play in enhancing {{the quality of life in}} urban systems. The study primarily focused on the <b>intangible</b> <b>benefits</b> (also referred to as cultural and regulating services) of urban trees, because most research to date in South Africa on trees and the benefits derived from them is biased towards the provisioning services of trees in rural areas. The significance and contribution of the <b>intangible</b> <b>benefits</b> of trees in urban systems is often underestimated and not seriously taken into account by urban planners, policy makers and other key decision makers. The study was conducted in three different residential settlement types (formal townships, RDP settlements and informal settlements) in two towns in the Limpopo Province in South Africa, namely Bela-Bela and Tzaneen. Findings revealed that the <b>intangible</b> <b>benefits</b> of trees are seen to play a significant role in improving both residents’ quality of life and the environmental conditions in cities, including the preservation of biodiversity. Findings also showed that urban residents had strong spiritual connections with trees and placed considerable cultural and historical importance on specific tree species and individual trees. Urban residents in both towns had moderate knowledge of the <b>intangible</b> <b>benefits</b> of trees based on the knowledge score that was created for the purposes of this study. Fifty seven percent of the residents had ‘reasonable’ knowledge of some of the <b>intangible</b> <b>benefits</b> of trees, while 43 % had low levels of knowledge. That said, the majority of residents demonstrated high appreciation (98 %) of the <b>intangible</b> <b>benefits</b> of trees (especially social and cultural values), with few residents not recognising these, suggesting that knowledge does not necessarily lead to appreciation. Age and level of education were found to influence knowledge of the <b>intangible</b> <b>benefits</b> of trees. A large proportion (86 %) of residents who possessed tertiary level qualifications had more knowledge of the <b>intangible</b> <b>benefits</b> of trees as compared to residents with no formal education. Findings also revealed that younger respondents (60 %) had more knowledge of the <b>intangible</b> <b>benefits</b> of trees. Factors that influenced appreciation of the <b>intangible</b> <b>benefits</b> of trees included links to crime, peoples’ value systems (their pro-environmental and altruistic values) and residential settlement type. Sixty five percent of residents in both towns felt that urban street trees and trees in public spaces attract criminals and promote crime, while 67 % of RDP and 96 % of informal township residents did not use or appreciate the social and recreational benefits of trees mainly because of the absence or long distances to public parks. A Willingness To Pay (WTP) survey revealed that a high proportion of residents in Bela-Bela (86 %) were WTP a small annual fee in order to sustain greening initiatives in their communities compared to the residents in Tzaneen (53 %). In terms of the planting and retention of trees, it was found that 300 households in both study towns had planted and retained a total of 1 615 trees in spite of the various factors that negatively influenced planting and retention of trees such as residency time and tenure security. The majority (66 %) of informal township residents said tenure security was an important factor to consider when making tree planting decisions, while this was not an issue for formal township and RDP residents. Policy implications and recommendations are presented to help municipalities and urban planners improve and develop effective policies and programmes that will enable implementation of sustainable urban greening programme...|$|R
