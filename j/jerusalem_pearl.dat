40|$|The Middle English poem Pearl is {{a mixture}} of a number of genres. Opening like an elegy, with its initial stanzas heavily indebted to courtly love poetry, it {{proceeds}} towards a dream vision that launches into a theological debate concluded by an eschatological vision of the city of New <b>Jerusalem.</b> <b>Pearl</b> is obviously a religious poem, but, as Ad Putter has observed, the kind of religious and dreamscape imagery it contains, based on biblical sources, may also have influenced the writers of medieval romances such as Sir Orfeo or Thomas of Erceldoune in the construction of their secular otherworlds (2007 : 237 – 41). The two romances in question are tales of fairy encounters, and the following article aims to identify major areas of convergence with the genre of fairy romance in Pearl...|$|E

5000|$|Ptitim ( [...] ; פתיתים, {{literally}} [...] "flakes") {{is a type}} of toasted pasta {{shaped like}} rice grains or little balls developed in Israel in the 1950s when rice was scarce. Outside Israel, it is typically marketed as Israeli couscous, <b>Jerusalem</b> couscous, or <b>pearl</b> couscous. In Israel, it originally became known as [...] "Ben-Gurion rice" [...] (Hebrew: אורז בן-גוריון, órez Ben-Gurion), though it is mainly called [...] "ptitim" [...] nowadays.|$|R
60|$|Now it {{is quite}} true that there is less general human {{testimony}} {{to the notion of}} a New Jerusalem in the future than to the notion of a Golden Age in the past. But neither of those ideas, whether or no they are illusions, are any {{answer to the question of}} a plain man in the plain position of this parable; a man who has to find some guidance in the past if he is to get any good in the future. What he positively knows, in any case, is the complete collapse of the present. Now that is the exact truth about the thing so often rebuked as a romantic and unreal return of modern men to medieval things. They suppose they have taken the wrong turning, because they know they are in the wrong place. To know that, it is necessary not to idealise the medieval world, but merely to realise the modern world. It is not so much that they suppose the medieval world was above the average as that they feel sure the modern world is below the average. They do not start either with the idea that man is meant to live in a New <b>Jerusalem</b> of <b>pearl</b> and sapphire in the future, or that a man was meant to live in a picturesque and richly-painted tavern of the past; but with a strong inward and personal persuasion that a man was not meant to live in a man-trap.|$|R
