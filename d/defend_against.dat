5|$|Between the two World Wars, Nevada {{served in}} both the Atlantic and Pacific Fleets. Though she had {{originally}} been equipped with 21 five-inch (127mm)/51 cal guns to <b>defend</b> <b>against</b> enemy destroyers, this number was reduced to 12 in 1918, due to the overly wet bow and stern positions of the other nine.|$|E
5|$|During their occupation, the French began {{construction}} {{of a series of}} fortifications on Richmond Hill. Designed to <b>defend</b> <b>against</b> an attack like theirs, its cannons pointed to the landward rather than seaward side. These defences were completed by the British after 1783.|$|E

5|$|Gilberto is good {{at helping}} to <b>defend</b> <b>against</b> opponents who play a long ball game because he often man marks the opposition's attacking target-man. This cuts off the opposition's supply to the strikers, and thus forces the long-ball team to play through the midfield, {{something}} to which long-ball teams are not particularly suited.|$|E
5|$|The O class' design {{reflected}} {{their intended}} role; a heavy main armament (six 380mm guns in three dual turrets) for possible encounters with escorting -armed heavy cruisers, enough armor to <b>defend</b> <b>against</b> {{the same and}} nothing more, and a high top speed {{so that they could}} get away from slower but much better armored capital ships.|$|E
5|$|For {{the next}} year, the sisters trained before moving south to <b>defend</b> <b>against</b> any American attempt to retake the Mariana Islands or the Philippines. Shōkaku was sunk by an American {{submarine}} during the Battle of the Philippine Sea in June 1944 as the Americans invaded the Marianas and Zuikaku was sacrificed as a decoy {{four months later}} during the Battle of Cape Engano.|$|E

5|$|Generally for {{usage of}} 12-6 elbows, {{the fight is}} stopped and fighters are given a warning. However, there have been {{occasions}} where points have been deducted or the fighter using that strike in competition has been disqualified due to the move incapacitating fighters. In 2009, Matt Hamill defeated Jon Jones by disqualification due to Jones using 12-6 elbows. Hamill {{said that he was}} unable to <b>defend</b> <b>against</b> the elbows.|$|E
5|$|Greece's mountainous terrain {{favored a}} {{defensive}} strategy {{and the high}} ranges of the Rhodope, Epirus, Pindus and Olympus mountains offered many defensive opportunities. However, air power was required to protect defending ground forces from entrapment in the many defiles. Although an invading force from Albania could be stopped by {{a relatively small number}} of troops positioned in the high Pindus mountains, the northeastern part of the country was difficult to <b>defend</b> <b>against</b> an attack from the north.|$|E
5|$|Iron Duke was {{the first}} British {{battleship}} to be mounted with anti-aircraft weaponry. In 1914, two 3in (7.62cm) QF guns were fitted to the aft superstructure, primarily to <b>defend</b> <b>against</b> German airships. The guns fired between 1214 rounds per minute, and were expected to fire approximately 1,250 shells before replacement or repair was necessary. The shells fired were 12.5lb (5.67kg) with a high-explosive warhead. They were manually operated, and had a maximum effective ceiling of 23,500ft (7,160m).|$|E

5|$|Plant {{defense against}} {{herbivory}} or host-plant resistance (HPR) describes {{a range of}} adaptations evolved by plants which improve their survival and reproduction by reducing the impact of herbivores. Plants can sense being touched, and they can use several strategies to <b>defend</b> <b>against</b> damage caused by herbivores. Many plants produce secondary metabolites, known as allelochemicals, that influence the behavior, growth, or survival of herbivores. These chemical defenses can act as repellents or toxins to herbivores, or reduce plant digestibility.|$|E
5|$|The {{attack of}} Alexios's {{division}} initially caught Bryennios's men off guard, but, being veteran troops, they soon recovered {{and once again}} began to push it back. Retreating, Alexios's troops, and especially the Turks, employed skirmishing tactics, attacking the enemy line and then withdrawing swiftly, thus keeping their opponents at bay and weakening the coherence of their line. Some among Alexios's men chose to attack Bryennios, and the rebel general had to <b>defend</b> <b>against</b> several attacks himself.|$|E
5|$|The first {{fighting}} between US troops and Yavapai came in early 1837, when the Tolkepaya joined with their Quechan neighbors to <b>defend</b> <b>against</b> Major Samuel Heintzelman over a Quechan ferry crossing on the Colorado River. The Quechan used the ferry to transport settlers over the river, into California. After they killed a {{group led by}} John Glanton, who {{had taken over the}} crossing, the US government retaliated by burning the fields of the Quechans, and taking control of the crossing.|$|E

5|$|To <b>defend</b> <b>against</b> being boarded, Mary Rose carried large {{stocks of}} melee weapons, {{including}} pikes and bills; 150 of each kind were stocked {{on the ship}} according to the Anthony Roll, a figure confirmed roughly by the excavations. Swords and daggers were personal possessions and not listed in the inventories, but the remains of both {{have been found in}} great quantities, including the earliest dated example of a British basket-hilted sword.|$|E
5|$|Warfare was not {{uncommon}} in the Yavapai world, and they made changing alliances for security. Wi:pukba (Wipukepa) and Guwevkabaya (Kwevkepaya) bands formed alliances with Western Apache bands, to attack and <b>defend</b> <b>against</b> raids by the Pima and Maricopa bands from the south. Because of the greater strength of the Pima/Maricopa, Yavapai/Apache raids generally conducted small-scale quick raids, followed by a retreat to avoid counter-attack. The Yavapai defended their lands against Pima incursions, when the Pima would invade to harvest saguaro fruits.|$|E
5|$|A {{key to this}} matchup was for Ball State {{to force}} Arkansas State quarterback Adam Kennedy to be one-dimensional, {{limiting}} his ability to run the football, and thus forcing him to pass, attacking the Cardinals' defensive strong point, their secondary. For Arkansas State, establishing a rushing attack early and utilizing it often was paramount, as Ball State did not <b>defend</b> <b>against</b> the run particularly well during the regular season, however at the same time, Arkansas State needed to limit turnovers as they had all season (13 lost all season – seventh nationally); creating them was a strength for Ball State (30 created all season (including 10 in previous 4 games) – seventh nationally).|$|E

5|$|After {{arriving}} in the Middle East, the 2/2nd Machine Gun Battalion conducted more training in Palestine until April 1941 when it was transported to Mersa Matruh, where the battalion began a year-long period serving in the garrison role. Towards {{the end of this}} period– January 1942– the battalion was reassigned to the 9th Division and moved to Syria where it undertook further garrison duty as part of the Allied occupation force that had been established after the Syria–Lebanon campaign to <b>defend</b> <b>against</b> a possible German attack across the Caucasus Mountains. This came to an end in late June 1942 when the 9th was rushed to El Alamein to help establish a hasty defence line.|$|E
5|$|Although his {{southern}} foes {{were still}} very alive, Cao Cao focused {{to the north}} to crush Ma Chao and his rebels at Tong Gate in 211 AD ("Tales"). He also chooses to <b>defend</b> <b>against</b> Lu Bu, who is terrorizing Xiapi, and in a fireattack, he ends Lu Bu's Offensive ("Tales"). Cao Cao's generals then destroy {{the army of the}} alive Dong Zhuo piecemeal at Ji Province ("Tales"), and he eradicates all of his foes. Cao Cao then chooses to go after Shu or Wu, depending on the result of the Chibi fire attack.|$|E
5|$|At 02:00 on 13 June the 13th/18th Royal Hussars {{squadron}} {{arrived at}} 'C' Company's {{position at the}} crossroads, later followed by fifty-one men from the 22nd Independent Parachute Company. Bréville was now in British control again {{for the third time}} since the landings on 6 June. But not in the numbers to <b>defend</b> <b>against</b> a German counter-attack, so the 1st Battalion Royal Ulster Rifles, part of the 6th Airlanding Brigade, was moved into the village to take over from the survivors of the attack.|$|E
