40|$|<b>Egg</b> <b>yolk</b> {{immunoglobulins}} (IgY) {{are considered}} as a promising tool of establishing passive immunity against enteric pathogens (e. g. Salmonella) in poultry (Kovacs-Nolan and Mine, 2005). In our previous works, in-feed incorporation of freeze-dried yolk powder (FYP) improved performances of Salmonella-infected broilers (Marcq et al., 2009). Nevertheless, no extra value {{could be attributed to}} the presence of specific IgY when a comparison was done between impact of hyperimmune or non immune FYP both concerning growth performances and Salmonella infection. We hypothesized that these inconclusive in vivo results were related to the sensitivity of IgY to gastrointestinal conditions. <b>Egg</b> <b>yolks</b> with high IgY titers directed against Salmonella Enteritidis and Typhimurium were obtained from laying hens immunized as previously described (Chalghoumi et al., 2008). Three feed additives derived from these eggs were produced: FYP, spray-dried yolk powder (SYP), and freeze-dried water-soluble fraction of yolk powder (WSFP). A force-feeding assay was realized on these additives with 48 five-week-old males Ross broiler chicken (Salmonella spp. -free status). Survival of undigested IgY and bioactive Fab fragments was evaluated in the intestinal tract by ELISA. Statistical analyses were done using GLM procedure of Minitab 15. 1. Software. Differences were considered significant when P 0. 05) and for WSFP, which correspond to semi-purified IgY, the immunological activity reached the same level than that for SYP (P> 0. 05) whereas its initial level was almost ten times higher. The results suggest a protective effect of whole yolk on IgY with SYP but such effect was not observed with FYP. High levels of Fab fragments were identified in intestinal contents, highlighting the importance of protein digestion in the digestive tract and especially pepsin digestion. These Fab fragments conserve their immunological functionality and remained detectable in all intestinal segments including the caecum which represents the major site of Salmonella infection in poultry. These results can explain our previous challenge data and reveal that a protection treatment should be applied to <b>dried</b> <b>egg</b> <b>yolk</b> to improve the resistance of IgY to gastrointestinal conditions in broilers.

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{the present}} {{investigation}} {{was to determine the}} level of the active form of the endogenous protein Antisecretory Factor (actAF), and also the active form of AF immunoreactive molecules in the affinity purified <b>egg</b> <b>yolk.</b> Design: Determination of AF in affinity purified <b>egg</b> <b>yolk</b> by means of in vivo and in vitro methods. Setting: Sahlgrenska University Hospital and Chalmers University of Technology, both units located in Gothenburg, Sweden. The farm housing the egg-laying hens is situated some 10 miles west to Stockholm. Samples: <b>Egg</b> <b>yolk</b> collected weekly from hens subjected to AF-stimulating feed for up to 18 weeks. Methods and main outcome measures: The methods used were: a/ The in vivo rat ligated jejunal loop assay. b/ Two variations of ELISA, i. e. 1. An indirect ELISA using a polyclonal antibody against AF- 16 antibodies. 2. A competitive enzyme immunoassay for detection of the peptide AF- 16 and also related immunoreactive molecules. c/ Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization Mass Spectrometry, (MALDI-MS). The numeric variables registered represents: a/ The rat jejunal ligated loop assay demonstrates the influence of AF on the in vivo secretory response (mg/cm) to cholera toxin challenge. The ligated loop is some 12 – 15  cm long and placed on the mid part of jejunum, and the cholera toxin induced secretion is registered after a 5  h long challenge period. b/ The indirect ELISA method demonstrates the relative concentration of immunogenic AF peptides/AF- 16 peptides and also related immunoreactive compounds by means of absorbance values, while the values of the competitive immunoassay represent the concentration of AF- 16 peptides including similar immunoreactive peptides in ng/ml. c/ The MALDI-MS method provide information about the concentration of the AF- 16 peptide down to nanogram per ml. levels after mass spectrometry analysis of the sample. Results: All methods revealed similar results by demonstrating a continuous increase over time in the collected <b>egg</b> <b>yolk</b> samples. Thus, low AF activity was registered in <b>egg</b> <b>yolk</b> collected in the period of 1 – 10 weeks of AF-stimulated feeding, significantly higher AF values was registered in yolk collected between 10 and 15 weeks of feeding, while maximal AF concentration was determined after 15 weeks of feeding. Thus, in the period between 15 and 18 weeks of stimulated AF-feeding, no further increase of the endogenous AF activity could be registered despite continuous AF-stimulated feeding. Conclusion: During the period of AF-stimulated feeding of the egg laying hens the registration of AF concentration in the affinity purified <b>egg</b> <b>yolk</b> samples must be continuously registered over time. The various methods used for determination of AF concentration in the affinity purified <b>egg</b> <b>yolk</b> might all serve as tools in order to achieve the optimal concentration of active AF.

40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. March 2016. Major: Food Science. Advisor: Ted Labuza. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); x, 165 pages. Dehydration {{is a good}} process approach for food preservation. However, dried food products may still suffer from deterioration if store in an abused environment such as high humidity (water activity (aw) > 0. 6) and/or high temperature (> 45 °C). These storage conditions can induce undesirable chemical reactions (disulfide bond interactions, Maillard reaction and/or lipid oxidation), resulting in {{a significant decrease in}} food quality. In this study, the storage stability of a commercial spray-dried <b>egg</b> <b>yolk</b> powder was evaluated. The <b>dried</b> <b>egg</b> <b>yolk</b> powder (DEY) was stored at three temperatures (room temperature, 35 °C, and 45 °C) and at six aw (0. 05, 0. 12, 0. 37, 0. 44, 0. 54, 0. 66) for at least two months, and several physicochemical changes and extent of protein aggregation were measured. The overall color change of DEY was that it became slightly darker (decrease of L* value), more red (increase of a* value), and less yellow (decrease of b* value) with increased storage time. The reaction kinetics of the L* value of DEY was also calculated using a first-order hyperbolic model. Its Q 10 (rate increase with temperature increase at 10 °C) was 2. 9, which was more indicative of lipid oxidation, and the Ea (activation energy) was around 83 kJ/mole. The color change was mostly due to the browning pigments that were produced from the Maillard reaction and lipid oxidation. The glucose content went to zero after one-week during storage at 45 °C at an aw of 0. 66, confirming the occurrence of the Maillard reaction. The peroxide value of DEY storage at 45 °C at aw of 0. 66 was significantly increased compared to the control (vacuum packaged at - 20 °C), proving the occurrence of lipid oxidation. In addition, the Maillard reaction products and lipid oxidation products were both detected using the front face fluorescence spectrometer. After storage at an aw of 0. 66 at 45 °C for 8 weeks, protein solubility of DEY in TBS-SDS buffer [Tris-buffered saline (TBS: 20 mM Tris and 500 mM sodium chloride, pH 7. 5) containing 1 % sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS, g/ml) ] decreased to ~ 78 % compared with that of the original DEY. Formations of buffer-soluble and –insoluble protein aggregates were discovered using SDS-PAGE. The protein aggregates were mainly formed through unfolded intermediates and unfolded states as well as direct chemical linkages. The proteins in DEY were all denatured after storage at an aw of 0. 66 at 45 °C for 8 weeks, resulting in numerous unfolded intermediates and states that could interact with each other to form aggregates. The spray drying process during the manufacturing of DEY also caused denaturation of protein, which explained the detection of buffer-insoluble protein aggregates in the original sample. Increases of disulfide bond links and protein-lipid interaction during storage were also found using techniques such as Raman spectrometry, fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and front-face fluorescence spectrometry, indicating that some of the protein aggregates were induced by chemical reactions. The high molecular weight protein aggregates (HMWPAs) were further evaluated. Results showed that 32 proteins were involved with formation of buffer-soluble and -insoluble HMWPAs. They were products of natural <b>egg</b> <b>yolk</b> proteins and <b>egg</b> white proteins including serum albumin, vitellogenin, apovitellenin, as well as ovotansferrin, ovalbumin, lysozyme, ovomucoid, and ovastatin. Most of them contain disulfide bonds and some of them contain ligand and fatty acid binding sites, which corresponded with the theory of the direct chemical linkages induced protein aggregates. Overall, physicochemical changes and protein aggregates were found during the storage of DEY and it is mostly due to three undesirable chemical reactions, i. e., disulfide bond interactions, the Maillard reaction and/or lipid oxidation. Therefore, most effective approaches to reduce and/or inhibit the occurrence of those reactions include adjusting storage temperature and humidity as well as vacuum packaging after drying...|$|R

40|$|The ascidian Ciona intestinalis {{is a model}} {{organism}} {{of developmental}} and evolutionary biology and may provide crucial clues concerning two fundamental matters, namely, how chordates originated from the putative deuterostome ancestor and how advanced chordates originated from the simplest chordates. In this paper, a whole-life-span culture of C. intestinalis was conducted. Fed with the diet combination of <b>dry</b> Spirulina, <b>egg</b> <b>yolk,</b> Dicrateria sp., edible yeast and weaning diet for shrimp, C. intestinalis grew up to average 59 mm and matured after 60 d cultivation. This culture process could be repeated using the artificially cultured mature ascidians as material. When the fertilized eggs were maintained under 10, 15, 20, 25 °C, they hatched within 30 h, 22 h, 16 h and 12 h 50 min respectively experiencing cleavage, blastulation, gastrulation, neurulation, tailbud stage and tadpole stage. The tadpole larvae were characterized as typical but simplified chordates because of their dorsal nerve cord, notochord and primordial brain. After 8 ~ 24 h freely swimming, the tadpole larvae settled on the substrates and metamorphosized within 1 ~ 2 d into filter feeding sessile juvenile ascidians. In addition, unfertilized eggs were successfully dechorionated in filtered seawater containing 1 % Tripsin, 0. 25 % EDTA at pH of 10. 5 within 40 min. After fertilization, the dechorionated eggs developed well and hatched at normal hatching rate. In conclusion, this paper presented feasible methodology for rearing the tadpole larvae of C. intestinalis into sexual maturity under controlled conditions and detailed observations on the embryogenesis of the laboratory cultured ascidians, which will facilitate developmental and genetic research using this model system...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the effect of {{biopolymer}} encapsulation on the digestion of total lipids and cholesterol in <b>egg</b> <b>yolk</b> using an in vitro human digestion model. <b>Egg</b> <b>yolks</b> were encapsulated with 1 % cellulose, pectin, or chitosan. The samples were then passed through an in vitro human digestion model that simulated the composition of mouth saliva, stomach acid, and the intestinal juice of the small intestine by using a dialysis tubing system. The change in digestion of total lipids was monitored by confocal fluorescence microscopy. The digestion rate of total lipids and cholesterol in all <b>egg</b> <b>yolk</b> samples dramatically increased after in vitro human digestion. The digestion rate of total lipids and cholesterol in <b>egg</b> <b>yolks</b> encapsulated with chitosan or pectin was reduced compared to the digestion rate of total lipids and cholesterol in other <b>egg</b> <b>yolk</b> samples. <b>Egg</b> <b>yolks</b> encapsulated with pectin or chitosan had lower free fatty acid content, and lipid oxidation values than samples without biopolymer encapsulation.

40|$|Abstract. <b>Egg</b> <b>yolk</b> {{consisted}} of lecithin and phospholipids {{are one of}} the most commonly used components that will protect spermatozoa against cold shock during cooling and freezing. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of different hen <b>egg</b> <b>yolk</b> on Tris extender on the freezability of local ram semen. Semen from six sexually matured local rams was collected weekly using artificial vagina. Collected semen was evaluated macroscopically and microscopically and extended using tris extender {{consisted of}} 20 % (v/v) regular <b>egg</b> <b>yolk</b> (TRCEY), native <b>egg</b> <b>yolk</b> (TNCEY), omega- 3 hen <b>egg</b> <b>yolk</b> (TOEY) and 6 % (v/v) glycerol. Those were packed in 0. 25 ml straws, equilibrated at 5 oC for 3 hours, frozen and stored in nitrogen tank for 24 hours, and thawed at 37 oC for 30 second. The result of the experiment showed that there were no significant differences on the sperm motility and the number of living sperm. Percentage of plasma membrane intact in TOEY (60. 3 %) was significantly higher compared to TREY (56. 9 %) and TNEY (55. 6 %). In conclusion, the addition of omega 3 <b>egg</b> <b>yolk</b> in Tris extender protects plasma membrane better than the regular or native hen <b>egg</b> <b>yolk.</b> Key Words: ram semen, <b>egg</b> <b>yolk,</b> frozen seme...|$|R
40|$|The world horse {{industry}} exerts {{an important}} role as a job and income generation source. Reproductive technologies arises as an important tool {{in the service of}} world equine growth. Artificial insemination (AI) is perhaps the biotechnology with greater impact on equine breeding; a stallion can leave hundreds of offsprings over his reproductive life if AI is efficiently used. In some countries, <b>egg</b> <b>yolk</b> is frequently used as part of equine seminal extenders. The <b>egg</b> <b>yolk</b> provides the spermatozoa “resistance factors’’ when it is added. The protective fraction of the <b>egg</b> <b>yolk</b> probably is the low density lipoproteins (LDL). Several studies have reported successful results with the addition and replacement of <b>egg</b> <b>yolk</b> by LDL. There are many citations about the use of <b>egg</b> <b>yolk</b> in seminal extenders for stallion’s cooled and frozen semen, and in the equine reproduction practice. The <b>egg</b> <b>yolk</b> dilutors are used with good fertility results. New research is needed for the better understanding of the protective effects of <b>egg</b> <b>yolk</b> and the LDL for stallion semen. The LDL would be a great solution for dilutors to artificial insemination in horse.

40|$|Aim: The aim was {{to study}} the {{seroconversion}} and development of <b>egg</b> <b>yolk</b> immunoglobulins in adult laying White Leghorn hens immunized against an isolate of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) bearing K 91 and K 88 ac antigens, obtained from diarrheic piglet. Materials and Methods: Adult laying White Leghorn hens were immunized with inactivated enterotoxic E. coli strain isolated originally from a case of piglet diarrhea following recommended schedule. The development of whole antibodies and isotype-specific antibodies in serum and <b>egg</b> <b>yolk</b> were measured using {{indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay}} (ELISA). Piglets suffering from diarrhea with fecal samples positive for ETEC were fed with <b>egg</b> <b>yolk</b> and compared with diarrheic control group. Results: The serum and <b>egg</b> <b>yolk</b> ELISA antibody titer against E. coli strain {{used in the present study}} was as high as 2666. 66 ± 307. 92 and 933. 33 ± 203. 67 respectively on 50 day-post-vaccination (DPV). The immunoglobulin Y (IgY) was the predominant isotype in serum and <b>egg</b> <b>yolk,</b> which reached the peak titer of 2200 ± 519. 61 in serum on 40 DPV and 800 ± 244. 94 in <b>egg</b> <b>yolk</b> on 50 DPV. IgM titer in serum and <b>egg</b> <b>yolk</b> was found to be meager, and no IgA could be detected. Diarrheic piglets fed with the <b>egg</b> <b>yolk</b> suspension from immunized hens showed a promising result in controlling diarrhea. Conclusion: <b>Egg</b> <b>yolk</b> antibodies are considered a suitable immunotherapeutic alternative to conventional antibiotic therapy. High titer of <b>egg</b> <b>yolk</b> antibodies raised in the immunized hen against an isolate of ETEC holds the potential to be used for passive protection of diarrheic piglets during their most susceptible period of infection...|$|R
