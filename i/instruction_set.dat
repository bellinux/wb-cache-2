5|$|During development, Intel, HP, and {{industry}} analysts predicted that IA-64 would dominate in servers, workstations, and high-end desktops, and eventually supplant RISC and complex <b>instruction</b> <b>set</b> computing (CISC) architectures for all general-purpose applications.|$|E
5|$|Web is only {{released}} as source code or with Linux distributions and BSDs making binary packages. Thus {{the availability of}} Web depends on the distributor. Web can be run on many hardware platforms, including i386, amd64 and several other <b>instruction</b> <b>set</b> architectures.|$|E
5|$|As {{support for}} {{multiple}} <b>instruction</b> <b>set</b> architectures complicates symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) support, DragonFly BSD now limits its {{support to the}} x86-64 platform. DragonFly originally ran on the x86 architecture, however as of version 4.0 {{it is no longer}} supported. Since version 1.10, DragonFly supports 1:1 userland threading (one kernel thread per userland thread), which is regarded as a relatively simple solution that is also easy to maintain. Inherited from FreeBSD, DragonFly also supports multi-threading.|$|E
50|$|Complex {{instructions}} {{are more common}} in CISC <b>instruction</b> <b>sets</b> than in RISC <b>instruction</b> <b>sets,</b> but RISC <b>instruction</b> <b>sets</b> may include them as well. RISC <b>instruction</b> <b>sets</b> generally do not include ALU operations with memory operands, or instructions to move large blocks of memory, but most RISC <b>instruction</b> <b>sets</b> include SIMD or vector instructions that perform the same arithmetic operation on multiple pieces of data at the same time. SIMD instructions have the ability of manipulating large vectors and matrices in minimal time. SIMD instructions allow easy parallelization of algorithms commonly involved in sound, image, and video processing. Various SIMD implementations {{have been brought to}} market under trade names such as MMX, 3DNow!, and AltiVec.|$|R
50|$|The Bulldozer cores support {{most of the}} <b>instruction</b> <b>sets</b> {{implemented}} by Intel processors available at its introduction (including SSE4.1, SSE4.2, AES, CLMUL, and AVX) {{as well as new}} <b>instruction</b> <b>sets</b> proposed by AMD; ABM, XOP, FMA4 and F16C.|$|R
50|$|Binaries {{incorporate}} additional <b>instruction</b> <b>sets.</b>|$|R
5|$|FreeBSD {{has been}} ported {{to a variety}} of <b>instruction</b> <b>set</b> {{architectures}}. The FreeBSD project organizes architectures into tiers that characterize the level of support provided. Tier 1 architectures are mature and fully supported. Tier 2 architectures are undergoing major development. Tier 3 architectures are experimental or are no longer under active development and Tier 4 architectures have no support at all.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, AMD {{released}} the Opteron CPU, which implements its own 64-bit architecture called AMD64. Opteron gained rapid acceptance in the enterprise server space because it provided an easy upgrade from x86. Under influence by Microsoft, Intel responded by implementing AMD's x86-64 <b>instruction</b> <b>set</b> architecture instead of IA-64 in its Xeon microprocessors in 2004, {{resulting in a}} new industry-wide de facto standard.|$|E
5|$|In early 2011, Qualcomm {{announced}} a new processor architecture called Krait, which used the ARM v7 <b>instruction</b> <b>set,</b> but was based on Qualcomm's own processor design. The processors were called S4 and had a feature named Asynchronous Symmetrical Multi-Processing (aSMP), meaning each processor core adjusted its clock speed and voltage based on the device's activity in order to optimize battery usage. Prior models were renamed to S1, S2 and S3 to distinguish each generation.|$|E

40|$|Vector <b>instruction</b> <b>sets</b> are {{receiving}} renewed interest {{because of their}} applicability to multimedia. Current multimedia <b>instruction</b> <b>sets</b> use short vectors with SIMD implementations, but long vector, pipelined implementations {{have a number of}} advantages and are a logical next step in multimedia ISA development...|$|R
40|$|In program algebra, {{different}} <b>instruction</b> <b>sets</b> for Boolean registers are conceivable. In {{previous work}} on instruction sequence size complexity, we chose <b>instruction</b> <b>sets</b> for Boolean registers that contain {{only a few}} of the possible instructions. In the current paper, we study instruction sequence size bounded functional completeness of <b>instruction</b> <b>sets</b> for Boolean registers. This work is among other things a requisite for making progress with proving lower bounds of non-asymptotic instruction sequence size complexity in cases where auxiliary Boolean registers may be used...|$|R
5|$|The machine's <b>instruction</b> <b>set</b> was {{increased}} from the 7 of the SSEM to 26 initially, including multiplication done in hardware. This increased to 30instructions in the Final Specification version. Ten bits of each word were allocated {{to hold the}} instruction code. The standard instruction time was 1.8 milliseconds, but multiplication was much slower, {{depending on the size}} of the operand.|$|E
5|$|In 1989, HP {{determined}} that Reduced <b>Instruction</b> <b>Set</b> Computing (RISC) architectures were approaching a processing limit at one instruction per cycle. HP researchers investigated a new architecture, later named Explicitly Parallel Instruction Computing (EPIC), {{that allows the}} processor to execute multiple instructions in each clock cycle. EPIC implements a form of very long instruction word (VLIW) architecture, in which a single instruction word contains multiple instructions. With EPIC, the compiler determines in advance which instructions can be executed at the same time, so the microprocessor simply executes the instructions and does not need elaborate mechanisms to determine which instructions to execute in parallel.|$|E
5|$|Snapdragon is a {{suite of}} {{system on a chip}} (SoC) {{semiconductor}} products designed and marketed by Qualcomm for mobile devices. The Snapdragon central processing unit (CPU) uses the ARM RISC <b>instruction</b> <b>set,</b> and a single SoC may include multiple CPU cores, a graphics processing unit (GPU), a wireless modem, and other software and hardware to support a smartphone's global positioning system (GPS), camera, gesture recognition and video. Snapdragon semiconductors are embedded in devices of various systems, including Android and Windows Phone devices. They are also used for netbooks, in cars, wearable devices and other devices.|$|E

5|$|He {{began in}} 1962 by writing a Fortran {{compiler}} for the PDP-4, before {{contributing to the}} development of the PDP-5 <b>instruction</b> <b>set.</b> Under Harlan Anderson (vice president of engineering), principal architect Gordon Bell led a team, including Kotok as an assistant logic designer, which developed the first commercial time-sharing computer, the PDP-6, designed and delivered in 1963–1964. Aiming at a scientific market, Digital machines had a 36-bit word length to accommodate artificial intelligence work in Lisp and to compete with IBM mainframe computers. In 1965, in what may have been the first around-the-world networking connection, a PDP-6 at the University of Western Australia in Perth was operated from Boston in the United States via a telex link.|$|E
25|$|Thumb-2 {{technology}} {{was introduced in}} the ARM1156core, announced in 2003. Thumb-2 extends the limited 16-bit <b>instruction</b> <b>set</b> of Thumb with additional 32-bit instructions to give the <b>instruction</b> <b>set</b> more breadth, thus producing a variable-length <b>instruction</b> <b>set.</b> A stated aim for Thumb-2 was to achieve code density similar to Thumb with performance similar to the ARM <b>instruction</b> <b>set</b> on 32-bit memory.|$|E

25|$|In {{particular}} hardware abstraction {{does not}} involve abstracting the <b>instruction</b> <b>set,</b> which generally falls under the wider concept of portability. Abstracting the <b>instruction</b> <b>set,</b> when necessary (such as for handling the several revisions to the x86 <b>instruction</b> <b>set,</b> or emulating a missing math coprocessor), is performed by the kernel, or via hardware virtualization.|$|E
25|$|Alpha, {{originally}} {{known as}} Alpha AXP, is a 64-bit reduced <b>instruction</b> <b>set</b> computing (RISC) <b>instruction</b> <b>set</b> architecture (ISA) developed by Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC), designed to replace their 32-bit VAX complex <b>instruction</b> <b>set</b> computer (CISC) ISA. Alpha was implemented in microprocessors originally developed and fabricated by DEC. These microprocessors were most prominently {{used in a}} variety of DEC workstations and servers, which eventually formed the basis for almost all of their mid-to-upper-scale lineup. Several third-party vendors also produced Alpha systems, including PC form factor motherboards.|$|E

25|$|Motion Video Instructions (MVI) was an <b>instruction</b> <b>set</b> {{extension}} to the Alpha ISA that added instructions for single instruction, multiple data (SIMD) operations. Alpha implementations that implement MVI, in chronological order, are the Alpha 21164PC (PCA56 and PCA57), Alpha 21264 (EV6) and Alpha 21364 (EV7). Unlike most other SIMD instruction sets {{of the same}} period, such as MIPS' MDMX or SPARC's Visual <b>Instruction</b> <b>Set,</b> but like PA-RISC's Multimedia Acceleration eXtensions, MVI was a simple <b>instruction</b> <b>set</b> composed of a few instructions that operate on integer data types stored in existing integer registers.|$|E
25|$|The later Pentium MMX {{also added}} the MMX <b>instruction</b> <b>set,</b> a basic integer SIMD <b>instruction</b> <b>set</b> {{extension}} marketed {{for use in}} multimedia applications. MMX {{could not be used}} simultaneously with the x87 FPU instructions because the registers were reused (to allow for fast context switches). More important enhancements were the doubling of the instruction and data cache sizes and a few microarchitectural changes for better performance.|$|E
