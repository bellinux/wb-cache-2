On 30 September, observers, including Finlay and E. E.

Observers reported that the relative brightness of the fragments varied <b>from</b> <b>day</b> <b>to</b> day.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{proclamation}} of independence, neither the Belgian nor the Congolese government intended the colonial social order to end immediately. The Belgian government hoped that whites might keep their position indefinitely. The Republic of the Congo was still reliant on colonial {{institutions like the}} Force Publique to function <b>from</b> <b>day</b> <b>to</b> day, and white technical experts, installed by the Belgians, were retained in the broad absence of suitably qualified black Congolese replacements (partly the result of colonial restrictions regarding higher education). Many Congolese people had assumed that independence would produce tangible and immediate social change, so the retention of whites in positions of importance was widely resented.|$|E

5|$|Based upon data {{taken from}} the United States using these methods, cirrus cloud cover was found to vary diurnally and seasonally. The {{researchers}} found that in the summer, at noon, the cover is the lowest, {{with an average of}} 23% of the United States' land area covered by cirrus. Around midnight, the cloud cover increases to around 28%. In winter, the cirrus cloud cover did not vary appreciably <b>from</b> <b>day</b> <b>to</b> night. These percentages include clear days and nights, as well as days and nights with other cloud types, as lack of cirrus cloud cover. When these clouds are present, the typical coverage ranges from 30% to 50%. Based on satellite data, cirrus covers an average of 20% to 25% of the Earth's surface. In the tropical regions, this cloud covers around 70% of the region's surface area.|$|E
5|$|Central {{nervous system}} oxygen {{toxicity}} manifests as {{symptoms such as}} visual changes (especially tunnel vision), ringing in the ears (tinnitus), nausea, twitching (especially of the face), behavioural changes (irritability, anxiety, confusion), and dizziness. This may {{be followed by a}} tonic–clonic seizure consisting of two phases: intense muscle contraction occurs for several seconds (tonic phase); followed by rapid spasms of alternate muscle relaxation and contraction producing convulsive jerking (clonic phase). The seizure ends with a period of unconsciousness (the postictal state). The onset of seizure depends upon the partial pressure of oxygen in the breathing gas and exposure duration. However, exposure time before onset is unpredictable, as tests have shown a wide variation, both amongst individuals, and in the same individual <b>from</b> <b>day</b> <b>to</b> day. In addition, many external factors, such as underwater immersion, exposure to cold, and exercise will decrease the time to onset of central nervous system symptoms. Decrease of tolerance is closely linked to retention of carbon dioxide. Other factors, such as darkness and caffeine, increase tolerance in test animals, but these effects have not been proven in humans.|$|E

5|$|In {{the time}} that Gates was there, {{research}} focused mainly on honey production, brood diseases, wax extraction and horticultural pollination in the cucumber and cranberry industries. From 1913 to 1920 the laboratory was also operated by a superintendent, John L. Byard, hired on by Gates to maintain the facilities <b>from</b> <b>day</b> <b>to</b> day as well as perform wax extractions and other services to beekeepers from around the state. Following Gates' resignation in 1918, the school ceased to offer its summer beekeeping school, many of its state extension services, and the college went through several different professors before hiring Frank R. Shaw as the new professor of beekeeping in 1931. With Shaw's retirement in 1969, the laboratory was rededicated to urban and medical entomology research, with the former beekeeping program falling into relative obscurity.|$|E
5|$|Jupiter {{demonstrates}} bright, persistent aurorae around both poles. Unlike Earth's aurorae, {{which are}} transient and only occur {{at times of}} heightened solar activity, Jupiter's aurorae are permanent, though their intensity varies <b>from</b> <b>day</b> <b>to</b> day. They consist of three main components: the main ovals, which are bright, narrow (less than 1000km in width) circular features located at approximately 16° from the magnetic poles; the satellites' auroral spots, which correspond to the footprints of the magnetic field lines connecting Jupiter's ionosphere with those of its largest moons, and transient polar emissions situated within the main ovals. Whereas the auroral emissions were detected in almost {{all parts of the}} electromagnetic spectrum from radio waves to X-rays (up to 3keV), they are brightest in the mid-infrared (wavelength 3–4μm and 7–14μm) and deep ultraviolet spectral regions (wavelength 80–180nm).|$|E
40|$|Meishan gilts were ovariectomized 2 h {{after an}} i. v. {{injection}} of 5 '-bromo- 2 '-deoxyuridine (BrdU, a thymidine analogue; 5 mg/kg body weight) on Days 15 - 19 of the estrous cycle or 24 - 30 h after observed estrus (post LH, PLH). All antral follicles 3 mm from one ovary were fixed in Carnoy's solution. Granulosa and thecal cell labeling indexes (LI; percentage of nuclei staining for BrdU) {{as well as}} LI of cells within the basal, middle, and antral thirds of the granulosa cell layer were estimated for each follicle. In addition, antral and granulosa cell layer volume, granulosa cell layer thickness, granulosa cell density, number of granulosa cells, and number of S-phase cells per hour were estimated for each follicle. Mean follicular diameter increased linearly (p < 0. 01) <b>from</b> <b>Day</b> 15 <b>to</b> PLH, with a growth rate of 0. 77 mm/day. Granulosa and thecal cell LI decreased (p < 0. 01) <b>from</b> <b>Day</b> 15 <b>to</b> PLH; however, granulosa cell LI was greater (p < 0. 01) than thecal cell LI on Days 15 and 16 but less (p < 0. 05) than thecal cell LI on Day 19. Follicles collected from PLH gilts contained no labeled granulosa cells. Cells within the basal third of the granulosa cell layer contained fewer (p < 0. 01) labeled nuclei than did cells within the middle or antral thirds. In addition, LI within the basal and middle thirds of the granulosa cell layer decreased (p< 0. 01) <b>from</b> <b>Days</b> 15 <b>to</b> 18 and <b>from</b> <b>Days</b> 15 <b>to</b> 17, respectively, whereas LI within the antral third remained constant <b>from</b> <b>Days</b> 15 <b>to</b> 18.

5|$|The East Riding {{generally}} has cool summers and relatively mild winters. Weather conditions vary <b>from</b> <b>day</b> <b>to</b> day {{as well as}} from season to season. The latitude of the area means that it is influenced by predominantly westerly winds with depressions and their associated fronts, bringing with them unsettled and windy weather, particularly in winter. Between depressions there are often small mobile anticyclones that bring periods of fair weather. In winter, anticyclones bring cold dry weather. In summer the anticyclones tend to bring dry settled conditions which can lead to drought, particularly on the Wolds. For its latitude this area is mild in winter and cooler in summer due to the influence of the Gulf Stream in the northern Atlantic Ocean. Air temperature varies on a daily and seasonal basis. The temperature is usually lower at night, and January is the coldest time of the year. The two dominant influences on the climate of the area are the shelter against the worst of the moist westerly winds provided by the Pennines and the proximity of the North Sea.|$|E

Its latitude means that it is influenced by predominantly westerly winds with depressions and their associated fronts, bringing unsettled and windy weather particularly in winter. Between depressions there are often small mobile anticyclones that bring periods of fine weather. In winter anticyclones bring cold dry weather. In summer the anticyclones tend to bring dry settled conditions which can lead to drought. The two dominant influences on the climate of the Whitby area are shelter against the worst of the moist westerly winds provided by the North York Moors and the proximity of the North Sea. Late, chilly springs and warm summers are a feature of the area but there are often spells of fine autumn weather. Onshore winds in spring and early summer bring mists or low stratus clouds (known locally as sea frets) to the coast and moors.|$|E
