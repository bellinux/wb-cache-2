25|$|Software {{functional}} quality reflects {{how well}} it complies with or conforms to a given design, based on <b>functional</b> <b>requirements</b> or specifications. That attribute can also {{be described as the}} fitness for purpose of a piece of software or how it compares to competitors in the marketplace as a worthwhile product. It {{is the degree to which}} the correct software was produced.|$|E
25|$|Software {{functional}} {{quality is}} defined as conformance to explicitly stated <b>functional</b> <b>requirements,</b> identified for example using Voice of the Customer analysis (part of the Design for Six Sigma toolkit and/or documented through use cases) {{and the level of}} satisfaction experienced by end-users. The latter is referred as to as usability and is concerned with how intuitive and responsive the user interface is, how easily simple and complex operations can be performed, and how useful error messages are. Typically, software testing practices and tools ensure that a piece of software behaves in compliance with the original design, planned user experience and desired testability, i.e. a piece of software's disposition to support acceptance criteria.|$|E
25|$|The initial {{chip design}} process begins with {{system-level}} design and microarchitecture planning. Within IC design companies, management and often analytics will draft {{a proposal for}} a design team to start the design of a new chip to fit into an industry segment. Upper-level designers will meet at this stage to decide how the chip will operate functionally. This step is where an IC's functionality and design are decided. IC designers will map out the <b>functional</b> <b>requirements,</b> verification testbenches, and testing methodologies for the whole project, and will then turn the preliminary design into a system-level specification that can be simulated with simple models using languages like C++ and MATLAB and emulation tools. For pure and new designs, the system design stage is where an Instruction set and operation is planned out, and in most chips existing instruction sets are modified for newer functionality. Design at this stage is often statements such as encodes in the MP3 format or implements IEEE floating-point arithmetic. At later stages in the design process, each of these innocent looking statements expands to hundreds of pages of textual documentation.|$|E

Intended usage determines the desired seating position. [...] "Task chairs", or any chair intended for people to work at a desk or table, including dining chairs, can only recline very slightly; otherwise the occupant is too far away from the desk or table. Dental chairs are necessarily reclined. Easy chairs for watching television or movies are somewhere in between depending on the height of the screen.|$|E
2500|$|Ecology {{guided by}} {{cultural}} meanings of lifeworldly landscapes (frequently pursued in practice but not defined, but see, e.g., Hard; Trepl): [...] Landscape ecology {{is defined as}} ecology that is guided by an external aim, namely, to maintain and develop lifeworldly landscapes. It provides the ecological knowledge necessary to achieve these goals. It investigates how to sustain and develop those populations and ecosystems which (i) are the material 'vehicles' of lifeworldly, aesthetic and symbolic landscapes and, at the same time, (ii) meet societies' <b>functional</b> <b>requirements,</b> including provisioning, regulating, and supporting ecosystem services. Thus landscape ecology is concerned mainly with the populations and ecosystems which have resulted from traditional, regionally specific forms of land use.|$|E
2500|$|The vernacular {{architecture}} {{is not to}} be confused with so-called [...] "traditional" [...] architecture, though there are links between the two. Traditional architecture also includes buildings which bear elements of polite design: temples and palaces, for example, which normally would not be included under the rubric of [...] "vernacular." [...] In architectural terms, 'the vernacular' can be contrasted with 'the polite', which is characterised by stylistic elements of design intentionally incorporated by a professional architect for aesthetic purposes which go beyond a building's <b>functional</b> <b>requirements.</b> Between the extremes of the wholly vernacular and the completely polite, examples occur which have some vernacular and some polite content, often making the differences between the vernacular and the polite a matter of degree.|$|E

6000|$|The early {{singing of}} the oven-bird fledgling is important, {{owing to the}} fact that the group it belongs to {{comprises}} the least specialized forms in the family. They are strong-legged, square-tailed, terrestrial birds, generally able to perch, have probing beaks, and build the most perfect mud or stick nests, or burrow in the ground. In the numerous tree-creeping groups, which, seem as unrelated to the oven-bird as the woodpecker is to the hoopoe, we find a score of wonderfully different forms of beak; but many of them retain the probing character, and are actually used to probe in rotten wood on trees, and to explore the holes and deep crevices in the trunk. We have also seen that some of these tree-creepers revert to the ancestral habit (if I may so call it) of seeking their food by probing in the soil. In others, like Dendrornis, in which the beak has lost this character, and is used to dig in the wood or to strip off the bark, it has not been highly specialized, and, compared with the woodpecker's beak, is a very imperfect organ, considering the purpose for which it is used. Yet, on the principle that [...] "similar <b>functional</b> <b>requirements</b> frequently lead to the development of similar structures in animals which are otherwise very distinct"--as we see in the tubular tongue in honey-eaters and humming birds--we might have expected to find in the Dendrocolaptidae a better imitation of the woodpecker in so variable an organ as the beak, if not in the tongue.|$|E
50|$|As {{defined in}} {{requirements}} engineering, <b>functional</b> <b>requirements</b> specify particular {{results of a}} system. This should be contrasted with non-functional requirements which specify overall characteristics such as cost and reliability. <b>Functional</b> <b>requirements</b> drive the application architecture of a system, while non-functional requirements drive the technical architecture of a system. In some cases a requirements analyst generates use cases after gathering and validating a set of <b>functional</b> <b>requirements.</b> The hierarchy of <b>functional</b> <b>requirements</b> is: user/stakeholder request → feature → use case → business rule. Each use case illustrates behavioral scenarios through one or more <b>functional</b> <b>requirements.</b> Often, though, an analyst will begin by eliciting a set of use cases, from which the analyst can derive the <b>functional</b> <b>requirements</b> that must be implemented to allow a user to perform each use case.|$|E

40|$|That {{distinct}} enzyme {{activities in}} an unbranched metabolic pathway are evolutionarily tuned {{to a single}} <b>functional</b> <b>requirement</b> is a pervasive assumption. Here we test this assumption by examining the activities of two consecutively acting enzymes in human erythrocytes with an approach to quantitative evolutionary design that avoids the above-mentioned assumption. We previously found that avoidance of NADPH depletion during the pulses of oxidative load to which erythrocytes are normally exposed is the main <b>functional</b> <b>requirement</b> mediating selection for high glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase activity. In the present study, we find that, in contrast, the maintenance of oxidized glutathione at low concentrations is the main <b>functional</b> <b>requirement</b> mediating selection for high glutathione reductase activity. The results in this case show that, contrary to the assumption of a single <b>functional</b> <b>requirement,</b> natural selection for the normal activities of the distinct enzymes in the pathway is mediated by different requirements. On the other hand, the results agree with the more general principles that underlie our approach. Namely, that (i) the values of biochemical parameters evolve so as to fulfill the various performance requirements {{that are relevant to}} achieve high fitness, and (ii) these performance requirements can be inferred from quantitative systems theory considerations, informed by knowledge of specific aspects of the biochemistry, physiology, genetics, and ecology of the organism...|$|R
