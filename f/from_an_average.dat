Woody Hayes led Ohio State to two national titles, in 1954 and 1957, and dominated the Big Ten conference, winning three Big Ten titles—more than any other school. Wilkinson and Hayes, along with Robert Neyland of Tennessee, oversaw {{a revival of the}} running game in the 1950s. Passing numbers dropped <b>from</b> <b>an</b> <b>average</b> of 18.9 attempts in 1951 to 13.6 attempts in 1955, while teams averaged just shy of 50 running plays per game. Nine out of ten Heisman trophy winners in the 1950s were runners. Notre Dame, one of the biggest passing teams of the decade, saw a substantial decline in success; the 1950s were the only decade between 1920 and 1990 when the team did not win at least a share of the national title.

We show that the energetic disorder evaluated <b>from</b> <b>an</b> ensemble <b>average</b> contains contributions of both static origin (time-independent, due to loose packing) and dynamic origin (time-dependent, due to electron-vibration interactions). In order to differentiate between these two contributions, we compare the results obtained <b>from</b> <b>an</b> ensemble <b>average</b> approach with those derived <b>from</b> <b>a</b> time <b>average</b> approach. It is found that in both amorphous C 60 and C 70 bulk systems, the degrees of static and dynamic disorder are comparable, while in the amorphous PC 61 BM and PC 71 BM systems, static disorder is about twice as large as dynamic disorder. © 2015 American Chemical Society...|$|R
5|$|This region's land is {{appropriate}} for agricultural and livestock activities. It is mostly a flat area, interrupted only by the Tandilia and Ventana hills in its southern portion. The climate of the Pampas is temperate and humid with no dry season, featuring hot summers and mild winters (Cfa/Cfb according to the Köppen climate classification). The weather in the Pampas is variable due to the contrasting air masses and frontal storms that impact the region. Maritime polar air from the south produces the cool pampero winds, while warm humid tropical air from the north produces sultry nortes - a gentle wind usually from the northeast formed by trade winds, and the South Atlantic High that brings cloudy, hot, and humid weather and is responsible for bringing heat waves. The Pampas {{are influenced by the}} El Niño–Southern Oscillation which is responsible for variations in annual precipitation. An El Niño year often leads to higher precipitation, while a La Niña year leads to lower precipitation. The Pampas are moderately sunny, ranging <b>from</b> <b>an</b> <b>average</b> of 4–5 hours of sunshine per day during the winter months to 8–9 hours in summer.|$|E
