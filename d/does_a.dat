5|$|A {{high school}} in his native Târgovişte bears the name Ion Heliade Rădulescu, as <b>does</b> <b>a</b> village in the commune of Ziduri, Buzău County. The grave of Take Ionescu, an {{influential}} political figure and one-time Prime Minister of Romania who was Heliade's descendant, is situated in Sinaia Monastery, {{in the immediate vicinity}} of a fir tree planted by Heliade and his fellow 1848 revolutionaries.|$|E
5|$|By the 13th century, {{the church}} had a stone-built nave and chancel; the latter survives in the present building, as <b>does</b> <b>a</b> 12th-century font which was {{probably}} taken from the building in place at that time. A chancel arch was inserted between the nave and chancel in about 1300. The dedication to Saint Margaret is later: it was first recorded in 1489.|$|E

5|$|When {{the family}} comes downstairs and {{discover}} {{the tree and}} presents gone, Bart makes up {{a story about how}} he caught a burglary in progress and the suspect making off with the tree and all of the family's presents.

5|$|A {{continuous}} map between two topological spaces induces a group homomorphism between the associated homotopy groups. In particular, if the map is a continuous bijection (a homeomorphism), {{so that the}} two spaces have the same topology, then their i-th homotopy groups are isomorphic for all i. However, the real plane has exactly the same homotopy groups as a solitary point (as <b>does</b> <b>a</b> Euclidean space of any dimension), and the real plane with a point removed has the same groups as a circle, so groups alone are not enough to distinguish spaces. Although the loss of discrimination power is unfortunate, it can also make certain computations easier.|$|E

50|$|The New Zealand {{version of}} the {{television}} show Dancing with the Stars was parodied.

5|$|Andy and Angela play Mad Libs, a phrasal {{template}} word {{game where}} one player prompts another {{for a list}} of words to substitute for blanks in a story, usually with funny results. Ryan chides Jim for being a fan of the Philadelphia Eagles, a professional American football team. While Daryl is telling Michael how gang members deal with problems, he mentions that {{he was a member of}} the Newsies (the name of a 1992 musical drama) and The Warriors (the gang in the 1979 cult action film of the same name). Near the end of the episode, Michael <b>does</b> <b>a</b> succession of comedian impressions. These include badly performed spoofs of Rodney Dangerfield, Henny Youngman, Jeff Foxworthy, Sacha Baron Cohen as Borat, and Jerry Seinfeld.|$|E
5|$|At {{present the}} golden white-eye is very common, {{and in fact}} a 1996 study found that their densities on Saipan were among the highest {{recorded}} for any bird, up to 2,095 birds/km² (8.47 per acre). It was believed that Saipan cannot sustain a larger population of this white-eye than it already <b>does.</b> <b>A</b> 2009 study, which incorporated results from a 2007 survey, found that the species had declined between 1982 and 2007, in common with two other species on Saipan, the rufous fantail and the nightingale reed warbler. All three species are insectivorous and were theorised to have declined due to habitat loss. Nevertheless, the species remained relatively abundant, and the current world population is estimated at around 71,997 birds.|$|E
5|$|I went to Iraq {{because what}} I saw when I {{was over there}} was soldiers—young kids for the most part—helping people in Iraq; helping getting the power turned back on, helping get {{hospitals}} open, helping get the water turned back on and you don't hear any of that on the news. You hear, 'X number of people were killed today,' which I think <b>does</b> <b>a</b> huge disservice. It's like spitting on these {{young men and women}} who are over there fighting to help this country.|$|E

Grint will be starring alongside actors Brendan Coyle, Ben Whishaw and Daniel Mays. The play is based on real-life events and ran from 26 October 2013 until 8 February 2014 at the Harold Pinter Theatre in London. He won the WhatsOnStage Award for Best London Newcomer for his role in this play.|$|E

The family later takes refuge {{at the home of}} writer D. Oswald Heist (the author of Alana's favorite novel), where they first come into contact with Prince Robot IV.|$|E
5|$|Love's {{design process}} {{has become more}} refined as time goes on. For Digital, she did not plan {{anything}} in advance; while for Analogue, she worked out the entire design and pacing game in flowcharts before starting. For all of her games, however, she <b>does</b> <b>a</b> lot of research into the time periods and issues involved. Love does not feel that text is necessarily {{the best way to}} tell a story in a game, but finds it easier to communicate with it as a writer.|$|E

5|$|Male elk {{retain their}} antlers {{for more than}} half the year and are less likely to group with other males when they have antlers. Antlers provide a means of defense, as <b>does</b> <b>a</b> strong front-leg kick, which is {{performed}} by either sex if provoked. Once the antlers have been shed, bulls tend to form bachelor groups which allow them to work cooperatively at fending off predators. Herds tend to employ one or more scouts while the remaining members eat and rest.|$|E
5|$|Matsya Purana tells a {{different}} story of Chamunda's origins. She with other matrikas was created by Shiva to help him kill the demon Andhakasura, who has an ability - like Raktabija - to generate from his dripping blood. Chamunda with the other matrikas drinks {{the blood of the}} demon ultimately helping Shiva kill him. Ratnakara, in his text Haravijaya, also describes this feat of Chamunda, but solely credits Chamunda, not the other matrikas of sipping the blood of Andhaka. Having drunk the blood, Chamunda's complexion changed to blood-red. The text further says that Chamunda <b>does</b> <b>a</b> dance of destruction, playing a musical instrument whose shaft is Mount Meru, the spring is the cosmic snake Shesha and gourd is the crescent moon. She plays the instrument during the deluge that drowns the world.|$|E
5|$|Napoleon becomes {{friends with}} a new student, a Mexican {{immigrant}} named Pedro Sánchez (Efren Ramirez) who rarely conveys emotion or speaks. Pedro runs for class president after seeing a poster at the school dance. On the election day, he gives a mediocre speech {{in front of the}} student body. Napoleon <b>does</b> <b>a</b> dance routine as Pedro's skit for the election and receives a standing ovation, saving the campaign and winning Pedro the election. Following the campaign, Kip and Lafawnduh meet each other in real life and are wed. Jared Hess has stated that the series takes place before the marriage, but after Pedro's election, and several new characters are introduced.|$|E

It closed after 39 performances on March 29, 1969, but Pacino received rave reviews {{and won the}} Tony Award on April 20, 1969. Pacino continued performing onstage in the 1970s, winning a second Tony Award for The Basic Training of Pavlo Hummel and performing the title role in Richard III. In the 1980s, Pacino again achieved critical success on stage while appearing in David Mamet's American Buffalo, for which Pacino {{was nominated for a}} Drama Desk Award. Since 1990, Pacino's stage work has included revivals of Eugene O'Neill's Hughie, Oscar Wilde's Salome and in 2005 Lyle Kessler's Orphans.|$|E

5|$|The {{airfield}} is very {{isolated in}} northwest Utah, {{sitting in the}} middle of a vast wasteland miles away from any major population center. It is probably for this reason, and the dry hot climate, that much of the airfield remains today. Still-extant facilities include the vast runway system, numerous ramps, taxiways, dispersal pads, and most of the original hangars (including the Enola Gay B-29 hangar). Most of the hospital complex and many barracks remain, as <b>does</b> <b>a</b> chow hall, chapel, swimming pool and many other World War II-era buildings.|$|E
