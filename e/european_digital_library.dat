40|$|A key {{concept for}} large scale, {{persistent}} digital libraries. Interoperability {{is an essential}} feature for federated information architectures to work in heterogeneous settings and over time! However, use {{and understanding of the}} concept still are very heterogeneous: interoperability is conceived in an object-related or in a functional perspective, from a user's or an institutional perspective, in terms of multilingualism or of technical means and protocols. Moreover, interoperability is conceived on different abstraction levels: from the bitstream layer up to semantic interoperability. The briefing summarises some of the relevant vectors of thought, indicates related conceptual frameworks and places the issue in the strategic context of Europeana. Interoperability and the <b>European</b> <b>Digital</b> <b>Library</b> Agenda From the conception of the <b>European</b> <b>Digital</b> <b>Library</b> as part of the i 2010 agenda the issue of interoperability has been dominant as in the following statement made by Commissioner Reding in 2005 : “I am not suggesting that the Commission creates a single library. I envisage a network of many digital libraries – in different institutions, across Europe. ” As a consequence, interoperability was prominent on what then became the Europeana agenda in that- Europeana is federating objects from distributed sources,- Europeana is federating objects from heterogeneous sources with different community background,- Europeana is part of a bigger framework of interacting global information networks including e. g. other 'Digital libraries', scientific repositories and commercial providers,- Europeana relies as much as possible on standards and existing building blocks as well as be based on web standards,- and therefore ‘interoperability ’ is the technical heart of the <b>European</b> <b>Digital</b> <b>Library</b> vision! Aware of the central nature of the concept the EC had set up a Working Group on Digital Library Interoperability active from January to June 2007 and which conceived a number of strategic recommendations based on the concept matrix outlined hereafter...|$|E

An {{essay about}} {{mathematics}} being a sublanguage of other natural languages: how {{it may be}} represented, stored, searched and handled in several projects of (<b>European)</b> <b>Digital</b> Mathematics <b>Libraries</b> as DML-CZ or EuDML. A framework for solving problem of computing of similar papers in a <b>digital</b> <b>library</b> is proposed, allowing several types of similarity type definitions: plagiarity counting on common word n-grams, topicality counting on common topics, or conarrativity counting on the same narrative. The vector of the most similar documents for a given similarity type is suggested to be computed using the algorithm by Page for web page ranking, often explained as ‘random walking’.
