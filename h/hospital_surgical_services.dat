40|$|Grace Spena {{grew up with}} an {{interest}} in health sciences, first wanting to be a medical laboratory technologist and later a registered nurse after attending an open house on nursing at Saint Agnes Hospital, where she volunteered as a teenager. Upon completing her education in 1971 from the Jefferson Diploma School of Nursing, Ms. Spena began her career as a Staff Nurse in the Surgical ICU at Jefferson Hospital. She then went to Medical College of Pennsylvania, working as a Staff Nurse in the combined Medical/Surgical ICU and later as the Head Nurse of the 3 West Medical/Surgical unit. After completing her Bachelor’s in Nursing at Villanova University in 1980, Ms. Spena became the Assistant Director for Nursing at Northeastern Hospital. Before long she decided to pursue a Master’s degree in Nursing, also at Villanova. She subsequently worked as a Clinical Director at Saint Mary’s Hospital and as Vice President of Patient Care Services at Saint Agnes Hospital before shifting her career path to be a consultant for nursing at Sacred Heart <b>Hospital’s</b> <b>Surgical</b> <b>Services</b> area and at Patuxent River Naval Base Hospital’s OB/GYN unit, after which she became the Director of <b>Surgical</b> <b>Services</b> at Sacred Heart Hospital until the closure of the hospital in May 1994. After a period of unemployment, due primarily to changes in the healthcare industry which caused a significant impact on healthcare workforce and acute care hospitals, Ms. Spena transitioned to academia working as the College Nurse at Montgomery County Community College. After returning to Jefferson Hospital as the Nurse Manager for the Post-Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU) for almost two years, Ms. Spena finished her career back at Montgomery County Community College managing health and wellness initiatives. Though now retired, she continues to work part-time at Montgomery County Community College developing employee wellness initiatives and supporting other health related projects. [URL]...|$|R

The {{aim of this}} study was to analyse the demographic and geospatial characteristics of pediatric trauma patients in Scotland, and determine the level of destination healthcare facility which injured children are taken to, to determine the need for, and general feasibility, of developing a pediatric trauma system for Scotland. MethodsRetrospective analysis of incidents involving children aged 1 – 14 attended to by the Scottish Ambulance Service between 1 November 2008 and 31 October 2010. A subgroup with physiological derangement was defined. Incident location postcode was used to determine incident location by health board region, rurality and social deprivation. Destination healthcare facility was classified into one of six categories. ResultsOf 10, 759 incidents, 72. 3 % occurred in urban areas and 5. 8 % in remote areas. Incident location was associated with socioeconomic deprivation. Of the patients, 11. 6 % were taken to a pediatric hospital with pediatric intensive care facilities, 21. 8 % to a pediatric hospital without pediatric intensive care service, and 50. 2 % to an adult large general <b>hospital</b> without pediatric <b>surgical</b> <b>service.</b> ConclusionsThe majority of incidents involving children with injuries occurred in urban areas.

40|$|Background: We {{describe}} the practice variability of CUA (Canadian Urological Association) members and factors which predict these patterns for common stone scenarios. Methods: We asked 308 English- and 52 French-speaking CUA members to complete online surveys {{in their respective}} languages. We collected demographic information on fellowship train-ing, shock wave lithotripsy (SWL) access, academic setting and whether they are at a <b>hospital</b> with regionalized <b>surgical</b> <b>services.</b> Respondents indicated their actual as well as ideal treatment for scenarios of renal, proximal and distal ureteric calculi. Results: In total, 131 urologists responded (36 % response rate), all of whom treated urolithiasis. Of this number, 17 % had endourol-ogy fellowship training, 76 % had access to SWL, 42 % were at an academic institution and 66 % were at institutions with region-alized <b>surgical</b> <b>services.</b> Actual and ideal treatment modalities selected for symptomatic, distal and proximal ureteric stones (4, 8, 14 mm) were consistent with published guidelines. There were discrepancies {{between the use of}} ureteroscopy and SWL in actual versus ideal scenarios. Actual and ideal practices were congru-ent for proximal ureteric stones and asymptomatic renal calculi. In multivariate analysis, respondents were less likely to perform ureteroscopy on proximal 4 - and 8 -mm stones if they were at a <b>hospital</b> with regionalized <b>surgical</b> <b>services</b> (OR: 0. 097; 95 % CI: 0. 01 - 0. 76, p = 0. 03 and OR: 0. 330; 95 % CI: 0. 13 - 0. 83, p = 0. 02).

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{under-reporting}} of incontinence {{in older}} persons is well known. However, the general practitioner's (GP's) knowledge of incontinence {{in this population}} is less wall documented. AIM: To examine the knowledge of Irish GPs regarding incontinence in patients aged over 75, and {{to examine the relationship}} between incontinence and cognitive function in this age group. METHOD: Sixty-four GPs from six faculties of the Irish College of General Practitioners (ICGP), spread geographically over Ireland, administered a questionnaire to 10 of their patients, selected from the General Medical Services list, as part of the ICGP 1993 Care of the Elderly Study. A short test of cognitive function, the AMTS, was administered followed by RCGP (Royal College of General Practitioners) screening questions for incontinence, plus questions with regard to patients' prior reporting of incontinence. GPs were also asked to state their prior knowledge of the incontinence status of the patient and to choose from a list of management options including referral, assigning to a public health nurse, and <b>hospital</b> <b>surgical</b> <b>service.</b> RESULTS: Data were analysed on 527 patients aged over 75 years. Forty-four per cent of persons over 75 years reported having experienced urinary incontinence; 9 % reported having experienced faecal incontinence. GPs reported full knowledge of the incontinence status in only 33 % of their patients. The effects of low cognitive function, sex, and age on the probability of wetting were analysed using logistic regression modelling. Female sex and low cognitive score increased the likelihood of ever wetting; increasing age increased the likelihood of daily wetting. Poor sensitivities for these models limit their usefulness in clinical practice. CONCLUSION: GPs should have a high index of suspicion for incontinence in persons aged over 75. Thorough history-taking, physical examination, and examinations of therapeutic options for individual cases are recommended...|$|R

Dissertation supervisor: Dr. Mustafa Yasar Sir. Vita. [ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] <b>Surgical</b> <b>services</b> constitute {{a major portion of}} overall expenses in a hospital including staff salaries, operating rooms, beds, etc. Surgery is also a major source of revenue for a hospital. Therefore, an efficient management of <b>surgical</b> <b>services</b> is essential for <b>hospitals.</b> However, <b>surgical</b> <b>services</b> form a large system that involves complex interactions of multiple resources and complex trade-offs among multiple performance measures making it difficult to manage. We categorize activities in <b>surgical</b> <b>services</b> planning as long-term strategic decisions, mid-term tactical decisions, and short-term operational decisions and focus on three main planning problems in <b>surgical</b> <b>services,</b> one from each category and each having multiple objectives with difficult trade-offs. These include 1) strategic optimization of resource levels in <b>surgical</b> <b>services</b> considering labor cost, patient waiting time, and system completion time; 2) tactical staff scheduling to minimize average employee fatigue and shift preference scores; and 3) operational surgical case scheduling to determine the starting time of cases and assigning operating room to each case considering multiple objectives including minimizing the patient waiting time and completion time of the last case (i. e., makespan), and maximizing surgeon satisfaction with regard to their case sequence preferences. In addition, two data analysis studies are performed for supporting these three main problems. These include 1) developing forecasts to predict patient volumes for short-term corrective allocation decisions to make real-time changes to staff schedules determined by the tactical staff scheduling problem; and 2) developing a predictive model for estimating operation durations to schedule surgical cases efficiently. Our models can help hospital managers and schedulers to make better long-term, mid-term, and short-term decisions without compromising on efficiency while improving the safety and satisfaction in <b>surgical</b> <b>services.</b> Includes bibliographical references (pages 121 - 141) ...|$|R

40|$|There is {{conflicting}} evidence {{as to whether}} physicians who are certified in family medicine practise differently from their noncertified colleagues and what those differences are. We examined {{the extent to which}} certification in family medicine is associated with differences in the practice patterns of primary care physicians as reflected in their billing patterns. Billing data for 1986 were obtained from the Ontario Health Insurance Plan for 269 certified physicians and 375 noncertified physicians who had graduated from Ontario medical schools between 1972 and 1983 and who practised as general practitioners or family physicians in Ontario. As a group, certificants provided fewer services per patient and billed less per patient seen per month. They were more likely than noncertificants to include counselling, psychotherapy, prenatal and obstetric care, nonemergency <b>hospital</b> visits, <b>surgical</b> <b>services</b> and visits to chronic care facilities in their service mix and to bill in more service categories. Certificants billed more for prenatal and obstetric care, intermediate assessments, chronic care and nonemergency hospital visits and less for psychotherapy and after-hours services than noncertificants.

40|$|This study {{evaluate}} {{the need for}} general practitioners referrals and self referrals of acute abdominal pain patients to emergency <b>surgical</b> <b>service,</b> the appropriateness of GP referral diagnosis and their attitudes dealing with abdominal pain. In three months period all acute abdominal pain patient referrals to our <b>hospital</b> emergency <b>surgical</b> <b>service</b> were audited. Data on final diagnosis, surgical treatment, admission to hospital and surgery performance were recorded. Self referral or GP referral, referring GP diagnosis, referral letters indicating presenting complaint or history, axillar and rectal temperature measurement, laboratory checking and abdominal radiography checking by GP were recorded as well. Also, GPs examination details as palpation, auscultation and digit-rectal checking were recorded. We calculated sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value (PV) for referring diagnosis. Self referrals and GP referrals differences were evaluated. During the study 318 patients were admitted. A total of 163 (51. 25 %) referrals were deemed inappropriate; 102 (52. 6 % of GP referrals) and 61 (49. 2 % of self referred) (p< 0. 05). There were no differences in general treatment, hospital admission and operative treatment in self referred and GP referred groups (p< 0. 05 for all three categories). Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values for most frequent GP referral diagnoses were: abdominal colic/abdomen in observation 0. 78; 0. 66; 0. 74; 0. 70; acute appendicitis 0. 37; 0. 92; 0. 44; 0. 90; acute abdomen/peritonitis 0. 30; 0. 97; 0. 54; 0. 92; constipation 0. 95; 0. 98; 0. 85; 0. 99; and ileus 0. 83; 0. 97; 0. 50; 0. 99.

40|$|Background: Currently, {{there is}} a {{spreading}} worldwide tendency to characterize health issues and to propose alternative solutions via the creation of computerized databases. The {{aim of this study}} was to present the results in a computerized database of pediatric cardiac surgeries developed under the auspices of the Mexican Association of Specialists in Congenital Heart Diseases (Asociación Mexicana de Especialistas en Cardiopatías Congénitas A. C) and coordinated by the collegiate group of Pediatric Cardiology and Surgery as petitioned by the National Institutes of Health and High Specialty Hospitals Coordinating Commission. Methods: We analyzed all cases registered in the database during a 1 -year observation period (August 1, 2011 to July 31, 2012) by all major Health Ministry-dependent institutes and <b>hospitals</b> offering <b>surgical</b> <b>services</b> related to pediatric cardiopathies to the non-insured population. Results: Seven institutions participated voluntarily in completing the database. During the analyzed period, 943 surgeries in 880 patients with 7 % reoperations (n =  63) were registered. Thirty-eight percent of the surgeries were performed in children < 1 year of age. The five most common cardiopathies were patent ductus arteriosus (n =  96), ventricular septal defect (n =  86), tetralogy of Fallot (n =  72), atrial septal defect (n =  68), and aortic coarctation (n =  54). Ninety percent of surgeries were elective and extracorporeal circulation was used in 62 % of surgeries. Global mortality rate was 7. 5 % with the following distribution in the RACHS- 1 score categories: 1 (n =  4, 2 %), 2 (n =  19, 6 %), 3 (n =  22, 8 %), 4 (n =  12, 19 %), 5 (n =  1, 25 %), 6 (n =  6, 44 %), and non-classifiable (n =  2, 9 %). Conclusions: This analysis provides a representative view of the surgical practices in cardiovascular diseases in the pediatric population at the national non-insured population level. However, incorporating other health institutions to the national registry database will render a more accurate panorama of the national reality in surgical practices in the population < 18 years of age...|$|R
