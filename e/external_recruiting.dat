Using a contest model, this paper investigates the pure incentive effects of <b>external</b> <b>recruiting.</b> Our results show that if workers are heterogeneous, opening up a firm's career system may lead to a homogenization of the pool of contestants and thus encourage the firm's high-ability workers to exert more effort. If this positive effect outweighs the discouragement of low-ability workers, the firm will benefit from <b>external</b> <b>recruiting.</b> If, however, the discouragement effect dominates the homogenization effect, the firm should disregard <b>external</b> <b>recruiting.</b> In addition, product market competition may mean that opening up the career system becomes less attractive for a firm since it increases the incentives of its competitors’ workers and hence strengthens the competitors...|$|E
40|$|According to the {{previous}} literature on hiring, ?rms face a trade-off when deciding on external recruiting: From an incentive perspective, <b>external</b> <b>recruiting</b> is harmful since admission of external candidates reduces internal workers’ career incentives. However, if external workers have high abilities hiring from outside is bene?cial to improve job assignment. In our model, external workers do not have superior abilities. We show that external hiring can be pro?table from a pure incentive perspective. By opening its career system, a ?rm decreases the incentives of its low-ability workers. The incentives of high-ability workers can increase from a homogenization of the pool of applicants. Whenever this effect dominates, a ?rm prefers to admit external applicants.

40|$|A crucial {{personnel}} decision employers face {{is whether}} to fill {{a limited number of}} managerial positions with internal hires or <b>external</b> <b>recruits.</b> We present a theoretical and empirical analysis of this decision and how it relates to wage setting and the provision of general training. The theoretical framework is a promotion tournament involving M competing firms with heterogeneous productivities, two-level job hierarchies, and a fixed number of managerial positions. Employers provide general training to their workers, some of whom are promoted internally or raided by competing firms. We also consider an alternative model based on variation in the quality of the worker-employer match. Both models predict the following results: As the number of workers at the lower level of the hierarchy increases, holding fixed the number of managers at the top, 1) internal promotion increases relative to external recruitment, 2) employers provide more general training, 3) the percentage of employees in the upper tail of the wage distribution decreases, 4) profitability increases. We test these predictions using data from the 2004 wave of the WERS, a nationally-representative cross section of British establishments.

40|$|Strategic HRM has {{increasingly}} being identified with competitive advantage and organisational performance (Huselid, 1995). However {{the area of}} recruitment has often been seen as benign process and not a strategic area in itself. The Internet has created a potential paradigm shift, {{to the extent that}} e-recruitment is increasingly being seen as a source of competitive advantage (Greer, 2001). This paper examines the development of e-recruiting as a source of competitive advantage, the potential, pitfalls and problems. Recruitment and selection are intimately linked in the human resource literature. Generally recruitment is seen as part of the ‘mechanics ’ of the selection process in which organisations focus on attracting the interest of potential appointees.

Generally recruitment has been undertaken in a ‘passive ’ context where the major issues has been on {{the pros and cons of}} internal versus external recruitment.

This study investigates {{prevailing}} {{factors that}} impede {{the implementation of}} affirmative action in the Durban Automotive Cluster. This study will enable DAC affiliates to determine their obstacles and challenges {{with respect to the}} implementation of affirmative action. The service provider of the DAC CB and M Analysts) will also be able to advise companies through their development programmes and recommend {{what has to be done}} in order to bring blacks on board. This study relied on primary data. In-depth interviews were conducted with the senior managers ofDAC affiliates using unstructured questionnaires. Secondary data from the DAC database was analysed to strengthen the qualitative data. The data focused on the distribution of different population groups across the levels of occupations. The aim of the study is not to generalise about affirmative action but to obtain more in-depth clarity on the research problem. The findings have established that the pool of technically qualified and experienced blacks is very small and hence they are in short supply in the market. A number of factors such as direct ownership and low turnover of staff were raised as one of the aspects that hinder affirmative action. Constraints such as attitudes of white middle management appeared to have been addressed by these companies. The findings also clarified the role of human resources department in driving affirmative action. In most companies, the human resources department is part and parcel of management and actively involved in affirmative action. The study discovered that poaching also arises as a result of the shortage of skilled blacks. Retention of black employees is a problem for the majority of the companies. Despite these shortcomings, this study revealed that proper channels such as training, development and mentoring were followed for both internal and <b>external</b> <b>recruits.</b> This is being done to avoid window dressing. The other constraint of the affirmative action programme is government capacity. The key constraints to delivery are limited staff capacity, scarcity of human resources at governmental level; lack of coordination and integration with other spheres of national and provincial government labour departments and the lack of effective organizational, technical and managerial support for affirmative action. With respect to globalisation, the automotive sector is a dynamic and global sector which is changing fast due to technology and globalisation. As a result, the requirements of the Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM's) who are competing globally were seen as a hindering factor to the realisation of affirmative action. In conclusion, the achievements of affirmative action programmes amongst DAC affiliates were very modest in relation to both national expectations and their own stated goals due to shortage of skills, family and direct ownership and poaching. Implementation has proved far more complex and resource demanding than originally anticipated...|$|R

40|$|There {{is limited}} recent {{evidence}} from the UK on the sourcing and backgrounds of Chief Executive Officers (CEOs). Practitioner views are dominant and suggest a frequent “churn” of these individuals between lucrative roles. In particular, the implications of hiring profiles, organisational career paths and demographic backgrounds have not featured in the research focus, which has perpetuated the practitioner view of CEO succession. The governance implications of CEO successions in non-domestic companies are linked to home market culture to seek validation for different approaches to compliance with governance standards. This thesis presents three linked papers on CEO succession, with the final paper evolving a governance focus from a finding of the research into the earlier papers. Chapter 2 (Paper 1) considers the implications {{for the future of}} the publicly traded corporation in terms of its leadership talent pipeline by considering the questions of the succession, age and tenure, and recruitment of CEOs. It examines a sample of the 350 largest UK publicly quoted companies and develops a research agenda focused on the succession, age, tenure and provenance of recruits to senior executive roles. The paper shows the predominance of internal recruitment, with ageing CEOs in role for over six years and close to retirement. These CEOs tend to be replaced by successors with similar age profile and recruitment characteristics, as the level of “churn” of CEOs between roles is reported as minimal. It may appear that focus on succession planning has produced results, as many CEOs are recruited from an internal talent pool and enjoy longer tenures than previous research has indicated. However, the future talent pipeline may be at risk due to a lack of development opportunities. Chapter 3 (Paper 2) examines the outcomes of talent management at the 300 largest companies in the UK, using a quantitative approach. It examines the relationship between the functional backgrounds and age demographics of CEOs and firm performance. It further links antecedent organisational performance to the internal-external CEO hiring decision. The findings show a relative predominance of general management skills in current CEOs. Replacement CEOs are usually sourced internally and long tenure is associated with improved firm performance. This holds true even with below-average antecedent firm performance, where firms are expected to address strategic shortcomings by seeking an <b>external</b> <b>recruit.</b> The article discusses the implications of the findings for succession planning and career paths. Chapter 4 (Paper 3) engages with a small sample of non-domestic companies listed on the London Stock Exchange. Such companies may seek to access capital in a more liquid market as a statement to the market of a propensity to disclosure and a willingness to protect minority shareholders. Yet, many non-domestic companies retain tightly-controlled shareholding structures and are based in emerging regions where national cultural norms differ from the UK. The paper hypothesises on likely lower levels of compliance with the principles of the UK Corporate Governance Code. It further suggests a relationship between lower levels of compliance and non-domestic companies from countries that demonstrate high power-distance and uncertainty-avoidance in the Hofstede (1980 a) cultural values framework. In this exploratory approach to analysing compliance by non-domestic companies with the “comply-or-explain” governance regime in the UK, the paper develops a framework to guide future research into the contextual and cultural underpinnings of compliance monitoring and to enable regulators to further improve corporate governance codes...|$|R

40|$|Post {{settlement}} cod (3 - 11 cm {{total body}} length) juvenile s diet, condition, body length and macro parasites were investigated in coastal Skagerrak, June 2005. They {{were collected by}} beach seining in eelgrass habitats. Three fjord systems were targeted in eastern Skagerrak and three in the west. Two major exposure regimes were chosen; inner enclosed areas, and outer locations close to the coastal current. The aims were to get baseline data on the early life history of Skagerrak cod, and to investigate possible factors contributing to the records of poor recruitment to cod stocks of the eastern Skagerrak, and of smaller body lengths of juveniles inside many of the fjords. A total of 997 0 -group cod were investigated in a balanced study design for length, and of these 796 for external parasites, 363 for condition, liver index and internal parasites, and 218 for stomach contents. Cladocerans were surprisingly the dominant prey item by volume across most sites. A range of other prey types were also common at some sites, among them polychaetes, small and large copepods, small benthic crustaceans, and chironomid larvae. All the post settlement cod juveniles had what is regarded as an acceptable liver index indicating decent nutrient surplus from last weeks feeding. There was a distinct difference in the parasite fauna of the cod juveniles at the inner versus the outer sites: lice (Caligus elongatus) dominating the inner fjord samples in prevalences up to 20 %, and nematodes and spiny-headed worm (Echinorhynchus gadi) dominating the outer fjord areas. The study shows that cod recruits settling in Skagerrak coastal habitats already soon after settlement, at 3 - 4 cm total body length, utilize {{a wide range of}} food sources largely decoupled from the North Sea oceanic system. We suggest that the known stable weather conditions and high local coastal production in the early post settlement period of June is a reliable and important food source for the recruits of coastal cod. Abundances were lowest in the east, and consistently lowest at inner sites across all fjords. Low abundances at these sites is suggested to reflect recruitment limitation as they were five times lower than in outer western sites where densities of 0. 2 individuals per square meter is close to the saturation point for eelgrass found in other studies. The low abundances can be driven by the known absence of local recruitment in some of the fjords, and is also evidence of restricted import of <b>external</b> <b>recruits</b> to these inner fjords. Identical liver index at inner and outer sites in every fjord indicated that inner fjords were not detrimental environments. Poor environmental profitability is hence an unlikely explanation of the observed trend of shorter and slimmer (lower Fulton K at length) cod juveniles inside the western fjords. A more parsimonious explanation, which also lends support from the pronounced dichotomy in the parasite fauna between inner and outer sites, is a separation in pools of settling larvae between these areas. The presence of transparent juveniles inside the fjords indicated recent pulses of settlement here around 1 st of June. Estimated settlement dates along the outer coast were at least three weeks before. This result is in accordance with cod post settlement juveniles inside the fjords being primarily of local origin, and a majority of the ones at the outer coast being recruited from upstream sources like the North Sea or offshore banks with earlier spawning, a picture also emerging from several other recent studies along this Skagerrak coast. Further analysis of the detailed dynamics in the recruitment and early life stages of coastal cod should be very aware of this potentially mixed origin, and also that knowledge from the wealth of studies on the early life history and feeding on large copepods in the oceanic cod stocks seems to have limited relevance for cod settling in coastal areas...|$|R

METHODS: This was a single-site, multi-investigator, prospective, open-label, observational study in 15 patients with vision loss due to branch or central RVO treated with a single injection of DEX implant. An age-matched control group of 16 normal eyes was <b>recruited.</b> <b>External</b> and internal arteriolar diameters, WLR, and wall thickness were assessed in vivo using scanning-laser Doppler flowmetry. Visual acuity (VA) and central macular thickness (CMT) were evaluated. RESULTS: Mean internal diameter showed {{a significant reduction in}} post-treatment RVO patients compared with pre-treatment RVO patients (56. 0 ± 18. 0 [*]μm vs. 67. 9 ± 16. 9 [*]μm, respectively; P= 0. 02).

The <b>external</b> observers were <b>recruited</b> from researchers at the University of Brasilia; the facilitators, mother, fathers, and adolescents were recruited from the Coexistence and Relationship Strengthening Services, the Social Assistance Reference Centers (both part of social policies targeting vulnerable families), and the Legal Guardianship Council (a service focused on {{the protection of the}} rights of children and adolescents); and the multipliers and public managers were recruited from the Ministry of Health team. All the participants of this study were properly informed about their rights and expressed their agreement to participate in this study via an informed consent form. They were told about the voluntary character of the participation, the objectives of the research, the possibility of desisting at any moment, the protection of their identities in the data analysis and publications, access to the study results, anticipated uses of the data, the minimal risk, and the potential benefits of the study.|$|R
40|$|The “GTPase switch” paradigm, {{in which}} a GTPase {{switches}} between an active, GTP-bound state and an inactive, GDP-bound state through the recruitment of nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) or GTPase activating proteins (GAPs), {{has been used to}} interpret the regulatory mechanism of many GTPases. A notable exception to this paradigm is provided by two GTPases in the signal recognition particle (SRP) and the SRP receptor (SR) that control the co-translational targeting of proteins to cellular membranes. Instead of the classical “GTPase switch,” both the SRP and SR undergo a series of discrete conformational rearrangements during their interaction with one another, culminating in their reciprocal GTPase activation. Here, we show that this series of rearrangements during SRP-SR binding and activation provide important control points to drive and regulate protein targeting. Using real-time fluorescence, we showed that the cargo for SRP—ribosomes translating nascent polypeptides with signal sequences—accelerates SRP·SR complex assembly over 100 -fold, thereby driving rapid delivery of cargo to the membrane. A series of subsequent rearrangements in the SRP·SR GTPase complex provide important driving forces to unload the cargo during late stages of protein targeting. Further, the cargo delays GTPase activation in the SRP·SR complex by 8 – 12 fold, creating an important time window that could further improve the efficiency and fidelity of protein targeting. Thus, the SRP and SR GTPases, without <b>recruiting</b> <b>external</b> regulatory factors, constitute a self-sufficient system that provides exquisite spatial and temporal control of a complex cellular process...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Internal neck anatomy {{landmarks}} {{and their}} relation after placement of an extraglottic airway devices {{have not been}} studied extensively {{by the use of}} ultrasound. Based on our group experience with external landmarks as well as internal landmarks evaluation with other techniques, we aimed use ultrasound to analyze the internal neck anatomy landmarks and the related changes due to the placement of the Laryngeal Mask Airway Unique. Methods: Observational pilot investigation. Non-obese adult patients with no evidence of airway anomalies, were <b>recruited.</b> <b>External</b> neck landmarks were measured based on a validated and standardized method by tape. Eight internal anatomical landmarks, reciprocal by the investigational hypothesis to the external landmarks, were also measured by ultrasound guidance. The internal landmarks were re-measured after optimal placement and inflation of the extraglottic airway devices cuff Laryngeal Mask Airway Unique. Results: Six subjects were recruited. Ultrasound measurements of hyoid-mental distance, thyroid-cricoid distance, thyroid height, and thyroid width were found to be significantly (p < 0. 05) overestimated using a tape measure. Sagittal neck landmark distances such as thyroid height, sternal-mental distance, and thyroid-cricoid distance significantly decreased after placement of the Laryngeal Mask Airway Unique. Conclusion: The laryngeal mask airway Unique resulted in significant changes in internal neck anatomy. The induced changes and respective specific internal neck anatomy landmarks could help to design devices that would modify their shape accordingly to areas of greatest displacement. Also, while external neck landmark measurements overestimate their respective internal neck landmarks, as we previously reported, the concordance of each measurement and their respective conversion factor could continue to be of help in sizing extraglottic airway devices. Due to the pilot nature of the study, more investigations are warranted...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Half of all {{lower limb}} deep vein thrombi (DVT) in {{symptomatic}} ambulatory patients {{are located in}} the distal (calf) veins. While proximal disease warrants therapeutic anticoagulation to reduce the associated risks, distal DVT often goes untreated. However, a proportion of untreated distal disease will undoubtedly propagate or embolize. Concern also exists that untreated disease could lead to long-term post thrombotic changes. Currently, {{it is not possible to}} predict which distal thrombi will develop such complications. Whether these potential risks outweigh those associated with unrestricted anticoagulation remains unclear. The Anticoagulation of Calf Thrombosis (ACT) trial aims to compare therapeutic anticoagulation against conservative management for patients with acute symptomatic distal deep vein thrombosis. Methods ACT is a pragmatic, open-label, randomized controlled trial. Adult patients diagnosed with acute distal DVT will be allocated to either therapeutic anticoagulation or conservative management. All patients will undergo 3 months of clinical and assessor blinded sonographic follow-up, followed by 2 -year final review. The project will commence initially as an <b>external</b> pilot study, <b>recruiting</b> over a 16 -month period at a single center to assess feasibility measures and clinical event rates. Primary outcome measures will assess feasibility endpoints. Secondary clinical outcomes will be collected to gather accurate data for the design of a definitive clinical trial and will include: (1) a composite endpoint combining thrombus propagation to the popliteal vein or above, development of symptomatic pulmonary embolism or sudden death attributable to venous thromboembolic disease; (2) the incidence of major and minor bleeding episodes; (3) the incidence of post-thrombotic leg syndrome at 2 years using a validated screening tool; and (4) the incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) recurrence at 2 years. Discussion The ACT trial will explore the feasibility of comparing therapeutic anticoagulation to conservative management in acute distal DVT, within a modern cohort. We also aim to provide contemporary data on clot propagation, bleeding rates and long-term outcomes within both groups. These results will inform the conduct of a definitive study if feasibility is established. Trial registration Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN 7517569...|$|R
40|$|The {{focus of}} this paper is to explore the {{recruitment}} process for board members, and board member choices in family firms in Sweden. It was found that the board member re- cruitment process is a field with low amount of research. This is the main argument upon the construction of this study. Previous research also argue that most family businesses are small, which increase the likelihood of finding firms without an active board, or with low professionalism in the board. Through a case study, four Swedish family firms were interviewed in order to identify the board composition, board governance and board recruitment process at these firms. The firms represent different sizes, sectors, and stages of growth, being a small company with two employees and SEK 1. 7 m annual revenue, to a large company with 1200 employees and SEK 8 bn annual revenue. These companies were then analysed through both the agency theory, and the stewardship theory, using previous research as foundation and sup- port. The findings show that the most desired board member characteristic are knowledge within the sector the firm is operating in, as well as trustworthiness. All of the interviewed com- panies saw their board as more of a function to advise the family, rather than to monitor the managers, and having extensive knowledge from the sector is of relevance when giving advice. The members of these boards were recruited using the networks of the CEO, or us- ing consultancy firms to help finding potential members. Lack of trust was identified as a potential issue in board member recruitment, as the member will gain access to valuable in- formation. This led to the obstacle of letting external members in on the board. This ob- stacle, however, is recommended to be overseen as all CEO’s that were interviewed em- phasized the benefits of <b>recruiting</b> <b>external</b> members to the board, arguing that the benefits of having external members in the board outweighs the potential costs...|$|R
