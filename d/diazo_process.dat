40|$|The {{author has}} {{identified}} the following significant results. Work continues on mapping of 1970 urban land use from 1970 census contemporaneous aircraft photography. In addition, change detection analysis from 1972 aircraft photography is underway for several urban test sites. Land use maps, mosaics, and census overlays {{for the two}} largest urban test sites are nearing publication readiness. Preliminary examinations of ERTS- 1 imagery of San Francisco Bay have been conducted which show that tracts of land of more than 10 acres in size which are undergoing development in an urban setting can be identified. In addition, each spectral band is being evaluated as to its utility for urban analyses. It {{has been found that}} MSS infrared band 7 helps to differentiate intra-urban land use details not found in other MSS bands or in the RBV coverage of the same scene. Good quality false CIR composites have been generated from 9 x 9 inch positive MSS bands using the <b>Diazo</b> <b>process...</b>|$|E

For large scale diazo transfer reactions tosyl azide was generated {{and used in}} a telescoped flow process, to mitigate {{the risks associated with}} handling potentially explosive reagents on scale. The in situ formed tosyl azide was used to rapidly perform diazo transfer to a range of acceptors, including ??-ketoesters, ??-ketoamides, malonate esters and ??-ketosulfones. An effective in-line quench of sulfonyl azides was also developed, whereby a sacrificial acceptor molecule ensured complete consumption of any residual hazardous diazo transfer reagent. The telescoped <b>diazo</b> transfer <b>process</b> with in-line quenching was used to safely prepare over 21 g of an ??-diazocarbonyl in > 98 % purity without any column chromatography...|$|R
50|$|Tracing {{paper is}} paper made to have low opacity, {{allowing}} light to pass through. It was originally developed for architects and design engineers to create drawings {{which could be}} copied precisely using the <b>diazo</b> copy <b>process,</b> it then found many other uses. The original use for drawing and tracing was largely superseded by technologies which do not require diazo copying or manual copying (by tracing) of drawings.|$|R
40|$|The {{author has}} {{identified}} the following significant results. The land {{use of the}} Phoenix Quadrangle in Arizona had been mapped previously from aerial photographs and recorded in a computer data bank. During the ERTS experiment, changes in land use were detected, first with the ERTS-simulation photographs, then with the ERTS- 1 images when they became available. In each case, the I 2 S color additive viewer {{was used as the}} primary image enhancement tool, operated in a multispectral mode. A search was made for a method of creating hard copy color composite images of the best combinations of multiband composites from ERTS- 1, mostly by photographic and <b>diazo</b> <b>processes.</b> The I 2 S viewer was also used to enhance changes between successive images by quick flip techniques or by registering with different color filters. Improved interpretation of land use change resulted, and a map of changes in the Phoenix Quadrangle was compiled using magnified ERTS- 1 images alone. The first level of a standard land use classification system was successfully used. Between the ERTS- 1 images for August and November, some differences were detected that could be caused by seasonal characteristics of vegetation or by change in use...|$|R

More recently, a Bausch and Lomb zoom transferscope has been used for the same purpose. Improved interpretation of land use change resulted, and a map of changes within the Phoenix Quadrangle was compiled. The first level of a proposed standard land use classification system was sucessfully used. ERTS- 1 underflight photography was used to check the accuracy of the ERTS- 1 image interpretation. It was found that the total areas of change detected in the photos were comparable with the total areas of change detected in the ERTS- 1 images...|$|R
50|$|Whiteprint {{describes}} a document reproduction produced {{by using the}} <b>diazo</b> chemical <b>process.</b> It {{is also known as}} the blue-line process since the result is blue lines on a white background. It is a contact printing process which accurately reproduces the original in size, but cannot reproduce continuous tones or colors. The light-sensitivity of the chemicals used was known in the 1890s and several related printing processes were patented at that time. Whiteprinting replaced the blueprint process for reproducing architectural and engineering drawings because the process was simpler and involved fewer toxic chemicals. A blue-line print is not permanent and will fade if exposed to light for weeks or months, but a drawing print that lasts only a few months is sufficient for many purposes.|$|R
50|$|Many {{copies of}} {{technical}} drawings {{may be required}} {{in the construction of}} a project. Reproductions must be accurate as to size and shape, but for many purposes need not be permanent. The blueprint process was first used for mechanical reproduction of drawings. Drawing offices may use <b>diazo</b> or whiteprint <b>processes.</b> Where the volume of drawings reproduced justifies the cost of the machine, a large format photocopier using xerography can reproduce drawings at lower cost than re-plotting them.|$|R
40|$|According to {{the method}} {{described}} by Komuta, jaundiced urine was salted out with ammonium sulfate, and the bilirubin, collected on a filter paper, was extracted in methanol. After {{the addition of}} the double dose of chloroform to the methanol solution, the dark-reddish precipitation was obtained, that was the ester-form bilirubin. On the other hand, its supernatant was dried in vacuo and then dissolved it in water, followed by the addition of chloroform to that solution. The dark-brown flocculate appeared at borderline of the both solution, that was considered to be an unknown bilirubinoid forming the intermediate zone. A spectrophotometrical examination was performed on the <b>diazo</b> reaction's <b>process</b> of the ester-form bilirubin and the unknown bilirubinoid. The following results were obtained; After {{the addition of the}} diazo reagent to the methanol solution of ester-form bilirubin, a color with reddish-violet ton was appeared rapidly, while a maximum on the absorption curve of the azopigments appeared after a little while, and its absorption maximum was shown at 530 to 540 mμ. A blue-violet color appeared macroscopically after the addition of HCl to the ester-form bilirubin-azopigment, its absorption maximum moved to 560 mμ, while no change in its absorption curve was seen after leaving this acid azopigment in the room temperature for 48 hours. In adding the diazo reagent to the methanol solution of the bilirubinoid forming the intermediate zone, its absorption curve also moved as like as that in the ester-form bilirubin. On the other hand, the absorption maximum of its azopigment showed at 550 mμ, and there was no appearance of a color with the blue ton by the addition of HCl to this azopigment. Moreover, its absorption maximum moved only a little toward 560 mμ, namely {{to the side of the}} long wavelength, and this acid azopigment showed no particular change on its absorption curve after leaving it in the room temperature for 72 hours...|$|R
