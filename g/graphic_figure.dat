40|$|Recent eye {{tracking}} studies in natural tasks {{suggest that there}} is a tight link between eye movements and goal directed motor actions. However, most existing models of human eye movements provide a bottom up account that relates visual attention to attributes of the visual scene. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to introduce a new model of human eye movements that directly ties eye movements to the ongoing demands of behavior. The basic idea is that eye movements serve to reduce uncertainty about environmental variables that are task relevant. A value is assigned to an eye movement by estimating the expected cost of the uncertainty that will result if the movement is not made. If there are several candidate eye movements, the one with the highest expected value is chosen. The model is illustrated using a humanoid <b>graphic</b> <b>figure</b> that navigates on a sidewalk in a virtual urban environment.

The system consists of off-the-shelf hardware (a camera connected to a Pentium PC) and software to (a) automatically select and track region features despite changes in illumination, (b) estimate three-dimensional position and orientation of surface patches rel-ative to an inertial reference frame despite individual point-features appearing and disappearing, (c) insert a texture-mapped virtual object into the scene {{so as to make}} it appear {{to be part of the}} scene and moving with it (see Figures 1 and 2).

What our demo shows is that results of only slightly inferior quality can be obtained in a completely automatic fashion (no human intervention what-soever), while processing the sequence causally (the pose of the virtual object at time is decided based on observations of the sequence up to time).

40|$|<b>Graphic</b> <b>figures</b> {{and various}} types of {{infographics}} have become {{an essential part of}} the scientific papers, business presentations and study materials. Although, authors of these documents often lack the knowledge of basic rules and principles of graphic design and learn how to create figures by trial and error. Literature addressing the issues of effective verbal (presentation skills) and non-verbal (principles of scientific writing) is available and accessible. Though literature addressing the issues of scientific figure design and general visual design are very few, sometimes non existent, despite the fact that images, figures and various charts are one of the most effective mediums for information sharing. This lack of material knowledge is detrimental to the quality of works of managers, professors and researchers. This thesis attempts to fill in this gap and motivate readers to further development and research of the issue. The thesis addresses the issue of figures from its core, those being the basic principles of image perception and interpretation. Building on concepts of theorists like Peirce, Saussure and Eco the thesis will then define the meaning and purpose of "Image Interpretation Value". Selected principles of figure construction and interpretation will be introduced. These principles will then be further analyzed and applied on the level of business and scientific figures. Each chapter will include various <b>graphic</b> <b>figures</b> and practical examples to enhance further understanding of the issue. The primary purpose and goal of this thesis is to create an easy-to-follow set of instructions and suggestions on how to design effective and intelligible figures to be used in the fields of business communication, scientific research and academic teaching...|$|R

25|$|The main, and obvious, {{advantage}} of consensus logos over sequence logos is {{their ability to}} be embedded as text in any Rich Text Format supporting editor/viewer and, therefore, in scientific manuscripts. As described above, the consensus logo is a cross between sequence logos and consensus sequences. As a result, compared to a sequence logo, the consensus logo omits information (the relative contribution of each character to the conservation of that position in the motif/alignment). Hence, a sequence logo should be used preferentially whenever possible. That being said, the need to include <b>graphic</b> <b>figures</b> in order to display sequence logos has perpetuated the use of consensus sequences in scientific manuscripts, even though they fail to convey information on both conservation and frequency. Consensus logos represent therefore an improvement over consensus sequences whenever motif/alignment information has to be constrained to text.|$|R
