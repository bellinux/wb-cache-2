40|$|Background: The use of plasma {{rather than}} serum for {{determination}} of cardiac troponins can improve turn-around time and potentially avoid <b>incomplete</b> <b>serum</b> separation that may produce falsely increased results. We investigated {{the influence of}} <b>incomplete</b> <b>serum</b> separation {{and the effect of}} heparin-plasma on cardiac troponin concentrations. Methods: Serum and heparin-plasma samples were drawn simultaneously from 100 patients (50 patients with acute coronary syndrome and 50 patients after open heart surgery) and measured on three different analytical systems, two for determination of cardiac troponin I (cTnI; Abbott AxSYM and Bayer ACS:Cen-taur) and one for cardiac troponin T (cTnT; Roche Elecsys cTnT STAT). Serum samples were reanalyze...|$|E
40|$|Some {{time ago}} the WHO Expert Committee on Biological Standardization asked the National Institute for Medical Research, London, {{to consult with}} the WHO International Blood Group Reference Laboratory {{concerning}} {{the establishment of an}} international standard for albumin-potentiated anti-Rho (anti-D) blood-typing serum. This paper describes the collection and testing of sera, the removal of unwanted antibodies, the pooling of the sera and the distribution in equal amounts in 3350 ampoules, which were subsequently freeze-dried. The titres were determined by 29 laboratories in 21 countries by means of four methods—suspension in albumin, replacement with albumin, enzyme (papain) treatment and the anti-human-globulin test. On the basis of the results obtained, the material has been established as the International Standard for Anti-Rho (Anti-D) <b>Incomplete</b> Blood-Typing <b>Serum</b> and the International Unit has been defined, with the agreement {{of the participants in the}} collaborative study, as the activity contained in 0. 95 mg of the International Standard for Anti-Rho (Anti-D) <b>Incomplete</b> Blood-Typing <b>Serum...</b>|$|R
40|$|Specific {{interchange}} {{takes place}} between 131 I-marked antibody combined with cellular antigens {{and the free}} unmarked antiserum antibody in three systems studied: (A) bovine cells with (i) human infectious mononucleosis serum and (ii) rabbit anti-bovine serum and (B) human Rh D-positive cells with Rh <b>incomplete</b> anti-D <b>serum.</b> The rate of interchange is much slower than the initial combination of an unmarked antibody with an unoccupied antigenic site, and also is slower in the Rh incomplete system than in the other systems studied. Rabbit antibovine red cell antiserum partly interchanges with 131 I-marked infectious antibody on bovine cells, but the reverse interaction does not apparently take place at all. Possible reasons are put forward to explain this. The infectious mononucleosis interchange reaction has a large temperature coefficient (about 4. 9) which corresponds to a heat of reaction of 29, 000 cal...|$|R
40|$|Since it was {{demonstrated}} that some sera of rheumatoid arthritic patients would agglutinate human Rh-positive O-erythrocytes {{coated with a}} selected <b>incomplete</b> anti-Rh <b>serum</b> (Grubb, 1956; Waller and Vaughan, 1956), this phenomenon has been extensively investigated (for example, in Finland by Julkunen, Laine, Koskinen, and Tiilikainen, 1958). Grubb and Laurell (1956) showed that this agglutination is inhibited by some human sera. The inhibitory factor {{has been shown to}} belong to the gamma globulin fraction of the serum and to be a mendelian domi-nantly hereditary character. The corresponding phenotype is called Gm (a+), and its frequency in normal population lies between 55 and 95 per cent. (Grubb, 1959). 65 per cent. of a sample of 477 sera from the normal Finnish population were found to be Gm (a+) (MAkela and Tiilikainen, 1959), the corresponding recessive character Gm (a-) being found in the remaining 35 per cent...|$|R

40|$|Background. Acute {{interstitial}} nephritis (AIN) {{is a frequent}} cause of Acute Kidney Injury (AKI). Drug hypersensitivity {{is the most common}} etiology and the list of drugs that can induce AIN is not exhaustive yet. Case Report. Here, we describe the case of a 43 -year-old man who was treated with nifedipine (Adalate®) for Raynaud’s syndrome. After nifedipine introduction, serum creatininemia progressively increased from 91 to 188 [*]μmol/L in a few months and AKI was diagnosed. Laboratory work-up results indicated the presence of tubular proteinuria and nonspecific inflammatory syndrome. Histological analysis found granulomatous interstitial nephropathy without necrosis in 20 % of the kidney biopsy without immunofluorescent deposit. Nifedipine was stopped and corticosteroid treatment was started with a rapid but <b>incomplete</b> reduction of <b>serum</b> creatininemia level to 106 [*]μmol/L. Conclusion.

40|$|A {{collaborative}} study involving nine independent assays by eight laboratories has recalibrated the anti-D {{concentration of the}} International Reference Preparation of Anti-D Immunoglobulin (68 / 417) {{in terms of the}} International Standard for Anti-Rho (anti-D) <b>Incomplete</b> Blood Typing <b>Serum</b> (64 / 16). This study was carried out when it was found that 68 / 419 had been calibrated not against 64 / 16, as originally intended, but inadvertently against another preparation. Based on the results, a revised rounded off value of 300 IU anti-D per ampoule of 68 / 419 was assigned by the Expert Committee on Biological Standardisation of WHO at its 30 th meeting. Many of the known variables in anti-D quantitation using the AutoAnalyzer were considered in the preparation of the protocol for this study. The remarkably close agreement of the results indicated that the format can be used as an acceptable model for interlaboratory studies in the future...|$|R

The injections were given once per month for two consecutive months followed by two more injections of the same protein mixed 1 : 1 with Freund’s <b>incomplete</b> adjuvant. The <b>serum</b> antibody thus obtained was preadsorbed on peptone grown cellular proteins. Small strips of nitrocellulose membrane were soaked in total protein isolated from PM 102 cells grown in 0.2 % peptone and air dried. These strips were immersed in the serum antibody diluted 1 : 100 with buffer A (10  mM tris HCl pH 8, 1  mM EDTA pH 8, 0.05 % tween 20 and 0.9 % NaCl) under mild shaking for 1  hour. This process was repeated thrice until all antibodies to the common peptone antigens were removed. The antibody solution finally obtained was specific against TCE inducible proteins of the PM 102 isolate.|$|R

Optimal conditions were studied and they are essential for the most sensitive and accurate assay, but if the results are estimated from serum-containing standards accurate values can be obtained even under less than optimal conditions. Subnormal serum B 12 concentrations can be detected visually as early as 24 hours after the start of assay. For diagnostic purposes the assay can be read at three days, provided that appropriate dilutions are used, conditions are optimal, and growth is measured in a 1 cm. cell...|$|R
40|$|Renal glomerular lesions were {{induced by}} rabbit serum {{containing}} antibody to rat collagen injected intravenously into rats prepared with subcutaneously administered Freund adjuvant. Neither the anti-collagen serum nor the adjuvant alone induced the lesion. The lesions {{were characterized by}} diffuse glomerular injury with swelling, shredding, and fusion of the basement membranes, crescent formation, cellular proliferation, numerous multinuclear giant cells, and capillary hyaline thrombi. Various rabbit antisera, including those against fish collagen or rat serum failed to induce the renal lesion when substituted for anti-rat collagen serum. Also, anti-rat collagen serum absorbed with its homologous antigen, native rat collagen, failed to induce the lesion. Although complete adjuvant, i. e. with mycobacteria, in which normal serum was incorporated enhanced the glomerular lesion which resulted from intravenous injection of anti-collagen <b>serum,</b> the <b>incomplete</b> adjuvant without <b>serum</b> was sufficient. Comparison of the renal lesions induced by anti-collagen serum with nephrotoxic nephritis induced in rats by rabbit anti-kidney serum showed that they differ histologically. Also the antisera used to produce these two renal lesions differ immunologically. Antibodies to normal rabbit serum developed in rats injected intravenously with rabbit anti-rat collagen serum after preparation with adjuvant, but not when adjuvant was omitted. The pathogenesis of the renal injury is discussed {{as a manifestation of}} an antigen-antibody reaction, with nephritis occurring only after the adjuvant-stimulated antibody to the rabbit globulin has been formed in the rat and has reacted with the rabbit anti-rat collagen already fixed by its homologous antigen in the kidney...|$|R
40|$|Mounting {{evidence}} indicates that a disturbed Wnt-β-catenin signaling {{may be involved in}} the pathogenesis of chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone and mineral disorder (CKD-MBD). Data on the impact of CKD on circulating levels of the Wnt antagonists sclerostin and Dickkopf related protein 1 (DKK 1) and the relationship with laboratory parameters of CKD-MBD are <b>incomplete.</b> We analyzed <b>serum</b> sclerostin and DKK 1 in 308 patients across the stages of chronic kidney disease (kDOQI stage 1 - 2 n = 41; CKD stage 3 n = 54; CKD stage 4 - 5 n = 54; hemodialysis n = 100; peritoneal dialysis n = 59) as well as in 49 healthy controls. We investigated associations with demographics, renal function, parameters of mineral metabolism including 25 (OH) vitamin D, 1, 25 (OH) 2 vitamin D, biointact fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF 23), and parathyroid hormone (PTH), and bone turnover markers. Serum sclerostin, but not DKK 1, increases in more advanced stages of CKD and associates with PTH, phosphate, and 1, 25 (OH) 2 vitamin D concentrations. Bone turnover markers are highest in hemodialysis patients presenting the combination of high PTH with low sclerostin level. Serum DKK 1 levels are lower in CKD patients than in controls and are not associated with laboratory parameters of mineral metabolism. Interestingly, a direct association between DKK 1 and platelet count was observed. In CKD, serum levels of the Wnt inhibitors DKK 1 and sclerostin are unrelated, indicating different sites of origin and/ or different regulatory mechanisms. Sclerostin, as opposed to DKK 1, may qualify as a biomarker of CKD-MBD, particularly in dialysis patients. DKK 1 serum levels, remarkably, correlate almost uniquely with blood platelet counts...|$|R
40|$|Commercial {{modified}} live (MLV) {{and killed}} (KV) porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) vaccines induce slow development of effective immunity {{as measured by}} serum neutralizing (SN) antibody and cell-mediated immunity. The objective of the studies was to develop more effective vaccines or vaccination strategies based on commercial vaccines. The immune response and produced induced were characterized. Three separate studies were conducted to investigate the efficacy of vaccination protocols including vaccination with MLV and KV, either alone or in combination, KV with interleukin (IL) - 12 added, and KV used as a booster vaccine in a PRRSV positive herd. The protection induced was also evaluated by challenging pigs with PRRSV.;It {{was found that the}} MLV followed by KV induced significantly higher SN antibody levels compared to either vaccine alone. This vaccination protocol significantly reduced serum viral RNA, severity of lung lesion, and clinical disease. In contrast, the addition of IL- 12 did little to enhance the efficacy of the KV although clinical respiratory disease consistent with PRRSV following challenge was significantly reduced. However, no reduction of viral RNA in serum or reduced persistence of virus in tonsils or BAL was observed. The KV administration of gestational sows significantly increased SN antibodies in serum and colostrum at farrowing and at weaning compared to non-vaccinated sows. Furthermore, pigs farrowed from the vaccinated sows had significantly higher levels of maternally derived antibodies (MDA) as measured by both SN and ELISA assays than pigs farrowed from the non-vaccinated sows. Pigs farrowed from vaccinated sows and challenged at 10 days of age displayed the mildest clinical disease and had lower levels of serum viral RNA than pigs from non-vaccinated sows. <b>Incomplete</b> reduction of <b>serum</b> viral RNA and lung lesion suggests incomplete protection provided by MDA.;The present studies provide useful information to the swine industry as a combination vaccination protocol, MLV followed by KV, could be used to in the reduction of clinical disease and viremia. In addition, KV {{can be used as a}} booster vaccine to enhance the existing immunity of sows in a PRRSV positive herd resulting in enhanced MDA in piglets...|$|R
40|$|GnRH antagonists plus {{testosterone}} (T) suppress LH and FSH {{levels and}} inhibit spermatogenesis to azoospermia or severe oligozoospermia. High-dose T treatment alone {{has been shown}} to be an effective male contraceptive (contraceptive efficacy rate of 1. 4 per 100 person yr). Combined GnRH antagonist and T induces azoospermia more rapidly and at a higher incidence than T alone; this combination has therefore been proposed as a prototype male contraceptive. However, because GnRH antagonists are expensive to synthesize and difficult to deliver, it would be desirable to rapidly suppress sperm counts to low levels with GnRH antagonist plus T and maintain azoospermia or severe oligozoospermia with T alone. In this study, 15 healthy men (age 21 - 41 yr) with normal semen analyses were treated with T enanthate (TE) 100 mg im/week plus 10 mg Nal-Glu GnRH antagonist sc daily for 12 weeks to induce azoospermia or severe oligozoospermia. At 12 - 16 weeks, 10 of 15 subjects had zero sperm counts, and 14 of 15 had sperm counts less than 3 x 10 (6) /mL. The 14 who were suppressed on combined treatment were maintained on TE alone (100 mg/week im) for an additional 20 weeks. Thirteen of 14 subjects in the TE alone phase had sperm counts maintained at less than 3 x 10 (6) /mL for 20 weeks. Ten remained persistently azoospermic or had sperm concentration of 0. 1 x 10 (6) /mL once during maintenance. Mean LH and FSH levels in the subjects were suppressed to 0. 4 +/- 0. 2 IU/L and 0. 5 +/- 0. 2 IU/L in the induction phase, which was maintained in the maintenance phase. The 1 subject who failed to suppress sperm counts during induction had serum LH and FSH reduced to 0. 3 and 0. 5 IU/L, respectively. The subject who failed to maintenance had LH and FSH suppressed to 1. 0 and 0. 2 IU/L, respectively, during the induction phase but these rose to 1. 6 and 2. 1 IU/L, respectively, during maintenance. Failure to suppress or maintain low sperm counts may be related to <b>incomplete</b> suppression of <b>serum</b> LH and FSH levels. We conclude that sperm counts suppressed with GnRH antagonist plus T can be maintained with relatively low dose TE treatment alone. This concept should be explored further in the development of effective, safe, and affordable hormonal male contraceptives. ...|$|R
40|$|Highly dilute {{solutions}} of the alkaline oleates, {{which do}} not suffice to alter appreciably the morphology or reproductive power of the pneumococci, nevertheless produce profound changes in their structure. Pneumococci treated with sodium oleate become more subject to autolysis, as is indicated both by the rapidity and the perfection {{of the process of}} self-digestion, {{and at the same time}} they become subject to serum-lysis. The serum-lysis of the soaped pneumococci tends to be <b>incomplete</b> with normal <b>serum</b> and to be perfect with an immune antipneumococcus serum. When normal serum is employed, the surviving pneumococci subsequently multiply either in the test tube or in the animal body, in the latter case producing fatal infection. When, on the other hand, an immune serum is employed, lysis is complete, no multiplication occurs, the test tube mixture is sterilized, and the inoculated animal is protected from infection. The inhibition of their activity which the soaps ordinarily suffer in the presence of protein, can be prevented by the addition of an appropriate quantity of boric acid, so that suitable mixtures of serum, soap, and boric acid can continue to exert a deleterious and solvent influence on the pneumococci, and the effect is greater when immune serum is employed in the mixtures. Infection can not only be prevented when the mixture of immune serum, soap, and boric acid is added to the pneumococci before injection into the peritoneal cavity of small animals, but the infection can likewise be prevented when a therapeutic injection of a mixture of the three substances mentioned is made to follow the inoculation of normal, highly virulent diplococci. The limits of the activity of the therapeutic mixture are determined, in part by the amount of protein to be overcome, and in part by the peculiarities of the infection occurring in highly susceptible animal species. The virulence of the pneumococci is somewhat diminished by the soap treatment, but the treated organisms are not rendered more subject to phagocytosis. It would appear that the action of the soap is exerted upon the lipoidal moiety of the bacterial cells, through which they are rendered more pervious to serum constituents and brought under their deleterious and dissolving influence. The changes in the pneuocci here described probably have a prototype in the resolving exudate of a pneumonic process; so that it may be considered that they occur in the animal body in the course of spontaneous infection and constitute one of the conditions of the conquest of the organism by the body's forces. A certain conformity exists between the manner of destruction of the pneumococci in a pneumonic exudate and that in the artificially prepared soap-serum mixtures. In order to imitate outside of the body the conditions of the removal of pneumococci within the body, it does not suffice merely to study the reactions to leucocytes and serum and to conclude from these reactions the means which the body employs for the disposal of the diplococci; but it is necessary to invoke still other factors, among which are the effects of chemical substances present in exudates, of which the soaps represent one class. The failure hitherto to unify the reactions in test tubes with those occurring in the body in connection with the pneumococcus may be due to the fact that account was not taken of this class of chemical bodies. Whether the principle here presented can be made applicable to the treatment of local pneumococcus infections in human beings is a pressing question. Its application to the treatment of local infections, to the seats of which the serum, soap, and boric acid mixtures can be directly applied, particularly after evacuation of an inflammatory exudate, seems to offer promise...|$|R
