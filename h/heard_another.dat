5|$|In , (1872) the Supreme Court <b>heard</b> <b>another</b> Civil Rights Act case {{relating}} to federal courts in Kentucky. John Blyew and George Kennard were white men visiting the cabin {{of a black}} family, the Fosters. Blyew apparently became angry with sixteen-year-old Richard Foster and hit him twice {{in the head with}} an ax. Blyew and Kennard killed Richard's parents, Sallie and Jack Foster, and his blind grandmother, Lucy Armstrong. They severely wounded the Fosters' two young daughters. Kentucky courts would not allow the Foster children to testify against Blyew and Kennard. But federal courts, authorized by the Civil Rights Act, found Blyew and Kennard guilty of murder. When the Supreme Court took the case, they ruled (5–2) that the Foster children did not have standing in federal courts because only living people could take advantage of the Act. In doing so, the Courts effectively ruled that Thirteenth Amendment did not permit a federal remedy in murder cases. Swayne and Joseph P. Bradley dissented, maintaining that in order to have meaningful effects, the Thirteenth Amendment would have to address systemic racial oppression.|$|E
5|$|The new Virginia {{counties}} {{were growing}} rapidly, {{and with this}} growth came trouble. Trigg was appointed {{as one of the}} judges to the Virginia Land Court commission of 1779–80 charged with settling land disputes in Kentucky County, Virginia. The Virginia Land Act of 1779 had set up this court of four judges in order to examine the numerous land claims and to certify valid titles. The four judges arrived at St. Asaph in October and triggered emigration to Kentucky as people wished to either certify their claims or seek unclaimed land. They closed their court on February 26, 1780, and prepared to return home. However, in March they were told that they had to reopen the court and stay through April, as claimants were delayed due to weather. Trigg and two fellow judges reconvened on April 16 and <b>heard</b> <b>another</b> 134 cases. In all, the court judged 1,328 claims covering over 1 million acres (4,000km²) of land. After these sessions ended, Trigg stayed and established his home on 1,000 acres (4km²) of land at Trigg's Station about four miles (6km) north-west of Harrodsburg in Kentucky County, Virginia.|$|E
25|$|Mrs. Connally {{testified that}} just after hearing a loud, {{frightening}} noise {{that came from}} somewhere behind her and to her right, she turned toward President Kennedy and saw him raise his arms and elbows, {{with his hands in}} front of his face and throat. She then <b>heard</b> <b>another</b> gunshot and then Governor Connally yelling. Mrs. Connally then turned away from Kennedy toward her husband, at which point another gunshot sounded and she and the limousine's rear interior were covered with fragments of skull, blood, and brain.|$|E

25|$|From 3 December 1942 to 22 January 1943, the {{submarine}} conducted a combined minelaying and offensive patrol, again in waters surrounding the Japanese home islands. On 20 December, she began planting a minefield off Inubo Saki, Honshū. Trigger planted the northern {{half of the}} field and was working on the southern part when a cargo ship passed her, heading into the newly-laid mines. Five minutes later, a violent explosion rocked the freighter which sank while an escort circled her. The submarine later <b>heard</b> <b>another</b> explosion {{from the direction of the}} minefield and, when she surfaced the next day, found the field was covered by smoke.|$|E
500|$|Composer Mark Snow {{described}} his score as possessing a [...] "sense of biblical fervor and religiosity—an elegy—a feeling {{about it that}} was so poignant and touching to me." [...] "My Weakness", a song by Moby from his 1999 album Play, is used in this episode, during the first scene when the FBI discover the mass grave and near the end when Mulder encounters his sister's spirit. Carter never told Snow about {{the decision to use}} someone else's music, although Snow has since said that his reaction {{to the use of the}} song was very positive and that the song was a [...] "perfect" [...] fit for the scenes in which it can be <b>heard.</b> <b>Another</b> Moby song, [...] "The Sky is Broken" [...] also from Play, would be featured in the late seventh-season episode [...] "all things".|$|E
500|$|The {{album was}} met with {{positive}} reviews by music critics. Fabiola Hinojosa, of Televisa Espectáculos stated that the album [...] "shows that despite being a rocker at heart, she has no problem recording in another genre and experiment with new rhythms." [...] Hinojosa also praised the rock song [...] "No Puedo Parar", arguing that [...] "if someone who never before had <b>heard</b> <b>another</b> song from her would believe that she [...] only performs in the rock genre". Ángel Rodríguez of ADN Informativo said that [...] "Guzmán is back and wants to reclaim her place on the music market." [...] Rodríguez also reminded that Guzmán keeps trying to incorporate new or alternative rhythms to her music even if the results are not commercially successful, such as her albums Cambio de Piel (1996) produced by Spanish musician Carlos Narea, or Lipstick (2004), helmed by American artist Desmond Child, and A + No Poder is no exception, since the [...] "Queen of Rock in Mexico" [...] includes songs that [...] "hark back to {{the era of the}} nineties, but so potentiated with harder songs where the guitars, drums and her hoarse voice come together in musical chords." [...] Alex Alexdy of Hey Espectáculos referred to this album as a [...] "well balance between rock and pop" [...] that shows Guzmán's excentric side who opted for a rock album with some ballads and new rhythms such as reggaeton.|$|E
6000|$|On the {{following}} evening {{at nine o'clock}} the whistle was <b>heard,</b> and <b>another</b> ball lowered {{down at the end}} of the string. The instructions this time were: ...|$|R
60|$|At {{that moment}} a heavy rapid tread was <b>heard</b> outside. <b>Another</b> moment, and Bob Massey sprang into the church, panting, flushed, dirty, wet, wild, and, withal, grandly savage.|$|R

2500|$|At {{the south}} {{entrance}} to Makassar Strait, SS-271 intercepted {{a convoy of}} three ships and sank the cargo ship Kōshū Maru. Nine days later, she scored damaging hits on a transport and sank cargo ship Zuisho Maru. On 18 August, off northern Balabac Strait, Philippines, Ray closed a large convoy protected by surface escorts and planes, fired six [...] "tin fish" [...] at a tanker, and dived as a destroyer raced in to counterattack. Heavy explosions were heard, and a 2½-hour depth charge pounding followed. During the action, Ray <b>heard</b> <b>another</b> violent explosion {{and the sounds of}} a ship breaking up, as the tanker Nansei Maru went down. The submarine surfaced that evening and pursued the convoy into Palawan Bay.|$|E
2500|$|At 11:22, the {{custodian}} called Deputy Neil Gardner, {{the assigned}} Student Resource Officer to Columbine, {{on the school}} radio, requesting assistance in the senior parking lot. The only paved route took him around the school {{to the east and}} south on Pierce Street, where, at 11:23 he heard on his police radio that a female was down, and assumed she had been struck by a car. While exiting his patrol car in the Senior lot at 11:24, he <b>heard</b> <b>another</b> call on the school radio, [...] "Neil, there's a shooter in the school". Harris, at the west entrance, immediately turned and fired ten shots from his carbine at Gardner, who was sixty yards away. As Harris reloaded his carbine, Gardner leaned over the top of his car and fired four rounds at Harris from his service pistol. Harris ducked back behind the building, and Gardner momentarily believed that he had hit him. Harris then reemerged and fired at least four more rounds at Gardner (which missed and struck two parked cars), before retreating into the building. No one was hit during the exchange of gunfire. Gardner was not wearing his prescription eyeglasses and was unable to hit the shooters.|$|E

5000|$|The song is <b>heard</b> in <b>another</b> 2017 TV {{commercial}} for Arby's, but with Ving Rhames dubbing the word [...] "gyro" [...] over the word [...] "hero" [...] in the lyrics.|$|R
60|$|They {{had never}} seen one another. Guido {{had never seen}} Isolde, Isolde had never seen Guido. They had never <b>heard</b> one <b>another</b> speak. They had never been together. They did not know one another.|$|R
60|$|Both boys {{strained}} {{their ears}} once more, and now <b>heard</b> <b>another</b> voice, heavy and threatening.|$|E
60|$|Both {{strained}} {{their ears}} and soon <b>heard</b> <b>another</b> cry. This {{time it was}} much closer.|$|E
60|$|Annis hesitated, {{waiting to}} hear another voice, but in vain. She fancied that she <b>heard</b> <b>another</b> person breathing, but that was all.|$|E
60|$|Independence Day dawned {{bright and}} clear and {{throughout}} the town of Fairview there was the usual amount of noise. During the morning Snap <b>heard</b> from <b>another</b> lad how Ham and Carl were boasting of their fireworks.|$|R
6000|$|He knew no {{more than}} that, but he had heard that the omnibuses had just come in. Could it be {{possible}} that Mahmoud al Ackbar had <b>heard</b> of <b>another</b> old acquaintance, and had gone to welcome him also? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I did; and I had <b>heard</b> that <b>another</b> {{officer had}} been found, temporarily, to supply his place. Still, I should presume, that, on reflection, {{you will not}} think it {{remarkable}} I am amazed in finding who this person is." ...|$|R
60|$|She {{was almost}} upon the birches when she <b>heard</b> <b>another</b> beat of hoofs {{in front of}} her now, and she sent up a breathless cry.|$|E
6000|$|I <b>heard</b> <b>another</b> movement, as if poor Searle had {{collapsed}} in his chair. [...] "Upon my word, sir, you're quite inconceivable. You never got my letter?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{suppose it}} would be," [...] Desmond agreed, [...] "though, for my part, I should be heartily glad if I never <b>heard</b> <b>another</b> word about it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "In {{that case}} we must forgive you," [...] the girl said. [...] "Some rumours of the fray have reached us, {{and my father}} shook his head gravely, when he <b>heard</b> that <b>another</b> Baird {{had been killed by}} the Forsters." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{have you}} <b>heard</b> that <b>another</b> ship called the Flora, {{travelling}} from the Cape I know not whither, was lost on this coast {{in the same}} month of the following year, and that {{a few of her}} passengers escaped?" ...|$|R
60|$|Every {{time that}} she <b>heard</b> of <b>another</b> misdeed of her husband's she {{secretly}} went to repair the evil, which caused her name to be blessed throughout the whole country-side. This Countess was adored {{as much as the}} Count was hated.|$|R
60|$|He stopped speaking, for as {{he spoke}} they <b>heard</b> <b>another</b> gunshot from the woods {{between them and the}} river. Then came a call that sounded {{somewhat}} familiar.|$|E
60|$|The poets proceeded, wrapt in thought, {{till they}} <b>heard</b> <b>another</b> {{voice of a}} nature that made Dante start and shake {{as if he had}} been some paltry hackney.|$|E
6000|$|Then he <b>heard</b> <b>another</b> noise, {{and snow}} and rocks {{and a broken}} pine rolled down the gully. The {{avalanche}} vanished, the uproar sank, and Deering gasped, [...] "Hold fast!" ...|$|E
60|$|He did {{not make}} any reply, but turned away homeward: I never <b>heard</b> him speak <b>another</b> word.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{must fight}} valiant against the feeling, since he's <b>another's.</b> And I've <b>heard</b> that <b>another</b> {{good thing for}} it, when it afflicts volupshious widows, {{is to go to}} your husband's grave in the dusk of evening, and stand a long while a-bowed down." ...|$|R
50|$|It is {{determined}} that the scream they <b>heard</b> came from <b>another</b> police officer, who was also escorting Harding.|$|R
