500|$|North American Philips Corporation built a [...] {{plant at}} 100 Providence Pike, North Smithfield, Rhode Island (Slatersville) on a [...] plot in 1959. The 15-acre {{property}} is {{recorded by the}} Town of North Smithfield Tax Assessor as Lot No. 60 on Plat No. 4, and Lot No. 385 on Plat No. 5. There are five buildings located on the property. The property is bordered to the north by Industrial Drive; to the south by Comstock Road, to the east by a grassy area; and to the west by Providence Pike. The plant was operated by one of Philips' fully owned subsidiaries, Amperex Electronics, to supply IBM, one of Philips' largest customers, with high speed, gold-doped germanium logic diodes. Millions of these diodes were manufactured at the Slatersville plant every year. With the advent of silicon diodes in 1962 there was a <b>decreasing</b> <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> these germanium diodes, so Philips transferred their germanium Post Alloy Diffused Transistor (PADT) manufacturing to Slatersville {{to take advantage of}} the site's capacity.|$|E
