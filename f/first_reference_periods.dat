In this study, we aimed to assess the relationship between serum c-reactive protein (CRP) and StD time after STEMI. Methods: 436 of the patients admitted to our center with STEMI between August 2012 -February 2013 (338 male, mean age, 63. 9 ± 12. 8) were included in this observational cohort study. Blood samples were obtained from laboratory results of the <b>first</b> <b>reference</b> <b>period.</b> Patients were divided into four groups according to the duration of StD time [0 - 1. hour; group 1 (G 1), 1 - 3. hour; group 2 (G 2), 3 - 6. hour; group 3 (G 3), 6 - 12. hour; group 4 (G 4) ]. Statistical analysis was performed via chi-squre test, ANOVA test, Pearson correlation analysis and ROC analysis. Results: As the time progressed, an increase in CRP levels was observed. The difference among the means of the G 1 -G 3 (p= 0. 002), G 1 -G 4 (p< 0. 001), G 2 -G 4 (p< 0. 001) and G 3 -G 4 (p< 0. 001) groups was found to be statistically significant. There was a good correlation between the StD time and CRP levels (r= 0. 676). Receiver operator charecteristic (ROC) analysis of the predictive value of CRP for the third hour was determined as 0. 78 mg/dL, respectively (AUC was 0. 824; 95 % C.

The selected flocculant was a cationic organic polyelectrolyte, based on polyacrylamide: the PRAESTOL K 233 L by Stockhausen GmbH. A 15 litres stirred reactor was fed once a day with flocculated activated sludge originated from a large full-scale wastewater treatment plant. After a <b>first</b> trial (<b>reference</b> <b>period),</b> where only activated sludge fed the reactor, the activated sludge was then conditioned with increasing amounts of the cationic polymer dosed at 5, 15 and 30 g per kg of sludge (dry weight). The performances of the reactor were then studied in terms of biogas production, volatile matter removal and parameters indicating the process stability (pH, alkalinity, biogas composition). These were compared to the results obtained in the <b>reference</b> <b>period.</b> The digester worked in the mesophilic range of temperature (35 – 37 °C) with a hydraulic retention time of 20 days and an organic loading rate of some 1 kgVS/m 3 reactor per day. These were chosen as typical operational conditions for anaerobic digesters working with waste activated sludge. The experimental set up enabled to observe that the addition of the cationic flocculant did not affect the digester performances in terms of biogas production, the specific biogas production was 0. 15 – 0. 23 l/gVSfed in all the tested conditions, and that the flocculant was partially biodegradable. Also kinetic studies confirmed this situation and a value of the first order reaction kinetic constant, K, equal to some 0. 10 day- 1 was observed, no matter the flocculant concentration. On the other hand, the presence of the typical functional groups of the flocculant was observed in the digester supernatants by spectro-photometric analysis. This topic should be more investigated in future studies to verify the final fate of persistent organic pollutants like polyacrilamide or polyacrylate...|$|R

40|$|This study aims to {{understand}} how different <b>reference</b> <b>periods</b> (i. e., calibration periods) of climate data used to estimate drought indices influence regional drought assessments. Specifically, we investigate the influences of different <b>reference</b> <b>periods</b> on historical drought characteristics, such as the trend, frequency, intensity and spatial extent, using the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) with a 12 -month lag (SPEI- 12), which was estimated from the datasets of the Climate Research Unit (CRU) and the University of Delaware (UDEL). For the 1901 – 1957 (P 1) and 1958 – 2014 (P 2) estimation periods, three different types of <b>reference</b> <b>periods</b> are used to compute the SPEI: P 1 and P 2 together, P 1 and P 2 separately and P 1 only.

The <b>reference</b> <b>period</b> influenced the assessment of drought characteristics, particularly the severity and spatial extent, whereas the influence on the frequency was relatively small. Finally, self-calibration, which is the most common practice for indices such as the SPEI, tends to underestimate the drought severity and spatial extent relative to the other approaches used in this study. Although the conclusions drawn in this study are limited by the use of two global datasets, they highlight the need for clarification of the <b>reference</b> <b>period</b> in drought assessments to better understand regional drought characteristics and the associated temporal changes, particularly under climate change scenarios...|$|R

40|$|The European Union (EU) and {{its legal}} system have {{traditionally}} {{been at the forefront}} of the fight against anthropogenic climate change at the global level. This is particularly true today, when the international community is facing one of the most difficult passages of all times in this respect, due to the well-known difficulty in agreeing on a binding legal text to be applied once the <b>first</b> <b>reference</b> <b>period</b> established by the Kyoto Protocol will expire at the end of this year. The above stalemate has caused individual States to resort to unilateralism, a move that in itself represents a regression from the Kyoto regime, whose main merit had been the creation of a common (although differentiated) legal framework consisting, inter alia, of a series of provisions requiring contracting parties to limit their emissions of certain greenhouse gases from a defined range of human activities over a given period of time. The paper aims at focusing on the European way to unilateralism as represented, for example, by the so-called “effort sharing decision” of 2009 (406 / 2009 /EC of 23 April 2009), pursuant to which, on the one hand, the emission reduction objectives imposed on EU Member States have been increased whilst, on the other hand, the scope of application of such objectives has been widened so as to include more climate-adverse substances and a greater number of economic activities, comprising for the first time a series of “small” emitters. With an even more recent move, EU climate law appears to have taken an extraterritorial turn too. Reference has especially to be made to the “clean skies” judgment rendered by the European Court of Justice on 21 December 2011 (case C- 366 / 10), whereby – albeit without explicitly mentioning the extraterritorial implications of its ruling – the Court has confirmed the applicability of the European emission trading scheme to the international operations of North American air carriers when they have European airports as points of arrival or departure of their flights. The paper will conclude that, since in today’s globalized world Europe remains an important player, both politically and economically, a mixture of unilateral and extraterritorial measures, such as the ones briefly described above, may have an important role to play, not only in bringing climate change negotiations back on track, but also as a platform towards the establishment of new international standards to be agreed by Europe’s major strategic and commercial partners, in Asia as well as in North and South America. Of course, unilateral and extraterritorial actions by themselves will never be sufficient to achieve such a goal, and a wide range of arguments (including trade-related ones) will have to be tabled and discussed to that effect. The experience shows, however, that in the past Europe has been able to promote the development of global standards in areas such as the preservation of the marine environment and the protection of the ozone layer also by providing autonomous solutions that have prompted, in turn, the adoption of appropriate international accords. * Associate Professor of International Law, University of Genoa Faculty o Law (Italy); Dott.

Mean OHIP- 14 severity scores were slightly higher when the RP- 12 questionnaire was administered first, but mean ΔRP values were below the value of 2. 5 considered clinically meaningful, and all 95 % confidence intervals for ΔRP included zero.
