5|$|The {{coming of}} winter {{improved}} the water situation for some who {{had access to}} icicles, but the cold made living conditions worse. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> those in hiding to build fires to warm themselves, as smoke could reveal their location to the Germans. As a consequence, many died of cold.|$|E
5|$|As Griffith stopped portraying {{some of the}} sheriff's more unsophisticated {{character}} traits and mannerisms, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> him to create his own problems and troubles {{in the manner of}} other central sitcom characters such as Lucy in I Love Lucy or Archie Bunker in All in the Family, whose problems were the result of their temperaments, philosophies and attitudes. Consequently, the characters around Taylor were employed to create the problems and troubles, with rock-solid Taylor stepping in as problem solver, mediator, advisor, disciplinarian and counselor.|$|E

Without knowing the correct time, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> them to calculate their longitude and thus navigate their way accurately to Franz Josef Land. They restarted the watches {{on the basis of}} Nansen's guess that they were at longitude 86°E, but from then on were uncertain of their true position.|$|E

5|$|In later years, because <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> parishioners {{to travel}} to Llanbadarn Fawr from the more distant parts of the parish, the church {{eventually}} had many chapels of ease, as {{the population of the}} parish grew. One example of the latter is All Saints Church, Llangorwen, which was built in the early 1840s. In the course of the nineteenth century the original parish of Llanbadarn Fawr was finally divided into some 17 new parishes, comprising 20 churches.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} days of Dunedin, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> a dray to reach the Caversham Valley in wet weather unless it went by a {{circuitous}} route around the hills. Valpy solved this problem by hiring men at his own expense to build a crude road from the southern end of Princes Street to his farm at Forbury. This formed the basis for later roads into the suburb. The road curved {{around the edge of the}} hills at the Glen to avoid a large swamp, the site of which is currently occupied by Carisbrook sports ground.|$|E

Getting the tapes out of Iraq proved difficult for Winter and O'Mahoney, who remained in the UK. They had to rely on journalists from many news agencies, especially those in the BBC News's Baghdad Bureau high-risk team, to smuggle the tapes out of Iraq. When curfews were enforced, weeks passed before the producers received new footage because <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> anybody to leave their homes or the country.|$|E

5|$|Having {{been delayed}} several times by poor weather, Operation Cobra {{commenced}} on 25 July, with a concentrated aerial bombardment {{from thousands of}} Allied aircraft. Supporting offensives had drawn the bulk of German armored reserves toward the British and Canadian sector and coupled with the general lack of men and materiel available to the Germans, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> them to form successive lines of defense. Units of the U. S. VII Corps led the initial two-division assault, while other First Army corps mounted supporting attacks designed to pin German units in place. Progress was slow {{on the first day}} but opposition started to crumble once the defensive crust had been broken. By 27 July, most organized resistance had been overcome and the VII and VIII Corps advanced rapidly, isolating the Cotentin peninsula.|$|E
5|$|Katsufumi Sato, a Japanese scientist, did {{calculations}} using modern {{birds and}} concluded that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> a pterosaur to stay aloft. In the book Posture, Locomotion, and Paleoecology of Pterosaurs it is theorized {{that they were able}} to fly due to the oxygen-rich, dense atmosphere of the Late Cretaceous period. However, both Sato and the authors of Posture, Locomotion, and Paleoecology of Pterosaurs based their research on the now outdated theories of pterosaurs being seabird-like, and the size limit does not apply to terrestrial pterosaurs, such as azhdarchids and tapejarids. Furthermore, Darren Naish concluded that atmospheric differences between the present and the Mesozoic were not needed for the giant size of pterosaurs.|$|E
5|$|Spurred by the crisis, on 1 April 286, Maximian took up {{the title}} of Augustus. His {{appointment}} is unusual in that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> Diocletian to have been present to witness the event. It has even been suggested that Maximian usurped the title and was only later recognized by Diocletian in hopes of avoiding civil war. This suggestion is unpopular, as {{it is clear that}} Diocletian meant for Maximian to act {{with a certain amount of}} independence. It may be posited, however, that Diocletian felt the need to bind Maximian closer to him, by making him his empowered associate, in order to avoid the possibility of having him striking some sort of deal with Carausius.|$|E

5|$|Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) and {{her mother}} visit her brother Bill and his {{pregnant}} wife Tara around Christmas time. Scully answers the phone, and {{the person on the}} other line, who sounds just like her dead sister Melissa, tells her that someone needs her help. Scully traces the call to a nearby home in San Diego where a group of cops are investigating the suicide of a woman, Roberta Sim. The lead detective, Kresge, tells Scully that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> Roberta to have dialed, as she died before the telephone call was made. That night after dinner Scully reveals to her mother that due to her abduction and cancer she is unable to bear children. Scully flashes back to when as a child, she hid her pet rabbit from her brother in a lunchbox, only for it to suffocate and die. Scully receives another telephone call from the same person on her cell phone, which was once again made from the Sim home. Roberta's husband, Marshall, is meeting with two dark-suited men inside his house and has no desire to listen to and help Scully figure out what is going on.|$|E
5|$|After trying {{that for}} a while and with no land in sight, Taylor decided that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> them to fly so far west and not reach Florida. He {{believed}} that he might have been near the Key West Islands. What followed was a series of serious confusions between Taylor, his team and the control tower. Taylor was not sure whether he was near Bahama or Key West, and he was not sure which direction was which due to compass malfunction. The control tower informed Taylor that he could not be in Key West since the wind that day did not blow that way. Some of his teammates believed that their compass was working. Taylor then set a course northeast according to their compass, which should take them to Florida if they were in Key West. When that failed, Taylor set a course west according to their compass, which should take them to Florida if they were in Bahama. If Taylor stayed this course he would have reached land before running out of fuel. However, at some point Taylor decided that he had tried going west enough. He then once again set a course northeast, thinking they were near Key West after all. Finally, his flight ran out of fuel and may have crashed into the ocean somewhere north of Abaco Island and east of Florida.|$|E
5|$|From September 1610, Galileo {{observed}} that Venus exhibited {{a full set}} of phases {{similar to that of the}} Moon. The heliocentric model of the solar system developed by Nicolaus Copernicus predicted that all phases would be visible since the orbit of Venus around the Sun would cause its illuminated hemisphere to face the Earth when it was on the opposite side of the Sun and to face away from the Earth when it was on the Earth-side of the Sun. On the other hand, in Ptolemy's geocentric model <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> any of the planets' orbits to intersect the spherical shell carrying the Sun. Traditionally, the orbit of Venus was placed entirely on the near side of the Sun, where it could exhibit only crescent and new phases. It was, however, also possible to place it entirely on the far side of the Sun, where it could exhibit only gibbous and full phases. After Galileo's telescopic observations of the crescent, gibbous and full phases of Venus, therefore, this Ptolemaic model became untenable. Thus in the early 17th century, as a result of his discovery, the great majority of astronomers converted to one of the various geo-heliocentric planetary models, such as the Tychonic, Capellan and Extended Capellan models, each either with or without a daily rotating Earth. These all had the virtue of explaining the phases of Venus without the vice of the 'refutation' of full heliocentrism's prediction of stellar parallax. Galileo's discovery of the phases of Venus was thus arguably his most empirically practically influential contribution to the two-stage transition from full geocentrism to full heliocentrism via geo-heliocentrism.|$|E

5|$|On several {{occasions}} {{over the course}} of the trial, the prosecution showed films of the concentration camps and other atrocities. Everyone present, including Göring, found the contents of the films shocking; he said that the films must have been faked. Witnesses, including Paul Koerner and Erhard Milch, tried to portray Göring as a peaceful moderate. Milch stated it had been impossible to oppose Hitler or disobey his orders; to do so would likely have meant death for oneself and one's family. When testifying on his own behalf, Göring emphasised his loyalty to Hitler, and claimed to know nothing about what had happened in the concentration camps, which were under Himmler's control. He gave evasive, convoluted answers to direct questions and had plausible excuses for all his actions during the war. He used the witness stand as a venue to expound at great length on his own role in the Reich, attempting to present himself as a peacemaker and diplomat before the outbreak of the war. During cross-examination, chief prosecutor Robert H. Jackson read out the minutes of a meeting that had been held shortly after Kristallnacht, a major pogrom in November 1938. At the meeting, Göring had plotted to confiscate Jewish property in the wake of the pogrom. Later, David Maxwell-Fyfe proved <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> Göring not to have known about the Stalag Luft III murdersthe shooting of fifty airmen who had been recaptured after escaping from Stalag Luft IIIin time to have prevented the killings. He also presented clear evidence that Göring knew about the extermination of the Hungarian Jews.|$|E
