40|$|This study {{presents}} a detailed {{examination of the}} solar hard X-ray and gamma-ray flare of 1980 June 7 as seen by the Hard X-Ray Burst Spectrometer on SMM. The hard X-ray profile is most unusual {{in that it is}} characterized by an initial pulse train of seven intense hard X-ray spikes. However, the event is unique among the 6300 events observed by HXRBS in that the temporal signature of this pulse train recurs twice during the flare. Examinations of the hard X-ray data in conjunction with radio and gamma-ray observations show that the 28 - 480 keV X-ray emission is simultaneous with the 17 GHz microwave fluxes within 128 ms and that the 3. 5 - 6. 5 MeV prompt gamma-ray line emission is coincident with secondary maxima of the microwave and X-ray fluxes. Although the absence of spatially resolved hard X-ray observations leaves other possibilities open, a parameterization of the event as a set of seven sequentially <b>firing</b> <b>loops</b> is presented that offers many satisfying explanations of the observations...|$|E

The hard X-ray data of the events are also compared with the radio microwave fluxes. The X-ray time profiles of these flares are characterized by the occurrence of impulsive phase superposed with a number of narrow spikes before the occurrence of the main energetic events. Studies of the temporal and spectral properties of these events indicated a quasi-oscillatory nature of the sources. Various models for explaining the evolution of the events are considered and the sequential <b>firing</b> <b>loop</b> model seems to be consistent with the observations of the events...|$|R

40|$|This thesis aims to test {{if there}} is a {{connection}} between modern day fully automatic rifles rate of <b>fire,</b> used <b>loop</b> length in implementation and experienced realism in a first-person shooter game in first-person, fired by the players own character. With a background consisting of papers, books and lectures/conferences given by experienced people and other experts in the game industry regarding first person shooter games, a listening test was conducted and carried out on a computer using headphones with both trained and untrained subjects since players can be both. A simple firing-range was constructed in Unreal Engine 4 (Epic Games, 2017) where the subjects could switch between two weapons with different rates of fire and three versions of each with different loop lengths, 4, 8 and 16. The sounds were divided into layers, e. g. body, mechanical and bottom, played back using looping as implementation. The subjects were also asked to rate the sounds regarding gameplay and preference to see if the results would differ between the three categories. The results showed a tendency to choose the longer loop for all categories, but only four comparisons gave a significant result when doing t-tests...|$|R

40|$|Calcium looping CO 2 capture is a {{promising}} technology to reduce CO 2 emissions from cement production. Coal {{is generally considered}} the fuel used to drive the calcium looping process as coal is already used as feedstock for cement production. This study assesses the impact of different fuels (coal, natural gas and woody biomass) on the technological and environmental performance of post-combustion calcium looping at a cement plant in North-western Europe. Process modelling is {{used to determine the}} impact of the different fuels on the mass and energy balance of the process. Life cycle assessment is carried out to evaluate the environmental performance of the different systems. Results indicate that firing natural gas or biomass instead of coal in an add-on calcium looping process can improve the efficiency of the process, as it decreases the fuel, limestone and electricity consumption. Consequently, while coal <b>fired</b> calcium <b>looping</b> can reduce life cycle climate change potential by 92 %, the use of natural gas or biomass can make the process carbon neutral (reduction of 100 %) or negative (- 169 %), respectively. Further research is required to complete the environmental perspective of using alternative fuels, but these results already illustrate a potential low-hanging fruit to improve the environmental performance of post combustion calcium looping in the cement industry...|$|R
40|$|This review synthesizes {{evidence}} that altered fire frequency drives discontinuous ecosystem transitions from mesic grasslands to shrublands or woodlands in the Central Great Plains, USA. Long-term fire manipulations reveal that grassland to shrubland transitions are triggered when fire-free intervals increase from 1 – 3 years to ≥ 3 – 8 years, and longer fire returns (~ 10 years or more) result in transitions to woodlands. Grazing and soil properties alter these fire thresholds. Grassland to shrubland transitions are abrupt and exhibit nonlinear relationships between driver and state variables. Transitions to shrublands and woodlands exhibit hysteresis, where reintroducing frequent fires does not reverse transitions in management-relevant time-scales (decades). Nonlinear transitions and hysteresis emerge because grasses generate positive feedbacks with fire that create strong demographic barriers for shrub and tree establishment. Fire-free intervals allow shrubs and trees {{to reach a}} size sufficient to survive fire, reproduce and disrupt the <b>fire</b> feedback <b>loop</b> through competition. Synthesis: Mesic grasslands, shrublands and woodlands constitute self-reinforcing states (alternative attractors) separated by critical fire frequency thresholds. Even without major shifts in climate, altered fire frequency can produce dramatic state changes, highlighting the importance of fire for predicting future ecosystem states. Local management should focus on prevention of unwanted transitions rather than post hoc restoration...|$|R
50|$|The {{struggle}} between a pluralistic African-American culture and an intolerant white culture {{is central to}} the novel. Loop Garoo, the impromptu spell-casting Hoodoo houngan, diametrically opposes the bigoted Drag Gibson. The conflict between these two men and the forces they represent leads to direct, racist violence. Drag Gibson sets <b>fire</b> to <b>Loop</b> Garoo's circus, killing his associates and forcing him to flee into the desert. He then hires the genocidal John Wesley Hardin to finish Loop Garoo off. Hardin symbolizes the racist tendencies of the Old West; he sees African Americans as the devil incarnate and slaughters them without mercy. The Loop Garoo Kid responds to Drag's violence by calling on a diverse array of resources, unleashing the power of nature and the innumerable hexes and spells of the Hoodoo religion on Gibson and his cronies. Drag is quickly overwhelmed by the forces assembled against him, and not even Pope Innocent can save him from Loop Garoo. Reed argues that the transparent violence employed by white society is no match for the diversity and adaptability of African-American religion and culture. Reed also comments on the ethnocidal history of the Western Expansion. Chief Showcase's poetry bitterly reflects the atrocities committed against Native Americans by white imperialists, and Showcase sardonically jeers at the promises of white leaders.|$|R
40|$|A G-RAC attitude-control {{algorithm}} {{is used to}} minimize maneuver execution error in a spacecraft with a flexible appendage when said spacecraft must induce translational momentum by <b>firing</b> (in open <b>loop)</b> large thrusters along a desired direction for a given period of time. The controller is dynamic with two integrators and requires measurement of only the angular position and velocity of the spacecraft. The global stability of the closed-loop system is guaranteed without having access to the states describing {{the dynamics of the}} appendage and with severe saturation in the available torque. Spacecraft apply open-loop thruster firings to induce a desired translational momentum with an extended appendage. This control algorithm will assist this maneuver by stabilizing the attitude dynamics around a desired orientation, and consequently minimize the maneuver execution errors...|$|R
5000|$|Generally speaking, the {{property}} {{is divided into two}} areas—the arboretum and the natural area. The arboretum features formal and informal plant collections and various modern facilities, including handicapped accessible restrooms. Other arboretum features include numerous walking paths; a visitors' center, cafe, and gift shop; education center; a newly renovated children's play area and an inter-generational shelter, The Grisby Shelter, and four lakes. The natural area contains most of Bernheim's hiking trails, and is primarily a beech-maple forest with access via paved roads. There are over 35 miles (56.3 km) of hiking trails and scenic fire-roads, including the 13.3 mile (21.4 km) Millennium Trail and the 3.2 mile (5.1 km) paved Hike-Bike Pike. One short trail, the aptly named <b>Fire</b> Tower <b>Loop,</b> leads to a metal observation tower that is often open to climb via stairs. There is also a canopy walk which extends off a cliff and places the viewer above the trees and sharing a wonderful vista. Hiking trails range in difficulty from [...] "casual" [...] short walks to strenuous jaunts designed for [...] "the more serious hiker," [...] per Bernheim's website. [...] The Millennium Trail is by far the longest and most challenging; as a result Bernheim asks that hikers set out before certain times in the morning (the deadline varies by season), as well as register at the visitor's center prior to starting the hike. In 2005, a hiker died of a heat stroke while attempting to complete the Millennium Trail.|$|R
40|$|Using RHESSI {{and some}} {{auxiliary}} observations we examine possible connections between {{spatial and temporal}} morphology {{of the sources of}} non-thermal hard X-ray (HXR) emission which revealed minute quasi-periodic pulsations (QPPs) during the two-ribbon flares on 2003 May 29 and 2005 January 19. Microwave emission also reveals the same quasi-periodicity. The sources of non-thermal HXR emission are situated mainly inside the footpoints of the flare arcade loops observed by the TRACE and SOHO instruments. At least one of the sources moves systematically both during the QPP-phase and after it in each flare that allows to examine the sources velocities and the energy release rate via the process of magnetic reconnection. The sources move predominantly parallel to the magnetic inversion line or the appropriate flare ribbon during the QPP-phase whereas the movement slightly changes to more perpendicular regime after the QPPs. Each QPP is emitted from its own position. It is also seen that the velocity and the energy release rate don't correlate well with the flux of the HXR emission calculated from the sources. The sources of microwaves and thermal HXRs are situated near the apex of the loop arcade and are not stationary either. Almost all QPPs and some spikes of HXR emission during the post-QPP-phase reveal the soft-hard-soft spectral behavior indicating separate acts of electrons acceleration and injection, rather than modulation of emission flux by some kinds of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) oscillations of coronal loops. In all likelihood, the flare scenarios based on the successively <b>firing</b> arcade <b>loops</b> are more preferable to interpret the observations, although we can not conclude exactly what mechanism forces these loops to flare up.

40|$|Since {{the end of}} {{frequency}} scaling, the programming languages community has started to embrace multi-core and even distributed systems. One paradigm that lends itself well to distribution is stream processing. In stream processing, an application consists of a directed graph of streams and operators, where streams are infinite sequences of data items, and operators <b>fire</b> in infinite <b>loops</b> to process data. This model directly exposes parallelism, requires no shared memory, and is a good match for several emerging application domains. Unfortunately, streaming languages have so far been lacking in abstraction. This paper introduces higher-order composite operators, which encapsulate stream subgraphs, and contracts, which specify pre- and post-conditions for composites. Composites are expanded at compile time, {{in a manner similar}} to macros. Their contractual obligations are also checked at compile-time. We build on existing work on macros and contracts to implement higherorder composites. The user-visible language features provide a consistent look-and-feel for the streaming language, whereas the underlying implementation provides high-quality static error messages and prevents accidental name capture...|$|R
40|$|The Graz Cycle, a {{hydrogen}} oxygen <b>fired</b> double <b>loop</b> high temperature steam cycle, combining gas turbine philosophy with steam plant praxis, {{can be adapted}} for combustion of methane with oxygen. The resulting combustion products carbon dioxide and hydrogen oxide, i. e. high temperature steam, are mixed with cooling steam and expanded to lowest pressure and temperature. By condensing the steam, separation of {{carbon dioxide in the}} condenser can be effected, which is then recompressed in an isothermal compresser and is presented at system boundaries at ambient temperature and ambient pressure for storage or further reintegration into a solar hydrogen fuel cycle. The paper presents the cycle, its thermodynamic and flow conditions, and design deliberations concerning the major components especially the methane oxygen combustion chamber and the high temperature turbine. Methods of cooling the very high temperature blades are studied, the general dimensions of turbomachinery for a typical pilot plant are given. The development of such a pilot plant would allow the application for carbon dioxide (CO 2) retention by deep sea storage or by use in chemical industry. Such a pilot plant could demonstrate the feasibility of CO 2 retention, a means of CO 2 emission reduction, an environmental goal to which many governments have devoted themselves. In the farther future, after the establishment of a world wide solar energy system creating artificial fuels like liquid methane to be transported {{in the same way as}} liquid natural gas (LNG) today, such a plant would work as the means of effective reuse of these artificial fuels. CO 2 would be transported back to the solar sites as an essential component in the production of the artificial fuels created there, thus closing the fuel cycle. ...|$|R

60|$|It {{has been}} said that the Hurons did not observe the sudden {{disappearance}} of Hurry. In his present situation he was not only hid from view by the platform, but, as the Ark drew slowly ahead, impelled by a sail that was now filled, he received the same friendly service from the piles. The Hurons, indeed, were too intent on endeavoring to slay their Delaware foe, by sending a bullet through some one of the loops or crevices of the cabin, to bethink them at all of one whom they fancied so thoroughly tied. Their great concern was {{the manner in which the}} Ark rubbed past the piles, although its motion was lessened at least one half by the friction, and they passed into the northern end of the castle in order to catch opportunities of <b>firing</b> through the <b>loops</b> of that part of the building. Chingachgook was similarly occupied, and remained as ignorant as his enemies of the situation of Hurry. As the Ark grated along the rifles sent their little clouds of smoke from one cover to the other, but the eyes and movements of the opposing parties were too quick to permit any injury to be done. At length one side had the mortification and the other the pleasure of seeing the scow swing clear of the piles altogether, when it immediately moved away, with a materially accelerated motion, towards the north.|$|R
60|$|Captain Willoughby now {{returned}} to his people, and he was some time busied in examining the gates, and giving directions about its fastenings. Utterly forgetful of her own situation, Maud shed tears of joy, as she saw that this great object was successfully effected. The stockade was an immense security {{to the people of}} the Hut. Although it certainly might be scaled, such an enterprise would require great caution, courage, and address; and it could hardly be effected, at all, by daylight. At night, even, it would allow the sentinels time to give the alarm, and with a vigilant look-out, might be the means of repelling an enemy. There was also another consideration connected with this stockade. An enemy would not be fond of trusting himself inside of it, unless reasonably certain of carrying the citadel altogether; inasmuch as it might serve as a prison to place him in the hands of the garrison. To recross it under a <b>fire</b> from the <b>loops,</b> would be an exploit so hazardous that few Indians would think of undertaking it. All this Maud knew from her father's conversations, and she saw how much had been obtained in raising the gates. Then the stockade, once properly closed, afforded great security to those moving about within it; the timbers would be apt to stop a bullet, and were a perfect defence against a rush; leaving time to the women and children to get into the court, even allowing that the assailants succeeded in scaling the palisades.|$|R
50|$|The Cougars were inhospitable hosts to Drake {{and played}} a game of almost total {{dominance}} {{en route to a}} 4-0 shellacking. Five minutes into the game, Bilyeu took a pass from Kendall-Moullin and <b>fired</b> a high, <b>looping</b> shot from 35 yards out that sank into the top right corner of the net over the Bulldog keeper's reaching hands. On a corner kick in the 37th minute, Drake's keeper turned awy the ball, but Polster found the rebound 4 yards out and buried it, giving SIUE a two-goal lead. Four minutes later, Volesky took a long pass in the open, juked the keeper, then passed off to an even more open Christianson, who put the Cougars up 3-0 {{for the first time in}} the season. Drake managed to fire off two shots that were high and wide late in the half, and the home squad went to the locker room up by three after outshooting the Bulldogs 7-2. The domination continues in the second half as the Cougars outshot the visitors 8-0 while eight subs saw action. In the 59th minute, Volesky drove into the box, stumbled and fell, picked himself up, regained the ball, and scored his MVC leading seventh goal of the season. That goal gave SIUE, now 4-0-0 in MVC games, its widest margin of victory in a conference game since joining the league in 2010. The Cougar win, combined with the Missouri State draw at Loyola, extended their lead in the Valley standings to five points.|$|R

We examined plant communities, soils, and soil seed banks {{two years after the}} 2005 <b>Loop</b> <b>Fire,</b> located in a creosote-blackbrush community in Red Rock Canyon National Conservation Area in southern Nevada’s Mojave Desert. Based on a spring sampling of 20, 0. 01 -ha plots, live + dead cover of the exotic annual Bromus rubens averaged nine times lower on the burn than on a paired unburned area. Perennial species composition shifted from dominance by late-successional native shrubs (e. g., Coleogyne ramosissima) on the unburned area, to dominance by native perennial forbs (e. g., Sphaeralcea ambigua, Baileya multiradiata) on the burn. Species richness of live plants averaged 26 % (100 m 2 scale) and 239 % (1 m 2 scale) greater on the burn compared to the unburned area. Only 5 % of Larrea tridentata individuals resprouted, compared to 64 % of Yucca schidigera and baccata. Fire and microsite (interspace, below L. tridentata, or below Yucca) interacted to affect several 0 – 5 cm soil properties, with higher pH, conductivity, and total P and K on burned Yucca microsites. Bromus rubens density in 0 – 5 cm soil seed banks was four times lower on the burn, and its distribution among microsites reversed. Below-shrub microsites contained the most B. rubens seeds on the unburned area, but the least on the burned area. Intense fire below shrubs may have increased seed mortality, an idea supported by. 3 -fold decreases we found in emergence density after heating seed bank samples to 100 uC. Our study occurred after a post-fire period of below-average precipitation, underscoring a need for longer term monitoring that characterizes moister years...|$|R
