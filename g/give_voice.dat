25|$|A common {{misconception}} is that Bloodhounds {{are employed}} in packs; while this is sometimes the case in Britain, where foxhound blood is mixed into them to increase speed, in North America, Bloodhounds are used as solitary trackers. When {{they are on a}} trail, they are usually silent and do not <b>give</b> <b>voice</b> as other scenthounds. The original use of the Bloodhound as a leash-hound, to find but not disturb animals, would require silent trailing.|$|E
25|$|Democrats began 1968 {{expecting that}} President Johnson, who was constitutionally {{eligible}} for election {{to a second}} full term under {{the provisions of the}} 22nd Amendment, would again be the party's presidential nominee. Those expectations were shattered by Senator Eugene McCarthy, who had entered the campaign late in November to <b>give</b> <b>voice</b> to those in the party opposed to Johnson's Vietnam policies. McCarthy narrowly lost to Johnson in the first Democratic Party primary on March 12 in New Hampshire, winning 42% of the vote to Johnson's 49%. The results startled the party establishment and spurred Senator Robert F. Kennedy of New York to enter the race. Two weeks later, Johnson told a stunned the nation that he would not seek a second term. In the weeks that followed, much of the momentum that had been moving the McCarthy campaign forward shifted toward Kennedy. This, one of the most tumultuous Democratic primary election seasons in modern times, concluded with Kennedy being assassination on June 4 in Los Angeles, following a rally celebrating his victory in the California primary.|$|E

500|$|Text is {{frequently}} incorporated into comics via speech balloons, captions, and sound effects. [...] Speech balloons indicate dialogue (or thought, {{in the case}} of thought balloons), with tails pointing at their respective speakers. [...] Captions can <b>give</b> <b>voice</b> to a narrator, convey characters' dialogue or thoughts, or indicate place or time. [...] Speech balloons themselves are strongly associated with comics, such that the addition of one to an image is sufficient to turn the image into comics.

Brace describes how, during Cui's Tiananmen performance, students [...] "jumped to their feet and began to sing," [...] a practice that had rarely happened at music performances in China before then. Not long after Tiananmen, Cui was restricted to playing in small venues; he did not play before a large audience in Beijing again until 2005.|$|E

500|$|Sycorax's silent role {{plays an}} {{important}} part in postcolonial interpretations of The Tempest. [...] Because she is native to Algiers and her story is only heard through others (Prospero, Ariel, and Caliban), she is championed by some scholars as a representation of the silenced African woman. Postcolonial authors have also claimed her; for example, Kamau Brathwaite, in his 1994 work Barabajan Poems, includes [...] "Sycorax's book" [...] as a counterpart to [...] "Prospero's book" [...] (mentioned in Act 5 of Shakespeare's play). In an attempt to <b>give</b> <b>voice</b> to unspoken indigenous cultures, Brathwaite's poems outline the history of the Caribbean through Sycorax's eyes. Sycorax is presented as Brathwaite's muse, possessing him and his computer to give full voice to the history of the silenced, who in Brathwaite's philosophy are not only Caribbean natives, but any culture under-represented during the colonial period.|$|E
500|$|A {{total of}} 32 {{characters}} from the Ramayana were voiced in the Geet Ramayan. Madgulkar expressed {{the emotions of}} characters such as Rama, Sita, Hanuman– the monkey (vanara) god and devotee of Rama– and Lakshmana (Rama's brother); he also attempted to <b>give</b> <b>voice</b> to the humblest characters in the epic. The vanara are given a song ("Setū Bāndhā Re Sāgarī") describing a bridge forming over the ocean so Rama and his army could cross to Lanka. The poet noted that the song described the sacrifice of joint labour and {{was an example of}} the principle, [...] "Union is strength". Nishadraj Guha (King of Kevati, kingdom located by the banks of Ganges river) and the boatmen who helped Rama in crossing the Ganges river expressed themselves in [...] "Nakos Nauke Parat Phirū". The author of the Ramayana, Valmiki, was also given a song (the final song, [...] "Gā Bāḷāno, Shrīrāmāyaṇ") with his advice to Rama's sons Kusha and Lava before they appear before Rama.|$|E
500|$|Anderson's {{third and}} {{favourite}} novel {{was her only}} work of historical fiction, The Commandant, published in 1975. Based {{on the story of}} the murder of the infamously brutal penal Commandant, Captain Patrick Logan, which Anderson had initially heard recounted in her childhood, the story is given a [...] "new, partly feminist perspective in that it is centred on the experience of Logan's young sister-in-law." [...] Seventeen-year-old Frances O'Beirne, Letty Logan's sister, travels from Ireland to Moreton Bay Penal Settlement in 1830 to visit her sister. Although Frances is an invented character, most of the other characters are, in fact, based on accounts of real people from Anderson's extensive primary research. She created Frances to <b>give</b> <b>voice</b> to her own narrative commentary. Anderson once playfully likened the Moreton Bay social climate to Elizabeth Gaskell's Cranford; Susan Sheridan notes that the likeness is particularly true of the discord between the elegant gentility of the middle-class, and the cruelty of the penal colony.|$|E

They are portrayed in a particularly sympathetic light when they are killed during the ending. Travis Fickett of IGN said, [...] "It's one of those moments where South Park feels the need to <b>give</b> <b>voice</b> to a side the media is ignoring—and points out that things aren't quite as cut and dry [...] as we might like." [...] The episode has also been described as a commentary on the way in which Americans tend to take their relative wealth and comfort for granted. A U.S. Navy SEAL ordering another to [...] "not hit the white ones" [...] has also been described as an indictment of the American approach to foreign policy.|$|E
500|$|Smith {{arrived at}} Hull House {{in the autumn}} of 1890 and shortly after her first visit began to <b>give</b> <b>voice</b> and piano lessons to both {{children}} and adults. Initially free concerts were given on Sunday, both as a means to uplift the community and to highlight the talents of the settlement house teachers and musicians. Between November 1891 and April 1892, there were 22 Sunday concerts held at Hull House before the music school was officially founded. Smith was {{one of the founders of}} Hull House Music School the following year, which became the first settlement music school in the United States. She invited one of her friends from Germany, Amalie Hannig, who had been teaching piano at the Klindworth Conservatory to help her with the school. [...] Hannig taught both piano and voice at the school until 1898. Mary Rozet Smith, one of the benefactors of Hull House provided the funding to establish the school.|$|E
500|$|The early 1890s saw an {{increasing}} use of dialect in Chicago's newspapers, sometimes to mock, but more often to <b>give</b> <b>voice</b> to the immigrant communities that filled Chicago's neighborhoods, and whose worth was being appreciated. By 1892, Dunne, who was still only aged 25, was editorial chairman of the Chicago Evening Post. Its management was marketing (unsuccessfully, as it proved) a smaller-size weekly edition {{to compete with the}} large Sunday papers. Cornelius McAuliff, Dunne's editor, asked him to write a humorous piece for each edition of the new periodical. Accordingly, Dunne wrote for the Sunday Post on December 4, 1892, a piece in Irish dialect called [...] "Frank's Visit to Grover", concerning the efforts of former congressman Frank Lawler to gain appointment as Chicago's postmaster, a political plum to be awarded by the new president, Grover Cleveland. Lawler's visit to New York to see Cleveland is described by another Irishman, Alderman Johnny Powers—Cleveland promises the post (Lawler did not in real life receive it) before Lawler and the president-elect settle down to drinking and playing pool.|$|E

On Maxwell's emergence with Urban Hang Suite, writer Carol Brennan cited him, along with the Fugees, D'Angelo and Tony Rich, as neo soul musicians that [...] "exhibited the identifying characteristics of this new breed of R artists: lyrics that <b>give</b> <b>voice</b> to intense personal expression, creative control over the music, and a unexpectedly successful debut." [...] In his book A Change Is Gonna Come: Music, Race & the Soul of America (2006), Craig Hansen Werner lists Maxwell's Urban Hang Suite as important in neo soul, including it along with R. Kelly's R.

500|$|Gray wolves howl to {{assemble}} the pack (usually before and after hunts), to pass on an alarm (particularly at a den site), to locate each other during a storm or unfamiliar territory and to communicate across great distances. Wolf howls can under certain conditions be heard over areas of up to [...] Wolf howls are generally indistinguishable from those of large dogs. Male wolves <b>give</b> <b>voice</b> through an octave, passing to a deep bass with a stress on [...] "O", while females produce a modulated nasal baritone with stress on [...] "U". Pups almost never howl, while yearling wolves produce howls ending {{in a series of}} dog-like yelps. Howling consists of a fundamental frequency that may lie between 150 and 780Hz, and consists of up to 12 harmonically related overtones. The pitch usually remains constant or varies smoothly, and may change direction as many as four or five times. Howls used for calling pack mates to a kill are long, smooth sounds similar {{to the beginning of the}} cry of a horned owl. When pursuing prey, they emit a higher pitched howl, vibrating on two notes. When closing in on their prey, they emit a combination of a short bark and a howl. When howling together, wolves harmonize rather than chorus on the same note, thus creating the illusion of there being more wolves than there actually are. Lone wolves typically avoid howling in areas where other packs are present. Wolves from different geographic locations may howl in different fashions: the howls of European wolves are much more protracted and melodious than those of North American wolves, whose howls are louder and have a stronger emphasis on the first syllable. The two are however mutually intelligible, as North American wolves have been recorded to respond to European-style howls made by biologists.|$|E
