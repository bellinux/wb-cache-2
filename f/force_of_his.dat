5|$|Just days later, however, on 24 April 1918, Battleship Division Nine {{joined the}} Grand Fleet in one last {{attempt to bring}} the High Seas Fleet to battle. German Admiral Reinhard Scheer, aware of the {{strategic}} potential of destroying a squadron of British battleships, had finally decided to make an attempt on the Scandinavian Convoy, using the overwhelming <b>force</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> entire fleet. Under strict radio silence, the High Seas Fleet sailed {{on the morning of}} 23 April to attempt an intercept, leaving the British completely unaware that they had left their base.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} {{influence}} on events, {{it was more}} than Napoleon's personality that took effect. He reorganized France itself to supply the men and money needed for wars. He inspired his men—Wellington said his presence on the battlefield was worth 40,000 soldiers, for he inspired confidence from privates to field marshals. He also unnerved the enemy. At the Battle of Auerstadt in 1806, King Frederick William III of Prussia outnumbered the French by 63,000 to 27,000; however, when he was told, mistakenly, that Napoleon was in command, he ordered a hasty retreat that turned into a rout. The <b>force</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> personality neutralized material difficulties as his soldiers fought with the confidence that with Napoleon in charge they would surely win.|$|E
5|$|The next day, Gawain {{leaves for}} the Green Chapel with the girdle wound twice around his waist. He finds the Green Knight {{sharpening}} an axe and, as promised, Gawain bends his bared neck to receive his blow. At the first swing Gawain flinches slightly and the Green Knight belittles him for it. Ashamed of himself, Gawain doesn’t flinch {{with the second}} swing; but again the Green Knight withholds the full <b>force</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> blow. The knight explains he was testing Gawain's nerve. Angrily Gawain tells him to deliver his blow and so the knight does, causing only a slight wound on Gawain's neck. The game is over. Gawain seizes his sword, helmet and shield, but the Green Knight, laughing, reveals himself to be {{the lord of the}} castle, Bertilak de Hautdesert, transformed by magic. He explains that the entire adventure was a trick of the 'elderly lady' Gawain saw at the castle, who is actually the sorceress Morgan le Fay, Arthur's sister, who intended to test Arthur's knights and frighten Guinevere to death. Gawain is ashamed to have behaved deceitfully but the Green Knight laughs and professes him the most blameless knight in all the land. The two part on cordial terms. Gawain returns to Camelot wearing the girdle as a token of his failure to keep his promise. The Knights of the Round Table absolve him of blame and decide that henceforth that they will wear a green sash in recognition of Gawain's adventure and as a reminder to be always honest.|$|E

25|$|A {{second opinion}} was sought and {{provided}} a month later by a commission under Professor Dr. Janez Milčinski. The Milčinski team concluded that Martinović could have inserted the bottle by positioning it on a stick, which he had pushed into the earth, but had slipped during masturbation and broke the bottle in his rectum under the <b>force</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> body's weight. The Yugoslav secret police and military intelligence reportedly concluded from this that Martinović's injuries had indeed most likely been self-inflicted.|$|E

25|$|Ögedei was {{considered}} to be his father's favorite son, ever since his childhood. As an adult, he was known for his ability to sway doubters in any debate in which he was involved, simply by the <b>force</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> personality. He was a physically big, jovial, and very charismatic man, who seemed mostly to be interested in enjoying good times. He was intelligent and steady in character. His charisma was partially credited for his success in keeping the Mongol Empire on the path that his father had set.|$|E
25|$|These having led Wellington to {{conclude}} that Napoleon was bringing the main <b>force</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> army to bear against Blücher, he at once proposed to assist him by first advancing straight upon Frasnes and Gosselies, {{as soon as he}} should have concentrated sufficient force, and then operating upon the Napoleon's left and rear, which would afford a powerful diversion in favour of the Prussians, from the circumstance that their right wing was the weakest and most exposed, and considering the object of Napoleon's movement, the one most likely to be attacked.|$|E
25|$|Marshall had charm, humor, a quick intelligence, and {{the ability}} to bring men together. His sincerity and {{presence}} commanded attention. His opinions were workmanlike and not especially eloquent or subtle. His influence on learned men of the law came from the charismatic <b>force</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> personality and his ability to seize upon the key elements of a case and make highly persuasive arguments. Together with his vision of the future greatness of the nation, these qualities are apparent in his historic decisions and gave him the sobriquet, The Great Chief Justice.|$|E

25|$|The <b>force</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> own study, {{translation}} and commentary {{of the texts}} of these traditions initiated {{the development of the}} Faxiang school (法相宗) in East Asia. Although the school itself did not thrive for a long time, its theories regarding perception, consciousness, Karma, rebirth, etc. found their way into the doctrines of other more successful schools. Xuanzang's closest and most eminent student was Kuiji (窺基) who became recognized as the first patriarch of the Faxiang school. Xuanzang's logic, as described by Kuiji, was often misunderstood by scholars of Chinese Buddhism because they lack the necessary background in Indian logic. Another important disciple was the Korean monk Woncheuk.|$|E
25|$|The {{inhabitants}} of Shiraz now faced extremely hardship from the siege, {{and it was}} questionable if {{they were able to}} endure. Large parts of Fars were ravaged by warfare, and for 3–4 years pandemic had spread around the landscape. Albeit Lotf Ali Khan's forces had gone through as much difficulty as the forces of Hajji Ebrahim, some of the latters forces had begun to desert to the Zands. Agha Mohammad Khan thus raised a large army and marched into Fars. On 5 June 1792, Lotf Ali Khan, with a small <b>force</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> men, made a bold night raid on Agha Mohammad Khan's encampment near Persepolis.|$|E
25|$|Now {{stranded}} in Roman territory, the Goths' lack of provisions {{began to take}} its toll. Aurelian, sensing his enemies' desperation, attacked them with the full <b>force</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> cavalry, killing many and driving the remainder westward into Thrace. As winter set in, the Goths retreated into the Haemus Mountains, only to find themselves trapped and surrounded. The harsh conditions now exacerbated their shortage of food. However, the Romans underestimated the Goths and let their guard down, allowing the enemy to break through their lines and escape. Apparently emperor Claudius ignored advice, perhaps from Aurelian, and withheld the cavalry and sent in only the infantry to stop their break-out.|$|E

25|$|The {{lack of a}} {{vigorous}} response led the Navy to conclude that their bombardment had suppressed the Japanese defenses and in good order the Marines began deployment to the Iwo Jima beach. Gen. Kuribayashi was far from beaten, however. In the deathly silence, landed US Marines began to slowly inch their way forward inland, oblivious to the danger. After allowing the Americans to pile up men and machinery on the beach for just over an hour, Kuribayashi unleashed the undiminished <b>force</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> countermeasures. Shortly after 10:00, everything from machine guns and mortars to heavy artillery began to rain down on the crowded beach, which was quickly transformed into a nightmarish bloodbath.|$|E
25|$|Gruffudd fled to Ireland but, in 1081, {{returned}} {{and made an}} alliance with Rhys ap Tewdwr, prince of Deheubarth. Rhys had been attacked by Caradog ap Gruffudd of Gwent and Morgannwg, and {{had been forced to}} flee to St David's Cathedral. Gruffudd this time embarked from Waterford with a force composed of Danes and Irish and landed near St David's, presumably by prior arrangement with Rhys. He was joined here by a <b>force</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> supporters from Gwynedd, and he and Rhys marched north to seek Trahaearn ap Caradog and Caradog ap Gruffudd who had themselves made an alliance and been joined by Meilyr ap Rhiwallon of Powys. The armies of the two confederacies met at the Battle of Mynydd Carn, with Gruffudd and Rhys victorious and Trahaearn, Caradog and Meilyr all being killed. Gruffudd was thus able to seize power in Gwynedd for the second time.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, in September Austrian {{forces in}} Bohemia pressed into Saxony (which Frederick had largely emptied of {{defenders}} {{in preparation for}} Kunersdorf), quickly occupying Dresden {{and most of the}} electorate. A Prussian relief force under Prince Henry marched south to contest Saxony again, where they retook Leipzig and sharply defeated a larger Austrian force at the 21 September Battle of Korbitz. In response, Daun sent a relief <b>force</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> own into Saxony, only to have it destroyed by Prince Henry's Prussians at the 25 September Battle of Hoyerswerda. Chagrined at the prospect of losing Saxony again, Daun then moved his own main force westward into Saxony, leaving behind the Russians, who withdrew into Poland for the winter. While the Prussian army struggled to rebuild itself in Brandenburg during the autumn, Daun forced the surrender of an entire Prussian corps sent to harass lines of communication between Saxony and Bohemia on 21 November in the Battle of Maxen. Another Austrian victory in Saxony at the 4 December Battle of Meissen ended the campaigning year.|$|E

25|$|Following the {{decision}} by RUC Chief Constable Hugh Annesley to ban the Orange parade through the Garvaghy Road area of Portadown {{in the summer of}} 1996, a protest campaign of road blockages and general disruption was organised across Northern Ireland by the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) and the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP). The protests, which led to a reversal of the ban, saw no official UVF involvement although Wright, despite not {{being a member of the}} Orange Order, was personally involved and led a sizeable <b>force</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> men to Drumcree. Wright and the Mid-Ulster Brigade attracted considerable attention from the global media as they made a formidable show of strength and staunchly defended the Orangemen's right to march their traditional route. The brigade manned the barricades, and brought homemade weapons to the church; among these was a mechanical digger and a petrol tanker. There was intelligence that Wright and his unit had planned to attack the British Army and police who were blocking the Orangemen's passage. Television cameras broadcast Wright directing rioters on Drumcree hill against the security forces. Wright even held a meeting with one of the central figures in the operation, UUP leader David Trimble, and he was often seen in the company of Harold Gracey, Grand Master of the Portadown District Orange Lodge.|$|E
