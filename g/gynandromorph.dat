5000|$|A <b>gynandromorph</b> is an {{organism}} that contains {{both male and}} female characteristics. The term <b>gynandromorph,</b> from Greek [...] "gyne" [...] female and [...] "andro" [...] male, is mainly used in entomology. These characteristics are notable in butterflies and other insects, where {{both male and female}} body parts can be distinguished physically because of sexual dimorphism.|$|E

Twenty adult cuticular structures of 1211 haploid-diploid <b>gynandromorphs</b> {{were placed on}} the fate map using the sturtoid calculation. The overall shape and organization of the Habrobracon fate map {{are similar to those of}} the Drosophila fate map, both of which approximate the shape of an insect embryo but show structures arranged in a manner resembling the adult body plan. Independent samples of <b>gynandromorphs</b> yield similar maps...|$|R
50|$|A {{developmental}} {{network theory}} of how gynandromorphs develop {{from a single}} cell based on internetwork links between parental allelic chromosomes is given in. The major types of gynandromorphs, bilateral, polar and oblique are computationally modeled. Many other possible <b>gynandromorph</b> combinations are computationally modeled, including predicted morphologies yet to be discovered. The article relates <b>gynandromorph</b> developmental control networks to how species may form. The models {{are based on a}} computational model of bilateral symmetry.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>gynandromorph</b> {{can have}} {{bilateral}} asymmetry—one side female and one side male. [...] Alternatively, {{the distribution of}} male and female tissue can be more haphazard.|$|E

40|$|<b>Gynandromorphs</b> are {{chimeric}} individuals simultaneously possessing {{male and}} female characteristics. Unlike plants and some groups of animals, ticks are sexually dimorphic, and <b>gynandromorphs</b> are extremely rare (about 1 / 14, 000 in adult ticks) [1, 2]. More than 60 cases of gynandromorphism have been documented in the family Ixodidae, and 22 cases were in the genus Hyalomma [3 - 12]. Feldman-Muhsam [10] described 8 abnormalities in Hyalomma savignyi, 3 of which were some-what <b>gynandromorphs.</b> One case was a laboratory-bred male showing a female spiracular plate on 1 side of the body, with the great reduction of anal and adanal shields, and the want-ing of subanal shield. The second case was a pseudogynandro-morph that the specimen was considered to a male tick, but the anterior part of its scutum exhibited female characteristics. The third is a female displayed both of the male and femal...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} various lethal {{mutations}} were studied {{when they were}} present in the hemizygous state as sectors in genetic mosaics (<b>gynandromorphs)</b> of Drosophila melanogaster. Sixty percent of the lethals studied can survive to adulthood in combination with normal tissue in mosaics, whereas the remainder cause the death of such mosaic animals. Some of the gynandromorph-viable lethals appeared to be locally active, in that they allowed the survival of only those mosaics in which the male tissue was present in the abdomen. The regions affected by these lethals were identified more precisely by analysis of the tissue distributions in the surviving <b>gynandromorphs...</b>|$|R

50|$|Some {{mental health}} {{researchers}} consider attraction to transgender {{people to be}} a paraphilia. John Money and Margaret Lamacz proposed a series of terms along these lines. Gynemimetophilia denotes sexual attraction to male-assigned people who look or act like women, including genetically male crossdressers. It can also refer to an attraction to trans women. A related term is gynemimesis which refers to a homosexual male who engages in female impersonation without sex reassignment or to describe the adoption of female characteristics by a male. The terms were used by Money for classification purposes in his gender-transposition theory. He also proposed <b>gynandromorph</b> and gynemimetomorph as technical terms for trans women. A <b>gynandromorph</b> is an organism that contains {{both male and female}} characteristics. Gynandromorphy is a term of Greek etymology which means to have some of the body morphology and measurements of both an average woman and man.|$|E
40|$|A causal {{analysis}} of development requires the isolation and characterization of morphogenetic mutants. We are concerned here with those affecting cell behaviour.

40|$|We have {{identified}} {{cells in the}} brain of Drosophila melanogaster that are required to be of female genotype for receptivity to copulation with males. To do this, we determined experimental conditions in which female flies virtually always copulate, then measured the minimum amount of male courtship that is required to stimulate females to indicate their receptivity to copulation. We then observed <b>gynandromorphs</b> with female genitalia {{to determine whether the}} sex mosaics elicited at least the minimum amount of courtship and, if so, whether they copulated. By analyzing these <b>gynandromorphs,</b> in which the genotype of external and internal tissues could be ascertained, we were able to identify a group of cells in the dorsal anterior brain that, when bilaterally female, is necessary and sufficient for receptivity to copulation. This group of cells is anatomically distinct from those that are required to be of male genotype for the performance of courtship behaviors...|$|R
40|$|A clonal {{analysis}} of abdominal development {{was carried out}} using chaeta (y, f 36 a and jv) and trichome (mwh) cell marker mutants. The uncovering of these recessive markers in heterozygous individuals occurred after spontaneous loss of a X ring chromosome (<b>gynandromorphs)</b> or by somatic recombination induced at different developmental stages by 1000 r of X-ray. The minimum spot sizes resulting from preblastodermic <b>gynandromorphs</b> indicate that the least number of primitive analge cells is about 8. This is also the number of imaginal cells per analge present throughout the larval stages of development. Only {{with the onset of}} metamorphosis do the imaginal cells start dividing and spreading over the presumptive tergite area, each pair of bilateral anlage giving rise to a complete tergite. All the tergites studied (II–VI) behaved uniformly in the present experiments. Corresponding with the constant number of imaginal cells during the larval development there is a constant frequency of induced spots or a constant cell sensitivity to SCO. This sensitivity varies depending on the chromosome considered, being higher in the X chromosome than in the 3 L chromosome arm. The data on <b>gynandromorphs,</b> {{as well as those of}} somatic spots, indicate that the adult tergites have an indeterminate pattern of growth. The cell determination to become trichome or micro- or macrochaeta occurs sometime during the pupal expansion of the growing imaginal cell population. Trichome- and chaeta-forming cells may then be separated to construct the adult cuticular pattern. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) are oscine Passerine songbirds {{that are}} native to Australia. Zebra finches have sexually dimorphic plumage, song nuclei, and behavior. The role of chromosomes, hormones, and genes on sexual {{differentiation}} {{are not completely}} understood. A <b>gynandromorph</b> in our aviary had male plumage, a male partner, and produced viable offspring. Mate preference tests revealed lower preference for the <b>gynandromorph</b> and its progeny than controls, suggesting that they had some traits that made them unattractive to other birds. <b>Gynandromorph</b> lineage males had greater same-sex preferences than control males. Chromosomes in birds are different than those in humans. Males are homozygous ZZ, and females are heterozygous ZW. All sampled <b>gynandromorph</b> tissues, including those in sexually dimorphic plumage regions, had ZW female chromosomes. Of zebra finches, males sing and females do not. Because of this, the regions associated with song learning and production, collectively called a song system, are larger in males than in females. We thought to measure {{the size of the}} song nuclei in our <b>gynandromorph</b> and compare it to control males and control females. For song system comparison of the <b>gynandromorph,</b> volume, cell number, and cell size of sexually dimorphic song nuclei were measured. The volumes of the song nuclei for the <b>gynandromorph</b> were consistently between the song nuclei volumes of males and females. Additionally, because birds can see in the ultraviolet spectrum of light, color spectra were analyzed to determine if the <b>gynandromorph</b> or its progeny had plumage differences that were undetectable by the human eye. Video analysis of the <b>gynandromorph</b> and its mate is being completed to determine if the <b>gynandromorph</b> sang and to observe nesting behaviors...|$|E

40|$|Abstract The first <b>gynandromorph</b> of {{the insect}} order Zoraptera is reported. A <b>gynandromorph</b> of Zorotypus brasiliensis Silvestri is {{described}} from a likely parthenogenetic {{population in the}} Atlantic Forest around {{the border of the}} Brazilian states of Minas Gerais, Rio de Janeiro, and São Paulo. As has been previously surmised for this species, the sample consisted of only females, tending to support the hypothesis of thelytokous parthenogenesis for this population. The <b>gynandromorph</b> is largely female in outward appearance, but exhibits male secondary sexual traits {{on the left side of}} the apical abdominal segments. The left (male) antenna consists of antennomeres of different proportions to those of the right (female) antenna. The internal genitalia and associated sclerites, however, are female although some are augmented in their form relative to normal-type females. Comments are made on possible factors resulting in the development of the <b>gynandromorph.</b> This is the 16 th insect order with gynandromorphism reported...|$|E
2500|$|Drosophila flies {{have both}} X and Y {{chromosome}}s, {{as well as}} autosomes. Unlike humans, the Y chromosome does not confer maleness; rather, it encodes genes necessary for making sperm. Sex is instead determined by the ratio of X chromosomes to autosomes. Furthermore, each cell [...] "decides" [...] whether to be male or female independently {{of the rest of}} the organism, resulting in the occasional occurrence of <b>gynandromorphs.</b>|$|R

40|$|Egg blnuclearlty {{has been}} {{suggested}} {{to account for the}} origin o @ a few rare mosaics in Drosophila and of hereditary mosaicism in Ly inantria. Most of the mosaics which have been found in the parasitic wasp, Habrobracon juglandis (Ashmead), are likewise best explained by this hypothesis. The theory advanced by the writer (Whiting. P. W., 1922) is that after extrusion of the first polar body, the second oÃ¶cytenucleus gives rise to two (reduced) nuclei which either take part in parthenogenetic cleavage (male mosaics) or segment after one has been fertilized (<b>gynandromorphs).</b> Post-reduction of binucleate eggs from heterozygous females would then result in mosaic males or, in case of fertilization of one nucleus, in <b>gynandromorphs</b> in which maternal contribution to male and female parts was different. Mosaics in Ilabrobracon are very infrequent. The present paper is based on 132 mosaic males and 92 <b>gynandromorphs</b> which have oc curred scattered through the cultures of various investigators. When ever a mosaic has been reported it has been given a serial number in the â€œ¿freak bookâ€ • with a statement of its origin, a description, and any other pertinent data. The specimen, placed in a gelatine capsule, is then preserved in alcohol for future reference. MOSAIC MALES FROM HETEROZYGOUS MOTHERS Virgin females heterozygous for various genes have been bred +jn tests for linkage. Most of the mosaic males have been found in con nection with these studies. They therefore arise from unfertilized eggs and are mosaic for one or more of those traits for which their mothers were heterozygous. It will be convenient first to give a record of these male mosaics as regards the various genes involved. Females heterozygous for orange, o (eyes) (Chromosome I), have produced thirteen sons mosaic for this trait. When tested by matin...|$|R

40|$|Morphological and {{cytogenetic}} {{analyses of}} a spontaneous <b>gynandromorph</b> of Pycnogaster inermis, {{found in a}} natural population in the Spanish Sierra Nevada, {{have shown that the}} left side was male and the right side female, with almost perfect bilateral symmetry. Ventral valves of the ovipositor were very short, appearing as two spurs; dorsal valves were longer but still shorter than normal. The specimen had an apparently normal testis on the left side and a well-developed ovary on the right side. Cytogenetic analysis revealed the presence of 2 n = 28 + X 0 chromosomes in the testis and 2 n = 28 + XX in the ovary, the same as standard males and females, respectively, of this species. This suggests that the gynandromorphism occurred at a very early developmental stage. This <b>gynandromorph</b> could have originated from the formation of a binucleate egg by second-polar-body reactivation and subsequent fertilization by two spermatozoa, one male- and the other female-determining; however, the most parsimonious explanation is the elimination of one X chromosome in a female-determined zygote (XX) at the first cleavage division...|$|E
