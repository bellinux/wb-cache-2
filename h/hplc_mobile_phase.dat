30|$|The {{bioanalysis}} {{methods of}} DTX {{have been performed}} using HPLC with ultraviolet (UV) or mass spectrometric (MS) detection, or by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays [20]. The lowest quantitation limits of these techniques were 10, 0.2, and 0.3 ng/mL, respectively. Since chromatographic methods are, in general, more selective and may provide information on drug metabolism, HPLC is usually preferred to immunoassays. Although MS detection is by far superior to UV detection, this technique is {{at the disposal of}} few laboratories or hospitals only, due to the high costs of the required equipment. For these reasons, the analysis method of DTX by means of HPLC with UV detection is generally considered a first choice for pharmacokinetic and tissue distribution studies in this work. According to the previous reports, a relatively good resolution was achieved for DTX by use of a manual pre-processing solid-phase extraction (SPE) procedure [21]. Herein, we developed a simpler reverse-phase HPLC analysis method of DTX concentration in plasma by use of a simpler liquid-liquid extraction instead of a SPE procedure, further with a <b>HPLC</b> <b>mobile</b> <b>phase</b> polarity regulator of tetrahydrofuran, and a <b>HPLC</b> <b>mobile</b> <b>phase</b> pH value slight regulator of acetic acid for a better optimization separation of DTX. Using this system, the retention time for DTX in rats plasma and mice tissue were approximately 10.7 and 11.2 min, respectively, with good resolution and without any interference from endogenous plasma constituents or DTX metabolites at these retention times. The total run time needed is only 13 min.|$|E

30|$|We {{reasoned}} {{from the}} calculated pKa of [18 F]AV 1451 (Fig.  4), {{as well as}} a literature report of the pKa of γ-carboline (Angulo et al. 1997), that the use of a basic medium was the optimal approach to purify this radiotracer. The γ-carboline core of [18 F]AV 1451 contains both pyrrole-like and pyridine-like nitrogen atoms. ADMET and JChem predict the pKa of the pyrrole NH is ~ 12 - 13, and the conjugate pKa of the pyridine is ~ 7 - 8 (Fig.  4), and so the best separation could likely be achieved at a pH where [18 F]AV 1451 (and other reaction components) would be neutral. Since we also wished to avoid the use of Class 2 solvents such as MeCN, we elected to use an ethanolic phosphate buffer at pH  9.3. This buffer will leave the pyrrole nitrogen protonated, but will not protonate the pyridine-like nitrogen of the γ-carboline core. A comparison of the reported acidic buffers with this basic buffer revealed sharper peaks and increased separation when using the basic buffer (data not shown). Moreover, peak broadening and overlap of [18 F]AV 1451 2 with contaminants, that occurred when we used acidic <b>HPLC</b> <b>mobile</b> <b>phases,</b> was not an issue with the basic buffer. The longer retention times and better peak shapes gave baseline separation of the product from other reaction components.|$|R

40|$|A fully {{automated}} method for the simultaneous determination of verapamil {{and its main}} metabolite norverapamil in human plasma is described. This method is based on on-line sample preparation using dialysis followed by clean-up and enrichment of the dialysate on a precolumn and subsequent HPLC analysis with fluorometric detection. All sample handling operations were performed automatically by a sample processor equipped with a robotic arm (ASTED system). The plasma samples were dialysed on a cellulose acetate membrane (cut-off: 15 kD) and the dialysate was purified and enriched on a short pre-column filled with cyanopropyl silica. Before starting dialysis, this trace enrichment column (TEC) was first conditioned with the <b>HPLC</b> <b>mobile</b> <b>phase</b> and then with pH 3. 0 acetate buffer. 370 microliters of plasma sample spiked with the internal standard (gallopamil) were dialysed in the static-pulsed mode. The solution at the donor side was pH 3. 0 acetate buffer containing Triton X- 100 while the acceptor solution {{was made of the}} same acetate buffer. When dialysis was discontinued, the analytes were desorbed from the TEC by the <b>HPLC</b> <b>mobile</b> <b>phase</b> and transferred to the C 18 analytical column by means of a switching valve. This mobile phase consisted of a mixture of acetonitrile, pH 3. 0 acetate buffer and 2 -aminoheptane. The influence of different parameters of the dialysis process on the recovery of verapamil and norverapamil has been studied. The effect of the volume, the aspirating and dispensing flow-rates of the dialysis solution has been investigated. The recoveries of verapamil and norverapamil in plasma were close to 75 % and the limits of quantification were 5 ng/ml for both analytes.

Prostacyclin (PGI 2) is another chemically reactive prostanoid that has a chemical half-life of 3 – 4 min. The recent development of reversed phase HPLC stationary phases that are stable to elevated pH (pH 10 – 12) without significant column damage has permitted direct analysis of these acid-sensitive eicosanoids. Using electrospray ionization, molecular anions [M − H]− of these compounds were observed at m/z 317 for LTA 4 and m/z 351 for both PGH 2 and PGI 2. The mechanism of formation of ions derived from collisional activation of LTA 4 was studied using stable isotope labeled and chemical analogs of LTA 4 and found to involve formation of highly conjugated anions at m/z 261 and 163. The collisional activation of the molecular anion of PGH 2 yielded a product ion spectrum identical to that observed for the isomeric prostaglandins PGE 2 and PGD 2.

40|$|Total capsaicins are {{extracted}} from 2 mL aliquots of serum or plasma using methyl-isobutyl ketone, evaporation of the extract to dryness and reconstitution with 200 μL of acetonitrile. The <b>HPLC</b> <b>mobile</b> <b>phase</b> is 40 : 60 water:acetonitrile. The absorbance of the eluent is monitored at 205 nm. Standardisation uses a known mixture of pure capsaicin and dihydrocapsaicin. Accuracies are 98. 9 and 100. 6 % for capsaicin and dihydrocapsaicin respectively. Inter batch reproducibility for both is 15 %. The limits of detection are 2. 6 and 3. 8 ng/mL for capsaicin and dihydrocapsaicin respectively. Analyses of sera obtained previously from human subjects who had eaten chilli containing meals {{showed that in}} those that absorbed capsaicins (N = 30) then the median, mean and SD of their serum capsaicin were: 13. 4, 18. 9 and 16. 3 ng/mL. The corresponding data for those sera (N = 13) that had measurable levels of dihydrocapsaicin were: 6. 9, 7. 5 and 3. 6 ng/mL.

40|$|A {{method has}} been {{developed}} by Argonne National Laboratory to identify and quantify As(III), As(V), and organoarsenic compounds in environmental samples. A arsenic species were separated by reversed-phase, ion-pairing, HPLC using a microbore Inertsil-ODS{trademark} column. Only 1 {micro}L of sample was injected on the column, and the mobile phase flow rates were typically {{on the order of}} 40 {micro}L/min. The <b>HPLC</b> <b>mobile</b> <b>phase</b> was a mixture of methanol and tetrabutylammonium hydroxide (TBAH), and the column effluent was introduced into an ICP-mass spectrometer using direct injection nebulization. Detection limits of less than 1 pg As (as injected on the column) were easily obtained for each arsenic species. The effect of changes in mobile phase composition and ICP-MS conditions will be described, as well as quality control measures, e. g., the use of surrogates, internal standards, and matrix spikes. Precision and accuracy information will be presented from the analysis of aqueous standards and soil extracts that were spiked with arsenic oxide [As(III) ], sodium arsenate [As(V) ], dimethylarsinic acid (DMAA), or chlorovinyl arsenious acid (CVAA). The authors believe that these data demonstrate the utility of this technique for the sensitive determination of arsenic species present in water or soil...|$|E
30|$|The {{derivatization}} {{was performed}} in the same vial. For this purpose, the Drummond Dialamatic micro dispenser was used to transfer 50  μL of the included reagent 4 (mixture of chloroform and the derivatization substance) into the vial. Next, the solutions were mixed by repeated vortexing for 5 – 6  s. The reaction was allowed to proceed for at least 1  min. The emulsion gradually separated into two layers. Then the liquid was mixed again by vortexing the vial for 5  s and the reaction was allowed to proceed for another minute. Afterward 100  μL of iso-octane (included in the EZ:faast™ Kit) were transferred with the micro dispenser and mixed for 5  s. Then, the reaction was left to proceed for one more minute, and the emulsion separated into two phases. The upper (organic) phase contained the derivatized amino acids to be analyzed by LC–MS. The upper phase was transferred into another vial and evaporated to dryness in a gentle steam of argon at room temperature in less than 10  min. Afterwards the analyte has been dissolved in 100  µL of the <b>HPLC</b> <b>mobile</b> <b>phase</b> {{to be able to}} perform LC–MS analysis.|$|E
