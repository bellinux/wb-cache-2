40|$|Human {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) -specific CD 8 + T cells {{play a critical}} role in containing HIV replication and delaying disease progression. However, HIV-specific CD 8 + T cells become progressively more exhausted as chronic HIV infection proceeds. Symptoms of T cell exhaustion range from expression of inhibitory receptors and selective loss of cytokine production capacity through reduced proliferative potential, impaired differentiation into effector cells and increased susceptibility to apoptosis. While effective combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) durably reduces HIV viremia to undetectable levels, this alone does not restore the full pluripotency of HIV-specific CD 8 + T cells. In a number of studies, a subset of peptide epitope variants categorized as <b>heteroclitic,</b> restimulated more potent cellular immune responses in vitro than did the native, immunizing peptides themselves.

In general, the improved stability of these <b>heteroclitic</b> complexes has been inferred from their improved immunogenicity but has not been formally assessed.

40|$|Peptides {{that bind}} poorly to MHC class I {{molecules}} often elicit low–functional avidity T cell responses. Peptide modification by altering the anchor residue facilitates increased binding affinity and may elicit T cells with increased functional avidity toward the native epitope (“heteroclitic”). This augmented MHC binding {{is likely to}} increase the half-life and surface density of the <b>heteroclitic</b> complex, but precisely how this enhanced T cell response occurs in vivo is not known. Furthermore, the ideal <b>heteroclitic</b> epitope will elicit T cell responses that completely cross-react with the native epitope, maximizing protection and minimizing undesirable off-target effects. Such epitopes have been difficult to identify. In this study, using mice infected with a murine coronavirus that encodes epitopes that elicit high (S 510, CSLWNGPHL) – and low (S 598, RCQIFANI) –functional avidity responses, we show that increased expression of peptide S 598 but not S 510 generated T cells with enhanced functional avidity.

We also identified a <b>heteroclitic</b> epitope (RCVIFANI) that elicited a T cell response with nearly complete cross-reactivity with native epitope and demonstrated increased MHC/peptide abundance compared with native S 598.

We analyzed peptide-specific CD 8 + T cell responses in detail, by generating and characterizing over 200 cytotoxic T lymphocyte clones derived from T cell responses to <b>heteroclitic</b> peptide vaccination, and compared these responses to endogenous anti-tumor T cell responses elicited naturally (a <b>heteroclitic</b> peptide is a modification of a native peptide sequence involving substitution of an amino acid at an anchor residue to enhance the immunogenicity of the peptide). We found that vaccine-elicited T cells are diverse in T cell receptor variable chain beta expression and exhibit a different recognition profile for <b>heteroclitic</b> versus native peptide. In particular, vaccine-elicited T cells respond to native peptide with predominantly low recognition efficiency [...] a measure of the sensitivity of a T cell to different cognate peptide concentrations for stimulation [...] and, as a result, are inefficient in tumor lysis. In contrast, endogenous tumor-associated-antigen-specific T cells show a predominantly high recognition efficiency for native peptide and efficiently lyse tumor targets. These results suggest that factors that shape the peptide-specific T cell repertoire after vaccination may be different from those that affect the endogenous response. Furthermore, our findings suggest that current <b>heteroclitic</b> peptide vaccination protocols drive expansion of peptide-specific T cells with a diverse range of recognition efficiencies, a significant proportion of which are unable to respond to melanoma cells.

However, wild type epitopes can be tweaked to activate cross-reactive T-cell clones, resulting in antitumor activity. The design of these analogs (i. e., <b>heteroclitic</b> peptides) can be difficult and time-consuming since no automated in silico tools are available. Hereby we describe {{the development of an}} in silico framework to improve the selection of <b>heteroclitic</b> peptides. The Epitope Discovery and Improvement System (EDIS) was first validated by studying the model antigen SIINFEKL. Based on artificial neural network (ANN) predictions, we selected two mutant analogs that are characterized by an increased MHC-I binding affinity (SIINFAKL) or increased TCR stimulation (SIIWFEKL). Therapeutic vaccination using optimized peptides resulted in enhanced antitumor activity and against B 16. OVA melanomas in vivo. The translational potential of the EDIS platform was further demonstrated by studying the melanoma-associated antigen tyrosinase related protein 2 (TRP 2). Following therapeutic immunization with the EDIS-derived epitope SVYDFFAWL, a significant reduction in the growth of established B 16. F 10 tumors was observed, suggesting a break in the tolerance toward the wild type epitope. Finally, we tested a multi vaccine approach, demonstrating that combination of wild type and mutant epitopes targeting both TRP 2 and OVA antigens increases the antitumor response. In conclusion, by taking advantage of available prediction servers and molecular dynamics simulations, we generated an innovative platform for studying the initial sequences and selecting lead candidates with improved immunological features.

Using the J 2. 2 –V– 1 model of CNS infection, we addressed the role of sustained CCL 2 production during viral infection using mice in which CCL 2 was expressed transgenically in oligodendrocytes. Tonic CCL 2 expression in the CNS resulted in delayed kinetics of virus clearance, and converted what is typically a mild, nonlethal disease to acutely lethal encephalitis, {{with the majority of}} mice succumbing to the infection. CCL 2 induced a rapid and dysregulated inflammatory response that was no longer protective and was unable to efficiently clear virus from the CNS. Infected CCL 2 Tg mice had increased numbers of Foxp 3 –expressing CD 4 T cells (Tregs) and of macrophages and microglia expressing elevated levels of YM– 1, a marker for alternatively activated macrophages, and nitric oxide. Our results showed that CCL 2 has effects beyond serving as a chemoattractant for leukocytes, and has effects on the composition and function of inflammatory cells at sites of infection. In a separate set of experiments, I identified and characterized two additional <b>heteroclitic</b> variants of the JHMV epitope S 598 that induced CD 8 T cells with greater antigen sensitivity to the native S 598 determinant relative to the cells primed by the native epitope. One of these <b>heteroclitic</b> epitopes elicited a T cell response with nearly complete cross–reactivity towards the native peptide. The structural data show that these <b>heteroclitic</b> epitopes induced modest conformational changes in the local environment of the peptide–MHCI complex. I also provide data to support the notion that <b>heteroclitic</b> determinants augment functional avidity by increasing surface epitope density. Collectively, these data will help guide the design of <b>heteroclitic</b> epitopes in the setting of vaccine development. Lastly, I examined the consequences of oxidative stress induced by viral infection on antigen presentation. The brains of JHMV–infected mice were found to have signs of oxidative stress, with significantly decreased ratios of reduced (GSH) to oxidized (GSSG) glutathione, suggesting that there is an environment that is conducive for cysteine modification with oxidized glutathione. We found that virus–induced oxidative stress resulted in the presentation of both native and S–glutathionylated forms of the JHMV epitope S 510 by infected cells. A subset of the S 510 –specific CD 8 T cells failed to recognize the modified form of the epitope, suggesting that GSH–modification of a cysteine–containing viral epitope might interfere with T cell recognition. Further, GSH-modified peptides were identified in stressed human cells, including herpes virus–transformed B cells, suggesting that the modification is not limited to mouse cells. Collectively these findings have implications for both anti–viral immunity and anti–tumor immunity, where oxidative stress has been shown to play a role during infection and tumorgenesis...|$|E

Hapten-specific cytolytic T lymphocytes (CTL) were generated by painting cyclophosphamide-treated mice with chemically reactive haptens, furyl Ox and styryl Ox, and their fine-specificity was investigated. Cytolytic cells generated in this way were 'homoclitic' in all cases, showing a preference for targets coupled with the homologous haptens (the immunogens) ...|$|E
40|$|T-cells {{specific}} for MART- 126 - 35, {{a dominant}} melanoma epitope restricted by {{human leukocyte antigen}} (HLA) -A* 0201, are exceptionally common in the naïve T-cell repertoire.

40|$|We call -i/n- Heteroclits five nouns which {{present an}} {{alternation}} in this way: an i-stem of N. A. sg. (or masculine gender) {{is opposed to}} an n-stem of oblique cases (or feminine gender). In four of them this system {{is used for the}} opposition of case: this formation appears only in O. I. : áks̟i, etc. In the remaining nouns, the -i/n- alternance serves for the opposition of gender: O. L. m. páti- / f. pátnī-, and related forms. The author reviews the etymology of all these nouns: there are phonetic reasons to suppose that the alternation -i/n- is apparent; in all cases they are laryngeal stems, as it is justified by comparative material. In short, this inflexional type must be reduced to the <b>heteroclitic</b> -ø/n- stem...|$|E
40|$|Although {{antibodies}} {{are highly}} specific, cross-reactions are frequently observed. To understand the molecular {{basis of this}} phenomenon, we studied the anti-hen egg lysozyme (HEL) monoclonal antibody (mAb) D 11. 15, which cross-reacts with several avian lysozymes, in some cases with a higher affinity (<b>heteroclitic</b> binding) than for HEL. We have determined the crystal structure of the Fv fragment of D 11. 15 complexed with pheasant egg lysozyme (PHL). In addition, we have determined the structure of PHL, Guinea fowl egg lysozyme, and Japanese quail egg lysozyme. Differences in the affinity of D 11. 15 for the lysozymes appear to result from sequence substitutions in these antigens at the interface with the antibody. More generally, cross-reactivity is seen to require a stereochemically permissive environment for the variant antigen residues at the antibody-antigen interface...|$|E
40|$|Four murine {{monoclonal}} IgE antibodies specific for the hapten, 4 -hydroxy- 3 -nitrophenylacetyl (NP), {{had been}} previously found to be <b>heteroclitic</b> in nature in that they bound the crossreacting hapten, 4 -hydroxy- 3 -iodo- 5 -nitrophenylacetyl (NIP), with greater affinity than NP. The influence of antibody affinity {{on the results of}} two commonly used assays for IgE, namely the radioallergosorbent test (RAST) and histamine release from rat peritoneal mast cells, was studied using these antibodies. In general, in agreement with previous reports, it was found that affinity influences both RAST and histamine release; however, the affinity constants deduced from equilibrium dialysis measurements for the reactions with monovalent haptens were not directly related to the activities of the antibodies as reflected in assays using multivalent hapten protein conjugates.

40|$|The helper T-cell {{recognition}} of globular protein antigens {{requires that the}} antigen be processed and presented by an I-region associated (Ia) -expressing antigen-presenting cell (APC). Processing involves the uptake of antigen into an intracellular, proteolytic, acidic compartment; release of peptide fragments containing the T-cell antigenic determinant; association of these peptides with Ia; and presentation of these complexes on the cell surface for recognition by the specific T cells. The molecular mechanisms by which processed antigenic peptides associate with Ia within the APC are poorly understood. To date, functional antigen-Ia complexes have not been isolated from cells that have processed native antigens, although {{the resolution of the}} structure of a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I protein indicates that peptide is bound in a groove between two alpha-helical regions of the molecule and synthetic peptides have been demonstrated to bind purified MHC both in detergent solution and incorporated into planar membranes, where the MHC-peptide complexes function to activate specific T cells. Here we demonstrate that Ia purified from APCs that have processed the native globular protein antigen cytochrome c, when incorporated into lipid membranes, stimulates cytochrome c-specific T cells in the absence of exogenous antigenic peptide. The T-cell response to Ia purified from cytochrome c-pulsed APCs shows the same MHC restriction and antigen fine specificity as the response to antigen-pulsed APCs. Indeed, T-cell {{recognition of}} pigeon cytochrome c (Pc) shows a well documented high-affinity <b>heteroclitic</b> cross-reaction to insect cytochromes c-namely, those of Drosophila melanogaster (DMc) and tobacco hornworm moth (THMc). The same <b>heteroclitic</b> response is observed when purified Ia from unpulsed cells, incorporated into lipid membranes, is used to present antigenic peptides of Pc and of THMc. Significantly, Ia purified from APCs that have processed DMc is approximately 50 -fold more active in stimulating specific T cells compared to Ia purified from APCs that have processed Pc. The peptide-Ia complex isolated here may provide the necessary material for analysis of the physiochemical properties of the processed form of the antigen that is produced by the APC and associates with Ia...|$|E
