50|$|An <b>impact</b> <b>attenuator,</b> {{also known}} as a crash cushion, crash attenuator, or cowboy cushion, is a device {{intended}} to reduce the damage to structures, vehicles, and motorists resulting from a motor vehicle collision. Impact attenuators are designed to absorb the colliding vehicle's kinetic energy. They may also be designed to redirect the vehicle away from the hazard or away from roadway machinery and workers. Impact attenuators are usually placed in front of fixed structures near highways, such as gore points, crash barrier introductions, or overpass supports. Temporary versions may be used for road construction projects.|$|E

50|$|The {{majority}} of the regulations pertain to safety. Cars must have two steel roll hoops of designated thickness and alloy, regardless of {{the composition of the}} rest of the chassis.

Cars must also have two hydraulic brake circuits, full five-point racing harnesses, and must meet geometric templates for driver location in the cockpit for all drivers competing. Tilt-tests ensure that no fluids will spill from the car under heavy cornering, and there must be no line-of-sight between the driver and fuel, coolant, or oil lines.|$|E
50|$|Typically, crumple {{zones are}} located in the front part of the vehicle, in order to absorb the impact of a head-on collision, though they may be found on other parts of the vehicle as well. According to a British Motor Insurance Repair Research Centre study of where on the vehicle impact damage occurs: 65% were front impacts, 25% rear impacts, 5% left side, and 5% right side. Some racing cars use aluminium, composite/carbon fibre honeycomb, or energy {{absorbing}} foam to form an <b>impact</b> <b>attenuator</b> that dissipates crash energy using a much smaller volume and lower weight than road car crumple zones. Impact attenuators have also been introduced on highway maintenance vehicles in some countries.|$|E

40|$|Roadworks {{can cause}} {{dangerous}} situations for both road users and road workers. In the period 2000 - 2009, 2 % of all registered fatal crashes in the Netherlands {{took place at}} roadworks. In addition, roadworks seem to increase the crash rate. Lorries are relatively often involved in crashes at roadworks. Especially in urban areas cyclists are insufficiently taken into consideration at roadworks. Therefore, a number of urban crashes was indeed caused by slow traffic entering a closed off road. Crashes at roadworks on rural roads are relatively often rear-end collisions, while some crashes involve work vehicles, <b>impact</b> <b>attenuators</b> and other objects.

50|$|A Fitch Barrier {{is a type}} of <b>impact</b> <b>attenuator</b> {{consisting}} of a sand-filled plastic barrels, usually yellow colored with a black lid. Fitch barriers are often found in a triangular arrangement {{at the end of a}} guard rail between a highway and an exit lane (the area known as the gore), along the most probable line of impact. The barriers in front contain the least sand, with each successive barrel containing more, so that when a vehicle collides with the barrels they shatter, the kinetic energy is dissipated by scattering the sand and the vehicle decelerates smoothly instead of violently striking a solid obstruction, reducing the risk of injury to the occupants. Fitch barriers are widely popular due to their effectiveness, low cost, and ease of setup and repair or replacement.|$|E

40|$|In {{the last}} decades the {{replacement}} of conventional materials with innovative composite ones is increased significantly thanks to their advantages of lightweight and high specific strength. Nevertheless the heterogeneity and the various damage mechanisms of composite materials make their modelling very difficult. Very few attempts have been done from the {{analytical point of view}} in order to describe and predict the impact behavior of composite <b>impact</b> <b>attenuators</b> under axial loading. Towards this goal optimization techniques play an important role as a useful decision making tool in the design of structures. In the present study a theoretical analysis of the failure mechanism, pertaining to the stable mode of collapse, of thin-walled tubes with circular section subjected to axial loading is exposed in order to predict the mean loads and the crush lengths during collapse. The analysis is based on an energetic approach aimed at finding the minimum of the average load function, dependent on several variables, which represents the best configuration of crushing.

40|$|Abstract- In {{a modern}} day vehicle, usually a {{monocoque}} chassis is preferred {{which is designed}} and manufactured as a single structure. Such a chassis in case of acollision absorbs the impact energy by getting deformed itself and also reduces thedeceleration to an appreciable extent such that no fatal damage is impinged on thepassenger. In the motorsport world, a mechanical structurecalled an <b>Impact</b> <b>Attenuator</b> is used to prevent extreme damage to the vehiclechassis {{in the event of}} collision. The working of an <b>Impact</b> <b>Attenuator</b> is based on the energy conservation principle which states that energy can neither be created ordestroyed but can only be transformed from one form to other. In case of an ImpactAttenuator, the kinetic energy (K) of the vehicle just before impact gets transferredinto the Internal energy or Strain energy (S) of the attenuator after velocity of thevehicle ceases to zero. The aim of the paper is to study the working of an <b>Impact</b> <b>Attenuator</b> by understanding the underlying physics and mathematics responsible for its working followed by formulating a design for a passenger vehicle chosen for the project as reference and analysing its effect under a probable situation of collision which is within our approach. The CAD platforms used for the purpose are SOLIDWORKS for 3 d modeling and ANSYS for working out the simulation of the cad model for optimizing the design so as to yield the best possible results. The paper is conceptualized around the possibility of using an <b>Impact</b> <b>Attenuator</b> for passenger vehicles.

50|$|The ends of some {{guard in}} rails on {{high-speed}} highways in the United States are protected with <b>impact</b> <b>attenuators,</b> designed to gradually absorb the kinetic {{energy of a}} vehicle and slow it more gently before it can strike {{the end of the}} guard rail head on, which would be devastating at high speed. Several mechanisms are used to dissipate kinetic energy. Fitch Barriers, a system of sand-filled barrels, uses momentum transfer from the vehicle to the sand.

40|$|Nowadays the {{key points}} in the {{automotive}} design are the pollutant emissions and the safety. For these reasons, on one side, in the car design the tendency is to use innovative lightweight materials {{in order to reduce}} the weight of the vehicle and consequently the fuel consumption and the gas emissions. On the other side, to reach high level of safety, these materials have to be able to absorb high amount of energy in case of impact. For these reasons, in the last decades, the use of composites as design material for <b>impact</b> <b>attenuators</b> in automotive design is increased significantly. The ever-wider use of composite materials for automotive applications involves the need to predict their behaviour under various load conditions which they are subjected, for example with the use of finite element codes. Moreover, more recently, the strong emphasis on recyclability from the end-of-life vehicle directive seems to affect significantly the choice of materials in the design phase. In this overview, the use of thermoplastic composite based components for vehicle structure is investigated in this work. In particular a thermoplastic fibres combined with a thermoplastic matrix is considered.

50|$|A gore (British English: nose), {{refers to}} a {{triangular}} piece of land. Etymologically it is derived from , meaning spear. Gores on highways are categorized as two types: the theoretical gore and the physical gore. The physical gore is the unpaved area created between the highway mainline and a ramp that merges into or diverges from the mainline. The theoretical gore is the marked area of pavement resulting from the convergence or divergence of the edge lines of the mainline and ramp. theoretical gores are commonly marked with transverse lines or chevrons at both entrance and exit ramps. These help drivers entering the highway to estimate how much time they have to match the speed of through traffic, and warn drivers improperly exiting the highway {{right down the middle}} of a gore that they are about to run out of road.
