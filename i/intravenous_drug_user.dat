5|$|In 1985, Dallas {{electrician}} and rodeo cowboy Ron Woodroof (Matthew McConaughey) {{is diagnosed}} with AIDS and given 30 days to live. He initially refuses {{to accept the}} diagnosis, but remembers having unprotected sex {{with a woman who}} was an <b>intravenous</b> <b>drug</b> <b>user.</b> He is soon ostracized by family and friends and gets fired from his job, believed by family, friends and coworkers to have had homosexual relations, and is eventually evicted from his home. At the hospital, he is tended to by Dr. Eve Saks (Jennifer Garner), who tells him that they are testing a drug called zidovudine (AZT), an antiretroviral drug which is thought to prolong the life of AIDS patients—and is the only drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for testing on humans. Dr. Saks informs him that in the clinical trials, half the patients receive the drug and the other half are given a placebo, as {{this is the only way}} they can determine if the drug is working.|$|E
25|$|Stoltenberg's drug {{addiction}} became {{known to the}} Norwegian public in October 2001, one week after her brother had resigned from his first cabinet. The revelation came when she spoke {{about it in the}} current affairs television program, Rikets Tilstand, which broke previous records for number of viewers. Following the program in which she appeared together with her father, Thorvald Stoltenberg, she received more than 2,000 letters of support from viewers who {{in one way or another}} had experienced the problems associated with illegal drug abuse. Thorvald Stoltenberg has described his experiences with having a child who was an <b>intravenous</b> <b>drug</b> <b>user</b> in his 2001 memoirs, Det handler om mennesker ("It's about people")–one day being immersed in peace negotiations in the Balkans, the next wandering the streets of Oslo trying to find Nini.|$|E
25|$|In 2007, Stoltenberg {{went into}} more detail {{about how she}} {{started out as a}} drug addict, to TV {{journalist}} Tonje Steinsland–the second time her life as an addict {{was the subject of a}} television special. It started in 1991, when she was 27. She witnessed two drug addicts in a fight in a cafe in Oslo when something fell out of the pocket of one of them. She picked it up and saw that it was heroin. Together with her boyfriend she went home and decided to snort the drug. For the next three years she was an <b>intravenous</b> <b>drug</b> <b>user.</b> By the end of the 1990s, she was close to dying. In the interview, Stoltenberg also tells of a boyfriend who subjected her to punishments, psychological terror and much fear, however, the heroin turned all of that into a feeling of freedom and made her perceive their relationship as simply wonderful, for a while.|$|E

40|$|Abstract To {{assess the}} {{prevalence}} of markers of Leishmania infection, 93 <b>intravenous</b> <b>drug</b> <b>users</b> and 77 nonusers of <b>intravenous</b> <b>drugs</b> underwent a Leishmania skin test and a serum Leishmania antibody search.

50|$|Close {{monitoring}} of emerging HIV-1 subtypes related to <b>intravenous</b> <b>drug</b> use and implementing harm-reduction programs {{has been and}} continue to be vital in preventing similar outbreaks in other populations of <b>intravenous</b> <b>drug</b> <b>users</b> in neighboring countries. In 2005, Alex Wodak, Gerry Stimson, and other harm-reduction experts were invited to Taiwan to share their experiences with government officials, medical field-workers, and public-health professionals. After careful study of harm-reduction programs in place in Hong Kong and Australia, a pilot program was started in four of Taiwan's 23 administrative areas in September, 2005. This program has since been expanded nationally, and consists of 427 service sites for syringe exchange plus centres for methadone maintenance therapy. Free methadone is provided to HIV-1-infected <b>intravenous</b> <b>drug</b> <b>users</b> while HIV-1 seronegative <b>intravenous</b> <b>drug</b> <b>users</b> have to pay about US$1600 a year. The Taiwan Centers for Disease Control plans to provide methadone maintenance to <b>intravenous</b> <b>drug</b> <b>users</b> in prisons, and the country's Bureau of Controlled Drugs will start producing methadone to assist in the government's commitment to providing methadone maintenance to 30,000 <b>intravenous</b> <b>drug</b> <b>users</b> by 2009.|$|R

50|$|Of the 60,000-100,000 injecting <b>drug</b> <b>users</b> in Taiwan, 10-15% may be {{infected}} with CRF07_BC.

40|$|Human {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) infection {{continues to be}} a major health problem for society. <b>Intravenous</b> <b>drug</b> <b>users</b> are the second largest risk group for HIV infection.

This study examined the inherent immunologic dysfunction by measuring the seroprevalence of infection against pathogens often associated with HIV infection. Additionally, chi square analysis was used to compare <b>intravenous</b> <b>drug</b> <b>users</b> with a non-drug-using control group to see if any difference existed in the prevalence of antinuclear antibody, rheumatoid factor, abnormal titer of antibody to Toxoplasma gondii, cytomegalovirus, and herpes simplex virus (types 1 and 2). The <b>intravenous</b> <b>drug</b> <b>users</b> had a significantly greater level of antibody titers for antinuclear antibody and Toxoplasma gondii than did controls.

40|$|Background: Concerns {{have been}} raised that <b>intravenous</b> <b>drug</b> <b>users</b> {{may be less likely}} to start highly active {{antiretroviral}} therapy (HAART) and that adherence to therapy may be poor among this group of patients. Given the decreased mortality and incidence of AIDS-defining illnesses among patients with HIV who start HAART, this may lead to a poorer prognosis among <b>intravenous</b> <b>drug</b> <b>users.</b> Purpose: To compare homosexual men, <b>intravenous</b> <b>drug</b> <b>users</b> and heterosexuals in EuroSIDA, a prospective European cohort of 7331 patients with HIV in terms of starting a HAART treatment regimen, immunologic and virologic response to therapy, and survival. Methods: 6645 patients were included in this analysis. Logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards models were used to investigate the factors associated with use of HAART regimens and survival following recruitment to the EuroSIDA study. Results: In a multivariate logistic regression model, <b>intravenous</b> <b>drug</b> <b>users</b> were significantly less likely to be receiving HAART at recruitment to EuroSIDA (odds ratio [OR], 0. 48; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 0. 37 - 0. 62; p <. 0001) when compared with homosexual men. Similarly, during follow-up, <b>intravenous</b> <b>drug</b> <b>users</b> were at a 27 % reduced risk of starting HAART, after adjustment for other factors related to starting HAART (relative hazard [RH], 0. 73; 95 % CI, 0. 64 - 0. 82; p <. 0001). There were no differences between heterosexual and homosexual patients, and similar results were found within regions of Europe (South, Central and Northern). Among those patients who started HAART, {{there were no significant differences}} between exposure groups in CD 4 lymphocyte count response to HAART or virologic response to HAART. After adjustment for factors related to survival, <b>intravenous</b> <b>drug</b> <b>users</b> were at a small, but nonsignificant increased risk of death compared with homosexuals (RH 1. 16; 95 % CI, 0. 99 - 1. 38; p =. 074). Conclusions: <b>Intravenous</b> <b>drug</b> <b>users</b> were significantly less likely to start HAART, but among those who did, response to therapy was similar to that of other exposure groups. There were no differences in risk of death. If <b>intravenous</b> <b>drug</b> <b>users</b> continue to use HAART less commonly than other exposure groups, it may result in a poorer prognosis, a different spectrum of AIDS-defining illnesses, and differential long-term clinical needs.

5000|$|Intravenous {{drug use}} (IDU) {{is a major}} risk factor for {{hepatitis}} C {{in many parts of}} the world. Of 77 countries reviewed, 25 (including the United States) were found to have prevalences of hepatitis C in the <b>intravenous</b> <b>drug</b> <b>user</b> population of between 60% and 80%. [...] Twelve countries had rates greater than 80%. It is believed that ten million intravenous drug users are infected with hepatitis C; China (1.6 million), the United States (1.5 million), and Russia (1.3 million) have the highest absolute totals. Occurrence of hepatitis C among prison inmates in the United States is 10 to 20 times that of the occurrence observed in the general population; this has been attributed to high-risk behavior in prisons such as IDU and tattooing with nonsterile equipment. Shared intranasal drug use may also be a risk factor.|$|E
