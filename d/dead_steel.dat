50|$|The {{strike is}} {{characterized}} {{as one of}} the most violent strikes of the 1930s, with thousands of strikers arrested, three hundred injured and eighteen <b>dead.</b> The Little <b>Steel</b> companies eventually defeated the strike, which lasted just over five months time. However, groundwork for the unionization of the Little Steel industry was set and the goal to unionize Little Steel occurred five years later, in 1942, as World War II began to ramp up.|$|R
50|$|The {{opening act}} for {{this series of}} concerts, and for many other shows of that era, was the New Riders of the Purple Sage. At that time the lineup of the New Riders {{featured}} Jerry Garcia of the Grateful <b>Dead</b> playing pedal <b>steel</b> guitar. The band also included John Dawson, David Nelson, Dave Torbert, and Spencer Dryden. Songs that they recorded at the February 21 and February 23, 1971 shows at the Capitol Theatre were released as an album called Vintage NRPS.|$|R
50|$|In early 2012, The Criminals {{reformed}} as a four-piece {{and participated}} in the 1-2-3-4 Go! Records Celebration Night No. 1 with American <b>Steel,</b> <b>Dead</b> to Me and Vanna Inget on May 24, 2012. The band went on to play The Fest in Gainesville and Awesomefest in San Diego, along with 924 Gilman Street, all in 2012. The main difference between this and any other incarnation is that while Jesse Luscious and Brady Ceasar {{are still in the}} band, this lineup features new bassist Nice Guy Brandon from Scattered Fall and drummer Markley Hart from Econochrist.|$|R
50|$|Tung, {{loaded with}} alcohol and barbiturates, cruises town to find Push-pin. He {{receives}} word Push-pin is back at his underground casino and goes there to bring Push-pin down once and for all. This results in Tung taking on not only Push-pin, but all his underlings as well. Cheung shows up with his officers to help, only to find Tung moments later seemingly <b>dead</b> from a <b>steel</b> spike Push-pin has rammed into Tung's gut. Seconds later, Push-pin is killed by one of Fai's men as revenge for his killing of Fai.|$|R

60|$|Surely Queen {{would make}} his stand and wait somewhere in this devilish thicket for Jean {{to catch up with}} him. Many and many a place Jean would have chosen had he been in Queen's place. Many a rock and dense thicket Jean circled or {{approached}} with extreme care. Manzanita grew in patches that were impenetrable except for a small animal. The brush was a few feet high, seldom so high that Jean could not look over it, and of a beautiful appearance, having glossy, small leaves, a golden berry, and branches of dark-red color. These branches were tough and unbendable. Every bush, almost, had low branches that were <b>dead,</b> hard as <b>steel,</b> sharp as thorns, as clutching as cactus. Progress was possible only by endless detours to find the half-closed aisles between patches, or else by crashing through with main strength or walking right over the tops. Jean preferred this last method, not because it was the easiest, but for the reason that he could see ahead so much farther. So he literally walked across the tips of the manzanita brush. Often he fell through and had to step up again; many a branch broke with him, letting him down; {{but for the most part}} he stepped from fork to fork, on branch after branch, with balance of an Indian and the patience of a man whose purpose was sustaining and immutable.|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} support in steel bridges can present {{significant}} challenges during the construction. The tendency of girders to twist or layovers during the construction can present a particularly challenging problem regarding detailing cross-frames that provide bracing to steel girders. Methods of detailing cross-frames have been investigated {{in the past to}} identify some of the issues related to the behavior of straight and skewed steel bridges. However, the absence of a complete and simplified design approach has led to disputes between stakeholders, costly repairs and delays in the construction. The main objective of this research is to develop a complete and simplified design approach considering construction, fabrication and detailing of skewed bridges. This objective is achieved by comparing different detailing methods, understanding the mechanism by which skew effects develop in steel bridges, recommending simplified methods of analysis to evaluate them, and developing a complete and simplified design procedure for skew bridges. Girder layovers, flange lateral bending stress, cross-frame forces, component of vertical deflections, component of vertical reactions and lateral reactions or lateral displacements are affected by detailing methods and are referred as lack-of-fit effects. The main conclusion of this research is that lack-of-fit effects for the Final Fit detailing method at the <b>steel</b> <b>dead</b> load stage are equal and opposite to the lack-of-fit effects for the Erected Fit detailing method at the total dead load stage. This conclusion has helped using 2 D grid analyses for estimating these lack-of-fit effects for different detailing methods. 3 D erection simulations are developed for estimating fit-up forces required to attach the cross-frames to girders. The maximum fit-up force estimated from the 2 D grid analysis shows a reasonable agreement with the one obtained from the erection simulations. The erection sequence that reduces the maximum fit-up force is also found by erection simulations. The line girder analysis is recommended for calculating cambers for the Final Fit detailing method. A combination of line girder analysis and 2 D grid analysis is recommended for calculating cambers for the Erected Fit detailing method. Finally, flowcharts are developed that facilitate the selection of a detailing method and show the necessary design checks...|$|R
40|$|Curved and skewed I-girder bridges exhibit {{torsional}} displacements of {{the individual}} girders and of the overall bridge cross-section under dead loads. As a result, the girder webs can be plumb in only one configuration. If the structure is built such that the webs are plumb in the ideal no-load position, they generally cannot be plumb under {{the action of the}} structure's <b>steel</b> or total <b>dead</b> load; hence, twisting of the girders is unavoidable under dead loads. The deflected geometry resulting from these torsional displacements can impact the fit-up of the members, the erection requirements (crane positions and capacities, the number of temporary supports, tie down requirements, etc.), the bearing cost and type, and the overall strength of the structure. Furthermore, significant layover may be visually objectionable, particularly at piers and abutments. If the torsional deflections are large enough, then the cross-frames are typically detailed to compensate for them, either partially or fully. As specified in Article C 6. 7. 2 of the AASHTO LRFD Specifications, different types of cross-frame detailing methods are used to achieve theoretically plumb webs under the no-load, <b>steel</b> <b>dead</b> load, or total dead load conditions. Each of the cross-frame detailing methods has ramifications on the behavior and constructability of a bridge. Currently, there is much confusion and divergence of opinion in the bridge industry regarding the stage at which steel I girder webs should be ideally plumb and the consequences of out-of-plumbness at other stages. Furthermore, concerns are often raised about potential fit-up problems during steel erection as well as the control of the final deck geometry (e. g., cross-slopes and joint alignment). These influences and ramifications of cross-frame detailing need to be investigated and explained so that resulting field problems leading to needless construction delays and legal claims can be avoided. This dissertation addresses the influence of cross-frame detailing on curved and/or skewed steel I girder bridges during steel erection and concrete deck placement by conducting comprehensive analytical studies. Procedures to determine the lack-of-fit forces due to dead load fit (DLF) detailing are developed {{to assess the impact of}} different types of cross-frame detailing. The studies include benchmarking of refined analytical models against selected full scale experimental tests and field measurements. These analytical models are then utilized to study a variety of practical combinations and permutations of bridge parameters pertaining to horizontal curvature and skew effects. This research develops and clarifies procedures and provides new knowledge with respect to the impact of cross-frame detailing methods on: 1) constructed bridge geometries, 2) cross-frame forces, 3) girder stresses, 4) system strengths, 5) potential uplift at bearings, and 6) fit-up during erection. These developments provide the basis for the development of refined guidelines for: 1) practices to alleviate fit-up difficulties during erection, 2) selection of cross-frame detailing methods as a function of I-girder bridge geometry characteristics, and 3) procedures to calculate the locked-in forces due to DLF cross-frame detailing.
