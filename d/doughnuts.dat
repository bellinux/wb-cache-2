40|$|AbstractThe {{class of}} <b>doughnut</b> graphs is a {{subclass}} of 5 -connected planar graphs. It {{is known that}} a <b>doughnut</b> graph admits a straight-line grid drawing with linear area, the outerplanarity of a <b>doughnut</b> graph is 3, and a <b>doughnut</b> graph is k-partitionable. In this paper we show that a <b>doughnut</b> graph exhibits a recursive structure. We also give an efficient algorithm for finding a shortest path between any pair of vertices in a <b>doughnut</b> graph. We also propose a nice application of a <b>doughnut</b> graph based on its properties...|$|R
