5|$|Created by the god Brahma as {{the most}} {{beautiful}} woman, Ahalya was married to the much older Gautama. In the earliest full narrative, when Indra comes disguised as her husband, Ahalya sees through his disguise but nevertheless accepts his advances. Later sources often absolve her of all guilt, describing how she falls prey to Indra's trickery. In all narratives, Ahalya and Indra are cursed by Gautama. The curse varies from text to text, but almost all versions describe Rama as the eventual agent of her liberation and redemption. Although early texts describe how Ahalya must atone by undergoing severe penance while remaining invisible {{to the world and}} <b>how</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> purified by offering Rama hospitality, in the popular retelling developed over time, Ahalya is cursed to become a stone and regains her human form after she is brushed by Rama's foot.|$|E

When the pair see restaurant Il Gnosh on fire, Gilly rings for help whilst Steph runs into the burning building to save Amy Barnes (Ashley Slanina-Davies) and her children. Gilly stands on a ladder outside and begs her to come out, however she tells him she's ready to die and walks back into the flames. Gilly deals with his grief by becoming angry that Steph has 'left' him. After Rhys tries to comfort him, Gilly goes into Steph's room and trashes it after seeing that she has still kept her photo of her and Max Cunningham (Matt Littler) on their wedding day, placed on a table. Gilly argues with Steph's family as they blame him for not saving her and disagree on the funeral arrangements. Frankie then tells him that Steph had never loved him and that Max {{would have done anything}} to save Steph from the fire, making him further deeply upset and angry.

5|$|In the Ramayana, Sita – the consort of Rama (the {{prince of}} Ayodhya and an avatar {{of the god}} Vishnu) – is seized by Ravana and imprisoned in Lanka, until she is rescued by Rama, who slays her captor. Sita {{undergoes}} Agni Pariksha (an ordeal of fire) by which she proves her chastity before she is accepted by Rama. In some versions of the epic, the fire-god Agni creates Maya Sita, who takes Sita's place and is abducted by Ravana and suffers his captivity, while the real Sita hides in the fire. At Agni Pariksha, Maya Sita and the real Sita exchange places again. While some texts mention that Maya Sita is destroyed in the flames of Agni Pariksha, others narrate <b>how</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> blessed and reborn as the epic heroine Draupadi or the goddess Padmavati. Some scriptures also mention her previous birth being Vedavati, a woman Ravana tries to molest.|$|E
5|$|The king of gods, Indra, was {{infatuated}} with her beauty and comes disguised as Gautama, when the sage was away and requests or orders sexual intercourse. In the Ramayana (the earliest full {{narrative of the}} tale), Ahalya falls prey to Indra's trickery and does not recognize him or is raped. In all narratives, Ahalya and (her lover or rapist) Indra are cursed by Gautama. Although early texts describe how Ahalya must atone by undergoing severe penance while remaining invisible {{to the world and}} <b>how</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> purified by offering Rama (an avatar of god Vishnu and hero of Ramayana) hospitality, in the popular retelling developed over time, Ahalya is cursed to become a stone and regains her human form after she is brushed by Rama's foot. Some versions also mention that she was turned into a dry stream and that she would be condoned of her guilt when eventually the stream starts flowing and joins the river Gautami(Godavari). Indra was cursed to be castrated or be covered by a thousand vulvae that ultimately turn into a thousand eyes.|$|E

500|$|Scott Plagenhoef of Pitchfork Media {{gave the}} song a {{positive}} review naming it the record's best track, {{due to the}} fact that it features Minaj going [...] "toe-to-toe with a huge beat." [...] Additionally from Pitchfork, Tom Breihan stated that Minaj's voice is meant more for rapping than singing and favored [...] "Did It On'em" [...] on that thought. Breihan continued complimenting Minaj, stating that the song recognizes how [...] "beautifully, effortlessly weird she is," [...] and <b>how</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> willing to [...] "contort her voice and persona into pretzel shapes just to induce that oh-shit face in anyone listening." [...] Margaret Wappler of Los Angeles Times called the song [...] "aggressively scatological," [...] and compared the song to the Bangladesh-produced [...] "A Milli" [...] from label-mate Lil Wayne, stating that it fares better musically.|$|E

500|$|The final {{illustration}} of the Hachisuka scroll has no corresponding text section in the extant emaki fragments. However its content can be matched to {{a scene from the}} diary in which Murasaki Shikibu expresses her sorrows as a widow worrying about the future. She relates <b>how</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> gazing dreamily at the moon when she is [...] "hopelessly sad" [...] and lonely. Playing the koto (a kind of horizontal harp) on a cool evening makes her even more miserable. This section of the diary also contains a short description of her room containing two bookcases, one with books that her husband had placed there and that no one has touched since, the other with [...] "old poems and romances", likely referring to her own works. This scene is set on an unknown date in Kankō 6 (1009). The illustration present in the emaki shows Murasaki Shikibu inside a tatami room playing the koto with a court lady walking outside her room on the balcony (engawa).|$|E
500|$|While {{working for}} AVALANCHE, Cloud {{encounters}} Aerith Gainsborough, {{a resident of}} Midgar's slums. Agreeing to serve as her bodyguard {{in exchange for a}} date, Cloud helps Aerith evade Shinra, who pursue her because she is the sole survivor of a race known as the Cetra. Aerith notes that Cloud reminds her of an old boyfriend of hers, who is implied to be Zack Fair. During the course of their travels, a love triangle develops between Cloud, Tifa and Aerith, often exploited to humorous effect. Dialogue choices impact the strength of Cloud's relationship with Tifa and Aerith, as well as with Barret and Yuffie Kisaragi. These interactions determine who accompanies Cloud through the Gold Saucer, an amusement park. If Aerith joins Cloud, she reflects on how strongly Cloud's physical appearance and mannerisms resemble Zack's, and struggles to put into words <b>how</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> still [...] "searching for [...] ". Irrespective of who accompanies Cloud at the Gold Saucer, how the player interacts with Tifa may also result in a more sexually suggestive scene playing out during the night she spends with Cloud before the game's conclusion. Tifa worries instead that the party saw, rather than overheard, the two the morning after.|$|E
500|$|... "You Don't Know What to Do" [...] is a disco revival {{song with}} {{elements}} of gospel, pop and R styles. It lasts for a duration of four minutes and 46 seconds. Several critics highlighted the track as {{following in the}} recent disco revivalism footsteps of Daft Punk, Justin Timberlake and posthumous Michael Jackson material. The song begins with Carey singing about <b>how</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> in a dilemma {{as to whether or}} not she wishes to stay in a relationship with her lover, as he is no longer capable of romancing her. In response, Wale raps about how he is trying to woo her and is asking for a second chance. Carey then decides that it has been too long that Wale has not loved her for, and feels liberated for letting him go. Kenneth Partridge of Billboard likened the string arrangement to Chic's 1979 single [...] "Good Times". Pitchfork Media writer Jordan Sargent compared [...] "You Don't Know What to Do" [...] to Carey's previous singles [...] "Fantasy" [...] (1995) and [...] "Heartbreaker" [...] (1999), but noted that it felt like a [...] "logical extension of post-Pharrell disco revivalism". Christina Lee for Idolator thought that the 70s disco feel embodied Daft Punk's 2013 single, [...] "Get Lucky".|$|E
