It is the largest international terminal in North America, and is the largest building in the world built on base <b>isolators</b> to protect against earthquakes. Food service focuses on quick service versions of leading San Francisco Bay Area restaurants, following other SFO terminals. Planners attempted to make the airport a destination in and of itself, not just for travelers who are passing through. The international terminal is a common-use facility, with all gates and all ticketing areas shared among international airlines and several domestic carriers. Common-use terminal equipment (CUTE) is used at check-in counters and gates. All international arrivals and departures are handled here (except flights from cities with customs preclearance). The International Terminal houses the airport's BART station, adjacent to the garage leading to Boarding Area G. The SFO Medical Clinic is located next to the security screening area of Boarding Area A. All the gates in this terminal {{have at least two}} jetway bridges except gates A2 and A10, which have one. Gates A1, A3, and A11 can accommodate two aircraft. Six of the gates are designed for the Airbus A380, making SFO one of the first airports in the world with such gates when it was built in 2000. Gates A9 (9A, 9B, 9C) and G101 (101A, 101B, 101C) have three jetways for boarding. Four other gates have two jetways fitted for A380 service.|$|E

To exclude any possible effect on airborne transfer of bacteria, the <b>isolator</b> was first examined by means of an airborne particle tracer of the same size as bacteria-carrying particles. Such experiments indicated that the <b>isolator</b> might prevent some transfer out of but not into the <b>isolator.</b> This was not confirmed in simulated nursing experiments nor in a patient study, where the air counts of bacteria were practically the same inside and outside the <b>isolator</b> wall.

Figure 20 a, which is corresponding to Fig. 19 a, shows zero developed inner pounding inside the RNC <b>isolator</b> as a result of buffer deactivation. This is attributed to the selected relatively high design displacement of the RNC <b>isolator</b> of 40.0  cm, which must be exceeded to generate inner pounding inside the RNC <b>isolator,</b> what seems practically impossible under a seismic gap of 35.0  cm with a rigid structure. Contrarily, Fig. 20 b, which corresponds to Fig. 19 b, shows a developed inner pounding within the RNC <b>isolator</b> due to buffer activation. Although the peak inner RNC <b>isolator’s</b> pounding might be comparable to the values of Fig. 19 a of peak structural pounding, the activation of the RNC <b>isolator’s</b> buffer offers more important advantages. For example, it is not only able to reduce or even cause structural pounding not to happen but it also distributes pounding regularly on the isolated base floor’s in-plan area and keeps pounding always within the solid metallic body of the RNC <b>isolator.</b> Accordingly, the RNC <b>isolator’s</b> buffer could prevent structural pounding contact with no severe concentration of pounding forces at a local point or zone anywhere in the RNC-isolated structure, which is generally translated into less arising damage and negative effects.|$|R
