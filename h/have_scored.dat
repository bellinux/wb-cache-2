5|$|At the {{conclusion}} of an inning during which runs are scored after an error or passed ball, the official scorer attempts to recreate {{the events of the}} inning without the errors or passed balls. If in the official scorer's opinion a run would not <b>have</b> <b>scored</b> without the defensive lapses, then the run is unearned. If the scorer believes that a run would <b>have</b> <b>scored</b> anyway, the run is earned and charged to the pitcher. In one basic example, if the first batter reaches by an error, the second batter hits a home run, and the next three batters strike out, then one of the two runs which were scored are unearned. There are rules and restrictions which govern this general guideline.|$|E
