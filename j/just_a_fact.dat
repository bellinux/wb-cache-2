The National SMART Team program is available to teams outside of the Milwaukee-metro area, including Wisconsin and across the U.S. The newest addition to this program is MAPS, this program allows teams of students and teachers to model the unique structure-function relationships of a protein and develop a research question to explore.

5000|$|In 2008, Al Mohler {{declined}} to sign An Evangelical Manifesto, publishing a lengthy explanation for his decision. [...] Mohler is an evangelical and an exclusivist, {{which means that}} he believes Jesus {{is the only way}} through which an individual can attain salvation or have a relationship with God the Father. As a Calvinist, Mohler believes that human salvation is a free gift from God which cannot be earned by human action or will and is only given to the elect. He has publicly advanced this position with respect to Judaism, Islam, and Catholicism. He recently stated that [...] "any belief system, any world view, whether it's Zen Buddhism or Hinduism or dialectical materialism for that matter, Marxism, that keeps persons captive and keeps them from coming to faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, yes, is a demonstration of Satanic power." [...] He believes Muslims are motivated by demonic power and in the months after the September 11, 2001 attacks, Mohler characterized Islamic views of Jesus as false and destructive: I'm no specialist in Islamic theology. I'll let those who are debate {{whether or not there is}} that kind of militancy and warrior culture within Islamic theology. But I want to say as a Christian theologian, the biggest problem with Islamic theology is that it kills the soul.The bigger problem with Islam is not that there are those who will kill the body in its name, but that it lies about God and presents a false gospel, an un-gospel… These are difficult things to say. This is not polite. [...] The secular world tends to look at Islam as a function of ethnicity which means seeking to convert these people to Christianity is an insult to them. But Christianity is a trans-ethnic faith, which understands that Christianity is not particular to or captured by any ethnicity, but seeks to reach all persons.The secular world tends to look at Iraq and say, well, it's Muslim, and that's <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>fact,</b> and any Christian influence would just be a form of Western imperialism. The Christian has to look at Iraq and see persons desperately in need of the gospel.

Many people assume depression is <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>fact</b> of life when you age. The problem addressed in this paper is whether depression in geriatric facilities can be attributed to perceived living arrangements. Using the Geriatric Depression Scale (1) I wished to determine whether living situations can affect overall performance on the test and also determine whether religion had any influence on the resident’s outlook. The results of the GDS scores do not support my hypothesis. There seems to be no correlation between living on independent or assisted living and GDS score. While the hypothesis was not supported, future studies should be conducted to focus on individual life courses and perhaps utilize a design that can evaluate different life histories...|$|E
