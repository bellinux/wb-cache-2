5000|$|An {{example of}} a <b>DNA</b> <b>machine</b> was {{reported}} by Bernard Yurke and co-workers at Lucent Technologies in the year 2000, who constructed molecular tweezers out of DNA.The DNA tweezers contain three strands: A, B and C. Strand A latches onto half of strand B and half of strand C, and so it joins them all together. Strand A acts as a hinge so that the two [...] "arms" [...] - [...] AB and AC [...] - [...] can move. The structure floats with its arms open wide. They can be pulled shut by adding a fourth strand of DNA (D) [...] "programmed" [...] to stick to both of the dangling, unpaired sections of strands B and C. The closing of the tweezers was proven by tagging strand A at either end with light-emitting molecules that do not emit light when they are close together. To re-open the tweezers add a further strand (E) with the right sequence to pair up with strand D. Once paired up, they have no connection to the machine BAC, so float away. The <b>DNA</b> <b>machine</b> can be opened and closed repeatedly by cycling between strands D and E. These tweezers {{can be used for}} removing drugs from inside fullerenes as well as from a self assembled DNA tetrahedron. The state of the device can be determined by measuring the separation between donor and acceptor fluorophores using FRET.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "DNA Ship" [...] is {{described}} in the episode [...] "DNA" [...] (1991) as coming from a later period of Earth's history and having been crewed by a human — who died after the DNA-transforming machine on board caused him to grow three heads. This was an unnamed vessel of extremely advanced construction — {{so much so that}} Rimmer assumed it belonged to aliens intent on returning Glenn Miller. Its most notable feature, however, was the advanced machine for the transmogrification of human DNA. This machine was so advanced it is shown in this episode turning human being Lister into a chicken and back again without lasting effects. Kryten, who has a partially organic brain, accidentally uses the <b>DNA</b> <b>machine</b> in this episode to become human for a time.|$|E

These include {{a description of the}} maximum possible step size, a decrease in the walking efficiency over short distances and a dependency of the efficiency on the walking direction with respect to the origami track. The former two observations were not expected and are non-trivial. Based on this study, we suggest three design modifications to improve future DNA walkers.

50|$|Before he can digest the {{alarming}} news, Kryten is {{startled by the}} evil Lister who has also awoken early. Just as he attempts to take out Kryten, a GELF ship sent by Lister's bride attacks. Boarding, the GELF demand what is theirs and the evil Lister tells Kryten to just {{give them what they}} want, something which Kryten is more than happy to do. The evil Lister realises too late that this means him, and he is dragged out of the airlock. As Kryten muses on this lucky turn of events he realises that Starbug is on fire. The rest of the crew wake just as Starbug plunges into the lava bed of the planet they were heading for. Before Starbug can burn up, it then ends up in an ocean created by the Mayflower. With Starbug damaged, the crew board the Mayflower and find several hundred vials of diverse viruses including positive ones that bestow luck on the infected for a time. Kochanski, after infecting herself for a short while, manages to find more luck virus as well as other vials that will come in handy.

Meanwhile, on Jupiter, General Jackrabbit plans to take over Earth. He goes to Earth on his rocket ship, which lands on the dinosaur museum. Lucy, Ricky, {{and his parents}} notice the skulls on the dinosaur skeletons are gone, which General Jackrabbit stole. Ricky and his Mighty Robot then go the rooftop of the museum. They find the spaceship there. General Jackrabbit then gets some hairs from his tail and puts them in the <b>DNA</b> <b>machine</b> with the dinosaur skulls (the DNA strands were incomplete) and then the machine works. Three eggs pop out of the machine. They then hatch (into a Rabbidactyl, Trihareatops, and a Bunnysaurus Rex). Then General Jackrabbit makes them grow bigger with his [...] "Meany Machiney". The Mighty Robot confronts the Jackrabbits, but General Jackrabbit blasts the Jackrabbits with the Meany Machiney again. The Jackrabbits defeat the Mighty Robot. Ricky wants to save his robot, so he rings the doorbell on General Jackrabbit's rocket ship. Two Robo-Rabbits open the door, replying that they will only accept Jackrabbits. Ricky gets help from Lucy when she disguises herself as a Jackrabbit. The Robo-Rabbits fall in love with Lucy. While the Robo-Rabbits bake food for her, Ricky sneaks upstairs and finds General Jackrabbit with the Meany Machiney. General Jackrabbit smells carrot cake, so he goes downstairs to see what the Robo-Rabbits are up to. Ricky then switches the complex controls from [...] "Big, Ugly 'N' Evil" [...] to [...] "Little, Cute 'N' Sweet" [...] and then zaps the Jurassic Jackrabbits. When the General catches Ricky messing around with his machine, Lucy hits him in the face with a pie. Then, the three rabbits are put into their rocket ship and thrown back to their home planet by the Mighty Robot. Ricky and the Mighty Robot return the dinosaur skulls and bust General Jackrabbit. Lucy finds the little Jurassic Jackrabbits cute, and keeps them as pets.|$|E
40|$|Molecular {{recognition}} between complementary {{strands of}} DNA allows construction on a nanometre length scale. For example, DNA tags {{may be used}} to organize the assembly of colloidal particles, and DNA templates can direct the growth of semiconductor nanocrystals and metal wires. As a structural material in its own right, DNA {{can be used to make}} ordered static arrays of tiles, linked rings and polyhedra. The construction of active devices is also possible [...] for example, a nanomechanical switch, whose conformation is changed by inducing a transition in the chirality of the DNA double helix. Melting of chemically modified DNA has been induced by optical absorption, and conformational changes caused by the binding of oligonucleotides or other small groups have been shown to change the enzymatic activity of ribozymes. Here we report the construction of a <b>DNA</b> <b>machine</b> in which the DNA is used not only as a structural material, but also as 'fuel'. The machine, made from three strands of DNA, has the form of a pair of tweezers.

We conducted fluorescence experiments and show that photo- and thermoregulation is possible.

However, significant challenges remain for the field of DNA computation. New technology is needed to allow multiplexed label-free readout and to enable regulation of molecular state without addition of new DNA strands. These capabilities {{could be provided by}} hybrid bioelectronic systems in which biomolecular computing is integrated with conventional electronics through immobilization of <b>DNA</b> <b>machines</b> on the surface of electronic circuitry. Here we present a quantitative experimental analysis of a surface-immobilized OR gate made from DNA and driven by strand displacement. The purpose of our work is to examine the performance of a simple representative surface-immobilized <b>DNA</b> logic <b>machine,</b> to provide valuable information for future work on hybrid bioelectronic systems involving DNA devices. We used a quartz crystal microbalance to examine a DNA monolayer containing approximately 5 × 10 ^{ 11 } gates cm^{− 2 }, with an inter-gate separation of approximately 14 nm, and we found that the ensemble of gates took approximately 6 min to switch. The gates could be switched repeatedly, but the switching efficiency was significantly degraded on the second and subsequent cycles when the binding site for the input was near to the surface. Otherwise, the switching efficiency could be 80 % or better, and the power dissipated by the ensemble of gates during switching was approximately 0. 1 nW cm^{− 2 }, which is orders of magnitude less than the power dissipated during switching of an equivalent array of transistors. We propose an architecture for hybrid DNA-electronic systems in which information can be stored and processed, either in series or in parallel, by a combination of molecular machines and conventional electronics. In this architecture, information can flow freely and in both directions between the solution-phase and the underlying electronics via surface-immobilized <b>DNA</b> <b>machines</b> that provide the interface between the molecular and electronic domains...|$|R

40|$|Our {{ability to}} {{synthesize}} nanometer-scale particles with desired shapes and compositions offers the exciting prospect of generating {{new functional materials}} and devices by combining the particles in a controlled fashion into larger structures. Self-assembly can achieve this task efficiently, but {{may be subject to}} thermodynamic and kinetic limitations: Reactants, intermediates and products may collide with each other throughout the assembly timecourse to produce non-target instead of target species. An alternative approach to nanoscale assembly uses information-containing molecules such as DNA 1 to control interactions and thereby minimize unwanted crosstalk between different components. In principle, this method should allow the stepwise and programmed construction of target products by fastening individually selected nanoscale components – much as an automobile is built on an assembly line.

The field has made possible the creation of programmable DNA molecules that perform complex calculations and autonomous <b>DNA</b> <b>machines.</b> Random numbers are a sequence of numbers that lack any pattern. A random number Generator (RNG) is a computational device designed to generate random numbers. The many applications of random numbers include cryptography, statistical sampling, numerical simulation of physical and biological systems, and lotteries. Random numbers are usually generated by sampling entropy in physical phenomena and processing it through a computer. Examples of such phenomena include a radioactive source, atmospheric noise, and quantum mechanics. Random numbers are hard to characterize mathematically, such that even though there exists several statistical tests to verify the absence of certain patterns in a stream of numbers, no finite set of tests exists for characterizing randomness in numbers, as there may be patterns not considered by such tests. This paper discusses the generation of pseudorandom numbers from DNA Watson-Crick units. 1000 numbers from an experimental DNA segment passed two statistical tests for randomness.
