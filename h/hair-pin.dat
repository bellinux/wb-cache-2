The camp is bordered on the east and south by the Ventana Wilderness; on the north by the Los Padres National Forest; and on the west by both the Los Padres Forest and Mount Pico Blanco, which is private property owned by Graniterock.|$|E
60|$|And {{that reminds}} me of a trifle. Any time you want to you can glance around the carpet of a Pullman car, and go and pick up a hair-pin; but not to save your life can you get any woman in that car to {{acknowledge}} that <b>hair-pin.</b> Now, isn't that strange? But it's true. The woman who has never swerved from cast-iron veracity and fidelity in her whole life will, when confronted with this crucial test, deny her <b>hair-pin.</b> She will deny that <b>hair-pin</b> before a hundred witnesses. I have stupidly got into more trouble and more hot water trying to hunt up the owner of a <b>hair-pin</b> in a Pullman than by any other indiscretion of my life.|$|E
60|$|His guest was {{cleaning}} his pipe with a <b>hair-pin,</b> that his quick eye had detected on the carpet.|$|E
60|$|In fact, {{although}} {{it was such a}} small shop it sold nearly everything--except a few things that you want in a hurry--like bootlaces, <b>hair-pins</b> and mutton chops.|$|R
5000|$|Should IP {{shuffling}} not be enabled, {{the call}} would be <b>hair-pinning</b> or tromboning through the Berlin call center to Cape Town, utilizing valuable Berlin media processing {{resources for the}} duration of the call.|$|R
60|$|That {{there was}} {{enormous}} elaboration in the picture, from the ornamentation of the <b>hair-pins</b> to the graining of the clogs, did not strike me till {{after the first}} five minutes, when I had sufficiently admired the certainty of touch.|$|R
6000|$|... "My {{brother has}} spoken. It is well. He shall have his dime novel. He shall {{know what kind}} of a <b>hair-pin</b> his sister Mushymush is." ...|$|E
60|$|She {{patted her}} hair into place, and, in {{adjusting}} a <b>hair-pin,</b> permitted a long, thick tress {{to escape to}} her shoulder. She uttered a little squeal of dismay.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Macrae read, 'Glad {{they found}} the <b>hair-pin,</b> it will console the old boy. Do not quite see how to communicate, if Gianesi, who, you say, has arrived, removes the machine.' ...|$|E
60|$|She {{dragged out}} her <b>hair-pins</b> {{and with a}} toss of her head sent the coarse yellow locks flying. Then, {{straightening}} them slightly, {{she pulled out a}} chair and confronted him triumphantly. And at that moment the front-room bell rang.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{always just}} the time I {{particularly}} wish I was a man," [...] she remarked {{after a brief}} return to meditation. [...] "Fancy, no <b>hair-pins,</b> no brushing, no tie-up to get lost about, no strings. I suppose they haven't strings?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Because, as he {{explained}} to me, he thinks it right {{to do the same}} by each of you. The money is yours at this moment,--to buy <b>hair-pins</b> with, if you please. I had no idea that he could command so large a sum." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes, I {{guess that}} Pappa was {{reckoned}} considerable of a crank. A great educational reformer, and a progressive Democratic stalwart, {{that is the}} kind of <b>hair-pin</b> Pappa was! But it is awkward for me, some.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Jones Harvey has a {{scientific}} reputation to look after, and knows {{he would be}} laughed at. That's the kind of <b>hair-pin</b> he is,' said Bude, quoting Miss McCabe. 'By Jove, Merton, that girl--' and he paused.|$|E
6000|$|... 'But, by Jove,' said Logan, 'they {{have heard}} from him, whoever he is, since Bude came back, for they know about the finding of the <b>hair-pin.</b> You,' {{he said to the}} wretched captive, 'have you been at this machine?' ...|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Tiggy-winkle's hand, {{holding the}} tea-cup, was very very brown, and very very wrinkly with the soap suds; and all through her gown and her cap, there were <b>hair-pins</b> {{sticking}} wrong end out; so that Lucie didn't {{like to sit}} to near her.|$|R
6000|$|... "Where {{are your}} Things?" [...] asked Mrs. Wragge, with {{a burst of}} incontrollable anxiety. [...] "I've been upstairs looking in your drawers.

Half {{the girls}} do it, either paint or powder, darken their lashes with burnt <b>hair-pins,</b> or take cologne on lumps of sugar or {{belladonna}} {{to make their}} eyes bright. Clara tried arsenic for her complexion, but her mother stopped it," [...] said Fanny, betraying {{the secrets of the}} prison-house in the basest manner.|$|R
60|$|That curious-looking pin with a Cupid {{on it is}} a lady's <b>hair-pin.</b> The {{necklaces}} are in {{the form}} of serpents, which were favorite symbols with the ancients. The stands of their tables, candelabra, &c., were carved into grotesque or beautiful designs, and even the kitchen utensils were made graceful with figures of exquisite workmanship, and were sometimes fashioned out of silver.|$|E
6000|$|... “Wicked is the word,” said Richardson; “I’m a good Conservative and I’ve no {{patience}} with this Socialist foolery, asking your pardon. It’s tyranny, that’s what it is, {{all along the}} line, but I’ve my living to make, same as other people, and I’ve got {{to belong to the}} union. I couldn’t touch another <b>hair-pin</b> without a strike permit, not if you was to double my wages.” ...|$|E
60|$|Naturally {{their faith}} is shaken. They {{feel that a}} man like that cannot {{possibly}} know anything about Woman or any other subject except where to go for a vegetarian lunch, and the next moment they have put down the <b>hair-pin</b> and the child is seven-and-six in hand and the author his ten per cent., or whatever it is, to the bad. And all because of a photograph.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, of course, you know, it isn't {{as if they}} were--English." [...] Mrs. Erwin flung {{down three}} <b>hair-pins</b> upon her dressing-case, and visibly despaired. [...] "Of course you don't expect your countrymen--" [...] His wife's {{appearance}} was here so terrible that he desisted, and resumed by saying, [...] "Don't be vexed, my dear. I--I rather like it, you know. It {{strikes me as a}} genuine bit of American civilization." ...|$|R
6000|$|Nevertheless, {{they decided}} to take the risk of these bicycles, and they decided their costumes should be brown {{stockings}} and sandals, and cheap unbleached sheets with a hole cut in the middle, and wigs and beards of tow. The rest their normal selves! [...] "The Desert Dervishes," [...] they would call themselves, and their chief songs would be those popular ditties, [...] "In my Trailer," [...] and [...] "What Price <b>Hair-pins</b> Now?" ...|$|R
6000|$|The first {{hard work}} Johnny did of a morning {{was to look}} over the house for {{fugitive}} pins, needles, <b>hair-pins,</b> matches, and other unconsidered trifles; and if he sometimes found these where nobody had lost them, he made such reparation as was in his power by losing them again where nobody but he could find them. In the course of time, when he had garnered a good many, he would [...] "realize," [...] and bank the proceeds.|$|R
6000|$|She opened Penelope's {{door without}} knocking, and went in. Penelope {{sat at the}} window, as in the morning. Irene {{did not go to}} her; but she went and laid a gold <b>hair-pin</b> on her bureau, and said, without looking at her, [...] "There's a pin that I got to-day, because it was like his sister's. It won't become a dark person so well, but you can have it." ...|$|E
6000|$|On {{arriving}} at the Castle Logan and Merton found poor Mr. Macrae comparatively cheerful. Bude and Lady Bude had told what they had gleaned, and the millionaire, recognising his daughter's <b>hair-pin,</b> had all but broken down. Lady Bude herself had wept as he thanked her for this first trace, this endearing relic, of the missing girl, and he warmly welcomed Merton, who had detected the probable meaning of the enigmatic 'Seven Hunters.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Claire was {{whispering}} to Milt, [...] "If {{we can get}} rid of your dreadful passenger, I do want you to meet Mr. Saxton. He may be of use to you some day. He's terribly capable, and really quite nice. Think! He happened to be out here, and he traced me by telephone--oh, he treats long-distance 'phoning as I do a <b>hair-pin.</b> He brought down the duckiest presents--divertissements for dinner, and that knitted robe, and some real René Bleuzet perfume--I was all out of it---- And after the grime of the road----" ...|$|E
60|$|Which {{one should}} have {{audience}} first was a delicate question to decide. The man, on being appealed to, said he would prefer to leave it to them. They accordingly discussed the matter among themselves. At {{the end of a}} quarter of an hour, the victor, having borrowed some <b>hair-pins</b> and a looking-glass from our char-woman, who had slept in the house, went upstairs, while the remaining fourteen sat down in the hall, and fanned themselves with their bonnets.|$|R
40|$|MicroRNAs(miRNA) {{are small}} {{molecular}} non-coding RNAs that have {{important roles in}} the post-transcriptional mechanism of animal and plant. They are commonly 21 - 25 nucleotides (nt) long and derived from 60 - 90 nt RNA hairpin structures, called miRNA hairpins. A larger num-ber of sequence segments in the human genome have been computationally identified with such 60 - 90 nt hairpins, however a {{majority of them are}} not miRNA hairpins. Most computational meth-ods so far for predicting miRNA hairpins were based on a two-class classifier to distinguish between miRNA hairpins and other sequence segments with hairpin structures. The difficulty of these methods is how to select hairpins as negative examples of miRNA hairpins in the classifier-training datasets, since only a few miRNA hairpins are available. Therefore, their classifier may be mis-trained due to some false negative examples of the training dataset. In this paper, we introduce a one-class support vector machine (SVM) method to predict miRNA <b>hair-pins</b> among the hairpin structures. Different from existing methods for predicting miRNA hairpins, the one-class SVM model is trained only on the information of the miRNA class. We also illus-trate some examples of predicting miRNA <b>hair-pins</b> in human chromosomes 10, 15, and 21, where our method overcomes the above disad-vantages of existing two-class methods...|$|R
6000|$|Well, why didn't he? There is the {{doctrine}} of election. [...] "The election hath obtained it; and the rest were blinded." [...] John was some six years older than Rose. He had romped with her as a little girl, drawn her on his sled, picked up her <b>hair-pins,</b> and worn her tippet, when they had skated together as girl and boy. They had made each other Christmas and New Year's presents all their lives; and, to say the truth, loved each other honestly and truly: nevertheless, John {{fell in love with}} Lillie, and married her. Did you ever know a case like it? ...|$|R
60|$|Barbara {{would have}} given her pearl {{necklace}} {{to know what the}} letter contained; but she could not open and read it by the aid of steam, or a pen-handle, or a <b>hair-pin,</b> or any of the generally approved methods, because her position in society forbade such an act. She had tried to read some of the lines of the letter by holding the envelope up to a strong light and pressing it hard against the paper, but Gilbert had too good a taste in stationery to make that possible.|$|E
60|$|The baby of whom Nanny Stocks {{was now the}} {{guardian}} was baby Gurwood, and a strong resemblance it bore to the old baby in the matters of health, strength, fatness, and self-will. Miss Stocks {{was one of those}} human evergreens which years appear to make no impression on at all. From her shoe-latchet to her topmost <b>hair-pin</b> she was unalterably the same as she had been in days gone by. She treated the new baby, too, as she had treated the old--choked it with sweetmeats and kisses, and acted the part of buffer to its feet and fists.|$|E
60|$|A tall, fair lady, with {{a profile}} like Marie Antoinette; she {{dressed in white}} with violet ribbons, and wore much ancient jewelry. A loud-voiced, {{energetic}} woman, who bewailed the sack of her house at Lyons, scolded her children, and cursed the Germans with equal volubility and spirit. When silent she was {{the picture of a}} patrician beauty; but, alas! her voice destroyed the charm, and her manners--great heavens, what things that woman did! Picking her pearly teeth with a <b>hair-pin,</b> and knocking her darlings into their chairs with one sweep of her elbow when they annoyed her at table, were the least of the horrors she perpetrated.|$|E
6000|$|In {{this place}} of busy vulcans--each {{of whom was}} the beau-ideal of [...] "the village blacksmith," [...] all the smaller work of the railway was done. As a {{specimen}} of this smaller work, Will Garvie drew Mrs Marrot's {{attention to the fact}} that two vulcans were engaged in twisting red-hot iron bolts an inch and a half thick into the form of hooks with as much apparent ease as if they had been <b>hair-pins.</b> These, he said, were hooks for couplings, the hooks by which railway carriages were attached together, and on the strength and unyielding rigidity of which the lives of hundreds of travellers might depend.|$|R
6000|$|After a {{prolonged}} period he heard a drawer open, and noted the fact as promising. As the old married man, he presumed that it signified the putting away of <b>hair-pins.</b> About now the dashed woman would be looking {{at herself in the}} glass with her hair down. Then she would brush it. Then she would twiddle it up into thingummies. Say, ten minutes for this. And after that she would go to bed and turn out the light, and he would be able, after giving her a bit of time to go to sleep, to creep out and leg it. Allowing at a conservative estimate three-quarters of-- ...|$|R
60|$|Winter {{had almost}} come, and {{unsettled}} weather made her still more dependent upon indoor resources. But {{there were certain}} early winter days in Casterbridge--days of firmamental exhaustion which followed angry south-westerly tempests--when, if the sun shone, the air was like velvet. She seized on these days for her periodical visits {{to the spot where}} her mother lay buried--the still-used burial-ground of the old Roman-British city, whose curious feature was this, its continuity as a place of sepulture. Mrs. Henchard's dust mingled with the dust of women who lay ornamented with glass <b>hair-pins</b> and amber necklaces, and men who held in their mouths coins of Hadrian, Posthumus, and the Constantines.|$|R
