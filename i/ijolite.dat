It is a complex polyphase intrusion made of ultramafic rocks, ijolites-melteigites, carbonatites and related phoscorites. Ultramafic rocks (mainly clinopyroxenites) have been interpreted as cumulates, with variable amounts of trapped interstitial liquid. <b>Ijolites</b> are quite complex: some are aegirine-augite and nepheline cumulates, others are partly recrystallised rocks. Carbonatites and phoscorites (apatite-forsterite-magnetite rocks) are genetically linked; the latter correspond to cumulates of silicate and oxide minerals crystallised from a carbonatitic magma. Two generations of carbonatite have been recognized, calcitic varieties and dolomitic varieties. The three groups of rocks (ultramafic rocks, alkaline silicate rocks and carbonatites) have similar initial Nd-Sr isotopic compositions which suggest their cogenetic character. Apatite is a liquidus phase in the three main lithologies; it presents a continuous chemical evolution trend interpreted in terms of isomorphous substitution 2 Ca 2 + = REE 3 + + Na+, which is compatible with a fractional crystallisation model.

40|$|The Cretaceous BanhadÃ£o {{alkaline}} {{complex in}} southeastern Brazil presents two potassic SiO 2 -undersaturated series. The high-Ca magmatic series consist of initially fractionated olivine (Fo 92 - 91) + diopside (Wo 48 - 43 En 49 - 35 Ae 0 - 7), {{as evidenced by}} the presence of xenocrysts and xenoliths. In that sequence, diopside (Wo 47 - 38 En 46 - 37 Ae 0 - 8) + phlogopite + apatite + perovskite (Prv > 92) crystallized to form the phlogopite melteigite and led to the Ca enrichment of the magma. Diopside (Wo 47 - 41 En 32 - 24 Ae 3 - 14) continued to crystallize as an early mafic mineral, followed by nepheline (Ne 74. 8 - 70. 1 Ks 26. 3 - 21. 2 Qz 7. 6 - 0. 9) and leucite (Lc 65 - 56) and subsequently by melanite and potassic feldspar (Or 85 - 99 Ab 1 - 7) to form melanite <b>ijolites,</b> wollastonite-melanite urtites and melanite-nepheline syenites. Melanite-pseudoleucite-nepheline syenites are interpreted to be a leucite accumulation. Melanite nephelinite dykes are believed to represent some of the magmatic differentiation steps. The low-Ca magmatic series is representative of a typical fractionation of aegirine-augite (Wo 36 - 29 En 25 - 4 Ae 39 - 18) + alkali feldspar (Or 57 - 96 Ab 3 - 43) + nepheline (Ne 76. 5 - 69. 0 Ks 19. 9 - 14. 4 Qz 15. 1 - 7. 7) + titanite from phonolite magma. The evolution of this series from potassic nepheline syenites to sodic sodalite syenites and sodalitolites is attributed to an extensive fractionation of potassic feldspar, which led to an increase of the NaCl activity in the melt during the final stages forming sodalite-rich rocks. Phonolite dykes followed a similar evolutionary process and also registered some crustal assimilation. The mesocratic nepheline syenites showed interactions with phlogopite melteigites, such as compatible trace element enrichments and the presence of diopside xenocrysts, which were interpreted to be due to a mixing/mingling process of phonolite and nephelinite magmas. The geochemical data show higher TiO 2 and P 2 O 5 contents and lower SiO 2 contents for the high-Ca series and different LILE evolution trends and REE chondrite-normalized patterns as compared to the low-Ca series. The 87 Sr/ 86 Sr, 143 Nd/ 144 Nd, 206 Pb/ 204 Pb and 208 Pb/ 204 Pb initial ratios for the high-Ca series (0. 70407 - 0. 70526, 0. 51242 - 0. 51251, 17. 782 - 19. 266 and 38. 051 - 39. 521, respectively) were slightly {{different from those of the}} low-Ca series (0. 70542 - 0. 70583, 0. 51232 - 0. 51240, 17. 758 - 17. 772 and 38. 021 - 38. 061, respectively). For both series, a CO 2 -rich potassic metasomatized lithospheric mantle enriched the source with rutile-bearing phlogopite clinopyroxenite veins. Kamafugite-like parental magma is attributed to the high-Ca series with major contributions from the melting of the veins. Potassic nephelinite-like parental magma is assigned to the low-Ca series, where the metasomatized wall-rock played a more significant role in the melting process...|$|R
50|$|The 1911 Britannica {{described}} borolanite as: one of {{the most}} remarkable rocks of the British Isles, found on the shores of Loch Borolan (Loch Borralan) in Sutherland, after which it has been named. In this locality there is a considerable area of granite rich in red alkali feldspar, and passing, by diminution in the amount of its quartz, into quartz-syenites and syenites. At the margins of the outcrop patches of nepheline syenite occur; usually the nepheline is decomposed, but occasionally it is well preserved; the other ingredients of the rock are brown garnet (melanite) and aegirine. The abundance of melanite is very unusual in igneous rocks, though some syenites, leucitophyres, and aegirine-felsites resemble borolanite in this respect. In places the nepheline syenite assumes the form of a dark rock with large rounded white spots. These last consist of an intermixture of nepheline or sodalite and alkali-feldspar. From the analogy of certain leucite syenites which are known in Arkansas, it is very probable that these spots represent original leucites which have been changed into aggregates of the above-named minerals. They resemble leucite in their shape, but have not yet been proved to have its crystalline outlines. The pseudo-leucites, as they have been called, measure one-quarter to three-quarters of an inch across. The dark matrix consists of biotite, aegirine-augite and melanite. Connected with the borolanite there are other types of nepheline syenite and pegmatite. In Finland, melanite bearing nepheline rocks have been found and described as <b>ijolite,</b> but the only other locality for melanite-leucite-syenite is Magnet Cove igneous complex in Arkansas.|$|E

40|$|Of the ten Tertiary and pre-Tertiary {{alkaline}} igneous centres in Eastern Uganda, three (Budeda, Tororo and Toror) {{are described}} in this thesis, and a summary of a fourth (Napak) is presented. The earliest intrusive rock at Budeda and Napak is melteigite/pyroxenite which in both areas becomes converted to variable <b>ijolite</b> by replacement {{in the form of}} diffuse patches and well-defined veins. Melanite, wollastonite and calcite are characteristic of later phases of <b>ijolite</b> at Napak and Tororo. Nepheline syenites are produced by the development of feldspar in the marginal zone of the ijolites. At Budeda, cancrinite and calcite also occur in these rocks. They show intrusive relations with the fenites but are gradational towards the <b>ijolite.</b> At Napak, the cancrinite syenites and related feldspathic types occur as dyke-like masses within the <b>ijolite.</b> Feldspathization also affects the mixed rocks of the agglomerate (including <b>ijolite</b> and nepheline syenite) adjacent to the carbonatite at Tororo, locally producing orthoclasites. At Toror, the gneisses around the carbonatite are in places converted to feldspathic fenites (potash-feldspar rocks). Feldspathic breccias and intrusive rocks of similar composition (about 12 % K 2 O) include trachytes, which evidently represent the mobilized products. The carbonatite at Budeda is a small mass formed by the replacement of melteigite, but at the other complexes it is clearly intrusive. Pyroxene, biotite and magnetite are considered to be derived from assimilated silicate rocks. Around the intrusive complexes fenites were formed by alkali metasomatism of the Basement. At Budeda syenitic fenites are widely developed, and have a foliated character which is related to early crushing. Locally the Budeda fenites are nepheline-bearing; they are also extensively feldspathized. The writer finds no direct evidence (with the exception of the trachytes) of mobilization of fenites to give rocks of the intrusive series. The intrusive rocks are considered to be derived from a melanephelinite magma, which by differentiation and the retention of volatiles led ultimately to the formation of a carbonatite residuum. <p...|$|E
40|$|The multi-centred carbonatitic {{complex of}} Homa Mountain {{consists}} of a central cone sheet complex intruded into a domed area of country rock, surrounded by further arcuate zones of intrusive activity. The earlier events included intrusion of a body of <b>ijolite,</b> {{as a series of}} discontinuous bodies probably connected at depth. Later events include at least five stages of carbonatite intrusion and also numerous carbonatitic breccias. Syenitic rocks formed by concentration of late stage material at the margins of the <b>ijolite</b> which deuterically altered the <b>ijolite</b> and metasomatised the country rock to fenite contemporaneously. Minerals formed at such contacts are low temperature, potash-rich, orthoclase and aegirine with apatite the chief minor constituent. A second style of fenitization is recognized involving net veining of more widespread areas of country rock away from <b>ijolite</b> contacts. This reaches its climax in arcuate zones of shearing and brecciation within the central high ground. Where there is evidence of partial melting of such fenites to iron oxide-bearing trachytes. Coarse feldspathic rocks also carrying iron oxides are present near ijolites and early carbonatites. The feldspar in these is very similar to that in the fenites. Metasomatism at Homa is believed to involve introduction of large amounts of juvenile potash only, much of the soda being derived by redistribution of that already present in the country rock. A period of erosion during which superficial, lacustrine and possibly pyroclastic deposits were laid down then occurred and the mountain reduced to near its present topography. Following this erosional interval small scale vents of breccia and melilite-bearing material were intruded. The melilitites show all stages of replacement by carbonate.

The major rock types exposed within the complex are melilitolite, pyroxenite, <b>ijolite</b> series (melteigite-ijolite-urtite), nepheline syenite, carbonatite and alnÃ¶ite dykes. Melilitolite is only exposed within the SÃ¶rÃ¥ker intrusion. The intrusive sequence is melilitolite â pyroxenite â <b>ijolite</b> series â nepheline syenite â carbonatite â alnÃ¶ite. Mineralogical, whole rock geochemical and radiogenic isotope (Nd-Sr-Pb) studies of exposed rocks from the AlnÃ¶ alkaline complex, east central Sweden, were performed in order to investigate the genetic relationships between the diverse rock-types, and to evaluate the contributions from mantle and crustal components in {{the genesis of the}} complex. Most analysed samples fall within the depleted quadrant in a eNd-eSr diagram, similar to carbonatites and alkaline silicate rocks from other complexes, indicating derivation of parental magma(s) from a source that had experienced time-integrated depletion in LIL elements. Contamination by local crust is indicated by Sr and Pb isotope data, but is geographically restricted to samples collected from the outer parts of the main intrusion and from satellite intrusions. This localized contamination is attributed to selective hydrothermal element leaching of surrounding bedrock during fenitization. Nd- and Sr-isotope data separates the carbonatites into two groups (group I and II), each related to a specific set of silicate rock types. The overlap of group II carbonatites with <b>ijolite</b> and nepheline syenite could indicate a common origin through liquid immiscibility but this hypothesis cannot be confirmed by trace element data because initial concentrations are obscured by fractionation processes. Interestingly, results from AFC-modelling suggest that production of <b>ijolite</b> residual magma requires addition of a small volume (2. 4 %) of carbonatite component to the parental magma, whereas formation of nepheline syenite residuals requires removal of an almost equal amount of carbonatite (1. 5 %) to yield a statistically significant result. AFC-modelling further suggests that the various silicate rock types exposed within the complex are related to the same parental olivine-melilitite magma through crystal fractionation of olivine, melilite, clinopyroxene, nepheline, Ti-andradite and minor phases. These results agree with compositional trends exhibited by clinopyroxene and Ti-andradite from the silicate rocks of the main intrusion, which suggests co-genesis of pyroxenite, <b>ijolite</b> series rocks and nepheline syenite. Production of ijolite-like residual liquids can be achieved by 80 % fractionation. An investigation of the origin of silicate minerals in carbonatites suggest that most silicate minerals observed in the carbonatites on AlnÃ¶ Island are derived from surrounding wall-rock and/or produced through corrosive interaction between carbonatite liquid and assimilated phases. This leads to ambiguities when addressing the possible genetic link between carbonatites and associated silicate rocks as occurrences of identical âliquidusâ phases in inferred immiscible liquids may not actually be such...|$|E

The new compositional data for individual perovskite and apatite grains from both carbonatite and associated alkaline silicate rocks are highly variable and indicative of open system behavior. In situ Sr and Nd isotopic compositions for these two minerals are also variable and support the involvement of several mantle sources. U-Pb ages for both perovskite and apatite define a bimodal distribution, and range between 113 and 135 Ma, which overlaps the range of ages reported previously for Oka and the entire MIP. The overall distribution of ages indicates that alnÃ¶ite was intruded first, followed by okaite and carbonatite, whereas <b>ijolite</b> defines a bimodal emplacement history.

CO 2 - rich, aqueous inclusions, which contain substantial amounts of alkalis, predominate in apatites from these carbonatites. The Na+:K+ weight ratio was found to be in the range 2. 4 - 16. 0. Significant amounts of ore metals are also present, as shown by the occurrence of minute, magnetic, crystalline specks within the inclusion fluid. It is concluded that the carbonatitic fluid from which the apatites crystallised, consisted of a highly mobile, CO 2 - rich, aqueous saline fluid. Homogenisation temperatures, which represent the minimum formation temperature of the apatites, ranged from about 200 Â°C to 485 Â°C. The mode of homogenisation of one sample, the Uyi carbonatite, indicated that this fluid was supercritical. A higher estimate of the formation temperature (500 - 590 Â°C) of the apatites from this sample was obtained from the solution temperature of a transient phase (probably Na 2 CO 3) precipitated from the inclusion fluid at high temperatures during heating-runs. Melt inclusions predominate in apatites from the Wasaki ijolites. Carbonate-rich and silicate-rich inclusions are co-genetic in the apatites from some samples. Heating studies have shown that liquid immiscibility between carbonate-rich and silicate melts can occur in ijolitic magmas. Aqueous, CO 2 -rich, saline fluids may also occur in these magmas.

The latter, which has cuspidine, sodalite and monticellite as primary liquidus phases, is considered to have been formed by the complete assimilation of ijolitic material in a natrocarbonatite magma at depth in the volcano conduit. The occurrence of trace amounts of cuspidine, Fe-Mn-monticellite, K-Fe sulphide and Mn-Ti-spinel in recently erupted natrocarbonatites is ascribed to similar, but less extensive, assimilation of silicate material prior to their eruption...|$|E
40|$|Lapilli and unusually thick, high {{viscosity}} lavas extruded from Oldoinyo Lengai in June, 1993 {{are composed of}} crystal-rich natrocarbonatite containing {{a small proportion of}} porphyritic silicate spheroids. The silicate spheroids are of wollastonite nephelinite mineralogy, but they also contain natrocarbonatite mineral grains and aggregates (a) in glass inclusions within nepheline and pyroxene phenocrysts, and (b) within the fine-grained silicate groundmass of the spheroids. The chemical relationships of the natrocarbonatite component in the spheroids to the dominant silicate fraction are consistent with liquid immiscibility, as are the multiple stages of unmixing. These direct observations confirm the intimate relationship between natrocarbonatite and wollastonite nephelinite inferred both from the field relationships at Oldoinyo Lengai, and from low-PT experimentation. The plutonic equivalent (wollastonite <b>ijolite)</b> of the magma type found to be parental to natrocarbonatite at Oldoinyo Lengai does occur in other carbonatite complexes of differing ages and wide geographical distribution; hence {{it is possible that the}} generation of natrocarbonatite is not unique to Oldoinyo Lengai. Certain features in the matrix of the carbonatite flows (coarser grain size, breakdown of solid-solutions observed in earlier, rapidly chilled lavas) are attributed to the relatively slow cooling of these atypically thick flows...|$|E
40|$|For {{approximately}} the last 50 years eruptions at Oldoinyo Len-gai have produced passive natrocarbonatite lavas interspersed with mixed silicateânatrocarbonatite events approximately every 15 - 25 years. In 1993 an unusual blocky lava erupted and. pre-served detailed mixed silicateânatrocarbonatite textures clearly indicating an immiscible origin. The 1993 blocky flow consists of natrocarbonatite with small silicate crystal aggregates which constitute ~ 2 â 5 % of the rock. These inclusions are composed ofnepheline, melanite, clinopyroxene and wollastonite occurring both as isolated crystals and <b>ijolite</b> micro-xenoliths. Most sig-nificantly, these ijolitic inclusions {{are surrounded by}} globules ' of a fine-grained intergrowth of nepheline, wollastonite and gre-goryite, interpreted as quenched melt Petrographic textures are characteristic of liquid immiscibility between coexisting natro-carbonatite and silicate melts. The presence ofgregoryite within the silicate melt globules is particularly important as it repre-sents the common liquidus phase between the silicate and natrocarbonatite melts theoretically required to demonstrate immiscibility between two conjugate liquids. This {{is the first time}} that liquid immiscibility has been so clearly demonstrated in natural rock samples from Oldoinyo Lengai and agrees very closely with recent experimental work. Our detailed model for the petrogenesis of the natrocarbonatites at Oldoinyo Lengai involves extensive fractionation of a carbonate-rich alkaline silicate magma followed by immiscible separation of natro-carbonatite at low pressures...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY. Nahcolite (NaHCO 3) is {{identified}} and recorded {{for the first}} time from an igneous rock. Often associated with it is another carbonate mineral tentatively identified as kalieino (KHCOa), which has not previously been recorded as a primary mineral in any rock. These minerals occur in inclusions in apatite crystals in ijolites and carbonatites, and indicate that both <b>ijolite</b> and carbonatite magma must have been considerably richer in soda and potash than is indicated by the chemical analyses of the rocks. The identification was made by a combination of microchemical, solubility, crystallographic, and optical determinations. FLUID inclusions in minerals can provide a unique opportunity of studying the physical and chemical nature of crystallizing fluids. The presence of daughter minerals that have precipitated from the fluid inside the inclusion as it cooled are particularly useful in determining the actual composition of ' this fluid, although the difficulties posed by their minute size and inaccessibility often precludes a definite identification of such phases (Roedder, I 972, p. J J 19). By a combination of optical, crystallographic and chemical methods, it has been possible to show that nahcolite is present in inclu-sions in apatites from ijolites and carbonatites of the Wasaki, Ruri, Homa, and Toror...|$|E
40|$|Clinopyroxene {{is a major}} {{constituent}} in most igneous rock types (hornblendite, diorite, syenite, nepheline syenite, camptonite, tinguaite and <b>ijolite)</b> of the DitrÄu Alkaline Massif, Eastern Carpathians, Romania. Phenocryst and antecryst populations have been distinguished based on mineral zoning patterns and geochemical characteristics. Major and trace element compositions of clinopyroxenes reflect three dominant pyroxene types including primitive high-Cr Fe-diopside, intermediate Na-diopside-hedenbergite and evolved high-Zr aegirine-augite. Clinopyroxenes record two major magma sources as well as distinct magma evolution trends. The primitive diopside population is derived from an early camptonitic magma related to basanitic parental melts, whilst the intermediate diopside-hedenbergite crystals represent a Na-, Nb- and Zr-rich magma source recognised {{for the first time}} in the DitrÄu magmatic system. This magma fractionated towards ijolitic and later phonolitic compositions. Field observations, petrography and clinopyroxene-melt equilibrium calculations reveal magma recharge and mingling, pyroxene recycling, fractional crystallisation and accumulation. Repeated recharge events of the two principal magmas resulted in multiple interactions between more primitive and more fractionated co-existing magma batches. Magma mingling occurred between mafic and felsic magmas by injection of ijolitic magma into fissures (dykes) containing phonolitic (tinguaite) magma. This study shows that antecryst recycling, also described {{for the first time in}} DitrÄu, is a significant process during magma recharge and demonstrates that incorporated crystals can crucially affect the host magma composition and so whole-rock chemical data should be interpreted with great care...|$|E
40|$|The {{complex is}} {{composed}} of alkaline plutonic rocks, pyroclastics and carbonatites, whose outcrop pattern is concentric. The alkaline plutonics consist of a. central body of biotite uncompahgrite, turjaite and <b>ijolite,</b> only part of which survives, and small outlying intrusions of carbonatite and nepheline syenite and areas of brecciation, fenitisation and felspatliisation of the basement. The biotite uncompahgrite is formed by the metasomatism of the inner part of a mass of pyroxenite and melteigite, the outer part of which is intruded by ijolitic conesheets and dykes. The pyroclastics, which were emplaced later than the central alkaline plutonics, consist of banded agglomerate, which was formed by fluidisation, and tuffs, which were deposited subaerially and under water. Most of the pyroclastics dip inwards, {{and they have been}} downfaulted along their outer boundary. The main carbonatites have been emplaced in several phases, all of which are related to central foci. They consist of small cone sheets and dykes, a partial ring of coarse micaceous carbonatite, and a plug of banded, magnetite-rich carbonatite. They are associated with brecciation and felspathisation. The complex is intruded by late alkaline silicate dykes. Rangwa is at the centre of a large dissected nephelinite volcano, beneath which the basement has been domed. The central plutonic complex was emplaced before most of the nephelinite eruptions. The pyroclastics on Rangwa are tentatively correlated with conglomerates and tuffs, which occur beneath the main nephelinites the north and northwest of the volcano, and many of the nephelinite lavas and agglomerates of the volcano are thought to have been erupted from a centrally-placed vent on Rangwa. <p...|$|E
40|$|The Iron Hill carbonatite-alkalic {{igneous rock}} complex {{is in the}} Powderhorn mining district, {{approximately}} 40 km south-southwest of Gunnison, Colorado. The complex, which occupies about 30 sq km, was emplaced in metasedimentay and metavolcanic rocks during the later Precambrian or early Cambrian. The main rock types in the complex, from oldest to youngest, are fenite, pyroxenite, uncompahgrite, <b>ijolite,</b> nepheline syenite, and dolomitic carbonatite. The carbonatite is limonitic and forms an elliptially shaped 4 sq km stock. Calcitic and dolomitic carbonatite dikes are also numerous throughout the complex and in the pre-existing rocks. Pyroxenite is the most widespread rock type within the complex, but pyroxene is extensively altered to biotite, phlogopite, and vermiculite. Fenite, which formed through Na, K-metasomatism of the country rocks, typically contains more feldspar and less quartz than the equivalent unaltered country rocks. The other alkalic rock types are less widespread and less well exposed. Parts of the complex are covered by Oligocene ash-flow tuff and alluvial, colluvial, and glacial deposits. Sagebrush and grass cover is moderately dense to very dense at low to intermediate elevations; coniferous tree cover is dense at high elevations and on some north-facing slopes at lower elevations. A new algorithm was used to compute spectral emissivity ratios, independent of any emissivity assumptions. This algorithm has the advantage {{that any of the}} possible emissivity ratios can be computed and, thus, a large variety of composite ratio images can be constructed, which permits examination of various geologic hypotheses based on the spectral properties of the surface materials...|$|E
40|$|The Kalahari Craton was {{initially}} stabilized following cessation of Palaeoproterozoic orogenesis in southern Africa at ca. 1. 8 Ga. Subsequent Mesoproterozoic intraplate magmatism at ca. 1. 4 â 1. 35 Ga formed {{a series of}} alkaline and carbonatitic complexes {{in the southern part}} of the craton. Original volcanic structures are partly preserved in some of the complexes, and a variety of intrusive rocks (e. g., quartz syenite, nepheline syenite, pyroxenite, <b>ijolite,</b> carbonatite) are present. The Premier kimberlite cluster was emplaced in the same region at ca. 1. 2 Ga, but available geochronology indicates that the main alkaline magmatism preceded 1. 2 â 1. 0 Ga orogenesis in the NamaquaâNatalâMaud Belt along the southern craton margin. Another, more extensive intraplate magmatic event at ca. 1. 1 Ga formed the Umkondo Igneous Province, which is recognized over an area of â¼ 2. 0 Ã 106 km 2 on the Kalahari Craton, including a detached fragment now located in Antarctica. Much of the province comprises high-level mafic intrusions, but erosional remnants of basalt lava piles and bimodal basalt/rhyolite assemblages are also present. Most of the mafic rocks are continental tholeiites, but trace-element geochemistry reveals distinct subgroups that cannot be related by crustal-level assimilation/fractional crystallization processes or by partial melting of a uniform mantle source. Geochronological and palaeomagnetic data indicate that enormous volumes of tholeiitic magma were emplaced within the province in a narrow time frame at ca. 1112 â 1106 Ma, which is inferred to record uprise of a mantle plume behind the NamaquaâNatalâMaud Belt...|$|E
40|$|The {{uncommon}} sulfide djerfisherite, ideally K 6 (Fe,Cu,Ni) 25 S 26 Cl, {{occurs in}} the dunite portion of the Guli complex, located in Polar Siberia, Russia. Distinctive features of the Guli complex are its considerable size, ~ 2000 km 2, making it the largest duniteâclinopyroxenite massif in the world, and its complicated geology. The exposed part is composed predominantly (60 %) of variably serpentinized dunite. Melanocratic alkaline rocks cover about 30 %, and other rock types, including melilitolite, <b>ijolite,</b> alkaline syenite and carbonatite, occupy less than 10 % of the area. The sample with the most abundant djerfisherite is a coarse-grained phlogopiteâmagnetite-rich clinopyroxenite. Djerfisherite most commonly occurs in irregular patches of sulfide composed mainly of pyrrhotite accompanied by minor chalcopyrite and rare galena, in a matrix of Ti-bearing andradite, clinopyroxene, phlogopite, plagioclase, apatite and rare zircon, titanite and pyrophanite. It forms crystals generally less than 100 Âµm in size and occurs as irregular single-phase grains or it fills fissures of the silicate matrix and infiltrates phlogopite along its cleavage planes. We provide new data on the physical and crystallographic properties of djerfisherite. Its composition is characterized by an extensive substitution among Fe, Cu and Ni; their reciprocal substitutions are mainly controlled {{by the nature of}} the host rock. The djerfisherite from the Guli complex is Cu-rich and resembles that reported from alkaline rocks. This feature is consistent with the proposal that djerfisherite in the Guli complex crystallized as a primary mineral, during the late-stage fractionation of a highly alkaline melt portion, derived from successive fractional melting of an ascending mantle plume under metasomatic conditions.

The alkali pyroxenite xenoliths represent fragments of an intracrustal complex with Sr-Nd isotope ratios consistent with mantle sources of HIMU-affinity. The crystal structure of diopside from an alkali pyroxenite xenolith with the formula (Ca 0. 95 Na 0. 04) (Mg 0. 65 Fe 0. 133 +Fe 0. 102 + Ti 0. 104 +Al 0. 01) (Si 1. 69 Al 0. 31) O 6 and the lattice parameters a = 9. 773 (2), b = 8. 886 (2), c = 5. 308 (1) [AÂ°] and Ã = 105. 89 (3) [Â°] was refined to an R-value of 0. 025 for 1174 reflections. The mean interatomic distances are: within the Me 1 -O 6 octahedron AÂ°, within the Me 2 -O 8 polyhedron AÂ°. The last value reflects the occupation of this atomic position by significant amounts of Fe 2 + and Ti 4 +. The enlargement determined for the bond length to 1. 657 AÂ° is {{in accordance with the}} site population for this position: (Si 1. 69 Al 0. 31). The molar ratio Fe 2 +/Fe 3 + determined by MoÅ¡ssbauer spectroscopy is equal to 0. 786. The AlIV deficiency in T-sites of clinopyroxene of rims is negligible (up to 0. 019 a. p. f. u.) restricted to sporadic local electron microprobe analyses. The presence of Fe 3 + in the T-position of Si- and Al-poor clinopyroxenes was not confirmed by X-ray structural analyses because of its low quantity. Nevertheless, the MoÅ¡ssbauer spectroscopy measurements (isomer shift of 0. 36 mm/s) imply that Fe 3 + is present only in the Me 1 -O 6 positions...|$|E
40|$|The Kisingiri volcano of Tertiary age, {{consists}} of a pile of lavas and agglomerates 60 - 70 Km. across underlain by Precambrian basement and early Miocene alkaline silicate and carbonatite intrusions. A pyroxenite-ijolite-urtite complex and a micro-melteigite ring dyke are differentiation products of a melanephelinite magma. An uncompahgrite-turjaite complex formed by the reaction of a layered accumulative peridotite body with its own residual fluids. Micro-ijolite/foyaite intrusions originated by differentiation from melanephelinite magma and metasomatism during intrusion. Emplacement of alkaline silicate complexes resulted in doming of the basement to a height exceeding 900 metres and in fenitisation. Four zones have been distinguished in fenites derived from granodiorite, with variation from fenitised granodiorite with minor replacement of quartz by aegirine-augite to a syenitic fenite with all relic features destroyed by granulation consisting of perthite and aegirine-augite. Leucoadamellite, due to high mechanical strength, was less prone to intense granulation and fenitisation. Sodic amphiboles formed in fenitised diorite. A consequence of fenitisation was metasomatism of <b>ijolite</b> to nepheline syenite by diffusion of silicon ions back, from the country rock. Emplacement of sovites was proceeded by extensive brecciation of the basement with potash feldspathisation at depth, and accompanied by intrusion of potash trachytes, tuffs and agglomerates by fluidisation. A considerable time interval followed before nephelinitic volcanism commenced about 19. 6 million years ago. Lacustrine sedimentation occurred on the flanks of the dome. Six hundred metres of lavas (49 %) and aggomerates (51 %) are preserved. In addition to melanephelinite, nephelinite, and mugearite, melilite- and olivine-bearing lavas are common. Phonolite and alnoite only occur as dykes. No overall differentiation with time is present.

40|$|A {{variety of}} primary {{inclusions}} are present within apatite crystals extracted from East African and Swedish ijolites and carbonatites. They provide unique, albeit rather minute, geochemical {{samples of the}} crystallising fluids which were present during the growth of apatite. These inclusions contain varying amounts of solid material and by using the E. M. P., together {{with a combination of}} optical and microchemical tests the major chemistry of the various solid components has been established. In the ijolitic rocks from the Usaki complex of Western Kenya multisolid, carbonate-rich melt inclusions, which consist of alkali-rich carbonates, sulphates, and halides are present. The composition of the Ca-Na-K Carbonates within these inclusions is extremely similar to that recorded for the major carbonate phases from the natrocarbonatite lavas of Oldoinyo Lengai. Silicate glass inclusions are also present in some samples and these consist of two chemically contrasting types, one of which is Na-rich and undersaturated while the other is K-rich and oversaturated. These two glasses appear to show an immiscible relationship. Alkali-rich aqueous inclusions containing nahcolite (NaHCO 3) together with solid inclusions composed of single crystals of calcite are also present within the ijolitic apatites of the Usaki complex. Apatite crystals which occur within late-stage patches of calcite in Alno <b>ijolite</b> pegmatites from Sweden do not contain melt inclusions but are dominated by concentrated aqueous saline types. Individual inclusions often contain up to 6 o% of solids which include nahcolite, kalicine (KHCO 3), alkali chlorides, alkali sulphates and opaque specks. These inclusions formed at lower temperatures (= 450 Â°C-) than the melt inclusions of the Usaki ijolites (= 680 - 950 Â°C). Solid inclusions which contain calcite, pyrrhotite biotite and magnetite have also been recognised. Aqueous-rich inclusions are dominant in the apatites of the Tororo carbonatite of Eastern Uganda but a variety of solid inclusions are also present. The following types have been recognized: calcite, shortite, pyrrhotite and magnetite. It is concluded that these apatites were formed directly from an aqueous-rich alkaline solution at temperatures in the region of 400 Â°C. The majority of inclusions studied contain minor amounts of opaque material and in both ijolitic and carbonatitic apatites pyrrhotite and magnetite have been recognised...|$|E
