2500|$|Cain {{supports}} Israel, {{and believes}} that the US should aid Israel in defending itself. [...] After President Obama said that {{the starting point of}} negotiations for peace between the <b>Israelis</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Palestinians</b> should be based on the 1967 borders with mutually agreed-upon land swaps, Cain said: I was shocked at the president's position, and I was equally shocked that he would unilaterally suggest that Israel would move the borders back which they acquired 44 years ago. [...] This president threw Israel under the bus, there is no way around it. It demonstrates once again the arrogant disregard of this president for the opinion of the American people who like the relationship we have with Israel, and for Israel having the right to make its own decisions.|$|E
2500|$|The {{fact that}} Obama never {{mentioned}} the word [...] "terrorism" [...] or [...] "terror" [...] was positively interpreted {{by many in}} the Muslim street, given that many of them see a 'war on terror' interchangeably as a 'war on Islam'. American conservatives also picked up on this and argued that it weakened Obama's overall message. House Republican leader John Boehner also commented after the speech that Obama [...] "seemed to place equal blame on the <b>Israelis</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Palestinians....</b> I have concerns about that because Hamas is a terrorist organisation". As well, he said, [...] "here he continues to say he will sit down with the Iranians without any preconditions, I just think that that puts us in a position where America looks weak in the eyes of their rulers." ...|$|E

2500|$|Israeli {{officials}} said the British informed them Friday {{that they would be}} withdrawing the monitoring team but did not provide a date. U.S. {{officials said}} the <b>Israelis</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Palestinians</b> were notified as the three British guards on duty at the time departed. Stuart Tuttle, a spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv, said that [...] "The withdrawal decision was made on the ground and not in coordination with the Israelis". Senior U.S. {{officials said the}}y {{had no choice but to}} abandon the facility, even though they realized it might undermine the Palestinian Authority, and that they did not make public their concerns because they believed publicity would have made the U.S. and British personnel the targets of attacks. A senior administration official said: [...] "That is the price we pay. Our first responsibility is the safety of American and British monitors". State Department spokesman J. Adam Ereli denied any coordination with Israel and said: [...] "Such accusations are baseless and ignore the facts, quite frankly".|$|E

In [...] "Property Rights and the 'Right of Return'" [...] professor Richard Ebeling writes: [...] "If a settlement is reached between the <b>Israelis</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Palestinians,</b> justice would suggest that all legitimate property {{should be returned to}} their rightful owners and that residence by those owners on their property should be once again permitted." [...] Attorney Stephen Halbrook in [...] "The Alienation of a Homeland: How Palestine Became Israel" [...] writes: [...] "Palestinian Arabs have the rights {{to return to their homes}} and estates taken over by Israelis, to receive just compensation for loss of life and property, and to exercise national self-determination."

At that point, the Palestinian people will be able to decide which pathway they want to go down; do they want to go down the pathway of having a Palestinian state or do they want to continue down a pathway represented by Hamas and other rejectionist groups that's a pathway of violence and that does not lead to a state".|$|E

Therefore, this work aims at keeping alive the dream that one day the conflict will end with a satisfactory outcome to all parties involved. Moreover, it suggests that, despite the present uncertainties, Jerusalem, as probably the most sensitive component of the just mentioned conflict, could actually become the first Shared City Capital of two independent Nation States, Israel <b>and</b> <b>the</b> yet to be formed State of Palestine.
