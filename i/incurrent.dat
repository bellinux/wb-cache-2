5|$|The Australian swellshark has a stocky, rounded {{body that}} tapers {{significantly}} to the short caudal peduncle. The head comprises {{no more than a}} fifth of the total length and is broad and moderately flattened, with a very short, thick, blunt snout. The nostrils are divided into small <b>incurrent</b> and excurrent openings by short, triangular flaps of skin that do not reach the mouth. The mouth is extremely large, without furrows at the corners. The teeth are numerous and small with multiple cusps; the upper teeth are exposed when the mouth is closed. The large, oval eyes are placed somewhat on the upper surface of the head, and have rudimentary nictitating membranes (protective third eyelids) and ridges underneath.|$|E
5|$|The leopard {{catshark}} is {{the smaller}} and slimmer {{of the two}} Poroderma species. The head and snout are short and slightly flattened, with a somewhat pointed snout tip. Each nostril is split into tiny <b>incurrent</b> and excurrent openings by a three-lobed flap of skin in front, of which the central lobe forms a slender barbel that reaches past the mouth. The horizontally oval eyes are equipped with rudimentary nictitating membranes (protective third eyelids) and placed rather high on the head, with a thick ridge running under each. The mouth is wide and arched, with short furrows at the corners extending onto both jaws; the upper teeth are exposed when the mouth is closed. There are 1830 and 1326 tooth rows {{on either side of}} the upper and lower jaws respectively. The teeth have a narrow central cusp with a pair of small lateral cusplets; those of adult males are slightly more curved than those of females.|$|E
25|$|A modest-sized shark {{reaching}} a maximum known length of , the Japanese bullhead shark has a cylindrical {{body with the}} short, wide head and blunt, pig-like snout typical of the bullhead sharks. The eyes lack a nictitating membrane and are followed by tiny spiracles. Shallow supraorbital ridges are present above the eyes, and the space between them is slightly concave. The nostrils are divided into <b>incurrent</b> and excurrent openings by long flaps of skin that reach the mouth; the <b>incurrent</b> opening is encircled by a groove while another groove runs from the excurrent opening to the mouth. The small mouth is positioned nearly {{at the tip of}} the snout; the front teeth are small with a sharp central cusp flanked by a pair of lateral cusplets, while the back teeth are broad and rounded. There are deep furrows at the corners of the mouth, extending onto both jaws.|$|E
25|$|Both {{marine and}} {{freshwater}} mussels are filter feeders; they feed on plankton and other microscopic sea creatures which are free-floating in seawater. A mussel draws water in through its <b>incurrent</b> siphon. The water is then {{brought into the}} branchial chamber {{by the actions of}} the cilia located on the gills for ciliary-mucus feeding. The wastewater exits through the excurrent siphon. The labial palps finally funnel the food into the mouth, where digestion begins.|$|E
25|$|Freshwater mussels {{reproduce}} sexually. Sperm {{is released}} by the male directly {{into the water and}} enters the female via the <b>incurrent</b> siphon. After fertilization, the eggs develop into a larval stage called a glochidium (plural glochidia), which temporarily parasitizes fish, attaching themselves to the fish's fins or gills. Prior to their release, the glochidia grow in the gills of the female mussel where they are constantly flushed with oxygen-rich water. In some species, release occurs when a fish attempts to attack the mussel's minnow or other mantle flaps shaped like prey; an example of aggressive mimicry.|$|E
25|$|The blind shark has {{a stocky}} {{body and a}} wide, {{somewhat}} flattened head with a blunt snout. The small, oval eyes are situated high {{on the head and}} have strong ridges underneath; the oval spiracles are positioned behind and below and have obvious raised rims. The nostrils are placed almost {{at the tip of the}} snout and have long, tapering barbels in front and well-developed skin flaps and grooves around the <b>incurrent</b> openings. A pair of obvious grooves connect the nostrils to the small, almost transverse mouth. There are 3234 upper tooth rows and 2129 lower tooth rows; each tooth has an upright, awl-shaped central cusp and a pair of lateral cusplets. The five pairs of gill slits are small, with the fifth pair close to the fourth.|$|E
25|$|Like {{other members}} of its genus, the {{northern}} river shark has a stocky body with a high back. The head is wide and flattened, with a broadly rounded snout and minute eyes equipped with nictitating membranes. Each nostril is divided into a very large <b>incurrent</b> opening and a small excurrent opening by a triangular skin flap. The sizable mouth is broadly arched, with short furrows at the corners. Thirty-one to 34 tooth rows are in the upper jaw and 3035 tooth rows are in the lower jaw; the upper teeth are upright and triangular with serrated edges, while the lower teeth are narrower and straight to slightly curved. In the largest individuals, the first few lower teeth from the jaw median are spear-shaped with serrations near the tip.|$|E
25|$|The bluegrey carpetshark has a stout {{body with}} a long, {{slightly}} flattened head. The snout is blunt and looks wedge-shaped from the side. The large eyes are horizontally oval and placed high on the head, each with a strong ridge underneath and a large, round spiracles following immediately behind and below. The nostrils are preceded {{by a pair of}} long barbels, which have an enlarged posterior flap halfway along their lengths. There are well-developed skin flaps and grooves around the <b>incurrent</b> nostril opening, as well as a pair of grooves connecting them to the small, almost transverse mouth. The tooth rows number 3234 in the upper jaw and 2129 in the lower jaw; each tooth has an upright, awl-like central cusp and two lateral cusplets. The five pairs of gill slits are short, with the fourth and fifth pairs more closely spaced than the others.|$|E
25|$|Scrubbing tubes: Water {{before and}} after the animal chamber must be removed. One {{arrangement}} would use a large acrylic column of Drierite (8 mesh (scale), i.e., relatively coarse) upstream (before the push pump, before the animal chamber) to dry <b>incurrent</b> airstream and several tubes with smaller mesh (10-20, i.e., relatively fine) Drierite to remove water after the animal chamber. To prepare a scrubbing tube, make sure there is a small amount of cotton {{at either end of the}} tube to prevent dust particles from traveling to the analyzers. Use small amounts of cotton, say around 0.005 g, just enough to keep the dust out of the tubing. Large amounts of cotton will block air flow when/if it gets damp. Pour the Drierite into the tube with a funnel, tap the tube on the bench to pack the grains tightly (to increase surface area - air + water rushes through loose Drierite, requiring frequent changes of scrubbers), and cap off with a small amount of cotton. To remove carbon dioxide] {{before and after}} the animal chamber, Ascarite II is used (Ascarite II is a registered trademark of the Arthur H. Thomas Co.). Ascarite II contains NaOH, which is caustic (so don't get any on your skin and keep away from water). A scrubbing tube is prepared by placing a small amount of cotton into the tube end, filling one-third of the way with 10-20 mesh Drierite, adding a small amount of cotton, then an additional third of the tube with the Ascarite II, another layer of cotton, followed by more Drierite and capping the tube off with another small amount of cotton. Tap the tube on the bench as each layer is added to pack the grains. Note: Driereite can be used over and over again (after heating in an oven), although indicating Drierite will lose color with repeated drying; Ascarite II is used once and will be considered a hazardous waste.|$|E
500|$|The {{reported}} maximum lengths attained by the {{blackmouth catshark}} varies from [...] for Atlantic sharks and [...] for Mediterranean sharks; a length record of [...] may be dubious. Females attain a larger ultimate size than males. The maximum weight on record is [...] This species has a slender, firm {{body with a}} rather long, pointed snout comprising roughly 6–9% of the total length. The anterior rim of each nostril bears a large triangular flap, which divides the nostril into <b>incurrent</b> and excurrent openings.

The mouth forms a short, wide arch, and bears moderately long furrows around the corners. The upper and lower jaws contain around 69 and 79 tooth rows respectively. Each tooth is small, with a narrow central cusp flanked by one or two smaller cusplets on either side. There are five pairs of gill slits, with the fifth pair over the pectoral fin bases.|$|E
500|$|With its elongated, eel-like {{body and}} strange appearance, the frilled shark {{has long been}} likened to the mythical sea serpent. The head is broad and {{flattened}} with a short, rounded snout. The nostrils are vertical slits, separated into <b>incurrent</b> and excurrent openings by a leading flap of skin. The moderately large eyes are horizontally oval and lack nictitating membranes (protective third eyelids). The very long jaws are positioned terminally (at {{the end of the}} snout), as opposed to the underslung jaws of most sharks. The corners of the mouth are devoid of furrows or folds. The tooth rows are rather widely spaced, numbering 19–28 in the upper jaw and 21–29 in the lower jaw. The teeth number around 300 in all; each tooth is small, with three slender, needle-like cusps alternating with two cusplets.

The water current is utilized for respiration, but also for filter feeding, excretion, and reproduction.|$|E
50|$|Since {{giant clams}} cannot move themselves, they adopt {{broadcast}} spawning. They release sperm and eggs into the water. A transmitter substance called spawning induced substance (SIS) helps synchronize {{the release of}} sperm and eggs to ensure fertilization. The substance is released through a syphonal outlet. Other clams can detect SIS immediately. Incoming water passes chemoreceptors situated close to the <b>incurrent</b> syphon, which transmit the information directly to the cerebral ganglia, a simple form of brain.|$|E
5000|$|Molgula manhattensis is small, spherical, brownish-grey in color, {{somewhat}} translucent, {{and feels}} soft and rubbery to the touch. Like other ascidians, {{they have two}} siphons (<b>incurrent</b> and excurrent), through which they draw water for ventilation and filter-feeding, and also for releasing their gametes. They are hermaphroditic, and release sperm and eggs into the water for external fertilization, unlike some other species of Molgula which may be viviparous (e.g. M. citrina). The tunic is covered with many little fibrils.|$|E
50|$|Early {{bony fishes}} (~420 mya) had two pair of nostrils, one pair for {{incoming}} water (known as the anterior or <b>incurrent</b> nostrils), {{and a second}} pair for outgoing water (the posterior or excurrent nostrils), with the olfactory apparatus (for sense of smell) in between. In the first tetrapodomorphs (~415 mya) the excurrent nostrils migrated {{to the edge of}} the mouth, occupying a position between the maxillary and premaxillary bones, directly below the lateral rostral (a bone that vanished in early tetrapods).|$|E
50|$|In sponges, like Scypha, {{there are}} some cells that have an {{intracellular}} pore. These cells are known as porocytes. They {{are present in the}} Leucosolenia (an asconoid sponge) in the body wall through which water enters the body or they are present in Scypha (a syconoid sponge) as a connection between <b>incurrent</b> canal and radial canal. The pore is called an ostia in asconoid type sponges as it serves as the connection between the outside of the body and the spongocoel but called a prosopyle in syconoid sponges. They are modified pinacocytes.|$|E
5000|$|Ircinia strobilina is {{a species}} of sponge in the family Irciniidae. It is grey or shiny black in colour, with spiny {{structures}} (conules) dotting the surface. The spiny structures are interconnected by ridges, though not arranged in an orderly lattice. This species is globular and massive in shape, but usually no more than 0.3 m across. I. strobilina is lobed and spherical and has a tough consistency. The large excurrent pores are located in depressions {{at the top of}} the sponge. Many smaller <b>incurrent</b> pores are scattered across the surface, more densely at the sides.|$|E
5000|$|Unionidae burrow {{into the}} substrate, with their {{posterior}} margins exposed. They pump water through the <b>incurrent</b> aperture, obtaining oxygen and food. Unionoids remove phytoplankton and zooplankton, {{as well as}} suspended bacteria, fungal spores, and dissolved organic matter. [...] Despite extensive laboratory studies, it remains uncertain as to which of these filtrates unionoids actually process. In high densities, {{they have the ability}} to influence water clarity [...] but filtration rates are dependent on water temperature, current velocity, and particle size and concentration. In addition, gill morphology can determine particle size filtered, as well as the rate.|$|E

In some species, release occurs when a fish attempts to attack the mussel's minnow or other mantle flaps shaped like prey; an example of aggressive mimicry.|$|E
50|$|On their ventral surface {{they have}} a partial head, mouth, mantle, mantle cavity, foot, gills, gonopore, nephridiopore and anus. The ventral surface is bordered with the mantle and moving towards {{the center of the}} chiton is the mantle cavity. There {{they have a}} head on the {{anterior}} end and the foot below it extending to the posterior end of the chiton. The mantle cavity is divided into two chambers by ctenidia that circulate water and waste through the chiton. The gill cilia draw in water through the <b>incurrent</b> chamber and run posteriorly in the excurrent stream where they are discharged.|$|E
50|$|Among the {{characters}} defining tetrapodomorphs are {{modifications to the}} fins, notably a humerus with convex head articulating with the glenoid fossa (the socket of the shoulder joint). Another key trait is the internal nostril or choana. Most fish have two pairs of nostrils, one {{on either side of}} the head for incoming water (<b>incurrent</b> nostrils) and another pair for outgoing water (excurrent nostrils). Early tetrapodomorphs such as Kenichthys had excurrent nostrils that had migrated to the edge of the mouth. In later tetrapodomorphs, including tetrapods, the excurrent nostril is positioned inside the mouth, where it is known as the choana.|$|E
