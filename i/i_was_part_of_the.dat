2500|$|Smith's {{major new}} car program {{prior to the}} 1984 reorganization, GM10 (also known as W-body), has been called [...] "The biggest {{catastrophe}} in American industrial history." [...] Beginning in 1982, and costing $7 billion, {{the plan was to}} replace all midsize cars produced by Chevrolet, Pontiac, Oldsmobile, and Buick. The plan was huge in scope, calling for seven plants that would each assemble 250,000 of the cars, or 21% of the total U.S. car market. It was badly executed from the start, but the 1984 reorganization wrought havoc on the program and it never recovered. By 1989, the year before the last of the original GM10s were launched, GM was losing $2000 on every one of the cars it produced. When asked by Fortune why GM10 was such a catastrophe, Smith replied, “I don't know. It's a mysterious thing. I've said I'll take my share of the blame on all those things. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> team.” Nonetheless, the W-body platform that sprouted from the GM10 program lasted in production in some form until 2016.|$|E

2500|$|Alan Lomax had met 20-year-old English folk singer Shirley Collins {{while living}} in London. The two were romantically {{involved}} and lived together for some years. When Lomax obtained a contract from Atlantic Records to re-record some of the American musicians first recorded in the 1940s, using improved [...] equipment, Collins accompanied him. Their folk song collecting trip to the Southern states lasted from July to November 1959 and resulted in many hours of recordings, featuring performers such as Almeda Riddle, Hobart Smith, Wade Ward, Charlie Higgins and Bessie Jones and culminated in the discovery of Fred McDowell. Recordings from this trip were issued under the title Sounds of the South and some were also featured in the Coen brothers’ 2000 film O Brother, Where Art Thou?. Lomax wished to marry Collins but when the recording trip was over, she returned to England and married Austin John Marshall. In an interview in The Guardian newspaper, Collins expressed irritation that Alan Lomax's 1993 account of the journey, The Land Where The Blues Began, barely mentioned her. [...] "All it said was, 'Shirley Collins was along for the trip'. It made me hopping mad. I wasn't just 'along for the trip'. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> recording process, I made notes, I drafted contracts, I was involved in every part".
