40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. Time-of-use {{electricity}} pricing is characterised by high 'peak' prices, generally {{throughout the day}} and evening, and low 'off-peak' prices, generally at night. Consumers can benefit from time-of-use pricing provided their ratio of peakto- off-peak electricity consumption {{is less than a}} ratio of the relative prices of the two tariffs. To alter their consumption ratio, consumers can time-shift their demand, known as demand response. Consumers with grid-connected PV systems, however, already have reduced net demand during the day-time peak, due to the PV generation. The first question of interest to this paper is whether consumers with PV systems would benefit financially from switching to timeof- use pricing even if they do not engage in demand response. There remains the concern, however, of high prices during the evening peak, when the PV is not generating. Consumers unwilling or unable to engage in demand response during these periods can install battery storage systems, which are charged during the day and discharged during the evening. Two additional questions are therefore: what is the additional financial benefit of battery storage to PV systems with time-ofuse pricing and are batteries financially viable for domestic consumers with PV? These questions are answered using data from real dwellings with PV in the UK and simulating power flows using a published lead-acid battery model. Economic impacts are measured for a range of time-of-use pricing tariffs from the UK and Ireland. Results indicate that PV has little effect on the financial benefit of time-of-use pricing with day period prices that are similar to the <b>flat</b> <b>rate</b> <b>price.</b> For tariffs where the day period price is greater than the <b>flat</b> <b>rate</b> <b>price,</b> PV improves the benefit, but not enough to make it an economic choice for the average consumer. Battery storage improves the financial return, but this is not enough to make the business case positive. Even using optimistic assumptions, such as lossless batteries and high electricity price increase, system costs need to be lowered by at least 33. 5...|$|E
40|$|Part 1 : Autonomic and Smart ManagementInternational audienceMany {{companies}} rent Virtual Machines (VM) from cloud {{providers to}} meet their computational needs. While this option is also available to end-users, they do not always {{take advantage of this}} option. One reason may be that it is common to pay on a per-VM-basis, whereas the telecommunications sector has shown that customers prefer flat rates. A flat rate for cloud services needs to define utilization thresholds, to cap the usage of heavy customers and thereby limit their impact on the <b>flat</b> <b>rate</b> <b>price</b> and the cloud performance. Unfortunately, customers consume multiple heterogenous resources in clouds, e. g., CPU, RAM, disk I/O and space, or network access. This makes the definition of a customer’s fair “cloud share” and according utilization thresholds complex. Backed by a questionnaire among more than 600 individuals, this paper designs the new Greediness Metric (GM) that formalizes an intuitive understanding of multi-resource fairness without access to consumers’ utility functions. This GM enables the introduction of attractive cloud flat rates and fair sharing policies for private/commodity clouds and provides incentive to customers to wisely determine VM configurations...|$|E

Economic analyses on the profit that can be gained from net-metering and exporting to the grid and purchasing electricity at either a <b>flat</b> <b>rate</b> <b>price</b> or at time of use pricing were also conducted. Finally, analyses on emissions was also completed using 2005 hourly emission factors as well as using a flat rate emission factor of 0. 222 kg/kWh. Though there were discrepancies between the softwares, it {{may be due to the}} difference in levels of details between programs. There were greater differences between the TRNSYS and HOT 2000 simulations most likely due to the lack of possible inputs that HOT 2000 requires. In the economic study it was found that it would be highly advantageous to export to the grid at the Ontario Power Authority’s Standard Offer Program pricing and purchase electricity at time of use pricing for the Sustainable Urbanism Initiative townhome. The townhome was found to be able to avoid almost 1. 9 tonnes of CO 2 eq...|$|E

We review in this paper, from a mathematical modeling point of view, the pricing schemes without resource reservation that have been developed in the literature. Indeed, an advantage of the absence of reservation in the Internet is that network management is cheap. Even if accounting and billing will increase this cost, we believe that pricing without resource reservation is the lesser of two evils when costly bandwidth reservation procedures are applied...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Typically {{the cost}} of a product, a good or a service has many {{components}}. Those components come from different complex steps in the supply chain of the product from sourcing to distribution. This economic point of view also takes place in the determination of goods and services in wireless networks. Indeed, before transmitting customer data, a network operator has to lease some frequency range from a spectrum owner and also has to establish agreements with electricity suppliers. The goal {{of this paper is to}} compare two pricing schemes, namely a power-based and a <b>flat</b> <b>rate,</b> and give a possible explanation why <b>flat</b> <b>rate</b> <b>pricing</b> schemes are more common than power based pricing ones in a deregulated wireless market. We suggest a hierarchical game-theoretical model of a three level supply chain: the end users, the service provider and the spectrum owner. The end users intend to transmit data on a wireless network. The amount of traffic sent by the end users depends on the available frequency bandwidth as well as the price they have to pay for their transmission. A natural question arises for the service provider: how to design an efficient pricing scheme in order to maximize his profit. Moreover he has to take into account the lease charge he has to pay to the spectrum owner and how many frequency bandwidth to rent. The spectrum owner itself also looks for maximizing its profit and has to determine the lease price to the service provider. The equilibrium at each level of our supply chain model are established and several properties are investigated. In particular, in the case of a power-based pricing scheme, the service provider and the spectrum owner tend to share the gross provider profit. Whereas, considering the <b>flat</b> <b>rate</b> <b>pricing</b> scheme, if the end users are going to exploit the network intensively, then the tariffs of the suppliers (spectrum owner and service provider) explode. ...|$|R

The concept has held a particular interest because of the high and rising costs of health care delivery despite legislative attempts to address them, such the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare). While there have been pilot programs launched by major insurance carriers such as UnitedHealthcare to control costs in the most costly medical conditions like cancer, for now the primary application of flat-rate pricing has been in medical imaging, such as x-rays, MRIs, mammograms, and ultrasounds. Regional companies such as Med Health Services Inc. in the Pittsburgh area and Northwest Radiology Network of Indianapolis have been among the first in the nation to implement the practice on a trial basis.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In {{the early}} days of mobile Internet, {{bandwidth}} was not an issue, so price plans were quite simple, very often expressed {{in the form of a}} <b>flat</b> <b>rate</b> or “all you can eat ” pricing. As long as capacity was greatly available, this was a convenient and simple way to define a tariff, both for the end-user and the service provider. With the tremendous growth of data traffic observed recently, bandwidth becomes more and more a scarce resource. Consequently, <b>flat</b> <b>rate</b> <b>pricing</b> leads to a minority of heavy users cannibalizing the whole resource, while being subsidized by low users. This is of course not acceptable! It is neither fair for the majority of end-users, nor profitable for the service provider. The goal of this paper is to study how service providers can grant the required quality of service to the “right ” users, in other words to users who will generate revenue for their use. This will improve overall customer experience in the end, while service providers can see the return on their investment in network infrastructure by somehow “monetizing the bandwidth”...|$|R

50|$|The demand {{increase}} in cellular networks {{is fueled by}} a <b>flat</b> <b>rate</b> <b>pricing</b> policy. It promotes heavy-tailed traffic distributions and leads to unbounded demand increase. Nowadays the pricing policy is starting to change because of the unbounded demand increase.Eventually some operators started to charge flat-rate with a cap, {{but this is a}} temporal solution.A more elaborate solution, usage based pricing,is suggested in the literature, but on its own it does not solve the congestion problem in the busy hours.One step further in UIL, a fully dynamic usage-based pricing is suggested.This dynamic price is displayed on a user terminal (UT)so that user can decide to use or not to use the service. The main idea is very clear, the user will generate less traffic when the session price goes up.As a result, the pricing method will change the user behavior and the traffic as in electricity tariffs and smart-grid applicationsand even better than there, because of the immediate feedback and latency in the order of seconds,which allows for best response and training.|$|R
40|$|The {{increase}} in information services on the shared media such as voice over IP is creating an unprecedented demand for bandwidth. As shared media service providers and backbone service providers continue {{to upgrade their}} infrastructure to accommodate this demand, the <b>flat</b> <b>rate</b> <b>pricing</b> schemes and their inherent cross-subsidies will continue to create economic inefficiency and wasteful resource allocation. To pay for the bandwidth that is consumed, IT departments charge costs back to users. This creates some accountability, but the systems that are employed, {{which are based on}} flat-rate connection and port charges, are usually too imprecise to truly motivate users to employ shared media more thoughtfully. One solution being implemented is a change in the economic structure of the IP business through usage-based billing. Usage-based billing refers to any billing scheme where a customer`s bill is scaled in some way to reflect actual use of network services.

Economists concerned with industrial organization and regulation (including antitrust and merger law) initially found new scope for application of their expertise in conventional policy analyses of the Internet’s interactions with other segments of the telecommunications sector (broadcast and cable television, radio and telephone), and emphasized the potential congestion problems posed by user anonymity and <b>flat</b> <b>rate</b> <b>pricing.</b> Policy issues of a more dynamic kind have subsequently come to the fore. These involve classic tradeoffs between greater efficiency and producer and consumer surpluses today, and a potential for more innovation in Web-based products and service in the future. Many such tradeoffs involve choices such as that between policies that would preserve the original ‘end-to-end’ design of the original Internet architecture, and those that would be more encouraging of market-driven deployment of new technologies that afforded ISPs with greater market power the opportunity to offer (and extract greater profits from) restricted-Web services that consumers valued highly, such as secure and private VOIP. public policy, telecommunications, Web-based products, user anonymity...|$|R

The term “managed service ” is coined by operators to describe online-services that have a special agreement with the network operator.
