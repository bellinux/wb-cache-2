500|$|On March 8, 2012, Invisible Children {{released}} an official response addressing the criticisms directed at Kony 2012. As {{an explanation for}} the simplicity of the movie, they stated that [...] "in [...] quest to garner wide public support of nuanced policy, [...] sought to explain the conflict in an easily understandable format." [...] Jedidiah Jenkins, the director of idea development for Invisible Children, responded to the new criticisms by saying that they were [...] "myopic" [...] and that the video itself was a [...] "tipping point" [...] that [...] "got young people to care about an issue {{on the other side of}} the planet that doesn’t affect them." [...] In response to concerns about working with the Ugandan government, Invisible Children explained that they [...] "do not defend any of the human rights abuses perpetrated by the Ugandan government or the Ugandan army". They added that the reason why they are working with the Ugandan army even though Kony is no longer in Uganda is that the army is [...] "more organized and better equipped than that of any of the other affected countries (DRC, South Sudan, CAR) to track down Joseph Kony" [...] and that they want all of the governments in the region to work together to arrest Kony. Jenkins stated, [...] "There is a huge problem with political corruption in Africa. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> purity to say we will not partner with anyone corrupt, we couldn’t partner with anyone." ...|$|E
2500|$|Source-critical {{scholarship}} {{suggests that}} these two roles come from different sources, which later were spliced together to form the Book(s) of Samuel. The oldest {{is considered to be}} that marking Samuel as the local seer of Ramah, who willingly anointed Saul as king in secret, while the latter presents Samuel as a national figure, begrudgingly anointing Saul as king in front of a national assembly. This later source is generally known as the Republican Source, since it denigrates the monarchy (particularly the actions of Saul) and favours religious figures, in contrast to the other main source [...] the Monarchial Source [...] which treats it favourably. Theoretically <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> Monarchial Source we would see Saul appointed king by public acclamation, due to his military victories, and not by cleromancy involving Samuel. Another difference between the sources is that the Republican Source treats the ecstatic prophets as somewhat independent from Samuel (1 Samuel 9:1ff) rather than having been led by him (...)

2500|$|We weren't {{trying not}} {{to put out a}} record. It was just one thing after another and time flew by. When you don't do your band like a career like us, you've got other things to do than worry about getting records made. If you don't put a {{deadline}} on it, it may never get done. Like us, you turn around and it's been six years. The first year or two after the last record, we were still touring and not thinking about making an album. Then, in the third year, we were busy and it took a few months to write and get in the studio. There's lag time at the label and then it's winter... It just goes on and on. When NOFX asked us if we wanted to go on the road with them, {{we thought it would be}} fun, but we thought it would be better <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> record finished. We hadn't planned on being done in October. It was for later in the year, so we had to kick it in high gear and get into the studio. Everything worked backwards from there 'cause if we had fucked it up, we'd be looking at 2009 before the album was done. That deadline really got it all together, but it was only a matter of a few weeks. We'd planned to go into the studio three weeks after we actually did. We'd have only rehearsed with the luxury time, so we were ready. Most of [...] the last 12 months, so it's a new record, not stuff we were sitting on and hadn't recorded. It's also not like we were writing these songs for the last six years. Once we were ready, it came together surprisingly quickly, and I think people will be kind of shocked but happy with the results.|$|E
