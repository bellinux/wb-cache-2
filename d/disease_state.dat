5|$|CDTM is an {{expansion}} of the traditional pharmacist scope of practice, allowing for pharmacist-lead management of drug related problems (DRPs) with an emphasis on a collaborative, interdisciplinary approach to pharmacy practice in the healthcare setting. The terms of a CPA are decided by the collaborating pharmacist and physician, though templates exist online. CPAs can be specific to a patient population of interest to the two parties, a specific clinical situation or <b>disease</b> <b>state,</b> and/or may outline an evidence-based protocol for managing the drug regimen of patients under the CPA. CPAs have become the subject of intense debate within the pharmacy and medical professions.|$|E
5|$|Numerous other {{abnormalities}} {{have been}} described in hepatic encephalopathy, although their relative contribution to the <b>disease</b> <b>state</b> is uncertain. Loss of glutamate transporter gene expression (especially EAAT 2) {{has been attributed to}} acute liver failure. Benzodiazepine-like compounds have been detected at increased levels as well as abnormalities in the GABA neurotransmission system. An imbalance between aromatic amino acids (phenylalanine, tryptophan and tyrosine) and branched-chain amino acids (leucine, isoleucine and valine) has been described; this would lead to the generation of false neurotransmitters (such octopamine and 2-hydroxyphenethylamine). Dysregulation of the serotonin system, too, has been reported. Depletion of zinc and accumulation of manganese may play a role. Inflammation elsewhere in the body may precipitate encephalopathy through the action of cytokines and bacterial lipopolysaccharide on astrocytes.|$|E

25|$|The {{medical history}} is a {{longitudinal}} record {{of what has happened}} to the patient since birth. It chronicles diseases, major and minor illnesses, as well as growth landmarks.

25|$|Mutations in {{the genes}} {{encoding}} for isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 and 2 (IDH1 and IDH2) occur in 10-20% of patients with myelodysplastic syndrome, and confer a worsened prognosis in low-risk MDS. Because the incidence of IDH1/2 mutations increases as the disease malignancy increases, these findings together suggest that IDH1/2 mutations are important drivers of progression of MDS to a more malignant <b>disease</b> <b>state.</b>|$|E

25|$|While many {{medications}} treat Parkinson's, none actually {{reverses the}} effects of the disease or cures it. Furthermore, the gold-standard treatment varies with the <b>disease</b> <b>state.</b> People with Parkinson's, therefore, often must take a variety of medications to manage the disease's symptoms. Several medications currently in development seek to better address motor fluctuations and nonmotor symptoms of PD. However, none is yet on the market with specific approval to treat Parkinson's.|$|E
25|$|Drug {{discovery}} {{is the process}} by which potential drugs are discovered or designed. In the past most drugs have been discovered either by isolating the active ingredient from traditional remedies or by serendipitous discovery. Modern biotechnology often focuses on understanding the metabolic pathways related to a <b>disease</b> <b>state</b> or pathogen, and manipulating these pathways using molecular biology or biochemistry. A great deal of early-stage drug discovery has traditionally been carried out by universities and research institutions.|$|E
25|$|Micropsia that is {{induced by}} macular {{degeneration}} {{can be treated}} in several ways. A study called AREDS (age-related eye disease study) determined that taking dietary supplements containing high-dose antioxidants and zinc produced significant benefits with regard to disease progression. This study was the first ever to prove that dietary supplements can alter the natural progression and complications of a <b>disease</b> <b>state.</b> Laser treatments also look promising but are still in clinical stages.|$|E
40|$|Low {{levels of}} soluble receptors for {{advanced}} glycation end products (sRAGE) {{have been suggested}} to be marker of <b>disease</b> <b>states.</b> However, the levels of sRAGE are elevated in some <b>disease</b> <b>states.</b> The contradictory findings have thrown shadow on the suggested use of low sRAGE as a marker for diseases. In this review, I am going to overview {{the status of the}} sRAGE as amarker of the disease processes. In doing so I am going to briefly describe the basics of AGEs and its cell surface receptor (RAGE) and circulating recep-tors (soluble receptor for AGEs [sRAGE] and endogenous secretory receptor [esRAGE]), the <b>disease</b> <b>states</b> where the levels of AGEs are elevated and the levels of sRAGE and esRAGE are decreased or elevated, and suggest why sRAGE or esRAGE are biomarker for <b>disease</b> <b>states.</b> A better solu-tion for use of sRAGE and esRAGE in combinationwith AGEs as biomarkers of disease is provided. This will put to rest the controversy of use of sRAGE alone as a marker of disease...|$|R

25|$|There is {{evidence}} that prediabetes is a curable <b>disease</b> <b>state.</b> Intensive weight loss and lifestyle intervention, if sustained, may improve glucose tolerance substantially and prevent progression from IGT to type 2 diabetes. The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) study found a 16% reduction in diabetes risk for every kilogram of weight loss. Reducing weight by 7% through a low-fat diet and performing 150 minutes of exercise a week is the goal. In observational studies, individuals following vegetarian diets are about half as likely to develop diabetes, compared with non-vegetarians. The ADA guidelines recommend modest weight loss (5-10% body weight), moderate-intensity exercise (30 minutes daily), and smoking cessation.|$|E
25|$|Hydroxyzine is {{prescribed}} {{when the}} onset of an organic <b>disease</b> <b>state</b> manifests through anxiety, as generalized anxiety disorder, or in other more serious cases as psychoneurosis, and is therefore prescribed {{as a means of}} regulating normal function. Hydroxyzine has shown to be as effective as the benzodiazepine drug bromazepam in the treatment of generalised anxiety disorder. However, a systematic review concluded that compared with other anxiolytic agents (benzodiazepines and buspirone), hydroxyzine was equivalent in efficacy, acceptability and tolerability, however there is insufficient evidence to recommend it as a treatment for generalised anxiety disorder due to the high risk of bias in the reviewed studies.|$|E
25|$|The fifth {{edition of}} the DSM (DSM-5), planned for release in 2013, {{is likely to have}} this {{terminology}} revisited yet again. Under consideration is a transition from the abuse/dependence terminology. At the moment, abuse is seen as an early form or less hazardous form of the disease characterized with the dependence criteria. However, the APA's 'dependence' term, as noted above, does not mean that physiologic dependence is present but rather means that a <b>disease</b> <b>state</b> is present, one that most would likely refer to as an addicted state. Many involved recognize that the terminology has often led to confusion, both within the medical community and with the general public. The American Psychiatric Association requests input as to how the terminology of this illness should be altered as it moves forward with DSM-5 discussion.|$|E

25|$|Serial Analysis of Gene Expression (SAGE) was a {{development}} of EST methodology {{to increase the}} throughput of the tags generated and allow some quantitation of transcript abundance. cDNA is generated from the RNA but is then digested into 11bp ‘tag’ fragments using restriction enzymes that cut at a specific sequence, and 11base pairs along from that sequence. These cDNA tags are then concatenated head-to-tail into long strands (>500bp) and sequenced using low-throughput, but long read length methods such as Sanger sequencing. Once the sequences are deconvoluted into their original 11 bp tags. If a reference genome is available, these tags can sometimes be aligned to identify their corresponding gene. If a reference genome is unavailable, the tags can simply be directly used as diagnostic markers if found to be differentially expressed in a <b>disease</b> <b>state.</b>|$|E
25|$|Morphine can {{be taken}} orally, sublingually, bucally, rectally, subcutaneously, intranasally, intravenously, intrathecally or epidurally and inhaled via a nebulizer. As a {{recreational}} drug, it is becoming more common to inhale ("Chasing the Dragon"), but, for medical purposes, intravenous (IV) injection {{is the most common}} method of administration. Morphine is subject to extensive first-pass metabolism (a large proportion is broken down in the liver), so, if taken orally, only 40% to 50% of the dose reaches the central nervous system. Resultant plasma levels after subcutaneous (SC), intramuscular (IM), and IV injection are all comparable. After IM or SC injections, morphine plasma levels peak in approximately 20min, and, after oral administration, levels peak in approximately 30min. Morphine is metabolised primarily in the liver and approximately 87% of a dose of morphine is excreted in the urine within 72h of administration. Morphine is metabolized primarily into morphine-3-glucuronide (M3G) and morphine-6-glucuronide (M6G) via glucuronidation by phase II metabolism enzyme UDP-glucuronosyl transferase-2B7 (UGT2B7). About 60% of morphine is converted to M3G, and 6% to 10% is converted to M6G. Not only does the metabolism occur in the liver but it may also take place in the brain and the kidneys. M3G does not undergo opioid receptor binding and has no analgesic effect. M6G binds to μ-receptors and is half as potent an analgesic as morphine in humans. Morphine may also be metabolized into small amounts of normorphine, codeine, and hydromorphone. Metabolism rate is determined by gender, age, diet, genetic makeup, <b>disease</b> <b>state</b> (if any), and use of other medications. The elimination half-life of morphine is approximately 120min, though there may be slight differences between men and women. Morphine can be stored in fat, and, thus, can be detectable even after death. Morphine can cross the blood–brain barrier, but, because of poor lipid solubility, protein binding, rapid conjugation with glucuronic acid and ionization, it does not cross easily. Diacetylmorphine, which is derived from morphine, crosses the blood–brain barrier more easily, making it more potent.|$|E
500|$|The life {{expectancy}} of people with PD is reduced. Mortality ratios are around twice those of unaffected people. Cognitive decline and dementia, old age at onset, a more advanced <b>disease</b> <b>state</b> and presence of swallowing problems are all mortality risk factors. [...] On the other hand, a disease pattern mainly characterized by tremor as opposed to rigidity predicts an improved survival. Death from aspiration pneumonia is twice as common in individuals with PD as in the healthy population.|$|E

For their mechanistic similarity to mammalian prions, they were termed yeast prions. [...] Subsequent to this, a prion has also {{been found in the}} fungus Podospora anserina. These prions behave similarly to PrP, but, in general, are nontoxic to their hosts. Susan Lindquist's group at the Whitehead Institute has argued some of the fungal prions are not associated with any <b>disease</b> <b>state,</b> but may have a useful role; however, researchers at the NIH have also provided arguments suggesting that fungal prions could be considered a diseased state. There is mounting evidence that fungal proteins have evolved specific functions that are beneficial to the microorganism that enhance their ability to adapt to their diverse environments.|$|E
500|$|Within {{the medical}} and {{scientific}} communities, there is a broad consensus regarding alcoholism as a <b>disease</b> <b>state.</b> For example, the American Medical Association considers alcohol a drug and states that [...] "drug addiction is a chronic, relapsing brain disease characterized by compulsive drug seeking and use despite often devastating consequences. It results from a complex interplay of biological vulnerability, environmental exposure, and developmental factors (e.g., stage of brain maturity)." [...] Alcoholism has a higher prevalence among men, though, in recent decades, the proportion of female alcoholics has increased. Current evidence indicates that in both men and women, alcoholism is 50–60 percent genetically determined, leaving 40–50 percent for environmental influences. Most alcoholics develop alcoholism during adolescence or young adulthood. 31 percent of college students show signs of alcohol abuse, while six percent are dependent on alcohol. Under the DSM's new definition of alcoholics, that means about 37 percent of college students may meet the criteria.|$|E
