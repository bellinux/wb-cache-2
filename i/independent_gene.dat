40|$|International audienceAfter their {{discovery}} {{in the first}} decades of the XX th century, pseudoalleles generated much interest among geneticists: they apparently violated the conception of the genome as a collection of <b>independent</b> <b>genes</b> elaborated by Thomas Morgan's group. Their history is rich, complex, and deserves more than one short contribution. I will focus on two issues: the way the phenomenon of pseudoallelism suggested that the genome was more than a simple addition of <b>independent</b> <b>genes,</b> and the connection established between the formation of pseudoalleles during evolution and their functional roles. I will successively consider the first explanations for the origin of pseudoalleles elaborated in the mid- 1930 s, the metabolic/developmental sequential model proposed by Ed Lewis in the 1950 s, the disappointments encountered with the T-complex in the 1970 s, and the fading of the previous models after the molecular characterization of the pseudoallelic gene complexes in the 1980 s. Genomes are more than collections of genes, but their structures are the result of a complex evolutionary history that leaves no place for simplistic models...|$|R
50|$|A {{comparative}} analysis of CpG methylation patterns {{between humans and}} primates {{found that there were}} more than 800 genes that varied in their methylation patterns among orangutans, gorillas, chimpanzees, and bonobos. Despite these apes having the same genes, methylation differences are what account for their phenotypic variation. The genes in question are involved in development. It is not the protein sequences that account for the differences in physical characteristics between humans and apes; rather, it is the epigenetic changes to the genes. Since humans and the great apes share 99% of their DNA, it is thought that the differences in methylation patterns account for their distinction. So far, there are known to be 171 genes that are uniquely methylated in humans, 101 genes that are uniquely methylated in chimpanzees and bonobos, 101 genes that are uniquely methylated in gorillas, and 450 genes that are uniquely methylated in orangutans. For example, genes involved in blood pressure regulation and the development of the inner ear’s semicircular canal are highly methylated in humans, but not in the apes. There are also 184 genes that are conserved at the protein level between human and chimpanzees, but have epigenetic differences. Enrichments in multiple <b>independent</b> <b>gene</b> categories show that regulatory changes to these genes have given humans their specific traits. This research shows that epigenetics {{plays an important role in}} evolution in primates.It has also been shown that cis-regulatory elements changes affect the transcription start sites (TSS) of genes. 471 DNA sequences are found to be enriched or depleted in regards to histone trimethylation at the H3K4 histone in chimpanzee, human, and macaque prefrontal cortexes. Among these sequences, 33 are selectively methylated in neuronal chromatin from children and adults, but not from non-neuronal chromatin. One locus that was selectively methylated was DPP10, a regulatory sequence that showed evidence of hominid adaptation, such as higher nucleotide substitution rates and certain regulatory sequences that were missing in other primates. Epigenetic regulation of TSS chromatin has been identified as an important development in the evolution of gene expression networks in the human brain. These networks are thought to play a role in cognitive processes and neurological disorders.An analysis of methylation profiles of humans and primate sperm cells reveals epigenetic regulation plays an important role here as well. Since mammalian cells undergo reprogramming of DNA methylation patterns during germ cell development, the methylomes of human and chimp sperm can be compared to methylation in embryonic stem cells (ESCs). There were many hypomethylated regions in both sperms cells and ESCs that showed structural differences. Also, many of the promoters in human and chimp sperm cells had different amounts of methylation. In essence, DNA methylation patterns differ between germ cells and somatic cells as well as between the human and chimpanzee sperm cells. Meaning, differences in promoter methylation could possible account for the phenotypic differences between humans and primates.|$|E

40|$|A genetic {{analysis}} of parasitic ability in the {{soybean cyst nematode}} Heterodera glycines was performed. To identify and characterize genes involved in parasitism, we developed three highly inbred H. glycines lines, OP 20, OP 25 and OP 50, for use as parents for controlled crosses. Through these crosses, we have identified genes in the inbred parents that control reproduction of the nematode on hosts that carry resistance genes. These genes, designated as ror-* for reproduction on a resistant host, segregate in a normal Mendelian fashion as independent loci. Host range tests of F(1) generation progeny indicated {{that at least one}} parasitism gene in both the OP 20 and OP 50 lines for host PI 88788 was dominant.

40|$|Background: A {{simple and}} widely used {{approach}} for detecting hybridization in phylogenies is to reconstruct gene trees from <b>independent</b> <b>gene</b> loci, {{and to look}} for gene tree incongruence. However, this approach may be confounded by factors such as poor taxon-sampling and/or incomplete lineage-sorting. Results: Using coalescent simulations, we investigated the potential of supernetwork methods to differentiate between gene tree incongruence arising from taxon sampling and incomplete lineagesorting as opposed to hybridization. For few hybridization events, {{a large number of}} independent loci, and well-sampled taxa across these loci, we found {{that it was possible to}} distinguish incomplete lineage-sorting from hybridization using the filtered Z-closure and Q-imputation supernetwork methods. Moreover, we found that the choice of supernetwork method was less important than the choice of filtering, and that count-based filtering was the most effective filtering technique. Conclusion: Filtered supernetworks provide a tool for detecting and identifying hybridization events in phylogenies, a tool that should become increasingly useful in light of current genome sequencing initiatives and the ease with which large numbers of <b>independent</b> <b>gene</b> loci can be determined using new generation sequencing technologies...|$|E

Response to five isolates, classified as races 3, 6, 7, 38, and 73, were analyzed in 156 F families derived from the cross between line SEL 1308 and cultivar Michigan Dark Red Kidney (MDRK). SEL 1308 was resistant to all five races, while MDRK was susceptible to all except for race 73. Segregation ratio for response to races 3 and 7 indicated that single dominant genes {{were responsible for the}} resistance reaction to each race. Recombination between both race-specific genes was observed and no linkage was found with any of the molecular markers tagging Co-genes or clusters previously described. Linkage analyses allowed the location of both genes at the beginning of linkage group (LG) Pv 03, a region tentatively named as Co- 17. Segregation ratio for response to races 6 and 38 indicated that two dominant and <b>independent</b> <b>genes</b> conferred resistance to these races. Contingency tests and subpopulation analyses suggested the implication of one region on LG Pv 08, corresponding to the Co- 4 cluster, and the Co- 17 region.
