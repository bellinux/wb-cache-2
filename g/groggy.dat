5|$|A visibly {{pregnant}} McMahon also returned on the March 6, 2006 {{episode of}} Raw, approaching Shawn Michaels backstage and {{claiming to have}} abdominal pains. When Michaels left to get her some water, McMahon pulled out an unmarked substance out of her brassiere and poured it into his bottle of water. This substance caused him to become <b>groggy</b> during his match against Shane later in the night, which he lost as a result. McMahon also appeared at the WWE Hall of Fame induction ceremony on April 1, 2006 and in a backstage vignette with her immediate family at WrestleMania 22.|$|E

In early winter, the wolves are sedated again and awaken to find themselves in a strange high place with radio collars around their necks. Still <b>groggy</b> from the tranquilizer, the strangeness of the events and the smell of grizzly bear in the area triggers Marta's flight instincts and she runs blindly downward, leaving Oldtooth and the cubs behind. When Oldtooth awakens, he quietly abandons Annie and Sula, following Marta's trail, but at a much slower pace.|$|E
5|$|Donaldson {{returned}} from his suspension for York's reserves against Sheffield United on 6 February 2007, but the match was frozen off, and he eventually returned in a 4–0 away win over Altrincham on 10 February 2007. His first goals since his suspension came against Cambridge United, with a hat-trick on 13 March 2007. Donaldson insisted he remained fully committed to York, after speculation concerning his commitment grew in April 2007. In the play-off semi-final second leg away to Morecambe on 7 May 2007, Donaldson collided with the onrushing opposition goalkeeper Steven Drench in the penalty area while trying to collect the ball. With Donaldson still <b>groggy,</b> York's penalty was taken by Steve Bowey, who successfully converted in the 20th minute. However, York lost the match 2–1 and were eliminated on aggregate. Donaldson finished 2006–07 with 26 goals for York from 48 appearances, including 24 goals in the Conference National, meaning he was the division's third top scorer.|$|E

The album departs from the softer, hollowbody guitar sound of their previous album Lullabies to Paralyze with heavy, crunchy guitars and adding in some electronic influences. Rolling Stone noted the influence of [...] "New Wave synth geek Gary Numan…all over this record." [...] Musically, the album {{has been described as}} [...] "brand new retro", a fusion of [...] "punk, rock, blues and southern grit" [...] (FHM), and slower, moodier, and <b>groggier</b> than the band's previous efforts.|$|R
25|$|GHB is {{primarily}} {{known to the}} general public as a date rape drug. The drug is sometimes used to numb the other person, making it easier to then rape the person. When unobtrusively administered in a drink the victim will quickly feel <b>groggy</b> and sleepy, and upon recovery may have an impaired ability to recall memories of events that occurred during the period of intoxication. Consequently, the evidence and the identification of the perpetrator of rape is often difficult.|$|E
25|$|Butterbean {{appeared}} in the film , in a public stunt: an arranged fight with Johnny Knoxville in a department store. After the fight began, Knoxville fell, got up, was asked by Butterbean to hit him at least once. Knoxville did so, was easily knocked to the floor by Esch, and received several stitches in his head after the encounter (the camera catches Knoxville snoring). After waking up, a <b>groggy</b> Knoxville jokingly asked if Butterbean survived the fight. Knoxville stated that Esch is actually quite friendly outside of the ring, despite his fearsome ringside demeanor.|$|E
25|$|During combat, {{the player}} {{character}} is Agrippa, who can use various gladiatorial weapons such as swords, scimitars, maces, spears, bows, slingshots and flails. If Agrippa has severed {{the arm of}} an enemy, he can {{pick it up and}} also use it as a weapon. However, weapons can only be used for {{a certain amount of time}} before they break. During combat, a meter indicates the remaining vitality of Agrippa's weapon(s) and helmet (if he has one equipped). Agrippa can attack with his main weapon, his sub-weapon or shield, or with a two-handed weapon. The player can lock on to enemies to make Agrippa target them. Agrippa can also throw weapons at his enemies, and can fight with his fists, using strong and soft punches as well as shoulder tackles. If timed correctly, Agrippa can also steal weapons from his enemies, or knock their weapons out of their hands using a shoulder tackle. He can also attack from the ground by flinging sand into an approaching enemy's face, and he can attack downed enemies by stomping on them or stabbing them. If Agrippa stands behind a <b>groggy</b> enemy he can perform a suplex on them.|$|E
25|$|On July 17 at Money in the Bank, Bryan won the SmackDown Money in the Bank ladder match {{which earned}} him a World Heavyweight Championship match at any point within the {{following}} year. On the July 22 episode of SmackDown, Bryan declared he would cash in his Money in the Bank briefcase at WrestleMania XXVIII. After several months of losing matches, Bryan began a feud with then World Heavyweight Champion Mark Henry on the November 4 episode of SmackDown, after Henry challenged Bryan to a non-title match to prove that Bryan could not become champion. During the match, Big Show knocked out Henry, making Bryan lose by disqualification. Big Show, {{as a friend of}} Bryan, then urged a <b>groggy</b> Bryan to cash in his championship match, but Henry recovered and attacked both Bryan and Big Show before the match could start. After losing a rematch, Bryan suffered attacks from Henry the following two weeks. On November 25 at SmackDown, Henry was knocked out again by Big Show, at which point Bryan cashed in his briefcase for a title match and quickly pinned Henry. However, SmackDown authority figure Theodore Long revealed that Henry was not medically cleared to compete and voided the match, so Henry remained champion and the briefcase was returned to Bryan. Bryan later admitted he betrayed his principles by not waiting for WrestleMania, but explained he felt strongly about exacting revenge on Henry and realised he may not make it to WrestleMania due to Henry's continued attacks. Regardless of his briefcase, Bryan won a four-way match on the same episode of SmackDown to become the contender for Henry's championship. On the live November 29 episode of SmackDown, Henry managed to pin Bryan to retain his title in a steel cage match. Also in November, Bryan started being involved in a romantic storyline with AJ.|$|E
25|$|Hook goes {{calling for}} Emma and {{stands on a}} rooftop to get attention. He jumps off, and Emma uses magic to take him safely to the ground, before asking {{why he was so}} sure she’d save him. He says he was optimistic, and then asks what {{happened}} between them in Camelot. He says he forgives her, but she says that she's the Dark One and forgiveness. Hook says there’s nothing she’s done could be as bad as what he’s done. He shows her a ring that belonged to Barnaby, and whom he killed front of his wife. He says that every ring he wears is a sad story. She shows him the ring he gave her to keep safe, and he says it was the saddest story of all; it belonged to a man better than him, his brother Liam. She tries to give it back but he tells her to keep it. He says he wore rings as trophies and now they’re just reminders. When Emma asks if Hook wants to know the truth, no matter how terrible, Hook says he loves her no matter what, and Emma says she needs to show him something. She takes him to her house and she points him to a telescope. He looks and sees the sea and a full moon over the waves. She says he told her the ocean calmed him and he says it’s a nice home she picked, but Emma says that he picked it, not her. He looks at the newspaper and recognized his handwriting on it. She says he told her this was their future and she says everything she did was to keep that future alive. He asks again for the truth and she says they’re almost there and kisses him. She says she can’t tell him everything because he would try and stop her. After the kiss, Hook gets <b>groggy</b> and asks what she's doing, before passing out.|$|E
25|$|As seen on Hart's documentary, Hart {{proceeded}} to the dressing rooms and questioned Michaels, who pleaded {{that he knew}} nothing about what had taken place and was equally outraged. McMahon locked himself in his office with Pat Patterson and other agents. Mark Calaway, known as The Undertaker, furious with McMahon, banged on the door. McMahon opened and was told he had to apologize to Hart. As recounted in Michaels' autobiography, he was told by McMahon not to say anything about the screwjob to anybody, because McMahon needed to have everyone think that it was only him involved. Michaels offered his assurance that he would not carry the title belt out the next day on Raw and would refuse to say anything derogatory about Hart. Hart {{proceeded to}} the dressing room to shower and change after discovering that McMahon, Brisco, and Remus had locked themselves in McMahon's office. When McMahon went to Hart's dressing room and tried to explain himself, Hart angrily rebuffed him and warned him to leave immediately or risk being punched. An altercation ensued, with Hart giving McMahon a single punch, dropping him to the floor. Although Vince's son, Shane McMahon, and Brisco struggled briefly with Hart and Davey Boy Smith, Hart told them to take McMahon and leave or risk similar consequences. Hart angrily asked McMahon {{if he was going to}} screw him on the pay he was still owed, to which a <b>groggy</b> McMahon replied in the negative. In the hallway outside the dressing rooms, Hart's then-wife Julie angrily confronted Triple H and others about the finish, but was escorted away by Owen Hart. McMahon had a black eye and a sprained ankle, which according to Bret Hart, was a result of his punch lifting Vince off the floor and Vince rolling his ankle once he landed. However, McMahon and Brisco have since stated on WWE Confidential that Brisco accidentally stepped on Vince's foot, which as he tried to get back to his feet immediately sprained his ankle and sent him back to the floor, from which he suffered a concussion, and referred to Brisco's action as a 'comedy.' Michaels and Triple H were later confronted and assailed by angry fans outside the Molson Centre and in the lobby of their hotel.|$|E

[...] While {{working as an}} assistant coach at Michigan, Schulz has been credited with introducing the technique of overshifting a lineman on defense. [...] In 1913, Schulz developed a new blocking technique by shifting one of the linemen. [...] Coach Yost was unconvinced until Schulz performed a demonstration using Michigan's left guard Royce Traphagen. [...] Schulz first put Traphagen in the line position designated by Yost, Schulz lined up {{on the other side of}} the line and charged, [...] "almost wrecking Traphagen".

[...] He was {{positive}} of Leigh's performance, writing: [...] "Chyler Leigh gave a powerful performance in this episode. Her speech to Meredith was a little overwritten, but she almost made you forget that with her emotion. And the bond that is growing between Lexie and Meredith is nice to see. From Meredith finally saying out loud how she feels about Lexie, to Lexie being at Mer's side when she wakes up, I am really glad to see these sisters' happy." [...] Michael Pascua of The Huffington Post gave a positive review of the episode, commenting: [...] "I love how Grey's Anatomy can bounce between serious and hysterical moments. Old people wanting penile implants, bears attacking a <b>groggy</b> Alex, counterbalanced with Mercy West drama, Cristina being ignored, and Lexie's father arriving at the hospital hacking blood." [...] Pascua also praised the writing of Waite's character's storyline and Leigh's performance.|$|E
500|$|With Hoe and Tan as his assistants, Lim {{continued}} his trade, tricking more women into giving him money and sex. [...] By {{the time of}} his arrest, he had 40 [...] "holy wives". [...] In late 1980 he {{was arrested and charged with}} rape. [...] His accuser was Lucy Lau, a door-to-door cosmetic salesgirl, who had met Lim when she was promoting beauty products to Tan. [...] On 19October, Lim told Lau that a ghost was haunting her, but he could exorcise it with his sex rituals. [...] She was unconvinced, but the medium persisted. [...] He secretly mixed two capsules of Dalmadorm, a sedative, into a glass of milk and offered it to her, claiming it had holy properties. [...] Lau became <b>groggy</b> after drinking it, which allowed Lim to take advantage of her. [...] For the next few weeks, he continued to abuse her by using drugs or threats. [...] In November, after Lim had given her parents a loan smaller than the amount they had requested, Lau made a police report about his treatment of her. [...] Lim was arrested on charges of rape, and Tan for abetting him. [...] Out on bail, Lim persuaded Hoe to lie that she was present at the alleged rape but saw no crime committed. This failed to stop the police enquiries; Lim and Tan had to extend their bail, in person, at the police station every fortnight.|$|E

A <b>groggy</b> McMahon, {{who had not been}} able to sleep well because of all the calls he had gotten, was confronted by Mike Ditka later that morning and denied making the statement, saying he would not have even been awake to make the comment when he was said to have done so. He was supported in his claim by WLS reporter Les Grobstein, who was present when the alleged statements were made. WDSU would later retract the statement, have an on-air apology read by the station's general manager during the noon newscast on January 23; and suspended Diliberto for a time.|$|E
2500|$|Barbituric acid {{itself does}} not have any direct effect on the central nervous system and chemists have derived over 2,500 {{compounds}} from it that possess pharmacologically active qualities. The broad class of barbiturates is further broken down and classified according to speed of onset and duration of action. [...] Ultrashort-acting barbiturates are commonly used for anesthesia because their extremely short duration of action allows for greater control. [...] These properties allow doctors to rapidly put a patient [...] "under" [...] in emergency surgery situations. [...] Doctors can also bring a patient out of anesthesia just as quickly, should complications arise during surgery. [...] The middle two classes of barbiturates are often combined under the title [...] "short/intermediate-acting." [...] These barbiturates are also employed for anesthetic purposes, and are also sometimes prescribed for anxiety or insomnia. [...] This is not a common practice anymore, however, owing to the dangers of long-term use of barbiturates; they have been replaced by the benzodiazepines for these purposes. [...] The final class of barbiturates are known as long-acting barbiturates (the most notable one being phenobarbital, which has a half-life of roughly 92 hours). [...] This class of barbiturates is used almost exclusively as anticonvulsants, although on rare occasions they are prescribed for daytime sedation. [...] Barbiturates in this class are not used for insomnia, because, owing to their extremely long half-life, patients would awake with a residual [...] "hang-over" [...] effect and feel <b>groggy.</b>|$|E
