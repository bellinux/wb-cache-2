Translator Maya Sutedja-Liem, in a similar vein, notes a [...] "modern" [...] message against mistreatment of njais. However, she concludes that the emphasis on the mystical powers which Marsiti seems to possess causes an abandonment of realism, thus rendering the book [...] "anti-modern".|$|E

2500|$|Post-structuralism is {{not defined}} {{by a set of}} shared axioms or methodologies, but by an {{emphasis}} on how various aspects of a particular culture, from its most ordinary, everyday material details to its most abstract theories and beliefs, determine one another. Post-structuralist thinkers reject Reductionism and Epiphenomenalism and the idea that cause-and-effect relationships are top-down or bottom-up. Like structuralists, they start from the assumption that people's identities, values and economic conditions determine each other rather than having intrinsic properties that can be understood in isolation.Lévi-Strauss, quoting D'Arcy Westworth Thompson states: [...] "To those who question the possibility of defining the <b>interrelations</b> <b>between</b> entities whose nature is not completely understood, I shall reply with the following comment by a great naturalist: In a very large part of morphology, our essential task lies in the comparison of related forms rather than in the precise definition of each; and the deformation of a complicated figure may be a phenomenon easy of comprehension, though the figure itself has to be left unanalyzed and undefined." [...] Thus the French structuralists considered themselves to be espousing Relativism and Constructionism. But they nevertheless tended to explore how the subjects of their study might be described, reductively, as a set of essential relationships, schematics, or mathematical symbols. (An example is Claude Lévi-Strauss's algebraic formulation of mythological transformation in [...] "The Structural Study of Myth"Lévi-Strauss, Claude. Structural Anthropology. Trans. Claire Jacobson and Brooke Grundfest Schoepf (New York: Basic Books, 1963), [...]). Post-structuralists thinkers went further, questioning the existence of any distinction between the nature of a thing and its relationship to other things.|$|E
