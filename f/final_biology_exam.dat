This mixed model case study examined the correspondence between shifts in students’ strategic, regulated behaviors with their performance on classroom-based biology tests. The authors used traditional SRL assessment tools in a pretest-posttest fashion (e. g., self-report questionnaires, teaching rating scales) and gathered SRL data during the intervention using field note observations and contextualized structured interviews. This multidimensional assessment approach was used to establish convergence among the assessment tools and to facilitate interpretation of trends in students’ biology test performance relative to their SRL processes. Key themes in this study included the following: (a) the close correspondence between changes in students SRL, <b>biology</b> <b>exam</b> performance, and SREP attendance; (b) individual variability in student performance, SRL behaviors, and beliefs in response to SREP; and (c) the importance of using a multi-dimensional assessment approach in SRL intervention research.

40|$|During {{the spring}} term of 2013, {{national}} exams were {{conducted for the}} first time in the Swedish schools for 6 th graders. The exams involving the science subjects were however not used as a basis for the student’s grades, but were instead used as trial exams. It did however not take long for criticism to befall upon the notion of national exams. In 2014, The teacher association and Sweden’s student council proposed for the tests to be voluntary for the grades 6 to 9. They felt that the tests were too many and that they had a negative effect on both students and teachers alike. The government decided two years later, 2016, that the national exams should be voluntary. The goal of this essay is to further raise the understanding of the 6 th grade <b>biology</b> <b>exam.</b> This examination will present to what extent the <b>biology</b> <b>exam</b> tests the knowledge and skill of the students by comparing the exam against the requirements listed in Lgr 11. In order to accomplish this, text analysis will be used as the method, and Blooms revised taxonomy will be used as the analytical model. With this as a base, two questions have been raised. To what extent is the knowledge and skills tested in the national exams for the 6 th grade? How well does the national exam corresponds to the requirements stated in Lgr 11 regarding the knowledge and skills that should be tested in the exams, as well as the extent of these. The conclusion shows a high consistency between the requirements stated in Lgr 11 and the national <b>biology</b> <b>exams.</b> However, not all knowledge and skills were being tested equally. The number of questions for each different subject varied. The conclusion also gives biology 6 th grade teachers the possibility to make up for the lack of questions in the areas that are currently lacking...|$|R

40|$|This {{is a broad}} {{study on}} the topic of {{evolution}} in education. The main focus is on Dutch education but a comparison to the United Stats is made. It can be concluded that religion plays the biggest role in the discussion in the US {{as well as in the}} Netherlands. The nature of the debate is very different however due to large differences in national laws and legislation. For this study old Dutch schoolbooks have been examined as a primary resource. Schoolbooks for the subjects; biology, natural history, zoology, anthropology and geography by authors of different or no apparent religious backgrounds were used. The books have been examined on their content of the following topics; human evolution, paleontology, micro-macro evolution and religious signature. In the Netherlands the process of 'pillarization' (verzuiling) has played an important role. Foreign influences came mainly from Germany and later also from the United States in the form of Creation Science and Intelligent Design. Not only the history of the topic is discussed but also the current situation of the place of evolution in the Dutch (biology) curriculum.

This record of study is an examination of the relationship between school size, socio-economic status, expenditure-per-student, mobility rate, and percentage of non-White secondary students taking state or national science exams. It includes three journal-ready publications. The first journal-ready publication was a modified best-evidence synthesis and the second was a path analysis. The third journal-ready publication was a policy brief that included results from both studies as well as recommendations for policy makers, school administrators, and researchers. The modified best-evidence synthesis demonstrated that all five variables that were part of the study had an impact of students? performance on state or national science exams. The results of the path analysis demonstrated that school size and per pupil expenditure had no impact of STAAR Biology student performance.

FR questions include a question prompt which students respond to with essay-style answers. Conversely, MTF questions include an opening question stem with accompanying statements to be marked as either true or false. The goal {{of this study was to}} determine the advantages and disadvantages of FR and MTF question formats for assessing student comprehension in introductory biology.

On the contrary, MTF provides instructors with clear answers that can be used to gauge student comprehension, but it is unclear if students use cues in the statements to select correct answers without fully comprehending the concept. In conclusion, regardless of question format, the quality of a question will affect its ability to evoke the desired answer and accurately gauge student comprehension. Meaning, instructors should consider using a variety of question formats in order to gain a more complete understanding of students’ comprehension of topics...|$|R

While the funding battle raged on for a record long 3rd special session, Reykdal continued his drive to pass a bill to dramatically reduce the number of standardized tests being offered in Washington’s high schools. Reykdal partnered with the Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction to put forward HB-2214. The bill would reduce tests, save nearly $30 million every biennial budget cycle and would provide students with new alternatives to graduate when they didn’t meet a college-ready standard. Reykdal proposed that students be able to take “transition courses” in their senior year as an alternative to passing standardized test retakes and other third-party assessments and evaluations. He argued that the alternatives were expensive to taxpayers, inconsistent from district to district, and they were already proving to be a major barrier for students who were required to pass a <b>biology</b> <b>exam</b> for graduation. The transition courses were proposed because the State had already adopted a new 24 credit high school diploma requiring students to take more math and science. So Reykdal and OSPI proposed that those courses be aligned to the standards that were being tested already. Students would then need to pass rigorous courses to graduate instead of passing more tests.|$|R

40|$|The No Child Left Behind Act {{changed the}} way {{educators}} taught students with disabilities (SWD), as this population has now become part of all districtsâ?? annual yearly progress. The problem this qualitative study addressed was that many biology teachers in a Texas suburban district were not effectively implementing evidence-based strategies for SWD. The studyâ??s conceptual foundation was based on Vygotskyâ??s cognitive development theory that students achieve at higher levels when working in their zone of proximal development with support from peers or adults. The guiding question was intended to determine what strategies biology teachers were using to provide this support at schools with higher passing rates for SWD and how these strategies differed from those used by teachers in schools with lower passing rates. Participants interviewed were 6 biology teachers and 4 administrators from schools with both higher and lower passing rates for SWD to examine differences in strategies used by the two groups. Transcripts were coded and analyzed for common themes. Triangulation, member checking, and a second researcher re-coding selected data samples were used to insure data trustworthiness. Results indicated that SWD who had biology teachers using evidence-based strategies with follow-up activities scored higher on the state <b>biology</b> <b>exam</b> {{than those who did}} not and that participants would like to have special education teachers assist in developing effective biology lessons with the follow up activities for SWD.

40|$|Students in {{secondary}} science education {{seem to have}} difficulties with understanding diagrams. The present study focused on explanatory factors that predict students’ difficulties with process diagrams, i. e., diagrams that describe a process consisting of components that are related by arrows. From 18 compulsory national <b>Biology</b> <b>exams</b> of secondary school pre-university students, all process diagram tasks (n[*]=[*] 64) were included in corpus. Features of the task, student, and diagram {{were related to the}} difficulty of that particular task, indicated by the cohort mean exam score. A hierarchical regression analysis showed main effects for (1) the cognitive task demand, (2) the familiarity of the components, and (3) the number of components in a diagram. All these main effects were in the expected direction. We also observed interactions. Within the category of tasks with a high cognitive demand, tasks about a diagram of which students have low prior content knowledge were more difficult than tasks about a diagram of which students have high prior content knowledge. Tasks with a high cognitive demand about a diagram with familiar arrows were, surprisingly, more difficult than tasks with a high cognitive demand about a diagram with unfamiliar arrows. This latter finding might be attributed to compensation for task difficulty by the large number of components in the diagrams involved. The final model explained 46 % of the variance in exam scores. These results suggest that students have difficulties (1) with tasks that require a deeper understanding when the content is new, (2) with diagrams that use unfamiliar component conventions, and (3) with diagrams that have a small number of components and are therefore probably more abstract...|$|R

40|$|In this {{research}} study, I {{focused on the}} correlation between per pupil expenditures of three school systems - a low funded suburban school, a moderately funded suburban school, and a well-funded urban school - and the scores students received on their fifth grade state standardized test for science (MCAS). These three school systems have different demographics, and varying levels of both state aid and average family income. As a result, each school system spends different amounts on their science programs and on each individual student’s education for the school year. Previous {{research has found that}} school size and per pupil expenditure had no impact on student performance on the STAAR <b>Biology</b> <b>exams,</b> while socio-economic status, student mobility rate, and percentage of non-white students all had negative effects on student exam scores (Barton 2015). However, similar studies have never looked at the science MCAS test results for elementary students in Massachusetts. This study first examined the success of students on the fifth grade science MCAS from the last ten years. It compared this to changes in the overall budget for each school district from the last decade. Finally, it explored the budgets of each school system, including how the budget is determined for each district, through interviews with administrators. The hypothesis was that the more money allocated to each individual student and overall science budget, the higher the collective results of the fifth grade students’ science MCAS scores. Instead, this study found the three school districts moved towards having fewer students scoring on the highest or lowest categories, with students scoring in middle ranges regardless of if budgets increased. Alternately, it seems that school culture and socioeconomic status of families from the school districts may be factors contributing to the varying levels of student performance on the fifth grade science MCAS...|$|R

It also led to greater performance on the final exam, lending support to the testing effect in creative problem solving. Lengthier exams did not result in lower performance due to fatiguing conditions, although students perceived subjective fatigue.
