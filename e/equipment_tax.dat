Slovakia is considered to have ideal natural conditions for developing the biomass energy, it is definitely among countries that are rich in biomass. But the environmental awareness in Slovakia is still low and many people consider biomass as a fuel used by nature enthusiasts and environmentalists. A successful project implementation, in which people can see in practice that pellets are a competitive and a cost-effective heating fuel, might be a “first step” overcoming the people’s mistrustfulness.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the relative merits}} of two dominant economic instruments for reducing pollution—”green” taxes and tradable permits. Theoretically, the two instruments share many similarities, and on balance, neither seems preferable to the other. In practice, however, most countries have relied more on taxes than on permits to control pollution. The analysis suggests a number of lessons to be learned from country experiences regarding the design and implementation of both instruments. While many, particularly European countries, currently have long-term programs involving environmental taxes, a willingness to experiment with tradable permits seems to be growing, especially given the Kyoto protocol emission targets.

40|$|An {{identification}} of the principal design factors that influence the technical performance of a parabolic trough concentrator and which relate directly to design and manufacturing decisions is presented. These factors include spectral-directional reflectivity of the mirror system, the mirror-receiver tube intercept factor, the incident angle modifier and absorptivity-transmissivity product of the receiver tube and cover tube, the end loss factor and a factor describing the effect of tracking errors and receiver tube misalignment. Each of these factors has been quantified in terms of design and manufacturing tolerances and associated performance degradation. Other design considerations that relate to thermal loss from the receiver tube are low emissivity coatings, evacuation and anti-reflection coating. The analysis of energy costs using the parabolic trough concentrator is developed. This analysis determines both the break-even, current metered cost of energy and the annual cash flow over periods of investment ranging from 5 to 15 yr. The economic factors include investment tax credit, energy <b>equipment</b> <b>tax</b> credit, income tax bracket, cost of auxiliary system, foundations and controls, cost of collector at installation, costs of maintenance and taxes, costs of fuel, cost of capital, general inflation rate and fuel escalation rate. Economic determinations were made at three U. S. locations: Albuquerque, New Mexico; Fresno, California; and Caribou, Maine using the thermal performance characteristics of the Sandia Advanced Trough Prototype Collector. The collector costs used were those determined by a manufacturing cost analysis for various manufacturing volumes up to 100 000 modules (each 516 ft 2; 48 m 2) per year. The results show that for a 10 yr period of investment, the current metered breakeven costs are less than $ 7. 00 per 106 BTU at all locations for a collector having a total installed cost of $ 15. 79 ft- 2 ($ 170. 00 m- 2), which includes manufacturing and installation ($ 11. 50), foundations and controls ($ 1. 50) and auxiliary system ($ 2. 79). For a 15 yr period of investment the corresponding fuel costs are less than $ 4. 00 per 106 BTU at all locations. For a total installed collector cost of $ 22. 79 ft- 2 ($ 245 m- 2), the break even metered fuel cost is less than $ 9. 00 per 10 [deg] BTU at all locations, also for a 10 yr period of investment.

40|$|In {{this second}} of two {{articles}} on {{the economic impact of}} fundamental tax reform, Gregory Huffman and Evan Koenig extend their earlier framework for analyzing how the adoption of a flat-rate consumption tax would affect the economy over time. They argue that if tax reform is to be successful in stimulating investment and raising long-run living standards, then it is important that ways be found to avoid increasing the rate of labor-income taxation. Increases in labor-income tax rates can undo the positive economic effects of a cut in the rate of capital-income taxation. Conversely, cuts in labor-income tax rates reinforce savings incentives and contribute to higher steady-state levels of consumption. Huffman and Koenig also demonstrate that the economy’s immediate response to tax reform is muted—and the overall adjustment process can be substantially prolonged—when firms find it expensive to add quickly to their stocks of plant and <b>equipment.</b> Taxation; <b>Tax</b> auditing; Tax reform...|$|R

These high effective tax rates discourage personal saving. The paper discusses {{a number of ways}} in which the tax law could be modified to encourage more saving and less borrowing. Existing tax rules bias corporate decisions in favor of debt finance relative to equity finance and in favor of investments in intangible assets (like advertising, consumer goodwill, and R and D) relative to investments in plant and equipment.

40|$|Summary—Bonus {{depreciation}} subsidized only {{purchases of}} equipment with very long tax lives. Investment in {{these types of}} equipment responded sharply to the subsidy, {{but because it was}} so narrowly targeted, the subsidy had only modest effects on the overall economy. In 2002 businesses received a tax cut {{in the form of a}} “bonus depreciation ” provision that allowed them to immediately write off 30 percent of qualified investment spending. The bonus was increased to 50 percent in 2003 and expired at the end of 2004. 1 The bonus depreciation policy mainly benefited relatively long-lived business <b>equipment.</b> Current <b>tax</b> law already allows firms to rapidly write off investment expenditures for most other types of equipment. Consequently, the additional tax saving from writing off more in the first year is quite small for many types of investment. For example, the average subsidy resulting from the 50 percent bonus to equipment with service lives of 7 years or less was at most 1 percent. In addition, many of these investment goods (which include vehicles, computers, and “general equipment”) are purchased by firms that are not affected by bonus depreciation because their annual investment spending is low enough to write it off immediately. In contrast, the subsidy for longer-lived capital goods was much greater. These goods, whic...|$|R
