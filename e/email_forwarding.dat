By 1984, the story had spread to Eugene, Oregon, where it had morphed into a story of Latino and black gangs targeting whites.

After a night of sending faxes to local businesses, the person was arrested for inducing panic.|$|E

5000|$|The {{creation}} of the Internet enabled users to select and share content with each other electronically, providing new, faster, and more democratically controlled channels for spreading memes. <b>Email</b> <b>forwards</b> are essentially text memes, often including jokes, hoaxes, email scams, written versions of urban legends, political messages, and digital chain letters; if widely forwarded they might be called [...] "viral emails". [...] User-friendly consumer photo editing tools like Photoshop and image-editing websites have facilitated {{creation of}} the genre of the image macro, where the same image is overlaid with different humorous text phrases. (This type of image is what many people think of as an [...] "Internet meme".) Video-sharing websites like YouTube made viral videos possible. A video is viral when it has a relatively large number of views, indicating a wide audience. Viral videos are often amateur uploads but some are professionally produced.|$|R

50|$|Another related concept {{involves}} transferring {{a service}} from one device to another, such as sending {{a phone call}} or text message from a phone to a computer. Apple does not include this capability (available in OS X Yosemite and iOS 8) in its definition of Handoff, but instead assigns this feature to its set of services called Continuity, which includes Handoff. BlackBerry has a similar capability called Blend available for its smartphones to send calls or texts to OS X Macs and Windows PCs. These transfer services are similar to phone or <b>email</b> <b>forwarding</b> in that the communications is forwarded to another available device (usually via a Wi-Fi connection), and there's no interaction with the data itself {{as there is in}} liquid computing. Also, liquid computing allows multiple handoffs during the workflow, whereas communications transfers do not.|$|E

2500|$|Starting in August, 2014, {{there were}} {{widespread}} internet rumor and forwarded chain mails about ISIS capturing Christians and especially {{children and that}} they were systematically beheaded. According to Snopes.com, virally <b>forwarded</b> <b>email</b> prayer requests attributed to a [...] "Sean Malone of Crisis Relief International (CRI)" [...] who texted the claimed atrocity to an unknown recipient began to circulate in social media, claiming that Queragosh (alternate name of Bakhdida) was lost to ISIS forces and that children were [...] "systematically beheaded" [...] and urging people to pray for them and <b>forward</b> the <b>email</b> to other Christians. [...] The analysis shows that the claims in the various similarly worded emails were unsubstantiated and no [...] "Sean Malone of Crisis Relief International" [...] was ever successfully reached in efforts to verify the source of the text message. The original email that went viral was a personal email sent to a handful of close friends that got out and was based on second-hand account of [...] "... We know of 5 children that were beheaded and this is from a city official on the ground.". News media covering ISIS in the area had not heard anything of the sort and therefore no news reports of such incident. [...] Bob Roinson, the director of a Christian organization called Reintegrate, attempted to verify the claims with The Billy Graham Evangelical Association’s (BGEA) Rapid Response Team, who supposedly was the original recipient of the rumored text message and sent out the original prayer request. [...] BGEA's response, after investigation, was that its Rapid Response Team had not received any text message from CRI but only had the <b>email</b> that was <b>forwarded</b> to them claiming to originate with the text message. They acknowledged that the <b>email</b> <b>forward</b> was incorrect. Therefore, the email was essentially determined to be a hoax.|$|R

40|$|The {{widespread}} {{practice of}} forwarding {{is a distinct}} aspect of the electronic mail ecosystem with implications for security, knowledge management, and the design of email interfaces. Forwarded email messages have increased or decreased credibility or significance depending on the sender’s reputation. They provide information about an individual’s social network, and function as a personal news clipping service. To date, there has been minimal research published on <b>email</b> <b>forwarding</b> behaviors {{and we hope to}} add to the research community’s knowledge in this area. In this paper we explore <b>email</b> <b>forwarding</b> in terms of gift giving within a social network, and the collective action dilemmas present in each decision to forward or not forward and to read or not read (and act on or not act on) any piece of email that could be sent to one or more recipients. 1 Forwarded Message Characteristics Forwarded messages are written by someone other than the person who sends them and are sent to someone who was not the original recipient; by definition they are not original works. As people encounter new information that may have relevance for others in their social network, they may decide to forward {{some or all of the}} content of interest. Forwarding can be understood in terms of the concept of gift exchange. In the “gift economy ” model forwarded messages can be viewed as low cost tokens that are exchanged in order to maintain both weak and strong social ties. Just as people once regularly clipped articles from print publications and mailed them to friends and colleagues, forwarded email is often based on clipping...|$|E
40|$|Proxy re-encryption (PRE), {{introduced}} by Blaze, Bleumer and Strauss, allows a semi-trusted proxy to convert a ciphertext originally intended for Alice into an encryption {{of the same}} message intended for Bob. Proxy re-encryption has found many practical applications, such as encrypted <b>email</b> <b>forwarding,</b> secure distributed file systems, and outsourced filtering of encrypted spam. In ACM CCS’ 07, Canetti and Hohenberger presented a bidirectional PRE scheme with chosen-ciphertext security, and left an important open problem to construct a chosen-ciphertext secure proxy reencryption scheme without pairings. In this paper, we propose a bidirectional PRE scheme with chosen-ciphertext security. The proposed scheme is fairly efficient due to two distinguished features: (i) it does not use the costly bilinear pairings; (ii) the computational cost and the ciphertext length decrease with re-encryption...|$|E

50|$|Email {{tracking}} {{is used by}} individuals, email marketers, spammers and phishers, {{to verify}} that emails are actually read by recipients, that email addresses are valid, and that the content of emails has made it past spam filters.

50|$|Due to the {{widespread}} use of web bugs in email, simply opening an email can potentially alert the sender that the address to which the email is sent is a valid address.
