5000|$|MS Berge Istra was, {{like its}} sister ship [...] which {{disappeared}} under similar circumstances four years later, an ore-bulk-oil carrier - a ship which could transport both oil and iron ore. Even 30 years later, the shipping company maintained secrecy {{with regards to}} the cause of the accident. During an interview in Norwegian newspaper Dagbladet in January 2011, the retired Bergesen captain Johnny Eilers gave his view on what happened: The inert (neutral gas) systems were often unreliable those days, and many officers lacked education in how to measure gas levels. Berge Istra was loaded with ore in the main holds. But the wingtanks were not cleaned after the previous cargo of oil, thus producing oil vapor. Also the <b>deck</b> <b>water</b> <b>seal</b> was unreliable in heavy seas, allowing this vapor to enter the inert gas system and generator. That generator would be started on their way east, as Japan demanded inerted wingtanks on arrival. Starting the generator would then cause the “whole deck to open up”, just as the two survivors had explained it did. Thus the Berge Istra and Berge Vanga disasters.|$|E
30|$|Per our algorithm, we do {{not remove}} thoracostomy tubes on wall suction. Martino et al. {{concluded}} that a trial of <b>water</b> <b>seal</b> appears to allow occult air leaks to become clinically apparent, thus potentially reducing the need for another thoracostomy tube (Martino et al. 1999). Furthermore, regarding wall suction versus <b>water</b> <b>seal,</b> the literature has suggested that suction compared to <b>water</b> <b>seal</b> does not reduce air leaks in patients whom have had a pulmonary resection. However, it could decrease the occurrence of postoperative PTX from early air leak (Deng et al. 2010). Further, {{this study did not}} involve trauma patients. We do not have data to compare the recurrence of PTX after a thoracostomy tube is removed on <b>water</b> <b>seal</b> versus wall suction, which is a limitation of our study.|$|R
30|$|Interestingly, Martino et al. {{published}} a prospective randomized study in 205 trauma patients {{in which their}} thoracostomy tubes were removed either on <b>water</b> <b>seal</b> or on wall suction (Martino et al. 1999). Following thoracostomy tube removal, a recurrent PTX was seen in 13 patients in the <b>water</b> <b>seal</b> group with only one patient requiring tube replacement and a recurrent PTX in nine patients from the suction group with seven patients requiring a tube replacement. The study concluded that the <b>water</b> <b>seal</b> group {{was more likely to}} have recurrent PTX after thoracostomy tube removal but less likely to need a replacement.|$|R

They concluded that 31 patients had a PTX on follow-up CXR, 22 were identified early and nine were late. Of the 22 patients identified early, three had a clinically significant increase in size of a PTX. This may suggest that three hours of <b>water</b> <b>seal</b> time may not be safe. Our algorithm is based on approximately 24  hours of <b>water</b> <b>seal</b> time before removal with only 2 / 313 patients (1.3 %) having a recurrent PTX.|$|R

40|$|Metam sodium is {{the most}} widely used soil {{fumigant}} in the United States. The primary breakdown product of metam sodium in soil is methyl isothiocyanate (MITC), an active pesticidal agent with a high toxicity and a great potential for volatilization. Reducing atmospheric emissions of MITC is therefore critical to maintain air quality. The objective {{of this study was to}} examine the rate and efficiency of conversion of metam sodium to MITC in soil and to investigate the potential of using surface <b>water</b> <b>sealing</b> to reduce MITC emissions. The conversion of metam sodium to MITC was a rapid abiotic decomposition process. At typical field application rates, the conversion efficiency depended on the initial content of metam sodium in soil, but was independent of soil moisture, soil type, and soil atmospheric conditions. A soil column system was used to measure the emission and distribution of MITC after subsurface and surface application of metam sodium. Volatilization flux and cumulative emission loss of MITC was substantially reduced with surface <b>water</b> <b>sealing</b> compared to uncovered soil columns after subsurface application of metam sodium. When metam sodium was surface applied in simulated chemigation, surface <b>water</b> <b>sealing</b> was ineffective, suggesting the need for additional emissions reduction practices when metam sodium is broadcast. Overall, the results of the column experiment indicate that surface <b>water</b> <b>sealing</b> with subsurface application of metam sodium may be an effective and economical strategy to reduce MITC emissions while maintaining pest control efficacy. r 2006 Published by Elsevier Ltd...|$|R

5000|$|A chest {{drainage}} system is typically {{used to collect}} chest drainage (air, blood, effusions). Most commonly, {{drainage system}}s use three chambers {{which are based on}} the three-bottle system. The first chamber allows fluid that is drained from the chest to be collected. The second chamber functions as a [...] "water seal", which acts as a one way valve allowing gas to escape, but not reenter the chest. Air bubbling through the <b>water</b> <b>seal</b> chamber is usual when the patient coughs or exhales but may indicate, if continual, a pleural or system leak that should be evaluated critically. It can also indicate a leak of air from the lung. The third chamber is the suction control chamber. The height of the water in this chamber regulates the negative pressure applied to the system. A gentle bubbling through the water column minimizes evaporation of the fluid and indicates that the suction is being regulated to the height of the water column. In this way, increased wall suction does not increase the negative pressure of the system. Newer drainage systems eliminate the <b>water</b> <b>seal</b> using a mechanical check-valve, and some also use a mechanical regulator to regulate the suction pressure. Systems which employ both these are dubbed [...] "dry" [...] systems, whereas systems that retain the <b>water</b> <b>seal</b> but use a mechanical regulator are called [...] "wet-dry" [...] systems. Systems which use a <b>water</b> <b>seal</b> and <b>water</b> column regulator are called [...] "wet" [...] systems. Dry systems are advantageous as tip-overs of wet systems can spill and mix with blood, mandating the replacement of the system. Even newer systems are smaller and more ambulatory so the patient can be sent home for drainage if indicated.|$|R
