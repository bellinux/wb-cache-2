30|$|The major {{purpose of}} this study was to explore the {{determinant}} factors of entrepreneurship intentions of <b>Electronic</b> Technology <b>Education</b> students in Nigerian universities. The study explored the influence of entrepreneurial factors as well as entrepreneurial learning experiences activities on the entrepreneurial intentions of <b>Electronic</b> Technology <b>Education</b> students in the universities. The study adopted a correlational survey research design. The population for the study was 366 <b>Electronic</b> Technology <b>Education</b> undergraduate students. There was no sampling as a result of the manageable size of the population. The students were surveyed by direct contact using questionnaire. They were asked to indicate the entrepreneurship learning experiences activities they were participating in/would participate in as part of their curriculum. Data collected were analysed using descriptive statistics and multiple regressions. The findings show that the more entrepreneurial activities students are engaged in, the less the influence of entrepreneurial factors on their entrepreneurial intentions and this significantly increased entrepreneurial intentions of students who prefer career choice as an entrepreneur. The findings also revealed that there is a positive relationship between gender, age, career choice, parents’ occupation, and entrepreneurial intentions of <b>Electronic</b> Technology <b>Education</b> undergraduate students. It was recommended that <b>Electronic</b> Technology <b>Education</b> undergraduate students should see career options with a balance view in order to understand their abilities before deciding to venture in any electronic business enterprise.|$|R
30|$|<b>Electronic</b> Technology <b>Education</b> (ETE) {{is a type}} of {{education}} designed to impart the necessary knowledge and skills in various electronic trade areas such as circuit designs, production of electronic gadgets, and electronic repairs, among others. One of the goals of tertiary education is to acquire both physical and intellectual skills which will enable individuals to be self-reliant and useful members of the society (Federal Republic of Nigeria, 2004). As such, <b>electronic</b> technology <b>education</b> is designed to prepare students as technologists in the areas of electronic maintenance, circuit design, production of electronic gadgets among others at tertiary institution level. <b>Electronic</b> technology <b>education</b> is also a course offered in technical education. It is the type {{of education}} designed to produce electronic technology teachers for technical colleges, colleges of education (Technical) and universities.

40|$|Attitudes Towards Using Virtual Laboratories in <b>Electronic</b> <b>Education</b> Among Secondary Schools Students of Makkah al-Mukaramah By: Dr. Zakariya Y. Lal 	The present {{research}} is oriented primarily {{to explore the}} attitudes of males – females students enrolled at the general secondary schools, Makkah al-Mukaramah, towards the use of virtual laboratories in <b>electronic</b> <b>education.</b> As part of this exercise, it seeks as well to discover the relationship of such attitudes with creative abilities –––– fluency, flexibility and originality, etc. Finally, it tends to explore the variances that exist among creative abilities commensurate to the variance of attitude variables –––– high vs. low education; male vs. female student; and second vs. third study level. 	In conducting the {{present research}}, a questionnaire was prepared. It was circulated among a sample group of 250 students –––– males and females –––– enrolled at {{the second and third}} study levels, general secondary schools, Makkah al-Mukaramah. The students opted for research sample pursued scientific field of study. 	The findings of the present study are revealing. Among such findings, the following are decisive: •	There is a positive and significant correlation between the attitudes towards using virtual laboratories in <b>electronic</b> <b>education</b> and select creative abilities –––– fluency, flexibility and originality. •	The attitudes of male students towards using virtual laboratories in <b>electronic</b> <b>education,</b> enrolled in the thirds level, reflect more creativeness. 	In its conclusive paragraphs, the present research records some recommendations. The most salient are in order: 1. 	Periodic scientific-oriented symposia should be conducted. These symposia should stress the relative importance of using virtual laboratories in <b>electronic</b> <b>education.</b> 2. 	Students in both stages –––– secondary school and university –––– should be given orientation on the educational resources that lead to the attainment of quality education. 3. 	The role of using virtual laboratories in <b>electronic</b> <b>education</b> should be given momentum. Likewise, the development of some creative abilities should be sought...|$|E

This field is linked to public policies/actions, when recognizing critical alternatives to the linear model of technological innovation (to replace it with the situated and distributed, systemic-holistic, and socio-technological interpretation), stressing the particular conditions of production and use of knowledge for the region, with the articulation of ICT, mainly to renovate and incorporate virtual higher-level educational proposals. So, this article contributes to the deepening not only of the ‘new sociology of science and technology’, but also to different lines of inquiry which affect the programmes of <b>electronic</b> distance <b>education</b> today, characterized by a consumerist scientific-technological boom within global controversy. The practice of a substantive reflexivity will result in not only a new meaning of the concept of social inclusion for a new conviviality within global social systems traversed by ICT, but also in the analysis of proposals that will overcome the socio-educationa...|$|R
