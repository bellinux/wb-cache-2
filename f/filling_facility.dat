50|$|Pine Bluff Former Production Facilities: PBA once housed two {{chemical}} warfare production facilities, and NSCMP {{was charged with}} destroying them {{to comply with the}} CWC. Destroyed in 1999, the BZ <b>Fill</b> <b>Facility</b> <b>filled</b> munitions with the agent BZ, a hallucinogen. In 2003, NSCMP began demolition of the former Pine Bluff Integrated Binary Production Facilities (PB IBPF), designed to produce binary chemicals and fill binary chemical weapons. These weapons were designed to mix two non-lethal chemicals to form a chemical agent in flight to a target. The DF Production/M20 Canister <b>Fill</b> and Close <b>Facility</b> was the only facility operated. From 1988 to 1990 it produced the binary precursor methylphosphonic difluoride (DF), inserting the chemical into coffee can-sized M20 canisters for use in the M687 155 mm Binary Artillery Projectile. The BLU-80/B Bigeye Bomb <b>Fill</b> <b>Facility,</b> QL Production Facility and DC Production Facility never operated, and all were demolished. The final remaining PB IBPF building, intended to fill binary munitions for the Multiple Launch Rocket System, but never used for that purpose, was reutilized as the Pine Bluff Binary Destruction Facility (PB BDF), to neutralize the binary precursor chemicals DF and QL. After neutralization was completed in October 2006, demolition of the building commenced. Completed on Dec. 28, 2006, it marked the end of the PB IBPF demolition and the last former {{chemical warfare}} production facility destroyed in the United States. This accomplishment was significant since it enabled NSCMP to surpass the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) treaty milestone of demolition of all the nation’s former production facilities four months ahead of schedule.

40|$|The hazards {{associated}} with {{major accident hazard}} (MAN) industries are fire, explosion and toxic gas releases. Of these, toxic gas release is the worst as {{it has the potential}} to cause extensive fatalities. Qualitative and quantitative hazard analyses are essential for the identification and quantification of these hazards related to chemical industries. Fault tree analysis (FTA) is an established technique in hazard identification. This technique has the advantage of being both qualitative and quantitative, if the probabilities and frequencies of the basic events are known. This paper outlines the estimation of the probability of release of chlorine from storage and <b>filling</b> <b>facility</b> of chlor-alkali industry using FTA. An attempt has also been made to arrive at the probability of chlorine release using expert elicitation and proven fuzzy logic technique for Indian conditions. Sensitivity analysis has been done to evaluate the percentage contribution of each basic event that could lead to chlorine release. Two-dimensional fuzzy fault tree analysis (TDFFTA) has been proposed for balancing the hesitation factor involved in expert elicitation. (C) 2010 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Developing {{countries}} often {{face the}} challenge of managing continuously growing quantity of municipal waste. Waste is often disposed of by stockpiling and land filling because these have been found the cheapest waste disposal methods in the world. Unfortunately, these waste disposal methods are often source of visual pollution, water contamination and greenhouse effect gas emissions. Waste disposal by incineration has been found effective and now is one of the mostly used waste disposal method in several developed countries. Nevertheless, setting up appropriate waste incinerator requires a good of the combustion process. Unfortunately, direct studies on industrial facilities are not easily feasible because of technical issues and financial limitations. Studies and throughout testing frequently need to be carried out at laboratory scale. Work herein reported first overviewed operation conditions of the landfill facility in the town of Ouagadougou. In the second time for incineration simulation, batch experiments are carried out with a rotary kiln furnace to study the effects of the residence time on emissions of NO, NO 2, CO, CO 2 and SO 2 in the atmosphere. For each rotation speed, emissions of NO, NO 2, CO, CO 2 and SO 2 from the incineration of a household combustible fraction model waste consisting of wood (53 %), cardboard (25 %) and plastics (22 %) have been recorded. The lifespan of the land <b>filling</b> <b>facility</b> with incineration has been estimated. Our work show that it may be improved up to roughly three times that of simple land filling.

40|$|This {{report by}} Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) {{documents}} {{results of a}} contamination source review of Building E 5032 at the Aberdeen Proving Ground (APG) in Maryland. The review included a historical records search, physical inspection, photographic documentation, geophysical investigation, and review of available records regarding underground storage tanks associated with Building E 5032. The field investigations were performed by ANL during 1994 and 1995. Building E 5032 (APG designation), originally known as Building 99, {{is located at the}} northwest comer of the intersection of Hoadley Road and Magnolia Road in the Edgewood Area of APG. It was constructed during World War I as an incendiary bomb filling plant and in 1920 s and 1930 s maintained as a <b>filling</b> <b>facility.</b> During World War II the building was a pilot plant {{for the development of a}} dry white phosphorus filling process. Since then the building has been used for white phosphorus filling pilot studies. Most of the dry filling methods were developed in Building E 5032 between 1965 and 1970. Other filling operations in Building E 5032 have included mustard during the period shortly after World War II and triethyl aluminum (TEA) during the late 1960 s and early 1970 s. During the World War II period, the building was connected to the sanitary sewer system with one large and at least one small interior sump. There are also seven sumps adjacent to the exterior of the building: two on the west elevation, four near the four bays on the south elevation, and one at the northeast corner of the building. All of these sumps are connected with the chemical sewer system and received most, if not all, of the production operation wastewater. The discharge from this system was released into the east branch of Canal Creek; the discharge pipe was located southeast of Building E 5032. There are no records indicating the use of Building E 5032 after 1974, and it is assumed that the building has been out of service since that time...|$|E

40|$|Amgen Inc. {{currently}} manufactures, formulates {{and fills}} substantially {{all of their}} global drug product units in a single primary facility ("Site 1 A"). Concerned about the inherent risks posed by the geographic concentration of these activities, Amgen has decided to acquire a new international Risk Mitigation Site ("RMS"), expand existing bulk manufacturing infrastructure at Site 1 A, and construct a new formulation and <b>filling</b> <b>facility</b> colocated with Site 1 A ("Site IB"). Bringing both sites online {{in the near future}} will create a novel operational challenge for Amgen, as it will present a broad range of formulation/fill production allocation decisions that did not previously exist. If per-unit costs (production, logistics, etc.) were considered to be typically higher at either RMS or Site 1 A/B, an unconstrained optimization model might suggest filling/finishing all product at whichever site has the lowest average cost. However, we assume that RMS should be able to ramp up to full capacity within 3 months of an adverse occurrence at Site 1 A. This translates to a minimum product flow constraint through RMS, irrespective of per unit costs, that will keep the facility sufficiently staffed to prepare for a fast ramp-up. Furthermore, helping Amgen mitigate the risks of geographic concentration, RMS may typically produce only a portion of global demand for any product. Given this situation, this thesis develops a product allocation strategy that will: 1) minimize the financial cost of filling various quantities of drug product at the new facility, yet 2) maintain at RMS the expertise required begin manufacturing all drugs {{in a short period of}} time. A mixed-integer linear program ("MILP") was developed to capture variable costs of the formulation & fill process for each drug product ("DP") and market combination. The objective of this model is to minimize total supply chain costs subject to meeting market demand and maintaining a sufficient amount of product flow through the RMS facility. The analysis assumes that the decision to develop fill capacity at both RMS and Site lB is complete and that both facilities will be licensed to fill all products that currently run through Site 1 A (i. e. capital investment decisions will not be analyzed in this study). The outcome of this study is a product allocation strategy that minimizes network costs as well as a tool that will enable Amgen to solve for minimal network costs under additional future scenarios. by Roy J.
