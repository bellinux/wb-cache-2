5|$|In writing these {{desultory}} letters, I found <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> {{avoid being}} continually {{the first person}} – 'the little hero of each tale.' I tried to correct this fault, if it be one, for they were designed for publication; but in proportion as I arranged my thoughts, my letter, I found, became stiff and affected: I, therefore, determined to let my remarks and reflections flow unrestrained, as I perceived that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> give a just description of what I saw, but by relating the effect different objects had produced on my mind and feelings, whilst the impression was still fresh.|$|E
5|$|I have then {{considered}} {{myself as}} a particle broken off from the grand mass of mankind; — I was alone, till some involuntary sympathetic emotion, like the attraction of adhesion, made me feel that I was still {{a part of a}} mighty whole, from which <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> sever myself—not, perhaps, for the reflection has been carried very far, by snapping the thread of an existence which loses its charms in proportion as the cruel experience of life stops or poisons the current of the heart.|$|E
5|$|It {{was some}} time {{afterward}} when the thought flashed upon {{my mind that}} the disturbances I had observed {{might be due to}} an intelligent control. Although <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> decipher their meaning, it was impossible for me to think of them as having been entirely accidental. The feeling is constantly growing on me that I had been the first to hear the greeting of one planet to another.|$|E
6000|$|... "I did {{n't mean}} to do it the first minute, but look about me a little, and be sure Syd was all right. But Fan's news settled that point, and just now the look in my Polly's face settled the other. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>n't</b> wait another minute, or let you either, and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>n't</b> help {{stretching}} out my arms to my little wife, God bless her, though I know I don't deserve her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{have done}} {{me a great}} wrong--you have done me a cruel wrong! I have been telling it to Miss Vivian; I came on purpose to tell her. I can't really tell her; I can't tell her the details; it 's too painful! But you know what <b>I</b> mean! <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>n't</b> stand it any longer. I thought of going away--but <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>n't</b> do that. <b>I</b> must come and say what I feel. I can't bear it now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know. But <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>n't</b> have {{dreamt of}} smoking in your presence. And {{we take the}} liberty to dream very strange things." ...|$|R
5|$|This {{was by far}} {{the biggest}} {{challenge}} I have ever taken on in my career, and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> be more honored {{to be a part of}} such an amazing and historical event. Nothing could ever come close to working with Madonna on this Super Bowl performance, her attention to detail and commitment to all of her projects is truly inspiring and life changing.|$|E
5|$|I {{asked him}} not {{to go into that}} field, that you were going there. He laughed at the idea of being {{restricted}} to any locality and said he intended to go whether I aided him or not. I was anxious to secure the cooperation of such a worker as an honor to my corps. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> be responsible for the field he selected in as much as I pay him no salary and a portion of his expenses. You will see therefore that while it is not a pleasant thing to work in competition with others it seems almost a necessity. You can sympathize.|$|E
5|$|I {{must confess}} that, like many others, I {{did not come}} painlessly to the Natural History. For years I was {{put off by the}} aura of {{sanctity}} and bluffness which seemed to surround it. It was the kind of book presented on prize-giving days, and I saw it as a work, in all senses, of the old school. Even when I eventually came to read it, I cannot say my opinion changed dramatically. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> cope at first with its rambling disorder, its sudden plunges into thickets of taxonomic Latin, and, for a while, I failed to notice the feeling behind the often dispassionate prose.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, one. Carlotta Gispardi. But she <b>could</b> <b>n't</b> speak English, and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>n't</b> speak Dago; and she died. I don't care; though I {{never knew}} any, I {{seem to know}} as much about them as you do." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That 's over now," [...] said Gordon. [...] "I came {{to welcome}} you back. It seemed to me <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>n't</b> lay my head on my pillow without {{speaking}} to you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, no!" [...] {{replied the}} girl, {{with a certain}} dreamy abstraction. [...] "I had heard that you made some such distinction--I remember, now. But <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>n't</b> realize {{anything}} so ridiculous." ...|$|R
25|$|I {{felt that}} air {{was forced into}} my mouth, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> speak and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> close my mouth. I could {{understand}} well everything said to me. Other times I {{feel that there is}} food in my mouth and there is also a lot of salivation. I cannot speak.|$|E
25|$|<b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> see his face, {{but he had}} a {{short neck}} and large head.|$|E
25|$|My {{mouth opened}} and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> speak. I {{wanted to say}} I cannot speak. At the same time, {{it was as if}} {{somebody}} was strangling me.|$|E
6000|$|... "He don't want me; besides, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>n't</b> say a {{word for}} myself if that letter was from Sydney," [...] cried Fanny, hustling her friend towards the door, in a great flutter.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, indeed, sometimes; but we <b>could</b> <b>n't</b> stay mad, {{and always}} {{made it up}} again {{as soon as we}} could. Jimmy used to come round first, and say, 'All serene, Polly,' so kind and jolly, that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>n't</b> help {{laughing}} and being friends right away." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That 's not my way either," [...] {{she said}} decidedly. [...] "I 'd try to outlive it, and if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>n't,</b> <b>I</b> 'd {{try to be}} the better for it. Disappointment need n't make a woman a fool." ...|$|R
25|$|The {{left side}} of my mouth felt numb and started jerking and pulling to the left, and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> speak to say what was {{happening}} to me.|$|E
25|$|The British {{were quick}} {{to accept the fact}} that the nationalistic movement, which had {{hardened}} during World War <b>I,</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> be faced without the deployment of consistent and well-trained forces. On June 25 the Kuva-i Inzibatiye was dismantled on the advice of the British, as they were becoming a liability.|$|E
25|$|<b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> but declare by the {{testimony}} of the Scripture it selfe, that the way of Separation is the way of God, who is the author of it, which manifestly appeares by his separating of his Church from the world, and the world from his Church in all ages.|$|E
60|$|Decidedly, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>n't</b> stand it; without {{responding}} I gave {{my hand to}} Caroline Spencer. She {{looked at}} me an instant with her little white face and expanded eyes, and as she showed her pretty teeth I suppose she meant to smile.|$|R
6000|$|... "I came yesterday, {{and have}} been getting my nest in order; but <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>n't</b> keep away any longer, so I ran up to say 'How do you do?'" [...] {{answered}} Polly, in the cheery voice that did one's heart good to hear.|$|R
6000|$|... "Only Polly; {{she likes}} music, {{and it was}} so stormy <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>n't</b> go last week, you know," [...] {{answered}} Fan; adding, as they left the house again, [...] "If any one meets us on the way, I can't help it, can I?" ...|$|R
25|$|This is {{the finest}} team of Sailors I've been {{fortunate}} to call shipmates. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> be more proud {{of each and}} every Sailor and their families. The Ronald Reagan Carrier Strike Group has been pretty busy the last few years, executing missions across the capabilities of our National Maritime Strategy—and answering the call with impressive results every time.|$|E
25|$|When {{you look}} at the inhumane {{treatment}} of Jews, not only in Germany but occupied countries as well, you start worrying that such a demand might also be put on us, but we must clearly refuse such this due to their protection under the Danish constitution. I stated that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> meet such a demand towards Danish citizens. If such a demand is made, we would best meet it by all wearing the Star of David.|$|E
25|$|The judge {{hearing the}} case even asked me whether I {{could make the}} film indoors and thus {{accommodate}} Madhubala, and I said <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not.</b> You will not believe this, but the day the film was released, I saw the same judge coming towards me and saying that I was right, the film {{could only have been}} made outdoors. That's how I won the case. Madhubala did come to my house to apologise and say she was really helpless, but that's okay. I have no complaints.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] she said, [...] "I {{know you}} would be generous and brave about that--about anything. But what--what if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>n't</b> give up my career--my hopes of being useful in the way I have planned? You would n't have liked {{me to go on}} practising medicine?" ...|$|R
6000|$|I du believe thet holdin' slaves [...] Comes nat'ral tu a Presidunt, [...] Let 'lone the rowdedow {{it saves}} [...] To hev a wal-broke precedunt; [...] Fer any office, small or gret, [...] <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>n't</b> ax with no face, [...] Without I 'd ben, thru dry an' wet, [...] Th' unrizzest kind o' doughface.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{asked him}} {{to let me go}} with him because Louise had {{tortured}} me about making her go out in his boat, till <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>n't</b> bear it any longer. It seemed to me that if I took the same risk myself, it would be something; and I hoped there would be a storm." ...|$|R
25|$|If {{somebody}} kept a {{very accurate}} {{record of a}} human being, going through the era from the Gay 90s, from {{a very different kind}} of world through the turn of the century—as far into the twentieth century as you might live. I decided to make myself a good case history of such a human being and it meant that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> be judge of what was valid to put in or not. I must put everything in, so I started a very rigorous record.|$|E
25|$|My misfortune I {{trust will}} be {{properly}} considered {{by all the}} World – It was a circumstance <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> foresee – I had not sufficient Officers & had they granted me Marines most likely the affair would never have happened – I had not a Spirited & brave fellow about me & the Mutineers treated them as such. My conduct has been free of blame, & I showed everyone that, tied as I was, I defied every Villain to hurt me...|$|E
25|$|On 10 July, General Glaise-Horstenau added:Our {{troops have}} to be mute {{witnesses}} of such events; it does not reflect well on their otherwise high reputation... I am frequently told that German occupation troops would finally have to intervene against Ustaše crimes. This may happen eventually. Right now, with the available forces, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> ask for such action. Ad hoc intervention in individual cases could make the German Army look responsible for countless crimes which it could not prevent in the past.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, Polly, though I 've {{waited and}} hoped so long <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>n't</b> {{believe it when}} it came, and don't deserve it; but I will! for the {{knowledge}} that he loves me seems to make everything possible," [...] said Fanny, with an expression which made her really beautiful, {{for the first time}} in her life.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is {{very good}} of you to say that, but of course you can't like it! I was sure you would n't like it. But what <b>could</b> <b>I</b> do? I fell in love with her, and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>n't</b> run away simply to spare you a surprise. My dear Gordon," [...] Bernard added, [...] "you will get used to it." ...|$|R
60|$|MRS. JONES. Of {{course when}} I saw the box, your Worship, I was dreadfully upset, and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>n't</b> think {{why he had}} done such a thing; when the officer came we were having words about it, because it is ruin to me, your Worship, in my profession, and I have three little {{children}} dependent on me.|$|R
