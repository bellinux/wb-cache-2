25|$|In 1904, Hirschfeld {{joined the}} Bund für Mutterschutz (League for the Protection of Mothers), the feminist {{organization}} founded by Helene Stöcker. He campaigned for the <b>decriminalisation</b> of abortion, and against policies that banned female teachers and civil servants from marrying or having children.|$|E
25|$|On 18 December 2015 Shashi Tharoor, {{a member}} of the Indian National Congress, {{introduced}} a Private Members Bill for the <b>decriminalisation</b> of Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code in the Lok Sabha, but the motion was rejected by house by a vote of 71-24 with one abstention.|$|E
25|$|Each of {{the states}} and territories {{introduced}} their own anti-discrimination laws to protect LGBTI people from discrimination before the Commonwealth did so in 2013. The first anti-discrimination protections were enacted in New South Wales by the Wran Government in 1982, {{two years before the}} <b>decriminalisation</b> of homosexuality in that state.|$|E
25|$|Before {{and during}} the {{formation}} of the UK, Christianity and homosexuality clashed. Same-sex sexual activity was characterised as sinful and, under the Buggery Act 1533, was outlawed and punishable by death. LGBT rights first came to prominence following the <b>decriminalisation</b> of same-sex sexual activity across the UK between 1967 and 1982.|$|E
25|$|Tatchell later {{claimed that}} {{this was the first time}} gay liberation {{politics}} were publicly disseminated and discussed in a communist country, although he noted that, in terms of <b>decriminalisation</b> and the age of consent, gay men had greater rights in East Germany at the time than in Britain and much of the West.|$|E
25|$|The {{ideology}} of the Liberal Democrats draws from liberal ideas. The party is in favour of reform of traditional British {{institutions such as the}} Church of England, a change in the electoral system from first-past-the-post to proportional representation, and drug <b>decriminalisation.</b> The Liberal Democrats supported the adoption of the Euro and greater European integration.|$|E
25|$|The Greens {{support the}} {{implementation}} of the Portuguese model when it comes to drug law reform - specifically, the <b>decriminalisation</b> of all drugs and treating drug addiction as a health issue rather than a law and order issue. Their approach to drug legalisation is on a case by case basis. They support legalising cannabis for medical use.|$|E
25|$|After Labor won the 1972 election, McMahon {{resigned}} and Gorton stood as his successor; he polled only the fourth-most votes {{out of five}} candidates. Gorton served in the Shadow Ministry of Billy Snedden until after the 1974 election, when he was dropped. In 1973, Gorton moved a motion in parliament calling for the <b>decriminalisation</b> of homosexual acts between consenting adults in Australia. The motion was successful following a conscience vote.|$|E
25|$|SWAI (Sex Workers Alliance Ireland), is an {{advocacy}} group for sex workers in Ireland, was formed in 2009 by an alliance of individuals and groups to promote the social inclusion, health, safety, civil rights, {{and the right to}} self-determination of sex workers. SWAI actively advocates for the <b>decriminalisation</b> of sex work in Ireland and believes sex workers in Ireland should be free to work in safety without fear, judgment or stigma.|$|E
25|$|He {{subsequently}} {{retired from}} the House of Commons and was elevated to the peerage to take his seat in the House of Lords as Earl Attlee and Viscount Prestwood on 16 December 1955. In 1958, he was, along with numerous notables; to establish the Homosexual Law Reform Society. The society campaigned for the <b>decriminalisation</b> of homosexual acts in private by consenting adults, a reform which was voted through Parliament nine years later.|$|E
25|$|Gandhi {{has pushed}} for the {{empowerment}} of women. He backed the Women's Reservation Bill which would allow 33% reservation of all Lok Sabha and state legislative assembly seats for women. This bill passed the Rajya Sabha on 9 March 2010 but {{has not yet been}} voted on by the Lok Sabha as of February 2014. Gandhi has also backed the repeal of Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code and the <b>decriminalisation</b> of homosexuality.|$|E
25|$|Same-sex {{marriage}} in the United Kingdom {{has been the subject}} of wide debate since the <b>decriminalisation</b> of homosexuality in Britain. Previous legislation in England and Wales had prevented same-sex marriage, including the Marriage Act 1949 which defined marriage as between a man and a woman, the Nullity of Marriage Act 1971 which explicitly banned same-sex marriages, and the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 which reiterated the provisions of the Nullity of Marriage Act.|$|E
25|$|A Nielsen poll in 2012 {{found that}} only 27% of voters favoured <b>decriminalisation.</b> Australia has steep {{penalties}} for growing and using drugs even for personal use. with Western Australia having the toughest laws. There is an associated anti-drug culture amongst {{a significant number of}} Australians. Law enforcement targets drugs, particularly in the party scene. In 2012, crime statistics in Victoria revealed that police were increasingly arresting users rather than dealers, and the Liberal government banned the sale of bongs that year.|$|E
25|$|In 1975, the People's Supreme Court {{found in}} favour {{of a group of}} marginalised gay artists who were {{claiming}} compensation and reinstatement in their place of work. The court's ruling was the initial change in official attitudes towards gays and lesbians. In the same year, a new Ministry of Culture was formed under the leadership of Armando Hart Dávalos, resulting in a more liberal cultural policy. In addition, a commission was established to investigate homosexuality, leading to the <b>decriminalisation</b> of same-sex relationships in 1979.|$|E
25|$|Views on drug {{legality}} and policing {{vary greatly}} within the Conservative Party. Some Conservative politicians such as Alan Duncan take the libertarian approach that individual freedom and economic freedom {{of industry and}} trade should be respected. Other Conservative politicians, despite being economically liberal, are in favour of full prohibition of the ownership and trade of many drugs. Other Conservatives {{are in the middle}} ground, favouring stances such as looser regulation and <b>decriminalisation</b> of some drugs. Legalisation of cannabis for medical uses is favoured by some Conservative politicians, including Boris Johnson.|$|E
25|$|In 1965, Conservative peer Lord Arran {{proposed}} the <b>decriminalisation</b> of male homosexual acts (lesbian acts {{had never been}} illegal) in the House of Lords. This was followed by Humphry Berkeley in the House of Commons a year later, though Berkeley ascribed his defeat in the 1966 general election to the unpopularity of this action. However, in the newly elected Parliament, Labour MP Leo Abse took up the issue and the Sexual Offences Bill was put before Parliament in order to implement some of the Wolfenden Committee's recommendations after almost ten years of campaigning.|$|E
25|$|The Labour Party {{introduced}} {{charges for}} NHS dental services and glasses in 1951. The Conservatives returned {{to power in}} 1951, accepting most of Labour's postwar reforms, but introduced prescription charges to the NHS in 1952 and denationalized steel in 1953. They presided over 13 years of economic recovery and stability. However the Suez Crisis of 1956 demonstrated Britain {{was no longer a}} superpower. Ghana, Malaya, Nigeria and Kenya were granted independence during this period. Labour returned to power under Harold Wilson in 1964 and oversaw a series of social reforms including the <b>decriminalisation</b> of homosexuality and abortion, the relaxing of divorce laws and the banning of capital punishment. Edward Heath returned the Conservatives to power from 1970 to 1974, and oversaw the decimalisation of British currency, the ascension of Britain to the European Economic Community, and the height of the Troubles in Northern Ireland. In the wake of the oil crisis and a miner's strike, Heath introduced the three-day working week to conserve power.|$|E
25|$|The Criminal Law Amendment Act 1935 {{prohibited}} contraception {{and required}} sex crimes cases {{to be tried}} in camera, preventing media coverage and contributing to the illusion of Irish purity. In the 1950s there was much public attention around the plight of Irish women working as prostitutes in England. These were portrayed {{not so much as}} 'fallen' women, but rather as innocents lured into evil. The Women’s Liberation Movement of the 1970s helped to expose the double standards. Notable was the story of June Levine who collaborated with Lyn Madden, a former Dublin sex worker for twenty years in the 70s and 80s, to write Lyn: A Story of Prostitution (1987) Madden had seen her lover and pimp John Cullen firebomb the home of former sex worker and women's rights activist Dolores Lynch. Lynch perished in the fire together with her elderly mother and aunt. Madden denounced Culen and began writing the book during the ensuing trial, at which Cullen received eighteen years imprisonment. At around this time a group of street sex workers brought a successful supreme court challenge to the constitutionality of Victorian laws that required a defendant to first be identified as a common prostitute through the citing of previous convictions before conviction was possible. This successful challenge created a situation of effective <b>decriminalisation,</b> that also offered the women the same access to the protection of the law as anyone else. During this period prostitutes were largely independent and had a good relationship with the Gardaí. Pimping was almost unheard of, as were the other crimes previously associated with prostitution. Any suggestion of organised prostitution was limited to a small number of massage parlours in an environment where the workers were empowered to negotiate favourable terms and conditions for themselves. Also improving economic conditions and a weakening force of the Church allowed for a more visible and largely tolerated sex industry.|$|E
500|$|Benn {{supported}} various LGBT social movements, {{which were}} then known as gay liberation; Benn had voted in favour of <b>decriminalisation</b> in 1967. Talking about Section 28 of the 1988 Local Government Act, a piece of anti-gay legislation preventing the [...] "promotion of homosexuality", Benn said: ...|$|E
500|$|In {{response}} to a 2012 report by think-tank Australia 21, which recommended the relaxation of illicit drug laws in Australia, Gillard rejected the report and claimed that [...] "drugs kill people they rip families apart, they destroy lives... I am not in favour of <b>decriminalisation</b> of any of our drug laws." ...|$|E
500|$|Following the <b>decriminalisation</b> of [...] "buggery" [...] in 1993, {{gay rights}} {{was not a}} {{high-profile}} issue in Ireland. From 2001 however, Irish media increasingly covered international developments in the same-sex partnerships issue. This has included coverage of reports on the issue, legal cases taken by Irish same-sex couples, surrogate parenthood, adoption, extra-legal same-sex unions, blessings and the foreign partnerships of Irish politicians. There was extensive coverage of the 2005 introduction of civil partnerships by the British Government, which applies to Northern Ireland.|$|E
500|$|In 1972, a Swedish court fined McCartney £1,000 for {{cannabis}} possession. Soon after, Scottish {{police found}} marijuana plants growing on his farm, leading to his 1973 conviction for illegal cultivation and a £100 fine. As {{a result of}} his drug convictions, the US government repeatedly denied him a visa until December 1973. Arrested again for marijuana possession in 1975, in Los Angeles, Linda took the blame, and the court soon dismissed the charges. In January 1980, when Wings flew to Tokyo for a tour of Japan, customs officials found approximately 8ounces (200g) of cannabis in his luggage. They arrested McCartney and brought him to a local jail while the Japanese government decided what to do. After ten days, they released and deported him without charge. In 1984, while McCartney was on holiday in Barbados, authorities arrested him for possession of marijuana and fined him $200. Upon his return to England, he stated: [...] "cannabis is... less harmful than rum punch, whiskey, nicotine and glue, all of which are perfectly legal... I don't think... I was doing anyone any harm whatsoever." [...] In 1997, he spoke out in support of <b>decriminalisation</b> of the drug: [...] "People are smoking pot anyway and to make them criminals is wrong." [...] He did however, decide to quit cannabis in 2015, citing a desire to set a good example for his grandchildren.|$|E
2500|$|David Cameron, {{the then}} new Conservative prime minister, said the murders were a [...] "terrible shock". He said the <b>decriminalisation</b> of {{prostitution}} should be [...] "looked at again", {{but he also}} added that: [...] "I don't think we should jump to conclusions on this – {{there are all sorts}} of problems that <b>decriminalisation</b> would bring." [...] Later, aides close to Cameron strongly insisted he was not suggesting prostitution should be legalised and was more concerned with addressing the social problems surrounding it such as encouraging agencies to work together to help women off the streets or to combat drug addiction. Cameron has also called for tougher action on kerb-crawling and drug abuse.|$|E
2500|$|South Australia was {{the first}} {{jurisdiction}} to decriminalise male homosexual activity on 17 September 1975, with the Australian Capital Territory's <b>decriminalisation</b> proposed in 1973 {{and approved by the}} Fraser federal government with effect from 4 November 1976. Victoria followed on 23 December 1980, although a [...] "soliciting for immoral purposes" [...] provision added by conservatives saw police harassment continue in that state for several years. The next jurisdictions to decriminalise male homosexuality were the Northern Territory (4 October 1983), New South Wales (22 May 1984) and after four failed attempts, Western Australia (7 December 1989). In exchange for <b>decriminalisation,</b> Western Australian conservatives required a higher age of consent and an anti-proselytising provision similar to the United Kingdom's section 28.|$|E
2500|$|Bharatiya Janata Party {{senior leader}} Arun Jaitley stated in February 2014 that he {{supported}} <b>decriminalisation</b> of homosexuality. On 13 January 2015, BJP spokesperson Shaina NC, appearing on NDTV, stated, [...] "We BJP are for decriminalising homosexuality. That is the progressive way forward." ...|$|E
2500|$|English is {{regarded}} as more socially conservative than his predecessor, John Key. He has stated his opposition to voluntary euthanasia and physician assisted suicide, same-sex civil unions, and the <b>decriminalisation</b> of prostitution. He also opposes any [...] "liberalisation" [...] of abortion law.|$|E
2500|$|In 2000, Corbyn {{signed an}} Early Day Motion {{calling for the}} <b>decriminalisation</b> of {{cannabis}}. Despite having never smoked cannabis himself, Corbyn said in the 2015 Labour leadership election [...] "we should be adult and grown up and decriminalise cannabis". Later, in the 2016 Labour leadership election, Corbyn called for the <b>decriminalisation</b> of cannabis for medicinal purposes, but said that he wouldn't support legalising recreational drugs. He said about them that he wanted people to be [...] "educated away from" [...] taking drugs, and further stated that he [...] "would also {{want to look at}} supporting people who {{want to get out of}} the drugs trade in other parts of the world because there is the horrors of the drugs war that's going on in Central America".|$|E
2500|$|However, orders-in-council {{are also}} {{sometimes}} {{used by the}} United Kingdom government to push through measures which are unpopular locally, and {{would be difficult to}} pass using the normal democratic process. [...] Recent examples of this include the abolition of the death penalty for murder in 1991, and the <b>decriminalisation</b> of homosexuality in 2000.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the wake}} of the Black Saturday bushfires, in which 173 died, Nalliah claimed he had {{received}} [...] "prophetic dreams" [...] on 21 October 2008 that these bushfires were a [...] "consequence" [...] of Victoria's <b>decriminalisation</b> of abortion in 2008, prompting criticism from a former Australian Treasurer, Peter Costello, that Nalliah's assertion was [...] "beyond the bounds of decency".|$|E
2500|$|In response, a counter-campaign called [...] "Turn Off the Blue Light" [...] {{was created}} by sex workers and {{supporters}} in favour of <b>decriminalisation</b> to rebut {{what they see as}} misleading information and to present a positive image of sex workers in Ireland. A chief complaint it has of the [...] "Turn Off The Red Light" [...] campaign is that it conflates legal and consensual sex work with illegal human trafficking.|$|E
2500|$|Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh {{spokesperson}} Ram Madhav in {{an interview}} with national daily Business Standard said in May 2014: [...] "But I can say this — that while glorification of certain forms of social behaviour is not something we endorse, the penalising and criminalisation aspects need to be looked into. Whether to call homosexuality a crime and treat it as one {{in this day and age}} is questionable" [...] which is interpreted as Sangh's support to <b>decriminalisation</b> of homosexuality.|$|E
2500|$|Various Hindu organisations, {{based in}} India and abroad have {{supported}} <b>decriminalisation</b> of homosexual behaviours. In 2009, the Hindu Council UK {{became one of}} the first major religious organisations to support LGBT rights when they issued a statement [...] "Hinduism does not condemn homosexuality". Sri Sri Ravi Shankar, a prominent Hindu spiritual leader, has condemned sec 377 in a series of tweets, maintaining that [...] "Hinduism has never considered homosexuality a crime" [...] and [...] "to brand a person a criminal based on sexual preference would be absurd." ...|$|E
2500|$|After the 2006 elections, {{the issue}} faded {{from the public}} debate. In January 2008, seven Swedish members of {{parliament}} from the conservative Moderate Party, {{senior member of the}} governing Alliance coalition, authored a piece in a Swedish tabloid calling for the complete <b>decriminalisation</b> of filesharing. The Swedish members of parliament wrote that [...] "Decriminalising all non-commercial file sharing and forcing the market to adapt is not just the best solution. It's the only solution, unless we want an ever more extensive control of what citizens do on the Internet." ...|$|E
2500|$|Existing laws criminalise {{homosexual}} {{behavior with}} prison sentences lasting up to 14 years. These laws are remnants of British colonialism designed to punish what colonial authorities deemed [...] "unnatural sex" [...] among local Ugandan people. In some areas, male homosexuality was age-stratified, similar to ancient Greece where warriors purchased boys as brides, common when {{women were not}} available, or manifested as fleeting encounters as in prostitution. Human rights groups have demanded reform of those laws and <b>decriminalisation</b> of homosexuality and asserted that the laws reinforce prejudice and promote violence against LGBT people.|$|E
2500|$|In 2011, Sting joined {{more than}} 30 others {{in an open}} letter to British Prime Minister David Cameron for [...] "immediate <b>de{{criminal}}isation</b> of drug possession" [...] if a policy review showed it had failed. Sting was quoted: [...] "Giving young people criminal records for minor drug possession serves little purpose — it is time to think of more imaginative ways of addressing drug use in our society." [...] In August 2014, Sting was one of 200 signatories to a letter to The Guardian opposing Scottish independence {{from the rest of the}} UK in the run-up to September's referendum on that issue.|$|E
