Hence, multiply-agile encryption provides enhanced solutions to the secrecy, interoperability and quality of service issues in high-speed networks.

5000|$|A TACLANE (short for [...] "Tactical FASTLANE" [...] or Tactical Local Area Network Encryption) is {{a family}} of Inline Network Encryptors (INE) {{developed}} and manufactured by General Dynamics Mission Systems to meet the National Security Agency (NSA) requirements for High Assurance Internet Protocol <b>Encryptor</b> (HAIPE version 4.1 as of Nov 2013).|$|E
50|$|The KIV-7 is a National Security Agency Type-1, single-channel <b>encryptor</b> {{originally}} {{designed in the}} mid-1990s by AlliedSignal Corporation {{to meet the demand}} for secure data communications from personal computers (PC), workstations, and FAXs. It has data rates up to 512 kbit/s and is interoperable with the KG-84, KG-84A, and KG-84C data encryption devices.|$|E
50|$|In addition, new {{products}} and technologies including software defined radios, next generation bulk <b>encryptor</b> and high data tactical radio were also on show. Airborne products displayed included radar finger printing system, data link, digital flight control computer and identification friend or foe. Also on display were the complete range of optoelectronic equipment, including night vision devices, digital handheld compass and an advanced land navigation system.|$|E
50|$|The TACLANE {{devices are}} Type 1, key-agile, In-line Network <b>Encryptors</b> that provide network {{communications}} security on Internet Protocol (IP) and Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) networks {{for the individual}} user or for enclaves of users at the same security level. They are typically deployed in Department of Defense (DOD) tactical and strategic networks, government agencies and their contractors.|$|R

In this paper we evaluate {{the use of}} software based inline encryption algorithms for wireless LANs that are implemented in the Layer Service Provider as de#ned by WinSock 2 for Windows. The evaluated encryption algorithms run on each PC {{that is part of}} the wireless LAN. We present the throughput requirements from the inline <b>encryptors</b> for various multimedia applications such as video conferencing, collaborative work, distributed data bases and distributed processing. Our measurements show that software implementation of various <b>encryptors</b> provides enough throughput as required by the above applications. I.

40|$|Several generic {{programs}} for converting values from regular datatypes {{to some other}} format, together with their corresponding inverses, are constructed. Among the formats considered are shape plus contents, compact bit streams and pretty printed strings. The dierent data conversion programs are constructed using John Hughes' arrow combinators along with a proof that printing (from a regular datatype to another format) followed by parsing (from that format back to the regular datatype) is the identity. The printers and parsers are described in PolyP, a polytypic extension of the functional language Haskell. 1 Introduction Many programs convert data from one format to another, for example, parsers, pretty printers, data compressors, <b>encryptors</b> and functions that communicate with a database. Some of these programs, such as parsers and pretty printers, critically depend {{on the structure of}} the input data. Other programs, such as most data compressors and <b>encryptors,</b> more or less ignore [...] ...|$|R

In response, the NSA had modifications made to other units in the field, presumably changing the crypto algorithm in some way, perhaps by changing the shift register feedback taps. Starting in the mid-1980s, the KW-26 system was decommissioned by NSA, being replaced by the more advanced solid-state data <b>encryptor,</b> TSEC/KG-84.|$|E

40|$|A generic {{compact printer}} and a {{corresponding}} parser are constructed. These programs transform values of any regular datatype {{to and from}} a bit stream.

50|$|Even for Internet access, {{where there}} is not a per-packet charge, ISPs make {{statistical}} assumption that connections from user sites will not be busy 100% of the time.

5000|$|A High Assurance Internet Protocol <b>Encryptor</b> (HAIPE) is a Type 1 {{encryption}} device that {{complies with the}} National Security Agency's HAIPE IS (formerly the HAIPIS, the High Assurance Internet Protocol Interoperability Specification). The cryptography used is Suite A and Suite B, also specified by the NSA {{as part of the}} Cryptographic Modernization Program. HAIPE IS is based on IPsec with additional restrictions and enhancements. One of these enhancements includes the ability to encrypt multicast data using a [...] "preplaced key" [...] (see definition in List of cryptographic key types). This requires loading the same key on all HAIPE devices that will participate in the multicast session in advance of data transmission. A HAIPE is typically a secure gateway that allows two enclaves to exchange data over an untrusted or lower-classification network.|$|E
50|$|LPS {{comes with}} Encryption Wizard (EW), a simple, strong file and folder <b>encryptor</b> for {{protection}} of sensitive but unclassified information (FOUO, Privacy Act, CUI, etc.). Written in Java, EW encrypts all file types for {{data at rest}} and data in transit protection. Without installation or elevated privileges, EW runs on Windows, Mac, Linux, Solaris, and other computers that support the Java software platform. With a simple drag and drop interface, EW offers 128-bit AES encryption, SHA-256 hashing, RSA signatures, searchable metadata, archives, compression, secure deleting, and PKI/CAC/PIV support. Encryption can be keyed from a passphrase or a PKI certificate. EW is GOTS—U.S. Government invented, owned, and supported software—and comes in two versions, a public version that uses the standard Java cryptographic library and a government-only version that uses a FIPS-140-2 certified crypto stack licensed from RSA Security. The two versions interoperate.|$|E

After Dr. Marbles drains Hacker's battery and banishes him to the Northern Frontier, Digit is able to escape Hacker. Eventually Hacker is {{able to find a}} way to recharge himself, build Buzz and Delete, and formulate a plan to launch a virus that attacks Motherboard.
