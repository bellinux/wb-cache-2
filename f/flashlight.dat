5|$|Five Nights at Freddy's 4 reintroduces removed tools, {{specifically}} {{the doors and}} <b>flashlight,</b> albeit with slightly altered usage. The doors can only be closed when the player is next to them, and will re-open if the player moves away. However, if the player shuts the doors too early, the animatronics will jump scare the player when the door is opened. The <b>flashlight</b> can no-longer run out, but only alerts player {{to the presence of}} animatronics as opposed to warding them away, excluding the miniature Freddies that appear on the bed. If the player flashes the <b>flashlight</b> while an animatronic is in the doorway, the player will be jumpscared. There is one new mechanic, where the player must listen for breathing audio. This can determine whether to use the <b>flashlight</b> or close the door.|$|E
5|$|Some {{aspects of}} Nancy's {{portrayal}} have remained relatively constant through the decades. Arguably her most characteristic physical depiction {{is that she}} is shown holding a <b>flashlight.</b>|$|E
5|$|Manganese(IV) oxide {{was used}} in the {{original}} type of dry cell battery as an electron acceptor from zinc, and is the blackish material in carbon–zinc type <b>flashlight</b> cells. The manganese dioxide is reduced to the manganese oxide-hydroxide MnO(OH) during discharging, preventing the formation of hydrogen at the anode of the battery.|$|E
5000|$|Solar powered <b>flashlights</b> or solar powered torches are <b>flashlights</b> {{powered by}} solar energy stored in {{rechargeable}} batteries. Most of these <b>flashlights</b> use light-emitting diodes lamps [...] {{since they have}} lower energy consumption compared to incandescent light bulbs.|$|R
50|$|Items such as <b>flashlights.</b> The {{player can}} {{stock up on}} <b>flashlights</b> and use at any time at the enemy.|$|R
50|$|Solar powered lights {{need not}} be {{manually}} recharged {{as in the case}} of conventional battery operated <b>flashlights.</b> Pollution from discarded batteries used in normal <b>flashlights</b> is eliminated. Solar powered <b>flashlights</b> can be used in remote locations where it is impossible to find any source of electricity except for solar power.|$|R
5|$|The Taken are {{protected}} by a shield of darkness, initially rendering them impervious to attack; they can only be injured with a firearm after exposure to light, which burns the darkness away. This puts significant emphasis on flashlights in conjunction with conventional weapons, such as a revolver or shotgun. <b>Flashlight</b> beams act as a reticle. The handheld lights Wake can carry can be boosted, which destroys the darkness faster, but also reduces the light's battery level. Besides the conventional shooter gameplay need for reloading ammunition, the player must also insert fresh batteries into the <b>flashlight</b> when they run out, or {{wait for it to}} recharge slowly. The strength of the darkness protecting an enemy can vary among the Taken. The amount of darkness remaining is represented by a corona of light that appears when aiming at an enemy, and a stronger darkness may recharge over time. When a Taken is finally destroyed, it disappears.|$|E
5|$|At home, staying {{informed}} about volcanic activity, and having contingency plans {{in place for}} alternative shelter locations, constitutes good preparedness for an ash fall event. This can prevent some impacts associated with ash fall, reduce the effects, and increase the human capacity to cope with such events. A few items such as a <b>flashlight,</b> plastic sheeting to protect electronic equipment from ash ingress, and battery operated radios, are extremely useful during ash fall events.|$|E
5|$|Gameplay in Silent Hill 3 resembles closely {{that of its}} two predecessors, {{the three}} main {{gameplay}} elements being combat, exploration, and puzzle-solving. Combat, as well as exploration, takes place in third-person view, with the player able to equip weapons found throughout the game. Heather may also block and perform side-step maneuvers to avoid enemies. As series staples, the <b>flashlight</b> and radio return, the latter of which crackles when monsters are within close proximity.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} power source for <b>flashlights</b> is the battery. Primary (disposable) battery types used in <b>flashlights</b> include button cells, carbon-zinc {{batteries}} in both regular and heavy duty types, alkaline, and lithium.|$|R
50|$|<b>Flashlights</b> {{intended}} for {{use in hazardous areas}} with flammable gas or dust are tested to ensure they cannot set off an explosion. <b>Flashlights</b> approved for flammable gas areas will have markings indicating the approving agency (MSHA, ATEX, UL etc.) and symbols for the conditions that were tested. <b>Flashlights</b> for hazardous areas may be designed to automatically disconnect the lamp if the bulb is broken, to prevent ignition of flammable gas.|$|R
5000|$|Surefire {{produces}} <b>flashlights</b> of widely varying {{sizes and}} power outputs from single-cell lights to large 20-cell HID models. Most of its <b>flashlights</b> are powered by primary lithium CR123A batteries {{that allow for}} compact size and low weight while offering high power output. These batteries offer a long shelf-life, but are more costly than zinc-based cells. Several <b>flashlights</b> are available with rechargeable battery packs. In 2010, Surefire released the E2L AA, designed to operate on AA batteries, as does the Minimus™ AA headlamp. Surefire sells rechargeable [...] "LFP123A" [...] lithium ion batteries for all LED <b>flashlights</b> {{as a replacement for}} CR123A. Surefire also produces military weapon lights for mounting on handguns, rifles, sub-machine guns and shotguns. Surefire's Z2 CombatLight is standard issue to the FBI and the Federal Air Marshal Service, and their various handheld lights are a frequent choice of police, military, fire, and EMS personnel. Some models of handheld <b>flashlights</b> include an integrated [...] "strike bezel" [...] for use as a self-defense weapon. All of Surefire's <b>flashlights</b> are manufactured in the United States, although components such as LEDs are sometimes sourced overseas.|$|R
5|$|Krug {{was born}} Judith Fingeret in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on March 15, 1940. Her {{interest}} in {{freedom of speech}} was fostered from an early age. She recalled reading a book about sex education under the covers in her bedroom with a <b>flashlight</b> {{at the age of}} 12. Her mother found her and asked what she was doing. When she held up the book, her mother allowed her to continue reading and told her to turn on the bedroom light so she could read properly and avoid damage to her eyes.|$|E
5|$|When Peter {{returns the}} next day, Jan and Jule {{do not tell}} him about their {{activities}} the night before. Jule realises that her mobile phone is gone, and she and Jan leave later that night {{to look for it}} in the house. After she finds it, Hardenberg walks in the door and struggles with Jule when he recognises her. Hearing them, Jan comes downstairs and knocks Hardenberg unconscious with a <b>flashlight.</b> Not knowing what to do, they call Peter and he comes to their aid.|$|E
5|$|In Luigi's Mansion, {{the main}} story is played out over four stages, with players able to also access a {{training}} {{room and a}} gallery at the laboratory of Professor E. Gadd between stages. In each stage, players control Luigi as he explores the mansion's rooms and hunts down the ghosts that lay within them, acquiring keys to get through locked doors and eventually dealing with a boss ghost hidden {{at the end of}} the stage, with more rooms becoming accessible as each stage is completed. To assist him in his task, Luigi uses a <b>flashlight</b> and two inventions supplied by E. Gadd - the Poltergust 3000, a specially modified, high powered vacuum cleaner; and the Game Boy Horror, a parody of Nintendo's Game Boy Color.|$|E
50|$|Although most <b>flashlights</b> are {{designed}} for user replacement of the batteries and the bulb as needed, fully sealed disposable <b>flashlights,</b> such as inexpensive keyring lights, are made. When the batteries are depleted or the bulb fails, the entire product is discarded.|$|R
50|$|Incandescent <b>flashlights</b> use {{incandescent}} light bulbs {{which consists of}} a glass bulb and a tungsten filament. The bulbs are under vacuum or filled with argon, krypton or xenon. Some high-power incandescent <b>flashlights</b> use a halogen lamp where the bulb contains a halogen gas such as iodine or bromine to improve the life and efficacy of the bulb. In all but disposable or novelty <b>flashlights,</b> the bulb is user-replaceable; the bulb life may be only a few hours.|$|R
50|$|Some players {{customize}} their airsoft guns, {{either to}} improve performance or for purely aesthetic reasons. Additions include scopes, lasers, and <b>flashlights.</b> The most popular scope is the red dot sight. Mounted <b>flashlights</b> can be used tactically in games played in dark environments.|$|R
5|$|Late {{one night}} in 1997, Boston Herald {{reporter}} Tom Mashberg was driven to a warehouse in Red Hook, Brooklyn by William Youngworth {{to see what was}} purported to be The Storm on the Sea of Galilee. Youngworth was a career criminal and associate to New England art thief Myles Connor Jr. Mashberg had been investigating the theft and was briefly allowed to view the painting with a <b>flashlight.</b> He was given a vial of paint chips for authenticity. These were later confirmed by experts to be fragments of Dutch 17th-century origin—but not from the stolen painting. It was never concretely determined to be real or fake, and the FBI quit speaking to Youngworth after not making any progress. The painting has since disappeared.|$|E
5|$|The Do 17F-1 was a {{long-range}} reconnaissance aircraft based on field modified Do 17Es. The Do 17 prototype V8 {{was used to}} test the configuration of the F-1 and V11 for the F-2. The defensive armament consisted of a MG 15 in the B- and C-Stand (B-Stand - an upper rear firing position, C-Stand — lower gun emplacement). The fuselage had two cameras along with six ejector tubes for <b>flashlight</b> cartridges. The F-1 would see service until replaced by the Do 17 P in 1938. Only one F-2 was ever built, it was designated D-ACZJ and was used by Zeiss-Jena Company as a factory aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Two people {{disappear}} {{along the}} Appalachian Trail: {{a young man}} jogging with his girlfriend and a hermit who rarely leaves his home. Sheriff Grady Barnes (Gary Busey) finds a trail in the woods which leads him to parts of the hermit's body. That night, young Roy Satterly (Ty Wood) is reading by <b>flashlight</b> when a Bengal tiger briefly appears {{in front of his}} bedroom window. In the morning, his mother, Rose (Marina Stephenson Kerr), finds him sleepwalking in the woods in front of their house. A cast taken at the next victim's scene points to a tiger as the hermit's killer, so Sheriff Barnes holds a press conference to warn the public. The Bengal Tiger visits Roy's home again that night.|$|E
50|$|Rechargeable <b>flashlights</b> {{have been}} known to fail at {{inappropriate}} times. Because of this, many officers carry additional non-rechargeable <b>flashlights.</b> These lights must be small, light, bright and absolutely dependable. These lights may be kept in a holder on the belt, or in a trouser pocket.|$|R

5|$|Amanda {{encounters}} several antagonists {{over the}} course of the game, including hostile humans and androids. These foes can be defeated with gunplay or other offensive means. There is also a single alien creature that pursues the player. The alien creature cannot be defeated, requiring the player to use stealth tactics in order to survive. Instead of following a predetermined path, the alien has the ability to actively investigate disturbances and hunt the player by sight or sound. Along the way, the player can use both a <b>flashlight</b> and a motion tracker to detect the alien's movements. However, using any of these increases the chance of the alien finding the player. For example, if the alien is moving and close enough, the tracker's sound will attract the alien, forcing the player to wisely use the tracker and remove it as soon as it detects motion. The motion tracker cannot detect enemies when they are not moving and cannot determine whether the alien creature is up in the ducts or on ground level.|$|E
5|$|Commercials {{instructed}} fans to mail in episodes' geographical destinations during sweeps week. Advertisements appeared through Time Warner's television channels, Sports Illustrated for Kids, DC Comics publications, radio stations, and Warner Brothers stores. The contest {{marked the}} first time that Cartoon Network U.S., TNT Europe, Cartoon Network Europe, Cartoon Network Asia, and Cartoon Network Latin America united for a single promotion. Turner encouraged local cable operators to submit their own spots, generating 34,000ads among 174cable systems for a total of $3.4million cross-channel media support. 50,000children with a median age of ten entered the competition, and 20,000answered correctly. Turner selected ten viewers from the United States and nine from Latin America and Asia as grand-prize winners. They and two-hundred others received Quest-themed adventure packs, including a backpack, <b>flashlight</b> and siren, travel journal, pen, T-shirt, and glow sticks. Cartoon Network aired the names of winning children on a special feature in which Jeremiah Surd issued personal threats.|$|E
5|$|Development {{continued}} largely at {{the urging}} of the Admiralty, who saw it as a solution to detecting the conning towers of partially submerged U-Boats. After a visit by Tizard to GEC's Hirst Research Centre in Wembley in November 1939, and a follow-up visit by Watt, the company took up development and developed a working 25cm set using modified VT90s by the summer of 1940. With this success, Lovell and a new addition to the Airborne Group, Alan Lloyd Hodgkin, began experimenting with horn-type antennas that would offer significantly higher angular accuracy. Instead of broadcasting the radar signal across the entire forward hemisphere of the aircraft and listening to echoes from everywhere in that volume, this system would allow the radar to be used like a <b>flashlight,</b> pointed in the direction of observation. This would greatly increase the amount of energy falling on a target, and improve detection capability.|$|E
50|$|Industrial, marine, {{public safety}} and {{military}} organizations develop specifications for <b>flashlights</b> in specialized roles. Typically, light output, overall dimensions, battery compatibility and durability are required to meet minimum limits. <b>Flashlights</b> may be tested for impact resistance, water and chemical resistance, and for {{the life span of}} the control switch.|$|R
50|$|Since {{they are}} always ready for use, {{mechanically}} powered <b>flashlights</b> are often kept as emergency lights in case of power outages or other emergencies. They are also kept at vacation homes, cabins, and other remote locations {{because they are not}} limited by battery shelf life like ordinary <b>flashlights.</b> They are considered a green technology, because the disposable batteries used by ordinary <b>flashlights</b> are wasteful in terms of resources used for the amount of energy produced, and also contain heavy metals and toxic chemicals which end up in the environment.|$|R
50|$|The United States Army former {{standard}} MIL-F-3747E {{described the}} performance standard for plastic <b>flashlights</b> using {{two or three}} D cell dry batteries, in either straight or angle form, and in standard, explosion-proof, heat-resistant, traffic direction, and inspection types. The standard described only incandescent lamp <b>flashlights</b> and was withdrawn in 1996.|$|R
5|$|In {{the second}} setting, the player guides Harry Mason in an over-the-shoulder view as he {{searches}} for his missing daughter Cheryl in the snowy town of Silent Hill. Harry {{is equipped with}} a smartphone and flashlight: he can use the phone to check his location on a Global Positioning System map, take photographs, and make telephone calls. Moving to certain spots with high interference, represented by a lot of radio noise, or by taking pictures of spots where shadowy figures can be seen, unlock various text and voicemail messages that expand the story and occasionally provide clues. To view the details of various documents, the player can zoom in on objects. The game also alters details of gameplay based on what the player views. Throughout his journey, Harry encounters puzzles such as mechanisms, which reward either a key required to progress or a bonus memento. In the Wii version, the Wii Remote is used for puzzle solving and to control the <b>flashlight</b> and cell phone.|$|E
5|$|Parsons, the Enola Gays weaponeer, was {{concerned}} about the possibility of an accidental detonation if the plane crashed on takeoff, so he decided not to load the four cordite powder bags into the gun breech until the aircraft was in flight. Parsons and his assistant, Second Lieutenant Morris R. Jeppson, made their way into the bomb bay along the narrow catwalk on the port side. Jeppson held a <b>flashlight</b> while Parsons disconnected the primer wires, removed the breech plug, inserted the powder bags, replaced the breech plug, and reconnected the wires. Before climbing to altitude on approach to the target, Jeppson switched the three safety plugs between the electrical connectors of the internal battery and the firing mechanism from green to red. The bomb was then fully armed. Jeppson monitored the bomb's circuits.|$|E
5|$|The game {{begins with}} Luigi having won a mansion in a contest. Despite not having entered any contest, he {{promptly}} told Mario about the mansion, {{and the two}} agreed to meet up outside it that evening. Luigi takes a <b>flashlight</b> {{with him and he}} follows the map to the mansion. Upon finally arriving at his new mansion, which looks much more sinister than the supplied photo, Mario is nowhere to be found. Luigi proceeds inside the mansion, entering the Parlor after he gains the key from a strange ghost-like shape. Upon entry, he is soon assaulted by a Gold Ghost, only to be saved by a little old man wielding a vacuum cleaner. The old man, however, is unable to reel in the ghost and is soon overpowered. After being helped to his feet by Luigi, the old man introduces himself as Professor Elvin Gadd. The two retreat from the mansion when more of the Gold Ghosts appear.|$|E
