5|$|While {{defended by}} those {{cultures}} {{in which it}} constitutes a tradition, FGC is opposed by many medical and cultural organizations {{on the grounds that}} it is unnecessary and harmful. Short term health effects may include hemorrhage, infection, sepsis, and even result in death, while long term effects include dyspareunia, dysmenorrhea, vaginitis and cystitis. In addition FGC leads to complications with pregnancy, labor and delivery. Reversal (defibulation) by skilled personnel may be required to open the scarred tissue. Amongst those opposing the practice are local grassroots groups, and national and international organisations including WHO, UNICEF, UNFPA and Amnesty International. Legislative efforts to ban FGC have rarely been successful and the preferred approach <b>is</b> <b>education</b> and empowerment and the provision of information about the adverse health effects as well the human rights aspects.|$|E

25|$|Afrocentric {{education}} <b>is</b> <b>education</b> {{designed to}} empower {{peoples of the}} African diaspora. A central premise behind it is that many Africans have been subjugated by limiting their awareness of themselves and indoctrinating them with ideas that work against them. To control a people's culture is to control their tools of self-determination in relationship to others. Like educational leaders of other cultures, proponents assert that what educates one group of people does not necessarily educate and empower another group–so they assert educational priorities distinctly for the Africans in a given context.|$|E

25|$|Socioeconomic factors {{significantly}} affect {{whether or not}} individuals develop the habit of voting. The most important socioeconomic factor affecting voter turnout <b>is</b> <b>education.</b> The more educated a person is, the more likely {{he or she is}} to vote, even controlling for other factors that are closely associated with education level, such as income and class. Income has some effect independently: wealthier {{people are more likely to}} vote, regardless of their educational background. There is some debate over the effects of ethnicity, race, and gender. In the past, these factors unquestionably influenced turnout in many nations, but nowadays the consensus among political scientists is that these factors have little effect in Western democracies when education and income differences are taken into account. However, since different ethnic groups typically have different levels of education and income, there are important differences in turnout between such groups in many societies. Other demographic factors have an important influence: young people are far less likely to vote than the elderly. Occupation has little effect on turnout, with the notable exception of higher voting rates among government employees in many countries.|$|E

2500|$|While the {{rationale}} behind the connection between Union College and Minerva is relatively clear, there is less agreement {{with respect to the}} history of the College's motto. [...] Its egalitarian theme is consistent with the non-denominational and generally democratic spirit of Union's founding. It also declares the brotherhood of man, or of the community of mankind, in a sense familiar to the Enlightenment (and, of course, to the French revolutionaries). But that it does so with the qualification [...] "under the laws of Minerva" [...] is important. [...] Even though Minerva was a pagan goddess, and the Union College founders devout Protestants, there was still plenty of room for a belief that men could come together as brothers in a community ruled by reason, virtue, and natural law (or, as the case may be, the Law of God). The Latin motto on the seal of Union University supports this argument: In necessariis unitas, in dubiis libertas, in omnibus caritas (English: Unity in necessary matters, freedom in doubtful matters, charity for all). An institution of higher learning fosters unity of purpose (hence [...] "brotherhood"), but not always unity of opinion, hence the freedom to disagree. The [...] "laws of Minerva" [...] enjoin rational thought rather than obligatory doctrine. Not surprisingly, the founders believed that the key to achieving this ideal state <b>is</b> <b>education.</b> [...] Nearly all of the differences among men, wherever they may be found, argued John Locke, are the result of diverse education. [...] The founders of Union College were unabashedly optimistic that education, learning, and science could build a better world.|$|E
2500|$|Many policy analysts {{consider}} literacy {{rates as}} a crucial measure to enhance a region's human capital. This claim is made {{on the grounds that}} literate people can be trained less expensively than illiterate people, generally have a higher socio-economic status and enjoy better health and employment prospects. If women are these illiterate people, that makes them even more disposable to their economy. Policy makers also argue that literacy for women increases job opportunities and access to higher education. Although it is often viewed that a woman working in the home benefits her family, it puts a strain on the whole community as education is {{one of the keys to}} success and being able to prosper. According to Ojo, women in Nigeria are harder-hit than men by poverty due to the lack of emphasis placed on female education, and the prevalence of early marriage which tend to further impoverish women, and subject them to statutory discrimination. The most important ingredient of employment opportunity <b>is</b> <b>education,</b> especially higher education. If employment opportunities are different, standards of living, life expectancies and other parameters of existence and of well-being, will be different. [...] "For Nigeria to achieve the goal of being among the largest 20 economies in the world, she must rapidly educate the children, most of all, the girls. Educating girls is known to be the basis for sound economic and social development. Educating girls produces mothers who are educated and who will in turn educate their children, care for their families and provide their children with adequate nutrition," [...] says Dr. Robert Limlim, UNICEF’s Deputy Representative. [...] "Therefore educating girls translates to better health for the children, reduction in child morbidity and mortality, thus triggering off a snowball effect of achieving all the other MDGs in a sustainable manner." ...|$|E
