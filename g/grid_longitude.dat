40|$|Abstract—A {{large number}} of {{pigmented}} skin lesions (PSL) is a strong predictor of malignant melanoma. Many dermatologists advocate total-body photography for high-risk patients because detecting new-appearing, disappearing, and changing PSL is important for early detection of the disease. However, manual inspection and matching of PSL is a subjective, tedious, and errorprone task. A computer program for tracking the corresponding PSL will greatly improve the matching process. In this paper, we describe {{the construction of the}} first human back template (atlas), which is used to facilitate spatial normalization of the PSL during the matching process. Four pairs of anatomically meaningful landmarks (neck, shoulder, armpit and hip points) are used as reference points on the back image. Using the landmarks, a <b>grid</b> with <b>longitudes</b> and latitudes is constructed and overlaid on each subject-specific back image. To perform spatial normalization, the grid is registered into the back template, a unit-square rectilinear grid. To demonstrate the benefits of using the back template, we apply several state of the art point matching algorithms on 56 pairs of real dermatological images and show that utilizing spatially normalized coordinates improves the PSL matching accuracies.

40|$|Abstract. Density of {{pigmented}} skin lesions (PSL) {{is a strong}} predictor of malignant melanoma. Some dermatologists advocate periodic fullbody scan for high-risk patients. It is clinically important to compare and detect changes in the number and appearance of PSL across time. However, manual inspection and matching of PSL is tedious, error-prone, and suffers from inter-rater variability. Therefore, an automatic method for tracking corresponding PSL would have significant health benefits. In order to automate the tracking of PSL in human back images, we must perform spatial normalization of the coordinates of each PSL, as is done in brain atlases. We propose the first human back template (atlas) to obtain this normalization. Four pairs of anatomically meaningful landmarks (neck, shoulder, armpit and hip points) are used as reference points on the skin-back image. Using the landmarks, a <b>grid</b> with <b>longitudes</b> and latitudes is constructed and overlaid on each subject specific back image.
