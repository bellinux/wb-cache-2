Hydrogen peroxide can be employed in small bipropellant rocket thrusters in combination with a Fuel Vapor Pressurized (FVP) feed system, where non-hypergolic propellant combinations are pressurized by the fuel vapor, often in the same tank divided by a flexible membrane.

Removal of sulfur compounds from hot coal gas products is investigated by using various metal oxide sorbents and membrane separation methods. The main requirements of these metal oxide sorbents are durability and high sulfur loading capacity during absorption-regeneration cycles. In this research, durable metal oxide sorbents were formulated. Reactivity of the formulated metal oxide sorbents with simulated coal gas mixtures was examined to search for an ideal sorbent formulation with a high-sulfur loading capacity suitable for removal {{of hydrogen}} sulfide from coal gases.

40|$|This {{paper is}} closed access. As aero gas turbine designs strive for ever greater {{efficiencies}} {{the trend is}} for engine overall pressure ratios to rise. Although this provides greater thermal efficiency it means that cycle temperatures also increase. Traditionally turbines have {{been the focus of}} cooling schemes to enable them to survive high temperatures. However, it is envisaged that the compressor delivery air will soon reach temperatures which mean they may require similar cooling strategies to the turbine. One such concept is akin to that of a turbine 'rim purge flow which ensures that hot, mainstream flow does not get ingested into rotor cavities. However, the main gas path in compressors is generally more aerodynamically sensitive than in turbines and introduction of a purge flow may be more penalizing. It is important to understand the impact such a flow may have on the primary gas path flow of a compressor and the <b>downstream</b> <b>combustion</b> system aerodynamics. This paper presents a preliminary investigation into the effects of a purge flow which enters the main gas path immediately upstream of the high pressure compressor outlet guide vane (OGV) row. Initial, simplified, CFD predictions clearly demonstrated the potential of the purge flow to negatively affect the OGV/pre-diffuser and alter the inlet conditions to the combustion system. Consequently, an experimental assessment was carried out using an existing fully annular, isothermal test facility which incorporated a bespoke 1. 5 stage axial compressor, engine relevant outlet guide vanes, pre-diffuser and downstream combustor geometry. Using CFD to guide the process the test rig was modified to allow a metered airflow to be introduced upstream of the outlet guide vanes. Importantly the flow was directed up the face of the rotor such that it picked up a representative swirl component prior to injection into the main gas path. The experimental data confirmed the CFD results and importantly demonstrated that the degradation in the combustor inlet flow resulted in an increased combustion system loss. At the proposed purge flow rate, equal to ∼ 1 % of the mainstream flow, these effects were small with the system loss increasing by ∼ 4 %. However, at higher purge flow rates (up to 3 %) these effects became notable and the OGV/pre-diffuser flow degraded significantly with a resultant increase in the combustion system loss of ∼ 13 %...|$|E
40|$|Advanced airbreathing {{propulsion}} systems used in Mach 4 - 6 mission scenarios, usually involve turbo-ramjet configurations. As the engines transition from turbojet to ramjet, {{there is an}} operational envelope where both engines operate simultaneously. In {{the first phase of}} our study, an over/under nozzle configuration was analyzed. The two plumes from the turbojet and ramjet interact {{at the end of a}} common 2 -D cowl, where they both reach an approximate Mach 3. 0 condition and then jointly expand to Mach 3. 6 at the common nozzle exit plane. For the problem analyzed, the turbojet engine operates at a higher nozzle pressure ratio than the ramjet, causes the turbojet plume overpowers the ramjet plume, deflecting it approximately 12 degrees downward and in turn the turbojet plume is deflected 6 degrees upward. In the process, shocks were formed at the deflections and a shear layer formed at the confluence of the two jets. This particular case was experimentally tested and the data were used to compare with a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) study using the PARC 2 D code. The CFD results were in good agreement with both static pressure distributions on the cowl separator and on nozzle walls. The thrust coefficients were also in reasonable agreement. In addition, inviscid relationships were developed around the confluence point, where the two exhaust jets meet, and these results compared favorably with the CFD results. In the second phase of our study, a 3 -D CFD solution was generated to compare with the 2 -D solution. The major difference between the 2 -D and 3 -D solutions was the interaction of the shock waves, generated by the plume interactions, on the sidewall. When a shock wave interacts with a sidewall and sidewall boundary layer, it is called a glancing shock sidewall interaction. These interactions entrain boundary layer flow down the shockline into a vortical flow pattern. The 3 -D plots show the streamlines being entrained down the shockline. The pressure of the flow also decreases slightly as the sidewall is approached. Other difference between the 2 -D and 3 -D solutions were a lowering of the nozzle thrust coefficient value from 0. 9850 (2 -D) to 0. 9807 (3 -D), where the experimental value was 0. 9790. In the third phase of our study, a different turbo-ramjet configuration was analyzed. The confluence of a supersonic turbojet and a subsonic ramjet in the turbine based combined-cycle (TBCC) propulsion system was studied by a 2 -D CFD code. In the analysis, Mach 1. 4 primary turbojet was mixed with the subsonic ramjet secondary flow in an ejector mode operation. Reasonable agreements were obtained with the supplied I-D TBCC solutions. For low downstream backpressure, the Fabri choke condition (Break-Point condition) was observed in the secondary flow within mixing zone. For sufficient high downstream backpressure, the Fabri choke no longer exist, the ramjet flow was reduced and the ejector flow became backpressure dependent. Highly non-uniform flow at ejector exit were observed, indicated that for smooth <b>downstream</b> <b>combustion,</b> the mixing of the two streams probably required some physical devices...|$|E

Four different nozzle exit profiles were used in the study: a uniform profile, one computed using only the nozzle geometry, one computed using the nozzle geometry and part of the upstream facility combustor, and one using the nozzle and the full facility combustor. Two cases were examined using the four profiles: a non-reacting case without coflow and a reacting case with hydrogen coflow. Results show that the nozzle exit profile has a significant effect on the external flowfield. The uniform profile produced the longest jet while the profile created with the full combustor produced the shortest jet. The nozzle-only and part-combustor profiles fell between the other two profiles.

40|$|A two-phase, {{reacting}} flow CFD {{code was}} used in the design and evaluation of NOx control strategies for two pulverized coal utility boilers. The effects of furnace staging, burner alterations, and water injection were assessed in these furnaces. CFD analysis was shown to be a useful tool in optimizing NOx reduction while minimizing adverse effects such as increases in furnace CO emission and carbon in fly ash. The first boiler evaluated was a 265 MW B&W subcritical, opposed-wall fired, unstaged furnace. Furnace CFD simulations identified locations of highest flue gas mass flows and highest CO and O 2 concentrations and were used to identify OFA port locations for maximum NOx reduction. Simulations of an OFA and burner alteration configuration that has been subsequently installed predicted a 34 % reduction in NOx emission with minimal changes in furnace exit CO and unburned carbon in fly ash. Plant CEMS data confirmed the accuracy of the modeling results for both the pre-retrofit and the post-retrofit operations The second furnace analyzed was a 153 MW B&W subcritical, roof-fired furnace. This furnace is equipped with 10 multi-tip burners and 10 NOx ports located below the burners. A CFD analysis predicted that a 23 % decrease in NOx emission with little adverse effect on furnace exit CO or carbon in fly ash was achievable through a combination of deeper staging and burner alterations. Further CFD analysis identified high NOx production zones in the downstream part of the combustion zone.

Keeping this in mind, current research work is being carried out for reducing NOx produced from combustors. The objective of this research is to determine the feasibility of Distributed Combustion Systems (DCS) for increasing efficiency and reducing NOx emissions. ^ A DCS has a main combustion zone (MCZ) where 90 % of the fuel is burned and is followed by a secondary combustion zone (SCZ) in which jets carrying fuel are injected into the vitiated crossflow from the MCZ. This fuel jet auto-ignites {{under the influence of the}} high temperature vitiated crossflow. A new type of accelerating distributed combustion system has been designed in this project. In the current design, higher Mach numbers of the main flow can be obtained at the jet exit after reducing the exit area of secondary combustion zone by about five times compared to the inlet. Along with the design, a detailed one-dimensional heat transfer analysis has been performed. A Matlab code was used to determine whether final temperatures of the thermal barrier coating (TBC) and cooling water fall within acceptable design constraints. Conduction, convection, and radiation at steady state were used for determining heat transfer relationships between different materials. Water and nitrogen flow rates as well as the dimensions of cooling water channels were varied parametrically to find ideal conditions. Based on the heat transfer calculations, 8. 5 gpm water are needed to cool the secondary combustion zone to maintain temperature within material property limits. ^ Various laser-based measurement techniques such as Planar Laser-Induced Flourescence (PLIF), Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV), and Coherent Anti-Stokes Raman Spectroscopy (CARS) will be performed to study the combustion in the accelerating flow channel.

40|$|The {{demand for}} {{alternative}} fuels has increased significantly {{during the previous}} decades {{in order to reduce}} pollutants and increase the amount of energy that can be generated from non-fossil fuels. However, the use of new fuels faces many issues especially the problem of stability of operation which sometimes can cause severe damages to the system hardware. Thus the development of flexible combustion systems for gas turbines becomes urgent in order to achieve high reliability with these new sources of energy. Swirl stabilized combustion is the most widely spread deployed technology used to stabilize and control combustion in gas turbines and numerous other systems. However, the interaction of the swirling flows with the burner geometries is very complex and it has been proved that any change in the burner geometry can affect the flow field inside the combustion chamber, close to the burner mouth and <b>downstream</b> the <b>combustion</b> zone. Most burners are generally provided with a diffusive injector that centrally delivers well-known fuels allowing the stabilization of the system previous to entirely premixed conditions. Moreover, the injector anchors the central recirculation zone formed downstream of the nozzle. However, the use of injectors can also affect the stability limits of the system, especially the propagation of flashback through changes of shape of the shear layer since other structures such as the Combustion Induced Vortex Breakdown are suppressed due to the presence of this central body. However, the characterization of the flow and its impacts on the propagation of these and other flashback structures using different injectors has been briefly documented. Thus, this paper presents a series of experiments using a well-characterized tangential swirl burner to determine the impact of different central injector geometries on the flow field characteristics which directly affect the flow stagnation point downstream of the burner mouth and consequently the propagation of the Combustion Induced Vortex Breakdown. Results show how the use of various injectors and swirl numbers can impact on the flashback limits with a minimum outside diameter before which the Combustion Induced Vortex Breakdown is altered...|$|R

Even though the combustor flow field is quite complex, it can be realistically viewed as a collection of spatially developing and reacting supersonic mixing layers that are initially discrete, but that ultimately merge into larger more complex zones. These mixing layers begin downstream of a set of fuel injectors that introduce gaseous hydrogen in both a parallel and transverse direction into a supersonic air stream entering from the engine inlet.

The images provide a novel level of detail and allow for {{the determination of the}} effects of turbulence-flame and shock-flame interaction. In the slow-flame regime, vortex shedding off obstacle edges occurs over long time-scales, vortices are convected <b>downstream</b> and turbulent <b>combustion</b> takes place in the obstacle wakes.

The flow-field that governs the flame shape is established impulsively by the precursor shock. Shock-flame interactions lead to flame front perturbations on both small and large scales.

40|$|Large eddy {{simulation}} (LES) {{has been}} carried out to investigate a hydrogen-fueled scramjet combustor with dual cavity, where a Reynolds-Averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) model is used for near-wall treatment. The recycling/rescaling method is adopted to generate unsteady turbulent inflow conditions for the LES. Experimentally-observed flow and combustion structures are reasonably well captured and explained by the simulation. The results show that the intersection of the bow shock waves and the concentrated heat release generate a high-pressure region between the cavities, which induces great pressure gradients as well as evident flows in the transverse direction, pushing the fuel jets towards the combustor walls. Consequently, strong interactions occur between the fuel jets and the cavity aft walls, promoting the fuel transport into the cavity. Meanwhile, the cavity recirculation regions are considerably extended and distorted, and the mass exchange between the fluids {{in and out of the}} cavities may be greatly enhanced. In contrary, these flow structures support the concentrated heat release around the cavity by enhancing the fuel–air mixing and increasing the residence time of the combustible.

The work led to new insight into mechanisms governing the partitioning of major and trace metals from the combustion of sewage sludge, and mixtures of coal and sewage sludge. The research also showed that the co-combustion of coal and sewage sludge emitted fine particulate matter that might potentially cause greater lung injury than that from the combustion of either coal alone or municipal sewage sludge alone. The reason appeared to be that the toxicity measured required the presence of large amounts of both zinc and sulfur in particles that were inhaled.

The two-way coupling associated with exchanges of mass, momentum, and energy between the gas and the liquid phases is dominated by the homogenized exchanges with the gas provided collectively by the droplets, and not by the direct interaction between neighboring droplets. The formulation is used as a basis to address nonpremixed spray diffusion flames in the Burke-Schumann limit of infinitely fast chemical reactions, with the conservation equations written in terms of chemistry-free coupling functions that allow for general nonunity Lewis numbers of the fuel vapor. Laminar canonical problems that have been used in the past to shed light on different aspects of spray-combustion phenomena are also discussed, including spherical spray clouds and structures of counterflow spray flames in mixing layers. The presentation ends with a brief account of some open problems and modeling challenges...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{identify}} some of the mathematical problems encoun-tered in analyzing the ignition and ñame spread in mixing layéis, shall describe {{the structure of the}} laminar mixing layer between two parallel streams of a fu el and air, initially separated by a splitter píate, undergoing an Arrhenius reaction. If the activation energy of the reaction is lower than a critical valué, there is only one steady solution of the problein, showing a transition from nearly frozen mixing to diffusion controlled <b>combustión</b> <b>downstream</b> of the píate. For higher, typical, valúes of the activation energy we may find a multiplicity of solutions, depending on the valué of the Damkohler number D, characterized by the temperature of the hotter of the two streams. For valúes of the Damkohler number lower than a critical valué Dc, there is a solution where a thermal runaway is found to oceur, after an induction length, at a point that serves as the origin of premixed flames that do not propágate upstream. For valúes of D larger than a critical lift-ofif valué D¡(< Dc) we find a solution with diffusion controlled combustión in a diffusion fíame. This fíame is anchored, with a triple-fíame structure, in the near wake of the splitter píate, where upstream heat conduction to the píate plays a dominant role. In the interval D¡ < D < Dc there is a third, unstable, solution. This solution determines where an external ignition source shonld be placed so that, by means of upstream triple-flame propagation to the splitter píate, transition to diffusion controlled combustión can take plac...|$|R
40|$|A first {{space vehicle}} is {{attached}} {{with a second}} space vehicle which includes a rocket propulsion nozzle having a combustion chamber upstream from the nozzle throat. Apparatus 10 includes an elongate grappling arm 12 extending from the first space vehicle, a pair of inflatable bladders 16, 18 positioned about the grappling arm for engaging an inner surface of the combustion chamber upon inflation. {{and a pair of}} rear bladders 20, 22 positioned about the grappling arm for engaging an inner surface of the nozzle <b>downstream</b> from the <b>combustion</b> chamber upon inflation for aligning the grappling arm and the rocket propulsion nozzle. A pressurized fluid source 24 is provided on the first space vehicle for supplying fluid pressure to the inflatable bladders. and a fluid control valve manifold 30 selectively controls the release of pressurized fluid to the bladders. According to the method of the invention. the grappling arm is inserted into the rocket propulsion nozzle. and the control valves are actuated to first inflate the front bladders and thereby interconnect the grappling arm and the rocket propulsion nozzle. The rear bladders are subsequently inflated to align a central axis of the grappling arm with a central axis of the rocket propulsion nozzle. Inflation of the rear bladders provides an axial reaction load to balance the axial load provided by the front bladders. Attaching the vehicles in space may be controlled from the earth by activating the control valves to inflate the bladders. The cost of attaching space vehicles is significantly reduced by attaching a grappling arm on one vehicle with the existing rocket propulsion nozzle of another vehicle...|$|R
40|$|Oxy-fuel {{combustion}} {{in natural}} gas power generation is a technology of growing interest as {{it provides the}} most efficient means of carbon capture. Since all the emissions from these power plants are sequestered, there are stringent regulations on the proportions of oxidizable contents in the flue gases. This work investigates natural gas oxy-fuel combustion and represents the first iteration of carbon monoxide and oxygen emissions measurement in hot flue gases in the swirl-stabilized combustor at the MIT Reactive Gas Dynamics Laboratory. An equilibrium model using CANTERA was provided estimates for the experimental observations and {{was used to determine}} the accuracy of the measurement system. A water-quenched probe was designed and built to cool the sample gas and to allow measurements using a commercially available Lancom gas analyzer. Modifications to the existing combustion setup were made to facilitate emissions measurement at a sampling duct located <b>downstream</b> of the <b>combustion</b> chamber. Measurements for comparison between air and oxy fuel combustion were done at a constant adiabatic flame temperature. This corresponds to an equivalence ratio of 0. 6 for air, and a CO₂ mole fraction of 0. 69 for oxy-fuel combustion. Overall the measurement system provided reasonable readings for air-combustion, but measurements in oxy-fuel combustion understated the expected CO concentrations by a factor of four and overstated expected O₂ values by an order of magnitude. Air leakage into the combustion chamber is the suspected reason for these discrepancies, and recommendations are laid out for the next iteration of emissions measurement. by Andrew Sommer. Thesis (S.

40|$|Among {{the most}} {{challenging}} aspects of modern gas turbine engine design, particularly with aviation applications, is the balance between the extreme conditions necessary to achieve highly efficient combustion that minimizes emissions, and the structural and material limitations of available manufacturing techniques. Due {{to the difficulty of}} these problems, computational fluid dynamics and other model-based design tools are often utilized during the development process to better predict how an engine will perform without the high expense of repeated hardware testing. However, these models have limitations in that they often require strong assumptions to reduce the computational expense, and thereby rely on tuning based on empirical data. High-fidelity measurements are needed to not only validate these model outcomes, but also to establish correct boundary conditions. ^ In this work, we report our progress on the development and demonstration of advanced, non-intrusive laser diagnostics in conjunction with traditional instrumentation in a high pressure combustion test rig. Two dimensional flow field velocity measurements have been performed in a region <b>downstream</b> of the <b>combustion</b> zone in a premixed, swirl stabilized combustor. Point velocity measurements were acquired at a series of spatial locations using Laser Doppler Velocimetry (two components). These measurements were succeeded by a series of planer field measurements, encompassing the same spatial locations, using two dimensional Particle Image Velocimetry. The measurements were performed at two different experimental conditions, at combustor inlet temperatures 100 °F apart to examine the temperature dependency of the flow field. The following work evaluates the outcomes of these measurements and reveals that a lower combustor inlet temperature produces a central core deficit significantly less drastic than the higher temperature case. Accompanying this reduced-strength deficit are greater amount of velocity fluctuations. An analysis in the frequency domain attempts to identify the driving mechanisms behind the fluctuations. ...|$|R
