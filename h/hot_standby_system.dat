Two propositions concerning the comparative {{behavior of the}} hazard rate functions for warm, ccld, and hot standby systems are expressed and then examined. The standby systems under study involve two components with constant failure rates. Emphasis is placed on establishing a lower bound on the hazard rate function for a standby system and on developing an optimal employment policy {{for the use of}} components in a standby system. A proof is offered to show that the hazard rate function for a cold standby system is a lower bound on the hazard rate function of either a warm or <b>hot</b> <b>standby</b> <b>system.</b> Evidence is then given to support the existence of an optimal employment policy for components in a standby system, but a complete proof is not presented.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the work done}} to add <b>hot</b> <b>standby</b> replication functionality to the Apache Derby Database Management System. The Apache Derby project is a relational database implemented entirely in Java. Its key advantages are {{that it has a}} small footprint and {{it is based on the}} standard Java JDBC and SQL standards. It is also easy to install, deploy and use as well as it can be embedded in almost any light-weight Java application. By implementing a <b>hot</b> <b>standby</b> scheme in Apache Derby several features are added. The contents of the database is replicated at run time to another site providing online runtime backup. As the <b>hot</b> <b>standby</b> takes over on faults availability is added in that a client can connect to the <b>hot</b> <b>standby</b> after a crash. Thus the crash is masked from the clients. In addition to this, online upgrades of software and hardware can be done by taking down one database at the time. Then when the upgrade is completed the upgraded server is synchronized and back online with no downtime. A fully functional prototype of the Apache Derby <b>hot</b> <b>standby</b> scheme has been created in this project using logical logs, fail-fast takeovers and logical catchups after an internal up-to-crash recovery and reconnection. This project builds on the ideas that are presented in Derby: Write to Neighbor Mode. </p...|$|R

50|$|<b>Hot</b> <b>standby</b> {{may have}} a {{slightly}} different connotation of being active but not productive to hot spare, that is it is a state rather than object. For example, in a national power grid, the supply of power needs to be balanced to demand over a short term. It can take many hours to bring a coal-fired power station up to productive temperatures. To allow for load balancing, generator turbines may be kept running with the generators switched off so as peaks of demand occur, the generators can rapidly be switched on to balance the load. Being {{in the state of}} being ready to run is known as <b>hot</b> <b>standby.</b> Though it is not a modern phenomenon, steam train operators might hold a spare steam engine at a terminus fired up, as starting an engine cold would take a significant amount of time.|$|R

In high availability systems, it is common to design so that not only is there a spare that can quickly be switched in, but also that the failed component can be repaired or replaced without stopping the system - this is known as hot swapping. It may be considered that the probability of a second failure is low, and therefore the system is designed simply to allow operation to continue until a suitable maintenance period. The appropriate solution is normally determined by balancing the costs of implementing the availability against the likelihood of a problem and the severity of that problem. there are two types of <b>hot</b> standby:1. <b>hot</b> <b>standby</b> master - slave2. <b>hot</b> <b>standby</b> in shearing mode ...|$|R
