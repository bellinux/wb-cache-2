2500|$|John Fitzgerald Kennedy [...] (May 29, 1917 – November 22, 1963), was the 35th President of the United States, serving from 1961 {{until his}} {{assassination}} on November 22, 1963. Few American Presidents have quotes that are remembered long after their deaths, and Kennedy {{was among those}} few for saying to the nation, [...] "Ask not what your country can do for you; ask what you can <b>do</b> <b>for</b> <b>your</b> country." [...] He was the second-youngest President (after Theodore Roosevelt). Kennedy {{was faced with a}} number of important events during his term as President which include the Cuban Missile Crisis, the Bay of Pigs Invasion, the Space Race and the Berlin Wall crisis.|$|E
2500|$|The {{concept of}} Everest took shape in Gowariker's mind around {{two years before}} the telenovela was made. At that time he was {{confused}} between the themes of female empowerment and the fairly obscure sport of mountaineering. As he could not proceed with either of them individually, Gowariker combined the two themes into one, creating the theme of Everest. Gowariker stated that: [...] "The whole idea of the show actually began with an insight that what are you willing to <b>do</b> <b>for</b> <b>your</b> dreams?" [...] Before starting the shooting of Everest, Gowariker had to do a great deal of research. The makers referred to books such as To Everest and Beyond (by Edmund Hillary) and accounts by various other mountaineers, a few of whom they met personally. Mitali Mahajan, who co-wrote the story and the screenplay of the show, said: [...] "There are 14 peaks that have an elevation of over 8,000 meters and some enthusiastic people have climbed them all. A lot of them have live blogs about their journey through these peak. We have been following a lot of them." ...|$|E

2500|$|Others doubted whether recent {{graduates}} had {{the necessary}} skills and maturity {{for such a}} task. The idea was popular among students, however, and Kennedy pursued it, asking respected academics such as Max Millikan and Chester Bowles to help him outline the organization and its goals. During his inaugural address, Kennedy again promised to create the program: [...] "And so, my fellow Americans: ask not what your country can do for you—ask what you can <b>do</b> <b>for</b> <b>your</b> country". President Kennedy in {{a speech at the}} White House on June 22, 1962, [...] "Remarks to Student Volunteers Participating in Operation Crossroads Africa", acknowledged that Operation Crossroads for Africa was the basis {{for the development of the}} Peace Corps. [...] "This group and this effort really were the progenitors of the Peace Corps and what this organization has been doing for a number of years led to the establishment of what I consider to be the most encouraging indication of the desire for service not only in this country but all around the world that we have seen in recent years". The Peace Corps website answered the question [...] "Who Inspired the Creation of the Peace Corps?", acknowledging that the Peace Corps were based on Operation Crossroads Africa founded by Rev. James H. Robinson.|$|E
