40|$|A {{simplified}} enrichment {{method in}} which centrifugation {{is used for}} selective isolation of Sporichthya strains from soil is described. Gellan gum plus 2 mM CaCl 2 stimulated growth of Sporichthya polymorpha KCC A 0089 so that this organism was readily recognized on an isolation plate. High yields of motile spores were obtained by using a flooding solution containing 0. 1 % skim milk in 10 mM MOPS (morpholinepropanesulfonic acid) (pH 8. 0) and then incubating the preparation at 27 °C for 60 min and centrifuging it at 1, 000 × g for 10 min. Dry heat treatment at 80 °C for 60 min increased the ratio of Sporichthya colonies to nonfilamentous bacteria on a gellan <b>gum</b> <b>plate.</b> Since S. polymorpha was sensitive to 14 antibiotics, including nalidixic acid, addition of these antibiotics was not suitable for isolating Sporichthya strains. Our isolates were identified as Sporichthya strains {{on the basis of}} their morphological and chemotaxonomic characteristics. By combining the techniques described above, we isolated a number of Sporichthya strains from 21 soil samples, which were collected in Belgium, France, India, Japan, Papua New Guinea, Spain, Taiwan, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Sporichthya strains are widely distributed in the world. To our knowledge, this is the first time that Sporichthya strains have been isolated from locations other than the United States or Japan...|$|E
40|$|Forest health {{surveillance}} (FHS) of hardwood plantations commenced in Queensland in 1997 as plantations expanded following a state government planting initiative {{arising from the}} national 2020 forest policy vision. The estate was initially characterised by {{a large number of}} small plantations (10 - 50 ha), although this has changed more recently with the concentration of larger plantations in the central coast and South Burnett regions. Due to the disparate nature of the resource, drive- and walkthrough surveys of subsets of plantations have been undertaken in preference to aerial surveys. FHS has been effective in detecting a number of new hardwood pests in Queensland including erinose mites (Rhombacus and Acalox spp.), western white <b>gum</b> <b>plate</b> galler (Ophelimus sp.), Creiis psyllid and bronzing bug (Thaumastocoris sp.), in evaluating their potential impact and assisting in focussing future research efforts. Since 2003 there has been an increased emphasis on training operational staff to take a greater role in identifying and reporting on forest health issues. This has increased their awareness of forest health issues, but their limited time to specifically survey and report on pests and diseases, and high rates of staff turnover, necessitate frequent ongoing training. Consequently, common and widespread problems such as quambalaria shoot blight (Quambalaria pitereka), chrysomelid leaf beetles (mainly Paropsis atomaria) and erinose mites may be under-reported or not reported, and absence data may often not be recorded at all. Comment is made on the future directions that FHS may take in hardwood plantations in Queensland...|$|E
30|$|The sensitivities of T 3 {{transgenic}} {{plants to}} mercury were tested {{using the following}} method. The sterilized seeds from wild-type and transgenic plants were aligned in a horizontal array of MS gellan <b>gum</b> <b>plates,</b> which contained 5  μM HgCl 2 or 0.3  μM CH 3 HgCl, where they the seeds germinated and grew vertically. The root lengths of the seedlings were measured after 2  weeks’ cultivation at 22 °C.|$|R
30|$|T 3 {{transgenic}} {{plants were}} cultured in MS gellan <b>gum</b> <b>plates</b> with different concentrations of HgCl 2 or CH 3 HgCl for 2  weeks at 22 °C. After treatment with 10  μM HgCl 2 or 0.3  μM CH 3 HgCl, {{the total amount}} of mercury accumulated by an entire plant was determined as follows, using 60 plants in total. Entire plants samples were digested with a concentrated acid mixture (nitric acid: perchlonic acid[*]=[*] 4 : 1) for 4  h at 90 °C and their total cellular mercury contents were measured using an atomic absorption spectrometry analyzer HG- 310 (Hiranuma, Japan). The standard deviation of the measurements was less than 10 %.|$|R

40|$|Feasibility {{studies were}} done to {{determine}} whether a new agar substitute, Gelrite gellan gum, could be used to prepare a solid Mueller-Hinton medium for disk diffusion susceptibility tests. Mueller-Hinton broth was combined with 0. 43 % of the gellan gum and 0. 75 % KCI. The resulting medium had performance characteristics similar to those of Mueller-Hinton agars; however, zones on the gellan gum media tended to be a little larger. Significant differences among Mueller-Hinton broths and among Mueller-Hinton agars from different manufacturers were documented: zones on different lots of the gellan gum were more consistent. The Mueller-Hinton broth-gellan gum medium appears to represent a satisfactory alternative to agar media. However, because somewhat larger zones were seen on the gellan <b>gum</b> <b>plates,</b> further study will be needed to develop quality control limits and interpretive zone size standards for tests on this new medium...|$|R
40|$|A {{wild-type}} strain of Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum Marburg was transformed by DNA from strains resistant to 5 -fluorouracil. Recipient cells were grown without selection on gellan <b>gum</b> (GELRITE) <b>plates</b> with DNA. Drug-resistant cells were recovered by replica plating the resulting colonies onto drug plates. Transformation required high-molecular-weight DNA with appropriate markers {{and was not}} observed on agar or in liquid media {{under a variety of}} conditions...|$|R
40|$|An albumin {{polysorbate}} semisolid medium (Ellinghausen McCullough Johnson Harris medium) gelled with {{gellan gum}} (Gelrite; Kelco Div., Merck & Co., Inc.) compared favorably with conventional agar media for {{the cultivation of}} both pathogenic and saprophytic leptospires. The gellan gum medium supported the growth of all 18 leptospiral strains studied which included an array of serovars with various fastidious growth characteristics. Gellan gum medium was also used advantageously as a long-term maintenance medium; 9 - to 12 -month-old cultures still contained viable organisms. The colonial growth in gellan <b>gum</b> <b>plating</b> medium of six representative strains was consistent with previously described colonial growth on agar plating media. In addition, gellan gum medium {{appeared to be an}} excellent medium for the recovery of leptospires from the blood, liver, and kidneys of hamsters experimentally infected with a virulent Leptospira interrogans serovar bataviae strain. As few as 1 to 10 organisms in the infective tissue could be recovered in semisolid Ellinghausen McCullough Johnson Harris-gellan gum medium. The antigenicity {{did not appear to be}} affected by growth in gellan gum medium. The hamster-virulent strain of L. interrogans serovar bataviae isolated from a moribund hamster maintained its virulence after 10 sequential passages in gellan gum medium. Gellan gum medium can be a valuable adjunct to currently used cultural procedures...|$|R
5000|$|Originally {{isolated}} by De Luca in 1978 {{from the}} solfatane fumaroles of Campi Flegrei (Naples, Italy), C. merolae {{can be grown}} in culture in the laboratory in Modified Allen’s medium (MA) or a modified form with twice the concentration of some elements called MA2. [...] Using MA medium, growth rates are not particularly fast, with a doubling time (the time it takes a culture of microbes to double in cells per unit volume) of approximately 32 hours. [...] By using the more optimal medium MA2, this {{can be reduced to}} 24 hours. [...] Culturing is done at 42 °C under white fluorescent light with an approximate intensity of 50 µmol photons m−2 s−1 (µE). [...] However, under a higher light intensity of 90 µE with 5% CO2 applied through bubbling, the growth rate of C. merolae can be further increased, with a doubling time of approximately 9.2 hours. [...] Higher light is not necessarily beneficial, as above 90 µE the growth rate begins to decrease. This may be due to photodamage occurring to the photosynthetic apparatus. C. merolae can also be grown on gellan <b>gum</b> <b>plates</b> for purposes of colony selection or strain maintenance in the laboratory. [...] C. merolae is an obligate oxygenic phototroph, meaning it is not capable of taking up fixed carbon from its environment and must rely on oxygenic photosynthesis to fix carbon from CO2.|$|R
