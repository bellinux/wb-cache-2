5|$|A second {{attempt to}} revive the plan arose from talks between Kinkel and French foreign {{minister}} Hervé de Charette on 28 June. They proposed establishing zones of separation to enforce a ceasefire, monitoring the RSK's external borders, specific guarantees {{for the safety of}} Croatian Serbs and implementating confidence-building measures by economic cooperation between Croatia and the RSK. The initiative, however, did not gain <b>ground</b> <b>when</b> the RSK refused to negotiate.|$|E
5|$|During the Second World War, Bonass {{served in}} the Metropolitan Police's War Reserve {{and then as a}} {{wireless}} operator in the Royal Air Force. He was killed in October 1945, together {{with the rest of the}} crew and a civilian on the <b>ground,</b> <b>when</b> his Short Stirling bomber crashed on a training flight.|$|E
5|$|In Britain, {{ground fog}} again {{frustrated}} reinforcement. Thirty-five gliders of the 3rd lift carrying the Polish glider borne elements were delayed in taking {{off and the}} whole parachute brigade failed to take off at all. This would have serious consequences on the <b>ground</b> <b>when</b> the delayed gliders arrived.|$|E

5|$|The England {{national}} football team frequently {{trained at the}} <b>ground</b> <b>when</b> preparing for games in London; the agreement with Arsenal began in March 2003. They have since 2012 relocated their training base to St George's Park National Football Centre. Arsenal's training ground {{was used by the}} national team in November 2013, for the friendlies against Chile and Germany after St George's Park reported a stomach bug.|$|E
5|$|The ground {{hosted the}} Yorkshire Flower Show and Gala in June 1924, {{after the event}} had been held at Bootham Park for the {{previous}} 60 years. It annually hosted Faber Cup races for the York Harriers, which consisted of six-mile courses over grass with hurdles, {{on a number of}} occasions. An amateur international was held at the <b>ground</b> <b>when</b> England played Ireland on 14 November 1931.|$|E
5|$|The red-capped robin mostly pounces on prey on the ground, {{although}} it can swoop and catch creatures while airborne. Less often, it gleans (takes prey while perched) in low-lying vegetation, almost always less than 3m (10ft) above the ground. The prey is most commonly on the <b>ground</b> <b>when</b> caught, although airborne insects are sometimes taken. A low branch {{may be used as}} a vantage point in hunting.|$|E

5|$|After {{making a}} recovery, Kizirian and the Marine units took {{the capital city}} of NaHa and were {{preparing}} for another assault. Kizirian's unit had fought its way to the crest of a hill and dug in. Kizirian was standing watch at the company command post inside an Okinawa burial <b>ground.</b> <b>When</b> replacements joined the company, many Japanese soldiers harassed the lines by infiltrating the positions of the more inexperienced soldiers. Kizirian ordered that flares should be fired at irregular intervals to would illuminate the scene and distract the enemy. The idea proved successful and the newly arrived Marines soon had the situation under control.|$|E
5|$|After taking match {{figures of}} 6/117 and 5/140 for India A against Sri Lanka A, Kartik {{made his first}} {{overseas}} appearance for India, replacing the injured Harbhajan midway through the 2003–04 tour of Australia. He had little success in his first tour match, taking 1/64 and 1/53 against Australian A. He played in the final Test at the Sydney Cricket <b>Ground</b> <b>when</b> India fielded two spinners for {{the only time in}} the series. He was punished by the Australian batsmen, taking a total of1/211 from 45 overs, a run rate of 4.68, in a high-scoring draw.|$|E
5|$|Because {{its feet}} are located so far {{back on its}} body, the red-throated loon is quite clumsy walking on land, but it can use its feet to shove itself forward on its breast. Young use this method of {{covering}} <b>ground</b> <b>when</b> moving from their breeding pools to larger bodies of water, including rivers and the sea. It is the only species of loon able to take off directly from land. If frightened, it may submerge until only its head or bill shows above {{the surface of the}} water.|$|E
50|$|It is {{interesting}} to note that all the games of the 1921 and 1922 World Series were played in the Polo <b>Grounds,</b> <b>when</b> the Yankees squared off against their intracity rival Giants.|$|R

5|$|Glastonbury {{has been}} {{described}} as a New Age community which attracts people with New Age and Neopagan beliefs, and is notable for myths and legends often related to Glastonbury Tor, concerning Joseph of Arimathea, the Holy Grail and King Arthur. Joseph is said to have arrived in Glastonbury and stuck his staff into the <b>ground,</b> <b>when</b> it flowered miraculously into the Glastonbury Thorn. The presence of a landscape zodiac around the town has been suggested but no evidence has been discovered. The Glastonbury Festival, held in the nearby village of Pilton, takes its name from the town.|$|E
5|$|In mid-July, {{the female}} Polish {{cochineal}} lays approximately 600-700 eggs, encased {{with a white}} waxy ootheca, in the <b>ground.</b> <b>When</b> the larvae hatch in late August or early September, they do not leave the egg case but remain inside {{until the end of}} winter. In late March or early April, the larvae emerge from the ground to feed for a short time on the low-growing leaves of the host plant before returning underground to feed on the plant's roots. At this point, the larvae undergo ecdysis, shedding their exoskeletons together with their legs and antennae, and they encyst by forming outer protective coatings (cysts) within the root tissues.|$|E
5|$|Inferences about {{behavior}} {{can also be}} drawn from examination of the inner ear. The semicircular canals within the inner ear aid in balance, and the lateral semicircular canal is usually parallel to the <b>ground</b> <b>when</b> the animal holds its head in an alert posture. When the skull of Majungasaurus is rotated so that its lateral canal {{is parallel to the}} ground, the entire skull is nearly horizontal. This contrasts with many other theropods, where the head was more strongly downturned when in the alert position. The lateral canal is also significantly longer in Majungasaurus than in its more basal relative Ceratosaurus, indicating a greater sensitivity to side-to-side motions of the head.|$|E

5|$|Researchers have {{identified}} {{factors contributing to}} the relatively rapid fall of the fortress. It had not been completely renovated; its defenders were inexperienced; the crew had been frequently rotated, and {{had not been able}} to familiarize themselves with the surrounding area and with the fortress. Although most of their experience lay in the defense of the fortress' interior, they were dispatched to fight on open <b>ground.</b> <b>When</b> the combat moved outside the fortress, communication lines were disrupted by the German bombardment, and the fortress defense was unable to restore complete communication with the command center or with other forts. The absence of external support was a crucial factor in its fall.|$|E
5|$|The lower {{altitude}} {{site where}} D.regia is found is characterised by permanently damp soils consisting mostly of a gravel bench formed from a creek bed. The plants grow in a peaty quartzite sand, {{often with a}} gravel cover. Rhizomes of mature plants grow above ground and among associated grasses and sedges when gravel is absent and below <b>ground</b> <b>when</b> there is a gravel cover present. Associated vegetation included species of Leucadendron {{and members of the}} families Cyperaceae, Iridaceae, and Restionaceae. The habitat of D.regia depends on periodic fire sweeping through and keeping the larger plants from choking out D.regia. Frost occurs infrequently in the valley.|$|E
5|$|As both battalions {{headed for}} the railway line, gliders {{carrying}} the 1st Polish Parachute Brigade's vehicles and artillery arrived at landing zone 'L'. The KOSB still defending the area were holding out against repeated German attacks but the landing ground was in range of the Germans guns. At the same time 10 Para, closely followed by German armoured vehicles and under mortar fire, reached the clearing. The leading companies had just cleared the woods and started across open <b>ground</b> <b>when</b> the gliders arrived. In the confusion, with both groups under fire, each thought {{the other was the}} enemy and began shooting back. The Polish anti-tank battery was virtually destroyed and although some vehicles got away the majority of their guns were trapped in the burning gliders. Some of the pursuing German troops tried to cross the landing zone only to suffer heavy casualties {{at the hands of the}} defending KOSB companies. In the confusion, 'A' Company KOSB, covering the withdrawal of 10 Para, was cut off and eventually forced to surrender.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 1951–52 season, Barnes returned to the New South Wales team in a bid to regain his Test position, and performed well. He was chosen by the selectors but the board disallowed his selection for conduct reasons rather than ability. The media figured this out and publicised it, and Barnes was overlooked for the whole season. Speculation abounded as to the nature of his supposed misdeeds. These included jumping the turnstile at a <b>ground</b> <b>when</b> he forgot his player's pass, insulting the royal family, theft from team-mates, drunkenness, stealing a car, parking his car in someone else's space, or that Barnes had lampooned the board in the narration accompanying the home movies he made of the 1948 tour. In later years, a file of unknown authorship was found; it accused Barnes of allowing young spectators to enter the playing arena to field the ball instead of doing so himself, and of denigrating umpires by making gestures implying they were blind.|$|E
5|$|Brabourne Stadium is a cricket {{ground in}} Mumbai, India. It {{is the home}} of the Cricket Club of India and has played host to Ranji Trophy matches (including {{seventeen}} finals) and Indian Premier League matches, as well as being a Test, One Day International (ODI) and Twenty20 International (T20I) venue. It has a capacity of 20,000 spectators. The ground has hosted 18 Test matches, the first in 1948 when India played the West Indies. It has also staged eight ODI matches, the first of which was in 1989 when Australia lost to Pakistan by 66 runs. One T20I has been played at the <b>ground</b> <b>when</b> India beat Australia by seven wickets in 2007. This was also the first T20I to be played in India. Of the eight ODIs played at the stadium, five matches (including the final) were staged during the ICC Champions Trophy in 2006.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the heavy}} losses which left gaping {{holes in the}} Allied line, {{it was decided that}} the next stage of the advance was to go ahead. At 08:25, parties from the 34th and 35th Battalions headed out along the {{south-eastern}} edge of the ridge towards the outskirts of Passchendaele. Almost immediately, they came under heavy fire from a pillbox close by a railway embankment, at which time Major J.B. Buchanan, the senior brigade officer with the advance party, fell dead, leaving Jeffries to assume control. Gathering a party of eleven men, he set about silencing the machine gun position. Edging across the open ground, the party attacked the position from the west just as the machine gun was firing to the north. Realising that an attack was imminent, the machine gunner switched around, mortally wounding Jeffries in the stomach and sending the rest of the party to <b>ground.</b> <b>When</b> its fire eased, the remaining members of the group worked around the position, rushed it and seized two machine guns in conjunction with thirty prisoners.|$|E
60|$|They had {{advanced}} nearly {{as far as}} the tent, on {{their way out of the}} <b>grounds,</b> <b>when</b> they were met by a gentleman walking towards them from the cottage. He was a stranger to Isabel. Moody immediately recognized him as Mr. Felix Sweetsir.|$|R
50|$|Ufer <b>grounds,</b> <b>when</b> present, are {{preferred}} {{over the}} use of grounding rods. In some areas (like Des Moines, Iowa) Ufer grounds are required for all residential and commercial buildings.

50|$|Where a privative clause exists, {{the courts}} hold {{that they do}} not {{insulate}} a decision from being reviewed on jurisdictional <b>grounds.</b> <b>When</b> the decision maker is acting within their jurisdiction, a privative clause will prevent judicial review even if there is an error of law.|$|R
