40|$|Key words:diamond;saw blade; {{drilling}} bit;embedding strength Abstract. It is {{stated that}} Diamond saw blades requires high embedding {{strength of the}} diamond, while diamond drill bits do not. It is necessary to improve the embedding strength of diamond in diamond saw blades, {{rather than in the}} diamond drilling bits. It is recommended to count the number of diamond particles on the matrix surface and get the embedding strength of diamond by calculation. Another recommendation is to use the compound powder of cobalt and tungsten carbide for pelletizing in order to improve the embedding strength of diamond and lower the cost of matrix. There are people studying how to raise embedding strength of diamond, for both diamond saw blades and <b>diamond</b> <b>drilling</b> <b>bit.</b> However, the requirements for embedding strength of diamond saw blades and <b>diamond</b> <b>drilling</b> <b>bit</b> are different. The following parts include the analysis for this problem. Requirement of embedding strength for <b>diamond</b> <b>drilling</b> <b>bit</b> As shown in Figure 1, there are two counter forces on the surface diamond drill bit matrix. Force n is upwards, which won’t causes the diamond to fall off. The only possibility is Force t. Force t forms a very small torque, which can hardly pull the diamond down, especially in the presence of Force n. Only when the matrix has worn away heavily, the diamond might fall down...|$|E

40|$|The author {{explores the}} {{drilling}} operation of some new engineering {{materials such as}} carbon fiber reinforced plastics (CFRP) and other polymers that have an anisotropic structure, high-strength and elastic properties combined with low heat endurance. Such combination of properties makes impossible the simple transfer of the existing technologies for classic materials working to considered new class. At the same time, the existing tools cannot assure the specified quality of tooled products at the current productivity and tool life. Aim: The aim {{of this research is}} to increase the process efficiency of <b>diamond</b> <b>drilling</b> in composite polymers by developing the new designs of <b>diamond</b> <b>drill</b> <b>bits.</b> Materials and Methods: One of the most promising directions to solve this problem is the diamond coated abrasive type tool.

50|$|Christensen {{was also}} {{successful}} in business. He helped revolutionize the {{mining and petroleum}} industry and is recognized as {{the driving force behind}} the introduction of <b>diamond</b> <b>drill</b> <b>bits</b> into the petroleum exploration industry. Originally, the company manufactured <b>diamond</b> <b>drill</b> <b>bits</b> for the western mining industry, but the founders quickly envisioned a strong market in petroleum. By 1946, Christensen diamond bits were introduced into the Rangley field of Colorado. The bits were so successful the company decided to make petroleum drilling its primary market. His company, Christensen Diamond Products Company, became the world’s largest producer of industrial diamond products.http://www.bakerhughes.com/hcc/about/history.htmBy the 1960s, the company was expanding into international markets. Christensen also developed an erosion-resistant matrix for diamond bits and introduced the 250P-core barrel system that quickly became the industry standard. In the 1970s, downhole tools and motors formed the basis for a broader drilling package that included the Navi-Drill downhole motor. Later in the decade, Christensen Diamond Products introduced the synthetic polycrystalline diamond compact (PDC) bit.In 1978, Christensen Diamond Products was acquired by Norton Co. of Worcester, Mass. The company’s name was changed to Norton Christensen in 1983. Norton Christensen merged with Eastman Whipstock, the world’s largest directional drilling company, in 1986 to form Eastman Christensen. Baker International acquired Hughes Tool Company in 1987, merging to become Baker Hughes Incorporated. Baker Hughes then went on to acquire Eastman Christensen three years later in. In 1992, Baker Hughes merged the two divisions—Eastman Christensen and Hughes Tool Company—to form Hughes Christensen.|$|R

30|$|The DRMS {{cordless}} (Drilling Resistance Measurement System) by SINT Technology is {{a portable}} micro-destructive cutting technique {{that was developed}} for laboratory and in situ studies in heritage conservation (e.g. Exadaktylos et al. 2000; Singer et al. 2000; Tiano 2001; Delgado Rodrigues et al. 2002; Cnudde et al. 2008; Theodoridou and Ioannou 2015; Modestou et al. 2015). It has been proven {{that the results of}} this testing method correlate well with various laboratory measured physical and mechanical properties of weak to very strong limestones (Theodoridou et al. 2015). During the measurements, the necessary force for penetrating a certain depth in time was measured continually, while the penetration rate and rotational speed were kept constant. The outputs of the measurements were given in x-y plots of the drilling force along the depth, and the data was registered in numeric values. The operating conditions were 600 [*]rpm for the rotational speed, 10 [*]mm/min for the penetration rate and 10 [*]mm the total depth of penetration. The diameter of the <b>diamond</b> <b>drill</b> <b>bits</b> was 5 [*]mm. A total of 20 blocks of building stone (Fig.  2) was subjected to the measurement system.

40|$|Commercial {{introduction}} of Microhole Technology {{to the gas}} and oil drilling industry requires an effective downhole drive mechanism which operates efficiently at relatively high RPM and low bit weight for delivering efficient power to the special high RPM <b>drill</b> <b>bit</b> for ensuring both high penetration rate and long bit life. This project entails developing and testing a more efficient 2 - 7 / 8 in. diameter Turbodrill and a novel 4 - 1 / 8 in. diameter <b>drill</b> <b>bit</b> for <b>drilling</b> with coiled tubing. The high-power Turbodrill were developed to deliver efficient power, and the more durable <b>drill</b> <b>bit</b> employed high-temperature cutters that can more effectively drill hard and abrasive rock. This project teams Schlumberger Smith Neyrfor and Smith Bits, and NASA AMES Research Center with Technology International, Inc (TII), to deliver a downhole, hydraulically-driven power unit, matched with a custom <b>drill</b> <b>bit</b> designed to <b>drill</b> 4 - 1 / 8 in. boreholes with a purpose-built coiled tubing rig. The U. S. Department of Energy National Energy Technology Laboratory has funded Technology International Inc. Houston, Texas to develop a higher power Turbodrill and <b>drill</b> <b>bit</b> for use in drilling with a coiled tubing unit. This project entails developing and testing an effective downhole drive mechanism and a novel <b>drill</b> <b>bit</b> for <b>drilling</b> 'microholes' with coiled tubing. The new higher power Turbodrill is shorter, delivers power more efficiently, operates at relatively high revolutions per minute, and requires low weight on bit. The more durable thermally stable <b>diamond</b> <b>drill</b> <b>bit</b> employs high-temperature TSP (thermally stable) diamond cutters that can more effectively drill hard and abrasive rock. Expectations are that widespread adoption of microhole technology could spawn a wave of 'infill development' drilling of wells spaced between existing wells, which could tap potentially billions of barrels of bypassed oil at shallow depths in mature producing areas. At the same time, microhole coiled tube drilling offers the opportunity to dramatically cut producers' exploration risk to a level {{comparable to that of}} drilling development wells. Together, such efforts hold great promise for economically recovering a sizeable portion of the estimated remaining shallow (less than 5, 000 feet subsurface) oil resource in the United States. The DOE estimates this U. S. targeted shallow resource at 218 billion barrels. Furthermore, the smaller 'footprint' of the lightweight rigs utilized for microhole drilling and the accompanying reduced drilling waste disposal volumes offer the bonus of added environmental benefits. DOE analysis shows that microhole technology has the potential to cut exploratory drilling costs by at least a third and to slash development drilling costs in half...|$|R
