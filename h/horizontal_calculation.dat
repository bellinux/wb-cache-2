40|$|The {{standard}} method for measuring diffuse horizontal irradiance uses a fixed shadowband to block direct solar radiation. This method requires a correction for the excess skylight {{blocked by the}} band, and this correction varies with sky conditions.

40|$|Coastal {{areas around}} the world are {{frequently}} attacked by various types of storms, threatening human life and property. This study aims to understand storm surge processes in large-scale coastal basins, particularly focusing on the influences of geometry, topography and storm characteristics on the water levels along the coast. To this end, an idealised process-based hydrodynamic model is developed. For arbitrary closed or semi-enclosed basins, it solves the linearised three-dimensional shallow water equations, including the Coriolis effect, forced by time- and space-dependent wind and pressure fields. The model’s linearity allows us to analyse the problem in terms of the basin's frequency response (which reflects its resonance properties). The model is fast because it decouples the vertical calculations (analytical) from the <b>horizontal</b> <b>calculations.</b> First, the spectral response of a closed rectangular basin of uniform depth, subject to periodic wind forcing, is found to depend on the spatial characteristics of the wind field and the basin dimensions. Wind with different spatial patterns (uniform, divergent and curl) produce different resonance peaks which are further modified by bottom friction and the Coriolis effect. The latter introduces new peaks associated with cross-wind basin dynamics. Then, in Chapter 3, investigation shows that adding topographic elements (e. g., a topographic step, a linearly sloping bed or a parabolic cross-basin profile) in semi-enclosed basins causes the resonance frequencies to shift, through their effect on local wave speed. In Chapter 4, the model first reproduce the surge caused by Hurricane Katrina, with a schematised domain and forced by the so-called Holland-B model. Next, the storm parameters are varied around the values resembling Hurricane Katrina to study storm characteristics’ influence. The storm direction and point of landfall are found {{to be the most important}} parameters determining the surge height. In particular, a storm approaching from south-east making landfall at the Mississippi dike produces the highest surge levels. Due to its flexibility regarding geometry, topography and forcing, and the short calculation times, the new model bridges the theoretical model and complex computationally expensive numerical model, and can thus be used as a quick estimation tool for extensive sensitivity studies...|$|R

(NDACC station, 28. 3 ° N, 16. 5 ° W). The method is based on <b>horizontal</b> path <b>calculation</b> from the O 2 -O 2 collisional complex at the 477 nm absorption band which is measured simultaneously to the NO 2 column density, and is applicable under low aerosol-loading conditions. The MAXDOAS technique, applied in horizontal mode in the free troposphere, minimizes the impact of the NO 2 contamination resulting from the arrival of marine boundary layer (MBL) air masses from thermally forced upwelling breeze during middle hours of the day. Comparisons with in situ observations show that during most of the measuring period, the MAXDOAS is insensitive or very slightly sensitive to the upwelling breeze. Exceptions are found for pollution events during southern wind conditions. On these occasions, evidence of fast, efficient and irreversible transport from the surface to the free troposphere is found.

The advantage of this method is the ease of application compared to other methods that have been developed to correct for wellbore pressure drop. It also significantly improves the accuracy of the productivity estimates. The specific tasks achieved in this work include the following: The development of the productivity error correlation to correct for wellbore (frictional) pressure drop along the horizontal productive well length. A non-parametric regression program, GRACE, was used to analyse several simulated productivity data and to develop a Productivity Error (P. E.) correlation. The correlation, which was simplified using the Table Curve program, is a function of horizontal well length, viscosity, well diameter, wellbore roughness, and production rate. The validation of two commonly used productivity relationships that were derived by assuming either a constant wellbore pressure or a uniform flux. The validation was done with simulated data to support the use of these relationships with the productivity error correlation that was developed. The aim was to ensure that these relationships are valid over the range of values that were used in this study. Due to the significant effect of wellbore roughness on horizontal well productivity, an extensive literature search was also conducted for materials that will help to determine the true roughness of screen and slotted liner horizontal well completions.

40|$|The {{radio wave}} {{propagation}} prediction {{is one of the}} key elements for designing an efficient radio network system. WRAP International has developed a software for spectrum management and radio network planning. This software includes some wave propagation models which are used to predict path loss. Current propagation models in WRAP perform the calculation in a vertical 2 D plane, the plane between the transmitter and the receiver. The goal of this thesis is to investigate and implement a 3 D wave propagation model, in a way that reflections and diffractions from the sides are taken into account. The implemented 3 D wave propagation model should be both fast and accurate. A full 3 D model which uses high resolution geographical data may be accurate, but it is inefficient in terms of memory usage and computational time. Based on the fact that in urban areas the strongest path between the receiver and the transmitter exists with no joint between vertical and horizontal diffractions [10], the {{radio wave propagation}} can be divided into two parts, the vertical and <b>horizontal</b> part. <b>Calculations</b> along the <b>horizontal</b> and vertical parts are performed independently, and after that, the results are combined.

30|$|Vertical in situ {{stress is}} usually assumed to be equal to {{the weight of the}} {{overlying}} layers per unit area and can be computed by integrating the bulk density log data. The direction of maximum or minimum horizontal {{in situ stress}} can either be observed from image logs or caliper logs, or be estimated from basin-scale observation of geological events. The magnitude of minimum in situ stress can be measured by leak-off tests (LOT) or hydraulic fracturing tests (Haimson and Fairhurst 1967; Haimson 1974). Small-scale hydraulic fracturing tests are called mini-frac tests. There are many types of mini-frac tests, such as Halliburton’s Diagnostic Fracture Injection Test (DFIT) and Schlumberger’s Modular Formation Dynamics Tester (MDT). However, there is no tool for direct measurement of maximum horizontal in situ stress. The determination of maximum horizontal in situ stress magnitude is often achieved by calculation from borehole breakouts, minimum horizontal stress, and rock mechanical properties such as cohesion, friction angle, and unconfined compressive strength (UCS) (Zoback et al. 1985; Peška and Zoback 1995). There are many other studies of in situ stress determination. Ervin and Bell used breakdown pressure or leak-off pressure from formation leak-off tests to calculate the maximum horizontal stress estimation (Ervin and Bell 1987). Cornet and Valette (1984) developed a method based on normal stress measurements and fast flow rate reopening tests to calculate in situ stresses.

The method has been successfully applied to a set of North Sea data. All the available methods for maximum <b>horizontal</b> stress <b>calculation</b> are based on a circular borehole shape.

Our technique uses three observed quantities: period, relative luminosity, and Fourier phase ϕ 31 interpreting them {{in the light of}} linear and hydrodynamic pulsation models. The masses we obtain agree with those of the RRd stars in other clusters, and our derived parameters pass a number of tests which are independent of the derivation: (1) we reproduce the observed slope, ∂ϕ 31 /∂ log P, of the ϕ 31 -period diagram; (2) the values we obtain for M, T., and L locate the w Cen RRc stars in the first overtone instability strip, just where they belong; (3) our derived parameters are shown to be consistent with the fact that w Cen contains no RRd stars. However, our results not only disagree with current horizontal branch models, but also imply that the canonical slope of the log Te versus B - V relation (obtained from static model atmospheres) is too steep by a factor of 2, at least as applied to the RRc stars.

40|$|One of the {{problems}} of innovative reactor plant (RP) with supercritical water SCWR is providing its operation stability. Mechanisms that cause instability are similar to those that occur in boiling-water reactors BWR. However, they may have some specific features concerning, for example, deteriorated heat transfer conditions and appreciably greater thermodynamic liquid nonequilibrium in the flow. Therefore the tasks of development and verification of computational methods and programs that would allow to define SCWR stability boundaries are urgent. Within IAEA Coordinated Research Project (CRP) «Heat Transfer Behaviour and Thermo-hydraulics Codes Testing for SCWRs» it was proposed to take the first step and to propose thermal-hydraulic codes testing on the basis of available data or data that are developed by CRP participants. The testing was realized comparing the results of different codes and computational methods, with the purpose to reveal possible mistakes and shortcomings, and to estimate possible range of computational results. Specifications of two benchmarks were prepared: -	Benchmark Exercise No. 1 «Steady state flow in a heated pipe» (hosted by OKB «GIDROPRESS»); -	Benchmark Exercise No. 2 «Stability» (hosted by University of Pisa, Italia). A circular pipe 4. 27 m in length, inside diameter 8. 4 mm and uniform heating was considered in Benchmark Exercise No. 2. It was necessary to plot flow instability boundary of water and other liquids in the plane of dimensionless groups NSPC and NTPC that define, correspondingly, liquid underheating to pseudo critical temperature at heated channel inlet (sub-pseudocritical number) and liquid heating in the channel (trans-pseudocritical number). At the same time it was necessary to perform the analysis for various values of local coefficient of hydraulic resistance at pipe inlet, for vertical and <b>horizontal</b> flows. <b>Calculations</b> of Benchmark Exercise No. 2 for vertical water flow were performed in OKB «GIDROPRESS» by thermal-hydraulic code TEMPA-SC.

This study was carried out (i) by evaluating time responses of particular ight upsets, (ii) by evaluating local stability over an equilibrium manifold that included stall, and (iii) by bounding the set in the state space from where the vehicle can be safely own to wings-level ight. These states comprise what will be called the safely recoverable ight envelope (SRFE), which is a set containing the aircraft states from where a control strategy can safely stabilize the aircraft. By safe recovery it is implied that the tran- sient response stays between prescribed limits before converging to a steady <b>horizontal</b> ight. The <b>calculation</b> of the SRFE bounds yields the worst-case initial state corresponding to each control strategy.

40|$|Zeotropic {{mixtures}} {{have come}} into more frequent use as working fluids (refrigerants) in heat pumps and air conditioning equipment due to the phase-out of ozone-depleting substances. Substantial drop in performance for shell-side condensation in shell-and-tube condensers when replacing a pure fluid with a mixture {{has been reported in}} the literature. The aim with this work is to contribute {{to the understanding of the}} possible reasons and their relative importance for this performance drop. Factors investigated are mass transfer resistance and flow patterns, both in the gas phase and in the condensate phase. Three different calculation tools have been used in the investigations. Two are self-developed calculation programs. Both solve the transport equations in the vapour accurately, while one uses a simple assumption for the condensate phase, and the other solves the transport equations in the condensate accurately also. The third calculation tool is commercial CFD software. The first calculation tool has been used to simulate full-scale condensers. When comparing with experimental data, it turned out that the vapour-phase mass transfer resistance closest to the interface is not influential enough to explain the drop in performance. An additional assumption of imperfect condensate mixing is, however, influential enough to account for the drop in heat flux of sometimes up to more than 70 %. The second calculation tool simulates a column with ten <b>horizontal</b> tubes. <b>Calculation</b> results show that mixing in the condensate by diffusion only is consistent with the performance drops observed. The resulting trends are similar to those obtained when simulating the full-scale condensers with the first calculation tool. The CFD software has been used in two different investigations. The first concerns the condensate flow in micro-scale on and between the tubes. The investigation was discontinued due to convergence problems. The other investigation concerns the vapour flow in the condenser. Flow field calculations have been carried out for a pure fluid and a binary mixture, and preliminary results show a significant difference in flow behaviour. However, with the calculated vapour flow field, the mixing of the condensate is less important, but the flow field of a mixture is important for the total heat flux. An adjustment to the inlet design resulted in an up to 24 % higher heat flux. The resulting drop in performance for a mixture compared to a pure fluid is, however, not significant enough to account for the recorded performance drop. This leads to the overall conclusion that mass transfer resistance in the condensate is the most important factor to consider, but that gas-phase mass transfer resistance and flow patterns also need to be considered for mixtures...|$|R

The theory modelling the rolling stock wheel pair impact on the stability of the wheel pairs motion in contact with the track has been further developed. Experimental study of the locomotive wheel pairs rolling surface has been carried out. Analyzing the experimental studies we have found out that the wheel pairs with reinforced surface, have a greater resistance to wear and tear but just to a certain extent, and then the rolling surface geometric dimensions wear and tear rate increases sharply.

Thus, to know the critical speed which must be higher for any wear of the rolling speed of locomotive wheel pairs is very important as it ensures the decrease of the track side effects.

When normalized by the surface drag in the absence of shear, a quantity that is calculated routinely in existing drag parametrizations, the momentum flux becomes independent of the detailed shape of the orography. Unlike linear theory in the Ri → ∞ limit, the present calculations account for shear-induced amplification or reduction of the surface drag, and partial absorption of the wave momentum flux at critical levels. Profiles of the normalized momentum fluxes obtained using this model and a linear numerical model without the WKB approximation are evaluated and compared for two idealized wind profiles with directional shear, for different Richardson numbers (Ri). Agreement is found to be excellent for the first wind profile (where one of the wind components varies linearly) down to Ri = 0. 5, while not so satisfactory, but still showing a large improvement relative to the Ri → ∞ limit, for the second wind profile (where the wind turns with height at a constant rate keeping a constant magnitude). These results are complementary, in the Ri > O(1) parameter range, to Broad’s generalization of the Eliassen–Palm theorem to 3 D flow. They should contribute to improve drag parametrizations used in global weather and climate prediction models...|$|R
40|$|Ship {{transportation}} is increasing globally as is {{risk of collision}} especially in congested areas is a main concern. Numerical modeling method is major simulation method to predict ship maneuverability. Ship maneuvering in calm water is an important topic to avoid collisions and leads to safe navigation. Therefore reliable ship maneuvering simulations are required for incident analysis and prevention. In recent time within the research community orientated towards ship hydrodynamics an increasing {{attention has been paid}} to simultaneous solution of the maneuvering of planing ship problem. The maneuverability of planing crafts has been the subject of many research projects during the last few decades. To assess the maneuverability of planing crafts at the early design stage, reliable simulation models are required. Traditionally, these tools have used empiric descriptions of the forces and moments on the planing craft’s hull. Ship maneuvering <b>calculations,</b> <b>horizontal</b> plane motion control and development of maneuvering simulators need a mathematical description of ship maneuvering. In the recent years, different mathematical models are suggested for maneuvering of displacement vessels that are capable of estimation of vessel maneuvers with acceptable precision. But simulation of planing craft maneuverability through mathematical model is not common yet and is the subject of future research. Maneuvering of planing crafts is influenced greatly by action of rudder. But research efforts have been to include the rudder action in the mathematical models of planing ship maneuvering. In this paper a mathematical model is developed for planing craft maneuvering that includes the rudder forces and moments. Different maneuvers are executed through the mathematical model. Simulations are validated by model tests. Finally the influence of rudder angle on maneuverability of planing ship is studied. The mathematical model and hydrodynamic coefficients presented in this paper can be applied for estimation of course control and turning ability of a planing craft in the early stages of design...|$|R
40|$|The book {{fits into}} a {{multidisciplinary}} research approach. The articles {{are the result}} of research conducted by eminent international economists, authors representing academic centres in different countries. The articles address current phenomena observed in the global economy. The authors do not aspire to comprehensively explain all the very complex and multi-dimensional economic developments, but illustrate many of these phenomena in an original way. The multi-threaded and multi-dimensional nature of the discussion in particular articles deserves attention. These include theoretical and methodological articles as well as the results of empirical research presented by the authors. The book is addressed to those persons interested in issues of economics, finance, regional economy, and the management sciences. It can be valuable for economic practitioners, members of management and supervisory boards of companies, and financial analysts, and the articles may also be useful for academicians and students. In this article the application of the taxonomic measure of investment attractiveness (TMAI) has been presented. It is the element of multidimensional comparative analysis. An empirical study based on the data from the Warsaw Stock Exchange has been conducted. The time scope embraces years 2009 – 2014 in which different types of market trends occurred. There was a bullish, bearish as well as the <b>horizontal</b> trend. <b>Calculations</b> have been carried out of almost 80 public shares from sWIG 80. TMAI value has been computed for each stock on the grounds of financial analysis. It is the synthetic measure which has been estimated {{on the basis of a}} dozen financial ratios e. g. asset management, liquidity, profitability, debt management as well as market value ratios. Both have been counted in the research and downloaded from stock market services. All of the ratios have been classified as nominants, stimulants or destimulants. Furthermore, the standardization of variables has been carried out. In the article the “not weighted” type of TMAI has been utilized which means that variables are of the same importance in terms of their final impact on the TMAI’s value. Shares with the lowest values of TMAI have been selected to short-sell portfolio according to the assumption that such stocks are potentially the worst investment assets. The aim of the research is to verify the usefulness of the TMAI method for creating short-sell portfolios. The hypothesis states that the portfolio built on the grounds of stocks with the relatively low TMAI value got comparatively lower rates of return than other portfolios and the market benchmark. The verification of the hypothesis has been done in terms of the rate of return achieved. Such an approach enables an investor to sort financial assets from the best to the worst investments. It occurs that in a period given, the performance of companies with relatively low TMAI was much worse than other firms. The rates of return of such shares were especially low 3 years after they had been purchased...|$|R
40|$|The Brazil Current System {{is formed}} by two western {{boundary}} currents that flow along the Southeast Brazil continental margin from surface to 1800 m deep. These two currents are the southward-flowing Brazil Current (BC) and the northward-flowing Intermediate Western Boundary Current (IWBC). The {{investigation of the}} dynamics of the baroclinic vorticity waves superimposed to the BC System is conducted solely from hydrographic data analysis from two oceanographic mesoscale surveys from the COROAS Project, as part of the World Ocean Circulation Experiment. These two cruises sampled the central portion of the São Paulo Bight (23. 5 o 27 o S) in the summer and winter of 1993. To apply the classical dynamical method to calculate the geostrophic velocities, a quantitative estimate of the reference level is conducted through the comparison of two different and independent methodologies. The first uses the previous knowledge that the BC transports Tropical Water (TW) and South Atlantic Central Water (SACW), and IWBC transports mainly Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW). This method, referred here as the Thermodynamical Criterion, applies the Shtokman theorems to estimate the interface depth between SACW and AAIW. The second methodology, designated here as the Dynamical Criterion, consists of modeling absolute baroclinic velocities for all 14 hydrographic transects using the sectional version of the Princeton Ocean Model (POM). The results of those two methods differ only by 7 dbar and reference level 480 dbar is adopted to represent the average interface isobaric level between BC and IWBC, in the geostrophic <b>calculations.</b> <b>Horizontal</b> distributions of geostrophic stream function are generated using objective mapping. These distributions present unequivocal evidences of cyclonic and anticyclonic structures in both summer and winter 1993 cruises. These features are associated to meanders of the BC System. They are depicted in opposing sides of the current core. The cyclone is seen in the BC coastal side as the anticyclone is placed in its oceanic side. The single vertical inversion of these horizontal flows confirms that these vortex-like features are part of a first baroclinic mode wave, which corroborates previous speculations found in the literature [...] Pages: 1265 - 126...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1977 The Geochemical Ocean Sections Study (GEOSECS) {{program has}} carried out an {{intensive}} study {{of physical and}} chemical parameters in the Pacific and Atlantic Ocean. As a result, an enormous collection of high quality data has been amassed for these two oceans. To analyze the Pacific data, fourteen stations extending from about 50 °N to 69 °S near 180 °longitude have been selected for this study. The section chosen provides a good continuous north-south section in the Pacific from near the Bering Sea to the Antarctic. To study this massive extent of the oceanic regime, three methods were adopted. The first was to estimate, using Defant's method, the approximate level of no motion throughout the section. Secondly, vertical section plots were contoured for various physical and chemical parameters to help identify and trace oceanographic features throughout the Pacific. Finally, calculations for stability were applied to each station in the section to evaluate the correlation between features of stability and those seen in the section plots. The depth {{of the level of}} no motion showed strong variability in the Pacific Ocean, Generally, deeper levels were found in the higher latitudes with shallowing towards the Equator. In the high southern latitudes, no level of least motion could be identified. This is consonant with the condition that the establishment of a level of no motion involves noticeable stratification of the water column. In high latitudes, the more nearly uniform distribution of density throughout the water column inhibits the formation of layers of high stability and stratified condition. It is also noted that a good general agreement is found between the depths of the layer of no motion and the observed oxygen minimum in the GEOSECS section. This is especially apparent in midlatitudes where the transition layer between the North and South Intermediate Waters and the Pacific Deep Waters is the region of the oxygen minimum. In the layer of the oxygen minimum, biochemical depletion occurs and there is likely to be minimal replenishment by horizontal and vertical advection and diffusion. Therefore, it is suggested that the oxygen minimum layer is closely related to a region of minimal <b>horizontal</b> movement. The <b>calculation</b> of the level of no motion in the Pacific GEOSECS sections supports this hypothesis. The large scale circulation in the Pacific Ocean is clearly pictured by the parameter section plots obtained from the Pacific GEOSECS expedition. The North Pacific and Antarctic Intermediate Waters are clearly defined from their origins to disappearance by low salinity and high nutrient levels. The extent of the Pacific Deep Water throughout the Pacific is seen. This large mass of relatively homogenous water {{can be seen from the}} South to the North Pacific. As the water moves northward, a gradual increase in nutrients and decrease in oxygen occurs. A third water type seen in the South Pacific is Antarctic Bottom Water. It intrusion into the South Pacific can be defined in terms of the 27. 86 sigma theta surface or by such parameters as oxygen, silicate, and apparent oxygen utilization (AOU). In an attempt to correlate the various features seen in the vertical sections, stability profiles were prepared for each station. The vertical stability profiles did not show any strong features other than shallow and intermediate stability maxima. Recent discussion concerning a "benthic front" associated with the Antarctic Bottom Water intrusion into the South Pacific Ocean is not supported by any stability feature. Gradients in certain physical and chemical parameters do occur but the density gradients maximum expected in a frontal zone is not seen...|$|R
40|$|Intermolecular {{interaction}} {{is a principal}} subject of chemistry for understanding the nature of substances and chemical reactions. For example, hydrogen-bonding interactions in such as O-H･･･O, N-H･･･O and N-H･･･N pairs are very important as well as hydrophobic interaction in structural biology. In recent years, other types of intermolecular interactions are recognized to play important roles in biological macromolecules. It is found that not only the typical hydrogen bonds that involve electronegative nitrogen and oxygen atoms but also the C-H･･･O hydrogen bond {{must be considered in}} the determination of protein structures. In addition to the C-H･･･O hydrogen bond, intermolecular interaction between a positively charged ion and an electron rich organic molecule (cation-π interaction) is frequently seen on the protein surfaces which is exposed to aqueous solvation effecting on the protein structures. Charge transfer is an essential factor in an accurate description of the cation-π interaction. These studies suggest that quantitative understanding of the charge transfer interactions between fundamental molecules of biological importance is indispensable particularly for the study of protein structures and functions. Carboxyl group is a common functional group in living bodies. It is contained in numbers of biologically important molecules; therefore a deep understanding of many biological phenomena should be based on the knowledge on the intermolecular interaction of carboxylic groups with each other or with other molecules. It is known that molecules with carboxylic groups show specific hydrogen-bonding interactions with each other or with other hydrogen-donating or -accepting molecules. Intermolecular interaction of acetic acid has long been studied as a prototype system of carboxylic compounds. Because acetic acid has four hydrogen-donor sites (a hydroxyl hydrogen and three methyl hydrogens) and two acceptor sites (a hydroxyl oxygen and a carbonyl oxygen) in a molecule, various kinds of hydrogen-bondings can be expected in various situations. In addition to the hydrogen bond formation, non-bonding orbitals of acetic acid can interact with virtual orbitals of positive charged ions as electron-donors. In order {{to understand the nature of}} intermolecular interaction of carboxyl group, the present study is devoted to investigating the structures of liquid acetic acid, acetic acid aqueous solutions, and acetic acid-benzene cation complexes. In chapter II, liquid structure of acetic acid is studied experimentally and theoretically. Experimentally, Raman spectra of acetic acid at various temperatures between 287 and 348 K are measured in the region of 15 - 3700 cm- 1. Theoretically, ab initio molecular orbital calculations are performed on the Raman activities of seven cluster species of acetic acid molecules. The Raman spectrum (in R(-v) representation) of crystalline acetic acid at 287 K shows six distinct bands in the 15 - 300 cm- 1 region. These bands broaden on the melting of the crystal, while their peak positions remain almost unchanged on the melting. These spectral changes are reproduced in the case that the liquid spectrum mainly arises from a variety of sizes of chain clusters as the fragments of the crystalline networks. The C=O stretching band becomes broadened toward higher wavenumbers and exhibits an asymmetric shape with increasing temperature. The wavenumbers calculated for the C=O stretching vibrations suggest that the strongly hydrogen-bonded C=O groups of the chain clusters show the prominent C=O band and its asymmetric shape is due to the presence of weakly hydrogen-bonded C=O groups of the same cluster species. The spectral analyses in both the low-wavenumber and the C=O stretching regions suggest that liquid acetic acid is mainly composed of the chain clusters, not the cyclic dimer. Assignments of the low-frequency Raman bands observed in the vapor and crystalline states are discussed on the basis of the calculated wavenumbers. In chapter III, liquid structures of acetic acid aqueous solutions are studied using Raman spectroscopy and ab initio molecular orbital calculation. With the addition of water into liquid acetic acid, the C=O stretching vibration band of acetic acid shows high frequency shift from 1665 cm- 1 to 1715 cm- 1. This means that the hydrogen-bond of the C=O group of acetic acid is not so strong as those seen in liquid acetic acid or in CCl 4 solution (in which the band appears at 1668 cm- 1). A bent type hydrogen-bond is accountable for this observation. On the other hand, the increase of acetic acid in water drastically decreases the intensity of the hydrogen-bonded O-H stretching Raman band of water at 3200 cm- 1. This suggests that acetic acid breaks the hydrogen-bond networks of water. Low frequency R(-v) spectra of acetic acid/water binary solutions are reexamined with new experimental data and ab initio molecular orbital analysis of intermolecular vibrational modes. The R(-v) spectrum of the aqueous mixture at xA = 0. 5 bears a very close resemblance to that of the acetic acid/methanol mixture with xA = 0. 5, indicating that the molecular complexes responsible to the Raman spectra are acetic acid clusters. The calculated low-frequency Raman feature of a side-on type dimer with bent-type hydrogen-bonds based on ab initio molecular orbital theory reproduces the observed Raman pattern nicely. Any evidence of the formation of stable acid-water pairs is not found in the low frequency Raman spectra. Furthermore, an isosbestic point is seen in the region of 0. 1 〓xA (mole fraction of acetic acid) 〓 0. 5, and another one is also observed in 0. 5 〓 xA〓 1. 0. The observed spectra in the region of 0 < xA < 0. 5 are reproduced simply by linear combinations of the pure water spectrum and the spectrum at xA = 0. 5. These results strongly suggest the presence of the two microphases with homogeneously associated molecules: a water cluster phase and an acetic acid cluster phase. The spectral change in 0. 5 < xA < 1. 0 is attributed to the coexistence of the acetic acid cluster phase in aqueous environment and the acid associated phase characteristic of liquid acetic acid. The author demonstrates geometrical and electronic structures of acetic acid-benzene cation complex, (CH 3 COOH) ･(C 6 H 6) +, experimentally and theoretically in chapter IV. Experimentally, a vibrational spectrum of (CH 3 COOH) ・(C 6 H 6) + in the supersonic jet is measured in the 3000 - 3680 cm- 1 region using an ion-trap photodissociation spectrometer. An electronic spectrum is also observed with this spectrometer in the 12000 - 29600 cm- 1 region. Theoretically, ab initio molecular orbital calculations are performed for geometry optimization and evaluation of vibrational frequencies and electronic transition energies. The vibrational spectrum shows two distinct bands in the O-H stretching vibrational region. The frequency of the strong band (3577 cm- 1) is close to that of the O-H stretching vibration of acetic acid (3583 cm- 1) and the weak one is located at 3617 cm- 1. On the basis of geometry optimizations and frequency calculations, the strong band is assigned to the O-H stretching vibration of the cis-isomer of acetic acid in the hydrogen-bonded complex (horizontal cis-isomer). The weak one is assigned to the vertical trans-isomer where the trans-isomer of acetic acid interacts with the π-electron system of the benzene cation. The weakness of the high frequency band in the photodissociation spectrum is attributed to the binding energy larger than the photon energy injected. Only hot vertical trans-isomers can be dissociated by the IR excitation. The electronic spectrum exhibits two bands with intensity maxima at 17500 cm- 1 and 24500 cm- 1. The calculations of electronic excitation energies and oscillator strengths suggest that charge transfer bands of the vertical trans-isomer can be observed in this region in addition to a local excitation band of the horizontal cis-isomer. The 17500 cm- 1 band is attributed to the charge transfer transition of the vertical trans-isomer and the 24500 cm- 1 band is assigned to the π-π transition of the <b>horizontal</b> cis-isomer. The <b>calculations</b> also suggest that the charge transfer is induced through the intermolecular C･･･O=C bond formed between a carbon atom of benzene and the carbonyl oxygen atom of acetic acid. In chapter V, geometrical structures of acetic acid monomer-benzene dimer cation cluster, (CH 3 COOH) ・(C 6 H 6) 2 +, and acetic acid dimer-benzene dimer cation cluster, (CH 3 COOH) 2 ・(C 6 H 6) 2 +, are investigated. A vibrational spectrum of (CH 3 COOH) ・(C 6 H 6) 2 + in the supersonic jet is measured in the 2800 - 3700 cm- 1 region using the ion-trap photodissociation spectrometer. An electronic spectrum of this cluster cation is also observed with this spectrometer and a time-of-flight type spectrometer in the 6000 - 24500 cm- 1 region. For (CH 3 COOH) 2 ・(C 6 H 6) 2 +, vibrational and electronic spectra are observed in the regions of 2740 - 3700 cm-l and 6000 - 27000 cm- 1, respectively. In order to clarify the assignment of vibrational bands, vibrational spectra of the deuterated cluster cations, (CD 3 COOD) ･(C 6 H 6) 2 + and (CD 3 COOD) 2 ･(C 6 H 6) 2 +, are measured. The electronic spectrum of (CH 3 COOH) ・(C 6 H 6) 2 + show a broad and strong band in the near-IR region and another band at 22750 cm- 1. This spectral feature resembles that of benzene dimer cation, (C 6 H 6) 2 + which has a strong charge resonance (CR) band in the near-IR region and a local excitation (LE) band with an absorption cross section one order smaller than the CR band. This fact suggests that the ion core of (CH 3 COOH) ・(C 6 H 6) 2 + is (C 6 H 6) 2 +. In the vibrational spectrum of (CH 3 COOH) ・(C 6 H 6) 2 +, a strong band is located at 3084 cm- 1 and two weak bands are observed at 3585 and 3627 cm- 1. From comparison between the vibrational spectra of (CH 3 COOH) ・(C 6 H 6) 2 + and (CD 3 COOD) ・(C 6 H 6) 2 +, the strong band is assigned to the C-H stretching vibration of (C 6 H 6) 2 +. As mentioned above, the frequency of the free O-H stretching vibration of acetic acid monomer in the gas phase is 3583 cm- 1. Thus, the band at 3585 cm- 1 is assigned to the free O-H stretching vibration of the cis-isomer of acetic acid in (CH 3 COOH) ・(C 6 H 6) 2 +. The band at 3627 cm- 1 is attributed to the O-H stretching vibration of the trans-isomer of acetic acid, because its frequency is predicted to be 51 cm- 1 (without scaling) higher than that of the cis-isomer at the CASSCF(4, 3) / 6 - 31 G(d,p) level. In the electronic spectrum of (CH 3 COOH) 2 ・(C 6 H 6) 2 +, CR and LE bands are also observed. Therefore, the ion core of (CH 3 COOH) 2 ・(C 6 H 6) 2 + is (C 6 H 6) 2 +. The vibrational spectrum of (CH 3 COOH) 2 ・(C 6 H 6) 2 + show very broad band from 3400 cm- 1 to 2740 cm- 1 with several peaks and no band is observed in the free O-H stretching vibrational region. On the basis of the vibrational spectrum of (CD 3 COOD) 2 ・(C 6 H 6) 2 + measured in the present study and the reported IR spectrum of the cyclic dimer of acetic acid in argon matrix, the vibrational spectrum of (CH 3 COOH) 2 ・(C 6 H 6) 2 + is regarded as a superposition of those of (C 6 H 6) 2 + and the acetic acid cyclic dimer. This indicates that (C 6 H 6) 2 + weakly interacts with the cyclic dimer of acetic acid in (CH 3 COOH) 2 ・(C 6 H 6) 2 +...|$|R
