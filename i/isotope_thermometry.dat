In this study, we highlight the controls on formation of joints and reverse, strike-slip and normal faults developed in the crest domain of the Puig-reig anticline {{as well as the}} relationships between fluids and these fractures. We integrated structural, petrographic and geochemical studies, using {{for the first time in}} the SE Pyrenees the clumped <b>isotopes</b> <b>thermometry</b> to obtain reliable temperatures of calcite precipitation. Structural and microstructural analysis demonstrate that at outcrop scale fracturing was controlled by rigidity contrasts between layers, diagenesis and structural position within the anticline, whereas grain size, cementation and porosity controlled deformation at the microscopic scale. Petrographic and geochemical studies of calcite precipitated in host rock porosity and fault planes reveal the presence of two migrating fluids, which represents two different stages of evolution of the Puig-reig anticline. During the layer-parallel shortening, hydrothermal fluids with temperatures between 92 and 130. °C circulated through the main thrusts to the permeable host rocks, reverse and most of strike-slip faults precipitating as cement Cc 1. During the fold growth, meteoric waters circulated downwards through normal and some strike-slip faults and mixed at depth with the previous hydrothermal fluid, precipitating as cement Cc 2 at temperatures between 77 and 93. °C. Integration of the results from the Puig-reig anticline in this work and the El Guix anticline indicates that hydrothermal fluids did not reach the El Guix anticline, in which only meteoric and evolved meteoric waters circulated along the fold. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Veins are {{ubiquitous}} {{features in}} deformed rocks. Despite observations on syntectonic veins spanning two centuries, fundamental questions remain unanswered. Their origin as fractures is largely established {{but it is}} still not known why these fractures initiate where they do and how the vein evolves once started. We studied veins from the Lower Ordovician Mazarn Formation in the Arkansas? Ouachitas combining textural observations, stable isotopes, fluid inclusions, SEM-based cathodoluminescence and electron back-scattered diffraction to understand the initial stage of vein formation, its later evolution, the role of fluids and their environment of formation. The veins are located at boudin necks and are synchronous with cleavage formation. Texturally, veins are characterized by veinlets (thin veins between 5 and 25 ?m thick) that parallel the vein-host interface and fibers (columns of quartz or calcite) perpendicular to the vein-host interface between 30 and 350 ?m wide. Veinlets are localized fractures filled with quartz. The crystallographic orientation of the precipitated material in veinlets is inherited from host grains at the micron scale and replicated as fibers? lengths grow to centimeters. The vein-forming fluid was cyclically supersaturated yet never very far from saturation. ? 18 O values of vein quartz and host are within 2 ? of each other suggesting that the fluid was rock-buffered. Nevertheless, ? 18 O and ? 13 C define a ?J? shaped trend. Although {{it is not possible to}} date any portion of this curve, the simplest explanation is that the fluid evolved from rock-buffered in a closed system to fluid-dominated in an open system.

Metamorphic temperatures were estimated al approximately 300 -degrees-C from stable <b>isotopes</b> (quartz-calcite <b>thermometry),</b> occurrence of chloritoid, and `'epizonal'' illite crystallinity index. K-white micas consist of variable mixtures of 2 M, phengite and muscovite, as revealed by detailed X-ray diffraction analyses using peak decomposition of the (060, 331) spectra. K-Ar apparent ages display a strong grain-size dependence in which mainly fine-grained size fractions (< 2 mum) record Alpine ages (37 - 15 Ma). However, these ages provide a relative rather than an absolute chronology of the diachronous Alpine metamorphic evolution of the Helvetic nappes. The resetting of the K-Ar isotopic system of K-white micas to Alpine metamorphic conditions reflects an apparent combination of crystallization/recrystallization and radiogenic Ar- 40 diffusion loss. The oxygen isotope compositions of micas (+ 15 to + 22 parts per thousand) are intermediate between detrital and O- 18 -enriched values expected for micas neoformed within an abundant marine carbonate matrix. No isotopic equilibrium has been reached between calcite and micas. The variable depletion of hydrogen isotope compositions (- 126 to - 82 parts per thousand) is influenced by the interaction with organic matter under closed-system conditions. Organic matter, if not removed, may also represent a serious source of error in K-Ar age determination, by introducing radiogenic Ar- 40 contamination. Sr- 87 /Sr- 86 isotope ratios of micas range from 0. 70879 to 0. 70902 with one outlier at 0. 71794.

40|$|Understanding past {{changes in}} sea surface {{temperatures}} (SSTs) is crucial; however, existing proxies for reconstructing past SSTs are hindered by unknown ancient seawater composition (foraminiferal Mg/Ca and d 18 O), or reflect subsurface temperatures (TEX 86) {{or have a}} limited applicable temperature range (Uk' 37). We examine clumped <b>isotope</b> (D 47) <b>thermometry</b> to fossil coccolith-rich material as an SST proxy, as clumped isotopes are independent of original seawater composition and applicable to a wide temperature range and coccolithophores are widespread and dissolution resistant. The D 47 -derived temperatures from 63 µm fraction removes most non-mixed layer components; however, the D 47 -derived temperatures display an unexpected slight decreasing trend with decreasing size fraction. This unexpected trend could partly arise because larger coccoliths (5 - 12 µm) are removed during the size fraction separation process. The c 1 and < 63 µm c 2 D 47 -derived temperatures are comparable to concurrent Uk' 37 SSTs. The < 20, < 10 and 2 - 5 µm c 2 D 47 -derived temperatures are consistently cooler than expected. The D 47 -Uk' 37 temperature offset is probably caused by abiotic/diagenetic calcite present in the c 2 2 - 5 µm fraction (~ 53 % by area), which potentially precipitated at bottom water temperatures of ~ 6 {degree sign}C.

40|$|Exchange {{of stable}} {{isotopes}} between coexisting minerals is recognized widely {{as an important}} factor in the interpretation of stable isotope geochemistry of plutonic and high-grade metamorphic rocks. Where retrogression has occurred without major recrystallization events, the rate limiting step for stable isotope exchange will be diffusion. The mathematics of diffusion are well known for many problems, but no analytical solution, including that for closure temperature, adequately describes the complex and highly variable controls of rate and mass balance that will dominate many diffusion processes in rocks. We have implemented a model describing diffusional exchange for rocks in which grain boundary diffusion is sufficiently rapid that a representative volume of rock (typically millimeter to centimeter) is able to have mutual equilibration of all grain boundaries for the time scale of cooling. This Fast Grain Boundary model explicitly links intracrystalline diffusion rates and abundances of all minerals in a rock, and allows study of the impact of rock type on stable <b>isotope</b> <b>thermometry,</b> retrogression, and zonation.

40|$|To {{understand}} the fluid temperature and pressure during the Ouachita orogeny, we used isotopic analysis of syntectonic veins and adjacent host material, quartz-calcite oxygen <b>isotope</b> <b>thermometry</b> and fluid inclusion analysis. The veins were {{at or near}} isotopic equilibrium with their host rocks; neither the host nor veins has been isotopically reset. The average isotopic variation in (delta 18) O between vein and host is 2. 4 plus/minus 1. 7 % and 0. 7 plus/minus 1. 7 % for quartz and calcite, respectively. The temperature of vein formation from quartz-calcite oxygen <b>isotope</b> <b>thermometry</b> is about 210 - 430 degrees C. Although this is a large range, the temperature does not vary systematically in the exposed Ordovician through Mississippian rocks. The lack of isotopic difference between host and vein suggests that the host oxygen determined that of the veins. This in turn suggests that the fluid in the rocks did not change regionally. The vitrinite reflectance/temperature of the host rocks increases with restored stratigraphic depth more than that calculated with the quartz-calcite thermometer in veins. Fluid inclusion analysis in vein quartz constrains homogenization temperatures to be from 106 - 285 degrees C. Isochores from fluid inclusion analyses were constrained using quartz-calcite thermometry and vitrinite reflectance temperatures to calculate vein formation pressures of 0. 3 ? 4. 7 kbars. These pressures correspond to vein formation depths up to 19 km, assuming an unduplicated stratigraphic section.

40|$|Interdiffusion between coexisting {{minerals}} affects all {{rocks and}} causes resetting and discordance of stable isotope geothermometers that is commonly observed in slowly cooled igneous and metamorphic rocks. The Fast Grain Boundary (FGB) model describes the stable isotope fractionations and intracrystalline zonation which result from closed system interdiffusion (Eiler et al., 1991, 1992). This model assumes that grain boundary diffusion is {{much faster than}} volume diffusion, and it accounts for exchange among all minerals in a rock. Previous models of closure temperature violate mass balance restrictions and will be inaccurate in most rocks. Modeling results are described for amphibolites and hornblende granites and gneisses; biotite granites, schists, and gneisses; pelitic and semi-pelitic rocks; garnet peridotites; anorthosites, gabbros, pyroxenites, and related rocks; and calc-silicate rocks. Examples of mineral pairs and specific rock types that allow accurate stable <b>isotope</b> <b>thermometry</b> include plagioclase-pyroxene in pyroxene bearing anorthosites and garnet-quartz in garnetiferous quartzites. In contrast, the same mineral pairs in related rocks such as pyroxenites and pelitic schists will exhibit reset apparent temperatures. Closed-system processes are capable of producing a variety of patterns of stable isotope resetting, discordance, mineral zonation, and fractionation reversals. Examples include large reversals of quartz-feldspar fractionations in micaceous rocks, and oscillatory zonation in feldspar from some quartz-rich rocks. These results permit reinterpretation of many studies of stable <b>isotope</b> <b>thermometry,</b> speedometry, and retrograde alteration history. FGB modeling of mineral zonation provides an important new guide to applying recently developed micro-analytical tools to slowly cooled rocks. Application of the FGB model to quartzo-feldspathic gneisses from the Adirondack Mountains, New York, demonstrates the usefulness of diffusion modeling in discriminating closed-system, diffusion controlled retrogression from open-system retrogression, and illustrates the possible importance of incorporating the effect of water activity on mineral diffusivity...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{focuses on}} how mineralogical differences affect original clumped isotope (Δ 47) values {{and how they}} are changed through diagenesis. A primary motivation for this work was to understand the geologic conditions under which the clumped isotope thermometer can be applied with confidence to paleoclimatic problems. To place empirical constraints on the conditions under which Δ 47 alteration can occur, samples from a ~ 4500 m long drill core from Andros Island, Bahamas were analyzed. These limestones and dolomites formed under near-surface temperature conditions, but for samples below ~ 1. 3 km in depth, calculated Δ 47 temperatures increase by ~ 10 ° C. This indicates a shift from preserved near-surface temperatures to diagenetically modified values. Importantly, this shift is not accompanied by changes in common diagenetic indicators, and thus raises the possibility of solid-state clumped isotope alteration occurring at much lower temperatures than previously thought. Similar Δ 47 temperatures recorded by each carbonate phase suggest that fine-grained dolomites and calcites are equally viable materials for recording surface temperature conditions, but both are also equally susceptible to alteration of their primary clumped isotope abundances when buried. A challenge remaining in clumped <b>isotope</b> <b>thermometry</b> was the lack of an empirical calibration for dolomite, which had been theoretically predicted to differ from established calibrations. Here, analysis of a set of synthetic and natural dolomites formed at known temperatures results in a calibration line statistically indistinguishable from calcite clumped isotope calibrations. This supports the idea of a universal calibration for carbonate clumped <b>isotope</b> <b>thermometry</b> and enables new investigations into conditions of dolomite formation. Finally, the clumped isotope thermometer can be applied to key intervals for investigating paleoclimate and testing paleoclimate questions. To determine sea surface temperatures and water composition in Bermuda during the onset of Last Interglacial sea level rise, conventional and clumped isotope measurements of fossil shells were conducted. These results suggest meltwater influence and temperatures as much as 10 ° C colder than modern, requiring explanations that allow for major changes in North Atlantic surface ocean circulation.

This corresponds to formational depths {{on the order of}} 4 to 9 km and fluids consistent with a 10 – 20 Ma CO 2 -dominant fluid with approximate mole percentages of 84. 0, 11. 9, 1. 5, 1. 3, 0. 3, and 0. 5 for CO 2, H 2 O, CH 4, N 2, H 2 S, and NaCl, respectively...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} assess the {{potential}} of the honeycomb oyster Pycnodonte vesicularis for the reconstruction of palaeoseasonality, several specimens recovered from the late Maastrichtian Neuquén Basin (Argentina) were subject to a multi-proxy investigation, involving scanning techniques, trace element and isotopic analysis. Combined CT scanning and light microscopy reveals two major calcite micromorphologies in P. vesicularis shells (vesicular and foliated calcite). Micro-XRF analysis and cathodoluminescence microscopy show that reducing pore fluids were able to migrate through the vesicular portions of the shells (aided by bore holes) and cause recrystallization and precipitation of secondary carbonate in the porous micromorphology, thus rendering the vesicular portions not suitable for palaeoenvironmental reconstruction. In contrast, stable isotope and trace element compositions show that the original chemical composition of the shell is well-preserved in the denser, foliated portions, which can therefore be reliably used for the reconstruction of palaeoenvironmental conditions. Stable oxygen and clumped <b>isotope</b> <b>thermometry</b> on carbonate from the dense hinge region yield sea water temperatures of 11 °C, while previous TEX 86 H palaeothermometry yielded much higher temperatures. The difference is ascribed to seasonal bias in the growth of P. vesicularis, causing warm seasons to be underrepresented from the record, and TEX 86 H palaeothermometry being potentially biased towards warmer surface water temperatures. Superimposed on this annual mean is a seasonality in d 18 O of about 1 per mil, which is ascribed to a combination of varying salinity due to fresh water input in the winter and spring season and a moderate temperature seasonality. Attempts to independently verify the seasonality in sea water temperature by Mg/Ca ratios of shell calcite are hampered by significant uncertainty {{due to the lack of}} proper transfer functions for pycnodontein oysters. The multi-proxy approach employed here enables us to differentiate between well-preserved and diagenetically altered portions of the shells and provides an improved methodology for reconstructing palaeoenvironmental conditions in deep time. While establishing a chronology for these shells was severely complicated by growth cessations and diagenesis, cyclicity in trace elements and stable isotopes allowed a tentative interpretation of the potential annual seasonal cycle in the late Maastrichtian palaeoenvironment of the Neuquén basin. Future studies of fossil ostreid bivalves should target dense foliated calcite rather than sampling bulk or vesicular calcite. Successful application of clumped <b>isotope</b> <b>thermometry</b> on fossil bivalve calcite in this study indicates that temperature seasonality in fossil ostreid bivalves may be constrained by the sequential analysis of well-preserved foliated calcite samples using this method...|$|E
40|$|Carbonate clumped <b>isotope</b> <b>thermometry</b> is a {{relatively}} new paleotemperature proxy based on measurements of the degree of ordering of ^(13) C and ^(18) O into bonds with each other (making the ^(13) C^(18) O^(16) O_ 2 ^(− 2) ion group) in lattices of carbonate minerals. This technique has several unusual properties that complement existing methods of paleoclimate reconstruction. Most importantly, it is based on a homogeneous isotope exchange equilibrium and thus constrains temperature independent of the isotopic composition of waters from which carbonates grew. This method also appears to be generally insensitive to ‘vital effects’ that compromise many other paleothermometers based on the chemical properties of biominerals or organic matter, at least for those organisms that have been subjected to systematic study to-date (corals and foraminifera); however, discrepancies among some calibrations, particularly at low temperatures, may point toward the existence of vital effects in mollusks and other organisms. This review discusses the principles and calibrations of the technique, its uses in combination with conventional stable isotope measurements to constrain the δ^(18) O of past waters, preservation of paleotemperatures in ancient materials, as well as current problems in our understanding of calibrations and interlaboratory data comparisons...|$|E
40|$|During {{the early}} Paleogene, climate in {{continental}} interiors {{is thought to}} have been warmer and more equable than today, but estimates of seasonal temperature variations during this period are limited. Global and regional climate models of the Paleogene predict cooler temperatures for continental interiors than are implied by proxy data and predict a seasonal range of temperature that is similar to today. Here, we present a record of summer temperatures derived from carbonate clumped <b>isotope</b> <b>thermometry</b> of paleosol carbonates from Paleogene deposits in the Bighorn Basin, Wyoming (United States). Our summer temperature estimates are ∼ 18 °C greater than mean annual temperature estimated from analysis of fossil leaves. When coupled, these two records yield a seasonal range of temperature similar to that in the region today, with winter temperatures that are near freezing. These data are consistent with our high-resolution climate model output for the Early Eocene in the Bighorn Basin. We suggest that temperatures in continental interiors during the early Paleogene greenhouse were warmer in all seasons, but not more equable than today. If generally true, this removes one of the long-standing paradoxes in our understanding of terrestrial climate dynamics under greenhouse conditions...|$|E
40|$|During the Late Cretaceous, central Nevada {{may have}} been a high {{elevation}} plateau, the Nevadaplano; some geodynamic models of the western US require thickened crust and high elevations during the Mesozoic to drive the subsequent tectonic events of the Cenozoic while other models do not. To test the hypothesis of high elevations during the late Mesozoic, we used carbonate clumped <b>isotope</b> <b>thermometry</b> to determine the temperature contrast between Late Cretaceous to Paleocene carbonates atop the putative plateau in Nevada versus carbonates from relatively low paleoelevation central Utah site. Lacustrine carbonates from the Nevada site preserve summer temperatures ∼ 13 [*]°C cooler than summer temperatures from paleosol carbonates from the Utah site, after correcting for ∼ 1. 2 [*]°C of secular climatic cooling between the times of carbonate deposition at the two sites. This ∼ 13 [*]°C temperature difference implies an elevation difference between the two sites of ∼ 2. 2 – 3. 1 km; including uncertainties from age estimation and climate change broadens this estimate to ⩾ 2 km. Our findings support crustal thickness estimates and Cenozoic tectonic models that imply thickened crust and high elevation in Nevada during the Mesozoic...|$|E
