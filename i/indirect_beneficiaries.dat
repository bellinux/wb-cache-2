40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to analyze the {{adoption}} of environmental care strategies by manufacturing firms and their impacts on ecosystem health A conceptual framework based on the core concepts of environmental care, systems theory and ecosystem health is formulated The chosen area of study is manufacturing firms located within the Langat River Basin, Malaysia. The findings of this study indicate that in terms of inputs, the major forces driving the adoption of environmental care strategies are meeting market-driven needs via product quality and profit maximization via cost efficiency for vendor selection and the R&D focus on product development. As a result, ecosystem health has become the <b>indirect</b> <b>beneficiary.</b> The lack of R&D effort on the usage of new materials can have detrimental effect on ecosystem health if there is a faster draw-down on non-renewable resources. For the transformation process, investing in the best available technology is highly dependent on deep financial pockets, which in turn underpinned by the overarching concerns of market-driven needs and in tandem profit maximization. Energy conservation in the production process has not met with much success and as such has an adverse impact on ecosystem health. Compliance with the various certifications has morphed into standard operating procedures. These certifications, containing ecological characteristics, helped gain access to developed markets and in turn bring about direct and indirect positive impacts on ecosystem health. However, the lack of continuous upgrading of waste management system has an adverse impact on ecosystem health. For outputs, environmental care in the form of product standards especially eco-standards to fulfil the demands of developed markets has a positive impact on ecosystem health.

40|$|Participatory {{concept in}} {{projects}} {{is said to}} possess a high sustainability aspect built into the system since stakeholders {{are involved in the}} project from the beginning. With this concept instead of a traditional construction labour force, it is required to utilize the stakeholders while ensuring the quality and the speed of construction. Therefore it is important to identify the behaviour of the participation of stakeholders or beneficiaries to identify the tasks ahead of the engineers in expecting the development activities. In this respect this study attempts to identify the participatory behaviour in the minor irrigation tank rehabilitation of Sri Lanka. Historically the minor tanks have played a vital role in cultivation of crops in the dry zone of Sri Lanka. Due to lack of maintenance of the head-works and distribution system, a good majority of these tanks are not in full functional capacity and require significant improvement or rehabilitation for them to again {{play a major role in}} the agricultural production for the nation. The minor tank improvement scheme of the Department of Agrarian Services (DAS) under the UN supported World Food Programme (WFP), attempts to increase the involvement of the beneficiaries mainly in the construction works of the project thereby providing opportunities for learning and execution of rehabilitation activities. The WFP adopts an approach under which food rations will be provided as an incentive to the farmer participants to implement the project on a self-help basis. Locations of four rehabilitated irrigation reservoirs under the WFP, were selected for the study and in order to identify the participation, the study looked at both direct & <b>indirect</b> <b>beneficiary</b> participation and also the cultivator participation in the rehabilitation work. This study shows encouraging beneficiary participation in rehabilitation work of these reservoirs. The computed values indicate that nearly one in three beneficiary workforce members contributed to the rehabilitation activities. Female beneficiary contribution was substantial where an average of four out of ten beneficiaries contributed. Male beneficiary contribution was low with only one out of three beneficiaries participating. Cultivator participation reflected very poor male participation with only one out of five male cultivator beneficiary from the work force contributing to rehabilitation activities. Poor degree of male participation both overall and at cultivator level in all rehabilitation schemes indicate that the males may have had resorted to other employment...|$|R
40|$|The {{field of}} {{measurement}} can be conceptualized as having three different but interrelated aspects. First of all, it {{is a science}} or a body of knowledge concerned {{with the development of}} theory and methodology and with the identification and confirmation of generalizations governing interrelationships among variables appropriate to its content. Measurement theory and its application to measurement problems are important contributors here. Second, it is an applied science or technology concerned with the development of products that represent a useful application of such a science or body of knowledge. For the field of measurement, test development and validation are important exemplars. Third, it is a body of information concerned with why, when, and how these products are used, and the results of such use, in the practical measurement setting for which they were typically intended. This sequence of interrelated aspects of measurement, from knowledge to implementation to use, is the conceptual foundation for much of what follows. Within such a context as that just described, the Buros Institute of Mental Measurements has always played a unique role. The science of measurement or measurement theory has not been one of the Institute 2 ̆ 7 s chief concerns, although the Institute is often an <b>indirect</b> <b>beneficiary</b> of such contributions. However, the Institute has had major involvement with the evaluation of test products, the products of an applied science, and with the education of test users in the more effective selection and use of those products. Because of the nature of this involvement, the Institute has had a perspective on the three separate aspects of the field of measurement that is not typical of those representing only the singular aspects of the continuum. It is this unique perspective of the Institute that will serve as the distinguishing feature of the discussion to follow. The purpose of this discussion is to evaluate critically the contributions and progress made in these separate, but interrelated, aspects of measurement: knowledge, implementation, and use. The theme of this discussion is that the greatest {{progress has been made in}} our knowledge, lesser progress in implementation, and the very least progress in selection and effective use.

We use a combination of fixed effect and matching to estimate the causal effect-direct and indirect-of the program on various measures of performance. Our findings are robust to a placebo test based on anticipatory effects and show that the program increased employment, wages, and the exporting probability of both direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>beneficiaries.</b> The analysis of the dynamic of these effects confirms that performance does not improve immediately after the treatment for neither direct nor <b>indirect</b> <b>beneficiaries.</b> ...|$|E

Um processo de coleta de Ãleo de fritura residual envolve diferentes etapas e um nÃmero grande de participantes, ou seja, deve envolver toda sociedade. Foram realizadas entrevistas com os principais atores sociais que podem se envolver e tambÃm apoiar este processo no municÃpio de Cascavel, regiÃo Oeste do ParanÃ. A utilizaÃÃo de estabelecimentos de ensino pÃblicos que possuem ensino fundamental II, como pontos de coleta, Ã importante, pois envolve crianÃas e adolescentes que estÃo em formaÃÃo, portanto, estÃo na fase ideal para o desenvolvimento da consciÃncia ambiental e podem ser os disseminadores desta cultura no seu ambiente familiar, propiciando a extensÃo do projeto para toda a comunidade. AlÃm dos ganhos ambientais, ganhos econÃmicos e sociais tambÃm podem ser obtidos com a venda do resÃduo para transformaÃÃo em biodiesel, por meio das AssociaÃÃes de Pais, Mestres e FuncionÃrios (APMFs), que poderÃo aplicar os recursos para melhorias nas condiÃÃes de ensino. PorÃm, apesar dos benefÃcios possÃveis com o aproveitamento deste resÃduo destaca-se a falta de Leis especÃficas e de incentivos federais para o uso desta matÃria-prima para produÃÃo de biodiesel. Algumas Leis de incentivo em nÃvel estadual e municipal foram identificadas, entretanto, uma Lei Federal certamente iria impulsionar estas aÃÃes no Brasil. Destaca-se, tambÃm, que uma forma de reduzir o custo do biodiesel produzido a partir de Ãleo de fritura residual Ã utilizar uma rota otimizada de coleta e transporte deste resÃduo, o qual se encontra disperso em Ãreas urbanas. AtravÃs da logÃstica reversa do Ãleo de fritura residual, apresenta-se que a sustentabilidade em seus aspectos social, econÃmico e ambiental, com a aplicaÃÃo de uma legislaÃÃo eficaz e a otimizaÃÃo da rota de coleta para a reduÃÃo de custos, sÃo condicionantes para a criaÃÃo de um efetivo programa para a coleta desse tipo de resÃduo, Ãleo de fritura residual, para a produÃÃo de biodiesel.

This study {{aimed to}} propose a sustainable and optimized model of residual frying oil collection as raw material {{for the production of}} biodiesel from educational establishments, in accordance with current legislation. A process of collecting waste frying oil involves different steps, with a large number of participants, and should involve the society as a whole, so we carried out interviews with the main social performers that may be involved in supporting this process in the city of Cascavel, West of ParanÃ. The use of public education institutions that have Elementary School II as collection point is important, because it involves children and teenagers who are in training for the development of environmental awareness and they can be the disseminators of this culture in their familiar surroundings, resulting in the extension of the project to the whole community. In addition to the environmental gains, the economic gains can also be achieved with the sale of the waste for processing into biodiesel through Parents, Teachers, and Employees Associations (APTEs), which may apply the resources to improve teaching conditions. However, despite the potential benefits for the use of this waste it is highlighted the lack of specific laws and federal incentives for the use of this raw material for biodiesel production. Some incentive Laws at the state and municipal level were identified, however, a federal law would surely drive these actions in Brazil. It was also possible to identify that one way to reduce the cost of biodiesel produced from waste frying oil, which has been dispersed in urban areas, is using an optimized route collection and waste transport. Through the reverse logistics of waste frying oil, it is possible to conclude that sustainability, besides the application of effective legislation and the collection route optimization for cost reduction, makes up the conditions {{for the creation of a}} program of collecting waste frying oil for biodiesel production, in addition to the involvement of society, which is constituted as a source of generating waste and can also become the <b>indirect</b> <b>beneficiary</b> of a project like this...|$|R

The second objective is to assess the quality of diabetes care using quality measures by type of health plan. The final objective investigates whether diabetics enrolled in consumer directed health plans are more likely to be hospitalized, or hospitalized at a more severe disease stage, compared with diabetics enrolled in more traditional health insurance plans. Sources of Data: Truven MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters databases for time period 2004 through Q 12011, Truven MarketScan Health and Productivity Management database, Truven MarketScan Laboratory Results database, and the Medical Episode Grouper. Key Results: The employer's direct medical costs for beneficiaries with diabetes were higher than for beneficiaries without diabetes. Inpatient hospital costs account for the majority of the incremental costs. The employer's <b>indirect</b> costs for <b>beneficiaries</b> with diabetes were higher than for beneficiaries without diabetes. A lack of statistical significance suggests that the adjusted medical cost for diabetics enrolled in CDHPs is no different than the adjusted medical cost for diabetics enrolled in PPOs. Diabetic men are more likely to retire earlier and diabetic women are likely to retire later than non-diabetic men. Diabetics enrolled in CDHPs are more likely to get the recommended tests and maintain the recommended LDL levels than diabetics with other forms of insurance, but they are also more likely to maintain poor HbA 1 c levels. CDHP diabetics are less likely to be admitted to inpatient facilities when compared to PPO diabetics; and when admitted, CDHP diabetics are presented at a comparable disease stage as PPO diabetics...|$|R
40|$|While {{studies on}} {{conflict}} still occupy {{most of the}} interest of the Colombian academia, the researchers’ discourse on post-conflict is becoming more notorious. Academically speaking, a consensus on whether Colombia is or is not in a post-conflict stage has not been reached. On the contrary, the position of the current Government is very clear on the matter and recognized, in 2011, the existence of an armed conflict in the country which represents a huge contrast with the government of Álvaro Uribe who during eight years exhorted several times the denial of the conflict in Colombia. On the other side, 88 % of the Colombian population still thinks that the country {{is in a state of}} conflict (CNC, slide 11) while only 11 % thinks it is instead post-conflict. Even more interesting is the discovery that the higher the income level is the higher the percentage of people who think that there is still an armed conflict in the country (id.) Furthermore, the work of some scholars on post-conflict (Rettberg; Guerra & Plata) suggests the need to promote a cultural transformation in order to provide for a better transition. Inspired by this idea both from an academic as much as from a personal perspective, this research attempts to shed light into to what extent has conflict impacted a small group of middle to high income Colombian adults between 27 and 34 years old. Taking into account that the country is currently undergoing a transitional justice (TJ) process this exploratory research is meant to open the floor to rethink post-conflict and the possibilities of reconciliation. Although TJ processes are often said to shape an umbrella covering not only the people who were directly involved in the conflict, but also all the civil society as an <b>indirect</b> <b>beneficiary</b> of this process, in cases where TJ is not the result of a political transition towards a democracy, this research argues that the general population is often left out as an spectator of the process or is given little attention, despite the fact that most of the success of a transitional justice process in terms of reconciliation depends on the general society (“Entrevista Alejandro Éder”). When revising the bibliography on transitional justice and particularly the material related to truth-seeking and historic memory, it is evident that little attention is given to the impact of conflict in the segment of the population that is not normally considered a victim. Also within the academic sphere there is little research regarding the impact of conflict in different segments of society other than the direct victims. However, long lasting conflicts bring about cultural changes in society which are translated in the adoption of attitudes, values and behaviours developed to survive. This is what some anthropologists have called culture of war or conflict. Aside from the discussion on whether conflict is embedded in culture or not (Sluka 24), it is true that cultural changes caused by spread long standing violence might shape the society in a way that would make it difficult for it to overcome conflict if sociocultural aspects are not tackled. In this sense if civil population is not addressed adequately, reconciliation can become difficult and the cycle of violence might continue. As suggested by Sluka “understanding the cultural context is essential to understanding any specific instance or example of social conflict” (25). Understanding conflict as the product of specific types of social relations (id. 24) and thus turning to the lower levels of social structure provides a bottom-up perspective towards the subject. This perspective allows to understand and identify in which places of social life conflict is located and reproduced. As noted by Nordstrom & Martin “violence is not a socioculturally fragmented phenomenon that occurs ‘outside’ the arena of everyday life for those affected. (…) if we are to understand peace and conflict it is to the people themselves, to the social dynamics and cultural phenomena that inform them, that we must turn” (13 - 14). Acknowledging the voice of those who are not involved or affected by conflict will open the door for learning about different perspectives that the population might have about it. This is particularly important in contexts where there is not sufficient information on one or more actors. The lack of this sort of information might create a gap in history, politics and the understanding of conflict and the role of its actors. It might also prevent from thinking about post-conflict from a different perspective. 	Furthermore, as mentioned by Margold “[t]error and fear, made cultural, saturate a social group’s vision and distort its capacities to act” (64). Although this might be a psychological repercussion resulting from conflict, it can also be a symptom of the penetration of conflict within the culture. It might apply to any level of the social structure of a society that has experienced conflict for several years disregarding the level of exposure to war. Notwithstanding, Guerra & Plata mention the need that the Colombian society has to carry out actions focused on promoting cultural changes towards a culture of peace (89). Within this frame, there is still another voice that should be listened to in Colombia: that of the population that does not fit under the definition of victim given under Law 1448 of 2011 (also known as Law of Victims). The consequences of three decades of conflict in Colombia are not just political or economic. They are also social and cultural and as outlined above conflict transforms the lives and culture within a society, undermines trust and breaks the social tissue. Evidence of this can be found in the narratives of direct victims of conflict in Sierra Leone, Liberia, Peru and Colombia (Beah; Rubio; Londoño et al; Theidon) to name only a few. When conflict is chronic, its effects expand to segments of society which commonly are not seen as direct victims of it. In fact, the title of this thesis evidences how close is the target of this research to the victims of the conflict and calls for stronger attention on the topic. In an attempt to bring to public light the impact of long lasting conflicts in the general population, and the importance of addressing another segment of the population, this exploratory research will address the issue through the examination of the Colombian case, which has recently experienced a process of Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration (DDR) of the Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia (AUC) and has developed an advanced legal framework focusing on the victims. This gap has been approached by Madariaga (2006) who in a research carried out in Urabá (northwest of Bogotá) explored the influence of the paramilitary on daily life practices, the response to paramilitary law by the local population, the impact of the paramilitary presence in emotions and the significant ethical changes in the population after a decade of paramilitary presence. This ethnography was carried out with women that despite living in an area considered as one of the most difficult of the country did not identify with the category of 'victim'. Among her conclusions, Madariaga writes: Language, affective relations, and moral judgements are probably the spheres where the impact of the conditions of violence and the type of authority ruling the context are more visible (93) To stimulate the thinking on this regard, this research proposes a similar perspective. It is instead focused in a completely opposite target to the one covered by Madariaga. ...|$|R

The research methodology was based on a standard of principles, criteria and indicators (PC&I) in order to characterize the socioeconomic impacts of the program. The standard was the key factor for developing a semi-structured interview, with which the field information was collected. This information was afterwards analyzed quantitatively and statistically to identify the socio-economical impacts on each one of the beneficiaries. The study demonstrated that the PES program did not contribute to increase the economic welfare of the direct beneficiaries, questioning therefore the sustainability of the mechanism over time. Nevertheless, the study showed that the PES program improved the economic welfare of the <b>indirect</b> <b>beneficiaries</b> and related institutions, strengthening the relationships of the direct beneficiaries with financial institutions and forestry sector. Also, the program improved the perception of beneficiaries regarding the sustainable use of natural resources.

40|$|Flood {{protection}} schemes {{provide a}} wide range of benefits to people living in the immediate floodplain area and to those living further away from the floodplain area. Since such schemes are public goods, they are often provided and managed by the government or local bodies. According to the Local Government Act (No. 3) of 1996, the community based funding of such works are to be allocated purely according to benefit received. In other words, those who benefit from the works are required to contribute towards the costs of the works, in proportion to the benefits they received. Hence the need for the quantification of benefits. The Rating Powers Act of 1988 requires the rating of flood protection schemes to take into account direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>beneficiaries.</b> In this research the aim was to quantify the indirect benefits from flood protection in the Lower Waikato, using the non-market valuation technique of Contingent Valuation.

40|$|Abstract in Undetermined Abstract The aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} the structural licensing and the semantics of the dative-DP in ditransitive constructions in German from a cognitive and construction grammar perspective. While the indirect object in constructions with prototypical ditransitive verbs is said to be a lexically selected argument of the verb, the <b>indirect</b> object in <b>beneficiary</b> ditransitive constructions and ditransitive possessor dative constructions with (in) transitive verbs is traditionally categorized as a “free” dative. These verbs are generally analyzed as accomplishments, achievements and activities which can but need not be combined with a result predicate. They describe either the coming about of a change, the creation/destruction or the obtaining of an object. In generative syntactic analyses both the subcategorized and the free beneficiary and possessor datives are usually treated the same (with few exceptions) : either as arguments of a layered VP-structure, adjuncts or arguments of applicative heads. Even their case is often considered to be licensed in the same way. There are suggestions that these dative DPs bear either structural, oblique or inherent case. Within cognitive and construction grammar approaches to ditransitive constructions researchers often use the concept of established possession for both the prototypical ditransitive and the beneficiary ditransitive construction. While this is fine for the former, it cannot capture the ambiguity of constructions with beneficiary and possessor datives in German. I propose that this ambiguity arises due to the possibility to change the point of view on the action denoted by the verb. In my proposal the dative participant is related to the concept of the causal chain by Langacker (1987, 1991) in two different ways. While selected datives are part of the inherent event structure of ditransitive verbs, free datives relate to the event structure of the verb from “outside”. This gives rise to their interpretation as being affected by the event. Within the framework of the neo-constructionist First-Phase Syntax (Ramchand 2008) I assume that possessor datives and free beneficiary datives when interpreted as affectees are arguments of an applicative head which is inserted above the process denoting phrase in this model. As for the recipient reading in the presence of creation/destruction verbs and verbs of obtaining, the free dative is not part of the verbal event structure but can be involved in a prospective subsequent event. Since prospectivity even is possible not only with free datives but also with not obligatorily expressed selected datives I investigate the question if there might be a difference in the syntactic licensing of the two types of datives. I show that they do not differ in their structural licensing but could be treated as arguments of resultative predicates with different categorial labeling. They bear inherent case and are inserted in a phrase right beneath the process denoting phrase of the layered decomposition frame in Ramchand’s model...|$|R

For such a selection there is a number of criteria / indicators: internal rate of return, payback period, actuarial indicators, etc. In addition to these criteria, the authors propose to use in selection of investment projects economical-mathematical model {{that takes into account}} the restrictions prior to the project and its impact by various stakeholders (people involved in the designing and implementation of the project and the direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>beneficiaries</b> of the project). ...|$|E
30|$|This paper {{relies on}} a macro-econometric {{evaluation}} {{to assess the impact}} of the ISP policies taken as a whole. Although crucial for policy-making, an assessment of the macro-economic impact of the ISP reform has never been rigorously conducted for Belgium, that is, in searching for a causal link between the ISP and the increasing employment rate among older people from 2007 onwards. How can then citizens be ensured that public funds are spent wisely? Furthermore, most of the evaluation literature on labor market policies takes a micro-econometric approach, focusing on the evaluation of a specific program on its direct (and, at times, <b>indirect)</b> <b>beneficiaries.</b> The drawback of relying only on this approach is that it fails to capture possible general equilibrium impacts. And these impacts are likely to be further amplified if the program is part of a larger set of reforms, as is the case with the ISP.|$|E

Mostly this data is utilised by city authorities for city planning purposes and often citi- zens become <b>indirect</b> <b>beneficiaries</b> of such applications. In this paper we present an algorithm for real-time processing of streaming data from multiple sources. We also present the design and proof of concept of an application that per- forms mining and analysis of open data available through city portals and social networks and generates an informa- tion service in real time for use by city administrations. The prototype utilises streaming data from Twitter and open data from Bristol to demonstrate a hypothetical scenario using Apache Storm.

40|$|This {{document}} {{presents a}} quasi-experimental impact evaluation of Bolivia's Renta Dignidad, a universal and non-contributory old age pension. Causal effects on direct, future, and <b>indirect</b> <b>beneficiaries</b> are identified, {{taking advantage of}} a reduction in age of eligibility from 65 to 60 years in December 2007. Difference-in-difference and changes-in-changes approaches are used to calculate average and quantile treatment effects. For women, non-contributory pensions have, on average, increased their households' non-labor income. This has decreased their labor supply and labor earnings, in turn decreasing households' labor income and thus reducing, ceteris paribus, the program's effect on total per capita household income. Unexpectedly, the program did not have significant effects on men's welfare, investments and labor market outcomes. The results also suggest that additional resources were neither consumed nor invested in health, education, or the purchase of durables. Households most likely held the additional resources and invested in dwelling improvements...|$|E
40|$|Regarding „Quality in education”, {{respectively}} about ARACIP {{a lot of}} misconceptions are circulating: that entangles {{the educational}} process, that is „form without substance”, „it buries us in papers” (opinions of teachers, school managers and, sometimes, local representatives). It is often overlooked {{the fact that the}} institution mentioned above does not claims from schools any documents, just checks compliance and enforcement of the current legislation, by measuring in the same time the satisfaction of direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>beneficiaries</b> of education. Quality in education (whit its complex principles and practices crossing the entire educational environment) it is mainly oriented towards achieving results, reference to standards and meeting the needs and the expectations of education beneficiaries. Thus, quality in education represents a desideratum, necessary not only for alignment to national and European standards, but also to provide a fair start in life for young student, contributing to the increase of {{the quality of life of}} our future generations. ...|$|E
40|$|Due to {{globalization}} and market conditions, risks of disruptions {{are considered a}} “normal state” for supply chains. Therefore, managers need to start making decisions with a risk impact approach in mind. Consequently, this research demonstrated through the use AHP methodology the impact of; Firm, Supply and Environmental disturbance factors over HVE companies and relevant mitigation strategies supported with examples. Since there is not exact definition for High Value Engineering (HVE), a concept framework was developed to validate the definition suggested by Wang and Zhang, (2014) : “High-value engineering is to create value for its direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>beneficiaries</b> based on integrating different functions and subjects as well as resources along the whole value creation stage, the interaction among which (including cooperation and friction) finally causes value creation” The research methodology consisted on: 1) Identification of key disturbance factors, 2) Development of AHP structure, 3) Formulation of questionnaires, 4) data collection and 5) AHP weigh computation. The highest impact disturbance factors were: “Demand-Supply Responsiveness (Supply) ” had the 1 st place with 25. 4...|$|E
40|$|In {{partnership}} with the national counterparts, the project aims at developing a strategy for open data, particularly in thematic areas relevant to the achievement of internationally agreed development goals, including MDGs. Primarily, the government data to be shared with the wider public in open format may include public expenditure and budgeting data, environmental data, procurement data, demographic data, socio-economic indicators, healthcare data, geographical data and local transportation data. The project aims at assisting {{with the development of}} a policy framework and technical infrastructure for implementation of OGD initiatives. It will strive at strengthening the open data community within selected countries. The target beneficiaries include, {{but are not limited to}} government officials responsible for data coordination in the country such as Chief Information Officers (or equivalent), Information Privacy Commissioners, Procurement Divisions and relevant government officials from ministries and governmental institutions responsible for selected policies (e. g. Ministries of Planning). <b>Indirect</b> <b>beneficiaries</b> include citizens and communities at large. The project will also stimulate a south-south knowledge transfer and cross-fertilization of OGD by bringing together OGD-beginners with more OGD-advanced countries. International workshops, online training courses, and availability of workshop reports will increase the outreach of the project on a global scale...|$|E
40|$|The {{construction}} industry is the instrument through which urbanization is undertaken. As {{it is generally}} recognized as the major locomotive, the {{construction industry}} {{sets the tone for}} the national economy. In recent months, the construction activities have increased considerably and several major housing and infrastructure projects are now under way both in the West Bank and Gaza. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to evaluate a training programme, which is conducted in the Gaza Strip for Palestinian contractors. The primary p urpose of the programme was to improve management and increase productivity of existing small scale construction enterprises in Palestine. An assessment of Improve Your Construction Business (IYCB) is made. The qualitative research of interviewing was used in this study. This has been conducted by reviewing project documents, reports, publications and interviewing all the project's stakeholders, at the institutional level as well as the level of the intended direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>beneficiaries.</b> The paper concludes with a set of findings and recommendations in order to supply the necessary feedback and information needed to assess and possibly revise policies, strategies, objectives, institutional arrangements and resources...|$|E
40|$|Top {{to bottom}} {{initiatives}} are being exported {{to developing countries}} with the same patterns and patriarchal structures {{that exist in the}} west. Since the 70 ´s and currently, non formal education (NFE) programmes are being used by International Agencies, NGOs and Governments to promote universal education and gender equality. These goals have been approached from different political discourses along time, making NFE an instrument characterised and defined in various ways. At present NFE appear as a mechanism in the Millennium Development Goals Report and in the Educational Policy in Ethiopia involving in theory the participation and empowerment of direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>beneficiaries.</b> In this context, this study looks at the power dynamics and gender relations that are generated in a NFE programme in Ethiopia specifically an Alternative Basic education centre, questioning the absence of theory in NFE programmes currently and its consequence of not approaching education as an empowerment element or pragmatic instrument to challenge the status quo. Through a gender analysis of various aspects of the concrete programme we arrive to the theoretical discourse that embraces this new era of post development. In addition, this paper carries out an analysis of how the patterns of traditional gender roles and power dynamics are systematically and institutionally repeated and not challenged through non formal education...|$|E
40|$|DIMAS is a 2 -year project {{executed}} by three Belgian partners (EURAS, VLIZ and Ghent University) {{and funded by}} the SPSD II research program of the Belgian Science Policy (BELSPO). Several shipping accidents in Belgian territorial waters, made the various government agencies involved {{aware of the need}} to develop tools to assess the risks and impact on marine resources {{in the case of an}} accidental release of hazardous substances. DIMAS aims at the protection of the North Sea and Western Scheldt in case of accidental spills from ships. In the present project, a relational database is developed, providing reliable, easy to interpret and up-to-date information on marine specific issues. The database contains the latest information on effects (acute and chronic), absorption, distribution, bioaccumulation/biomagnification, GESAMP hazard profiles and physico-chemical properties for a selection of priority substances and is publicly available (www. vliz. be/projects/dimas). The selection of the substances is based on criteria such as occurrence on priority lists, volumes transported over sea, frequency of involvement in accidental spills and frequency of transports over sea. The first beneficiaries of this database are the people directly involved in the first phase of a containment plan for an accidental spill. The final <b>indirect</b> <b>beneficiaries</b> are the general public (scientists, journalists, general public, etc.) who will be better informed about the potential impact to man and the environment...|$|E
40|$|Theme 2 The funding {{problems}} of land passenger transport {{in developing countries}} are different and more complicated. The paper brings out the present scenario of financial performance and funding arrangements in the Railways and the Roadways carrying passengers {{in a country like}} India which represents developing nations of the world. Since mobility of people within the country and particularly in the cities is considered as a public utility function of the governments and local bodies, the funding of capital is mainly through the General Exchequer. This is supported by internal generation of funds within and borrowing from Financial Institutions. These measures of funding being very inadequate, new methods of attracting private capital in passenger transport sector have been proposed. Since the liberalized economic policies have been recently introduced in the country, encouragement for the private capital participation in projects under BOOT has been an important issue for consideration. Taxing the direct and the <b>indirect</b> <b>beneficiaries</b> of new transport projects to be undertaken, inviting participation of general and institutional investors in the capital formation are some other measures suggested. Commercial exploitation of transport land, commercial outlook for transport organizations and freedom to fix passenger fares will also strengthen the funding operations of capital projects in land passenger transport in India.

40|$|AbstractIn {{the current}} context, where school faces a {{multitude}} of psychosocial issues, the pedagogical counselling activities have become an indispensable prerequisite, related to {{almost every aspect of}} the educational system or learning process. Starting from the premise that one of the fundamental tasks of the pedagogical/school counselling work is offered by providing students with a range of effective learning techniques, in this study we intend to customize this aspect, taking into account the training approach developed within Science disciplines. As such, {{the purpose of this study}} is to capture the impact that the pedagogical counselling process has on the optimization of the learning activities related to Science area (Chemistry, Physics and Biology). Thus, we undertook an investigative approach, from a sample of over 1. 000 Romanian secondary school students, as <b>indirect</b> <b>beneficiaries</b> of the teacher training programme “PROFILES - Education through Sciences”. The questionnaire administered to those students envisaged a number of issues concerning: the attractiveness of the Science lessons, their impact on the affective, behavioural and learning style, valorisation of their effectiveness in efficient instructional models, the importance of the lessons from the perspective of determining their skills for everyday life, specific pedagogical relations that are structured in such teaching approaches, etc. The data processed from the questionnaires, correlated with the results gathered from the focus group discussions, allowed us to formulate pertinent conclusions regarding the facilitator role of the school counselling activities, in terms of learning management disciplines within the specific Science content...|$|E
40|$|T he South African {{political}} “miracle ” is now 5 years old. On June 2, 1999,the citizens went to {{the polls}} in the second democratic election since theend of white minority rule in 1994. The African National Congress was re-elected with an increased majority (65 %) and Thabo Mbeki replaced Nelson Mandela as president. The transformation of South African society and its institutions from apartheid to racial equality has been a long and arduous process, one that is far from com-plete. South Africans themselves have been the major agents of change, but other countries and international agencies have played important roles, often more nega-tive than positive. Canada’s support for successive apartheid regimes has been well documented, 1 and our active recruitment of South African physicians to meet our rural and remote needs undercuts South Africa’s attempts to solve its own physician shortage. 2 South Africans might well ask what Canada will provide in exchange for all that we have taken from their country. The role of the South African medical profession in apartheid is now acknowl-edged as generally shameful. However, the profession {{has been one of the}} more ac-tive participants in the transformation of South African society during the past decade.
