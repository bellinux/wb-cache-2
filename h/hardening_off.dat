The selective breeding of varieties capable of withstanding particular climates forms {{an important part of}} agriculture and horticulture.

50|$|Different {{species and}} {{varieties}} react differently to transplanting; for some, {{it is not}} recommended. In all cases, avoiding transplant shock - the stress or damage received in the process - is the principal concern.

Pretreatment of nodal explants in a liquid Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium augmented with various thidiazuron (TDZ) concentrations at relatively high levels (5 – 100 μM) for different time duration (4, 8, 12 and 16 d), proved a significant approach for in vitro shoot production. After an initial exposure time to TDZ, nodal explants were inoculated onto a MS basal medium devoid of TDZ for further induction and proliferation.

40|$|Thesis {{submitted}} in fulfilment of {{the requirements}} for the degree Master of Technology: Horticultural Sciences in the Faculty of Applied Sciences at the CAPE PENINSULA UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY Supervisor: Dr L Kambizi Co-supervisor: Dr NP Makunga Cape Town December 2013 Agathosma betulina (Berg.) Pillans, previously known as Barosma betulina, {{is a member of}} the Rutaceae family, and indigenous to the fynbos botanical biome of the Western Cape of South Africa. It is commonly known as buchu. Extracts as well as powdered leaves have traditionally been used for the treatment of various ailments. The increase in the international demand for A. betulina for health as well as food and beverage benefits, have raised concerns over exploitation of wild populations and the lack of horticultural information necessitates this study to evaluate the propagation of this economical important species. The main objective of this study was to establish a simple and highly productive micropropagation protocol for A. betulina through experimenting with nodal explants. Testing of the effect of various treatments (physical scarification, chemical scarification, GA, stratification, smoke and combinations thereof) on the in vitro germination of A. betulina seeds was done to elucidate the factors which control seed germination. The study revealed that the physical scarification and smoke-induced germination had a significant effect on germination percentages. In terms of germination rate, the radical generally started to appear after approximately 10 days in the physical scarification with smoke treatment. Initial decontamination methods with the exposure of various concentrations of NaOCl gave fatal results, however 1. 5 % NaOCl had more phenolic reactions rather than fungal or bacterial contamination. Interestingly, contamination rates of explants were influenced by the stage of maturity of the explant material. This plant material was used to test different strengths of regeneration media, to ensure that the explants receive ample nutrients. Results made exhibited that ½ MS was the best strength for growing A. betulina nodal explants. Compared comparison between in vitro derived explants and ex vitro collected explants showed that the ex vitro derived explants had significant results, but the explants lost vigour soon after the initial exponential growth leading to the explants dying off. Furthermore, ex vitro decontaminated plant material was not economically viable to continue with. Seedlings derived from germinated seeds appeared to be the preferred method of propagation as this spent the least time in culture and produced a stable plant with an established root system, which is essential during the <b>hardening</b> <b>off</b> process after in vitro growth. When exposing nodal explants to phytohormone 2, 4 -D it responds best to dosages 0. 5 mg Lˉ¹ and 1 mg Lˉ¹. Phytohormone BA was very effective in producing soft friable callus. The best results were shown when 0. 5 mg Lˉ¹ BA was applied to ½ MS media. For both shoot length and multiple shoot production, a combination of phytohormones BA-NAA (1 : 0. 5 mgLˉ¹) had the most significant results. Interestingly, a higher phytohormone concentration of NAA is necessary to develop multiple adventitious roots. The effect of 3 mg Lˉ¹ was significant in that it resulted in multiple adventitious roots, but fewer calli was observed in this treatment. Micropropagation becomes valuable as little attention between subcultures is needed; making it less labour intensive compared to conventional nursery propagation systems where weeding watering and spraying of plants are labour intensive. In the traditional world of medicine, more so in Southern Africa, extracts are prepared by adding boiling water to the plant material; however commercial ethanol is used as an extractant. Establishment of the essential oil quality of the in vitro cultures post exposure to various treatments was done. Analysis of essential oils from A. betulina resulted in the identification of twenty one compounds. The results showed qualitative as well as quantitative differences amongst the samples used in the study. The highest relative concentration of limonene was observed in the callus of nodal explants after it was exposed to 0. 5 mg lˉ¹ NAA. No pulegone was found in this treatment making it ideal for limonene production. This suggests that liquid culture with the same treatment may produce more calli making it ideal for the production of limonene...|$|E
40|$|For twenty years, the {{development}} of biotechnology {{has given rise to}} great hopes and has stimulated considerable research effort throughout the world. Today, this effort is producing its first results in agriculture. Although still modest in comparison with the prospects originally envisaged, these achievements should be of interest to both developing and developed countries. No one can afford to ignore the major economic impact that the control and commercial exploitation of some biotechnological procedures could have. Taken in its widest sense, biotechnology encompasses any improvement that makes use of a biological process. Simple examples in agriculture and food processing are brewing and the processing of milk, which have for centuries made use of living organisms such as bacterial and moulds. Farmers, whose work has always been to improve and exploit natural processes, often against considerable odds, could be thought of as the first biotechnologists. Genetic engineering Scientists prefer a more restricted definition of biotechnology. Plant biotechnology can be defined as comprising a range of new methods which lead to varietal improvement, true reproduction and {{a very large number of}} individual plants which are exactly the same as the improved parent variety. Even with this more focused definition, there are a great many research and development programmes within the field of biotechnology. A study conducted in 1993 by IBS (Intermediary Biotechnology Service) of ISNAR (International Service for National Agricultural Research) listed 216 separate activities, of which 75 % were devoted to plants and, of these, more than 40 % were of direct interest to developing countries. By using molecular markers to study plant and animal genetic diversity and genetic engineering to modify genetic inheritance, new varieties can be created, which could not be achieved by natural means. Enriched by genes introduced through Bacillus thuringiensis, a plant can be made toxic to insect pests. The same technology can be used to make tobacco resistant to tobacco mosaic virus and to modify the composition of soya oil. In theory, the range of possibilities is limitless. Some research teams are devoting considerable resources to surprising projects such as creating varieties of banana, which when eaten will provide immunisation against hepatitis or cholera. Given the resources and skills required for genetic engineering, research programmes are led by strong teams, which are becoming increasingly international and collaborative. Some of the transgenic varieties which are of direct importance to many ACP countries now on trial under glass include cotton, rice and cassava. Open field trials of such varieties are not without potential risk. To date, only one variety of tomato and one of cotton, have been officially authorized for widespread cultivation in the United States. The ACP countries can often do little more than express an interest in the direction of international research. Nevertheless, it is important that they should not lose interest in genetic engineering because of the prospects for true reproduction of plant material, and it is this that will have the most impact on agricultural development. Professor Albert Sasson, Special Adviser to the Director General of UNESCO, believes that 'Africa is, without doubt, the region where biotechnology is least developed. ' Even if this is true, ACP countries can take advantage of the many laboratory results obtained for temperate plants which are often applicable to many tropical plants. Overcoming nature's obstacles The purpose of cloning is to reproduce from one plant a great number of progeny which are genetically identical to the parent. This parent plant, a banana or a coffee variety for example, will have been chosen for particular performance characteristics that meet the needs of growers. Some plants, such as rice or cotton, are self-fertile and produce daughter plants that are practically identical to the mother plant in performance. Others require cross fertilization between male and female plants of the same species. This is the case with maize and the majority of the principal species of perennial plantation crops such as palm oil, robusta coffee, rubber or cocoa. Progeny of plants that have been cross fertilized may not ' breed true. This is why farmers find that their yields of maize are much lower when they sow seed saved from the previous year's c harvest of a high yielding hybrid. Certain plants, like the cultivated banana, are sterile and cannot reproduce naturally except from side shoots. This hampers varietal improvement by classical methods and limits the availability of good planting material. Biotechnology is opening the way for micropropagation, meristem culture and, more recently, somatic embryogenesis in order to overcome these different obstacles. By making it possible to obtain plantlets from fragments of stem or shoot, micropropagation is no different in principle to classical methods of propagation. In vitro propagation is more sophisticated than the techniques practiced by horticulturalists and it has two distinct advantages: the ability both to produce many more offspring, and to ensure that the plantlets raised are completely healthy. One parent plant can give rise to many hundreds of millions of identical plantlets which are free of viral diseases. Costs of production depends on the level of handling required and this gives countries which have low salary structures, such as those in the ACP regions, an advantage. Some ACP countries already have sizeable production units. Focusing on flowers and bananas In Kenya, where flowers are the third largest export crop after tea and coffee, the Kenya Agricultural Research Institute (KARI) has developed in vitro cultivation of flowering plants. KARI has been working in collaboration with Oserian, one of the three largest private horticultural companies in the country. The company has its own tissue culture laboratory, and since 1994 a staff of 54 people. Varieties are reproduced after being selected for productivity and resistance to pests. The company is planning to commercialize its in vitro plant production for the Kenyan horticultural industry and for export. Côte d'Ivoire, Zimbabwe and Mauritius (which has overtaken Hawaii in anthurium production) have also developed micro-propagation facilities to service their own horticultural sector. It is with bananas and plantains that these techniques have produced the most significant results for ACP countries. A private company based in Santo Domingo, in the Dominican Republic, has developed commercial production of in vitro plants with the support of the Centre for Research and Training in Tropical Agriculture for Central America and the Caribbean (CATIE) which is based in Costa Rica. The company, Luoma Vitrolab, grew out of a family horticultural business and multiplies not only bananas but also many ornamentals and aromatic plants. In addition to its principal research activities, the Cameroon-based Regional Centre for Bananas and Plantains (CRBP) also distributes in vitro plants of forty varieties that are used for local consumption. These are cultivated at its station in Njombe from vegetative material supplied by INIBAP whose collections are kept in Leuven, Belgium. The plantlets are sent to a network of development agencies and research centres, specifically in Gabon (AGRO Gabon, IGAD and CENAREST), in Congo (Agri Congo, DGRST) and in the Central African Republic (ICRA). They are used for training technicians to harden the plants for outdoor conditions and set them out in demonstration plots for farmers. By setting up this distribution chain to small producers, the foundations are laid for promising future commercial production. In some large plantation-holding companies, in vitro cultivation techniques has already grown to an industrial scale, particularly in Africa. This has considerable significance in view of their agricultural and economic importance. In Abidjan, the Society for the Study and Development of Bananas, a subsidiary of Terres Rouges, produces a million healthy, nematode-free plants each year for its parent company Even if the distribution of these products to small-scale producers on the continent has yet to be established, trade in in vitro plants is becoming the focus of major international producers. Tropitec, a private company in South Africa, has a commercial agreement to multiply plantain hybrids which are supplied from Honduras by the Honduran Foundation for Agricultural Research. Millions of plantains are then returned in test tubes by air to Honduras where Tropitec has a specialized unit for <b>hardening</b> <b>off</b> the in vitro plants ready for commercial production throughout tropical Latin America. Uganda's test-tube coffee Uganda is the second largest producer of robusta coffee in Africa after Côte d'Ivoire. At the beginning of 1996, a laboratory for in vitro cultivation was established within the Farming Systems Programme, a national programme funded by the KU. One activity of the programme is to replant old coffee trees with higher yielding varieties that are resistant to rust. This medium-sized production unit, which was established within the Institute of Agricultural Research in Kawanda with the technical support of CIRAD, has the capacity to prepare a million micro-propagated coffee plants per year, with a staff of only six. After the initial start-up phase, production will be targeted towards the country's 1. 2 million small-scale coffee growers. These growers, who make up 7. 5 % of the population, grow 250, 000 hectares of coffee, which in 1990 brought in 79 % of Uganda's export earnings. The Kawanda laboratory will strengthen the Institute of Agricultural Research's traditional nursery, which currently produces several thousand clones each year. These are distributed to propagation units which then multiply them for onward sale to producers. The capacity of this classical horticultural propagation system is far below that required for the Uganda programme, which envisages the replacement of every coffee tree in the country. Given that 2, 000 plants are required per hectare, the new laboratory will be able to meet only a small proportion of the demand. It seems likely that private companies will eventually take on this work, therefore the laboratory is already diversifying into meristem culture of local varieties of bananas. Work on cassava may follow. With an annual operational budget of US$ 150, 000, the Kawanda laboratory can produce 500, 000 in vitro plants of coffee per year and as many banana plants. Smallscale growers currently pay US 50 cents (US$ 0. 5) for a traditionally raised robusta plant. The difference in price allows for marketing costs and a profit on the work of <b>hardening</b> <b>off</b> the in vitro plants: work which a farmer, once trained, can easily master. Back to the future Research is currently well advanced in the technique of cloning by somatic embryogenesis which is far more powerful in terms of productivity than micropropagation. This technique, for example with leaves, consists of taking back differentiated, non-reproductive cells to an undifferentiated state, so that they can each develop as a complete individual plant, genetically identical to the parent. Somatic embryogenesis requires the use of complex hormones and is particularly well adapted for cloning some species, like oil palm, where other in vitro propagation techniques are impractical. Experiments are usually undertaken by collaboration between universities and the major European research centres. Field trials are currently taking place in order to check that each developing plant conforms to type, and particularly to fruit formation. A consortium of agro-processing companies is quietly conducting trials in Brazil and Ecuador of several thousand arabica coffee trees propagated by somatic embryogenesis. To date there appear to be no problems with conformity. Oil palm produced by the same technique is proving equally satisfactory. A research team of scientists drawn from ORSTOM and CIRAD have conducted field trials in Côte d'Ivoire for several years and appear to have achieved a potential productivity gain in the order of 15 % to 20 %. This has also been observed in Indonesia and Malaysia. Having had their fingers burnt in the past by too hasty forays into industrialization, the scientists will remain cautious for a few more years. But there can be hardly any doubt that somatic embryogenesis is an essential technique for multiplying, and therefore adding value to varieties Improved by genetic engineering. Weak commercial management Many attempts to transfer and adapt technologies in the past, particularly in West Africa, have had no impact beyond that of training scientists and laboratory technicians, although this is not an insignificant achievement in itself. Some of the technologies involved species for which there was no real market. However, research efforts on varieties of major economic importance are beginning to give biotechnology its first significant developments in some ACP countries. Technology and production costs are no longer always the limiting factor to using biotechnology. This has been shown by the experience of large plantation-owning companies and by the intensive floricultural export industry. However, it is also true that the absence of commercial management know-how at the heart of publicly-owned production facilities still restricts the distribution of the products of biotechnology to scattered markets in the villages. As with many other agricultural inputs, it would appear that without the necessary marketing strategy, any attempt within the public sector to adopt new technologies, however sound will always remain a risk.

40|$|This {{research}} project {{was carried out}} using the ornamental species E. erythronema, E. stricklandii, their natural interspecific hybrid E. 'Urrbrae Gem', and artificial hybrids of these two species, {{with the aim of}} identifying a clonal propagation method for hybrid omamental eucalypts using the tissue culture techniques of micropropagation, organogenesis and somatic embryogenesis. Seeds of E. erythronema, E. stricklandii, and E. 'Urrbrae Gem' were decontaminated and germinated in culture for experiments on callus growth and response to plant growth regulators. Murashige and Skoog (1962) medium supplemented with 1 uM BAP, 10 uM NAA, 20 g⁻¹ sucrose, gelled with 7 g⁻¹ Phytagel® proved the most suitable callus growth medium when compared to those of Gamborg (1968), Lloyd and McCown (woody plant medium) (1980), Almehdi and Parfitt (1996) and de Fossard(1976) (Eucalyptus). A range and combination of plant growth regulators was used to investigate organogenesis, somatic embryogenesis and axillary shoot proliferation. A broad based experiment was first conducted to assess the response of the hybrid and its parental species to wide concentrations of commonly used auxins and cytokinins known to induce organogenesis and somatic embryogenesis. Callus growth was consistent across all genotypes and tissue types with soft and spongy callus growth in the presence of 2, 4 -D and hard and friable callus in the presence of NAA, while callus growth was greater with auxin or auxin/cytokinin (BAP or kinetin) combinations compared to cytokinin alone. Healthy root development was observed from treatments with NAA, while roots that developed from treatments with 2, 4 -D turned brown within 12 weeks. Bud development was observed with BAP alone or in combination with NAA with large bud clusters observed on E. erythronema and E. 'Urrbrae Gem' explants. Shoots, were observed in treatments with NAA alone, or in combination with BAP or kinetin, but not in treatments with 2, 4 -D. No somatic embryos were observed with any treatment or taxon. Light microscopy of explants treated with 2, 4 -D alone showed calli consisting only of large parenchyma cells, while 2, 4 ¬D in combination with a cytokinin produced smaller parenchyma cells, with areas of vascular tissue and spherical growths. BAP, kinetin and NAA alone or in combination produced an increase in vascular tissue. Shoot and root initiation appeared to occur within the callus with connection to the vascular tissue. Shoot organogenesis from E. erythronema, E. stricklandii and E. 'Urrbrae Gem' seedlings and E. erythronema x E. stricklandii hybrid 2. 5 was further investigated using apex and leaf explants with 1 uM and lower levels of BAP. Apex and leaf explants of E. erythronema and E. 'Urrbrae Gem' developed clusters of buds from the apex base and leaf petiole while apex and leaf explants of E. stricklandii and hybrid 2. 5 produced individual buds. Bud and shoot development was greater on apex than leaf explants with 0. 5 and 1 uM BAP producing the greatest shoot numbers. Light microscopy showed that meristem development had occurred within the callus and bud structures, but there were few shoot primordia considering the amount of meristem development (meristemoids). Somatic embryogenesis was further investigated in juvenile ad callus tissue using NAA, NAA/ 2, 4 -D combinations, and heat and smoked water treatments. Somatic embryogenesis was not observed macroscopically with 2, 4 -D and NAA treatments. Globular somatic embryo structures were observed on apex explants of 'Urrbrae Gem' seedlings at 2 wk on MS medium supplemented with 16. 11 uM NAA but there was no development beyond the globular stage. Areas of defined callus development, which did not contain typical embryogenic cells, were observed on all treatments and genotypes. Root development was observed from all auxin treatments but was less on explants treated with 5. 37 uM NAA/ 4. 5 uM 2, 4 -D compared to NAA alone while roots and shoots developed simultaneously on apex explants after culture for 1 wk on MS medium supplemented with 80. 55 uM NAA. Heat and smoked water were detrimental to E. 'Urrbrae Gem' callus and no somatic embryogenesis was observed. Explants from field trees of E. erythronema, E. stricklandii, E. 'Urrbrae Gem', E. erythronema x stricklandii hybrids 20 E, 20 P, 20 R, 20 T, 20 V, 21 A, 21 G, 21 U and potted plants of E. erythronema x E. stricklandii hybrids 35. 2 and 2. 5 growing under glasshouse conditions, were harvested and initiated into culture. Of the selected plants only explants from glasshouse grown material could be initiated into culture and multiplied. E. erythronema x stricklandii hybrids 35. 2 and 2. 5. were multiplied by axillary shoot proliferation over 3 yr on Quoirin and Lepoivre medium (1977) with 2. 2 uM BAP, 0. 5 uM NAA and 0. 5 uM GA 3, 20 g⁻¹ sucrose, gelled with 7 g⁻¹ Phytagel®. However root growth proved difficult as shoots developed short thick roots that failed to elongate and the plants could not be hardened off. By using zeatin in the multiplication medium and activated charcoal after the IBA pulse elongated roots suitable for <b>hardening</b> <b>off</b> were developed. By comparison seedlings of E. 'Urrbrae Gem' were successfully germinated in culture and multiplied by axillary shoot proliferation using WPM, 2. 2 uM BAP, 0. 5 uMNAA and 0. 5 uM GA 3, 20 g⁻¹ sucrose, gelled with 7 g⁻¹ Phytagel®. They were rooted on 1 / 2 WPM, 20 uM IBA, 10 g⁻¹ sucrose gelled with 7 g⁻¹ Phytagel® for 7 d, followed by subculture to PGR free medium. Following root initiation and growth plants were hardened off to the external environment. In conclusion genetic differences were observed between genotypes, in regards to initiation into culture, and response to nutrient medium, and plant growth regulators, with differences observed in explant deterioration, medium exudates, callus growth and appearance, somatic embryogenesis, bud, shoot and root organogenesis, axillary shoot development, and rooting of shoots. For organogenesis, juvenile explants were more responsive in culture than mature explants and potted plants more responsive than field plants for micropropagation. Shoot and root organogenesis was achieved from juvenile explants while shoot explants of E. erythronema x E, stricklandii hybrids were successfully micropropagated by axillary shoot proliferation. Somatic embryogenesis was observed with E. 'Urrbrae Gem' seedlings but was blocked at the globular stage. This research has provided a greater understanding of the clonal propagation requirements via tissue culture techniques for E. erythronema, E. stricklandii and their hybrids. Thesis (Ph. D.)

Unlike other cold hardy grapes, it will grow long into fall if weather is clement, but can <b>harden</b> <b>off</b> remarkably fast in a cold snap. This makes it ideally suited for North American winter weather which often include sudden {{fluctuations}} in temperature, and is superior in this regard to its rival for second place in cold hardiness among grapes, Vitis amurensis, which is notorious for coming out of hibernation during a warm spell only to be damaged by a sudden frost.|$|R

50|$|Gardeners in cold-winter {{states have}} also had success with newer cross-breeds, {{especially}} those between L. Indica and L. Faueri, which offer increased winter hardiness. Frequently L. Indica is root hardy to Zone 5, meaning it will be killed back during harsh winters but regrow from the roots and flower in summer. As such Northern gardeners treat it more like a perennial than a tree or shrub. The U.S. National Arboretum has developed cold-hardy varieties that can withstand Zone 6 winters, though they may die back during bad cold snaps. Too much watering and over-fertilizing can decrease the cold hardiness of L. indica because it stimulates new growth {{late in the season}} that does not have time to <b>harden</b> <b>off.</b>|$|R

50|$|It is {{recommended}} to start red cabbage seeds indoors 4 {{weeks before the}} last frost. Sow in containers that allow for movement of water through {{the bottom of a}} cell. Popular seedling starting containers are peat pots, egg cartons, plug trays or milk cartons. Once the seedlings grow to about 2 inch cm tall, and have developed their first leaves, they can be <b>hardened</b> <b>off</b> and moved outside for transplanting. Red cabbage prefers climates that remain moist and cool for most of its vegetative growth stage, so they can be placed in the ground shortly after the last frost, while the spring is still cool. The cabbage plants can be spaced about 12 - 26 inch cm from one another. They will need watering often but are otherwise low maintenance plants.|$|R

50|$|Norway maple, {{red maple}} and sugar maple are the species most {{commonly}} affected. The trouble often starts after insect-induced defoliation, which weakens {{the trees and}} makes them more susceptible to secondary pathogens. Early signs of decline include small or scorched foliage, and premature fall colors on some of a tree's branches. Later, dead twigs may become visible as signs of distress become evident throughout the crown. As the tree's condition deteriorates, whole branches die. The tree may attempt to compensate for its diminishing crown by producing leafy shoots on its trunk. The defoliation may occur early enough that the tree may produce new leaves in summer that do not <b>harden</b> <b>off</b> before the first frost. Fruiting bodies of bracket fungi may appear on the trunk or in the crown. Eventually, the whole tree dies. The process from first signs of trouble to total death may span anywhere from {{a few years to}} several decades.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} of the trial was to determine an effective propagation protocol for jacket plum (Pappea capensis) tree species. Experiments on in vitro propagation and rooting of stem cuttings were carried out. Dipping stem cuttings in half strength Murashige and Skoog (MS) media for 12  h prior to application of rooting hormones improved bud break and prolonged survival of stem cuttings on a mist bed. Early leaf loss was observed for stem cuttings planted without MS treatment. However, rooting was poor (11 % for cuttings pre-treated in MS and 0 % for those not pre-treated). For micro-propagation, significant differences (P< 0. 05) in shoot multiplication and root regeneration were found. MS media supplemented with 2. 0  mg l– 1 benzylaminopurine was superior {{in the number of}} micro-shoots produced. Rooting capacity of micro-cuttings was improved from 42 % to 64 % when MS media supplemented with 0. 5  mg l– 1 IBA were repeated for the micro-cuttings that initially failed to root.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to determine efficient preconditioning methods for in vitro multiplication of Uapaca kirkiana plant materials from mature stock plants. The efficacy of sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl), calcium hypochlorite {Ca(OCl 2) 2 } or mercuric chloride (HgCl 2) as surface sterilant was evaluated in decontaminating explants excised from grafted and field-collected U. kirkiana trees. Different Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium supplements were evaluated for shoot multiplication and root regeneration. Results indicated that preconditioning grafted U. kirkiana trees before excising explants and decontaminating explants in 0. 1 % w/v HgCl 2 were effective methods in establishing aseptic cultures (80 %). Lateral shoots (new shoots) responded positively to shoot multiplication on strength MS medium supplemented with a combination of 0. 1 mg/L benzylaminopurine, 0. 04 mg/L naphthaleneacetic acid and 0. 3 mg/L casein hydrolysate.

40|$|In vitro {{adventitious}} shoot formation {{was initiated}} from bulb and leaf explants of Haemanthus deformis, H. humilis, and H. albiflos. The initiation medium used was Murashige and Skoog (MS) without plant growth regulators, although shoots and callus were later subcultured onto MS medium containing 2 mg 1 − 1 kinetin and 1 mg 1 − 1 IAA, which stimulated shoot and root development, {{especially from the}} callus. H. humilis was the first species to initiate shoots from bulb explants, with 76 % direct organogenesis. H. deformis had 20 % shoot and root formation from bulb explants and 30 % shoot formation from leaf explants. H. albiflos produced 50 % shoot formation from leaf explants and the callus developed numerous shoots once placed on medium with growth regulators. On average it took 18 – 20 weeks from shoot initiation to obtain plantlets ready to be acclimatised. Leaf explants in general took longer to initiate shoots, although they produced more shoots per explant, and also had less contamination compared to the bulb explants.
