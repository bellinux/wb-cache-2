2500|$|Noddings {{describes}} wrong {{actions in}} terms of [...] "a diminishment of the ethical ideal" [...] and [...] "evil". A person's ethical ideal is diminished when she either chooses or is forced {{to act in a}} way that rejects her internal call to care. In effect, her image of the best person it is possible for her to be is altered in a way that lowers her ideal. According to Noddings, people and organizations can deliberately or carelessly contribute to the diminishment of other's ethical ideals. They may do this by teaching people not to care, or by placing them in conditions that prevent them from being able to care (1984, 116-119). A person is evil if, in spite of her ability to do otherwise, she either fails to personally care for someone, or prevents others from caring. Noddings writes, [...] " [...] one intentionally rejects the impulse to care and deliberately turns <b>her</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ethical, she is evil, and this evil cannot be redeemed" [...] (1984, 115).|$|E

2500|$|In November 1998, Westbrook {{revealed}} to Hello! magazine {{that she was}} [...] "desperate" [...] to return to EastEnders, because she {{was in need of}} the money. According to Westbrook, actors Mike Reid and Barbara Windsor who both appeared as Frank and Peggy Butcher were keen to have <b>her</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> cast too. [...] Her plea came at a time when executive producer Matthew Robinson had already considered bringing Sam back, but because of Westbrook's past problems, he wanted to recast the role to another actress. However, the BBC's [...] "Controller of Continuing Drama Series", Mal Young, thought they were judging Westbrook unfairly, believing a lot of the stories printed about her in the tabloid press. On his say so, Westbrook was offered another contract to reprise the role of Sam. In May 1999, Westbrook said, [...] "It's my dream come true. Sam is a great character and I'm thrilled to be given another chance to play her. The storyline is excellent and I think it's safe to say there'll be a few family fireworks once I'm back in town."

Riegel left the role and returned several times, before permanently retiring from the role in 2010. [...] She attributed her 2008 return to the wishes of her fans.
