We investigated {{the influence of the}} different atomization parameters on the size and size distribution of the <b>sprayed</b> <b>emulsion</b> and defined rules for the choice of conditions which will make it possible to maintain a specific emulsion size. Oil-in-water emulsions were prepared with different aqueous phase viscosity, oil fraction, and emulsion droplet size and sprayed with two different atomization systems: a two-fluid nozzle with external mixing and a rotary atomizer. For both systems, two different breakup regimes were identified: (1) monomodal and (2) bimodal distribution breakup; and a critical Capillary number was determined for each breakup regime. These findings can be used to predict oil droplet breakup and define the right atomization conditions and/or emulsion formulation for controlling <b>sprayed</b> <b>emulsion</b> structure in microencapsulation applications...|$|R

40|$|Cubosomes are {{dispersed}} nanostructured {{particles of}} cubic phase liquid crystal that have stimulated significant research interest {{because of their}} potential for application in controlled-release and drug delivery. Despite the interest, cubosomes {{can be difficult to}} fabricate and stabilize with current methods. Most of the current work is limited to liquid phase processes involving high shear dispersion of bulk cubic liquid crystalline material into sub-micron particles, limiting application flexibility. In this work, two types of dry powder cubosome precursors are produced by spray-drying: (1) starch-encapsulated monoolein is produced by spray-drying a dispersion of cubic liquid crystalline particles in an aqueous starch solution and (2) dextran-encapsulated monoolein is produced by spray-drying an emulsion formed by the ethanol–dextran–monoolein–water system. The encapsulants are used to decrease powder cohesion during drying and to act as a soluble colloidal stabilizer upon hydration of the powders. Both powders are shown to form (on average) 0. 6 µm colloidally-stable cubosomes upon addition to water. However, the starch powders have a broader particle size distribution than the dextran powders because of the relative ease of <b>spraying</b> <b>emulsions</b> versus dispersions. The developed processes enable the production of nanostructured cubosomes by end-users rather than just specialized researchers and allow tailoring of the surface state of the cubosomes for broader application...|$|R

Microencapsulation of omega- 3 oils minimizes oxidative deterioration and allows {{their use in}} stable and easy-to-handle form. Microencapsulation of omega- 3 fatty acids {{can be achieved by}} using a variety of methods, with the two most commonly used commercial processes being complex coacervation and <b>spray</b> dried <b>emulsions.</b> A variety of other methods are in development including spray chilling, extrusion coating and liposome entrapment.

In particular, we discuss the method of complex coacervation, including its benefits and limitations. This review highlights the need for research on the fundamentals of interfacial and complexation behaviour of various proteins, gums and polyphenols to encapsulate and deliver omega- 3 fatty acids, particularly with regard to broadening the range of shell materials {{that can be used in}} complex coacervation of omega- 3 rich oils...|$|R

40|$|This project {{endeavored}} to expand experimental data on erosion control blankets and develop {{greater understanding of}} how blankets and erosion principles interact. Blankets that are effective in reducing raindrop impact may become ineffective in controlling soil detachment and runoff (rill erosion) on longer slopes. This field study of erosion control products under artificial rainfall conditions was conducted at the Highway 10 overpass in Coon Rapids, Minnesota. Examining long slope lengths (60 feet and 100 feet), bare soil erosion was compared to erosion under straw blankets, wood fiber blankets, straw mulch, and <b>sprayed</b> <b>emulsion.</b> Measurements of runoff, erosion, and biomass (vegetative growth) were made in spring and fall under wet and dry conditions. Sediment loads for bare soil were 8 times larger than other treatments. Sediment loads were substantially smaller for the fall runs than the spring runs, {{largely due to the}} substantially increased vegetative cover (biomass). Shear stress partitioning for erosion control blankets was evaluated using a laboratory flume and hot-film anemometry. Erosion control blankets partition shear stress into form shear (the portion that acts on the blanket) and particle shear (the portion that acts on the soil particles). Blanket type, flow conditions, and fastener impacts were considered. Shear partitioning was found to be an important process in design and erosion modeling. Attempts were made to correlate sediment load and vegetative density data gathered by Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) with manufacturer's information on blanket characteristics.

Confocal micrograph showed cohesive cross-linked whey protein film present at the oil-water interface and at the powder surface stabilising the oil powder particles containing 95. 3 wt% oil. The mean droplet size of parent emulsion (0. 21, 0. 38, 0. 76, 2. 31 μm) significantly influenced the mechanical stability of the resulting oil powder in terms of oil leakage (2. 73, 0. 93, 4. 1, 7. 54 wt%) upon compaction.

Strong correlations existed between the mechanical properties of the oil powder and the oxidative stability over 5 months. The kinetics of oxidation of oil powder was higher than that of corresponding bulk oil with or without added antioxidants as evidenced by evolution of primary oxidation products (hydroperoxides) and secondary oxidation products (hexanal).

40|$|Based on the {{structure}} of the cell wall, bacteria are divided into Gram-positive and Gram-negative. While the cell wall of Gram-positive bacteria is thick, the cell wall of Gram-negatives is very thin and surrounded by an outer membrane with LPS. Previous studies have shown that Gram-positive bacteria induce much more IL- 12, TNF and IFN-γ from human peripheral mononuclear cells (PBMC) than do Gram-negatives, which instead induce more IL- 6, IL- 8 and IL- 10 than do Gram-positive bacteria. In this thesis we confirm this cytokine pattern and show that the capacity of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria to induce these distinct cytokine profiles is independent of their taxonomic relatedness. One exception from this general pattern was Listeria monocytogenes, which was a poor inducer of IL- 12, TNF and IFN-γ despite being Gram-positive. Since an intricate interplay between IL- 12, TNF and IFN-γ results in enhanced killing capacity of macrophages, these cytokines are recognized as phagocyte-activating cytokines. Another striking exception was Streptococcus pneumoniae, which induced no IL- 12 despite its close relation to the viridans streptococci, which induced high levels. Aging pneumococci decompose due to the action of autolysin. We show that autolyzed pneumococci induce very little IL- 12, TNF and IFN-γ and also inhibit the production of phagocyte-activating cytokines in response to intact bacteria. Further, fragments partly blocked phagocytosis of intact pneumococci. Thus, fragments generated by autolysin may paralyse phagocyte defenses and contribute to virulence. To investigate the response to Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial infection, middle ear fluid was collected from children with acute otitis media (AOM) and from children with long-standing secretory otitis media (SOM). In SOM, Gram-negative bacteria were more prevalent than in AOM. Further, fluids with no cultureable bacteria were often positive by PCR in SOM, but not in AOM. This suggests that bacterial DNA is eliminated soon after killing of bacteria in AOM but not in SOM, or that bacteria remain dormant in the middle ear cavity of the SOM patients. The levels of inflammatory mediators in the fluids did not relate to the etiological agent. Instead, most cytokines, especially IL- 1 β, were highly elevated in middle ear fluids containing live, cultureable bacteria compared to negative fluids, even if microbial DNA could be detected by PCR. In contrast, high levels of IL- 6 and PGE 2 were measured also in AOM fluids with no detectable bacteria, and might be important in the resolution phase of the infection. Nasal spray treatment with viridans streptococci and lactobacilli were tested as a method to speed up resolution of SOM in a placebo controlled double blind pilot study. One third of children sprayed with viridans streptococci showed significant clinical improvement, while treatment with lactobacilli was less effective. Clinical recovery was not associated with changes in the nasopharyngeal flora, or the expression of inflammatory mediators in nasopharynx or in the middle <b>ear.</b> <b>Spray</b> treatment with viridans streptococci could be an alternative to surgery due to SOM, but the mechanism of the beneficial effects remains to be elucidated...|$|R
40|$|The main aim in {{the drug}} therapy of any disease is to attain the desired {{therapeutic}} concentration of the drug in plasma or {{at the site of}} action and maintain it for the entire duration of treatment. A drug on being used in conventional dosage forms leads to unavoidable fluctuations {{in the drug}} concentration leading to under medication or overmedication and increased frequency of dose administration as well as poor patient compliance. To minimize drug degradation and loss, to prevent harmful side effects and to increase drug bioavailability various drug delivery and drug targeting systems are currently under development. Handling the treatment of severe disease conditions has necessitated the development of innovative ideas to modify drug delivery techniques. Drug targeting means delivery of the drug-loaded system to the site of interest. Drug carrier systems include polymers, micelles, microcapsules, liposomes and lipoproteins to name some. Different polymer carriers exert different effects on drug delivery. Synthetic polymers are usually non-biocompatible, non-biodegradable and expensive. Natural polymers such as chitin and chitosan are devoid of such problems. Chitosan comes from the deacetylation of chitin, a natural biopolymer originating from crustacean shells. Chitosan is a biocompatible, biodegradable, and nontoxic natural polymer with excellent film-forming ability. Being of cationic character, chitosan is able to react with polyanions giving rise to polyelectrolyte complexes. Hence chitosan has become a promising natural polymer for the preparation of microspheres/nanospheres and microcapsules. The techniques employed to microencapsulate with chitosan include ionotropic gelation, <b>spray</b> drying, <b>emulsion</b> phase separation, simple and complex coacervation. This review focuses on the preparation, characterization of chitosan microspheres and their role in novel drug delivery systems...|$|R
