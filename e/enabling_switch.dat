40|$|A new mixed {{procedure}} for solving {{the system of}} algebraic equations generated by the edge finite elements method (EFEM) for ungauged vector potential formulation is proposed. The signularity of the matrix of the system obtained by ungauged vector for mlation results in unstable and nonuniform convergence rates of the Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient (PCG) iteration procedure.

The key focus is on the factors <b>enabling</b> <b>switch</b> between the reprogramming stages. It is concluded that one of the key barriers for iPSC applications is the multi-stage nature of somatic cells reprogramming that features both stochastic early phases and deterministic establishment of pluripotent regulatory network. Despite thousands of scientific studies, various reprogramming protocols restrict effective research analysis and identification of molecular reprogramming mechanisms. In order to specify accurate reprogramming algorithms and develop more effective protocols of patient specific reprogrammed cells cultivation, the future researches require focus on the phase transition switchers...|$|E
40|$|The {{concept of}} SDN {{has emerged as}} a way to address {{numerous}} challenges with traditional network architectures by decoupling network control and forwarding. So far, the use cases for SDN mainly targeted data-center applications. This article considers SDN for network carriers, facing operation of large-scale networks with millions of customers, multiple technologies, and high availability demands. With specific carrier-grade features such as scalability, reliability, flexibility, modularity, and virtualization in mind, the SPARC EU project has developed the SPARC SplitArchitecture concept. The SplitArchitecture control plane allows hierarchical layering of several control plane layers which can be flexibly mapped to data plane layers. Between control layers open interfaces are used. Furthermore, SplitArchitecture proposes an additional split of forwarding and processing functions in data path elements, <b>enabling</b> <b>switch</b> based OAM functionality and handling of tunneling techniques. The SplitArchitecture concept is evaluated in a prototype demonstrating an SDN version of BRAS: the floating BRAS. The floating BRAS allows creation of residential Internet access services with dynamically managed BRAS instances. The demo is based on a controller enabling protected MPLS transport connections spanning SDN-controlled aggregation and IP/MPLS-based core domains. The prototype showcases how SplitArchitecture enables virtualization of service nodes in an SDN-controlled network, leading to increased flexibility in configuration and placement of service creation functions. Overall, the results show that it is technically and economically beneficial to apply SDN, and specifically the SplitArchitecture concept, to the carrier domain.
