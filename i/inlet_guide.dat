The stationary airfoils, also known as stators or vanes, decelerate and redirect the flow direction of the fluid, preparing it for the rotor blades of the next stage. Axial compressors are almost always multi-staged, with the cross-sectional area of the gas passage diminishing along the compressor to maintain an optimum axial Mach number. Beyond about 5 stages or a 4:1 design pressure ratio a compressor will not function unless fitted with features such as stationary vanes with variable angles (known as variable <b>inlet</b> <b>guide</b> vanes and variable stators), the ability to allow some air to escape part-way along the compressor (known as interstage bleed) and being split into more than one rotating assembly (known as twin spools, for example).|$|E

To achieve this, the initial design used a low-pressure (LP) axial compressor and a high-pressure (HP) centrifugal compressor, each being driven by its own single-stage turbine.

To deal with this, design from scratch {{is out of the}} question and de-signers often rely on their experience to design by scaling or modification. A compressor designer’s wish is to have one single stage unit design with good performance that can cover a wide rang of applications and a wide range of mass flow rates. This means a stage whose impeller and diffuser chocking areas can be varied, which is not impossible but difficult. Currently there are five main ways of dealing with this: 1. Varying the angle of the <b>inlet</b> <b>guides</b> (if guide vanes are there) 2. Narrowing the impeller flow passage depth (impeller exit width trimming) 3.

40|$|Most of {{the current}} {{industrial}} gas turbine systems are designed to operate with conventional fossil fuels. Recently, the use of Low Calorific Value (LCV) fuels gained interest, particularly, Hydrogen rich Syngas resulting from coal and solid waste gasification. When LCV fuels are used the performance and behavior of the engines could significantly change and modifications may be needed. For instance, due to the relatively low heating value the {{fuel mass flow rate}} will be much higher than natural gas, increasing substantially the mass flow through the turbine. This leads to a decrease of demand for air from the compressor, which results in increased back pressure, reduction of stall margin and possible compressor instability. This paper presents a preliminary study to pave the way to the design of a 300 MW industrial gas turbine?s compressor with the objective of operating efficiently with Hydrogen rich syngas, while maintaining the flexibility for a quick switch to natural gas in the event of gasifier failure or breakdown of feedstock supply. NASA Rotor 37 is used as the test vehicle to provide design concepts because of its simplicity in being a single stage compressor and the availability of experimental data for the CFD model validation. Geometric modifications were performed on the rotor to shift the working line towards an estimated lower air mass flow rate working line. Further modifications were investigated {{in order to maintain the}} design point compressor efficiency primarily based on sweep and lean of the blade. Once the new working line geometry was obtained, <b>inlet</b> variable <b>guide</b> vane (IGV) effects were explored to allow the compressor to shift to the original working line without further changes to the blade shape...|$|R

The {{influence of}} bend curvature is assessed. Moreover, the effect of the presence, the number and the spacing of guide vanes is investigated. Two turbulence models are evaluated in the numerical simulations. Bends with a weak curvature and guide vanes are found to perform best in preserving a uniform velocity <b>inlet</b> profile. Comparing <b>guide</b> vanes with equal and variable spacing, the latter results in better flow uniformity in the centre of the duct, downstream of the bend, but not at the outside.

50|$|Jet {{aircraft}} {{generate a}} lot of noise, contributing to noise pollution near airports. In modern high-bypass turbofan engines, the fan mounted afore the jet engine core is very large. The bigger the fan {{in comparison to the}} jet core, the more effective the bypass air is in enveloping the jet exhaust {{at the rear of the}} engine, reducing noise. The larger turbines needed to spin the large fan slow the jet exhaust, which also reduces noise. A hush kit produces a similar effect, using several modifications to the existing engine. Primarily, a device called a multilobe exhaust mixer on the rear of the engine mixes the exhaust gases of the jet core with the surrounding air and the small amount of bypass air available. Similar systems are also employed on many modern turbofan engines as standard equipment to further reduce noise. Most kits also make further modifications to the exhaust with acoustically treated tailpipes, revised <b>inlet</b> nacelles and <b>guide</b> vanes, all of which reduce forward propagating high-pitched noise caused by the small, high-speed fan.|$|R
40|$|To {{explore the}} {{influence}} of tip clearance on pressure fluctuation in a low specific speed mixed-flow pump, tip clearances δ of 0. 25 mm, 0. 75 mm and 1. 00 mm, along with no tip clearance, were selected. The reliability of the simulation was verified by comparison with the experimental data of external characteristics and fluctuation in the guide vane passage. Through ANSYS-CFX, MATLAB code and fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm, pressure fluctuation characteristics in this pump were obtained. The results show that pressure fluctuation exists in all conditions due to the rotor-stator interaction. Under the no tip clearance and tip clearance conditions, the maximum fluctuation value was located near the <b>guide</b> <b>inlet</b> and impeller outlet, respectively. Clearance leakage had less influence on pressure fluctuation at the impeller inlet and central regions within a certain range of the clearance; beyond this range, fluctuations in the whole flow passage increased significantly, while the clearance variation had less effect on fluctuation in the guide vane. When the tip clearance value was 1. 00 mm, pressure fluctuation of the shroud at the impeller inlet section suddenly increases, which was closely related to the obvious leakage vortexes and a larger low pressure area...|$|R

One of the concepts proposed to reduce sonic boom incorporates a high-flow secondary nacelle bypass to enclose the engine and its protrusions where the flow is diverted around a gearbox {{through a set of}} <b>inlet</b> and exit <b>guide</b> vanes. To assess the flow quality within the bypass, computational studies are conducted using traditional RANS-based methods. Three levels of geometric complexity are considered—including the full engine, only the aft vane sections, and only one channel from the aft section—to evaluate global and local flow characteristics and to evaluate the influence of different turbulence models on the flow solutions. The aft vane calculations were conducted in “clean” and “vaned” configurations which correspond to experimental models whose data were used for validation purposes. Comparisons between the full engine and detailed single channel calculations show a weak dependence on the turbulence model used for the mean flow predictions as well as strong turbulence-shock interactions. The clean and vaned aft bypass sections exhibit reasonable agreement with the experimental data but show a stronger influence of the turbulence model on predictive accuracy due to a laminar-turbulent transition affecting the inflow velocity profile...|$|R
