5|$|Alkali metals form <b>ionic</b> {{and highly}} soluble monofluorides; these have the cubic {{arrangement}} of sodium chloride and analogous chlorides. Alkaline earth difluorides possess strong <b>ionic</b> bonds but are insoluble in water, {{with the exception}} of beryllium difluoride, which also exhibits some covalent character and has a quartz-like structure. Rare earth elements and many other metals form mostly <b>ionic</b> trifluorides.|$|E
5|$|Although <b>ionic</b> {{compounds}} contain charged atoms or clusters, {{these materials}} do not typically conduct electricity to any significant extent when the substance is solid. In order to conduct, the charged particles must be mobile rather than stationary in a crystal lattice. This is achieved {{to some degree}} at high temperatures when the defect concentration increases the <b>ionic</b> mobility and solid state <b>ionic</b> conductivity is observed. When the <b>ionic</b> compounds are dissolved in a liquid or are melted into a liquid, they can conduct electricity because the ions become completely mobile. This conductivity gain upon dissolving or melting is sometimes used as a defining characteristic of <b>ionic</b> compounds.|$|E
5|$|Electrostatic forces between {{particles}} are strongest when {{the charges are}} high, and {{the distance between the}} nuclei of the ions is small. In such cases, the compounds generally have very high melting and boiling points and a low vapour pressure. Trends in melting points can be even better explained when the structure and <b>ionic</b> size ratio is taken into account. Above their melting point <b>ionic</b> solids melt and become molten salts (although some <b>ionic</b> compounds such as aluminium chloride and iron(III) chloride show molecule-like structures in the liquid phase). Inorganic compounds with simple ions typically have small ions, and thus have high melting points, so are solids at room temperature. Some substances with larger ions, however, have a melting point below or near room temperature (often defined as up to 100°C), and are termed <b>ionic</b> liquids. Ions in <b>ionic</b> liquids often have uneven charge distributions, or bulky substituents like hydrocarbon chains, which also play a role in determining the strength of the interactions and propensity to melt.|$|E

5|$|If the {{electronic}} {{structure of the}} two interacting bodies {{is affected by the}} presence of one another, covalent interactions (non-ionic) also contribute to the overall energy of the compound formed. <b>Ionic</b> compounds are rarely purely <b>ionic,</b> i.e. held together only by electrostatic forces. The bonds between even the most electronegative/electropositive pairs such as those in caesium fluoride exhibit a small degree of covalency. Conversely, covalent bonds between unlike atoms often exhibit some charge separation and can be considered to have a partial <b>ionic</b> character. The circumstances under which a compound will have <b>ionic</b> or covalent character can typically be understood using Fajans' rules, which use only charges and the sizes of each ion. According to these rules, compounds with the most <b>ionic</b> character will have large positive ions with a low charge, bonded to a small negative ion with a high charge. More generally HSAB theory can be applied, whereby the compounds with the most <b>ionic</b> character are those consisting of hard acids and hard bases: small, highly charged ions with a high difference in electronegativities between the anion and cation. This difference in electronegativities means that the charge separation, and resulting dipole moment, is maintained even when the ions are in contact (the excess electrons on the anions are not transferred or polarized to neutralize the cations).|$|E
5|$|In {{some unusual}} <b>ionic</b> compounds: fast ion conductors, and <b>ionic</b> glasses, {{one or more}} of the <b>ionic</b> {{components}} has a significant mobility, allowing conductivity even while the material as a whole remains solid. This is often highly temperature dependant, and may be the result of either a phase change or a high defect concentration. These materials are used in all solid-state supercapacitors, batteries, and fuel cells, and in various kinds of chemical sensors.|$|E
5|$|<b>Ionic</b> {{compounds}} can {{be produced}} from their constituent ions by evaporation, precipitation, or freezing.

5|$|<b>Ionic</b> {{compounds}} containing hydrogen ions (H+) {{are classified}} as acids, and those containing basic ions hydroxide (OH−) or oxide (O2−) {{are classified as}} bases. <b>Ionic</b> compounds without these ions are also known as salts and can be formed by acid–base reactions. <b>Ionic</b> compounds can also be produced from their constituent ions by evaporation of their solvent, precipitation, freezing, a solid-state reaction, or the electron transfer reaction of reactive metals with reactive non-metals, such as halogen gases.|$|E

5|$|Soluble <b>ionic</b> {{compounds}} like salt {{can easily}} be dissolved to provide electrolyte solutions. This is {{a simple way to}} control the concentration and <b>ionic</b> strength. The concentration of solutes affects many colligative properties, including increasing the osmotic pressure, and causing freezing-point depression and boiling-point elevation. Because the solutes are charged ions they also increase the electrical conductivity of the solution. The increased <b>ionic</b> strength reduces the thickness of the electrical double layer around colloidal particles, and therefore the stability of emulsions and suspensions.|$|E

5|$|A {{mendelevium}} atom has 101 electrons, {{of which}} at least three (and perhaps four) can act as valence electrons. They {{are expected to be}} arranged in the configuration 5f137s2 (ground state term symbol 2F7/2), although experimental verification of this electron configuration had not yet been made as of 2006. In forming compounds, three valence electrons may be lost, leaving behind a 5f12 core: this conforms to the trend set by the other actinides with their 5fn electron configurations in the tripositive state. The first ionization potential of mendelevium was measured to be at most (6.58±0.07)eV in 1974, {{based on the assumption that}} the 7s electrons would ionize before the 5f ones; this value has since not yet been refined further due to mendelevium's scarcity and high radioactivity. The <b>ionic</b> radius of hexacoordinate Md3+ had been preliminarily estimated in 1978 to be around 91.2pm; 1988 calculations based on the logarithmic trend between distribution coefficients and <b>ionic</b> radius produced a value of 89.6pm, as well as an enthalpy of hydration of −(3654±12)kJ·mol−1.
