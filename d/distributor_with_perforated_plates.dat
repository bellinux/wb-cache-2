Experiments {{were conducted in}} Tianjin to study the thermal and dynamic performance of the collectors in cold and severe cold regions. A chamber with a PID (Proportion Integration Differentiation) temperature controller was designed to control the inlet air temperature of the three collectors. Effects of radiation intensity, inlet air temperature, and flow rate on the thermal efficiency and outlet air temperature were experimentally studied. The {{results indicated that the}} thermal efficiency of the three collectors in severe cold regions could be much higher than 50 % and the collector <b>with</b> <b>perforating</b> corrugated <b>plate</b> had the highest thermal efficiency.

40|$|In this study, a {{new method}} was {{developed}} to simulate the flow characteristics of Geldart A particles in the bubbling fluidized beds <b>with</b> <b>perforated</b> <b>plates</b> by the modified structure-based drag model. In this approach, the baffle was considered as a gas distributor and the baffled bubbling fluidized bed was divided into several sections which were treated {{as a series of}} freely bubbling fluidized beds. These freely bubbling fluidized beds were simulated by the structure-based drag model. Due to the structure difference between the baffle and the distributor, the empirical correlation of the initial bubble diameter in the structure-based drag model was modified to adapt the simulation of these freely bubbling fluidized beds. By this modification, the bubbling fluidization behavior and the bed expansion in a bubbling fluidized bed <b>with</b> <b>perforated</b> <b>plates</b> can be correctly predicted. The simulation results showed good agreements with the experimental data of the radial and axial solid volume fraction distributions and the axial pressure distribution. The phenomenon that baffles restrained back-mixing of particles was captured in the solid circulation pattern as well. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe brick infill walls {{cease to}} {{contribute}} to the lateral strength and stiffness of a structure as soon as they fail in a brittle manner {{in the early stages of}} an earthquake. Recent studies indicated that the <b>perforated</b> steel <b>plates</b> externally bonded to both faces of a wall lead to two benefits. First, the increase in the lateral strengths and rigidities of the walls increase the overall lateral strength and stiffness of the structure. Secondly, the increase in the ductilities of the walls allows the walls to absorb higher amounts of the earthquake-induced energy before failure so that smaller amounts of energy are required to be absorbed by the bearing structural members. The present study is dedicated to investigate the efficiency of this technique on the behavior of brick walls under out-of-plane bending moments, induced by the blast effect of an explosion or pressure from the soil, wind or snow next to the wall. A brick wall strengthened <b>with</b> <b>perforated</b> steel <b>plates</b> and a brick wall strengthened <b>with</b> <b>perforated</b> steel <b>plates</b> and steel strips on both faces were subjected to four-point bending.

Lack of the space in many diesel vehicles, however, make it difficult to design and install stand-alone catalytic converters such as DOC, DPF, and SCR in the vehicle exhaust systems.

40|$|Problem statement: Noise {{control was}} one of the major {{requirements}} to improve the living environment. One of the methods to do that is provided by sound absorber. Commonly, multi-layer sound absorbers are applied to absorb broadband noise that was composed of <b>perforated</b> <b>plates,</b> air space and porous material. However, multi-layers sound absorbers effectiveness depends on their construction. This study was conducted to investigate the potential of using coconut coir fiber as sound absorber. The effects of porous layer backing and <b>perforated</b> <b>plate</b> on sound absorption coefficient of sound absorber using coconut coir fiber were studied. Approach: Car boot liners made from woven cotton cloth were used as type of porous layer in the study. This material has been used widely in automotive industry. <b>Perforated</b> <b>plate</b> used was machined with perforation ratio of 0. 20, thickness of 1 mm and holed diameter of 2 mm. The samples were tested at the acoustic lab of the Faculty of Engineering and Built Environment, University Kebangsaan Malaysia, according to ASTM E 1050 - 98 international standards for noise absorption coefficient. Results: The experiment data indicates that porous layer backing can improve noise absorption coefficient at low and high frequencies with significant increasing. 20 mm thick layer coconut coir fiber with porous layer backing exhibit peak value at frequencies between 2750 - 2825 Hz with maximum value of 0. 97. The experimental results also found that the coconut coir fiber <b>with</b> <b>perforated</b> <b>plate</b> gives higher value for lower frequencies range from 600 - 2400 Hz. The optimum value for coconut coir fiber <b>with</b> <b>perforated</b> panel is around 0. 94 - 0. 95 for the frequency range 2600 - 2700 Hz. Conclusion: Noise absorption coefficient of coconut coir fiber was increased at all frequency when they were backing with Woven Cotton Cloth (WCC). At low frequency, the NAC have significant increasing. This is because WCC have higher flow resistivity than coconut coir fibers, so that sound can be dissipated as it travels through material significantly. The results from the experimental tests show that it has good acoustic properties at low and high frequencies and can used to be an alternative replacement of synthetic based commercial product. By using the porous layer and <b>perforated</b> <b>plate</b> backing to coconut coir fiber, the sound absorber panel shows a good potential to be an environmentally friendly product.
