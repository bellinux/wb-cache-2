5|$|After the Cuban Revolution of 1959, a {{representative}} of the Fidel Castro government asked Árbenz to come to Cuba, to which he readily agreed, sensing an opportunity to live with fewer restrictions on himself.

His presence so close to Guatemala once again increased the negative coverage he received in the Guatemalan press. He was offered the leadership of some revolutionary movements in Guatemala but refused, as he was pessimistic about the outcome.|$|E
5|$|Bahá'u'lláh {{prohibited}} a mendicant and ascetic lifestyle. Monasticism is forbidden, and Bahá'ís {{are taught}} to practice spirituality while engaging in useful work.

After renouncing Parham, the severely weakened AFM regrouped around Howard A. Goss, L. C. Hall, D. C. O. Opperman, and A. G. Canada. They were later joined by Eudorus N. Bell, previously a Southern Baptist minister. The AFM had its strength in the rural areas of Kansas, Texas, Arkansas, Oklahoma, and Missouri.|$|E
