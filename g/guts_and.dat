5|$|Cestodes have no mouths or <b>guts,</b> <b>and</b> the syncitial skin absorbs {{nutrients}} – mainly {{carbohydrates and}} amino acids – from the host, and also disguises it chemically to avoid attacks by the host's immune system. Shortage of carbohydrates in the host's diet stunts {{the growth of}} the parasites and kills some. Their metabolisms generally use simple but inefficient chemical processes, and they compensate by consuming large amounts of food relative to their size.|$|E
5|$|The team of <b>Guts</b> <b>and</b> Glory, {{consisting}} of Lex Luger, Adam Bomb, Mabel, and The Smoking Gunns (Billy and Bart Gunn), faced The Million Dollar Team, {{made up of}} Tatanka, Bam Bam Bigelow, King Kong Bundy, and The Heavenly Bodies (Tom Prichard and Jimmy Del Ray) in the next match. <b>Guts</b> <b>and</b> Glory took the early lead when Mabel pinned Prichard after performing a crossbody from the second rope. Mabel fought Bundy and Bigelow, but he was counted out after clotheslining Bigelow out of the ring. Bigelow then performed a moonsault on Bomb and got a pinfall. Luger and Del Ray fought back and forth until Luger performed a running forearm smash on Del Ray to get the pinfall. The Smokin' Gunns were eliminated next, as Tatanka pinned Bart and Bundy pinned Billy. Luger fought back by pinning Tatanka with a small package. Seven seconds later, Bundy pinned Luger after performing a splash to get the victory. Bundy, Bigelow, and Tatanka continued to attack Luger after the match until Luger's team returned to the ring to save him.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} tetrapods, the gastralia and ribs with uncinate processes, {{together}} with bony {{elements such as}} bony plates in the skin (osteoderms) and clavicles (collar bone), would have formed a sort of exoskeleton around the body, protecting the belly and helping to hold in the <b>guts</b> <b>and</b> inner organs. These anatomical details most likely evolved from structures involved in locomotion even before the vertebrates ventured onto land. The gastralia {{may have been involved}} in the breathing process in early amphibians and reptiles. The pelvis and shoulder girdles are arranged differently from those of lizards, as is the case with other parts of the internal anatomy and its scales.|$|E

50|$|The {{differentiation}} of the <b>gut</b> <b>and</b> its derivatives depends upon reciprocal {{interactions between the}} <b>gut</b> endoderm (epithelium) <b>and</b> its surrounding mesoderm (an epithelial-mesenchymal interaction). Hox genes in the mesoderm are induced by SHH secreted by <b>gut</b> endoderm <b>and</b> regulate the craniocaudal organization of the <b>gut</b> <b>and</b> its derivatives. Once the mesoderm is specified by this code, it instructs the endoderm to form components of the mid- and hindgut regions, such as the small intestine, caecum, colon, and cloaca.|$|R

Doink the Clown teamed with three midgets to form Clowns R' Us in a match against The Royal Family, composed of Jerry Lawler and three midgets. The Royal Family won the match, but all seven other competitors attacked Lawler after the match. Lex Luger led <b>Guts</b> <b>and</b> Glory against the Million Dollar Corporation team, which was managed by Ted DiBiase. DiBiase's team won after Luger, the last wrestler from his team, was pinned.|$|E

25|$|The process uses a {{mixed culture}} of {{naturally}} occurring microorganisms found in natural habitats {{such as the}} rumen of cattle, termite <b>guts,</b> <b>and</b> marine and terrestrial swamps to anaerobically digest biomass into a mixture of carboxylic acids produced during the acidogenic and acetogenic stages of anaerobic digestion, however with the inhibition of the methanogenic final stage. The more popular methods for production of ethanol and cellulosic ethanol use enzymes that must be isolated first {{to be added to}} the biomass and thus convert the starch or cellulose into simple sugars, followed then by yeast fermentation into ethanol. This process does not need the addition of such enzymes as these microorganisms make their own.|$|E

John J. Puccio of DVD Town remarked that the extra footage contained [...] "a few more shots of blood, gore, <b>guts,</b> <b>and</b> slime to spice things up...and tiny bits of connecting matter to help us follow the story line better, but none of it amounts to much." [...] The film {{was released on}} Blu-ray Disc in North America on 23 January 2007.|$|E

History Today editor Paul Lay called the idea [...] "frightening". Historian and Labour Party MP Tristram Hunt, while admitting {{that he had not}} yet actually seen the programme, voiced his concerns that the show's content was not [...] "challenging and stimulating" [...] enough for the BBC, adding that [...] "For children, Horrible Histories is an exciting aid to engage with the <b>guts</b> <b>and</b> gore of the past, but there are more sophisticated, populist ways of getting people involved in history than this.

500|$|The New York Post's Kyle Smith said Nispel made {{no attempt}} to create a movie beyond blood and <b>guts,</b> <b>and</b> even those {{attempts}} were [...] "forgettable". Smith said that apart from Clay and Trent, the rest of the cast were merely [...] "faces in the crowd" [...] with no attempt to give them any sort of backstory. USA Todays Claudia Puig said that the film keeps to the same formula as its predecessors, with a story that adds little to nothing to the franchise. She also said Padalecki and Panabaker filled their lead roles well, and that Aaron Yoo's comic relief {{made him one of the}} most likable characters on screen. Rob Nelson of Variety also praised Panabaker and Yoo's performances.|$|E
500|$|Derek Elley of Variety found The Hurt Locker to be [...] "gripping" [...] as {{a thriller}} but {{felt that the}} film was {{weakened}} by, [...] "its fuzzy (and hardly original) psychology." [...] Elley wrote that it was unclear {{to know where the}} drama lay: [...] "These guys get by on old-fashioned <b>guts</b> <b>and</b> instinct rather than sissy hardware—but it's not a pure men-under-stress drama either." [...] The critic also felt that the script showed [...] "signs of artificially straining for character depth." [...] Anne Thompson, also writing for Variety, believed The Hurt Locker to be a contender for Best Picture, particularly based on the unique subject matter pursued by a female director and on being an exception to other films about the Iraq War, which had performed poorly.|$|E

500|$|After {{the shoot}} at Fox Baja Studios wrapped, Harlin insisted the team go to The Bahamas to shoot with real sharks. Recounting his {{experience}} there, actor Thomas Jane, who played shark wrangler Carter, said, [...] "The first day, I {{was in a}} cage, but the next day, they swam me 30 feet down... Then this guy yanks the breather off me and the water's churning with blood and <b>guts</b> <b>and</b> stuff... It was so terrifying that I don't want to remember it." [...] The idea was to mix footage of real sharks with animatronic and computer generated sharks to ensure a seamless transition between them all. To distinguish Deep Blue Sea from Jaws, where the shark is frequently hidden, Harlin decided to show theirs more prominently because he felt that audience expectations had changed since then.|$|E

He tied an NFL record in a November 25 game against the Chicago Bears by scoring six touchdowns in a single game, a record he shares with Ernie Nevers (1929) and Gale Sayers (1965). The Browns finished the season with an 11–1 win-loss record and advanced to the championship game, but lost this time to the Rams. Jones came in second in the NFL in touchdowns scored and {{was named to the}} Pro Bowl, the league's all-star game. He was also selected by sportswriters as a first-team All-Pro. [...] "Dub has the speed, the <b>guts</b> <b>and</b> the know-how of a great player," [...] Paul Brown said at the time, calling him [...] "the most underrated player in the league." ...|$|E

Campling wrote of the Skipton show: [...] "The ability to laugh at itself is one of this country's finest attributes, but the Skipton mob were only too happy to celebrate their insularity." [...] Elisabeth Mahoney of The Guardian, who reviewed the Dartford episode, said: [...] "Going to a place and insulting it takes <b>guts</b> <b>and</b> careful strategies. Steel made use {{of the fact that he}} is from nearby Swanley, both to signal that he knows the area but also that – whatever he was about to say about Dartford – it was better than his hometown." [...] Another journalist, reviewing the Penzance episode in the North Devon Journal commented: [...] "Why do we like programmes that laugh at us? Because, I hope, we laugh at ourselves. We're not ignorant of our stereotypes. West Cornwall? Aaarrrrr!" ...|$|E
