The data set used in the study is reported as a contingency table of ceramics against contexts. But, as pottery is not intrinsically a <b>dating</b> <b>indicator</b> (a <b>date</b> is rarely inscribed on each piece of pottery), we estimate dates of contexts from their finds, and we use coins to attest the date of assemblages. The model-based approach uses classical tools (correspondence analysis, linear regression and resampling methods) in an iterative scheme. Archaeologists may find in the paper a useful set of known statistical methods, while statisticians can learn a way to order well known techniques.

40|$|Copyright © 2002 Elsevier B. V. All rights reservedStudies of past {{sea levels}} based on radiocarbon-dated field samples suffer {{variously}} from compilation {{of information from}} disparate locations and the imprecise nature of the <b>dated</b> <b>indicators.</b> Geographic segregation and systematic elimination of poor samples from time–depth data sets leads to improved interpretation of Holocene sea-level history. An example is presented from Southern Australia, where this is achieved through selection of higher-resolution palaeoenvironmental indicators, separation of transgressive from regressive populations, and geographic regionalisation of data. In Southern Australia, fossil sea-level indicators preserved in prograding coastal plain settings include seagrass, sandflat, mangrove, samphire and chenier ridge organo–sedimentary remains. These provide sea-level time–depth data points {{with a variety of}} elevational and dating errors. Preserved organic remains at the transition from Posidonia seagrass to intertidal sandflat environment, and from sandflat to Avicennia mangrove environment provide the most precise local data for tracing sea-level change. Time–depth plots of 233 <b>dated</b> sea-level <b>indicators</b> from South Australia generate a broad sea-level envelope tracing the Southern Australian transgression from 10, 000 to ca. 6000 radiocarbon years BP, followed by a more or less consistent level to the present. Finer details of sea-level behaviour are only apparent after systematic selection, separation and regionalisation of the data. The data indicate a very rapid sea-level rise in the early Holocene, at about 16 mm/year, reaching present levels at 6400 years BP. This was followed by regionally variable regression and emergence of the land of 1 – 3 m, a process that continues to the present. The systematic increase from 1 to 3 m in the elevation of the 6400 -year BP highstand with distance away from the shelf margin is consistent with a hydro-isostatic origin for the emergence as predicted by geophysical models.

40|$|The early 14 th {{century and}} so far very little commented on Byzantios logos by Theodore Metochites {{appears to be the}} first surviving, lengthy, and {{independent}} city encomium in the Greek language since the 4 th century Antiochikos logos by Libanios. Metochites seems to be quite familiar with the late antique tradition of the extended independent city praises and as a result the 70 folia long laus Constantinopolitana, includes all the expected, and power-indicating praising themes: thesis, foundation, walls, secular buildings and other infrastructure, occupations of the citizens, internal and external beauty, piety of the citizens and churches, secular education, ports and trade, commonwealth and cosmopolitanism, ecumenical character, intense Christian faith and synkrisis with other famous cities. But can an encomium of Constantinople, written in the dramatic first decade of the 14 th century, really be a source of any power representations at all? Or should one reassess the encomiastic topoi and attempt to distinguish fact from fiction and power from illusion of power? Finally, can the lengthier and more persistent analysis of particular features serve as a proof of their more realistic character? The above questions are approached by using some hidden <b>dating</b> <b>indicators</b> of Byzantios logos, in addition to a critical evaluation of Metochites᾽ use of the late antique rhetorical guidelines, and {{in the light of the}} latest research on the economic and spiritual life in early Palaiologan Constantinople...|$|R

40|$|High {{nitrogen}} (N) application {{rates are}} used by maize growers as an ‘insurance’, but may have an adverse effect on the environment. In this paper, the potential for nitrogen savings {{by the use of}} site-specific N fertilization rates is reviewed. Various tools for a more precise assessment of N requirements are available. Adjustments of N rates to the amounts of soil mineral N present shortly before planting can contribute to efficient N use, as can a deliberate delay of N dressings combined with indicator-based N supplementation after emergence. Conditions, under which these strategies are effective, are discussed. Post-emergence tests indicate whether a crop is likely to respond to sidedress N, but few tests quantify how much N should be sidedressed. Tissue tests are of less value for the support of decisions on N supplementation than indicators that are directly related to the soil or to the measurement of leaf and canopy greenness. Greenness and tissue tests are both unable to quantify excessive availability of N at early crop stages, as opposed to soil related indicators. Moreover, all crop tests generally need an on-site calibration with a reference plot. At later sampling <b>dates,</b> <b>indicators</b> can provide clues for the adjustment of N management in subsequent maize crops. The late stalk nitrate test and the post-harvest soil mineral N test appear to be the most valuable. Although indicators capable of identifying fields with an excessive N availability may save money, little {{attention has been paid to}} a cost-benefit analysis of indicator-based site-specific N management...|$|R
40|$|The use of Acheulean (handaxe) {{typology}} as {{a cultural}} and temporal marker has been a topic of controversy in recent decades, with many archaeologists continuing to reject such an approach out of hand. Much of the controversy stems, however, from difficulties in reconciling the archaeological record from Quaternary sediments with a flawed and overly simplified chronostratigraphical template. With {{the adoption of the}} ‘expanded chronology’ based on the marine oxygen isotope record, underpinned by biostratigraphical and geochronological dating, has come the recognition of a meaningful progression of artefact types, such as the first appearance of Levallois technique, attributed to MIS 9 – 8 over widespread parts of the Old World. More recently it has been established that assemblages in Britain with twisted ovate handaxes in significant numbers represent MIS 11 occupation, while those with significant proportions of cleavers and ‘ficron’ handaxes appear to be correlated with deposits formed at {{around the time of the}} MIS 9 interglacial. The recognition of such patterns stems largely from the well-dated Thames sequence; it should not be confused with the previous use, in the mid- 20 th century, of archaeological typology as a crude <b>dating</b> <b>indicator</b> based on a relative refinement of tool making. Key means of age constraint for the Thames sequence have been mammalian assemblage zones representing the last four interglacial cycles, molluscan biostragraphy and amino acid racemization dating of molluscan material, especially the calcitic opercula of the gastropod Bithynia tentaculata, thus providing a framework within which the archaeological patterns can be identified...|$|R

By studying economic <b>indicators</b> of <b>dates,</b> {{the results show that}} there are improvements in all general economic <b>dates</b> <b>indicators</b> such as production, consumption, export, and import of Saudi dates during the study period. Although production of dates increased by about 86 %, processing dates is only 10 % of total production during 2000 – 2010. By studying the manufacturing problems, the results show that there are multiple production and marketing problems in manufacturing process such as the low quality of some dates varieties, inefficient marketing services (lack of standardising and grading), Government regulations, and manufacturing deterioration. In addition to processing problems related to the morphology characteristic (size, color, weight, etc.) and chemical contents (sugar, glucose, fructose, etc.) of date varieties. As a result of processing problems, feasibility for processing some dates varieties is now in depute such as Ehalas and Rezez produced from eastern Governorate. So, this paper study the processing problems of Saudi dates moreover study local and foreign consumers needs of Saudi dates by analysis the local and foreign demand of processed dates varieties such as size, color, taste, chemical, and morphology characteristics. The research supposes some possible solution for solving these processing problems and promoting marketing and manufacturing sector of Saudi dates. Finally, it is important to build a strategy plan that is concentrating on the cultivation varieties for export according to the foreign consumers’ needs other than local consumers’ needs to improve the export percentage of total dates production, which is very limited (5 %) for the third world producer...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background This paper {{describes}} and {{assesses the}} electronic surveillance of outbreaks {{based on the}} early warning for four endemic diseases – typhoid fever, amebic dysentery, viral hepatitis A and brucellosis – in Lebanon, for the first 28 weeks of 2005 and first 26 weeks of 2007. Methods The electronic early warning system {{is based on the}} mandatory notification of 37 targeted diseases. The four target diseases assessed in this paper are based on monthly notification. Standards were set for case definitions and forms. Physicians and hospitals report to the Ministry of Public Health (MOPH), where data is checked and transmitted to a central location for entry into the national database, which stores historical and current data, as well as population estimates based on national surveys. The event date was selected for case <b>dating.</b> <b>Indicators</b> triggering abnormalities include number of cases, rates, and relative ratios. Four relative ratios were selected using the period of 1 week, 4 weeks or 52 weeks for the current and previous years. Screening was conducted on a weekly basis in 2005, and on a daily basis in 2007. Abnormal signals were verified, documented and grouped by alert-episodes for each disease, district, and period. MOPH teams verified and investigated case clustering. Results During the first 28 weeks of 2005 and the first 26 weeks of 2007, screening operations were 68 % and 89 %, respectively, for completeness. Detected abnormal signals were 26 and 166 and identified alert-episodes were 11 and 22, respectively. Verified clusters were 7 and 11; positive predictive value for clusters identification was 64 % and 50 %, respectively. The time interval between first cases and first abnormal signals was on average 4 weeks and 5 weeks, respectively. Conclusion Timely reporting, transmission, data entry, analysis and communication are the elements of timely outbreak detection. The electronic surveillance of outbreaks for epidemic-prone diseases, which are mandatory notified on a monthly basis using indicator-based thresholds, is capable of detecting spatio-temporal clusters and outbreaks; however, with some delay. The national surveillance system needs to be reviewed in order to provide timely data for early warning surveillance and response. </p...|$|R

Quality of life measurement in intellectual disability reflects a variety of indicators, often grouped under life domains. Subjective and objective methods of measuring indicators each have strengths and drawbacks, but it is currently considered best to use both methods. Indicators of quality of life that are common to all people have been measured to <b>date,</b> although <b>indicators</b> that are unique to individuals are highly useful for enhancing individual development and for applying person-centered practice. Aggregate quality of life data from individuals may not always be the best source of information for evaluating policies and service practices. A case is made for supplementing quality of life frameworks or adopting other frameworks for these purposes, with the Capabilities Framework offered as an example. Further, an argument is made that a pragmatic approach might best be taken to policy and program evaluation, whereby the key criterion for using a conceptual framework and set of indicators is its usefulness in effecting positive change in people's lives...|$|R
