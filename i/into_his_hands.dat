5|$|Kesselring {{was back}} where he started. Park's {{handling}} of the actions was a masterpiece of aggressive defence, yet he was not under the same pressure {{as he had been}} in the battles during August when air battles were so confusing they were hard to control. A big set-piece offensive played <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands.</b>|$|E
5|$|Several of Necrid's attacks {{duplicate}} physical {{motions and}} properties of attacks used by other {{characters in the}} series. However, each attack causes his weapon to extend from then retract <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands,</b> resulting in different visual cues than the move they derive from. Some attacks combine elements of two other existing character moves; for example, Dragon Blaze begins with one attack used by Maxi and ends with another from Nightmare. Despite this fact some moves are unique to Necrid's repertoire, such as Elder Topaz, an attack stance that allows {{the use of an}} altered set of attacks for a short time, and Void Cannon, which creates a small explosion on the ground at varying distances from Necrid.|$|E
5|$|Texas {{was stopped}} {{on their first}} drive due to an {{unsuccessful}} fourth down conversion. Baylor's first possession ended when UT's Michael Huff intercepted a pass from Baylor's Terrance Park. Longhorn Jamaal Charles scored a touchdown on the drive but the kick was blocked, giving Texas the only first-quarter score and a 6–0 lead. Texas extended {{the lead in the}} secondquarter with rushing touchdowns from Henry Melton, Jamaal Charles, and Ramonce Taylor. Taylor made two more touchdowns in the thirdquarter and Quan Cosby caught a touchdown pass from Young. In the fourth quarter, Taylor scored his fourthtouchdown and backup quarterback Matt Nordgren scored on an odd play where he was hit and fumbled while scrambling for the goal line but the ball traveled forward at about the same speed he was running and bounced right back up <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands.</b> Texas won the 2005game 62–0 making it the only shutout of the 2005season for the Longhorns.|$|E

25|$|The {{defeat of}} the crusaders and the capture of King Louis IX in Fariskur created shock in France. The crusaders were {{circulating}} false information in Europe, claiming that Louis IX had defeated the Sultan of Egypt in a great battle and that Cairo had been betrayed <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands.</b> When {{the news of the}} French defeat reached France, a hysterical movement called the Shepherds' Crusade occurred in France.|$|E
25|$|Over the {{following}} years, the new Spanish governor Alexander Farnese (Duke of Parma) reconquered the {{major part of}} Flanders and Brabant, as well as {{large parts of the}} northeastern provinces. The Roman Catholic religion was restored in much of this area. In 1585, Antwerp—the largest city in the Low Countries at the time—fell <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands,</b> which caused over half its population to flee to the north (see also Siege of Antwerp).|$|E
25|$|Fitzwalter {{went over}} to France with the Earl of Winchester and offered the throne to Louis, the son of King Philip, putting <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> twenty-four hostages and assuring him of the support of their party. Fitzwalter was back in England early in 1216. Louis landed in May, and as John made great {{progress}} in the east, Fitzwalter busied himself in compelling Essex and Suffolk, his own counties, to accept the foreign king. The tide of fortune now turned, but after John's death on 19 October Fitzwalter's difficulties increased. Gradually the English {{went over to}} the side of the new king Henry III. Those who remained in arms were not respected by the French, because of their betrayal of John.|$|E

25|$|In the King's opinion, {{so long as}} Chiang Mai {{was ruled}} by the Burmese, the north of Siam would be {{constantly}} subjected to their incursions. The prerequisite {{for the maintenance of}} peace in that region would therefore be the complete expulsion of the Burmese from Chiang Mai. In 1771, the Burmese Governor of that city moved his army southwards and laid siege to Phichai, but he was driven out. Taksin followed the Burmese with a view to studying their strength, and his army was thus not prepared for a direct assault on their city fortress. After meeting with stubborn resistance, he retired, presumably believing in an ancient prophesy to the effect that two attempts were required for the capture of Chiang Mai. King Narairaja had tried twice to seize it before it fell <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands.</b>|$|E
25|$|It was in {{this year}} that Enghien's father died, leaving him the fourth of his line and second of his name to bear the title Prince of Condé. He also now became premier prince du sang, {{addressed}} by everyone, from the king down, simply as Monsieur le prince. The enormous power that fell <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> was naturally looked upon with serious alarm by the Regent and her minister. Condé's birth and military renown placed him {{at the head of}} the French nobility, but, added to that, the family of which he was now chief was both enormously rich and master of a large part of France. Condé himself held Burgundy, Berry and the marches of Lorraine, as well as other less important territory. His brother, the Prince de Conti held Champagne, and his brother-in-law, Longueville, Normandy.|$|E
25|$|Considerable {{confusion}} and disputes {{seem to have}} followed Darras's unusual and untimely death. At Sidbury the advowson was contested. On 6 July, as a new rector was needed at Sidbury, Henry St George acted as patron, presenting William Walkebache. On 11 August, however, John Talbot, 6th Baron Furnivall, also acting as patron and described as lord of Sidbury, presented Walter Lawrence. Talbot, the young son of Richard, Lord Talbot, and Ankaret le Strange, was to emerge as Arundel's main political rival in the county, prepared to fight force with force. On 23 August Bishop Robert Mascall was issued with a writ probiting him from admitting anyone to Sidbury until the issue was decided. The following April the bishop himself presented William Whitehead. By August 1409 Whitehead had resigned and Talbot presented his nominee for a second time, apparently triumphant {{in the struggle to}} take over Darras's lands and rights. The same pattern is shown at Linley, which probably fell <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands,</b> as his widow, Margaret Beauchamp, Countess of Shrewsbury, held half the manor as a jointure property after his death.|$|E

25|$|He led English and Dutch {{troops in}} Spain. He was created the sole {{commander}} of the land forces in April 1705 and joint-commander with Sir Cloudesley Shovell of the fleet on 1 May, {{after he had been}} reinstated a member of the privy council on 29 March. He arrived at Lisbon on 20 June 1705, sailed for Barcelona (August 1705) on an expedition for the conquest of Catalonia, and began to besiege the city. For some weeks, the operations were not prosecuted with vigour and Peterborough urged that the fleet should transport the troops to Italy, but the energetic counsels of the Archduke Charles of Austria at last prevailed and by 14 October the city fell <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands.</b> On 24 January 1706 he entered Valencia in triumph, but these movements had weakened the garrison at Barcelona, which was now besieged by a superior French force under Tessé. The garrison, commanded by the Archduke, defended their positions with great bravery, but would have been obliged to surrender had not the fleet of Sir John Leake, answering the appeals of Charles but contrary to the original orders of Peterborough, come to their assistance on 8 May, whereupon the French raised the siege on 11 May.|$|E
25|$|At Christmas, William II pledged by the Holy Face of Lucca {{that neither}} Anselm {{nor any other}} would sit at Canterbury while he lived but in March he fell seriously ill at Alveston. Believing his sinful {{behavior}} was responsible, he summoned Anselm to hear his confession and administer last rites. He published a proclamation releasing his captives, discharging his debts, and promising to henceforth govern according to the law. On 6 March 1093, he further nominated Anselm to fill the vacancy at Canterbury; the clerics gathered at court acclaiming him, forcing the crozier <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands,</b> and bodily carrying him to a nearby church amid a Te Deum. Anselm tried to refuse {{on the grounds of}} age and ill-health for months and the monks of Bec refused to give him permission to leave them. Negotiations were handled by the recently restored Bishop William of Durham and Robert, count of Meulan. On 24 August, Anselm gave KingWilliam the conditions under which he would accept the position, which amounted to the agenda of the Gregorian Reform: the king would have to return the church lands which had been seized, accept his spiritual counsel, and forswear the antipope ClementIII in favour of UrbanII. William Rufus was exceedingly reluctant to accept these conditions: he consented only to the first and, a few days afterwards, reneged on that, suspending preparations for Anselm's investiture. Public pressure forced William to return to Anselm and in the end they settled on a partial return of Canterbury's lands as his own concession. Anselm received dispensation from his duties in Normandy, did homage to William, and—on 25 September 1093—was enthroned at Canterbury Cathedral. The same day, WilliamII finally returned the lands of the see.|$|E

500|$|Lu'lu' al-Kabir died in 1008 and was {{succeeded by}} Mansur. Mansur {{attempted}} to concentrate further power <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> {{at the expense}} of the Aleppine aʿyān (local elite), though he formally continued his predecessors' policy of separating the Emirate of Aleppo's civil administration from its military command. On the diplomatic front, he maintained the Byzantines' virtual protectorate over Aleppo, though he also developed contacts with the Cairo-based Fatimid Caliphate. Basing his information on the chronicles of medieval Aleppine historians, historian Suhayl Zakkar wrote, Unlike his father, Mansur was over-confident, short-sighted, a drunkard, ' oppressor and unjust'. Because of this the Aleppines hated him and several of their poets cursed him in their poems. ... The population of Aleppo ... began to search for a way to get rid of him. As time went by he was heedlessly and arrogantly increasing his oppression. ... the Aleppines found that the restoration of the Hamdanid dynasty would be the solution. They recalled and emphasized the fact that Mansur himself was the son of [...] Hamdanids' slave who had betrayed his masters and who had usurped their rights.|$|E
