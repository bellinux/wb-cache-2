5|$|After the war {{four more}} <b>gaseous</b> {{diffusion}} plants {{were added to}} the site, named K-27, K-29, K-31 and K-33. The K-25 site was renamed the Oak Ridge <b>Gaseous</b> Diffusion Plant in 1955. Production of enriched uranium ended in 1964, and <b>gaseous</b> diffusion finally ceased on the site on 27 August 1985. The Oak Ridge <b>Gaseous</b> Diffusion Plant was renamed the Oak Ridge K-25 Site in 1989, and the East Tennessee Technology Park in 1996. Demolition of all five <b>gaseous</b> diffusion plants was completed in February 2017.|$|E
5|$|Liquid {{nitrogen}} readily evaporates to form <b>gaseous</b> nitrogen, {{and hence}} the precautions associated with <b>gaseous</b> nitrogen also apply to liquid nitrogen. For example, oxygen sensors are sometimes used as a safety precaution when working with liquid nitrogen to alert workers of gas spills into a confined space.|$|E
5|$|The <b>gaseous</b> {{diffusion}} process remained more encouraging, although it too had technical obstacles to overcome. By {{the end of}} 1943, Urey had over 700 people working for him on <b>gaseous</b> diffusion. The process involved hundreds of cascades, in which corrosive uranium hexafluoride diffused through <b>gaseous</b> barriers, becoming progressively more enriched at every stage. A major problem was finding proper seals for the pumps, but by far the greatest difficulty lay in constructing an appropriate diffusion barrier. Construction of the huge K-25 <b>gaseous</b> diffusion plant was well under way before a suitable barrier became available in quantity in 1944. As a backup, Urey championed thermal diffusion.|$|E
5|$|According to {{formation}} models, {{the planet}} has a <b>gaseous</b> envelope comprising about 10% of its mass.|$|E
5|$|Construction began before {{completion}} of the design for the <b>gaseous</b> diffusion process. Due to {{the large amount of}} electric power that the K-25 plant was expected to consume, it was decided to provide it with its own electric power plant. While the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) believed that it could supply the Clinton Engineer Works' needs, there was unease about relying on a single supplier when a power failure could cost the <b>gaseous</b> diffusion plant weeks of work, and the lines to TVA could be sabotaged. A local plant was more secure. The Kellex engineers were also attracted to the idea of being able to generate the variable frequency current required by the <b>gaseous</b> diffusion process without complicated transformers.|$|E
5|$|<b>Gaseous</b> {{diffusion}} {{is based}} on Graham's law, which states {{that the rate of}} effusion of a gas through a porous barrier is inversely proportional to the square root of the gas's molecular mass. In a container with a porous barrier containing a mixture of two gases, the lighter molecules will pass out of the container more rapidly than the heavier molecules. The gas leaving the container is slightly enriched in the lighter molecules, while the residual gas is slightly depleted. A container wherein the enrichment process takes place through <b>gaseous</b> diffusion is called a diffuser.|$|E
5|$|Helium is commercially {{available}} in either liquid or <b>gaseous</b> form. As a liquid, {{it can be}} supplied in small insulated containers called dewars which hold as much as 1,000 liters of helium, or in large ISO containers which have nominal capacities as large as 42m3 (around 11,000 U.S. gallons). In <b>gaseous</b> form, small quantities of helium are supplied in high-pressure cylinders holding as much as 8m3 (approx. 282 standard cubic feet), while large quantities of high-pressure gas are supplied in tube trailers which have capacities {{of as much as}} 4,860m3 (approx. 172,000 standard cubic feet).|$|E

5|$|The <b>gaseous</b> {{content of}} the planet is {{calculated}} at a few percent of its total mass, but the envelope accounts for 70-80% of the planet's total volume.|$|E
5|$|Tube Alloys {{made its}} {{greatest}} advances in <b>gaseous</b> diffusion technology, and Chadwick had originally {{hoped that the}} pilot plant at least would be built in Britain. <b>Gaseous</b> diffusion technology was devised by Simon and three expatriates, Nicholas Kurti from Hungary, Heinrich Kuhn from Germany, and Henry Arms from the United States, at the Clarendon Laboratory in 1940. The prototype <b>gaseous</b> diffusion equipment, two two-stage models and two ten-stage models, was manufactured by Metropolitan-Vickers {{at a cost of}} £150,000 for the four units. Two single-stage machines were later added. Delays in delivery meant that experiments with the single-stage machine did not commence until June 1943, and with the two-stage machine until August 1943. The two ten-stage machines were delivered in August and November 1943, but by this time the research programme they had been built for had been overtaken by events.|$|E
5|$|With the war over, the Alpha tracks {{began to}} suspend {{operations}} on 4 September 1945, and ceased operation completely on 22 September. The last two Beta tracks went into full operation in November and December 1945, processing feed from K-25 {{and the new}} K-27 <b>gaseous</b> diffusion plant. By May 1946, studies suggested that the <b>gaseous</b> diffusion plants could fully enrich the uranium by themselves without accidentally creating a critical mass. After a trial demonstrated {{that this was the}} case, Groves ordered all but one Beta track shut down in December 1946.|$|E
5|$|According to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), {{man-made}} {{sources of}} thallium pollution include <b>gaseous</b> emission of cement factories, coal burning power plants, and metal sewers. The {{main source of}} elevated thallium concentrations in water is the leaching of thallium from ore processing operations.|$|E
5|$|HD 154672 b has an orbital {{eccentricity}} of 0.61, denoting a very elliptical orbit. The planet's discoverers noted that if water {{existed in the}} planet's atmosphere, it might change from a liquid state to a <b>gaseous</b> state as the planet swings closer to its host star, increasing its temperature.|$|E
5|$|He has {{historically}} been credited {{with the discovery of}} oxygen, having isolated it in its <b>gaseous</b> state, although Carl Wilhelm Scheele and Antoine Lavoisier also have strong claims to the discovery.|$|E
5|$|In 1943, Urey {{brought in}} Hugh S. Taylor from Princeton University {{to look at}} the problem of a usable barrier. Libby made {{progress}} on understanding the chemistry of uranium hexafluoride, leading to ideas on how to prevent corrosion and plugging. Chemical researchers at the SAM Laboratories studied fluorocarbons, which resisted corrosion, and could be used as lubricants and coolants in the <b>gaseous</b> diffusion plant. Despite this progress, the K-25 Project was in serious trouble without a suitable barrier, and by August 1943 it was facing cancellation. On 13 August Groves informed the Military Policy Committee, the senior committee that steered the Manhattan Project, that <b>gaseous</b> diffusion enrichment in excess of 50 percent was probably infeasible, and that the <b>gaseous</b> diffusion plant would be limited to producing product with a lower enrichment that could be fed into the calutrons of the Y-12 electromagnetic plant. Urey therefore began preparations to mass-produce the Norris-Adler barrier, despite its problems.|$|E
5|$|In fact, {{formation}} models {{indicate that}} the planet has a <b>gaseous</b> envelope, somewhat less massive than 20% of it total mass, which account for ≈60% of its radius (or ≈90% of its volume).|$|E
5|$|In {{the same}} year the first hydrogen-cooled {{turbogenerator}} went into service with <b>gaseous</b> hydrogen as a coolant in the rotor and the stator in 1937 at Dayton, Ohio, by the Dayton Power & Light Co.; because of the thermal conductivity of hydrogen gas, {{this is the most}} common type in its field today.|$|E
5|$|Indium(I) {{compounds}} are not common. The chloride, bromide, and iodide {{are deeply}} colored, unlike the parent trihalides {{from which they}} are prepared. The fluoride is known only as an unstable <b>gaseous</b> compound. Indium(I) oxide black powder is produced when indium(III) oxide decomposes upon heating to 700°C.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the next}} three years, Libby worked on the <b>gaseous</b> {{diffusion}} process for uranium enrichment. An atomic bomb required fissile material, and the fissile uranium-235 made up only 0.7 percent of natural uranium. The SAM Laboratories therefore {{had to find a}} way of separating kilograms of it from the more abundant uranium-238. <b>Gaseous</b> diffusion worked on the principle that a lighter gas diffuses through a barrier faster than a heavier one at a rate inversely proportional to its molecular weight. But the only known gas containing uranium was the highly corrosive uranium hexafluoride, and a suitable barrier was hard to find.|$|E
5|$|Production {{commenced}} in February 1945, and {{the first}} product was shipped to the calutrons in March. By April, the <b>gaseous</b> diffusion plant was producing 1.1 percent product. It was then decided that instead of processing uranium hexafluoride feed from the Harshaw Chemical Company, the <b>gaseous</b> diffusion plant would take {{the product of the}} S-50 thermal diffusion plant, with an average enrichment of about 0.85 percent. Product enrichment continued to improve, as more stages came online and performed better than anticipated. In June product was being enriched to 7 percent; by September it was 23 percent. The S-50 plant ceased operation on 9 September, and Kellex transferred the last unit to Union Carbide on 11 September 1945. Highly enriched uranium was used in the Little Boy atomic bomb used in the atomic bombing of Hiroshima on 6 August 1945.|$|E
5|$|The Quebec Agreement allowed Simon and Peierls to {{meet with}} representatives of Kellex, who were {{designing}} and building the American <b>gaseous</b> diffusion plant, Union Carbide and Carbon, who would operate it, and Harold Urey's Substitute Alloy Materials (SAM) Laboratories at Columbia University, the Manhattan Project's centre tasked with {{research and development of}} the process. The year's loss of cooperation cost the Manhattan Project dearly. The corporations were committed to tight schedules, and the engineers were unable to incorporate British proposals that would involve major changes. Nor would it be possible to build a second plant. Nonetheless, the Americans were still eager for British assistance, and Groves asked for a British mission to be sent to assist the <b>gaseous</b> diffusion project. In the meantime, Simon and Peierls were attached to Kellex.|$|E
5|$|The {{asymmetric}} <b>gaseous</b> envelope, another cooler region, extends {{for several}} radii (~10–40AU) from the photosphere. It is enriched in oxygen {{and especially in}} nitrogen relative to carbon. These composition anomalies are likely caused by contamination by CNO-processed material {{from the inside of}} Betelgeuse.|$|E
5|$|The {{district}} was largely rural and agricultural with no large cities. One {{of the major}} industries was the United States Department of Energy's Portsmouth <b>Gaseous</b> Diffusion Plant at Piketon, which manufacted uranium for nuclear weapons. The {{district was}} 97% white with a median household income of $21,761.|$|E
5|$|The {{electrolysis}} {{of water}} is a simple method of producing hydrogen. A low voltage current is run through the water, and <b>gaseous</b> oxygen forms at the anode while <b>gaseous</b> hydrogen forms at the cathode. Typically the cathode is made from platinum or another inert metal when producing hydrogen for storage. If, however, the gas is to be burnt on site, oxygen is desirable to assist the combustion, and so both electrodes would be made from inert metals. (Iron, for instance, would oxidize, and thus decrease the amount of oxygen given off.) The theoretical maximum efficiency (electricity used vs. energetic value of hydrogen produced) is in the range 80–94%.|$|E
5|$|The {{most obvious}} technology, the centrifuge, failed, but {{electromagnetic}} separation, <b>gaseous</b> diffusion, and thermal diffusion technologies were all successful {{and contributed to}} the project. In February 1943, Groves {{came up with the idea}} of using the output of some plants as the input for others.|$|E
5|$|The {{need for}} {{fluorine}} {{arose from the}} need to separate the isotope235U from 238U because the former, present in natural uranium at a concentration of less than 1% is fissile (capable of sustaining a nuclear chain reaction of nuclear fission with thermal neutrons), whereas the latter is not. Members of the MAUD Committee (especially Francis Simon and Nicholas Kurti) proposed the use of <b>gaseous</b> diffusion for isotope separation, since, according to Graham's law the rate of diffusion is inversely proportional to molecular mass. After an extensive search, uranium hexafluoride, UF6, {{was determined to be}} the most suitable compound of uranium to be used for the <b>gaseous</b> diffusion process. Elemental fluorine is needed in the production of UF6.|$|E
5|$|The {{recovered}} beef {{material is}} extruded through long tubes that are thinner than a pencil, {{during which time}} at the Beef Products, Inc. (BPI) processing plant, the meat is exposed to <b>gaseous</b> ammonia. At Cargill Meat Solutions, citric acid is used to kill bacteria such as E. coli and Salmonella. <b>Gaseous</b> ammonia {{in contact with the}} water in the meat produces ammonium hydroxide. The ammonia sharply increases the pH and damages microscopic organisms, the freezing causes ice crystals to form and puncture the organisms' weakened cell walls, and the mechanical stress destroys the organisms altogether. The product is finely ground, compressed into pellets or blocks, flash frozen and then shipped for use as an additive.|$|E
5|$|There are {{thousands}} of uses of various potassium compounds. One example is potassium superoxide, , an orange solid {{that acts as a}} portable source of oxygen and a carbon dioxide absorber. It is widely used in respiration systems in mines, submarines and spacecraft as it takes less volume than the <b>gaseous</b> oxygen.|$|E
5|$|Urey began {{considering}} {{isotope separation}} methods. The centrifuge process {{was regarded as}} the most promising. Beams had developed such a process at the University of Virginia during the 1930s, but had encountered technical difficulties. The process required high rotational speeds, but at certain speeds harmonic vibrations developed that threatened to tear the machinery apart. It was therefore necessary to accelerate quickly through these speeds. In 1941 he began working with uranium hexafluoride, the only known <b>gaseous</b> compound of uranium, {{and was able to}} separate uranium-235. At Columbia, Urey had Karl P. Cohen investigate the process, and he produced a body of mathematical theory making it possible to design a centrifugal separation unit, which Westinghouse undertook to construct. Another possibility was <b>gaseous</b> diffusion, which George B. Kistiakowsky suggested at a lunch on May 21, 1940.|$|E
5|$|A 1927 {{chemistry}} {{graduate of}} the University of California at Berkeley, from which he received his doctorate in 1933, he studied radioactive elements and developed sensitive Geiger counters to measure weak natural and artificial radioactivity. During World War II {{he worked in the}} Manhattan Project's Substitute Alloy Materials (SAM) Laboratories at Columbia University, developing the <b>gaseous</b> diffusion process for uranium enrichment.|$|E
5|$|A British mission led by Akers {{assisted}} {{in the development of}} <b>gaseous</b> diffusion technology at the SAM Laboratories in New York. Another, headed by Mark Oliphant, assisted with that of the electromagnetic separation process at the Berkeley Radiation Laboratory. Cockcroft became the director of the joint British-Canadian Montreal Laboratory. A British mission to the Los Alamos Laboratory was led by Chadwick, and later Peierls, which included several of Britain's most eminent scientists. As overall head of the British Mission, Chadwick forged a close and successful partnership, and ensured that British participation was complete and wholehearted.|$|E
5|$|A coolant {{control valve}} {{is mounted on}} the {{combustion}} chamber coolant bypass duct of each engine. The engine controller regulates the amount of <b>gaseous</b> hydrogen allowed to bypass the nozzle coolant loop, thus controlling its temperature. The chamber coolant valve is 100% open before engine start. During engine operation, it is 100% open for throttle settings of 100 to 109% for maximum cooling. For throttle settings between 65 and 100%, its position ranged from 66.4 to 100% open for reduced cooling.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} <b>gaseous</b> or highly {{volatile}} brominated halomethane compounds are non-toxic and make superior fire suppressant agents by this same mechanism, and are particular effective in enclosed spaces such as submarines, airplanes, and spacecraft. However, they are expensive and their production and use {{has been greatly}} curtailed due to their effect as ozone-depleting agents. They are no longer used in routine fire extinguishers, but retain niche uses in aerospace and military automatic fire-suppression applications. They include bromochloromethane (Halon 1011, CH2BrCl), bromochlorodifluoromethane (Halon 1211, CBrClF2), and bromotrifluoromethane (Halon 1301, CBrF3).|$|E
5|$|Astronomically, {{the most}} {{important}} property of compact objects is that they provide a supremely efficient mechanism for converting gravitational energy into electromagnetic radiation. Accretion, the falling of dust or <b>gaseous</b> matter onto stellar or supermassive black holes, {{is thought to be}} responsible for some spectacularly luminous astronomical objects, notably diverse kinds of active galactic nuclei on galactic scales and stellar-size objects such as microquasars. In particular, accretion can lead to relativistic jets, focused beams of highly energetic particles that are being flung into space at almost light speed.|$|E
