Robots can be guided by an external control device or the control may be embedded within. Robots may be constructed to take on human form but most robots are machines designed to perform a task with no regard to <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>look.</b>|$|E
25|$|This type of {{classification}} displays {{information about the}} artifact via the object's display. Stylistic typology {{is not to be}} confused with classification of certain styles, for that would just entail organizing artifacts based on <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>look.</b> This type of typology accounts for information told through the artifact. Pottery is an example of a stylistic typology because the artifacts provide information on artistic evolution.|$|E
25|$|The {{well-known}} red-tailed black shark (Epalzeorhynchos bicolor) {{from the}} Mae Klong river of The Bridge on the River Kwai fame possibly only survives in captivity. Ironically, while pollution {{and other forms}} of overuse by humans have driven it from its native home, it is bred for the aquarium fish trade by the thousands. The Yarqon bleak (Acanthobrama telavivensis) from the Yarqon River had to be rescued into captivity from imminent extinction; new populations have apparently been established again successfully from captive stock. Balitoridae and Cobitidae, meanwhile, contain {{a very large number of}} species about which essentially nothing is known except <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>look</b> and where they were first found.|$|E

25|$|Ever {{since the}} show's debut, the main characters, {{especially}} the title character, have quickly become the latest fixtures in the lexicon of pop media culture, and already they {{found their way}} onto parodies, news media stories and art-imitating-life situations. The show's impact on issues and culture has also {{attracted the attention of}} the United States Congress, where on January 17, 2007 California congresswoman Hilda Solis (D-32nd, El Monte) saluted Ferrera on both her Golden Globe win and for bringing a positive profile to the Latin and Hispanic communities. In addition to that recognition, on May 8, 2007, star America Ferrera was honored by TIME on the magazine's annual list of the 100 most influential people. The event took place at New York's Lincoln Center and the actress was recognized for defying stereotypes with the show. The success of Ugly Betty and how it deals with body imaging among women in general would inspire a series of reports on Entertainment Tonight, in which reporter Vanessa Minnillo went undercover in a fatsuit to see if women were discriminated on the basis of <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>look.</b> Gay awareness groups like GLAAD have also noted the positive impact the show has had regarding Betty's teenaged nephew Justin, who realizes that he is gay.|$|E

50|$|The {{red deer}} was {{introduced}} {{for the first}} time in 1945 (3 individuals), but the locals killed them because they were afraid of <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>looked</b> like. In 1948, other 30 red deer were introduced and by 1972 there were around 200-360 deer in the reserve.|$|R

2500|$|But such probing {{analyses}} {{into various}} shoppers' psyches may have ignored other significant factors affecting men's shopping habits, foremost among them women's shopping habits. As the retail analyst Marshal Cohen {{explained in a}} 2005 article in the New York Times entitled, [...] "Gay or Straight? Hard to Tell", {{the fact that women}} buy less of men's clothing than they used to has, more than any other factor, propelled men into stores to shop for themselves. [...] "In 1985 only 25 percent of all men's apparel was bought by men, he said; 75 percent was bought by women for men. By 1998 men were buying 52 percent of apparel; in 2004 that number grew to 69 percent and shows no sign of slowing." [...] One result of this shift was the revelation that men cared more about <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>look</b> than the women shopping for them had.|$|E
2500|$|In 1947, Variety {{magazine}} said [...] "Hitchcock {{could have}} chosen a more entertaining subject with which to use the arresting camera and staging technique displayed in Rope." [...] The next year, Bosley Crowther of The New York Times said the [...] "novelty of the picture {{is not in the}} drama itself, it being a plainly deliberate and rather thin exercise in suspense, but merely in the method which Mr. Hitchcock has used to stretch the intended tension for the length of the little stunt" [...] for a [...] "story of meager range". Nearly 36 years later, Vincent Canby, also of The New York Times, called the [...] "seldom seen" [...] and [...] "underrated" [...] film [...] "full of the kind of self-conscious epigrams and breezy ripostes that once defined wit and decadence in the Broadway theater"; it's a film [...] "less concerned with the characters and their moral dilemmas than with <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>look,</b> sound and move, and with the overall spectacle of how a perfect crime goes wrong".|$|E

[...] He is well known for his photographic work of jazz musicians from the 1970s – '80s. [...] Many of these works are in his book Black Borders, published in 1980 with a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts. [...] In an article printed in 1984 in The City Sun, he said, [...] "When I do a portrait, I’m doing a photograph of how that person feels to me; how I feel about the person, not <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>look.</b> [...] I find that in order for the portraits to work, they have to make a mental connection as well as an emotional one. [...] When they do that, I know I have it." [...] Many of his photographs achieve his signature effect through the careful use of lighting and shadows, manipulation of the backdrop, measured adjustments to shutter speeds, composition, and many other techniques and mediums at his command.|$|E
