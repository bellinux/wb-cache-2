50|$|The {{possibility}} {{for students to}} study abroad has been recognised as {{an essential element of}} European integration since the foundation of the Council of Europe in 1949. Within the Council of Europe, several international treaties were elaborated in this field: starting with the right to education under Article 2 of the first Protocol of 1952 to the European Convention on Human Rights, the European Convention on the <b>Equivalence</b> <b>of</b> <b>Diplomas</b> leading to Admission to Universities was opened for signature in 1953, the European Convention on the Equivalence of Periods of University Study in 1956, the European Convention on the Academic Recognition of University Qualifications in 1959, the European Agreement on continued Payment of Scholarships to students studying abroad in 1969, and the European Convention on the General Equivalence of Periods of University Study in 1990.|$|E
40|$|Abstract This paper aims at {{offering}} an overview and {{a theoretical framework}} of the national specific of the Romanian Higher Education and the challenges that lie ahead for a common European approach to education (the Bologna process and the European Higher Education Area- EHEA). We examine the National Qualifications in the EHEA Framework by addressing aspects such as degree cycles; qualification levels; types of diplomas; quality assurance; credit transfer system and Diploma Supplement. A critical argumentation in terms of learning outcomes translatability and recognition of academic and professional qualifications is addressed. Also, we shortly present some challenges concerning the student population (underrepresented groups; student fees and scholarships; student mobility). The research methodology comprises a thorough literature review of the national policy {{as it is the}} decisive factor for the Romanian education system (the National Law of Education from 2011 and the latest Governmental Decisions; the National Qualifications Authority’s Self-certification Report 2011; and data produced by other accredited Romanian Agencies, such as the Romanian Agency for Quality Assurance and the National Centre for Recognition and <b>Equivalence</b> <b>of</b> <b>Diplomas).</b> Also, a main piece of literature that was of great importance is the European Union’s institutional perspective (data provided by the European Commission Eurostat- the statistical office of the European Union; Information Centres, and European Students ’ Union), along with scientific studies in the area of higher education.

Recent examples include graduates from University of California at Berkeley and MIT who were given 8 differential subjects to study at the Faculty of Mathematics, and too many subjects to even get enrolled to final year at the Faculty of Physics so the graduate was enrolled in 3rd year of undergraduate studies of General (not even Theoretical, Experimental, or Applied) physics.
