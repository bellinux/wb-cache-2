5|$|My love is {{stronger}} than it's ever been, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>my</b> love may seem to have diminished. I do not love less, even though I don't show it as much. Love becomes a commodity when it's spoken of too highly and too frequently. I used to sing my praises very frequently when our love was new, like the nightingale which sings {{in the summer and}} stops at summers end. It's not that the summer is less pleasant for the nightingale, it's simply that the songs of other birds fill the air, and when things become common, they become less dear. It's for this reason, I, like the nightingale, have stopped writing. I do not wish my poems to become boring.|$|E

Although Formby's act was well-received, the show was not as successful as had been hoped, and Terry-Thomas later wrote that [...] "Formby put the audience in a certain mood which made them non-receptive to whoever followed... <b>Even</b> <b>though</b> <b>my</b> act was the star spot, I felt on this occasion that my being there was an anti-climax". He requested that the order be changed to have Formby close the show, but this was turned down. Formby suffered from stage fright during the show's run—the {{first time he had}} suffered from the condition since his earliest days on stage—and his bouts of depression returned, along with stomach problems.|$|E

2500|$|In a November 2009 {{article in}} the Toluca Lake, California, Tolucan Times, {{columnist}} Greg Crosby described a visit with Caesar and his wife Florence at their home. Of the couple's meeting, Florence said, [...] "Well, I thought he was nice for the summer ... I {{thought he would be}} just a nice boyfriend for the summer. He was cute-looking and tall, over six feet.... I was in my last year at Hunter College; we were still dating when Sid went into the service, the Coast Guard. Luckily he was stationed in New York so we were able to continue seeing each other, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>my</b> parents weren't too happy about it. They never thought he would amount to anything, that he'd never have a real career or make any money. But we were married one year after we met, in July of 1943." [...] She also pointed out, [...] "You know, he's not funny all the time. He can be very serious." [...] At the time of the interview, the couple had been married for 66 years. Florence Caesar died on March 3, 2010, aged 88.|$|E

60|$|Somehow I kept my head, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>my</b> {{heart pounded}} like {{a hammer and}} the blood drummed in my ears. It was the thought of Steele that saved me.

6000|$|... 'Well, {{you know}} what I mean, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>my</b> words are badly {{selected}} and commonplace,' she said impatiently.

6000|$|Even {{if she did}} not {{understand}} all he said, she at least read something in his smiling, countenance--something which reassured her.

I can make a picture there, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>my</b> fingers refuse to move. You are not an aesthete, I think, Mr. Hamel?
