5|$|A Dandie Dinmont Terrier {{is a small}} Scottish {{breed of}} <b>dog</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> terrier family. The breed has a very long body, short legs, and a {{distinctive}} topknot of hair on the head. A character in Sir Walter Scott's novel Guy Mannering has lent the name to the breed, with Dandie Dinmont thought {{to be based on}} James Davidson, who is credited as being the originator of the modern breed. Davidson's dogs descended from earlier terrier owning families, including the Allans of Holystone, Northumberland.|$|E
5|$|As a character, Spencer {{has been}} seen as an everyman figure, his blank {{expression}} and plain dress keeping him a simple archetype. Spencer displays a pacifistic and fatalistic inactivity throughout the film, simply allowing events to unfold around him without taking control. This passive behavior culminates in his sole act of instigation at the film's climax; his apparent act of infanticide is driven by his life of being domineered and controlled. Spencer's inactivity has also been seen by film critics Colin Odell and Michelle Le Blanc as a precursor to Lynch's 1983–92 comic strip The Angriest <b>Dog</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> World.|$|E

40|$|Dogs (N = 108) in {{an animal}} shelter {{received}} {{one of four}} enrichment programs: twice daily walking alone (walking) or in combination with a daily fooddispensing toy (toy), a daily session of standardized human contact (petting), or daily obedience training (obedience). We evaluated the effects of enrichment on: a) cortisol concentrations intermittently sampled across approximately days 2 - 10 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> shelter; b) behavior during an in-shelter mock adoption session; c) adoptability; d) behaviors <b>in</b> <b>the</b> adoptive homes; and e) frequency of retention up to 6 months post-adoption. Within enrichment groups, blood cortisol concentrations did not change from approximately day 2 to day 6 of residence <b>in</b> <b>the</b> shelter, but decreased significantly from approximately day 6 to day 10 only <b>in</b> <b>dogs</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> walking group. Among groups, changes in blood cortisol concentrations did not differ across sampling days. During an in-shelter mock adoption session, {{there were no differences}} among groups in attention-seeking behaviors, time sitting or lying, or time to approach <b>the</b> mock adopters. <b>Dogs</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> petting and obedience groups performed more ambivalent behaviors during the session on approximately days 9 - 10 of residence <b>in</b> <b>the</b> shelter than did <b>dogs</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> walking group. There were no differences <b>in</b> proportions of <b>dogs</b> adopted or on time to adoption among enrichment groups. However, more adopters of <b>dogs</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> toy and obedience groups selected their dogs because the dogs "did not bark" than did adopters of <b>dogs</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> walking group. At 1 month post-adoption, <b>dogs</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> obedience group displayed "hyperactive" behaviors more frequently than <b>dogs</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> walking and toy groups. Furthermore, <b>dogs</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> walking and petting groups displayed more annoying barking at 1 month post-adoption than <b>dogs</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> toy group. Seventeen percent of dogs were returned by 6 months post-adoption: four <b>in</b> <b>the</b> walking group, two <b>in</b> <b>the</b> toy group, one <b>in</b> <b>the</b> petting group, and four <b>in</b> <b>the</b> obedience group. The reasons for returning and the time to return did not vary among enrichment groups...|$|R

5|$|Alongside the Bloodhound and Basset Hound, the beagle {{has one of}} {{the best}} {{developed}} senses of smell of any <b>dog.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> 1950s, John Paul Scott and John Fuller began a 13-year study of canine behavior. As part of this research, they tested the scenting abilities of various breeds by putting a mouse in a one-acre field and timing how long it took the dogs to find it. The beagles found it in less than a minute, while Fox Terriers took 15 minutes and Scottish Terriers failed to find it at all. Beagles are better at ground-scenting (following a trail on the ground) than they are at air-scenting, and for this reason they have been excluded from most mountain rescue teams in favor of collies, which use sight in addition to air-scenting and are more biddable. The long ears and large lips of the beagle probably assist in trapping the scents close to the nose.|$|E
5|$|Orion is {{mentioned}} in the oldest surviving works of Greek literature, which probably {{date back to the}} 7th or 8th century BC, but which are the products of an oral tradition with origins several centuries earlier. In Homer's Iliad Orion is described as a constellation, and the star Sirius {{is mentioned}} as his <b>dog.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> Odyssey, Odysseus sees him hunting in the underworld with a bronze club, a great slayer of animals; he is also mentioned as a constellation, as the lover of the Goddess Dawn, as slain by Artemis, and as the most handsome of the earthborn. In the Works and Days of Hesiod, Orion is also a constellation, one whose rising and setting with the sun is used to reckon the year.|$|E
5|$|The Tahitian Dog, {{known as}} the ʻŪrī Mā’ohi in the Tahitian language, was {{introduced}} to Tahiti and the Society Islands (in modern French Polynesia) by the ancestors of the Tahitian (Mā’ohi) people during their migrations to Polynesia. They were {{closely related to the}} Hawaiian Poi Dog and the New Zealand kurī; the latter is believed to be a descendant of the breed. Similar breeds of Polynesian dogs were brought alongside pigs and chickens when the people settled the islands of Polynesia. The Marquesan Dog became extinct in the neighboring Marquesas Islands before 1595. Even though dogs were virtually absent from Western Polynesia, they were recognized when European explorers later brought them as items of trade, indicating a universal cultural recognition of the <b>dog</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> many islands.|$|E

5|$|There are {{two words}} in the Marquesan {{language}} for dog: peto, used in the Northern Marquesas, and nuhe, used in the Southern Marquesas. The former {{might have been an}} English loanword from pet or a Spanish loanword from perro (dog), although pero was an alternative for dog (kurī) in the related Māori language. According to another theory supporting its foreign origin, the name came from a New Haven dog named Pato left on Nuku Hiva by the American sea captain Edmund Fanning from 1798 to 1803. The South Marquesan Nuhe is unique in the Polynesian languages, but may have some connection to wanuhe, the word for <b>dog</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Papuan language of the Brumer Islands. French Catholic missionary René-Ildefonse Dordillon listed two other forms: mohoʻio and mohokio in his 1904 dictionary Grammaire et dictionnaire de la langue des iles Marquises.|$|E
5|$|Tidd {{imported}} Ch. Bowhit Pivot for his breeding {{lines in}} 1935, registering {{him with the}} AKC as Sierra Bowhit Pivot. In addition to his British titles, {{he became the first}} Corgi to be awarded Champion status in the US, and the first such dog to be named Best of Group at a conformation show in the United States. A month after those achievements, Little Madam repeated his victories. The Pembroke Welsh Corgi club was formed in 1937, and the first show was held at Geraldine Rockefeller Dodge's Gilralda Farms in New Jersey. Following the Second World War, there were imports from the United Kingdom, including Rozavel Uncle Sam which dominated the show circuit for Corgis. In 1949, he became the first Pembroke winner of Best in Show at an open conformation show in the United States. By 1998, the Pembroke Welsh Corgi had become the 37th most popular breed of <b>dog</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the 19th century, {{the breed}} had become popular in America and Canada due to their dual use as a family pet and a working <b>dog.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> early 20th century the breeders {{on either side of the}} Atlantic had created {{different}} breed standards for the Cocker Spaniel and the breed gradually diverged from one another, with the two becoming noticeably different by the 1920s. The American Cockers by now had a smaller muzzle, their coats were softer and the dogs overall were lighter and smaller. The differences were so apparent that in 1935, breeders founded the English Cocker Spaniel Club and restricted breeding between the two types of spaniel. The two types of Cocker Spaniel in America were shown together as one breed, with the English type as a variety of the main breed, until 1946 when the American Kennel Club recognised the English Cocker Spaniel as a separate breed.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis {{epidemiological}} survey of Anaplasma platys {{was carried out}} in rural and urban areas of three distinct regions of the State of Minas Gerais, Brazil. EDTA blood samples were collected during the dry season from dogs living on farms with an attempt to resample <b>the</b> same <b>dogs</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> subsequent rainy season. Samples were also taken from <b>dogs</b> <b>in</b> urban areas. DNA was extracted from blood samples for real time PCR. Risk factors, such as age, breed, sex, presence of ticks, and packed cell volume were analyzed. During the rainy season, the prevalence of infection by A. platys <b>in</b> <b>dogs</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> rural areas was significantly higher (13. 9 %) than that observed <b>in</b> <b>dogs</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> urban areas (5. 1 %). <b>Dogs</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Nanuque region were 3. 74 times (p= 0. 001) more likely to be real-time PCR positive than <b>dogs</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> other two studied regions. Dogs infested with ticks showed higher rates of positivity. The results showed that in rural areas of Minas Gerais A. platys infection is influenced by climatic conditions. In areas of higher temperature and higher humidity, transmission occurs during both the dry and rainy seasons, while in areas with lower temperature and humidity transmission occurs mainly during the dry season...|$|R
