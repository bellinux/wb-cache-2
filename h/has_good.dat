40|$|Background: Biosafety among lab {{technician}} is {{an important}} aspect {{and needs to be}} assessed. Present study was conducted to find out awareness of biosafety precautions amongst technicians working in laboratory. It determined the knowledge, attitude, and practice of universal precautions amongst medical laboratory technicians. Material and Methods: Cross-sectional study of health care workers was conducted using a standardized self-administered questionnaire, which enquired about knowledge, attitude and practices of universal precautions. Participants included; Medical laboratory technicians working in Pathology, Microbiology, and Biochemistry departments in Krishna Institute of Medical Science, Karad. Result: In this study 19 technicians from Biochemistry, Pathology and Microbiology were involved. Accordingly in knowledge in pathology 50 % of study subjects were having average and 50 % were <b>having</b> <b>good</b> scores while in biochemistry 25 % had average and 75 % <b>had</b> <b>good</b> scores and in microbiology 100 % of study subjects <b>had</b> <b>good</b> grade. For attitude, in pathology dept 83. 3 % had average and 16. 7 % <b>had</b> <b>good</b> grades. In biochemistry 12. 5 % had poor grades, 75 % had average grades and 12. 5 % <b>had</b> <b>good</b> grades. In microbiology 100 % <b>had</b> <b>good</b> grades.

5|$|Raman {{spectroscopy}} <b>has</b> <b>good</b> {{spatial resolution}} (~0.5 micrometers) and sensitivity (single nanotubes); it requires only minimal sample preparation and is rather informative. Consequently, Raman spectroscopy {{is probably the}} most popular technique of carbon nanotube characterization. Raman scattering in SWCNTs is resonant, i.e., only those tubes are probed which have one of the bandgaps equal to the exciting laser energy. Several scattering modes dominate the SWCNT spectrum, as discussed below.|$|E

The town's population has doubled since 1970 despite {{a reduction in the}} number of manufacturing jobs in salt and textile manufacturing, suggesting that many of the new residents live in Middlewich for reasons other than local employment.|$|E

5|$|Thallium has 25 {{isotopes}} {{which have}} atomic masses {{that range from}} 184 to 210. 203Tl and 205Tl are the only stable isotopes and make up nearly all of natural thallium. 204Tl is the most stable radioisotope, with a half-life of 3.78 years. It is made by the neutron activation of stable thallium in a nuclear reactor. The most useful radioisotope, 201Tl (half-life 73 hours), decays by electron capture, emitting X-rays (~70–80keV), and photons of 135 and 167keV in 10% total abundance; therefore, it <b>has</b> <b>good</b> imaging characteristics without excessive patient radiation dose. It {{is the most popular}} isotope used for thallium nuclear cardiac stress tests.|$|E
5|$|The {{international}} prototype metre and kilogram {{were both}} {{made from a}} 90%platinum, 10%iridium alloy which is exceptionally hard and which <b>has</b> <b>good</b> electrical and thermal conductivity properties. The prototype had a special X-shaped (Tresca) cross section to minimise the effects of torsional strain during length comparisons. and the prototype kilograms were cylindrical in shape. The London firm Johnson Matthey delivered 30 prototype metres and 40 prototype kilograms. At {{the first meeting of}} the CGPM in 1889 bar No.6 and cylinder No.X were accepted as the international prototypes. The remainder were either kept as BIPM working copies or distributed to member states as national prototypes.|$|E
5|$|A {{few other}} {{lines have been}} tried, with the outcome varying from an {{immediate}} equality to a clear advantage for Black. The cooling 4.e6 avoids complications and heads for an equal endgame with 4...dxe6 5.Qxd8+ Kxd8, Black's loss {{of the right to}} castle being of no great importance since queens have been traded. If Black wants to avoid this early endgame, he can try 4...Bb4+ 5.Nc3 Bxc3+ 6.bxc3 dxe6 and now the exchange of queens would give a plus to Black, as the white queenside pawns are isolated and doubled. The greedy 4.f4 is weak because White neglects his development and weakens the a7–g1 diagonal. Black can immediately exploit this with 4...Bc5, which threatens a fork on f2 and forbids White's castling; Black may later push d7–d6 to open the centre, e.g. 5.Nh3 0-0 6.Nc3 d6 7.exd6 cxd6 when Black <b>has</b> <b>good</b> squares for its pieces while White's castling is delayed.|$|E

5|$|Reviewers {{praised the}} co-op mode highly but many disliked the single-player mode. Danielle Riendeau (Polygon) liked Monacos {{gameplay}} stating {{that it was}} fun with other people, but {{it seemed that the}} single-player mode needed work. James Murff (GameFront) said the co-op was ridiculously fun and <b>has</b> <b>good</b> replayability. Marty Sliva (IGN) said that Monaco provided one of the best co-op experiences he'd had in a while. He stated that due to the gameplay and mechanics, {{it was one of the}} most unique and addictive games released in 2013. Scott Nichols (Digital Spy) said that the game contains lots to discover, but is best done cooperatively. Jeff Grubb (VentureBeat) praised the fact that the game works as both an arcade and a strategic game but said to skip it if the user wasn't planning on playing it cooperatively. Roger Hargreaves (Metro) liked the multiplayer mode more, but also praised the single-player mode calling it surprisingly compelling.|$|E
5|$|Soon after, Chris takes {{a shotgun}} from his father-in-law's home and carries {{it to his}} office in a tennis bag. On leaving, he calls Nola on her mobile to tell her he <b>has</b> <b>good</b> news for her. He goes to Nola's {{building}} and gains entry into the apartment of her neighbor, Mrs. Eastby, who he shoots and kills and then stages a burglary by ransacking the rooms and stealing jewelry and drugs. As Nola returns he shoots her in the stairwell. Chris then takes a taxi to the theater to watch a musical with Chloe. Scotland Yard investigates the crime and concludes it was committed by a drug addict stealing money. The following day, as the murder is in the news, Chris returns the shotgun and he and Chloe announce that she is pregnant.|$|E
5|$|Starting in {{a neutral}} position, Karma can reach up to Hero on the Good side or Infamous on the Evil side. Certain actions, such as {{stopping}} to help injured citizens or killing them to restore Cole's health, will affect the Karma level in either direction. Normal story missions may also alter the Karma level. During the game the player will encounter Karma moments, the Karma moments are delivered with 3D cutscenes and character-driven dialogue, the action pauses and the player has two actions that can be taken, always a Good and Evil option. There are also Good and Evil side missions in the game as well as random events which provide Karma decisions. Completion of Karma awarding missions helps gain access to unique powers based on the Karma level. The player is not locked into choosing either Karma path, and may opt to play towards one extreme and later switch to the other mid-game. Karma also influences the way that citizens view Cole in addition to altering Cole's appearance and {{certain aspects of the}} game's story. Citizens may throw rocks at and turn on Cole if he has Evil Karma or take pictures of and compliment Cole if he <b>has</b> <b>Good</b> Karma.|$|E
