25|$|Advances {{in digital}} {{electronics}} {{since the late}} 20th century provided new alternatives to the traditional linear-gain amplifiers by using <b>digital</b> <b>switching</b> to vary the pulse-shape of fixed amplitude signals, resulting in devices such as the Class-D amplifier.|$|E
25|$|Ericsson's AXE {{telephone}} exchange {{is the most}} widely used <b>digital</b> <b>switching</b> platform in the world and can be found throughout Europe and in most countries around the world. It is also very popular in mobile applications. This highly modular system was developed in Sweden in the 1970s as a replacement for the very popular range of Ericsson crossbar switches ARF, ARM, ARK and ARE used by many European networks from the 1950s onwards.|$|E

25|$|In 1966, the Northern Electric {{research}} lab, Northern Electric Laboratories (the predecessor to Bell-Northern Research), {{started looking}} into the possibilities of fiber optic cable, and in 1969, began work on digitizing telephone communications. Also in 1969, Northern began making inroads into the U.S. market with its switching systems. In 1972, it opened its first factory in the U.S. in Michigan. In 1975, Northern began shipping its first <b>digital</b> <b>switching</b> systems, {{one of the earliest}} such systems to be sold.|$|E
25|$|The {{concepts}} of <b>digital</b> <b>switching</b> {{were developed by}} various labs in the United States and in Europe from the 1930s onwards. The first prototype digital switch was developed by Bell Labs {{as part of the}} ESSEX project while the first true digital exchange to be combined with digital transmission systems was designed by LCT (Laboratoire Central de Telecommunications) in Paris. The first digital switch to be placed into a public network was the Empress Exchange in London, England which was designed by the General Post Office research labs. This was a tandem switch that connected three Strowger exchanges in the London area. The first commercial roll-out of a fully digital local switching system was Alcatel's E10 system which began serving customers in Brittany in Northwestern France in 1972.|$|E
25|$|The {{growth of}} digital {{technologies}} like the microprocessor {{has provided the}} motivation to advance MOSFET technology faster than {{any other type of}} silicon-based transistor. A big advantage of MOSFETs for <b>digital</b> <b>switching</b> is that the oxide layer between the gate and the channel prevents DC current from flowing through the gate, further reducing power consumption and giving a very large input impedance. The insulating oxide between the gate and channel effectively isolates a MOSFET in one logic stage from earlier and later stages, which allows a single MOSFET output to drive a considerable number of MOSFET inputs. Bipolar transistor-based logic (such as TTL) does not have such a high fanout capacity. This isolation also makes it easier for the designers to ignore to some extent loading effects between logic stages independently. That extent is defined by the operating frequency: as frequencies increase, the input impedance of the MOSFETs decreases.|$|E

2500|$|In 1974, Pitroda joined [...] Wescom Switching {{which was}} one of the first <b>digital</b> <b>switching</b> companies. He {{developed}} the 580 DSS switch, over nearly four years. It was released in 1978. Wescom was acquired by Rockwell International in 1980, where Pitroda became vice president. During his four decades as an engineer, Pitroda filed scores of patents in telecommunications. The latest set of patents relate to mobile phone based transaction technology, [...] both financial and non-financial, via mobile phones.|$|E
