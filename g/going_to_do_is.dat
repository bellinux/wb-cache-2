The show {{is based on the}} British comedy series of the same name, which was created by Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant for the BBC. In addition, the two are executive producers on the show. On May 11, 2012, NBC renewed The Office for a ninth season. Series developer Greg Daniels returned as showrunner this season. Daniels stated that the season would feature more big season arcs, saying [...] "I'll tell you that the last couple of years, I don't think we did any big arc-type things in the way that we used to in the beginning, I think the thing we're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> bring back a lot of arcs." [...] Brent Forrester, who had been a consulting producer and writer since the third season was promoted to executive producer, alongside new series writer Dan Sterling.|$|E
500|$|On May11, 2012, NBC renewed The Office for a ninth {{season and}} it was later {{announced}} that Greg Daniels, {{who had been the}} series showrunner from season one through five, would be returning. [...] "New Guys" [...] was written and directed by Daniels. This is his first writing credit for the series since the seventh season entry, [...] "Goodbye, Michael", and his first directing credited since season seven's [...] "PDA". This also marks the third time he has both written and directed an episode, after the first season episode [...] "Basketball" [...] and the fourth season opener, [...] "Fun Run". Daniels later revealed that [...] "New Guys" [...] would be the inception of big season arcs. He went on the record saying [...] "I'll tell you that the last couple of years, I don't think we did any big arc-type things in the way that we used to in the beginning, I think the thing we're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> bring back a lot of arcs". Jenna Fischer later stated that part of the Jim and Pam arc would be dependent on [...] "things that happened in seasons past that didn't seem very relevant at the time and [...] they're going to become important this season." ...|$|E
500|$|During the Winter Consumer Electronics Show in January 1994, Sega of America {{research}} and development head Joe Miller took a phone call in his Las Vegas hotel suite from Nakayama, in which Nakayama {{stressed the importance of}} coming up with a quick response to the Jaguar. [...] Included on this call were Bayless, Sega hardware team head Hideki Sato, and Sega of America vice president of technology Marty Franz. [...] One potential idea for this came from a concept from Sega of Japan, later known as [...] "Project Jupiter", an entirely new independent console. [...] Project Jupiter was initially slated to be {{a new version of the}} Genesis, with an upgraded color palette and a lower cost than the upcoming Saturn, as well as with some limited 3D capabilities thanks to integration of ideas from the development of the Sega Virtua Processor chip. [...] Miller suggested an alternative strategy, citing concerns with releasing a new console with no previous design specifications within six to nine months. [...] According to former Sega of America producer Michael Latham, Miller said, [...] "Oh, that's just a horrible idea. [...] If all you're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> enhance the system, you should make it an add-on. [...] If it's a new system with legitimate new software, great. [...] But if the only thing it does is double the colors...." [...] Miller, however, insists that the decision was made collectively to talk about alternative solutions. [...] One idea was to leverage the existing Genesis as a way to keep from alienating Sega customers, who would otherwise be required to discard their Genesis systems entirely to play 32-bit games, and to control the cost of the new system. [...] This would come in the form of an add-on. [...] From these discussions, Project Jupiter was discontinued and the new add-on, codenamed [...] "Project Mars", was advanced.|$|E

2500|$|The love {{triangle}} between Taylor, Ridge and Brooke {{continued into}} Ridge and Taylor's first marriage. When Brooke has Ridge's child, Bridget Forrester (Ashley Jones), Taylor helps raise the baby (although {{it was later}} revealed in 1996 that Bridget was fathered by Ridge's father Eric, not him). Speaking on Ridge's decision to remain married to Taylor, Tylo said that the actors were [...] "so sick of this triangle" [...] and revealed: [...] "One of the things Bradley's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> have Ridge pick Taylor over Brooke. For a change, instead of women breaking couples up or getting pregnant to trap a man, we're going to see how couples work through their problems." [...] After Taylor is presumed dead {{in a plane crash}} in 1994 only to return months later, Tylo felt that Taylor would be feeling [...] "quite cheated" [...] by Ridge marrying Brooke, and joked that [...] "Taylor wasn't even cold yet". Ridge and Taylor divorce, although soon become involved once more, and get back together when Ridge finds out that he fathered Taylor's son, Thomas Forrester (Adam Gregory). Ridge and Taylor remarry on June 24, 1998.|$|E

[...] "Whitey" [...] Feightner, who served with O'Hare in July 1942, later said that one of the best pieces of information O'Hare passed on to him, was [...] "If you ever jump one of these Zeros and you surprise him, remember, the first thing he's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> a loop. Don't follow him into it! By the time you go into it a second time, he'll be behind you. The first thing you should do when he starts up the loop is make a hard right turn and keep turning. You'll come right around, and when he bottoms out of the loop, you'll be right on his tail!" [...] O'Hare also related [...] "First of all, remember, in today's world, whenever you take off and engage the enemy, you're going to be outnumbered. If you want to survive this War, you have to look behind you every chance you get. Even when you pull the trigger, be sure to look behind because there's gonna be someone back there." ...|$|E

50|$|The {{policeman}} at {{the elbow}} test is a test used by some courts {{to determine whether the}} defendant was insane when he committed a crime. It is a variant of the M'Naghten Rules that addresses the situation in which the defendant knew that what he <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> wrong, but had no ability to restrain himself from doing it. The test asks whether he would have done what he did even if a policeman was standing at his elbow, hence its name.|$|R

Oh I've watched you enough, my dear friend, and I've been sorry for you--and sorry as well for myself; for I'm not so taken up with myself, in the low greedy sense, as you think. I'm not such a base creature. I'm capable of gratitude, I'm capable of affection. One may live in paint and tinsel, but one isn't absolutely without a soul. Yes, I've got one," [...] the girl went on, [...] "though I do smear my face and grin {{at myself in the}} glass and practise my intonations. If what you're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> good for you I'm very glad. If it leads to good things, to honour and fortune and greatness, I'm enchanted. If it means your being away always, for ever and ever, of course that's serious. You know it--I needn't tell you--I regard you as I really don't regard any one else. I've a confidence in you--ah it's a luxury! You're a gentleman, mon bon--ah you're a gentleman! It's just that. And then you see, you understand, and that's a luxury too. You're a luxury altogether, dear clever Mr. Sherringham. Your being where I shall never see you isn't a thing I shall enjoy; I know that from the separation of these last months--after our beautiful life in Paris, {{the best thing that ever}} happened to me or that ever will. But if it's your career, if it's your happiness--well, I can miss you and hold my tongue. I can be disinterested--I can!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mine? You don't {{mean to say}} {{you suppose}} I own it!" [...] George Flack shouted. The light {{projected}} upon her innocence by his tone {{was so strong that}} the girl blushed, and he went on more tenderly: [...] "It's a pretty sight, the way you and your sister take that sort of thing for granted. Do you think property grows on you like a moustache? Well, it seems as if it had, on your father. If I owned the Reverberator I wouldn't be stumping round here; I'd give my attention to another branch of the business. That is I'd give my attention to all, but I wouldn't go round with the delivery-cart. Still, I'm going to capture the blamed thing, and I want you to help me," [...] the young man went on; [...] "that's just what I wanted to speak to you about. It's a big proposition as it stands, but I mean to make it bigger: the most universal society-paper the world has seen. That's where the future lies, and the man who sees it first is the man who'll make his pile. It's a field for enlightened enterprise that hasn't yet begun to be worked." [...] He continued, glowing as if on a sudden with his idea, and one of his knowing eyes half-closed itself for an emphasis habitual with him when he talked consecutively. The effect of this would have been droll to a listener, the note of the prospectus mingling with the question of his more intimate hope. But it was not droll to Francie; she only thought it, or supposed it, a proof of the way Mr. Flack saw everything on a stupendous scale. [...] "There are ten thousand things to do that haven't been done, and I'm going to do them. The society-news of every quarter of the globe, furnished by the prominent members themselves--oh THEY can be fixed, you'll see!--from day to day and from hour to hour and served up hot at every breakfast-table in the United States: that's what the American people want and that's what the American people are going to have. I wouldn't say it to every one, but I don't mind telling you, that I consider my guess as good as the next man's on what's going to be required in future over there. I'm going for the inside view, the choice bits, the chronique intime, as they say here; what the people want's just what ain't told, and I'm going to tell it. Oh they're bound to have the plums! That's about played out, anyway, the idea of sticking up a sign of 'private' and 'hands off' and 'no thoroughfare' and thinking you can keep the place to yourself. You ain't going to be able any longer to monopolise any fact of general interest, and it ain't going to be right you should; it ain't {{going to continue to be}} possible to keep out anywhere the light of the Press. Now what I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> to set up the biggest lamp yet made and make it shine all over the place. We'll see who's private then, and whose hands are off, and who'll frustrate the People--the People THAT WANTS TO KNOW. That's a sign of the American people that they DO want to know, and it's the sign of George P. Flack," [...] the young man pursued with a rising spirit, [...] "that he's going to help them. But I'll make the touchy folks crowd in THEMSELVES with their information, and as I tell you, Miss Francie, it's a job in which you can give me a lovely lift." ...|$|E
60|$|The summons was to me. My {{moment had}} come, but I was {{prepared}} for it. In my last ordeal I had broken down because I had chosen a poem that {{was a kind of}} secret thing in my mind. So, after receiving Lady Pollacke's letter, I had hunted about for a recitation as short, but less personal: one, I mean, whose sentiments I didn't mind. And since Mrs Bullace had chosen two of Mrs Browning's pieces for her triumph on New Year's Eve, I argued that she knew the parish taste, and that I could do no better. Of course, too, composure over what I <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> far more important than the composition.|$|R

As she turned in, she looked down the road; but the men were not in sight. What she <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> something which people never <b>did,</b> but it <b>was</b> the only thing she could think of, and she was a girl whose actions were as quick as her ideas were original.
