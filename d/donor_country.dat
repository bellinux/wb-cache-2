25|$|Generally, DG {{work can}} be seen as taking two approaches: one views democratization as a {{political}} struggle between democrats and non-democrats and directs aid toward political processes and institutions such as elections, political parties, and civil society; and the second views democratization as a slower, longer-term process and directs aid at a wide range of political and socioeconomic sectors. In terms of implementation, <b>donor</b> <b>country</b> development agencies, such as USAID, UK Department for International Development (DFID) and the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA), design and fund programs (according to <b>donor</b> <b>country</b> interests and local needs) that are often carried out by international non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in coordination with local and international groups.|$|E

25|$|The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, {{as primary}} holders of {{developing}} countries' debt, attach structural adjustment conditionalities {{in return for}} loans which are generally geared toward loan repayment with austerity measures such as the elimination of state subsidies and the privatization of state services. For example, the World Bank presses poor nations to eliminate subsidies for fertilizer even while many farmers cannot afford them at market prices. In Malawi, almost five million of its 13 million people used to need emergency food aid but after the government changed policy and subsidies for fertilizer and seed were introduced, farmers produced record-breaking corn harvests in 2006 and 2007 as Malawi became a major food exporter. A major proportion of aid from donor nations is tied, mandating that a receiving nation spend on products and expertise originating only from the <b>donor</b> <b>country.</b> US law requires food aid be spent on buying food at home, instead of where the hungry live, and, as a result, half of what is spent is used on transport.|$|E
2500|$|In 2006 Brazil {{proposed}} a direct finance route {{to deal with}} the Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation in Developing Countries, or REDD, issue, recognizing that deforestation contributes to 20 percent of the world's greenhouse gas emissions. The competing proposal for the REDD issue is a carbon emission credit system, where reduced deforestation would receive [...] "marketable emissions credits". In effect, developed countries could reduce their carbon emissions, and approach their emissions quota by investing in the reforestation of developing rainforest countries. Instead, Brazil's 2006 proposal would draw from a fund based upon <b>donor</b> <b>country</b> contributors.|$|E

50|$|Tied aid {{is defined}} as project aid {{contracted}} by source to private firms in the <b>donor</b> <b>country.</b> It refers to aid tied to goods and services supplied exclusively by <b>donor</b> <b>country</b> businesses or agencies.

The benefit of this system is in its flexibility. Frontloading aid, on the other hand, as proposed by the IFF proposal, has the benefit of smoothing out the flows over time. In the model presented in this paper, <b>donor</b> <b>countries</b> balance these two contract schemes to determine the endorsement or rejection of the IFF proposal.
