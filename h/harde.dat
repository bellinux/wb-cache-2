30|$|The {{bactericidal}} {{effect of}} metal ions, especially copper and silver ions, {{is a well}} known phenomenon which has been recognized for centuries (Dollwet and Sorenson 1985). Pure copper and silver films have to be discussed critically in orthopedic and trauma surgery where tissue integration is essential for permanent implants, because the permanent long-term release of ions may result in reduced tissue integration of the implant and a pronounced “immuno-incompetent fibro-inflammatory zone” (Gristina 1994). Modification of the biocompatible TiO 2 -coating by copper incorporation is hence only one possibility to create antibacterial properties. In this respect, amongst others silver-coated orthopaedic implants have been studied. In animal experiments {{as well as in}} a prospective clinical trial a reduced infection rate was thereby observed (<b>Hardes</b> et al. 2010; Gosheger et al. 2004). However, this very silver coating may not be applied to the prosthetic stem, i.e. the anchoring parts of the prosthesis (<b>Hardes</b> et al. 2010). On the other hand, with the presented copper-loaded TiO 2 surface coating, infection prevention could be achieved in the perioperative period, combined with excellent biocompatibility that allows coating of implant parts made for implant fixation in bone and other tissues. Furthermore, the remaining biocompatible surface coating could improve immuno-competence at the interface between implant and host tissue reducing both the risk for infection and aseptic loosening (Gristina 1994).|$|R

To our knowledge this procedure has not been reported in patients over 60 years before. Materials and Methods. 3 patients over 60 years with an A 1 -rotationplasty because of a sarcoma were included in this study. Complications and functional results were recorded. In one patient an electromyography was done. Results. Despite electromyography showing good adaptation of the muscles to the altered function, the functional results of these three patients were limited. two out of three patients needed a cane for walking distances over 200 meters. No secondary amputation was necessary. Discussion. Our study demonstrates that rotationplasty is an alternative to an above-knee amputation in older patients but with poorer functional results in comparison to younger patients. However, limb-salvage surgery should be preferred whenever possible. Copyright © 2008 Jendrik <b>Hardes</b> et al.

30|$|Limb-salvage in {{pediatric}} patients poses {{an additional}} challenge compared to adults {{due to the}} presence of an open physis. In order to obtain a wide surgical margin, the growing physis must often be removed, creating a limb-length discrepancy. Lewis published one of the first reports on the use of expandable endoprostheses to help minimize limb length discrepancy (Lewis 1986; Kenan and Lewis 1991). These designs incorporated the use of a screw extension mechanism, where a chuck key would be inserted through an incision to expand the length of the prosthesis and thus the extremity, while later methods utilized modular body segments to achieve lengthening, requiring open surgical procedures (Lewis 1986; Kenan and Lewis 1991; Eckardt et al. 2000; Neel and Letson 2001). Jeys reported on periprosthetic infections in orthopaedic oncology conditions and found the use of expandable prostheses in children as a significant risk factor with a rate of 18  %, (p =  0.007), and that infection was increased as much as 5  % per lengthening procedure (Jeys et al. 2005). In order to accurately address limb surgery in children with sarcomas the authors feel they should mention two other techniques, amputation and arthroplasty. The former has few surgical side effects with decreased functional scores (Eckardt et al. 1985; Simon et al. 1986). Rotationplasty in the growing child has excellent function with few surgical complications (<b>Hardes</b> et al. 2003).

6000|$|Stratagems, {{such as that}} of Maitland, were {{frequently}} practised with success, in consequence of the complete armour worn by the knights of the middle ages. In 1359, Edward III. entered France, to improve the success of the battle of Poictiers. Two French knights, Sir Galahaut of Rybamont, and Sir Roger of Cologne, rode forth, with their followers, to survey the English host, and, in short, to seek adventures. It chanced that they met a foraging party of Germans, retained in King Edward's service, under the command of Reynold of Boulant, a knight of that nation. By the counsel of a squire of his retinue, Sir Galahaut joined company with the German knight, under the assumed character of Bartholomew de Bonne, Reynold's countryman, and fellow soldier in the English service. The French knights [...] "were a 70 men of armes, and Sir Renolde had not past a 30; and, whan Sir Renolde saw theym, he displayed his baner befor hym, and came softely rydynge towarde theym, wenyng to hym that they had been Englyshemen.

Sir Galahaut helde hymselfe styll secrete, and answered but fayntly, and sayd, 'let us ryde forth;' and so rode on, and hys men, on the one syde, and the Almaygnes on the other. Whan Sir Renolde of Boulant sawe theyr maner, and howe Sir Galahaut rode sometyme by hym, and spake no word, than he began to suspecte. And he had not so ryden, the space of a quarter of an hour, but he stode styll, under his baner, among hys men, and sayd, 'Sir, I have dout what knyght ye be. I thynke ye be nat Sir Bartylmewe, for I knowe hym well; and I see well that yt ys nat you. I woll ye telle me your name, or I ryde any farter in your company.' Therwith Sir Galahaut lyft up hys vyser, and rode towardes the knyght to have taken hym by the raygne of hys brydell, and cryed, 'Our Ladye of Rybamont!' than Sir Roger of Coloyne sayd, 'Coloyne to the rescue!'[95] Whan Sir Renolde of Boulant sawe what case he was in, he was nat gretly afrayed, but drewe out his sworde; and, as Sir Galahaut wolde have taken hym by the brydell, Sir Renolde put his sworde clene through hym, and drue agayne hys sworde out of hym, and toke his horse, with the spurres, and left Sir Galahaut sore hurt. And, whan Sir Galahautes men sawe theyr master in that case, they were sore dyspleased, and set on Sir Renolde's men; there were many cast to the yerth, but as sone as Sir Renolde had gyven Sir Galahaut that stroke, he strak hys horse with the spurres, and toke the feldes.

40|$|Monopile {{foundations}} is {{the most}} popular foundation type for offshore wind turbines, with over 80 % of the substructures being monopile foundations. When placed in a marine environment monopiles is prone to scour around the pile. This can influence the eigenfrequency of the wind turbine, which is a major design driver. To prevent scouring it is possible to place scour protection around the pile, normally consisting of a filter and armor layer. The effect of scour protection has been investigated with a 3 D-FEM analysis in Plaxis with a real size model with characteristic properties for a monopile pile placed in sand. <b>Hardeing</b> Soil Small (HSS) soil model has been used for the sand. The results from the simulations have been used to calculate p-y curves representing the soil response along the pile. Three different cases have been investigated, 1) a benchmark case without scour protection, 2) scour protection as surface load and 3) a full scour protection layer. The lateral load on the monopile were divided into 5 load steps, 10 kN, 100 kN, 1000 kN, 2000 kN and 5000 kN. Also, a simple 1 -DOF approximation has been used to compare the eigenfrequencies of the three cases. The results from the simulations show a 1 % increase in eigenfrequency for the case with surface load at load step 100 kN and the case with a full scour protection layer show 10 % increase in eigenfrequency. Also, a comparison with DNV/API design codes for p-y curves have been done for the benchmark case, giving a good match for shallow depths, but for larger depths the DNV/API formulations give higher stiffness. This is mainly due to the linear increase in stiffness with depth in the DNV/API formulations where HSS have parabolic increase with dept...|$|R

Objectives: To evaluate the effect of severe renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of umeclidinium and umeclidinium/vilanterol. Methods: Nine patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min) and nine matched healthy volunteers received a single dose of umeclidinium 125 µg; and after a 7 - to 14 -day washout, a single dose of umeclidinium/vilanterol 125 / 25 µg. Results: No clinically relevant increases in plasma umeclidinium or vilanterol systemic exposure (area under the curve or maximum observed plasma concentration) were observed following umeclidinium 125 µg or umeclidinium/vilanterol 125 / 25 µg administration. On average, the amount of umeclidinium excreted in 24 hours in urine (90 % confidence interval) was 88 % (81 %– 93 %) and 89 % (81 %– 93 %) lower in patients with severe renal impairment compared with healthy volunteers following umeclidinium 125 µg and umeclidinium/vilanterol 125 / 25 µg administration, respectively. Treatments were well tolerated in both populations. Conclusion: Umeclidinium 125 µg or umeclidinium/vilanterol 125 / 25 µg administration to patients with severe renal impairment did not demonstrate clinically relevant increases in systemic exposure compared with healthy volunteers.

30|$|Staphylococci {{are most}} {{frequently}} implicated as the etiologic agents (Zimmerli and Ochsner 2003; Hunter and Dandy 1977). Prevention of these infections has an important impact not only on patient’s morbidity {{but also on the}} cost effectiveness of hospital care (Gosheger et al. 2004). Systemic antibiotic prophylaxis and various local antibiotic delivery techniques have been proven to reduce the rate of infection (Gollwitzer et al. 2003; Schmidmaier et al. 2006). Hereby locally applied antibiotics are advantageous in delivering high drug concentrations to the required site without producing systemic toxicity (Zhang et al. 2014). Because pathogens involved in implant associated infections are diverse and bacteria in biofilms are protected from antibiotics (Ceri et al. 1999), the restricted activity of these substances limits their clinical effectiveness, especially in infections involving antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains (e.g. MRSA) (Liu et al. 2012). Therefore, alternatives to local antibiotic delivery systems are highly favored. In this context employment of implant materials or coatings that control infection and biofilm formation would be particularly advantageous (Schmidmaier et al. 2006). This {{led to the development of}} antiadhesive and non-antibiotic antibacterial surfaces. The first mentioned coatings (e.g. polyethylene glycol, polyethylene oxide brushes) reduce bacterial adhesion by altering the physicochemical properties of the substrate. Thus, formation of protein surface layers (conditioning films) on the implant and bacteria–substrate interactions are hindered (Hetrick and Schoenfisch 2006). This mode of action is referred to as ‘‘passive’’. However the effectiveness of these coatings for reducing bacterial adhesion is very limited and varies greatly depending on bacterial species. Additionally, osseointegration is poor. In sum, the importance of these antiadhesive coatings in orthopedic surgery is limited. In contrast non-antibiotic “active” antibacterial coatings release antibacterial agents, e.g. silver ions (Ag+), copper ions (Cu++), nitric oxide, chlorhexidine/chloroxylenol or chitosan (Kumar and Munstedt 2005; <b>Hardes</b> et al. 2007; Gosheger et al. 2004; Shirai et al. 2009). Compared to antibiotics these agents act more broadly against a wide range of bacteria. In addition, at least proven for the use of Ag+, microbes without intrinsic resistance cannot gain resistance (Kumar and Munstedt 2005; Lee et al. 2005).|$|R

30|$|Ag {{seems to}} be of {{outstanding}} value in the prevention and treatment of implant associated infections (Morones et al. 2005; Taglietti et al. 2012; <b>Hardes</b> et al. 2010). Ag acts by binding to membranes, enzymes and nucleic acids. Consequently the respiratory chain is inhibited and therefore the aerobe metabolism of microorganisms disturbed (Gosheger et al. 2004). Bacteria are quite susceptible to Ag with only negligible possibility of intrinsic resistance (Kumar and Munstedt 2005). Antibacterial effects {{have been reported to}} be directly proportional to Ag concentrations and therefore directly depend on Ag release into the surrounding environment (Schierholz et al. 1998; Morones et al. 2005). These findings were confirmed in the present study (Table  1). In this context, important properties of the tested coatings could be identified: it was found that antimicrobial efficacy on the surface of Ag-DLC-PE treated with high energies of ion implantation (60 – 100  keV) was only significant in samples treated with ion energies of 60  keV. No bactericidal effect in this setting was determined in the surrounding medium. From a physical point of view this is not surprising since high ion energies determine a rather deep implantation of Ag preventing the atoms from release into the surrounding medium. This “deep depositioning” effect of DLC surfaces on ions implanted with high energies has already been described in the literature in other materials than PE (Furno et al. 2004). Compared to native PE we found Ag-DLC-PE treated with high implantation energies (100  keV) to be even more susceptible for bacterial colonization. This finding is surprising, since DLC coatings of other materials than PE (e.g. steel, PVC) showed significant antibacterial potency in several investigations (Baba et al. 2013; Katsikogianni et al. 2006; Marciano et al. 2009). In consequence, low ion energies (10  keV) were used in the second testing group. The results showed clearly, that antibacterial potency increased with lower ion energies due to the deposition of Ag proximate to the surface and a therefore potentially higher concentration of released Ag+. Therefore an increased antimicrobial effect was determined not only on the surface but also in the surrounding medium. To identify which of the parameters (ion energy or fluence) might have major impact on Ag+ dissolution and consequently the antimicrobial effect of the coating the third testing group with rearranged sample features was conducted. We found a strong dependency of antibacterial activity and the fluence of Ag+ in the coatings. This led to the conclusion, that ion energy plays a minor role as long as low energies (e.g. 10 or 20  keV) are applied during Ag+ implantation.|$|R
30|$|In {{order to}} {{decrease}} the infection and especially reinfection rate several methods have been developed, at which rising occurrences of antibiotic resistances among bacteria make antibiotic-based strategies more and more questionable (Jamsen et al. 2010; Schmidmaier et al. 2006; Hetrick and Schoenfisch 2006; Poelstra et al. 2000). In this context alternative methods are favored. Promising could be the use of non-antibiotic “active” antibacterial coatings which release antibacterial agents, e.g. silver ions (Ag+) (Gosheger et al. 2004; <b>Hardes</b> et al. 2007; Harrasser et al. 2015), copper ions (Cu++) (Shirai et al. 2009; Baena et al. 2006), nitric oxide (Holt et al. 2011; Nablo et al. 2005), chlorhexidine/chloroxylenol (Darouiche et al. 1998) or chitosan (Bumgardner et al. 2003). Compared to antibiotics these agents act more broadly against {{a wide range of}} bacteria. In addition, at least proven for the use of silver (Ag), microbes without intrinsic resistance cannot gain resistance (Lee et al. 2005). Information on the use of these bactericidal coatings on wear surfaces and direct bone contact is lacking since Ag-coatings have been used so far only on surfaces without direct bone or joint contact. This fact is important, given that, e.g. in total knee replacement roughly 50  % of the surface is exposed to synovial fluid and in main parts tribologically active. On the other hand, revision prostheses are usually composed of large stems applied intramedullary which additionally represent a vulnerable surface area for bacterial contamination. To summarize, in septic revision surgery a relevant portion of the susceptible prosthesis is not protected against bacterial reinfection. Antibacterial-agent-enriched diamond-like carbon (DLC) coatings may solve this dilemma. The term DLC is used to describe hydrogen-free carbon solids that contain an amorphous network of tetrahedrally and trigonally hybridized carbon atoms with physical properties tending to be intermediate between those of graphite and those of diamond (Dearnaley 1993). DLC is an ideal surface coating for prosthetic joints, because it is wear resistant, atomically smooth, and corrosion resistant, has a low friction coefficient, and is immune to scratching by third body wear particles (Morrison et al. 2006). Therefore, if DLC coating is applied on titanium (Ti), a material not used for wear surfaces due to its high sensitivity to contact wear and fretting corrosion, it improves its wear resistance and makes it suitable for tribologically loaded joint parts (Firkins et al. 1998). Additionally, DLC coating can improve the osseointegration of titanium making it even more valuable for orthopedic applications (Mändl et al. 2001). Another property of this coating is the ability {{to use it as a}} carrier for ions, e.g. Ag+. By release of Ag+, DLC coatings on Ti can act as local antibacterial agents, and therefore extend its medical implications to septic revision surgery (Cloutier et al. 2014; Katsikogianni et al. 2006; Dwivedi et al. 2013). DLC coatings are not without limitations since structural properties can vary widely depending on the deposition techniques employed. One of the greatest challenges of DLC technology is adhesion and internal stresses (Xu and Pruitt 1999). Several DLC technologies are described, at which DLC films usually are deposited on surfaces. The bonding strength between coating and surface seems to be the weakest point (Walter et al. 1997). If the DLC layers tend to dissolve from the surface positive tribological features can quickly deteriorate leading to high grade wear (Roy and Lee 2007). This could be conflicting if DLC coated Ti was used on wear surfaces. On the other hand, methods of DLC coating with strong linking to the sample surface are described (Liu et al. 2004). Thus, the risk of detachment of the DLC coating from the surface, even under shear forces is minimized (Schwarz and Stritzker 2010; Popa et al. 2013). In this context, among the techniques described for the synthesis of DLC coatings a modified method of plasma immersion ion implantation (PIII) has proven promising advantages (Schwarz and Stritzker 2010).|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{prediction}} of early age cracking caused by restrained temperature dilation and autogenous deformation. Traditonally, prediction of early-age cracking {{has been based}} on temperature criteria. The temperature criteria alone are, however, not sufficiently accurate for cracking prediction. Stress-strain criteria are more reliable because they consider all the crucial factors: thermal dilation, autogenous deformaion, mechanical properties and restraint condtions. The purpose of this dr. ing. project is to extend the general appliicability of stress/srain based curing technology, and to contribute to better understanding and better prediction of stresses during <b>hardeing</b> of concrete structures. In {{the first part of the}} thesis the major features of hardening concrete are described and mathematical descriptions of the phenomena are given. Different models are discussed, and on the basis of such discussion, new models have been implemented in the FE program DIANA. First, the equivalent time was introduced in parallel to the degree of hydration, so that all material properties may be considered equivalent-time dependent. it is shown that the simpler and more common equivelent-time based model for the heat of hydration development can describe temperature development with the same accurancy as the degree of hydration based model. Further, the activation energy is made temperature depentent instead of being constant. A modified CEB equation for E. modulus development is implemented. The temperature influence on creep is modified by introducing a thermal transitonal creep term. A mathematical decription of stress-and strain development in hardening concrete structures is presented, and special attention given to the viscoelastic behavior of concrete. The influence of creep on Self-induced stresses is examined. The emphasis is put on creep importance in different periods of the hardening process. In externally restrained structures, prone to through cracking, creep in the early period (heating phase) reduces the compressive stresses, and consequently increases the tensile stresses in the subsequent cooling period, thus increasing the cracking risk. For internally restrained structures, prone to surface cracking in the early period, creep obviosly reduces the cracking risk. In the cooling phase creep reduces the tensile stresses. For externally restrained structures, the effects of creep in the cooling and heating phases are counteracting, and in some cases they annul each other. The present results do not diminish the importance of creep on thermal stresses, to the contrary, it emphasises the necessity of correct prediction of creep during the whole period of hardening. Three creep models for young concrete are compared: Double Power Law, Maxwell chain model and Burgers model. The models are calibrated against the same experimental data and used in calculation of therimal stresses. The temperature dependency of the models is also investigated. A good agreement between the Double Power Law and the Maxwell Chain was obtained, wheras the Burgers model, which consists of one Kelvin unit and one viscous damper, gave different results. Although the major reason for the deviation is due to the simplicity of the Burgers model, the deviation is also coused by differnt descriptions of the temperature dependence, and the nature of the test data used in the calibration. Test methods are also discussed, with special weight on the Temperature Stress Testing Machine tests. Although this type of test is indispensible, and very useful to check the validity of the material models and the calculation methods, the shortcomings by using it to predict the creep model parameters are also shown. Restraint conditions and their influlence on thermal stresses were also investigated. Different ways of modelling the structure and the interaction with the subgrade were analysed and compared. Influence of the stiffness of the ground and the structural geometry on thermal stresses and cracking risk was investigated by means of 3 D analyses. The last part of the work is numerical simulation of temperature and stress/strain development in real structure, the Maridal culvert in Olso. A comprehensive laboratory test program was performed at NTNU to identify material parameters. Both thermal and mechanical properaties were tested. Material models were checked in the TSTM for three different realistic temperature histories. Within the Brite-Euram project IPACS a large field instrumentation programme has been carried out to measure temperature and strain development in the culvert. 3 D analysis of the foundations and walls in two of the instrumented sections of this structure were performed with DIANA and calculated results are compared to measurements. Deviation between calculated and measured temperature is within range of ± 5 0 C. Deviation between calculated and measured strains is about ± 50 x 10 - 6. Possible reasons of disagreement between calculations and measurements are discussed. When all uncertainties in materail modelling and measuring methods are sonsidered it is concluded that results of the simulation are satisfying. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|R
