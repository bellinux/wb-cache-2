Larvae do not eat the hard kernels, but take bites out of many kernels, lowering the quality of the corn for processing.|$|E

By the middle of the 19th century, touring companies had taken this music not only to <b>every</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the United States, but also to the UK, Western Europe, and even to Africa and Asia.

5|$|The two neurotransmitters {{that are}} used most widely in the {{vertebrate}} brain are glutamate, which almost always exerts excitatory effects on target neurons, and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), which is almost always inhibitory.

Because of their ubiquity, drugs that act on glutamate or GABA tend to have broad and powerful effects. Some general anesthetics act by reducing the effects of glutamate; most tranquilizers exert their sedative effects by enhancing the effects of GABA.|$|E
