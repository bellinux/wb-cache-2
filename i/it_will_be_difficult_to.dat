She notes that in the quiet of the night, despite falsehoods and tears, she can feel satisfaction by touching herself. By stroking herself and perhaps her metaphorical wolf-pelt, Gaga is engaging {{in a moment of}} self-acceptance and self-soothing. Lady Gaga realizes that <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> maintain her dualistic nature, and alludes to upcoming death when she tells audiences that she is so content that she would welcome death. These words appear to foreshadow the end of , as the singer alludes to a calm acceptance of her spiritual/ghostly side.|$|E

At the lunch, Rivers realises <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> {{convince}} Sassoon {{to return to the}} war and does not want to force him. Later, Owen convinces Sassoon to publish his poetry in the hospital magazine The Hydra. During this time, Prior meets Sarah in town and explains why he missed their meetings. Reconciled, they take a train to the seaside and walk along the beach together, where he feels relieved, though he is distracted thinking about the plight of fellow soldiers. Caught in a storm, he and Sarah have sex while sheltering in a bush. Meanwhile, Rivers, exhausted by the taxing work of caring for the shell shocked soldiers, is ordered by his superiors to holiday for three weeks away from Craiglockhart. Rivers' departure resurrects Sassoon's feelings of abandonment when his father left him, and he realises that Rivers has taken the place of his father.|$|E

25|$|The test {{requiring}} {{an immediate}} danger never matched the practical realities facing individuals where {{the consequences of}} a refusal to marry might not be immediate, but nevertheless serious. In Hirani v Hirani (1982) 4 FLR 332, the Court of Appeal considered the case of a nineteen-year-old Hindu woman who was dating a Muslim man. Her parents told the petitioner that unless she married a Hindu of their choosing, she would be ostracized socially from her family and left to fend for herself. Under the circumstances, the Court agreed that the petitioner had acted without full consent in marrying her parents' choice of husband. Thus, it is for the courts of all countries {{to strike a balance between}} well-intentioned parental authority to arrange marriages in the face of a reluctant child, and unreasonable threats that would overbear the will of any reasonable person, while maintaining the trust of local communities whose cultures have included arranged marriages for centuries. As to transnational recognition, <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> disturb the validity of the marriage if no complaint of coercion was made around the time the ceremony was performed in the lex loci celebrationis or immediately the parties entered the state where proceedings were commenced. It would be more usual to use the local divorce system to terminate the relationship.|$|E
25|$|It is {{just before}} dawn. Four priests are {{mourning}} {{the death of}} King Séthos. They wish he had died an honourable death in battle, but the terrible truth {{is that he was}} murdered by the brother he loved. Dawn breaks as Queen Nephté arrives with her young son to pay tribute to her dead husband. Nephté says that it is only the thought of her child which keeps her alive, otherwise life is barren for her without Séthos. She asks the priests to reveal who killed him. When the arrival of her brother-in-law Pharès is announced, the priests are horrified and Nephté begins to suspect he is the murderer. Pharès tries to flatter Nephté. He also claims it was Séthos' dying wish that he should become her new husband. Nephté admits this is true but she thinks it wrong to talk of marriage while Séthos is still unavenged. However, Pharès seems reluctant to search for the assassin, but at Nephté's insistence he finally agrees to swear on his brother's tomb that he will bring the criminal to justice. The priests are shocked at this sacrilege. After Pharès has left, the chief priest Amédès reveals what Nephté has suspected: Pharès is the killer. Nephté demands vengeance, but she also fears for her son's safety. Amédès agrees to hide the boy among the tombs. He says <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> get revenge because Pharès is both respected and feared by the Egyptians. The temple opens as the statesmen and common people arrive for Séthos' funeral rites. The temple girls reveal that Sethos is now an immortal in heaven. Nephté implores the Egyptians to avenge her husband. They swear on the altar to do so. Amédès says he will reveal the murderer's name that evening.|$|E
500|$|Due to the {{difficulties}} {{with the two}} larger coins, little attention {{was given to the}} half eagle and quarter eagle until late 1907. [...] On November 28, 1907, Treasury Secretary George Cortelyou wrote in a letter that the double eagle design was to be used for the two small gold pieces. [...] On December 2, Mint Director Frank Leach instructed the Philadelphia Mint to prepare coinage dies for the small pieces, using the double eagle design. [...] Chief Engraver Charles E. Barber replied [...] a week later that {{it would be difficult to}} put all the legends that were required by law on the new pieces, such as the name of the country. [...] On the double eagle, [...] "E Pluribus Unum" [...] is placed on the edge, an impractical setting on pieces about the size of the nickel and dime. [...] Philadelphia Mint Superintendent John Landis forwarded Barber's letter to Leach with his own note, stating, [...] "I know <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> put the inscription 'E Pluribus Unum' on the periphery of a quarter eagle, but I do not see where else it can [...] and we must try to do it".|$|E

500|$|Professor Shiela Bird, a {{statistician}} at the Medical Research Council, {{suggested the}} ban of mephedrone {{may lead to}} more cocaine-related deaths. In {{the first six months}} of 2009, the number of cocaine-related deaths fell for the first time in four years, and fewer soldiers tested positive for cocaine in 2009 than in 2008. She suggested this may have been due to users switching to mephedrone from cocaine, but cautioned that before full figures are available for 2009 and 2010, <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> determine whether mephedrone saved lives, rather than cost them. Other supposedly legal drugs have filled the gap in the market since mephedrone was made illegal, including naphyrone (NRG-1) (since made illegal) and Ivory Wave, which has been found to contain MDPV, a compound made illegal at the same time as mephedrone. However, some products branded as Ivory Wave possibly do not contain MDPV. When tested, some products sold six weeks after mephedrone was banned, advertised as NRG-1, NRG-2 and MDAI, were found to be mephedrone. A Drugscope survey of drugs workers at the end of 2012 reported that mephedrone use was still widespread in the UK and that there increasing reports of problematic users. It was being taken as not only a [...] "poor man's cocaine" [...] but also amongst users of heroin and crack cocaine. Cases of intravenous use were also reported to be on the increase.|$|E

2500|$|Son-Rise is a home-based {{program that}} {{emphasizes}} on implementing a color- and sensory-free playroom. Before implementing the home-based program, an institute trains the parents how {{to accept their}} child without judgment {{through a series of}} dialogue sessions. Like Floortime, parents join their child's ritualistic behavior for relationship-building. To gain the child's [...] "willing engagement", the facilitator continues to join them only this time through parallel play. Proponents claim that children will become non-autistic after parents accept them for who they are and engage them in play. The program was started by the parents of Raun Kaufman, who is claimed to have gone from being autistic to normal via the treatment in the early 1970s. No independent study has tested the efficacy of the program, but a 2003 study found that involvement with the program led to more drawbacks than benefits for the involved families over time, and a 2006 study found that the program is not always implemented as it is typically described in the literature, which suggests <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> evaluate its efficacy.|$|E

2500|$|Cerebellum issues causing {{dystonia}} {{is described}} by Filip et al. 2013: [...] "Although dystonia has traditionally been regarded as a basal ganglia dysfunction, recent provocative evidence has emerged of cerebellar involvement in the pathophysiology of this enigmatic disease. It {{has been suggested that}} the cerebellum {{plays an important role in}} dystonia etiology, from neuroanatomical research of complex networks showing that the cerebellum is connected to a wide range of other central nervous system structures involved in movement control to animal models indicating that signs of dystonia are due to cerebellum dysfunction and completely disappear after cerebellectomy, and finally to clinical observations in secondary dystonia patients with various types of cerebellar lesions. It is proposed that dystonia is a large-scale dysfunction, involving not only cortico-basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical pathways, but the cortico-ponto-cerebello-thalamo-cortical loop as well. Even in the absence of traditional [...] "cerebellar signs" [...] in most dystonia patients, there are more subtle indications of cerebellar dysfunction.

2500|$|A typical {{passage of}} rugby union takes the {{following}} form. [...] Unlike rugby league and gridiron football, {{possession of the}} ball in rugby union is contestable at all times by both teams [...] there is no separate 'offense' and 'defense'. [...] The team which has possession of the ball {{at any given time}} will normally try to keep it, while the other team will try to recapture it, or at least deny the team in possession the chance to attack and/or force it to kick the ball away or commit an error. [...] One team will initially gain possession of the ball, either from the kick-off, a restart kick or a set piece (scrum and line-out, see below). The need to maintain possession means the team with the ball will usually seek to progress towards the opposition by running forward while carrying the ball; although if there are few opportunities to attack they may choose to kick the ball forward, from the hand, usually giving it back to the opposition but in a position from where <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> attack. The ball may be thrown from one player to another (passing) but must not be thrown forward, that is towards the opposition dead-ball line. [...] Any teammate ahead of the ball-carrier is offside and must not interfere with play. [...] So American football style-blocking is forbidden, although tackling or obstructing a player who does not have the ball is against the laws anyway, whether or not the tackling player is offside. [...] The team not in possession attempts to stop the ball-carrier by grabbing and bringing them to ground (a tackle). [...] A tackled player, once having been brought to ground, must immediately pass or release the ball, allowing the two teams to contest possession of the loose ball; if the attacking player is tackled but the tackler releases the ball carrier the ball carrier may get up and continue the play. [...] Play does not stop unless there is an infringement of the Laws, the ball/ball-carrier leaves the field of play, the ball becomes unplayable after a tackle, or the attacking team scores points by either touching the ball over the goal-line (a try) or drop-kicking the ball over the crossbar. [...] If the ball or ball-carrier goes into touch (out of the field of play), the game restarts with a line-out. If the game stops due to an infringement, play restarts with either a scrum, free kick or penalty kick (depending {{on the nature of the}} infringement) to the non-infringing team.|$|E
