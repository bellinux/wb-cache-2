Abu-Ya'la al-Hamza ibn al-Qasim ibn Ali ibn Hamza ibn al-Hasan ibn Ubaidullah ibn al-Abbas ibn Ali {{was one of the most}} celebrated men of knowledge. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>great</b> hadithist who instructed many famed scholars and wrote many books, such as Kitab ut-Tawhid, Kitab uz-Ziyaraatu wel-Menasik, and many others in various fields of knowledge, especially in Ilm ur-Rijal and Ilm ul-Hadith. Many scholars described him with remarkable words of praise.

25|$|In early 2005, {{the band}} started {{recording}} Howling Bells at Parr Street Studios in Liverpool. Some of Coldplay's equipment from the X sessions {{was still in}} the facility when Howling Bells arrived. They recorded Howling Bells in two to three months, with all the main vocal and instrument tracking done in real time, as if in a live setting. This was a staple of Nelson's recording approach. Due to the personal significance of her songs, Juanita had the studio lights turned off {{in order to make the}} recording experience feel more private. The band appreciated Nelson's techniques and studio abilities. They stated that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>great</b> sonically and very adept at de-emphasising some songs that they had initially approached overzealously. They also expressed that they felt fortunate to have had the opportunity to work with the award-winning producer.|$|E

After Linda died, Paul stated in the Daily Mail, [...] "I got a counsellor because I knew that I would need some help. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>great,</b> particularly in helping me get rid of my guilt [...] perfect all the time... a real bugger. But then I thought, hang on a minute. We're just human. That was the beautiful thing about our marriage. We were just a boyfriend and girlfriend having babies." ...|$|E
500|$|Agârbiceanu entered {{literary}} {{life as a}} poet—according to his Sămănătorul patron, Nicolae Iorga, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>great</b> as {{the author}} of ballades. Later in his career, he focused on vignettes (often prose poems), short stories and novels, intended to represent daily life in the Apuseni Mountains. His favorite theme was the life of a Transylvanian country priest {{at the turn of the}} 20th century, but his [...] "gallery" [...] of protagonists also included shepherds, foresters, rafters, thieves, teachers, village doctors, Romani metalworkers, and the rich industrialists ("Transylvanian nawabs"). A prolific writer, possibly the most productive one in Romania before 1930, he completed some 65 volumes, by his own account, both long and short.|$|E

500|$|Baywatch and Knight Rider actor David Hasselhoff made a cameo in the live-action scenes, {{offering}} SpongeBob and Patrick {{a ride to}} Bikini Bottom. The {{scene was}} originally written before consulting Hasselhoff. Hillenburg {{was pleased with the}} storyboards; Lead storyboard artist Sherm Cohen said, [...] "He had been wrestling with the ending for quite a while, and finally he was ready to pitch his ideas to some of the other board artists." [...] Hillenburg was counting on casting Hasselhoff, and the first question he asked him was [...] "So, do we have Hasselhoff?" [...] He replied [...] "No", with a grin. Hasselhoff eventually agreed, before seeing the script. Hillenburg said about the actor, [...] "He's a great guy <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>great</b> at making fun of himself." ...|$|E
500|$|Carter said of {{the casting}} of Nick Chinlund as Pfaster, [...] "I {{thought it was a}} wonderfully creepy villain. The casting of that show was very difficult. We saw many actors, but there was a quality I was looking for and I couldn't put a name on that quality. I finally figured out what it was when Nick came in and he had a kind of {{androgynous}} quality that worked. I thought he looked like Joe College, but he could scare the hell out of you." [...] Producer Glen Morgan said Chinlund's performance was outstanding. Nutter stated [...] "Nick Chinlund was wonderful to work with. The guy was like putty in my hands. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>great.</b> If you're looking for someone to underline the weirdness and strangeness of the character, he did that." ...|$|E
500|$|As a bowler, Macaulay {{fulfilled}} two roles. At {{the start}} of an innings, when the ball was new and hard, he opened the bowling with medium-fast deliveries that swung away from right-handed batsmen. In this style, he was very accurate and bowled a variety of deliveries to unsettle his opponents. Cricket writer R. C. Robertson-Glasgow considered him {{to be better than}} any similar bowler in the 1920s except Maurice Tate, the leading medium paced bowler in England. Macaulay could vary his pace from medium to fast depending on the needs of the match situation and the type of pitch. When the pitch was suitable for spinning the ball, he bowled medium-paced off breaks. Wisden said that his spin made him more effective than other bowlers of his speed on a sticky wicket, a pitch which has been affected by rain, making it erratic and difficult to bat on. His obituary further stated: [...] "Under suitable conditions for using the off-break, batsmen seemed at his mercy." [...] This was because he could bowl deliveries which were almost impossible for batsmen to play without getting out, {{but at the same time}} it was very difficult to score runs against him. Robertson-Glasgow wrote that [...] "on a rain-damaged pitch he was in his glory." [...] He would make small adjustments to the positions of his fielders or bowl from different sides of the wicket, often making gestures or facial expressions as he did so. Robertson-Glasgow said that [...] "only the best could survive the onslaught except by a miracle", and described Macaulay as a great bowler. The cricket writer Jim Kilburn suggested that Macaulay was [...] "a great cricketer. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>great</b> not so much in mathematical accomplishment... as in cricketing character." ...|$|E

2500|$|Flair {{has also}} had {{problems}} with Mick Foley. In his 1999 autobiography , Foley said that [...] "Flair {{was every bit as}} bad on the booking side of things as <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>great</b> on the wrestling side of it". This was in reference to how poorly Foley thought he was booked during his WCW career when Flair was on the booking committee. Flair responded in his autobiography by writing: [...] "I do not care how many thumbtacks Mick Foley has fallen on, how many ladders he's fallen off, how many continents he's supposedly bled on, he will always be known as a glorified stuntman". However, they have reconciled and are now friends.|$|E
2500|$|In {{a tribute}} to McManaman, four years {{after he left the}} club, ex-coach Vicente del Bosque told Spanish {{newspaper}} AS Marca, that McManaman and Geremi were the two most important players in his squad, because [...] "together they kept the whole team united". Del Bosque added, [...] "I was very happy with Macca. He was a caballero, a gentleman, a stupendous guy; he always had a smile, he never complained, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>great,</b> a leader.

2500|$|Whittlesey was {{the first}} (1984) to {{formulate}} and popularize a quote that entered political parlance about Ginger Rogers and Fred Astaire that is often attributed to her: [...] "Ginger Rogers did everything Fred Astaire did, except backwards and in high heels." [...] The official [...] attributes {{the origin of the}} quote to Bob Thaves who wrote in a 1982 Frank and Ernest comic strip about Fred Astaire: [...] "Sure <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>great,</b> but don't forget that Ginger Rogers did everything he did, backwards…and in high heels." [...] The attribution to Whittlesey traces to a speech she delivered to a large Teamsters Union meeting in 1984 where she was representing Reagan. Sometimes the quote is also attributed to Ann Richards, who later used the line in her 1988 Democratic National Convention speech, but Richards said she got the line from television journalist Linda Ellerbee who said she heard the line from a fellow passenger on an airplane. Both Hillary Clinton and President Barack Obama used the line in the 2016 campaign.|$|E
2500|$|Hughes {{was widely}} {{considered}} {{by those who}} knew him as a likeable and friendly person; a person who wanted to be liked. He said of himself when appointed captain of Australia, [...] "The one thing in my favour is that I will never change. I hope I will always be a likeable enough, easy-to-get-along-with type of person." [...] His biographer noted, [...] "riends, team-mates, coaches, teachers, officials, close observers. Almost all mentioned Kim's niceness. He addresses people by their first name. He loves being around and encouraging children. He likes being people's best friend." [...] As captain Hughes was popular and obliging with the press and the public. English journalist Frank Keating said [...] "Pulled this way and that by photographers, fringers, high commissioners, low commissioners, book commissioners, and hall-porter commissioners, [...] never stopped being softly obliging." [...] The journalist Adrian McGregor said of Hughes, [...] "He was almost too amenable, too nice a guy. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>great</b> with the media, would answer all sorts of questions, never told people to piss off. [...] It was almost like he didn't have the appropriate personality [...]" ...|$|E
2500|$|Taylor {{decided to}} try being a solo act with a change of scenery. In late 1967, funded by a small family inheritance, he moved to London, living in various areas: Notting Hill, Belgravia, and Chelsea. After {{recording}} some demos in Soho, his friend Kortchmar gave him his next big break. Kortchmar used his association with the King Bees (who once opened for Peter and Gordon), to connect Taylor to Peter Asher. Asher was A head for the Beatles' newly formed label Apple Records. Taylor gave a demo tape of songs, including [...] "Something In The Way She Moves," [...] to Asher, who then played the demo for Beatles Paul McCartney and George Harrison. McCartney remembers his first impression: [...] "I just heard his voice and his guitar and I thought <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>great</b> [...] and he came and played live, {{so it was just}} like, 'Wow, he's great.'" [...] Taylor became the first non-British act signed to Apple, and he credits Asher for [...] "opening the door" [...] to his singing career. Taylor said of Asher, who later became his manager, [...] "I knew from the first time that we met that he was the right person to steer my career.

2500|$|White Zombie {{announced}} in 1998 that the band had officially broken up, {{and it was}} confirmed that Rob had begun working on a solo debut album. Though acting as a solo artist, Zombie worked to find a band to record and tour with; Mike Riggs was selected to play guitar, Blasko played bass guitar, and John Tempesta played the drums. Tempesta {{had been a member of}} White Zombie, while Rob was introduced to Riggs through a mutual friend. On finding the guitar player, Zombie claimed [...] "Danny [...] was just like, ‘I know the perfect guy.’ He gave me Riggs’ phone number and I called him out of nowhere. I trusted Danny, so that was it. Riggs came out and <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>great.</b> We didn’t have a bass player yet. Riggs and I hung out and talked and I told him everything I wanted to do." [...] Work on the album began in August of 1997, prior to the announcement of White Zombie's separation. The album took an estimated ten months to complete. The majority of the album was recorded at The Chop Shop in Hollywood, California.

2500|$|Foley then {{engaged in}} a storyline rivalry with Ric Flair, {{inspired}} by real-life animosity between the two. In Have a Nice Day!, Foley wrote that Flair was [...] "every bit as bad on the booking side of things as <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>great</b> on the wrestling side of it." [...] In response, Flair wrote in his autobiography that Foley was [...] "a glorified stuntman" [...] {{and that he was}} able to climb the ladder in the WWF only because he was friends with the bookers. The two had a backstage confrontation at a Raw event in 2003, but Foley has said that they have largely reconciled. To spark the feud, Flair again called Foley a [...] "glorified stuntman" [...] and Foley called Flair a [...] "washed up piece of crap" [...] and challenged him to a match. The result was a Two-out-of-Three Falls match at Vengeance, where Flair beat Foley in two straight falls; with a rollup counter to the figure four in the first and by disqualification in the second after a trashcan shot. After the match, Flair was split wide open by Foley with a barbed-wire bat. The two then wrestled an [...] "I Quit" [...] match at SummerSlam, which Flair won when he forced Foley to quit by threatening Melina with a barbed-wire bat. On the edition of August 21 of Raw, Foley literally kissed Vince McMahon's buttocks as part of McMahon's [...] "Kiss My Ass Club" [...] gimmick after he threatened to fire Melina. Shortly thereafter, she betrayed Foley and announced that he was fired.|$|E
2500|$|Under Evans, Barnes {{and young}} players like Steve McManaman, Jamie Redknapp and Robbie Fowler (who {{had been given}} their debuts by either Dalglish or Souness) began playing attractive, attacking football, and were {{starting}} to look like title contenders again after several years of dominance in the title race by Manchester United as well as the likes of Leeds United, Blackburn Rovers and Newcastle United. They won the League Cup in 1995, began challenging for the FA Premier League title, and lost the 1996 FA Cup Final to Manchester United. Barnes had now been converted into a holding midfielder where he, Redknapp and McManaman would pass their way through teams and set up goals. He often captained the side in 1995–96 when regular captain Ian Rush lost his place to new signing Stan Collymore, and when Rush departed to Leeds United {{at the end of the}} season he became full-time captain. Barnes played a pivotal role in the midfield, and created the final goal after a dribble and passing movement for Stan Collymoore during Liverpool's 4–3 win at Anfield against Newcastle. A young Jamie Carragher was breaking through into the team towards the end of Barnes's career at Liverpool and said that despite Barnes supposedly being past his peak by then, in his 34th year, he was still the best player at the club. [...] "Technically, he’s the best player I've ever trained or played with, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>great</b> with both feet, they were both exactly the same. I'd say he's the best finisher I've ever played with (including Torres, Fowler, Owen). Barnes never used to blast his shots – they’d just get placed right in the corner. You speak with the players from those great Liverpool sides and ask them who the best player they played with was and they all say John Barnes".|$|E
