40|$|Time-resolved UV {{resonance}} Raman (UVRR) spectroscopic {{studies of}} WT and mutant myoglobin {{were performed to}} reveal the dynamics of protein motion after ligand dissociation. After dissociation of carbon monoxide (CO) from the heme, UVRR bands of Tyr showed a decrease in intensity with a time constant of 2 ps. The intensity decrease was followed by intensity recovery with a time constant of 8 ps. On the other hand, UVRR bands of Trp residues located in the A helix showed an intensity decrease that was completed within the <b>instrument</b> <b>response</b> <b>time.</b> The intensity decrease was followed by an intensity recovery with a time constant of ≈ 50 ps and lasted up to 1 ns. The time-resolved UVRR study of the myoglobin mutants demonstrated that the hydrophobicity of environments around Trp- 14 decreased, whereas that around Trp- 7 barely changed in the primary protein response. The present data indicate that displacement of the E helix toward the heme occurs within the <b>instrument</b> <b>response</b> <b>time</b> and that movement of the FG corner takes place with a time constant of 2 ps. The finding that the instantaneous motion of the E helix strongly suggests a mechanism in which protein structural changes are propagated from the heme to the A helix through the E helix motion...|$|E

As this UV-visible-NearIR spectrometer scanned over 10  s from 300 to 800  nm, observing a 160 [*]×[*] 9  km patch of the Venus nightside, the recorded light level saw several irregular jumps—seven such scans had these jumps. Interpreting {{this as a}} time series rather than a spectrum, there was a 70  s series of flashes, about two per second, each lasting about 250  ms, each of about 3 [*]×[*] 107  J of optical energy. Although claimed to be “similar to the duration of a flash on Earth,” these durations (much longer than the <b>instrument</b> <b>response</b> <b>time</b> of 5  ms) are puzzling. The observation was at 9 ° S around 7  pm local solar time; the “thunderstorm region” is described as being of 50, 000  km 2 area, presumably derived by mapping the instrument footprint migration during the 70  s.|$|E

Multiple studies have reported that the thione (2 TP) is converted into the thiol (2 -Mercaptopyridine, 2 MP) following photoexcitation. However, the timescale and photochemical pathway of this reaction remain uncertain. In this work, time-resolved XA spectroscopy at the S K-edge is used to monitor the formation and decay of two transient species following 400 [*]nm excitation of 2 TP dissolved in acetonitrile. The first transient species forms within the <b>instrument</b> <b>response</b> <b>time</b> (70 ps) and decays within 6 [*]ns.

40|$|Steady-state {{absorption}} and femtosecond time-resolved spectroscopic {{studies have}} been carried out on astaxanthin dissolved in CS 2, methanol, and acetonitrile, and in purified alpha-crustacyanin. The spectra of the S- 0 -> S- 2 and S- 1 -> S-n transitions were found to be similarly dependent on solvent environment. The dynamics of the excited-state decay processes were analyzed with both single wavelength and global fitting procedures. In solution, the S- 1 lifetime of astaxanthin was found to be similar to 5 ps and independent of solvent. In alpha-crustacyanin, the lifetime was noticeably shorter at similar to 1. 8 ps. Both fitting procedures led {{to the conclusion that the}} lifetime of the S- 2 state was either comparable to or shorter than the <b>instrument</b> <b>response</b> <b>time.</b> The data support the idea that dimerization of astaxanthin in alpha-crustacyanin is the primary molecular basis for the bathochromic shift of the S- 0 -> S- 2 and S- 1 - S-n transitions.

40|$|Aircraft and {{ground-based}} measurements {{made during}} the 1995 Australian OASIS field campaign are compared. The aircraft data were recorded during low-level flights at 6 m above ground level and grid flights at altitudes of between 15 and 65 m, all in unstable atmospheric conditions. The low-level flights revealed an inadequate temperature sensor <b>response</b> <b>time,</b> a correction for which was determined from subsequent work in a wind tunnel. Aircraft and ground-based measurements of mean wind speed, wind direction and air temperature agree to within 0. 2 m s- 1, 4 ° and 0. 9 °C respectively. Comparisons between aircraft and ground-based observations of the standard deviations of vertical velocity, horizontal wind speed, air temperature and specific humidity have slopes of 0. 96, 0. 97, 0. 92 and 0. 99 respectively but the observed scatter is roughly twice the random error expected due to the averaging length of the aircraft data and the averaging period of the ground-based data. For the low-level flights, the ground-based and aircraft measurements of sensible and latent heat flux show mean differences of 27 and - 25 W m- 2 respectively, which reduce to 11 and - 4 W m- 2 respectively when analysis of aircraft data is limited to areas immediately adjacent to the flux towers. For the flights at 15 to 65 m above ground level, the mean differences between the ground-based and aircraft measurements of sensible and latent heat flux are - 22 and - 1 W m- 2 respectively and these change to - 1 and - 7 W m- 2 respectively once the effect of surface heterogeneity is included. Aircraft and ground-based measurements of net radiation agree to within 6 % at one ground-based site but differ by 20 % at a second. Aircraft measurements of friction velocity at 6 m above the ground agree well with ground-based data, but those from flights between 15 and 65 m above ground level do not. This is because at these heights the aircraft measurements provide the local shear stress, not the surface shear stress. Overall, the level of agreement allows confidence in the aircraft data provided due care is taken of <b>instrument</b> <b>response</b> <b>times</b> and differences in the surfaces sampled by aircraft and ground-based systems. 29 page(s...|$|R

Isolated cortical collecting tubules (CCT) from rabbit kidney were perfused with physiological buffers containing the impermeant fluorophores fluorescein sulfonate (FS) and pyrenetetrasulfonic acid (PTSA). Tubules were subject to a 120 mOsm bath-to-lumen osmotic gradient in the presence and absence of 250 microU/ml vasopressin. The magnitude of transepithelial volume flow was determined from the self-quenching of FS, or from the ratio of PTSA/FS fluorescence, measured at 380 nm excitation and 420 +/- 10 nm (PTSA) and greater than 530 nm (FS) emission wavelengths. Pf was calculated from the magnitude of transepithelial volume flow, lumen and bath osmolarities, lumen perfusion rate, and tubule geometry. The <b>instrument</b> <b>response</b> <b>time</b> {{for a change in}} bath osmolality was less than 3 s. At 37 degrees C, CCT Pf was (in units of cm/s x 10 (4] 13 +/- 2 (mean +/- SE, 16 tubules) before, and 227 +/- 10 after addition of vasopressin to the bath. CCT Pf began to increase in 23 +/- 3 s after vasopressin addition and was half-maximal after 186 +/- 20 s. At 23 degrees C, Pf was 9 +/- 1 (seven tubules) before, and 189 +/- 12 after vasopressin addition. Pf began to increase in 40 +/- 4 s and was half-maximal after 195 +/- 35 s.

This system draws a sample of exhaust gas from the source, dilutes it with filtered air and quantifies total volatile organic compounds (VOCs), carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO 2), nitric oxide (NO), nitrogen dioxide (NO 2), sulfur dioxide (SO 2), oxygen (O 2), particle size distribution, particle number and mass concentrations, and black carbon (BC) concentration at 1 – 6 sec interval. Integrated samples by canisters and filter packs are acquired for laboratory analyses of VOC speciation, particle mass concentration, light absorption, elements, isotopes, ions, ammonia (NH 3), hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S), sulfur dioxide (SO 2), carbon, and organic compounds. Experiments were carried out to evaluate this system. The accuracy of key real-time instruments were found to deviate < ± 12 % from references.

40|$|A {{fluorescence}} method {{has been developed}} for accurate and instantaneous measurement of transepithelial diffusional water permeability (Pd) in perfused kidney tubules based on {{the sensitivity of the}} fluorophore aminonapthelane trisulfonic acid (ANTS) to solution H 2 O/D 2 O content. The fluorescence of ANTS was 3. 2 -fold lower in an H 2 O buffer than in a D 2 O buffer. The response of ANTS fluorescence to a change in solution H 2 O/D 2 O content occurred in less than 1 ms and was due to a collisional quenching mechanism. Isolated cortical (CCT) and outer medullary (OMCT) collecting tubules from rabbit were perfused with an isosmotic D 2 O buffer at specified lumen flow rates (2 – 100 nl/min); tubules were bathed in isosmotic H 2 O or D 2 O buffers in which vasopressin (VP) could be added rapidly. Lumen fluorescence was monitored by quantitative epifluorescence microscopy at 380 +/- 5 nm excitation and greater than 530 emission wavelengths. Pd was determined from tubule geometry, lumen flow, ANTS fluorescence, and ANTS fluorescence vs. H 2 O/D 2 O calibration relation.

40|$|Context: XMM-Newton was {{launched}} on 10 December 1999 {{and has been}} operational since early 2000. One of the instruments onboard XMM-Newton is the reflection grating spectrometer (RGS). Two identical RGS instruments are available, with each RGS combining a reflection grating assembly (RGA) and a camera with CCDs to record the spectra. Aims: We describe the calibration and in-orbit performance of the RGS instrument. By combining the preflight calibration with appropriate inflight calibration data including the changes in detector performance over time, we aim at profound knowledge about the accuracy in the calibration. This will be crucial for any correct scientific interpretation of spectral features {{for a wide variety}} of objects. Methods: Ground calibrations alone are not able to fully characterize the instrument. Dedicated inflight measurements and constant monitoring are essential for a full understanding of the instrument and the variations of the <b>instrument</b> <b>response</b> over <b>time.</b> Physical models of the instrument are tuned to agree with calibration measurements and are the basis from which the actual <b>instrument</b> <b>response</b> can be interpolated over the full parameter space.

The FMA uses off-axis integrated cavity output spectroscopy combined with a highly specific narrow band laser {{for the detection of}} CH 4 and strongly reflective mirrors to obtain a laser path length of 2 – 20 × 10 3 m. Statistical testing and a calibration experiment showed high precision (7. 8 × 10 − 3 ppb) and accuracy (< 0. 30 %) of the instrument, while no drift was observed. The <b>instrument</b> <b>response</b> <b>time</b> was determined to be 0. 10 s. In the field set-up, the FMA is attached to a scroll pump and combined with a 3 -axis ultrasonic anemometer and an open path infrared gas analyzer for measurements of carbon dioxide and water vapour. The power-spectra and co-spectra of the instruments were satisfactory for 10 Hz sampling rates. Due to erroneous measurements, spikes and periods of low turbulence the data series consisted for 26 % of gaps. Observed CH 4 fluxes consisted mainly of emission, showed a diurnal cycle, but were rather variable over. The average CH 4 emission was 29. 7 nmol m − 2 s − 1, while the typical maximum CH 4 emission was approximately 80. 0 nmol m − 2 s − 1 and the typical minimum flux was approximately 0. 0 nmol m − 2 s − 1. The correspondence of the measurements with flux chamber measurements in the footprint was good and the observed CH 4 emission rates were comparable with eddy covariance CH 4 measurements in other peat areas. Additionally, three measurement techniques with lower sampling frequencies were simulated, which might give the possibility to measure CH 4 fluxes without an external pump and save energy. Disjunct eddy covariance appeared to be the most reliable substitute for 10 Hz eddy covariance, while relaxed eddy accumulation gave reliable estimates of the fluxes over periods in the order of days or weeks...|$|E

The selenium and sulfur source mixture with different molar ratios in trioctylphosphine is prepared and injected into the hot precursor reaction medium of CdO in solution [14, 15].

Thermal conductivity instruments that are not coupled to gas chromatographs are useful for detecting hydrogen in binary gas mixtures, but suffer from significant cross-interference from other gas species that are separated when the detector is used with a gas chromatograph. This study reports a method for using a commercially-available thermal conductivity instrument to detect and quantify hydrogen in a diesel exhaust stream. The <b>instrument</b> <b>time</b> <b>response</b> of approximately 40 seconds is sufficient for steady-state applications. Cross-interference from relevant gas species are quantified and discussed. Measurement uncertainty associated with the corrections for the various species is estimated and practical implications {{for use of the}} instrument and method are discussed...|$|R

Large number of techniques {{have been developed to}} overcome to this problem but in phasor approach this is simply solved {{by the fact that the}} Fourier transformation of a convolution is the product of Fourier transforms. This allows to take into account the effect of <b>instrument</b> <b>response</b> by taking the Fourier transformation of <b>instrument</b> <b>response</b> function and dividing the total phasor to <b>instrument</b> <b>response</b> transformation.|$|R

30|$|This study {{thoroughly}} {{investigates the}} <b>instrument</b> <b>responses</b> of approximately 800 Hi-net sensors using a daily test coil signal {{over a period}} of 10  years that includes the 2011 Tohoku-Oki earthquake. Analyzing the test coil signal, we estimated the natural frequency and damping constant as the <b>instrument</b> <b>responses</b> for each sensor of Hi-net. Additionally, we examined how changes in the <b>instrument</b> <b>response</b> can affect the subsurface structure changes detected by PII for the 2011 Tohoku-Oki earthquake.|$|R
30|$|More than 10  years {{have passed}} since {{observations}} began to be recorded by Hi-net, a network of high-sensitivity seismometers located in Japan. Several large earthquakes, including the 2011 Tohoku-Oki earthquake, have been recorded by the network during this period. Age-related degradation and the strong ground motion of large earthquakes may change the <b>instrument</b> <b>response</b> of the high-sensitivity seismometers of Hi-net. Thus, we checked the natural frequency f and damping constant h for each Hi-net sensor and monitored the <b>instrument</b> <b>response</b> for 10  years from 2003 to 2013. Most of the sensors showed a stable <b>instrument</b> <b>response</b> over this period. More than 95  % of the sensors whose responses we could well estimate showed small fluctuations in their natural frequencies and damping constants of within 0.05  Hz and 0.05, respectively. We also found that many Hi-net sensors in northeastern Japan showed slight changes in the <b>instrument</b> <b>response</b> {{as a result of}} the 2011 Tohoku-Oki earthquake. Based on the assumption that the <b>instrument</b> <b>responses</b> remained unchanged, the fractional velocity reduction in the subsurface structure was reported by seismic interferometry analysis. To investigate how changes in the <b>instrument</b> <b>response</b> can cause errors in seismic interferometry analysis, we conducted a synthetic test. The results indicate that the <b>instrument</b> <b>response</b> did not result in systematic variation in the time delay observed in the interferometry analysis. This confirmed that the velocity decrease observed {{as a result of the}} 2011 Tohoku-Oki earthquake was not due to artificial instrument error.|$|R
30|$|Since {{the ground}} shaking {{caused by the}} 2011 Tohoku-Oki {{earthquake}} was too strong for a high-sensitivity seismograph, an <b>instrument</b> <b>response</b> change must be considered. After the earthquake, in fact, a very small change of the f and the h seems to occur at N.KMIH as shown in Fig.  8 c. We may have misidentified {{the change in the}} <b>instrument</b> <b>response</b> as corresponding to a change in the subsurface velocity structure resulting from the earthquake. Therefore, we investigate whether the change in the <b>instrument</b> <b>response</b> can misrepresent the subsurface velocity change.|$|R

Single- and parallel-tank models of <b>instrument</b> <b>response</b> are developed and critically examined. The progress made to date by investigators of nebuliser performance is briefly reviewed prior to developing a semi-empirical extended-tank model of <b>instrument</b> <b>response.</b> The capabilities of this model are explored by deriving a set of equations for <b>instrument</b> <b>response,</b> and comparing the predictions with experimental results. Agreement is generally good. Advantages of the modelling approach are discussed...|$|R

This yields a model described by the equation y = mx + y0, where y is the <b>instrument</b> <b>response,</b> m represents the sensitivity, and y0 is a constant that describes the background. The analyte concentration (x) of unknown samples may be calculated from this equation.|$|R
40|$|Decreasing {{trends of}} total ozone affect mainly solar {{ultraviolet}} (UV) levels {{at ground level}} with adverse effects on the biosphere. Highly accurate measurements of solar UV irradiance have become an important issue to assess UV trends. To detect these trends stations with well calibrated instruments, with long-term stability and Quality Assurance (QA) / Quality Control (QC) carefully followed procedures, are necessary. The Solar Radiometry Observatory of Rome, University "La Sapienza" (city centre) {{is one of the}} stations regularly measuring UV irradiance in Italy. Measurements of UV spectral (290 - 325 nm) irradiance started in 1992, using Brewer MKIV 067. Measurements of total irradiance contained in the 280 - 320 nm waveband begun in 2000 with the YES UVB- 1 broad-band radiometer. An investigation of the internal temperature dependence of the spectral responsivity {{to improve the quality of}} the Brewer UV data was carried out. The study was based on the analysis of responsivity files recorded during the years 2000 - 2002. Responsivities are provided by specific tests through a set of five 50 W quartz tungsten-halogen lamps, traceable to the standards of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The lamp tests allow to measure any changes in the <b>instrument</b> <b>response</b> over <b>time.</b> It was observed that a decrease in the instrument's responsivity resulted from an increase of the internal temperature. A methodology based on a family of responsivity files at different temperature intervals is proposed to allow correction of UV irradiances using the responsivity file at the corresponding temperatures. The mean percentage difference between temperature corrected and non-corrected Brewer data varies from 0. 8 % to 1. 5 % over an internal temperature of 8 degreesC - 42 degreesC. In addition the results of a field evaluation in Rome between Brewer 067 and two temperature stabilized instruments, a broad-band radiometer (YES UVB- 1) and a moderate bandwidth multichannel radiometer (Biospherical GUV- 511 C) were analysed using temperature corrected spectral measurements...|$|R

30|$|We {{monitored}} the <b>instrument</b> <b>responses</b> for Hi-net sensors for 10  years from 2003 to 2013 by estimating their natural frequencies f and damping constants h from the test signal. We {{found that the}} Hi-net sensors are well controlled with small instrument-to-instrument variation; more than 95  % of the sensors show natural frequencies {{in the range of}} f[*]=[*] 1.0 – 1.2  Hz and damping constants in the range of h[*]=[*] 0.6 – 0.8. Furthermore, each Hi-net sensor is very stable against the temporal change over a decade. Their standard deviations of the natural frequency and damping constant were within 0.05  Hz and 0.05, respectively. During the 2011 Tohoku-Oki earthquake, large seismic waves exceeding the dynamic range of the Hi-net sensor were observed at the stations near the earthquake focal area. Small changes in the <b>instrument</b> <b>response</b> were also recognized in the Hi-net sensors after the earthquake. Thus, we conducted a synthetic test to investigate how changes in the <b>instrument</b> <b>response</b> can cause errors in seismic interferometry analysis. The test indicated that the <b>instrument</b> <b>response</b> change did not result in systematic variation in the time delay obtained from the PII of the 2011 Tohoku-Oki earthquake. This supports the conclusion that the 0.5  % decrease in the velocity at the N.KMIH station after the 2011 Tohoku-Oki earthquake was not due to artificial error caused by the large ground shaking.|$|R
