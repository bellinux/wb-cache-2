2500|$|Noise is also {{generated}} by external sources, most importantly the natural thermal radiation {{of the background}} surrounding the target of interest. In modern radar systems, the <b>internal</b> <b>noise</b> is typically about equal to or lower than the external noise. An exception is if the radar is aimed upwards at clear sky, where the scene is so [...] "cold" [...] that it generates very little thermal noise. The thermal noise is given by kB T B, where T is temperature, B is bandwidth (post matched filter) and kB is Boltzmann's constant. There is an appealing intuitive interpretation of this relationship in a radar. Matched filtering allows the entire energy received from a target to be compressed into a single bin (be it a range, Doppler, elevation, or azimuth bin). On the surface {{it would appear that}} then within a fixed interval of time one could obtain perfect, error free, detection. To do this one simply compresses all energy into an infinitesimal time slice. What limits this approach in the real world is that, while time is arbitrarily divisible, current is not. The quantum of electrical energy is an electron, and so the best one can do is match filter all energy into a single electron. Since the electron is moving at a certain temperature (Plank spectrum) this noise source cannot be further eroded. We see then that radar, like all macro-scale entities, is profoundly impacted by quantum theory.|$|E

30|$|The {{formulator}} {{is often}} {{confronted with a}} myriad of interacting factors related to a gene’s expression mechanisms before settling on a strategy to assess their impact. A mathematical description of this complex process usually relies on a manageable number of system variables. This lumping procedure inevitably results in {{a high degree of}} freedom and fluctuations, or uncertainties, in the predictions of populations of discrete systems [9]. The behavior of an individual protein molecule in a discrete system with such a high degree of freedom is thus difficult to predict even when the system is monitored experimentally. The parameters in the equations, e.g., the transition intensity functions of the master equation algorithm adopted here, are presumed to depend only on the major variables of the system and to be independent of the variables of secondary importance. Neglecting these secondary variables is, in essence, the source of internal, or system, or minimal noises that should be appropriately analyzed stochastically. Thus, the <b>internal</b> <b>noises</b> caused by the discrete nature of a system are inherent in the system and they govern the minimum scattering expected of the random variable of interest. The experimentally observed scattering should always be larger than the predicted one induced by <b>internal</b> <b>noises</b> because of inevitable external noises attributable to experimental errors and imprecision of measuring devices. This implies that it is worth cautioning ourselves not to replicate the experiments excessively in an attempt to reduce the scattering far beyond what is predicted. It {{is interesting to note that}} fluctuations reported by Gardner et al. are significantly higher than what master equations will predict. The number of culture used in their fluorescence analysis was 40, 000, and the actual number of culture in the sample is much larger than this number. Therefore, the noise levels reported by Gardner et al. [3] certainly involve not internal, but also external noises. External noises are the fluctuations created in an otherwise deterministic system by the application of a random force, whose stochastic properties are supposed to be known [9].|$|R
