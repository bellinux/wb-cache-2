5|$|After leaving Columbia in September 1948, Monroe {{became the}} protégée of Johnny Hyde, {{who was the}} vice {{president}} of the William Morris Agency. Hyde represented her and their relationship soon became sexual, although she refused his proposals of marriage. To advance Monroe's career, he paid for a silicone prosthesis to be implanted in <b>her</b> <b>jaw</b> and possibly for a rhinoplasty, and arranged a bit part in the Marx Brothers film Love Happy (1950). Monroe also continued modeling, and in May 1949 she posed nude for photos taken by Tom Kelley. Although her role in Love Happy was very small, she was chosen to participate in the film's promotional tour in New York that year.|$|E

5|$|Booker T and Sharmell {{versus the}} team of Robert Roode and Payton Banks in a Six Sides of Steel Intergender Tag Team Cage match was another highly {{promoted}} match heading into the event. This encounter was announced on the March 20 episode of Impact! by Cornette. The feud regarding this encounter began at Final Resolution, where Roode accidentally punched Booker T's real-life wife Sharmell, fracturing <b>her</b> <b>jaw</b> in the storyline and leaving her sidelined indefinitely. Booker T and Roode then fought at Against All Odds to a double count-out. At TNA's Destination X PPV event on March 9, 2008, Roode and Booker T fought in a Stand By Your Man Strap match, which Roode won. After the bout, Sharmell returned from injury attacking Roode and his manager Banks with a leather strap.|$|E

5|$|When Stone lectured in {{the dress}} {{in the fall}} of 1851, hers was the first Bloomer most of her audiences had ever seen. But by then, the dress had become controversial. Although {{newspapers}} had initially praised the practicality of the new style, they soon turned to ridicule and condemnation, now viewing the trousers as a usurpation of the symbol of male authority. Many women retreated in the face of criticism, but Stone continued to wear the short dress exclusively for the next three years. She also wore her hair short, cut just below <b>her</b> <b>jaw</b> line. After Stone lectured in New York City in April, 1853, the report of her speeches in the Illustrated News was accompanied by this engraving of Stone in the Bloomer dress.|$|E
5|$|Robert Roode versus Booker T in a Stand By Your Man Strap {{match was}} another highly {{promoted}} match {{heading into the}} event. The feud regarding this contest began at Final Resolution, where Roode accidentally punched Booker T's wife Sharmell, fracturing <b>her</b> <b>jaw</b> in the storyline, after a Mixed Tag Team match pitting Roode and his then-manager Ms. Brooks against Booker T and Sharmell. Booker T and Roode then fought at Against All Odds to a double count-out. Cornette announced on the February 14 episode of Impact! that Booker T and Roode would face in another match at Destination X. On the February 28, 2008, episode of Impact!, Roode handcuffed Booker T to the ring ropes and beat him with a belt, until Roode's former manager Ms. Brooks, now Traci Brooks, came to Booker T's defense. However, Roode and his new manager Payton Banks ended up attacking both with belts. On the March 6 episode of Impact!, Cornette announced that Booker T and Roode would face in a Stand By Your Man Strap match, in which if Booker T won then Brooks {{would be allowed to}} beat Banks with a strap ten times and vice versa.|$|E

5000|$|Jepson {{was born}} with a {{development}} <b>jaw</b> deformity - <b>her</b> top <b>jaw</b> stuck out by eight millimetres and <b>her</b> lower <b>jaw</b> hung down into her neck.

She was forced to wait until her late teens before she could have reconstructive surgery, as it was necessary to wait until <b>her</b> facial and <b>jaw</b> bones had stopped growing.|$|R
25|$|The {{hospitality}} {{offered by}} the Morrells was such that most of their guests had no suspicion {{that they were in}} financial difficulties. Many of them assumed that Ottoline was a wealthy woman. This was far from being the case and during 1927, the Morrells were compelled to sell the manor house and its estate, and move to more modest quarters in Gower Street. In 1928 she was diagnosed with cancer, which resulted in a long hospitalization and the removal of her lower teeth and part of <b>her</b> <b>jaw.</b>|$|E
25|$|Pathologist Luca Lalli, from Perugia's {{forensic}} science institute, performed the autopsy on Kercher's body. Her injuries consisted of sixteen bruises and seven cuts. These included several bruises {{and a couple}} of insubstantial cuts on the palm of her hand. Bruises on her nose, nostrils, mouth, and underneath <b>her</b> <b>jaw</b> were compatible with a hand being clamped over her mouth and nose. Lalli's autopsy report was reviewed by three pathologists from Perugia's {{forensic science}} institute who interpreted the injuries, including some to the genital region, as indicating an attempt to immobilize Kercher during sexual violence.|$|E
25|$|On May 1, 1947, {{hundreds}} of mostly poor peasants gathered at Portella della Ginestra, three {{kilometers from the}} town of Piana degli Albanesi on the way to San Giuseppe Jato for the traditional international Labour Day parade. At 10:15, the Communist party secretary from Piana degli Albanesi began to address the crowd when gunfire broke out. It was later determined that machine guns had been fired from the surrounding hills, as well as by men on horseback. Eleven people were killed, including four children, Serafino Lascari (15), Giovanni Grifò (12), Giuseppe Di Maggio and Vincenzo La Fata, both seven years old. Thirty-three people were wounded, including a little girl who had <b>her</b> <b>jaw</b> shot off.|$|E

25|$|Digital reconstructions of Ida's teeth {{reveal that}} she has unerupted molars in <b>her</b> <b>jaw,</b> {{indicating}} by comparison with modern squirrel monkeys that she was 9–10 months old and would have reached adulthood at 36 months. The shape of Ida's teeth provides clues as to her diet; jagged molars would have allowed her to slice food, suggesting {{that she was a}} leaf and seed eater. This is confirmed by the remarkable preservation of her gut content. Furthermore, the lack of a baculum (penis bone) found in all lower primates means that the fossil was from a female. X-rays performed on Ida revealed that her right wrist was healing from a fracture which may have contributed to her death. The scientists speculate whether she was overcome by carbon dioxide fumes while drinking from the Messel lake. Hampered by her broken wrist, she slipped into unconsciousness, was washed into the lake and sank to the bottom, where unique fossilisation conditions preserved her for 47 million years.|$|E
25|$|Katie Starks {{was born}} September 25, 1909 in Redwater, Texas. Katie was 36 {{at the time}} of the attack. She was married to Virgil Starks and lived at their {{farmhouse}} of five years on 500 acres of farmland off Highway 67 East almost 10 miles northeast of Texarkana. Her sister, Mrs. Allen, lived directly across the street from her. She was the daughter of Jim Strickland. She and Virgil went to school together growing up because their parents lived on neighboring farms in Red Springs, Texas. A friend had stated that she and Virgil were two of the best people he had ever known. After discovering her husband dead, she ran to telephone police. She rung the phone twice when she was shot two times in the face. One bullet went through the right cheek beside the nose, emerging behind the left ear, and the other went in her lower jaw below the lip, breaking <b>her</b> <b>jaw</b> and splintering several teeth before lodging under her tongue. She ran to a neighbor's house who then took her to the hospital where she recovered.|$|E
25|$|Aggression among captive {{killer whales}} is common. In August 1989, a {{dominant}} female killer whale, Kandu V, attempted to rake a newcomer whale, Corky II, {{with her mouth}} during a live show, and smashed her head into a wall. Kandu V broke <b>her</b> <b>jaw,</b> which severed an artery, and then bled to death. In November 2006, a dominant female killer whale, Kasatka, repeatedly dragged experienced trainer Ken Peters {{to the bottom of}} the stadium pool during a show after hearing her calf crying for her in the back pools. In February 2010, an experienced female trainer at SeaWorld Orlando, Dawn Brancheau, was killed by killer whale Tilikum shortly after a show in Shamu Stadium. Tilikum had been associated with the deaths of two people previously. In May 2012, Occupational Safety and Health Administration administrative law judge Ken Welsch cited SeaWorld for two violations in the death of Dawn Brancheau and fined the company a total of US$12,000. Trainers were banned from making close contact with the killer whales. In April 2014, the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia denied an appeal by SeaWorld.|$|E

25|$|Three {{months after}} the Wests' assault trial, the couple {{committed}} their first known murder. The victim was a 19-year-old named Lynda Gough, with whom Fred and Rose became acquainted through a male lodger in early 1973. Gough regularly visited Cromwell Street, and {{is known to have}} engaged in affairs with two male lodgers. On 19 April, she moved into Cromwell Street, although on or about 20 April, other tenants were informed that she had been told to leave the household after she had hit one of their children. This story was repeated to the girl's mother when she contacted the Wests to enquire as to her daughter's whereabouts (although Rose had been wearing Lynda's clothing when she repeated this claim). When Lynda's dismembered body was found, <b>her</b> <b>jaw</b> was completely wrapped in both adhesive and surgical tape to silence her screams, and two small tubes had likely been inserted into her nasal cavities to facilitate breathing. Long sections of string and sections of knotted fabric were also discovered with her remains. Lynda had likely been suspended from holes carved into the wooden beams supporting the ceiling of the cellar Fred would later admit he had devised for the purpose of suspending his victims' bodies, and likely died of strangulation or suffocation. Her dismembered body, missing five cervical vertebrae bones in addition to her patellae and numerous phalange bones, was buried in an inspection pit beneath the garage.|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} hours of January 15, 1978—one week after his arrival in Tallahassee—Bundy entered FSU's Chi Omega {{sorority}} house through a rear door with a faulty locking mechanism. Beginning at about 2:45a.m. he bludgeoned Margaret Bowman, 21, with a piece of oak firewood as she slept, then garroted her with a nylon stocking. He then entered the bedroom of 20-year-old Lisa Levy and beat her unconscious, strangled her, tore one of her nipples, bit deeply into her left buttock, and sexually assaulted her with a hair mist bottle. In an adjoining bedroom he attacked Kathy Kleiner, breaking <b>her</b> <b>jaw</b> and deeply lacerating her shoulder; and Karen Chandler, who suffered a concussion, broken jaw, loss of teeth, and a crushed finger. Tallahassee detectives later determined that the four attacks took place in a total of less than 15 minutes, within earshot of more than 30 witnesses who heard nothing. After leaving the sorority house Bundy broke into a basement apartment eight blocks away and attacked FSU student Cheryl Thomas, dislocating her shoulder and fracturing <b>her</b> <b>jaw</b> and skull in five places. She was left with permanent deafness, and equilibrium damage that ended her dance career. On Thomas's bed police found a semen stain and a pantyhose [...] "mask" [...] containing two hairs [...] "similar to Bundy's in class and characteristic".|$|E

500|$|Although {{each of the}} film's key puppets {{required}} a small team of puppeteers to operate it, the most complex puppet of the production was Hoggle. Shari Weiser was inside the costume, while Hoggle's face was radio-controlled by Brian Henson and three other operators. Speaking in the Inside the Labyrinth documentary, Brian Henson explained that Weiser [...] "does all the body movement and her head is inside the head. However, the jaw is not connected to <b>her</b> <b>jaw.</b> Nothing that the face is doing has any connection with what she's doing with her face.
