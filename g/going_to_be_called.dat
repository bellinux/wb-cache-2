In April 2006, he made his NJPW debut against El Samurai, using the ring name Prince Devitt. Devitt later stated in an interview with PowerSlam Mag that New Japan renamed him Prince Devitt because nobody Japanese could pronounce his actual name. He was originally <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>called</b> King David, until people started questioning why the 24-year-old would be a king already. Eventually, Simon Inoki came up with the name Prince Devitt, which Devitt himself also preferred. In May 2006, New Japan started holding brandexclusive events, and Devitt was assigned to the Wrestle Land brand, debuting under a mask as the second Pegasus Kid, which led to comparisons between Devitt and the original Pegasus Kid, Chris Benoit.|$|E

But the chance {{discovery}} of a photograph of 13-year-old Collins playing drums in the Getty Images library caused a change in direction, resulting in the album being called Going Back. In an interview on Today in September 2010, Collins noted he actually {{had to pay for}} use of the picture of himself as the cover image. However, the 2016 reissue of the album will use an entirely new cover photograph featuring present-day Collins instead of recreating or reusing the original cover.|$|E
25|$|The former Stanley Technical High School (the {{legacy of}} local {{inventor}} and engineer William Stanley) {{has been replaced}} and turned into an academy {{as part of the}} Harris Federation. After deliberation with local residents, it was originally <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>called</b> Harris at Stanley, but the federation changed it to Harris Academy South Norwood which came with some controversy. Many local residents are upset that the name Stanley was removed from the school, as Stanley, who had the original school built in 1907, is a famous and well regarded figure in South Norwood. Harris City Academy Crystal Palace is a city academy in the north west of South Norwood, but to avoid confusion with the other school it uses the Crystal Palace name.|$|E

It is absence caused by students {{of their own}} free will, and usually does not refer to legitimate excused absences, such as ones related to medical conditions.

Temecula's reason for suspending operations was because no suitable rink was available for the club and was the reason the club moved to Phoenix, Arizona for the 1996 season. The team was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>called</b> the Phoenix Desert Rats, but the team reappeared in Palm Desert, California to become the Palm (Springs) Desert Rats, to replace the Roller hockey team the Palm Desert Silver-Cats who later relocated to Ontario, California, to represent the Riverside-San Bernardino area.

Michael Mann, {{who called the}} new title [...] "inferior", said that producer Dino De Laurentiis made the change after Michael Cimino's film Year of the Dragon, produced by De Laurentiis, bombed {{at the box office}} in 1985. William Petersen has commented that another reason for the change was to avoid any suggestion that it might be a karate movie. [...] "At the time, Bruce Lee was knocking out Dragon movies, and Dino, in his wisdom, decided people would think it was a kung-fu movie", he later recalled.

Waugh writes: [...] "Quite soon I am {{going to write a}} little book. It is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>called</b> The Temple at Thatch and will be all about magic and madness". This writing project may have been a reaction to Waugh's immediate circumstances; he was in the last weeks of his Oxford career, contemplating failure in his examinations and irritated by {{the fact that most of}} his contemporaries appeared to be on the verge of brilliant careers. On [...] 22 June 1924 he spent time working out the plot, a continuation of the supernatural theme explored in [...] "Unacademic Exercise".

Nevertheless, he refrained from giving him of giving him a complete name like Gaara Yuzawa. Another early name was a younger child named [...] "Kumomaru" [...] but was avoided by Kishimoto.

In Jon Savage's analysis, they [...] "needed a gimmick, some edge to get them attention. Here it was: 'Kinkiness'—something newsy, naughty but just on the borderline of acceptability. In adopting the 'Kinks' as their name at that time, they were participating in a time-honoured pop ritual—fame through outrage."

According to BJ Novak, the episode was originally <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>called</b> [...] "My Grilled Foot", but writer Mindy Kaling thought it was [...] "too weird for people to tune in and watch that". Novak has described [...] "The Injury" [...] as one of his favorite episodes, and said of it, [...] "I don't think any other TV show would have made an episode from that starting point, and yet {{it was one of the}} funniest and most relatable episodes as it went on that we've ever had." ...|$|E
500|$|Inspired by {{this early}} success, Kubrick {{quit his job}} at Look and visited {{professional}} filmmakers in New York City, asking many detailed questions about {{the technical aspects of}} film-making. He stated that he was given the confidence during this period to become a filmmaker {{because of the number of}} bad films he had seen, remarking, [...] "I don't know a goddamn thing about movies, but I know I can make a better film than that". He began making Flying Padre (1951), a film which documents Reverend Fred Stadtmueller, who travels some 4,000 miles to visit his 11 churches. The film was originally <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>called</b> [...] "Sky Pilot", a pun on the slang term for a priest. [...] During the course of the film, the priest performs a burial service, confronts a boy bullying a girl, and makes an emergency flight to aid a sick mother and baby into an ambulance. Several of the views from and of the plane in Flying Padre are later echoed in [...] (1968) with the footage of the spacecraft, and a series of close-ups on the faces of people attending the funeral were most likely inspired by Sergei Eisenstein's Battleship Potemkin (1925) and Ivan the Terrible (1944/1958).|$|E

His final game for the platform was Knights of the Crystallion (1990): Knights was the game I threw the most of my soul into, {{out of all the}} games I ever did.
