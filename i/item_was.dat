5|$|As {{each piece}} of {{wreckage}} was brought in, it was carefully cleaned with fresh water, sorted, and weighed. The <b>item</b> <b>was</b> then placed in a specific area of a hangar at CFB Shearwater, based on a grid system representing the various sections of the plane. All items not considered significant to the crash were stored with similar items in large boxes. When a box was full, it was weighed {{and moved to a}} custom-built temporary structure (J-Hangar) on a discontinued runway for long-term storage. If deemed significant to the investigation, the <b>item</b> <b>was</b> documented, photographed, and kept in the active examination hangar. Particular attention was paid to any item showing heat damage, burns, or other unusual marks.|$|E
5|$|Gagak <b>Item</b> <b>was</b> {{directed}} by brothers Joshua and Othniel Wong; filming {{the work in}} black-and-white, they also handled sound editing. It was produced by Tan Khoen Yauw of Tan's Film and starred Rd Mochtar, Roekiah, Eddy T. Effendi, and Kartolo. The Wongs and cast had first worked together on Albert Balink's 1937 blockbuster Terang Boelan (Full Moon), before joining Tan's Film in 1938 for the highly successful Fatima; Gagak <b>Item</b> <b>was</b> their second production with the company, which hoped to mirror Terang Boelan success. Through these prior films Mochtar and Roekiah had become an established screen couple.|$|E
5|$|Gagak <b>Item</b> <b>was</b> {{released}} in late 1939 and was screened in Batavia (now Jakarta), {{the capital of}} the Indies; Medan, North Sumatra; and Surabaya, eastern Java. Some screenings of the film, also advertised under the Dutch title De Zwarte Raaf, had Dutch-language subtitles. A novelisation of the film, published by the Yogyakarta-based Kolff-Buning, soon followed. Gagak <b>Item</b> <b>was</b> one of four domestic productions {{released in}} 1939; the film industry had undergone a significant downturn following the onset of the Great Depression, during which time cinemas mainly showed Hollywood productions, and had only begun recovering following the release of Terang Boelan.|$|E

5|$|Urbonas's concept drew media {{attention}} when shown {{as part of}} the HUMAN+ display at the Science Gallery in Dublin from April through June 2011. The display, designated as its 2011 'flagship exhibition' by the Science Gallery, aims to show the future of humans and technology.

5|$|Gagak <b>Item</b> <b>was</b> {{screened}} {{as late as}} January 1951. The film {{is likely}} lost. Movies in the Indies were recorded on highly flammable nitrate film, and after a fire destroyed much of Produksi Film Negara's warehouse in 1952, old films shot on nitrate were deliberately destroyed. The American visual anthropologist Karl G. Heider writes that all Indonesian films from before 1950 are lost. However, JB Kristanto's Katalog Film Indonesia (Indonesian Film Catalogue) records several as having survived at Sinematek Indonesia's archives, and film historian Misbach Yusa Biran writes that several Japanese propaganda films have survived at the Netherlands Government Information Service.|$|E
5|$|Series 4 {{began on}} 21 September 1996 with the {{introduction}} of new presenters Zoe Ball and Jamie Theakston and with them came an array of new features. One such <b>item</b> <b>was</b> called Cloud 9 which replaced the former Famous For Five Minutes. Sitting in a den surrounded by sparkles, pink feather boas and harps, 'Zoe would ring up an unsuspecting viewer who had been nominated by their friend or family and make their lifelong dream or ambition come true. The following week's Cloud 9 would then show how that person got on as the segment would be filmed in the week. Cloud 9 also used an edited version of Dreams (The Developed Arrested Mix) by Gabrielle as its theme tune.|$|E
50|$|Of {{the more}} than four {{thousand}} items collected, {{only about a third}} came from the professional literature, and the other two-thirds from non-academic sources. These <b>items</b> <b>were</b> classified, similar <b>items</b> <b>were</b> eliminated, and the remaining <b>items</b> <b>were</b> rewritten to be clear. The rewritten <b>items</b> <b>were</b> then classified into 33 subcategories, and the subcategories supplemented with newly generated items to give equal coverage.|$|R

5|$|Slow lorises are omnivores, eating insects, other arthropods, small {{birds and}} reptiles, eggs, fruits, gums, nectar and {{miscellaneous}} vegetation. A 1984 {{study of the}} Sunda slow loris indicated that its diet consists of 71% fruit and gums, and 29% insects and other animal prey. A more detailed study of another Sunda slow loris population in 2002 and 2003 showed different dietary proportions, consisting of 43.3% gum, 31.7% nectar, 22.5% fruit, and just 2.5% arthropods and other animal prey. The most common dietary <b>item</b> <b>was</b> nectar from flowers of the Bertram palm (Eugeissona tristis). The Sunda slow loris eats insects that other predators avoid due to their repugnant taste or smell.|$|E
5|$|Srigala Item (Indonesian for Black Wolf, also advertised {{with the}} Dutch title De Zwarte Wolf) is a 1941 film from the Dutch East Indies that was {{directed}} by Tan Tjoei Hock and produced by The Teng Chun for Action Film. Starring Hadidjah, Mohamad Mochtar, and Tan Tjeng Bok, the film's plot– inspired by Zorro– follows {{a young man who}} became a masked vigilante to take revenge against his conniving uncle. Srigala <b>Item</b> <b>was</b> a commercial success, which Misbach Yusa Biran credits to the plot's use for escapism. A copy of the black-and-white film, which featured kroncong music, is stored at Sinematek Indonesia.|$|E
5|$|Though the Pacific {{electric}} ray will feed at any hour, it responds to prey {{much more quickly}} at night than during the day. Most prey captures occur in darkness or turbid conditions, when its eyes are largely useless. Instead, it relies on electroreception via its ampullae of Lorenzini to locate food. Experiments in the field have shown that it will attack artificially generated electric fields and conductive metal electrodes. Mechanical sensory cues, detected via the lateral line, also play an important role: this species has been observed preferentially attacking faster-moving prey even if a closer food <b>item</b> <b>was</b> available.|$|E
50|$|Action <b>items</b> <b>are</b> usually {{documented}} in the meeting minutes and are recorded in the task list of the group.

40|$|Purpose Computer-adaptive tests (CATs) {{can measure}} {{precisely}} at individual level with few items selected from an item bank. Our {{aim was to}} select fatigue items to develop a CAT for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and include expert opinions that are important for content validity of measurement instruments. Methods <b>Items</b> <b>were</b> included from existing fatigue questionnaires and generated from interview material. In a Delphi procedure, rheumatologists, nurses, and patients evaluated the initial pool of 294 <b>items.</b> <b>Items</b> <b>were</b> selected for the CAT development if rated as adequate by at least 80 % of the participants (when 50 % or less agreed, they <b>were</b> excluded). Remaining <b>items</b> <b>were</b> adjusted based on participants’ comments and re-evaluated in the next round. The procedure stopped when all <b>items</b> <b>were</b> selected or rejected. Results A total of 10 rheumatologists, 20 nurses, and 15 rheumatoid arthritis patients participated. After the first round, 96 of 294 <b>items</b> <b>were</b> directly selected. Nine <b>items</b> <b>were</b> directly excluded, and remaining <b>items</b> <b>were</b> adjusted. In the second round, 124 <b>items</b> <b>were</b> presented for re-evaluation. Ultimately, 245 <b>items</b> <b>were</b> selected. Conclusion This study revealed a qualitatively evaluated <b>item</b> pool to <b>be</b> used for the item bank/CAT development. The Delphi procedure is a beneficial approach to select adequate items for measuring fatigue in R...|$|R
5|$|To {{promote the}} game, and also forming {{part of the}} collection, a mobile app titled Justice Monsters Five was developed. Based on an arcade-style mini-game from XV, it used {{gameplay}} similar to the Monster Strike series and incorporated classic Final Fantasy monsters. Justice Monsters Five was released on August 30 for mobile platforms, and eventually shut down on March 27, 2017, seven months after its initial release. A planned Windows 10 version was not released. A second promotional <b>item</b> <b>was</b> A King's Tale: Final Fantasy XV, released through GameStop and EB Games in North America as a free pre-order bonus. Playing as an arcade-style beat 'em up, A King's Tale relates King Regis' exploits thirty years before the game's events, told to the young Noctis by Regis as fairy tales. A King's Tale was later made available for free for PS4 and Xbox One on March 1, 2017. In addition, another mobile game titled King's Knight: Wrath of the Dark Dragon is releasing in 2017. It is a remake of the 1986 game, and will also be available in XV as a game Noctis and his friends play. Square Enix and Machine Zone collaborated on a massively multiplayer online role-playing game for mobile devices based {{on the content of}} XV, first released on June 28, 2017. Titled Final Fantasy XV: A New Empire and developed by Machine Zone's subsidiary Epic Action, the game involves players taking the role of characters from Final Fantasy XV and fighting other player armies in real-time battles for control of the Crystal.|$|E

'B' <b>items</b> <b>are</b> important, but of course less important than 'A' items and more important than 'C' items. Therefore, 'B' <b>items</b> <b>are</b> intergroup <b>items.</b> 'C' <b>items</b> <b>are</b> marginally important.|$|R
