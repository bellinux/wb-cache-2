50|$|Glucuronic acid, {{like its}} {{precursor}} glucose, can {{exist as a}} linear (carboxo-)aldohexose (<1%), or as a cyclic hemiacetal (furanose or pyranose). Aldohexoses such as D-glucose are capable of forming two furanose forms (α and β) and two pyranose forms (α and β). By the Fischer convention, glucuronic acid has two stereoisomers (enantiomers), D- and L-glucuronic acid, depending on its configuration at C-5. Most physiological sugars are of the D-configuration. Due to ring closure, cyclic sugars have another asymmetric carbon atom (C-1), resulting in two more stereoisomers, named anomers. Depending on the configuration at C-1, there are two anomers of glucuronic acid, α- and β-form. In β-D-glucuronic acid the C-1 hydroxy group is {{on the same side}} of the pyranose ring as the carboxyl group. In the <b>free</b> <b>sugar</b> acid, the β-form is prevalent (~64%), whereas in the organism, the α-form UDP-α-D-glucuronic acid (UDPGA) predominates.|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{present study}} aimed {{to conduct a}} {{preliminary}} investigation of the validity and reliability of a short dietary questionnaire designed to assess dietary intake of saturated fat and free sugars. Methods: Forty students at Macquarie University, aged 17 - 46 years, completed the Dietary Fat and <b>free</b> <b>Sugar</b> - Short Questionnaire (DFS), a full-length food frequency questionnaire (C-FFQ) and a 4 -day diet diary (DD). After a mean (SD) follow-up time of 158 (10) days, 29 participants completed a second administration of the DFS. Results: Correlation coefficients comparing DFS scores with the percentage energy from saturated fat and <b>free</b> <b>sugar</b> assessed by the C-FFQ and DD ranged from 0. 35 to 0. 71.

40|$|Canada thistle is {{a serious}} {{perennial}} weed found throughout the northern regions of the United States and Canada. The weevil, Ceutorhynchus litura (F.), was first released in Canada in 1965 as a potential biological control agent for Canada thistle; however, its impact as a control agent has been sporadic. The objective {{of this study was}} to characterize C. litura impacts on the carbohydrate profile in Canada thistle roots through the growing season and to evaluate the potential for this biological control agent in causing stress to Canada thistle. Field plots, infested with C. litura, were established and extensively sampled for C. litura infestations. By sampling C. litura—damaged and undamaged Canada thistle shoots—roots through the season, we were able to establish the profile of <b>free</b> <b>sugars</b> and fructans in the roots and compare these levels to the presence and extent of insect damage. Levels of all <b>free</b> <b>sugars</b> and fructans were consistently found to be depressed in roots from C. litura—dam-aged shoots early in the summer during and shortly after the larval feeding period. Ceutorhynchus litura feeding in Canada thistle shoots appears to disrupt the movement of photoassimilates from leaves to roots. Late-season levels of <b>free</b> <b>sugars</b> and fructans indicate that roots do recover from these depressed levels, and in several instances, significant overcompensation occurred in the dam-aged roots.

40|$|The {{automation}} of {{the process}} of extracting sugars in the 1900 ’s reduced cost and increased availability of sugars leading to a dramatic rise in consumption which reached a peak in the 1970 ’s. There are different definitions for sugars not naturally available in foods and <b>free</b> <b>sugars</b> is the term used by WHO. The epidemiological evidence of the associations between sugars and obesity and type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is fairly strong and consistent, particularly for sugar sweetened drinks (SSB) in adults. The Department of Health in the UK and many other countries have recently updated their recommendations for <b>free</b> <b>sugars</b> {{as a result of this}} scientific evidence. In the UK the recommended amount of <b>free</b> <b>sugars</b> is currently 5 % of energy (reduced from 10 %) which is difficult to meet and very different from current British dietary patterns. Reducing intakes of <b>free</b> <b>sugars</b> is a challenge and will necessitate a range of different actions and policies. Public Health England has put forward 8 suggestions but the four most likely to improve dietary behaviour based on available evidence are social marketing, reduction of marketing of high sugar foods and drinks to children, reformulation and reductions in portion size and a sugar excise tax. Any action taken needs to be evaluated to check inequalities are not widened. The new childhood obesity strategy has incorporated some but not all of these strategies and may not go far enough.

As price increased, participants were significantly less likely to select a sugary drink, and selected drinks with fewer calories and less <b>free</b> <b>sugar</b> (p < 0. 001 for all). The overall effect of labelling was not statistically significant, although there was a trend for the ‘high sugar’ label to reduce the likelihood of selecting a sugary drink (p = 0. 11) and encouraging participants to select drinks with less <b>free</b> <b>sugar</b> (p = 0. 11). Increasing price was associated with reduced sugary drink purchases. Enhanced FOP labelling results highlight the need for further research to investigate their potential impact. The study adds empirical support for taxation to reduce sugary drink consumption. his study was supported by a Chair in Applied Public Health funded by the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) in partnership with the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) ...|$|E
5000|$|In {{regard to}} {{contributions}} to tooth decay, {{the role of}} <b>free</b> <b>sugars</b> is also recommended to be below an absolute maximum of 10% of energy intake, {{with a minimum of}} zero. There is [...] "convincing evidence from human intervention studies, epidemiological studies, animal studies and experimental studies, for an association between the amount and frequency of <b>free</b> <b>sugars</b> intake and dental caries" [...] while other sugars (complex carbohydrate) consumption is normally associated with a lower rate of dental caries. Lower rates of tooth decay have been seen in individuals with hereditary fructose intolerance.

500|$|This {{found that}} [...] "SSBs (sugar-sweetened beverages) may {{increase}} the risk of metabolic syndrome and type2 diabetes not only through obesity but also by increasing dietary glycemic load, leading to insulin resistance, β-cell dysfunction, and inflammation". As an overview to consumption related to chronic disease and obesity, the World Health Organization's independent meta-studies specifically distinguish <b>free</b> <b>sugars</b> ("all monosaccharides and disaccharides added to foods by the manufacturer, cook or consumer, plus sugars naturally present in honey, syrups and fruit juices") from sugars occurring naturally in food. The reports prior to 2000 set the limits for <b>free</b> <b>sugars</b> at a maximum of 10% of carbohydrate intake, measured by energy, rather than mass, and since 2002 have aimed for a level across the entire population of less than 10%. The consultation committee recognized that this goal is [...] "controversial. However, the Consultation considered that the studies showing no effect of <b>free</b> <b>sugars</b> on excess weight have limitations". A 2015 New York Times report noted that [...] "a review of beverage studies, published in the journal PLOS Medicine, found that those funded by Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, the American Beverage Association and the sugar industry were five times more likely to find no link between sugary drinks and weight gain than studies whose authors reported no financial conflicts." ...|$|R
40|$|The {{potential}} impact on health of diets rich in <b>free</b> <b>sugars,</b> and particularly fructose, is of major concern. The {{focus of this}} review {{is the impact of}} these sugars on insulin resistance and obesity, and the associated risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Much of the concern is focussed on specific metabolic effects of fructose, which are argued to lead to increased fat deposition in the liver and skeletal muscle with subsequent insulin resistance and increased risk of diabetes. However, much of the evidence underpinning these arguments is based on animal studies involving very large intakes of the <b>free</b> <b>sugars.</b> Recent human studies, in the past 5 years, provide a rather different picture, with a clear dose response link between fructose intake and metabolic changes. In particular, the most marked effects are observed when a high sugars intake is accompanied by an excess energy intake. This does not mean that a high intake of <b>free</b> <b>sugars</b> does not have any detrimental impact on health, but rather that such an effect seems more likely to be a result of the high sugars intake increasing the chances of an excessive energy intake rather than it leading to a direct detrimental effect on metabolism...|$|R
