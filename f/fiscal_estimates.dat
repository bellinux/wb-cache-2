40|$|The Charter of Budget Honesty Act 1998 (the Charter) {{provides}} for the Secretary to the Treasury and the Secretary of the Department of Finance (the Secretaries) to release publicly a Pre‑election Economic and Fiscal Outlook report (PEFO) within 10 days {{of the issue of}} the writs for a general election. Such writs were issued on 16  May  2016. The purpose of the PEFO is to provide updated information on the economic and fiscal outlook. The information in the report takes into account, to the fullest extent possible, all Government decisions made before the issue of the writs for the election and all other circumstances that may have a material effect on the economic and fiscal outlook. The Charter provides that where there is information unchanged from that set out in full in an earlier budget report, the PEFO may summarise and state this information is unchanged rather than repeat it. As the writs for the 2016 election were issued shortly after the release of the 2016 - 17 Budget, this PEFO provides reference to information published in the 2016 - 17 Budget where it is unchanged, rather than repeat it in full.

40|$|Many {{public policy}} {{decisions}} require analytical and empirical knowledge concerning the size, growth, causes and consequences of the ‘underground economy”. This paper seeks to clarify the meaning of underground activity, updates various discrepancy and <b>fiscal</b> <b>estimates</b> of its size and growth, and examines the empirical implications of new evidence concerning the growing use of US currency (dollarization) throughout the world for indirect estimates of the underground economy in the U. S. The paper examines all indirect and direct methods of estimating the amount of US currency held abroad and concludes that between 40 % - 45 % of US currency is held abroad. This result stands {{in sharp contrast to}} the estimates presented by Porter and Judson (1996) who claim that as much as 55 % - 70 % of US currency is held abroad. The new estimates of overseas currency are used to derive a domestic currency series which is the appropriate variable for use in currency demand models that purport to provide estimates of the size of the underground economy.

40|$|The {{size and}} pattern of any public budget depend, among other factors, on the {{visibility}} of both the burdens and benefits of public revenue and expenditure. Furthermore, such visibility is a necessary- not a sufficient- condition for an efficient allocation of resources between {{the private and public}} sectors of an economy. Although the importance of this visibility has been well known by academicians and practitioners for a long time, attempts to quantify it by taking the internal structure of every type of revenue or expenditure and its relative financial weight in a fiscal system into consideration are recent. In the scientific speciality of Fiscal Federalism, the aim of this contribution is to present, by using multiplicative indicators, burden and benefit <b>fiscal</b> <b>estimates</b> of the central/federal government level in European OECD countries and U. S. A., from data and essential information provided by the International Monetary Fund. The concurrence of several factors (such as non-coerciveness, non-existence of specific requitals, lack of information on concepts and quantities, partial shifting of burden by tax-payers, intergovernmental grants, etc.) explain why burden visibility values are lower than 100. 00. Policy implications of these estimates seem straightforward for these countries: as both present revenue and benefit visibility are not near to 100. 00 in general, allocation improvements could be obtained by implementing changes and reforms to raise values in general and by approaching these two types of budget visibility to such an optimal value. 2 1...|$|E

Mental health issues that coincide with emerging diseases and epidemics are rarely examined and sometimes, even eschewed due to cultural considerations. Psychiatric manifestations of various infectious diseases, especially {{with a focus on}} Ebola Virus disease (EVD) and Zika Virus, are discussed in this commentary to illustrate the continued need of care after the resolution of the actual illness. Various infectious diseases have associations with mental illness, such as an increased risk of obsessive-compulsive disorders and Tourette syndrome in children with Group B streptococcal infection. Current EVD literature does not demonstrate a strong association of mental illness symptoms or diseases but there is a necessity of care that extends beyond the illness. Patients and their families experience depression, anxiety, trauma, suicidal ideation, panic and other manifestations. Zika virus has been associated neuronal injury, genetic alteration that affects fetal development and detrimental maternal mental health symptoms are being documented. While funding calls from the international community are present, there are no specific epidemiological data or <b>fiscal</b> <b>estimates</b> solely for mental health during or after infectious diseases epidemics or disasters that support health care providers and strengthen policies and procedures for responding to such situations.

40|$|Executive summaryThis paper {{describes}} the key procedural changes that were effected in the 43 rd Parliament following the 2010 federal election, {{which resulted in}} a hung parliament—the first hung parliament since the early 1940 s. The paper focuses on the work of the House of Representatives, where the reforms introduced during the hung parliament had the greatest impact. In order to secure a second term of Government after the 2010 election, Prime Minister Gillard entered into a series of agreements with three independent MPs and the Australian Greens. This resulted in a formalised Agreement for a better parliament (the Agreement) being adopted by the House of Representatives and implemented largely via amendments to standing orders in September and October 2010. The first item listed in the Agreement was the re-establishment of a Selection Committee, chaired by the Speaker, to facilitate and enhance private members’ engagement across all parliamentary business—including allowing for debate and votes on Private Members’ bills during Government Business time in the Main Committee (renamed the Federation Chamber). The scrutiny of bills by parliamentary committees became a major aspect of private members’ work. The role of the Speaker and the management of Question Time was an important element of the so-called ‘new paradigm’ of parliamentary conduct. The Speaker was required to take a firm line on the relevance of ministers’ answers to questions, and the use of argument in both questions and answers. The management of supplementary questions and points of order was also a key task for the Speaker. A provision was also introduced to allow for a vote to be repeated where a division had miscarried through misadventure. The House committee system was restructured, reducing to nine the number of general purpose standing committees and reducing the number of members on each committee. It was also agreed that the Chair of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Public Accounts and Audit would be a non-aligned member or drawn from a non-Government party. In September 2010, a six-month timeframe for government responses to committee reports was adopted, and the first Notice Paper of each sitting fortnight contained a list of those reports awaiting a response. In December 2011, the Parliamentary Budget Office (PBO) was established under the Parliamentary Service Amendment (Parliamentary Budget Officer) Act 2011 and the Parliamentary Budget Officer was appointed in May 2012. The PBO’s task was to provide independent policy costings, fiscal analysis and research to parties and MPs. In 2013, an amending Act—the Parliamentary Service Amendment (Parliamentary Budget Officer) Act 2013 —provided, among other things, for a post-election report to be prepared that set out, for each political party, costings of all its election commitments and their combined impact on the Commonwealth Budget and general government sector <b>fiscal</b> <b>estimates.</b> The Agreement had also sought to establish a National Integrity Commissioner—and a bill to that effect had first been introduced in the Senate by the Australian Greens in June 2010 but it lapsed {{at the end of the}} 42 nd Parliament. In May 2012 a near-identical bill was introduced into the House by Adam Bandt. The bill lapsed when the 43 rd House of Representatives was dissolved on 5 August 2013. As the 43 rd Parliament drew to a close there was some commentary from both journalists and MPs assessing its legacy. The general observation was made by one writer that ‘Australians are unused to minority governments. They are uncomfortable with the obvious cattle-trading axiomatic in making minority governments work’. Notwithstanding a popular sense that the hung parliament had been problematic, there remained those who considered that such a view ignored the evidence of its effectiveness. While critical of some actions of the Gillard Government, the independent MPs who supported Gillard generally regarded the Parliament as a success, seeing it as ‘more triumph than tragedy’. They agreed that one of the Prime Minister 2 ̆ 7 s main achievements was her management of a parliament that, they said, had ‘delivered’...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{presents}} a <b>fiscal</b> <b>estimate</b> of Bulgaria’s perspective European Union (EU) membership. The projected EU funds have two distinct effects: first, {{there is the}} overall effect on the balance of payments of the country; and second, there is the pure effect on the national budget. The paper concludes {{that the country is}} likely to benefit from large net inflows of resources of an average of 3. 7 % of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2007 - 2009. In contrast, Bulgaria’s fiscal position is expected to deteriorate by 1. 6 % of GDP on average in 2007 - 2009, if no expenditure restructuring of the fiscal framework is carried out. The expected deterioration of the public finances related to EU accession would be due to co-financing requirements, national contributions to the EU budget, and possible full pre-financing of the EU direct payments to Bulgarian farmers {{in the first year of}} accession. However, the above expenditures will be partly offset by the budgetary compensation allocated out of the EU budget, savings from agricultural subsidies and shifting of certain public expenditures to Cohesion Fund-supported projects...|$|R
