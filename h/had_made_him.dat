5|$|Rajneesh (Osho) {{says that}} Aurobindo {{was a great}} scholar but was never realised; that his {{personal}} ego <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> indirectly claim that he went beyond Buddha; {{and that he is}} said to have believed himself to be enlightened due to increasing number of followers.|$|E

5|$|Bruce's {{earnings}} from his offices <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> a wealthy man, {{even by the}} standards of his patrons. This wealth allowed him to purchase the Balcaskie estate in 1665, and to extend the house and gardens. In 1675 he purchased the larger estate of Loch Leven, Kinross, from the Earl of Morton, which brought him the hereditary sheriffdom of Kinross-shire. In the late 1670s Bruce took on his first architectural projects for entirely new houses.|$|E
5|$|Germanicus' {{successes in}} Germany <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> {{popular with the}} soldiers. He had dealt a {{significant}} blow to Rome's enemies, quelled an uprising of troops, and returned lost standards to Rome. His actions had increased his fame, and he had become very popular with the Roman people. Tiberius took notice, and had Germanicus recalled to Rome and informed {{him that he would}} be given a triumph and reassigned to a different command.|$|E

5|$|In 1988, Ryan White spoke {{before the}} President's Commission on the AIDS Epidemic. Ryan White told the {{commission}} of the discrimination he had faced when he first tried to return to school, but how education about the disease <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> welcome {{in the town of}} Cicero. Ryan White emphasized his differing experiences in Kokomo and Cicero {{as an example of the}} power and importance of AIDS education.|$|E
5|$|Born in 1874 in Fujian, China, Tan came to Singapore {{at the age}} of 16 to {{join his}} father's business. In 1904, Tan struck out on his own, selling pineapples and rice and {{manufacturing}} rubber tyres and shoes. Tan's rubber business flourished and, with growing wealth, he altruistically donated money to many schools and established Amoy University (now Xiamen University). However, Tan's loyalty still lay with his motherland and he ardently supported opponents of the Qing rulers during the Xinhai Revolution. By this time, Tan's philanthropic work and political inclinations <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> a popular figure amongst the Chinese in Singapore and China.|$|E
5|$|Invites to Golden League meets never materialised, but he {{continued}} to run at smaller events. He ran a European leading time of 10.06seconds at Papaflessia in Greece, and won the 100m and 200m races at the 2009 European Team Championships. He was the fastest entrant at the national championships but 2008 runner-up Simeon Williamson won the final by some distance. The result took Chambers by surprise {{and he said that}} limited opportunities to race <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> complacent. He later withdrew from the 200m race citing exhaustion.|$|E

5|$|Late in 1315 or in 1316, Harclay {{was taken}} captive by the Scots, who demanded 2000 marks in ransom. His {{meteoric}} rise {{over the previous}} years <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> some enemies in local society, who now {{took the opportunity to}} spread slanderous rumours about him at court. The king nevertheless helped raise the necessary money to secure Harclay's freedom, but {{for the next few years}} he seems to have been out of royal favour. It was not until 1319 that he once more was appointed sheriff, and at the same time made keeper of Carlisle and Cockermouth castles, and Warden of the West Marches. In 1321 he also received a personal summons to parliament.|$|E
5|$|Later in 1951 Donen made Love Is Better Than Ever. The film stars Larry Parks, whose Oscar–nominated {{performance}} in The Jolson Story <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> a star five years earlier. Parks plays a streetwise show business agent who finds himself compelled to marry an innocent young dance teacher played by Elizabeth Taylor. Donen and Kelly appear in cameo roles. The film remained unreleased {{for over a}} year after Parks admitted to the House Un-American Activities Committee that he {{had been a member of}} the Communist Party and named other members. The film was unsuccessful at the box office.|$|E
5|$|Maintaining {{the same}} {{interval}} {{of three years}} between Germanicus' and Drusus' first and second term as consul, Drusus was given the consulship again in AD 21, which he held with his father. The hardship {{of the last two}} years on his father <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> reclusive. For Tiberius, Drusus holding the consulship was a welcome sight, and with the state of his health, he retreated to Campania, leaving Drusus alone in carrying out the obligations of the consulship. Tiberius' retreat lasted about twenty months.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Rekha {{escapes from}} the garage and enters the room where Chandru earlier claimed his mother stays. However, she finds only a {{skeleton}} and is cornered by Chandru, who tries to assault her. Ravi and Raghunath hear Rekha screaming and rush to the room. Raghunath subdues Chandru, who collapses and reveals that the skeleton is his mother's. Raghunath understands Chandru's love for {{his mother and his}} traumatic childhood, which <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> develop a hatred for women with loose morals. Chandru is arrested, while Rekha and Ravi unite.|$|E
5|$|Media {{attention}} was also {{directed at the}} teams' offensive capabilities. Boston College quarterback Matt Ryan was named the Atlantic Coast Conference Player of the Year in the week {{leading up to the}} game. In {{the first half of the}} 2007 season, Ryan had been prominently mentioned in candidate lists for the Heisman Trophy, college football's highest individual award. Although Ryan's late-game comeback in their previous game against Virginia Tech <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> a front-runner, the team's two subsequent losses to unranked teams dropped him from contention for the Heisman. Excellent performances in a division-clinching win at Clemson and against Miami seemed to return Ryan to Heisman-candidate form, however, and heading into the ACC Championship Game, Ryan appeared to be the biggest offensive threat for Boston College.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the course}} of the tour with Dashboard Confessional, {{relationships}} between the band members continued to decline. The band's live shows had deteriorated, and Rob and Suptic had both threatened to quit multiple times. Matt Pryor's wife had recently given birth to their first child, and being away from his family <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> irritable and standoffish. After the Honda Civic tour ended, the band embarked on their world tour, including stops throughout Europe, Japan and Australia. However, their live performance hit an all-time low, with Pryor at times refusing to even sing large portions of songs.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the summer}} of 1936, the Canadiens re-hired Cecil Hart to be {{the coach of the}} team. Hart agreed to the job on one condition: that the Canadiens bring Morenz back to the team. On September 1, 1936, Morenz once again joined the Canadiens, his {{contract}} being purchased by the team from the Rangers. The Canadiens spent most of the 1936–37 season {{as one of the best}} teams in the NHL; Morenz contributed regularly, occasionally showing the speed that <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> notable at the start of his career. By mid-January, he had 4 goals and 20 points, far better totals than previous years.|$|E
5|$|Persistently {{hampered}} by ankle and back injuries, Meckiff aggregated only 19 first-class wickets at 40 for the summer. His best innings performance was 4/39 against Queensland {{and he was}} unable to claim more than five wickets in any single match. In one match against arch-rivals New South Wales, the Victorian took a total of 5/155, all of his wickets being Test batsmen. Meckiff was not selected for the Ashes tour. His lack of form saved the Australian selectors the difficult choice of whether to omit him because of his action and avoid a potential run-in with umpires in England. Critics claimed that his new bowling action adopted in 1959–60 <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> legitimate but reduced his pace and effectiveness.|$|E
5|$|The 1881 {{world tour}} of King Kalākaua of the Kingdom of Hawaii was {{his attempt to}} save the Hawaiian culture and {{population}} from extinction through the importation of a labor force from Asia-Pacific nations. His efforts brought the small island nation {{to the attention of}} world leaders, but sparked rumors that the kingdom was for sale. In Hawaii there were critics who believed the labor negotiations were just his excuse to see the world. The 281-day trip gave him the distinction of being the first monarch to circumnavigate the globe, just as his 1874 travels <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> the first reigning monarch to visit America and the first honoree of a state dinner at the White House.|$|E
