5|$|Uniparental {{inheritance}} {{leads to}} little opportunity for genetic recombination between different lineages of mitochondria, although a single mitochondrion can contain 2–10 copies of its DNA. For this reason, mitochondrial DNA is usually thought to reproduce by binary fission. What recombination <b>does</b> <b>take</b> place maintains genetic integrity rather than maintaining diversity. However, there are studies showing evidence of recombination in mitochondrial DNA. It {{is clear that}} the enzymes necessary for recombination are present in mammalian cells. Further, evidence suggests that animal mitochondria can undergo recombination. The data are a bit more controversial in humans, although indirect evidence of recombination exists. If recombination does not occur, the whole mitochondrial DNA sequence represents a single haplotype, which makes it useful for studying the evolutionary history of populations.|$|E
5|$|To {{experience}} {{firsthand the}} processes mod-makers {{would have to}} go through with the new engine, Valve ported Half-Life (dubbed Half-Life: Source) and Counter-Strike to their new Source engine. Half-Life: Source is a straight port, lacking any new content or the Blue Shift High Definition pack. However, it <b>does</b> <b>take</b> advantage of vertex and pixel shaders for more realistic water effects, as well as Half-Life 2's realistic physics engine. They also added several other features from Half-Life 2, including improved dynamic lightmaps, vertex maps, ragdolls, and a shadowmap system with cleaner, higher resolution, specular texture and normal maps, as well as utilization of the render-to-texture soft shadows found in Half-Life 2s Source engine, along with 3D skybox replacements in place of the old 16-bit color prerendered bitmap skies. The Half-Life port possesses many of the Source engine's graphical strengths as well as control weaknesses that have been noted in the Source engine. Later updates added a field of view options, support for OS X and Linux, an optional high-definition texture pack, among other improvements. Half-Life: Source is available with special editions of Half-Life 2, or separately on Steam.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} three rounds, the wheel {{contains}} a Wild Card and a Gift Tag, while two ½ Car tags are present in rounds two and three only (except on episodes with two-player teams). The Wild Card {{may be used to}} call an additional consonant after any turn (for the amount that the contestant has just spun) or taken to the bonus round to call an extra consonant there. The Gift Tag offers either a $1,000 credit toward purchases from, or $1,000 in cash courtesy of, the sponsoring company, and the ½ Car tags award a car if the contestant wins the round(s) in which he or she claims both. Unlike the other tags, the ½ Car tags are replaced in subsequent rounds unless the car is won. A special wedge in the first two rounds awards a prize which is described by the announcer if won. All of the tags and the prize wedge are located over the $500 wedges, so calling a letter that appears in the puzzle when landed upon awards both the tag/wedge and $500 per every occurrence of that letter in the puzzle. The first three rounds also contain a special wedge which, if won and taken to the bonus round, offers an opportunity to play that round for $1,000,000. A contestant must solve the puzzle in order to keep any cash, prizes, or extras accumulated during that round except for the Wild Card, which is kept until the contestant either loses it to Bankrupt or uses it. Bankrupt does not affect score from previous rounds, but it <b>does</b> <b>take</b> away the Wild Card, individual ½ Car tags, and/or million dollar wedge if any was claimed in a previous round. Contestants who solve a round for less than $1,000 in cash and prizes ($2,000 on weeks with two-contestant teams) have their scores increased to that amount.|$|E

25|$|Storing {{bulbs and}} root crops: pour {{vermiculite}} around bulbs placed in container. If clumps are dug, allow to dry {{for a few}} hours in the sun and then place in cartons or bushel baskets and cover with vermiculite. The absorptive power of vermiculite acts as a regulator that prevents mildew and moisture fluctuation during the storage period. It will not absorb moisture from the inside of stored tubers, but it <b>does</b> <b>take</b> up free water from the outside, preventing storage rot.|$|E
25|$|Another {{main reason}} for the {{difference}} in pace is that in baseball the ball reaches the batter on the full, whereas in cricket the ball is usually bounced off the pitch before reaching the batsman- which <b>does</b> <b>take</b> pace off the ball, especially on drier dustier pitches. A delivery in cricket that reaches the batsman without bouncing, known as a full toss, is legal {{so long as it}} is below waist high. However, this is usually considered a poor delivery as it is often quite easy to score runs from.|$|E

25|$|It {{is often}} {{recommended}} to age ripened pu'er to air out the unpleasant musty flavors and odors formed due to maocha fermentation.

Others note that their experience has taught them that ripened pu'er indeed <b>does</b> <b>take</b> on nuances through aging, and point to side-by-side taste comparisons of ripened pu'er of different ages. Aging the tea increases its value, but may be unprofitable.|$|E

25|$|The rate of {{patination}} conversion {{is dependent}} upon copper’s exposure to moisture, salt, and acidity from acid-forming pollutants. In marine climates, the entire patination process can take seven to nine years. In industrial environments, patina formation reaches its final stage in about fifteen to twenty-five years. In clean rural atmospheres with low concentrations of airborne sulfur dioxide, the final stage may take ten to thirty years to develop. In arid environments, a patina may not form at all if the moisture is insufficient. Where patination <b>does</b> <b>take</b> place in arid environments, it may mature to an ebony or nut brown. In all environments except the coastal areas, patination takes longer for vertical surfaces due to more rapid water runoff.|$|E
25|$|Irradiation {{has been}} {{approved}} by many countries, for example in the US the FDA has approved food irradiation for over 50 years. However, {{in the past decade}} the major growth area is for fruits and vegetables that are irradiated {{to prevent the spread of}} pests. In the early 2000s in the US, irradiated meat was common at some grocery stores, but because of lack of consumer demand it is no longer common. Because consumer demand for irradiated food is low, reducing the spoilage between manufacture and consumer purchase and reducing the risk of food borne illness is currently not sufficient incentive for most manufactures to supplement their process with irradiation. Nevertheless, food irradiation <b>does</b> <b>take</b> place commercially and volumes are in general increasing at a slow rate, even in the European Union where all member countries allow the irradiation of dried herbs spices and vegetable seasonings but only a few allow other foods to be sold as irradiated.|$|E

25|$|Cricket {{was once}} the most popular sport in Canada until the early 20th Century before it was {{overtaken}} by hockey. Cricket was so popular it was declared the national sport by Sir John A. Macdonald, the first Prime Minister of Canada. Cricket, today, is a popular minority sport in Canada, although it is growing. Cricket is the fastest growing sport in Canada. Canada has well over 40,000 cricketers across the nation. While Canada is not sanctioned to play Test matches, the team <b>does</b> <b>take</b> part in One Day International (ODI) matches and also in first-class games (in the ICC Intercontinental Cup) against other non-Test-playing opposition, with the rivalry against the United States being as strong in cricket {{as it is in}} other team sports. The match between these two nations is in fact the oldest international fixture in cricket, having first been played in 1844. This international fixture even outdates the Olympics by over 50 years. There are a few grounds in Canada that are sanctioned by the ICC to host official ODI's. The most famous Canadian cricketer is John Davison, who was born in Canada but raised in Australia and participated in the Cricket World Cup in 2003, 2007 and 2011. At the 2003 World Cup, Davison hit the fastest century in tournament history against the West Indies in what was ultimately a losing cause. In that World Cup he also smashed a half century at a strike rate of almost 200 against New Zealand. One year later, in the ICC Intercontinental Cup against the USA, he proved {{the difference between the two}} sides taking 17 wickets for 137 runs as well as scoring 84 runs of his own. In the 2007 Cricket World Cup in the West Indies, John Davison scored the second-fastest half-century against New Zealand. Canada has participated in the 1979, 2003 and 2007 Cricket World Cups. Canada has traditionally had a strong Women's team. Also The Canadian Under 19 team have competed in the Under 19 World Cup on two occasions. In 2002, they were eliminated in the first round, meaning they competed in the plate competition, in which they did not win a game. They repeated this performance in the 2004 competition.|$|E
500|$|Some reviewers {{commented that}} Stephenson seems to carry his {{understanding}} of the period a little too far at times, delving into too much detail. Nick Hasted of The Independent wrote that this research made [...] "descriptions of Restoration London feel leaden, and intellectual discourses between Newton and his contemporaries textbook-dry." [...] Despite the thorough examination of the period, however, Stephenson <b>does</b> <b>take</b> liberty in depicting the Enlightenment. Both main and secondary fictional characters become prominent members of society who advise the most important figures of the period and affect everything from politics to economics and science. For example, he repopulates the real Cabal Ministry with fictional characters.|$|E
