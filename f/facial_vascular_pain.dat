40|$|Background and Aims: With {{the recent}} {{development}} of capecitabine and oxaliplatin (XELOX) therapy, implantation of a Central Venous (CV) port can be now avoided. However, <b>vascular</b> <b>pain</b> occasionally requires switching of the drip infusion route. Some investigators reported that addition of steroids to oxaliplatin drip infusion {{is useful in}} controlling <b>vascular</b> <b>pain.</b> However, the pharmacological use of steroids can make oxaliplatin unstable due to the elevation of pH; further, the effectiveness of steroid in this therapy is unknown. This study was undertaken {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of dexamethasone (DEX) for controlling <b>vascular</b> <b>pain</b> caused by the administration of oxaliplatin via the peripheral vein. Study design: Retrospective study. Place and duration of the Study: Department of Gastroenterological Surgery, Fukuoka University Faculty of Medicine, between April 2010 and November 2011. Methodology: The study included 69 patients who received XELOX + bevacizumab therapy for advanced or recurrent colorectal cancer. In all the patients, oxaliplatin (130 mg/m 2) was administered in combination with DEX (6. 6 mg) via the peripheral vein. Results: <b>Vascular</b> <b>pain</b> developed in 47 patients (68. 1 %), but it was transient. No patients required CV port implantation. Grade 3 or higher hemotoxicity was noted in 14. 5 % of the patients, and grade 3 or higher nonhematological toxicity was noted in 20. 3 % of the patients. The response rate was 59. 4 %. One patient experienced hypersensitivity reactions to oxaliplatin. Conclusions: The recorded response rate combined with the use of DEX suggests that DEX probably does not exert adverse effects on the therapy, ie, it does not affect the stability of oxaliplatin by elevating the pH. DEX may be useful not only for controlling <b>vascular</b> <b>pain</b> caused by the administration of oxaliplatin via the peripheral vein but also for controlling oxaliplatin-induced hypersensitivity reactions...|$|R

40|$|AbstractPurposeTo {{demonstrate}} {{the value of}} 3 D CT angiography (CTA) {{in the evaluation of}} <b>facial</b> <b>vascular</b> lesions regarding diagnosis, characterization and full extensions compared to conventional 2 D CTA. Patients and methodsThis prospective study included 16 patients with <b>facial</b> <b>vascular</b> lesions with ages that range from 1 to 45 years and mean age of 23 years, patients performed CT angiography (2 D and 3 D) utilizing the coronal and sagittal MPR and VR techniques. Lesions were evaluated by both 2 D and 3 D sequences regarding characterization and complete extension including intracranial extension. Our results were correlated with maxillofacial and plastic surgery results. ResultsAmong the 16 patients, 7 had hemangiomas, 5 had AVMs and 4 had AVFs. In hemangiomas, 2 D successfully evaluated (regarding diagnosis, characterization and full extensions) 5 patients (71. 5 %) and 2 patients were in doubt regarding diagnosis, while 3 D CTA successfully evaluated all the patients (100 %). In AVMs, 2 D CTA successfully evaluated 4 patients (80 %), one patient was in doubt regarding intracranial extension, while 3 D CTA successfully evaluated all the patients (100 %). In AVFs, 2 D and 3 D CTA successfully evaluated all the patients (100 %). For all cases, diagnostic accuracy of 2 D CTA was 81. 3 %, while diagnostic accuracy of 3 D CTA was 100 %. ConclusionCTA offered noninvasive excellent angiographic imaging modality of the <b>facial</b> <b>vascular</b> lesions. The 3 D CTA in particular (with high spatial and temporal resolution) provided distinct features that enabled excellent lesion detection, characterization, visualization of feeding arteries and draining veins and complete extensions. The 3 D CTA allowed accurate differentiation of hemangiomas from AVMs that is sometimes difficult using clinical examination and 2 D CTA.

In this study, we evaluated and compared {{the use of}} propofol-lidocaine admixture vs propofol-lidocaine combined with ephedrine, on <b>vascular</b> <b>pain</b> and hemodynamic changes associated propofol. Methods: This double-blinded, prospective, randomised study was performed on 100 patients with ASA I-II who {{were divided into two}} group. The first received admixture consisting of 20 mg of lidocaine and propofol 1 % 20 ml (Group L), and the other received admixture consisting of 20 mcg ephedrine, 20 mg lidocaine and propofol 1 % 20 ml (Group LE). Baseline and after induction heart rate, mean arterial pressure and rate pressure product (RPP) were recorded per minute. <b>Vascular</b> <b>pain</b> were evaluated with verbal rating scale. Results: Data of 40 patients in group L and 39 patients in Group LE were evaluated in the study. The incidence of pain in group L was 90 %, it was 38. 4 % for Group LE. Mild pain was observed significantly more in Group L when compared to Group LE (p< 0. 05). Average blood pressure and RPP immediately after induction and 1 min after intubation were significantly higher in group LE compared to group L (p< 0. 05).

40|$|Abstract. The <b>facial</b> <b>vascular</b> {{network is}} highly {{characteristic}} to the individual, {{much like the}} way his fingerprint is. A non-obtrusive way to capture this information is through thermal imaging. The convective heat transfer effect from the flow of “hot ” arterial blood in superficial vessels creates characteristic thermal imprints, which are at a gradient with the surrounding tissue. This casts sigmoid edges on the human tissue where major blood vessels are present. We present an algorithmic methodology to extract and represent the facial vasculature. The methodology combines image morphology and probabilistic inference. The morphology captures the overall structure of the vascular network while the probabilistic part reflects the positional uncertainty for the vessel walls, due to the phenomenon of thermal diffusion. The accuracy of the methodology is tested through extensive experimentation and meticulous ground-truthing. Furthermore, the efficacy of this information for identity recognition is tested on substantial databases. ...|$|R

40|$|Background: Injection of dermal fillers {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{commonly}} performed procedures in the cosmetic dermatology practice. As its usage is expanding, the possibility of complications will likely increase. Objective: To review and summarize the complications associated with hyaluronic acid injections, and to provide a guide to avoiding them and managing these complications if they do occur. Methods: A comprehensive PubMed and Google scholar electronic database search was performed (2005 –July 2015). A total of fifty-five articles were selected and included. Results: Most of the complications associated with hyaluronic acid filler use are mild, transient and reversible. Serious complications due to vascular occlusion include cutaneous necrosis and blindness, which although rare can occur due to the compression of the vessel or direct intravascular injection. Conclusion: Injection related side effects are the most commonly seen, which are usually transient. Vascular occlusion is the most severe complication associated with hyaluronic acid filler injection.

40|$|The peptidergic sensory {{innervation}} of cranial {{blood vessels}} may {{play an important}} part in <b>vascular</b> head <b>pain.</b> The neuropeptides calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and substance P in sensory fibres are dependent on nerve growth factor (NGF) produced by the blood vessels, and when released from nerve terminals mediate neurogenic inflammation. NGF is increased in inflamed tissues, and acts via its high affinity receptor trk A on nociceptor fibres to produce hyperalgesia. CGRP and trk A immunoreactive nerve fibres have therefore been studied, for the first time, in inflamed (n= 7) and non-inflamed (n= 10) temporal arteries biopsied from patients with headache and suspected giant cell arteritis. CGRP immunoreactivity was markedly decreased to absent in adventitial nerve fibres in inflamed regions of vessels, which may reflect secretion from nerve terminals, as CGRP immunoreactivity could still be seen in nerve trunks in periadventitial tissue. Trk A immunoreactive nerve fibres were found in a similar distribution to CGRP containing nerve fibres in non-inflamed vessels, and the trk A immunoreactivity was virtually unchanged in inflamed vessels. The evidence supports a role for NGF related mechanisms in inflammatory <b>vascular</b> head <b>pain.</b> Anti-NGF or anti-trk A agents may represent novel analgesics in this condition. ...|$|R

None of these episodes was preceded or accompanied by loss of consciousness or ictal phenomena such as clonic jerks. It was suggested that these attacks were most likely episodes of hemiplegic migraine rather than epileptic seizures (2). The prevalence of migraine in Sturge– Weber syndrome was seen to be higher than in normal population (4). A patient with this syndrome, free of epileptic seizures for 10 years, started suffering from hemiplegic migraine attacks, without a family history for this disorder (5). Conversely, no case of headache was reported in a long-term outcome study regarding 52 adults with Sturge–Weber syndrome (1). The headache secondary to encephalotrigeminal angiomatosis {{was not included in the}} first edition of the International Headache Society (IHS) classification. In the second edition this headache was finally classified in group 6 (section 6. 3. 5), which includes the secondary headaches attributed to cranial or cervical vascular disorders (6) ...|$|R
