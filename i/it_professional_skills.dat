Data collected in 2006 and 2011 from organizations in Thailand was used to test the predictions and to identify similarities and differences among the sectors with respect to the importance of specific knowledge and skills associated with each part of the predicted structure.

40|$|This {{study is}} {{concerned}} with the positive effects, learnability and real-life skill knowledge transfer of commercial off-the-shelf video games. While extensive studies being carried out in exploring skill transfer from virtual world to real world in domains such as education and healthcare, it is felt that further study is needed to explore if these skills can be applied towards enhancing IT managerial skills. The focus of this study is on Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Games (MMORPGs). MMORPGs are 3 D online virtual worlds that allow players to interact with millions of other players through avatars. On the other hand, IT managerial skills definitions are determined by referencing the Skills Framework for Information Age (SFIA), a comprehensive ICT competency framework of nearly 100 <b>IT</b> <b>professional</b> <b>skills.</b> Thus this study is framed around answering the following question: What are the perceptions on the benefits of playing MMORPGs towards enhancing IT managerial skills...|$|E

40|$|In the {{contemporary}} business environment, the innovation {{and quality of}} the Information Technology (IT) industry’s products and services depend to a great extent on the knowledge, ability and talent applied by <b>IT</b> <b>professionals.</b> <b>IT</b> professionals’ <b>skills</b> and capacities to integrate, build, and reconfigure resources in the continuously evolving business environments is critical.

With these challenges in mind, this paper presents a study conducted with 72 <b>IT</b> <b>professionals</b> to test the importance that data analytics, entrepreneurial, and business skills have in enhancing employees’ dynamic capabilities and ultimately their perceived work performance.

For Hanne, a strategy for combining the two aims, family and personal satisfaction, was to look for a job that somehow related to her qualifications, offered new insights, but did not include the pressure of pursuing a career. This illustrates that working below one’s skill-level is not necessarily perceived as a devaluation of their cultural capital. On the contrary, it can add to their cultural capital when <b>it</b> offers new <b>professional</b> <b>skills</b> or personal experiences. These might even be transnationally valid, e.g. English-language proficiency or technical skills, and can later be converted into economic capital.|$|R

40|$|The primary {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to examine the experiential learning process of Japanese <b>IT</b> <b>professionals,</b> in order to investigate the nature of knowing. In this study we examined how <b>IT</b> <b>professionals</b> acquire job-related <b>skills</b> or expertise through experience. The semi-structured interviews were conducted with 10 high-performing senior managers in consulting divisions and 14 managers in project management divisions. The results suggest that the experiential learning process was different between consultants and project managers. Project managers had step-by-step experience in terms of task difficulty, while consultants had zero-based experience at middle stage. These results suggest that the appropriate experiential learning process depends on the task characteristics and the career stage. The results were discussed from the viewpoint of research on knowing (Cook and Brown, 1999; Orlikowski, 2002), experiential learning (Dixon, 1999; Kolb, 1984), and acquisition of expertise (Ericsson...|$|R

40|$|The {{dominance}} of the human capital approach in vocational skills development has been increasingly questioned for being de-humanised and de-contextualised. Contrary to this trend, the discourse in health <b>professional</b> <b>skills</b> development has shown increasing enthusiasm for consolidating this existing paradigm. To debate whether <b>professional</b> <b>skills</b> development should indeed be insulated from such scepticism, this paper examines one strategy adopted by the health professions. Called ‘task shifting’, this strategy involves re-delegating professional tasks to nonprofessional cadres according to a skills-based toolkit. Challenging the context-free approach to using this toolkit, this paper presents ethnographic evidence derived from {{a case study of}} pharmacy workforce issues in Malawi. It was found that task shifting was inhibited by a perception barrier about the moral and intellectual superiority of the pharmacists. Pharmacy technicians were judged to be unfit for a professional task because of a perceived lack of professional status, power and ethics. On tracing the origin of the inherent professional prowess assigned to the pharmacists, it was found that professionalism was an ideology borrowed from external sources, inter alia, colonial legacies and global health governance. This study exposes our hidden assumption about an axiomatic transferability of Anglo American skills development models to a postcolonial, aid-dependent context. This paper therefore suggests redefining this toolkit by bridging health research into dialogue with non-health disciplinary concerns such as postcolonialism and aiddependence. In conclusion, <b>it</b> argues that <b>professional</b> <b>skills</b> development is context-laden; and in need of a human-centred approach that involves true indigenousparticipation–challenges not unlike those faced by the vocational skills discourse...|$|R

50|$|The use of Positive Behavior Intervention Supports (PBIS) {{in schools}} is {{widespread}} (Sugai & Horner, 2002) {{in part because}} <b>it</b> is a <b>professional</b> <b>skill</b> in early special education programs (as opposed to Rogerian counseling). The program offers a primary, secondary, and tertiary level of intervention. A basic tenet of the PBIS approach includes identifying students {{in one of three}} categories based on risk for behavior problems. Once identified, students receive services in one of three categories: primary, secondary, or tertiary. To help practitioners with differences in interventions used at each of the levels the professional literature refers to a three-tiered (levels) model (Stewart, Martella, Marchand-Martella, & Benner, 2005; Sugai, Sprague, Horner & Walker, 2000; Tobin & Sugai, 2005; Walker et al., 1996.) Interventions are specifically developed for each of these levels with the goal of reducing the risk for academic or social failure. These interventions may be behavioral and or academic interventions incorporating scientifically proven forms of instruction such as direct instruction. The interventions become more focused and complex as one examines the strategies used at each level.|$|R
