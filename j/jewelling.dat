50|$|During the 20th century, the {{mechanical}} {{design of the}} watch became standardized, and advances were made in materials, tolerances, and production methods. The bimetallic temperature-compensated balance wheel was made obsolete by the discovery of low-thermal-coefficient alloys invar and elinvar. A balance wheel of invar with a spring of elinvar was almost unaffected by temperature changes, so it replaced the complicated temperature-compensated balance. The discovery in 1903 of a process to produce artificial sapphire made <b>jewelling</b> cheap. Bridge construction superseded 3/4 plate construction.|$|E
5000|$|The order {{had four}} classes {{and was only}} granted to female members of the British Royal Family and female courtiers. For the first three classes, the badge {{consisted}} of a medallion of Queen Victoria and Albert, The Prince Consort, differing in the width and <b>jewelling</b> of the border as the classes descend, whilst the fourth substitutes a jewelled cipher. All four were surmounted by a crown, which was attached to a bow of white silk moiré ribbon. The honour conferred no rank or title upon the recipient, but recipients were entitled to use the post-nominal letters [...] "VA".|$|E
50|$|The {{number of}} jewels used in watch {{movements}} {{increased over the}} last 150 years as jeweling grew less expensive and watches grew more accurate. The only bearings that {{really need to be}} jeweled in a watch are the ones in the going train - the gear train that transmits force from the mainspring barrel to the balance wheel - since only they are constantly under force from the mainspring. The wheels that turn the hands (the motion work) and the calendar wheels are not under load, while the ones that wind the mainspring (the keyless work) are used very seldom, so they do not wear significantly. Friction has the greatest effect in the wheels that move the fastest, so they benefit most from <b>jewelling.</b> So the first mechanism to be jeweled in watches was the balance wheel pivots, followed by the escapement. As more jeweled bearings were added, they were applied to slower moving wheels, and <b>jewelling</b> progressed up the going train toward the barrel. A 17 jewel watch has every bearing from the balance wheel to the center wheel pivot bearings jeweled, so it was considered a 'fully jeweled' watch. In quality watches, to minimize positional error, capstones were added to the lever and escape wheel bearings, making 21 jewels. Even the mainspring barrel arbor was sometimes jeweled, making the total 23. When self-winding watches were introduced in the 1950s, several wheels in the automatic winding mechanism were jeweled, increasing the count to 25-27.|$|E
50|$|Recipients (usually naval or army {{officers}} or representatives of Britain or France, highly {{present in the}} region during the Napoleonic Wars) were awarded a lozenge-shaped silver radiant star, embroidered in silver thread on an azure background with a star and crescent in the centre, and a red ribbon, to be worn with the crescent to the star's left. The order had two degrees, Knight First Class and Knight Second Class: the First Class members wore the insignia like a scarf, with the badge appendant (hung from the collar), whilst Second Class knights wore a slightly smaller version with no star, <b>jewelling</b> or ornamentation and a narrower ribbon saltier-wise (on a diagonal ribbon from one shoulder to the opposite waist).|$|E
5000|$|In retrospect therefore, {{it was a}} {{significant}} occasion when in 1767, Nevil Maskelyne presented John Arnold {{with a copy of}} the [...] "Principles of Mr. Harrison's Timekeeper" [...] {{as soon as it was}} published, evidently with a view to encourage him to make a precision timekeeper of the same kind. Maskelyne subsequently encouraged Arnold by employing him on several occasions, mostly in connection with watch and clock <b>jewelling.</b> In 1769, Arnold modified Maskelyne's centre seconds watch by John Ellicott, changing the cylinder escapement from steel to one made of sapphire.

5000|$|There is {{a debate}} among watch enthusiasts {{as to whether the}} COSC {{chronometer}} certification for a Swiss watch is a meaningful test or a simple marketing gimmick. On the one hand, when a watch maker intends to submit a movement for COSC testing, they frequently employ additional <b>jewelling</b> (i.e. to the barrel) and better quality [...] "Ébauche" [...] parts (i.e. higher quality hairsprings, mainsprings, balance wheels; regulators, etc.) all aimed at the coveted chronometer certification. On the other hand, it is likely that most good quality movements on the market today are capable of being tweaked, and timed to fall comfortably within the benchmark -4/+6 average daily rate criteria of the COSC. However, movements so submitted to COSC {{are more likely to be}} submitted with better quality parts in order to be confident of a successful test, and as a consequence may be more likely to maintain better timekeeping rates over the service life of the time piece.|$|E
50|$|Up to the 1720s, {{almost all}} watch {{movements}} {{were based on}} the verge escapement, which had been developed for large public clocks in the 14th century. This type of escapement involved a high degree of friction and did not include any kind of <b>jewelling</b> to protect the contacting surfaces from wear. As a result, a verge watch could rarely achieve any high standard of accuracy. (Surviving examples mostly run very fast, often gaining an hour a day or more.) The first widely used improvement was the cylinder escapement, developed by the Abbé de Hautefeuille early in the 18th century and applied by the English maker George Graham. Then, {{towards the end of the}} 18th century, the lever escapement (invented by Thomas Mudge in 1759) was put into limited production by a handful of makers including Josiah Emery (a Swiss based in London) and Abraham-Louis Breguet. With this, a domestic watch could keep time to within a minute a day. Lever watches became common after about 1820, and this type is still used in most mechanical watches today.|$|E
5000|$|Hoskins {{was born}} in Wells England. His finest miniatures Royal & Noble {{painting}} are at Ham House, Montagu House, Windsor Castle, Amsterdam and in the Pierpont Morgan collection and collection of the Victoria and Albert Museum. Vertue stated that Hoskins had a son, and Redgrave added that the son painted a portrait of James II in 1686 and was paid £10, 5s. for it, a statement for which {{there must have been}} some evidence, although it is not supported by any reference in the State Papers. there was a portrait painted of an unknown woman that was known to be the work of Sir John Hoskins , work As an important early miniature portrait by John who originally trained as an oil painter. His work is datable to about 1615 and shows the still dominant influence of Nicholas Hilliard (1547-1619). The red curtain background is typical for this time, a development of the flat blue background of Elizabethan (later 16th-century) miniatures. Red paint is laid in flat, but the artist then used a wet brush to lift the red paint in strokes, giving the effect of folds in a curtain. Hoskins has also painted the woman's pearl earring using Hilliard's <b>jewelling</b> technique. This involved laying on a raised blob of white lead paint with some shadowing to one side. This was then crowned with a rounded touch of real silver that was burnished with, to quote Hilliard, ‘a pretty little tooth of some ferret or stoat or other wild little beast’. This brought the silver to a sparkling highlight, while actual gold is used to paint the pearl’s gold setting. Silver tarnishes with age, and so this pearl now appears black. Twenty years later Hoskins was painting pearls and gold in a more painterly fashion, using white and yellow paint rather than actual gold or silver. This change was influenced by Charles I's court painter, Anthony van Dyck, who arrived in London from Antwerp in 1632 ...|$|E
