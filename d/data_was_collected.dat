5|$|The {{earthquake}} {{was among}} the first to be studied over a long term by the Chinese government. More than 40 Chinese seismologists, engineers, and geologists visited the disaster zone to conduct research into the cause and damage of the earthquake; some spending as much as a year collecting soil samples and recording other primary research evidence for future study. Such <b>data</b> <b>was</b> <b>collected</b> over a broad area of almost 1400 towns within the area.|$|E
5|$|In 1999 the {{population}} {{was estimated to be}} at less than 84, with 74 ewes. In 2002, there were between 92 and 100 animals, with 92 ewes and the male population estimated to be less than 7. In 2012, 204 ewes were registered in herdbooks. Since 2012, sheep numbers have been increasing year on year; and in 2017 the Rare Breeds Survival Trust (RBST) moved the classification of the sheep from 'Category 2: Critical' to 'Category 3: Vulnerable' as the number of breeding ewes was estimated to exceed 500. This <b>data</b> <b>was</b> <b>collected</b> from the herdbooks produced by breed societies, listing all registered sheep, and multiplying the number of registered sheep to account for non-registered sheep.|$|E

25|$|Data {{validity}} is {{an ongoing}} concern for life cycle analyses. Due to globalization and the rapid pace of research and development, new materials and manufacturing methods are continually being introduced to the market. This makes it both very important and very difficult to use up-to-date information when performing an LCA. If an LCA’s conclusions are to be valid, the data must be recent; however, the data-gathering process takes time. If a product and its related processes have not undergone significant revisions since the last LCA <b>data</b> <b>was</b> <b>collected,</b> data validity is not a problem. However, consumer electronics such as cell phones can be redesigned as often as every 9 to 12 months, creating a need for ongoing data collection.|$|E
25|$|Data {{from the}} General Social Survey {{shows that the}} {{percentage}} of Americans reporting predominately same-sex partners remained stable between 1991 and 2010. In contrast, the percentage who reported ever having a same-sex partner increased, especially among women. By contrast, the National Survey of Family Growth has found an increase in the share {{of men and women who}} self-report a bisexual orientation in their 2011–2013 study compared to previous surveys. Likewise, in the Second Australian Study of Health and Relationships, whose <b>data</b> <b>was</b> <b>collected</b> in 2012 and 2013, researchers noticed significant growth in the share of women who report bisexual orientation and attraction, and the share of men who report exclusive homosexual attraction, compared to the results of the First Australian Study of Health and Relationships, executed in 2001.|$|E

25|$|Mars 1 (1962 Beta Nu 1), an {{automatic}} interplanetary spacecraft launched to Mars on November 1, 1962, {{was the first}} probe of the Soviet Mars probe program to achieve interplanetary orbit. Mars 1 was intended to fly by the planet {{at a distance of}} about 11,000km and take images of the surface as well as send back data on cosmic radiation, micrometeoroid impacts and Mars' magnetic field, radiation environment, atmospheric structure, and possible organic compounds. Sixty-one radio transmissions were held, initially at two-day intervals and later at 5 day intervals, from which a large amount of interplanetary <b>data</b> <b>was</b> <b>collected.</b> On 21 March 1963, when the spacecraft was at a distance of 106,760,000km from Earth, on its way to Mars, communications ceased due to failure of its antenna orientation system.|$|E

500|$|The {{gay rights}} activist Dennis Altman wrote that Bell et al.′s {{conclusion}} {{that there is}} a powerful link between gender nonconformity and the development of homosexuality depended on the memories of their respondents, who were likely to have been influenced by social expectations about how homosexuals should conform to gender roles. Altman observed that Bell et al.′s <b>data</b> <b>was</b> <b>collected</b> in 1969 and 1970, prior to the [...] "growth of the modern gay movement and the development of the macho style among gay men". Altman criticized Bell et al. for confusing [...] "social roles with what is inborn", thereby underestimating the extent to which masculinity and femininity are social constructs.|$|E

2500|$|Sociological {{research}} into pornography and LDS individuals has included one BYU study that showed of 192 male BYU students ages 18–27, 100% {{of the sample}} considered viewing pornography [...] "unacceptable". However, 35% reported having used pornography in the past 12 months, with 9.2% of the entire sample reporting viewing pornography {{at least once in}} the last month. No <b>data</b> <b>was</b> <b>collected</b> on female students. A nationwide study of paid porn subscriptions showed that the predominantly LDS state of Utah had the highest subscription rate of any state. The state's LDS governor Gary Herbert officially declared pornography to be a public health crisis in Utah in 2016. In 2017 the church school BYU released a study using data gathered online from nearly 700 unmarried English-speaking adults on the effects of religiosity on perceptions of porn addictiveness and relationship anxiety. The results showed that seeing oneself as addicted to pornography generated far more anxiety- and shame-related negative outcomes individually and in romantic relationships than any negative effects of consuming sexually explicit material. Additionally, more religious individuals were more likely to consider themselves addicted to porn regardless of their comparative usage rate.|$|E
