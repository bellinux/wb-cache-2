The pigs are kept in the <b>hoop</b> usually as one large group (3 ̆e 150 head). The <b>hoop</b> is naturally ventilated. Bedding is added as the pigs grow. The <b>hoop</b> is cleaned after the pigs are marketed. Typical size for <b>hoops</b> is 30 ft × 84 ft for 200 market pigs. Wider <b>hoops</b> with steel truss arches are now on the market. Wider and longer <b>hoops</b> often have ridge vents to improve ventilation. Several companies are now marketing small-scale <b>hoops</b> of widths less than 20 ft These are often called utility shelters. The objective of this project was to demonstrate a small-scale <b>hoop</b> structure for swine. Low cost, small scale, versatility and quasitemporary status were emphasized...|$|R

40|$|By {{surveying}} 13 area extension livestock {{specialists in}} Iowa, {{it was estimated}} that there are 2, 100 <b>hoop</b> structures used for swine production in Iowa. Approximately 90 % of the <b>hoops</b> are used for feeding market pigs and the remaining 10 % are used for housing gestating sows. It was estimated there were 768 producers in Iowa with <b>hoops</b> for swine. Approximately 50 % of the producers are estimated to use composting of manure and approximately 40 % composted swine mortalities. Also, approximately 40 % of the producers with <b>hoops</b> were involved with contract feeding of pigs in <b>hoops.</b> This number of <b>hoops</b> would be capable of producing 1 million market pigs annually. The rapid adoption of <b>hoops</b> by Iowa farmers is attributed to the low costs and versatility of <b>hoop</b> structures. Many niche markets are emerging for which hoop-reared pigs would qualify...|$|R
50|$|The coupler {{face has}} a {{protruding}} cone and a matching cup. Inside the cone {{there is a}} rigid metal <b>hoop</b> connected to a revolving, spring-loaded metal disk with a notch on the opposite side. When ready to couple, the spring turns the disk so the <b>hoop</b> is extended from the cone; as the cars meet the <b>hoop</b> enters the cup on the other coupler, stopping against the disk. The <b>hoops</b> are then pressed back into their own coupler, causing the disks to rotate until the notches align with the <b>hoops.</b> After the <b>hoops</b> have entered the notches the disks spring back into the <b>hoop</b> extended position, locking the coupling. In the coupled position forces on the <b>hoops</b> and disk will balance out, {{which means that the}} Scharfenberg is not dependent on heavy latches to stay locked as many other couplers are.|$|R
