500|$|He {{became one}} of the most vocal critics of the Obama administration's {{handling}} of the September 11, 2012, attack on the U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi, saying it was a [...] "debacle" [...] that featured either [...] "a massive cover-up or incompetence that is not acceptable" [...] and that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> the Watergate scandal. [...] As part of this, he and a few other senators were successful in blocking the planned nomination of Ambassador to the UN Susan Rice to succeed Hillary Rodham Clinton as U.S. Secretary of State; McCain's friend and colleague John Kerry was nominated instead.|$|E
500|$|President of the Cambridge University Boat Club, Max Justicz, {{said of the}} {{previous}} year's race: [...] "We were burned on that day. Badly burned. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> other defeats because {{we thought we could}} win ... Oxford just rowed through us; with every stroke they took they destroyed our belief in ourselves." [...] His crew mate, Nick Clarry, focused on the approach to this year's race: [...] "This year it's heads down and get on with the job. [...] We know that if we don't cross the line first on the day, nobody could care less who we are." ...|$|E
60|$|Doubtful! <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> that. A {{week later}} they sailed {{straight}} over them.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is terrible, madamigella," [...] he said, rising. [...] "I know it. I would fain {{have lived}} single-heartedly, for I think I was made so; {{but now you}} see how black and deadly a lie my life <b>is.</b> <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> you could have imagined, <b>is</b> <b>it</b> not? <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> {{the life of the}} cruelest bigot, for he at least {{believes}} in himself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Beast!" [...] he hissed--"beast and no man! <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> treachery to <b>be</b> so witless. We may all be shent for thy sotting." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Believe me, sister, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> useless. I {{have spoken}} with the officer of the guard, and the command is a {{stringent}} one." ...|$|R
60|$|He said {{to himself}} that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> yesterday. He {{wondered}} if it would go on getting worse every day.|$|E
6000|$|... "Father--father," [...] cried Flambeau {{with the}} French gesture and {{stepping}} yet more rapidly forward, [...] "do you mean <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> that?" ...|$|E
60|$|His son looked up, {{but said}} nothing. Again {{he knew what}} was coming, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> {{anything}} that had gone before.|$|E
6000|$|CHARMIAN. He {{makes you}} so terribly prosy and serious and learned and philosophical. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> being religious, at OUR ages. (The ladies laugh.) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So {{they ought}} to," [...] Harry broke in. [...] "He has striven, by false swearing, to bring {{innocent}} {{men to the}} scaffold. Why, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> murder." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, chief," [...] Harry said, [...] "have {{you arrived}} at any {{way out of}} this? <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{the last time we}} got caught in this valley." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> {{useless to}} talk {{of what might have}} been, and the little party settled down to make {{themselves}} as comfortable as possible under the circumstances.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{was quite}} absurd; with Lady Laura Kennedy <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> absurd. And there was Lady Glencora, and Violet Effingham, who married Lady Laura's brother, and that Madame Goesler, whom I hate,--and ever so many others." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{thought this}} washing down the decks {{was the most}} foolish thing in the world, and besides {{that it was the}} most uncomfortable. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> my mother's house-cleanings at home, which I used to abominate so.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hush! Let me handle this, for <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> I thought. Margaret, tell me {{the whole}} story," [...] {{commanded}} Mrs. March, sitting down by Meg, yet keeping hold of Jo, lest she should fly off.|$|R
6000|$|G. I know <b>it</b> <b>is,</b> <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> that. I don't care. You've ridden Van Loo. Is he {{the sort}} of brute to pick his way--'specially when we're coming up in column of troop with any pace on? ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Altogether, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> I {{could have}} thought possible,' said Philip. I could have {{believed}} him unstable and thoughtless; but the concealment, and the attempting to gain poor Amy's affections {{in the midst}} of such a course--' ...|$|R
60|$|At last it was finished. Ruth {{thought it}} splendid. Sybil Wilbur {{pronounced}} it cute, {{as she did}} most things. Kirk could hardly bear to look at it. In its finished state <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> he could have believed possible.|$|E
6000|$|Sidney {{turned away}} and hid her burning face against the cool white bark of the birch tree behind her. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> she had even thought it would be. He was so handsome, so manly, so earnest-eyed! Oh, what a friend to lose! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] Jim replied, [...] "we {{might get}} one of the big boats through it now; but it's going to be worse, presently. When I went out, last year, with a boat to the brig which was driven ashore, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> this.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I wish some stop could <b>be</b> put to <b>it.</b> <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> Percy knows. She can't {{speak to}} a man without flirting, and we shall have her turning some poor fellow's head, like Wingfield's. I don't think <b>it</b> <b>is</b> respectable!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, Angus Macdonald," [...] {{said the}} trader sternly, [...] "I'll not sell it. I've told you already more <b>than</b> once, and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> ill-judged, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> impertinent {{of you to}} come bothering me to part with my land." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{would not}} have {{believed}} it if I had not seen it," [...] Captain Rintoul said. [...] "The man was absolutely helpless with fright; I never saw such an exhibition; and then his fainting afterwards and having to be carried away was disgusting; in fact, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, Mr. Arthurs, what players they are!" [...] exclaimed Ken. [...] "I {{never saw}} such running, such hitting. You said they'd hit to right field like bullets, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> bullets. And Dreer!... When {{he came up}} my heart just stopped beating." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{forthwith}} made an adroit {{allusion to}} my long friend. But <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> useless. The Vineyarder swore {{he would have}} nothing to do with him--he (my long friend) was a [...] "bird" [...] from Sydney, and nothing would make him (the man of little faith) believe otherwise.|$|E
6000|$|... "Come!" [...] said Ghek. [...] "We {{will return}} to the tower." [...] The deadly {{monotone}} of his voice was unbroken. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> anger, for it revealed nothing of his intentions. It but increased her horror of these great brains that were beyond the possibility of human emotions.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I don't {{know that}} <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> a belief {{which is no}} belief,' said the priest with energy;--'than a creed which sits so easily on a man {{that he does not}} even know what it contains, and never asks himself as he repeats <b>it,</b> whether <b>it</b> <b>be</b> to him {{credible}} or incredible.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Septimius, I am weak,--a weak, weak girl,--only a girl, Septimius; only {{eighteen}} yet," [...] exclaimed Sibyl. [...] "It <b>is</b> young, <b>is</b> <b>it</b> not? I {{might be}} forgiven much. You know not how bitter my {{purpose was to}} you. But look, Septimius,--could <b>it</b> <b>be</b> <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> this? Hush, <b>be</b> still! Do not stir!" ...|$|R
60|$|Let its self-emptying and buoyant qualities be ever so good, {{you have}} only to upset it to render it no {{better than any other}} boat;--indeed, in a sense, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> other boats, because it leads men to face danger which they would not dare to {{encounter}} in an ordinary boat.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{started for}} home before nine o'clock, sir," [...] she told him, [...] "but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> ever to-night. All the way {{along by the}} sea I seemed to hear their voices, so I came back. I came back to listen. I have been {{listening}} for an hour." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, you liar!" [...] And {{with these}} passionate words Jane Withersteen succumbed to fury. For {{the second time}} in her life she fell into the ungovernable rage that had been her father's weakness. And <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> his, for she was a jealous woman--jealous even of her friends.|$|E
6000|$|Now {{this would}} never do; <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> the butterflies! She {{rose to her}} full height--four feet eleven and a half--and drew her cloak over her shoulders. [...] "I think I {{will return to the}} house," [...] she said quietly; [...] "I suppose I ought not to overtask my strength." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{design is}} {{judged to be}} [...] "Pareto optimal" [...] (equivalently, [...] "Pareto efficient" [...] or in the Pareto set) if <b>it</b> <b>is</b> not {{dominated}} by any other design: If <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> another design in some respects and no better in any respect, then <b>it</b> <b>is</b> dominated and is not Pareto optimal.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes. We did not quarrel this time, Ethelberta and I. If I may so put <b>it,</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> quarrelling. We felt <b>it</b> <b>was</b> no use {{going on}} any longer, and so--Come, Faith, hear what I say, or else {{tell me that}} you won't hear, and that I may as well save my breath!' ...|$|R
6000|$|I can't repeat it, friends. I ne'er could school [...] Myself {{to quote}} {{from any other}} fool: [...] A jest, if <b>it</b> <b>were</b> <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> mine, would start [...] My tears; if better, it would break my heart. [...] So, if you please, I'll hold you but to state [...] That royal Jester's melancholy fate.|$|R
