2500|$|Early-18th-century {{descriptions}} of the old town of Brighton (the present Lanes) concentrated on how small and low the houses were, and how the lower storeys were characteristically set slightly below ground level. [...] This, and {{the proximity of the}} houses to each other, may have offered protection against storms and flooding from the sea. (In one of the earliest {{descriptions of}} Brighton - a letter dated 1736 - the rector of Buxted claims that [...] "we live here underground almost ... the second storey is finished something under 12 feet.") [...] "Huddling together" [...] may have also helped the houses survive to the present day: they were poorly built and had little structural integrity. [...] Typical Lanes buildings are timber-framed and plastered with load-bearing walls of bungaroosh with some <b>flint.</b> <b>Brick</b> quoins and courses added strength, and façades were often studded with pebbles from the beach. [...] These would sometimes be coated with tar to keep water out, although this only became common in the early 19th century. [...] In The Lanes, such buildings can be seen at Bartholomews, Middle Street and Ship Street among others.|$|E

25|$|Pale yellow bricks {{have been}} made locally since about 1780, and are {{commonly}} encountered as a building material. Flint is the other predominant structural material: its local abundance has ensured its frequent use. The combination of <b>flint</b> and red <b>brick</b> is characteristic of Worthing. In particular, walls built alongside streets or to mark out boundaries were almost always built of <b>flint</b> with <b>brick</b> dressings, especially in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.|$|R
50|$|There was a {{messuage}} with Brays manor in 1279, but by 1545 {{the house}} on the site had gone. By 1730 the house for the manor was Little Farm, east of the churchyard. This was later combined with the house next door to form Norman Hall, which in 1867 was sold and ceased to be a farmhouse. The oldest part of Norman Hall is not Norman at all but a 15th-century timber-framed medieval hall with a cross-wing. It was altered in the 16th century and added to in the 18th and 19th centuries. The exterior is finished with a combination of <b>flint,</b> <b>brick</b> and 18th-century pargetting.|$|E
50|$|A {{feature of}} the village is the mill pond which {{stretches}} along {{the western edge of}} the main street. The mill pond is filled by the River Mun. The pond is home to many species of water fowl and is very popular with local fisherman. The area beyond the river is said to have been part of the stew pond, the fish-breeding place of a small monastery. Close to the mill pond is the rebuilt corn mill. The original watermill burnt down during the night of 15 February 1979. A mill mentioned in the Domesday Book stood on this location. The one previous to the present building was built in the 18th century of <b>flint,</b> <b>brick</b> and pantiles. The pit for the original water wheel still remains, as does the old diesel engine, which provided power to the mill for many years.|$|E

5000|$|The {{church is}} {{constructed}} in <b>flint,</b> <b>brick</b> and conglomerate, {{some of which}} has been rendered. The dressings are in limestone, and the roof is thatch. Its plan consists of a nave, a chancel with an apse, and a west tower. The tower is round, and dates possibly back to the 11th century. In {{the lower part of the}} tower are small lancet windows, and around the upper part are single-light bell openings. The parapet is decorated with brick, flint and limestone chequerwork. The south doorway has two orders of shafts, and its arch is decorated with zigzags. In the south wall of the nave are two two-light windows containing Y-tracery, and between them is a blocked round-headed window, partly cut by a later lancet which is also blocked. Around the apsidal chancel are round-headed blind arcades in pairs, in some places pierced by lancets. Between the arcades are pilaster buttresses. The east window has a pointed arch, and two lights with Y-tracery. The north wall contains a blocked round-headed window pierced with a lancet, which is also blocked, a single-light window, and a two-light window with Y-tracery. [...] The north doorway is more ornate than the south, also with two orders of shafts, but six orders in the arch and more detailed decoration.|$|E

5000|$|A quieter {{house was}} needed {{and the site}} in Beech was {{acquired}} in 1895. This was initially used to care for retired or ill seamen in temporary wood and metal buildings. The current buildings were designed by Sir Charles Nicholson, using Tintern Abbey as a model. The first monks did much of the construction using local flint, including a <b>flint</b> and <b>brick</b> Gatehouse (1901). The Abbey church, designed by John Cyril Hawes (<b>flint</b> and <b>brick,</b> built 1901-07), is dedicated to [...] "Our Lady and Saint John".Having observed the Rule of St Benedict from 1893 the community formally adopted it on 28 January 1981.In 1989 another charity undertook the society's work with seafarers. The community now runs retreats and courses for the public in guest rooms.|$|R

5000|$|Lloyd {{adopted a}} {{symmetrical}} [...] "H" [...] plan, {{with the main}} rectangular block of eight stories set back from the street with courtyard in front, and wings of seven stories to either side. The design maximised light and air, but broke the building line along Savile Row. It was constructed using a reinforced concrete frame with reinforced concrete floors and a flat roof. The façades on Savile Row and New Burlington Street were faced with Portland stone; other sides, including New Burlington Place, and internal courtyards were faced in brown Uxbridge <b>flint</b> <b>bricks.</b> The building had little ornamentation: rustication {{on the ground floor}} disguised a change in levels along Savile Row, and a dental cornice {{at the top of the}} central block. A large entrance porch to central block, with pilasters surmounted by a recessed semi-circular headed niche within an open triangular pediment. Decorative sculptural motifs were carved by Laurence Turner.|$|R

Large meadows stretched away to {{the banks of the}} Itchen, with cattle grazing in them, but in one was a set of figures to whom the lay brother pointed with a laugh of exulting censure.|$|R
50|$|By Victorian times Preston Candover and Nutley had a {{population}} of over 500 people. The land was divided between six main farms, {{ranging in size from}} 200 to 1000 acre. The village at Preston formed a long straggling settlement. The cottages were a mixture of styles, some timber framed, others built of <b>brick</b> or of <b>flint</b> with <b>brick</b> dressings. The roofs were either thatched or tiled.|$|R

50|$|Taking {{a special}} {{interest}} in ancient art, he travelled widely in the 1920s and 1930s to France, Italy, Greece, Egypt and England. From 1929, he abandoned painting in favour of sculpture. As a sculptor, he was inventive and imaginative, often working with unusual materials such as <b>flint,</b> gravel, <b>brick</b> and rusty nails. His works include two large reliefs at Vestre Cemetery, Begravelse (Burial, 1940-49) and Opstandelse (Resurrection, 1948-49), and Dronning Dagmar (Queen Dagmar) together with Steen Eiler Rasmussen in Ringsted's churchyard.|$|R
50|$|The school values its {{historic}} {{links with the}} community some of whom remember being taught in the original Victorian buildings. These traditional <b>flint</b> and <b>brick</b> buildings now form the hall and the school kitchen. The main teaching area consists of six modern classrooms with shared corridor working spaces. The most recent classroom was built in 2001 and is specially equipped for Early Years children. The school {{is one of the}} feeder schools from Perins School, which both obtain high standards.|$|R
