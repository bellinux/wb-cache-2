The bearings selected for investigation were an 8 mm bore-sized <b>deep-groove</b> <b>ball</b> <b>bearing</b> lubricated with a sputtered MoS 2 film and that lubricated with an ion-plated Ag film, commercially delivered from three Japanese domestic bearing-manufacturers. Based on survey results of tribological {{requirements for the}} existing satellite mechanisms, four types of bearing tests were defined and conducted: a vacuum test at room temperature, an atmosphere-resistant test, a thermal vacuum test and a vibration test.

This paper {{presents}} the dynamics-simulation and research of vibration characteristic on <b>deep-groove</b> <b>ball</b> <b>bearing.</b> It introduces {{an analysis of}} the vibration frequency in different damage of bearing and spectrum analysis of the fault signal on bearing to draw response on vibration characteristics in bearing, so as to provide a simple method on research of dynamic fault characteristic of bearing. This work shows some kind, characteristics signal and frequency of fault on bearing. The normal model and other two models which have raceway crack in inside track and out ring are set up by using ADAMS software to analyse the dynamic of them, the test program that vibration signal of three models are obtained by acceleration sensors to instead of that of real condition is simulated. In addition, the test signal of vibration is given in time domain respectively, and the vibration characteristic is identification by using spectrum analysis method, so that it can provides technical support for diagnosis of fault bearing. In the study of fault diagnosis, several experimental results provide that the uncertainty of fault diagnosis and interference of other complicated factors are avoided effectively in real environment. The result of simulated analysis is consistent with the theory calculation. This method is more effective, convenient and expansibility than a research of practical fault-diagnosis...|$|E
40|$|An {{ultrasonic}} pulse {{striking a}} thin layer of liquid trapped between solid bodies will be partially reflected. The proportion reflected {{is a function of the}} layer stiffness, which in turn depends on the film thickness and its bulk modulus. In this work, measurements of reflection have been used to determine the thickness of oil films in elastohydrodynamic lubricated (EHL) contacts. A very thin liquid layer behaves like a spring when struck by an ultrasonic pulse. A simple quasi-static spring model can be used to determine the proportion of the ultrasonic waves reflected. Experiments have been performed on a model EHL contact between a ball and a flat surface. A transducer is mounted above the contact such that the ultrasonic wave is focused onto the oil film. The reflected signals are captured and passed to a PC for processing. Fourier analysis gives the reflection spectrum that is then used to determine the stiffness of the liquid layer and hence its thickness. In further testing, an ultrasonic transducer has been mounted in the housing of a <b>deep-groove</b> <b>ball</b> <b>bearing</b> to measure the film generated at the outer raceway as each ball passes. Results from both the ball-flat and ball bearing measurements agree well with steady-state theoretical EHL predictions. The limits of the measuring technique, in terms of the measurable rolling bearing size and operating parameters, have been investigated...|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} hoop {{stresses}} on the rolling-element fatigue life of angular-contact and <b>deep-groove</b> <b>ball</b> <b>bearings</b> was determined for common inner-ring interference fits at the ABEC- 5 tolerance level. The analysis {{was applied to}} over 1150 bearing configurations and load cases. Hoop stresses were superimposed on the Hertzian principal stresses created by the applied bearing load to calculate the inner-race maximum shearing stress. The resulting fatigue life of the bearing was recalculated {{through a series of}} equations. The reduction in the fatigue life is presented as life factors that are applied to the unfactored bearing life. The life factors found in this study ranged from 1. 00 (no life reduction) [...] where there was no net interface pressure [...] to a worst case of 0. 38 (a 62 -percent life reduction). For a given interference fit, the reduction in life is different for angular-contact and <b>deep-groove</b> <b>ball</b> <b>bearings.</b> Interference fits also affect the maximum Hertz stress-life relation. Experimental data of Czyzewski, showing the effect of interference fit on rolling-element fatigue life, were reanalyzed to determine the shear stress-life exponent.

Many {{of the findings}} were revolutionary and are still considered quite modem. The method used by Stribeck to calculate load distribution between the balls within a <b>ball</b> <b>bearing</b> is still used today, otherwise, a full finite element analysis would be required. His measurements and analysis of bearing friction is also astonishingly accurate. Most of the ball-bearing types studied by Stribeck are not in use any more, but the <b>deep-groove</b> <b>ball</b> <b>bearings</b> he investigated were similar enough to be compared with modern <b>deep-groove</b> <b>ball</b> <b>bearings.</b> Stribeck measured the friction coefficient 0. 0015 and SKF gives the friction coefficient 0. 0015 for <b>deep-groove</b> <b>ball</b> <b>bearings</b> in the catalogue from 1989. For the first time, in the SKF catalogue from 1989, the life calculation method took into account contamination also. Stribeck had stated already 100 years ago that cleanliness was very important for bearing life and function. Stribeck's investigation of journal bearing friction, {{as a function of}} load and speed, was also extremely important, as he showed the possibility of finding a point of minimum friction for lubricated applications. He also showed that the friction for sliding bearings started at high friction at low speeds, decreased to a minimum friction when metal to metal contact stopped, and then increased again at higher speeds, which is the well known 'Stribeck curve'.

40|$|Ultrasound is {{reflected}} from a liquid layer between two solid bodies. This reflection {{depends on the}} ultrasonic frequency, the acoustic properties of the liquid and solid, and the layer thickness. If the wavelength {{is much greater than}} the liquid-layer thickness, then the response is governed by the stiffness of the layer. If the wavelength and layer thickness are similar, then the interaction of ultrasound with the layer is controlled by its resonant behaviour. This stiffness governed response and resonant response can be used to determine the thickness of the liquid layer, if the other parameters are known. In this paper, ultrasound has been developed as a method to determine the thickness of lubricating films in bearing systems. An ultrasonic transducer is positioned on the outside of a bearing shell such that the wave is focused on the lubricant-film layer. The transducer is used to both emit and receive wide-band ultrasonic pulses. For a particular lubricant film, the reflected pulse is processed to give a reflection-coefficient spectrum. The lubricant-film thickness is then obtained from either the layer stiffness or the resonant frequency. The method has been validated using fluid wedges at ambient pressure between flat and curved surfaces. Experiments on the elastohydrodynamic film formed between a sliding ball and a flat surface were performed. Film-thickness values in the range 50 - 500 nm were recorded, which agreed well with theoretical film-formation predictions. Similar measurements have been made on the oil film between the balls and outer raceway of a <b>deep-groove</b> <b>ball</b> <b>bearing.</b> ...|$|E

40|$|Radial load is {{of great}} {{significant}} influence on friction characteristic and fatigue life of rolling bearings. A frictional torque analysis {{was performed on the}} radially loaded SKF- 6205 <b>deep-groove</b> <b>ball</b> <b>bearings.</b> The frictional torque formula was proposed as the sum of the frictional torques caused by elastic hysteresis, elastic hydrodynamic lubrication, differential slip, spinning friction of balls, friction between the balls and the cage pockets, and friction between the cages and the guiding lands. The experiments were carried out with the bearing with lubrication and the other one without lubrication under different radial loads and rotational speeds. In order to avoid the frictional torque measurement errors caused by the unequal length of arms, a positive–negative test method is employed to test bearing frictional torque. The experimental results showed that the frictional torque caused by radial loads played a leading role in all the frictional torque components of the bearing. Ultimately, a special theoretical model of frictional torque for <b>deep-groove</b> <b>ball</b> <b>bearings</b> was verified through comparing with the experimental results and SKF torque model.
