500|$|In May 2008, the Wynn Las Vegas casino filed a civil {{complaint}} against Barkley, alleging {{that he had}} failed to pay a $400,000 debt stemming from October 2007. Barkley responded by taking blame for letting time lapse on the repayment of the debt and promptly paid the casino. After repaying his debt, Barkley stated during a pregame show on TNT, [...] "I've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> gambling...I am not going to gamble anymore. For right now, the next year or two, I'm not going to gamble... Just because I can afford to lose money doesn't mean I should do it." ...|$|E
500|$|... "I {{had already}} raved over the record because it leaked. I was like listen, {{there is no}} way this [...] be on your album, you'd have to be crazy. He was like 'Really, you think so?' I was like c'mon man we <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> {{treating}} rap like oh it came out it's dead. When it's good, we have to make people love it and digest it. We can't treat this like mixtape throwaways like everybody else does. Everybody else does half-ass music. So what people don't know is that what Kanye did during that album is literally, I walked into the studio and I had the pick of 17 records and he was like {{do what you want to}} do to any of these, do what you like." ...|$|E
2500|$|On December 14, 1985, Taylor married actress Kathryn Walker at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in New York. She {{had helped}} him get off heroin and Taylor's next albums were {{partially}} successful; in 1988, he released Never Die Young, highlighted with the charting title track, and in 1991, the platinum New Moon Shine provided Taylor some popular songs with the melancholic [...] "Copperline" [...] and the upbeat [...] "(I've <b>Got</b> <b>to)</b> <b>Stop</b> Thinkin' About That", both hit singles on Adult Contemporary radio. In the late 1980s, he began touring regularly, especially on the summer amphitheater circuit. His later concerts feature songs spanning his career and are marked by the musicianship of his band and backup singers. The 1993 two-disc Live album captures this, with a highlight being Arnold McCuller's descants in the codas of [...] "Shower the People" [...] and [...] "I Will Follow". In 1995, Taylor performed {{the role of the}} Lord in Randy Newman's Faust.|$|E

2500|$|UCI {{director}} Pat McQuaid urged team {{directors and}} the riders to take responsibility: [...] "The teams {{need to have}} {{more control over their}} riders.."They are the ones who need to clean out the riders who are iffy, they need to ensure they can guarantee that everyone of their riders is riding clean and riding fairly. The evidence {{is that most of the}} time these riders are dealing with individuals from outside their team and the sport whether it be pseudo doctors and chemists who are promising them things. That has <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop.</b> More and more riders...are speaking out and it's the younger generation of riders coming in that are going to be the future of the sport. They have to come into a system that is completely ethically correct. But at the end of the day, the rider is the one who makes the decisions..We are in the process of changing that culture and it will change in time. We need to weed out the bad apples. I hope next year we have a Tour de France with no positive tests. We've had two bad Tour de Frances, we cannot afford a third." ...|$|E
2500|$|During the 2012 {{presidential primary}} campaign, {{when asked what}} the federal government’s role should be in {{responding}} to natural disasters, Romney suggested that responsibility for handling disasters should be taken from FEMA, the federal agency dedicated to disaster relief, and given to the states, or outsourced to the private sector: [...] "Every time you have an occasion to take something {{from the federal government}} and send it back to the states, that's the right direction. And if you can go even further, and send it back to the private sector, that's even better. Instead of thinking in the federal budget, what we should cut -- we should ask ourselves the opposite question. What should we keep? We should take all of what we're doing at the federal level and say, what are the things we're doing that we don't have to do? And those things we've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> doing, because we're borrowing $1.6 trillion more this year than we're taking in." [...] Asked whether by that he specifically meant disaster relief, he replied, “we cannot afford to do those things without jeopardizing the future for our kids. It is simply immoral, in my view, for us to continue to rack up larger and larger debts and pass them on to our kids, knowing full well that we'll all be dead and gone before it's paid off. It makes no sense at all.” ...|$|E

60|$|I {{found myself}} that the cries were {{singularly}} irritating, and they grew in depth and intensity {{as the afternoon}} wore on.
