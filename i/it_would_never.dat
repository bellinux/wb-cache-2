5|$|The 189th Infantry Brigade {{was first}} {{constituted}} and activated on 24 June 1921 in the Organized Reserves, and {{assigned to the}} 95th Division. The brigade was organized in 1922 at Muskogee, Oklahoma. However, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> be mobilized for World War I, and thus never received participation credit for the action. It would stay active as a reserve brigade for the interwar period, but <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> be used.|$|E
5|$|Aposematism is {{paradoxical}} {{in evolutionary}} terms, {{as it makes}} individuals conspicuous to predators, so they may be killed and the trait eliminated before predators learn to avoid it. If warning colouration puts the first few individuals at such a strong disadvantage, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> last in the species long enough to become beneficial.|$|E
5|$|My {{interpretation}} {{is that she}} isn’t {{trying to keep the}} secret. That she doesn’t care. She changed her last name to avoid getting kidnapped, but really, if anyone figured it out and asked her, she’d just probably be like “Yeah, shut up!” or whatever. I feel like everyone at ISIS is so self-involved and so concerned with furthering their own agenda that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> occur to them to think that anyone else has anything else going on.|$|E

5|$|The Angels' {{fortunes}} {{began to}} change when they were swept by Boston from August 21–23, then after winning one game over Baltimore, went into a 9-game losing streak beginning August 25. Seattle had an August record of 16–13 (.552), while California had an August record of 13–17 (.433). Seattle took second place on September 2, with Texas in a losing streak <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> recover from.|$|E
5|$|While {{playing in}} the minors, Crozier adopted the {{butterfly}} style of goaltending, which he would later use during his NHL career. This technique was popularized by Glenn Hall and was improved upon by Crozier. Initially, his minor league coaches tried to convince him to abandon this style, thinking that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> succeed in the NHL. Crozier also added an element of acrobacy in his game.|$|E
5|$|Following the Glorious Revolution of 1688 in England, {{when the}} Catholic King James II of England was deposed and the Protestant William III ascended the throne, a {{rebellion}} of Maryland Puritan Protestants overthrew Calvert's rule. They quickly rescinded the Toleration Act and banned public practice of Catholicism, and <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> be reinstated under colonial rule. In fact, the colony established the Church of England as its official church in 1702 and explicitly barred Catholics from voting in 1718. The Calvert family regained {{control over the}} colony in 1715, but only after Benedict Calvert converted to Protestantism. His political control remained tenses enough {{that he did not}} risk an attempt to reinstate protections for Catholics. It took until the era of the American Revolution for religious tolerance or freedom to again become the practice in Maryland.|$|E

5|$|Ireland was {{important}} to Henry, both {{as a source of}} royal revenue – an average of £1,150 was sent from Ireland to the Crown each year during the middle of his reign – and as a source of estates that could be granted to his supporters. The major landowners looked eastwards towards Henry's court for political leadership, and many also possessed estates in Wales and England. The 1240s saw major upheavals in land ownership due to deaths among the barons, enabling Henry to redistribute Irish lands to his supporters. In the 1250s, the King gave out numerous grants of land along the frontier in Ireland to his supporters, creating a buffer zone against the native Irish; the local Irish kings began to suffer increased harassment as English power increased across the region. These lands were in many cases unprofitable for the barons to hold and English power reached its zenith under Henry for the medieval period. In 1254, Henry granted Ireland to his son, Edward, on condition that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> be separated from the Crown.|$|E
5|$|Similarly {{they decided}} that the United Kingdom could not {{exercise}} any judicial power over Australia, {{with the end of}} appeals to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, and the court's previous decision, in Kirmani v Captain Cook Cruises Pty Ltd (No 2) that the limited purpose of a certificate of appeal, was spent and that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> again grant a certificate of appeal. They also decided that no executive power existed over Australia, as although the sovereign monarch of Australia and the sovereign monarch of the United Kingdom are the same person, it had been accepted {{for a long time that}} the monarch acts in Australian matters on the advice of Australian ministers, and does not accept the advice of United Kingdom ministers in Australian matters at all.|$|E
5|$|Taylor's exhortations to the Vietnamese {{officers}} to remove Khánh {{were not a}} secret, and it had an unwanted side-effect; it accelerated coup action from figures not favored by Washington. The likes of Kỳ, Thiệu, Có and Cang were {{not yet ready to}} stage a coup, and their preparations were well behind those of Thảo, an unstinting plotter. On February 14, the commander of the Marine Brigade General Lê Nguyên Khang reported to an American official that he was involved in plotting against Khánh but said he and the other Young Turks were not ready because the military was not sufficiently united. He said they had to wait for a time when a coup could be carried out without generating unspecified side-effects. Khang was aware Thảo was planning a move with some generals who were now on the outer. He anticipated trouble in trying to keep his subordinates from joining Thảo, as his men might not wait for the younger generals to launch their coup if they thought <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> come.|$|E

5|$|The battle exacted a heavy {{toll on the}} 1st Airborne Division {{from which}} <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> recover. Three {{quarters}} of the formation were missing when it returned to England, including {{two of the three}} brigade commanders, eight of the nine battalion commanders and 26 of the 30 infantry company commanders. Some 500 men were still in hiding north of the Rhine, and over the coming months many of these were able to escape: initially in Operation Pegasus. New recruits, escapees and repatriated POWs joined the division over the coming months, but the division was still so much weakened that the 4th Parachute Brigade had to be merged into the 1st Parachute Brigade, and the division as a whole could barely produce two brigades of infantry. Between May and August 1945, many of the men were sent to Denmark and Norway to oversee the German surrenders there but on their return the division was disbanded.|$|E
5|$|After {{the release}} of The Castle of Cagliostro, Miyazaki began working on his ideas for an {{animated}} film adaptation of Richard Corben's comic book Rowlf and pitched the idea to Yutaka Fujioka at TMS. In November 1980, a proposal was drawn up to acquire the film rights. Around that time, Miyazaki was also approached {{for a series of}} magazine articles by the editorial staff of Animage. During subsequent conversations, he showed his sketchbooks and discussed basic outlines for envisioned animation projects with editors Toshio Suzuki and Osamu Kameyama, who saw the potential for collaboration on their development into animation. Two projects were proposed: , to be set in the Sengoku period; and the adaptation of Corben's Rowlf. Both were rejected, as the company was unwilling to fund anime projects not based on existing manga, and the rights for the adaptation of Rowlf could not be secured. An agreement was reached that Miyazaki could start developing his sketches and ideas into a manga for the magazine with the proviso that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> be made into a film. The manga—titled Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind—ran from February 1982 to March 1994. The story, as re-printed in the tankōbon volumes, spans seven volumes for a combined total of 1060 pages. Miyazaki drew the episodes primarily in pencil, and it was printed monochrome in sepia toned ink. Miyazaki resigned from Telecom Animation Film in November 1982.|$|E

25|$|The {{scheme was}} devised by C. Y. O'Connor who oversaw its design {{and most of}} the {{construction}} project. Although supported by Premier Forrest, O'Connor had to deal with widespread criticism and derision from members of the Western Australian Parliament as well as the local press based on a belief that the scope of the engineering task was too great and that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> work.|$|E

After the bankruptcy, the aviation authorities were criticized for giving the schedule concession in 1967 to Fjellfly as the privilege was granted based on rural politics concessions while the company did not have sufficient financial security to operate the route.|$|E
25|$|After about 275 the {{relentless}} Roman expansion {{into the area}} occupied by La Tène culture began; <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> be complete, but lasted until the 1st century CE in Britain, leaving only the approximate areas of the modern Celtic nations (excluding Brittany) unoccupied.
