500|$|Writer Edgar Lee Masters, who {{witnessed}} Bryan's speech, remembered, [...] "Suddenly <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> spring {{up from his}} seat among the delegates and with the agility and swiftness of an eager boxer hurry to the speaker's rostrum. [...] He was slim, tall, pale, raven-haired, beaked of nose." [...] The Nebraska delegation waved red handkerchiefs as Bryan progressed to the podium; he wore an alpaca sack suit more typical of Lincoln and the West than of Chicago. [...] There was loud cheering as Bryan stood at the lectern; {{it took him a}} full minute to gain silence. [...] He began: ...|$|E

2500|$|On April 13, Lincoln invited Stanton, Grant {{and their}} wives to join him at Ford's Theatre the next evening. Lincoln had invited Stanton {{to go with him}} to the theatre several times, invitations Stanton {{routinely}} rejected. Further, neither of Stanton or Grant's wives would go unless the other went. The Grants used a visit to their children in New Jersey as their excuse. Finally, Lincoln decided to go to the theatre with Major Henry Rathbone and his betrothed. Stanton retired home that night after visiting a bedridden Secretary Seward. He went to bed at about 10 pm. Soon after, he heard Ellen yell from downstairs: [...] "Mr. Seward is murdered!" [...] Stanton rushed downstairs. Upon hearing that Lincoln, too, might be dead, Stanton grew intensely animated. He wanted to leave immediately. He was cautioned: [...] "You mustn't go out ... As I came up to the house <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> behind the tree-box, but he ran away, and I did not follow him." [...] Stanton paid little mind to the man; he found a taxi and went to Seward's home.|$|E

2500|$|Wong {{descended from}} the rooftop to the street, where he got {{into his car and}} drove quickly toward the ruined railway station. When he arrived, he noted carnage and confusion: [...] "It was a horrible sight. People were still trying to get up. Dead and injured lay strewn across the tracks and platform. Limbs lay all over the place. Only my work helped me forget what I was seeing. I stopped to reload my camera. I noticed that my shoes were soaked with blood. I walked across the railway tracks, and made many long scenes with the burning {{overhead}} bridge in the background. Then <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> pick up a baby from the tracks and carry him to the platform. He went back to get another badly injured child. The mother lay dead on the tracks. As I filmed this tragedy, I heard the sound of planes returning. Quickly, I shot my remaining few feet [...] on the baby. I ran toward the child, intending to carry him to safety, but the father returned. The bombers passed overhead. No bombs were dropped." ...|$|E
