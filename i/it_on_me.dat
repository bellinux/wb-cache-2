[...] "Rex" [...] Lewis / The Doctor / Cobra Commander [...] The Baroness's brother, {{a former}} soldier who {{was thought to}} have been killed during a mission led by Duke [...] instead, he became the {{disfigured}} head scientist of Military Armament Research Syndicate (MARS). USA Today reported that Gordon-Levitt would play multiple roles. He wore prosthetic makeup under a mask that was redesigned from the comics because the crew found it too reminiscent of the Ku Klux Klan. Upon seeing concept art of the character, Gordon-Levitt signed on because; [...] "I was like, 'I get to be that? You're going to make that [...] in real life and stick <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>me?</b> Cool. Let me do it.' That's a once-in-lifetime opportunity." [...] Gordon-Levitt is a friend of Tatum and they co-starred in Stop-Loss and Havoc. His casting provided extra incentive for Tatum to join the film. Gordon-Levitt described his vocal performance as being [...] "half reminiscent" [...] of Chris Latta's voice for the , but also half his own ideas, because he felt rendering it fully would sound ridiculous.|$|E
500|$|According to {{the sheet}} music {{published}} by Alfred Publishing on Musicnotes.com, [...] "Lacrymosa" [...] {{is an alternative}} metal, gothic rock and post-grunge song set in a common time and performed in slow tempo of 48 beats per minute. Although the original Lacrimosa sequence was performed in D-minor, it was transposed into E-minor by Lee and Terry Balsamo. The instrumentation in the song is provided by piano, guitar, violins and drums. Lee's vocal range from the low note of B3 to the high note of E5; the SATB choir vocals range from the low note of B2 to the high note of E4. According to Gauntlet writer Claire Colette, [...] "Lacrymosa" [...] has a [...] "violin intro, synth worth of a Nine Inch Nails album, and Omen-esque choral sections that are very haunting." [...] It then goes on with a pinon-themed melody before the [...] "power guitar section" [...] joins in. Lyrically, the song speaks about a break-up, as illustrated in the verse [...] "And you can blame <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>me</b> / Just set your guilt free, honey / I don't want to hold you back now love".|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, {{the female}} protagonists {{challenge}} their male [...] "suitors" [...] {{to keep up}} instead of being full of empty promises; the women further feel that [...] "He's not fulfilling you like he says". Williams further explained {{the meaning of the}} song during an interview with MTV News, [...] "We've had experiences with men doing a lot of talking but they can’t back it up. You said you could do this, but you can't, whether that's on the dance floor or wherever else. He said what he could do for you, but..." [...] The lyrics are constructed in the chorus-verse pattern. The song opens with the lines [...] "Hit me" [...] and the first verses sung by Beyoncé follow: [...] "I put it right there made it easy for you to get to / Now you want to act like you don't know what to do". The chorus follows during which the group repeatedly sings the lines [...] "Can you keep up?". Rowland's second verses follow where she sings the lines [...] "Put <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>me</b> deep in the right direction". The chorus is repeated twice before the bridge by Williams. After the bridge, the group sings the lines [...] "Here's your papers, baby you are dismissed" [...] letting their man know that he is not good enough for them. Rowland sings a short ad lib, and then the trio ends with a repeated chorus. Nick Reynolds from BBC compared the song Missy Elliott's [...] "Pass That Dutch" [...] and to songs by The Supremes. He further found a name check of Public Enemy's [...] "Bring the Noise". Eric Henderson of Slant Magazine also compared [...] "Lose My Breath with [...] "Pass That Dutch".|$|E

2500|$|Milton {{begins his}} work by {{mentioning}} {{that he was}} commissioned to write Eikonoklastes {{and that he did}} such {{for the good of the}} Commonwealth: [...] "I take <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>me</b> as a work assign'd rather, then by me cho'n or affected" [...] The central argument of Eikonoklastes involves the tyranny inherent in all monarchies, and Milton attacks the idea put forth by Charles I that the liberty of individuals consists [...] "in the enjoyment of the fruits of our industry, and the benefit of those Laws to which we our selves have consented". Milton's response is to point out how such a definition cannot actually separate different kinds of governments: ...|$|E
2500|$|At the Coroner's Inquest, {{the leak}} that Tony Harnischfeger had spotted was cited as {{evidence}} that the dam was leaking {{on the day of the}} break, and that both the Bureau of Water Works and Supply and Mulholland were aware of it. Mulholland told the jury he had been at the dam the day of the break, due to the dam keeper's call, but neither he nor Van Norman had observed anything of concern, nor found any dangerous conditions. Mulholland further testified that leaks in dams, especially of the type and size of the St. Francis, were common. During the Inquest Mulholland said, [...] "This inquest is a very painful thing for me to have to attend but it is the occasion of it that is painful. The only ones I envy about this thing are the ones who are dead." [...] In subsequent testimony, after answering a question he added, [...] "Whether it is good or bad, don't blame anyone else, you just fasten <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>me.</b> If there was an error in human judgment, I was the human, I won't try to fasten it on anyone else." ...|$|E
2500|$|A mid-tempo heartbreak song, {{the lyrics}} of [...] "The Root" [...] have the narrator lamenting a lost lover; [...] "In the name of love and hope she took my shield and sword ... From the pit of the bottom that knows no floor/Like the rain to the dirt, from the vine to the wine/From the alpha of creation, {{to the end of}} all time". The final two minutes of [...] "The Root" [...] feature an {{emphatic}} refrain of the chorus line. Reveille Magazine's Steve McPherson wrote that the chorus [...] "feeds back into itself over and over again, turning from a hook into a mantra into a gospel affirmation". In the promotional EPK for Voodoo, D'Angelo discussed the therapeutic nature of recording [...] "The Root", stating [...] "It was kinda therapeutic for me to do this song. It kinda help me get over, because I'm so pathetic in the song. You know what I mean? That's what 'The Root' is. She got <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>me.</b> And I'm just fucked up. It was good for me to get over that. It was hard for me sometimes to do that song. To record it, because when doing it I would have to put myself in that mode you know".|$|E
