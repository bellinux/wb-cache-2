5|$|Veronica {{receives}} a short call from Duncan {{just as the}} FBI agents track Duncan’s location. Veronica goes into an abandoned apartment, where she meets Duncan. It {{turns out that the}} set of events that seemed to point towards Duncan having stolen the baby were a scam so that Veronica and Duncan could successfully smuggle Duncan and the baby to Mexico together. Sheriff Lamb learns this fact just as Keith finds <b>diapers</b> in the apartment. A reporter contacts Wallace. Sheriff Lamb goes down to Mexico and asks around for Duncan Kane. Keith confronts Veronica about her actions regarding the baby, angry that she used him and tells her he'll never be able to fully trust her again. The FBI agents search Veronica’s apartment, but Keith has removed the <b>diapers</b> and continues to claim he doesn't know anything. Weevil learns that Felix was dating Molly Fitzpatrick. Sheriff Lamb continues his search before finding his trunk unloaded. Duncan, disguised as a hitchhiker, gets picked up by Vinnie Van Lowe and Astrid (Celeste’s assistant), and they drive off into the distance.|$|E
5|$|Throughout history, {{mothers have}} been portrayed {{as the primary}} {{physical}} caregivers of children. Physical caregiving includes tasks such as breast-feeding and changing <b>diapers.</b> Some theorize that {{this has to do}} with the idea of women as having a natural instinct towards motherhood. Fathers, on the other hand, have been more likely to be portrayed in play activities with their children and are often more likely to be shown interacting with sons than daughters.|$|E
50|$|The major {{efforts to}} {{alleviate}} <b>diaper</b> need {{come through the}} work of <b>diaper</b> banks and a growing <b>diaper</b> bank movement consisting of individuals and organizations that mobilize a network of community, state, and national level agencies and institutions to address the issue. According to the National <b>Diaper</b> Bank Network, {{a nonprofit organization that}} helps other nonprofit organizations start <b>diaper</b> banks in their communities and has tracked the organized response to <b>diaper</b> need since 2012, the number of <b>diaper</b> banks in the U.S. has increased five-fold in three years.|$|R

5|$|By 1931, {{more than}} 80percent of the {{services}} offered by industrial laundries were sold to individual families. However, as the Great Depression continued, many people {{could no longer afford}} the services, and business declined. The decline continued after World War II when electric washers and dryers meant for home use became affordable to {{a large percentage of the}} populace. As individual customers disappeared, factory laundries turned to specialized services such as washing <b>diapers</b> or linens. In 1950, the American Linen Supply Company bought the Yale Laundry Company. In 1959, Perfect Fit Manufacturing began to use the building to make auto seat covers, tire covers, and other automotive fabrics. Perfect Fit remained in the building through 2006.|$|E
5|$|Four Canadian Navy ships {{headed to}} the Gulf Coast of the United States, {{carrying}} relief supplies {{to help in the}} aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, were slowed down trying to avoid Hurricanes Nate and Ophelia. The convoy included a destroyer, two frigates, and an icebreaker, and developed a plan to travel between the two hurricanes to minimize damage to their cargo. Crews, anticipating potentially rough seas and gusty winds even with the averted course, secured onboard supplies such as generators, chainsaws, <b>diapers,</b> and cots. The genesis of Tropical Storm Nate continued the unprecedented levels of tropical activity during the 2005 hurricane season; when it developed on September5, it was the earliest in any season that the fourteenth named tropical cyclone formed, surpassing the previous record held by an unnamed storm during the 1936 season.|$|E
5|$|Routine {{home care}} {{is the most}} common level of care provided. In spite of its title, routine home care does not {{indicate}} a location of care, but a level (or intensity) of care provided. Routine care may be provided at a nursing home or assisted living facility, although the majority of hospice patients are treated at home. Interdisciplinary team members supply a variety of services during routine home care, including offering necessary supplies, such as durable medical equipment, medications related to the hospice diagnosis and incidentals like <b>diapers,</b> bed pads, gloves, and skin protectants. Twenty-four-hour on-call services must be available as needed. Typically this is provided after normal business hours by a registered nurse prepared to address urgent patient concerns.|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{different}} <b>diaper</b> care procedures on skin barrier function has been barely investigated in infants {{and should be}} evaluated using objective methods. In a monocentric, prospective trial 89 healthy infants aged 9 months (+/- 8 weeks) {{were randomly assigned to}} three <b>diaper</b> care regimens: group I used water-moistened washcloths at <b>diaper</b> change (n= 30), group II additionally applied <b>diaper</b> cream twice daily (n= 28), group III used wet wipes and <b>diaper</b> cream twice daily (n= 31). Transepidermal water loss (TEWL), skin hydration (SCH), skin-pH, interleukin- 1 α and microbiological colonization were measured in <b>diapered</b> skin (upper outer quadrant of the buttocks), nondiapered skin (upper leg) and if <b>diaper</b> dermatitis occurred in the most affected skin area at day 1, week 4 and 8. Skin condition was assessed by neonatal skin condition score and <b>diaper</b> rash grade. On <b>diapered</b> skin, SCH decreased in group II and III, whereas TEWL values were reduced in group II, only. Skin-pH increased in groups II and III. In general, SCH, skin-pH and interleukin- 1 α levels were higher in healthy <b>diapered</b> compared to nondiapered skin. The incidence and course of <b>diaper</b> dermatitis (DD) was comparable in all groups. Areas affected by DD showed increased TEWL and skin-pH compared to non-affected skin areas. Infants who received <b>diaper</b> cream showed reduced SCH and TEWL and increased pH levels in the <b>diapered</b> area in contrast to nondiapered skin. No correlation to the occurrence of DD could be found...|$|R

5|$|The Sprouses began acting {{at the age}} {{of eight}} months {{following}} a suggestion from their grandmother, Jonine Booth Wright, who was a drama teacher and actress. The twins first appeared in a commercial for <b>diapers,</b> switching on-screen time every few seconds. As with many twins, the two have often played the same role, due to child labor laws in California restricting the amount of time children can be filmed in a day. Casting twins in a single role thus allows more time for the character to be filmed. Beginning at eight months old, the two played a single character, Patrick Kelly, on the ABC series Grace Under Fire.|$|E
5|$|Amino acids {{are under}} {{development}} as {{components of a}} range of biodegradable polymers. These materials have applications as environmentally friendly packaging and in medicine in drug delivery and the construction of prosthetic implants. These polymers include polypeptides, polyamides, polyesters, polysulfides, and polyurethanes with amino acids either forming part of their main chains or bonded as side chains. These modifications alter the physical properties and reactivities of the polymers. An interesting example of such materials is polyaspartate, a water-soluble biodegradable polymer that may have applications in disposable <b>diapers</b> and agriculture. Due to its solubility and ability to chelate metal ions, polyaspartate is also being used as a biodegradeable anti-scaling agent and a corrosion inhibitor. In addition, the aromatic amino acid tyrosine is being developed as a possible replacement for toxic phenols such as bisphenol A in the manufacture of polycarbonates.|$|E

25|$|<b>Diapers</b> {{are made}} of cloth or {{synthetic}} disposable materials. Cloth <b>diapers</b> are composed of layers of fabric such as cotton, hemp, bamboo, microfiber, or even plastic fibers such as PLA, and can be washed and reused multiple times.

Manufacturers such as Discovery Trekking, Splash About and Theraquatics commonly utilize a stretch fabric to allow increased adjustability for a snug fit. They are washable and reusable. There are no disposable adult swim <b>diapers.</b>|$|E
25|$|Other common {{features}} of disposable <b>diapers</b> include {{one or more}} pairs of either adhesive or mechanical fastening tapes to keep the diaper securely fastened. Some <b>diapers</b> have tapes which are refastenable to allow adjusting of fit or reapplication after inspection. Elasticized fabric single and double gussets around the leg and waist areas aid in fitting and in containing urine or stool {{which has not been}} absorbed. Some <b>diapers</b> lines now commonly include wetness indicators, in which a chemical included in the fabric of the diaper changes color in the presence of moisture to alert the carer or user that the diaper is wet.|$|E
