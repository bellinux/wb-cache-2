40|$|Objective:  To {{test the}} plaque {{inhibitory}} effect of an experimental 0. 07 % cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC) mouthrinse in a 3 -day plaque accumulation model in a cross-over design. Material and Methods:  A total of 30 subjects (non-dental students), ≥ 18 years of age, {{were randomly assigned}} to use one of three different mouthrinses three times a day. After 3 days, the subjects returned for the clinical assessments and received a questionnaire to evaluate their attitude towards the product used by them. The cross-over procedure was repeated twice to have all subjects use all products. Results:  A total of 29 subjects completed the protocol and this resulted in a statistically significant difference between the three groups (P < 0. 001) with regard to plaque scores. Over three sessions, the mean plaque scores were 2. 17 for the control product, 1. 14 for the CPC group and 1. 12 for the 0. 1 % <b>Hexetidine</b> product (positive control). Results of the questionnaire show that, compared with <b>hexetidine,</b> the taste of the CPC was appreciated better, and less oral sensations were observed following rinsing.

40|$|The {{application}} of a simple intensity modulated fiber optic displacement sensor {{for the detection of}} stain formation on human teeth is demonstrated. The proposed sensor uses a concentric type bundled plastic optical fiber (POF) as a probe in conjunction with the surfaces of five human teeth as the reflecting targets. Prior to the experiment, the stains were produced extrinsically by soaking the teeth in different concentrations of oral antiseptic solution containing <b>hexetidine.</b> The concentration of the oral antiseptic solution is measured in volume. For a concentration change from 0 to 80, the peak voltage decreases exponentially from 1. 15 mV to 0. 41 mV with a measured resolution of 0. 48 and 1. 75 for concentration ranges of 0 - 40 and 40 - 80, respectively. The correlation between the detector output and variation in the color of human tooth surface has successfully been examined. Simple in design and low in cost, this sensor can detect color changes due to hexetidine-induced stain on a tooth surface in a fast and convenient way. Thus, this sensor will be very promising in esthetic dentistry, dental color matching techniques, chemical and biomedical applications. Â© 2012 Elsevier Ltd...|$|E
40|$|Background:  Unilateral or {{bilateral}} {{swelling of}} the parotid gland is a reported side effect of rinsing the mouth with chlorhexidine. Although the incidence rate is extremely low, {{there have been several}} case reports on this topic and the authors of these reports have suggested several explanations for the mechanism of this complication. Methods:  In this report, two cases of parotid gland swelling are discussed. Both patients developed unilateral parotid swelling following the use of a mouthwash, case 1 after using a chlorhexidine mouthwash following flap surgery and case 2 after using a <b>hexetidine</b> mouthwash in an approved clinical trial that was testing different mouthwashes. Results:  In both of the cases, differential diagnoses were made to explain the cause of the parotid swelling. However, discontinuing use of the product resulted in an eventual complete resolution of symptoms in both patients. Conclusions:  Swelling of the parotid gland following use of a mouthwash has previously been reported, although previous reports found this side effect only in patients who used chlorhexidine mouthwashes. This complication has therefore been informally linked to chlorhexidine. The present case report questions this hypothesis and suggests that parotid gland swelling may not be related to the type of mouthwash used, but may instead be a consequence of the rinsing action itself...|$|E

The study {{was carried out}} by enumerating the total colony counts of bristles-adhered microbes after three weeks of normal oral hygiene followed by rinsing the toothbrushes with CHX, HX, tap water and deionized water independently following a strict planned schedule. Rinsing toothbrush with tap water was included in the study as a control due to the normal way of cleaning toothbrush after use in every home. Whereas, sterilized deionized water do not contain any ions, minerals and is microbes-free. The total colony counts of microbes obtained from the toothbrush rinsed with tap water, deionized water, CHX and HX were 62. 6 × 106 CFU mL- 1, 74. 4 × 106 CFU mL- 1, 2. 4 × 106 CFU mL- 1 and 7. 6 × 106 CFU mL- 1, respectively. Staphylococcus aureus, Actinomyces naeslundii and Clostridium sp. were isolated from toothbrush rinsed with tap water. Staphylococcus aureus and Peptostreptococcus sp. were obtained from toothbrush rinsed with deionized water. Actinomyces sp. and Clostridium sp. were recovered from toothbrush rinsed with CHX and only Staphylococcus aureus was obtained from toothbrush rinsed with HX. Although toothbrush rinsed with mouth rinses containing antimicrobial agent such as CHX and HX still harbour microorganisms, but the microbial load has been very much lowered compared to the control toothbrush. Thus, this indicates that toothbrush rinsing with mouth rinse after the normal oral hygiene is very convenient and cost effective to reduce toothbrush contamination...|$|E
40|$|Oral Session - Scientific Groups: 20. Oral Communication Session 5 : {{abstract}} no. 125 OBJECTIVES: To {{study the}} prevalence of oral mucositis among paediatric and adolescent cancer patients receiving combination chemotherapy. METHODS: All cancer patients, aged 18 or under, within two weeks of receiving chemotherapy at the Children's Centre for Cancer and Blood Diseases, Queen Mary Hospital {{during the period from}} February through May 2011 were invited. Ethics approval (IRB UW 10 - 294) and parental consent were sought. Medical history was recorded and clinical examination was conducted by one examiner to study oral mucositis with WHO criteria. RESULTS: Forty one patients with mean age (±S. D) of 8. 7 ± 4. 9 participated in the study. Among them, 24 (59 %) had acute leukaemia, 12 (29 %) had solid tumours and 5 (12 %) with other haematological malignancies. Chemotherapeutic agents including antimetabolites, cytotoxic antibiotics, alkylating agents, and plant alkaloids were administered in 55 %, 33 %, 25 %, and 23 % of the patients, respectively. <b>Hexetidine</b> mouthwash was prescribed in patients receiving intensive chemotherapy (12 %). Ten patients (24 %) exhibited features of oral mucositis; among them, 40 %, 40 %, 10 %, 10 % presented with WHO grade 1, 2, 3, and 4 oral mucositis, respectively. Oral mucositis was found to be more common in patients with low white blood cell count (< 3. 5 x 109 /L) (p = 0. 007), being treated with cytotoxic antibiotics (p = 0. 006) and with alkylating agents (p = 0. 045). CONCLUSION: In contrary to adult experience, paediatric cancer patients had much lower prevalence of oral mucositis while they underwent chemotherapy. That {{may be due to the}} differences in the cancer types and treatment regimens used. We found that the manifestations of oral mucositis were associated with leucopenia, administration of cytotoxic antibiotics and alkylating agents. link_to_OA_fulltextThe 25 th IADR-SEA Division Annual Scientific Meeting, Singapore, 28 - 30 October 2011...|$|E
40|$|Background: Urethral {{stricture}} {{disease is}} prevalent, and many surgical techniques {{have been developed}} to treat it. Currently, urethroplasty for bulbar strictures implies ventral or dorsal stricturotomy and a buccal mucosa graft (BMG) patch. Objective: To describe the surgical approach of the ventral patch BMG urethroplasty for proximal bulbar urethral stricture and to analyze 11 consecutive cases for whom the technique was used. Patients and Methods: The diagnosis of urethral stricture was confirmed with a combined retrograde urethrography and micturating cystourethrography. A single team exposed the urethra, harvested, and planted the BMG in the lithotomy position under general anesthesia. The oral preoperative preparation was done with oraldene (<b>hexetidine)</b> mouth wash three times daily beginning from the 2 nd preoperative day. The buccal mucosa was harvested from the left inner cheek in all the patients. The donor site was left unclosed but packed with wet gauze. Data related to age, preoperative adverse conditions, stricture length, urine culture result, perineal/oral wound complications, postoperative residual urine volume, and duration of hospital stay were recorded. Results: Eleven patients with proximal bulbar urethral stricture had BMG urethroplasty from August 2013 to October 2015. Stricture length ranged from 2 to 5 cm. In six (54 %) of the men, the stricture resulted from urethritis thereby constituting the most common etiology of urethral stricture in this study. The preoperative adverse conditions were age above 70 in three, diabetes mellitus in two, severe dental caries in one, and recurrent stricture in two. All of them were able to resume reasonable oral intake 72 h postoperatively. One (9. 2 %) had perineal wound infection, while two (18. 2 %) still had mild pain at donor site 4 weeks postoperatively. Ten (90. 9 %) of the 11 patients had < 30 ml residual urine volume at 2 months of follow-up. Conclusion: Urethritis is still a common cause of urethral stricture in this rural community. Ventral onlay buccal mucosal graft urethroplasty for proximal bulbar urethral stricture is safe, even in certain adverse preoperative conditions. Buccal mucosa from the cheek is however now preferred...|$|E
40|$|The {{oral cavity}} is a habitat with ideal {{conditions}} for colonization {{by a variety}} of microor-ganisms, whose organization in plaque layers on dental surfaces shows a typical example of a bacterial biofilm [Marsh & Bradshaw, 1995]. Due to constantly changing environmental conditions and external influences such as unhealthy diet, disease, immunological dysfunction and poor oral hygiene, the prevailing balance in the dental plaque is disturbed, which can lead to pathological plaque formation processes [Marsh, 1999]. This causes the dental plaque as a biofilm to obtain a pathogenetic relevance. It is therefore of fundamental importance to prevent or at least reduce the maturation and undisturbed plaque growth. In dentistry, antimicrobial substances such as mouthwashes have successfully been used for many years for the prevention and treatment of dental caries and periodontal diseases and therefore represent a valuable supplement to manual therapy measures [Barnett, 2003; Gottenbos et al., 1999; Pitten et al., 2003; Shapiro et al., 2002]. In addi-tion, antimicrobial agents as accompanying measures to the oral and dental care can contribute significantly to fight pathological plaque formation processes and to improve the oral hygiene [Marsh, 1999; Pitten et al., 2003; Shapiro et al., 2002]. Both the treat-ment and the prevention of periodontal diseases are primarily focused on dental plaque as a biofilm. To provide clinically relevant results it is necessary to develop multispecies biofilm models in vitro. These facilitate the examination of antimicrobial substances [Shen et al., 2009; Wilson, 1996]. Many studies have shown that bacteria in a biofilm formation are less sensitive towards antiseptics than monospecies cultures or those in suspension (planktonic bacteria) [Bradshaw & Marsh, 1999; Costerton et al., 1999; Donlan & Costerton, 2002; Marsh & Bradshaw, 1995; Pitten et al., 2003; Romero et al., 2008]. Therefore, the character of the dental plaque biofilm as a multispecies biofilm plays a major role on the effect of antimicrobial substances on the bacterial microflora [Sissons et al., 1996; Wilson et al., 1996]. Only with a multispecies culture conclusions can be drawn on the in vivo situation, since it comes closest to nature [Pratten et al., 1998 a]. The model developed in the present study allows the investigation of oral, in vitro grown multispecies biofilms and their reduction after application of various commercially available mouthwashes. The test substances are Chlorhexamed Forte® 0. 2 % (chlorhexidine), Listerine® (phenol derivative) Hexoral® (<b>hexetidine)</b> and Meridol® (stannous fluoride). The multispecies biofilms cultured on special Thermanox® coverslips were subse-quently documented with electron microscopical methods. An advantage of this method is the systematic comparison of accumulated bacteria on the biofilm carriers, which is essential when considering the individual effect of the test substances. The evaluation of the biofilms on their biofilm carriers led to a very heterogeneous pic-ture, with regard to both the composition and the relative abundance of the bacteria. Even though the morphotypes of the different multispecies biofilms of one and the same subject coincided to a large extent, their proportional shares varied considerably due to the effect of the test substances. Furthermore, a change in the phenotypic characteristics of the biofilm appeared {{as a result of the}} mouthwashes used. While Chlorhexamed Forte®, Meridol® and Hexoral® cause a selective elimination of individual morphotypes and therefore a change in composition of the bacterial community, the number of bacteria is reduced relatively even when using Listerine®. In all, only a few generally valid correlations could be ascertained between the undoubtedly existing effect of antimicrobial substances on the total bacteria amount and the composition of the microbial community. The patients' biofilms treated with mouthwash showed a much lower total bacteria count than the control biofilms, whereby the achieved reduction of the bacterial amount is clearest in the majority of those test biofilms having used Chlorhexamed Forte® 0. 2 %. The results of this study in which antimicrobial mouth rinses were tested against multispecies biofilms of different test persons, show the different effects of these substances in vitro. Further studies should address the question whether the different effects of mouthwashes can also be confirmed on multispecies biofilms in vivo...|$|E
