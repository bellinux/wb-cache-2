5|$|HIV <b>is</b> <b>transmitted</b> {{by three}} main routes: sexual contact, {{significant}} exposure to infected body fluids or tissues, and from mother to child during pregnancy, delivery, or breastfeeding (known as vertical transmission). There is no risk of acquiring HIV if exposed to feces, nasal secretions, saliva, sputum, sweat, tears, urine, or vomit unless these are contaminated with blood. It {{is possible to}} be co-infected {{by more than one}} strain of HIV—a condition known as HIV superinfection.|$|E

Treatment focuses on reducing bleeding from blood vessel lesions, and sometimes surgery or other targeted interventions to remove arteriovenous malformations in organs.

5|$|Many {{different}} mammalian {{species can}} be affected by prion diseases, as the prion protein (PrP) is very similar in all mammals. Due to small differences in PrP between different species it is unusual for a prion disease to transmit from one species to another.

5|$|A few sheep {{conditions}} are transmissible to humans.

Cutaneous anthrax is also called woolsorter's disease, as the spores {{can be transmitted}} in unwashed wool. More seriously, the organisms that can cause spontaneous enzootic abortion in sheep are easily transmitted to pregnant women. Also of concern are the prion disease scrapie and {{the virus that causes}} foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), as both can devastate flocks. The latter poses a slight risk to humans. During the 2001 FMD pandemic in the UK, hundreds of sheep were culled and some rare British breeds were at risk of extinction due to this.|$|E

Lesbians are not included in a category of frequency of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission, although transmission is possible through vaginal and cervical secretions. The highest rate of transmission of HIV to lesbians is among women who participate in intravenous drug use or have sexual intercourse with bisexual men.|$|E
5|$|Britain's Sir Ronald Ross, an army surgeon {{working in}} Secunderabad India, proved in 1897 that malaria <b>is</b> <b>transmitted</b> by mosquitoes, an event now commemorated via World Mosquito Day. He {{was able to}} find {{pigmented}} malaria parasites in a mosquito that he artificially fed on a malaria patient who had crescents in his blood. He continued his research into malaria by showing that certain mosquito species (Culex fatigans) transmit malaria to sparrows and he isolated malaria parasites from the salivary glands of mosquitoes that had fed on infected birds. He reported this to the British Medical Association in Edinburgh in 1898.|$|E

5|$|Like most arboviruses, dengue {{virus is}} {{maintained}} in nature in cycles that involve preferred blood-sucking vectors and vertebrate hosts. The viruses are maintained {{in the forests}} of Southeast Asia and Africa by transmission from female Aedes mosquitoes—of species other than A. aegypti—to their offspring and to lower primates. In towns and cities, the virus is primarily transmitted by the highly domesticated A. aegypti. In rural settings the virus <b>is</b> <b>transmitted</b> to humans by A. aegypti and other species of Aedes such as A. albopictus. Both these species had expanding ranges {{in the second half}} of the 20th century. In all settings the infected lower primates or humans greatly increase the number of circulating dengue viruses, in a process called amplification.|$|E
