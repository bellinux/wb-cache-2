500|$|Kennedy then restlessly {{wandered around}} the hotel, {{checking}} {{in on his}} staff. When asked if King's murder had {{reminded him of the}} 1963 assassination of John F. Kennedy, his brother, Kennedy replied, [...] "Well, that. But it makes me wonder what they might do to me too." [...] He told speechwriter Jeff Greenfield, [...] "You know, the death of Martin Luther King isn't the worse thing that ever happened in the world." [...] Greenfield later said, [...] "I could not {{for the life of me}} understand that callousness until, of course, <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>he</b> had been thinking of the death of his brother." ...|$|E
500|$|Boudreau {{discussed}} the potential move to pitcher with Yankees catcher Bill Dickey, {{who had also}} played in the Navy with Lemon. [...] "I knew Lemon had a strong arm, and once <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>he</b> {{was not going to}} hit with consistency as an outfielder, I thought it would be worthwhile to look at him as a pitcher", Boudreau later wrote. Lemon resisted the idea at first, but he agreed to the change after he learned that his salary could be higher as a pitcher. Lemon credited Indians coach Bill McKechnie with helping him to adjust to his new position. Indians pitching coach Mel Harder taught Lemon how to throw a slider, a key pitch in his repertoire. That same year, Indians owner Bill Veeck said that Lemon [...] "some day will become the best pitcher in the American League." [...] Lemon finished the 1946 season with a losing record (4–5), the only one he would have until 1957, and a career-low 2.49ERA. He followed up his inaugural season as a pitcher with an 11–5 record. He appeared in 19 games before August, largely as a relief pitcher, but he made his first start in July against the Boston Red Sox. During the last two months of the season, Lemon went 9–3 and pitched six complete games, including two 11-inning outings.|$|E
2500|$|A bizarre moment {{occurred}} in round 8, whilst in a headlock, Maidana {{appeared to have}} bitten Mayweather's left hand. Mayweather explained this in the post fight, [...] "I didn't know what it was. Something happened and then my fingers were numb. After the eighth round my fingers were numb. I could only use my other hand. He bit me. <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>he</b> bit me. We were tangled {{in the middle of}} the ring and all of a sudden I felt something on my left hand." [...] Maidana denied the bite, [...] "Maybe he thinks I'm a dog, but I never bit him. He was rubbing my eyes that round. He may have had his glove in my mouth, but I never bit him." [...] After round 9, Maidana appeared to be confused as he started walking towards the wrong corner. Mayweather immediately ran towards him to point to his corner, much to the amusement of the crowd. Maidana was unhappy with the final verdict and thought he won the fight, [...] "If the judges want to give the fight to fighters that run, they can give it to him. I was attacking all the time. Maybe I'm wrong, but I thought that I was the aggressor. I kept my plan to be aggressive but he kept holding and pushing. I don't want to waste my time with a third fight. I trained with all my heart to get this type of result. This is not fair. There's not reason for another fight." [...] For the sequel, Mayweather earned a minimum of $32 million and Maidana earned a career high $3 million.|$|E

6000|$|What {{an unjust}} tirade! He barked {{it all out}} {{at me as if}} the blame were mine; as if I had nibbled the Apple. I turned my face away, smiling, but listening. Did <b>I</b> <b>realize,</b> <b>he</b> asked me, what a divine fortune it was to be so little, and in this to be All. On and on he raved: I breathed air [...] "a dewdrop could chill"; I was as near lovely naught made visible as the passing of a flower; the mere mattering of a dream. And when I died my body would be but a {{perishing}} flake of manna, and my bones....|$|R

60|$|When {{we had had}} {{coffee and}} were going out, I found our own {{conductor}} in a little chair by the fire. He was looking a bit pathetic. I had enough sense {{to give him a}} coffee, which brightened him. But it was not till afterwards, putting things together, that <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>he</b> had wanted to be with us all at table, but that his conductor's wages probably did not allow him to spend the money. My bill for the dinner was about fifteen francs, for the two of us.|$|E

2500|$|In {{his next}} start on April 16, Holy Bull was the odds on {{favorite}} in the Blue Grass Stakes. He went to the early lead and set a moderate pace, then responded to a brief challenge by pulling away under a hand ride. The win earned Holy Bull a Beyer of 113. After the race, Smith was confident in the colt's ability to go an extra furlong in the upcoming Kentucky Derby. [...] "He would have gone around again today," [...] he said. [...] "I think he'll {{go as far as}} you want him. I'm not going to say no one can ever beat him, but when he runs his race, they've got to have their running shoes on.

5000|$|Film {{director}} Billy Wilder and {{his longtime}} co-writer I. A. L.

About two days before we were to start, he had a heart attack and died. Iz and I were shattered." ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>realized</b> that <b>he</b> had one and {{the same}} line of talk that he always used. I resented it. No wonder it was easy for him. [...] "Great mistake," [...] said Poppleton.

5000|$|Drake stated: ...I’ve {{become more}} and more {{convinced}} that Stan Lee knowingly stole The X-Men from The Doom Patrol. Over the years I learned that an awful lot of writers and artists were working surreptitiously between and DC. Therefore from when I first brought the idea into editor Murray Boltinoff’s office, it would’ve been easy for someone to walk over and hear that was working on a story about a bunch of reluctant superheroes who are led by a man in a wheelchair. So over the years I began to feel that Stan had more lead time than <b>I</b> <b>realized.</b> <b>He</b> may well have had four, five or even six months.|$|E
5000|$|The suit {{has been}} {{continuously}} {{linked to the}} manner of his death.

It wasn't until years later looking back that <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>he</b> wanted me to design the suit the way he would want to die. From the pills, the woman, the cross, the poppies to the flames on the pants and of course in the end his body went up in flames in Joshua Tree with our friend Phil Kaufman." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh, nothing. Only, {{all at once}} <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> that <b>he</b> had a {{sensitive}} nature. I don't know why <b>I</b> shouldn't have <b>realized</b> it before. <b>I</b> had somehow taken {{it for granted that}} he was a self-conscious hermit, who lived in a squalid seclusion because he liked being wondered at. But he {{did not seem to be}} anything of the kind. I don't know whether he's a good cook, for he didn't ask me to eat anything; but I don't think he's a bad housekeeper." ...|$|R
60|$|Silently {{we entered}} {{the gate of the}} burial ground, and slowly {{approached}} the mound under which my mother's body rested, and as I studied the thin form and bending head of my intrepid sire, <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> that <b>he</b> was in very truth treading the edge of his own grave. My eyes grew dim with tears and my throat ached with a sense of impending loss, and a pity for him which I could conceal only by looking away at the hills.|$|R
5000|$|... "I locked {{myself in}} my home and I just started writing.

The more we started {{listening}} to it the studio the more my producer started going, 'Dude, you know, you can just call this what it is.' I was like, 'What are you talking about?' And he goes, 'Why don't you just call this Tommy Lee?' After thinking about it for a while, <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>he</b> was right. That's when I made that decision, to just go under my own name rather than a 'band' name." ...|$|E
5000|$|Once <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>he</b> (Ernest Hemingway) doesn't {{have much}} of a sense of humor, at least he doesn't show it in his books then I had to find someone else. And there was a writer by the name of Richard Bissell and Bissell wrote 7½ Cents which became The Pajama Game and wrote books set on the Mississippi river where he was a pilot, a towboat pilot I don't know for how long. Then he wrote about five books and he had such a natural style. There was humor on his towboat guys' talk, but it was never forced. He wasn't trying to be funny. That was the main point. I thought that's the way to do it. That's the way.|$|E
5000|$|I {{had tried}} to cast Lance Henriksen on The X-Files several times, {{he had always been}} either {{unavailable}} or uninterested. Anyway I remained a fan of his, I was in bed working in Vancouver and <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>he</b> was working there too. So I found out where he was staying and wrote a personal note, had a fan slip it under his door, and said that I'd tried to get him on the show and hoped to work with him in the future. Little did he know when I was then writing Millennium I was writing with only him in mind, with no idea whether or not he'd actually do the project. So I wrote the project, approached him, he was very excited about it, we made a deal and the rest is now history.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the words}} of Madhusudan Kela at his {{experience}} in SIMSR,"We had a professor called Dr. R L Bhatia who taught us HR.

60|$|The Ghost {{suddenly}} {{changed her}} course, keeping away, {{and it came}} to me with a shock that Wolf Larsen was giving up the rescue as impossible. Then <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> that <b>he</b> was preparing to heave to, and dropped to the deck to be in readiness. We were now dead before the wind, the boat far away and abreast of us. I felt an abrupt easing of the schooner, a loss for the moment of all strain and pressure, coupled with a swift acceleration of speed. She was rushing around on her heel into the wind.|$|R
5000|$|The most {{precious}} collaborator I have ever had, I say it straightaway and don't {{even have to}} hesitate, was Nino Rota — between us, immediately, a complete, total, harmony ... He had a geometric imagination, a musical approach worthy of celestial spheres. He thus {{had no need to}} see images from my movies. When I asked him about the melodies he had in mind to comment one sequence or another, <b>I</b> clearly <b>realized</b> <b>he</b> was not concerned with images at all. His world was inner, inside himself, and reality had no way to enter it.|$|R
