5|$|Carson and Zobel in 1923 had {{conclusively}} {{shown that}} filtering cannot remove noise {{to the same}} degree as, say, interference from another station could be removed. To do this they had analyzed random noise in the frequency domain and postulated that it contains all frequencies in its spectrum. This was the first use of Fourier analysis to describe random noise and hence described it in terms of a spread of frequencies. Also first published in this paper was the concept of what we would now call band-limited white noise. For Zobel this meant that characteristics of the receiving filter completely determine the <b>figure</b> <b>of</b> <b>merit</b> in the presence of white noise and that the filter design was key to achieving the optimum noise performance.|$|E
5|$|The {{levelized cost}} of {{electricity}} (LCoE) can be calculated by dividing the total cost to build and operate a power-generating system over its lifetime by {{the total amount of}} electricity shipped to the grid during that period. The amount of money is essentially a combination of the capital expense (CAPEX) of the plant and the interest payments on that CAPEX, and the discounted cost of the fuel, the maintenance needed to keep it running and its dismantling, the discounted operational expenses, or OPEX. The amount of power is normally calculated by considering the peak power the plant could produce, and then adjusting that by the capacity factor (CF) to account for downtime due to maintenance or deliberate throttling. As a quick calculation, one can ignore inflation, opportunity costs and minor operational expenses to develop a <b>figure</b> <b>of</b> <b>merit</b> for the {{cost of electricity}}.|$|E

25|$|Two flaws {{emerged in}} Maines protection, both due to {{technological}} developments between her laying-down and her completion. The {{first was a}} lack of adequate topside armor to counter the effects of rapid-fire intermediate-caliber guns and high-explosive shells. This was a flaw she shared with Texas. The second was the use of nickel-steel armor. Introduced in 1889, nickel steel was the first modern steel alloy armor and, with a <b>figure</b> <b>of</b> <b>merit</b> of 0.67, was an improvement over the 0.6 rating of mild steel used until then. Harvey steel and Krupp armors, both of which appeared in 1893, had merit figures of between 0.9 and 1.2, giving them roughly twice the tensile strength of nickel steel. Although all three armors shared the same density (about 40 pounds per square foot for a one-inch-thick plate), six inches of Krupp or Harvey steel gave the same protection as 10inches of nickel. The weight thus saved could be applied either to additional hull structure and machinery or to achieving higher speed. The navy would incorporate Harvey armor in the s, designed after Maine, but commissioned at roughly the same time.|$|E

40|$|Lunar {{regolith}} simulants {{are essential}} to the development of technology for human exploration of the Moon. Any equipment that will interact with the surface environment must be tested with simulant to mitigate risk. To reduce the greatest amount of risk, the simulant must replicate the lunar surface as well as possible. To quantify the similarities and differences between simulants, the <b>Figures</b> <b>of</b> <b>Merit</b> were developed. The <b>Figures</b> <b>of</b> <b>Merit</b> software compares the simulants and regolith by particle size, particle shape, density, and bulk chemistry and mineralogy; these four properties dictate the majority of the remaining characteristics of a geologic material. There are limitations to both the current <b>Figures</b> <b>of</b> <b>Merit</b> approach and simulants in general. The effect of particle textures is lacking in the <b>Figures</b> <b>of</b> <b>Merit</b> software, and research into this topic has only recently begun with applications to simulants. In addition, not all of the properties for lunar regolith are defined sufficiently for simulant reproduction or comparison; for example, the size distribution of particles greater than 1 centimeter and the makeup of particles less than 10 micrometers is not well known. For simulants, contamination by terrestrial weathering products or undesired trace phases in feedstock material is a major issue. Vapor deposited rims have not yet been created for simulants. Fortunately, previous limitations such as the lack of agglutinates in simulants have been addressed and commercial companies are now making agglutinate material for simulants. Despite some limitations, the <b>Figures</b> <b>of</b> <b>Merit</b> sufficiently quantify the comparison between simulants and regolith for useful application in lunar surface technology.
