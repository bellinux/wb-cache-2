5|$|Whippets course, work, and race; {{they have}} been bred for these jobs for years. This has kept them a {{structurally}} sound breed which is predominantly free <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>physical</b> exaggerations {{that can lead to}} certain health problems. Whippets are, like other sighthounds, intolerant of barbiturate anaesthetics. This is in part due to their low concentration of body fat and their liver's inability to metabolise the anaesthetics.|$|E

The latter release, for Blu-ray and DVD, included behind-the-scenes featurettes, deleted scenes, a blooper reel, and audio commentaries by Tim Miller and Deadpool co-creator Rob Liefeld, and Reynolds, Reese, and Wernick. On November 7, Fox re-released {{the film and}} its special features on Blu-ray for the holiday season, as Deadpool's Holiday Blu-ray package.|$|E

5|$|Many crash {{survivors}} suffered long recoveries <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>physical</b> {{and psychological}} traumas they endured. A {{month after the}} crash, an orderly caravan of around 1,000 vehicles drove to JFK while some demonstrators laid wreaths in the international terminal lobby to protest {{the handling of the}} flight. Some survivors sued the FAA, accusing the agency of failing to ensure the flight's safety. In July 1990, Avianca offered $75,000 to crash survivors and the relatives of those killed. The U.S. government eventually joined Avianca and reached a settlement estimated at over $200million in damages to the victims.|$|E
5|$|The lack {{of flight}} {{recorder}} {{data for the}} last six minutes of the flight added significant complexity to the investigation and was a major factor in its lengthy duration. The Transportation Safety Board team had to reconstruct the last six minutes of flight entirely <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>physical</b> evidence. As the aircraft was broken into 2 million pieces by the impact, this process was time-consuming and tedious. The investigation became the largest and most expensive transport accident investigation in Canadian history, costing C$57 million (US$48.5 million) over five years.|$|E
5|$|The {{principal}} motivation {{or driving}} force behind the re-establishment of religious houses in the kingdom of the English, living in strict accordance with the Rule of Saint Benedict, was a desire to restore to their former glory some of the ancient houses known from the pages of Bede's Ecclesiastical History of the English People, from other literary works, from historical traditions of the later eighth and ninth centuries, or indeed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>physical</b> remains of buildings... Modern historians will recognise how much was owed to the monastic reform movements on the continent, and will find extra dimensions, such as a wish to extend royal influence into areas where a king of the West Saxons might not expect his writ to run, or a more general wish to revive a sense of 'Englishness', through raising awareness of the tradition of the past.|$|E

25|$|Physical fitness {{received}} {{a boost in}} the 19th century <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>physical</b> culture campaign of Max Nordau. The Maccabiah Games, an Olympic-style event for Jewish athletes, was inaugurated in the 1930s, and has been held in Israel every four years since then.|$|E
25|$|His {{mechanistic}} {{approach was}} extended {{to the issue of}} animal consciousness. Mind, for Descartes, was a thing apart <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>physical</b> universe, a separate substance, linking human beings to the mind of God. The nonhuman, on the other hand, were for Descartes nothing but complex automata, with no souls, minds, or reason.|$|E

25|$|Buprenorphine {{treatment}} {{carries the}} risk of causing psychological or physical dependence. Buprenorphine has a slow onset, has a mild effect, and is very long acting with a half-life of 24 to 60 hours. Once a patient has stabilized on the drug, there are two treatment options: continual use/maintenance, or medically supervised withdrawal <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>physical</b> dependence to the drug.|$|E

25|$|Georgescu {{argues that}} the {{relevance}} of thermodynamics to economics stems <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>physical</b> fact that man can neither create nor destroy matter or energy, only transform it. The usual economic terms of 'production' and 'consumption' are mere verbal conventions that tend to obscure that nothing is created and nothing is destroyed in the economic process — everything is being transformed.|$|E

25|$|The {{ethernet}} is {{a family}} of frame-based computer networking technologies for local area networks (LANs). The name comes <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>physical</b> concept of the ether. It defines a number of wiring and signaling standards for the Physical Layer of the OSI networking model, through means of network access at the Media Access Control (MAC)/Data Link Layer, and a common addressing format. Robert Metcalfe, while at Xerox invented the ethernet in 1975.|$|E

By 1928 it produced Almacoa excavators, tractors and forklifts, plus Cletrac crawler tractors were exclusive to Clement-Bayard for Europe and North Africa.|$|E
25|$|Thomas Breuer in 1994 {{had proven}} that {{physical}} theories valid {{for the whole}} universe are impossible. Any theory will be wrong when applied to a system which contains the observer himself due to self-reference. This proves that the observer's own body does not follow the same physical laws {{as the rest of}} the universe. But other people from the observer's point of view will obey the usual physical laws, so conducting experiments on them would not indicate any divergence <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>physical</b> predictions.|$|E

25|$|The book {{includes}} long {{extracts from}} {{the works of}} Jacques Lacan, Julia Kristeva, Paul Virilio, Gilles Deleuze, Félix Guattari, Luce Irigaray, Bruno Latour, and Jean Baudrillard who, {{in terms of the}} quantity of published works, invited presentations, and citations received, are some of the leading academics of Continental philosophy, critical theory, psychoanalysis or social sciences. Sokal and Bricmont set out to show how those intellectuals have used concepts <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>physical</b> sciences and mathematics incorrectly. The extracts are intentionally rather long to avoid accusations of taking sentences out of context.|$|E
25|$|Jonathan Miller twice {{directed}} Michael Hordern in {{the title}} role for English television, the first for the BBC's Play of the Month in 1975 and the second for the BBC Television Shakespeare in 1982. Horden received mixed reviews, and was considered a bold choice due to his history of taking much lighter roles. Also for English television, Laurence Olivier took the role in a 1983 TV production for Granada Television. It was his last screen appearance in a Shakespearean role, its pathos deriving in part <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>physical</b> frailty of Olivier the actor.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the {{electrical}} telegraph, ancient civilizations, such as Greece, Egypt, and China, transmitted long-distance information using drumbeats, flame beacons, or light flashes with a heliograph. Later, nearly all information {{was limited to}} traveling {{at the speed of}} a human or animal. The telegraph freed communication from the time constraints of postage and revolutionized the global economy and society. By the end of the 19th century, the telegraph was becoming an increasingly common medium of communication for ordinary people. The telegraph isolated the message (information) <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>physical</b> movement of objects or the process.|$|E
