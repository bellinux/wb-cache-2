50|$|Between 1842 and 1870 a {{total of}} 525,482 Indians emigrated to the British and French Colonies.

40|$|Kratzer (1991) {{discusses}} syntactic {{restrictions on}} the construction of focus alternatives in the sense of Rooth 1992. She presents an example with a focus in the antecedent of a deleted VP. (d 0) Peter: What a copy cat you are! You <b>went</b> <b>to</b> Block Island because I did. You <b>went</b> <b>to</b> Elk Lake Lodge because I did. And you <b>went</b> <b>to</b> Tanglewood because I did. Jane: I only <b>went</b> <b>to</b> TANGLEWOOD because you did. By reconstructing the deleted VP, Jane´s objection becomes I only <b>went</b> <b>to</b> TANGLEWOOD because you <b>went</b> <b>to</b> TANGLEWOOD. For this sentence standard alternative semantics al-lows for the construction of an alternative set A 0 which comprises predicates like <b>went</b> <b>to</b> Block Island because Peter <b>went</b> <b>to</b> Block Island and <b>went</b> <b>to</b> Block Island because Peter <b>went</b> <b>to</b> Tanglewood, i. e. predicates of the form <b>went</b> <b>to</b> x because Peter <b>went</b> <b>to</b> y. Jane´s objection therefore excludes that she <b>went</b> <b>to</b> Tanglewood because Peter <b>went</b> <b>to</b> Block Island. Kratzer claims that this is not intended. The alternative set (A 1) may only comprise predi-cates of the form <b>went</b> <b>to</b> x because Peter <b>went</b> <b>to</b> x. This restriction is due to syntactic, and not contextual reasons. In constructing an alternative set the focus in a formerly deleted VP must always be replaced by the same value as the corresponding focus in the antecedent VP. Kratzer´s view is widely accepted. We did an experiment to test whether listeners always interpret utterances like Jane´s ac-cording to Kratzer´s hypothesis. We integrated a German analogue of Jane´s objection into two different German dialogues (d 1,d 2). As there is no VP-deletion in German, the German and English examples differ in their anaphoric means. The English example employs VP-deletion, the German ones pronominal anaphora. We placed the dialogues into a context where Peter <b>went</b> <b>to</b> Berlin (resp. Tanglewood), which inspired Jane, who then <b>went</b> <b>to</b> Dort-mund (Block Island), Kiel (Elk Lake Lodge) and Berlin. After she came back, Peter went t...|$|R
