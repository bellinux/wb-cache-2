5|$|In 1319, the King and Lancaster {{fell out}} during a failed {{campaign}} against Scotland. The next year Lancaster refused {{to attend a}} parliament summoned by the King, and later the same year, Edward obtained papal absolution from his oath to follow the Ordinances. Meanwhile, an inheritance dispute had broken out in the Welsh Marches between the Despensers and certain marcher lords, including Humphrey de Bohun, Earl of Hereford. Lancaster now took the initiative with the discontented. In 1321 <b>he</b> <b>summoned</b> two meetings of magnates, one at Lancaster's residence of Pontefract in March, and the other at Sherburn in June. The meetings consisted of northern and marcher lords, as well as Lancaster's own retainers, but little assistance was forthcoming from the northerners. The marcher rebellion, {{and the threat of}} civil war, forced the King to exile the younger Despenser, but the favourite was recalled within weeks.|$|E
5|$|In response, {{and hoping}} to win wider support for his government, Montfort summoned a new {{parliament}} for 20 January 1265 which continued until mid March that year. It was held at short notice, with the summons being issued on 14 December, leaving little time for attendees to respond. <b>He</b> <b>summoned</b> not only the barons, senior churchmen and two knights from each county, but also two burgesses {{from each of the}} major towns such as York, Lincoln, Sandwich, and the Cinque Ports, the first time this had been done. Due to the lack of support for Montfort among the barons, only 23 of them were summoned to parliament, in comparison to the summons issued to 120 churchmen, who largely supported the new government; it is unknown how many burgesses were called. The event was overseen by King Henry, and held in the Palace of Westminster, London, which was the largest city in England, and whose continuing loyalty was essential to Montfort's cause.|$|E

Three regional Church councils and another trial before Constantine all ruled against Donatus and the Donatism movement in North Africa.

5|$|On April 3, the Spanish {{approached}} the chiefdom of Altamaha, {{led by a}} chief named Zamuno, who always bore arms in case of attack by Cofitachequi. It is unclear if De Soto entered the main town at the Shinholser site. Zamuno exchanged gifts with De Soto {{and asked if he}} should pay tribute directly to him, instead of to his overlord Ocute. De Soto replied that the previous relationship should stand. De Soto erected a cross and left behind a cannon somewhere in the chiefdom. <b>He</b> <b>summoned</b> the paramount chief of Ocute, and then visited his main town, apparently at the Shoulderbone site, on April 9. He received gifts and set up another cross, and the army rested for two days. On April 12, De Soto visited another subject chiefdom, Cofaqui, which was governed by a young noble named Patofa on behalf of his elderly uncle. Patofa reiterated his compatriots' policy of amity and gave the army provisions and porters.|$|E
5|$|Simon de Montfort {{had seized}} power in England {{following}} his victory over Henry III at the Battle of Lewes during the Second Barons' War, but {{his grip on}} the country was under threat. In an attempt to gather more support <b>he</b> <b>summoned</b> representatives from not only the barons and the knights of the shires, as had occurred in previous parliaments, but also burgesses from the major towns. The resulting parliament in London discussed radical reforms and temporarily stabilised Montfort's political situation. Montfort was killed at the Battle of Evesham later that year, but the idea of inviting both knights and burgesses to parliaments became more popular under the reign of Henry's son Edward I. By the 14th century this had become the norm, with the gathering becoming known as the House of Commons. This parliament is sometimes referred to as the first English parliament and Montfort himself is often termed the founder of the Commons.|$|E

5|$|When King Henry II died in 1189, his son Richard I, who {{had spent}} most of his life in France, arrived in Portsmouth before he was crowned in London. When Richard {{returned}} from captivity in Austria in May 1194, <b>he</b> <b>summoned</b> a fleet of 100 ships and an army to the port. He granted the town a Royal charter, giving permission for an annual fifteen-day free market fair, weekly markets, and a local court to deal with minor matters, and exempted its inhabitants from paying an annual tax of £18. Richard granted the town the arms of Isaac Komnenos of Cyprus, whom he had defeated during the Third Crusade in 1191, reflecting a significant involvement of local soldiers, sailors, and vessels in the holy war. The 800 anniversary was celebrated in 1994 as the city's founding.|$|E
5|$|While still {{embroiled in}} his {{conflict}} with Longchamp, Geoffrey began feuding with Hugh du Puiset, probably over Geoffrey's authority in Puiset's diocese of Durham, {{one of those}} subject to York. The dispute dragged on for years, with many appeals to Rome and the king. York had been vacant for several years, and Puiset had grown used to having untrammelled authority in the northern archdiocese. After Geoffrey's consecration, <b>he</b> <b>summoned</b> Puiset to a provincial synod in late September 1191, at which the bishop was charged with various irregularities. Puiset appealed to Rome and refused to attend the synod, and was excommunicated in December by Geoffrey. An attempt in March 1192 by Queen Eleanor and Hubert Walter to settle the issue came to nothing when Geoffrey insisted on a pledge of obedience from Puiset, who in turn demanded an admission from Geoffrey that the excommunication had been unjust. Further appeals to Rome led to an eventual settlement in October 1192, when the bishop finally acknowledged Geoffrey's authority over Durham.|$|E
5|$|John Appleyard had profited {{in terms}} of offices and annuities from his brother-in-law's rise ever since 1559; he was {{nevertheless}} disappointed with what he had got from Robert Dudley, now Earl of Leicester. In 1567 he was approached, apparently {{on behalf of the}} Duke of Norfolk and the Earl of Sussex, to accuse Leicester of the murder of his wife for a reward of £1,000 in cash. He refused to cooperate in the plot, although he had, he said, {{in the last few years}} come to believe that his half-sister was murdered. He had always been convinced of Dudley's innocence but thought it would be an easy matter to find out the real culprits. He said he had repeatedly asked for the Earl's help to this effect, claiming the jury had not yet come up with their verdict; Dudley had always answered that the matter should rest, since a jury had found that there was no murder, by due procedure of law. Now, as Leicester became aware of a plot against him, <b>he</b> <b>summoned</b> Appleyard and sent him away after a furious confrontation.|$|E

5|$|On 27 March 1625, King James I of England died, and was {{succeeded by}} his son, who became Charles I. Along with the throne, Charles {{inherited}} the Thirty Years' War, in which Christian IV of Denmark and Frederick V, Elector Palatine, {{who was married}} to Charles's sister Elizabeth, were attempting to take back their hereditary lands and titles from the Habsburg Monarchy. James had caused significant financial problems with his attempts to support Christian and Frederick, and {{it was expected that}} Charles would be more amenable to prosecuting the war responsibly. After <b>he</b> <b>summoned</b> a new Parliament to meet in April 1625, it became clear that he was not; he demanded over £700,000 to assist in prosecuting the war. The House of Commons refused, and instead passed two bills granting him only £112,000. In addition, rather than renewing the customs due from Tonnage and Poundage for the entire life of the monarch, which was traditional, the Commons only voted them in for one year. Because of this, the House of Lords rejected the bill, leaving Charles without any money to provide for the war effort.|$|E
5|$|Stephen's brother, Henry of Blois, {{was alarmed}} by this, {{both as a}} matter of principle, since Stephen had {{previously}} agreed in 1135 to respect the freedoms of the church, and more pragmatically because he himself had recently built six castles and had no desire to be treated in the same way. As the papal legate, <b>he</b> <b>summoned</b> the King to appear before an ecclesiastical council to answer for the arrests and seizure of property. Henry asserted the Church's right to investigate and judge all charges against members of the clergy. Stephen sent Aubrey de Vere as his spokesman to the council, who argued that Roger of Salisbury had been arrested not as a bishop, but rather in his role as a baron who had been preparing to change his support to the Empress Matilda. The King was supported by Hugh, Archbishop of Rouen, who challenged the bishops to show how canon law entitled them to build or hold castles. Aubrey threatened that Stephen would complain to the pope that he was being harassed by the English church, and the council let the matter rest following an unsuccessful appeal to Rome. The incident successfully removed any military threat from the bishops, but it may have damaged Stephen's relationship with the senior clergy, and in particular with his brother Henry.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} led by Montfort soon {{ran into}} problems; he faced poor finances, general disorder, {{and the threat}} of invasion from exiled royalists in France. It was decidedsince the French arbitration committee had come to nothingto set up a provisional administration, consisting of Montfort, the young Earl of Gloucester, and the Bishop of Chichester. These three were to elect a council of nine, to govern until a permanent settlement could be reached. By the Peace of Canterbury in August, Henry and Edward were forced to accept even stricter terms than those of the Mise of Lewes. According to this new agreement, the current form of government was to remain in force throughout the reign of King Henry, and into that of Edward. To keep the borders safe, Montfort had been forced to release Roger Mortimer and other royalist Marcher lords after the Battle of Lewes. In December, Montfort forced Mortimer, Roger de Clifford and Roger de Leybourne to promise to leave the country for Ireland. Then, in January, <b>he</b> <b>summoned</b> a parliament at Leicester which became known as Montfort's Parliament, including representatives from the shires and boroughs; an innovation in English government. Here Montfort secured the support of the community of the realm for his continued reign.|$|E
