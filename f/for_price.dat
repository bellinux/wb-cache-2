5|$|A {{few days}} after Babs struck the Philippines, then-Philippine {{president}} Joseph Estrada declared four provinces as a state of calamity and ordered the release of ₱200million (PHP) in emergency funds. Estrada later released an additional ₱50million (PHP) specifically for Catanduanes, as well as ₱10,000 sent {{to the family of}} each storm fatality. The Philippine Navy sent rubber boats to Bato, Catanduanes to help with relief there. The president ordered agencies to work together to respond to the disaster and for his Trade Secretary to watch <b>for</b> <b>price</b> gouging. However, food prices tripled following Babs and Zeb, especially after roads were blocked from agriculture areas, and ferries from unaffected areas were unable to travel due to the storm.|$|E
5|$|Liquor {{was another}} {{profitable}} private industry nationalized {{by the central}} government in 98 BC. However, this was repealed in 81 BC and a property tax rate of two coins for every 0.2L (0.05 gallons) was levied for those who traded it privately. By 110 BC Emperor Wu also interfered with the profitable trade in grain when he eliminated speculation by selling government-stored grain {{at a lower price}} than demanded by merchants. Apart from Emperor Ming's creation of a short-lived Office <b>for</b> <b>Price</b> Adjustment and Stabilization, which was abolished in 68 AD, central-government price control regulations were largely absent during the Eastern Han.|$|E

5|$|The Minister of Finance (Da sinong 大司農) {{was also}} called the Grand Minister of Agriculture, and before 144 BC, was known as Clerk of the Capital for Grain (Zhisu neishi 治粟內史). This {{minister}} was the central government's treasurer for the official bureaucracy and the armed forces. While the Chancellor drafted the state budget, the Minister of Finance was responsible for funding it. He {{was in charge of}} storing the poll taxes, which were gathered in coin cash, and land tax, which was gathered as a proportion of farmers' annual crop yields. He was also responsible for setting the standards for units of measurement. In addition to reviewing tax collections, he could implement policies <b>for</b> <b>price</b> control exacted on certain commercial commodities.|$|E
5|$|The {{quotation}} {{price of}} Olympus shares on the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) on 15 November had fallen by some 75percent since the scandal erupted. The price {{continued to be}} volatile: trading was halted as its price hit the upper limit <b>for</b> <b>price</b> falls. On 14 and 15 November, after the threat of delisting ebbed, trading in its shares was once again halted when buy orders heavily outnumbered sell orders; the price rose by the upper limit of ¥100. Trading only took place after hours as there was a glut of unsatisfied buy orders. The share price rose in four straight trading sessions, reaching 834yen at one point on 16 November.|$|E
5|$|There {{has been}} {{controversy}} over the contract between the MWAA and Dulles Transit Partners, which consists of Bechtel and Washington Group International. The $2.7 billion project was originally awarded by VDOT under the Virginia Public-Private Partnership Act, rather than by using conventional competitive bidding based upon a detailed specification. As a result, the contractor is allowed to both design and build the project with no upper cap on its cost. Problems could arise from the arrangement where MWAA is supervising the design and construction but ultimately WMATA must operate the Silver Line. The contract provides <b>for</b> <b>price</b> escalation of $3 million to $6 million a month for delays. VDOT transferred the contract to MWAA when MWAA took over the project in November 2008.|$|E

5|$|Because of the {{long-term}} effects of inflation, notably the significant increase of movie theater ticket prices, the list unadjusted for inflation gives far more weight to later films. The unadjusted list, while commonly found in the press, is therefore largely meaningless for comparing films widely separated in time, as many films from earlier eras will never appear on a modern unadjusted list, despite achieving higher commercial success when adjusted <b>for</b> <b>price</b> increases. To compensate for the devaluation of the currency, some charts make adjustments for inflation, but not even this practice fully addresses the issue since ticket prices and inflation do not necessarily parallel one another. For example, in 1970, tickets cost $1.55 or about $6.68 in inflation-adjusted 2004 dollars; by 1980, prices had risen to about $2.69, a drop to $5.50 in inflation-adjusted 2004 dollars. Ticket prices have also risen at different rates of inflation around the world, further complicating the process of adjusting worldwide grosses.|$|E

25|$|In micro{{economic}}s, {{supply and}} demand is an economic model of price determination in a market. It postulates that in a competitive market, the unit price for a particular good, or other traded item such as labor or liquid financial assets, will vary until it settles {{at a point where}} the quantity demanded (at the current price) will equal the quantity supplied (at the current price), resulting in an economic equilibrium <b>for</b> <b>price</b> and quantity transacted.|$|E

25|$|The euro {{introduction}} in 2002, {{with its}} various exchange rates, distorted existing nominal price patterns {{while at the}} same time retaining real prices. A European wide study (el Sehity, Hoelzl and Kirchler, 2005) investigated consumer price digits before and after the euro introduction <b>for</b> <b>price</b> adjustments. The research showed a clear trend towards psychological pricing after the transition. Further, Benford's Law as a benchmark for the investigation of price digits was successfully introduced into the context of pricing. The importance of this benchmark for detecting irregularities in prices was demonstrated and with it a clear trend towards psychological pricing after the nominal shock of the euro introduction.|$|E
25|$|Streisand's 20-concert tour set box-office records. At {{the age of}} 64, she grossed $92,457,062 and set house gross {{records in}} 14 of the 16 arenas played on the tour. She set the third-place record for her show of October 9, 2006 at Madison Square Garden, the first- and second-place records, of which are held by her two shows in September 2000. She set the second-place record at MGM Grand Garden Arena with her December 31, 1999, show being the house record and highest-grossing concert of all time. This led many people to openly criticize Streisand <b>for</b> <b>price</b> gouging as many tickets sold for upwards of $1,000.|$|E

25|$|A {{commodity}} {{market is a}} market that trades in primary economic sector rather than manufactured products. Soft commodities are agricultural products such as wheat, coffee, cocoa, fruit and sugar. Hard commodities are mined, such as gold and oil. Investors access about 50 major {{commodity market}}s worldwide with purely financial transactions increasingly outnumbering physical trades in which goods are delivered. Futures contracts are the oldest way of investing in commodities. Futures are secured by physical assets. Commodity markets can include physical trading and derivatives trading using spot prices, forwards, futures, and options on futures. Farmers have used a simple form of derivative trading in the commodity market for centuries <b>for</b> <b>price</b> risk management.|$|E
25|$|The {{problem with}} long-run time series <b>for</b> <b>price</b> {{aggregates}} is, {{that they often}} disregard many qualitative changes in the components of those aggregates, or, {{it is assumed that}} these qualitative changes have no real quantitative significance for comparative purposes. A variable is thought to stay qualitatively the same across time, when in reality it does not remain the same. Michael Perelman, for example, shows that the content and economic meaning of capital aggregates can change considerably even within one decade or so. For example, the changing stratification of physical capital assets in the total capital stock, in terms of their age, exerts an independent influence on the productivity and profitability of enterprises.|$|E
