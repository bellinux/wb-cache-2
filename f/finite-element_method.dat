The conventional method of {{finite element analysis}} involves converting the differential equation that governs the problem into a variational functional from which element nodal properties - known as field variables - can be found. This can be solved by substituting in approximate solutions to the differential equation and generating the finite element stiffness matrix which is combined with all the elements in the continuum to obtain the global stiffness matrix. Application of the relevant boundary conditions to this global matrix, and the subsequent solution of the field variables rounds off the mathematical process, following which numerical computations {{can be used to}} solve real life engineering problems.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe {{prove the}} {{convergence}} of a least-squares mixed <b>finite-element</b> <b>method</b> for the Stokes equations with zero residual of mass conservation. For the standard least squares mixed <b>finite-element</b> <b>method,</b> the equations for continuity of mass, and momentum are minimized in a global sense. Therefore, the mass may not be conserved at every point of the discretization. Recently, in [1], a modified least squares <b>finite-element</b> <b>method</b> is developed to enforce near zero residual of mass conservation. This is achieved by attaching a discrete divergence free constrain to the standard least squares <b>finite-element</b> <b>method,</b> and as a consequence, the number of equations is increased.

In this work, a {{class of}} new <b>finite-element</b> <b>methods,</b> called immersed-interface <b>finite-element</b> <b>methods,</b> is {{developed}} to solve elliptic interface problems with nonhomogeneous jump conditions.

Special finite-element basis functions are constructed for nodal points near the interface to satisfy the homogeneous jump conditions. Error analysis and numerical tests are presented to demonstrate that such methods have an optimal convergence rate.
