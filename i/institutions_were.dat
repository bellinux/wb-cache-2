5|$|By 1661, Copenhagen had {{asserted}} {{its position}} as capital of Denmark and Norway. All the major <b>institutions</b> <b>were</b> located there, {{as was the}} fleet {{and most of the}} army. The defences were further enhanced with the completion of the Citadel in 1664 and the extension of Christianshavns Vold with its bastions in 1692, leading {{to the creation of a}} new base for the fleet at Nyholm.|$|E

5|$|The Abbasids were {{followed}} by the Saffarids. Zoroastrians lived {{under the leadership of}} their High Priest, since they had no king. In Iraq, the political center of the Sassanian state, Zoroastrian <b>institutions</b> <b>were</b> viewed as appendages of the royal government and family, and suffered much destruction and confiscation. Closely associated with the power structures of the Persian Empire, Zoroastrian clergy quickly declined after it was deprived of the state support.|$|E
5|$|The Treaty {{stated that}} the {{location}} of the institutions would be decided by common accord of the members, yet the issue was hotly contested.

5|$|Two {{post-secondary}} <b>institutions</b> <b>were</b> {{established in}} Scarborough. The University of Toronto expanded in 1964 {{and built the}} University of Toronto Scarborough, which has an enrolment of 10,000 students as of 2006. Centennial College was opened in 1966. It was the first community college to open in Ontario. Starting from one campus in Warden Woods, it grew to three campuses across Scarborough (and a fourth in East York).|$|E
5|$|Concurrently, Bangui {{also became}} the key centre {{for social and}} {{cultural}} activity in the region, when new <b>institutions</b> <b>were</b> established in the city. However, political turmoil in the country, rampant corruption, and the dictatorial rule of President Bokassa centred in the city, brought in economic recession in the 1970s exacerbated by a fall in international prices for its major exports. This caused impoverishment {{of the people and}} severe conflict, further compounded by refugees migrating from troubled neighbouring countries.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 20th century, reform {{movements}} in the U.S. (the so-called Progressive movement) made most forms of gambling illegal in most communities. Gambling continued illegally in many places, though, creating new opportunities for criminal enterprises. The 18th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, ratified in 1919, outlawed the manufacture, transportation, importation, and sale of alcoholic beverages and initiated the Prohibition era. The new law was widely unpopular, and bootlegging became rampant. Galveston's already lax social attitudes allowed this, as well as brothels and other illegal businesses, to blossom in the city. These <b>institutions</b> <b>were</b> so accepted that at one point, the city required health inspections for prostitutes {{to ensure the safety}} of their clients.|$|E

50|$|In U.S. law, {{whether an}} <b>institution</b> <b>is</b> {{public or private}} determines how bound the <b>institution</b> <b>is</b> to the {{requirements}} for civil rights to which the state must conform (see also Equal Protection Clause). A public <b>institution</b> <b>is</b> required {{to conform to the}} same requirements as the state for constitutional questions meaning that the U.S. Constitution, especially the Bill of Rights, applies to the institution as does the constitution of the state in which the public institution resides. Court cases involving public <b>institutions</b> <b>are</b> within the jurisdiction of the U.S. Federal Court System.|$|R

5|$|In {{the late}} Middle Ages, the Norwegian state was {{severely}} weakened. In 1389 Norway {{entered into a}} personal union with Denmark and Sweden in the Kalmar Union. As the kings resided in Denmark, Norway was gradually reduced to a provincial status, and after the Reformation most of its separate <b>institutions</b> <b>were</b> abolished. The Danish government in Copenhagen regarded Norway as a backward province to be exploited, but not worthy of investment in monumental architecture. Hence, ambitious Renaissance architecture is unusual in Norway compared to other European countries.|$|E
5|$|Industry {{developed}} {{rapidly in}} the 19th century. The first horse-drawn railway in the Kingdom of Hungary, from Pressburg to Szentgyörgy Svätý Jur, was built in 1840. A new line to Vienna using steam locomotives was opened in 1848, and a line to Pest in 1850. Many new industrial, financial and other <b>institutions</b> <b>were</b> founded; for example, the first bank in present-day Slovakia was founded in 1842. The city's first permanent bridge over the Danube, Starý most, was built in 1891.|$|E
5|$|Muhammad Ilyas, {{the founder}} of Tablighi Jamaat, {{wanted to create a}} {{movement}} that would enjoin good and forbid evil as the Qur'an decreed, as his teacher Rasheed Ahmad Gangohi dreamed of doing. The inspiration for this came during his second pilgrimage to Mecca in 1926. What he lacked in scholarly learning, presence, charisma or speaking ability, he made up for in zeal. He initially tried to establish a network of mosque-based religious schools to educate the Mewati Muslims about Islamic beliefs and practices. Shortly afterwards, he was disappointed with the reality that these <b>institutions</b> <b>were</b> producing religious functionaries, but not preachers.|$|E
30|$|Human {{societies}} are amalgamation of several norm based institutions that give order to otherwise random interactions. <b>Institutions</b> <b>are</b> structures based on mutual incentives based on predefined contracts. Social, Political and economic institutions represents {{the norms of}} a society and interactions of its members. Institutes establish standardization in response from a member entity which in absence of an <b>institution</b> <b>is</b> free to act solely for its own benefit. Institution helps in controlling the greediness of individual entities and brings order to a system (North 1996). Electronic <b>Institutions</b> <b>are</b> a relatively new field where the concept of human <b>institutions</b> <b>is</b> extended to Multi Agent Systems (MAS) (Luck et al. 2003, 2005; Wooldridge 2002) and Distributed Artificial Intelligence (DAI) (Stone and Veloso 2000). Some early attempts towards the use of organizational metaphors for system modelling systems were presented in (Pattison et al. 1987; Werner 1989). The first approach towards electronic <b>institutions</b> <b>was</b> given in (Noriega 1999) where an abstract notion agent-mediated electronic <b>institution</b> <b>was</b> introduced for the first time. These <b>institutions</b> <b>are</b> described as environments where agents are interacting with other agents under predefined restrictions. An <b>institution</b> <b>is</b> specified {{by a set of}} pre-defined norms that restrict actions of its member agents. The idea of an electronic <b>institution</b> <b>is</b> very open and various groups (Aldewereld et al. 2005; Dignum 2004; López 2003) are working on this problem with different perspectives. Electronic institutions require limited human intervention for institution design phase. In open agent systems, it is necessary to automate the design phase of institutions.|$|R

5|$|Taxes were levied on {{artisans}} such as potters, sheep herders, weavers, oilmen, shopkeepers, stall owners, brewers and gardeners. Taxes on perishable {{items such}} as fish, meat, honey, medicine, fruits and essentials like fuel was as high as 16%. Taxes on salt and minerals were mandatory although the empire did not claim sole ownership of mines, implying that private mineral prospecting and the quarrying business may have been active. The state claimed all such properties whose deceased legal owner had no immediate family to make an inheritance claim. Other miscellaneous taxes included ferry and house taxes. Only Brahmins and their temple <b>institutions</b> <b>were</b> taxed at a lower rate.|$|E
5|$|The League {{oversaw the}} Permanent Court of International Justice {{and several other}} {{agencies}} and commissions created to deal with pressing international problems. These included the Disarmament Commission, the International Labour Organisation (ILO), the Mandates Commission, the International Commission on Intellectual Cooperation (precursor to UNESCO), the Permanent Central Opium Board, the Commission for Refugees, and the Slavery Commission. Three of these <b>institutions</b> <b>were</b> transferred to the United Nations after the Second World War: the International Labour Organisation, the Permanent Court of International Justice (as the International Court of Justice), and the Health Organisation (restructured as the World Health Organisation).|$|E
5|$|The {{institutions}} of the ECSC were the High Authority, the Common Assembly, the Special Council of Ministers and the Court of Justice. A Consultative Committee was established alongside the High Authority, as a fifth institution representing civil society. This was the first international representation of consumers in history. These <b>institutions</b> <b>were</b> merged in 1967 {{with those of the}} European Community, which then governed the ECSC, except for the Committee, which continued to be independent until the expiration of the Treaty of Paris in 2002.|$|E
50|$|Private <b>institutions</b> <b>are</b> {{privately funded}} {{and there is}} a wide variety in size, focus, and operation. Some private <b>institutions</b> <b>are</b> large {{research}} universities, while others are small liberal arts colleges that concentrate on undergraduate education. Some private universities are nonsectarian and secular, while others are religiously-affiliated. While most private <b>institutions</b> <b>are</b> non-profit, a growing number in the past decade have been established as for-profit.|$|R

50|$|In {{the field}} of social protection, paritarian <b>institutions</b> <b>are</b> {{non-profit}} <b>institutions</b> which <b>are</b> jointly managed by the social partners (representatives of the employers and employees). In other words, the governance of these <b>institutions</b> <b>is</b> based on the equal representation of employees (normally the trade unions) and employers in their governing bodies.|$|R
5|$|The {{respective}} remits of the National and Tate Galleries, {{which had}} long been contested by the two <b>institutions,</b> <b>were</b> more clearly defined in 1996. 1900 was established as the cut-off point for paintings in the National Gallery, and in 1997 more than 60 post-1900 paintings from the collection {{were given to the}} Tate on a long-term loan, in return for works by Gauguin and others. However, future expansion of the National Gallery may yet see the return of 20th-century paintings to its walls.|$|E
5|$|The three {{communities}} were later merged in 1967, by the Merger Treaty, into the European Communities. The <b>institutions</b> <b>were</b> carried {{over from the}} European Economic Community (making the Commission of that community the direct ancestor of the current Commission). Under the Treaties of Rome, the Common Assembly (which renamed itself the Parliamentary Assembly, and then the European Parliament) was supposed to become elected. However this was delayed by the Council until 1979. Since then it gained more powers via successive treaties. The Maastricht Treaty also gave further powers to the Council by giving it {{a key role in}} the two new pillars of the EU which were based on intergovernmental principles.|$|E

40|$|<b>Institutions</b> <b>are</b> the {{heuristic}} {{building blocks}} of human interactions, or the rules that humans use to structure interaction in the social world. <b>Institutions</b> <b>are</b> both universal, meaning that all people possess them and use them, and <b>institutions</b> <b>are</b> also ever-changing and evolving to adapt to new situations and social dilemmas. This literature review in this study demonstrates the need to use Institutional Analysis {{in the field of}} educational policy research, and then establishes groundwork of Institutional literature. The research questions ask whether <b>institutions</b> can <b>be</b> captured, and if so what the institutions of accountability policy are. Accountability policy, specifically the rating system established under ESEA Flexibility, serves as the policy though which <b>institutions</b> <b>are</b> examined because of its complexity and omnipresence in education today. The findings suggest that <b>institutions</b> can <b>be</b> captured and that educators and policymakers are engaged in an institutional clash...|$|R
