By means of two co-digestion processes with cow dung, {{it was observed}} a good performance in the first process and a poor production trend in the second one. NaOH was used as chemical absorbent in two different bottles in the CO 2 <b>fixing</b> <b>unit</b> to compare the volume of biomethane produced. A batch anaerobic codigestion {{was carried out in}} 500 mL digesters which were placed into a water bath at 45 °C and maintained at the initial pH of 7. Important AD factors such as pH, Carbon and Nitrogen ratio (C/N), concentration, substrate composition were observed. Through an ultimate analysis, amount of Carbon (C), Hydrogen (H), Nitrogen (N), and Sulphur (S) were also discussed. The toxicity of other elements found in substrates appeared higher in the second process than in the first.

40|$|Turn-based {{strategy}} games are interesting testbeds for developing artificial players because their rules present developers with several challenges. Currently, Monte-Carlo tree search variants are often utilized {{to address these}} challenges. However, we consider it worthwhile introducing minimax search variants with pruning techniques because a turn-based strategy is in some points similar to the games of chess and Shogi, in which minimax variants {{are known to be}} effective. Thus, we introduced three forward-pruning techniques to enable us to apply alpha beta search (as a minimax search variant) to turn-based {{strategy games}}. This type of search involves <b>fixing</b> <b>unit</b> action orders, generating unit actions selectively, and limiting the number of moving units in a search. We applied our proposed pruning methods by implementing an alpha beta-based artificial player in the Turn-based strategy Academic Package (TUBSTAP) open platform of our institute.

40|$|A {{representation}} {{theory of}} finite electromagnetic beams in free space is formulated by factorizing the field vector of the plane-wave component into a 3 × 2 mapping matrix and a 2 -component Jones-like vector. The mapping matrix has one {{degree of freedom}} that can be described by the azimuthal angle of a <b>fixed</b> <b>unit</b> vector {{with respect to the}} wave vector. This degree of freedom allows us to find out such a beam solution in which every plane-wave component is specified by the same <b>fixed</b> <b>unit</b> vector I and has the same normalized Jones-like vector. The angle θ_I between the <b>fixed</b> <b>unit</b> vector and the propagation axis acts as a parameter that describes the vectorial property of the beam. The impact of θ_I is investigated on a beam of angular-spectrum field scalar that is independent of the azimuthal angle. The field vector in position space is calculated in the first-order approximation under the paraxial condition. A transverse effect is found that a beam of elliptically-polarized angular spectrum is displaced from the center in the direction that is perpendicular to the plane formed by the <b>fixed</b> <b>unit</b> vector and the propagation axis. The expression of the transverse displacement is obtained. Its paraxial approximation is also given. Comment: 16 pages. The final version appears in the Phys. Rev. ...|$|R

40|$|With {{ultrasonic}} hot embossing microstructures can be embossed from a metal tool into semi-finished {{plastic products}} such as films, sheets or filaments. Because usually no vacuum or long heating and cooling processes are necessary, short cycle times of a few seconds can be realized. Significantly more time must be spent on the manually alignment and fixing of the semi-finished products, {{as well as the}} demoulding of the embossed structures by hand. These manual steps have now been replaced by an automated roll-to-roll production process. Both films and filaments with ultrasonic hot embossed microstructures can be produced from roll-to-roll. Up to six films are handled automatically from feed rollers, led to the <b>fixing</b> <b>unit,</b> are ultrasonic hot embossed, demolded and rewound onto another roll. Various microfluidic structures such as channels, heat exchangers or mixers were embossed. Since the embossing result is dependent on the temperature, the temperature curve and its influence on the ultrasonic hot embossing process especially at the short cycle times of the automated production were determined. The temperature of the embossing tool was monitored during the entire process. Because of the faster temperature rise very short cycle times {{could not be reached for}} larger structures without affecting the embossing result. Minimum cycle times of 3 - 6 seconds for the tested structures were reached. Plastic filaments can also be micro structured with the automated system. The raw filament, 400 micron in thickness, is unwound from a supply roll, embossed and then wound again onto another roll. The embossed microstructures function as predetermined breaking points. Displaying different load levels the filaments can be used as overload sensors in synthetic fiber ropes. Because in this case the process of ultrasonic hot embossing takes less than one second, the cycle time is mainly affected by the distance between the predetermined breaking points. With a distance of 300 mm between the predetermined breaking points, the manufacturing time for one kilometer sensor is about four hours. In addition to the development of the sensors with predetermined breaking points, the produced sensors were integrated and tested in different synthetic fiber ropes...|$|E
40|$|DE 10021341 A UPAB: 20020213 NOVELTY - The {{assembly}} to lay weft yarns, preferably in a multi-layer structure of multi-axial yarns, has a controlled yarn layer (30) {{to guide the}} wefts (20). It is moved together with rows of moving hooks on chains at the edges to hold the yarns in place and move the laid yarn layer(s) in a forward direction while retaining their orientation. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - In a laying cycle of the weft yarn band laying system, the yarn layer carries a number of wefts, to lay them at the moving edge hooks {{in at least two}} laying stages for different yarn orientations and at least two laying stages on the reverse movements. The width of the laid weft yarns is controlled at the side edges of the yarn layer(s) or outside the laying stages. The start position of the forward and backward layer laying stage is set according to an actual position of an oriented weft yarn band already laid in place, which is the actual growth position in relation to the hook chains. The advance movement of the hook carrier chains is controlled according to the duration of a yarn laying cycle. The hook carrier chains have a synchronized forward movement, according to the yarn laying cycle. The yarn laying cycle has a laying stage for the oriented yarns, a deflection stage around the edge hooks, and a return stage with a different yarn orientation. The gaps between the yarn guide openings (33) at the yarn layer are altered according to changes in the yarn laying orientation. Before adjustment, the yarn layer is rotated into a different angular alignment. The control sets the number of yarn laying stages at the edge hooks for different laying cycles and/or an advance of the laid and oriented wefts in each laying cycle, according to the advance movement of the hook chains on each laying cycle. The yarn laying movement extends as far as behind the needles of a side edge fixing system. After laying a band of wefts, the orientation is set by the yarn layer at an entry point for the next laying stage. A laying stage is extended after the side edge, by the length of a racking path, while the yarn layer is lowered. As the yarn layer is lowered, an edge fixing system grips the band of wefts from above to apply a grip to fix a section of the laid yarn band. The yarn layer and edge fixing system move on a swing path to the hook laying point of the next laying stage, and the yarn is transferred at the hook laying point. As the laid yarn is moved upwards in a curved yarn laying action around the hook laying point, the next laying stage starts to apply tension to the yarn. The <b>fixing</b> <b>unit</b> has a comb structure to grip the tensed yarns to give a new hook laying width between the fixing system and the yarn layer. The laid yarns can be tensed by lowering the yarn layer to a transfer comb, to tense the yarns at it by an angled rear movement and a following upwards movement and release them from the fixing system. An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is included for a system to lay bands of weft yarns at given orientations, by a controlled yarn layer which carries a number of weft yarns, to be caught at the edges by hooks on moving chains. Preferred Features: An additional yarn layer is used when laying more than three layers of weft yarns. The interval can be adjusted between the yarn guide openings at the layer, and the yarn guides (32, 34) can be in a number of parts. The yarn layer has a slitted plate with diverging yarn channels, especially as slits. The plate can have a lateral sliding movement to set the yarn guide slits according to the width of the laid band of wefts. The yarn layer can be rotated to alter the gaps between the weft yarns. The yarn layer can have a grid bar with holes to guide the weft yarns, to be rotated into different angular alignments for a laying stage. The weft layer, to lay a number of weft yarn band layers, gives layers in mirror image alignments against each other. USE - The assembly is for laying bands of weft yarns to be held at the edges by hooks on moving chains. ADVANTAGE - The operation gives a smooth transfer of weft direction around the edge hooks. Weft yarn losses at the edges are reduced, with an increased number of weft yarns. The productivity is increased without increasing the yarn laying speed...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{a new class}} of stochastic unit root (STUR) processes, where the randomness of the autorregresive unit root is driven by a threshold variable. These new models, the threshold autorregresive stochastic unit root (TARSUR) models, are stationary in some regimes and mildly explosive in others. TARSUR models are not only an alternative to <b>fixed</b> <b>unit</b> root models but present interpretation, estimation and testing advantages with respect to the existent STUR models. The paper analyzes the stationarity properties of the TARSUR models and proposes a simple t -statistic for testing the null hypothesis of a <b>fixed</b> <b>unit</b> root versus a stochastic unit root hypothesis. It is shown that its asymptotic distribution (AD) depends on the knowledge we have about the threshold values: known, unknown but identified, and unknown and unidentified. In the first two cases the AD is a standard Normal distribution, while in the last one the AD is a functional of Brownian Motions and Brownian Sheets. Monte Carlo simulations show that the proposed tests behave very well in finite samples and that the Dickey-Fuller test cannot easily distinguish between an exact unit root and a threshold stochastic unit root. The paper concludes with applications to stock prices and interest rates where the hypothesis of a <b>fixed</b> <b>unit</b> root is rejected in favor of the threshold stochastic unit root...|$|R
