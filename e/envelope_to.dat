5|$|Fox Mulder (David Duchovny), Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi), {{and several}} other FBI agents take part in an {{undercover}} operation in a Washington park to catch Jacob Haley (Daniel von Bargen), the second-in-command of an anti-government militia called the New Spartans. As Skinner and Scully monitor the operation from a van, Mulder and the other agents slowly close in on Haley. Haley hands an <b>envelope</b> <b>to</b> another man (Armin Moattar) before escaping. The agents discover that the man's flesh has been eaten away by an unknown toxin.|$|E
5|$|Leaving the building, Jeff finds all {{the pages}} in the <b>envelope</b> <b>to</b> be blank. He returns {{to the office of}} Dr. Duncan who tells him that he wanted to teach him a lesson {{although}} Jeff gets his car keys back. As he is about to leave campus, Jeff runs into Pierce and Troy, and shows his ability to make people feel better about themselves through advice and encouragement. The others join, and Jeff admits to being a fraud. He says that he does not have the test answers, and that he will probably flunk next day's test. The group has now taken a liking to him, and they invite him back in. The episode ends with a dedication to the recently deceased John Hughes, whose film The Breakfast Club had been repeatedly referenced throughout the episode.|$|E
5|$|On 11May the briefcase, {{complete}} with the documents, was returned to Haselden by the Spanish authorities; he forwarded it to London in the diplomatic bag. On receipt the documents were forensically examined, and the missing eyelash noted. Further tests showed that the fibres in the paper had been damaged by folding more than once, which confirmed that the letters had been extracted and read. An additional test was made as the papers – still wet {{by the time they}} returned to London – were dried out: the folded paper dried into the rolled form it had when the Spaniards had extracted it from the <b>envelope.</b> <b>To</b> allay any potential German fears that their activities had been discovered, another pre-arranged encrypted but breakable cable was sent to Haselden stating that the envelopes had been examined and that they had not been opened; Haselden leaked the news to Spaniards known to be sympathetic to the Germans.|$|E

5|$|The fifth contest was a Full Metal Mayhem {{match for}} a future match on Impact! for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. Early in the match, Abyss placed two tables {{side-by-side}} and then stacked two more on top of those at ringside. Mid-way through the match, Hardy grabbed Abyss and placed him on a table {{at the top of}} the entrance ramp, he then ascended to the roof of the entrance ramp and performed a front-flip, landing on Abyss in a move Hardy calls the Swanton Bomb. In the final minutes of the match, Hardy climbed a ladder and retrieved one of the envelopes, however, it was empty which meant the last one held the future championship match. Hardy then tried to move the ladder and retrieve the second envelope. While he was climbing again, Abyss grabbed him and pulled him down, he then threw Hardy against the ropes. When Hardy connected with the ropes, he flipped over them and crashed through the four tables set up earlier in the match. Abyss followed by climbing the ladder and removing the <b>envelope</b> <b>to</b> win the match.|$|E
5|$|The {{main event}} {{was for the}} NWA World Heavyweight Championship between the champion, Jeff Jarrett, and the challenger, Kevin Nash, in which Jarrett won to retain the championship. Another {{featured}} match was an Iron Man match for the TNA X Division Championship, in which the wrestler with the most scoring conditions after thirty minutes would win. The champion, A.J. Styles, defeated the challenger, Christopher Daniels, to retain the championship in this match. Multiple bouts were scheduled on the undercard. One saw Abyss defeat Jeff Hardy in a match where the competitors had to climb a ladder and retrieve an <b>envelope</b> <b>to</b> become number one contender to the NWA World Heavyweight Championship, in {{what is called a}} Full Metal Mayhem match. The other being for the NWA World Tag Team Championship between the champions, America's Most Wanted (Chris Harris and James Storm) (AMW), and Kid Kash and Lance Hoyt; AMW claimed victory in the match.|$|E
5|$|Between 7:00a.m. and 8:00a.m. CT on March 3, {{the morning}} Fischer was killed, Olivarez {{confirmed}} with Garza {{at the motel}} that the murder was successful. He then went to Martínez' shop {{to tell her the}} teenager was dead. She told Garza that she would not give him the money unless there was solid proof that Fischer was dead. Garza then talked with Olivarez and Puentes Pizaña at the motel room. A few hours after the murder, Martínez phoned Cisneros and told her that the job had been carried out. Cisneros arrived at her store minutes later and left a sealed envelope with the money. Cisneros then went to St. Joe and picked up her daughter from school. Later that evening, Garza and Puentes Pizaña met with Martínez and picked up the envelope. They headed back to the motel and Garza handed over the <b>envelope</b> <b>to</b> Olivarez. Garza claims that the hitmen received $3,500, though he stated he never counted the money. Martínez said she did and that it was $3,000. Investigators believe it could have been as much as $5,000. Garza was then picked up by his nephew from Matamoros and taken to the Harlingen airport, where he flew back to San Antonio. On his way to the airport, he passed through Rancho Viejo and recalled seeing police cars and a house cordoned off with yellow tape.|$|E
5000|$|Glassine is also {{recommended}} {{for protecting the}} surface of stored acrylic paintings. Philatelists use glassine <b>envelopes</b> <b>to</b> store stamps, and stamp hinges are made of glassine. Amateur insect collectors use glassine <b>envelopes</b> <b>to</b> store specimens temporarily in the field before they are mounted in a collection. Entomologists collecting for research may likewise use such <b>envelopes</b> <b>to</b> store whole specimens in the field. Glassine <b>envelopes</b> are used <b>to</b> carry pharmacy reformulated drugs and illicit drugs such as cocaine and heroin.In the mid-20th century, potato chips were packaged in glassine bags. Glassine {{is also used to}} pack firecrackers, as it is moisture resistant. It is used for its transparent qualities to fold origami tessellations. Glassine is an outer covering on paperboard tubes, particularly those used in model rocketry, for water protection. Some people may have noticed the word [...] "glassine" [...] in crime novels, where evidence is described being placed in glassine bags.|$|R

25|$|Winners were {{announced}} to media three months earlier. That was {{changed for the}} second ceremony in 1930. Since then, {{for the rest of}} the first decade, the results were given to newspapers for publication at 11:00pm on the night of the awards. This method was used until an occasion when the Los Angeles Times announced the winners before the ceremony began; as a result, the Academy has, since 1941, used a sealed <b>envelope</b> <b>to</b> reveal the name of the winners.|$|E
25|$|Design {{work was}} done at Brighton, the overall {{programme}} being overseen by R.A. Riddles. The principal modifications to the Fairburn design involved the reduction of their <b>envelope</b> <b>to</b> enable them {{to fit into the}} L1 loading gauge. To do this the tanks and cab were made more curved than the Fairburn design, the Fairburn having a straight-sided tank. The biggest mechanical change was a reduction in cylinder size, also to reduce cross-section, and a corresponding increase in boiler pressure to compensate. Other visible changes include the reintroduction of plating ahead of the cylinders.|$|E
50|$|HASQI and its 2014 {{revision}} are double-ended methods requiring both a clean {{reference and}} the degraded signal to allow evaluation. The index attempts {{to capture the}} effects of noise, nonlinear distortion, linear filtering and spectral changes, by computing the difference or correlation between key audio features. This is done by examining short-time signal <b>envelopes</b> <b>to</b> quantify the degradation caused by noise and nonlinear filtering, and long-time signal <b>envelopes</b> <b>to</b> quantify the effects of linear filtering. Version 2 of HASQI includes a model to capture {{some aspects of the}} peripheral auditory system for both normal and hearing impaired listeners.|$|R
5000|$|With the XM format, FastTracker 2 {{introduced}} {{the concept of}} [...] "instruments", which applied volume and panning <b>envelopes</b> <b>to</b> samples. It also added the ability to map several samples to the same instrument for multi-sampled instruments or drum sets. XM uses instrument-based panning - instrument numbers in patterns always reset the channel’s panning to the current sample's initial panning. It uses MOD effect command letters, plus a few of its own for more sound control. The composer can define initial tempos and speeds; provide <b>envelopes</b> <b>to</b> samples by assigning them to instruments; set sample looping and apply automatic sample vibrato oscillation.|$|R

25|$|Some Air Commandos now {{began to}} {{infiltrate}} Laos. In May 1964, two formed a skeletal Air Operations Center at Wattay outside Vientiane. The Air Commandos also pushed the <b>envelope</b> <b>to</b> sneakily fly some combat missions {{from time to}} time. Moreover, when U.S. Navy Lieutenant Charles F. Klusman was shot down on an armed reconnaissance mission on 6 June 1964, B and A Team pilots successively flew cover for the combat search and rescue effort. Also in June, a Waterpump officer and two enlisted specialists were covertly sent to Luang Prabang to support B Team efforts there.|$|E
25|$|Worldwide Aeros {{was awarded}} a patent of their control of static {{heaviness}} system (COSH) internal buoyancy management system in May 2015. The COSH system internally ballasts the non-flammable helium into the aircraft’s helium pressure envelopes (HPEs), helping the vehicle manage buoyant lift. The HPE units contain and control the compressed helium and allow the overall helium volume <b>envelope</b> <b>to</b> be reduced or increased, enabling the air vehicle to become heavy or buoyant in a controlled manner. The compression of helium into the HPE’s creates a negative pressure within the Aeroscraft Aeroshell, permitting air-expansion chambers to fill with readily-available environmental ballast (air), which acts in concert with reduced Helium static lift to make the Aeroscraft heavier, when desired, to compensate for adjustments in payload.|$|E
25|$|The {{filaments}} require {{constant and}} often considerable power, even when amplifying signals at the microwatt level. Power is also dissipated when the electrons from the cathode slam into the anode (plate) and heat it; this can occur {{even in an}} idle amplifier due to quiescent currents necessary to ensure linearity and low distortion. In a power amplifier, this heating can be considerable and can destroy the tube if driven beyond its safe limits. Since the tube contains a vacuum, the anodes in most small and medium power tubes are cooled by radiation through the glass envelope. In some special high power applications, the anode forms part of the vacuum <b>envelope</b> <b>to</b> conduct heat to an external heat sink, usually cooled by a blower, or water-jacket.|$|E
25|$|The {{requirements}} for heat removal can significantly change {{the appearance of}} high-power vacuum tubes. High power audio amplifiers and rectifiers required larger <b>envelopes</b> <b>to</b> dissipate heat. Transmitting tubes could be much larger still.|$|R

25|$|R. romandi nests {{are often}} built under the eaves of buildings. When built {{on such a}} hard surface, the nest, entirely covered by an envelope, forms a {{compressed}} hemisphere with multiple horizontal, flat combs, the largest comb being near the bottom. These combs are connected to each other within the envelope by ribbon-like pedicles. Cells are hexagonal and regularly arranged. The envelope is mostly single layered, however it can be double layered in parts. It is made of plant fibers and fragments and is a uniform light gray color. It is possible for the <b>envelope</b> <b>to</b> be heavily coated in saliva {{to the extent that}} the fibrous material of the envelope itself is completely hidden. A round entrance hole is at the bottom of the hemispherical nest.|$|E
25|$|When nests {{are also}} found built among the {{branches}} of various trees, {{the architecture of the}} nest is changed because of the substrate to which it has to attach. The most noticeable difference is that R. romandi nests connected to branches are sphericsl rather than hemispherical and mostly double-layered, with only a few single-layered sections. The envelope is not a gray color, but instead a creamy brown, suggesting differences in the plants available to construct the nest. The saliva coating of the envelope is thicker when built in trees, suggesting that the thickness of the coat might be related to the rain exposure of the nest location. Instead of a roof, the nests often use leaves from the tree, incorporated into the <b>envelope,</b> <b>to</b> cover the top of the nest. The number of combs in a branch-built nest is almost double that of one built on a solid surface, however they are much more irregular in shape and arrangement.|$|E
25|$|At the June 1994, {{grand jury}} hearing, Ross Cutlery {{provided}} store receipts indicating that Simpson had purchased a 12-inch (305mm) stiletto knife {{six weeks before}} the murders. The knife {{was determined to be}} similar to the one the coroner said caused the stab wounds. The prosecution did not present this evidence at trial after discovering that store employees had sold their story to The National Enquirer for $12,500. The knife was later collected from Simpson's residence by his attorneys; they presented it to Judge Ito and it was subsequently sealed in a manila <b>envelope</b> <b>to</b> be opened only if brought up at trial. This was not the murder weapon: tests on the knife determined that an oil used on new cutlery was still present on the knife, indicating the knife had never been used. The police searched Simpson's Rockingham estate three times and could not find this knife. Simpson told his attorneys exactly where it was in the house and it was promptly recovered.|$|E
