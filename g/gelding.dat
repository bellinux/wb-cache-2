5|$|The brown Oldenburg <b>gelding</b> {{was born}} March 21, 1983, bred by Karl Bernd Westerholt of Lemwerder, Germany. His sire was Welt As and his dam was Warine (his dam's sire was Praefectus xx).|$|E
5|$|Garrett's Miss Pawhuska's owner, Dee Garrett, bred {{her to his}} {{champion}} stallion Vandy, {{and produced}} three world champions: Vandy's Flash, Vanetta Dee, and Vannevar. Vansarita Too set a new track record and Vandy's Betty and Miss Vanity earned AAA speed ratings. Her first foal was Vandy's Betty, {{who went on to}} earn an AAA rating on the race track and became the dam of Mr. Van Deck. Her next foal was Vanetta Dee, who racked up 94 starts with 31 wins, 20 seconds and 16 thirds in six years of racing. Her total earnings were $83,325 (approximately $ in current dollars). Vannevar was the next foal, and was AQHA Champion Racing <b>Gelding</b> in 1956 and 1957. Garrett's Miss Pawhuska's 1954 foal was Vandy's Flash, who was the first <b>gelding</b> named World Champion Quarter Running Horse, in 1960. Garrett's Miss Pawhuska's 1955 foal was Vansarita, who was never raced. A number of miscarriages followed, but in 1958 Garrett's Miss Pawhuska produced Miss Vanity, another AAA-rated racehorse. Garrett's Miss Pawhuska slipped, or lost, her next two foals, but produced Vansarita Too in 1961, who also earned an AAA on the race track. Garrett's Miss Pawhuska's last foal by Vandy was Vandy's Flash, a stallion, who was never raced but sired 107 foals. Garrett's Miss Pawhuska's last foal was not by Vandy, but was by a son of Three Bars named The Ole Man, but the <b>gelding</b> was never raced.|$|E
5|$|Ten-year-old Ballabriggs led {{for much}} of the race, and the <b>gelding</b> {{eventually}} saw off a strong run-in challenge from amateur jockey Sam Waley-Cohen on Oscar Time who secured second place. Third was 2010 winner Tony McCoy on Don't Push It, twelve lengths behind the second. 15/2 favourite The Midnight Club made a mistake at the third fence and finished sixth.|$|E

50|$|Because the <b>geld</b> was {{assessed}} on landowners, it only applied to free men who owned land, and thus serfs and slaves were exempt. Other exemptions were granted to favoured subjects or were a right {{that went with}} certain governmental offices. The <b>geld</b> was unpopular, {{and because of the}} increasing number of exemptions, yielded smaller amounts. During the reign of King Stephen, it is unclear if the <b>geld</b> was collected at all, as no financial records survive. However, when King Henry II came to the throne, the <b>geld</b> was collected once more. After 1162, however the <b>geld</b> was no longer collected.|$|R
5|$|English {{taxation}} {{after the}} Norman Conquest of 1066 {{was based on}} the <b>geld</b> or danegeld, a national tax paid by all free men, those who were not serfs or slaves. The <b>geld</b> {{was based on the}} number of hides of land owned by the taxpayer, and could be demanded by the king and assessed at varying levels without the need for consultation with the barons or other subjects. During King Henry I's reign, an increasing number of exemptions, and the difficulties encountered in collecting the <b>geld,</b> lowered its importance to the Exchequer—the treasury of England. It is unclear whether the <b>geld</b> was collected at all during the reign of Henry's successor, King Stephen. Stephen's successor, King Henry II, collected the <b>geld</b> only twice, once in 1155 and again in 1161–1162. The <b>geld</b> was unpopular, and after 1162 Henry may have felt it politically expedient to stop collecting it.|$|R
5|$|For centuries, the Bedouin {{tracked the}} ancestry of each horse through an oral tradition. Horses of the purest blood {{were known as}} Asil and {{crossbreeding}} with non-Asil horses was forbidden. Mares were the most valued, both for riding and breeding, and pedigree families were traced through the female line. The Bedouin {{did not believe in}} <b>gelding</b> male horses, and considered stallions too intractable to be good war horses, thus they kept very few colts, selling most, and culling those of poor quality.|$|E
5|$|Garrett's Miss Pawhuska's {{official}} race record lists {{her with}} six wins in six starts, {{but it is}} incomplete and is missing some earnings {{as well as some}} races. After racing for two years, she retired to become a broodmare and died in 1975 at age 29. Her son Vandy's Flash was the first <b>gelding</b> to be named a World Champion Quarter Running Horse. She was inducted into the American Quarter Horse Association Hall of Fame.|$|E
5|$|Rembrandt (15 March 1977 – 30 October 2001) {{was a dark}} bay Westphalian <b>gelding</b> ridden for Germany by Nicole Uphoff in {{dressage}} competitions. Together, {{the pair}} won four Olympic gold medals, three gold and one silver World Equestrian Games medals, and numerous other international championships. Although known as a sensitive horse prone to spookiness, Rembrandt's elegance and expression in the ring allowed him {{to become one of}} the top horses in the sport of dressage.|$|E

She had a hall, two carucates and land for three ploughs without <b>geld,</b> and 111 burgesses. Ivo had one church and four mills {{rendering}} 12 shillings, and eight acres of meadow without <b>geld.</b> The lands of Bishop Osmond were described: [...] "In Londonthorpe... is land for two ploughs. This land {{belongs to the}} church of Grantham. In Spittlegate, St Wulfram of Grantham has half a carucate of land to the <b>geld.</b> In Great Gonerby, St Wulfram of Grantham has 1 carucate of land. There is land for twelve oxen." ...|$|R
5|$|A racehorse {{was named}} after the paper in 1991, which was owned by a {{consortium}} of 250Echo readers. The <b>gelding</b> won races at Hamilton, Redcar, Newcastle upon Tyne and Haydock in the early 1990s, but {{had to be put}} down on 17 February 1996 after pulling up badly lame during a routine morning gallop. The Echo was also used in a display at the Science Museum in London in 1999, to show how writing can be made simpler for people with reading difficulties, and a specially printed edition of the newspaper appeared on the TV show Touching Evil, starring Robson Green, in the same year.|$|E
5|$|Bonfire (March 21, 1983 – October 28, 2013), {{full name}} Gestion Bonfire, was an Oldenburg <b>gelding</b> that competed in {{dressage}} with Dutch rider Anky van Grunsven. Between 1991 and 2000, the pair competed in multiple {{national and international}} championships, including three Olympic Games and two World Equestrian Games. They won one gold medal and four silver medals at the Olympics and one gold and three silvers at the World Equestrian Games. Although known for having a hot temperament, Bonfire mellowed as he aged, becoming one of Van Grunsven's best horses – until she found his replacement, Salinero, {{she did not think}} she would ever find a horse to match Bonfire's talent. A statue of Bonfire stands in Van Grunsven's home town of Erp.|$|E
5|$|Rembrandt was foaled in 1977 by Herbert de Baey. His sire was Romadour II, {{a famous}} Westphalian {{stallion}} during the 1970s, and his dam was Adone, full sister to Ahlerich, a multiple Olympic medal winning dressage horse under German rider Reiner Klimke. Due to his Thoroughbred-like appearance, several riders passed over {{a chance to}} purchase the <b>gelding</b> as a youngster. In 1981, he was purchased by Nicole Uphoff's father, Jürgen Uphoff, as a mount for his then-14-year-old daughter. Rembrandt {{was too much for}} her, however, and he was sent to train with Klaus Balkenhol, a noted trainer who saw his potential and advised the Uphoffs to keep the horse, despite his spookiness and sensitivity.|$|E

5|$|The Nez Perce {{people lived}} in what today is eastern Washington, Oregon, and western Idaho, where they engaged in {{agriculture}} as well as horse breeding. The Nez Perce first obtained horses from the Shoshone around 1730. They {{took advantage of the}} fact that they lived in excellent horse-breeding country, relatively safe from the raids of other tribes, and developed strict breeding selection practices for their animals, establishing breeding herds by 1750. They were one of the few tribes that actively used the practice of <b>gelding</b> inferior male horses and trading away poorer stock to remove unsuitable animals from the gene pool, and thus were notable as horse breeders by the early 19th century.|$|E
5|$|The second-place {{finish in}} the Belmont earned Oxbow $200,000 and pushed him over the $1million mark in career earnings, making him the third horse in 2013 to reach $1million in purse wins, behind Orb and a fellow Awesome Again son, the six-year-old <b>gelding</b> Game On Dude. Although the $1million bonus for the horse winning the highest {{combined}} Triple Crown points has long been discontinued, Oxbow would have won it over Orb owing to his win in the Preakness and second in the Belmont. Further, his placing in the Belmont put him at {{number one in the}} post-Belmont June 10 NTRA poll of top three-year-olds, and in the top ten for race horses of all ages.|$|E
5|$|On 2 September 2012, Tan won Singapore's first {{medal at}} the 2012 Summer Paralympics, a bronze in the {{dressage}} Individual Championship Test (class Ia). Riding on Ruben James 2, a <b>gelding</b> from Germany she had only known for ten months, she scored 73.650 percentage points. Two days later, on 4 September, she scored 79.000 in the Individual Freestyle Test (class Ia) which brought her a silver medal. Her wins brought her prizes of $50,000 (for her bronze medal) and $100,000 (silver) from the SNPC's Athletes Achievement Awards scheme, again leading to comments about the stark difference between the cash prizes that Olympic and Paralympic medallists receive. Twenty per cent of the prize money will {{be paid to the}} Singapore National Paralympic Council for training and development. For her achievements, Tan won The Straits Times newspaper's Star of the Month for September, and was conferred a Bintang Bakti Masyarakat (Public Service Star) by the President on 11 November 2012.|$|E

50|$|The tax {{assessment}} in the Domesday Book {{was known as}} <b>geld</b> or danegeld and was a type of land-tax based on the hide or ploughland. Following the Norman Conquest, the <b>geld</b> was used {{to raise money for}} the King and to pay for continental wars; by 1130, the <b>geld</b> was being collected annually. Having determined the value of a manor's land and other assets, a tax of so many shillings and pence per pound of value would be levied on the land holder. While this was typically two shillings in the pound the amount did vary; for example, in 1084 it was as high as six shillings in the pound. For the manor at Leighton Bromswold the total tax assessed was 15 <b>geld.</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{land tax}} known as <b>geld</b> was first levied in 990 and this {{became known as}} the Danegeld, as it was used to buy off the Danes who were then raiding and invading the country. It was raised again for the same purpose on several occasions. The already {{existing}} system of assessment of land in hides was utilised to raise the <b>geld,</b> which was levied at a stated rate per hide (e.g. two shillings per hide). Subsequently the same system was used for general taxation and the <b>geld</b> was raised as required.|$|R
5|$|Purebred Arabians have {{excelled in}} open events against other breeds. One {{of the most}} famous {{examples}} in the field of western riding competition was the Arabian mare Ronteza, who defeated 50 horses of all breeds to win the 1961 Reined Cow Horse championship at the Cow Palace in San Francisco, California. Another Arabian competitive against all breeds was the stallion Aaraf who won an all-breed cutting horse competition at the Quarter Horse Congress in the 1950s. In show jumping and show hunter competition, a number of Arabians have competed successfully against other breeds in open competition, including the purebred <b>gelding</b> Russian Roulette, who has won multiple jumping classes against horses of all breeds on the open circuit, and in eventing, a purebred Arabian competed on the Brazilian team at the 2004 Athens Olympics.|$|E
5|$|Tizamazing {{is a full}} {{sister to}} Tiznow, who was 2000 American Horse of the Year and won the Breeders' Cup Classic twice. Tizamazing sold for $1million at Keeneland as a yearling, but owing to a {{training}} injury she never raced. Tizamazing's dam, Cee's Song, is credited with raising the respect breeders have for her female breeding line, Thoroughbred family 26, {{as one of the}} top distaff lines in America. Five full siblings out of Cee's Song were either race winners or the dams of race winners: Tiznow, Tizbud and Tizdubai are all stakes winners, Oxbow's dam Tizamazing and Paynter's dam Tizso both produced stakes winners. Another offspring of Cee's Song, the <b>gelding</b> Budroyale, was second in the 1999 Breeders' Cup Classic. Oxbow's pedigree is outcrossed for four generations, with very little inbreeding. Oxbow is only inbred 4x5x5 to Northern Dancer, meaning that this horse appears once in the fourth and twice in the fifth generation of Oxbow's pedigree.|$|E
5|$|Throughout her career, James {{won more}} World Barrel Racing Championships {{than any other}} {{competitor}} {{in the history of}} the sport. She is barrel racing’s all-time leading money earner, and the first person to surpass a million dollars in prize winnings. James earned national recognition after winning the WPRA World Barrel Racing Championship consecutively from 1984 to 1993 riding Gils Bay Boy, a 1977 American Quarter Horse Association (AQHA) <b>gelding</b> known by his nickname, Scamper, and again in 2002 on a horse named Cruiser. James and Scamper also won the NFR Barrel Racing Average Titles in 1984, 1986, 1987, 1989, 1990, 1993, and 2002. James qualified for the NFR 19 times with five different horses prior to her retirement in 2003, and was also a gold medalist at the 1988 Calgary Olympics Rodeo. James has a hall of fame career but could not be inducted into the ProRodeo Hall of Fame except into the Notables category until 2017. Starting with the 38th class of inductees in 2017, the ProRodeo Hall of Fame entered into a partnership with the WPRA to include barrel racers, and James was one of two barrel racers inducted.|$|E
