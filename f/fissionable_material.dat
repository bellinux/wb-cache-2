40|$|In {{nuclear power}} generation, fissile {{materials}} are mainly used. For example, $U^{ 235 }$ is fissile and therefore quite essential {{for use of}} nuclear energy. However, the material $U^{ 235 }$ has very small natural abundance less than 1 %. We should seek possibility of utilizing <b>fissionable</b> <b>materials</b> such as $U^{ 238 }$ because natural abundance of such <b>fissionable</b> <b>materials</b> is generally much larger than fissile ones. In this paper, we show that thermal neutrons with vanishing kinetic energy can induce nuclear fission when high voltage is applied to <b>fissionable</b> <b>materials.</b> To obtain this result, we use the liquid-drop model for nuclei. Finally, we propose how <b>fissionable</b> <b>materials</b> can be utilized. Comment: 11 page...|$|R

5|$|As {{a member}} of the Board of Consultants to a {{committee}} appointed by Truman, Oppenheimer strongly influenced the Acheson–Lilienthal Report. In this report, the committee advocated creation of an international Atomic Development Authority, which would own all <b>fissionable</b> <b>material</b> and the means of its production, such as mines and laboratories, and atomic power plants where it could be used for peaceful energy production. Bernard Baruch was appointed to translate this report into a proposal to the United Nations, resulting in the Baruch Plan of 1946. The Baruch Plan introduced many additional provisions regarding enforcement, in particular requiring inspection of the Soviet Union's uranium resources. The Baruch Plan was seen as an attempt to maintain the United States' nuclear monopoly and was rejected by the Soviets. With this, it became clear to Oppenheimer that an arms race was unavoidable, due to the mutual suspicion of the United States and the Soviet Union, which even Oppenheimer was starting to distrust.|$|E

5|$|Work on an {{alternative}} method of bomb design, known as implosion, had begun by Neddermeyer's E-5 (Implosion) group. Serber and Tolman had conceived implosion during the April 1943 conferences {{as a means}} of assembling pieces of <b>fissionable</b> <b>material</b> together to form a critical mass. Neddermeyer took a different tack, attempting to crush a hollow cylinder into a solid bar. The idea was to use explosives to crush a subcritical amount of fissile material into a smaller and denser form. When the fissile atoms are packed closer together, the rate of neutron capture increases, and they form a critical mass. The metal needs to travel only a very short distance, so the critical mass is assembled in much less time than it would take with the gun method. At the time, the idea of using explosives in this manner was quite novel. To facilitate the work, a small plant was established at the Anchor Ranch for casting explosive shapes.|$|E

The metal needs to travel only a very short distance, so the critical mass is assembled in much less time than it would take with the gun method. Neddermeyer's 1943 and early 1944 investigations into implosion showed promise, but also made it clear that the problem would be much more difficult from a theoretical and engineering perspective than the gun design. In September 1943, John von Neumann, who had experience with shaped charges used in armor-piercing shells, argued that not only would implosion reduce the danger of predetonation and fizzle, but would make more efficient use of the <b>fissionable</b> <b>material.</b> He proposed using a spherical configuration instead of the cylindrical one that Neddermeyer was working on.|$|E
25|$|Reactors used {{in nuclear}} marine {{propulsion}} (especially nuclear submarines) often cannot be run at continuous power {{around the clock}} {{in the same way}} that land-based power reactors are normally run, and in addition often need to have a very long core life without refueling. For this reason many designs use highly enriched uranium but incorporate burnable neutron poison in the fuel rods. This allows the reactor to be constructed with an excess of <b>fissionable</b> <b>material,</b> which is nevertheless made relatively safe early in the reactor's fuel burn-cycle by the presence of the neutron-absorbing material which is later replaced by normally produced long-lived neutron poisons (far longer-lived than xenon-135) which gradually accumulate over the fuel load's operating life.|$|E

500|$|The {{motivation}} {{behind the}} composite core {{was to make}} better use of the available <b>fissionable</b> <b>material.</b> The use of uranium-235 in an implosion weapon instead of the inefficient gun type Little Boy was an obvious development. However, while plutonium was more expensive and harder to produce than uranium-235, it fissions faster, because it makes better use of the neutrons its fission produces. On the other hand, the slower reaction of uranium-235 permits the assembly of super-critical masses, making it theoretically possible to produce weapons with high yields. By July 1945, Oppenheimer and Groves were considering [...] using both materials in a composite core containing [...] of plutonium and [...] of uranium-235. The composite cores became available in 1946. Los Alamos' priority then became {{the development of an}} all-uranium-235 core. By January 1948 the national stockpile contained 50 cores, of which 36 were composite Christy cores, nine were plutonium Christy cores, and five were composite levitated cores.
