We confirm a region of the intermediate-magnetization state between the Neel-like spin liquid state and the conventional ferrimagnetic state of Lieb-Mattis type. In the intermediate-state, {{we find that the}} spontaneous magnetization changes gradually with respect to the strength of the inner interaction. In addition, the local magnetization clearly shows an incommensurate modulation with long-distance periodicity in the intermediate-magnetization state. These characteristic behaviors lead {{to the conclusion that the}} intermediate-magnetization state is the non-Lieb-Mattis ferrimagnetic one. We also discuss the relationship between the ground-state properties of the S= 1 / 2 antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on the original Union Jack lattice and those on our strip lattice.

50|$|Jack's rakish ways {{made him}} a target of protests {{that he was a}} bad example for children, and after 1904 his strip was moved to the sports section, seen as a more adult and male area of the paper. It also ran less frequently, as Swinnerton focused on his new strip, the more popular Little Jimmy. Jack got a daily strip, The Escapades of Mr. Jack, which ran from 1912 until at least 1919. The latter date is given in some sources for Swinnerton's work, though Markstein notes that some later <b>strips</b> {{depicting}} <b>Jack</b> surreptitiously drinking alcohol behind the backs of police officers appear to date them to the Prohibition era of the 1920s. In 1926 Mr. <b>Jack's</b> <b>strip</b> became a topper above Little Jimmy and was toned down. It ran until 1935, when it was discontinued. Swinnerton continued to draw Little Jimmy until 1958, and died in 1974.|$|R

We gazed anxiously down at the spot where he had disappeared for nearly a minute, expecting every moment to see him rise again for breath; but fully a minute passed and still he did not reappear.

Chief NASCAR inspector Al Crisler disqualified Dunnaway's car because car owner Hubert Westmoreland had shored up the chassis by spreading the rear springs, a favorite bootlegger trick to improve traction and handling http://www.dailypress.com/sports/motorracing/dp-68984sy0mar17,0,4238057.story?coll=dp-auto-utility.

He also reveals that he abstained on the Scottish devolution referendum in 1979 with suggested occasional guilt pangs when he later befriends an independence advocate.

50|$|Harpsichords vary in {{size and}} shape, but {{all have the same}} basic mechanism. The player {{depresses}} a key that rocks over a pivot in the middle of its length. The other end of the key lifts a <b>jack</b> (a long <b>strip</b> of wood) that holds a small plectrum (a wedge-shaped piece of quill, often plastic in the 2010s), which plucks the string. When the player releases the key, the far end returns to its rest position, and the jack falls back. The plectrum, mounted on a tongue that can swivel backwards away from the string, passes the string without plucking it again. As the key reaches its rest position, a felt damper atop the jack stops the string's vibrations. These basic principles are explained in detail below.|$|R
50|$|In a harpsichord, {{the main}} part of the action is a <b>jack,</b> a {{vertical}} <b>strip</b> of wood seated on the far end of the key. At the top of the jack is mounted a hinged tongue bearing a plectrum. When the key is pressed and the jack rises, the plectrum plucks the string. When the key is released and the jack falls back down, the tongue permits the plectrum to retract slightly, so that it can return to its rest position without getting stuck or plucking the string again on the way down. The jack also bears a damper, whose purpose is to stop the vibration of the string when the key is released. For full description and diagrams, see Harpsichord.|$|R
