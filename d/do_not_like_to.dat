25|$|Like all fish, {{goldfish}} <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> be petted. In fact, {{touching a}} goldfish can endanger its health, {{because it can}} cause the protective slime coat to be damaged or removed, exposing the fish’s skin to infection from bacteria or water-born parasites. However, goldfish respond to people by surfacing at feeding time, and can be trained or acclimated to taking pellets or flakes from human fingers. The reputation of goldfish dying quickly is often due to poor care. The lifespan of goldfish in captivity can extend beyond 10 years.|$|E

But it is <b>not</b> human <b>to</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> be ridiculed, even when it {{comes in the form}} of a [...] "tribute." [...] I think a little psychologizing ought to have come in there. Something like this: A dog <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> be ridiculed, a redskin <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> be ridiculed, a negro <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> be ridiculed, a Chinaman <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> be ridiculed; let us deduce from these significant facts this formula: the American's grade being higher than these, and the chain-of argument stretching unbroken all the way up to him, there is room for suspicion that the person who said the American <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> be ridiculed, and regards it as a tribute, is not a capable observer.|$|R

25|$|During {{the process}} of {{drafting}} the plan, many residents expressed a desire for a national chain retailer or restaurant to be enticed to locate near or in downtown as a draw. The plan considers this ill-advised and unlikely to happen for several reasons. Chains <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> pioneer a new area, instead preferring to cluster with each other, and {{this leads to the}} development of large strip malls, impractical and undesirable in downtown Ossining, which still shows the scars of previous demolitions for urban renewal. Ossining as a whole is also geographically undesirable for chains, since not only is it neither affluent enough or accessible enough from major highways, the Hudson River cuts the potential trade area for such stores in half.|$|E
25|$|In {{fields and}} {{plantations}} of plants they <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> eat, e.g., cereals or eucalyptus, the greater rhea {{can be a}} species quite beneficial to farmers. It will eat any large invertebrate it can catch; its food includes locusts and grasshoppers, true bugs, cockroaches, and other pest insects. Juveniles eat more animal matter than adults. In mixed cerrado and agricultural land in Minas Gerais (Brazil), R. a. americana was noted to be particularly fond of beetles. It {{is not clear whether}} this applies to the species in general but for example in pampas habitat, beetle consumption is probably lower simply due to availability while Orthoptera might be more important. The greater rhea is able to eat Hymenoptera in quantity. These insects contain among them many who can give painful stings, though the birds do not seem to mind. Sometimes, greater rheas will gather at carrion to feed on flies; they are also known to eat dead or dying fish in the dry season, but as vertebrate prey in general not in large quantities.|$|E
500|$|On 2 February, Benfica {{played host to}} Boavista. They {{had several}} {{opportunities}} to beat William, but Boavista prevented them all. The match ended in a goalless draw, leaving Benfica one point away from the Estádio da Luz. Santos accepted the draw, saying, [...] "I <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> speak about luck or misfortune. The ball just would not go in. That is it." [...] Eight days later, Benfica travelled to Estádio do Varzim to play the sixth round of the Portuguese Cup against Segunda Liga-side Varzim. The hosts opened the score with an own goal from Nélson in the 13th minute, but Benfica equalizer with a goal from Simão at the half-hour mark. In the second half, Varzim pressed again and António Mendonça scored a match-winning 77th-minute goal. Benfica's elimination {{at the hands of}} Varzim was the third time in Santos' career he was knocked-out of the Portuguese Cup by a team from lower divisions, the other clubs being Porto and Sporting.|$|E

500|$|Though {{at times}} Hazlitt delighted in actors' interpretations of Shakespearean characters, {{and he thought}} some of Shakespeare's plays eminently suited for the stage, he opens the chapter on Hamlet by proclaiming, [...] "We <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> see our author's plays acted, and least of all, Hamlet". Here, more than {{anywhere}} else, he sides with Charles Lamb in believing Shakespeare's plays to suffer in stage presentation. Neither John Kemble nor his favourite actor Edmund Kean {{played the role of}} Hamlet to his satisfaction. [...] "Mr. Kean's Hamlet is as much too splenetic and rash as Mr. Kemble's is too deliberate and formal." [...] This, he felt, is a play to be read, and he noted that by his time it had already been so often read as to have become part of the common culture. [...] "This is that Hamlet the Dane, whom we read of in our youth". One might say, he observes, that Hamlet is just a character in a play: [...] "Hamlet is a name; his speeches and sayings but the idle coinage of the poet's brain." [...] Yet Shakespeare gives those sayings a reality {{in the mind of the}} reader, making them [...] "as real as our own thoughts." ...|$|E
500|$|The The Moving Picture World {{reviewer}} {{found the}} subject to be too long, but did not find {{it to be a}} fault. The reviewer states, [...] "A domestic comedy with a different flavor. In fact, with a mince pie for a basis the flavor comes to resemble brandy very strongly by the time that the cook, the maid and the mistress of the house and her daughter have added the proper proportion of flavoring, neither one knowing that the others have done likewise. The humor in this piece centers around this pie. What happened to the guests who partook of it certainly draws upon the imagination. Imagine eight people, not to speak of the cat, getting drunk on the brandy in one mince pie! ... We do not single out this subject as being more evidently padded than others shown on the screen this week. Licensed as well as Independents were guilty and it is time that the manufacturers realize the importance of the scenario end of matters. The mince pie episode was well done, which is the faint praise that we <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> mete out to anyone." [...] Walton of The Moving Picture News was not amused by the plot and stated, [...] "To me the last scene had no humor. It was only the necessary ending to the beginning. True humor does not emanate from cognac." [...] The New York Dramatic Mirror stated, [...] "This is the old story of too many cooks, and it is quite funny after the first scenes are out of the way. The early part of the film takes too much time with trivial details leading up to the final situation. ... A weak point in the story {{is the fact that the}} pie is cut into eight small pieces, making it difficult to believe in its remarkable power. Two pies would have been as easy to make as one and would have been more convincing. The character parts are all well taken, although the cook would have been better if she had not seized so many opportunities to talk directly at the camera." ...|$|E

2500|$|James Rachels {{writes that}} Charles Darwin's (1809–1882) On the Origin of Species (1859)—which {{presented}} {{the theory of}} evolution by natural selection—revolutionized the way humans viewed their relationship with other species. Not only did human beings have a direct kinship with other animals, but the latter had social, mental and moral lives too, Darwin argued. He wrote in his Notebooks (1837): [...] "Animals – whom we have made our slaves we <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> consider our equals. – Do not slave holders wish to make the black man other kind?" [...] Later, in The Descent of Man (1871), he argued that [...] "There is no fundamental difference between man and the higher mammals in their mental faculties", attributing to animals the power of reason, decision making, memory, sympathy, and imagination.|$|E

[...] The expectation of finding [...] "the father of mankind" [...] was comparable to finding Macrauchenia, and [...] "if we choose to let conjecture run wild then our animals our fellow brethern in pain, disease, death & suffering, & famine, our slaves in the most laborious works, our companions in our amusements. they may partake from our origin in one common ancestor; we may be all netted together." ...|$|E

2500|$|The tests {{demonstrated}} {{that the type of}} engine [...] "could be developed into an automotive power train for passenger vehicles and that it could produce favorable results." [...] However, progress was achieved with equal-power spark-ignition engines since 1977, and the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) achieved by automobiles in the U.S. did not stand still. The Stirling engine still showed a shortfall in fuel efficiency and concerns about the ability to mass-produce it. There were also two things wrong with Stirling engine power: first was the time needed to warm up (because most drivers <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> wait to start driving), and second was the difficulty in changing the engine's speed (thus limiting flexibility when driving). A 1980 AMC Concord was also fitted with a P-40 engine and used to inform the public about the Stirling engine and the ASE program.|$|E
2500|$|There were {{questions}} raised {{as to the}} accuracy of the information and the evidence used in the trial. Dr. Elaine Samuels, the medical examiner who conducted the autopsy, had originally concluded that hairs recovered from the body were consistent with that of the victim; after Dr. Samuels had come to that conclusion, the hair evidence was examined by Diane Hanson, a hair analyst from a crime lab in Madison, Wisconsin. Hanson stated that two of the hairs were consistent with samples taken from Laurie Bembenek's hairbrush. Dr. Samuels refuted that claim, stating in a 1983 letter, quoted in the Toronto Star in 1991, that [...] "I recovered no blonde or red hairs of any length or texture ... ll of the hairs I recovered from the body were brown and were grossly identical to the hair of the victim ... <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> suggest that evidence was altered in any way, but I can find no logical explanation for what amounted to the mysterious appearance of blonde hair in an envelope that contained no such hair {{at the time it was}} sealed by me." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Shar Pei {{is often}} {{suspicious}} of strangers, which pertains to their origin as a guard dog. It {{is a very}} independent and reserved breed. Nevertheless, the Shar Pei is extremely devoted, loyal and affectionate to its family and is amenable to accepting strangers given time and proper introduction at a young age. If poorly socialized or trained, it can become especially territorial and aggressive. Even friendly and well-socialized individuals will retain the breed's watch dog proclivities (like barking at strangers). It is a largely silent breed, barking only when it is playing or worried. The Shar-Pei were originally bred as palace guards in China. Although Shar-Pei are sometimes stubborn, they are receptive to fair, compassionate training. With repetition and a clear reward system, training is not very difficult, however they do not respond well to negative and cruel treatment. The Shar Pei can be a dog that is loyal and loving to its family while being very protective. Shar-Pei <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> be alone, preferring {{to be close to}} their humans, often lying nearby in the same room.|$|E

2500|$|La Russa {{says it is}} {{important}} that relievers know their roles and the situations which they will be called into a game. He added, [...] "Sure, games can get away from you in the seventh and eighth, but those last three outs in the ninth are the toughest. You want the guy who can handle that pressure. That, to me, is most important." [...] Oakland general manager Billy Beane said there would be too much media criticism if a pitcher other than the closer lost the game in the ninth." [...] Managerial moves are immediately questioned with millions of fans having access to ESPN, the MLB Network, and other cable channels. Former manager Jim Fregosi said managers <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> be second-guessed. [...] "Even if you know the odds, it's more comfortable being wrong {{when you go to the}} closer", said Beane. [...] He noted the incremental increase gained by a closer in a three-run save situation [...] "is worth it because losing is so painful in that situation." [...] Baseball announcer Chris Wheeler noted that there is pressure on managers to pitch closers in the ninth inning when they were paid big money to pitch in that role. Former general manager Pat Gillick said closers become one-inning pitchers as managers began copying the practice of having setup pitchers enter before closers. [...] "There are just too many specialists, guys who can only pitch one inning and only pitch certain innings and throw only 20 pitches. I think most pitchers are capable of pitching more", said Gillick.|$|E
2500|$|Creighton is {{considered}} {{to be one of the}} first British historians with a distinctly European outlook. [...] Of his magnum opus, History of the Papacy in the Period of the Reformation, R. J. W. Evans writes, [...] "(It) constitutes one of the first great attempts to introduce the British to explicitly modern [...] and European history." [...] Overall, Creighton and his peers, left a heterogeneous legacy. [...] On the one hand, Creighton was a painstakingly balanced scholar; even his critic Lord Acton would use [...] "sovereign impartiality" [...] to describe Creighton's strength. [...] Creighton saw himself as someone interested in actions, in contrast to Acton, whom he considered to be interested in ideas. [...] Although Creighton did not personally consider the popes to be guiltless (for example, amidst writing the third papacy volume, he wrote, in a letter to a friend, that working on the Borgias was like [...] "spending one's day in a low police court"), Creighton was emphatic that public men be judged for their public and not private actions. [...] In an essay, [...] "Historical ethics", published after his death, he wrote, [...] "I like to stand upon clear grounds which can be proved and estimated. [...] I <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> wrap myself in the garb of outraged dignity because men in the past did things contrary to the principles which I think soundest in the present." [...] On the other hand, Creighton's historical outlook, as well as that of his historian peers, bore the cultural and social stamp of their position. [...] According to historians Robert Harrison, Aled Jones, and Peter Lambert, [...] "Their emphasis on the Englishness of Britain's key institutions, for instance, effectively excluded non-English ethnic groups from the 'chief part,' as Creighton had put it, of history's subject." ...|$|E
