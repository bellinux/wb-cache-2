500|$|Elliott {{was also}} the one who hired Hayden Fry as Iowa's {{football}} coach in 1979. [...] Fry later said that Elliott {{was one of the}} principal reasons he chose to coach at Iowa.

[...] Bump had a reputation as being a fair, honest and well-liked administrator." [...] Elliott told Fry that he would be the last football coach Bump ever hired. [...] Fry was puzzled and asked Elliott what he meant. [...] Elliott said, [...] "Simple, I don’t think they’ll <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> hire another coach, so if you don’t make it, neither will I." [...] He is the only person to have been with Rose Bowl teams in five capacities – player, assistant coach, head coach, assistant athletic director, and athletic director.|$|E
