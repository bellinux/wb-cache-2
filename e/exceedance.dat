25|$|Figure 4 {{illustrates}} the situation forn=3. Each of the 20 possible monotonic paths appears {{somewhere in the}} table. The first column shows all paths of <b>exceedance</b> three, which lie entirely above the diagonal. The columns to the right show the result of successive applications of the algorithm, with the <b>exceedance</b> decreasing one unit at a time. There are five rows, that is,C3=5.|$|E
25|$|Notice {{that the}} <b>exceedance</b> {{has dropped from}} three to two. In fact, the {{algorithm}} will cause the <b>exceedance</b> to decrease by one, for any path that we feed it, because the first vertical step starting on the diagonal (at the point marked with a black dot) is the unique vertical edge that under the operation passes from above the diagonal to below it; all other vertical edges stay {{on the same side}} of the diagonal.|$|E
25|$|It is {{also not}} {{difficult}} {{to see that this}} process is reversible: given any path P whose <b>exceedance</b> is less than n, there is exactly one path which yields P when the algorithm is applied to it. Indeed, the (black) edge X, which originally was the first horizontal step ending on the diagonal, has become the last horizontal step starting on the diagonal.|$|E
30|$|<b>Exceedances</b> in Swiss {{surface waters}} were mainly {{determined}} for herbicides and fungicides; {{for only one}} insecticide, chlorpyrifos-methyl, the RAC was exceeded (Fig.  1). For the fungicide prochloraz, {{the highest number of}} <b>exceedances</b> was found to be up to 1.7  % of all and 2.1  % of measurements in FLOZ 1 – 3 (Fig.  1) although the use rates in Switzerland in comparison to the other pesticides with <b>exceedances</b> were low during the years of monitoring. If the extent of <b>exceedances</b> is calculated (RQ = MECmax > RAC), in most cases the RQ was less than 5 (Table  1) indicating a limited risk due to pesticides in smaller water bodies.|$|R
30|$|EU <b>exceedances</b> of SOMO 35 are common, {{particularly}} in southern Europe. <b>Exceedances</b> of the UK standards are also common.

For 2016, there were 253 UK <b>exceedances</b> (where ozone exceeded 100  μg/m 3 (50 ppbv) for 8 -h more than 10 times). Usually the maximum UK concentrations {{are up to}} around 200 – 300  μg/m 3 (100 – 150 ppbv).

2500|$|The {{committee}} {{investigating the}} crash were {{satisfied that the}} destructive error in 1989 was not relevant to the 1994 crash. Information provided from Boeing to the investigation led to the following conclusion regarding FADEC performance: [...] "Data from the Digital Electronics Unit (DECU) of the second engine showed no evidence of torque or temperature <b>exceedance</b> and the matched power conditions of the engines post-impact indicate {{that there was no}} sustained emergency power demand. No other evidence indicated any FADEC or engine faults." [...] It was expected that in a FADEC engine runaway, engine power would become asynchronous and mismatched.

40|$|Abstract. We {{prove that}} the {{distributional}} limit of the normalised number of returns to small neighbourhoods of periodic points of certain non-uniformly hyperbolic dynamical systems is compound Poisson. The returns to small balls around a fixed point in the phase space correspond to the occurrence of rare events, or <b>exceedances</b> of high thresholds, {{so that there is}} a connection between the laws of Return Times Statistics and Extreme Value Laws. The fact that the fixed point in the phase space is a repelling periodic point implies that there is a tendency for the <b>exceedances</b> to appear in clusters whose average sizes is given by the Extremal Index, which depends on the expansion of the system at the periodic point. We recall that for generic points, the <b>exceedances,</b> in the limit, are singular and occur at Poisson times. However, around periodic points, the picture is different: the respective point processes of <b>exceedances</b> converge to a compound Poisson process, so instead of sin-gle <b>exceedances,</b> we have entire clusters of <b>exceedances</b> occurring at Poisson times with a geometric distribution ruling its multiplicity. The systems to which our results apply include: general piecewise expanding maps of the interval (Rychlik maps), maps with indifferent fixed points (Manneville-Pomeau maps) and Benedicks-Carleson quadratic maps. 1...|$|R

50|$|Calculating {{critical}} load functions and target load functions include several simplifications {{and thus can}} be viewed as a risk concept: The higher the <b>exceedance</b> the higher the risk for adverse effects and there is a certain risk that zero <b>exceedance</b> will still lead to adverse effects.|$|E
50|$|The {{frequency}} of <b>exceedance</b> {{is the number}} of times a stochastic process exceeds some critical value, usually a critical value far from the process' mean, per unit time. Counting <b>exceedance</b> of the critical value can be accomplished either by counting peaks of the process that exceed the critical value or by counting upcrossings of the critical value, where an upcrossing is an event where the instantaneous value of the process crosses the critical value with positive slope. This article assumes the two methods of counting <b>exceedance</b> are equivalent and that the process has one upcrossing and one peak per <b>exceedance.</b> However, processes, especially continuous processes with high frequency components to their power spectral densities, may have multiple upcrossings or multiple peaks in rapid succession before the process reverts to its mean.|$|E
