40|$|Thermal energy {{consumption}} in buildings with chilled or hot water distribution systems is often monitored through <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> {{some type of}} flow metering device. These flowmeters can be fixed types, such as venturis or orifices, or insertion flowmeters which can be more easily installed and removed. The easy removal and reinstallation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> insertion type flowmeters makes them good choices for use in existing buildings or in retrofit projects. Besides the installation benefits, insertion flowmeters can also be installed while the pipe is in service or ''hot tapped". With any type flowmeter however, location in the pipe is a critical problem and deserves special consideration. Ideally, <b>the</b> <b>meter</b> should be inserted in existing pipe {{with a minimum of}} 10 to 15 diameters of straight pipe upstream <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>meter</b> location. This is rarely the case in existing piping distribution systems. It is much more common to be faced with only one or two candidate metering locations and these often are very short straight runs or will have elbows upstream and <b>downstream</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> proposed <b>metering</b> location. This paper reports on flow measurement error resulting from an insertion flowmeter installed <b>downstream</b> <b>of</b> a 90 ? elbow. The measurement errors were compared for tests conducted in 4. 0 and 6. 0 inch (0. 1 and 0. 15 meter) diameter PVC pipe. The insertion flowmeter was a nonmagnetic, tangential paddle wheel type. The flowmeter was located from 2 to 10 pipe diameters downstream fiom a 90 ? elbow with fluid velocities ranging from 1. 0 to 10. 0 ft/s (0. 3 to 3. 0 m/s). At each flowmeter location, <b>the</b> <b>meter</b> was rotated in 45 ? increments around <b>the</b> circumference <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pipe to quantify <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> circumferential location on flow error.
