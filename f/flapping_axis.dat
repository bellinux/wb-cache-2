40|$|This study {{addresses}} the aerodynamics of elastic membrane flapping wings. Several {{applications of the}} actuator disk theory to the flapping wings of insects and birds are reviewed. In previous studies, to account for spatial and temporal variance in the wake behind the flapping wings, empirical corrections were proposed for the induced velocity and power. In the present paper, a new procedure for determination of the correction factor is proposed, using membrane-type flapping-wing devices. Wind-tunnel experiments were conducted and the stroke-averaged propulsive thrust was measured on 25 -cm-wingspan (flat and 9 % camber) and 74 -cm-wingspan flapping-wing models. Either flapping frequency or input power was held constant during the tests. Obtained thrust forces were compared to theoretical values predicted by the actuator disk theory. Empirical correction factors to the actuator disk theory were determined, providing a best fit to the experimental data when the <b>flapping</b> <b>axis</b> aligned with freestream velocity. It is noteworthy that the numerical value for the correction factor for the 25 cm cambered wing agrees with {{the results obtained on}} large insects. The theoretical corrections for angle of attack of the flapping wing give satisfactory agreements with the experimental data only for relatively low forward speeds.

40|$|Background: Reconstructive surgery {{has entered}} a "perforator flap era" with more {{surgeons}} performing successful perforator flap procedures. The perforator-based island flap {{is an extension}} of this perforator concept {{and one of the most}} successful. In perforator-rich or -reliable areas, this allows for primary closure of the donor site and the construction of highly customized flaps with little tissue waste. Methods: The authors present a design modification of the perforator-based island flap used in 73 patients who underwent heart balloon perforator-based island flap reconstruction between 2008 and 2012. Results: There were no reported cases of total flap necrosis. Marginal necrosis of the flap was noted in three cases, which resolved with simple dressings. The donor sites were closed primarily in all cases. Conclusions: The heart balloon perforator-based island flap enables tension-free closure of the donor site, reduces donor-site complications, and minimizes tissue waste. The resulting shape resembles a heart and gives rise to the flap&# 39;s name. Key principles for success are perforators close to the defect, a <b>flap</b> <b>axis</b> that allows for primary donor-site closure, flap border adjacent to the defect that is smaller than the postresection defect, flap harvest until an adequate arc of rotation is obtained, primary closure of the donor site before flap inset, and preservation of a triangular area between the proximal apex of the flap and the defect...|$|R
40|$|Background: As {{experience}} with vascularized lymph node (VLN) transfer has grown, new VLN sources have become apparent. Descriptive studies have elucidated variable lymph node presence in these donor basins. Yet, no study has evaluated preoperative imaging evaluation between donor sites in patients undergoing VLN transfer. This {{study was to}} compare the findings on duplex ultrasonography of the submental, groin, and supraclavicular lymph node basins in patients undergoing VLN transfer. Methods: A review of a prospective database was performed for patients who had undergone preoperative planning for VLN transfer with duplex ultrasonography to provide objective donor-site characteristics. Multiple regression {{analysis was used to}} identify factors that correlated with specific flap characteristics. A P value less than 0. 05 was considered statistically significant. Results: Sixty-eight patients (28 upper extremities and 40 lower extremities) were identified as undergoing preoperative duplex ultrasonography for VLN transfer. Little variation was seen when evaluating donor sites for laterality in patients. Groin and submental VLN sites had 3. 1 and 3. 3 lymph nodes, respectively, compared with 0. 9 lymph nodes in the supraclavicular donor site (p < 0. 01). Increasing age had an inverse relationship with estimated flap volume, whereas higher body mass index correlated with increasing flap thickness. Conclusions: Preoperative imaging with duplex ultrasonography before VLN transfer may allow for accurate identification of specific VLN donor-site characteristics. When considering lymph node–specific characteristics, higher quantity of lymph nodes were found on the groin and submental <b>flap</b> <b>axis</b> compared with the transverse cervical artery axis...|$|R

The subscapular vascular axis offers {{a source of}} skin, bone, and muscle on a single pedicle for microvascular flap transfer. We reviewed four cases where the subscapular vascular pedicle {{was used as a}} source of tissue for complex facial reconstructions in maxillofacial defects. Reconstruction of these complex defects was performed with a latissimus dorsi muscle or myocutaneous flap in combination with the lateral border of the scapula, harvested on the angular branch of the thoracodorsal vessels. There were three cases of maxillectomy and one case of partial mandibulectomy for malignant tumors. In each case, the angular branch of the thoracodorsal artery supplied 6 to 8 cm of the lateral border of the scapula and a latissimus dorsi myocutaneous flap was used for soft tissue reconstruction. Follow-up ranged from 9 months to 3 years and in all cases there was successful bony union. Shoulder movement was normal. This series encourages the further use of subscapular <b>axis</b> <b>flaps</b> as flexible sources of combined myocutaneous and osseous flaps on a single vascular pedicle in cases of complex maxillofacial reconstruction.

40|$|Several {{issues in}} {{numerical}} modeling and simulations of turbulent premixed flames are {{addressed in this}} thesis. In {{the first part of}} this study, the reaction progress variable and flame surface density combustion models are extended for nonisenthalpic premixed flames. The performance of five state-of-the-art premixed combustion models is evaluated for two premixed jet flames using the boundary layer approximation. Overall, the proposed modification gives good predictions of mean temperature and axial velocity profiles for nonisenthalpic jet flames. ^ In the second part of this study, results from direct numerical simulations (DNS) are used to develop and assess filtered reaction rate models. A model based on the reaction progress variable approach, traditionally used in time-averaged calculations, is proposed as a subgrid combustion model for large eddy simulations (LES). Both a priori and a posteriori studies show that the new model gives excellent results. Four different subgrid turbulence models are also studied to evaluate their accuracy in predicting the transitional jet flames. ^ The reaction progress variable based subgrid combustion model is implemented in the commercial CFD code FLUENT/UNS. Using this code, LES of lean premixed combustion in an axisymmetric dump combustor are conducted. Cold flow simulations of this combustor give excellent predictions of mean and radial velocity compared to the experimental data. The reacting flow simulations also give good predictions of mean axial velocity and intensity of axial velocity fluctuations. The 3 D LES has shown the large scale, asymmetric, flame front <b>flapping</b> about the <b>axis</b> of the combustor. ...|$|R
30|$|Reconstruction of {{soft tissue}} defects {{of the foot}} and the lower third of the leg remains a {{challenge}} for trauma and reconstructive surgeons due to poor vascularization and, often, exposure of the calcaneus bone and Achilles tendon. Obtaining weight-bearing repair of these defects requires large flaps with an abundant blood supply and successful anti-infection measures. Ideally, these flaps would fill the dead space and act as a “buffer layer,” accelerating healing. These flaps must be durable, allow a certain range of motion, have a satisfactory shape, retain sensation at the recipient site without loss of the main vessels, and require minimal sacrifice at the donor site. Management options include microsurgical free-flap transfers and pedicled muscle flaps among others, with each method having its own advantages and disadvantages. Masquelet et al. [1] first developed the concept of neurocutaneous island flaps based on the cutaneous branches of the vascular axis around a superficial sensory nerve. The distally based flap pedicled with the vascular plexus surrounding the sural nerve has been widely used to fill lower leg, ankle, or foot defects [2 – 12]. However, the core gradients of these <b>flaps,</b> the vascular <b>axis</b> of the sural nerve and/or the lesser saphenous vein, were poorly understood. We performed an anatomical study to investigate {{the origin of the}} blood supply, the vascular anatomy, the superficial and deep communicating branches between the sural nerve and the lesser saphenous vein, and the feasibility of applying reversed flaps pedicled with the nutrient vessel of the lesser saphenous vein and the lateral sural nerve for the repair of soft tissue defects of the lower leg and foot.|$|R
40|$|Flapping wings can pitch passively {{about their}} {{pitching}} axes {{due to their}} flexibility, inertia, and aerodynamic loads. A shift in the pitching axis location can dynamically alter the aerodynamic loads, which in turn changes the passive pitching motion and the flight efficiency. Therefore, it is {{of great interest to}} investigate the optimal pitching <b>axis</b> for <b>flapping</b> wings to maximize the power efficiency during hovering flight. In this study, flapping wings are modeled as rigid plates with non-uniform mass distribution. The wing flexibility is represented by a linearly torsional spring at the wing root. A predictive quasi-steady aerodynamic model is used to evaluate the lift generated by such wings. Two extreme power consumption scenarios are modeled for hovering flight, i. e. the power consumed by a drive system with and without the capacity of kinetic energy recovery. For wings with different shapes, the optimal pitching axis location is found such that the cycle-averaged power consumption during hovering flight is minimized. Optimization results show that the optimal pitching axis is located between the leading edge and the mid-chord line, which shows close resemblance to insect wings. An optimal pitching axis can save up to 33 % of power during hovering flight when compared to traditional wings used by most of flapping wing micro air vehicles (FWMAVs). Traditional wings typically use the straight leading edge as the pitching axis. With the optimized pitching <b>axis,</b> <b>flapping</b> wings show higher pitching amplitudes and start the pitching reversals in advance of the sweeping reversals. These phenomena lead to higher lift-to-drag ratios and, thus, explain the lower power consumption. In addition, the optimized pitching axis provides the drive system higher potential to recycle energy during the deceleration phases as compared to their counterparts. This observation underlines the particular importance of the wing pitching axis location for energy-efficient FWMAVs when using kinetic energy recovery drive systems.

40|$|The {{three-dimensional}} {{behavior of}} jet core breakdown is investigated with experiments conducted on a free water jet at Re = 5000 by time-resolved tomographic particle image velocimetry (TR-TOMO PIV). The investigated domain encompasses the range between 0 and 10 jet diameters. The characteristic pulsatile motion of vortex ring shedding and pairing culminates {{with the growth}} of four primary in-plane and out-of-plane azimuthal waves and leads to the formation of streamwise vortices. Vortex ring humps are tilted and ejected along the axial direction as they are subjected to higher axial velocities. By the end of the potential core, this process causes the breakdown of the vortex ring regime and the onset of streamwise filaments oriented at 30 °- 45 ° to the jet axis and “C” shaped peripheral structures. The latter re-organize further downstream in filaments oriented along the azimuthal direction at the jet periphery. Instead, {{in the vicinity of the}} jet axis the filaments do not exhibit any preferential direction resembling the isotropic turbulent regime. Following Powell's aeroacoustic analogy, the instantaneous spatial distribution of the acoustic source term is mapped by the second time derivative of the Lamb vector, revealing the highest activity during vortex ring breakdown. A three-dimensional modal analysis of velocity, vorticity, Lamb vector, and Lamb vector second time derivative fields is conducted by proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) within the first 10 modes. The decomposed velocity fluctuations describe a helical organization in the region of the jet core-breakdown and, further downstream, jet <b>axis</b> <b>flapping</b> and precession motions. By the end of the potential core, vorticity modes show that vortex rings are dominated by travelling waves of radial and axial vorticity with a characteristic 40 °- 45 ° inclination to the jet axis. The Lamb vector and the Lamb vector second time derivative modes exhibit similar patterns for the azimuthal component, whereas the vortex ring coherence is described by the radial and the axial components. While velocity, vorticity, and Lamb vector modes are typically associated with Strouhal numbers (St) smaller than 0. 9, the modes of the Lamb vector second time derivative are also related to higher frequencies (1. 05 ? St ? 1. 9) ascribed to the three-dimensional travelling waves. Far-field acoustic predictions are obtained on the basis of direct evaluation of Powell's analogy with TR-TOMO PIV data. The spectral analysis returns peaks at pairing (St = 0. 36) and shedding (St = 0. 72) frequency. A broader distribution with a hump between St = 1 and 2. 25 is observed, which corresponds to the breakdown of ring vortices. Aerodynamics, Wind Energy & PropulsionAerospace Engineerin...|$|R
