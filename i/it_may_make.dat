5|$|Any {{married person}} who alleges that {{reasonable}} grounds exist for supposing {{that the other}} party to the marriage is dead may apply to court to have it presumed that the other party is dead {{and to have the}} marriage dissolved. If the court is satisfied that such reasonable grounds exist, <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>make</b> an interim judgment of presumption of death and of divorce. In such proceedings, the fact that for seven years or more the other party to the marriage has been continually absent from the applicant, and the applicant has {{no reason to believe that}} the other party has been living within that time, is evidence that the missing person is dead until the contrary is proved.|$|E

25|$|Tableaux with {{unification}} can {{be proved}} complete: if {{a set of}} formulae is unsatisfiable, it has a tableau-with-unification proof. However, actually finding such a proof may be a difficult problem. Contrarily to the case without unification, applying a substitution can modify the existing part of a tableau; while applying a substitution closes at least a branch, <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>make</b> other branches impossible to close (even if the set is unsatisfiable).|$|E
25|$|One {{study has}} {{suggested}} that infrasound may cause feelings of awe or fear in humans. It has also been suggested that since it is not consciously perceived, <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>make</b> people feel vaguely that odd or supernatural events are taking place. Engineer Vic Tandy provided such an explanation in his investigations in the 1980s. Tandy, while working in his laboratory, started to feel uneasy and as if a supernatural presence was with him. Later, he could attribute these feelings to a broken metal fan that was causing noises of a frequency that triggered them. The noise could not be perceived by the human ear, but Tandy's body reacted to the 19Hz sounds.|$|E

500|$|Can't Be Tamed is {{primarily}} a dance-pop record; it contains [...] "several bass-heavy, slickly produced dance numbers" [...] that Ann Donahue from Billboard joked [...] "thunder in such a catchy, accessible way that <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>make</b> Kesha down another bottle of Jack out of envy." [...] Its opening track [...] "Liberty Walk" [...] describes an individual who leaves a harmful relationship, which Cyrus felt leaned towards more meaningful lyrical content instead of the [...] "super shallow" [...] current mainstream music. [...] "Who Owns My Heart" [...] details the excitement in possibly finding a lover at a nightclub, while Cyrus herself commented that the title track [...] "Can't Be Tamed" [...] bears a theme of [...] "breaking out and feeling free." [...] It {{is followed by a}} cover version of [...] "Every Rose Has Its Thorn", originally performed by the band Poison for their second studio album Open Up and Say... Ahh! (1988); she stated that the modern-day music industry [...] "shelters kids [...] songs as honest and real as this one", and added that a consultation with the band's lead singer Bret Michaels helped her to incorporate her [...] "own flare and edge".|$|E
500|$|Another {{aspect of}} the show that was widely {{discussed}} among commentators was the moral dilemma presented in the episode between a pragmatic approach to ruling or remaining true to the ideals of justice and honor, exemplified in the scene where Eddard summons Tywin Lannister to the court to answer for the crimes of his bannerman Gregor Clegane. Poniewozik states that Eddard [...] "doesn't seem to consider that he has options: he is left to rule in the king's place, an injustice has been committed, the law requires one path to justice and he chooses it. This makes his decision easy, but <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>make</b> his life, and others', difficult." [...] According to The Atlantics Scott Meslow, [...] "Ned's principles are, as always, admirable, and he's clearly interested in justice. But the sad {{truth is that the}} lack of guile that makes him honorable also makes him a pretty poor king. It's a terrible idea to order the arrest of the man who is single-handedly financing your kingdom." [...] Myles McNutt, writing for Cultural Learnings, agreed with Meslow and concluded that [...] "the only thing more dangerous than a reckless man asserting their [...] power in Westeros is an honorable man doing the same, as it threatens the delicate framework which has propped up King Robert for so long." ...|$|E

It occupies varied habitats, usually including at least scattered trees; it prefers humid regions to arid ones and tends to avoid closed forest. It is generally not migratory, though in some areas <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>make</b> seasonal movements.|$|E
2500|$|Because domes are concave from below, {{they can}} reflect sound and create echoes. A dome {{may have a}} [...] "whispering gallery" [...] at its base that at certain places transmits {{distinct}} sound to other distant places in the gallery. The half-domes over the apses of Byzantine churches helped to project the chants of the clergy. Although this can complement music, <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>make</b> speech less intelligible, leading Francesco Giorgi in 1535 to recommend vaulted ceilings for the choir areas of a church, but a flat ceiling filled with as many coffers as possible for where preaching would occur.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{there are}} a number of game {{situations}} in which <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>make</b> sense for a defense to commit an isolated intentional foul, from its inception, the strategy of intentional fouling repeatedly, on each and every possession by the opposition, was used only as a desperation measure. [...] It was thought to make sense only when time was so short in the game, that a team trailing in the game, when they were on defense, had to make stopping the clock an even greater priority than stopping the other team from scoring. [...] The strategy was not thought to make sense at most other times because allowing a team to shoot free throws typically will generate more points for them over time than does playing a standard defense.|$|E

As explained in the Form 1023, these facilities will provide classes for Israelis and Palestinians in peaceful cooperation to develop their vocational, artistic and other skills. Vocational trainings may include professional training workshops to teach locals the fundamentals of various trades such as carpentry, blacksmithing, plumbing, traditional and modern baking techniques, food service, computer science, textiles and sewing, ceramics, photography, newspaper production, and theater. IPCEE will either provide funds to build, furnish, equip and staff these facilities or share the costs with other non -governmental organizations (NGOs.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Digital {{phase locked}} loops can be {{implemented}} in hardware, using integrated circuits such as a CMOS 4046. [...] However, with microcontrollers becoming faster, <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>make</b> sense to implement a phase locked loop in software for applications {{that do not require}} locking onto signals in the MHz range or faster, such as precisely controlling motor speeds. [...] Software implementation has several advantages including easy customization of the feedback loop including changing the multiplication or division ratio between the signal being tracked and the output oscillator. [...] Furthermore, a software implementation is useful to understand and experiment with. [...] As an example of a phase-locked loop implemented using a phase frequency detector is presented in MATLAB, as this type of phase detector is robust and easy to implement. [...] This example uses integer arithmetic rather than floating point, as such an example is likely more useful in practice.|$|E
2500|$|Adele Reinhartz {{writes that}} the [...] "depth of Jules's transformation" [...] is {{indicated}} by the difference in his two deliveries of the passage: [...] "In the first, he is a majestic and awe-inspiring figure, proclaiming the prophecy with fury and self-righteousness... In the second... {{he appears to be}} a different sort of man altogether... n true postmodern fashion, [...] reflects on the meaning of his speech and provides several different ways that it might pertain to his current situation." [...] Similar to Gormley, Conard argues that as Jules reflects on the passage, it dawns on him [...] "that it refers to an objective framework of value and meaning that is absent from his life"; to Conard, this contrasts with the film's prevalent representation of a nihilistic culture. Rosenbaum finds much less in Jules's revelation: [...] "he spiritual awakening at the end of Pulp Fiction, which Jackson performs beautifully, is a piece of jive avowedly inspired by kung-fu movies. <b>It</b> <b>may</b> <b>make</b> you feel good, but it certainly doesn't leave you any wiser." ...|$|E

October 2016 network tests by Cellular Insights showed that models A1660 and A1661 with Qualcomm modems had [...] "a significant performance edge" [...] over models A1778 and A1784 with Intel modems. Inspection of the modems {{also found that the}} Qualcomm version's ability to use Ultra HD Voice had been turned off, likely to [...] "level the playing field between the Qualcomm, and Intel variants". The report concluded with the statement that [...] "We are not sure what was the main reason behind Apple's decision to source two different modem suppliers for the newest iPhone." [...] Bloomberg {{reported in}} November 2016 that tests by researchers from Twin Prime and Cellular Insights had shown the two modems to perform similarly on some U.S. cellular networks despite one of the modems being technically capable of faster connectivity. Apple spokeswoman Trudy Muller told the publication that [...] "Every iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus meets or exceeds all of Appleâ€™s wireless performance standards, quality metrics, and reliability testing ... In all of our rigorous lab tests based on wireless industry standards, in thousands of hours of real-world field testing, and in extensive carrier partner testing, the data shows there is no discernible difference in the wireless performance of any of the models". Bloomberg quoted analysts and technology advisers who stated that [...] " [...] donâ€™t want one version to get the reputation that it is better" [...] and that [...] "This may not impact the fanboys, but <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>make</b> other consumers think twice about buying an Apple phone, especially if they think they might be purchasing a sub-standard product".|$|E
