40|$|The {{research}} goal of {{this thesis}} is to examine various aramid fabrics {{with regard to their}} stabbing behaviour and to find influencing factors to this. An attack can only be inhibited, but an injury cannot be completely prevented. The goal is always to absorb as much energy as possible, so that the penetration is thus reduced and the risk of injury decreases. The stab mechanism is a complex and variable process. The review showed the demand on research in this area, because the most solutions involve <b>hard</b> <b>body</b> <b>armour</b> parts in combination with fibrous materials. This material combinations show many disadvantages with regards to the high weight and the missing flexibility. Other researchers also recommend textile solutions, because they are flexible and in the field of ballistic panels they are already used. The investigations carried out within this thesis are done to {{contribute to the development of}} pure textile stab-resistant panels. Therefore the interdependencies between the physical properties of the material but also the mechanism during a stab attack have to be recognized, to developed higher protection levels. It was shown, that the multitude of factors causes the problem to define a level of protection. General investigations were done to analyse the test parameters, which are defined in the test standard but also this one, which are missing...|$|E
40|$|Depth, {{diameter}} and volume of dents in clay backing of soft and <b>hard</b> <b>body</b> <b>armour</b> {{are used to}} assess the protective performance of such vests. The characteristics of the dents are traditionally measured manually. Optical scan techniques are becoming more popular and provide an objective method compared to the manual method and it allows to archive the scans for later evaluation. However, commercial high end scanners, accuracy in 1 - 10 μm, are expensive and there is no software available to automatically determine the dent characteristics. Recently low end scanners, accuracy 0. 1 - 0. 5 mm became available. An automatic dent measuring method was developed using Matlab to control a DAVID 3 Structured Ligth Scanner and process the scans of the clay backing to obtain the dent characteristics. This SLS dent scan system is presented in this paper. Accuracy of the scans is better than the most strict requirement of 0. 5 mm. Scan and processing time to obtain the dent characteristics is less than sixty seconds. The traditional method takes about two minutes between each shot. The accuracy and precision is evaluated by comparison of the SLS scan method with a measurement of a dent by a high end but much slower scanner (accuracy < 0. 05 mm). A comparison between the manual and SLS method is made by measuring dents for three clay trays with each five calibration dents and for a soft and hard armour BABT performance assessment. It is concluded that the accuracy of the SLS method is better than or equal to the manual method...|$|E
40|$|The {{wearing of}} body amour {{has become a}} {{necessity}} for many professions and much work has gone into the optimisation of the mechanics of protection. In the present study a broader view {{of the effects of}} ergonomics, design, reliability and protection has been taken. Three background topics are examined by reference to the literature. First, {{as an example of the}} threats and injury mechanisms that prevail in modern conflicts, the effects of blast injury to the head are investigated. This is followed by a review of ergonomic test methods and is completed by a study exploring the influence of history on modern body armour design. Solutions to some of these problems are then considered. The problem of accurately measuring impact loads to the head is investigated and a rigid instrumented head form is demonstrated. This work showed that the filtering techniques derived from crash tests used in the current helmet standards are not applicable to ballistic impact events. A one day wearer trial for police armour based on typical actions carried out by police officers in the performance of their normal duties is developed and demonstrated. A mechanical flexibility test is shown to give quantitative data but a direct link between ergonomic rankings and flexibility could not be established. Reliability of both soft and <b>hard</b> <b>body</b> <b>armour</b> is investigated and for typical armour types it is demonstrated that a minimal deterioration takes place with time and existing inspections techniques can highlight armour that is below standard. This study has introduced measurement techniques in an attempt to quantify some of the effects investigated with the intention of using quantitative methods to improve armour design and minimise some of the negative effects of wearing body armour...|$|E

The Kevlar-wool and 100 % Kevlar fabrics were produced as weft-knit single jersey using the whole garment knitting machine. The physical properties of the fabrics produced were measured.

40|$|Musculoskeletal {{injuries}} are reported as burdening the military. An identified {{risk factor for}} injury is carrying heavy loads; however, soldiers are also required to wear their load as <b>body</b> <b>armour.</b> To investigate the effects of <b>body</b> <b>armour</b> on trunk and hip kinematics during military-specific manual handling tasks, 16 males completed 3 tasks while wearing each of 4 <b>body</b> <b>armour</b> conditions plus a control. Three-dimensional motion analysis captured and quantified all kinematic data. Average trunk flexion for the weightiest armour type was higher compared with control during the carry component of the ammunition box lift (p <  0. 001) and sandbag lift tasks (p <  0. 001). Trunk rotation ROM was lower for all armour types compared with control during the ammunition box place component (p <  0. 001). The altered kinematics with <b>body</b> <b>armour</b> occurred independent of armour design. In order to optimise armour design, manufacturers {{need to work with}} end-users to explore how armour configurations interact with range of personal and situational factors in operationally relevant environments. Practitioner Summary: Musculoskeletal {{injuries are}} reported as burdening the military and may relate to <b>body</b> <b>armour</b> wear. <b>Body</b> <b>armour</b> increased trunk flexion and reduced trunk rotation during military-specific lifting and carrying tasks. The altered kinematics may contribute to injury risk, but more research is required...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the {{development}} of a new technique which enables a novel type of front panel for female <b>body</b> <b>armour</b> to be engineered, providing female contour, high level protection, and therefore comfort in wearing. The traditional cutting and stitching method can be used to form a dome shape to accommodate the bust area but it gives rise to weakness against projectile impact at the seams. A novel type of fabric with the advantage in mouldability is needed as an alternative to the conventional plain woven fabric in making female <b>body</b> <b>armour</b> without the need of cutting or folding but ease in manufacture. Dome-shaped fabric and angle-interlock woven fabric are two potential candidates. The analysis and comparisons determine the selection of the fabric with superior dome depth which is more suitable for the female <b>body</b> <b>armour</b> application. Ballistic evaluations on the selected fabric were carried out from two aspects: the overall ballistic performance investigation and the parametric study. The result provided a better understanding of kinetic energy absorption capability of single-piece selected fabrics. Additionally, the ballistic performance of fabric panels was further evaluated in the factory in order to ensure the selected fabric could achieve the commercial requirement. After the investigations of mouldability and ballistic resistance of the selected fabric, a mathematical model was created, which determines the pattern geometry for the front panel of the female <b>body</b> <b>armour.</b> This mathematical model takes the body figure size and bra size as the input, and the output is the profile of the front panel of female <b>body</b> <b>armour.</b> This work enables the speedy creation of a front panel of the female <b>body</b> <b>armour</b> in the selected fabric. This is an important advance and a novel approach for making seamless female <b>body</b> <b>armour</b> with satisfactory ballistic performance.
