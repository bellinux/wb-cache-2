5|$|A {{hall of fame}} honoring Wheel of Fortune {{is part of the}} Sony Pictures Studios tour, and was {{introduced}} on the episode aired May 10, 2010. Located in the same stage as the show's taping facility, this hall of fame features memorabilia related to Wheels syndicated history, including retired props, classic merchandise, photographs, videos, and a special case dedicated to White's wardrobe.

5|$|Double deck buses show an {{intermediate}} points display, {{as well as}} a final destination. The company's <b>double</b> <b>decker</b> buses are unique in Scotland in still displaying the destination at both the front and rear. In early mornings and late evenings, some services are curtailed to the city centre or to early termini, in the transition to the night bus service. In such cases, 'Part Route' is displayed in the intermediate display. Certain routes have all day short working termini, and minor diversions which are often indicated through the use of internal or external 'tram boards'. Since 2006 double-deck deliveries feature a 'Route Diverted; intermediate display, used when road closures cause a service to be diverted from its normal route.|$|E
5|$|In October 1963, London Transport ordered five <b>double</b> <b>decker</b> buses {{based on}} the Ford Thames Trader chassis for special duties, taking cyclists through the Dartford Tunnel. These had a lower deck {{purpose-built}} for carrying bicycles, with upper deck seats for cyclists. Access was via a stairwell to the upper deck starting several feet above {{the level of the}} road, accessible from special platforms built {{at either end of the}} tunnel; there was also a ladder built into the side of the bodywork for access elsewhere. The design was criticised for failing to protect any passenger from falling off the vehicle, and running costs were estimated at £2,550 per month, with only £45 revenue. The service was reduced to one bus in April 1964 and then cancelled in 1965, to be replaced by the current transfer service. One of these buses has been preserved.|$|E

The series {{was very similar}} to the <b>Double</b> <b>Deckers,</b> and essentially acted as a blueprint for the latter. Like the <b>Double</b> <b>Deckers,</b> Six and a Half centred on the adventures of seven children, who had similar personalities to the characters in <b>Double</b> <b>Deckers.</b> Many of the crew members from the Six and a Half series also worked on the <b>Double</b> <b>Deckers,</b> including producer Roy Simpson, director and writer Harry Booth, writer Glyn Jones, and choreographer Arnold Taraborrelli (who designed the title cards for Six and a Half). In addition, future <b>Double</b> <b>Deckers</b> cast members Brinsley Forde and Michael Audreson were among the stars of Six and a Half, and Melvyn Hayes appeared in a few episodes. Six and a Half also featured several gags and plotlines that would later be reused in <b>Double</b> <b>Deckers.</b>|$|R
