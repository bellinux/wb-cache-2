30|$|The {{efficient}} {{labeling of}} commercial synthetic peptides as internal standards {{is a prerequisite}} for obtaining accurate quantitative results. To avoid sample loss during the desalting procedure, in-solution dimethyl labeling was performed to ensure the accuracy of the quantification. MALDI-TOF-MS and nanoLC-ESI-MS/MS were performed to estimate the labeling efficiency of the synthetic peptides and the islet proteotypic mixture, respectively. After a chemical reaction with dimethyl labeling reagents, all primary amines (the N-terminus and the side chain of the lysine residues) in a peptide mixture were labeled and converted to <b>dimethylamines.</b> The light and intermediate dimethyl label resulted in monoisotopic mass shifts of + 28.0313 and + 32.0564  Da per primary amine, respectively.|$|R

The L-gluco ceramide analogues 43, 46 a, and 47, and the L-altro ceramide analogues 51 a and 52 were synthesized from either 31 or 32. The L-ribo diols 8 and 16, and the amino alcohols 19 and 20 inhibit sphingosine kinase 1 (SPHK 1), while the L-arabino analogues 7, 15, 17, and 18 are inactive.

50|$|Methanohalophilus mahii is an obligately {{anaerobic}} methylotrophic and methanogenic chemoheterotroph, able {{to reduce}} single-carbon compounds and multi-carbon compounds given {{that there are no}} carbon-carbon double bonds present. Trace amounts of Mg2+, K+, Ca2+, and Fe2+ ions are required for methanogenic growth. Methanol can be used independently as a carbon source, and the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas (EMP) glycolytic pathway can be utilized for catabolic processes. Possible electron donors include methanol, methylamines, <b>dimethylamines,</b> and trimethylamines. Methanohalophilus mahii is capable of utilizing several metabolic pathways to either reduce or oxidize methyl groups, creating either methane or carbon dioxide in the process. In the reductive methylotrophic methanogenic pathway, Methanohalophilus mahii can eventually reduce a methyl group to a methane, which is released. In the oxidative methylotrophic pathway, the methyl group is instead oxidized to carbon dioxide and released. This process directly contributes to carbon mineralization in marine ecosystems.|$|R
40|$|Protein {{methylation}} at arginine residues is a prevalent posttranslational modification in eukaryotic {{cells that}} has been implicated in processes from RNA-binding and transporting to protein sorting and transcription activation. Three main forms of methylarginine have been identified: N(G) -monomethylarginine (MMA), asymmetric N(G),N(G) -dimethylarginine (aDMA), and symmetric N(G),N'(G) -dimethylarginine (sDMA). To investigate gas-phase fragmentations and characteristic ions arising from methylated and unmodified arginine residues in detail, we subjected peptides containing these residues to electrospray triple-quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry. A variety of low mass ions including (methylated) ammonium, carbodiimidium, and guanidinium ions were observed. Fragment ions resulting {{from the loss of}} the corresponding neutral fragments (amines, carbodiimide, and guanidine) from intact molecular ions as well as from N- and C-terminal fragment ions were also identified. Furthermore, the peptides containing either methylated or unmodified arginines gave rise to abundant fragment ions at m/z 70, 112, and 115, for which cyclic ion structures are proposed. Electrospray ionization tandem mass spectra revealed that dimethylammonium (m/z 46) is a specific marker ion for aDMA. A precursor ion scanning method utilizing this fragment ion was developed, which allowed sensitive and specific detection of aDMA-containing peptides even {{in the presence of a}} five-fold excess of phosphorylase B digest. Interestingly, regular matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectra recorded from aDMA- or sDMA-containing peptides showed metastable fragment ions resulting from cleavages of the arginine side chains. The neutral losses of mono- and <b>dimethylamines</b> permit the differentiation between aDMA and sDMA...|$|R
25|$|DMF {{was first}} {{prepared}} in 1893 by the French chemist Albert Verley (8 January 1867 – 27 November 1959), by distilling {{a mixture of}} <b>dimethylamine</b> hydrochloride and potassium formate.|$|E
25|$|The {{eastern part}} of the {{molecule}} BC (cyanobromide 37) and the western part AD (thiodextrolin 55, with the propionic acid ester group racemized) were then joined using potassium t-butoxide to thioether 56 (through a sulfide ion intermediate). A second sulfur contraction (cyanoethyl phosphine/ trifluoroacetic acid/sulfolane) yielded cyanocorrigenolide 57 with the propionic acid ester group of ring C also racemised. Due to the steric bulk of both reactants this contraction was the only successful method. The oxygen atoms in the lactam and the lactone group were replaced by sulfur (phosphorus pentasulfide/4-methylpyridine) in dithiocyanocorrigenolide 58 and the S-methyl derivate 59 was formed by reaction with trimethyloxonium fluoroborate. <b>Dimethylamine</b> addition opened the thiolactone ring with an exocyclic alkene group in 60 by elimination of the sulfide anion from the methyl group.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} some {{analytical}} and pharmaceutical {{problems associated with}} chiral drugs. Although there can be marked differences between enantiomers in their pharmacological profile, many chiral drugs are still marketed as racemic mixtures. As has been indicated in the previous chapters, there is {{a variety of reasons}} that make it essential to have analytical methods available that can discriminate between the individual enantiomers. Therefore analytical methods, based on liquid chromatography, were studied towards their applicability to the separation of enantiomers. Both direct and indirect chromatographic separation methods were studied. In the indirect separation method the emphasis was on the development of chiral derivatization reagents for tertiary amines. Because of the low reactivity of tertiary amines very few chiral derivatization reagents are known for drugs with this functional group. (-) Menthylchloroformate was used as a chiral derivatization agent for tertiary <b>dimethylamines.</b> (+) - 1 -(9 -F 1 uorenyl) ethylchloroformate was used for the derivatization of a secondary amine. The enantiomeric separation of chiral aminotetralins was studied using direct chromatographic methods. Direct enantiomeric separations are often based on trial and error experiments. Optimization of the working conditions for chiral columns, e. g. mobile phase, flow velocity, eluent composition and column temperature is seldomly seen in the literature. Therefore, we applied chemometrics to study the influence of these parameters on the separation of the aminotetralins on a commercially available chiral Chiralcel OD column. This resulted not only in optimal working conditions and much better separations, but also in {{a better understanding of the}} chiral recognition mechanism of the column. ...|$|R
40|$|Complexation and {{catalysis}} of two calixresorcinarene (RES) derivatives with nucleophilic N,N-dimethylamino functions {{attached to}} their upper rims in the hydrolysis of carboxylate and sulfonate esters of 4 -nitrophenol and 2, 4 -dinitrophenol have been investigated. Rate constants obey the complexation equation: k(obs) = k(b) x K-s + k(c) [Host] / K-s + [Host] Values of the dissociation constant (K-s) of the complexes are within the range exhibited by other systems such as cyclodextrins-ester complexes. The reactions of sulfonate esters only exhibit inhibition by the macrocyclic hosts. The reactions of the carboxylate esters exhibit catalysis and inhibition depending on the pH of the system. It is proposed that the dimethylamino function in RES 3 and RES 5 behaves as a nucleophile to form a reactive acylammonium species which subsequently decomposes and regenerates the catalytic amine. In the reaction of substituted phenyl acetates with RES 3 the effective charge on the leaving oxygen in the complexed state (+ 0. 88) is slightly more positive than that in the free ester (+ 0. 70). The effective charge on the leaving oxygen in the transition structure is substantially more positive (+ 0. 04 units) than in a model intramolecular reaction of tertiary <b>dimethylamines</b> with aryl esters (- 0. 53 units). The influence of the host on the reaction in the complex includes an electronic component which is ascribed to solvation of the transition structure of the rate-limiting step by water molecules located within the cavity of the host. It is suggested that this solvation is stronger than that occurring in the transition state for the model intramolecular reaction...|$|R

In the chemical agent factory in Dyhernfurth an der Oder, codenamed [...] "Hochwerk", at least 12,000 metric tons of this agent were manufactured between 1942 and 1945. The manufacturing process consisted of two steps, the first being reaction of gaseous <b>dimethylamine</b> (1) with an excess of phosphoryl chloride (2), yielding dimethylamidophosphoric dichloride (3, codenamed [...] "Produkt 39" [...] or [...] "D 4") and dimethylammonium chloride (4). The dimethylamidophosphoric dichloride thus obtained was purified by vacuum distillation and thereafter transferred to the main Tabun production line. Here it was reacted with an excess of sodium cyanide (5), dispersed in dry chlorobenzene, yielding the intermediate dimethylamidophosphoric dicyanide (not depicted in the scheme) and sodium chloride (8); then, absolute ethanol (6) was added, reacting with the dimethylamidophosphoric dicyanide to yield tabun (7) and hydrogen cyanide (9). After the reaction, the mixture (consisting of about 75% chlorobenzene and 25% tabun, along with insoluble salts {{and the rest of}} the hydrogen cyanide) was filtered to remove the insoluble salts and vacuum-distilled to remove hydrogen cyanide and excess chlorobenzene, so yielding the technical product, consisting either of 95% tabun with 5% chlorobenzene (Tabun A) or (later in the war) of 80% tabun with 20% chlorobenzene (Tabun B).|$|E
