However, Kefalas was one vote short of the 33 necessary to pass the legislation out of the house, and in April, asked that the legislation be killed.|$|E

25|$|The modern <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>system</b> <b>in</b> Korea {{had been}} formed for about 30 years since opening {{the country in}} 1876.

The new system consisted of three sectors: public health, medical care, and monitoring of private practitioners and drug-sellers. The Sanitary Board was set to provide systematic public health care such as vaccination, sanitation and quarantine and the police were created to enforce many sanitary affairs. Hospitals for Western medicine were established in the medical care sector. Licensing for herbal doctors and pharmacists was taken {{in order to control}} the quality of private practitioners.|$|E
25|$|The {{driving force}} behind the {{development}} of bioresorbable metals is primarily due to their ability to provide metal-like mechanical properties while degrading safely in the body. This is especially relevant in orthopaedic applications, where although many surgeries only require implants to provide temporary support (allowing the surrounding tissue to heal), the majority of current bio-metals are permanent (e.g. stainless steel, titanium). Degradation of the implant means that intervention or secondary surgery will not be necessary to remove the material {{at the end of its}} functional life, providing significant savings in both cost and time for the patient and <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>system.</b> <b>In</b> addition, the corrosion products of current bio-metals (which will still corrode in the body to some degree) can generally not be considered biocompatible.|$|E

25|$|Despite all the {{progress}} made since {{the creation of}} the universal <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>system</b> <b>in</b> 1988, there are still several public health problems in Brazil. In 2006, the main points to be solved were the high infant (2.51%) and maternal mortality rates (73.1 deaths per 1000 births). The number of deaths from noncommunicable diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases (151.7 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants) and cancer (72.7 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants), also has a considerable impact on the health of the Brazilian population. Finally, external but preventable factors such as car accidents, violence and suicide caused 14.9% of all deaths in the country.

25|$|The United States National Health Care Act is a {{perennial}} {{piece of legislation}} introduced in the United States House of Representatives by Representative John Conyers (D-MI). The act would establish a universal single-payer <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>system</b> <b>in</b> the United States, the rough equivalent of Canada's Medicare, the United Kingdom's National Health Service, and Taiwan's Bureau of National Health Insurance, among other examples.

During the 2009 health care debates over the bill that became the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, H.R. 676 {{was expected to be}} debated and voted upon by the House in September 2009, but was never debated. In the wake of Bernie Sanders' 2016 presidential campaign, in which a push for universal healthcare featured prominently, single-payer proposals gained traction. John Conyers reintroduced his bill in the House of Representatives in January 2017. Four months later, the bill was supported by 112 co-sponsors, surpassing {{for the first time the}} 25% mark of co-sponsorship. In September of the same year, Bernie Sanders himself, together with 16 co-sponsors, introduced a Medicare-for-all bill in the Senate (S. 1804).|$|E
