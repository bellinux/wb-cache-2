During the period Heseltine was the MP for Tavistock in Devon (from 1966 to 1974), Heseltine {{became part of}} a local 'fishing gang' with Ted Hughes. His wife was delighted, as an admirer of the poet, but Heseltine himself did not {{initially}} <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>he</b> <b>was.</b>|$|E
25|$|Lee Krasner and Jackson Pollock {{established}} {{a relationship with}} one another in 1942 after they both exhibited at the McMillen Gallery. Krasner was intrigued by his work and the fact she did not <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> since she knew many abstract painters in New York. She went to his apartment to meet him. By 1945, they moved to The Springs on the outskirts of East Hampton. In the summer of that year, they got married in a church with two witnesses present.|$|E

His younger sister, La Toya Jackson joined as a housemate in the later sixth celebrity series in January 2009.|$|E

500|$|It {{was during}} a train journey in Japan that Abbe first met Ueshiba. Abbe didn't <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> and he reacted to Ueshiba looking at him, saying: [...] "What are you staring at, old man?" [...] Ueshiba replied: [...] "I {{know who you}} are," [...] to which Abbe {{modestly}} retorted: [...] "Everyone knows me, I am Kenshiro Abbe, Champion of All Japan." [...] Ueshiba then introduced himself as the Founder of Aikido, and was told by Abbe that he didn't look strong {{enough to be a}} martial arts master. Ueshiba then offered Abbe his little finger, and said: [...] "But young man, you look very strong indeed. Please break my finger." [...] Abbe at first declined, but eventually accepted the challenge, presumably to shut the old man up. Abbe claimed that, as he took hold of the old man's finger and tried to break it, he found himself {{on the floor of the}} carriage and totally immobilised. Whilst on the floor Abbe asked Ueshiba for permission to study under him.|$|E
500|$|On 7 November 2013, {{a person}} who was at the murder scene {{uploaded}} a 1:04 minute video on YouTube showing the scene before Francisco Rafael was killed. The video starts with the former vocalist of Banda El Recodo singing [...] "El Señor de las Canas", a song by Vicente Fernández, alongside a mariachi group. As the film progresses, the camera turns to the sides and shows former footballer Jared Borgetti sitting at a table with Rocío del Carmen Lizárraga, wife of Francisco Rafael. Towards the last seconds of the video, a bald-looking man passes through the back of the tables {{in front of the camera}} and apparently gives a hand signal to the assassin before walking away. Then, a man dressed as a clown (the presumed assassin) passes through the crowd and heads towards Francisco Rafael. Seconds later, one shot was heard; most of the invitees were not aware of what had happened, and the music continued. Shortly afterwards, four more shots were heard from the rear. Following the second round of shots, the music stopped and the invitees started screaming. The video only captured a few seconds after the last four shots before concluding. The Baja California Sur authorities believe that the bald-looking man that appeared on the video shortly before the clown and apparently gave him a hand signal is involved in the murder plot. Eyewitnesses who sat at a table with the suspect stated that they did not <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> but that they saw him greet Francisco Rafael during the party. The suspect reportedly made three phone calls during the party and sent several text messages. Investigators believe that the man was possibly communicating with the assassin; the authorities are investigating the text messages and phone calls made that day in the area through the Telcel database. With the surface of the video, the authorities were able to also gather more information about the assassin and the murder. They were able to identify other invitees, including former Cruz Azul footballer Héctor López. The video allowed the authorities to identify the physical characteristics of the assassin, including his skin color, approximate height, and the color of his clothing. The authorities are investigating whether any purchases made in custom or fabric stores in the area might lead them to the murderers.|$|E

2500|$|Hammer also {{released}} a single called [...] "Ring 'Em", and {{largely on the}} strength of tireless street marketing by Hammer and his wife, plus continued radio mix-show play, it achieved considerable popularity at dance clubs in the San Francisco Bay Area. Heartened by his rising prospects, Hammer launched into seven-day-a-week rehearsals with the growing troupe of dancers, musicians, and backup vocalists he had hired. It was Hammer's stage show, and his infectious stage presence, that led to his big break in 1988 while performing in an Oakland club. There he impressed a record executive who [...] "didn't <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>he</b> <b>was,</b> but knew he was somebody", according to the New Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock & Roll.|$|E

He and his wife Joan worked with Robert Jacobvitz, an executive at the Jewish Federation of the Greater East Bay in Oakland, California, and lawyer Anne Treseder to create the [...] "International Committee to Commemorate Dr. Aristides de Sousa Mendes." [...] They were able to gain the support of {{two members of the}} California delegation of the United States House of Representatives, Tony Coelho and Henry Waxman, who introduced a resolution in Congress to recognize his humanitarian actions. [...] That same year, Sousa Mendes was honored at the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles, where John Paul and his brother Sebastião gave impassioned speeches and Waxman spoke as well.|$|E
2500|$|Ten {{days before}} he died, Lindbergh wrote to each of his European mistresses, imploring them to {{maintain}} the utmost secrecy about his illicit activities with them even after his death. The three women (none of whom ever married) all managed to keep their affairs secret even from their children, who during his lifetime (and {{for almost a decade}} after his death) did not know the true identity of their father, whom they had only known by the alias Careu Kent and they had only seen him when he briefly visited them once or twice per year. However, after reading a magazine article about Lindbergh in the mid-1980s, Brigitte's daughter Astrid deduced the truth; she later discovered snapshots and more than 150 love letters from Lindbergh to Brigitte. After Brigitte and Anne Lindbergh had both died, she made her findings public; in 2003 DNA tests confirmed that Lindbergh had fathered Astrid and her two siblings. Reeve Lindbergh, Lindbergh's youngest child with Anne, wrote in her personal journal in 2003, [...] "This story reflects absolutely Byzantine layers of deception on the part of our shared father. These children did not even <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>he</b> <b>was!</b> He used a pseudonym with them (To protect them, perhaps? To protect himself, absolutely!)" ...|$|E

2500|$|Madonna {{chatted with}} fans through her first live chat on AOL {{on the day}} of Music release. In order to {{celebrate}} the album's release, Madonna had a release party at dance emporium Catch One in Los Angeles, California, on September 20, 2000. The £1.4 million party paid by the singer's record company Warner Bros. and Us magazine was attended by 600 select guests who received special invitations. The party invites were sent out in white leather boxes, lined with black fur. A gold necklace was inside with letters spelling out the album's title, and only those wearing the necklaces would be allowed into the club. More than a dozen strippers were in attendance to keep the party in the same theme as from the music video for [...] "Music". She sported a five-carat diamond ring Ritchie gave her for her birthday, and a black T-shirt that read [...] "Snatch Coming Soon" [...] promoting Ritchie's film, while Ritchie promoted Madonna's album wearing a T-shirt with the word Music emblazoned on it. Among those who attended the party were Sheryl Crow, Gwen Stefani, Maverick Records' head Guy Oseary, and George Clinton, who arrived with Macy Gray in a horse-drawn carriage. Madonna's then-boyfriend Guy Ritchie was initially denied access into the VIP lounge by a security guard. He apparently got into a shoving match with a bodyguard who did not <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>he</b> <b>was.</b>|$|E
2500|$|While yet a young man, Nicholas {{followed}} {{the example of}} his uncle, the abbot, by making a pilgrimage to the birthplace of Christianity—the Holy Land. Desiring a serene time of preparation, Nicholas set sail on an Egyptian ship where the other pilgrims did not <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>he</b> <b>was.</b> The first night he dreamed a storm would put them all at peril. When he awoke {{in the morning he}} warned the sailors that a severe storm was coming, but they need not fear, for [...] "God will protect us." [...] Almost immediately the sky darkened and strong winds roared round the ship. The wind and waves made it impossible to keep the ship under control. Even with lowered sails, the sailors feared for their very lives and begged Nicholas to pray for safety. One sailor climbed the main mast, tightening the ropes so the mast would not crash onto the deck. As he was coming back down, the sailor slipped, fell to the deck, and was killed. While Nicholas prayed, the storm did quiet, relieving the sailors. Their comfort, however, was dampened by grief over their comrade's death. As Nicholas prayed over the dead sailor, he was revived, [...] "as if he had only been asleep." [...] The man awakened without pain and the ship finished the journey to the Holy Land. Nicholas then embarked on his pilgrimage to the holy places, walking where Jesus had walked.|$|E
2500|$|Larey {{was taken}} to the {{hospital}} for minor cuts and received stitches for head wounds. Hollis was hospitalized for several days with three skull fractures. Larey was taken home the next evening by sheriff's deputies. She stated she did not know why the attacker did not chase after her or kill her. She learned that the injured Hollis made his way to Richmond Road and flagged down a passing motorist, who contacted a local funeral home ambulance. Larey thought the attacker may have been scared off by headlights. In her interview with Lucille Holland, she stated that she had told the attacker to kill her because she would rather have been dead than to be touched or abused. She also explained that she did not understand why officers did not believe her when she told them the attacker was black and that she did not <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>he</b> <b>was.</b> She said officers attempted to coerce her into stating that she knew the assailant. Larey described him as a man with a white mask over his head, with cutout places for his eyes and mouth. Because Hollis was blinded by the flashlight before being beaten, he did not notice a mask. Although Hollis believed he was a dark-tanned white man, Larey believed he was a light-skinned African American [...] "because of the way he pronounced the curse words he growled." [...] They agreed he was about six feet tall.|$|E

2500|$|The {{narrative}} of the curse of Cain {{is found in the}} text of [...] The curse was the result of Cain murdering his brother Abel and lying about the murder to God. When Cain spilled his brother's blood, the earth became cursed as soon as the blood hit the ground. In a sense, the earth was left [...] "drinking Abel's blood". [...] gives a two part sentencing for Cain's curse. The first concerns the earth that was cursed by Abel's blood. Should Cain attempt to farm the land, the earth would not yield produce for him. This may imply why he went on to build cities, namely the City of Enoch. The second part of the curse marks Cain as a fugitive ( [...] ) and a wanderer ( [...] ). The combination of these Hebrew words , [...] "fugitive" [...] and [...] "wanderer", is unique in the Hebrew Bible. Modern interpretations of the Hebrew verse 12 suggest that Cain went on to live a nomadic lifestyle and that he was also excluded from the family unit. In the Septuagint, the emphasis on Cain's curse is dramatically increased by the combination of the Greek participles στένων καὶ τρέμων ("groaning and shaking upon the earth"). Syriac Christianity interprets the Greek version to mean that Cain experienced a real physical affliction that would enable others to <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> when they saw him. Philo interprets the Greek verse 12 as an allegory for Cain's fear of being [...] The Samaritan Pentateuch and the Targums translate the same verse to mean that Cain feared being [...] "an exile and an unstable man".|$|E
