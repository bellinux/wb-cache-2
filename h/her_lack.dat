5|$|Her early {{style is}} less {{individual}} and more realistic or primitive, despite <b>her</b> <b>lack</b> of knowledge of, or perhaps rejection of, basic perspective. Initially she created simple compositions or copied existing images. As her career advanced she created complicated, panoramic compositions of rural life.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the core}} {{elements}} of Kerrigan's personality is that of her manipulation by others, and <b>her</b> <b>lack</b> of identity.

Although Callo accompanies him, Ashley does not accept her as a combat partner due to <b>her</b> <b>lack</b> of combat experience. Callo ends up being Sydney's hostage and discovers the truth of Müllenkamp's activities. Another Riskbreaker, Rosencrantz, appears during Ashley's battles in Leá Monde, briefing him on the plans of the VKP, Sydney and the Cardinal, and subsequently his take on Ashley's past. This casts suspicion on Ashley's behalf, as Riskbreakers always work alone.|$|E
5|$|Only in {{exceptional}} circumstances would {{there have been no}} dowry, since the lack of one could have been interpreted as proof that no legitimate marriage occurred. A dowry may have been occasionally overlooked if a bride's family connections were very favorable; Callias reportedly married Elpinice, a daughter of the noble Philaidae, to join that family and was sufficiently wealthy that <b>her</b> <b>lack</b> of a dowry did not concern him.|$|E
50|$|Lertcheewakarn is a counterpuncher {{with her}} two-handed backhand and forehand. She is {{intelligent}} on court {{and has a}} good strategy. <b>Her</b> game is <b>lacking</b> powerful strokes, but based on precise groundstrokes.

5|$|Between October and December 2005, Stefani toured North America in her Harajuku Lovers Tour 2005 {{to promote}} Love. Angel. Music. Baby., {{performing}} 37 {{shows in the}} United States and five in Canada. Her opening acts included Ciara, M.I.A. and The Black Eyed Peas. Her performances received mixed reviews from critics, with criticism about <b>her</b> <b>lack</b> of musical material, frequent costume changes and perceived inability to dance, but praise for her stage presence and elaborate costumes. Stefani finished the recording of her second album, The Sweet Escape, in late 2006, having recorded some of the material in 2005, suspended the project due to pregnancy, and resumed recording in summer 2006.|$|E
5|$|In December 1800 George Austen {{unexpectedly}} {{announced his}} decision to retire from the ministry, leave Steventon, and move the family to 4, Sydney Place in Bath. While retirement and travel were good for the elder Austens, Jane Austen was shocked to be told she was moving from the only home she had ever known. An indication of her state of mind is <b>her</b> <b>lack</b> of productivity as a writer during the time she lived at Bath. She {{was able to make}} some revisions to Susan, and she began and then abandoned a new novel, The Watsons, but there was nothing like the productivity of the years 1795–1799. Tomalin suggests this reflects a deep depression disabling her as a writer, but Honan disagrees, arguing Austen wrote or revised her manuscripts throughout her creative life, except for a few months after her father died.|$|E
5|$|MTV Unplugged is a live EP by American {{singer and}} {{songwriter}} Mariah Carey, {{released in the}} United States on June 2, 1992 by Columbia Records. Following the success of Carey's previous two albums and the growing critical commentary on <b>her</b> <b>lack</b> of concert tours and unsubstantial televised performances, Sony BMG organised a performance show at the Kaufman Astoria Studios, New York on March 16, 1992. The show, titled MTV Unplugged, originally aired on MTV to help promote Carey's album Emotions, as well as help shun critics who deemed Carey a possible studio artist. However, after its success, the show was {{released to the public}} as an EP, with an accompanying VHS titled MTV Unplugged +3.|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} of the You're Fired studio audience, combined {{with two of the}} panellists, disagreed with the decision, feeling that Claire should have been fired for <b>her</b> complete <b>lack</b> of respect, although Simon himself said that he deserved to be fired. Sir Alan would later go on to say that he kept Claire as she still had more potential, even if <b>her</b> attitude was <b>lacking.</b>|$|R
50|$|Andersen {{was known}} for {{bringing}} dignity and flawless execution to her playing, but some critics found <b>her</b> style <b>lacking</b> in excitement and her tempi too free.|$|R
60|$|Her {{face was}} a strange study. There was fear mingled with unwholesome curiosity, the {{heritage}} of <b>her</b> natural <b>lack</b> of refinement. She leaned over the palings.|$|R
5|$|On her eighteenth birthday, Bella Swan {{wakes up}} from a dream, in which she sees herself as an old woman. She expresses her distaste about growing older than her boyfriend Edward Cullen, a human with vampire powers, who stopped aging {{physically}} at seventeen.

5|$|Shortly after Corder {{left the}} house, Maria {{set out to}} meet him at the Red Barn which was {{situated}} on Barnfield Hill, about half a mile from the Martens' cottage. This was the last time that she was seen alive. Corder also disappeared, but later turned up and claimed that Marten was in Ipswich, Great Yarmouth, or some other place nearby, and that he could not yet bring her back as his wife for fear of provoking the anger of his friends and relatives. The pressure on Corder to produce his wife eventually forced him to leave the area. He wrote letters to Marten's family claiming that they were married and living on the Isle of Wight, and he gave various excuses for <b>her</b> <b>lack</b> of communication: she was unwell, she had hurt her hand, or the letter must have been lost.|$|E
5|$|The tale's disappointing qualities {{have been}} {{ascribed}} to Potter's growing {{lack of interest}} in writing for children, to pressure from her publisher for yet another book, and to Potter's desire to exploit the lucrative American market. Potter's artistically successful books were written for specific children; Timmy Tiptoes however was composed for Potter's amorphous, ill-defined American fanbase. By 1911, the demands of her aging parents and the business operations at her working farm, Hill Top, occupied much of Potter's time and attention to the exclusion of nearly everything else, and are accounted as some {{of the reasons for the}} author's declining artistry and <b>her</b> <b>lack</b> of interest in producing children's books.|$|E
50|$|Secretary of the State: Incumbent Democrat Susan Bysiewicz {{declined}} seeking another term, first {{intending to}} run for governor, then Attorney General. However, the Connecticut Supreme Court found <b>her</b> <b>lacking</b> the qualifications to serve as attorney general in May, and she decided to not seek any office in 2010. Republican candidate Jerry Farrell Jr. faced Democratic primary winner Denise Merrill in the election. Merrill defeated Gerry Garcia to win the Democratic nomination on August 10. In the election for Secretary of the State, Merrill defeated Farrell.|$|R

Her friends are Jill, Claire, and Cindy.|$|R
5000|$|Jean Bart, moored in Casablanca harbour, stayed uncompleted as {{facilities}} to complete <b>her</b> were completely <b>lacking.</b> <b>Her</b> 90 mm and 37 mm mountings were even disembarked, and reallocated to the Casablanca harbour anti-aircraft defence, and the battleship left with only four twin 13.2 mm AA machine guns.|$|R
5|$|Victorious after {{defeating}} the King in the war, Meliara returns to Tlanth {{to improve its}} dilapidated castle with the family's new riches. One day, Bran visits her, accompanied by his new fiance Lady Nimiar Argaliar and the Marquis of Shevraeth, who is preparing to take the throne of Remalna. Now accustomed to the fine fashions of court, Bran expresses dismay at finding Mel dressed in old clothes - she never before cared about her appearance. Mel becomes shy and embarrassed about <b>her</b> <b>lack</b> of courtly finesse and grace, and avoids the visitors, especially Shevraeth, who she fears looks down on her. Nimiar convinces Mel to return with them to court, and begins to teach her the essential of life there, including its customs, clothing styles, and hand fan language.|$|E
5|$|Argus was recommissioned and {{partially}} modernised {{shortly before the}} Second World War {{and served as a}} training ship for deck-landing practice until June 1940. The following month she made the first of her many ferry trips to the Western Mediterranean to fly off fighters to Malta; she was largely occupied in this task for the next two years. The ship also delivered aircraft to Murmansk in Russia, Takoradi on the Gold Coast, and Reykjavík in Iceland. By 1942, the Royal Navy was very short of aircraft carriers and Argus was pressed into front-line service despite <b>her</b> <b>lack</b> of speed and armament. In June, she participated in Operation Harpoon, providing air cover for the Malta-bound convoy. In November, the ship provided air cover during Operation Torch, the invasion of French North Africa, and was lightly damaged by a bomb. After returning to the UK for repairs, Argus was used again for deck-landing practice until late September 1944. In December, she became an accommodation ship and was listed for disposal in mid-1946. Argus was sold in late 1946 and scrapped the following year.|$|E
5|$|Criticism of Shiller in the 2007 {{election}} largely {{focused on}} the lack of communication with ward residents, failure to obtain input from residents for zoning changes in the ward, <b>her</b> <b>lack</b> of involvement in community policing meetings, and the many years of blighted retail in the ward. Some critics charged that Shiller was frustrating developers while using the Wilson Yard project to maintain her political base. In 2007, Shiller defeated social worker James Cappleman with 53% of the vote. In October, 2007, Shiller became chair of the City Council's Human Relations Committee. In 2009, Shiller was criticized by Uptown residents for her perceived lack of engagement in address crime in the neighborhood, including a string of violent robberies in nearby Lakeview that attracted the attention of the Chicago Tribune, Chicago Sun-Times, and local TV news. Police interviewed said interventions from Shiller and her staff facilitated the protection of gang members from policing activity, allegedly for gaining voter base, {{according to a report in}} Chicago Magazine.|$|E
