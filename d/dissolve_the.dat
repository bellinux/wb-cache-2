5|$|During the referendum, 84% of the {{approximately}} 7.5 million voters approved the amendments. On November 28 of that year, President Lukashenko signed the changes into law. Other results {{not directly related to}} the voting included the expanding role of the Council of Ministers, which allowed it to deal with issues related to development of economic, social and political spheres within Belarus. The 1996 referendum was not, however, the first call to <b>dissolve</b> <b>the</b> Supreme Soviet. In 1991 and 1992, after the August coup in Moscow by senior CPSU officials, democratic forces in the government wanted to <b>dissolve</b> <b>the</b> Supreme Soviet permanently. The members of the Belarusian Popular Front pressed for a referendum, and despite achieving the number of signatures required by law at the time, the Supreme Soviet quashed the measure.|$|E

5|$|In 1953, in {{the face}} of African opposition, Britain {{consolidated}} the two Rhodesias with Nyasaland (Malawi) in the ill-fated Central African Federation, which was essentially dominated by Southern Rhodesia. Growing African nationalism and general dissent, particularly in Nyasaland, persuaded Britain to <b>dissolve</b> <b>the</b> Union in 1963, forming three separate divisions. While multiracial democracy was finally introduced to Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland, however, Southern Rhodesians of European ancestry continued to enjoy minority rule.|$|E

5|$|The European Parliament can <b>dissolve</b> <b>the</b> Commission {{as a whole}} {{following}} a vote of no-confidence but only the President can request the resignation of an individual Commissioner.

5|$|When ionic {{compounds}} <b>dissolve,</b> <b>the</b> individual ions dissociate and are solvated by the solvent and dispersed {{throughout the}} resulting solution.

5|$|At first, the dissenting deputies {{were often}} {{convinced}} or cowed back to withdraw their objections. Also, at first, the rule {{was used to}} strike down only individual laws, not to <b>dissolve</b> <b>the</b> chamber and throw out all measures passed. For example, as historian Władysław Czapliński describes in the Sejm of 1611 context, some resolutions were struck down, but others passed. From the mid-17th century onward, however, an objection to any item of Sejm legislation from a deputy or senator automatically caused other, earlier adopted legislation to be rejected. That was because all legislation that was adopted by a given Sejm formed a whole.|$|E
5|$|British colonial {{secretary}} Lord Hillsborough, {{hoping to}} prevent {{a repeat of the}} Stamp Act Congress, instructed the colonial governors in America to <b>dissolve</b> <b>the</b> assemblies if they responded to the Massachusetts Circular Letter. He also directed Massachusetts Governor Francis Bernard to have the Massachusetts House rescind the letter. On June 30, the House refused to rescind the letter by a vote of 92 to 17, with Adams citing their right to petition as justification. Far from complying with the governor's order, Adams instead presented a new petition to the king asking that Governor Bernard be removed from office. Bernard responded by dissolving the legislature.|$|E

The effect of these actions, was to cut the pro-slavery faction remaining in the Indiana Territory in half. The election resulted in a sweeping victory for the anti-slavery party. The new assembly quickly passed legislation revoking the indentured servitude laws of 1803, and introduced legislation to prevent its reintroduction. They also passed laws aimed at preventing slave hunters from removing escaped slaves from the state.|$|E
