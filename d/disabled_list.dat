5|$|After {{starting}} {{the season with}} a 4–2 record, Young lost his last four starts before spending the remainder of the season on the <b>disabled</b> <b>list.</b> His final start occurred on June 14. He was initially placed on the 15-day <b>disabled</b> <b>list</b> on June 19, but on July 31 he was transferred to the 60-day <b>disabled</b> <b>list.</b> In August, he had season ending arthroscopic surgery to repair partial tears in his labrum. He had been disabled with shoulder inflammation.|$|E
5|$|Feldman, had microfracture surgery {{performed}} {{on his right}} knee during the off-season. To rehab, he made two appearances for the Double-A Frisco Roughriders and eight appearances for the Triple-A Round Rock Express. On July 8, he was transferred from the 15-day <b>disabled</b> <b>list</b> to the 60-day <b>disabled</b> <b>list.</b> He was outrighted to the minors on July 13. However, on July 14, after he cleared waivers, Feldman rejected the assignment giving the Rangers the option of activating him from the <b>disabled</b> <b>list</b> or releasing him. They opted to activate him off the <b>disabled</b> <b>list,</b> which re-added him to the 40-man roster.|$|E
5|$|Fernández {{began the}} 2015 {{season on the}} 15-day <b>disabled</b> <b>list</b> but was later moved to the 60-day <b>disabled</b> <b>list</b> to {{continue}} recovery from Tommy John surgery. It was announced by the Marlins on June 15 {{that he would make}} his season debut on July 2. In his debut, Fernández recorded six strikeouts in six innings. He also hit a home run. Fernández returned to the <b>disabled</b> <b>list</b> in August with a biceps strain in his pitching arm. He returned to the mound in September and set a major league record for consecutive wins at home by a single pitcher with his seventeenth such win on the 25th of that month.|$|E
5|$|He {{was placed}} on the <b>disabled</b> <b>list</b> after he {{incurred}} a strained oblique muscle during the third inning of his July 24 start. On August 9, he was activated off the <b>disabled</b> <b>list</b> to make a scheduled start. He took a 12-start (five-decision) undefeated streak, dating back to a May 12 loss to the Cardinals, into his first start off the <b>disabled</b> <b>list,</b> but he took the loss in a 5–0 defeat, which was again against the Cardinals. Young ended the 2007 season as the major league leader in opponent batting average and hits per nine innings, but also in stolen bases allowed (with 44). He battled injuries late in the season and surrendered the ERA leadership to Jake Peavy in his August 30 start.|$|E
5|$|On April 29, 2017, Freese {{was placed}} on the 10-day <b>disabled</b> <b>list</b> due to a right {{hamstring}} strain.|$|E
5|$|On July 9th, Kipnis {{was placed}} on the <b>disabled</b> <b>list</b> with a {{hamstring}} injury. He would be activated on August 6th but would continue to feel discomfort in the hamstring.

5|$|During spring {{training}} in 2014, Diamondbacks manager Kirk Gibson decided that Corbin would start on Opening Day. However, Corbin felt arm tightness during a {{spring training}} start. An MRI revealed {{damage to his}} ulnar collateral ligament of the elbow. He underwent Tommy John surgery, and missed the entire 2014 season. The Diamondbacks placed Corbin on the 15-day <b>disabled</b> <b>list</b> on March 30, and transferred him to the 60-day <b>disabled</b> <b>list</b> on April 4, in order to open a roster spot for Roger Kieschnick, who they claimed off waivers.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, Affeldt {{was again}} {{expected}} to be the Royals' closer. However, he did not get a save opportunity until April 16 against Detroit, and he was unable to finish that game because of a groin injury that landed him on the <b>disabled</b> <b>list</b> again. After rehabbing in Omaha, Affeldt returned to the Royals on June 4. He was no longer the closer, however, because Mike MacDougal had been closing well in his absence. Affeldt was not healthy for long, as he returned to the <b>disabled</b> <b>list</b> on June 20 after reaggravating the groin injury.|$|E
5|$|In February 2011, before {{reporting}} {{to his first}} spring training with the Brewers, Greinke suffered a fractured rib while playing basketball. He started the 2011 season on the <b>disabled</b> <b>list.</b>|$|E

5|$|On May19, 2002, Rivera {{recorded}} his 225th career save, surpassing Dave Righetti as the Yankees' franchise leader in saves. Over {{the next few}} months of the season, injuries limited his playing time. He was first placed on the <b>disabled</b> <b>list</b> in June due to a groin strain, though his first-half numbers, which included a 1.47ERA and 21saves, earned him an All-Star selection. In a game on July14, Rivera endured one of his worst outings, allowing six earned runs, including a walk-off grand slam. One week later, he was placed on the <b>disabled</b> <b>list</b> with a shoulder strain. Rivera was activated on August8 after receiving a cortisone shot but returned to the <b>disabled</b> <b>list</b> after a recurrence of shoulder tightness. For the season, Rivera recorded a 2.74ERA and 28saves in 32opportunities in just 46innings pitched.|$|E
5|$|Strasburg {{served a}} brief stint on the <b>disabled</b> <b>list</b> {{with a mild}} lateral strain in June and was re-activated on June 16.|$|E
5|$|Beckett {{struggled}} {{in the early}} part of the 2013 season with an 0–5 record and 5.19 ERA in eight starts. He was placed on the <b>disabled</b> <b>list</b> with a groin strain on May 15. While on the <b>disabled</b> <b>list</b> he began to experience numbness and tingling in his hand so he went to see a nerve specialist and expressed doubt as to whether he would be able to pitch again. The Dodgers shut him down from pitching for a month while he underwent a rigorous rehabilitation program in an effort to avoid season-ending surgery. However, the tingling sensation returned when he attempted to resume his throwing program in late June. He was diagnosed with thoracic outlet syndrome, which required him to undergo surgery on July 10, 2013 that ended his 2013 season.|$|E
5|$|DeGrom {{compiled}} four quality {{starts in}} his first four MLB starts, but did not record a win in any of them. On July 8, deGrom pitched seven scoreless innings and recorded 11 strikeouts in giving the Mets their 4,000th franchise victory. Along with Steve Cishek of the Miami Marlins, deGrom was named the National League's (NL) Co-Player of the Week {{for the period of}} July 21 to July 27 after allowing only one earned run in two starts that week. He was named the NL Rookie of the Month for July. On August 11, deGrom went on the <b>disabled</b> <b>list</b> with rotator cuff tendinitis. Rafael Montero was called up on August 12 in deGrom's place. On August 23, Montero was re-sent back to the 51s to make room for deGrom coming off the <b>disabled</b> <b>list.</b>|$|E
5|$|Despite Nova's success, he was demoted to Scranton/Wilkes-Barre due to {{the return}} of Bartolo Colón and Phil Hughes from the <b>disabled</b> <b>list,</b> as Nova had minor league options remaining. Nova used the time with Scranton/Wilkes-Barre {{to work on his}} slider.|$|E
5|$|Entering the 2007 season, Sánchez {{was ranked}} {{as the second}} best {{prospect}} in the Giants' organization (behind only Tim Lincecum) by Baseball America. Sánchez made the Giants' roster out of spring training. He struggled in his first fourteen games, however, and was sent down to Fresno on May 21 when Russ Ortiz came off the <b>disabled</b> <b>list.</b> Sánchez returned to the majors on June 6 when, coincidentally, Ortiz got hurt again. On June 13, {{he picked up his}} first major league hit (an RBI double) in a 7–4 loss to the Toronto Blue Jays. On July 4, he was placed on the <b>disabled</b> <b>list</b> with a strained rib cage, but he was reactivated on July 18.|$|E
5|$|He {{returned}} to the <b>disabled</b> <b>list</b> on July 8, after experiencing pain in his surgically repaired shoulder. He returned from the DL again on July 21 against the Washington Nationals, and was 3 for 4 with a home run and a double in the game.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, while {{pitching}} on a wet mound in Cleveland, Shuey {{injured his}} right hip. Over {{the next several}} seasons, he had multiple surgeries on his hip, including repairing a torn labrum and removing bone spurs. He finished the 1999 season with an 8–5 record, a 3.53 ERA, and six saves. His eight wins tied for the most among Cleveland's relief pitchers. In 2000, new Indians' manager Charlie Manuel indicated the Indians would attempt to shift Shuey into the closer role. When Shuey spent time on the <b>disabled</b> <b>list,</b> Steve Karsay served as the Indians' closer. He again spent time on the <b>disabled</b> <b>list</b> in 2001 with a strained elbow ligament.|$|E
5|$|Kemp {{was placed}} on the <b>disabled</b> <b>list</b> on May 14 because of a {{hamstring}} injury, ending his streak of 399 consecutive games played, which was the longest in the majors at the time. After his DL stint, he promptly re-injured his hamstring two days later while running the bases, and returned to the DL. Despite missing about 2 months with injuries, Kemp was voted by the fans as a starter for the 2012 Major League Baseball All-Star Game. As he was still on the <b>disabled</b> <b>list,</b> Kemp did not play in the game but he did participate in the Home Run Derby for the second straight year, hitting one home run in the Derby. Kemp finally returned to the Dodgers lineup on July 13, after missing about two months with his hamstring injury.|$|E
5|$|On April 11, 2017, Kemp {{was placed}} on the 10-day <b>disabled</b> <b>list</b> due to left {{hamstring}} tightness. On April 29, Kemp became the first Brave to have a three home run game since Mark Teixeira in 2008.|$|E
5|$|On December 11, Youkilis {{accepted}} {{a one-year contract}} worth $12 million to play third base for the New York Yankees. Though Youkilis had not been popular {{with members of the}} Yankees and their fans, Robinson Canó and Alex Rodriguez publicly supported the signing, and Joba Chamberlain reached out to Youkilis in an attempt to smooth over their past differences. The deal became official on December 14. Youkilis was diagnosed with a back strain when the 2013 season began and was placed on the 15-day <b>disabled</b> <b>list</b> on April 30, 2013. He was activated and returned on May 30, 2013. He was placed back on the <b>disabled</b> <b>list</b> on June 14, 2013 after restraining his back. He then underwent season-ending surgery to repair a herniated disk in his back on June 20, 2013.|$|E
5|$|On July 22, 2017, the Giants signed Sandoval to a {{minor league}} {{contract}} and assigned him to the minor leagues. On August 5, Sandoval was called up to the major league roster after Brandon Belt {{was put on the}} <b>disabled</b> <b>list</b> for a concussion.|$|E
5|$|On June 9, 2016, Hughes {{was struck}} in the left knee off a line drive from J. T. Realmuto and left the game.

On June 11, it was {{revealed}} that there was a non-displaced fracture of the femur in the left knee. On June 12, he was transferred to the 60-day <b>disabled</b> <b>list.</b> On June 28th, Hughes' season was declared over as he was set to undergo season ending surgery for thoracic outlet syndrome. He finished the 2016 season with a 1-7 record for the Twins.|$|E
5|$|Ross {{broke his}} finger in his debut with the Reds on April 29 and went on the <b>disabled</b> <b>list.</b> He {{returned}} to the Reds on May 23 and appeared in one more game before getting traded to the Florida Marlins on May 26 for cash considerations.|$|E
5|$|Affeldt {{was placed}} on the <b>disabled</b> <b>list</b> after only four games with blister {{problems}} again. His time on the DL was brief and he returned to the Royals on May 6. On May 28, he struck out a career high eight hitters in a win against the Minnesota Twins. Later, on June 6, he notched his first hit.|$|E
5|$|After {{playing in}} minor league {{baseball}} for the Braves, Gattis made the team's Opening Day roster in 2013. Receiving playing time with Brian McCann on the <b>disabled</b> <b>list,</b> Gattis won the National League Rookie of the Month Award for both April and May 2013. He became the Braves' primary catcher in 2014, but {{was traded to the}} Astros before the 2015 season.|$|E
5|$|Barrett {{became a}} free agent {{after the end of the}} season, but was offered {{arbitration}} from the Padres. The Tampa Bay Rays expressed interest in signing Barrett, even though the signing would involve trading the Padres a future second round draft pick as compensation. Barrett accepted the Padres' arbitration offer on December 7. The Padres placed Barrett on the <b>disabled</b> <b>list</b> on April 8, 2008, after he sustained an elbow injury. The team later activated him on May 25, after he had recovered, and completed a minor league rehabilitation assignment. On July 2, 2008, Barrett was rushed to the hospital after fouling a pitch off his face. He required surgery to repair the damage, and had been placed on the <b>disabled</b> <b>list</b> for the second time in 2008. The Padres waived Barrett on October 11, after he previously expressed interest in testing the free-agent market.|$|E
5|$|Clippard {{was traded}} on December 4, 2007, to the Washington Nationals for relief pitcher Jonathan Albaladejo. The Nationals viewed {{him as a}} {{contender}} for {{a spot in the}} starting rotation. However, he began the season with the Columbus Clippers, Washington's Class AAA affiliate. He pitched his first game for the Nationals on June 9, 2008, after Odalis Pérez was placed on the 15-day <b>disabled</b> <b>list.</b> He was optioned to the minor leagues after this start, but was given a second start a few days later, as Pérez was not yet ready to return. The Nationals then optioned Clippard to Columbus after his second start, in which Clippard pitched to a 1–1 record and 4.35 ERA. He was recalled later in June as Shawn Hill was placed on the <b>disabled</b> <b>list.</b> He spent most of the season with Columbus, going 6–13 with a 4.66 ERA. He tied Yorman Bazardo and Charlie Haeger for the most losses in the International League that season.|$|E
5|$|Entering the 2014 season, {{he was set}} {{to compete}} for {{a spot on the}} bench, as Amaro {{declared}} that he was not good enough, particularly defensively, to play everyday. However, the Phillies placed him on the <b>disabled</b> <b>list</b> (DL) due to a strained oblique; his estimated recovery time was around the end of April or the beginning of May. When Ruf returned, he played for the IronPigs, but suffered another injury on June 3, fracturing his left wrist when sliding into the wall while playing left field. He returned to the major league Phillies on July 22 when John Mayberry, Jr. landed on the <b>disabled</b> <b>list,</b> but struggled in his first several games; in his first 17 at-bats, he had just two hits. Nevertheless, the Phillies toyed with platooning him with Ryan Howard, who was also struggling, at first base, and Ruf also played two innings at third base. Overall, Ruf amassed only 117 major league plate appearances, and was significantly hindered by injuries.|$|E
5|$|Hughes {{began the}} 2008 {{season as the}} third starter in the Yankees' rotation. In his first six starts, he had an 0–4 record and a 9.00 ERA. On April 30, he {{was placed on the}} <b>disabled</b> <b>list</b> with a {{strained}} oblique and cracked rib. On a May 2 visit to an optometrist, Hughes was found to be slightly nearsighted; as a result, he started wearing glasses on the mound.|$|E
5|$|In spring {{training}} in 2014, Núñez competed with Zelous Wheeler, Yangervis Solarte, Dean Anna, and Scott Sizemore for a reserve infielder role with the Yankees. With reserve infielder Brendan Ryan starting the {{season on the}} <b>disabled</b> <b>list,</b> the Yankees chose Anna and Solarte over Núñez. To add Solarte to the roster, the Yankees designated Núñez for assignment.|$|E
5|$|Ishikawa was claimed off {{assignment}} waivers by the New York Yankees on July 7. He {{appeared in}} one game for the Yankees, starting at first base and going 0–2 with two strikeouts in a 51 loss to the Kansas City Royals. On July 14, Ishikawa cleared waivers and elected free agency after being designated for assignment when Derek Jeter returned from the 60-day <b>disabled</b> <b>list.</b>|$|E
5|$|On July 2, Kinsler {{went on the}} <b>disabled</b> <b>list</b> with {{a stress}} {{fracture}} in his left foot; he did not come back until July 31, and missed 26 games. He tied a major league record on August 25, when he had eight plate appearances in a nine-inning game (a 30–3 win over Baltimore).|$|E
5|$|On July 6, 2010 at Miller Park, in a 6-1 {{win over}} the Milwaukee Brewers, Bumgarner earned his first career victory by going eight innings without {{yielding}} a run. Bumgarner pitched well enough that when Wellemeyer returned from the <b>disabled</b> <b>list</b> in August, Giants' manager Bruce Bochy chose to use him in the bullpen and leave Bumgarner in the rotation.|$|E
