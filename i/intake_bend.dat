40|$|Risks to {{operational}} {{integrity of}} the Rangitata Diversion Race (RDR) presented by bank erosion and extreme discharges in the Rangitata River are investigated. Specific investigations are confined to two locations within the Klondyke reach of the river, namely <b>Intake</b> <b>Bend</b> and Klondyke Bend. A fluvial geomorphological assessment of the Rangitata River, and specifically the Klondyke reach, is carried out to facilitate the selection of appropriate erosion mitigation measures. Historical flood data for the Rangitata River are analysed and a flood frequency analysis using annual maximum discharge data is carried out. A risk analysis of flood damage to the RDR intake structure and canal at <b>Intake</b> <b>Bend</b> is undertaken using the results of flood frequency analysis and a calibrated MIKE 11 numerical hydraulic model. A 1 : 150 scale, moveable bed, physical hydraulic model of the <b>Intake</b> <b>Bend</b> reach is used to investigate and evaluate methods for the mitigation of fluvial erosion of the RDR embankment and sediment admission to the RDR canal. An analysis {{of the effect of}} RDR water abstraction on bed aggradation in the river below the RDR intake is undertaken using the river flow-duration curve and semi-empirical sediment transport equations. Assessment of erosion trends and mitigation options at Klondyke Bend are undertaken primarily through analysis of historical photographs and river discharge data. River morphology trends are inferred from study of river terrace remnants, recent river bank erosion, bar morphology and intervening discharge regimes. A generic analysis of the effects on river bed and water surface profiles from a proposed bend cut-off, to mitigate erosion at Klondyke Bend, is undertaken using a HEC- 6 morphological model. Assessment of erosion mitigation options and conceptual design of a recommended option are based on the above data and from documented experience of similar situations on other rivers...|$|E
40|$|In this study, {{effect of}} {{two types of}} groynes; bar and blade types on river outer bank {{protection}} has been investigated by a physical model. Model includes a canal with 73 cm width, 45 cm height and 115 cm long with two <b>intakes</b> and four <b>bends</b> of 45, 90, 135 and 180 °. Experiments have been performed on the 45 ° bends of model. Results show that permeable groynes in both bar and blade types are effective in outer bank protection. Comparison of two bar and blade types groynes show that blade-types groynes are more economical, but their disadvantages are scour around the groynes. Finally combination of two bar and blade types groynes can be the solution of this problem...|$|R
