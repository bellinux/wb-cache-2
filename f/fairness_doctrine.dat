25|$|Kucinich was {{involved}} in efforts {{to bring back the}} <b>Fairness</b> <b>Doctrine,</b> requiring radio stations to give liberal and conservative points of view equal time, which he and other critics of talk radio argue is not presently the case. Fellow Democrat Maurice Hichney, Vermont's independent Senator Bernie Sanders, and others have joined him in this effort. Conservatives have criticized these plans, alleging that what they believe to be a liberal-dominated Hollywood, academia, new media, and mainstream media would not be subject to these regulations.|$|E
40|$|This article revisits and {{examines}} whether the <b>fairness</b> and justice <b>doctrine</b> of Armstrong v. United States can justify and fashion standards of review {{to protect the}} right to just compensation of the Takings Clause. The Court has relied on Armstrong to show {{the purpose of the}} Takings Clause in many takings decisions. However, can Armstrong serve a greater purpose? In Dolan v. City of Tigard, the United States Supreme Court applied the unconstitutional conditions doctrine to justify the need for a standard of review to protect the right to just compensation. The Court transported questionable constitutional doctrine to validate Justice Holmes’s regulatory takings theory. Yet, in Tahoe-Sierra Preservation Council v. Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, the Court applied Armstrong’s <b>fairness</b> and justice <b>doctrine</b> to justify not applying standards of review to a complete range of factual theories of regulatory takings theory. Therefore, the Court leads one to ask whether the Armstrong <b>fairness</b> and justice <b>doctrine</b> should be considered in justifying the selection of standards of review and principles to protect the right to just compensation...|$|R

40|$|Due process {{jurisprudence}} {{has long}} been dominated by discussion of its procedural requirements and substantive limitations. Through {{the lens of the}} Constitution’s Due Process Clause, however, the Supreme Court has also considered the geographic reach and substantive exercise of legal authority, the delegation of law making to private parties, the incorporation doctrine, and the issues of fundamental <b>fairness.</b> These <b>doctrines</b> have existed for some time, but the Supreme Court has never explained how they fit into its “procedural vs. substantive” dichotomy. This article examines these Lost Due Process Doctrines and poses the question of whether they should suffer the same fate as other precedents that are no longer considered “good law,” or if they can be reconciled with the underlying principles of the Magna Carta and continue to inform the Court’s ever-developing interpretation of constitutional law...|$|R

50|$|In 1949, the Mayflower Doctrine, {{which had}} {{forbidden}} editorializing {{on the radio}} since 1941, was repealed. This made way for the <b>Fairness</b> <b>Doctrine.</b> The 1949 FCC Commission Report served {{as the foundation for}} the <b>Fairness</b> <b>Doctrine.</b> It established two forms of regulation on broadcasters: to provide adequate coverage of public issues, and to ensure that coverage fairly represented opposing views. The second rule required broadcasters to provide reply time to issue-oriented citizens. Broadcasters could therefore trigger <b>Fairness</b> <b>Doctrine</b> complaints without editorializing. The commission required neither of the Fairness Doctrine's obligations before 1949. Until then broadcasters had to satisfy only general “public interest” standards of the Communications Act.|$|E
