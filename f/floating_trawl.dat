40|$|The paper {{deals with}} an {{experiment}} with a <b>floating</b> <b>trawl</b> net off Cochin, using {{a pair of}} curved otter boards and a transducer mounted on the head rope of the net. 32 hauls were made with different towing speeds and warp length keeping one factor constant for varying parameters of the other factor. The working data for 32 hauls are presented and the effect in the fishing depth of the net due to the variation in one factor is mentioned. The 'fishing depth' is indicated in this paper as {{the distance between the}} head rope and the bottom. The usefulness of similar experiments with added information on the angle of leading warp at the stern for the exploitation of column fishes in Indian waters is indicated...|$|E
40|$|Wehypothesized that a <b>floating</b> <b>trawl</b> bridle {{that does}} not contact the seabed would reduce the herding of fish, {{especially}} bottom dwelling floun-ders, and thus reduce bycatch of these fish in shrimp trawls. We further hypothesized that, due to the non-herding nature of northern shrimp (Pandalus borealis), the use of anoff-bottomfloating bridlewouldnot reduce shrimp catch. These hypotheseswere tested in the field by comparing a trawl with regular bottom-tendering wire bridles and the same trawl with floating synthetic bridles in the Gulf of Maine northern shrimp fishery. As expected, {{no statistically significant differences}} in catch rates and size were found for the targeted northern shrimp (146. 3 + 10. 58 kg h 21 control vs. 140. 8 + 9. 35 kg h 21, p 0. 13). Total finfish bycatch was reduced by 14. 9 %, and the difference was statistically different (p 0. 01). The most important reduction was the catch of juvenile American plaice (Hippoglossoides platessoides) with a significant reduction of 20. 0 % (p 0. 01). For witch flounder (Glyptocephalus cynoglossus), a reduction of 19. 3 % was found, but it was not statistically significant (p 0. 14). The reduction of Acadian redfish (Sebastes fasciatus) (by 28. 0 %, p 0. 02) was also statistically different. Catch of targeted silver hake (Merluccius bilinearis) was reduced by 10. 8 %, but the difference was only marginally significant (p 0. 07). An analysis of length frequencies for the targeted shrimp and major bycatch species revealed no size-related selection between the gears with regular bridles and floating bridles. The reductions in flounder bycatch indicate reduced herding of benthic species when the bridles are kept off bottom. This easy modificatio...|$|E
50|$|Scottish seining, {{sometimes}} called fly dragging, has the net attached to two long ropes usually made of leaded polypropylene and around 3 km in length. The net is deployed in a triangular fashion {{with the first}} rope attached to a marker buoy, the dhan, to which the boat returns to complete the set. Both ropes are then winched in as the boat steams ahead slowly. Winch speed is gradually increased as the net gets closer to keep the net moving forward and also to herd the fish into the net. Like the <b>trawl,</b> <b>floats</b> and weighted footrope keep {{the mouth of the}} net open and in contact with the seabed. This method of fishing takes place on grounds on the continental shelf and not in deep sea. Seine netting is for all forms of whitefish.|$|R
5|$|The tawny {{nurse shark}} is taken by {{commercial}} fisheries operating throughout its range, including off Pakistan, India, Thailand, and the Philippines; an exception is in Australian waters, where it is only taken in small numbers as bycatch. This shark is caught using demersal <b>trawls,</b> <b>floating</b> and fixed bottom gill nets, and on hook-and-line. The meat is sold fresh or dried and salted, the fins are used for shark fin soup, and the offal processed into fishmeal. In addition, the liver {{is a source of}} oil and vitamins, and the thick, tough skin is made into leather products. Off Queensland, Australia, the {{tawny nurse shark}} is valued by big-game anglers. When hooked, large individuals are tenacious opponents and are difficult to subdue due to their habit of spinning. They are also capable of spitting a powerful jet of water into the faces of their captors, making grunting noises in between jets (making the tawny shark one of the few species of sharks to produce a noise);whether this is a deliberate defensive behavior is uncertain.|$|R
