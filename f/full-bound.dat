40|$|A full AFL {{is defined}} to be <b>full-bounded</b> {{if it can}} be {{generated}} by a set of boundedlanguages. It is shown that if ℳ is an AFL not consisting entirely of regular sets and if ℳ is contained in any <b>full-bounded</b> AFL, then ℳ is not closed under e-free substitution. Some typical consequences are that some context-free languages cannot be generated from any set of (not necessarily context-free) bounded languages by full AFL operations, or from any set of bounded context-free languages by full AFL operations and substitution...|$|R
6000|$|M. Ambrose Firmin Didot {{has left}} some {{notes on a}} more serious topic,--the colours to be chosen when books are <b>full-bound</b> in morocco. Thus {{he would have the}} [...] "Iliad" [...] clothed in red, the [...] "Odyssey" [...] in blue, because the old Greek rhapsodists wore a scarlet cloak when they recited the Wrath of Achilles, a blue one when they chanted of the Return of Odysseus. The {{writings}} of the great dignitaries of the Church, M. Didot would array in violet; scarlet goes well with the productions of cardinals; philosophers have their sober suit of black morocco, poets like Panard may be dressed in rose colour. A collector of this sort would like, were it possible, to attire Goldsmith's poems in a [...] "coat of Tyrian bloom, satin grain." [...] As an antithesis to these extravagant fancies, we may add that for ordinary books no binding is cheaper, neater, and more durable, than a coat of buckram.|$|E

40|$|Locomotion {{results from}} an interplay between biomechanical {{constraints}} of the muscles attached to the skeleton and the neuronal circuits controlling and coordinating muscle activities. Quadrupeds exhibit {{a wide range of}} locomotor gaits. Given our advances in the genetic identification of spinal and supraspinal circuits important to locomotion in the mouse, it is now important to get {{a better understanding of the}} full repertoire of gaits in the freely walking mouse. To assess this range, young adult C 57 BL/ 6 J mice were trained to walk and run on a treadmill at different locomotor speeds. Instead of using the classical paradigm defining gaits according to their footfall pattern, we combined the inter-limb coupling and the duty cycle of the stance phase, thus identifying several types of gaits: lateral walk, trot, out-of-phase walk, rotary gallop, transverse gallop, hop, half-bound, and <b>full-bound.</b> Out-of-phase walk, trot, and <b>full-bound</b> were robust and appeared to function as attractor gaits (i. e., a state to which the network flows and stabilizes) at low, intermediate, and high speeds respectively. In contrast, lateral walk, hop, transverse gallop, rotary gallop, and half-bound were more transient and therefore considered transitional gaits (i. e., a labile state of the network from which it flows to the attractor state). Surprisingly, lateral walk was less frequently observed. Using graph analysis, we demonstrated that transitions between gaits were predictable, not random. In summary, the wild-type mouse exhibits a wider repertoire of locomotor gaits than expected. Future locomotor studies should benefit from this paradigm in assessing transgenic mice or wild-type mice with neurotraumatic injury or neurodegenerative disease affecting gait...|$|E
