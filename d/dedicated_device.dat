50|$|Null functions, {{particularly}} the NOP variety, {{are also used}} to provide delays of indeterminate length within wait loops. This is a common strategy in <b>dedicated</b> <b>device</b> controllers that must wait for an external input and have no other tasks to perform while they are waiting. Such wait loops are also used in software applications on larger multiprocessing computer systems. However, for multiprocessing systems a better approach is to use operating system functions that let other processes use the CPU during the waiting period.|$|E
50|$|A network video {{recorder}} (NVR) is a software program that records video in a digital format to a disk drive, USB flash drive, SD memory card or other mass storage device. An NVR contains no dedicated video capture hardware. However, the software is typically run on a <b>dedicated</b> <b>device,</b> usually with an embedded operating system. Alternatively, to help support increased functionality and serviceability, standard operating systems are used with standard processors and video management software. An NVR is typically deployed in an IP video surveillance system.|$|E

5000|$|Aerobatics done at {{low levels}} {{and for an}} {{audience}} is called [...] "stunt flying". To enhance the show effect of aerobatic maneuvers, smoke is sometimes generated; the smoke allows viewers to see the path travelled by the aircraft. Due to safety concerns, the smoke is not a result of combustion but is produced by the vaporization of fog oil into a fine aerosol, achieved either by injecting the oil into the hot engine exhaust or {{by the use of}} a <b>dedicated</b> <b>device</b> that can be fitted in any position on the aircraft. The first military aerobatic team to use smoke at will during displays was Fleet Air Arm 702 Squadron [...] "The Black Cats" [...] at the Farnborough Airshow in September 1957.|$|E
50|$|In {{traditional}} networks, both wired and wireless, the connected devices, or nodes, {{depend on}} <b>dedicated</b> <b>devices</b> (edge devices) such as routers and/or servers for facilitating the throughput {{of information from}} one node to the other. These 'routing nodes' {{have the ability to}} determine where information is coming from and where it is supposed to go. They give out names and addresses (IP addresses) to each connected node and regulate the traffic between them. In wireless grids, such <b>dedicated</b> routing <b>devices</b> are not (always) available and the bandwidth that is permanently available to traditional networks has to be either 'borrowed' from an already existing network or publicly accessible bandwidth (open spectrum) has to be used.|$|R

50|$|The {{filtering}} {{and selective}} blocking of DNS traffic {{can be performed}} by a DNS firewall which is configured to block DNS name resolution based on name patterns. A DNS firewall, such as Verigio DNS Firewall, can also block access to IP addresses for names not resolved via DNS. Thus prevent display of advertisements from servers accessed directly using their IP addresses.Advertising can be blocked by using a DNS server which is configured to block access to domains or hostnames which are known to serve ads by spoofing the address. Users can choose to use an already modified DNS server or set up a <b>dedicated</b> <b>device</b> such as a Raspberry Pi themselves. Manipulating DNS is a widely employed method to manipulate what the end user sees from the Internet but can also be deployed locally for personal purposes. China runs its own root DNS and the EU has considered the same. Google has required their Google Public DNS be used for some applications on its Android devices. Accordingly, DNS addresses / domains used for advertising may be extremely vulnerable to a broad form of ad substitution whereby a domain that serves ads is entirely swapped out with one serving more local ads to some subset of users. This is especially likely in countries, notably Russia, India and China, where advertisers often refuse to pay for clicks or page views. DNS-level blocking of domains for non-commercial reasons is already common in China.|$|E
