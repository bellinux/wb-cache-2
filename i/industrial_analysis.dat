We describe eight different methods for decomposing the aggregate energy intensity of industry into the impacts associated with changes in industrial production structure and sectoral energy intensity. These eight methods, derived from economic index numbers, include two methods that are often used by researchers and three methods that are proposed for the first time. We show the linkages between index numbers and decomposition methods, which would assist analysts in method selection when undertaking decomposition studies. A simple example is presented to illustrate {{the characteristics of the}} eight methods. Decomposition methodology Index numbers <b>Industrial</b> energy <b>analysis</b> Structural change...|$|R

50|$|Organizational {{analysis}} or {{more commonly}} <b>Industrial</b> <b>analysis</b> {{is the process}} of reviewing the development, work environment, personnel, and operation of a business or another type of association. This review is often performed in response to crisis, but may also be carried out as part of a demonstration project, in the process of taking a program to scale, or in the course of regular operations. Conducting a periodic detailed organizational analysis can be a useful way for management to identify problems or inefficiencies that have arisen in the organization but have yet to be addressed, and develop strategies for resolving them.|$|E

Strategy development is dependent upon a solid, current and complete <b>industrial</b> <b>analysis.</b> An <b>industrial</b> <b>analysis</b> includes, 1) a definition of the industry, 2) a description of external forces acting upon the industry, 3) a description of the industry structure and 4) an examination of the key success factors that benchmark the requirements for a firm to stay competitive in the industry. These analyses provide FRCSW with the information required to leverage their core competencies to indentify and capitalize on potential opportunities in the industry. This study identifies emerging trends, presents projected forecasts, identifies external forces on both the military aviation MRO industry and FRCSW, and discusses those factors that are key to long term success in the military aviation MRO industry. The conclusions present a number of opportunities for FRCSW to explore in their effort to remain the Navy's premier aviation depot...|$|E

40|$|Import {{substitution}} presents many {{economic development}} opportunities {{that can help}} regions achieve greater economic sustainability and self-reliance. Yet import substitution is largely neglected in economic development theory, practice and literature. There are few methods and resources available to planners trying to identify import substitution opportunities. However, impending economic challenges, such as energy market instability, climate change and carbon emissions regulation, mean that planners will be called upon with greater frequency and urgency to help regional economies adapt. This study offers and evaluates two methods for identifying import substitution opportunities within a regional economy. The first method is rooted in economic base theory, the dominant approach to regional economic development since the 1930 s. The second method is derived from <b>industrial</b> cluster <b>analysis,</b> a much-used economic planning approach since the 1990 s. Analysis of these two methods and their application to the Springfield, Massachusetts Metropolitan Statistical Area suggest that: 1) both methods show promise as screening tools to help planners focus economic development resources on subsequent industry research efforts, such as surveys, which {{are essential to the}} development of effective policy initiatives; 2) the <b>industrial</b> cluster <b>analysis</b> method is capable of identifying a wider range of candidate industries; 3) the economic base theory method may be more effective in smaller regions; and 4) the economic base theory method is useful for estimating leakage. The study also demonstrates that import substitution integrates aspects of economic base theory, particularly the capability to identify leakage and opportunities to increase industry multipliers, with the facets of <b>industrial</b> cluster <b>analysis</b> that emphasize local interindustry linkages and value chain networks...|$|R
