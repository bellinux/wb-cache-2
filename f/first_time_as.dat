5|$|Allied {{aircraft}} specifically started targeting ZNDH and Luftwaffe {{bases and}} aircraft for the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>as</b> {{a result of}} the Seventh anti-Partisan Offensive, including Operation Rösselsprung in late May 1944. Until then Axis aircraft could fly inland almost at will as long as they remained at low altitude. Partisan units on the ground frequently complained about enemy aircraft attacking them while hundreds of Allied aircraft flew above at higher altitude. This changed during Rösselsprung as Allied fighter-bombers went low en-masse for the first time, establishing full aerial superiority. Consequently, both the ZNDH and Luftwaffe were forced to limit their operations in clear weather to early morning and late afternoon hours.|$|E

5|$|Europa, {{along with}} Jupiter's three other large moons, Io, Ganymede, and Callisto, was {{discovered}} by Galileo Galilei on 8 January 1610, and possibly independently by Simon Marius. The first reported observation of Io and Europa was made by Galileo Galilei on 7 January 1610 using a 20×-magnification refracting telescope at the University of Padua. However, in that observation, Galileo could not separate Io and Europa due to the low magnification of his telescope, so that the two were recorded as a single point of light. The following day, 8 January 1610 (used as the discovery date for Europa by the IAU), Io and Europa were seen for the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>as</b> separate bodies during Galileo's observations of the Jupiter system.|$|E
5|$|Following For Your Eyes Only, Roger Moore had {{expressed}} a desire to retire from the role of James Bond. His original contract had been for three films, which was fulfilled with The Spy Who Loved Me. Subsequent films were negotiated on a film-by-film basis. Given his reluctance to return for Octopussy, the producers engaged in a semi-public quest for the next Bond, with both Timothy Dalton and James Brolin being suggested. However, when the rival Never Say Never Again was announced, the producers re-contracted Moore in the belief that an established actor in the role would fare better against Sean Connery. Brolin's three screentests were publicly released for the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>as</b> a special feature named James Brolin: The Man Who Would Be Bond in the Octopussy Ultimate Edition DVD.|$|E

It was captured by the Allies in September 1944, partially demolished on the orders of Winston Churchill to prevent its reuse as a military base, and then abandoned. It remained derelict until the mid-1990s. In 1997 it {{opened to the public}} for the <b>first</b> <b>time,</b> <b>as</b> a museum.

His interior X-Men-related work included a two-issue run on X-Factor and the one-shot , both in 1989, and three Uncanny X-Men Annuals, in 1986, 1988 and 1990.
