When {{designing}} {{improvement of}} the <b>gear</b> <b>lever,</b> solution of higher stiffness and lower mass in compare to the old design has been designed while keeping a necessary safety ratio. A new attachment of the <b>gear</b> <b>lever</b> to the car´s frame which increases lateral stability of the lever has been designed...|$|R

50|$|The Rekord P2 {{took its}} three-speed all-synchromesh {{transmission}} from its predecessor, {{along with the}} column mounted <b>gear</b> <b>lever</b> through which it was controlled. However, the P2 {{was also the first}} Rekord on which, as an option, buyers could specify a four-speed all-synchromesh transmission, still controlled using a column mounted <b>gear</b> <b>lever.</b>|$|R
50|$|Transmission: Two {{speed with}} clutch. Handlebar <b>gear</b> <b>lever</b> has 'trigger'.|$|R
50|$|The car {{featured}} {{an automatic}} clutch which was commonly {{described as a}} three-speed semi-automatic gearbox: there was no clutch pedal, but instead, touching the <b>gear</b> <b>lever</b> knob operated an internal electric switch that operated a vacuum system which disengaged the clutch. The <b>gear</b> <b>lever</b> itself then could be moved through a standard 'H pattern' gate.|$|R
50|$|The central {{position}} of the handbrake and ball change <b>gear</b> <b>lever</b> revealed the gearbox's US origin. It also made for easy entry through the driver's door and no cold steel up a driver's leg. The petrol tank was in the scuttle and its filler was above the <b>gear</b> <b>lever</b> in {{the centre of the}} dashboard.|$|R
5000|$|... 1973: <b>Gear</b> <b>lever</b> {{moved from}} {{dashboard}} to floor, between the front seats.|$|R

50|$|A {{clutch servo}} {{powered by the}} vacuum at the {{induction}} manifold operated the automatic clutch - a conventional clutch incorporating centrifugal operation. A switch in the <b>gear</b> <b>lever</b> operated a solenoid valve {{so that when the}} <b>gear</b> <b>lever</b> was moved the clutch was disengaged. A control unit made throttle adjustments to keep the engine speed matched to the driven clutch plate and also varied the speed of clutch operation appropriate to road speed.|$|R
50|$|The <b>gear</b> <b>lever</b> {{is built}} into the centre console, leaving space between the front seats for a couple of cup holders.|$|R
50|$|Coupé buyers {{found the}} four speed manual transmission, but {{controlled}} using a centrally positioned floor mounted <b>gear</b> <b>lever,</b> {{included in the}} price.|$|R

50|$|The German {{automobile}} manufacturer NSU {{produced an}} automated {{system for the}} rotary-engined NSU Ro 80 saloon car in the 1960s, similar in concept to VW's Automatic Stickshift: a three-speed manual gearbox with a vacuum operated dry clutch controlled by a contact in the <b>gear</b> <b>lever,</b> and a torque converter. There was no clutch pedal, but slightly moving the gearshift closed an electric switch that operated a vacuum system which disengaged the clutch. The <b>gear</b> <b>lever</b> itself then could be moved through a standard 'H pattern' gate.|$|R
50|$|The Amphicar's {{engine was}} mounted {{at the rear}} of the craft, driving the rear wheels through a 4-speed manual transmission. For use in the water, the same engine drove a pair of {{reversible}} propellers at the rear, with a second <b>gear</b> <b>lever</b> engaging forward or reverse drive. Once in the water, the main <b>gear</b> <b>lever</b> would normally be left in neutral. By engaging first gear as well as drive to the propellers when approaching a boat ramp, the Amphicar could drive itself out of the water.|$|R

50|$|In 1947 the PV800 was {{succeeded by}} PV821 and PV822. The cars were updated with the {{slightly}} stronger ED engine and the column-mounted <b>gear</b> <b>lever</b> from the PV 60.|$|R

2500|$|In September 2006, several {{improvements}} {{were introduced}} to the range, such as a new button for the trunk-lid, a new knob for the <b>gear</b> <b>lever,</b> crystal rear lamps, as well as new designs for the wheel trims and the alloy wheels and three new paint colors. Also, the new top of the range level Prestige was introduced, which featured larger door mirrors, body-colored bumpers (entirely), side moldings and door handles, leather-trimmed <b>gear</b> <b>lever</b> and steering wheel, as well as other interior refinements. It was only available with a new 1.6-litre 16-valve gasoline engine, which developed [...]|$|R

5000|$|Gearbox: driven {{through a}} single dry plate disc clutch {{mounted on the}} engine a {{separate}} four-speeds and reverse gearbox was mounted on a very substantial cross-member and controlled by a central ball-gate <b>gear</b> <b>lever.</b>|$|R
50|$|In most {{vehicles}} with manual transmission, gears are selected by manipulating a <b>lever</b> called a <b>gear</b> stick, shift stick, gearshift, <b>gear</b> <b>lever,</b> <b>gear</b> selector, or shifter {{connected to the}} transmission via linkage or cables and mounted on the floor, dashboard, or steering column. Moving the lever forward, backward, left, and right into specific positions selects particular gears.|$|R
25|$|In the {{interior}} the gear selector {{is similar to}} a push-button automatic with buttons labeled P, R, N and D while some earlier models have a <b>gear</b> <b>lever</b> similar to that in cars with manual transmission.|$|R
50|$|The 2-door C-Airdream {{features}} an aerodynamic design with an all-glass roof {{and has a}} drag coefficient of 0.28. The interior features no foot pedals or a <b>gear</b> <b>lever,</b> with all the resulting drive-by-wire controls located on the steering wheel.|$|R
50|$|Interior {{modifications}} {{were limited}} to a centre console designed to accommodate the new <b>gear</b> <b>lever</b> position, different seats and the later style dashboard, featuring tachometer, speedometer, oil pressure, water temperature and fuel level gauges. A wood-rimmed steering wheel was fitted.|$|R
