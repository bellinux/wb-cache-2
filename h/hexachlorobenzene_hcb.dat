Willow cuttings obtained from the site were developed into small plants to measure uptake in the dynamic system. The rates of plant capture of contaminants from contaminated sediment were experimentally estimated under various flow conditions and a mathematical model for the plant uptake rate of the plant "reactor" system was developed. Estimation of the buffering effect expected in these bayou-plant systems was determined by scale up of the kinetic data using the model results. Results indicated that for both steady and transient systems, the willow trees provided a significant buffering of the contaminant flux. Rate coefficients were obtained using an unsteady state analytical model and the experimental data. Cyclic flow resulted in the highest rate coefficients followed closely by slow flow, and the fast flow resulted in the lowest of the rate coefficients.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Prenatal {{exposure}} to endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) may induce weight gain and obesity in children, but the obesogenic effects of mixtures {{have not been}} studied. OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the associations between pre- and perinatal biomarker concentrations of 27 EDCs and child weight status at 7 years of age. METHODS: In pregnant women enrolled in a Spanish birth cohort study between 2004 and 2006, we measured the concentrations of 10 phthalate metabolites, bisphenol A, cadmium, arsenic, and lead in two maternal pregnancy urine samples; 6 organochlorine compounds in maternal pregnancy serum; mercury in cord blood; and 6 polybrominated diphenyl ether congeners in colostrum. Among 470 children at 7 years, body mass index (BMI) z-scores were calculated, and overweight was defined as BMI > 85 th percentile. We estimated associations with EDCs in single-pollutant models and applied principal-component analysis (PCA) on the 27 pollutant concentrations. RESULTS: In single-pollutant models, <b>HCB</b> (<b>hexachlorobenzene),</b> βHCH (β-hexachlorocyclohexane), and polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners 138 and 180 were associated with increased child BMI z-scores; and HCB, βHCH, PCB- 138, and DDE (dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene) with overweight risk. PCA generated four factors that accounted for 43. 4 % of the total variance. The organochlorine factor was positively associated with BMI z-scores and with overweight (adjusted RR, tertile 3 vs. 1 : 2. 59; 95 % CI: 1. 19, 5. 63), and these associations were robust to adjustment for other EDCs. Exposure in the second tertile of the phthalate factor was inversely associated with overweight. CONCLUSIONS: Prenatal {{exposure to}} organochlorines was positively associated with overweight at age 7 years in our study population. Other EDCs exposures did not confound this association.

40|$|Remote open oceans were {{traditionally}} {{considered as}} sinks of {{persistent organic pollutants}} (POPs) such as industrial chemicals (PCBs) and organochlorine pesticides (OCPs). In the context of reduced primary emissions as well as global warming, previous polluted reservoirs such as soil, large water bodies, and glaciers may act as secondary sources returning these POPs back to the atmosphere and ocean. It was also hypothesized that biogeochemical activities associated with phytoplankton {{in the water column}} would lead to the coupling of air-plankton systems to draw down the lipophilic POPs from the overlying atmosphere, similar to the biological pump taking up CO 2 from the atmosphere during phytoplankton blooms and then depositing it to the deep ocean. It has been found that POPs accumulate to high levels in apex predators such as whales and polar bears. To fully understand how POPs biomagnify along the food web, it is important to quantify the transfer of POPs from environmental media (sediments and water) to the base of food webs. This dissertation research was conducted in three remote oceans to verify these hypotheses. 1) In the first study, air and water samples were collected simultaneously on R/V Revelle during a scientific cruise in the N. and S. Pacific for POPs analysis. Results suggest that the Pacific was acting as a secondary source returning PCBs back to the air. This was the first work documenting the open ocean as a secondary PCB source. In contrast, this study showed gas exchange <b>hexachlorobenzene</b> of (<b>HCB)</b> was at steady-state between the air and ocean with no net transfer of HCB. 2) In the second study, air, water, and zooplankton samples (copepod Calanus) were collected simultaneously during the North Atlantic Bloom (NAB) in 2008 in a relatively small area south of Iceland. The POPs measurement showed dissolved phase concentrations of lipophilic OCP remained constant with time as the bloom evolved. Also, the OCPs were not being drawn from air to water during the main bloom as previous studies have hypothesized. Further our data and data from prior Arctic measurements suggested that the Arctic was a source of higher concentrations of hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCHs) and both the atmospheric (polar easterlies) as well as oceanic transport (East Greenland Current) would bring HCHs to the lower latitudes. Last, the measurements indicated that equilibrium partitioning governed the transfer of POPs from water into Calanus. To explore the measurements further, a box model was developed and used to investigate the fate of POPs during the bloom. Biogeochemical processes considered included air-water exchange, partitioning to particulate organic carbon (POC), removal by sinking POC, and biogeochemical degradation. Modeling results demonstrated that partitioning to POC was the dominant process determining the fate of OCPs in the NAB 2008. 3) In a final study, sediments and benthic biota were collected along the Palmer Long Term Ecological Research grids. For the first time, POPs concentrations in the Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) continental shelf sediments, porewater, and benthic deposit feeding holothurians were determined. High concentrations of POPs were found in close vicinity to major scientific research stations. Concentrations decreased sharply away from the locations with anthropogenic activity. This suggested that local activities were the dominant source of POPs in the WAP rather than long range transport by atmospheric and oceanic motion. The Westerlies and Antarctic Circumpolar Current may have acted as dynamical barriers to transports from the southern continents. The majority of POPs in the WAP sediments was bound to black carbon and was not available for uptake by benthic biota. POPs in the holothurians were in equilibrium with those in the porewater. Different bioaccumulation factors obtained suggestd that there were differences in lipids of the different benthos and in situ contamination patterns. ...|$|R

Rapid growth was defined as a z-score weight gain > 0. 67 SD between 6 months of age and birth. Overweight at 14 months was defined as a BMI z-score ≥ 85 th percentile. Generalized linear models examined the association between POPs and rapid growth (N = 1285) and overweight (N = 1198). Results The analysis population included 24...|$|E
40|$|Mg-Fe {{composite}} oxides {{with different}} Mg/Fe atomic ratios were synthesized by co-precipitation and characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD). Their dechlorination activities were evaluated using <b>hexachlorobenzene</b> (<b>HCB)</b> {{as a model}} compound. The experiments were carried out at 300 degrees C for 0. 5 h. The {{results indicate that the}} Mg-Fe composite oxide (Mg/Fe atomic ratio was 8) exhibits the best dechlorination activity among the oxides examined. This {{may be related to the}} formation of MgFe 2 O 4 phase with small crystal size. The products after reaction were analyzed by GCMS, XRD, and a chloride selective electrode. It was found that hydrodechlorination took place in the destruction of HCB. The discrepancy in the material balance between starting material and dechlorinated products indicates that, in addition to hydrodechlorination, other degradation routes may be present...|$|E
40|$|Persistent, {{lipophilic}} {{organochlorine pesticides}} (OCPs) such as dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCHs), dieldrin, chlordanes, <b>hexachlorobenzene</b> (<b>HCB)</b> and mirex {{are known to}} accumulate in human samples [1, 2]. Persistent OCPs are among the chemicals that are covered under the Stockholm Convention on persistent organic pollutants [3]. Exceptions to this include relatively less lipophillic compounds like HCH (KOW< 10 ^ 5). In Australia, OCPs such as DDT and HCHs were introduced in the 1940 s. This followed a period of widespread use until the 1970 s when recognition of risks related to OCPs resulted in reduced use and their ultimate ban in the 1980 s. Mirex, however, remained in very restricted use in Northern Australia for treatment of one species of termites (the Giant Termite (Mastotermes darwinensis)) but this use was phased out in 2007...|$|E
