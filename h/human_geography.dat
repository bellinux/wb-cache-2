5|$|The book {{describes}} each {{island that}} he visited in turn, giving {{a detailed account}} of its physical and <b>human</b> <b>geography,</b> its volcanoes, and the variety of animals and plants that he found and collected. At the same time, he describes his experiences, the difficulties of travel, and the help he received from the different peoples that he met. The preface notes that he travelled over 14,000 miles and collected 125,660 natural history specimens, mostly of insects though also thousands of molluscs, birds, mammals and reptiles.|$|E
5|$|Demographers or sociologists of {{population}} study the size, composition and {{change over time}} of a given population. Demographers study how these characteristics impact, or are impacted by, various social, economic or political systems. The study {{of population}} is also closely related to human ecology and environmental sociology, which studies a populations relationship with the surrounding environment and often overlaps with urban or rural sociology. Researchers in this field may study the movement of populations: transportation, migrations, diaspora, etc., which falls into the subfield known as Mobilities studies and {{is closely related to}} <b>human</b> <b>geography.</b> Demographers may also study spread of disease within a given population or epidemiology.|$|E
5|$|The book {{introduced}} {{a number of}} new ideas in the field of <b>human</b> <b>geography</b> and social organization models, that had been developed in the western world during the 18th century. Among the sources that the authors used to compose Geographia Neoteriki, were the Géographie Moderne by Nicolle de La Croix, the Géographie Ancienne, and the Géographie Moderne, which were part of the Encyclopédie Méthodique by Charles-Joseph Panckoucke. Additionally, the authors had personally examined the areas described in the work. This element served both as the work's primary organizing mode as well as the basis for their historical approach.|$|E

40|$|The {{cultural}} turn marks a reorientation of <b>human</b> <b>geography's</b> interdisciplinary concerns {{toward the}} wide field of cultural studies.

These have been the medium for the internationalisation of cultural studies upon which <b>human</b> <b>geography's</b> serious engagement with the field has depended.

Anthropologically, it records human relations between the colonists and the peoples under colonial rule, seeking to build an understanding of the nature and practice of colonial rule. As a critical theory, it presents, explains, and illustrates the ideology and practice of neocolonialism with examples drawn from history, political science, philosophy, sociology, anthropology, and <b>human</b> <b>geography.</b> It also examines the effects of colonial rule on the cultural aspects of the colony and its treatment of women, language, literature, Christian thought, and humanity.|$|E

Following a previous progress report (Head, 2007), we are not interested in assuming an ontological and unproblematic separation between ‘cultures’and ‘their [vegetative] environment’ as the basis on which straightforward ‘interactions’or ‘adaptations’ can be analysed (Blute, 2008). Rather we aim here to elucidate the contributions of relational geographies, sometimes referred to as more than <b>human</b> <b>geographies,</b> to the understanding of human plant relation...|$|R

25|$|Since {{there is}} a {{selection}} process used to gain admission to the TAG Magnet; and, since one of the definitions of a TAG student is a national-norm reading score of “80” or higher, the school does not have students who read below grade level. However, since TAG requires an AP course (AP <b>Human</b> <b>Geography)</b> as freshman, the school does have {{students who do not}} read well enough to tackle a college-level course in their first year of high school. These students are referred to the Student Support Team (SST) for review. This leads to a parent-teacher-student conference attended by both the counselor and the principal. Parent, student, and teacher agree to work together as they check on progress achieved through tutoring before and after school. In some cases, additional projects are assigned to improve reading skills.|$|E
25|$|The {{campus is}} {{primarily}} an undergraduate institution, thus it attracts the most direct-entry applicants from secondary schools among the university's three campuses. The campus has 13 academic departments: the Department of Anthropology, the Department of Arts, Culture and Media, the Department of Biological Sciences, the Department of Computer and Mathematical Sciences, the Department of English, the Department of Historical and Cultural Studies, the Department of <b>Human</b> <b>Geography,</b> the Department of Management, the Department of Philosophy, the Department of Physical & Environmental Sciences, the Department of Political Science, the Department of Psychology and the Department of Sociology. Two extra-departmental units are the French and Linguistics and Centre for Critical Development Studies. Students are diversified among concentrations that are specialist degrees, {{as well as}} the common majors and minors. The cooperative education programs, which place students for up to three semesters in workplaces pertaining to their field of study, are unique to the campus in the University of Toronto. Joint programs with Centennial College, that award both a university degree and a college diploma, are offered in journalism, new media, paramedicine, industrial microbiology, and environmental science.
