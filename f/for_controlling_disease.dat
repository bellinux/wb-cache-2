As a matter of fact, many models ignored the spatial mobility of cells and viruses. Recently, many authors argued that the virus moves freely in body and follows the Fickian diffusion (see [31]) and investigated the global stability properties of virus infection models with diffusion in [8, 22 – 28, 31].

40|$|Clearance {{or control}} of {{pathogens}} or tumors usually requires T-cell-mediated immunity. As such, understanding the mechanisms {{that govern the}} function, maintenance, and persistence of T cells will likely lead to new treatments <b>for</b> <b>controlling</b> <b>disease.</b> During an immune response, T-cell development is marked by striking changes in metabolism. There is a growing appreciation that these metabolic changes underlie the capacity of T cells to perform particular functions, and {{this has led to}} a recent focus on the idea that the manipulation of cellular metabolism can be used to shape adaptive immune responses. Although interest in this area has grown in the last few years, a full understanding of the metabolic control of T-cell functions, particularly during an immune response in vivo, is still lacking.

The authors present the distribution of schistosomiasis intermediary hosts in Brazil, the migration routes of the human population, and disease distribution in highly and lowly endemic areas and isolated foci. They also analyze the controlling programs developed from 1977 to 2002, indicating the prevalence evolution and the reduction of disease morbi-mortality. In addition, the authors also evaluate controlling methods and conclude that: (a) no isolated method is able to control schistosomiasis, and every controlling program should consider the need of a multidisciplinary application of existing methods; (b) in long term, basic sanitation, potable water supply, as well as sanitary education, and community effective participation are important for infection control; (c) in short term, specific treatment at endemic areas, associated with control of intermediary hosts at epidemiologically important foci, are extremely relevant <b>for</b> <b>controlling</b> <b>disease</b> morbidity, although not enough for interrupting infection transmission...|$|E

40|$|International audienceBackground: Leiomyosarcoma (LMS) of the {{inferior}} vena cava (IVC) {{is a rare}} tumor with poor prognosis. Optimal treatment includes complete resection of the malignant lesion. Methods: From 1997 to 2013, eight patients underwent surgery in our department for IVC LMS. LMS was considered to arise from the IVC if the tumor presented intraluminal development or if complete resection (R 0) required removal of part of the IVC with an extraluminal mass. Results: There were two grade 1 tumors (25 %), four grade 2 (50 %) and two grade 3 (25 %). The median length of stay was 16 days {{and there were no}} peri-operative deaths. Median of follow-up was 56 months and mean overall survival was 120 months. Mean 3 -year survival rate was 87. 5 %. Six patients (75 %) developed a local recurrence. Four patients died from disease progression. Two patients underwent to surgery for recurrence. Conclusion: IVC LMS have a poor prognosis if surgical resection cannot be achieved. Long-term survival is related to an extensive surgery, in the event of recurrence, surgery should again be proposed and may be effective <b>for</b> <b>controlling</b> <b>disease</b> progression, possibly improving survival.

40|$|Background Species {{identification}} is essential <b>for</b> <b>controlling</b> <b>disease,</b> understanding epidemiology, and {{to guide the}} implementation of phytosanitary measures against fungi from the genus Diaporthe. Accurate Diaporthe species separation requires using multi-loci phylogenies. However, defining the optimal set of loci {{that can be used}} for species {{identification is}} still an open problem. Methods Here we addressed that problem by identifying five loci that have been sequenced in 142 Diaporthe isolates representing 96 species: TEF 1, TUB, CAL, HIS and ITS. We then used every possible combination of those loci to build, analyse, and compare phylogenetic trees. Results As expected, species separation is better when all five loci are simultaneously used to build the phylogeny of the isolates. However, removing the ITS locus has little effect on reconstructed phylogenies, identifying the TEF 1 -TUB-CAL-HIS 4 -loci tree as almost equivalent to the 5 -loci tree. We further identify the best 3 -loci, 2 -loci, and 1 -locus trees that should be used for species separation in the genus. Discussion Our results question the current use of the ITS locus for DNA barcoding in the genus Diaporthe and suggest that TEF 1 might be a better choice if one locus barcoding needs to be done...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Group B {{streptococcus}} is {{a leading}} cause of neonatal pneumonia, septicaemia and meningitis. Up to one quarter of women in labour are now given intravenous antibiotics to prevent early-onset disease by the organism, a situation that will remain constant until a successful vaccine is available. From a molecular understanding of the pathogenicity of group B streptococcus {{we may be able to}} devise novel means <b>for</b> <b>controlling</b> <b>disease,</b> such as identifying inhibitors of key metabolic pathways or regulatory networks. This review summarizes our post-genomic knowledge of the regulation, metabolism and virulence of group B streptococcus. RECENT FINDINGS: Although advances have been made in the understanding of classic group B streptococcus virulence traits, such as capsular polysaccharide, beta-haemolysin, C 5 a peptidase, adhesins and immunogenic surface proteins, the major recent contribution to group B streptococcus pathogenesis has been the whole genome sequencing of three group B streptococcus strains, representing serotypes Ia, III and V. From these genomes, we not only see where the classic virulence genes map, but we can also gain insights into the metabolism and regulation of the organism and how these affect its virulence. SUMMARY: Knowledge of virulence factors and the organism's metabolism and gene regulation offers opportunities to find novel means of preventing group B streptococcus infection in babies...|$|E

40|$|Genetic {{approaches}} <b>for</b> <b>controlling</b> <b>disease</b> vectors have aimed {{either to}} reduce wild-type populations or to replace wild-type populations with insects that cannot transmit pathogens. Here, we propose a Reduce and Replace (R&R) strategy in which released insects have both female-killing and anti-pathogen genes. We develop {{a mathematical model}} to numerically explore release strategies involving an R&R strain of the dengue vector Aedes aegypti. We show that repeated R&R releases {{may lead to a}} temporary decrease in mosquito population density and, in the absence of fitness costs associated with the anti-pathogen gene, a long-term decrease in competent vector population density. We find that R&R releases more rapidly reduce the transient and long-term competent vector densities than female-killing releases alone. We show that releases including R&R females lead to greater reduction in competent vector density than male-only releases. The magnitude of reduction in total and competent vectors depends upon the release ratio, release duration, and whether females are included in releases. Even when the anti-pathogen allele has a fitness cost, R&R releases lead to greater reduction in competent vectors than female-killing releases during the release period; however, continued releases are needed to maintain low density of competent vectors long-term. We discuss the results of the model as motivation for more detaile...|$|E
40|$|Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is {{a devastating}} animal disease. Strategies for {{differentiation}} of infected from vaccinated animals (DIVA) remain very important <b>for</b> <b>controlling</b> <b>disease.</b> Development of an epitope-deleted marker vaccine and accompanying diagnostic method {{will improve the}} efficiency of DIVA. Here, a monoclonal antibody (Mab) was found to recognize a conserved "AEKNPLE" epitope spanning amino acids 109 - 115 of non-structural protein (NSP) 3 A of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV; O/Tibet/CHA/ 99 strain), which could be deleted by a reverse-genetic procedure. In addition, a blocking ELISA was developed based on this Mab against NSP 3 A, which {{could serve as a}} matching test for a negative-marker vaccine. The criterion of this blocking ELISA was determined by detecting panels of sera from different origins. The serum samples with a percentage inhibition (PI) equal or greater than 50 % were considered to be from infected animals, and those with < 50 % PI were considered to be from non-infected animals. This test showed similar performance when compared with other 2 blocking ELISAs based on an anti-NSP 3 B Mab. This is the first report of the DIVA test for an NSP antibody based on an Mab against the conserved and predominant "AEKNPLE" epitope in NSP 3 A of FMDV...|$|E
40|$|To {{overcome}} {{burden of}} mosquito-borne diseases, multiple control strategies are needed. Population replacement with genetically modified mosquitoes carrying antipathogen effector genes {{is one of}} the possible approaches <b>for</b> <b>controlling</b> <b>disease</b> transmission. However, transgenic mosquitoes with antipathogen phenotypes based on overexpression of a single type effector molecule are not efficient in interrupting pathogen transmission. Here, we show that co-overexpression of two antimicrobial peptides (AMP), Cecropin A, and Defensin A, in transgenic Aedes aegypti mosquitoes results in the cooperative antibacterial and antiPlasmodium action of these AMPs. The transgenic hybrid mosquitoes that overexpressed both Cecropin A and Defensin A {{under the control of the}} vitellogenin promoter exhibited an elevated resistance to Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection, indicating that these AMPs acted cooperatively against this pathogenic bacterium. In these mosquitoes infected with P. gallinaceum, the number of oocysts was dramatically reduced in midguts, and no sporozoites were found in their salivary glands when the mosquitoes were fed twice to reactivate transgenic AMP production. Infection experiments using the transgenic hybrid mosquitoes, followed by sequential feeding on naive chicken, and then naive wild-type mosquitoes showed that the Plasmodium transmission was completely blocked. This study suggests an approach in generating transgenic mosquitoes with antiPlasmodium refractory phenotype, which is coexpression of two or more effector molecules with cooperative action on the parasite...|$|E

40|$|African green monkeys (AGM) {{and other}} natural hosts for simian {{immunodeficiency}} virus (SIV) do not develop an AIDS-like disease following SIV infection. To evaluate differences {{in the role of}} SIV-specific adaptive immune responses between natural and nonnatural hosts, we used SIV(agmVer 90) to infect vervet AGM and pigtailed macaques (PTM). This infection results in robust viral replication in both vervet AGM and pigtailed macaques (PTM) but only induces AIDS in the latter species. We delayed the development of adaptive immune responses through combined administration of anti-CD 8 and anti-CD 20 lymphocyte-depleting antibodies during primary infection of PTM (n = 4) and AGM (n = 4), and compared these animals to historical controls infected with the same virus. Lymphocyte depletion resulted in a 1 -log increase in primary viremia and a 4 -log increase in post-acute viremia in PTM. Three of the four PTM had to be euthanized within 6 weeks of inoculation due to massive CMV reactivation and disease. In contrast, all four lymphocyte-depleted AGM remained healthy. The lymphocyte-depleted AGM showed only a trend toward a prolongation in peak viremia but the groups were indistinguishable during chronic infection. These data show that adaptive immune responses are critical <b>for</b> <b>controlling</b> <b>disease</b> progression in pathogenic SIV infection in PTM. However, the maintenance of a disease-free course of SIV infection in AGM likely depends on a number of mechanisms including non-adaptive immune mechanisms...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE—To {{evaluate}} methotrexate {{treatment in}} patients with active adult onset Still's disease (AOSD).  METHODS—Methotrexate was initially given as a single weekly oral dose of 5  mg and adjusted individually afterwards in 13  patients with active AOSD. Symptoms and laboratory findings were investigated.  RESULTS—Signs of AOSD activity disappeared (remission) in eight patients between 3  and 16  weeks after starting methotrexate. In these patients, significant improvements in C reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, white blood count, and serum ferritin were observed at 8,  12,  14, and 16  weeks after starting methotrexate, respectively. In six of these eight patients, steroids or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs could be reduced or discontinued. In four patients methotrexate was not effective despite 12  or 16  weeks of treatment, and one patient discontinued treatment after 2  weeks because of severe nausea. Five patients suffered from adverse reactions, including acute interstitial pneumonia (one patient) and liver toxicity (two patients). Five out of eight patients successfully treated with methotrexate were HLA-DR 4 positive (four homozygotes), and all the unsuccessfully treated patients were DR 2 positive.  CONCLUSIONS—Methotrexate is useful <b>for</b> <b>controlling</b> <b>disease</b> activity in AOSD, not only for refractory patients but also for patients who have never taken steroids or for those with steroid associated toxicity. However, serious adverse reactions can occur, as with rheumatoid arthritis. It is important to determine the critical factors, such as the immunogenetic background, {{that are associated with}} response to methotrexate treatment. ...|$|E
40|$|Influenza virus {{neuraminidase}} (NA) plays {{a crucial}} role in facilitating the spread of newly synthesized virus in the host and is an important target <b>for</b> <b>controlling</b> <b>disease</b> progression. The NA crystal structure from the 1918 “Spanish flu ” (A/Brevig Mission/ 1 / 18 H 1 N 1) and that of its complex with zanamivir (Relenza) at 1. 65 -Å and 1. 45 -Å resolutions, respectively, corroborated the successful expression of correctly folded NA tetramers in a baculovirus expression system. An additional cavity adjacent to the substrate-binding site is observed in N 1, compared to N 2 and N 9 NAs, including H 5 N 1. This cavity arises from an open conformation of the 150 loop (Gly 147 to Asp 151) and appears to be conserved among group 1 NAs (N 1, N 4, N 5, and N 8). It closes upon zanamivir binding. Three calcium sites were identified, including a novel site that may be conserved in N 1 and N 4. Thus, these high-resolution structures, combined with our recombinant expression system, provide new opportunities to augment the limited arsenal of therapeutics against influenza. Influenza virus is highly contagious and can cause severe respiratory illness and death. Of the three types of influenza virus, type A infects a wide range of avian and mammalian species and can be further classified into subtypes according to the serological reactivity of its surface glycoprotein antigens...|$|E
40|$|<b>Disease</b> <b>control</b> by {{managers}} is {{a crucial}} response to emerging wildlife epidemics, yet the means of control may be limited by the method of disease transmission. In particular, it is widely held that population reduction, while effective <b>for</b> <b>controlling</b> <b>diseases</b> that are subject to density-dependent (DD) transmission, is ineffective <b>for</b> <b>controlling</b> <b>diseases</b> that are subject to frequency-dependent (FD) transmission. We investigate <b>control</b> <b>for</b> horizontally transmitted <b>diseases</b> with FD transmission where the control is via culling or harvest that is non-selective with respect to infection and the population can compensate through DD recruitment or survival. Using a mathematical model, we show that culling or harvesting can eradicate the disease, even when transmission dynamics are FD. Eradication can be achieved under FD transmission when DD birth or recruitment induces compensatory growth of new, healthy individuals, which has {{the net effect of}} reducing disease prevalence by dilution. We also show that if harvest is used simultaneously with vaccination, and there is high enough transmission coefficient, application of both controls may be less efficient than vaccination alone. We illustrate the effects of these <b>control</b> approaches on <b>disease</b> prevalence for chronic wasting disease in deer where the disease is transmitted directly among deer and through the environment...|$|R
