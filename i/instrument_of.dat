5|$|Patel and Menon {{backed up}} their {{diplomatic}} efforts by producing treaties {{that were designed}} to be attractive to rulers of princely states. Two key documents were produced. The first was the Standstill Agreement, which confirmed the continuance of the pre-existing agreements and administrative practices. The second was the <b>Instrument</b> <b>of</b> Accession, by which the ruler of the princely state in question agreed to the accession of his kingdom to independent India, granting the latter control over specified subject matters. The nature of the subject matters varied depending on the acceding state. The states which had internal autonomy under the British signed an <b>Instrument</b> <b>of</b> Accession which only ceded three subjects {{to the government of}} India—defence, external affairs, and communications, each defined in accordance with List 1 to Schedule VII of the Government of India Act 1935.

Rulers of states which had an intermediate status signed a third type of Instrument, which preserved the degree of power they had under the British.|$|E
