Craigavon (a name unpopular with the Nationalist community) was designated as a new town in 1965, intended to be a linear city incorporating the neighbouring towns of Lurgan and Portadown. The plan largely failed, and today, 'Craigavon' locally refers to the rump of the residential area between the two towns. The Craigavon development, however, did affect Lurgan in a number of ...|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} imperatives of {{effective}} management of customers’ relationship marketing for efficient operations in <b>industrial</b> <b>marketing</b> organizations. Structured questionnaire was employed {{in the course of}} gathering relevant data for the study and administered on ninety senior employees of six <b>industrial</b> <b>marketing</b> organizations in Delta State. Data analysis was made using simple percentage and table. The results show that there is positive relationship between effective management of customers relationship marketing and efficient operations in <b>industrial</b> <b>marketing</b> organizations. The study therefore concludes that effective management of customers’ relationship marketing creates opportunities for <b>industrial</b> <b>marketing</b> organizations to gain competitive advantage, improvement in profitability and cost reductions.

40|$|<b>Industrial</b> <b>marketing</b> {{planning}} {{is a typical}} example of an unstructured decision making problem due to {{the large number of}} variables to consider and the uncertainty imposed on those variables. Although abundant studies identified barriers and facilitators of effective <b>industrial</b> <b>marketing</b> planning in practice, the literature still lacks practical tools and methods that marketing managers can use for the task. This paper applies fuzzy cognitive maps (FCM) to <b>industrial</b> <b>marketing</b> planning. In particular, agent based inference method is proposed to overcome dynamic relationships, time lags, and reusability issues of FCM evaluation. MACOM simulator also is developed to help marketing managers conduct what-if scenarios to see the impacts of possible changes on the variables defined in an FCM that represents <b>industrial</b> <b>marketing</b> planning problem. The simulator is applied to an <b>industrial</b> <b>marketing</b> planning problem for a global software service company in South Korea. This study has practical implication as it supports <b>marketing</b> managers for <b>industrial</b> <b>marketing</b> planning that has large number of variables and their cause–effect relationships. It also contributes to FCM theory by providing an agent based method for the inference of FCM. Finally, MACOM also provides academics in the <b>industrial</b> <b>marketing</b> management discipline with a tool for developing and pre-verifying a conceptual model based on qualitative knowledge of marketing practitioners...|$|R
2500|$|Certain {{requirements}} {{must be met}} {{for recycling}} to be economically feasible and environmentally effective. These include an adequate source of recyclates, a system to extract those recyclates from the waste stream, a nearby factory capable of reprocessing the recyclates, and a potential demand for the recycled products. These last two requirements are often overlooked—without both an <b>industrial</b> <b>market</b> for production using the collected materials and a consumer market for the manufactured goods, recycling is incomplete and in fact only [...] "collection".|$|E
2500|$|Like most single-industry towns, Fernie endured several boom-and-bust cycles {{throughout}} the twentieth century, generally {{tied to the}} global price of coal. The mines at Coal Creek closed permanently by 1960 and the focus of mining activity shifted to Michel and Natal about [...] upriver, which sat on a more productive portion of the Crowsnest Coal Field. Kaiser Resources opened immense open-pit mines there in the 1970s to meet new thermal coal contracts for the Asian <b>industrial</b> <b>market,</b> predominantly for use in blast furnaces. Fernie would remain an important residential base for mine labour, along with the new communities of Sparwood and Elkford that sprang up much closer to these new mines. Today, Teck Resources operates all five open-pit mines, shipping out unit trains (often with more than 100 cars) along the Canadian Pacific Railway through Fernie to the Pacific Coast, where the coal is loaded onto freighters at Roberts Bank Superport in Delta.|$|E

40|$|I propose three {{explanations}} of <b>industrial</b> <b>markets</b> as social systems. <b>Industrial</b> <b>marketing</b> researchers have long recognised {{the question of}} bounds to markets and marketing activities, drawing on focal firms and also <b>industrial</b> <b>markets</b> as embedded social systems. This in effect highlights at least five units of analysis: individual, firm, relationship, network and (sometimes implicitly) environment. Luhmann proposes a general theory of social systems that are distinct from environments and have on-going properties in communications through autopoiesis. However, Luhmann sees markets, in general and abstract senses, as neutral boundary or horizon conditions, captured in the mass or generalised symbolic media of money.
