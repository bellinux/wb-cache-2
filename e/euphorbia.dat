5|$|The park's {{predominant}} {{environment is}} open grass plain with scattered Acacia bushes. The western uplands {{of the park}} have highland dry forest with stands of Olea africana, Croton dichogamus, Brachylaena hutchinsii, and Calodendrum. The lower slopes of these areas are grassland. Themeda, cypress, Digitaria, and Cynodon species are found in these grassland areas. There are also scattered yellow-barked Acacia xanthophloea. There is a riverine forest along the permanent river {{in the south of}} the park. There are areas of broken bush and deep rocky valleys and gorges within the park. The species in the valleys are predominantly Acacia and <b>Euphorbia</b> candelabrum. Other tree species include Apodytes dimidiata, Canthium schimperiana, Elaeodendron buchananii, Ficus eriocarpa, Aspilia mossambicensis, Rhus natalensis, and Newtonia species. Several plants that grow on the rocky hillsides are unique to the Nairobi area. These species include <b>Euphorbia</b> brevitorta, Drimia calcarata, and Murdannia clarkeana.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{effects of}} plant fertilisation regime on herbivore and parasitoid performance for two aphids, Macrosiphum <b>euphorbiae</b> and Myzus persicae, and one parasitoid wasp, Aphidius ervi. Herbivore performance was measured as adult fresh weight and intrinsic rate of increase. Parasitoid performance was measured as length of hind tibia, sex ratio, {{and in a}} series of choice experiments also parasitoid development time and parasitization rate was measured. Comparisons were made between the performance of M. <b>euphorbiae</b> on two different plant species, petunia and sweet pepper, between the performance of the aphids M. <b>euphorbiae</b> and M. persicae on sweet pepper, and between the performance of A. ervi in M. <b>euphorbiae</b> and in M. persicae on sweet pepper. The performance of M. <b>euphorbiae</b> was better on petunia than on sweet pepper. On petunia a positive effect of plant content of potassium and indications of a positive effect of nitrogen fertilisation were found while on sweet pepper both nitrogen and of potassium had negative influence. On both plant species, however, a negative influence of sulphur was found. The two aphid species reacted differently to fertilisation and plant content of nutrients. For M. <b>euphorbiae</b> fresh weight was decreased by fertilisation while for M. persicae the influence varied with experiment. For M. persicae a high N:K ratio was favourable while for M. <b>euphorbiae</b> plant contents of N and K were both negative. Plant content of sulphur and potassium influenced tibia length of A. ervi positively in M. <b>euphorbiae.</b> In M. persicae plant fertilisation was positive but the composition of the plant fertilisation did not seem important for the parasitoid. Plant fertilisation enhanced parasitization rate in M. <b>euphorbiae</b> but not in M. persicae. Parasitoid performance was, however, more improved by fertilisation in M. persicae than in M. <b>euphorbiae.</b> The parasitoid both preferred, and developed faster in, M. persicae compared to M. <b>euphorbiae.</b> The results of this study show {{that it is possible to}} influence both aphid performance and performance of A. ervi with plant fertilisation but the influence varies with both plant and aphid species...|$|R

5|$|A 1994 {{study of}} the nilgai's diet in the Sariska Reserve {{revealed}} its preference for herbs and grasses; grasses became {{more important in the}} rainy season, while during winter and summer it fed additionally on flowers (Butea monosperma), foliage (Anogeissus pendula, Capparis sepiaria, Grewia flavescens and Zizyphus mauritiana), pods (Acacia nilotica, A. catechu and A. leucophloea) and fruits (Zizyphus mauritiana). Preferred grass species include Cenchrus species, Cynodon dactylon, Desmostachya bipinnata, Scirpus tuberosus and Vetiveria zizanoides. Woody plants eaten include Acacia nilotica, A. senegal, A. leucophloea, Clerodendrum phlomidis, Crotalaria burhia, Indigofera oblongifolia, Morus alba and Zizyphus nummularia; herbs favoured are Cocculus hirsutus, <b>Euphorbia</b> hirta and Sida rhombifolia.

Here, we compare the nymphal mortality, the pre-reproductive development time, and the probing behavior of M. persicae and M. <b>euphorbiae</b> on S. stoloniferum and Solanum tuberosum L. Furthermore, we analyze the changes in gene expression in S. stoloniferum 96 hours post infestation by either aphid species. Although the M. <b>euphorbiae</b> probing behavior shows that aphids encounter more probing constrains on phloem activitieslonger probing and salivation time on S. stoloniferum than on S. tuberosum, the aphids succeeded in reaching a sustained ingestion of phloem sap on both plants. Probing by M. persicae on S. stoloniferum plants resulted in limited feeding only. Survival of M. <b>euphorbiae</b> and M. persicae was affected on young leaves, but not on senescent leaves of S. stoloniferum. Infestation by M. <b>euphorbiae</b> changed the expression of more genes than M. persicae did. At the systemic level both aphids elicited a weak response. Infestation of S. stoloniferum plants {{with a large number}} of M. persicae induced morphological changes in the leaves, leading to the development of pustules that were caused by disrupted vascular parenchyma and surrounding tissue. In contrast, an infestation by M. <b>euphorbiae</b> had no morphological effects. Both plant species can be regarded as good host for M. <b>euphorbiae,</b> whereas only S. tuberosum is a good host for M. persicae and S. stoloniferum is not.

5|$|Animals {{adapted to}} live in deserts are called xerocoles. There is no {{evidence}} that body temperature of mammals and birds is adaptive to the different climates, either of great heat or cold. In fact, with a very few exceptions, their basal metabolic rate is determined by body size, irrespective of the climate in which they live. Many desert animals (and plants) show especially clear evolutionary adaptations for water conservation or heat tolerance and so are often studied in comparative physiology, ecophysiology, and evolutionary physiology. One well-studied example is the specializations of mammalian kidneys shown by desert-inhabiting species. Many examples of convergent evolution have been identified in desert organisms, including between cacti and <b>Euphorbia,</b> kangaroo rats and jerboas, Phrynosoma and Moloch lizards.|$|E
5|$|In the Sahara, 332 {{plant species}} have been {{recorded}} as food plants of the dromedary. These include Aristida pungens, Acacia tortilis, Panicum turgidum, Launaea arborescens and Balanites aegyptiaca. The dromedary eats Acacia, Atriplex and Salsola when they are available. Feral dromedaries in Australia prefer Trichodesma zeylanicum and <b>Euphorbia</b> tannensis. In India, dromedaries are fed with forage plants such as Vigna aconitifolia, V. mungo, Cyamopsis tetragonolaba, Melilotus parviflora, Eruca sativa, Trifolium species and Brassica campestris. Dromedaries keep their mouths open while chewing thorny food. They use their lips to grasp the food and chew each bite 40 to 50 times. Its long eyelashes, eyebrows, lockable nostrils, caudal opening of the prepuce and a relatively small vulva help the camel avoid injuries, especially while feeding.

5|$|The {{natural range}} of A.vera is unclear, as the species {{has been widely}} {{cultivated}} around the world.

This distribution is somewhat {{similar to that of}} <b>Euphorbia</b> balsamifera, Pistacia atlantica, and a few others, suggesting that a dry sclerophyll forest once covered large areas, but has been dramatically reduced due to desertification in the Sahara, leaving these few patches isolated.

5|$|Part of the {{disparity}} in genus sizes is attributable to historical factors. According to a hypothesis published by Max Walters in 1961, the size of plant genera {{is related to the}} age, not of the taxon itself, but of the concept of the taxon in the minds of taxonomists. Plants which grew in Europe, where most of the early taxonomy was based, were therefore divided into relatively small genera, while those from the tropics were grouped into much larger and more heterogeneous genera. Likewise, plants which shared common medicinal properties, such as the many species of <b>Euphorbia,</b> were united into a single genus, while plants of diverse uses, such as the grasses, were split into many genera. Where there were many classical names for groups of plants, such as in Apiaceae / Umbelliferae or Brassicaceae / Cruciferae, small genera were defined, whereas groups not subdivided by classical authors remained as larger genera, such as Carex. A number of biological factors also influence the number of species. For instance, the occurrence of apomixis allows the recognition of large numbers of agamospecies, and such taxa have helped to bolster genera such as Ranunculus and Potentilla.|$|E

40|$|Aphid species {{feeding on}} lettuce occupy {{distinct}} feeding sites: the lettuce aphid Nasonovia ribisnigri prefers {{to feed on}} heart leaves, whereas the potato aphid Macrosiphum <b>euphorbiae</b> feeds only on outer leaves. The aphid parasitoid Aphelinus abdominalis, known {{to be able to}} regulate M. <b>euphorbiae</b> on many crops, has recently been indicated as a promising biocontrol candidate also for use against N. ribisnigri, a major pest of lettuce. This study therefore examined A. abdominalis parasitization preference between N. ribisnigri and M. <b>euphorbiae</b> and its ability to parasitize aphids feeding on different parts of lettuce plants. In addition, life history traits of A. abdominalis on these aphid species were investigated. In no-choice laboratory experiments on leaf discs and 24 h exposure, A. abdominalis successfully parasitized 54 % and 60 % of the offered N. ribisnigri and M. <b>euphorbiae,</b> respectively, with no significant difference. In the corresponding choice experiment, however, A. abdominalis had a tendency for a significantly higher preference for M. <b>euphorbiae</b> (38 %) compared to N. ribisnigri (30 %). Growth chamber experiments on whole plants demonstrated that A. abdominalis was able to parasitize aphids, regardless of their feeding locations on lettuce plants. However, aphid feeding behavior had a significant effect on the parasitization rate. A. abdominalis parasitized significantly higher percentages of M. <b>euphorbiae</b> or N. ribisnigri when aphids were exposed separately to parasitoids on whole lettuce plants as compared with N. ribisnigri exposed only on heart leaf. A significant preference of A. abdominalis for M. <b>euphorbiae</b> compared to N. ribisnigri was also observed in the growth chamber choice experiment.
