40|$|The study {{pertains}} to the economic issues of risk and uncertainties associated with financing <b>hill</b> <b>agriculture</b> from the twin angles of risk of farmers to utilize the credit and of bankers to disburse the agricultural loan. The issues discussed are: first, why the financial institutions are reluctant to lend agricultural advances? Second, whether the farm income or {{rate of return on}} equity and non-equity capital is sufficient to repay the loan? Third, what are the major sources and the magnitude of risks and uncertainties associated with hill farming? Fourth, nature of agricultural marketing situation and how it affects the farm income in this region and finally, the possibilities have been explored, where and how the agricultural lending can be stepped up with positive economic return? The study has revealed that agricultural farming in north-east region of India is severely constrained by high risk and uncertainty arising out from various factors. Under the prevailing condition the expectation of a steady and assured income from agriculture is quite limited; hence, the hill farming fails to attract considerable private investment. The prevailing risk and uncertainty situation compels them to operate at low-input and low-output subsistence farming with low volume of marketable surplus. It has been found that the financial institutions face difficulty in financing the <b>hill</b> <b>agriculture</b> in view of low repayment performance and increasing non-performing assets for agricultural loan. Also, the absence/poor performance of crop insurance scheme (presently only Meghalaya and Sikkim are implementing the National Agricultural Insurance Scheme) increases the risk of hill farming considerably. Non-availability of reliable agricultural database (time series as well as cross section) on area, production and yield, cost of cultivation has been found the major impediments for implementing the crop insurance scheme efficiently. The agricultural situation in this region is highly heterogeneous; variability is extremely high even within a few kilometres of area. It has been suggested that suitable methodologies followed by a wide database be developed to estimate the yield and cost of production of horticultural crops which will help policymakers to formulate right policy to protect the interest of farmers as well as smooth functioning of all stakeholders â€” entrepreneurs, private investors, bankers and crop insurance implementing agencies.

30|$|The Indian Himalayan {{region is}} home to about 51 million people, many of whom {{practice}} <b>hill</b> <b>agriculture</b> in fragile and diverse ecosystems, including species-rich forests. The region has a considerable hydropower potential and feeds numerous perennial rivers which depend upon the sustainable existence of glaciers (GoI 2010, DST 2012). Due to its high biological and socio-cultural diversity, the region {{has been identified as}} one of 34 “biological hotspots” by Gautam et al. (2013). The fragile landscapes of the Himalayan region are highly susceptible to natural hazards, and there is ongoing concern about current and potential climate change impacts which may include abnormal floods, droughts and landslides (Barnett et al. 2005; Cruz et al. 2007), loss of biodiversity and threats to food security (Xu et al. 2009). In order to fulfil India’s vision of sustainable development in the context of climate change, a National Action Plan on Climate Change was launched in June 2008. This National Action Plan includes eight specific objectives, including a “National Mission for Sustaining the Himalayan Eco-systems” and a “National Mission on Strategic Knowledge for Climate Change”.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The Indian Himalayas occupy {{an area of}} 53. 7 Mha that {{constitutes}} 16. 4 % of the total geographical area (329 Mha) of the country. The region supports a large human population which draws heavily for various products from nearby forested areas and from degraded community forest areas for fodder, fire wood, timber, non-wood forest produce etc. Agriculture is primarily rainfed and water harvesting mechanisms occur in limited situations. Scientific land use and watershed development {{is an integral part}} of the strategy to develop rainfed agriculture which has tremendous potential in the Himalayas. Since <b>hill</b> <b>agriculture</b> is primarily rainfed, increasing crop productivity along with sustainable development and natural resource conservation are the major objectives of these programs. Evaluation of watersheds that were implemented through the National Watershed Development Project for Rainfed areas (NWDPRA) was carried out in two Central Himalayan watersheds, by purposive sampling with single stage stratification. Data were analyzed using partial budgeting techniques. In both the locations crop diversification has taken place with new cash crops like peas, ginger, colocasia etc, which have been introduced through watershed interventions. The are...|$|E
