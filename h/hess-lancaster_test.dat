The goal of SEE-GRID is to extend SEE++ in several steps in order to develop an efficient grid-based tool for “Evidence Based Medicine”, which supports surgeons in choosing optimal surgery techniques for the treatment of certain eye motility disorders. First, we have developed a grid-enabled version of the simulation of the <b>Hess-Lancaster</b> <b>test,</b> which is a medical examination by which the pathology of the patient can be estimated. Based on this, we work on a pathology fitting algorithm that attempts to give sufficiently close estimations for the pathological reasons of the disorder. Furthermore, we have started to develop a grid enabled distributed database where both real and simulated pathological cases can be collected, sorted and evaluated for improving both the later pathology fitting calculations and the future medical treatments. 1...|$|E
40|$|Summary: Possibilities of {{treatment}} of diplopia when suffering from paralitic strabismus {{with the use}} of conservative methods Purpose The aim of this thesis is to assess the effectiveness of ambulant pleoptic-ortoptic exercises complemented by domiciliary rehabilitation using specially adapted software - applied to patiens with suddenly occured eye movement disorder and diplopia. Methods Representative sample was composed od 86 adult patients suffering from sudden eye movement disorder and diplopia, containing 33 rehabilitating ones in treatment group and 53 not rehabilitating patients in control group. The eye movement disorder was caused by cerebrovascular accident, craniocerebral injury or vascular disease. All the patients underwent complex eye and ortoptic examination as well as objectification of the eye movement disorder and diplopia by <b>Hess-Lancaster</b> <b>test.</b> Both treatment and control group have been observed for 3 - 6 months. Results An average improvement of 96. 8 % (P ≤ 0, 01) was reached in the treatment group - in case of the extent of horizontal deviation of strabismus (for rehabilitating adults having the infliction n. VI of one eye). In the control group 28. 1 % (P ≤ 0, 00001) was noticed. The patients having the infliction n. III and n. IV of one eye improved of 73. 7 % (P ≤ 0, 0008) in the [...] ...|$|E
40|$|JKU/RISC {{currently}} {{develops in}} cooperation with Upper Austrian Research (UAR) the SEE-GRID software system. SEE-GRID {{is based on the}} SEE++ software for the biomechanical 3 D simulation of the human eye and its muscles. SEE++ simulates the common eye muscle surgery techniques in a graphic interactive way that is familiar to an experienced surgeon. SEE++ is world-wide the most advanced software for this purpose; it is used by various hospitals and medical doctors for surgery training and planning, SEE++ deals with the support of diagnosis and treatment of strabismus, which is the common name given to usually persistent or regularly occuring misalignment of the eyes. Strabismus is a visual defect in which eyes point in different directions. A person suffering from it may see double images due to misaligned eyes. SEE++ is able to simulate the result of the <b>Hess-Lancaster</b> <b>test,</b> from which the pathological reason of strabismus can be estimated. The outcome of such an examination is two gaze patterns of blue points and of red points respectively. The blue points represent the image seen by one eye and the red pointsthe image seen by the simulated other eye, but in a pathological situation there is a deviation between the blue and the red points. In SEE++, a third gaze pattern, a measured one (with green points) of a patient can be given as input. In this case, SEE++ takes some default or estimated eye data and modifies a subset of them until the calculated gaze pattern of the simulated eye (red points) matches the measured gaze pattern. This procedure is called pathology fitting. The current algorithm is time consuming and gives only a more or less precise estimation for the pathology of the patient. Doctors want to see quickly the results from such a decision support system, but for reaching adequate response times it is not sufficient to use only local computational power. The goal of SEE-GRID is to adapt and to extend SEE++ in several steps and to develop an efficient grid-based tool for Evidence Based Medicine, which supports the surgeons to choose the best surgery techniques in case of the treatments of different syndromes of strabismus. We approach this goal in three phases: - We have implemented a parallel and grid-enabled version of the <b>Hess-Lancaster</b> <b>test</b> simulation (it is based on the Globus Toolkit at present). - We are currently developing a grid-based medical database described for storing and sorting patient data with gaze patterns and eye data. - We plan to make a gLite compatible version of SEE-GRID and then further develop it {{on the basis of the}} higher services of the EGEE-II middleware (comparedwith the low-level services of the Globus Toolkit). - We will work on a parallel grid-enabled pathology fitter algorithm.
