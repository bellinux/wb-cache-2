25|$|A beam {{of light}} {{reflects}} off a mirror at an angle of reflection equal to its angle of incidence (if {{the size of a}} mirror is much larger than the wavelength of light). That is, if the {{beam of light}} <b>is</b> <b>shining</b> on a mirror's surface, at a ° angle vertically, then it reflects from the point of incidence at a ° angle from vertically in the opposite direction. This law mathematically follows from the interference of a plane wave on a flat boundary (of much larger size than the wavelength).|$|E
25|$|The {{shape of}} Egyptian pyramids {{is thought to}} {{represent}} the primordial mound from which the Egyptians believed the earth was created. The shape of a pyramid {{is thought to be}} representative of the descending rays of the sun, and most pyramids were faced with polished, highly reflective white limestone, in order to give them a brilliant appearance when viewed from a distance. Pyramids were often also named in ways that referred to solar luminescence. For example, the formal name of the Bent Pyramid at Dahshur was The Southern Shining Pyramid, and that of Senwosret at el-Lahun was Senwosret <b>is</b> <b>Shining.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{the tomb}} of Xin Zhui, four coffins of {{decreasing}} sizes enclosed one another. The first and outermost coffin is painted black, the color of death and the underworld. All painted images sealed inside this coffin were thus designed not for an outside viewer but for the deceased and concern the themes of death and rebirth, protection in the afterlife, and immortality. The second coffin has a black background but is painted with a pattern of stylized clouds and with protective deities and auspicious animals roaming an empty universe. A tiny figure, the deceased woman, is emerging at the bottom center of the head end. Only her upper body is shown, for {{she is about to}} enter this mysterious world. The third coffin exhibits a different color scheme and iconography. It <b>is</b> <b>shining</b> red, the color of immortality, and the decorative motifs include divine animals and a winged immortal flanking three-peaked Mount Kunlun, which is a prime symbol of eternal happiness. Inside this tomb on top of the fourth and innermost coffin the excavators found a painted silk banner about two meters long.|$|E

500|$|Then it says, [...] "Lay {{down all}} thoughts, {{surrender}} to the void – it <b>is</b> <b>shining.</b> That you may see the meaning of within – it is being." [...] From birth to death all we ever do is think: we have one thought, we have another thought, another thought, another thought. Even when you are asleep you are having dreams, so there is never a time from birth to death when the mind isn't always active with thoughts. But you can turn off your mind, {{and go to the}} part which Maharishi described as: [...] "Where was your last thought before you thought it?" ...|$|E

In his single review for Melody Maker, Nick Jones wrote: [...] "Superficially it's a very 'ordinary' Beatles record without cascading sitars, and the involved, weaving hallucinogenic sounds that we've grown to love so much. However, all the Beatles soul and feeling <b>is</b> <b>shining</b> through..." [...] More impressed, Derek Johnson of the NME welcomed the simplicity of [...] "Hello, Goodbye", describing it as [...] "Supremely commercial, {{and the answer to}} those who feel The Beatles are going too way out".|$|E

[...] From the business perspective, many recognize that the move is likely to affect Google's profits. The New Republic adds that [...] "Google seems to have arrived at the same link that was obvious to Andrei Sakharov: the one between science and freedom," [...] referring to the move as [...] "heroism".|$|E

"Eighteen-year-old Britney Spears, 1999's biggest-selling new artist, spreads it {{out like}} soft cream cheese on her fourth-to-be runaway smash single, as dreamy and freash as that first spin of [...] "...Baby One More Time" [...] {{over a year}} ago. It's her first ballad, {{following}} that No. 1 debut as well as [...] "Sometimes" [...] and the recented [...] "(You Drive Me) Crazy", yet [...] "From the Bottom of My Broken Heart" [...] still possesses a breezy air that is certain to continue her breakneck success on the singles charts. Eric Forster White is at the helm this time, writing and producing a song that will easily appeal to Miss Spears' young core, {{with the potential to}} chart the more mature AC audience, too. [...] Spears' star <b>is</b> <b>shining</b> brighter than ever, and this wholesome track will only serve to illuminate it all the more. An ace." ...|$|E
500|$|The video {{starts with}} Carey {{walking in the}} rain to meet Ne-Yo who is waiting {{for her in the}} studio. Clips of Carey singing in desperation in the rain are intercut with footage of her {{recording}} her vocals in the recording booth. For his scenes, Ne-Yo sings as he stands next to as well as plays the piano as Carey reminisces by herself, while other scenes show him in the booth with Carey as they sing their parts together. At the video's climax, both singers are belt the final note in the booth, which is followed by them walking out of the studio where it has stopped raining and the sun <b>is</b> <b>shining.</b> Robbie Daw wrote that the video gave him [...] "chills". He also commented on the use of product placement of Carey's perfume M and her own brand of champagne. Melinda Newman of HitFix thought that the video appeared to have a bigger production budget than that of the video for [...] "Up Out My Face" [...] with Minaj, but noted that it was still [...] "low-key" [...] for a Carey video. Newman further commented that while the singer appears to be wearing albeit little make-up, she looked more natural and [...] "beautiful" [...] than ever. Leonie Cooper thought that the video made the [...] "bland" [...] song more appealing: [...] "the video, with a moist Mariah mithering in the rain, preposterous sequinned gold boots, a puppy in the studio, and shameless pimping of her latest perfume, kind of makes up for it." ...|$|E
500|$|The fifth song, [...] "Illuminati", was {{inspired}} after Madonna learnt {{that she was}} considered {{as one of the}} Illuminati's members. She decided to research about the real Illuminati and then wrote the song. Lyrically it refers to the Illuminati conspiracy theory, the Egyptian pyramids, the Phoenix, the Age of Enlightenment, and the Eye of Providence among others, with the chorus lyrics: [...] "It's like everybody in this party <b>is</b> <b>shining</b> like Illuminati". According to Madonna, Kanye West, who produced the track, loved the melody and changed the composition adding his own spin to it. Minaj appears on the sixth track, [...] "Bitch I'm Madonna", where she raps, asking everybody to [...] "go hard or go home", while Madonna shouts lyrics like: [...] "I just want to have fun tonight, I wanna blow up this house tonight". Produced by Diplo and Sophie, the track has a tearing sound alongside the [...] "bleepy electro" [...] and [...] "churning dubstep" [...] composition. During the writing sessions, Minaj had to rewrite the lyrics until she could get the correct sentiment Madonna wanted. [...] "Hold Tight" [...] consists of an [...] "arresting" [...] chorus and a drum beat sound, described by Sam C. Mac of Slant Magazine as: [...] "innocuous, lyrically platitudinous pop that briefly works itself up into something exciting when it threatens to become a gospelized stomp". Track eight, [...] "Joan of Arc", is a ballad in which Madonna sings about the media scrutiny of her life, singing: [...] "Each time they take a photograph, I lose a part of me I can't get back". It also references the Roman Catholic saint of the same name. Madonna's hushed, vibrato-tinged vocals, and confessional lyrics in [...] "Joan of Arc", are enhanced by a new beat instrumentation that utilizes strings and acoustic guitars in the bridge.|$|E

The article also noted that celebrity musicians paid tribute to the song as its popularity rapidly peaked in August 2007.
