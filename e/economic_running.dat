40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. It {{has been suggested that}} the lower oxygen consumption of some running athletes may be caused by differences in "running style". In an initial study of treadmill running, segmental potential and kinetic energy changes were determined using a three-dimensional fifteen-segment rigid body model of the human body. Energy expenditure was determined by expired air analysis. The more <b>economic</b> <b>running</b> patterns were characterised by variations in total body energy of lower amplitude and greater exchange of energy within and between body segments. The analytical procedures were develooed in several ways. An automated system for the breath by breath monitoring of respiratory function and energy expenditure was developed. Since expired air analysis only enables the direct measurement of the aerobic component of energy expendi ture, the validity of a commonly used method for the detection of the "anaerobic threshold" from respiratory responses was investigated. The validity of this indirect method was not supported, A generali sed energy analysis procedure was developed, allowing constraints on passive energy exchange to be varied. A method for the determination of the elastic compliance of the knee extensor muscles was devised and used to incorporate a strain energy component into the energy analysis. In a further analysis of ten athletes, energy storage in the elastic components of the knee extensors was found to be significant during the supoort phase of the running stride. The inclusion of the elastic comoonents resulted in a significant reduction of the magnitude of changes in the whole body energy curve even though the sum of the absolute changes in the partitioned energy components increased. it was found that there is some correspondance between the magnitude of passive energy transfers and the "economy" of a running style. Also, muscle elasticity appears to act as an energy conserving mechanism during the support phase, reducing both the amount of work and the work-rate required of the extensor muscles. The additional energy transfers due to elastic energy storage may account for the unusually high efficiency values previously reported for running...|$|E

There is a dearth of literature from sub-Saharan Africa on this subject. This paper examines parental control and monitoring and the implications of this on young people's sexual decision making in a rural setting in North-Western Tanzania. Methods This study employed an ethnographic research design. Data collection involved 17 focus group discussions and 46 in-depth interviews conducted with young people aged 14 - 24 years and parents/carers of young people within this age-group. Thematic analysis was conducted with the aid of NVIVO 7 software. Results Parents were motivated to control and monitor their children's behaviour for reasons such as social respectability and protecting them from undesirable sexual and reproductive health (SRH) outcomes. Parental control and monitoring varied by family structure, gender, schooling status, a young person's contribution to the <b>economic</b> <b>running</b> of the family and previous experience of a SRH outcome such as unplanned pregnancy. Children from single parent families reported that they received less control compared to those from both parent families. While a father's presence in the family seemed important in controlling the activities of young people, a mother's did not have a similar effect. Girls especially those still schooling received more supervision compared to boys. Young women who had already had unplanned pregnancy were not supervised as closely as those who hadn't. Parents employed various techniques to control and monitor their children's sexual activities. Conclusions Despite parents making efforts to control and monitor their young people's sexual behaviour, they are faced with several challenges (e. g. little time spent with their children) which make {{it difficult for them to}} effectively monitor them. There is a need for interventions such as parenting skills building that might enable parents to improve their relationships with children. This would equip parents with the appropriate skills for positive guidance and monitoring of their children and avoid inappropriate parenting behaviour.

40|$|The {{main goal}} of this work is to {{determine}} the true cost incurred by the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland in order to meet their EU renewable electricity targets. The primary all-island of Ireland policy goal is that 40 % of electricity will come from renewable sources in 2020. From this it is expected that wind generation on the Irish electricity system will be in the region of 32 - 37 % of total generation. This leads to issues resulting from wind energy being a non-synchronous, unpredictable and variable source of energy use on a scale never seen before for a single synchronous system. If changes are not made to traditional operational practices, the efficient running of the electricity system will be directly affected by these issues in the coming years. Using models of the electricity system for the all-island grid of Ireland, the effects of high wind energy penetration expected to be present in 2020 are examined. These models were developed using a unit commitment, economic dispatch tool called PLEXOS which allows for a detailed representation of the electricity system to be achieved down to individual generator level. These models replicate the true running of the electricity system through use of day-ahead scheduling and semi-relaxed use of these schedules that reflects the Transmission System Operator's of real time decision making on dispatch. In addition, it carefully considers other non-wind priority dispatch generation technologies that {{have an effect on the}} overall system. In the models developed, three main issues associated with wind energy integration were selected to be examined in detail to determine the sensitivity of assumptions presented in other studies. These three issues include wind energy's non-synchronous nature, its variability and spatial correlation, and its unpredictability. This leads to an examination of the effects in three areas: the need for system operation constraints required for system security; different onshore to offshore ratios of installed wind energy; and the degrees of accuracy in wind energy forecasting. Each of these areas directly impact the way in which the electricity system is run as they address each of the three issues associated with wind energy stated above, respectively. It is shown that assumptions in these three areas have a large effect on the results in terms of total generation costs, wind curtailment and generator technology type dispatch. In particular accounting for these issues has resulted in wind curtailment being predicted in much larger quantities than had been previously reported. This would have a large effect on wind energy companies because it is already a very low profit margin industry. Results from this work have shown that the relaxation of system operation constraints is crucial to the <b>economic</b> <b>running</b> of the electricity system with large improvements shown in the reduction of wind curtailment and system generation costs. There are clear benefits in having a proportion of the wind installed offshore in Ireland which would help to reduce variability of wind energy generation on the system and therefore reduce wind curtailment. With envisaged future improvements in day-ahead wind forecasting from 8 % to 4 % mean absolute error, there are potential reductions in wind curtailment system costs and open cycle gas turbine usage. This work illustrates the consequences of assumptions in the areas of system operation constraints, onshore/offshore installed wind capacities and accuracy in wind forecasting to better inform the true costs associated with running Ireland's changing electricity system as it continues to decarbonise into the near future. This work also proposes to illustrate, through the use of Ireland as a case study, the effects that will become ever more prevalent in other synchronous systems as they pursue a path of increasing renewable energy generation...|$|E
