5|$|Nemerteans lack {{specialized}} gills, and respiration occurs {{over the}} surface of the body, which is long and sometimes flattened. Like other animals with thick body walls, they use fluid circulation rather than diffusion to move substances through their bodies. The circulatory system consists of the rhynchocoel and peripheral vessels, while blood of other invertebrates is contained in the main body cavity. The fluid in the rhynchocoel moves substances to and from the proboscis, and functions as a fluid skeleton in <b>everting</b> the proboscis and in burrowing. The vessels circulate fluid round the whole body and the rhynchocoel provides its own local circulation. The circulatory vessels are a system of coeloms.|$|E

Platyctenids are usually cryptically colored, live on rocks, algae, or the body surfaces of other invertebrates, and are often revealed by their long tentacles with many sidebranches, seen streaming off the back of the ctenophore into the current.|$|E

500|$|The Caribbean reef shark {{feeds on}} a wide variety of reef-dwelling bony fishes and cephalopods, as well as some {{elasmobranchs}} such as eagle rays (Aetobatus narinari) and yellow stingrays (Urobatis jamaicensis). It is attracted to low-frequency sounds, which are indicative of struggling fish. In one observation of a [...] long male Caribbean reef shark hunting a yellowtail snapper (Lutjanus crysurus), the shark languidly circled and made several seemingly [...] "half-hearted" [...] turns towards its prey, before suddenly accelerating and swinging its head sideways to capture the snapper at the corner of its jaws. Young sharks feed on small fishes, shrimps, and crabs. Caribbean reef sharks are capable of <b>everting</b> their stomachs, which likely serves to cleanse indigestible particles, parasites, and mucus from the stomach lining.|$|E
500|$|The {{spotted hyena}} {{has a strong}} and well {{developed}} neck and forequarters, but relatively underdeveloped hindquarters. The rump is rounded rather than angular, which prevents attackers coming from behind from getting {{a firm grip on}} it. The head is wide and flat with a blunt muzzle and broad rhinarium. In contrast to the striped hyena, the ears of the spotted hyena are rounded rather than pointed. Each foot has four digits, which are webbed and armed with short, stout and blunt claws. The paw-pads are broad and very flat, with the whole undersurface of the foot around them being naked. The tail is relatively short, being [...] long, and resembles a pompom in appearance. Unusually among hyaenids, and mammals in general, the female spotted hyena is considerably larger than the male. Both sexes have a pair of anal glands which open into the rectum just inside the anal opening. These glands produce a white, creamy secretion which is pasted onto grass stalks by <b>everting</b> the rectum. The odour of this secretion is very strong, smelling of boiling cheap soap or burning, and can be detected by humans several metres downwind. The spotted hyena has a proportionately large heart, constituting close to 1% of its body weight, thus giving it great endurance in long chases. In contrast, a lion's heart makes up only 0.45–0.57 percent of its body weight. The now extinct Eurasian populations were distinguished from the modern African populations by their shorter distal extremities and longer humerus and femur.|$|E
2500|$|The {{original}} labiaplasty {{technique was}} simple resection of tissues at the free {{edge of the}} labia minora. One resection-technique variation features a clamp placed across the area of labial tissue to be resected, {{in order to establish}} hemostatis (stopped blood-flow), and the surgeon resects the tissues, and then sutures the cut labium minus or labia minora. This procedure is used by most surgeons because it is easiest to perform. The technical disadvantages of the labial-edge resection technique are the loss of the natural rugosity (wrinkles) of the labia minora free edges, thus, aesthetically, it produces an unnatural appearance to the vulva, and also presents a greater risk of damaging the pertinent nerve endings. Moreover, there also exists the possibility of <b>everting</b> (turning outwards) the inner lining of the labia, which then makes visible the normally hidden internal, pink labial tissues. The advantages of edge-resection include removal of the hyper-pigmented (darkened) irregular labial edges with a linear scar. Another disadvantage of the trim or [...] "amputation" [...] method, is that it is unable to excise redundant tissues of the clitoral hood, when present. Complete amputation of the labia minora is more common with this technique, which often requires additional surgery to correct. In addition, the trim method does not address the clitoral hood. Clitoral hood deformities are common with this approach, again requiring additional corrective surgery. Some women complain of a [...] "small penis" [...] when the trim procedure is performed, owing to the un-addressed clitoral hood tissue and completely removed (amputated) labia minor. Most plastic surgeons do not perform this procedure, and instead favor the extended wedge approach, which is technically more demanding, but produces a more natural result and is able to create a natural and proportioned appearance to the vulva. Reconstructive procedures are often required after the trim (amputation) labiaplasty.|$|E
5000|$|... 51 of the 90 {{matches the}} two played {{against each other}} were on the faster court {{surfaces}} (grass and indoors) that favored Navratilova's offensive serve-and-volley style of play over <b>Evert's</b> counter-attacking baseline approach. <b>Evert</b> enjoyed her greatest success against Navratilova on hard courts and especially on clay courts, but a minority of their matches were played on these surfaces. After Navratilova's loss to <b>Evert</b> in the 1975 US Open semi-final, Navratilova did not play <b>Evert</b> on clay again until the spring of 1981 (in the WTA Open). Indeed, she actively avoided challenging <b>Evert</b> on clay during this period, skipping the French Opens of 1979 and 1980 (which <b>Evert</b> won), and competing in just two clay court tournaments (the US Opens of 1976 and 1977 - which <b>Evert</b> also won). By contrast, <b>Evert</b> was competing regularly and frequently against Navratilova on grass and indoors throughout their long rivalry. Moreover, in the years of <b>Evert's</b> dominance of the game of Navratilova (from 1974 to 1978 especially), Navratilova was not the consistent player that <b>Evert</b> remained {{during the period of}} Navratilova's dominance of the game and of <b>Evert</b> (from 1982 to 1984 especially). In the earlier period of <b>Evert's</b> domination, Navratilova often failed to fulfill her seeding and reach her expected place in the semis and finals of major tournaments where she would have had to face <b>Evert,</b> whereas in the later period of Navratilova supremacy <b>Evert</b> was almost always the one coming through to face her in the latter rounds. These factors skewed the head-to-head record in Navratilova's favor. So did the fact that <b>Evert</b> did not switch from using wooden rackets to using the more high-powered graphite rackets that Navratilova had been using since 1982 until the start of the 1984 season. In outdoor matches, Navratilova led <b>Evert</b> 10-5 on grass; <b>Evert</b> led Navratilova 11-3 on clay courts; whereas the two were tied at 8-8 on hard courts. This gave <b>Evert</b> a 24-21 edge outdoors. She also defeated Navratilova more times on <b>Evert's</b> own [...] "weakest" [...] surface, grass, than Navratilova did <b>Evert</b> on her own [...] "weakest", clay. <b>Evert</b> led their head-to-head three-set match wins 16-14 but trailed Navratilova 13-22 in indoor encounters, arguably <b>Evert's</b> least-favorite court venue. They were tied 19-19 in non-Grand Slam finals. Once <b>Evert</b> served Navratilova a double bagel (6-0, 6-0) loss, a fate the latter could never reciprocate.|$|R

60|$|In most cases, when {{during the}} breeding-season the male alone emits a strong odour, this {{probably}} serves to excite or allure the female. We must not judge on this head {{by our own}} taste, for {{it is well known}} that rats are enticed by certain essential oils, and cats by valerian, substances which are far from agreeable to us; and that dogs, though they will not eat carrion, sniff and roll in it. From the reasons given when discussing the voice of the stag, we may reject the idea that the odour serves to bring the females from a distance to the males. Active and long-continued use cannot here have come into play, as in the case of the vocal organs. The odour emitted must be of considerable importance to the male, inasmuch as large and complex glands, furnished with muscles for <b>everting</b> the sack, and for closing or opening the orifice, have in some cases been developed. The development of these organs is intelligible through sexual selection, if the more odoriferous males are the most successful in winning the females, and in leaving offspring to inherit their gradually-perfected glands and odours.|$|E
