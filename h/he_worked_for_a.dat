5|$|Chapman's fame as a cricketer {{made him}} a popular public figure; he and his wife, whom he married in 1925, were well known figures in fashionable society and their {{appearances}} were followed closely in the press. Outside of cricket, <b>he</b> <b>worked</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> brewery. In his later years, Chapman increasingly suffered {{from the effects of}} alcoholism and was often seen drunk in public. He and his wife divorced in 1942; he spent his final years, mainly alone, suffering from depression, arthritis and a continued dependence on alcohol. Following a fall at his home and a subsequent operation, Chapman died in 1961, aged 61.|$|E
5|$|Garnet did {{not enter}} New College; instead, late in 1571, he left Winchester for London. There <b>he</b> <b>worked</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> legal publisher, Richard Tottell, as a proof-reader and corrector. He often dined with Sir John Popham, who as Lord Chief Justice was to preside over {{the trial of the}} Gunpowder Plotters, men whose {{association}} with Garnet would eventually prove so fateful. Although Garnet professed to Popham an interest in legal studies, in 1575 he sailed for Portugal with Giles Gallop, to enter the Society of Jesus.|$|E

5|$|Before {{moving into}} politics, {{he worked for}} the Insurance Company of North America from 1948 to 1955. Starting in 1955, <b>he</b> <b>worked</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> company called Gradmann und Holler, an {{insurance}} broker company for large businesses. Kiep owned 15 percent of the company in 1982. His involvement with Gradmann und Holler sparked controversy. When Kiep became minister in Lower Saxony in 1976, Volkswagen and other local companies went into business with Gradmann und Holler, creating a possible conflict of interest for the minister. Kiep also served on Volkswagen's board of directors. Kiep denied abusing his power as minister, saying that the deal with Volkswagen had been financially damaging rather than profitable for his company. Due to his successful business ventures, Kiep was considered {{to be one of the}} richest politicians in Germany. In an interview, Kiep told Playboy that he could live well just from the interest from his savings.|$|E
5|$|Born {{and raised}} in the Austrian Empire, Tesla {{received}} an advanced education in engineering and physics in the 1870s and gained practical experience in the early 1880s working in telephony and at Continental Edison in the new electric power industry. He emigrated to the United States in 1884, where he would become a naturalized citizen. <b>He</b> <b>worked</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> short time at the Edison Machine Works in New York City before he struck out on his own. With the help of partners to finance and market his ideas, Tesla set up laboratories and companies in New York to develop a range of electrical and mechanical devices. His alternating current (AC) induction motor and related polyphase AC patents, licensed by Westinghouse Electric in 1888, earned him a considerable amount of money and became the cornerstone of the polyphase system which that company would eventually market.|$|E
5|$|Evans' {{service as}} Imperial Wizard {{proved to be}} a lucrative position, {{allowing}} him to maintain a large residence in a prestigious Atlanta neighborhood. In the mid-1930s, however, Klan funds dwindled, and <b>he</b> <b>worked</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> Georgia-based construction company selling products to the Georgia Highway Board. At the same time, he was a staunch supporter of Georgia governor Eurith D. Rivers, whom he had previously employed as a lecturer. Owing to the political support that he provided the administration, Evans was allowed to sell to the highway board without bidding against other contractors. In 1940, the state of Georgia charged Evans {{and a member of the}} state highway board with price fixing. The Attorney General of Georgia, Ellis Arnall, directed legal proceedings against Evans that resulted in a $15,000 fine.|$|E

5|$|Frederick Benjamin Carlin {{was born}} on 27 July 1912 in Northam, Western Australia, {{a small town in}} the state's Wheatbelt. His mother, the former Charlotte Amelia Bramwell, died when he was four, and he was raised by his father, Frederick Cecil Carlin, who was an {{electrical}} engineer employed with the Western Australian Government Railways. At the age of ten, Carlin was sent to board at Guildford Grammar School in Perth. Leaving school in 1929, he enrolled at the School of Mines in Kalgoorlie, where he studied mining engineering. Once he had qualified as an engineer, <b>he</b> <b>worked</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> period of time in the surrounding Goldfields region. However, in 1939, he moved to Peking, China, to work for a British coal mining company.|$|E
5|$|In 1949, {{after years}} out of the limelight, Larwood was elected to honorary {{membership}} of the MCC. The following year {{he and his family}} were encouraged by former opponent Jack Fingleton to emigrate and settle in Australia, where he was warmly welcomed, in contrast to the reception accorded him in his cricketing days. <b>He</b> <b>worked</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> soft drinks firm, and as an occasional reporter and commentator on Tests against visiting England sides. He paid several visits to England, and was honoured at his old county ground, Trent Bridge, where a stand was named after him. In 1993, at the age of 88, he was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in belated recognition of his services to cricket. He died two years later.|$|E

5|$|Kochanowski {{was born}} in 1530 into a prosperous noble family. In his youth he studied at the {{universities}} of Kraków, Königsberg and Padua and traveled extensively in Europe. <b>He</b> <b>worked</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> time as a royal secretary, and then settled {{in the village of}} Czarnolas, a part of his family inheritance. Kochanowski's multifaceted creative output is remarkable for both the depth of thoughts and feelings that he shares with the reader, and for its beauty and classic perfection of form. Among Kochanowski's best known works are bucolic Frascas (trifles), epic poetry, religious lyrics, drama-tragedy The Dismissal of the Greek Envoys, and the most highly regarded Threnodies or laments, written {{after the death of his}} young daughter.|$|E

5|$|Farmer {{left school}} to tour {{with a group}} led by Johnny Otis, but this job lasted for only four months, as Farmer's lip gave out. Performing for long periods {{seven days a week}} for this job put great {{pressure}} on his technique, which was insufficiently developed to cope with such physical demands. His lip eventually became lacerated, and he could no longer play. He then received technique training in New York, where <b>he</b> <b>worked</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> time as a janitor and played as a freelance musician during 1947 and 1948. An audition for Dizzy Gillespie's big band was unsuccessful, and Farmer returned to the West Coast in 1948 as a member of Jay McShann's band. Club and studio work was hard to get in Los Angeles from the late 1940s and into the 1950s, as it was dominated by white musicians. Farmer played and toured with Benny Carter, Roy Porter and Gerald Wilson, then played with Wardell Gray in 1951–52. The hazards of the touring jazz musician's lifestyle were also present: while travelling overnight by car between Phoenix and El Paso, to get to another Roy Porter-led gig, the car that Farmer was in overturned at high speed, leaving him concussed and Porter with broken ribs.|$|E
5|$|Gui {{returned}} to China in 1999 {{and started a}} daughter company in Ningbo for a Swedish company known in Chinese as Tangyou (唐友), offering air purification products. Gui {{was involved in a}} drink-driving incident in Ningbo in December 2003 in which a 23-year-old girl was killed while crossing the road. The victim's mother disagreed with the police investigation report that her daughter should bear secondary responsibility for not paying attention to traffic, since she had heard from witnesses that the car had been speeding, so she risked her life to experiment on herself {{with the help of her}} son and a driver for 10 days, demonstrating that the driving speed had to exceed 110 km/h for the accident to occur. She appealed to the Zhejiang Provincial Public Security Department, which upon reexamination concluded that Gui should bear full responsibility for the incident in May 2004. Her experiment was widely reported in the Chinese media. The victim's parents later filed a civil lawsuit against Gui for compensation. The Ningbo Municipal Intermediate People's Court ruled the following August that Gui had committed a crime, for which Gui received a two-year suspended jail term. He then departed for Germany, thus violated his probation terms. In 2004, after leaving China, <b>he</b> <b>worked</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> German affiliate of Nordpool Consulting.|$|E
5|$|In 1950, Ward's DSIR {{fellowship}} {{was coming}} to an end. Pryce had become a visiting professor at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, and Ward's colleagues P. T. Matthews and Abdus Salam were visiting members there in the 1950–1951 academic year. Through them, he was able to secure a $3,000 membership for the 1951–1952 academic year. It was at Princeton that he was introduced to the Ising Model, and met Mark Kac from Cornell University, with whom he would collaborate on an exact solution of the Ising model using a combinatorial method. His joint work with Kac on the Ising Model gave rise to what is now being called the Kac-Ward operator. When his membership ended he worked for the Bell Laboratories in 1952 and 1953. He then accepted an offer of a lectureship at the University of Adelaide from Bert Green, where <b>he</b> <b>worked</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> year before taking up another membership at the Institute for Advanced Study.|$|E
