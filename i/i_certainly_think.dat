500|$|The episode also {{features}} the final appearance of Harry Hamlin as Season 1 antagonist Aaron Echolls after {{the character is}} murdered by Clarence Wiedman (Christopher B. Duncan). Later, we learn that the murder was ordered by Duncan Kane (Teddy Dunn), who appears briefly in a small cameo. Dunn had made his final regular appearance in [...] "Donut Run" [...] and had left the show partly due to fan dislike of the character. Dunn later stated {{that he thought that}} the purpose of the cameo was to garner sympathy for the character before his final departure. [...] "I think Rob's goal was to leave the character on a high note. <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>think</b> he did so in a heroic way." ...|$|E

5000|$|... "I {{probably}} haven't played {{too poor}} {{the last couple}} of weeks but <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>I</b> have been at my best." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, yes; <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> do <b>think</b> it probable. I am sure {{he admires}} her, and I think it {{very likely to}} come to more. Would there be any objection?" ...|$|R
5000|$|... "My {{understanding}} is that he's a terrific musician. He puts on a very good concert. <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> don't <b>think</b> it hurts U.S.-Cuban relations, these kinds of cultural exchanges." [...] U.S. President Barack Obama, September 20, 2009 ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>think</b> {{you have}} treated Roy shamefully," [...] said Phil in exasperation. [...] "He's {{handsome}} and clever and rich and good. What more do you want?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "On the whole, I cannot {{say that}} I am {{surprised}} to hear it," [...] Wolfenden remarked; [...] "but <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>think</b> that, considering the form his madness takes, you ought to protect yourself in some way." ...|$|E
6000|$|Edmund {{looked down}} and did not reply very readily. [...] "I am afraid we must not hope for that; we must be {{satisfied}} {{as long as he}} does not lose ground, and <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>think</b> he has had less pain of late." ...|$|E
60|$|TARLETON. [impressed, as usual] Thats an idea, <b>certainly.</b> <b>I</b> dont <b>think</b> {{anybody has}} ever written about that.|$|R
6000|$|... "'I listened very attentively, {{because all}} seemed to me almost like magic, but <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> did not <b>think</b> that I should ever have to do such a thing, myself.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But, Rollo," [...] {{added his}} father, [...] "I should {{think it would}} be best for you {{to have some sort of}} organization, if you are going to attempt to do any thing in company. Men never think that they can {{accomplish}} any thing in company, without organization; and <b>I</b> should <b>certainly</b> <b>think</b> that children would not be able to." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{very pleased}} to hear you speak so sensibly, my dears. <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>think</b> {{that she is a}} woman whom you may very well take as your model. The more {{intimate}} you are with her the better pleased I shall be." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I guess Mr. Bowser {{is going}} to have a surprise; <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>think</b> he is," [...] said Prickly Porky as he made all the {{thousand}} little spears stand out from his long coat till he looked like a funny great chestnut burr.|$|E
6000|$|... "We both {{hope that}} it will come about, Mrs. Conway," [...] Mrs. Withers said one day; [...] "and <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>think</b> there is every {{prospect}} of it. Let us leave well alone, and allow it to come about naturally and without interference." ...|$|E
5000|$|In a 2007 {{column for}} Tribune media services, he wrote, [...] "I {{know all about}} Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig, but today's {{baseball}} stars are all guys named Rodriguez to me." [...] Rooney later commented, [...] "Yeah, I probably shouldn't have said it, but it's a name that seems common in baseball now. <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> didn't <b>think</b> of it in any derogatory sense." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] she said, [...] "we shall see. <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> do not <b>think</b> that he {{will ever}} ask me to marry him. He {{is one of those}} whom my gold does not seem to attract." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, <b>certainly.</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> {{there is}} no doubt of that. I was waiting for the man to go, and went in almost before {{he was out of the}} house." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>think</b> that juries {{would be}} more conscientious, if they were allowed a larger discretion. But, after all, juries cannot {{be better than the}} mass out of which they are taken. And if juries are not honest and single-minded, they are the worst, because the least responsible, {{instruments}} of judicial or popular tyranny.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{would have}} told you that the cottage was the rendezvous, {{but it was not}} decided upon until the last moment. I gave you the means of {{tracking}} Toussac, but you let the hound slip. <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>think</b> that you will have to answer to the Emperor for the way in which you have managed the business.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{think it}} will be a little light, sir," [...] Mr. Ryan said, [...] "by the time we have got it {{perfectly}} smooth and even. Still, I have seen lighter spars in a ship of this size, and <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>think</b> we are most fortunate in getting such a stick. When do you think you will get it ready, Watson?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 20. <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>certainly,</b> {{from the}} dazzling, which {{sometimes}} with the poppy, scarlet geranium, and nasturtium, is more distinctly oppressive {{to the eye}} than a real excess of light.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Certainly I {{think it}} necessary. Even if there if nothing, {{we can have}} peace of mind. <b>Certainly</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it necessary. I should like Doctor Wayne to come this evening if possible.' ...|$|R
5000|$|... "I'm not {{attempting}} to make any excuses because I thought Swindon were terrific on the day, but six of us had flu and it didn't help that the pitch was cut up so badly. <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> don't <b>think</b> the game would have gone ahead today. I performed very strongly for the 90 minutes but then when it got to extra-time my legs just went completely." [...] Frank McLintock ...|$|R
6000|$|... "To dine at half-past seven," [...] the Duchess remarked, as {{she looked}} around the {{entresol}} of the great restaurant through her lorgnettes, [...] "is certainly a little trying for one's temper and for one's digestion, but so long as those men accepted, <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>think</b> they ought to have been here. They know that the play begins at a quarter to nine." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{need only}} leave some twenty {{of the less}} seriously wounded men to guard the place. When we sally out, the guerillas will have plenty to do without making {{an attack on the}} church. <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>think</b> that we are not likely to lose so many lives in a sortie as we should do in the defence, here, against a night attack." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I {{think our}} boys did their bit, too, if I am any judge," [...] was Sam Rover's fond comment. [...] "First they helped to catch those chaps who {{blew up the}} Hasley {{ammunition}} factory, then they aided in rounding up the crowd who had the hidden German submarine, and lastly they prevented those Huns from establishing that wireless station in the woods. <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>think</b> they did remarkably well." ...|$|E
6000|$|His eyes {{shone with}} humor. [...] "I will listen with great pleasure; but don't ask a chemist {{to judge a}} pianist. I love music--it is a sweet noise in my ears--but I can hardly {{distinguish}} Chopin from Schumann." [...] He faced the girl. [...] "Play for me. I shall be very deeply indebted." [...] As she still hesitated he added: [...] "Please do, or <b>I</b> will <b>certainly</b> <b>think</b> you consider me intrusive." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, <b>certainly!</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> {{the best}} course now would be {{to speak to me}} frankly {{respecting}} Von Konigstein; and, if you are aware of anything which has passed in England of a nature--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am sorry}} to say, I have a very bad account of you from your mother. She says you are a passionate and wicked girl. How is it, dear; you are not passionate here, and <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> do not <b>think</b> you are wicked?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{strikes you}} in that light, Lecount--does it?" [...] said Noel Vanstone. [...] "I think so myself; <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>think</b> so. I won't pay the police a farthing if I can {{possibly}} help it." [...] He took up the letter again, and became fretfully perplexed over a second reading of it. [...] "But the man wants money!" [...] he broke out, impatiently. [...] "You seem to forget, Lecount, that the man wants money." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I've not the {{slightest}} objection to her being married. I hope she will, with all my heart. <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>think</b> she should have her husband after buying him at such a price. I suppose Lord Fawn won't forbid the banns." [...] These last words were only whispered to her next neighbour, Lord Chiltern; but poor Lord Fawn saw the whisper, and was aware {{that it must have}} had reference to his condition.|$|E
6000|$|... "Whether any {{treasure}} we find {{belonged to}} the Incas or to the Chimoos is of no consequence whatever. <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>think</b> that before entering upon what {{would seem to be}} almost a hopeless search for such stores, we should try this place that you know of. In that case it seems to me, Dias, that if we had gone down the coast to Islay, and up through Arequipa to Cuzco, our journey would have been considerably shorter." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{company was}} {{established}} in 1841 in Gothenburg, Sweden, by Fritz Wiktor Hasselblad, as a trading company, F. W. Hasselblad and Co. The founder's son, Arvid Viktor Hasselblad, was interested in photography and started the photographic division of the company. Hasselblad's corporate website [...] quotes him as saying <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> don’t <b>think</b> that we will earn much money on this, {{but at least it}} will allow us to take pictures for free.|$|R
60|$|Mr Godwin in {{the preface}} to his Enquirer, drops a few {{expressions}} which seem to hint at some change in his opinions since he wrote the Political Justice; and as this is a work now of some years standing, <b>I</b> should <b>certainly</b> <b>think</b> that <b>I</b> had been arguing against opinions which the author had himself seen reason to alter, but that in some of the essays of the Enquirer, Mr Godwin's peculiar mode of thinking appears in as striking a light as ever.|$|R
6000|$|... "I do {{not wish}} her to marry him," [...] said the perplexed father. [...] "I do not like him, and do not think {{he would make a}} good husband. But if Eleanor chooses to do so, <b>I</b> shall <b>certainly</b> not <b>think</b> that she disgraces herself." ...|$|R
