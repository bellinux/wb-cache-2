In. D. Sokolovi?, C. Huyghe, & J. Radovi? (Eds.), Quantitative Traits Breeding for Multifunctional Grasslands and Turf. (pp. 267 - 271). Springer, Netherlands. Leaf elongation rate (LER) {{is a key}} component of forage grass dry matter yield. Leaf lamina initiate rapid expansion during the winter at a time that coincides with lengthening days but this extension is not associated with any large environmental shifts such as an increase in light intensity or temperature. The rate increase precedes any anatomical indication of floral initiation in apical meristems (double ridge formation) by around two to three weeks. We measured LER in a perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) pair-cross mapping family that has been extensively mapped with more than 1 200 SNP markers generated by Illumina?s Infinium platform. These have been anchored to the seven Lolium linkage groups as defined by Triticeae nomenclature with seven micro-satellite markers originally developed by ViaLactia Biosciences. Measurements were made in the winter/spring during extending daylength, after full natural vernalisation. The plants? leaves were beginning to expand rapidly with leaf extension rates varying between approximately 0. 4 mm and 1. 1 mm h- 1. We obtained a significant correlation between LER and both apical meristem elongation and ear emergence (the date at which inflorescences emerge above the flag-leaf ligule) measured in two separate seasons. A QTL for LER was revealed with a peak some distance away from the major floral initiation and ear emergence date QTL on linkage group 7. This is the first evidence of genetic linkage that determines the often observed {{association between}} LER in <b>herbage</b> <b>grasses</b> in the spring with floral initiation determined in large part by the action of Arabidopsis flowering initiation gene homologues, Flowering Time Locus (FT) and Constans (CO) ...|$|E

Grass silage (n = 6) received a low (65 kg N/ha) or high (150 kg N/ha) fertilization rate and was harvested at early (c 2000 kg DM/ha), mid (harvested 13 d later), or late (harvested 34 d later) maturity stage and ensiled in big bales. All grasses were incubated in the rumen of three lactating rumen-cannulated Holstein Friesian cows. Rumen degradation characteristics of organic matter (OM), nitrogen (N) and neutral detergent fibre (NDF) {{and the extent of}} effective degradation (ED) were evaluated. In <b>grass</b> <b>herbage,</b> NDF content varied between 390 and 454 g/kg DM and N content between 12. 1 and 25. 8 g/kg DM. In grass silage, NDF content varied between 438 and 593 g/kg DM and N content between 13. 4 and 34. 8 g/kg DM. In general, rumen degradation of <b>grass</b> <b>herbage</b> and <b>grass</b> silage decreased with increased maturity, and increased with increased fertilization rate. Significant interaction between maturity and fertilization rate was observed for ED of OM, N and NDF, except for ED of N in <b>grass</b> <b>herbage.</b> These results indicate that the effect of the rate of N fertilization on degradation of nutrients in the rumen of dairy cattle and on nutritional value depends on the grass maturity stage...|$|R

40|$|Data on {{the effect}} of {{grassland}} management on the nutritional characteristics of fresh and conserved grass, and on enteric methane (CH 4) emission in dairy cattle, are sparse. In the present study, an extant mechanistic model of enteric fermentation was evaluated against observations {{on the effect}} of grassland management on CH 4 emission in three trials conducted in climate-controlled respiration chambers. Treatments were nitrogen fertilisation rate, stage of maturity of grass and level of feed intake, and mean data of a total of 18 treatments were used (4 <b>grass</b> <b>herbage</b> treatments and 14 grass silage treatments). There was a wide range of observed organic matter (OM) digestibility (from 68 % to 84 %) and CH 4 emission intensity (from 5. 6 % to 7. 3 % of gross energy intake; from 27. 4 to 36. 9 g CH 4 /kg digested OM; from 19. 7 to 24. 6 g CH 4 /kg dry matter) among treatment means. The model predicted crude protein, fibre and OM digestibility with reasonable accuracy (root of mean square prediction errors as % of observed mean, RMSPE, 6. 8 %, 7. 5 % and 3. 9 %, respectively). For grass silages only, the model-predicted CH 4 correlated well (Pearson correlation coefficient 0. 73) with the observed CH 4 (which varied from 5. 7 % to 7. 2 % of gross energy intake), after predicted CH 4 was corrected for nitrate consumed with grass silage, acting as hydrogen sink in the rumen. After nitrate correction, there was a systematic under-prediction of 18 %, which reduced to 9 % when correcting the erroneously predicted rumen volatile fatty acid (VFA) profile (RMSPE 15 %). Although a small over-prediction of 3 % was obtained for the <b>grass</b> <b>herbages,</b> this increased to 14 % when correcting VFA profile. The model predictions showed a systematic difference in CH 4 emission from <b>grass</b> <b>herbages</b> and <b>grass</b> silages, which was not supported by the observed data. This is possibly related to the very high content of soluble carbohydrates in <b>grass</b> <b>herbage</b> (an extra 170 g/kg dry matter compared with grass silages) and an erroneous prediction of its fate and contribution to CH 4 in the rumen. Erroneous prediction of the VFA profile is likely to be due to different types of diets included in the empirical database used to parameterise VFA yield in the model from those evaluated here. Model representations of feed digestion and VFA profile are key elements to predict enteric CH 4 accurately, and with further evaluations, the latter aspect should be emphasised in particular...|$|R
40|$|A {{field study}} was {{conducted}} at Nsukka, Nigeria {{to determine the effects}} of cutting height and N fertilizer application on dry matter yield of guinea grass (Panicum maximum Jacq) pasture in 2008 and 2009. The experiment was a 3 x 3 factorial laid out in a randomized complete block design with three replications. Treatments comprised three cutting heights (5, 10 and 15 cm) and three levels of nitrogen (0, 200 and 400 kg N ha- 1) resulting in nine treatment combinations per block. Grass dry matter yield was increased (P > 0. 05) by 4 % when cutting height increased from 5 to 10 cm but significantly (P < 0. 05) reduced by 16 % when cutting height increased from 10 to 15 cm in 2008. Grass dry matter yield was not significantly affected by variation in cutting height in 2009. The total <b>herbage</b> (<b>grass</b> + weed) dry matter yield significantly (P < 0. 05) increased by 86 % and 47 % in 2008 and 2009, respectively, when nitrogen fertilizer was increased from 0 to 400 kg N ha- 1. Low cutting height (5 cm) significantly (P < 0. 05) increased grass yield at the first two periods in 2008 but generally reduced grass yield relative to lax cutting (15 cm) in most harvest periods in 2009.

In experiment 1, 24 calves were reared in groups of 3 or individually in straw-bedded pens from age 1 to 7 wk. One-half of the calves in each treatment were provided with ad libitum cut perennial ryegrass <b>herbage.</b> <b>Grass</b> intakes and time spent eating grass were greater for grouped calves than for individual calves. Providing grass reduced concentrate intake of grouped calves and reduced the time that all calves, but particularly individual calves, spent eating straw bedding. Ruminating time was increased by offering grass to grouped calves compared with individual calves. Grass reduced the frequency of calves licking their buckets and their pen, vocalizing, and investigating their pen. Particularly for grouped calves provision of grass reduced all grooming. Group rearing reduced the frequency of calves licking their bucket, vocalizing, and investigating their pen, but {{had no effect on}} the frequency of pen licking. Calves were weaned at wk 7 and transferred to indoor silage feeding or grazing. Most effects of group rearing and grass provision were not maintained after weaning, but calves that had received grass ate for longer periods when turned out to pasture. In experiment 2, 72 calves were offered a mixture of straw, molasses, and pot ale syrup or grass hay. Calves offered the straw mixture ate more forage and concentrates and grew faster than calves offered hay.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{undertake}} an initial step that would lead to a better understanding of the effects of nutrients released from vegetation inundated by water at newly constructed reservoirs. Specifically, a series of leaching studies were conducted on representative <b>grasses,</b> <b>herbage</b> and trees to determine the relative nutrient release rates of nitrogen and phosphorous. In addition, a limited field study was conducted as well as a vegetation inventory of a proposed Bureau of Reclamation reservoir near Edna, Texas. The results of the leaching study were presented as percent nutrients released from the various types of vegetation as a function of time. The total quantity and rate of nutrient release varied greatly depending upon the type of vegetation. As an example, nutrients released from <b>grasses</b> and <b>herbage</b> proved to be released at a greater rate, contain a greater quantity of nutrients per unit weight of vegetation and generally be more available in greater quantities based on weight per unit area than for trees. This indicated that although trees are often the only vegetation removed from a reservior site, the amount of nutrients available for release by the <b>herbage</b> and <b>grasses</b> will probably have a much more significant impact on reservoir water quality and should be considered in the reservoir clearing policy.

This figure held for dressing with ammonium nitrate, limestone and calcium nitrate. It did not apply to application of ammonium sulphate except where conditions favoured nitrification. Ageing was accompanied by a decrease in total N and an increase in crude fibre. In young herbage, crude fibre decreased with N dressing (if yield had not yet increased considerably by fertilizer), but increased in old herbage when the yield had been increased considerably by fertilizer. At one yield level, crude fibre always decreased with increasing rates of nitrogen. Both growth period and nitrogen fertilizer affected the botanical composition of herbage and the morphological composition of the <b>herbage</b> components. <b>Grass</b> leaf had more crude fibre than dandelion leaf and leaves were lower in crude fibre than stems...|$|R

Data from three studies were used, encompassing four <b>grass</b> <b>herbage</b> and 14 <b>grass</b> silage treatments and 132 individual cow observations. Methane production was measured using respiration chambers and milk fatty acids (FAs) analysed using gas chromatography. The proportion of grass or grass silage (dry matter (DM) basis) was 0. 80 ± 0. 037. Methane yield averaged 22. 3 ± 2. 10 g/kg DM intake (DMI) and 14. 2 ± 2. 90 g/kg fat- and protein-corrected milk (FPCM). Mixed model univariate regression including a random study effect on intercept was applied to predict methane yield, with individual milk FA concentrations (g/ 100 g FA) as fixed effects. Of the 42 milk FAs identified, no single FA had a strong positive correlation (r; strong correlation defined as |r| ≥ 0. 50) with methane yield (g/kg DMI), and cis- 12 C 18 : 1 and cis- 9, 12, 15 C 18 : 3 had a strong negative correlation with methane yield (g/kg DMI).

Four paddocks of DL elephant grass pasture, {{which had a}} 5 (20 m × 25 m) of area/paddock, were grazed at 3 cycles of one-week grazing with 3 -week rest period by 3 heads of breeding beef cows from May to November 2003. The plant height, leaf area index and ratio of leaf blade to stem were the highest, while tiller number increased and herbage mass tended to increase as grazing accured, except for the first grazing cycle. Herbage consumption, rate of herbage consumption and dry matter intake tended to decrease in three paddocks from the first to the third cycle. The average of dry matter intake was 10. 2 - 14. 5 g DM/kg/LW/day over the four paddocks and the average daily gain was 0. 09 kg/head day. The carrying capacities was estimated at 1016 (annual total 1224 CD/ha). Thus, DL elephant grass pasture can expand the grazing period for beef cows in a rainy season.

40|$|Agroecology {{opens up}} new {{perspectives}} {{for the design}} of sustainable farming systems by using the stimulation of natural processes to reduce the inputs needed for production. In horse farming systems, the challenge is to maximize the proportion of forages in the diet, and to develop alternatives to synthetic chemical drugs for controlling gastrointestinal nematodes. Lactating saddle mares, with high nutritional requirements, are commonly supplemented with concentrates at pasture, although the influence of energy supplementation on voluntary intake, performance and immune response against parasites has not yet been quantified. In a 4 -month study, 16 lactating mares experimentally infected with cyathostome larvae either received a daily supplement of barley (60 % of energy requirements for lactation) or were non-supplemented. The mares were rotationally grazed on permanent pastures over three vegetation cycles. All the mares met their energy requirements and maintained their body condition score higher than 3. In both treatments, they produced foals with a satisfying growth rate (cycle 1 : 1293 g/day; cycle 2 : 1029 g/day; cycle 3 : 559 g/day) and conformation (according to measurements of height at withers and cannon bone width at 11 months). Parasite egg excretion by mares increased in both groups during the grazing season (from 150 to 2011 epg), independently of whether they were supplemented or not. This suggests that energy supplementation did not improve mare ability to regulate parasite burden. Under unlimited <b>herbage</b> conditions, <b>grass</b> dry matter intake by supplemented mares remained stable around 22. 6 g DM/kg LW per day (i. e. 13. 5 kg DM/al per day), whereas non-supplemented mares increased voluntary intake from 22. 6 to 28. 0 g DM/kg LW per day (13. 5 to 17. 2 kg DM/al per day) between mid-June and the end of August. Hence total digestible dry matter intake and net energy intake did not signi ficantly differ between supplemented and non-supplemented mares during the second and third cycles. In conclusion, supplementing lactating mares at pasture should not be systematic because their adaptive capacities enable to increase herbage intake and ensure foal growth.

40|$|The Role of White Clover (Trifolium repens L) in Pastoral Agriculture White clover {{is widely}} {{distributed}} throughout the temperate {{regions of the world}} where it is of major agronomic importance (Erith 1924; Martin 1960; Williams 1970; Levy 1970). The most important function of legumes in a pasture is their ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiosis with root nodule bacteria called Rhizobium (Martin 1960) and thus increase the potential pool of nitrogen for the pasture. Sears et al. (1953, 1965) estimated that approximately 410 kg/ha/year of nitrogen can be fixed by white clover under initial pasture development conditions in New Zealand. This nitrogen becomes available for associated grass growth through transfer of breakdown products of the clover shoot and root parts and transfer of nitrogen compounds through the grazing animal (Butler and Bathurst, 1956). White clover is also important because of its high quality feed for grazing animals (Williams 1970). Compared with <b>grass</b> <b>herbage,</b> white clover has higher levels of protein, and minerals such as calcium and magnesium (Johns 1966). A low supply of these elements is frequently associated with metabolic disorders of animals. White clover herbage is also of high digestibility and acceptability by animals (Ulyatt et al. 1976). Although white clover has become the most important pasture legume in New Zealand, its effective use is dependent on an adequate supply of nutrients in the soil (Sears 1953), effective symbiosis with R. trifolii (Munro and Hughes, 1966) and optimum climatic conditions (Mitchell, 1956).

Differences in canopy density were usually not significant when precipitation was below normal. With abundant spring precipitation, quackgrass [Elymus repens (L.) Gould] had greater upper canopy density (1. 9 mg dry matter [DM] cm − 3) {{than any of the other}} grasses studied. Grasses typically grazed at shorter heights such as bluegrass (Poa pratensis L.) and perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) had greater density in the lower canopy layer (1. 0 – 1. 3 g DM kg − 1). While soft-leaf tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.), reed canarygrass (Phalaris arundinacea L.), and meadow fescue (Festuca pratensis Huds.) had lower density in the upper canopy than timothy (Phleum pratense L.) and quackgrass in the spring, the reverse was true in the summer. <b>Herbage</b> NDF of <b>grasses</b> generally increased from the upper to lower canopy layer (mean difference of 50 g kg − 1); perennial ryegrass and meadow fescue often had the lowest NDF throughout the canopy (range of 392 – 452 and 418 – 469 g kg − 1, respectively). Pasture intake may benefit from a diverse species composition because animals can graze a mixture having optimum density and NDF throughout the canopy...|$|R
40|$|The {{impact of}} grazing on soil {{physical}} {{properties in the}} east African highland was studied from 1996 to 1998. The study was conducted at two sites with 0 - 4 % and 4 - 8 % slopes at the International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI) Debre Ziet Research Station, 50 km south of Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. The grazing regimes were; light grazing stocked at 0. 6 animal-unit months per hectare (AUM) h- 1, moderate grazing stocked at 1. 8 (AUM) h- 1, heavy grazing stocked at 3. 0 (AUM) h- 1 very heavy grazing stocked at 4. 2 (AUM) h- 1, very heavy grazing on plowed soil stocked at 4. 2 (AUM) h- 1; and a control with no grazing. The grazing pressure has no impact on total nitrogen of the soil. Since manure is not collected from grazing plots the soil organic matter content did not decline, it was rather stable and slightly increasing. Grazing has improved the plant available-P compared to nongrazed plots at both slopes in all soil depths. Soil bulk density and total porosity did not show significant differences among different grazing pressures. At both sites the soil water content was high in heavily grazed plots {{as compared to the}} rest of the treatments. The steady state infiltration rate was significantly different only in light grazing treatment at 4 - 8 % slope. Finally livestock grazing with good management and manure recycling to the grazed plots could not degrade soil physical and hydrological properties. Hence, over utilization of the available <b>grass</b> <b>herbage</b> by livestock and removing manure from grazed plots is responsible for soil degradation...|$|R
40|$|Bulk milk urea {{concentration}} {{was evaluated}} to assess its potential {{as an indicator}} of ammonia emission from a dairy cow barn in a situation with restricted grazing. An experiment was carried out with a herd of, on average, 52 Holstein-Friesian dairy cows. The cows were housed in a naturally ventilated barn with cubicles and a slatted floor, were fed ensiled forages and feed supplements, and each day were allowed 8. 5 h of grazing. The experiment was a balanced randomized block design, replicated 3 times. The experimental factor was the bulk milk urea level, which was adjusted to levels of 15, 35, and 55 mg of urea per 100 g of milk, respectively, by changing the level of nitrogen fertilization of the pasture, the <b>herbage</b> mass and <b>grass</b> regrowth age, and the level and type of feed supplement. Ammonia emission from the barn was measured using sulfur hexafluoride as the tracer gas. Ammonia emission generally increased upon an increase in adjusted milk urea levels. A dynamic regression model was used to predict ammonia emission from bulk milk urea concentration, temperature, and a slurry mixing index. This model accounted for 66 % of the total variance in ammonia emission and showed that emission increases exponentially with increasing milk urea concentration. At levels of 20 and 30 mg of urea per 100 g of milk, ammonia emission increased by about 2. 5 and 3. 5 %, respectively, when milk urea concentration increased by 1 mg/ 100 g. Furthermore, emissions from the barn increased 2. 6 % when temperature increased by 1 °C. The study showed that bulk milk urea concentration is a useful indicator for ammonia emissions from a dairy cow barn in a situation with restricted grazing...|$|R
40|$|An {{intensive}} {{rotational grazing}} system for dwarf and late heading (DL) elephant grass (Pennisetum purpureum Schumach) pasture was examined {{in a summer}} period for two years following establishment. Four 0. 05 of DL elephant grass pastures (20 × 25 m) were established on May 2003. They were rotationally grazed for 1 week, followed by a 3 -week rest period by three breeding or raising beef cattle for three and six cycles during {{the first and second}} years of establishment respectively. Before grazing, the plant height, leaf area index and the ratio of leaf blade to stem were at the highest, while tiller number increased and herbage mass tended to increase, except for the first grazing cycle both two years and for one paddock in the second year. Herbage consumption, the rate of herbage consumption and dry matter intake tended to decrease in three paddocks from the first to the third cycle in the first year, but increase as grazing occurred in the second year. Dry matter intake averaged 10. 2 - 14. 5 and 15. 4 – 23. 2 g DM/kg/live weight (LW) /day over the four paddocks in the first and second year, respectively, and average daily gains were 0. 09 and 0. 35 kg/head/day in the first and second year respectively. The carrying capacities were estimated at 1, 016 and 208 cow-days (CD) /ha (annual total 1, 224 CD/ha) in the first year and 1, 355 and 207 CD/ha (annual total 1, 562 CD/ha) in the second year. Thus, DL elephant grass pasture can expand the grazing period for beef cows for the following two-year establishment.

40|$|The {{introduction}} of automobile catalysts has raised environmental concern, as this pollution control technology {{is also an}} emission source for the platinum group elements (PGE). The main {{aim of this study}} was to assess the concentrations of Pt, Pd, Rh and Au in soil and <b>grass</b> <b>herbage</b> collected adjacent to 5 roads. Soil and grass samples were collected from 4 fixed distances (0, 1, 2 and 5 m) from the road edge at each site. PGE and Au were determined by ICP-MS in all samples after acid digestion. The maximum soil Pt, Rh and Pd concentrations were measured at the road perimeters. Averaged across the sites, the Pt and Rh concentrations of 15. 9 +/- 7. 5 microg Pt kg(- 1) and 22. 40 +/- 4. 73 microg Rh kg(- 1) at 0 -m distance decreased to 2. 04 +/- 1. 7 microg Pt kg(- 1) and 3. 51 +/- 1. 96 microg Rh kg(- 1), respectively at 5 -m away from the roads. Pd concentrations were much higher than Pt or Rh, ranging from 120. 8 +/- 12. 0 microg Pd kg(- 1) (0 -m) to 84. 2 +/- 10. 9 microg Pd kg(- 1) (5 -m), possibly due to differences in its use, emission and/or soil chemistry. Au showed little or no change with distance from the roads. However, the average Au concentration of 18. 98 +/- 0. 98 microg Au kg(- 1) provides clear evidence of some input possibly due to attrition of automobile electronics. No straightforward influence of traffic flow rates on PGE distribution was found. A combination of dispersal impeding local features and slow moving and stop-and-start traffic conditions or fast moving traffic with flat open spaces may have offset the expected impacts. Rh and Pt soil concentration accounted for 66 % and 34 % (P< 0. 01) of the variability observed, respectively in their plant concentrations.

40|$|A {{research}} study was undertaken {{to study the}} grass layer across a mini landscape dominated by tree legume Albizia lebbeck to explore the nutritional differences of two introduced grasses, guinea grass (Panicum maximum) and sabi grass (Urochloa mosambicensis), paying {{particular attention to the}} presence or absence of tree legume canopy of Albizia lebbeck. The two grass species showed a tendency to replace the native spear grass (Heteropogon contortus); their dominance was more or less complete under tree canopies but was increasing in open areas between trees. Nutritional differences were examined by nitrogen concentration and dry matter digestibility. For comparison, Heteropogon contortus, a native species only found in the open, was included in the nutritional determination using the same methods as the guinea and sabi grasses. The quality parameters of the pasture species were statistically compared (LSD, P= 0. 05). The quality of herbage was different between the species. Urochloa mosambicensis was better than Panicum maximum. In the open, sabi grass has higher N content (0. 62 %) than guinea grass (0. 55 %), but they were similar when grown under the canopy (0. 69 % and 0. 72 %, respectively). Sabi grass has consistently higher dry matter digestibility (41. 39 % and 36. 83 %, respectively under the canopy and in the open), than guinea grass (27. 78 % and 24. 77 %). These two species are much higher in both N concentration and dry matter digestibility than the native spear grass. The native species has contained 0. 28 % N, and 17. 65 % digestible dry matter. The feeding values of herbage were influenced by the canopy factor. Both guinea and sabi grasses have better quality when grown under the tree canopies than in between canopies. Nitrogen concentration and dry matter digestibility of the guinea grass under canopy were, 0. 72 % and 27. 78 %, respectively, significantly higher than those from the open area, 0. 55 % and 24. 77 %. Similarly, <b>herbage</b> of sabi <b>grass</b> under canopy has 0. 69 % and 41. 39 %, nitrogen content and digestible dry matter, respectively, which is significantly higher than herbage from the open sites, 0. 62 % and 36. 83 %...|$|R
40|$|Aim: To {{evaluate}} some forage feeds of ruminants {{in terms}} of their carbohydrate (CHO) and protein fractions using Cornell Net Carbohydrate and Protein System (CNCPS). Materials and Methods: Eleven ruminant feeds (six green fodders - maize, oat, sorghum, bajra, cowpea, berseem and five range <b>herbages</b> - para <b>grass,</b> guinea grass, hedge lucerne, setaria grass and hybrid napier) were selected for this study. Each feed was chemically analyzed for proximate principles (dry matter, crude protein [CP], ether extract, organic matter and ash), fiber fractions (neutral detergent fiber, acid detergent fiber, acid detergent lignin, cellulose and hemicellulose), primary CHO fractions (CHO, non-structural CHO, structural CHO and starch) and primary protein fractions (neutral detergent insoluble CP, acid detergent insoluble CP, non-protein nitrogen and soluble protein). The results were fitted to the equations of CNCPS to arrive at various CHO (CA - fast degrading, CB 1 - intermediate degrading, CB 2 - slow degrading and CC - nondegrading or unavailable) and protein (PA - instantaneously degrading, PB 1 - fast degrading, PB 2 - intermediate degrading, PB 3 - slow degrading and PC - non-degrading or unavailable) fractions of test feeds. Results: Among green fodders, cowpea and berseem had higher CA content while except hedge lucerne all range herbages had lower CA values. CB 1 content of all feeds was low but similar. All feeds except cowpea, berseem, and hedge lucerne contained higher CB 2 values. Oat among green fodders and hybrid napier among range herbages had lower CC fraction. Feeds such as bajra, cowpea, berseem and the setaria grass contained lower PA fraction. All green fodders had higher PB 1 content except maize and cowpea while all range herbages had lower PB 1 values except hedge lucerne. Para grass and hybrid napier contained exceptionally low PB 2 fraction among all feeds. Low PC contents were reported in oat and berseem fodders. Conclusion: Based on our findings, it was concluded that feeds with similar CP and CHO content varied significantly with respect to their CHO and protein fractions. Due to lower CC fraction, oat and hybrid napier were superior feeds {{in terms of}} CHO supply to ruminants. Similarly, among all feeds oat and berseem had a lower PC fraction, thus were considered good sources of protein for ruminants...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} {{was to examine the}} effect of {{different}} treatments on the degradation of protein during ensiling, with the aim of minimizing protein degradation. The work is based on three experiments. The first was a study on mechanical treatments during wilting (untouched swath, swath turning, spreading and tedding) and the effects on losses and protein degradation in two crops. In the second study, herbage was ensiled in large round bales, or chopped and ensiled in small-scale silos, and ensiled with or without additives (Inoculant, Kofasil® Ultra formic acid and Proens™). The third experiment tested whether it is beneficial to add the additive, inoculant or Proens™ at mowing rather than baling or chopping. The herbage was then ensiled in small-scale silos or large round bales. The results indicate that increasing dry matter (DM) content of the herbage reduces water soluble N (WSN) content of silage. Tedding the crop made the crop dry faster, but slightly increased the losses of energy and crude protein (CP). Also less WSN was found in silage from herbage with red clover than in pure grass. The second and third study showed that there is no difference in WSN between bales and silos, provided similar DM and the same additive. In the seconds study both chemical and biological additives reduced WSN in silage, though chemical additives, in particular the acids formic acid and Proens™, seemed most effective. In the third study, the bacterial inoculant did not reduce the formation of WSN, but Proens did. There {{did not appear to be}} any benefit of applying additives at mowing rather than chopping/baling, though the effect on fermentation, with greater stimulation by the inoculant and greater inhibition by Proens™, seemed greater when the additive was applied at mowing if the herbage was ensiled in bales. The conclusions from the studies are that there is a big difference in WSN between silages. If the goal is to minimise WSN additives and/or high DM content of the silage is recommended. Despite differences in fermentation silage from the same crop, treated with the same additive will contain similar amounts of WSN.

40|$|Forage {{type and}} {{management}} influences the nutritional quality and fatty acid (FA) composition of ruminant milk. Replacing grass silage with red clover (RC, Trifolium pratense L.) silage increases milk fat 18 : 3 n- 3 concentration. Red clover {{has a higher}} polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activity compared with grasses which has been suggested to decrease lipolysis in silo and in vivo. The present study characterized the abundance and FA composition of esterified lipid and NEFA before and after ensiling of grass and RC to investigate the influence of forage species, growth stage, and extent of fermentation in silo on lipolysis. A randomized block design with a 2 ? 3 ? 4 factorial arrangement of treatments was used. Treatments comprised RC or a mixture of timothy (Phleum pratense L.) and meadow fescue (Festuca pratensis Huds.) harvested at 3 growth stages and treated with 4 levels of formic acid (0, 2, 4, and 6 l/t). Lipid in silages treated with 0 or 6 l/t formic acid were extracted and separated into four fractions by TLC. Total PPO activity in fresh herbage {{and the content of}} soluble bound phenols in all silages were determined. Concentrations of 18 : 3 n- 3 and total FA (TFA) were higher (P < 0. 001) for RC than grass. For both forage species, 18 : 3 n- 3 and TFA content decreased linearly (P < 0. 001) with advancing growth stage, with the highest abundance at the vegetative stage. Most of lipid in fresh RC and <b>grass</b> <b>herbage</b> (97 %) was esterified, whereas NEFA accounted for 71 % of TFA in both silages. Ensiling resulted in marginal increases in TFA content and the amounts of individual FA compared with fresh herbages. Herbage total PPO activity was higher (P < 0. 001) for RC than grass (11 vs. 0. 11 ?katal/g leaf fresh weight). Net lipolysis during ensiling was extensive for both forage species (660 to 759 g/kg FA for grass and 563 to 737 g/kg FA for RC). Formic acid application (0 vs. 6 l/t) resulted in a marked decrease (P = 0. 026) in net lipolysis during the ensiling of RC, whereas the opposite was true (P = 0. 026) for grass. In conclusion, results suggest that formic acid addition during the ensilage of RC decreases lipolysis in silo. For both plant species, total PPO activity was not associated with the extent of lipolysis in silo. However, bound phenols formed via PPO activity appear to have a role in protecting lipid and protein against degradation in grass and lowering proteolysis of RC during ensiling. preprintpublishersversionPeer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Dairy {{cattle farming}} in {{temperate}} regions often relies on <b>grass</b> <b>herbage</b> (GH) -based diets {{but the effect}} of several grass management options on enteric CH 4 emission has not been fully investigated yet. We investigated the combined effect of N fertilization rate and length of regrowth period of GH (predominantly ryegrass) on CH 4 emission from lactating dairy cows. In a randomized block design, 28 lactating Holstein-Friesian dairy cows received a basal diet of GH and compound feed [85 : 15; dry matter (DM) basis]. Treatments consisted of GH cut after 3 or 5 weeks of regrowth, after receiving either a low (20 kg of N/ha) or a high (90 kg of N/ha) fertilization rate after initial cut. Feed intake, digestibility, milk production and composition, N and energy balance, and CH 4 emission were measured during a 5 -d period in climate respiration chambers after an adaptation to the diet for 12 d. Cows were restricted-fed during measurements and mean DM intake was 15. 0 ± 0. 16 kg/d. Herbage crude protein content varied between 76 and 161 g/kg of DM, and sugar content between 186 and 303 g/kg of DM. Fat- and protein-corrected milk (FPCM) and feed digestibility increased with increased N fertilization rates and a shorter regrowth interval. Increasing the N fertilization rate increased daily CH 4 emission per cow (+ 10 %) and per unit of DM intake (+ 9 %), tended to increase the fraction of gross energy intake emitted as CH 4 (+ 7 %), and (partly because of the low crude protein content for the low fertilized GH) only numerically reduced CH 4 per unit of FPCM. The longer regrowth interval increased CH 4 emission per unit of FPCM (+ 14 %) compared with the shorter regrowth interval, but did not affect CH 4 emission expressed in any other unit. With increasing N fertilization CH 4 emission decreased per unit of digestible neutral detergent fiber intake (- 13 %) but not per unit of digestible organic matter intake. There was no interaction {{of the effect of}} N fertilization rate and regrowth interval on CH 4 emission, but effects of N fertilization were generally most distinct with GH of 5 wk regrowth. The present results suggest that altering grass quality through an increase of N fertilization and a shorter regrowth interval can reduce CH 4 emission in zero-grazing dairy cows, depending on the unit in which it is expressed. The larger amount of CH 4 produced per day and cow with the more intensively managed GH is compensated by a higher feed digestibility and FPCM yield...|$|R
40|$|A dynamic, {{mechanistic}} model of enteric fermentation {{was used to}} investigate the effect of type and quality of grass forage, dry matter intake (DMI) and proportion of concentrates in dietary dry matter (DM) on variation in methane (CH 4) emission from enteric fermentation in dairy cows. The model represents substrate degradation and microbial fermentation processes in rumen and hindgut and, in particular, the effects of type of substrate fermented and of pH on the production of individual volatile fatty acids and CH 4 as end-products of fermentation. Effects of type and quality of fresh and ensiled grass were evaluated by distinguishing two N fertilization rates of grassland and two stages of grass maturity. Simulation results indicated a strong impact of the amount and type of grass consumed on CH 4 emission, with a maximum difference (across all forage types and all levels of DMI) of 49 and 77 % in g CH 4 /kg fat and protein corrected milk (FCM) for diets with a proportion of concentrates in dietary DM of 0 · 1 and 0 · 4, respectively (values ranging from 10 · 2 to 19 · 5 g CH 4 /kg FCM). The lowest emission was established for early cut, high fertilized grass silage (GS) and high fertilized <b>grass</b> <b>herbage</b> (GH). The highest emission was found for late cut, low-fertilized GS. The N fertilization rate had the largest impact, followed by stage of grass maturity at harvesting and by the distinction between GH and GS. Emission expressed in g CH 4 /kg FCM declined on average 14 % with an increase of DMI from 14 to 18 kg/day for grass forage diets with a proportion of concentrates of 0 · 1, and on average 29 % with an increase of DMI from 14 to 23 kg/day for diets with a proportion of concentrates of 0 · 4. Simulation results indicated that {{a high proportion of}} concentrates in dietary DM may lead to a further reduction of CH 4 emission per kg FCM mainly {{as a result of a}} higher DMI and milk yield, in comparison to low concentrate diets. Simulation results were evaluated against independent data obtained at three different laboratories in indirect calorimetry trials with cows consuming GH mainly. The model predicted the average of observed values reasonably, but systematic deviations remained between individual laboratories and root mean squared prediction error was a proportion of 0 · 12 of the observed mean. Both observed and predicted emission expressed in g CH 4 /kg DM intake decreased upon an increase in dietary N:organic matter (OM) ratio. The model reproduced reasonably well the variation in measured CH 4 emission in cattle sheds on Dutch dairy farms and indicated that on average a fraction of 0 · 28 of the total emissions must have originated from manure under these circumstance...|$|R

What man on coming to such places and watching the rushing, sparkling, foaming torrent by day and listening to its splashing, gurgling sounds by night, does not resolve that he will live in no village that has not a perennial stream in it! This unblessed, high and dry village has nothing but the winter bourne which gives it its name; a sort of surname common to a score or two of villages in Wiltshire, Dorset, Somerset, and Hants. Here the bed of the stream lies by the bank {{on one side of the}} village street, and when the autumn and early winter rains have fallen abundantly, the hidden reservoirs within the chalk hills are filled to overflowing; then the water finds its way out and fills the dry old channel and sometimes turns the whole street into a rushing river, to the immense joy of the village children. They are like ducks, hatched and reared at some upland farm where there was not even a muddy pool to dibble in. For a season (the wet one) the village women have water at their own doors and can go out and dip pails in it as often as they want. When spring comes it is still flowing merrily, trying to make you believe that it is going to flow for ever; beautiful, green water-loving plants and grasses spring up and flourish along the roadside, and you may see comfrey and water forget-me-not in flower. Pools, too, have been formed in some deep, hollow places; they are fringed with tall grasses, whitened over with bloom of water-crowfoot, and poa grass grows up from the bottom to spread its green tresses over the surface.
