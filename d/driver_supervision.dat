40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the overall {{design and implementation}} of a video sensor {{for the detection of}} risky behaviors of car drivers near previously identified and georeferenced black spots. The main goal is to provide the driver with a visual audio alert that informs of the proximity of an area of high incidence of highway accidents only if their driving behavior could result in a risky situation. It proposes a video sensor for detecting and supervising driver behavior, its main objective being manual distractions, so hand <b>driver</b> <b>supervision</b> is performed. A GPS signal is also considered, the GPS information is compared with a database of global positioning Black Spots to determine the relative proximity of a risky area. The outputs of the video sensor and GPS sensor are combined to evaluate a possible risky behavior. The results are promising in terms of risk analysis in order to be validated for use {{in the context of the}} automotive industry as future work...|$|E
40|$|This study {{identified}} casualty crash types {{for which}} teen drivers experience excess risk relative to adults. Michigan State Police crash records {{were used to}} examine casualty crashes in two statewide populations of drivers who experienced at least one crash from 1989 – 1996 (pre-graduated driver licensing in Michigan) : teens (ages 16 – 19) and adults (ages 45 – 65). Rates and rate ratios (RR) based on crash occurrence per 100, 000 person miles driven (PMD) compared teens and adults from the two statewide populations. Excess risk {{was defined as a}} RR for a specific type of crash that was significantly greater than the RR for all crashes combined. The RRs for all crashes combined for teenage males was 2. 41 and 1. 75 for teenage females. RRs for teenage males ranged from a low of 2. 16 for casualty crashes attributed to alcohol to 8. 98 for casualty road departure crashes at night. Among teenage females, RRs ranged from 2. 06 for casualty crashes on the weekend to 7. 86 for casualty crashes at night with passengers. Casualty crash rates for teenage males ranged from 0. 21 per 100, 000 PMD for rollover crashes to 1. 95 per 100, 000 PMD for crashes with passengers. Among teen females, casualty crash rates ranged from 0. 21 per 100, 000 PMD for drink/driving with passengers to 3. 31 per 100, 000 PMD for crashes with passengers.

40|$|<b>Driver</b> <b>supervision</b> {{is crucial}} in safety systems for the driver. It is {{important}} to monitor the driver to understand his necessities, patterns of movements and behaviour under determined circumstances. The availability of an accurate tool to supervise the driver’s behaviour allows multiple objectives to be achieved such as the detection of drowsiness (analysing the head movements and blinking pattern) and distraction (estimating where the driver is looking by studying the head and eyes position). Once the misbehaviour is detected in both cases an alarm, of the correct type according to the situation, could be triggered to correct the driver’s behaviour. This application distinguishes itself form other driving assistance systems {{due to the fact}} that it is oriented to analyse the inside of the vehicle instead of the outside. It is important to notice that inside supervising applications are as important as the outside supervising applications because if the driver falls asleep, a pedestrian detection algorithm can do only limited actions to prevent the accident. All this under the best and predetermined circumstances. The application has the potential to be used to estimate if the driver is looking at certain area where another application detected that an obstacle is present (inert object, animal or pedestrian). Although the market has already available technologies, able to provide automatic driver monitoring, the associated cost of the sensors to accomplish this task is very high as it is not a popular product (compared to other home or entertaining devices) nor there is a market with a high demand and supply for this sensors. Many of these technologies require external and invasive devices (attach one or a set of sensors to the body) which may interfere the driving movements proper of the nature of the driver under no supervised conditions. Current applications based on computer vision take advantage of the latest development of information technologies and the increase in computational power to create applications that fit to the criteria of a non-invasive method for driving monitoring application. Technologies such as stereo and time of flight cameras are able to overcome some of the difficulties related to computer vision applications such as extreme lighting conditions (too dark or too bright) saturation of the colour sensors and lack of depth information. It is true that the combination of different sensors can overcome this problems by performing multiple scans from different areas or by combining the information obtained from different devices but this requires an additional step of calibration, positioning and it involves a dependability factor of the application on not one but as many sensors included in the task to perform the supervision because if one of them fails, the results may not be correct. Some of the recent gaming sensors available in the market, such as the Kinect sensor bar form Microsoft, are providing a new set of previously-expensive sensors embedded in a low cost device, thus providing 3 D information together with some additional features and without the need for complex sets of handcrafted system that can fail as previously mentioned. The proposed solution in this thesis monitors the driver by using the different data from the Kinect sensor (depth information, infrared and colour image). The fusion of the information from the different sources allows the usage of 2 D and 3 D algorithms in order to provide a reliable face detection, accurate pose estimation and trustable detection of facial features such as the eyes and nose. The system will compare, with an average speed over 10 Hz, the initial face capture with the next frames, it will compare by an iterative algorithm previously configured with the compromise of accuracy and speed. In order to determine the reliability and accuracy of the proposed system, several tests were performed for the head-pose orientation algorithm with an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) attached to the back of the head of the collaborative subjects. The inertial measurements provided by the IMU were used as a ground truth for three degrees of freedom (3 DoF) tests (yaw, pitch and roll). Finally, the tests results were compared with those available in current literature to check the performance of the algorithm presented. Estimating the head orientation is the main function of this proposal as it is the one that delivers more information to estimate the behaviour of the driver. Whether it is to have a first estimation if the driver is looking to the front or if it is presenting signs of fatigue when nodding. Supporting this tool, is another that is in charge of the analysis of the colour image that will deal with the study of the eyes of the driver. From this study, it will be possible to estimate where the driver is looking at by estimating the gaze orientation through the position of the pupil. The gaze orientation would help, along with the head orientation, to have a more accurate guess regarding where the driver is looking. The gaze orientation is then a support tool that complements the head orientation. Another way to estimate a hazardous situation is with the analysis of the opening of the eyes. It can be estimated if the driver is tired through the study of the driver’s blinking pattern during a determined time. If it is so, the driver increases the chance to cause an accident due to drowsiness. The part of the whole solution that deals with solving this problem will analyse one eye of the driver to estimate if it is closed or open according to the analysis of dark regions in the image. Once the state of the eye is determined, an analysis during a determined period of time will be done in order to know if the eye was most of the time closed or open and thus estimate in a more accurate way if the driver is falling asleep or not. This 2 modules, drowsiness detector and gaze estimator, will complement the estimation of the head orientation with the goal of getting more certainty regarding the driver’s status and, when possible, to prevent an accident due to misbehaviours. It is worth to mention that the Kinect sensor is built specifically for indoor use and connected to a video console, not for the outside. Therefore, it is inevitable that some limitations arise when performing monitoring under real driving conditions. They will be discussed in this proposal. However, the algorithm presented can be used with any point-cloud based sensor (stereo cameras, time of flight cameras, laser scanners etc [...] .); more expensive, but less sensitive compared to the former. Future works are described at the end in order to show the scalability of this proposal. La supervisión del conductor es crucial en los sistemas de asistencia a la conducción. Resulta importante monitorizarle para entender sus necesidades, patrones de movimiento y comportamiento bajo determinadas circunstancias. La disponibilidad de una herramienta precisa que supervise el comportamiento del conductor permite que varios objetivos sean alcanzados como la detección de somnolencia (analizando los movimientos de la cabeza y parpadeo) y distracción (estimando hacia donde está mirando por medio del estudio de la posición tanto de la cabeza como de los ojos). En ambos casos, una vez detectado el mal comportamiento, se podría activar una alarma del tipo adecuado según la situación que le corresponde con el objetivo de corregir su comportamiento del conductor Esta aplicación se distingue de otros sistemas avanzados de asistencia la conducción debido al hecho de que está orientada al análisis interior del vehículo en lugar del exterior. Es importante notar que las aplicaciones de supervisión interna son tan importantes como las del exterior debido a que si el conductor se duerme, un sistema de detección de peatones o vehículos sólo podrá hacer ciertas maniobras para evitar un accidente. Todo esto bajo las condiciones idóneas y circunstancias predeterminadas. Esta aplicación tiene el potencial para estimar si quien conduce está mirando hacia una zona específica que otra aplicación que detecta objetos, animales y peatones ha remarcado como importante. Aunque en el mercado existen tecnologías disponibles capaces de supervisar al conductor, estas tienen un coste prohibitivo para cierto grupo de clientela debido a que no es un producto popular (comparado con otros dispositivos para el hogar o de entretenimiento) ni existe un mercado con alta oferta y demanda de dichos dispositivos. Muchas de estas tecnologías requieren de dispositivos externos e invasivos (colocarle al conductor uno o más sensores en el cuerpo) que podrían interferir con la naturaleza de los movimientos propios de la conducción bajo condiciones sin supervisar. Las aplicaciones actuales basadas en visión por computador toman ventaja de los últimos desarrollos de la tecnología informática y el incremento en poder computacional para crear aplicaciones que se ajustan al criterio de un método no invasivo para aplicarlo a la supervisión del conductor. Tecnologías como cámaras estéreo y del tipo “tiempo de vuelo” son capaces de sobrepasar algunas de las dificultades relacionadas a las aplicaciones de visión por computador como condiciones extremas de iluminación (diurna y nocturna), saturación de los sensores de color y la falta de información de profundidad. Es cierto que la combinación y fusión de sensores puede resolver este problema por medio de múltiples escaneos de diferentes zonas o combinando la información obtenida de diversos dispositivos pero esto requeriría un paso adicional de calibración, posicionamiento e involucra un factor de dependencia de la aplicación hacia no uno sino los múltiples sensores involucrados ya que si uno de ellos falla, los resultados podrían no ser correctos. Recientemente han aparecido en el mercado de los videojuego algunos sensores, como es el caso de la barra de sensores Kinect de Microsoft, dispositivo de bajo coste, que ofrece información 3 D junto con otras características adicionales y sin la necesidad de sistemas complejos de sistemas manufacturados que pueden fallar como se ha mencionado anteriormente. La solución propuesta en esta tesis supervisa al conductor por medio del uso de información diversa del sensor Kinect (información de profundidad, imágenes de color en espectro visible y en espectro infrarrojo). La fusión de información de diversas fuentes permite el uso de algoritmos en 2 D y 3 D con el objetivo de proveer una detección facial confiable, estimación de postura precisa y detección de características faciales como los ojos y la nariz. El sistema comparará, con una velocidad promedio superior a 10 Hz, la captura inicial de la cara con el resto de las imágenes de video, la comparación la hará por medio de un algoritmo iterativo previamente configurado comprometido con el balance entre velocidad y precisión. Con tal de determinar la fiabilidad y precisión del sistema propuesto, diversas pruebas fueron realizadas para el algoritmo de estimación de postura de la cabeza con una unidad de medidas inerciales (IMU por sus siglas en inglés) situada en la parte trasera de la cabeza de los sujetos que participaron en los ensayos. Las medidas inerciales provistas por la IMU fueron usadas como punto de referencia para las pruebas de los tres grados de libertad de movimiento. Finalmente, los resultados de las pruebas fueron comparados con aquellos disponibles en la literatura actual para comprobar el rendimiento del algoritmo aquí presentado. Estimar la orientación de la cabeza es la función principal de esta propuesta ya que es la que más aporta información para la estimación del comportamiento del conductor. Sea para tener una primera estimación si ve hacia el frente o si presenta señales de fatiga al cabecear hacia abajo. Acompañando a esta herramienta, está el análisis de la imagen a color que se encargará del estudio de los ojos. A partir de dicho estudio, se podrá estimar hacia donde está viendo el conductor según la posición de la pupila. La orientación de la mirada ayudaría, junto con la orientación de la cabeza, a saber hacia dónde ve el conductor. La estimación de la orientación de la mirada es una herramienta de soporte que complementa la orientación de la cabeza. Otra forma de determinar una situación de riesgo es con el análisis de la apertura de los ojos. A través del estudio del patrón de parpadeo en el conductor durante un determinado tiempo se puede estimar si se encuentra cansado. De ser así, el conductor aumenta las posibilidades de causar un accidente debido a la somnolencia. La parte de la solución que se encarga de resolver este problema analizará un ojo del conductor para estimar si se encuentra cerrado o abierto de acuerdo al análisis de regiones de interés en la imagen. Una vez determinado el estado del ojo, se procederá a hacer un análisis durante un determinado tiempo para saber si el ojo ha estado mayormente cerrado o abierto y estimar de forma más acertada si se está quedando dormido o no. Estos 2 módulos, el detector de somnolencia y el análisis de la mirada complementarán la estimación de la orientación de la cabeza con el objetivo de brindar mayor certeza acerca del estado del conductor y, de ser posible, prevenir un accidente debido a malos comportamientos. Es importante mencionar que el sensor Kinect está construido específicamente para el uso dentro de una habitación y conectado a una videoconsola, no para el exterior. Por lo tanto, es inevitable que algunas limitaciones salgan a luz cuando se realice la monitorización bajo condiciones reales de conducción. Dichos problemas serán mencionados en esta propuesta. Sin embargo, el algoritmo presentado es generalizable a cualquier sensor basado en nubes de puntos (cámaras estéreo, cámaras del tipo “time of flight”, escáneres láseres etc [...] .); más caros pero menos sensibles a estos inconvenientes previamente descritos. Se mencionan también trabajos futuros al final con el objetivo de enseñar la escalabilidad de esta propuesta.

30|$|The {{results of}} {{investigations}} into causes of LX accidents have identified inappropriate or inadequate human behaviour {{as the main}} source of the problem. Human factors play an important role for both the road and the rail. Violations of traffic regulations, disregard of warning signals, and trespassing by road vehicle drivers and pedestrians contribute to most of the fatalities. In terms of rail, staff with safety related responsibilities (i.e. manually operated LXs, warnings given by train <b>drivers,</b> <b>supervision,</b> and fall back operations) are particularly vulnerable to human errors. Therefore, design of new technological solutions intended to minimise the impact of human behaviour ought to be based on an analysis of human factors in the context of limiting safety risks at LXs. Such an approach is expected to produce a twofold benefit: it will help increase people’s awareness of risk at LXs and it will minimise the impact of intentional and unintentional hazardous human behaviour. The solution suggested {{at the end of this}} article will consider the highest operational risk at automatic LXs with warning devices and half barriers. This solution can be applied to other LX types.|$|R

This is unfortunate because, when the author followed {{a small sample of}} 16 year old Learner’s Permit applicants through to their Provisional Licence, not only did most of these drivers respond well to prompts to self-monitor driving behaviour, but they volunteered how self-monitoring had enriched their learning to drive experiences.

40|$|To {{preserve}} the independence {{and quality of}} life of our seniors, it is essential to reconcile the requirements of security issues with mobility ones. Public action in road safety can be renewed by being sensitized to the issue of security management, i. e. by searching underlying rationalities from the observed behaviors. This requires studying the security in action from senior drivers' activity analysis. Most of the older drivers use their capabilities in order to build an appropriate response to the driving conditions encountered. These coping skills enable them to remain fit to drive. Starting from practice, this approach allows to redefine the "good driving" rules and thus shed new light on the driving assessment issue. In French, the translation of the word 'driving' is a polysemic term. In this 'habilitation to conduct research' dissertation, it will is used in its generic sense. It includes an objectified part (behavior) and a non-objectified part: the reason, the motive, the act(s) of thought that come before, during or after a performance. The research works I have conducted tried to elucidate the roles of cognitive, affective and conative processes to capture the processes' intermediate parts (or links) involved in the adopted behaviors; we based our investigations on the study of intra and inter-subjective processes. This approach allows us to objectivize the origins and sometimes the causes of behaviors. However, to better understand them, an observation approach must be associated. Indeed, through observation, the objective reasons to act are figured-out by building a posteriori arguments based on observed behavior and statements from the individuals. These two approaches are complementary, they allow to explain and to understand behaviors in order, ultimately, to better act. A central concept in the study of adaptation to normal cognitive aging is the cognitive control (ability to respond to stimuli based on the present context, past indices and internal aims). The study of cognitive control during driving allows the description of different forms of adaptation exploring their dimensions, their mechanisms and their determinants. To understand seniors' behaviors, it is also necessary to take into account their situation, their needs, their physical and social environments to better describe their difficulties and the risks they are exposed to. The complementarity of different tools and methods used to tackle this issue is addressed. The research conducted to date help to clarify aims to be reached in order to increase senior safety, to identify priority actions and also to help public authorities to take rational decisions that maximize both the mobility and safety of older drivers. Through examples, we described the adaptive strategies adopted by some older drivers to safe act against disturbances that appear while aging and we also describe how we can identify older drivers who do not adapt optimally. As attention capacities are essential to preserve a safe driving, an expand section on attentional failure while driving is also presented. Within the two research lines, whose main results are detailed below, it is shown that the concept of estimation bias is central to the implementation of driver' behavioral self-regulation. 1. Older drivers' self-regulatory behaviors were explored regarding declared aberrant driving behaviors and perceived abilities. The study suggests that perceived abilities, especially self-assessed driving related processing speed and attentional abilities, {{play a major role in}} the decision to self-regulate its own behaviors (avoiding difficult driving situations) and that such self-efficacy beliefs are a stronger predictors of avoidance than driver behavior questionnaire. The avoidance of difficult driving situations as a behavioral self-regulation option were also compared between young and older drivers : the older drivers reported greater avoidance situations than the younger drivers, more significant correlations were observed between self-reported driving avoidance and both health-related perceptions and objective indicators of cognitive function among them. To explore if older adults spontaneously draw on their monitoring skills to accurately self-regulate their behaviors, we explored drivers' self-regulation within discrepancy reduction framework and the region of proximal learning : we have shown that younger and older drivers were thus equally able to identify their region of proximal learning. In a complementary study, we have also shown that exposing older drivers to a stereotype threat severely impairs their self-regulatory skills; this is at least partly due to exhaustion of the executive resources appearing through working memory overload. These research works were the starting point for a wider reflection on the implementation of more effective training interventions, especially for older drivers that present a cognitive self-assessment bias. These interventions will allow to support behavior change in order to improve the comfort and safety of older drivers. 2. Due to substantial gains in road safety due to speed reduction, safety-belt wear, and the diminution of driving under alcohol influence, the proportion of accidents due to attention failure while driving increases. In a four years project funded by the French research agency (ANR), we worked in a multidisciplinary team (cognitive and mathematical sciences and epidemiology) to clarify the road safety issues and identify avenues for innovative actions to better supervise the driver. A first step was to identify the risk fractions attributable to different types of attention failure in order to better prevent them. A survey was conducted in Bordeaux hospitals. 955 drivers injured in a road accident were interviewed following their admission to the emergency rooms. They were asked to report their activity and the content and intensity of their thoughts in the moments before the accident. Of the 453 drivers related to mind wandering (MW), the contents proved intense or disturbing for 121. These thoughts were significantly more frequent among drivers responsible for the accident. It thus appears that an accident on ten is linked with a driver intrusive thought (Galéra et al., 2012). Distractions related to events outside the vehicle and driver activity are also associated with responsibility (OR 3. 3 and 9. 6 respectively). Attributable share of casualties related to external distraction is estimated at 9 % (Bakiri et al., 2013). These epidemiological findings show that attention failure during driving is a road safety deposit that may reduce the number of casualties on our roads. In a second step, we also tried to understand the influence of various failure of attention on driver behavior. First, three forms of cognitive interference were studied to describe their effects on simulated driving behavior and the treatment of information (studied with the evoked potentials technic). Visuospatial cognitive distractions impacted anticipation (by observing the contingent negative variation, CNV), while verbal distractions impacted the information processing at sensory and cognitive processing steps. The experimental results showed the differential influences of various types of cognitive control (attentional control, emotional control and behavioral inhibition). Experiments conducted on a simulator and on the road showed that: retrospective and prospective thoughts change ocular strategies (eye gaze and increased pupillary diameter; Lemercier et al., 2014), the increased cognitive effort results in increased heart rate associated with a decrease of its variability and different regulation strategies have been described for the control of cognitive effort while driving (Gabaude et al., 2012). A complementary study have then shown that the real-time detection of cognitive effort is feasible. A survey through the use of an off-line questionnaire was also conducted to reveal the individual and contextual characteristics of driving in a MW state, to describe behavioral consequences of MW on driving and to determine the characteristics of off-task thoughts while driving (Berthié et al., 2015). In this research project, the influences of MW on the accident risk and on the driving behavior have been demonstrated, it provides avenues of research and an insight into new original development. The complementarity of the two types of methods to analyze the impact of cognitive distraction on driving activity by exploratory and confirmatory analysis was discussed. Geometry information methods have been used to analyze data applied from the vehicle side to enable the thresholds identification beyond which it is probable that the driver performs driving competing activity (Letelier, 2012). These criteria are not always sensitive because of the variability of observed behaviors. The psycho-ergonomic analysis of the drivers' activities could help to better describe the various regulation strategies that can be adopted. This approach is required to identify, from the data side, the most sensitive and specific algorithms. This will be the first step towards the development of a <b>driver</b> <b>supervision</b> system, thus contributing to the objectives of reducing road accidents. By comparing different disciplinary perspectives, this project has allowed substantial progress on the subject of attention failure while driving. We began to understand the causes and origins of various attention failure and their consequences on driving. The exploratory analysis of sequential data and supervised learning techniques (data-mining) applied to the data collected on highway are used to search algorithms able to identify a distracted driver. New technological challenges, consisting in the adaptation of driving assistance depending on the driver state, will soon be addressed. The work presented in this dissertation also stress the need to broach health issues in their complexity and not to address the driving ability issue in regard of a unique road safety policy. To take advantage of successful aging, the elderly must evolve with their environment and adapt consequently. The increase of knowledge on this adaptation notion is essential. The knowledge gained on the adaptation to cognitive aging must now be exploited to develop interventions to accompany the older drivers in various stages of adoption of precautionary behavior. In the perspective section outlined in this dissertation, we develop four directions to implement research actions in order to: accompany the public authorities on issues related to the safe mobility of seniors, better prevent negative effects of aging, offer to older users the digital revolution opportunities taking place in the health and transportation domains and lastly to promote a continuum of mobility for our seniors. In future research, it will also be necessary to evaluate the effectiveness of the different actions or interventions proposed, some first ideas in this direction are suggested. Afin de préserver l'autonomie et la qualité de vie de nos aînés, il est indispensable de concilier des exigences de sécurité et de mobilité. L'action publique en sécurité routière peut être renouvelée en étant sensibilisée à la question de la sécurité gérée, c'est à dire en procédant à une logique de recherche des rationalités sous-jacentes aux comportements obserÎs. Ceci nécessite d'étudier la sécurité en action à partir de l'analyse de l'activité de conduite de nos ainés. La plupart des conducteurs âgés utilisent leurs capacités dans le but de bâtir une réponse adaptée aux situations de conduite rencontrées. Ces capacités d'adaptation leur permettent de rester aptes à conduire. Une telle démarche permet de partir des pratiques pour redéfinir les règles de « bonne conduite » et ainsi apporter un éclairage nouveau sur la question du bilan d'aptitude à la conduite. La conduite, terme polysémique pris ici dans son sens générique, contient : une partie objectivable (le comportement) et une partie non objectivable : le motif, le mobile, l(es) acte(s) de pensée qui accompagnent précèdent ou suivent un comportement. Les travaux que j'ai menés tentent d'élucider les processus cognitifs, affectifs et conatifs pour saisir les chainons intermédiaires des processus en cause dans nos conduites; nous fondons nos investigations sur des processus intra et intersubjectifs. Cette démarche nous permet d'objectiver les causes d'un comportement. Cependant, afin de mieux les comprendre, elle doit être accompagnée par une démarche d'observation : en effet, par l'observation, on objective les raisons d'agir en construisant a postériori une argumentation à partir des comportements obserÎs et des déclarations faites par les individus. Les deux approches sont complémentaires, elles permettent d'expliquer et de comprendre afin, au final, de pouvoir mieux agir. Une notion centrale dans l'étude de l'adaptation au vieillissement cognitif normal est celle de contrôle cognitif. L'étude du contrôle cognitif en conduite automobile permet de décrire différentes modalités de l'adaptation. Afin de comprendre les comportements de nos aînés, il est aussi nécessaire de prendre en compte leurs situations, leurs besoins, leurs environnements physique et social afin de mieux décrire les difficultés rencontrées et les risques encourus. La complémentarité de différents outils et méthodes utilisés pour aborder cette problématique est ainsi abordée. Les recherches menées à ce jour contribuent à préciser les objectifs à atteindre, à définir les actions prioritaires et à prendre des décisions rationnelles qui maximisent à la fois la mobilité et la sécurité des conducteurs âgés. Au travers d'exemples, nous verrons comment certains conducteurs âgés agissent en sécurité face aux perturbations apparaissant avec le vieillissement et comment nous pouvons identifier ceux qui ne s'adaptent pas de façon optimale. Nous verrons que la notion de biais d'estimation est centrale dans la mise en oeuvre d'autorégulations comportementales. Ces recherches ont permis de mettre en oeuvre des programmes d'entrainement destinés aux conducteurs âgés présentant un biais d'évaluation cognitive. Les premiers résultats indiquent que l'intervention semble efficace pour améliorer la calibration cognitive des participants, cette piste est novatrice. Elle permet d'accompagner les changements de comportements et ainsi améliorer le confort et la sécurité des conducteurs âgés. Les travaux présentés soulignent aussi la nécessité de penser les questions de santé dans leur complexité et de ne plus aborder cette question de l'aptitude à la conduite sous l'angle d'une unique politique de sécurité routière. Pour bénéficier d'un vieillissement réussi, la personne âgée doit évoluer avec son milieu et s'adapter, la progression des connaissances sur cette notion d'adaptation est donc essentielle. Les connaissances acquises sur l'adaptation au vieillissement cognitif doivent maintenant être mises à profit afin de mettre en place des interventions destinées à accompagner les personnes âgées dans les différents stades d'adoption de comportement de précaution. Dans les perspectives tracées dans ce travail d'HDR, nous proposons de développer différentes actions afin de promouvoir un continuum de mobilité pour nos aînés. Il sera nécessaire de prévoir d'évaluer l'efficacité des différentes interventions proposées, des premières propositions sont formulées...|$|E

Electronic searches for child pedestrian and driveway injuries from the peer-reviewed literature and transport-related websites from 1955 to 2012. Study Selection. 41 studies met the study inclusion criteria. Data Extraction. A systematic narrative summary was conducted that included study design, methodology, risk factors, and other study variables. Results. The most commonly reported risk factors for LSVRO incidents included age under 5 years, male gender, and reversing vehicles. The majority of reported incidents involved residential driveways, but several studies identified other traffic and nontraffic locations. Low socioeconomic status and rental accommodation were also associated with LSVRO injury. Vehicles were most commonly driven by a family member, predominantly a parent. Conclusion. There {{are a number of}} modifiable vehicular, environmental, and behavioural factors associated with LSVRO injuries in young children that have been identified in the literature to date. Strategies relating to vehicle design (devices for increased rearward visibility and crash avoidance systems), housing design (physical separation of driveway and play areas), and behaviour (<b>driver</b> behaviour, <b>supervision</b> of youn...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the transport of}} children in automobiles {{and the use of}} child restraints systems (CRS). Methods: This is a transversal descriptive study which included 200 vehicle drivers who carried 0 - 10 year old children in the city of São Luis, MA, Brazil. The drivers' passengers' and children's features were properly identified. The children's transportation using CRS were analyzed according to the Resolution 277 / 8 of the Brazilian National Traffic Department. Results: The transportation of children was classified as inappropriate in 70. 5 % of the vehicles analyzed. The most common way for children transportation was free on the back seats (47 %) or on the lap of passengers/drivers (17 %). The main reasons to justify the improper transportation were either not understanding the importance of CRS use (64. 5 %) or not having financial resources to buy the devices. The child safety seat was the most used CRS (50. 8 %) among vehicles with proper child transportation system. Conclusion: The transportation of children was inappropriate in most of the vehicles analyzed, reflecting the need for creating awareness among automobile <b>drivers,</b> including education, <b>supervision</b> and improvement of policies for health improvement and prevention of accidents involving children transportation.
