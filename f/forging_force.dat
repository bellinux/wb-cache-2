In the author’s opinion, Spot Welding Procedures Chart D. 1 (hereafter {{referred}} to as Figure D. 1) in Appendix D of International Standard ISO 15609 - 5 [1] is not accurate in principle. This figure is not suitable for materials need exerting <b>forging</b> <b>force</b> for spot welding such as aluminum alloy, especially hard aluminum alloy, for it does not correctively reflect loading moment of <b>forging</b> <b>force.</b> In the author’s opinion, the loading moment of <b>forging</b> <b>force</b> given by Figure D. 1 is too late, which {{will lead to the}} generation of crack. In addition, two important reasons equally considered to advance loading moment of <b>forging</b> <b>force</b> are: (1) different spot welding equipments have different response time for welding pressure; (2) electric response speed is faster than that of mechanical or pneumatic mechanism, that is to say, response speed of current shall be faster than implementation speed of <b>forging</b> <b>force.</b> Is this paper, we discuss such above-mentioned kinds of different situations. We suggest advancing the <b>forging</b> <b>force</b> in Figure D. 1 to the maintenance course of welding current. We propose an amended spot welding course schematic diagram and a simplified schematic diagram...|$|E

40|$|Friction stir welding is an {{innovative}} weld process {{that continues to}} grow in use, in the commercial, defense, and space sectors. It produces high quality and high strength welds in aluminum alloys. The process consists of a rotating weld pin tool that plasticizes material through friction. The plasticized material is welded by applying a high weld <b>forge</b> <b>force</b> through the weld pin tool against the material during pin tool rotation. The high weld <b>forge</b> <b>force</b> is reacted against an anvil and a stout tool structure. A variation of friction stir welding currently being evaluated is self-reacting friction stir welding. Self-reacting friction stir welding incorporates two opposing shoulders on the crown and root sides of the weld joint. In self-reacting friction stir welding, the weld <b>forge</b> <b>force</b> is reacted against the crown shoulder portion of the weld pin tool by the root shoulder. This {{eliminates the need for}} a stout tooling structure to react the high weld <b>forge</b> <b>force</b> required in the typical friction stir weld process. Therefore, the self-reacting feature reduces tooling requirements and, therefore, process implementation costs. This makes the process attractive for aluminum alloy circumferential weld applications. To evaluate the application of self-reacting friction stir welding for aluminum alloy circumferential welding, a feasibility study was performed. The study consisted of performing a fourteen-foot diameter aluminum alloy circumferential demonstration weld using typical fusion weld tooling. To accomplish the demonstration weld, weld and tack weld development were performed and fourteen-foot diameter rings were fabricated. Weld development consisted of weld pin tool selection and the generation of a process map and envelope. Tack weld development evaluated gas tungsten arc welding and friction stir welding for tack welding rings together for circumferential welding. As a result of the study, a successful circumferential demonstration weld was produced leading the way for future circumferential weld implementation...|$|R
40|$|This study {{develops}} {{and presents}} a friction stir weld (FSW) quality assurance tool based on control of weld zone temperature. Apart from correct tool geometry, tool tilt angle, traverse speed and <b>forge</b> <b>force</b> during welding, one important requirement {{is that the}} weld material be sufficiently plasticised (softened). The level of plasticisation is related to weld zone temperature which is primarily dependent on spindle speed, traverse speed and <b>forge</b> <b>force.</b> When all other conditions are correct, sufficiently plasticised material flows around and consolidates behind the tool without the production of voids in the weld. Typically, weld temperature varies along the weld length which may result in variations in weld quality. Weld zone temperature control makes constant weld zone temperature possible. In this study, thermocouple sensors were embedded in the FSW tool and a weld zone temperature control algorithm was developed. Spindle speed was the actuating mechanism for controlling weld temperature. The system was modelled and controllers were designed using Matlab tools. The system was simulated and the performance was compared to the system performance during welding. The control system ensures that the weld zone temperature can be maintained irrespective {{of the presence of}} thermal disturbances.

40|$|Pull plug {{friction}} welding {{is a new}} process being developed to conveniently eliminate defects from welded plate tank structures. The general idea is to drill a hole of precise, optimized dimensions and weld a plug into it, filling the hole perfectly. A conically-shaped plug is rotated at high angular velocity as it is brought {{into contact with the}} plate material in the hole. As the plug is pulled into the hole, friction rapidly raises the temperature to {{the point at which the}} plate material flows plastically. After a brief heating phase, the plug rotation is terminated. The plug is then pulled upon with a <b>forging</b> <b>force,</b> solidly welding the plug into the hole in the plate. Three aspects of this process were addressed in this study. The transient temperature distribution was analyzed based on slightly idealized boundary conditions for different plug geometries. Variations in hole geometry and ram speed were considered, and a program was created to calculate volumes of displaced material and empty space, as well as many other relevant dimensions. The relation between the axially applied <b>forging</b> <b>force</b> and the actual forging pressure between the plate and plug surfaces was determined for various configurations...|$|E

Considering high pressure die-casting, several applications are present in literature mainly related with low melting point alloys (Al and Mg) because of the limited die life experienced when casting higher melting materials. In the case of conventional forging, semi-solid processing needs higher performance materials and/or coatings for the mould because of the working temperatures; however, the advantages of obtaining near net shape part in a single step, with reduced machining and finishing costs are evident. These returns, combined with the lower required forces that reduce the mechanical wear, make the semi-solid forging technology competitive.

40|$|In the {{traditional}} approach the numerical simulation of the forging process is mainly focused on the filling of the dies, optimising the geometry of dies and preforms, in order to minimise scrapped material, loading on the dies and material flow defects. Some assumptions are frequently adopted such as the uniform or quasi-uniform initial temperature of the dies, the possibility to neglect the dies lubrication phase, the changes of die material behaviour as concerns strength, hardness, toughness due to fatigue phenomena. In order to overcome some of these limitations a forging cycle has been reproduced in laboratory conditions and monitored using a 250 tons screw press equipped with modified dies embedding thermocouples at different locations near the contact surface of the dies, {{as well as with}} strain gauges to measure <b>forging</b> <b>forces.</b> The purpose was a collection of reliable data on temperature field evolution and total forging load during the forging cycles, including loading of the billet, forging, unloading of the forged parts, lubricating the dies.
