25|$|The {{actions in}} a GUI are usually {{performed}} through direct {{manipulation of the}} graphical elements. Beyond computers, GUIs are used in many handheld mobile devices such as MP3 players, portable media players, gaming devices, smartphones and smaller household, office and industrial controls. The term GUI tends not {{to be applied to}} other lower-display resolution types of interfaces, such as video games (where head-up display (HUD) is preferred), or not including <b>flat</b> <b>screens,</b> like volumetric displays because the term is restricted to the scope of two-dimensional display screens able to describe generic information, {{in the tradition of the}} computer science research at the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center.|$|E
25|$|Japan also {{pledged that}} {{if it had been}} granted the rights to host the 2022 World Cup games, it would develop {{technology}} enabling it to provide a live international telecast of the event in 3D, which would allow 400 stadiums in 208 countries to provide 360 million people with real-time 3D coverage of the games projected on giant screens, captured in 360 degrees by 200 HD cameras. Furthermore, Japan will broadcast the games in holographic format if the technology to do so is available by that time. Beyond allowing the world's spectators to view the games on <b>flat</b> <b>screens</b> projecting 3D imaging, holographic projection would project the games onto stadium fields, creating a greater illusion of actually being {{in the presence of the}} players. Microphones embedded below the playing surface would record all sounds, such as ball kicks, in order to add to the sense of realism.|$|E
