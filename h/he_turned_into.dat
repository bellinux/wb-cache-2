5|$|On {{his trip}} to Germany, Ruisdael {{encountered}} water mills which <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>into</b> a principal subject for painting, the first artist to ever do so. Two Water Mills with an Open Sluice, dated 1653, is a prime example. The ruins of Egmont Castle near Alkmaar were another favourite subject of Ruisdael's and feature in The Jewish Cemetery, of which he painted two versions. With these, Ruisdael pits the natural world against the built environment, which has been overrun by the trees and shrubs surrounding the cemetery.|$|E
5|$|In {{the cross}} country events, {{the heat of}} 45°C (113°F), caused all but 15 of the 38 {{competitors}} to abandon the race. Eight finishers were taken away on stretchers. One athlete began to run in tiny circles after reaching the stadium, until setting off into the stands and knocking himself unconscious. Early leader Wide {{was among those who}} blacked out along the course, and was incorrectly reported to have died at the hospital. Nurmi exhibited only slight signs of exhaustion after beating Ritola to the win by nearly a minute and a half. As Finland looked to have lost the team medal, the disoriented Liimatainen staggered into the stadium, but was barely moving forward. An athlete ahead of him fainted 50 metres from the finish, and Liimatainen stopped and tried to find his way off the track, thinking he had reached the finish line. After having ignored shouts and kept the spectators in suspense for a while, <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>into</b> the right direction, realised his situation and reached the finish in 12th place and secured team gold. Those present at the stadium were shocked by what they had witnessed, and Olympic officials decided to ban cross country running from future Games.|$|E

25|$|In fall 1945, Halberstam {{moved to}} the new DP camp of Föhrenwald, a larger {{location}} in Munich which <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>into</b> the center of religious Jewish life for all the DP camps. Here the Rebbe created a communal survivors organization called Sh'erit ha-Pletah ("the surviving remnant"), which operated religious schools {{for boys and girls}} and yeshivos for young men in 19 different DP camps. In addition, Halberstam set up a kosher slaughterhouse; built a kosher mikveh; acquired and distributed religious articles such as tzitzit, tefillin and mezuzot; raised money to help couples marry; and established Halakhic (Jewish legal) guidelines for men and women who had no proof of their spouse's death, enabling them to remarry and start new families.|$|E
25|$|The next Raja (king) of Deogarh was Chand Sultan, who resided principally in {{the country}} below the hills, fixing his capital at Nagpur, which <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>into</b> a walled town.

Coppola was hired as an assistant by Roger Corman and his first job for Corman was to dub and re-edit a Russian science fiction film, Nebo zovyot, which <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>into</b> a sex-and-violence monster movie entitled Battle Beyond the Sun, released in 1962. Impressed by Coppola's perseverance and dedication, Corman hired him as dialogue director on Tower of London (1962), sound man for The Young Racers (1963) and associate producer of The Terror (1963).|$|E

25|$|The {{concept of}} Shayataun (devils/satans) in Islam {{parallels}} the Christian concept of demons and was probably introduced together with angels to Arabian lore by Islam. They are hold {{to be the}} servants of Iblis, who was, like in Christian thought, banished from heaven. If Iblis himself was originally an Angel or a Jinni is controversial in Islamic belief, yet after his fall, <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>into</b> a Shaitan and then fathered the Shayateen. The Shayateen do not die until the last day and can not become believers, therefore they are always evil, seeking for leading humans astray from God, by whispering to the hearts. Furthermore, the term Shaitan and Jinn may overlap, since an evil Jinni is also called Shaitan, like evil humans may also be called Shaitan if they {{are considered to be}} purely evil.|$|E

25|$|Bennett speculated {{in various}} businesses, {{including}} the ferry service across the Christiana River at Wilmington and the Governor Bedford {{house on the}} Strand in New Castle, which <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>into</b> a hotel. He also served as treasurer of New Castle County from 1806 to 1832. Having never sought political office previously, he was drafted by the Democrats, desperate to break the Federalist/Whig stranglehold on the governorship. In spite of his venerable veteran status, he was elected Governor in 1832 by only 54 votes, defeating U.S. Senator Arnold Naudain, the Whig candidate. Serving from January 15, 1833 {{until his death in}} office on July 11, 1836, Bennett was the oldest person ever to start a term as governor in Delaware. He was also the first Governor elected under the Delaware Constitution of 1831 and, therefore, the first elected to a four-year term.|$|E
25|$|The Senators {{knew from}} {{observation}} that Chára {{would be a}} reliable defender, and were also {{aware that he was}} growing into his body and improving his skills each year. However, Chára grew in ways that exceeded all expectations. In 2001–02, during his first year in Ottawa, he recorded new career highs in goals (10) and points (23) as <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>into</b> a bona fide two-way defenseman. His powerful slapshot continued to improve, and Ottawa began to deploy him on the power play to use it, something the Islanders had rarely done. It resulted in four of Chára's goals being scored with the man advantage that season. The following year, in 2002–03, Chára began to blossom into an elite NHL defenseman. He posted new career highs with 30 assists and 39 points and became one of Ottawa's top two defenders, along with Wade Redden. He also earned his first All-Star Game appearance, where he recorded the second-hardest shot behind Al MacInnis in the Skills Competition.|$|E
25|$|Gunther is an Australian of German and Scots ancestry, born in Melbourne on 15 August 1950. He {{attended}} Preston East Primary School from 1955 to 1956, and Balwyn North Primary School from 1956 until 1962. For his tenth birthday, Gunther {{received a}} copy of the now famous book entitled The Golden Book of Chemistry Experiments from an older cousin. Inspired by the book, he started working on various experiments, making use of various chemicals that could be found around in his house. After he spilled some potassium permanganate solution on his bedroom carpet his mother confined him to an alcove in the garage which <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>into</b> a small laboratory, replete with industrial chemicals and second-hand laboratory glassware. Gunther was interested in finding out how things like detergents and oils were composed by cracking them in his fractionating column. He took particular interest in mixing paints for his art classes, as well as his chemistry classes in Balwyn High School. His father, being the Superintendent of Melbourne's electrical power station, borrowed an organic chemistry text from the chemists in the quality control laboratory. This ultimately led to an intense interest in synthesizing Azo dyes. At around age 14, Gunther attempted to predict the color of azo dyes based on the chromophore-auxochrome combination. Apart from drawing up empirical tables, this effort was largely unsuccessful due to his lack of knowledge of quantum theory.|$|E

25|$|Johnson {{began the}} 2012 {{season with a}} 14th-place finish in the Budweiser Shootout after {{crashing}} on lap 74. During the Daytona 500, Johnson {{was involved in a}} crash on lap 2 when <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>into</b> the wall after contact from Elliott Sadler, then was t-boned by David Ragan, also collecting Danica Patrick, Kurt Busch and Trevor Bayne. Damage to the car was severe, prompting him to retire and finish 42nd. Afterward, he finished fourth and second in the Subway Fresh Fit 500 and Kobalt Tools 400. While at Bristol Motor Speedway for the Food City 500, Johnson finished in the ninth position, moving him up to 11th in the Drivers' Standings. Next, Johnson finished tenth in the Auto Club 400, despite having an oil leak, but the rain saved Johnson from a low finish. He went on to finish twelfth during the spring event at Martinsville after being involved in a crash on the first green-white-checker attempt. In the following event, the Samsung Mobile 500, Johnson finished second after leading much of the race before he was passed by Greg Biffle. Afterward, he recorded a third-place finish in the STP 400 at Kansas on April 22, 2012, and a sixth-place finish in the Capital City 400 at Richmond one week later. On May 6, 2012, Johnson started 19th in the Aaron's 499 at Talladega, but finished 35th after his engine failed on lap 110.|$|E
