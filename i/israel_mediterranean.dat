40|$|This article {{reviews and}} evaluates the {{evolution}} of coastal management policy in Israel since 1948. It is argued that a sectoral approach to coastal management, based on the land use planning system, {{has proved to be}} of limited effectiveness. An upsurge of political interest in coastal management, evident in Israel since the late- 1990 s, is explained, and associated policy proposals evaluated. It is concluded that while significant challenges remain, Israel has an opportunity to take a decisive step towards a more effective coastal management policy framework.

Relatively high, statistically significant, correlation coefficients of ÿ 0. 8 and 0. 9 were found between the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) Index anomalies and smoothed (5 year running mean) cool season temperature and surface pressure anomalies in Israel, respectively.
