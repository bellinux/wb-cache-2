30|$|Taking {{the initial}} test {{made me more}} {{confident}} <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>answers</b> <b>on</b> the final test.|$|E
30|$|I {{recalled}} {{information from}} the passage about the incorrect alternatives when selecting <b>my</b> <b>answer</b> <b>on</b> the initial test.|$|R
30|$|The {{initial test}} {{made me think}} more {{carefully}} about <b>my</b> <b>answers</b> <b>on</b> the final test than I otherwise would have.|$|R
6000|$|... "You want to know," [...] he {{repeated}} meditatively, [...] "on what terms I'll hold my tongue for a week. Well, here's <b>my</b> <b>answer!</b> <b>On</b> no terms at all!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Monsieur,' said I, 'in my profession, the {{communications}} of patients are always received in confidence.' I was guarded <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>answer,</b> for I was troubled <b>in</b> <b>my</b> mind with what I had heard and seen.|$|R
60|$|And when {{presently}} he rose, {{took up his}} taper, {{and stood}} by my bedside to ask me once again did I believe myself to be called, I showed <b>my</b> confidence <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>answer.</b>|$|R
60|$|Mr. Burns snorted a contemptuous approval. Jacobus gave up {{the subject}} passively. After a time he unglued his thick lips to ask me if I had seen his brother yet. I was very curt <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>answer.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "There is no harm <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>answering</b> you," [...] said Amelius. [...] "The dream {{really had}} {{something}} to do with her trusting me. You may not think quite so unfavourably of her conduct now you know that." ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{held her}} fast {{against him and}} kissed her brow. [...] "Sweet," [...] he said, [...] "forgive me that I frightened you. I came by the orchard gate, and my coming was so timely that I could not hold <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>answer</b> to your cry." ...|$|R
2500|$|In 2014, Brian Houston {{discussed}} {{being more}} understanding of gay people. Later, he clarified his position after being criticised by some Christians for allegedly supporting homosexuality. In a statement released on Hillsong's website, he stated: [...] "Nowhere <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>answer</b> did I diminish biblical truth or suggest that I or Hillsong Church supported gay marriage." ...|$|R
60|$|You may easily {{imagine that}} I was much gratified by the offered communication, yet I could not endure {{that he should}} renew his grief by a recital of his misfortunes. I felt the {{greatest}} eagerness to hear the promised narrative, partly from curiosity and partly from {{a strong desire to}} ameliorate his fate if it were <b>in</b> <b>my</b> power. I expressed these feelings <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>answer.</b>|$|R
2500|$|<b>In</b> <b>my</b> <b>answer</b> to her Majesty's command for {{my return}} to England, assist {{me that she}} may yield me her favour and liberty of {{conscience}} in religion[...] [...] [...] If this cannot be done, then solicit her for my enjoying my small living on this side the sea, whereby I may be kept from necessity, which otherwise will force me to seek relief of some foreign prince.|$|R
6000|$|The envoy thought awhile, then replied smiling: [...] "It is well, O Egypt; on {{the tenth}} day from now I will attend for <b>my</b> <b>answer,</b> and <b>on</b> the {{eleventh}} I sail hence to join Antony my Lord." ...|$|R
6000|$|DEAR SIR,--I am so {{accustomed}} to hear nonsense spoken about all the arts, and the drama in particular, that I cannot refrain from saying [...] "Thank you" [...] for your paper. <b>In</b> <b>my</b> <b>answer</b> to Mr. James, in the December Longman, you may see that I have merely touched, I think in a parenthesis, on the drama; but I believe enough was said to indicate our agreement in essentials.|$|R
60|$|I {{have reason}} to know that Judge Douglas knows that I said this. I think he has the answer here {{to one of the}} {{questions}} he put to me. I do not mean to allow him to catechize me unless he pays back for it in kind. I will not answer questions one after another, unless he reciprocates; but as he has made this inquiry, and I have answered it before, he has got it without <b>my</b> getting anything <b>in</b> return. He has got <b>my</b> <b>answer</b> <b>on</b> the Fugitive Slave law.|$|R
6000|$|If after a [...] "candid re-examination" [...] of {{the matter}} from your part you may refute me in either or both points, I shall be glad, indeed, <b>in</b> recalling <b>my</b> <b>answer.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh, {{only the}} words of an old rhyme that keeps running <b>in</b> <b>my</b> head,' <b>answered</b> the old woman; and she raised her voice and went on: ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{system used}} {{horizontal}} marking, whereby each {{of a single}} candidate's responses were marked by {{a different set of}} markers. Unfortunately, candidates were not informed that this would occur, and many had assumed the entire form would have been marked by the same markers. Consequently, candidates that cross referenced their answers across the form (e.g., by writing [...] "as detailed <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>answer</b> above") failed to score marks compared to candidates who did not do this.|$|R
5000|$|Palin {{directly}} {{responded to}} that question in Ziegler's interview, [...] "Because, Katie, you're not the center of everybody's universe, maybe that's why they didn't think to ask that question among {{so many other things}} to be asked. To me the question was more along the lines of: Do you read? What do you guys do up there? What is it that you read? And perhaps I was just too flippant <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>answer</b> back to her..." ...|$|R
60|$|ASHER (savagely {{tearing the}} paper in two, and then again <b>in</b> four). That's <b>my</b> <b>answer!</b> I won't have Dr. Pindar or anyone else interfering <b>in</b> <b>my</b> private affairs.|$|R
60|$|MY DEAR HOWELLS,--I {{have just}} {{received}} this letter from Orion--take care of it, {{for it is}} worth preserving. I {{got as far as}} 9 pages <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>answer</b> to it, when Mrs. Clemens shut down on it, and said it was cruel, and made me send the money and simply wish his lecture success. I said I couldn't lose my 9 pages--so she said send them to you. But I will acknowledge that I thought I was writing a very kind letter.|$|R
60|$|With these {{thoughts}} <b>in</b> <b>my</b> mind, I <b>answered</b> Sam pleasantly but firmly.|$|R
6000|$|... "I will see," [...] Peters said, [...] "what can be done. Doubtless {{at first}} she will be so filled {{with the thought of}} your father's danger that she will not think much of {{anything}} else; but on the voyage she will have time to turn her thoughts in other directions, and she is well nigh sure to ask about her father and brothers. I shall be guided <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>answers</b> by her condition. Mistress Martin is a sensible woman, and not a girl who will fly into hysterics and rave like a madwoman.|$|R
3000|$|Some {{students}} made explicit reference to aligning their assessments with {{the expectations of}} teachers: “With self-assessment, I could see what the teachers are looking for in the essay. Of course, there are rubrics for the essays and teachers say what {{they are looking for}} in the test, but with self-assessment I can see more precisely about what is required.” Another wrote how he or she could “improve <b>my</b> <b>answers</b> <b>on</b> next test or essays because I know what the teachers are asking me to do in the test.” Another concurred, saying that through self-assessment, “students will be made to consider how teachers would grade their works and that would lead students to see their works from teachers’ point of view objectively.” [...]...|$|R
3000|$|Megan: “When I feel anxious, it’s almost that I can't {{solve the}} problem or answer the {{question}} clear-mindedly because I'm so scattered and worried about getting <b>my</b> <b>answer</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> time (…) I can't think clearly so if I were to click in a question or have an answer, I don't know if <b>my</b> <b>answer</b> was the correct answer because I'm so worried about getting my points that day that I feel that I don't know. I’m not always having the clearest mind.” [...]...|$|R
6000|$|... "Relieved, so far, I {{naturally}} {{asked what}} had happened. Penrose betrayed a marked embarrassment <b>in</b> <b>answering</b> <b>my</b> question.|$|R
6000|$|... “Sorry, madam, but I’ve just caught {{something}} <b>in</b> <b>my</b> berth,” <b>answered</b> Dave. “I’ll turn up {{the light}} {{and see what it}} is,” he added, as he held on to the object in the blanket with one hand and turned on the electric illumination with the other.|$|R
6000|$|... "Into the cistern, eh? Mebbe {{it serves}} him right. Ain't got no {{business}} <b>in</b> <b>my</b> barn," [...] <b>answered</b> the farmer, {{as he came}} closer.|$|R
6000|$|... "If you please, I'll eat {{the food}} <b>in</b> <b>my</b> knapsack," [...] <b>answered</b> the boy. [...] "Your magic food might taste good, but I'm afraid of it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It always rains when I want {{anything}} very much. I {{seem to have}} a great deal of bad weather <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life," [...] <b>answered</b> Sylvia, despondingly.|$|R
6000|$|... "Such {{things have}} {{happened}} <b>in</b> <b>my</b> time," [...] <b>answered</b> the bee-hunter, [...] "and twice <b>in</b> <b>my</b> experience I've been driven from the field, and forced to let the devils get my 'arnin's." ...|$|R
6000|$|Do our best, the Dawn {{could not}} fetch {{the spot where}} the boat had dropped her kedge. We passed within hail of it, notwithstanding, and loud were the calls to us to shorten sail and anchor, as we came within hearing. Affecting to be anxious to get up to the precise point where the boat lay, I mystified Monsieur Le Gros <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>answers,</b> telling him I would stand on a short distance, or until I could fetch him, when I would tack. As this was intelligible it {{satisfied}} my captors, though a hundred [...] "n'importes" [...] were yelled after us; and [...] "n'importe" [...] it was, in fact, one spot being just as good to anchor in as another, for half a league all round us.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, I {{picked it}} up in the Nome King's palace, while Dorothy was making her guesses, and I put it <b>in</b> <b>my</b> pocket," [...] <b>answered</b> the little Prince.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have plenty}} of other {{clothing}} <b>in</b> <b>my</b> trunk," [...] <b>answered</b> Poole, and then {{went off to the}} dormitory he occupied with Gus Plum and a number of others.|$|R
6000|$|Why, I asked myself, am I not a poet, or verse-maker, {{so as to}} say <b>my</b> {{farewell}} <b>in</b> numbers? <b>My</b> <b>answer</b> was, Because I am {{too much}} occupied in seeing. There is no room and time for 'tranquillity,' since I {{want to go on}} to see something else. As Blake has it: [...] "Natural objects always did and do, weaken, deaden and obliterate imagination in me." ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn this {{contribution}} to the twentieth anniversary issue of Organised Sound, I first recall the reasons for dedicating a periodical to organised sound which I mentioned <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>answer</b> to inquiries from Cambridge University Press before the journal existed. The digital era {{is still in its}} infancy and it will permit a host of new ways to organise sound. I suggest in particular the development of an intimate relationship between acoustic and digital sounds; the extension of structural notations of sound and music and their exploitation for novel musical transformation; the amplification of the use of functions and combinations of functions. I evoke some issues discussed in Organised Sound, elaborating in more detail some problematic topics: analysis and reconstruction of computer music, live electronic music performance, perception of musical sound and sensory aesthetics...|$|R
