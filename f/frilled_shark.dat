5|$|How the ostensibly weak-swimming <b>frilled</b> <b>shark</b> captures active, {{fast-moving}} squid is {{a matter}} of speculation. One possibility is that it takes advantage of injured squid, or those that are exhausted and dying after spawning. Alternatively, it may surprise its prey by curving its body and, bracing itself with its posteriorly positioned fins, launching a quick strike forward {{in the manner of a}} snake. It may also be able to close its gill slits and create negative pressure to suck prey into its mouth. The many small, sharp, recurved teeth of the <b>frilled</b> <b>shark</b> are functionally similar to squid jigs and could easily snag the body or tentacles of a squid, particularly as they are rotated outwards when the jaws are protruded. Observations of captive frilled sharks swimming with their mouths open suggest that the small teeth, light against the dark mouth, may even fool squid into attacking and entangling themselves.|$|E
5|$|Seldom observed, the <b>frilled</b> <b>shark</b> may capture prey by bending {{its body}} and lunging forward like a snake. The long, {{extremely}} flexible jaws {{enable it to}} swallow prey whole, while its many rows of small, needle-like teeth {{make it difficult for}} the prey to escape. It feeds mainly on cephalopods, leavened by bony fishes and other sharks. This species is aplacental viviparous: the embryos emerge from their egg capsules inside the mother's uterus, where they survive primarily on yolk. The gestation period may be as long as three and a half years, the longest of any vertebrate. Litter sizes vary from two to fifteen, and there is no distinct breeding season. Frilled sharks are occasional bycatch in commercial fisheries, but have little economic value.|$|E
5|$|The <b>frilled</b> <b>shark</b> is aplacental viviparous; the {{developing}} embryos are mainly nourished by yolk, though {{the difference in}} weight between the egg and the newborn indicates that the mother also provides additional nutrition via unknown means. Adult females have two functional ovaries and one functional uterus, on the right. Unsurprisingly, there is no defined breeding season for either sex, as this shark inhabits depths at which {{there is little to}} no seasonal influence. A possible mating aggregation of 15 male and 19 female sharks has been recorded over a seamount on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. The litter size ranges from two to fifteen, with an average of six. Females ovulate eggs into the uterus about once every two weeks; vitellogenesis (yolk formation) and the growth of new ovarian eggs halt during pregnancy, apparently due to insufficient space inside the body cavity.|$|E
50|$|The order Hexanchiformes is a {{very small}} and {{primitive}} order consisting of cow <b>sharks</b> and <b>frilled</b> <b>sharks.</b> These sharks have only 1 dorsal fin, 6-7 gill slits, and no nictitating membrane on the eyes. Cow sharks are fairly large and stocky, while <b>frilled</b> <b>sharks</b> are smaller and have eel-like bodies. The oldest fossils from this order can be dated back to the mid-Jurassic.|$|R

5|$|Rather uncommon, the <b>frilled</b> <b>shark</b> {{has been}} {{recorded}} {{from a number of}} widely scattered locations in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. In the eastern Atlantic, it occurs off northern Norway, northern Scotland, and western Ireland, from France to Morocco including Madeira, and off Mauritania. In the central Atlantic, it has been caught at several locations along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, from north of the Azores to the Rio Grande Rise off southern Brazil, as well as over the Vavilov Ridge off West Africa. In the western Atlantic, it has been reported from waters off New England, Georgia, and Suriname. In the western Pacific, it is known from southeastern Honshu, Japan, to Taiwan, off New South Wales and Tasmania in Australia, and around New Zealand. In the central and eastern Pacific, it has been found off Hawaii, California, and northern Chile. The frilled sharks off southern Africa were described as a different species, C. africana, in 2009.|$|E

25|$|The {{southern}} African <b>frilled</b> <b>shark</b> (Chlamydoselachus africana) is {{a species}} of shark in the family Chlamydoselachidae, described in 2009. It {{is found in the}} deep waters off southern Angola to southern Namibia. This species is difficult to distinguish from the better-known <b>frilled</b> <b>shark</b> (C. anguineus), but is smaller at maturity and differs in several proportional measurements including head length and mouth width. It seems to be a specialized predator of smaller sharks, using its flexible jaws and numerous needle-like, recurved teeth to capture and swallow them whole. Reproduction is presumably ovoviviparous, as with the other member of its family.|$|E

50|$|At one point, <b>frilled</b> <b>sharks</b> {{were thought}} to be living {{descendants}} of cladodonts, but they are now thought to simply be curiously shaped modern sharks, despite similarly pointy, snagging teeth.|$|R
25|$|Skeptics have {{questioned}} the interpretation of sea serpent sightings, suggesting that reports of serpents are misidentifications of animals such as cetaceans (whales and dolphins), sea snakes, eels, basking <b>sharks,</b> <b>frilled</b> <b>sharks,</b> baleen whales, oarfish, large pinnipeds, seaweed, driftwood, flocks of birds, and giant squid.|$|R
25|$|The {{southern}} African <b>frilled</b> <b>shark</b> {{looks very}} similar to the <b>frilled</b> <b>shark,</b> with a long snake-like body and a broad, flattened head. The eyes are large and rounded. The sizable mouth is placed terminally on the blunt snout, containing around 30 tooth rows in the upper jaw and 27 tooth rows in the lower jaw. Each tooth has three slender, smooth, recurved cusps, with tiny cusplets between them, and a base that interlocks with the tooth behind it. There are six pairs of long gill slits, with the first pair meeting over the throat. The pectoral fins are broad and rounded, originating just behind the sixth gill slit. The pelvic and anal fins are large with long bases and curved margins. The single dorsal fin is set far back on the body over the anal fin, and has a short base. The caudal fin is low and somewhat triangular, without a lower lobe.|$|E
25|$|Sightings of sea serpents {{have been}} {{reported}} for hundreds of years, {{and continue to be}} claimed today. Cryptozoologist Bruce Champagne identified more than 1,200 purported sea serpent sightings. It is currently believed that the sightings can be best explained as known animals such as lungfish, oarfish, whales, or sharks (in particular, the <b>frilled</b> <b>shark).</b> Some cryptozoologists have suggested that sea serpents are relict plesiosaurs, mosasaurs or other Mesozoic marine reptiles, an idea often associated with lake monsters such as the Loch Ness Monster.|$|E
500|$|More recent {{investigations}} {{have found the}} similarities between the <b>frilled</b> <b>shark</b> and extinct groups may have been overstated or misinterpreted, and this shark exhibits a number of skeletal and muscular traits that firmly place it with the neoselachians (modern sharks and rays), and more specifically with the cow sharks in the order Hexanchiformes (though systematist Shigeru Shirai has proposed that it be placed in its own order, Chlamydoselachiformes). Nevertheless, the <b>frilled</b> <b>shark</b> belongs to one of the oldest still-extant shark lineages, dating back to at least the Late Cretaceous (about 95 Mya) and possibly to the Late Jurassic (150 Mya). Because of their ancient ancestry and [...] "primitive" [...] characteristics, the <b>frilled</b> <b>shark</b> and other members of this lineage have been described as a [...] "living fossil". However, the <b>frilled</b> <b>shark</b> itself is a relatively recent species, with the earliest known fossil teeth belonging to this species dating to the early Pleistocene epoch.|$|E
50|$|Fish were present, {{including}} {{one of the first}} <b>frilled</b> <b>sharks,</b> Chlamydoselachus thomsoni. Other marine vertebrates included the small mosasaur Taniwhasaurus antarcticus, previously known as Lakumasaurus antarcticus. The close relation of T. antarcticus to other species of Taniwhasaurus found in New Zealand and Patagonia provides evidence for a Gondwanan endemism.|$|R
5000|$|Like other fishes, sharks extract oxygen {{from water}} {{as it passes}} over their gills. The water enters through the mouth, passes into the pharynx, and exits through the gill slits (most sharks have five pairs, the <b>frilled</b> <b>sharks,</b> cow sharks, and sixgill sawshark have six or seven pairs). Most sharks also have an {{accessory}} respiratory opening called a spiracle behind their eyes. In bottom-dwelling sharks such as angel sharks, the spiracle allows them to take in water to breathe without having to open their mouths [...]|$|R
50|$|The shark order Hexanchiformes (in a broad sense, {{not only}} {{comprising}} the cow sharks, but also including the <b>frilled</b> <b>sharks,</b> Chlamydoselachidae) is often {{considered the most}} primitive of extant sharks, since they share some features with Paleozoic and early-Mesozoic shark groups as the Cladoselachiformes. Thus, {{it is interesting to}} see how far back the fossil record of this order reaches.|$|R
500|$|In December 2014, trawler skipper David Guillot {{caught a}} [...] <b>frilled</b> <b>shark</b> while [...] "fishing in water {{more than a}} [...] deep near Lakes Entrance", in Victoria, Australia. The shark {{was taken to the}} Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, where its {{identification}} was confirmed.|$|E
500|$|The <b>frilled</b> <b>shark</b> {{was first}} [...] scientifically {{recognized}} by German ichthyologist Ludwig Döderlein, who visited Japan between 1879 and 1881 and brought two specimens to Vienna. However, his manuscript describing the species was lost, {{so the first}} description of the <b>frilled</b> <b>shark</b> was authored by American zoologist Samuel Garman, working from a -long female caught from Sagami Bay in Japan. His account, [...] "An Extraordinary Shark", was published in an 1884 volume of Proceedings of the Essex Institute. Garman placed the new species in its own genus and family, and gave it the name Chlamydoselachus anguineus from the Greek chlamy ("frill") and selachus ("shark"), and the Latin anguineus for [...] "eel-like". Other common names for this species include frill shark, lizard shark, scaffold shark, and silk shark.|$|E
500|$|The <b>frilled</b> <b>shark</b> has seldom been {{encountered}} alive, {{and thus}} poses no danger to humans (though scientists have accidentally cut themselves examining its teeth). On August 27, 2004, the first observation {{of this species}} in its natural habitat {{was made by the}} ROV Johnson Sea Link II, on the Blake Plateau off the southeastern United States. On January 21, 2007, a Japanese fisherman discovered a [...] long female alive at the surface, perhaps there because of illness or weakness from the warm water. It was brought to Awashima Marine Park in Shizuoka, where it died after a few hours. Garman, and numerous authors since, have advanced the <b>frilled</b> <b>shark</b> as an explanation for sea serpent sightings. Because of the shark's modest size, some cryptozoologists have posited the existence of a giant relative, particularly as larger Chlamydoselachus species are known from the fossil record.|$|E
500|$|Most {{sharks are}} ovoviviparous, {{meaning that the}} eggs hatch in the oviduct within the mother's body and that the egg's yolk and fluids {{secreted}} by glands in {{the walls of the}} oviduct nourishes the embryos. The young continue to be nourished by the remnants of the yolk and the oviduct's fluids. As in viviparity, the young are born alive and fully functional. Lamniforme sharks practice oophagy, where the first embryos to hatch eat the remaining eggs. [...] Taking this a step further, [...] sand tiger shark sharklets cannibalistically consume neighboring embryos. [...] The survival strategy for ovoviviparous species is to brood the young to a comparatively large size before birth. The whale shark is now classified as ovoviviparous rather than oviparous, because extrauterine eggs are now thought to have been aborted. Most ovoviviparous sharks give birth in sheltered areas, including bays, river mouths and shallow reefs. They choose such areas for protection from predators (mainly other sharks) and the abundance of food. Dogfish have the longest known gestation period of any shark, at 18 to 24 months. Basking <b>sharks</b> and <b>frilled</b> <b>sharks</b> appear to have even longer gestation periods, but accurate data are lacking.|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to investigate the}} taxonomy, biogeography and biology of cow and <b>frilled</b> <b>sharks</b> (Chondrichthyes: Hexanchiformes). This taxon comprises two families, four genera and six extant species. The hexanchoids are a distinctive group of sharks characterized by six or seven paired gill openings, a single dorsal fin and an anal fin. Adult males of this group lack a siphon sac, but have in its place a clasper sac. This structure, which develops along the claspers, is unique to the Hexanchiformes. Hexanchoid sharks are widely distributed in area and depth. This group ranges from coastal bays and harbors along the open coast out across the continental shelf and down along the slopes to considerable depths. They occur from the equatorial zone to sub-polar regions. However, {{little is known about}} the ecology and life history of these sharks. Intraspecific variation of meristic counts were generally low for the Hexanchidae, but high for the Chlamydoselachidae, indicating that subpopulations, subspecies or even additional, new species exist within this family. Based on the indicators used in this study, maturity in male <b>frilled</b> <b>sharks</b> was attained at 916 mm TL, perlon sharks between 700 and 800 mm TL, sixgill sharks approximately 3140 mm TL, bigeyed sixgill sharks at about 1250 mm TL and sevengill sharks at approximately 1550 mm TL. Male reproductive success did not appear to be seasonal since males were found to contain viable sperm all year round. Female perlon sharks begin maturing between 950 mm and 1100 mm TL. Gravid females and newborns were absent from the other size classes and it is suspected that they aggregate in different locations to those of adult males and non-breeding females. Adult females are known at 4210 mm TL and immature at 3500 mm TL, However, a more accurate estimate of the size at maturity is wanting. Newborn sixgills were caught off southern Namibia during mid to late summer over three successive seasons. The occurrence of gravid females carrying term embryos during spring months and newborns during the summer months suggests a late spring or summer pupping period. Sixgill and sevengill sharks give birth in areas of high primary productivity. Energetically, this is advantageous for the newborns to be placed in an area with an abundant food source. The rapid growth rates of sixgill and sevengill sharks over the first year would enhance their survivorship since neither species has many predators. The number of female sevengills entering the breeding population is regulated to ensure that some portion of the population is reproductively active at any one time. The "staggering" of females which enter into the breeding population in any given year indicates a two year reproductive cycle. Fecundity estimates for 19 specimens with a largest egg diameter of at least 40 mm indicates a litter size of 67 to 104. The recapture of an adult female sevengill in approximately the same location in which it was tagged suggests that the same individual sharks may return to the same breeding grounds. As with any predators, sharks tend to exploit advantages over their prey. The hexanchoids, especially the sevengill, have evolved complex foraging strategies including social facilitation whereby they actively hunt in packs for large prey species. Sharks of the order Hexanchiformes, although lacking the diversity of the major shark orders, nonetheless play an integral role in the marine environment. The group's success can be attributed to their apical trophic position. In most habitats in which they occur, hexanchoids have no comparable competitors since equivalent sized sympatric squaloids and carcharhinoids feed at a lower trophic level...|$|R
40|$|The large size, high {{trophic level}} and wide {{distribution}} of Hexanchiformes (cow and <b>frilled</b> <b>sharks)</b> should position this order as important apex predators in coastal and deep-water ecosystems. This review synthesizes available information on Hexanchiformes, including information not yet published, {{with the purpose}} of evaluating their conservation status and assessing their ecological roles in the dynamics of marine ecosystems. Comprising six species, this group has a wide global distribution, with members occurring from shallow coastal areas to depths of c. 2500 m. The limited information available on their reproductive biology suggests that they could be vulnerable to overexploitation (e. g. small litter sizes for most species and suspected long gestation periods). Most of the fishing pressure exerted on Hexanchiformes {{is in the form of}} commercial by-catch or recreational fishing. Comprehensive stock and impact assessments are unavailable for most species in most regions due to limited information on life history and catch and abundance time series. When hexanchiform species have been commercially harvested, however, they have been unable to sustain targeted fisheries for long periods. The potentially high vulnerability to intense fishing pressure warrants a conservative exploitation of this order until thorough quantitative assessments are conducted. At least some species have been shown to be significant apex predators in the systems they inhabit. Should Hexanchiformes be removed from coastal and deep-water systems, the lack of sympatric shark species that share the same resources suggests no other species would be capable of fulfilling their apex predator role in the short term. This has potential ecosystem consequences such as meso-predator release or trophic cascades. This review proposes some hypotheses on the ecology of Hexanchiformes and their role in ecosystem dynamics, highlighting the areas where critical information is required to stimulate research directions...|$|R

500|$|Several early authors {{believed}} the <b>frilled</b> <b>shark</b> to be a living representative of otherwise long-extinct groups of elasmobranchs (sharks, rays, and their ancestors), {{based on its}} multiple-pointed teeth, the articulation of its upper jaw directly to the cranium behind the eyes (called [...] "amphistyly"), and its [...] "notochord-like" [...] spinal column with indistinct vertebrae.

40|$|The {{study of}} life history {{patterns}} is vital in understanding how organisms {{have evolved to}} fit in the natural world. This generally involves examining features that are both physiological and behavioral, and correlate to the dynamics of growth and reproduction throughout an organism’s life cycle. Chondrichthyan fishes are unique in the fact they have evolved a very different set of life history parameters from teleosts which has made them extremely vulnerable to over fishing. Determining both the general and species-specific life history patterns in elasmobranchs is a pivotal first step in understanding how their life history strategies will influence population growth or decline, but {{a limited amount of}} biological information is available on most species. Sharks in the order Hexanchiformes represent several interesting paradoxes among neoselechians. They are considered some the most ancient and widespread of sharks as well as top predators throughout much of their range, but still remain poorly understood in terms of their specific life history patterns. The overall effect of decreasing numbers of apex predators in marine systems, such as Hexanchids, is tremendously difficult to foresee but appears to be ecologically and economically significant, as well as long lasting. The status of many Hexanchid stocks remains data deficient, although worldwide fishing pressure remains prevalent. The particular life history traits of Hexanchiformes suggest they are highly K selected as a group and possess low ecological resilience, making them highly vulnerable to over-exploitation.

500|$|Highly {{specialized}} {{for life}} in the deep sea, the <b>frilled</b> <b>shark</b> has a reduced, poorly calcified skeleton and an enormous liver filled with low-density lipids, allowing it to maintain {{its position in the}} water column with little effort. It {{is one of the few}} sharks with an [...] "open" [...] lateral line, in which the mechanoreceptive hair cells are positioned in grooves that are directly exposed to the surrounding seawater. This configuration is thought to be basal in sharks and may enhance its sensitivity to the minute movements of its prey. Many frilled sharks are found with the tips of their tails missing, probably from predatory attacks by other shark species. Parasites identified from this shark include a tapeworm in the genus Monorygma, the fluke Otodistomum veliporum, and the nematode Mooleptus rabuka.|$|E
500|$|The long jaws of the <b>frilled</b> <b>shark</b> {{are highly}} distensible with an {{extremely}} wide gape, {{allowing it to}} swallow whole prey over one-half its size. However, the length and articulation of its jaws means that it cannot deliver as strong a bite as more conventionally built sharks. Most captured individuals are found with no or barely identifiable stomach contents, suggesting a fast digestion rate and/or long intervals between feedings. This species preys on cephalopods, bony fishes, and smaller sharks. One [...] long individual, caught off Chōshi, {{was found to have}} swallowed a [...] Japanese catshark (Apristurus japonicus). Squid comprise some 60% of the diet of sharks in Suruga Bay; this includes not only slow-moving, deep-dwelling types, such as Chiroteuthis and Histioteuthis, but also relatively large, powerful swimmers of the open ocean, such as Onychoteuthis, Sthenoteuthis, and Todarodes.|$|E
500|$|With its elongated, eel-like {{body and}} strange appearance, the <b>frilled</b> <b>shark</b> {{has long been}} likened to the mythical sea serpent. The head is broad and {{flattened}} with a short, rounded snout. The nostrils are vertical slits, separated into incurrent and excurrent openings by a leading flap of skin. The moderately large eyes are horizontally oval and lack nictitating membranes (protective third eyelids). The very long jaws are positioned terminally (at {{the end of the}} snout), as opposed to the underslung jaws of most sharks. The corners of the mouth are devoid of furrows or folds. The tooth rows are rather widely spaced, numbering 19–28 in the upper jaw and 21–29 in the lower jaw. The teeth number around 300 in all; each tooth is small, with three slender, needle-like cusps alternating with two cusplets. There are six pairs of long gill slits with a [...] "frilly" [...] appearance created by the extended tips of the gill filaments, giving this shark its name. The first pair of gill slits meet across the throat, forming a [...] "collar".|$|E
500|$|The {{pectoral}} fins {{are short}} and rounded. The single, small dorsal fin is positioned far {{back on the}} body, about opposite the anal fin, and has a rounded margin. The pelvic and anal fins are large, broad, and rounded, and also positioned well back on the body. The caudal fin is very long and roughly triangular, without a lower lobe or a ventral notch on the upper lobe. There are a pair of thick skin folds of unknown function running along the belly, separated by a groove. The midsection is relatively longer in females than in males, with the pelvic fins pushed closer to the anal fin. The dermal denticles are small and shaped like {{the tip of a}} chisel, becoming enlarged and sharp on the dorsal margin of the caudal fin. This species is a uniform dark brown or gray. The <b>frilled</b> <b>shark</b> differs from its southern African relative, C. africana, in having more vertebrae (160–171 vs 147) and more turns in the spiral valve intestine (35–49 versus 26–28), as well as in various proportional measurements such as a longer head and shorter gill slits.
