Republican amendments would have limited appeals by death-row inmates, made it harder to issue health, safety and environmental regulations, and would have committed the president to a seven-year balanced budget. Clinton vetoed a second bill allowing the government to keep operating beyond the time when most spending authority expires.|$|E
5|$|The {{northern}} storm petrels {{are found}} in the northern hemisphere although some species around the equator <b>dip</b> <b>into</b> the south. They are strictly pelagic, coming to land only when breeding. In the case of most species, little is known of their behaviour and distribution at sea, where they can be hard to find and harder to identify. They are colonial nesters, displaying strong philopatry to their natal colonies and nesting sites. Most species nest in crevices or burrows and all but one species attend the breeding colonies nocturnally. Pairs form long-term monogamous bonds and share incubation and chick-feeding duties. Like many species of seabird, nesting is highly protracted with incubation taking up to 50 days and fledging another 70 days after that.|$|E
25|$|Defending {{indirect}} free-kicks provides different {{difficulties for}} the defending team. The wall {{must be prepared}} to charge down the ball once it has been touched by the free-kick taker, and other defenders must be alert to the attacking team's practised set-plays. Getting the ball over the wall and then to <b>dip</b> <b>into</b> the bottom corner is a superb skill. Xherdan Shaqiri approaches the ball from a 90 degrees angle which is very effective.|$|E

25|$|Nowadays, as {{in other}} western Canadian cities, the old {{warehouses}} have long since outlived their utility as the railways {{have given way to}} the trucking on the highways as the preferred mode of commercial transport: in western Canada, as elsewhere, shipping by rail was supplanted by highway trucking once the Trans-Canada highway was extended from Ontario to the West and transport from eastern to western Canada no longer needed to <b>dip</b> <b>into</b> the United States below the Great Lakes. The old warehouses, however, have survived long enough that their destruction is not a foregone conclusion: they are, in Regina {{as in other}} North American cities, being turned into residential condominiums, tony restaurants and shopping precincts. However, at one time the warehouse district (together with the grain elevators adjacent to the CPR line) was Regina’s tenuous commercial raison d’être.|$|E
25|$|Newell's first {{transfer}} dealings were to sign {{two former}} Grimsby players on loan, Jean-Paul Kalala and Rob Atkinson. The winless streak was finally ended after 23 games on 15 November 2008 with a 2–0 win over Bury at Gigg Lane.. Newell continued to <b>dip</b> <b>into</b> the transfer market and in December 2008 the club offered former Liverpool and England striker Robbie Fowler {{the chance of}} becoming a player-coach. Despite positive signs for the deal to come off, Fowler decided to join North Queensland Fury when his contract expired at Blackburn Rovers the following month. Back on the pitch, after a further run of 10 games without a win, Grimsby dropped into the relegation zone {{for the first time}} this season, but moved back up to 22nd place after clinching a vital victory against local rivals Lincoln City. Despite their previous form, the Mariners ran out comfortable winners with a full-time scoreline of 5–1. After dropping back into the relegation zone for a second time, the team recovered once again after a 3–0 victory at home against promotion chasing Gillingham. After an extensive campaign in the local newspaper and with tickets reduced to £5, this match achieved the biggest attendance of the season, with 6406 spectators. This was broken with the next home game against Aldershot Town; the same £5 deal saw 7065 watch a 1–0 win for the Mariners. The Mariners went on to secure victories over Notts County and Port Vale going into the final 2 weeks of the 2008–09 season, Town's previous run of form was heralded by manager Newell down to the fact that new loan signing Barry Conlon had improved morale in the dressing room, not to mention clinching 5 goals in his first 6 appearances in a Grimsby t-shirt. The Mariners were all but mathematically safe from relegation, despite a 2–1 away defeat against relegation rivals Bournemouth – which saw the Cherries confirm safety. Fortunately Chester City could only manage a 2–2 draw with Aldershot Town which left City 3 points behind Grimsby with one game remaining, but with a vastly inferior goal difference. Chester lost their final game anyway, meaning that Grimsby were safe; however, they would have been relegated if Newell's previous club, Luton Town, hadn't received a massive 30-point deduction.|$|E

The physical condition of feathers are maintained by [...] often with the application of secretions from the [...] Birds also bathe in water or dust themselves. While some birds <b>dip</b> <b>into</b> shallow water, more aerial species may make aerial dips into water and arboreal species often make use of dew or rain that collect on leaves. Birds of arid regions make use of loose soil to dust-bathe. A behaviour termed as anting in which the bird encourages ants to run through their plumage is also thought to help them reduce the ectoparasite load in feathers. Many species will spread out their wings and expose them to direct sunlight and this too is thought to help in reducing fungal and ectoparasitic activity that may lead to feather damage.|$|E
500|$|In 2015 Hans-Werner Sinn, {{president}} of German Ifo Institute for Economic Research, {{called for a}} debt relief for Greece. In addition, economists from London School of Economics suggested a debt relief similar to the London agreement.

According to this agreement, West Germany had to make repayments only when it was running a trade surplus, that is [...] "when it had earned the money to pay up, rather than having to borrow more, or <b>dip</b> <b>into</b> its foreign currency reserves.

[...] As LSE researchers note, this had the effect that, Germany’s creditors had an incentive to buy the country’s goods, so that it would be able to afford to pay them.|$|E
500|$|Ashdown {{explained}} that filming [...] "EastEnders Live" [...] {{to look like}} a typical episode of EastEnders was difficult, giving the example of a scene involving a ringing mobile phone. In a usual EastEnders episode, the viewer would see a shot of the phone and know who was calling. In the live episode, the caller would have to be visually or audibly obvious, {{as a result of the}} camera set-up and inability to edit scenes. He described the episode's biggest limitation as the weather, explaining that [...] "EastEnders Live" [...] begins with a direct pickup from the previous episode of EastEnders, with the same characters in the same outside location, leaving the crew hoping for a dry night. Sound was also a problem, as sound quality is better using boom rods than radio microphones, but booms often <b>dip</b> <b>into</b> shot during the filming of EastEnders. Ashdown commented that the production crew would be using booms where possible, but that all cast members with dialogue would be given a radio microphone as backup.|$|E

500|$|... "Possibly Maybe" [...] is {{a fusion}} of trip hop and chill-out music, which the San Francisco Chronicle review called [...] "a fragmented, poetic {{rumination}} on love's ups and downs".

2500|$|Although he {{had been}} singing since childhood, Tritt said {{that he began to}} put [...] "a little more soul" [...] in his voice after his church band {{performed}} at an African-American church. He said that he took interest in how African-American singers put [...] "all these bends and sweeps and curls" [...] in their voices, and began emulating that sound. While performing at these churches, he also took interest in gospel singers such as Andraé Crouch. Later on, he began listening to Southern rock acts such as The Allman Brothers Band through the recommendation of a friend, as well as the bluegrass music that his uncle exposed him to. Tritt said that he found his songwriting began to develop during the creation of his demo tape, when he had written a song called [...] "Gambler's Blues" [...] that [...] "felt a lot more connected to Southern rock" [...] than his previous writings.

Stephen Thomas Erlewine contrasts him with contemporaries Clint Black and Garth Brooks, saying that Tritt was [...] "the only one not to wear a [...] hat and the only one to <b>dip</b> <b>into</b> bluesy Southern rock. Consequently, he developed a gutsy, outlaw image that distinguished him from the pack." [...] Zell Miller, in the book They Heard Georgia Singing, said that Tritt has an [...] "unerring ability to walk the narrow path between his country heritage and his rock leanings to the acclaim of the devotees of both." ...|$|E
2500|$|Handmade {{paper is}} {{manufactured}} using a metal screen {{held in a}} wood frame which is dipped into a paper slurry, after which the frame is shaken in a particular manner to set the fibers of the paper and form a sheet, which is then removed to dry. The screen would usually have attached a design made of copper or brass wire which would leave a slight impression or watermark in the sheet of paper. In his 1952 article [...] "Watermarks are Twins", Stevenson discussed a fact that few bibliographers then understood, that handmade paper in earlier periods was ordinarily manufactured using twin moulds, the screens of which bore a near duplicate wire image producing almost identical, but nevertheless distinguishable, watermarks. Two workers would use a pair of frames acting in tandem, one using a frame to <b>dip</b> <b>into</b> the paper slurry while the second (the [...] "coucher") would shake the other frame to set the fibers and would then remove the paper to dry. He also observed that, as the screens were used repeatedly to make paper, the wire figures would suffer distortion, pieces of them sometimes breaking loose and having to be retied to the screen. A stock of paper manufactured by hand thus would contain two closely similar watermarks which define the stock for bibliographic purposes, or as Stevenson said, [...] "watermarks like wrens go in pairs." [...] A particular watermark could be uniquely identified by its position {{with respect to the}} [...] "chainlines" [...] formed by the metal screen, its state of freshness or deterioration, and the precise locations where it was tied or retied to the screen, which show up as dots in the watermark. He would later use these basic observations to date the manufacture of paper used in early printed books.|$|E
