5|$|There {{are several}} {{nomenclatural}} {{problems with the}} current use of the name Pachylemur. First, Filhol had himself used the name Pachylemur in 1874 {{for a group of}} primitive primates, including Adapis, that he considered intermediate between pachyderms and lemurs. Several other authors mentioned this name in the 19th and early 20th centuries, but it is questionable that any rendered the name available under the rules of zoological nomenclature. Still, this name potentially renders Pachylemur Lamberton, 1948, invalid under the Principle of <b>Homonymy.</b> In addition, the generic name Palaeochirogalus Grandidier, 1899, predates Pachylemur Lamberton, 1948, by half a century and thus takes precedence under the Principle of Priority, and Pachylemur Lamberton is itself unavailable because Lamberton failed to select a type species. To conserve the name Pachylemur, Jelle Zijlstra, Colin Groves, and Alex Dunkel submitted a petition to the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature in 2011. The petition asks the Commission to suppress the names Pachylemur Filhol, 1874, Pachylemur Palmer, 1904 (based on Filhol's name), and Palaeochirogalus Grandidier, 1899, and to make Pachylemur Lamberton, 1948, retroactively available with Lemur insignis as its type species.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The {{availability}} of automatic tools for inferring semantics of database schemes {{is useful to}} solve several database design problems such as, that of obtaining Cooperative Information Systems or Data Warehouses from large sets of data sources. In this context, a main problem is to single out similarities or dissimilarities among scheme objects (interscheme properties) [7]. This paper presents graph-based techniques for a uniform derivation of interscheme properties including synonymies, <b>homonymies,</b> type conflicts, and subscheme similarities. These techniques are characterized by a common core: the computation of maximum weight matchings on some bipartite weighted graphs derived using a suitable metrics to measure semantic closeness of objects. The techniques have been implemented in a system prototype. Several experiments conducted with it, and (in part) accounted for in the paper, confirmed the effectiveness of our approach.

40|$|Litchi (Litchi chinensis Sonn.) is a {{fruit crop}} {{with a clear}} niche for {{expansion}} in countries with subtropical climates. One of the main limitations for breeding purposes and optimum germplasm management in this species is the confusion in cultivar denomination among different producing countries and germplasm collections worldwide. Litchi cultivar identification is still mainly based on morphological characters, and <b>homonymies</b> and synonymies are very frequent. To address this gap, a molecular {{study was conducted to}} characterize litchi accessions from two of the main litchiproducing regions for the export market, Mauritius and Réunion, and to compare them to those obtained from litchi cultivars from different origins conserved in a germplasm collection in Spain. Eleven simple sequence repeat (SSR) loci were used to characterize molecular polymorphisms among 88 litchi accessions conserved in Mauritius, Réunion, and Spain. A total of 67 amplification fragments were detected with those 11 SSRs, with an average of 6. 1 bands/SSR. Three primer pairs seemed to amplify more than one locus. The mean expected and observed heterozygosities over the eight single locus SSRs averaged 0. 53 and 0. 61, respectively. The total value for the probability of identity was 9. 78 × 10 ? 4. Molecular characterization revealed the existence of 42 different genetic profiles. Several synonymies and <b>homonymies</b> in litchi cultivar nomenclature both within and across geographical regions were found.

40|$|RAPD and {{microsatellites}} {{are used}} in the present study as molecular markers for characterisation of grapevine germplasm material. The studied varieties were located in two germplasm banks in Spain. Thirty nine accessions were included in the study, including some presumed synonymies and <b>homonymies.</b> Sixty six primers were used for the RAPD study. Twenty were selected for the multivariate analysis and grouping of the varieties. Seven varieties had a monotypic pattern. Twenty three accessions were also analysed with microsatellites with the VVMD 7, VVS 2, VVS 5 and VVS 29 loci, obtaining eight different patterns. The high discriminating ability of the RAPD analysis allowed all the studied varieties to be distinguished. A good concordance was obtained for both RAPD and microsatellites when the two analysis were carried out. The following synonymies were confirmed: Moristell and one of the accessions of Monastel; Maturana and Ribadavia; Concejón and one of the accessions of Monastrell; and most of the studied muscat varieties. <b>Homonymies</b> were detected for Miguel de Arco, Monastel, Monastrell and Turruntés. Both RAPD and microsatellites are considered as adequate molecular markers for characterisation of germplasm banks with the use of one or the other depending on the objectives of the study. When results are intended to compare with other laboratories or germplasm banks, microsatellites give simple and more comparable results. © 2002 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved.

2500|$|In 1999, Steve Shattuck {{and colleagues}} {{proposed}} conserving the name S. invicta. Since the first description of S. invicta, over 1,800 scientific papers {{using the name}} were published discussing {{a wide range of}} topics about its ecological behaviour, genetics, chemical communication, economic impacts, methods of control, population, and physiology. They state that the use of S. wagneri is a [...] "threat" [...] to nomenclatural stability towards scientists and non-scientists; taxonomists may have been able to adapt to such name change, but name confusion may arise if such case occurred. Due to this, Shattuck and his colleagues proposed the continued use of S. invicta and not S. wagneri, as this name has been rarely used; between 1995 and 1998, over 100 papers were published using S. invicta and only three using S. wagneri. They requested that the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN) use plenary powers to suppress S. wagneri for the purpose of the Principle of Priority and not for the Principle of <b>Homonymy.</b> Furthermore, they requested that the name S. invicta be added to the Official List of Specific Names in Zoology and that S. wagneri be added to the Official Index of Rejected Invalid Specific Names in Zoology. Upon review, the proposal was voted on by the entomological community and was supported by all but one voter. They note that there is no justification in suppressing S. wagneri; instead, {{it would be better to}} give precedence to S. invicta over S. wagneri whenever an author treated them as conspecific. The ICZN would conserve S. invicta and suppress S. wagneri in a 2001 review.

2500|$|The genus Syntarsus {{was named}} by Raath in 1969 {{for the type}} species Syntarsus rhodesiensis from Africa, and later applied to the North American Syntarsus kayentakatae. It was renamed by American {{entomologist}} Dr. Michael Ivie (Montana State University of Bozeman), Polish Australian Dr. Adam Ślipiński, and Polish Dr. Piotr Węgrzynowicz (Muzeum Ewolucji Instytutu Zoologii PAN of Warsaw), the three scientists who discovered that the genus name Syntarsus was already taken by a colydiine beetle described in 1869. Many paleontologists {{did not like the}} naming of Megapnosaurus, partially because taxonomists are generally expected to allow original authors of a name to correct any mistakes in their work. Raath was aware of the <b>homonymy</b> between the dinosaur Syntarsus and beetle Syntarsus, but the group who published Megapnosaurus were led to believe Raath was deceased and therefore unable to correct his mistake, and proceeded accordingly. Mortimer (2012) pointed out that [...] "Paleontologists might have reacted more positively if the replacement name (Megapnosaurus) hadn't been facetious, translating to [...] "big dead lizard". Yates (2005) analyzed Coelophysis and Megapnosaurus and concluded that the two genera are almost identical, and suggested that Megapnosaurus was possibly synonymous with Coelophysis. In 2004, Raath co-authored two papers in which he argued that Megapnosaurus (formerly Syntarsus) was a junior synonym of Coelophysis. Megapnosaurus was regarded by Paul (1988) and Downs (2000) as being congeneric with Coelophysis. Then in 1993, Paul suggested that Coelophysis should be placed in Megapnosaurus (then known as Syntarsus) to get around the above-mentioned taxonomic confusion. Downs (2000) examined Camposaurus and concluded that it was a junior synonym of Coelophysis, because of its similarity to some of the Coelophysis Ghost Ranch specimens. However, a reassessment of the Camposaurus holotype by Martin Ezcurra and Stephen Brusatte published in 2011 revealed a pair of autapomorphies in the holotype, indicating that C. arizonensis was not a synonym of C. bauri, although it was a close relative of C. rhodesensis.|$|E

In grapevines, estimation of the actual numbers of varieties available becomes difficult because {{of the existence of}} numerous denominations corresponding to synonymies and <b>homonymies.</b> Characterisation by means of molecular markers, of thirty nine grapevine accessions, which corresponded to a number of thinly scattered varieties in La Rioja (Spain) and to varieties of other origins, postulated as synonymies of the those varieties, constitute the object of this study. The included varieties, belonging to the collections of the germplasm banks located at Logrono (La Rioja) and El Encin (Madrid), formed five study groups. RAPD and microsatellite markers, both derived from the polymerase chain reaction, were applied to the studied accessions. The generated fingerprints by forty primers and the sizes of base pairs of alleles of four microsatellite loci were analysed. The high discriminating power of the RAPDs and microsatellites enabled the discrimination of all the varieties tested. A general concordance was obtained within polymorphisms with two types of markers, although the RAPDs also detected intravarietal variability. The validity of synonymies was established for the following varieties: Maturana and Ribadavia, Moristell and the accession of Monastel from Alcanadre (La Rioja), Concejon and the accession of Monastrell variety originating from La Rioja, as well as the accessions of Moscatel variety Moscatel Almizclero, Moscatel del Pais, Moscatep Grano Menudo, Moscatel Menudo, Moscatel Fino, Moscatel Encarnado, Moscatel de la Tierra and Jaen Colorado. <b>Homonymies</b> were confirmed in the Miguel de Arco, Monastel, Monastrell, Torrontes and Turruntes varieties.

All analyzed SSR loci were polymorphic, revealing 62 distinct genotypes, including 31 cultivated and 31 wild accessions. Some cases of synonymies, color sports, and <b>homonymies</b> were detected as well as matches with previously analyzed Tunisian samples and international cultivars. Chloroplast microsatellite analyses showed that chlorotype A was most abundant in wild samples (65 %), whereas chlorotypes C and D were more frequent in cultivated genotypes (45 % and 23 % respectively). Genotypic analysis showed that both Tunisian wild and cultivated samples maintain high levels of genetic variation and high average posterior probabilities of assignment to their group of origin. This is {{in agreement with the}} estimated low gene flow between cultivated and wild forms, revealing that most cultivated accessions do not derive directly from the local wild populations but could correspond to materials introduced from different locations or derived from spontaneous hybridizations among them.
