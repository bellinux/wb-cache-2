But, in so doing, {{they are trying to}} make very complex and theoretical something that is really very simple and very practical.... Plausible self-seekers and theoretical die-hards will tell you of the loss of individual liberty.

50|$|There may be {{varying degrees}} of rights to {{possession}}. For example, if you leave a book that belongs to you at a cafe and the waiter picks it up, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>lost</b> possession.

This example demonstrates the distinction between ownership and possession: throughout the process <b>you</b> <b>have</b> not <b>lost</b> ownership of the book although <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>lost</b> possession at some point.|$|R

60|$|Why {{there should}} be more joy over the repenting sinner than over the just man who needs no repentance, we cannot explain in words: but our hearts tell us that it is true, beautiful; that it is reasonable, though we can give no reason for it. You know that if <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>lost</b> a sheep; if <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>lost</b> a piece of money; if <b>you</b> <b>had</b> had a child run away from you, it would be far more {{pleasant}} to find that thing which <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>lost,</b> than never to have lost it at all. You do not know why. God tells you that it is a part of his image and likeness in you; that you rejoice over what <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>lost</b> and found again, because God rejoices over what he has lost and found again.|$|R
