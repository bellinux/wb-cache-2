2500|$|Nagorno-Karabakh has a {{total area}} of [...] Approximately half of Nagorno-Karabakh terrain is over [...] above sea level. The borders of Nagorno-Karabakh {{resemble}} a <b>kidney</b> <b>bean</b> with the indentation {{on the east}} side. It has tall mountain ridges along the northern edge and along the west and a mountainous south. The part near the indentation of the <b>kidney</b> <b>bean</b> itself is a relatively flat valley, with the two edges of the bean, the provinces of Martakert and Martuni, having flat lands as well. Other flatter valleys exist around the Sarsang reservoir, Hadrut, and the south. The entire region lies, on average, [...] above sea level. Notable peaks include the border mountain Murovdag and the Great Kirs mountain chain in the junction of Shusha Rayon and Hadrut. The territory of modern Nagorno-Karabakh forms {{a portion of the}} historic region of Karabakh, which lies between the rivers Kura and Araxes, and the modern Armenia-Azerbaijan border.

6000|$|In {{the theory}} of evolution, the {{tendency}} of a germ to develop according to a certain specific type, e.g. of the <b>kidney</b> <b>bean</b> seed to grow into a plant having all the characters of Phaseolus vulgaris, is its [...] "Karma." [...] It is the [...] "last inheritor and the last result" [...] of all the conditions that have affected a line of ancestry which goes back for many millions of years {{to the time when}} life first appeared on the earth. The moiety B of the substance of the bean plant (see Note 1) is the last link in a once continuous chain extending from the primitive living substance: and the characters of the successive species to which it has given rise are the manifestations of its gradually modified Karma. As Prof. Rhys Davids aptly says, the snowdrop [...] "is a snowdrop and not an oak, and just that kind of snowdrop, because it is the outcome of the Karma of an endless series of past existences."

60|$|The {{adaptation}} of flowers for cross-fertilisation {{is a subject}} which has interested me for the last thirty-seven years, and I have collected a large mass of observations, but these are now rendered superfluous by the many excellent works which have been lately published. In the year 1857 I wrote a short paper on the fertilisation of the <b>kidney</b> <b>bean</b> (1/1. 'Gardeners' Chronicle' 1857 page 725 and 1858 pages 824 and 844. 'Annals and Magazine of Natural History' 3rd series volume 2 1858 page 462.); and in 1862 my work 'On the Contrivances by which British and Foreign Orchids are Fertilised by Insects' appeared. It seemed to me a better plan to work out one group of plants as carefully as I could, rather than to publish many miscellaneous and imperfect observations. My present work is the complement of that on Orchids, {{in which it was}} shown how admirably these plants are constructed so as to permit of, or to favour, or to necessitate cross-fertilisation. The adaptations for cross-fertilisation are perhaps more obvious in the Orchideae than in any other group of plants, but it is an error to speak of them, as some authors have done, as an exceptional case. The lever-like action of the stamens of Salvia (described by Hildebrand, Dr. W. Ogle, and others), by which the anthers are depressed and rubbed on the backs of bees, shows as perfect a structure as can be found in any orchid. Papilionaceous flowers, as described by various authors--for instance, by Mr. T.H. Farrer--offer innumerable curious adaptations for cross-fertilisation. The case of Posoqueria fragrans (one of the Rubiaceae), is as wonderful as that of the most wonderful orchid. The stamens, according to Fritz Muller, are irritable, so that as soon as a moth visits a flower, the anthers explode and cover the insect with pollen; one of the filaments which is broader than the others then moves and closes the flower for about twelve hours, after which time it resumes its original position. (1/2. 'Botanische Zeitung' 1866 page 129.) Thus the stigma cannot be fertilised by pollen from the same flower, but only by that brought by a moth from some other flower. Endless other beautiful contrivances for this same purpose could be specified.|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{research}} was to determine the impact of fermentation with Pleurotus ostreatus on <b>kidney</b> <b>beans,</b> black beans, and oats.

The antioxidant activity (39. 5 % on <b>kidney</b> <b>beans</b> and 225 % on oats in relation to the controls) and content of total polyphenols (<b>kidney</b> <b>beans</b> three times higher regarding the controls) increased significantly by the presence of the fungus mycelium, even after simulated digestion.
