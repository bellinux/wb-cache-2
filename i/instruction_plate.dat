30|$|Ten gram of each {{sample were}} blended with sterile warring blender and homogenized in 90  mL sterile peptone water. The raw grains where however not blended but soaked for 10 – 20  min and washed out by {{vigorous}} agitation. The resultant homogenate was diluted 10 − 2 to 10 − 3 for the heat treated (boiled and fried) samples and 10 − 4 to 10 − 7 for the raw materials. From the appropriate dilutions, aliquot 0.1  mL was spread plated in triplicate onto different media prepared {{based on the}} manufacturer’s <b>instruction.</b> <b>Plate</b> count agar (PCA), eosin methylene blue (EMB) agar and (PDA) potato dextrose agar (all from Biolab, India) were inoculated for total aerobic plate count (TAPC), coliform count and fungal count, respectively. Bacillus cereus medium and mannitol salt agar (both from Oxoid, England) were inoculated for isolation of B. cereus and S. aureus while Salmonella-Shigella agar (Fluka, Germany) were inoculated after 24  h pre-enrichment of sample homogenate in Selenite F-broth, for isolation of Salmonellae. All inoculated plates were incubated at 37 °C for 24 – 48  h for colony formation and enumeration. Exception to this incubation protocol was PDA plates that were incubated at 29  ±  2 °C for 72 – 120  h {{and a plate of}} EMB incubated at 44 °C and 24 – 48  h for faecal coliform organisms. Colonies formed at the expiration of incubation period were counted using digital colony counter (Gallenkamp, England). Counts were expressed as cfu/g of sample. Samples of swabs of food contact surfaces and water were cultured for the presence of coliform organisms, S. aureus, B. cereus and other organisms concerned with food safety. Characteristic discrete colonies on the different media were isolated, and purified by repeated sub-culturing on Nutrient agar (Oxoid). Pure cultures were stored on agar slants at 4 °C for further characterization. For the confirmation of coliform organisms, the method as described by Oranusi et al. (2003) was adopted. Colonies on EMB were inoculated into lactose broth in test tubes with inverted Durham (bell) tubes. Incubation was done for 24 – 48  h at 37 and 44 °C. Gas production and/or color change of dye constituted a positive presumptive test. The broth was inoculated onto EMB plates for 37 °C incubation. Typical colonies on EMB appearing bluish black with greenish metallic sheen characteristic of E. coli or brown mucoid colonies characteristic of E. aerogenes that are Gram negative and non-spore bearing confirmed the presence of coliform organisms. Isolates were stored on agar slants at 4 °C for further characterization.|$|E
30|$|Positive bands were {{purified}} using QIAquick Gel extraction kit (Qiagen™, Germany), {{according to}} the kit instructions.

The quantitative determination of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and creatinine in serum {{was made on}} Hitachi 7180 Biochemistry Automatic Analyzer (Hitachi High-Technologies, Tokyo, Japan). Interleukin (IL)- 1 β, IL- 6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)- 1 were measured {{by the use of}} a commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA), according to the manufacturer’s <b>instructions.</b> The <b>plate</b> was read on a microplate reader (Nippon-InterMed, Tokyo, Japan).

30|$|Cell {{proliferation}} was assayed {{using the}} ProMega CellTiter Cell Proliferation Assay (Promega, Fitchburg, WI) based on manufacturers protocols. MDA-MB- 231, SUM 159, and SUM 149 cells were seeded into a {{96 well plate}} at 1500 cells per well and H 2228, MCF- 7, SUM 190, MDA-IBC- 3, and freshly isolated tumor cells from the patient designated as FC-IBC 01 were seeded at 4000 cells/well, allowed to attach overnight and treated with Crizotinib (Selleck Chemical, Houston, TX) dissolved in DMSO at the indicated concentrations. Experiments were terminated at 72  hrs following treatment, processed according to the manufacturer’s <b>instructions</b> and <b>plates</b> were read at 490  nm using a BioTek plate reader (Winooski, VT).

30|$|An {{indirect}} ELISA assay {{was performed}} {{according to the}} manufacturer’s <b>instructions.</b> Briefly, microtiter <b>plates</b> were coated for 24  h with the samples diluted 1 : 2 in PBS with 5 % albumin. Plates were then washed four times with wash buffer (PBS with 0.05 % Tween- 20), and the antibody was added to each plate for 2  h at room temperature. After washing, a second incubation with anti-rabbit antibody peroxidase conjugated (diluted 1 : 1000) for 1  h at room temperature was carried out. After the addition of substrates (hydrogen peroxide and tetramethylbenzidine 1 : 1, v/v), the samples were read at 450  nm in a plate spectrophotometer.|$|R
50|$|Rulers of {{the period}} often ritually {{assigned}} punishments and rewards to their subjects in spiritually important places to garner the attention of these spirits and ensure that justice was done. The respect of these spirits was deemed so important that prehistoric Chinese ancestors had left their <b>instructions</b> on bamboo, <b>plates</b> and stones to ensure the continual obedience of their future descendants {{to the dictates of}} heaven. In Mozi's teachings, sacrifices of bulls and rams were mentioned during appointed times during the spring and autumn seasons. Spirits were described to be the preexisting primal spirits of nature, or the souls of humans who had died.|$|R

30|$|We used Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain UI- 18 (PA- 7) (ATCC, Manassas VA, USA) {{to examine}} the {{phagocytic}} and bacterial clearance capacity of NB 4 PMN cells according to previously described methods [27]. Briefly, bacteria were suspended at 107 cells/mL in PBS and opsonized with 10 % human serum with end-over-end rotation at 37  °C. Cytochalasin B (10  μM) served as positive control for actin cytoskeleton inhibition. 107 NB 4 PMN cells with or without cytochalasin B were added to opsonized bacteria with end-over-end rotation at 37  °C. One milliliter of samples were taken after 30  min from the experimental tubes, added to ice cold PBS and centrifuged. Supernatants yielding extracellular bacteria were collected, diluted according to protocol <b>instructions,</b> and <b>plated</b> on P. aeruginosa isolation agar (BD Diagnostics Sparks, MD, USA). One milliliter of PBS with 0.05 % saponin {{was added to the}} neutrophil pellet. Cells were disrupted using a glass homogenizer and plated. Extracellular bacteria suspensions and intracellular suspension plates were incubated at 37  °C overnight. Colonies were counted the following day. The results are displayed as colony forming units (CFU) relative to control.|$|R
30|$|An {{indirect}} {{enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay}} (ELISA) {{was performed}} to analyze the changes in 3 -nitrotyrosine content. Briefly, an anti- 3 -nitrotyrosine polyclonal rabbit antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was diluted 2, 000 -fold in PBS with 5 % albumin according to the manufacturer's <b>instructions.</b> Then, microtiter <b>plates</b> (96 wells, with flat bottom) were coated for 24  h with the samples that had been diluted 1 : 2 in PBS with 5 % albumin. The plates were washed four times with wash buffer (PBS with 0.05 % Tween- 20), and the antibody was added to each plate for 2  h at room temperature. After washing, a second incubation with anti-rabbit antibody peroxidase conjugate (diluted 1 : 1, 000) was performed for 1  h at room temperature. After the addition of substrates, the samples were read in a plate spectrophotometer at 450  nm. The results are expressed as changes in the percentage among the groups [19].|$|R
