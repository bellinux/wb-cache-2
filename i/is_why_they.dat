25|$|With {{telomerase}} activation {{some types}} of cells and their offspring become immortal (bypass the Hayflick limit), thus avoiding cell death {{as long as the}} conditions for their duplication are met. Many cancer cells are considered 'immortal' because telomerase activity allows them to live much longer than any other somatic cell, which, combined with uncontrollable cell proliferation <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>they</b> can form tumors. A good example of immortal cancer cells is HeLa cells, which have been used in laboratories as a model cell line since 1951.|$|E

As Spider-Man, he arrives at the doctor's waterfront laboratory and attempts to rescue Mary Jane discreetly. Octavius discovers him and they fight once again as the nuclear reaction swells. Peter ultimately subdues Octavius, reveals his identity, and persuades Octavius to let his dream go for the greater good. Octavius finally commands the tentacles to obey him, and gives his life to destroy the experiment. Mary Jane sees Spider-Man's true identity and feelings, which he says <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>they</b> cannot be together. Peter returns Mary Jane to John, and leaves.|$|E

25|$|Piezoelectric {{speakers}} {{are frequently}} used as beepers in watches and other electronic devices, and are sometimes used as tweeters in less-expensive speaker systems, such as computer speakers and portable radios. Piezoelectric speakers have several advantages over conventional loudspeakers: they {{are resistant to}} overloads that would normally destroy most high frequency drivers, {{and they can be}} used without a crossover due to their electrical properties. There are also disadvantages: some amplifiers can oscillate when driving capacitive loads like most piezoelectrics, which results in distortion or damage to the amplifier. Additionally, their frequency response, in most cases, is inferior to that of other technologies. This <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>they</b> are generally used in single frequency (beeper) or non-critical applications.|$|E
25|$|Following the Republic of Kosovo's {{formation}} of the Kosovo Security Forces in January 2009, he sent protest letters both to the and NATO Secretaries-General. The letter states that Serbia views those forces as an illegal paramilitary organisation that constitutes {{a threat to the}} country’s security and a danger to peace and stability in the Western Balkans. Tadić drew {{attention to the fact that}} the KSF were formed on the basis of the Ahtisaari Plan that was never adopted by the Security Council and added that the creation of these forces constitutes a breach of the Serbian Constitution and international law, which <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>they</b> should be disbanded.

25|$|Outdoors, {{house centipedes}} prefer {{to live in}} cool, damp places. Centipede {{respiratory}} systems do not provide any mechanism for shutting the spiracles, and that <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>they</b> need an environment that protects them from dehydration and excessive cold. Most live outside, primarily under large rocks, piles of wood, and especially in compost piles. Within the home, these centipedes are found in almost {{any part of the}} house. Most commonly they are encountered in basements, bathrooms, and lavatories, which tend to be humid, but they can also be found in drier places like offices, bedrooms and dining rooms. The greatest likelihood of encountering them is in spring, when they come out because the weather gets warmer, and in autumn/fall, when the cooling weather forces them to find shelter in human habitats.|$|E

25|$|European hornets {{have been}} given a {{reputation}} for being very aggressive. Evidence to support this is from the first documented instance by Davis of V. crabro parasitizing the yellow garden spider Argiope aurantia. Davis observed the hornets in Georgia fly into the spider’s web and appear entangled. Looking closer, the hornet was cutting free prey that had been caught by the spider’s web. The spider did not attack or interfere with V. crabro as it was stealing its prey. This also follows the trait that is observed in most vespines that as the year progresses, they change their food-seeking techniques from foraging for food to scavenging, especially once the fall season begins. A common scavenging technique in the fall consists of Vespines loitering around a garbage can, which <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>they</b> are regarded as pests in some areas.|$|E
25|$|The next week, Stacey and T.J. take an {{examination}} and T.J. creates cheat sheets that he gives to Stacey {{when he sees}} Mrs. Logan approaching.

After school, T.J. runs to the Wallace store, which the Logans forbid their children from visiting due to the Wallaces causing much of the black people's troubles. Stacey follows T.J. and the others follow Stacey. Mr. Morrison finds them fighting and separates them, much to the Wallace's anger. Instead of telling their mother, Morrison leaves Stacey to do it himself. Stacey tells her and she takes the children to visit the Berrys. Mr. Berry is badly burned, gruesomely disfigured and mute. Mama explains that the Wallaces are responsible for this and that <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>they</b> are never to go near Wallace's store again.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{above-mentioned}} orders of Feldzeugmeister Ludwig von Welden, the Imperial troops finished on 23 April {{the evacuation of}} Pest, in which at 25 April General Lajos Aulich entered with the II. Hungarian corps. Welden ordered to the brigade led by Major General Franz Wyss to move to Tata, to the brigade led by Major General Franz de Paula Gundaccar II. von Colloredo-Mannsfeld to retreat from Esztergom to Dorog, to the Schwarzenberg division to move from Buda to Esztergom, retreating the Austrian troops from {{the region of the}} Danube Bend (except the garrison of Buda, led by Major General Heinrich Hentzi) and concentrating them around and near Komárom, to be deployable in the eventuality of a battle at Komárom. Welden finally understood that the Hungarian forces which were East from Pest (the II. corps led by Aulich), represented not an overwhelming force, which could have been a real treat to the imperials, if they retreated from their secured positions from Pest and the Danube Bend towards Komárom. This <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>they</b> could concentrate their forces around Komárom, to withstand against the main Hungarian forces preparing to attack them there. But Görgei hoped that his plan of misleading the Imperials was still working at that moment, this is why he ordered the crossing of the Danube, to attack the Austrian forces concentrated there, hoping to use his supposed numerical superiority to destroy them, and to encircle with this the forces which he thought were still in the Danube Bend. He was warned, among others by his chief of the general staff Colonel József Bayer, that crossing the Danube to South is a very risky plan, but Görgei did not change his mind.|$|E
