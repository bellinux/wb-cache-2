5|$|Such {{cooperation}} within {{species may}} have evolved {{through the process}} of <b>kin</b> selection, which is where one organism acts to help raise a relative's offspring. This activity is selected for because if the helping individual contains alleles which promote the helping activity, it is likely that its <b>kin</b> will also contain these alleles and thus those alleles will be passed on. Other processes that may promote cooperation include group selection, where cooperation provides benefits to a group of organisms.|$|E

5|$|Three {{years after}} the Aurum invasion, Pit is {{revealed}} to be trapped inside a ring with no clear memory of what lead to his predicament. Using hosts {{to make his way}} to a ruined city, he meets up with Magnus, who reveals that Palutena's army has turned against humanity and that Pit's body is attacking humans. Using Magnus' body, Pit defeats his body and repossesses it. Viridi then flies him to Palutena's capital of Skyworld which has been reduced to ruins: Viridi reveals that the Lunar Sanctum was a prison holding the Chaos <b>Kin,</b> a soul-devouring creature that escaped when Pit destroyed the base. The Chaos <b>Kin</b> has possessed Palutena and caused her to become deranged. After obtaining the Lightning Chariot, Pit breaks through the defensive barrier around Skyworld's capital and defeats Palutena. The Chaos <b>Kin</b> then steals her soul, leading to both Pit and Dark Pit pursuing the Chaos <b>Kin</b> into its dimension, the Chaos Vortex, to retrieve Palutena's soul. To save Dark Pit from a final attack from the defeated Chaos <b>Kin,</b> Pit overuses his Power of Flight, burning his wings and nearly dying in the process.|$|E

5|$|Once aposematic {{individuals}} reach {{a certain}} threshold population, for whatever reason, the predator learning process would be {{spread out over}} {{a larger number of}} individuals and therefore is less likely to wipe out the trait for warning colouration completely. If the population of aposematic individuals all originated from the same few individuals, the predator learning process would result in a stronger warning signal for surviving <b>kin,</b> resulting in higher inclusive fitness for the dead or injured individuals through <b>kin</b> selection.|$|E
5|$|Rodents {{are able}} to {{recognize}} close relatives by smell and this allows them to show nepotism (preferential behavior toward their <b>kin)</b> and also avoid inbreeding. This <b>kin</b> recognition is by olfactory cues from urine, feces and glandular secretions. The main assessment may involve the MHC, where the degree of relatedness of two individuals is correlated to the MHC genes they have in common. In non-kin communication, where more permanent odor markers are required, as at territorial borders, then non-volatile major urinary proteins (MUPs), which function as pheromone transporters, may also be used. MUPs may also signal individual identity, with each male house mouse (Mus musculus) excreting urine containing about a dozen genetically encoded MUPs.|$|E
5|$|Social {{ecological}} behaviours are notable in {{the social}} insects, slime moulds, social spiders, human society, and naked mole-rats where eusocialism has evolved. Social behaviours include reciprocally beneficial behaviours among <b>kin</b> and nest mates and evolve from <b>kin</b> and group selection. <b>Kin</b> selection explains altruism through genetic relationships, whereby an altruistic behaviour leading to death is rewarded by the survival of genetic copies distributed among surviving relatives. The social insects, including ants, bees, and wasps are most famously studied {{for this type of}} relationship because the male drones are clones that share the same genetic make-up as every other male in the colony. In contrast, group selectionists find examples of altruism among non-genetic relatives and explain this through selection acting on the group; whereby, it becomes selectively advantageous for groups if their members express altruistic behaviours to one another. Groups with predominantly altruistic members beat groups with predominantly selfish members.|$|E

5|$|E. O. Wilson is an American biologist, specialising in {{the study}} of ants, social insects on which he is the world's leading expert. He is known also for his {{pioneering}} work on island biogeography, which relates species richness to island size, an important consideration in nature conservation. Wilson however favours group selection over the Neo-Darwinian <b>kin</b> selection as an explanation of co-operation in social animals.|$|E
5|$|Experiments {{confirming}} {{the role of}} <b>kin</b> selection in worker policing demonstrate the effects of multiple matings, {{which can lead to}} lower average relatedness between workers. Queens of the social wasp Dolichovespula saxonica mate singly or multiply. Researchers who study these wasps have observed a strong positive correlation between worker relatedness and male production. After controlling for the absolute number of eggs laid, these scientists conclude that the queen's multiple matings favor mutual worker policing.|$|E
5|$|Finally, {{selection}} can {{be classified}} according to the resource being competed for. Sexual selection results from competition for mates. Sexual selection typically proceeds via fecundity selection, sometimes {{at the expense of}} viability. Ecological selection is natural selection via any means other than sexual selection, such as <b>kin</b> selection, competition, and infanticide. Following Darwin, natural selection is sometimes defined as ecological selection, in which case sexual selection is considered a separate mechanism.|$|E
