40|$|How women {{compare with}} men in terms of {{empowerment}} and work performance in an academic setting was the main objective of this descriptive-correlation study. The moderating effects of age, work experience, <b>educational</b> <b>qualification,</b> and family role were also examined. Respondents of the study included 263 randomly selected academic staff of a government university; two-thirds of whom were female and one-third were male. Findings showed that women had a "high" empowerment level while men had "moderate" empowerment. Significant differences in empowerment mean scores were noted in terms of age among women, {{and in terms of}} <b>educational</b> <b>qualification</b> among men. <b>Educational</b> <b>qualification</b> came out as a significant predictor of empowerment among women, while age and work experience were significant predictors for men. Work performance for both groups was "outstanding," but women had significantly higher mean score than their male counterparts. Likewise, significant differences in work performance were observed as regards <b>educational</b> <b>qualification</b> for both groups, and in addition, with regard to the role in the family for men. Significant predictors of work performance included <b>educational</b> <b>qualification</b> among the women, and age among the men. Empowerment and work performance were not statistically correlated...|$|R

5|$|The RF {{claimed that}} the bloody civil wars, {{military}} coups and other disasters that plagued the new majority-ruled African states to the north, many of which had become corrupt, autocratic or communist one-party states very soon after independence, showed that black nationalist leaders were not ready to govern. Influenced strongly by the white refugees who had fled south from the Congo, it presented chaotic doomsday scenarios of what black nationalist rule in Southern Rhodesia might mean, particularly for the white community. Proponents of the RF stand downplayed black nationalist grievances regarding land ownership and segregation, and argued that despite the racial imbalance in domestic politics—whites made up 5% of the population, but over 90% of registered voters—the electoral system was not racist as the franchise was based on financial and <b>educational</b> <b>qualifications</b> rather than ethnicity. They emphasised the colony's proud war record on Britain's behalf, and expressed a wish in the Cold War context to form an anti-communist, pro-Western front in Africa alongside South Africa and Portugal.|$|E

Rough data are drawn from four waves (1995, 1998, 2002, and 2004) of the Survey of Household Income and Wealth (SHIW) carried out by the Bank of Italy.

5|$|When World War II {{broke out}} in 1939, the {{southern}} African territory of Southern Rhodesia had been a self-governing colony of the United Kingdom for 16 years, having gained responsible government in 1923. It was unique in the British Empire and Commonwealth in that it held extensive autonomous powers (including defence, but not foreign affairs) while lacking dominion status. In practice, it acted as a quasi-dominion, and was treated as such {{in many ways by}} the rest of the Commonwealth. Southern Rhodesia's white population in 1939 was 67,000, a minority of about 5%; the black population was a little over a million, and there were about 10,000 residents of coloured (mixed) or Indian ethnicity. The franchise was non-racial and in theory open to all, contingent on meeting financial and <b>educational</b> <b>qualifications,</b> but in practice very few black citizens were on the electoral roll. The colony's Prime Minister was Godfrey Huggins, a physician and veteran of World War I (1914–18) who had emigrated to Rhodesia from England in 1911 and held office since 1933.|$|E

25|$|In {{the first}} half of the 20th century, Indonesia (known until 1945 as Dutch East Indies) was one of the slowest moving {{countries}} to gain women's suffrage. They began their fight in 1905 by introducing municipal councils that included some members elected by a restricted district. Voting rights only went to males that could read and write, which excluded many non-European males. At the time, the literacy rate for males was 11% and for females 2%. The main group who pressured the Indonesian government for women's suffrage was the Dutch Vereeninging voor Vrouwenkiesrecht (VVV-Women's Suffrage Association) which was founded in the Netherlands in 1894. They tried to attract Indonesian membership, but had very limited success because the leaders of the organization had little skill in relating to even the educated class of the Indonesians. When they eventually did connect somewhat with women, they failed to sympathize with them and thus ended up alienating many well-educated Indonesians. In 1918 the colony gained its first national representative body, the Volksraad, which still excluded women from voting. In 1935, the colonial administration used its power of nomination to appoint a European woman to the Volksraad. In 1938, the administration introduced the right of women to be elected to urban representative institutions, which resulted in some Indonesian and European women entering municipal councils. Eventually, the law became that only European women and municipal councils could vote, which excluded all other women and local councils. September 1941 was when this law was amended and the law extended to women of all races by the Volksraad. Finally, in November 1941, the right to vote for municipal councils was granted to all women on a similar basis to men (with property and <b>educational</b> <b>qualifications).</b>|$|E
