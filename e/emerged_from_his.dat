5|$|Some Japanese holdouts, {{especially}} on small Pacific Islands, refused to surrender at all (believing the declaration to be propaganda or considering surrender against their code). Some {{may never have}} heard of it. Teruo Nakamura, the last known holdout, <b>emerged</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> hidden retreat in Indonesia in December 1974, while two other Japanese soldiers, who had joined Communist guerrillas {{at the end of}} the war, fought in southern Thailand until 1991.|$|E
5|$|When the Scott family awoke {{the next}} morning, Beauchamp <b>emerged</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> quarters. He feigned {{surprise}} when {{told of the}} murder and was apparently believed at the time. After being told there were no suspects yet, he called for his horse and began his return trip of four days to Bowling Green. Arriving, he told his wife Anna that Sharp was dead. The next morning, a posse from Frankfort arrived and told Beauchamp that he was under suspicion for the murder. He agreed to return with the men to Frankfort and face the charge.|$|E
5|$|Priestley's friends, {{particularly}} other Rational Dissenters, {{urged him}} to publish a work on the injustices experienced by Dissenters; the result was his Essay on the First Principles of Government (1768). An early work of modern liberal political theory and Priestley's most thorough treatment of the subject, it—unusually for the time—distinguished political rights from civil rights with precision and argued for expansive civil rights. Priestley identified separate private and public spheres, contending {{that the government should}} only have control over the public sphere. Education and religion, in particular, he maintained, were matters of private conscience and should not be administered by the state. Priestley's later radicalism <b>emerged</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> belief that the British government was infringing upon these individual freedoms.|$|E

5|$|By lap 13, Häkkinen's gap to Coulthard was two seconds, who in {{turn was}} a further ten seconds in front of de la Rosa. Barrichello, who had damage to his car, was a further six seconds behind de la Rosa, but was drawing ahead of Salo in fifth. Verstappen {{suffered}} an gearbox failure and became the fifth retirement of the race on lap 14. On lap 17, Diniz and Zonta were given ten-second stop-go penalties, both for their roles in the lap one accidents. They took their penalties immediately. Ralf Schumacher <b>emerged</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> garage to rejoin the race on the same lap. Häkkinen had extended his already comfortable lead over Coulthard to 10 seconds by lap 24. Alesi, who was on a two-stop strategy, became the first driver to make a scheduled pit stop on the same lap and exited in thirteenth place. On lap 25, Zonta was involved in another collision when he attempted to overtake Minardi driver Gastón Mazzacane at turn 1 which allowed Diniz to move into fourteenth position.|$|E
5|$|Hancock {{returned}} to Boston in July 1778, {{motivated by the}} opportunity to finally lead men in combat. Back in 1776, he had been appointed as the senior major general of the Massachusetts militia. Now that the French fleet {{had come to the}} aid of the Americans, General Washington instructed General John Sullivan of the Continental Army to lead an attack on the British garrison at Newport, Rhode Island, in August 1778. Hancock nominally commanded 6,000 militiamen in the campaign, although he let the professional soldiers do the planning and issue the orders. It was a fiasco: French Admiral d'Estaing abandoned the operation, after which Hancock's militia mostly deserted Sullivan's Continentals. Hancock suffered some criticism for the debacle but <b>emerged</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> brief military career with his popularity intact. He was a charter member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1780.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to Jayaprakash Narayan's {{call for a}} Total Revolution, Reddy <b>emerged</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> political exile in 1975. In January 1977, he was made {{a member of the}} Committee of the Janata Party and in March, he fought the General Election from the Nandyal constituency in Andhra Pradesh as a Janata Party candidate. He was the only non-Congress candidate to be elected from Andhra Pradesh. The Congress Party led by Prime Minister Indira Gandhi was defeated, ending 30 years of Congress rule in India and a five party coalition with Morarji Desai as its leader came to power. Reddy was unanimously elected Speaker of the Sixth Lok Sabha on 26 March 1977. However he resigned a few months later to contest in the presidential elections of July 1977. Reddy's second term as Speaker lasted three months and 17 days and remains till date the shortest tenure for anyone to have held that post.|$|E

5|$|Little {{is known}} for certain of Josquin's early life. Much is {{inferential}} and speculative, though numerous clues have <b>emerged</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> works and the writings of contemporary composers, theorists, and writers of the next several generations. Josquin {{was born in the}} area controlled by the Dukes of Burgundy, and was possibly born either in Hainaut (modern-day Belgium), or immediately across the border in modern-day France, since several times in his life he was classified legally as a Frenchman (for instance, when he made his will). Josquin was long mistaken for a man with a similar name, Josquin de Kessalia, born around the year 1440, who sang in Milan from 1459 to 1474, dying in 1498. More recent scholarship has shown that Josquin des Prez was born around 1450 or a few years later, and did not go to Italy until the early 1480s.|$|E
5|$|Starting in December 1848, {{a number}} of Wallachian revolutionaries who had escaped or had been set free from arrest began {{mediating}} an understanding between Hungary's Lajos Kossuth and those Romanian Transylvanian activists and peasants who, {{under the leadership of}} Avram Iancu, were mounting military resistance to the Honvédség troops of Józef Bem. Nicolae Bălcescu <b>emerged</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> refuge in the Principality of Serbia, and, together with Alexandru G. Golescu and Ion Ionescu de la Brad, began talks with Iancu in Zlatna. The Wallachians presented Kossuth's proposal that Iancu's fighters should leave their base in the Apuseni and help rekindle revolution in Wallachia, leaving room for Hungary to resist Russian invention, but the offer was dismissed on the spot. In parallel, Magheru reached out to Hungarian authorities, asking them to consider confederating Hungary proper and Transylvania; this plan was also rejected.|$|E
5|$|The {{claim that}} all humans are due {{dignity and respect}} as {{autonomous}} agents means that medical professionals should be happy for their treatments to be performed on anyone and that patients must never be treated merely as useful for society. Kant's approach to sexual ethics <b>emerged</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> view that humans should never be used merely {{as a means to}} an end, leading him to regard sexual activity as degrading and to condemn certain specific sexual practices - for example, extramarital sex. Feminist philosophers have used Kantian ethics to condemn practices such as prostitution and pornography because they treat women as ends. Kant also believed that, because animals do not possess rationality, we cannot have duties to them except indirect duties not to develop immoral dispositions through cruelty towards them. Kant used the example of lying as an application of his ethics: because there is a perfect duty to tell the truth, we must never lie, even if it seems that lying would bring about better consequences than telling the truth.|$|E

5|$|The {{top three}} {{began to spread}} out {{in the second half}} of the race, and by lap 54 Lewis Hamilton was leading Rosberg by 10.06 seconds, with Vettel a further 12.12 seconds behind Rosberg. However, due to Ferrari's earlier attempt to {{undercut}} Rosberg by pitting Vettel early, Räikkönen's tyres were 4 laps fresher than his teammate's, and he closed in on Vettel over the final stint. Having <b>emerged</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> final pit stop 4.84 seconds behind Vettel on lap 35, Räikkönen had closed the gap to 1.37 seconds by lap 54. However, the chance of a battle between the Ferrari teammates was extinguished after a transmission failure on Max Verstappen's Toro Rosso, who was stranded on the start/finish-straight, brought out the safety car for the final two laps, meaning that the race ended under safety car conditions.|$|E

25|$|Priestley {{acknowledged}} that revolution was necessary at times but believed that Britain {{had already had}} its only necessary revolution in 1688, although his later writings would suggest otherwise.

The Spanish assault, carried out by 14,000 regular infantry and 6,000 provincial militia, failed to break the French defenders, who received some help from Pérignon's division in the center.
