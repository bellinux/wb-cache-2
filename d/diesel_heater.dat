50|$|One {{noteworthy}} variant, the CF Electric {{was introduced}} in 1982. It was the first mass-produced electrically powered vehicle based on a fossil fuel vehicle platform. It was built in partnership between Bedford, Lucas, Chloride Group and the UK Government on a 5-year grant scheme. The batteries were housed in a compartment below {{the floor and the}} traction came from a motor placed at the rear with a step down reduction gearbox coupled to the CF's standard differential, but turned through 180'.The motor control system was housed under the bonnet and a small <b>diesel</b> <b>heater</b> provided cabin heating. The system also featured regenerative braking, however this could be turned off as it was found that in wet conditions the motor could lock the rear wheels up in a similar way as applying the handbrake. Most were sold to government agencies, the Royal Mail and local authorities. However, with a price tag much higher than a standard CF, and battery technology at the time not advancing the government scheme wound down in 1987, and the model was withdrawn and spares for it soon dried up.|$|E

50|$|The Vixen was {{designed}} as {{an answer to the}} GMC motorhome. The Vixen {{was designed}} to be stored in a typical garage as it was only 6 feet high and 21 feet long. Despite its small size by motorhome standards, the Vixen was marketed as having all of the features of larger competitors. Such features included a generator and water heater. Two house batteries {{and one of the first}} electric inverters in an RV allowed the owner to run the microwave, air-conditioning, and anything else which could be plugged into 110-volt outlets, off the batteries that were charged by the 120-amp alternator. The Vixen could also be plugged-in at a typical campsite outlet. Water came from the fresh water tank or services at a campsite and was heated by a heat exchanger. The same engine heat was used to warm the passenger compartment. Since diesels do not develop waste heat quickly, there was also an auxiliary <b>diesel</b> <b>heater</b> that could raise the temperature of the engine coolant. This helped with winter starting, keeping the RV warm, and the water hot. The heater was fuel efficient, and didn't need to stop for propane to fuel it. Unfortunately, it was notorious for needing service.|$|E
40|$|From a {{theoretical}} perspective, Electric buses {{can be more}} sustainable and can be cheaper than fossil fuelled buses in city traffic. The authors have not found other studies based on actual urban public transport in Swedish winter climate. Further on, noise measurements from buses for the European market where found old. The aims of this follow-up study was therefore to test and possibly verify in a real-life environment how energy efficient and silent electric buses are, and then conclude on if electric buses are preferable to use in public transport. The Ebusco 2. 0 electric bus, fitted with a 311 kWh battery pack, was used and the tests carried out during November 2014 to April 2015 in eight municipalities {{in the south of}} Sweden. Six tests took place in urban traffic and two took place in more of a rural traffic setting. The energy use for propulsion was measured via logging of the internal system in the bus and via an external charging meter. The average energy use turned out to be 8 % less (0, 96 kWh/km) than assumed in the earlier theoretical study. This rate allows for a 320 km range in public urban traffic. The interior of the bus was kept warm by a <b>diesel</b> <b>heater</b> (biodiesel will probably be used in a future operational traffic situation), which used 0, 67 kWh/km in January. This verified that electric buses can be up to 25 % cheaper when used in public transport in cities for about eight years. The noise was found to be lower, primarily during acceleration, than for buses with combustion engines in urban bus traffic. According to our surveys, most passengers and drivers appreciated the silent and comfortable ride and preferred electric buses rather than combustion engine buses. Bus operators and passenger transport executives were also positive to start using electric buses for public transport. The operators did however point out that procurement processes need to account for eventual risks regarding this new technology, along with personnel education. The study revealed {{that it is possible to}} establish a charging infrastructure for almost all studied bus lines. However, design of a charging infrastructure for each municipality requires further investigations, including electric grid capacity analysis, smart location of charging points, and tailored schedules to allow fast charging. In conclusion, electric buses proved to be a preferable alternative for all stakeholders involved in public bus transport in the studied municipalities. However, in order to electric buses to be a prominent support for sustainable development, they need to be charged either by stand-alone units or via an expansion of the electric grid, and the electricity should be made from new renewable sources...|$|E

Drivers rated the technology as ''acceptable'', however, in individual discussions it became apparent they were not satisfied with the system limitations in hot weather, (over 85 F). The Bergstrom Nite system was recognized as an improvement by drivers and required less direct driver input to operate. While slightly improved over the Parking Cooler, the hot temperature limitations were only slightly better.

40|$|This master thesis project aims to {{investigate}} the circumstances of boil-off for heavy vehicle transports, using LNG as fuel, and suggest possible ways of handling these gases otherwise released into the atmosphere. LNG, Liquefied Natural Gas, is when natural gas is cooled below its vaporisation point, turning it into liquid phase which {{is a much more}} dense way of storing and transporting the fuel. Trucks running on LNG store their fuel in super insulated tanks, but some heat are transferred to the fuel anyway, causing it to vaporise at a steady rate. During driving of these trucks, this vaporised gas is consumed and the pressure are kept at a certain level of 10 bar. Once the truck is turned off, consumption stops and the pressure starts to increase. After a period of standstill, normally several days, the pressure within the tank has increased to 16 bar where a valve opens to release gas from the tank. This is a safety feature, causing the pressure not to increase further creating hazards. While natural gas, mostly containing methane, is released, fuel is lost and an environmentally unfriendly substance is let out into the atmosphere. This should be avoided, to improve the environmental aspects of using LNG as a fuel for trucks, which most likely will be regulated by laws yet to come. Since the release of boil-off gases rarely should happen during the regular use of these trucks, but a system handling these gases should work at any time and place, a cheap and lightweight unit are to be fitted to these trucks. Equipment already on the truck should be used as much as possible, keeping additional costs and weight low. The only practical way of storing this gas, which is the most resource efficient way of handling these boil-off gases, is to re-liquefy it and transferring it back to the usual LNG tank on the vehicle. The second best option is to consume the gas, making it less environmentally unfriendly. While consuming the gas, as much as possible of its energy should be utilised as electricity and heat. Preferably, electricity should be produced as much as possible, charging the batteries on the truck, decreasing the fuel consumption while running and increasing the lifespan of the batteries. The most efficient way of managing the heat generated is to distribute it to the coolant system on the truck, providing it to the engine and several other components. Distributing the energy is also a matter of safety, as very hot areas otherwise might cause risks of fire. The most simple concept, that is easiest to implement in the near future, is to use a burner similar to the auxiliary <b>diesel</b> <b>heaters</b> fitted to some trucks today. This consumes fuel, generating heat to the coolant system. An additional cooler is needed, to cool of excess heat from the system keeping the temperatures to a certain level. Using this system for an extensive period of time needs an external power supply, since no electricity is generated from consuming the gas. Other technologies {{that could be used in}} the future, also generating electricity, is thermoelectric generators and solid oxide fuel cells. These are technologies now being further developed and adapted to the industry of vehicles. These technologies are especially interesting when they are implemented to these trucks for use within other systems as well, for instance utilisation of the heat within exhaust gases. A small scale re-liquefaction unit mounted to the truck is however seen as the most resource efficient solution, making it possible to keep using the gas for it intended purpose of propelling the trucks forward. This technology has to be made more compact, adapting it to the use on a truck...|$|R

40|$|Recent DOE-OHVT {{studies show}} that diesel {{emissions}} and fuel consumption can be greatly reduced at truck stops by switching from engine idle to auxiliary-fired heaters. Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) has studied high performance diesel burner designs that address the shortcomings of current low fire-rate burners. Initial test results suggest a real opportunity {{for the development of}} a truly advanced truck heating system. The BNL approach is to use a low pressure, air-atomized burner derived form burner designs used commonly in gas turbine combustors. This paper reviews the design and test results of the BNL <b>diesel</b> fueled cabin <b>heater.</b> The burner design is covered by U. S. Patent 6, 102, 687 and was issued to U. S. DOE on August 15, 2000. The development of several novel oil burner applications based on low-pressure air atomization is described. The atomizer used is a pre-filming, air blast nozzle of the type commonly used in gas turbine combustion. The air pressure used can b e as low as 1300 Pa and such pressure can be easily achieved with a fan. Advantages over conventional, pressure-atomized nozzles include ability to operate at low input rates without very small passages and much lower fuel pressure requirements. At very low firing rates the small passage sizes in pressure swirl nozzles lead to poor reliability and this factor has practically constrained these burners to firing rates over 14 kW. Air atomization can be used very effectively at low firing rates to overcome this concern. However, many air atomizer designs require pressures that can be achieved only with a compressor, greatly complicating the burner package and increasing cost. The work described in this paper has been aimed at the practical adaptation of low-pressure air atomization to low input oil burners. The objective of this work is the development of burners that can achieve the benefits of air atomization with air pressures practically achievable with a simple burner fan...|$|R
40|$|A {{study of}} the {{environmental}} control practices and problems for greenhouses in Saudi Arabia was conducted. The data were collected in Riyadh, Qaseem and Eastern regions {{during the period of}} September 2003 to May 2004. The study was carried out on greenhouses covering approximately an area of 443 ha. Theo¬retical analysis were made to evaluate the performance of ventilation and cooling system for common greenhouses designs. The results showed that most of surveyed greenhouses were Quonset-style structure with lengths ranging from 30 m to 56 m, and a width of 9 m. Gutter-connected structures is the second popular houses design, which can be either ridge-and- furrow or arch-roof with lengths ranging from 110 m to 150 m, and widths ranging from 35 m to 40 m. All gutter-connected greenhouses were evaporatively cooled by fan and pad system, while Quonset-style houses were either naturally or mechanically ventilated. Galvanized metal were commonly used to build frame of greenhouses. Three types of covering materials were used including polyethylene, glass and fiberglass. The result indicated that most of greenhouses in Riyadh region were evaporatively cooled during summer period by fan and pad system, whereas most greenhouses in Qaseem and Eastern regions were naturally ventilated. Ventilation rates for each fan were between 40000 and 44000 m 3 /hr. Fans were either manually or automatically operated. Fans operation were based on air temperature inside greenhouses. It was found that in some farms, fans were switched off during night to save electrical energy consumption. The average distance between cooling pads and fans was 39. 5 m. The results showed that there were three types of pad materials; they are cross-fluted cellulose pads, excel¬sior (wood fiber), plastic pads and palm dates fiber pads. During periods of high solar radiation, greenhouse shading was commonly used. Several shading systems are used by many greenhouse growers including: white shading mix¬ture sprayed on the exterior greenhouse covering and variable shading (internal or external) using different materials such as plastic nets rated at 20 % to 80 % shading. Another approach for reducing greenhouses overheating during summer was to spray water droplets in greenhouses by low- or high-pressure systems. Summer air exchange rates were ranged from 1. 21 to 1. 84 air changes per minute (ACM), which was higher than the recommended rate of 0. 75 to 1. 0 ACM. Greenhouses in Qaseem have the lowest predicted inside air temperature, while greenhouses in Dhah¬ran have the highest predicted inside air temperature. Greenhouses in Dhahran have the highest predicted inside relative humidity, while the lowest values were predicted in Riyadh. Predicted temperatures and relative humid¬ities inside the greenhouses were in the permissible ranges for good production practice of greenhouse crops. Shade was predicted to reduce air temperature, and to increase relative humidity inside the greenhouses. Results showed that naturally ventilated greenhouses were Quonset structure with lengths ranging from 30 m to 56 rn, and width of 9 m. The common method for natural ventilation was done by opening doors and roof vents between poly¬ethylene cover. The results indicated that 61 %, 31 % and 26 % of greenhouses in Riyadh, Qaseem and Eastern regions, respectively, were heated during winter. Heating system were of two types; <b>Diesel</b> burning <b>heaters</b> and water heating pipes. Some major obstacles of greenhouses environment control were salt precipitation and dust accumulation in the cooling pad, non-uniform temperature in the greenhouse, low efficiency of cooling and heating systems, and high costs of covering materials. Some recommendations to improve the performance of the environmental con¬trol systems for greenhouses were presented...|$|R
