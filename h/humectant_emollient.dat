40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{investigate}} the potential of Glucam® P- 20 as a skin penetration enhancer for diclofenac sodium microemulsions across excised newborn pig skin. Glucam® P- 20 (GP- 20) or PPG- 20 -methyl glucose ether is generally used as a <b>humectant,</b> <b>emollient</b> and fragrance fixative. The w/o microemulsions composed of Tween 80, Eutanol G and water were formulated. The concentration of diclofenac sodium was 1 % w/w while the amounts of GP- 20 were varied from 0 - 20 % w/w, ME- 1 (0 %), ME- 2 (5 %), ME- 3 (10 %) and ME- 4 (20 %). All microemulsions were transparent with Newtonian flow behaviour. The mean droplet sizes of the microemulsions were about 200 nm. The FTIR spectra of the microemulsions containing GP- 20 were not markedly {{different from those of the}} microemulsion without GP- 20, ME- 1. The in vitro release and skin permeation studies of diclofenac sodium loaded microemulsions were investigated using modified Franz diffusion cell. For the in vitro release across synthetic membrane, the rank order of the release rate was ME- 4 > ME- 3 > ME- 2 > ME- 1. For the in vitro skin permeation experiments, GP- 20 at 10 % and 20 % could markedly enhance the percutaneous absorption of the drug. The optimum concentration of GP- 20 was 10 %. GP- 20 is proposed as a potential skin penetration enhancer for percutaneous absorption of diclofenac sodium...|$|E
5000|$|Moisturizers or emollients (...) {{are complex}} {{mixtures}} of chemical agents specially {{designed to make}} the external layers of the skin (epidermis) softer and more pliable. They increase the skin's hydration (water content) by reducing evaporation. Naturally occurring skin lipids and sterols, as well as artificial or natural oils, <b>humectants,</b> <b>emollients,</b> lubricants, etc., {{may be part of}} the composition of commercial skin moisturizers. They usually are available as commercial products for cosmetic and therapeutic uses, but can also be made at home using common pharmacy ingredients.|$|R
50|$|Stratum corneum lipids are elaborately {{organized}} into lamellar structure, which plays {{the most important}} role for skin's barrier functions. Unlike the conventional moisturizers made with <b>humectants</b> or <b>emollients,</b> MLE can restore and improve the barrier function of skin, with its distinctive structural similarity to the native human skin's lamellar structure. Restoring the skin barrier function can improve skin hydration and protect skin from external irritants.|$|R
50|$|Substances often labeled as {{bath salts}} include {{magnesium}} sulfate (Epsom salts), sodium chloride (table salt), sodium bicarbonate (baking soda), sodium hexametaphosphate (Calgon, amorphous/glassy sodium metaphosphate), sodium sesquicarbonate, borax, and sodium citrate. Glycerin, or liquid glycerin, is another common ingredient in bath salts. Its health and beauty benefits {{allow it to}} be classified as an <b>emollient,</b> <b>humectant</b> or lubricant when used in bath salts products.|$|R
40|$|Rough skin or xerosis, {{known by}} the laity as dry skin, results from a defect in the stratum corneum {{desquamation}} which normally remains imperceptible. This condition is negatively influenced by winter climatic conditions. Atopic dermatitis and trophic changes related to post-menopause, ageing, diabetes mellitus, {{as well as other}} endrocrine and metabolic disturbances are also involved in this process. Xerosis can be improved at various degrees by <b>emollients,</b> <b>humectants,</b> hydrating agents and squamolytic agents. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Background : Skin {{moisture}} {{responds to}} environmental changes, skin conditions, age, or disease. In {{addition to the}} exogenous and endogenous risk factors, deficiency of natural moisture regulator substance or Natural Moisturizing Factor (NMF) and lipids contribute to the reduction of skin moisture. Moisturizers are used to retain skin moisture because they contain <b>humectants,</b> occlusive and <b>emollient.</b> However, if used {{in the long term}} synthetic ingredients in moisturizers can cause side effects that need to be replaced with natural ingredients such as 5...|$|R
50|$|Bath salts are water-soluble, {{pulverised}} minerals {{that are}} added to water {{to be used for}} bathing. They are said to improve cleaning, enhance the enjoyment of bathing, and serve as a vehicle for cosmetic agents. Bath salts have been developed which mimic the properties of natural mineral baths or hot springs. Some bath salts contain glycerine so the product will act as an <b>emollient,</b> <b>humectant</b> or lubricant. Fragrances and colors are often added to bath salts; the fragrances are used to increase users' enjoyment of the bathing experience.|$|R
40|$|The correct {{choice of}} {{cosmetic}} products and cleansers {{is very important}} to improve skin hydration, to provide moisturizing benefits and to minimize cutaneous damage caused by surfactants. In fact, surfactants may damage protein structures and solubilize lipids. Soaps, defined as the alkali salts of fatty acids, are the oldest surfactants and are quite aggressive. Syndets (synthetic detergents) vary in composition and surfactant types (anionic, cationic, amphotheric, non-ionic). These new skin cleansing products also contain preservatives, fragrances, and sometimes <b>emollients,</b> <b>humectants</b> and skin nutrients. We present a revision of the literature and discuss recent findings regarding skin cleansers...|$|R
5000|$|Some soapmakers prefer [...] "melt and pour" [...] {{because the}} process is simple and safe, {{allowing}} the soapmaker to concentrate more on the aesthetic aspects of soap making. Because it avoids the need to handle lye, a hazardous and very caustic chemical, it is a hobby even children can enjoy under adult supervision. Unlike cold-processed soap, which requires a period of [...] "curing" [...] to allow saponification to complete and excess water to evaporate, the [...] "melt and pour" [...] process is completed once the base has cooled and hardened. The meltable base is usually naturally rich in glycerine, a by-product of saponification which has <b>humectant</b> and <b>emollient</b> properties, whereas commercial soap bars have often had this component removed. As with the rebatching method, it {{can be considered a}} misnomer to refer to the melt and pour process as soap making. The process has much in common with candle making using meltable wax which, using a similar process, can be scented, dyed and shaped on a small or large scale of production. Adding value to a melt and pour soap base involves augmentation by colouring, scenting, shaping and wrapping the bars, but the general characteristics of the soap, such as transparency or opacity, lathering, pH, fat content and hardness, will be implicitly those of the manufactured base. Melt and pour does not give the soaper complete control over the ingredients; for example, over the choice of fat to use. Conventional cold process or hot process soaps do not melt readily once they have saponified; the exceptions are clear glycerin soaps, and white soap made from white coconut oil. Melt and pour bases are typically manufactured from these types of soap.|$|R
40|$|It is {{difficult}} for rosacea patients to discern which products and ingredients will be beneficial to their skin and which products will lead to an exacerbation of the {{signs and symptoms of}} rosacea. In this paper, the authors provide a brief overview of rosacea, its pathogenesis, signs and symptoms, and the management of the two major rosacea subtypes—erythematotelangiectatic rosacea and papular pustular rosacea. Reviewed in greater detail are the common ingredients used in over-the-counter cleansers and moisturizers with discussion of how these ingredients potentially benefit or harm the skin of patients with rosacea. Clinical studies investigating the benefits of using certain over-the-counter cleansers and moisturizers in patients with erythematotelangiectatic rosacea and papular pustular rosacea with or without topical prescription therapy are also reviewed. The specific formulas used in the clinical studies include a sensitive skin synthetic detergent bar, a nonalkaline cleanser and moisturizer, polyhydroxy acid containing cleanser and moisturizer, and a ceramide-based cleanser and moisturizer formulated in a multivesicular emulsion. Based on review of available data, the authors conclude that the use of mild over-the-counter cleansers and moisturizers is beneficial for patients with erythematotelangiectatic rosacea and papular pustular rosacea. The properties of over-the-counter cleansers and moisturizers that contribute to their mildness include an acidic-neutral pH to minimize the flux in skin pH; surfactants or emulsifiers that will not strip the skin of its moisture or strip the lipids and proteins of the stratum corneum; moisturizing ingredients such as <b>emollients,</b> <b>humectants,</b> and occlusives; and formulas without potential irritants and allergens. The most consistent clinical benefits demonstrated in the reviewed studies were a subjectively perceived improvement in subjective symptoms of dryness and irritation as well as an objective improvement in dryness...|$|R
