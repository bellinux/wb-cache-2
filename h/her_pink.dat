5|$|Liukin is {{fluent in}} English and Russian. She {{graduated}} from Spring Creek Academy, located in Plano, Texas, {{in the spring}} of 2007. She enrolled as a freshman international business major at Southern Methodist University in January 2008, and took a leave from classes to concentrate on preparations for the 2008 Olympic Games. She returned to campus in spring 2009, but her travel schedule and professional commitments caused her to withdraw {{before the end of the}} semester. She stated that she hoped to continue her studies at New York University in the future. Liukin's signature color is pink, hence <b>her</b> <b>pink</b> leotard worn during the 2008 Beijing Olympics all-around competition.|$|E
5|$|Confronting Joyce {{about the}} story, Lois {{questions}} her intentions, with Joyce revealing {{that the two}} attended high school together, where she was known as Joyce Chevapravatdumrong. She also reveals that Lois humiliated {{her in front of}} the entire school, by placing a hotdog in her mouth and pulling down her pants while blindfolded (revealing <b>her</b> <b>pink</b> underwear), and has sought revenge ever since. At church the next day, Lois and her family enter, and are immediately demanded to leave by the preacher. Becoming extremely depressed, Lois is eventually coaxed by Brian to face her mistake by showing it to the church. The porno causes the church to reaccept her and admit the Griffin family back into their congregation due to a positive opinion of the film, much to Joyce's anger. Stewie in the meantime develops suspicions of having been conceived through the creation of the porno, heightened when he sees that one of the actors has a football-shaped head like his.|$|E

25|$|Dragana Mirković {{remains the}} biggest turbo-folk {{star in the}} country, with her {{numerous}} hits (Sama, Plači zemljo, Pitaju me u mom kraju, Poslednje veče, Ne vraćam se starim ljubavima, Nisam ni metar od tebe). With <b>her</b> <b>pink</b> hair and very recognizable screen persona, Zorica Brunclik (Kada bi me pitali, Košava, Otkopčano jeleče, Ja znam, A tebe nema) could be considered Dragana's follow-up. Vesna Zmijanac, the previous wife of Zorica's husband, has preserved the fame she had in 80s with hit-songs like Jorgovani, Ja imam nekog a ti si sam, Malo po malo, Kunem ti se životom, Idem preko zemlje Srbije. Among the others, there are Halid Bešlić (Miljacka, Prvi poljubac, Put me zove), Ana Bekuta (Oluja, Imam jedan život, Kralj ponoći, Zlatiborske zore), Sinan Sakić (Ej, otkad sam se rodio, Delija momak, Prvi poljubac), Stojanka Novaković Stoja (Moje srce ostariti ne sme, Žena starija, Samo) and Nedeljko Bajić Baja (Ginem, ginem, Mini suknja, Zapisano u vremenu). The absolute record in sales {{of this kind of}} music is still held by Lepa Brena, who has sold around 40 million records and held concerts all over the Balkans. Next to that, due to her enormous popularity, Brena is considered the symbol of former Yugoslavia, of Yugoslav unity and power, and after the break of federation, of so-called Yugo-nostalgia.|$|E
60|$|At {{this moment}} in came Bruno. Working hard in the heat had not {{improved}} his temper, {{and when he saw}} that Felicia had succeeded in finding <b>her</b> <b>pinks</b> he was so angry that he dragged her out into the garden and shut the door upon her. The fresh air soon made her open her pretty eyes, and there before her stood the Queen of the Woods, looking as charming as ever.|$|R

500|$|Jada Pinkett Smith {{is one of}} Minaj's {{role models}} in her acting career. Minaj was {{inspired}} by R singer Monica, singing [...] "Why I Love You So Much" [...] at every talent show she entered.

500|$|The stage show {{included}} new choreography, {{as well as}} Victoria Halkiti and Nektarios Georgiadis as backing vocalists. Kalomoira {{started off}} the show sitting on a diamond sequenced bench held up by her dancers. She then got down and started a dance routine with complex choreography. There was also a large purple book on stage that opened up as a heart shaped pop-up book that Kalomoira stepped out of when she sang the lyrics [...] "an open book". In time with the book opening, Kalomoira removed <b>her</b> <b>pink</b> dress revealing a pink and silver mini-dress underneath. Toward {{the middle of the}} song during the break, the cameras cut to Kalomoira who was doing a provocative dance; shaking her whole body. At the end of the song, she was slightly lifted up by her dancers. The background image on stage was a skyline of buildings that moved with glowing lights. She wore clothes exclusively by JLO and managed to finish in first place out of nineteen countries, receiving 156 points.|$|E

500|$|The character's {{personality}} {{has been}} described as annoying. Thomas East of Official Nintendo Magazine called her his third-least-favorite Sonic character, saying she [...] "really isn't an interesting character" [...] and is [...] "annoying". Ranking Amy third-lowest on a similar list, Jim Sterling of GamesRadar simply wrote: [...] "Total bitch" [...] (in contrast to several paragraphs each for other characters on his list). On the same website, Justin Towell called her a [...] "whiny, annoying brat" [...] in Sonic Adventure. Patrick Farren of What Culture called her [...] "one of gaming's most irritating females", criticizing the way she [...] "contacts Sonic seemingly just to bag him." [...] Jem Roberts called Amy [...] "kind-hearted" [...] but [...] "intolerably whiny". The character's voice has been criticized since Cindy Robinson took over the role, with Rogers and Farren comparing it to Minnie Mouse's. Towell and Mean Machines expressed general displeasure at her introduction in Sonic CD. The developers' treatment of Amy as a female character and its implications for gender representation in video games have also been questioned; the Electronic Gaming Monthly staff found <b>her</b> <b>pink</b> coloring and tendency to run from danger to be stereotypical and common in Japanese-created female characters.|$|E
500|$|The {{video for}} [...] "Misery" [...] premiered on Stefani's Vevo account on May 31, 2016. On the same night, it was {{distributed}} to iTunes as a paid download in the United States. Outside North America, the video {{was available for}} preorder in several countries starting May 11, but was not officially released until May 31, 2016. A majority of critics praised the video for creating glamorous and fashionable surroundings. Bustles May Sofi ranked the nine outfits the singer wore during the video and listed <b>her</b> <b>pink</b> tulle frock at number one. The publication's consensus on their decision reads: [...] "This adorable pink frock is not only super wearable, it's also pretty on-trend. The pale pink tulle gives off a ballerina-chic vibe, {{and we all know}} how popular that style has been as of late." [...] The site listed the [...] "floral co-ords" [...] look in the bottom position, but still claimed that the outfit was [...] "probably the most costume-like of [...] all." [...] Seija Rankin of E! Online stated: [...] "Contrary to the song's title, this tune and the corresponding video is not actually miserable at all; it's quite upbeat." ...|$|E
2500|$|Trixie (played by Sarah Burgess/Aymee Garcia) is a mean {{girl who}} likes jokes, but are friends with someone [...] She {{tends to make}} sarcastic remarks about her friends.

Trixie {{represents}} impatience and a lack of respect for rules.|$|E

The campaign became a hit, and was soon followed by a print version for newspapers. Cheeka earned [...] 150,000 for the campaign, and still appears in Hutch ads, representing the network. Recently, she featured with <b>her</b> <b>pink</b> nose, when Hutch changed its signature color from orange to pink.|$|E
2500|$|MTV's John Mitchell {{criticized the}} video's {{postponed}} release, finding it strange that the video for the album's third single, [...] "Beez in the Trap", was released before that of [...] "Starships". On May 28, 2012, a [...] "Starships" [...] video campaign was announced on Minaj's official website. It asked fans {{to record a}} video of themselves performing [...] "Starships" [...] by singing, dancing or with a musical instrument. Minaj will then select 5 winners.

All that long afternoon and into {{the early morning hours of}} the next day, the widow objected to leaving her husband's body, except for the swearing in of Johnson.

2500|$|The New Yorker {{describes}} {{what it calls}} this [...] "strangely but tellingly misbegotten" [...] cover design thusly: [...] "The image is a photograph, taken from a French fashion shoot, of a glassy-eyed, heavily made-up little girl. Behind her sits, a mother figure, stiff and coiffed, casting an ominous shadow. The girl, with her long, perfectly waved platinum-blond hair and <b>her</b> <b>pink</b> feather boa, looks like a pretty and inert doll—" [...] The article continues: [...] "And if the Stepford daughter on the cover is meant {{to remind us of}} Veruca Salt or Violet Beauregarde, she doesn't: those badly behaved squirts are bubbling over with rude life." [...] Moreover, writes Talbot, [...] "The Modern Classics cover has not a whiff of this validation of childish imagination; instead, it seems to imply a deviant adult audience." ...|$|E
