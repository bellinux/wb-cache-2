500|$|In 1916, Coach Yost {{shared his}} {{recollections}} of the Buffalo game with Big Bill Edwards: [...] "Buffalo University came to Michigan with a much-heralded team. They were coached by a Dartmouth man {{and had not}} been scored upon. Buffalo papers referred to Michigan as the Woolly Westerners, and the Buffalo enthusiasts placed bets that Michigan would not score." [...] The score {{at the end of}} the first half was 65 to 0. About fifteen minutes after the second half had started, Yost discovered a Buffalo player, Simpson, [...] "on Michigan's side of the field, covered up in a blanket." [...] Yost was curious and asked, [...] "Simpson, what are you doing over here? You are on the wrong side." [...] To which, Simpson replied, [...] "Don't say anything. I know where I am at. The coach has put me in three times already and I'm not <b>going</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> again. Enough is enough for any one. I've had mine." ...|$|E
500|$|The song's {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Joseph Kahn. Kahn, who also directed the video for Brown and Ester Dean's [...] "Drop It Low", said that Brown played him tracks from his album on the set, and had {{a clear idea of}} what he wanted for the [...] "I Can Transform Ya" [...] video. Kahn said, [...] "...obviously, him <b>going</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> and dancing and turning into cars and trucks is right up my alley. His interests, in terms of kung fu and special effects and science fiction and all the boy-culture stuff, it falls directly in line with what I like. [...] "His talent is phenomenal. I'm still struggling to try and capture that talent on film, and it's a challenge. Here's a guy who can literally do anything. If you watch this thing, he's doing nunchuck tricks, and I'm a huge kung fu aficionado, and they're mind-blowing. I've never seen stuff like that before in kung fu flicks. I would say it's like a pure aesthetic dance video from the very fiber of it. Everything dances onscreen. Everything has movement. Everything has a certain mechanical rhythm. He actually created a dance style for this that is mechanical. It's sort of a hyper-intense version of the robot. Even the transformations go directly in line with the movements." ...|$|E
2500|$|Riegel found {{humor in}} the {{situation}} and said, [...] "Unfortunately, we only got the script like three days ahead of time! But hey! We're old pros." [...] When asked if they were intimidated by {{the challenge of the}} reveal scenes, Riegel asserted that she [...] "wasn't scared at all," [...] and clarified that it [...] "was a good challenge" [...] and [...] "one of those things where it's like, 'This is what I do. This is what I love.'" [...] She said, [...] "To have all that material and to be there in the moment ... I didn't want to be in any other place." [...] She found it exciting. Having waited for the moment [...] "for a long time," [...] {{it turned out to be}} [...] "a big pay-off." [...] She added: But I was a little nervous because this was definitely a very, very special episode. That was the biggest challenge to me; I was <b>going</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> knowing, 'This is the moment.' I kept having to make myself laugh and leave set and play with my friends in the hair and makeup room and just sort of try to view the day as though it was just an average taping day because the last thing those scenes needed from my character's perspective was that sense of gravity, that feeling of, 'This is so important.' Because it was not a big deal for my character — she had no idea what was coming.|$|E

6000|$|... "It is I, Murphy," [...] {{came in the}} husky {{tones of}} big Jim, the monitor. [...] "If {{anything}} is <b>going</b> on <b>in</b> <b>there,</b> I want to warn you that Mr. Haskers is coming up--I heard him tell an under teacher." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "By jimminy, it's int'resting! I'd {{like to get}} a look at him. Say--the {{next time}} you're <b>going</b> <b>in</b> <b>there,</b> don't you reckon you could spread the door and--" ...|$|E

30|$|Thus, Banach {{spaces and}} fuzzy Banach spaces are {{strongly}} related to each other; see for instance [27]. Without <b>going</b> <b>in</b> details, <b>there</b> are examples of fuzzy Banach spaces which are not Banach spaces. Therefore, fuzzy Banach spaces cover {{a broad spectrum of}} categories than the corresponding Banach spaces. This is a sufficient motivation to develop an application in a fuzzy setting.|$|R

6000|$|... "He wasn't here {{a minute}} in all," [...] said she; [...] "and {{he said nothing}} about paying for what he took--and, when I saw him <b>going</b> <b>in</b> <b>there,</b> I thought it best to let him have his own way." ...|$|E

6000|$|Kipps had his {{way about}} a study. [...] "When I get that study," [...] said Kipps, [...] "I shall do {{a bit of}} reading I've long wanted to do. I shall make a habit of <b>going</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> and reading {{something}} an hour every day. There's Shakespeare {{and a lot of}} things a man like me ought to read. Besides, we got to 'ave somewhere to put the Encyclopædia. I've always thought a study was about what I've wanted all along. You can't 'elp reading if you got a study. If you 'aven't, there's nothing for it, so far's I can see, but treshy novels." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Now then, mum," [...] {{said the}} clerk, {{addressing}} the stout lady, [...] "are you <b>going</b> up <b>there</b> <b>in</b> the middle, {{or are you}} coming up here at the back?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, you are not, Bob. You are {{not coming}} in there, at present. When your uncle and I were talking--when we were fishing, you know--he {{said that he}} saw no use in your <b>going</b> <b>in</b> <b>there,</b> at present; and {{thought it would be}} quite time for you to learn how the books are kept, in another three or four years; and that, till then, you could go into the cellar. You will learn bottling, and packing, and blending, and {{something}} about the quality and value of wines. You will find it much more pleasant than being shut up in a counting house, making out bills and keeping ledgers." ...|$|E
6000|$|A spring trickles out of {{the rock}} in the gloomy {{recesses}} of the cavern, and we were thirsty. The citizens of Endor objected to our <b>going</b> <b>in</b> <b>there.</b> They do not mind dirt; they do not mind rags; they do not mind vermin; they do not mind barbarous ignorance and savagery; they do not mind a reasonable degree of starvation, but they do like to be pure and holy before their god, whoever he may be, and therefore they shudder and grow almost pale {{at the idea of}} Christian lips polluting a spring whose waters must descend into their sanctified gullets. We had no wanton desire to wound even their feelings or trample upon their prejudices, but we were out of water, thus early in the day, and were burning up with thirst. It was at this time, and under these circumstances, that I framed an aphorism which has already become celebrated. I said: [...] "Necessity knows no law." [...] We went in and drank.|$|E
6000|$|... "It was {{a dreadful}} year of illness that. I came, I remember, to one little kraal of Knobnoses, {{and went up}} to it to see if I could get some maas, or curdled butter-milk, and a few mealies. As I drew near I was struck with the silence of the place. No {{children}} began to chatter, and no dogs barked. Nor could I see any native sheep or cattle. The place, though it had evidently been recently inhabited, was as still as the bush round it, and some guinea fowl got up out of the prickly pear bushes right at the kraal gate. I remember that I hesitated a little before <b>going</b> <b>in,</b> <b>there</b> was such an air of desolation about the spot. Nature never looks desolate when man has not yet laid his hand upon her breast; she is only lonely. But when man has been, and has passed away, then she looks desolate.|$|E
2500|$|I {{was under}} no {{illusion}} {{that it was}} going to be [...] a financial catastrophe—to say the least—this year. That was not even remotely in my mind, that I was <b>going</b> to walk <b>in</b> <b>there</b> and make any money this year.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh yes, I'm <b>going</b> <b>in</b> for authority. <b>There's</b> {{more chance}} <b>in</b> English," [...] the girl {{added in the}} next breath. [...] "There are not so many others--the terrible competition. There are so many here--not that I'm afraid," [...] she chattered on. [...] "But we've got America and they haven't. America's a great place." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, Mr. Brown, don't now! She's {{not one of}} us. There's no saying what's <b>going</b> on <b>there</b> <b>in</b> her. Maybe she's praying; {{maybe she}} sees more than we do, over the sea there." ...|$|R
60|$|As the {{governor}} expected, the ship did not venture {{to follow the}} Abraham in. That particular passage, in fact, was utterly unknown to Waally, and those with him, {{and he could not}} give such an account of it as would encourage the admiral to stand on. Determined not to lose time unnecessarily, the latter hauled short off shore, and made sail in chase of the Anne and Martha, which, by this time, were about mid-channel, heading across to the Peak. It was not the wish of {{the governor}}, however, to lead the strangers any nearer to the cove than was necessary, and, no sooner did he see the Abraham well within the islands, her sails concealed by the trees, of which there was now a little forest on this part of the coast, and the ship drawing well off the land in hot pursuit of himself, than he kept away in the direction of Rancocus Island, bringing the wind on his larboard quarter. The strangers followed, and in half an hour they were all so far to leeward of Cape South, as to remove any apprehension of their <b>going</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> very soon.|$|E
60|$|Presently Miss Pilgrim, who had considerately left {{us for a}} {{few minutes}} to let us have our cry out, came back again, and took us up to show us our room, where we could take off our things. She also kindly sent for Clara Fairthorne, so that we might go down into the schoolroom with some one we knew. It was rather an ordeal <b>going</b> <b>in</b> <b>there,</b> and seeing all the faces lifted up from their work to look at the new comers. However, it was not so bad as we had expected; they did not stare at us disagreeably, nor did they, when we went out into the {{playground}} afterwards, ask us so many questions as papa had warned us they would. Indeed, there was no occasion for their doing so, as they had heard all about us from Clara. One or two of them took us under their special protection, as it were, for the first few days, and we felt at home very much sooner than I had expected that we should do. We were about twenty in all, from Annie Morgan and Selma Colman, the two parlour boarders, down to Julia Jackson, a West-Indian child of eleven years old, the darling and pet of the whole school.|$|E
6000|$|... "He has;--and I am thankful. But my back is {{not strong}} enough to bear the weight without bending under it. Did you see Ratler <b>going</b> <b>in?</b> <b>There</b> is a man I dread. He is {{intimate}} enough with me to congratulate me, but not friend enough to abstain, and he will be sure to say something about his murdered colleague. Very well;--I'll follow you. Go up rather quick, and I'll come close after you." [...] Whereupon Mr. Monk entered between the two lamp-posts in the hall, and, hurrying along the passages, soon found himself {{at the door of the}} House. Phineas, with an effort at composure, and a smile that was almost ghastly at the door-keeper, who greeted him with some muttered word of recognition, held on his way close behind his friend, and walked up the House hardly conscious that the benches on each side were empty. There were not a dozen members present, and the Speaker had not as yet taken the chair. Mr. Monk stood by him while he took the oath, and in two minutes he was on a back seat below the gangway, with his friend by him, while the members, in slowly increasing numbers, took their seats. Then there were prayers, and as yet not a single man had spoken to him. As soon as the doors were again open gentlemen streamed in, and some few whom Phineas knew well came and sat near him. One or two shook hands with him, but no one said a word to him of the trial. No one at least did so in this early stage of the day's proceedings; and after half an hour he almost ceased to be afraid.|$|E

There is fighting <b>going</b> on <b>in</b> <b>there</b> still. Do you, gentlemen, take our horses as we dismount, and ride off, and then open fire again on the rascals from a distance. We shall {{be able to hold}} the house if we can once enter." ...|$|R
