The outer areas were electrified to the 25kV AC 50 Hz standard, with the central area, the Springburn, Bridgeton and Milngavie branches and the Yoker line being at 6.25kV AC due to restricted clearances in tunnels. As insulation technology improved these lines were eventually converted to 25kV.|$|E

40|$|<b>Public</b> <b>services</b> are {{provided}} at various levels, and for various reasons, by governments to corporate and private citizens. Recently, an important movement in tort theory {{has sought to}} allow governments to recoup the cost of <b>public</b> <b>services</b> as tort damages from wrongdoers, especially from wrongdoers of the corporate variety. Much of the latest thrust in tort law, which consists of attorneys-general 2 ̆ 7 s suits against corporations, relies implicitly on {{a challenge to the}} common law 2 ̆ 7 s 2 ̆ 2 <b>free</b> <b>public</b> <b>services</b> doctrine. 2 ̆ 2 Recently, scholarship emanating largely from plaintiff-oriented sources has sought to appeal to free-market and law-and-economics scholars (who are often defense-oriented) by emphasizing the allocative and distributive efficiency of abolishing this common law doctrine. This article rebuts this new scholarship and defends the common law rule against both efficiency arguments and non-efficiency arguments. The article establishes that the <b>free</b> <b>public</b> <b>services</b> doctrine is fundamental both to the nature of private law and to the essence of tort, and concludes that only public law, not common law 2 ̆ 2 evolution 2 ̆ 2, should be allowed to alter the doctrine.
