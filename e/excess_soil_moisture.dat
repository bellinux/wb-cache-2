[...] Studies in soil salinity tolerance have grown in interest due to changing environments and agricultural maintenance. In an experiment performed to assess the growth of slender wheatgrass and stressful salt levels, the results were “superior”. This cultivar can be established in a high-saline habitat over other grass cultivars. “Salt-tolerant, perennial forage crops capable of establishing on saline soils will provide protection against erosion, compete with weeds, utilize <b>excess</b> <b>soil</b> <b>moisture,</b> and in some situations provide forage for animals.” Along with saline-stress tolerance, slender wheatgrass can also successfully grow in shallow or deep soils and in areas that aren’t limited by drift. They can inhabit an area and produce a stable living situation quickly. Generally this cultivar will persist between 5 and 10 years and produce a substantial seed count.|$|E

The methodologies developed for these simulations should represent the key physical processes, and be applicable in a wide variety of climates for routine simulations using readily available field information. This paper describes the development of a Soil and Landuse based rainfall-runoff and recharge Model (SLiM) based on Rushton’s method – a single soil layer groundwater recharge model, which was itself an improvement of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) method. SLiM contains the concepts of the <b>excess</b> water of <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> deficit (the amount of water added to the soil system when soil becomes free draining) and the bypass runoff (a part of rainfall becomes overland runoff directly without infiltrating into soil when rainfall intensity is high enough).

Therefore, nitrous oxide emissions from a runoff-irrigated and rainfed endosodi-calcaric Fluvisol in the semiarid northwest of Kenya were measured using the closed chamber method. Corresponding soil moisture and nitrate contents were determined. Nitrous oxide emissions were highly correlated with soil moisture (r ˆ 0. 73, p < 0. 001). The wetting of dry soil by precipitation or irrigation resulted in high emission rates of up to 0. 3 g N 2 O±N ha � 1 h � 1. Due to <b>excess</b> <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> these rates were lower on the runoff-irrigated plots than on the rainfed ones, but decreased at an lower rate with time.

The ranges of possible hydrographs were delineated by extreme scenarios where <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> was directly and inversely modelled according to the topographic wetness index (TWI).

30|$|Annual {{precipitation}} in {{the year}} of death [AP(0)] is a significant predictor of taiwania mortality in the study plots. The positive coefficient for variable AP(0) signifies that mortality increases as precipitation increases. This, along with the annual precipitation data (Fig.  1), eliminates drought as a cause of mortality. <b>Excess</b> <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> can reduce the amount of oxygen in the soil and can lead to tree death (Kozlowski 1984). This is unlikely to be the cause of tree mortality in these stands because the high amounts of precipitation are usually the result of a few days rain from typhoons and most of this moisture becomes runoff on these steep slopes. Some stress on the trees may have resulted from nutrient leaching. High levels of precipitation due to typhoons at a research site in northern Taiwan resulted in the leaching of nutrients from the soil (Lin et al. 2011), but the loss of nutrients due to leaching only lasted for a short time and slow decomposition rates of leaf litter at the site allows trees to take up most of the mineralised nutrients before they are leached away. The most likely explanation for the increase in mortality with an increase in growing-season precipitation is that storms (especially typhoons) lead to high precipitation and also high winds that result in wind throw. The year in which the second highest mortality occurred was 1990, which was also the year with the highest amount of precipitation in which mortality was analysed (Fig.  1). The cause of tree mortality was not recorded so {{it is not possible to}} test the hypothesis that soil moisture or wind throw cause mortality rather than precipitation, but future observations on these and other plots could verify or refute these propositions.|$|E
40|$|AbstractA key {{strategy}} for {{climate change adaptation}} in the rain-fed northern Corn Belt is to decrease cropping system vulnerability to changes in precipitation patterns by building resilience. Using 50 - year of county level yield and environmental data from Iowa and Ontario, we first demonstrate that sensitivity of corn yield to precipitation, particularly in July and August, has increased {{over the past five}} decades despite no changes in precipitation patterns. This can be attributed to steady improvement in corn yield potential and so plant water demand since the mid- 20 th century and removal of non-water constraints to crop production. Such vulnerability of corn-based cropping systems to water limitations is of increasing concern as climate change models predict higher summer temperatures and year-to-year variations in precipitations in this region. As suggested in the ecology literature, increasing agroecosystem temporal and spacial diversity {{is one of the key}} management strategies to deal with impending weather variability. Using yield and environmental data from a 30 -year long-term rotation and tillage trial in Ontario, we show that diversification of short corn-based rotations using small grains and forage crops increases corn yield stability and resilience to both limiting and <b>excess</b> <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> 1. We also demonstrate the importance of conservation tillage and measured the impact of rotation and tillage history on plants ability to access water resources, plant available soil water and their combined effects on timing of physiological water stress and grain yield when drought occurs at reproductive stages. Our results emphasize the growing importance of developing strategies for managing soil moisture in rain-fed regions and the significance of agroecological approaches to develop hardy agricultural systems and protect food and feed production against the upcoming extreme weather events...|$|E

The SMOS-based root zone <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> had a mean R 2 of 0. 57 and a mean Nash–Sutcliffe score of 0. 61 based on 33 stations in Oklahoma. In Nebraska, the SMOS-based root zone <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> had a mean R 2 of 0. 24 and a mean Nash–Sutcliffe score of 0. 22 based on 22 stations. Although the performance of the exponential filter method varies over space and time, we conclude that it is a useful approach for estimating root zone <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> from SMOS surface retrievals...|$|R
40|$|A {{panel of}} soil, climate and land {{evaluation}} experts reviewed {{a set of}} land evaluation methods in order to elaborate an approach which can support the identification of natural constraints to agriculture in the EU 27. The driver for this exercise is Article 50. 3 of ECRegulation 1698 / 2005 calling for the revision of the existing system based on criteria related to low soil productivity and poor climate conditions for agriculture and the consequent Communication from the Commission: "Towards a better targeting of the aid to farmers in areas with natural handicaps" of 21 Apr. 2011. The FAO’s agricultural problem land approach was selected and adjusted {{to come forward with}} the policy requirement. The FAO approach was deemed appropriate because it is not crop-specific and for its simple assumptions regarding the mutual interaction of land characteristics on the overall suitability of the land, making it applicable for a territory as large and diverse as the EU 27. Two climatic and four soil criteria were retained and complemented by one integrated soil-climate criterion (<b>Excess</b> <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> – Field Capacity duration), with slope as the sole topographic criterion. For each criterion a critical limit was defined dividing the criterion range into two categories: not limiting and severely limiting for agriculture. The criteria and the associated critical limits or threshold values have been tested by Member States of the European Union. Feedbacks and suggestions from Member States simulations have been taken into account to update the initial list of bio-physical criteria so that the applicability is ensured in EU 27. Therefore, they can be used in Member States to discriminate land with biophysical constraints to agricultural production on the basis that soil and climate data have sufficient spatial and semantic details. This document provides the scientific and agronomic rationale for bio-physical criteria identifying natural constraints (soil and climate) to agriculture in EU 27. JRC.

40|$|Three {{experiments}} are described {{that were designed}} to evaluate the relationship between soil moisture and perennial ryegrass growth and leaf extension rate (LER) in loam or silt clay loam soil. When soil moisture was maintained at a range of proportions (0. 5, 0. 75, 1. 0, 1. 25) of field capacity (FC) in a pot experiment in a glasshouse, 0. 75 FC had consistently higher growth and LER than 0. 5 FC and, to a lesser extent, 1. 25 FC. The quadratic relationship between herbage growth and amount of water applied to maintain target field capacity, was stronger than for that between LER {{and the amount of}} water applied, with a maximum response at an application of about 2. 5 L/m 2 per day. In a microsward (soil depth of 30 cm in boxes 56 cm × 72 cm) trial inducing drought by withholding water for a range of durations resulted in a progressive decline in LER. When soil moisture content fell to about 0. 4 of that of the consistently watered control LER was less than 0. 1 of the control. However within one week of receiving water, even in the relatively severe drought treatment, LER was not significantly lower than the control treatment. LER was quadratically related to soil moisture content when soil was drying or after rewatering. In a further experiment on the microswards, reducing soil moisture content to about 0. 18 g/g by limiting water in May-June resulted in a severe reduction in LER and growth rate and a decline in tillering rate. However, after application of the equivalent of 3 mm precipitation per day in late June, while soil moisture content remained relatively low (about 0. 2 to 0. 25 g/g soil), LER and herbage growth increased rapidly to as high as in consistently watered microswards. In a treatment in which soil moisture content eventually exceeded FC, LER and herbage growth declined with increase in excess above FC, concurring with findings in the steady state soil moisture experiment. Implications of the data for prediction of production from sown grass swards using temperate maritime grass-growth models are that: (1) during drought, when rainfall resumes, regrowth will be influenced more by amount of rainfallthan soil moisture content and (2) <b>excess</b> <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> should be taken into account, including effects of reduced nutrient uptake and post-anoxia stress. peer-reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2017 The {{perception}} of a long-term cost advantage of synthetic infill turf systems relative to natural grass systems has contributed to a rise in their popularity in the USA. However, few comprehensive cost assessments of natural grass and synthetic infill systems exist. There are also no studies looking at interactions between surface quality, maintenance practices, and real foot traffic on athletic surfaces. Currently, simulated traffic is {{the most commonly used}} method for assessing wear tolerance on athletic playing surfaces. This series of case studies took five natural grass and five synthetic infill fields in the Willamette Valley, OR, and gathered information on their maintenance practices, costs of installation and maintenance, surface quality data, and player use hours from field managers, athletic directors, coaches, online schedules, and player rosters. This information was used to perform a life cycle analysis and find the maintenance cost of providing an hour of player use for both field types. A simple linear regression analysis was also performed exploring the relationships of maintenance practices and real player traffic with percent green cover and surface hardness on natural grass surfaces, and infill depth and surface hardness on synthetic infill surfaces. Findings from this work determined that the average cost of installing a synthetic field was 162. 66 m² and the average annual equivalent was 20. 10 m². The average cost of installing a natural grass field was 45. 61 m² and the average annual equivalent was 10. 11 m². It was found that the average cost of providing an hour of use to a single person was 3. 48 for the natural grass fields averaged and 3. 25 for the synthetic fields. This series of case studies suggests that mean percent green cover showed little variation across the month of July and no variation in the month of November on natural grass fields. The only statistical difference was likely associated with the lack of summer irrigation on one of the fields in the month of July. This was likely due to good growing conditions under irrigation in the summer and <b>excess</b> <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> in the rainy season. Reducing mean surface softness on natural grass fields was attributed to increased cultivation events leading to firmer fields while higher mowing heights were associated with increased surface softness in July and November. With synthetic infill fields there was a correlation between surface softness and infill depth. The maintenance practices of brooming and grooming, followed by debris removal, and crumb rubber replacement were associated with improving surface softness and increasing infill depth...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: <b>Soil</b> <b>moisture</b> is {{critical}} parameters in climatic and hydrological modeling and vegetation growth. Ground-based point measurement of <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> is liable but expensive and impractical for watershed measurement. Remote sensing measurement has provided thriving perspective for spatial and instantaneous measurement of <b>soil</b> <b>moisture.</b> Microwave measurement is effective and successful for surface <b>soil</b> <b>moisture,</b> but {{influenced by the}} vegetation and land roughness, and can’t detect the root zone or below-root zone <b>soil</b> <b>moisture.</b> Vegetation growth is heavily dependent on the water availability in arid and semi-arid areas, and the vegetation index from satellites may respond to the change of <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> and reflect the <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> to some degree. This study analyzed the profile <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> characteristics in three different climate and vegetation sites from Feb 2000 through Apr 2004, compared the collocated and coincided <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> and MODIS NDVI, and estimated the <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> using NDVI by least square regression model. Results showed that the root and below-root zone <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> in semi-arid climate has strong correlation with simultaneous NDVI and can be estimated using NDVI during growing season; the root zone <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> in humid climate also has moderate correlation with simultaneous NDVI during growing season; below-root <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> in humid climate has weak correlation with NDVI and can’t be effectively estimated using NDVI; <b>Soil</b> <b>moisture</b> has weak correlation with NDVI and can’t be effectively estimated using NDVI during non-growing season (Oct-March) ...|$|R
