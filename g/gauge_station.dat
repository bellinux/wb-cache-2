40|$|Various {{parameters}} {{needed for}} {{quantitative assessment of}} ground water resources and the methods of acquiring these parameters were considered in this study.

Precipitation <b>gauging</b> <b>stations,</b> streamflow <b>gauging</b> <b>stations,</b> evaporation <b>gauging</b> <b>stations,</b> and observation well networks are designed for Aleydegi Plain, Ethiopia, as a test for the design. The design requires establishment of five precipitation <b>gauging</b> <b>stations,</b> 15 streamflow <b>gauging</b> <b>stations,</b> two evaporation <b>gauging</b> <b>stations,</b> and more than 100 observation wells.

40|$|Abstract—Reservoir {{operation}} involves many critical decisions due to unpredicted circumstances, such as drought or flood. The reservoir {{water release}} decision {{is one of}} the challenging tasks for the reservoir operator since the decision to deal with many complicated decision variables and multipurpose operation. Typically, the water that flow into the reservoir comes from the upstream river network. The <b>gauging</b> <b>stations</b> are located at different locations and the distance between the <b>gauging</b> <b>stations</b> and the reservoir are varied. This information indicates that there are spatial relationships between <b>gauging</b> <b>stations</b> and reservoir. This paper aims to investigate the spatial relationship between the upstream <b>gauging</b> <b>stations</b> and the reservoir by mapping temporal rainfall information on each <b>gauging</b> <b>station</b> with the reservoir water level. The mapping was established using Backpropagation Neural Network. The findings show that different location and distance of each <b>gauging</b> <b>station</b> with the Timah Tasoh reservoir does affect the water travel time from <b>gauging</b> <b>stations</b> to the reservoir.

The benchmark was subsequently retained by Austria, adopted by Yugoslavia, and retained by the states that emerged after its dissolution. In 2016, Slovenia adopted a new elevation benchmark referring to the upgraded tide <b>gauge</b> <b>station</b> in the coastal town of Koper.|$|E

40|$|The diploma {{thesis on}} "A Proposal to Optimize the Distribution Network of Water Level <b>Gauging</b> <b>Stations</b> in South Bohemian Region? {{deals with the}} {{distribution}} network of <b>gauging</b> <b>stations</b> of a category ?A?, ?B? and ?C? in the catchment area in South Bohemia. The thesis has been designed as {{an overview of the}} current situation of the <b>gauging</b> <b>stations</b> in South Bohemian Region; it is focused on the distribution network of these stations not only in the areas hit with floods. It examines whether these critical places across which the stations have been distributed since 2002 correspond to the requirements of the current flood protection, whether it would not be advisable either to increase or, on contrary, {{to reduce the number of}} stations in the exposed river areas. The data processed by Povodí Vltavy, Horní Vltava s. p. Plant, and documents by the ČHMÚ were used for the purposes of this examination. The result of the thesis is the fact that the number of the distributed <b>gauging</b> <b>stations</b> is sufficient as for the needs of flood protection, which has been found out by means of structured interviews with the respective experts. Position of these stations has been incorporated in the flood prevention plans and most of these plans have been designed just on the basis of the distribution network of the <b>gauging</b> <b>stations.</b> The critical locations have been sufficiently mapped and recorded and the flood forecasting and warning service uses the gained, very precious information from these <b>gauging</b> <b>stations.</b> The goal of the thesis was to assess the current distribution network of the <b>gauging</b> <b>stations</b> on the rivers in South Bohemian Region. The current distribution network of the <b>gauging</b> <b>stations</b> on the rivers in South Bohemian Region was studied on the basis of an analysis of the ascertained data and documents. The first goal of the examination was the issue whether the current distribution network and the number of the <b>gauging</b> <b>stations</b> correspond to the needs of protection of citizens, cultural heritage, and property, and whether it would not be advisable to increase the number of these stations. The other goal of the thesis was to optimize the <b>gauging</b> <b>stations</b> with respect to the usefulness and their distribution network, whether the distribution network corresponds to the flood protection. The current distribution network of the <b>gauging</b> <b>stations</b> was analysed by means of a partial method of field research, consulting the expert books, legal regulations and a field research. By analysing these data, I tried to find out in the thesis whether optimisation of the number and the distribution network of the water level <b>gauging</b> <b>stations</b> correspond to the current requirements of the gained data from the respective subject-matter authorities. Upon the results of the analysis of the documents, it was found out that the distribution network and optimization of all <b>gauging</b> <b>stations</b> of all categories - ?A, B, C" - meet the needs of the catchment and requirements to their distribution. Upon the gained information, it was found out that Povodí Vltavy and the operators of the <b>gauging</b> <b>stations</b> have created a very clearly organised network. The hypothesis whether the water level <b>gauging</b> <b>stations</b> are distributed on all of the important rivers in South Bohemian Region was disapproved. The gained information suggests that the <b>gauging</b> <b>stations</b> are distributed on all rivers in South Bohemian Region. The research results have revealed that there is a number of locations in danger of big flooding, however, overflowing at such areas does not put in danger people?s lives, health or property. To conclude, it can be said no matter a society is prepared for flooding as best as possible, the nature, namely water, is an element that is to be respected a lot. This is very important in terms of protection of health, life, cultural heritage and property. The thesis will be offered to the water-management authorities and administrators of the location for further use...|$|R
