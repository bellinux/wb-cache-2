40|$|Background Screening for {{colorectal}} cancer is widely recommended, but the preferred strategy remains unidentified. We aimed to compare participation and diagnostic yield between screening with colonoscopy and with non-cathartic CT colonography. Methods Members {{of the general}} population, aged 50 - 75 years, and living in the regions of Amsterdam or Rotterdam, identified via the registries of the regional municipal administration, were randomly allocated (2 : 1) to be invited for primary screening for {{colorectal cancer}} by colonoscopy or by CT colonography. Randomisation was done per household with a minimisation algorithm based on age, sex, and socioeconomic status. Invitations were sent between June 8, 2009, and Aug 16, 2010. Participants assigned to CT colonography who {{were found to have}} one or more large lesions (>= 10 mm) were offered colonoscopy; those with 6 - 9 mm lesions were offered surveillance CT colonography. The primary outcome was the participation rate, defined as number of <b>invitees</b> undergoing the examination relative to the total number of <b>invitees.</b> Diagnostic yield was calculated as number of participants with advanced neoplasia relative to the total number of <b>invitees.</b> <b>Invitees</b> and screening centre employees were not masked to allocation. This trial is registered in the Dutch trial register, number NTR 1829. Findings 1276 (22 %) of 5924 colonoscopy <b>invitees</b> participated, compared with 982 (34 %) of 2920 CT colonography <b>invitees</b> (relative risk [RR] 1. 56, 95 % CI 1. 46 - 1. 68; p < 0. 0001). Of the participants in the colonoscopy group, 111 (9 %) had advanced neoplasia of whom seven (< 1 %) had a carcinoma. Of CT colonography participants, 84 (9 %) were offered colonoscopy, of whom 60 (6 %) had advanced neoplasia of whom five (< 1 %) had a carcinoma; 82 (8 %) were offered surveillance. The diagnostic yield for all advanced neoplasia was 8. 7 per 100 participants for colonoscopy versus 6. 1 per 100 for CT colonography (RR 1. 46, 95 % CI 1. 06 - 2. 03; p= 0. 02) and 1. 9 per 100 <b>invitees</b> for colonoscopy and 2. 1 per 100 <b>invitees</b> for CT colonography (RR 0. 91, 0. 66 - 2. 03; p= 0. 56). The diagnostic yield for advanced neoplasia of 10 mm or more was 1. 5 per 100 <b>invitees</b> for colonoscopy and 2. 0 per 100 <b>invitees</b> for CT colonography, respectively (RR 0. 74, 95 % CI 0. 53 - 1. 03; p= 0. 07). Serious adverse events related to the screening procedure were post-polypectomy bleedings: two in the colonoscopy group and three in the CT colonography group. Interpretation Participation in colorectal cancer screening with CT colonography was significantly better than with colonoscopy, but colonoscopy identified significantly more advanced neoplasia per 100 participants than did CT colonography. The diagnostic yield for advanced neoplasia per 100 <b>invitees</b> was similar for both strategies, indicating that both techniques can be used for population-based screening for colorectal cancer. Other factors such as cost-effectiveness and perceived burden should be taken into account when deciding which technique is preferabl...|$|R

Additionally, the leaders of the Financial Stability Board, the International Labour Organization, the International Monetary Fund, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the United Nations, the World Bank Group and the World Trade Organization are invited and participate in pre-summit planning within the policy purview of their respective organisation.

25|$|With {{the lineup}} and {{starting}} rotation largely set, the main position battles entering camp were for {{spots in the}} bullpen and on the bench. Ultimately, the available bench spots were claimed by infielder Casey McGehee, who had been claimed off waivers from the Chicago Cubs during the offseason, center fielder Chris Duffy, who was invited to camp as a non-roster <b>invitee,</b> and outfielder Brad Nelson, the Brewers' fourth-round draft pick in 2001. Mike Lamb, who had been expected to make the club before McGehee's strong spring, was released by the team on April 1; he was eventually signed to a minor league deal by the New York Mets. Closer Trevor Hoffman suffered an oblique strain in mid-March {{and was forced to}} begin the regular season on the disabled list.|$|E
25|$|Both the Nationals' {{starting}} shortstop, Trea Turner, and {{his primary}} backup, Stephen Drew, {{were placed on}} the 10-day disabled list with strained hamstrings within days of one another.

Turner was activated on April 21 for a game against the division rival New York Mets, and Green was designated for assignment; in his return, as a pinch-hitter, Turner had the game-winning RBI in a 4–3 victory when he took a bases-loaded walk in the 11th inning. On the pitching side of the ledger, left-handed reliever Sammy Solis was placed on the disabled list with elbow inflammation on April 19, and the Nationals called up Joe Ross to start against the division rival Atlanta Braves; Washington won that game 14–4 on the back of two grand slams, struck by right fielder Bryce Harper and first baseman Ryan Zimmerman, in a 20-hit effort and Ross earned the win.|$|E

With construction crews still {{putting the finishing touches}} on the stadium during the morning, the Nationals and Astros opened the Ballpark of the Palm Beaches with their first game there on February 28, with the Nationals playing as the home team at the shared facility. Commissioner of Baseball Rob Manfred cut a ceremonial ribbon, and a helicopter flyover took place during the opening ceremonies. Before a crowd of 5,897, Nationals non-roster <b>invitee</b> Jeremy Guthrie threw the first pitch at 1:07p.m. EST, to Astros first baseman Marwin González, whom he eventually struck out. In the bottom of the first inning, second baseman Daniel Murphy doubled for the first hit in the ballpark′s history, and a few minutes later scored its first run when right fielder Bryce Harper doubled to drive him home. In the top of the fourth inning, Astros designated hitter Carlos Beltrán hit the stadium′s first home run, and catcher Derek Norris hit the first Nationals home run in the park′s history in the bottom of the fourth. With two outs in the bottom of the ninth, outfielder Michael A. Taylor hit a walk-off solo home run to give the Nationals a 4-3 victory in their first game at their new spring training home.|$|E
25|$|The Nationals placed starter Stephen Strasburg on the {{paternity}} list on April 24, {{with the}} right-hander anticipating {{the birth of}} his second child, and made Jacob Turner the fourth spring training non-roster <b>invitee</b> (after Guthrie, Albers, and Green) to crack the team's active roster in the month of April. Turner, a right-handed pitcher whose contract was selected from Class-AAA Syracuse, was given the opportunity to start against the Colorado Rockies in the first of a four-game set at Coors Field. Although Turner supplied a quality start, giving up three earned runs over six innings, and left the game with a lead, the Rockies scored five unanswered runs off the Nationals' bullpen for an 8–4 finish. The game ended up being the only one the Nationals lost on their 10-game roadtrip, with their 9–1 run through series visiting the Braves, Mets, and Rockies standing as the best such mark in team history. On April 25, Trea Turner hit for the cycle {{for the first time in}} his career, cracking a two-run home run off Rockies reliever Jordan Lyles in the sixth inning and rounding out his four-hit night with a bases-clearing triple in the seventh inning as the Nationals won a high-scoring 15–12 contest. In an emphatic finish to the trip, on April 27, the Nationals defeated the Rockies 16–5, with the winning margin of 11 runs being supplied entirely in the seventh inning — the most runs the Montreal–Washington franchise had scored in an inning in almost 20 years. Strasburg was also reactivated on April 27 and Grace was optioned back to Class-AAA Syracuse, with Jacob Turner reassigned to the bullpen after his spot start.|$|E
