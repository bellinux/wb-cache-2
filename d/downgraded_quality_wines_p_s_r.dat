We explore two hypotheses regarding the spill-over of distillation policy distortions and <b>quality</b> <b>downgrading.</b> Empirical evidence from France, the largest producer of <b>quality</b> <b>wines</b> in Europe, provides support for the hypothesis that distillation policy distortions in the <b>quality</b> <b>wine</b> market have spilledover to the table wine market. As predicted by our second hypothesis, we find evidence for <b>quality</b> <b>downgrading,</b> a phenomenon that has so far received little attention in the wine economics literature.

2500|$|With {{the export}} of wine during the 17th and 18th century, {{vineyards}} began to extend along the Douro River valley bringing a mature level of economic growth. But, the temptation of easy money caused many producers to alter the <b>quality</b> of Douro <b>wines,</b> resulting in poorer <b>quality</b> <b>wines,</b> and a fall in exports. In order to remedy this situation the Marquess of Pombal created the [...] "Zona de Produção de Vinhos Generosos do Douro" [...] to designate {{the region as a}} producer of elevated <b>quality</b> <b>wines,</b> and eliminate poorer quality producers.|$|R
40|$|Italian wine {{firms are}} facing a {{significant}} reduction in wine consumption and increasing competition in international markets. In fact, markets are becoming increasingly liberalized and producers of non-EU countries adopt even more aggressive strategies to increase their competitiveness. Nevertheless, demand for high <b>quality</b> <b>wine</b> which includes a large number of Italian wines, is increasing. The aim of this work is to explain the magnitude of the trade flows for high <b>quality</b> <b>wine</b> from Italy to its main importing countries. This objective has been reached by establishing an appropriate econometric model derived from an extended form of the Gravity Model. This model has been broadly applied to the analysis of international trade because it provides robust estimates. Note that applications to the specific products trade are still limited in number. The results obtained and the model itself are useful in forecasting potential trends in the exportation of high <b>quality</b> Italian <b>wines.</b> Moreover, it is possible to identify the growing markets where Italian ventures could exploit certain promotional and communication strategies. Finally, with respect to Italian high <b>quality</b> <b>wine</b> these estimates give a quantitative evaluation of the export gains that could result from the enlargement of the EU and from an increasing liberalization in international trade.

40|$|The {{study area}} is Urlaţi wine growing centre - Dealul Mare {{vineyard}} (Prahova County, Romania). The {{aim of the}} research is the assessment of viticultural potential and delineation of natural terroir units by using a new GIS based multicriteria methodology that includes environmental criteria specific to Romanian viticulture. The viticultural potential revealed by the methodology is expressed as types of wines that can be produced in a given area in accordance with its ecological suitability. The spatial distribution of the environmental parameters and the computation of their joint influence were achieved by using GIS. The results show that Urlaţi wine-growing centre has the viticultural potential to produce red and white <b>quality</b> <b>wines.</b> The wine production directions revealed by the research are similarl to those traditionally practised in Urlaţi wine growing centre that validates the methodology. The map of viticultural potential reveals the existence of three distinct natural terroir units: a natural terroir unit suitable for red <b>quality</b> <b>wines</b> production (73. 16 % from the assessed area); a natural terroir unit suitable for white <b>quality</b> <b>wines</b> and red table wines production (25. 41 % from the assessed area); a natural terroir unit suitable exclusively for white <b>quality</b> <b>wines</b> production (1. 42 % from the assessed area) ...|$|R
