25|$|Chubbuck's lack of {{a romantic}} partner was {{considered}} a tangent of her desperate need to have close friends, though co-workers said she tended to be brusque and defensive whenever they made friendly <b>gestures</b> <b>toward</b> her. She was self-deprecating, criticizing herself constantly and rejecting any compliments she was given. Years later, her brother Greg recalled that she displayed many symptoms of bipolar disorder, which was not generally recognized in the psychiatric community {{at the time of}} her death.|$|E
25|$|In {{the midst}} of these conflicts, the {{campaign}} for the 1954 elections continued. Unhappy with some of Gálvez's <b>gestures</b> <b>toward</b> liberalization, Carías, despite his advanced age, {{decided to run for}} president and secured the PNH nomination. This move, however, split the party, and more moderate members broke away to form the Revolutionary Nationalist Movement (Movimiento Nacional Revolucionario, MNR). Their nominee was former vice president Abraham Williams Calderón. The split in the ruling party encouraged the PLH, who united behind Ramón Villeda Morales, a Tegucigalpa physician who was seen as somewhat to the left of center in the party's political spectrum.|$|E

Meanwhile, Lehnsherr sits alone at a chessboard in a San Francisco park. As he <b>gestures</b> <b>toward</b> a metal chess piece, it wobbles slightly, indicating his powers to be returning and the [...] "cure" [...] to be temporary.|$|E

500|$|Qin Hui, an {{official}} of the Song court, recommended a peaceful solution to the conflict in 1130, saying that, [...] "If it is desirable {{that there will be no}} more conflicts under Heaven, it is necessary for the southerners to stay in the south and the northerners in the north." [...] Gaozong, who considered himself a northerner, initially rejected the proposal. There were <b>gestures</b> <b>toward</b> peace in 1132, when the Jin freed an imprisoned Song diplomat, and in 1133, when the Song offered to become a Jin vassal, but a treaty never materialized. The Jin requirement that the border between the two states be moved south from the Huai River to the Yangtze was too large of a hurdle for the two sides to reach an agreement.|$|E
500|$|Tensions between Tipu and the Nizam and the British {{were raised}} when, in 1788, the East India Company gained {{control over the}} Circar of Guntur, the southernmost of the Northern Circars, {{pursuant}} to an earlier agreement with the Nizam. [...] In exchange, the company agreed to station some of its troops with the Hyderabadi army. By 1789, tensions between Tipu and his neighbours and vassals to Mysore's west, including the Kingdom of Travancore, also rose noticeably. [...] Travancore, listed in the 1784 treaty as a British ally, acquired from the Dutch East India Company two forts located within the territory of Cochin, a Mysorean vassal state. [...] The Dutch had never paid tribute to anyone for these forts since gaining control of them, {{but the fact that}} they were within Cochin's bounds was sufficient for Tipu to dispute Travancore's claim. [...] He began massing troops at Coimbatore and making threatening <b>gestures</b> <b>toward</b> Dharma Raja of Travancore. [...] British authorities in Madras warned Tipu that acts of aggression against Travancore would be met with a British response, and Cornwallis began urging John Holland, the governor of Madras, to begin military preparations. [...] On 29 December 1789, Tipu attacked Travancore's defences. Hollond, however, was not a military man, and rather than acting with vigour, he temporised and attempted negotiation with Tipu. He was replaced in early 1790 by General William Medows, to whom Cornwallis gave the authority for a military campaign against Mysore. Cornwallis began negotiating with the Marathas and the Nizam for their support, since the British forces in India were significantly lacking in cavalry, one of Tipu's strengths. The Marathas and the Nizam both had significant cavalry forces, and they were interested in recovering territories lost to Mysore in earlier conflicts. [...] However, they were too weak to attack Mysore individually, and did not trust each other, so they preferred to wait until it was clear the British were committed to act against Mysore.|$|E

2500|$|The last {{painting}} in the cycle, The Triumph of Truth, is a purely allegorical depiction of King Louis XIII and his mother, the Queen, reconciling before heaven. The Queen and Louis XIII are depicted floating in heaven, connected by the symbol of concordia, which demonstrates her sons’ forgiveness and the peace that was reached between them. [...] Below, Saturn raises Veritas to heaven which symbolizes truth being, [...] "brought to the light", {{as well as the}} reconciliation between the Queen and her son. The illustrations of Time and Truth occupy almost 3/4 of the lower canvas. The upper part of the canvas is filled with renderings of Marie and her son. In the composition, Marie is depicted as much larger than her son and occupies much more space. Her larger, less obscured body is turned frontally on the picture plane, which emphasizes her importance. Her importance is further highlighted by her equal height to her son, the King. Her son who is obscured in part by the Wing of Time, kneels before the queen and presents her with the token of amity, the clasped hands and flaming heart within a laurel crown. Compositionally, Rubens gives the queen greater importance in this panel through the use of gestures and gazes. In the work, Truth <b>gestures</b> <b>toward</b> the Queen while Time looks toward her from below. Both figures ignore the King. Rubens artfully projected both mother and son into the future, depicting them as more aged and mature than in the preceding panel (Peace is Confirmed in Heaven). It is at this point that the Medici Cycle changes to the subject of the Queen Mother's reign. With the death of son Louis' court favorite, Charles d'Albert de Luynes, mother and son reconcile. [...] Marie receives ultimate vindication by being re-admitted to the Council of State in January 1622. [...] This picture represents how time thus uncovers the truth in correspondence to the relationship between Marie and her son.|$|E
