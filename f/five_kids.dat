2500|$|The song [...] "Iron Man" [...] was {{originally}} entitled [...] "Iron Bloke"; upon hearing the main guitar riff {{for the first}} time, Osbourne remarked that it sounded [...] "like a big iron bloke walking around". The title was later changed to [...] "Iron Man" [...] as bassist and lyricist Geezer Butler composed the lyrics. [...] The riff to [...] "Iron Man" [...] is iconic among heavy metal guitarists, with Osbourne declaring in his memoir that [...] "...Tony Iommi {{turned out to be}} one of the greatest heavy rock riff-makers of all time. Whenever we went into the studio we'd challenge him to beat his last riff and he'd come up with something like 'Iron Man' and blow everyone away." [...] Butler wrote the lyrics as the story of a man who time travels into the future and sees the apocalypse. In the process of returning to the present, he is turned into steel by a magnetic field. He is rendered mute, unable verbally to warn people of his time of the impending destruction. His attempts to communicate are ignored and mocked. This causes Iron Man to become angry and have his revenge on mankind, causing the destruction seen in his vision. [...] "Electric Funeral" [...] also contains apocalyptic imagery dealing with nuclear warfare. In The Last Supper concert film, Iommi remembers that at the time with most bands [...] "it was all the 'flowers in your hair' and we wanted to sing and play about the other side of life." [...] In the 1992 documentary Don't Blame Me Osbourne concurs: [...] "It was me and <b>five</b> <b>kids</b> living in a two bedroom house.

And suddenly, you know, we hear about 'If you're going to San Francisco be sure to wear a flower in your hair'. And we're thinking, (contemptuously) 'What the fuck is San Francisco? Where is this? What's all this flower shit? I've got no shoes on my feet. [...] "You could just see that a lot of things were going wrong in the world," [...] Butler recalled to Classic Albums in 2010, [...] "and no one was saying anything about it. Bob Dylan had long since faded from the present memory and there was nobody talkin' about the things that I wanted to talk about political stuff so that's what inspired me." ...|$|E
