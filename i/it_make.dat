The city is also home to a fishing port, but inadequate infrastructure of the port restricts the growth of this sector. The industry in the city has traditionally been concentrated on processing agricultural products.|$|E

500|$|The song is {{constructed}} in a verse-pre-chorus-chorus form, with a bridge before {{the third and}} final chorus.

After the chorus, the same pattern occurs leading to the second chorus, with Victoria Beckham and Melanie Brown singing the second verse. Then the group sings the bridge, the pre-chorus, and repeats the chorus until the song gradually fades out with Mel C singing [...] "Groove It!", while Chisholm adds the high harmony—"Swing it, shake it, move <b>it,</b> <b>make</b> it".|$|E
