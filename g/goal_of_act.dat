2500|$|The main <b>goal</b> <b>of</b> <b>ACT</b> is to {{increase}} psychological flexibility. [...] There are six core processes in ACT interventions: Acceptance, Cognitive Defusion, Self as Context, Being Present, Values, and Committed Action. [...] Acceptance is taught in order to teach people to embrace their emotions, {{rather than trying to}} get rid of them. [...] An example of acceptance would be when people feel angry and then choose to focus on the anger and accept that they are angry, rather than trying to unleash their anger to get rid of it. [...] Cognitive defusion teaches people to not take their thoughts as literal in order to decrease the believability of negative thoughts and increase flexibility to behave as they want. [...] An example of cognitive defusion would be when someone thinks “I am the worst,” and then defuses the thought by thinking of things in which he or she excels.|$|E
30|$|Psychological inflexibility {{is defined}} as “the rigid {{dominance}} of psychological reactions over chosen values and contingencies in guiding action” (p. 678, Bond et al. 2011), which often occurs when individuals attempt to avoid experiencing unwanted internal events. Meanwhile, psychological flexibility refers to one’s ability {{to focus on the}} present moment fully and, according to what the situation affords, change or persist with behavior in the pursuit of goals and values (Hayes et al. 2006). Psychological inflexibility is a core concept in the acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) model (Hayes et al. 1999, 2006), which hypothesizes that psychological inflexibility leads to increased psychological dysfunction and reduced quality of life. Thus, an important <b>goal</b> <b>of</b> <b>ACT</b> is to increase psychological flexibility.|$|E

40|$|Background: Breast {{cancer is}} the most common cancer among women. Many women with breast cancer suffer from {{depression}} and psychological distress. Objectives: The present study by the purpose of examining the effect of acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) on depression and psychological flexibility in women with breast cancer was performed. Patients and Methods: The method of this research was semi-experimental, and statistic society of this research was women with breast cancer in Isfahan. In this research available sampling method was used and among patients admitted to Seyed-al-Shohada Hospital and who had registered to participate in the research, 20 people were selected randomly and they were randomly divided to two groups of control and experiment. Research tool consisted of beck depression inventory (BDI-II), acceptance and action questionnaire (AAQ-II), and demographic questionnaire. Experimental group received 8 sessions of 2 hour acceptance and commitment group therapy. Follow-up stage was performed at one month after the last treatment session. Results: Results showed that ACT significantly decreased scores on the BDI-II and increased score on AAQ-II compared to the control group (P < 0. 001). Conclusions: ACT may be considered to be an effective intervention approach for treatment of depression in women with breast cancer. It can be said that increasing in acceptance of thought and feeling associated with cancer and increasing in psychological flexibility that is the main <b>goal</b> <b>of</b> <b>ACT</b> has led to these changes...|$|E
30|$|Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) {{has shown}} to impact {{a wide variety}} of mental health {{problems}} including depression, work-site stress, and a variety of anxiety disorders ([Strosahl et al., 2004]). ACT has also affected behavioral medicine areas important to public health including obesity, chronic pain, smoking, and diabetes self-management ([Strosahl et al., 2004]). The ultimate <b>goal</b> <b>of</b> <b>ACT</b> is to help a client gain a sense of life direction that is consistent with his or her values and then begin acting {{in a way that is}} in line with those values ([Strosahl et al., 2004]). The use of new mobile technologies (e.g. smartphones) may be useful in facilitating ACT’s goal due to its popularized accessibility into mainstream culture. Mobile terminals have become an important part of our everyday lives, and they are already providing us with several services. Therefore, adding applications into new mobile technologies may be a natural step to facilitate healthier living ([Tufano & Karras, 2005]). [Boschen and Casey (2008]) summarized the advantages of using mobile phones in cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT), and the same advantages apply to smartphones: 1) mobile, 2) accepted in society in general, 3) relatively cheap (this also applies to smartphones which on average tend to be less expensive than computers), 4) they are a device with comparatively low on-going maintenance costs, 5) they are a device already owned by a large number of people, 6) they are almost always on in that they continue to operate, 7) almost always connected, 8) they are programmable, meaning they are able to run novel applications software, 9) they are capable of recording media, including audio, photographs, and in many cases video, as well as being able to play or show these media to the user, 10) they are capable of interacting with the user to allow input of data using a keypad, keyboard, or touch screen, and 11) and they are generally designed to be easy to use for most of the population.|$|E
40|$|Vast {{efforts have}} been made to improve the {{understanding}} and treatment of chronic pain as a highly complex and difficult-to-treat problem. Knowledge on psychosocial antecedents and consequences of chronic pain is now indispensable in research and practice. The overarching challenge for the field of chronic pain research is to find solutions to the magnitude of the societal problem of chronic pain, in light of the modest treatment gains for biomedical and psychological interventions. Acceptance & Commitment Therapy (ACT) is a relatively new form of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) that could possibly help to dissolve this challenge. The overarching <b>goal</b> <b>of</b> <b>ACT</b> is to attain psychological flexibility, the capacity to act effectively in accordance with intrinsically motivating values and goals in the presence of pain and associated cognitions and emotions. In doing so, ACT applies mindfulness and acceptance processes, combined with values identification and behaviour change processes. Although a growing range of studies underscores the efficacy of ACT for chronic pain, the framework needs further examination. This thesis explores several research questions - inspired by proposed venues for future psychosocial chronic pain research - regarding the measurement, efficacy and working mechanisms of ACT. Among others, the thesis shows that a range of questionnaires with good psychometric properties are available to measure the six therapeutic processes of ACT. These include the Psychological Inflexibility in Pain Scale (PIPS) and the newly developed Engaged Living Scale (ELS). Outcomes of a large, thee-armed Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) on the efficacy of a web-based self-help, ACT-based program (‘Living with Pain’) reveal that web-based ACT may be effective in improving (a. o.) pain interference in daily life. However, these effects are mainly present for those participants who adhere to the web-based intervention as intended, and who already experience mental resilience resources in the form of psychological well-being at baseline. With regard to the exploration of mechanisms of change, this thesis to a large extent confirms the premises of ACT’s theoretical psychological flexibility model both between (during the RCT) and within (during n-of- 1 studies) persons. Finally, this thesis describes the successful implementation of ACT into Dutch chronic pain rehabilitation...|$|E

40|$|Intimate partner {{violence}} (IPV) is {{a serious}} public health concern. Existing interventions for male IPV offenders (i. e., Duluth Model with CBT principles) have shown small-to-negligible effects in reducing future perpetration of violence and have high dropout rates. Offenders who fail to complete treatment, or are deemed to be at “high risk”, are sent to jail. Efficacious and acceptable interventions for incarcerated IPV offenders are needed. The objective of this dissertation study was to test the feasibility of implementing an Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) skills group with incarcerated IPV offers. The ultimate <b>goal</b> <b>of</b> <b>ACT</b> is to help individuals make behavioral choices {{in the service of}} their values, despite the presence of unwanted internal experiences, through the use of acceptance and mindfulness skills. The specific aims of the study were: 1) to examine post-treatment effects in the targeted ACT skills (i. e., present-moment awareness, acceptance, defusion, experiential avoidance), internalizing symptoms, and externalizing behaviors; and to test whether treatment effects were moderated by IPV-related criminal history severity (IPV-CHS); 2) to explore participants’ perceptions of the group; and 3) to examine whether pre-treatment IPV-CHS predicted worse ACT skills and greater symptom severity at pre-treatment. A sample of 33 court-mandated IPV offenders who participated in the 1 month ACT skills group (12 sessions, delivered 3 times per week) and who completed self-report questionnaires at pre and post treatment was used to evaluate the first two aims. The sample used to evaluate aim three consisted of 58 participants who had completed either the ACT skills group or another treatment offered at the jail at the time (treatment-as-usual) and for whom pre-treatment data were available. Quantitative results revealed that ACT did not produce significant pre to post changes in any of the outcome measures (i. e., ACT skills, internalizing symptoms, and externalizing behaviors), that IPV-CHS did not reliably moderate treatment effects, and that IPV-CHS did not predict worse ACT skills or greater symptom severity at pre-treatment. Qualitative results, however, revealed that participants viewed the ACT treatment favorably, found the material useful, and felt accepted and understood by the facilitators. The present study provides evidence for the feasibility of administering a standardized ACT-based protocol within a correctional setting. It further demonstrated that incarcerated IPV offenders perceived ACT to be an acceptable and useful treatment approach. The quantitative data, however, do not support the widespread dissemination of this ACT protocol with incarcerated IPV offenders at this time. Future research should follow-up on these discrepant findings by testing this ACT protocol with a larger sample, randomizing into ACT versus control group, including multiple follow-up time points, collecting one-year recidivism data, and exploring the effects of longer treatment and alternate forms of delivery (e. g., combination of individual and group sessions).
