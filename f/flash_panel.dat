50|$|The lantern room of {{the tower}} is no longer {{equipped}} with the original first-order, 1000-watt Fresnel lens. No longer illuminated for demonstration purposes, the lens has 24 <b>flash</b> <b>panels,</b> is composed of 1008 hand-polished lenses and prisms and is capable of producing over 500,000 candlepower illumination. It was manufactured by the Henry-LePaute company in Paris, France and was first lit at Pigeon Point at sunset on November 15, 1872.|$|R

50|$|Before playing, a red sensor must be {{attached}} to the lower right corner of the television screen. This corner contains a circle that was usually black, but flashes rapidly whenever something on the screen is targetable. At the same time, targets are highlighted by rapidly <b>flashing</b> <b>panels</b> for the player to shoot at. The console uses the corner circle and light from the targets (picked up by the guns) to determine when something has been hit. Flashes in sync with the corner circle count as enemy hits, and earn points for the player. Flashes out of sync with the corner circle count as friendly hits, losing points.|$|R

5000|$|The {{light was}} {{completed}} in November 1896, but traffic on the Great Lakes is not a year round event, so it wasn't until the spring of 1897 that it was first lit. The station was automated in 1969 and is still operational. Foundation materials are wood pilings, and it is constructed of brick in a square shape. Markings are white with a black lantern. Another structure {{is attached to the}} tower. The original lens was a fourth order Fresnel lens [...] designed and manufactured by Henry-Lepaute in Paris. It had six bulls-eye <b>flash</b> <b>panels,</b> and the clockwork would rotate it so that it would emit a white flash every ten seconds. [...] The lens now in place is the third or fourth such lens to occupy that position.|$|R
50|$|In his artistics beginnings, between 1949 and 1953, he was {{influenced}} by the American comic artist Alex Raymond, creator of <b>Flash</b> Gordon. The <b>panel,</b> he said, began his connection with artistic expression.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to its primary function of being a GUI composer for Adobe Flex components, Flash Catalyst also features a basic code workspace, which consists of a subset of Adobe <b>Flash</b> Builder's <b>panels.</b> Both tools being based on Eclipse, the code editor, project navigator and problems view are basically the same in both products. Thus for a simple project Flash Catalyst may even {{be used as the}} sole software for the entire authoring/programming steps.|$|R
25|$|The {{original}} {{illuminating apparatus}} was an 1885, lenticular 3rd order lens, manufactured by Sautter, Lemonnier & Company of France. The central drum measured 1 meter in diameter. It had six panels of which three were <b>flashing</b> <b>panels.</b> In each {{panel of the}} central drum there were seven elements; each panel above central drum had eleven prisms and four prisms below. The flashes were produced by the central revolving drum mounted on a chariot activated by a clock work system. The clock cord descended through the central column in the stairway. The mechanism was protected by a circular iron and glass case. The original light characteristic showed a white flash every 3 seconds and had an 18-mile range. In 1923 the light characteristics were changed. In 1945 the light was electrified. It was also changed into an automatic, unwatched light that exhibited the original characteristics. The structure was abandoned and boarded up. The lens {{was replaced by a}} 500mm lens. No record has been found which indicates that major structural changes or alterations were introduced in the dwelling. The decorative elements are purely neo-classic especially its cornices and pediment.|$|R

While he watched the landau stopped, {{and in a few}} moments the horses were turned, the wheels and the <b>panels</b> <b>flashed,</b> and the carriage came bowling along towards the castle again.|$|R
50|$|Many panels {{today have}} the {{capability}} of alerting building personnel of a situation which can arise into a potentially serious problem. Fire alarm panels indicate an abnormal condition via a solid or <b>flashing</b> LED. Some <b>panels</b> also contain a small sounder, {{used in conjunction with}} the visual alert. A number of indicators are shown below. Note that not all fire alarm panels have all of these indicators.|$|R
50|$|The Dragon's Cave {{is simply}} one long, narrow hallway lined by jagged rock protrusions, with no monsters to fight; the primary danger is traps. Two {{varieties}} exist — poison darts which fly {{back and forth}} in one set line, and invisible floor panels which, when stepped on, trigger an unavoidable burst of <b>flash</b> damage. These <b>panels</b> can be detected with a spell, while the darts can simply be run past. Succeeding in navigating the cave's dangers will result in coming upon a pit in the floor which leads to the dragon himself.|$|R
5000|$|The Pearl & Dean anthem [...] "Asteroid" [...] is just 28 seconds long. The {{original}} screen titles featured graphics {{intended to}} emulate advertising <b>panels</b> <b>flashing</b> past {{as if the}} viewer was being sucked into the very screen. By the early 1990s, commercials and trailers were given the full stereo treatment, but the original [...] "Asteroid" [...] was only ever produced purely as a mono track. Remarkably, {{not only was the}} original composer/producer tracked down but Moore was also able to locate two of the three original male singers who could still replicate their vocal parts three decades on.|$|R
500|$|Frank's Cock {{divides the}} screen into quadrants, with the {{majority}} of the film focusing on the upper-right corner of the screen. In this panel, Rennie's character gives a monologue, which is sometimes illustrated by images in other panels: the lower-right <b>panel</b> <b>flashes</b> scenes of hardcore gay pornography, the upper-left shows scenes representing human embryo formation, while the lower-left flashes excerpts from popular art. Aside from the original footage of Rennie, the short appropriated clips from the Nova episode [...] "The Miracle of Life", the gay pornographic film The Best of Blondes, and the music video for Madonna's 1992 song [...] "Erotica". The effect was later reused in Hoolboom's 1997 short Positiv.|$|R
50|$|Occasionally {{at the end}} of {{the program}} a Super Case is brought out. This feature was {{introduced}} in 2004. Contestants have the opportunity to either keep the deal they made or forfeit it and take whatever value is hidden in the Super Case. The Super Case contains one of the following values: 50c, $50, $500, $5,000, $10,000, $20,000, $30,000, $50,000. Super Cases appear in most episodes when contestants take a deal of approximately $10,000 when there are at least five cases left on the board, and rarely appear in any other circumstances. This means that the Super Case offers a 50/50 chance at bettering or equalling the $10,000 deal. If contestants take a $10,000 deal with fewer than four cases left on the board, Super Cases are rare because there is not generally any time left in the show to run it. During the 2006 season, the way of telling the contestant that a Super Case will be brought out changed, where instead of the Super Case <b>panel</b> <b>flashing,</b> a Super Case alert flashes beside the 'Cases remaining' panel, and remains there until it is actually brought out. In 2010 the Super Case has been used more frequently.|$|R
40|$|The Oregon Department of Transportation {{evaluated}} {{the effectiveness of}} a “sequentially <b>flashing</b> diamond” arrow <b>panel</b> display as an advance caution warning in temporary work zones. This display was evaluated by comparing it to flashing line and flashing four-corner modes. When surveyed, 33 state transportation agencies rated each display about the same in terms of effectiveness. Daytime and nighttime field trials using the three modes were conducted in two work zones set up on highway shoulders. Nine hours of evaluation time at each site was divided into three, three-hour test periods, with each display operating for one hour. Hourly average and 85 th percentile speeds recorded during the tests were lower than corresponding hourly baseline speeds for all display modes. The greatest speed reductions occurred when the diamond display was operating. Additionally, motorists at a highway rest area were surveyed about the three displays that were operating in the parking area. Over 70 % of 274 respondents chose the diamond display as the most effective at getting their attention, and 80 % said {{they would like to see}} the diamond used when work is taking place on Oregon highways. However, 61 % found the three displays confusing, particularly the line and the four-corner. The results of the field trials and motorist survey show potential for the diamond display’s use as an advance warning device in temporary work zones...|$|R
5000|$|... 1967 was {{the final}} year that Corgi issued Monte Carlo Rally cars, and the famous Mini Cooper S (339) {{appeared}} yet again in March, this time with four jewelled rally lamps in the grill, a sump guard and two spare wheels on a roof rack borrowed from the 'Surfing' Mini Traveller (485) from 1965. The 1967 Monte Carlo Rally Mini Cooper S stayed in the Corgi range until 1972, spanning two different castings. Another Mini Cooper S (333) was released in February 1967 carrying the same red and white paintwork, but as campaigned in the 1967 RAC/Sun rally by Tony Fall and Mike Wood, along with another Rover 2000 (322) from the same event finished in white with a matt black bonnet. The final Monte Carlo Rally car was the Sunbeam Imp (340) issued in March 1967, which featured four jewelled rally lamps and was finished in blue with a white <b>flash</b> and front <b>panel.</b> In December 1965 a Volkswagen 1200 Beetle was issued in East African Safari finish (256). This model featured an opening boot and engine cover and steerable front wheels operated by a spare tyre {{on the roof of}} the car. The colourful packaging was completed with the inclusion of a model of a charging rhinoceros. Three years later in July 1969 Corgi issued the winning Hillman Hunter from the 1968 London to Sydney Marathon (302), complete with Take-Off Wheels, roof mounted tool box and a plastic kangaroo guard across the front of the car. This time the packaging included a model kangaroo and details of the event, and in February 1970 a model of the unique 4wd Ford Capri 3-Litre rally car (303) driven by Roger Clark was released. A model of the successful Datsun 240Z rally car in East African Safari Finish (394) was issued in October 1972 and in May 1973 the Datsun 240Z was also issued in [...] "US Rally" [...] finish (396). This, in fact, was an authentic model of John Morton's 300 bhp BRE-Datsun 240Z which won the 1970 and 1971 SCCA class C/P championships. The Ferrari 365GTB/4 Daytona as raced at the 1973 Le Mans 24 Hours race, with JCB and Corgi sponsorship (324), was released in June 1973 along with another in white/red/blue livery inspired by a 1972 Le Mans entry (323). In July 1973 the Porsche-Audi 917/10 (397) from the Can-Am race series was issued with L&M cigarette sponsorship.|$|R
