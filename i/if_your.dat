Just this week the announcement comes {{as a shock to}} the people of Oklahoma that the Secretary of the Interior... has appointed a Negro from Kansas to come to Oklahoma and take charge of the supervision of the Indian schools of this State. There is no race of people on earth that has more antipathy for the Negro race than the Indian race, and yet these people, numbering many of the best citizens of this State and nation, are to be humbled and their prejudices and passions are to be increased by having this outrage imposed upon them... <b>If</b> <b>your</b> organization would interest itself to the extent of seeing that such outrages as this are not perpetrated against our people, there would be fewer lynchings in the South than at this time...|$|E

25|$|Nobody {{wants the}} {{insolvent}} to be destitute. The insolvent, therefore, {{is allowed to}} follow any profession or occupation, and to enter into any contracts related thereto. The insolvent, however, requires {{the consent of the}} trustee in order to carry on the business of a trader or manufacturer. If the trustee refuses this permission, the insolvent may appeal to the Master. Why? Because of the disposition of assets: <b>If</b> <b>your</b> business is buying and selling, the trustee's work is made very difficult.|$|E
25|$|With {{a bishop}} opening, it's common to {{exchange}} bishops by having one capture the other.

However, it is not advantageous to exchange bishops <b>if</b> <b>your</b> opponent has a better defensive setup, or more lines of attack. Moreover, making a bishop exchange constitutes one turn loss, so it's not advised without a good reason.|$|E

25|$|Family {{history and}} ancestry are factors that {{increase}} the risk of beta thalassemia. Depending on your family history, <b>if</b> <b>your</b> parents or grandparents suffered from beta thalassemia there is a high probability of the mutated gene being inherited by an offspring. Even if a child does not have beta thalassemia major, they can still be a carrier resulting in future offspring having beta thalassemia. Another risk factor is because of certain ancestry. Beta thalassemia occurs most often in people of Italian, Greek, Middle Eastern, Southern Asian, and African ancestry.|$|E
25|$|Generally, 4grams of tea per 200 ml of water. Unlike green teas, which turn bitter when brewed {{at higher}} temperatures, black tea should be steeped in water {{brought up to}} 90–95°C. The first brew should be 60 sec., the second brew 40 sec., and the third brew 60 sec. <b>If</b> <b>your</b> tea is of high quality, you can {{continue}} to brew by progressively adding 10 sec. to the brew time following the third infusion (note: when using a larger tea pot the ratio of tea to water {{will need to be}} adjusted to achieve similar results).|$|E
25|$|Stick heights are {{not only}} {{important}} for visual reasons but they also strongly affect the sound quality. To get a uniform and consistent sound, one must play with even stick heights {{on the right and}} left hand. To practice playing with accurate stick heights, set up your drum or pad in front of a mirror. Start with a simple exercise and watch to see <b>if</b> <b>your</b> left heights are even with your right. If you have access to a video camera, you can record yourself and watch it later. It is easier to watch your heights and critique your performance when you are not focusing on playing.|$|E

25|$|Garlic & Onions* are {{toxic to}} dogs. Onions, Garlic, Chives - {{can cause the}} {{destruction}} of red blood cells known as Heinz body anemia, a form of hemolytic anemia. No clear quantity has been established as to {{the onset of the}} anemia. But for garlic, <b>if</b> <b>your</b> dog consumes the equivalent of 1 teaspoon of garlic for every 10 pounds of their weight (1 teaspoon for a 10-pound dog) it can destroy red blood cells. Poisonous reaction can result from raw, cooked or dried onions, garlic, chives, including those included in powdered or dehydrated forms.

25|$|The {{following}} {{table is}} a breakdown of each letter in the Hebrew alphabet, describing its name or names, and its Latin script transliteration values used in academic work. If two glyphs are shown for a consonant, then the left-most glyph is the final form of the letter (or right-most glyph <b>if</b> <b>your</b> browser doesn't support right-to-left text layout). The conventions here are ISO 259, the UNGEGN system based on the old-fashioned Hebrew Academy system, and the modern common informal Israeli transcription. In addition, an International Phonetic Alphabet pronunciation is indicatedhistorical (Tiberian vocalization) for ISO 259, prescribed for Hebrew Academy, and in practice for Israeli. For the vowels further down, the letters ח and ט are used as symbolic anchors for vowel symbols, but should otherwise be ignored.|$|E
25|$|Examples of {{infidelity}} are found acted out in television and film {{because of the}} drama often. In {{the beginning of the}} popular series Grey’s Anatomy, one of TV’s most beloved couples, Derek and Meredith, began their relationship while Derek was married to Addison. Although, Derek and Meredith went on to have a strong relationship, Addison changed. She never married again, or even held a serious relationship for long, during her time on the series and let her bitterness for Derek’s unfaithfulness be known. Another example is the film The Other Women. It is based off the unfaithfulness of one man to three different women. When the wife finds out about the affair she has a breakdown. She cries, she becomes helpless without the support of others and she drinks in attempts {{to come to grips with}} the infidelity. There are many more examples {{of infidelity}} in films and television, and real life, but the point is: <b>if</b> <b>your</b> partner cheats on you it is impossible to be completely unbothered.|$|E
