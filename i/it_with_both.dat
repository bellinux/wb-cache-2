It necessitated the widening of the highway and construction of a traffic light and turn lanes at its entrance.|$|E
5|$|Turahan {{also took}} several {{measures}} {{to restore order}} and prosperity in his province, most notably the foundation (or re-foundation) {{of the town of}} Tyrnavos, which before was a small pastoral settlement. To attract and protect the local Greek Orthodox population, he granted it special privileges, such as special administrative status as a waqf (a religious endowment) of the Sharif of Mecca, tax exemptions and the prohibition of Ottoman troops from passing through the town. He also endowed <b>it</b> <b>with</b> <b>both</b> a mosque (destroyed after the Greek annexation of Thessaly in 1881) and a church, St Nicholas Turahan, which survives to this day. Turahan also endowed many other public buildings such as mosques, monasteries, madrasas, schools, caravanserais, bridges and baths across the province. He also took care to maintain and foster the Thessalian cotton, silk and wool textile industry, to the extent that later generations attributed to him the introduction of new dye techniques based on yellow berries, madder and the kali plant, used in the manufacture of potash. From there these materials spread to the rest of Rumelia and thence to Western Europe.|$|E
5|$|At first, Harvey {{struggled}} in the English conditions, failing to pass 25 {{in his first}} six innings. His most notable contribution {{in the early stages}} of the campaign was against Yorkshire in Bradford, on a damp pitch that suited slower bowling. The match saw 324 runs fall for 36 wickets. No sooner had Harvey walked out to bat, stand-in captain Lindsay Hassett was caught to leave Australia at 5/20 in pursuit of 60. To make matters worse, Sam Loxton was injured and could not bat, so Australia were effectively six wickets down and faced its first loss to an English county since 1912. Harvey had scored a solitary run when he hit a ball to Len Hutton at short leg, who dived forwards and grabbed <b>it</b> <b>with</b> <b>both</b> hands before dropping it. Harvey then swept the next ball for a boundary. Colin McCool was out at 6/31 before Harvey and wicket-keeper Don Tallon steadied Australia. Harvey was reprieved on 12; he charged the bowling but the wicketkeeper fumbled the stumping opportunity. Harvey then hit the winning runs with a six over the sightscreen, ending unbeaten on 18 not out. It was the closest Australia had come to defeat for the whole tour.|$|E

5|$|Harvey {{made his}} debut on English {{soil in the}} second tour match against Leicestershire. Batting at No. 5, he came in at 3/316 and made 12, {{struggling}} against the local spinners, as Australia collapsed to end on 448 before winning by an innings. Harvey {{played a key role}} in Australia's victory in the next match against Yorkshire in Bradford, on a damp pitch that suited slower bowling. Harvey took two catches in the home side's first innings of 71. He made seven in the first innings as Australia replied with 101. After the hosts were bowled out for 89 in their second innings, Australia collapsed to 4/20 in pursuit of 60 for victory. No sooner had Harvey walked out to bat at No. 6, stand-in captain Lindsay Hassett—Bradman rested himself for the match—top-edged a pull shot and was caught to leave Australia at 5/20. To make matters worse, Sam Loxton was injured and could not bat, so Australia were effectively six wickets down and faced their first loss to an English county since 1912.

Harvey was reprieved on 12; he took several steps down the pitch to the bowling of Frank Smailes and missed, but the wicketkeeper fumbled the stumping opportunity. Harvey then hit the winning runs by lifting Smailes for a six over the sightscreen, ending unbeaten on 18 not out.|$|E

The LIRR leased the NY in 1882, not merging it until 1925. Under Corbin's entire 16-year control, the LIRR continuously paid dividends to its stockholders.|$|E

500|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 1930s, Ravel was working on two piano concertos. He completed the Piano Concerto in D major for the Left Hand first. It was commissioned by the Austrian pianist Paul Wittgenstein, who had lost his right arm during the war. Ravel was stimulated by the technical challenges of the project: [...] "In a work of this kind, it is essential to give the impression of a texture no thinner than that of a part written for both hands." [...] Ravel, not proficient enough to perform the work with only his left hand, demonstrated <b>it</b> <b>with</b> <b>both</b> hands. Wittgenstein was initially disappointed by the piece, but after long study he became fascinated by it and ranked it as a great work. In January 1932 he premiered it in Vienna to instant acclaim, and performed it in Paris with Ravel conducting the following year. The critic Henry Prunières wrote, [...] "From the opening measures, we are plunged into a world in which Ravel has but rarely introduced us." ...|$|E

500|$|Attention also {{focused on}} Jaguar's {{improved}} pace during the event. Prior to the race, {{the team had}} been criticised by the media {{for their ability to}} perform well in the series with some publications criticising their move of signing Evans and Carroll to drive their cars. Evans said his improved performance encouraged everyone working for the team and it gave Jaguar more confidence: [...] "If you look at the bigger picture, I’ve got to be satisfied with today. Qualifying was great, to be honest, I topped the group. If you ask me or the whole team if this would have happened after Marrakesh, we would have taken <b>it</b> <b>with</b> <b>both</b> hands." [...] Carroll hoped he would have a strong performance in the event and be faster than he could be but it was an issue that could be improved on. Jaguar team principal James Barclay stated the improvement was [...] "a little bit of a positive surprise" [...] but was unsure if Carroll's problem {{at the start of the}} race was caused by driver error or an electrical issue but admitted his team had to improve their understanding of full course yellow in future races.|$|E

[...] "In football, {{there is not}} much sentiment. But, if sentiment is involved in this scenario, then they gave me my very first chance as a player so I grabbed <b>it</b> <b>with</b> <b>both</b> hands," [...] said Mariner on the New England Revolution website, the club he left to rejoin Argyle. [...] "Plymouth Argyle are in my blood. Obviously the teams you're associated with are the ones you look for every week, and when they came knocking on my door asking me to be employed there, I was delighted." [...] His first match in the dugout alongside Sturrock ended in disappointment as Argyle lost 3–1 to Bristol City at Ashton Gate. They faced Ipswich Town, another side struggling for form, at home in their next match and a first-half goal from Fletcher put Argyle ahead, but their hopes of claiming three points were dented when the visitors equalised through striker Jon Stead, who capitalised on a poor back pass from Gary Sawyer. Welshman Darcy Blake, on loan from Cardiff City, was shown a straight red card late in the game as it ended all square. Their final game of October took place on Halloween against Middlesbrough, in Gordon Strachan's first game as their new manager. Argyle came away from the Riverside Stadium with all three points, in a game that saw Adam Johnson miss from the penalty spot, thanks to a second-half goal from Mackie to lift them to 22nd in the league table, within three points of Doncaster Rovers.|$|E
