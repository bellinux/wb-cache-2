5|$|The red-winged fairywren is a {{cooperative}} breeding species, {{with a pair}} or small group of birds maintaining and <b>defending</b> <b>a</b> territory year-round. These territories average around 0.4–2.4hectares (1–6acres) in optimal habitat of tall karri forest, although are smaller and restricted to dense riverbank undergrowth in less favourable habitats.|$|E
5|$|Vocal {{communication}} among variegated fairywrens is used primarily for communication between birds {{in a social}} group and for advertising and <b>defending</b> <b>a</b> territory. The basic song type is a high-pitched reel {{of a large number}} of short elements (10–20 per second); this lasts 1–4 seconds. The reel of the variegated fairywren is the softest of all malurids. Birds maintain contact with each other by tsst or seeee calls, while a short, sharp tsit serves as an alarm call.|$|E
5|$|Dingle, who {{had been}} a member of the Oxford Officers Training Corps, was gazetted second {{lieutenant}} in the 6th Battalion, East Yorkshire Regiment, which took part in the Suvla Bay Landing of the Gallipoli Campaign on 6 August 1915. His battalion took Scimitar Hill on 9 August, with great loss of life, only to be forced to make a tactical withdrawal. On 21 August, the Battle of Scimitar Hill ensued, a disaster for Britain and her allies: Dingle was killed the following day, <b>defending</b> <b>a</b> trench that had earlier been captured. He is commemorated on the Helles Memorial to the missing dead.|$|E

5|$|Features {{necessary}} for <b>defending</b> <b>a</b> territory {{such as the}} horns and broad-based skull of the modern black wildebeest, {{have been found in}} their fossil ancestors. The earliest known fossil remains are in sedimentary rock in Cornelia in the Orange Free State and date back about eight hundred thousand years. Fossils have also been reported from the Vaal River deposits, though it is unclear {{whether or not they are}} as ancient as those found in Cornelia. Horns of the black wildebeest have been found in sand dunes near Hermanus in South Africa. This is far beyond the recorded range of the species and it has been suggested that these animals may have migrated to that region from the Karoo.|$|E
5|$|Kaoru is the {{instructor}} of the Kamiya Kasshin martial-arts school. She inherited her fighting style {{and a small}} dojo from her father, who was drafted by a police swordsmen unit and died <b>defending</b> <b>a</b> comrade during the Seinan War. At {{the beginning of the}} story, Kaoru has no students and runs the dojo alone; she seems likely to lose it when Kenshin helps her. Despite occasional mood swings and a reputation for bad cooking, she is independent, compassionate, courageous and a good fighter. In her first appearance, Kaoru searches for the assassin Hitokiri Battosai, who claims to be from Kamiya Kasshin-ryu. Kaoru is saved by the real Battosai, Himura Kenshin, and invites him to her dojo.|$|E
5|$|Males sing {{constantly}} as {{the breeding}} period approaches and perform less often once pairs have bonded. In {{the presence of}} a female, a male sometimes flies to his nest and sings from the entrance, apparently attempting to entice the female in. Older birds tend to have a wider repertoire than younger ones. Those males that engage in longer bouts of singing and that have wider repertoires attract mates earlier and have greater reproductive success than others. Females appear to prefer mates with more complex songs, perhaps because this indicates greater experience or longevity. Having a complex song is also useful in <b>defending</b> <b>a</b> territory and deterring less experienced males from encroaching.|$|E

On his return, he volunteered again for active service and enlisted in the Wellington Mounted Rifles, joining the machine gun section. After promotion to sergeant, he departed in October for Egypt. There, he captained his regiment's rugby team in matches against other New Zealand and Australian regiments. He landed at Anzac Cove on 8August 1915 and participated in the action to capture Chunuk Bair in the Gallipoli Campaign. The following day he was killed in action.|$|E
5|$|The 4th Army was a Royal Yugoslav Army {{formation}} mobilised {{prior to}} the German-led Axis invasion of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in April 1941 during World War II. It was drawn from the peacetime 4th Army District. When mobilised, it consisted of three divisions, a brigade-strength detachment, one horse cavalry regiment and one independent infantry regiment. It formed part of the 1st Army Group, and was responsible for <b>defending</b> <b>a</b> large section of the Yugoslav–Hungarian border, being deployed behind the Drava river between Varaždin and Slatina.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Villers-Bocage {{took place}} during the Second World War on 13 June 1944, one week after the Normandy Landings by the Western Allies that began the conquest of German-occupied France.

After one day of fighting in and around the small town of Villers-Bocage and a second day <b>defending</b> <b>a</b> position outside the town, the British force retired.|$|E

5|$|The {{experience}} of the Battle of the Somme led the German command {{to conclude that the}} policy of rigidly <b>defending</b> <b>a</b> trench position line was no longer effective against the firepower that the Entente armies had accumulated. Ludendorff published a new defensive doctrine in December 1916, in which deeper defences were to be built, within which the garrison would have room to manoeuvre, rather than rigidly holding successive lines of trenches. Along Vimy Ridge, the German forces spent two years constructing fortifications designed for rigid defence. Little reconstruction based upon the new defence-in-depth doctrine had been accomplished by April 1917 because the terrain made it impractical.|$|E
5|$|William was famously {{biased against}} the Knights Templar, whom he {{believed}} to be arrogant and disrespectful of both secular and ecclesiastical hierarchies, as they {{were not required to}} pay tithes and were legally accountable only to the Pope. Although he was writing decades later, he is the earliest author to describe the actual foundation of the Templar order. He was generally favourable towards them when discussing their early days, but resented the power and influence they held in his own time. William accused them of hindering the Siege of Ascalon in 1153; of poorly <b>defending</b> <b>a</b> cave-fortress in 1165, for which twelve Templars were hanged by King Amalric; of sabotaging the invasion of Egypt in 1168; and of murdering Assassin ambassadors in 1173.|$|E
5|$|With {{the rapid}} Japanese advance through the Pacific {{and the fall}} of Singapore in February 1942, the 3,400 troops aboard Orcades were {{diverted}} from Sumatra to Java in the Dutch East Indies. Disembarking at Batavia on 18 February, Peeler's battalion was combined with the other units aboard Orcades to form Blackforce. This ad hoc grouping, {{under the command of}} fellow Victoria Cross holder Brigadier Arthur Blackburn, was tasked with <b>defending</b> <b>a</b> series of airfields and supporting the Dutch. Blackburn organised his men into a brigade formation, consisting of a headquarters and three infantry battalions—the men of the 2/2nd Pioneers made up the bulk of Blackforce's 2nd Battalion.|$|E

5|$|<b>Defending</b> <b>a</b> {{breeding}} {{territory is}} fairly common among male dragonflies, especially among species that congregate around ponds in large numbers. The territory contains desirable {{features such as}} a sunlit stretch of shallow water, a special plant species, or a particular substrate necessary for egg-laying. The territory may be small or large, depending on its quality, the time of day, {{and the number of}} competitors, and may be held for a few minutes or several hours. Some dragonflies signal ownership with striking colours on the face, abdomen, legs, or wings. The common whitetail (Plathemis lydia) dashes towards an intruder holding its white abdomen aloft like a flag. Other dragonflies engage in aerial dogfights or high-speed chases. A female must mate with the territory holder before laying her eggs. There is also conflict between the males and females. Females may sometimes be harassed by males {{to the extent that it}} affects their normal activities including foraging and in some dimorphic species females have evolved multiple forms with some forms appearing deceptively like males. In some species females have evolved behavioural responses such as feigning death to escape the attention of males.|$|E
5|$|Ida {{insisted that}} McKinley {{continue}} his increasingly successful career {{in law and}} politics. He attended the state Republican convention that nominated Hayes for a third term as governor in 1875, and campaigned again for his old friend in the election that fall. The next year, McKinley undertook a high-profile case <b>defending</b> <b>a</b> group of coal miners arrested for rioting after a clash with strikebreakers. Lynch, McKinley's opponent in the 1871 election, and his partner, William R. Day, were the opposing counsel, and the mine owners included Mark Hanna, a Cleveland businessman. Taking the case pro bono, he was successful in getting {{all but one of}} the miners acquitted. The case raised McKinley's standing among laborers, a crucial part of the Stark County electorate, and also introduced him to Hanna, who would become his strongest backer in years to come.|$|E
5|$|In the Sonic the Hedgehog series from Archie Comics, Amy learns about Sonic from folktales in {{her home}} kingdom of Mercia. She admires him, and tries several times to join the Freedom Fighters (a {{resistance}} group to which he belongs); however, she is rejected because of her age. She sends Sonic fan mail, but Eggman intercepts it and kidnaps her. Sonic rescues her and Tails (another Freedom Fighter captured by Eggman), and they leave {{for the city of}} Mobotropolis. Although Amy continues trying to join the Freedom Fighters, she is still rejected; when she wishes on an ancient artifact to become older, her immature mind gives her away. She helps the group defeating a number of powerful enemies, however, and is admitted after <b>defending</b> <b>a</b> fort from Eggman and his robots.|$|E
