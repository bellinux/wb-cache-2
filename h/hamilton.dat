5|$|After {{five years}} with San Diego, <b>Hamilton</b> {{was traded to}} the Toronto Blue Jays on December 12, 1998, for Peter Tucci, Carlos Almanzar, and Woody Williams. Analysts believe that Toronto {{acquired}} <b>Hamilton</b> if Roger Clemens's trade request was successful. <b>Hamilton</b> began the 1999 season with the Syracuse SkyChiefs, the Triple-A affiliate of the Blue Jays. He started three games, recording one loss, no wins, and a 5.11 ERA in 12 innings pitched. The Blue Jays called him up, and <b>Hamilton</b> made 18 starts in 22 games pitched. Pitching in 98 innings, he went 78 with a 6.52 ERA.|$|E

5|$|Alexander <b>Hamilton</b> {{was born}} and spent part of his {{childhood}} in Charlestown, {{the capital of the}} island of Nevis in the Leeward Islands (then part of the British West Indies). <b>Hamilton</b> and his older brother James Jr. (1753–1786) were born out of wedlock to Rachel Faucette, a married woman of half-British and half-French Huguenot descent, and James A. <b>Hamilton,</b> a Scotsman who was the fourth son of Laird Alexander <b>Hamilton</b> of Grange, Ayrshire. Speculation that Hamilton's mother was of mixed race, though persistent, is not substantiated by verifiable evidence.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{official}} website of the <b>Hamilton</b> Tiger-Cats consider {{them as the}} same team, the Tiger-Cats, <b>Hamilton</b> Alerts, <b>Hamilton</b> Tigers and <b>Hamilton</b> Flying Wildcats are all listed separately because, when the latter three were active, the teams competed as separate franchises. The Tigers and Flying Wildcats merged in 1950 to create the Tiger-Cats.|$|E
5|$|As the {{university}} grew, McMaster Hall started to become overcrowded. The suggestion to move {{the university}} to <b>Hamilton</b> was first brought up by a student and <b>Hamilton</b> native in 1909, although the proposal was not seriously considered by the university until two years later. By the 1920s, after previous proposals between various university staff, the <b>Hamilton</b> Chamber of Commerce launched a campaign to bring McMaster University to <b>Hamilton.</b> As the issue of space at McMaster Hall became more acute, the university administration debated {{the future of the}} university. The university nearly became federated with the University of Toronto, as had been the case with Trinity College and Victoria College. Instead, in 1927, the university administration decided to transfer the university to <b>Hamilton.</b> The Baptist Convention of Ontario and Quebec secured $1.5 million, while the citizens of <b>Hamilton</b> raised an additional $500,000 to help finance the move. The lands for the university and new buildings were secured through gifts from graduates. Lands were transferred from Royal Botanical Gardens to establish the campus area. The first academic session on the new <b>Hamilton</b> campus began in 1930. McMaster's property in Toronto was sold to the University of Toronto when McMaster moved to <b>Hamilton</b> in 1930. McMaster Hall is now home to the Royal Conservatory of Music.|$|E

5|$|DRS was enabled on the 24th lap. Although <b>Hamilton</b> {{had closed}} Rosberg's lead {{to half a}} second and used the system, he could not pass his teammate. Räikkönen made a {{problematic}} pit stop that lap, as his mechanics struggled to install a right-front wheel nut correctly. <b>Hamilton</b> tried to pass Rosberg again the following lap by running in his slipstream, but Rosberg held the line and had enough acceleration to defend first place. <b>Hamilton</b> held a tighter line, while Rosberg complained of more oversteer on lap 26. On the 27th lap, <b>Hamilton</b> forgot to deactivate his DRS system and lost control of his rear end; his brakes locked, and {{he went into the}} turn one run-off area. However, he caught up to Rosberg and ran closely behind his teammate into the hairpin without trying to pass. <b>Hamilton</b> moved across the track during the lap in an attempt to pass; Rosberg's car shuddered, and <b>Hamilton</b> got a better run onto the pit-lane straight. He was in Rosberg's slipstream before passing him on the outside heading into the first turn to take the lead on lap 29. <b>Hamilton</b> pushed hard and pulled away from Rosberg, who lost control heading into the pit-lane straight.|$|E

5|$|During {{the early}} laps, Massa {{appeared}} to have a faster car than <b>Hamilton,</b> and repeatedly tried to pass the McLaren {{on the inside of}} turn four. His first attempt was on lap three, but <b>Hamilton</b> braked late and kept ahead of Massa into the following corner. Massa tried again at the same place on the next two laps. He passed <b>Hamilton</b> briefly into the turn on lap five, but overshot the corner and ran wide onto the grass. He dropped to fifth, behind teammate Räikkönen and BMW's Nick Heidfeld. <b>Hamilton</b> apologised after the race for 'tricking' Massa into the move. Albers, in the sole remaining Spyker, retired on lap nine with a gearbox fire.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the second}} round of pit stops, Räikkönen was five seconds ahead of <b>Hamilton,</b> but <b>Hamilton</b> began to close in on Räikkönen during the last stint {{as a result of the}} tyres better suiting his McLaren Mercedes. Heavy rain began to fall on lap41. <b>Hamilton</b> closed the gap on Räikkönen to under a second, still sixseconds ahead of Massa. <b>Hamilton</b> {{attempted}} to pass Räikkönen at the Bus Stop chicane, but he cut across the corner. Consequently, <b>Hamilton</b> led out of the chicane but allowed Räikkönen to re-pass him halfway down the straight. <b>Hamilton</b> then passed him again at the La Source hairpin under braking. Räikkönen tried to double-back on <b>Hamilton</b> to regain the position but the line was defended, resulting in Räikkönen touching his front wing on Hamilton's rear tyre. The rain started coming down more heavily and Nico Rosberg spun at Fagnes corner, rejoining in front of the two frontrunners and causing <b>Hamilton</b> to run onto the grass. At the next corner, Räikkönen spun and gave the lead back to <b>Hamilton.</b> Räikkönen then lost control of his Ferrari through the Blanchimont corner and collided with the barrier, ending his race.|$|E

5|$|<b>Hamilton</b> Street {{has served}} as the main street in Allentown since the {{community}} was founded in the 18th century. <b>Hamilton</b> Street and <b>Hamilton</b> Boulevard became part of the William Penn Highway in 1916, PA 3 in 1924, and US 22 in 1926. In 1931, US 22 was routed to a new alignment to the north, and <b>Hamilton</b> Boulevard and <b>Hamilton</b> Street west of 15th Street became a part of US 222. In the 1950s, US 222 was rerouted to bypass Allentown, leaving <b>Hamilton</b> Boulevard and <b>Hamilton</b> Street through the city unnumbered. In 1984, the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation proposed extending US 222 from I-78/PA 309 to downtown Allentown, where it would end at PA 145. The American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) rejected extending US 222 into Allentown, and PA 222 was instead designated to run between I-78/PA 309 and US 222 and PA 145 in 1991.|$|E
