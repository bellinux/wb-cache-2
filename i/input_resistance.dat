25|$|A neuron's {{ability to}} {{generate}} and propagate an action potential changes during development. How much the membrane potential of a neuron changes {{as the result of}} a current impulse is a function of the membrane <b>input</b> <b>resistance.</b> As a cell grows more channels are added to the membrane causing a decrease in <b>input</b> <b>resistance.</b> A mature neuron also undergoes shorter changes in membrane potential in response to synaptic currents. Neurons from a ferret lateral geniculate nucleus have a longer time constant and larger voltage deflection at P0 than they do at P30. One consequence of the decreasing action potential duration is that the fidelity of the signal can be preserved in response to high frequency stimulation. Immature neurons are more prone to synaptic depression than potentiation after high frequency stimulation.|$|E

40|$|Horizontal {{cells were}} enzymatically {{isolated}} from the carp retina and maintained in culture for 2 - 7 days. Cultured horizontal cells typically had resting membrane potentials of - 50 to - 70 mV and <b>input</b> <b>resistances</b> of 100 - 150 m omega. The cells were treated {{with a number of}} neurotransmitter agents and their analogues. Significant responses were evoked only by 3, 4 -dihydroxyphenylalanine (dopamine), L-glutamate, and certain glutamate analogues. The responses to dopamine were inconsistent; most often, the membrane hyperpolarized and <b>input</b> <b>resistances</b> increased. However, highly characteristic responses to L-glutamate and its analogues, quisqualate and kainate, were observed in virtually all of the cells tested. The responses consisted of an initial graded depolarization accompanied by a resistance increase, followed in most cases by a prolonged (1 - to 2 -min) regenerative depolarization. The regenerative component of the response appears to be Ca 2 + dependent, while the underlying graded potential may be due to a decrease in K+ conductance of the membrane...|$|R

25|$|A modern {{electrometer}} is {{a highly}} sensitive electronic voltmeter whose input impedance is so high that the current flowing into it can be considered, for most practical purposes, to be zero. The actual value of <b>input</b> <b>resistance</b> for modern electronic electrometers is around 1014Ω, compared to around 1010Ω for nanovoltmeters. Owing to the extremely high input impedance, special design considerations must be applied to avoid leakage current such as driven shields and special insulation materials.|$|E
25|$|Valve electrometers use a {{specialized}} vacuum tube (thermionic valve) {{with a very}} high gain (transconductance) and <b>input</b> <b>resistance.</b> The input current is allowed to flow into the high impedance grid, and the voltage so generated is vastly amplified in the anode (plate) circuit. Valves designed for electrometer use have leakage currents as low as a few femtoamperes (10−15 amperes). Such valves must be handled with gloved hands as the salts left on the glass envelope can provide leakage paths for these tiny currents.|$|E
25|$|To {{avoid the}} loading of the {{measured}} circuit {{by the current}} drawn by the meter movement, some analog multimeters use an amplifier inserted between the measured circuit and the meter movement. While this increases the expense {{and complexity of the}} meter, by use of vacuum tubes or field effect transistors the <b>input</b> <b>resistance</b> can be made very high and independent of the current required to operate the meter movement coil. Such amplified multimeters are called VTVMs (vacuum tube voltmeters), TVMs (transistor volt meters), FET-VOMs, and similar names.|$|E

25|$|Vibrating reed electrometers use a {{variable}} capacitor formed between a moving electrode (in {{the form of}} a vibrating reed) and a fixed input electrode. As the distance between the two electrodes varies, the capacitance also varies and electric charge is forced {{in and out of the}} capacitor. The alternating current signal produced by the flow of this charge is amplified and used as an analogue for the DC voltage applied to the capacitor. The DC <b>input</b> <b>resistance</b> of the electrometer is determined solely by the leakage resistance of the capacitor, and is typically extremely high, (although its AC input impedance is lower).|$|E
25|$|Most analog {{multimeters}} of the moving-pointer type are unbuffered, {{and draw}} current from the circuit under test to deflect the meter pointer. The impedance of the meter {{varies depending on}} the basic sensitivity of the meter movement and the range which is selected. For example, a meter with a typical 20,000ohms/volt sensitivity will have an <b>input</b> <b>resistance</b> of two million ohms on the 100-volt range (100 V * 20,000 ohms/volt = 2,000,000 ohms). On every range, at full scale voltage of the range, the full current required to deflect the meter movement is taken from the circuit under test. Lower sensitivity meter movements are acceptable for testing in circuits where source impedances are low compared to the meter impedance, for example, power circuits; these meters are more rugged mechanically. Some measurements in signal circuits require higher sensitivity movements {{so as not to}} load the circuit under test with the meter impedance.|$|E

Input impedances of several megohms shunted by one or two micromicrofarads are easily realized with simple circuits, and <b>input</b> <b>resistances</b> up to 100 megohms may be obtained with more elaborate circuitry. Other important properties are that input shunt capacitance can be almost completely eliminated, the voltage gain is stabilized, and the output impedance is low. Criteria for best noise performance are discussed. Typical practical measurements are given, and various illustrative circuits are shown for both a-c and d-c amplifier...|$|R
5000|$|In experiments, {{mammalian}} VOLT neurons {{were shown}} to transduce hypertonicity by the activation of the TRPV1 nonselective cation channels. These channels are highly permeable to calcium and are responsible for membrane depolarization and increased action potential discharge. Stated simply, an increase in osmolarity results in a reversible depolarization of the OVLT neurons. [...] This can be seen through the predominantly excitatory effects of ANG on the VOLT through the TRPV1 receptor. In this context, {{it is worthy to}} note the VOLT neurons typically feature a resting membrane potential in the range of -50 to -67 mV with <b>input</b> <b>resistances</b> ranging from 65 to 360 MΩ.|$|R
40|$|Electrophysiological {{studies from}} mice in vitro have {{suggested}} that octopus cells of the mammalian ventral cochlear nucleus (VCN) are anatomically and biophysically specialized for detecting the coincident firing of a population of auditory nerve fibers. Recordings from cats in vivo have shown that octopus cells fire rapidly and with exceptional temporal precision as they convey the timing of that coincidence to higher auditory centers. The current study addresses the question whether the biophysical properties of octopus cells that have until now been examined only in mice, are shared by octopus cells in cats. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings confirm that octopus cells in brain slices from kittens share the anatomical and biophysical features of octopus cells in mice. As in mice, octopus cells in kittens have large cell bodies and thick dendrites that extend in one direction. Voltage changes produced by depolarizing and hyperpolarizing current injection were small and rapid. <b>Input</b> <b>resistances</b> and membrane time constants in octopus cells of 16 -day-old kittens were 15. 8 [*]±[*] 1. 5  MΩ (n[*]=[*] 16) and 1. 28 [*]±[*] 0. 3  ms (n[*]=[*] 16), respectively. Octopus cells fired only a single action potential {{at the onset of}} a depolarizing current pulse; suprathreshold stimuli were greater than 1. 8  nA. A tetrodotoxin (TTX) -sensitive sodium conductance (gNa) was responsible for the generation of the action potentials. Octopus cells displayed outward rectification that lasted {{for the duration of the}} depolarizing pulses. Hyperpolarizations produced by the injection of current exhibited a depolarizing sag of the membrane potential toward the resting value. A 4 -aminopyridine (4 -AP) and α-dendrotoxin (α-DTX) -sensitive, low-voltage-activated potassium conductance (gKL) and a ZD 7288 -sensitive, mixed-cation conductance (gh) were partially activated at rest, giving the octopus cells low <b>input</b> <b>resistances</b> and, as a consequence, brief time constants. In 7 -day-old kittens, action potentials were taller and broader, <b>input</b> <b>resistances</b> higher, and both inward and outward rectification was weaker than in 16 -day-old kittens. Also as in mice, stellate cells of the VCN fired trains of action potentials with constant interspike intervals when they were depolarized (n[*]=[*] 10) and bushy cells of the VCN fired only a single action potential at the onset of depolarizations (n[*]=[*] 6). In conclusion, the similarity of octopus cells in mice and kittens suggests that the anatomical and biophysical specializations that allow octopus cells to detect and convey synchronous firing among auditory nerve fibers are common to all mammals...|$|R
