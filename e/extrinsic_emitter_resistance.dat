40|$|Abstract — Bipolar {{amplifiers}} can {{be biased}} {{to give a}} deep null in third order non-linearity, {{with the potential for}} high IP 3 amplifier stages. This requires maintaining a precise voltage drop across a small resistive <b>emitter</b> degeneration <b>resistance,</b> whose value is related to kT/q.

In this work the investigation of measurement accuracy is extended to multi-crystalline silicon (mc-Si) and reveals for base resistance measurements severe measurement artifacts of up to a factor 2 upon chemical standard treatments, such as damage etching and acidic texturization. The investigation identifies potential barriers at grain boundaries as reason for these artifacts which form upon chemical treatments and further increase with storage time after such chemical steps.
