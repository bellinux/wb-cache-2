30|$|In the Classification {{outlined}} below, codes {{composed of}} alphabet and number(s) {{are applied to}} each family to denote its ordinal (and superordinal) classification. For gymnosperms, Christenhusz et al. (2011)’s alphabetical (A–H) and numeric (1 – 12) codes for Orders and Families are adopted. For angiosperms, the numeric codes of APG IV families (1 – 416) are followed, {{with the addition of}} alphabetical (A–S) code for superorders and numerical (1 – 64) codes for orders modified from Chase and Reveal (2009). For example, “F 14.60. Liliaceae 百合科” indicates Superorder Lilianae (F), Order Liliales (14), and Family Liliaceae (60). Code designations of superorders and orders are outlined in Fig.  1. The numeric family codes used in the Flora of Taiwan (Boufford et al. 2003) are also listed in parentheses after the Chinese vernacular family name to aid an easy comparison to families circumscribed in FOT. For examples, “(≡ IIA. 1)” in Cycadaceae indicates Family 1 of <b>Gymnosperma</b> (IIA) in Boufford et al. (2003), “(≡ IIBa. 35)” of Nymphaeaceae denotes Family 35 of Dicotylendons (IIBa), and “(≡ IIBb. 7)” of Zosteraceae stands for Family 7 of Monocotyledons (IIBb), while the sign “≡” indicates unchanged familial circumscription between FOT and current treatment.|$|R

5000|$|In early {{classification}} schemes, the gymnosperms (<b>Gymnospermae)</b> {{were regarded}} as a [...] "natural" [...] group. There is conflicting evidence {{on the question of}} whether the living gymnosperms form a clade. The fossil record of gymnosperms includes many distinctive taxa that do not belong to the four modern groups, including seed-bearing trees that have a somewhat fern-like vegetative morphology (the so-called [...] "seed ferns" [...] or pteridosperms.) When fossil gymnosperms such as Bennettitales, Caytonia and the glossopterids are considered, it is clear that angiosperms are nested within a larger gymnosperm clade, although which group of gymnosperms is their closest relative remains unclear.|$|E
5000|$|The botanical term [...] "Angiosperm", {{from the}} Ancient Greek αγγείον, angeíon (bottle, vessel) and σπέρμα, (seed), was coined {{in the form}} Angiospermae by Paul Hermann in 1690, as {{the name of one}} of his primary {{divisions}} of the plant kingdom. This included flowering plants possessing seeds enclosed in capsules, distinguished from his <b>Gymnospermae,</b> or flowering plants with achenial or schizo-carpic fruits, the whole fruit or each of its pieces being here regarded as a seed and naked. The term and its antonym were maintained by Carl Linnaeus with the same sense, but with restricted application, in the names of the orders of his class Didynamia. Its use with any approach to its modern scope became possible only after 1827, when Robert Brown established the existence of truly naked ovules in the Cycadeae and Coniferae, and applied to them the name Gymnosperms. From that time onward, as long as these Gymnosperms were, as was usual, reckoned as dicotyledonous flowering plants, the term Angiosperm was used antithetically by botanical writers, with varying scope, as a group-name for other dicotyledonous plants.|$|E
40|$|For {{the group}} of plants treated in the “Compendium” I have used the name Spermatophyta. WETTSTEIN in his “Handbuch” remarks that this name is {{incorrect}} because in botany the word “sperma” is used for spermatozoids, and from the name Spermatophyta it might be concluded that by it “plants with spermatozoids” were meant. WETTSTEIN’s objection {{is not to be}} taken seriously however. Nobody will ever think of translating the name <b>Gymnospermae</b> by “plants with naked spermatozoids”! I did not like to use the name Phanerogamae for the group since the corresponding name “Cryptogamae” has lost all meaning. “Anthophyta” cannot be used, because the Pteridospermae have no flowers and it would even be advisable to use the term “Flower” only with regard to Angiospermae. The classic division into <b>Gymnospermae</b> and Angiospermae has been given up. The Pteridospermae are fundamentally different from the <b>Gymnospermae</b> e. g. by the form of their leaves and by the absence of a strobilus. I consider them equal in rank to the subdivision <b>Gymnospermae.</b> The same may be said of the group which formerly under the name Gnetales or Gnetinae used to be considered as a subdivision of the <b>Gymnospermae,</b> but which, in my opinion, are even farther removed from the <b>Gymnospermae</b> than the Pteridospermae. They have obtained here the rank of a new subdivision under the name Chlamydospermae.
