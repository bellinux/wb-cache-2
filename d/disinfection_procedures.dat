25|$|L. jordanis is an {{opportunistic}} pathogen. It {{has been}} shown to cause lower respiratory tract infections in humans and is responsible for causing a type of pneumonia commonly referred to as Legionnaires' disease.

40|$|Despite {{measures}} to reduce disease transmission, a risk can occur when blood glucose meters (BGMs) are used on multiple individuals or by caregivers assisting a patient. The laboratory and in-clinic {{performance of a}} BGM system before and after disinfection should be demonstrated to guarantee accurate readings and reliable control of blood glucose (BG) for patients. In this study, an effective <b>disinfection</b> <b>procedure,</b> conducting wiping 10 times to assure a one minute contact time of the disinfectant on contaminated surface, was first demonstrated using test samples of the meter housing materials, including acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA), and polycarbonate (PC), in accordance with ISO 15197 : 2013. After bench studies comprising 10, 000 disinfection cycles, the elemental compositions of the disinfected ABS, PMMA, and PC samples were almost {{the same as in}} the original samples, as indicated by electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis. Subsequently, the validated <b>disinfection</b> <b>procedure</b> was then directly applied to disinfect 5 commercial BGM systems composed of ABS, PMMA, or PC to observe the effect of the validated <b>disinfection</b> <b>procedure</b> on meter accuracy. The results of HBsAg values after treatment with HBV sera and disinfectant wipes for each material were less than the LoD of each material of 0. 020 IU/mL. Before and after the multiple disinfection cycles, 900 of 900 samples (100 %) were within the system accuracy requirements of ISO 15197 : 2013. All of the systems showed high performance before and after the series of disinfection cycles and met the ISO 15197 : 2013 requirements.

40|$|Objective 					<b>Disinfection</b> <b>procedures</b> often cause {{deterioration}} in a maxillofacial prosthesis. Color and hardness alterations {{could lead to}} a replacement of the prosthesis. 		 				Material and Methods 					An experimental chlorinated polyethylene (CPE) and a commercial polydimethyl siloxane (PDMS) sample were treated with four different <b>disinfection</b> <b>procedures</b> for a period which simulates 1 year of clinical service. The applied <b>disinfection</b> <b>procedures</b> included microwave exposure and immersion in three solutions, sodium hypochlorite, neutral soap and a commercial disinfecting soap. Shore A hardness (&# 8710;H) and color differences (&# 8710;E) were determined before and after each procedure. All data were analyzed by Two Way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and Tukey's post hoc tests at a level of &# 945;= 0. 05. 				Results 					The samples presented significant alterations in color and hardness after the different disinfection treatments. The color differences (&# 8710;E) were at least eye detectable in all cases and clinically unacceptable in most of the cases, with values ranging from 1. 51 to 4. 15 and from 1. 54 to 5. 92 for the PDMS and CPE material, respectively. Hardness was decreased after all the <b>disinfection</b> <b>procedures</b> in the PDMS, while for the CPE, a decrement was observed after disinfection with sodium hypochlorite and neutral soap and an increment after microwave exposure and the disinfection with a commercial antimicrobial agent. The PDMS samples presented greater alterations in color and hardness after disinfection with sodium hypochlorite solution, while the microwave exposure caused negligible effects. The CPE samples were affected most after disinfection when treated with neutral soap, and more slightly when disinfected with sodium hypochlorite solution. 		 		 					Conclusions 					The <b>disinfection</b> <b>procedures</b> caused alterations in color and hardness of the examined materials. The most suitable disinfection procedure for the PDMS material is microwave exposure, while disinfection with sodium hypochlorite solution is not recommended. The CPE material is suggested to be disinfected with sodium hypochlorite solution and the use of neutral soap is not recommended. Comparing the two materials, the PDMS material is most color stable, while the CPE material presented fewer changes in hardness...|$|E

40|$|A {{series of}} four field trials were {{conducted}} to evaluate {{the ability of a}} cleaning and <b>disinfection</b> <b>procedure</b> in swine lairage pens to reduce the prevalence of Salmonella enterica in slaughtered pigs. A cleaning and <b>disinfection</b> <b>procedure</b> was applied to lairage pens at a large Midwest abattoir. Each trial consisted of a cleaned (alkaline chloride detergent) and disinfected (H 2 O 2 plus peracetic acid sanitizer) pen (treated) and a control pen, each holding 90 to 95 pigs for 2 to 3 h before slaughter. Ileocecal lymph nodes, cecal contents, and rectal contents were collected from 45 pigs from each study pen at harvest and cultured for S. enterica. In all trials, cleaning and disinfection reduced the prevalence of S. enterica–positive floor swabs in the treated pen (P, 0. 05). However, the postharvest prevalence of S. enterica–positive pigs varied between trials. In trial 1, {{there was no significant difference}} in the prevalence of S. enterica in pigs between treatment and control groups. In trials 2 and 3, the prevalence of S. enterica was higher in pigs from treated pens versus pigs from control pens (91 % versus 40 %, P, 0. 0001, and 91 % versus 24 %, P, 0. 0001, respectively). In trial 4, the prevalence of S. enterica was lower in pigs from treated pens compared with pigs from control pens (5 % versus 42 %, P, 0. 0001). This study indicates that cleaning and disinfection effectively reduces the amount of culturable S. enterica in lairage pens, but the ability of cleaned and disinfected pens to reduce the prevalence of S. enterica in market-weight pigs remains inconclusive...|$|R

40|$|Aims: Devriesea agamarum {{infection}} causes chronic proliferative dermatitis, {{especially in}} desert dwelling lizards. The {{present study was}} concerned with evaluating persistency of D. agamarum in {{the environment and the}} evaluation of the efficacy of various <b>disinfection</b> <b>procedures.</b> Methods and Results: First, the survival of D. agamarum was assessed both in dermal crusts obtained from clinically and naturally infected lizards, and during periods of prolonged nutrient starvation on dry surface, in moist sand and in distilled water. Secondly, a modified European Suspension Test was performed to determine the efficacy of eight procedures for the disinfection of equipment, environmental surfaces and the topical treatment of D. agamarum-associated dermal lesions. The bacterium proved to persist and remain viable for up to 57 days in dermal crusts and for more than 5 months in moist sand and distilled water. In contrast, survival on dry surfaces was limited. The results of the described dilution-neutralization method demonstrated that most of the tested <b>disinfection</b> <b>procedures</b> were sufficient in achieving a 5 -decimal logarithmic {{reduction in the number of}} D. agamarum colony-forming units. The use of relatively low concentrations of hydrogen peroxide and a boric and peracetic acid solution on the other hand resulted in insufficient reduction in viable counts. Conclusions: Devriesea agamarum can persist for long periods of time in the environment, especially under moist conditions, making the use of suitable <b>disinfection</b> <b>procedures</b> necessary. Significance and Impact of the Study: This study demonstrates the need for a dry environment for most desert lizards and the use of effective <b>disinfection</b> <b>procedures</b> next to antimicrobial treatment to eliminate D. agamarum-associated disease from captive saurian collections...|$|E
40|$|Controlled {{parallel}} {{experiments were}} performed on the Vienna test model {{for the evaluation of}} procedures for hygienic hand-disinfection in three laboratories (Vienna, Mainz, Birmingham). The degerming activity of four procedures, each taking 1 min, was assessed repeatedly and compared with that of a standard <b>disinfection</b> <b>procedure</b> (ST) using isopropanol 60 % (v/v). The mean log reductions (mean log RF) for each procedure were as follows: n-propanol 50 % (v/v) 4. 85 and 5. 14 in Vienna (V) and Mainz (M) respectively, ethanol 70 % (v/v) + chlorhexidine-gluconate 0. 5 % (w/v), 4. 01 (V), 3. 76 (M) and 4. 00 in Birmingham (B). Washing procedures were less effective, mean log RF's of 3. 19 (V), 3. 49 (M) and 3. 04 (B) were obtained with povidone-iodine soap, and 2. 91 (V), 3. 37 (M) and 3. 27 (B) with a liquid phenolic soap. Analysis of variance on the data from Vienna and Mainz revealed significant differences of means not only between procedures ('preparations') but also on repeat testing. To compensate for the influence of variables such as test subjects, laboratory and day, the Vienna test model provides a method of standardization by testing a ST in parallel with the test procedure (P). Standardization of the results was obtained by pair-wise substraction, log RFPi-log RFSTi. Analysis of variance on the resulting values demonstrated that comparability of the results between laboratories and on repeat testing was achieved. The relative variation of the measurements within the laboratories ranged from 0. 9 to 4. 2 %.

30|$|One of the {{in vitro}} culture’s main goals is to obtain sterile explants for growth and {{development}} into a complete plant. A crucial requirement {{for the success of}} in vitro conservation is the development of efficient protocols for micropropagation. Several studies have been carried out for micropropagation of grapevine species, such as culture from shoot apices (Barlass and Skene 1978; Fanizza et al. 1984; Goussard 1981; Monette 1983; Morini et al. 1985) and axillary buds (Gribaudo and Fronda 1991; Jona and Webb 1978), mainly from plants grown in a greenhouse. However, a good challenge is still the utilization of tissues from field-grown plants. This is mainly {{due to the fact that}} the same disinfection techniques cannot be utilized for all species, cultivars, and tissue explants because there are differences in their susceptibility to different compounds and concentrations of disinfection solutions (Mihaljević et al. 2013).

Therefore, we evaluated five different RNA extraction kits using biofilms of the foodborne pathogens Listeria monocytoge-nes, Escherichia coli, and Salmonella enterica. The five kits yielded RNA with different quantities and qualities. While for E. coli the variability of RNA quality did not affect the quantification of mRNA, the same was not true for L. monocytogenes or S. enterica. Therefore, our results indicate that not all kits are suitable for RNA extraction from bacterial biofilms, and thus, the selection of RNA extraction kit is crucial to obtain accurate and meaningful mRNA quantification...|$|R
