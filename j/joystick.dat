5|$|The game's {{control scheme}} uses a two-way <b>joystick</b> and five buttons. Jarvis {{designed}} the controls to emulate both Space Invaders and Asteroids simultaneously. The player's left hand manipulates the <b>joystick</b> similar to Space Invaders {{and the right}} hand pushes buttons similar to Asteroids. The button functions also use a similar layout to Asteroids, with the button to shoot projectiles and accelerate {{on the far right}} and left, respectively. Jarvis reasoned that players were accustomed to the control schemes of past games, and felt altering past designs would prove difficult for them.|$|E

The <b>joystick</b> controls the horizontal direction that the knight travels, while pressing the button makes the ostrich flap its wings. The rate at which the player repeatedly presses the button causes the ostrich to fly upward, hover, or slowly descend. The objective is to defeat groups of enemy knights riding buzzards that populate each level, referred to as a wave. Upon completing a wave, a more challenging one will begin.|$|E

5|$|The arcade {{release of}} Cross Generation of Heroes has a control scheme {{consisting}} of a <b>joystick</b> and four buttons. Wii versions of Tatsunoko vs. Capcom have five control options: the Classic Controller, Nintendo GameCube controller, third-party arcade sticks, and two simplified control schemes—intended for inexperienced players—for the Wii Remote. Players use controller inputs to perform attacks; the most basic attacks are executed by pressing one of three attack buttons: light, medium, or strong. Players may augment basic attacks with <b>joystick</b> or control pad directional inputs; for example, a standard strong attack can become a sweep when the down input is added. Basic attacks can be strung together to perform combos.|$|E
50|$|By {{the mid-1990s}} the mouse {{had become a}} {{universal}} peripheral, and games used it as the primary controller where <b>joysticks</b> would have been used previously. <b>Joysticks</b> became used only for specific roles, typically flight simulators, and the Atari port disappeared from computers during this era.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} {{the influence of}} the location of vibrotactile stimulation in triggering the response made using two handheld <b>joysticks.</b> In particular, we compare performance with stimuli delivered either using tactors placed on the palm or {{on the back of the}} hand and with attractive (move toward the vibration) or repulsive prompts (move away from the vibration). The experimental setup comprised two <b>joysticks</b> and two gloves, each equipped with four pager motors along the cardinal directions. In different blocks, fifty-three volunteers were asked to move the <b>joysticks</b> as fast as possible either towards or away with respect to the direction specified by a set of vibrating motors. Results indicate that participants performed better with attractive prompts (i. e. responses were faster and with fewer errors in conditions where participants were asked to move the <b>joysticks</b> in the direction of the felt vibration) and that the stimulation delivered on the back of the hand from the gloves gives better results than the stimulation on the palm delivered by the <b>joysticks...</b>|$|R

5|$|The early Spectrum models' {{great success}} as a games {{platform}} came {{in spite of its}} lack of built-in <b>joystick</b> ports, primitive sound generation, and colour support that was optimised for text display: the hardware limitations of the platform required a particular level of creativity from video game designers.|$|E

50|$|Specialist <b>joysticks,</b> classed as an assistive {{technology}} pointing device, {{are used to}} replace the computer mouse for people with fairly severe physical disabilities. Rather than controlling games, these <b>joysticks</b> control the pointer. They are often useful to people with athetoid conditions, such as cerebral palsy, who find them easier to grasp than a standard mouse. Miniature <b>joysticks</b> are available for people with conditions involving muscular weakness such as muscular dystrophy or motor neurone disease as well. They are also used on electric powered wheelchairs for control since they are simple and effective {{to use as a}} control method.|$|R
