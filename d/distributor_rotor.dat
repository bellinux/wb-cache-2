5000|$|The <b>distributor</b> <b>rotor</b> {{connects the}} high voltage {{to one of}} the outer {{terminals}} around the cap where a spark plug wire carries it to a spark plug. When the voltage is high enough it jumps the gap of the spark plug and ignites the fuel air mixture in the cylinder's combustion chamber ...|$|E
5000|$|The Dukes spot two [...] "Double Zeros" [...] on {{the side}} of the road and pull over. Buzz tells the Dukes that he and Kam have been racing Kam's car with an illegal engine and that he was {{supposed}} to finish the race in Buzz's car, but now it will not start, after Buzz secretly removed the engine's <b>distributor</b> <b>rotor.</b> Kam flees the county before authorities discover he cheated in the race, while Buzz and the Dukes agree to finish the race fairly. The Dukes win, and Luke then pulls Ryker out of the trunk and tells Rosco he kidnapped Daisy on Maxx's orders so they would lose the race. Rosco tells Mama Maxx how stupid he believes she is, stating that he conned her into building the theme park. Rosco had obtained a sample of gallium arsenide ore and put it in the swamp so Maxx would find it. He also reveals that the FBI sent him a list of the country's ten most wanted real estate con artists, with Maxx at number one. Rosco reveals that his plan was inspired by a quote in Boss Hogg's memoir that offered advice regarding con artists.|$|E
25|$|The {{primary winding}} is {{connected}} to the battery (usually through a current-limiting ballast resistor). Inside the ignition coil one end of each winding {{is connected to}}gether. This common point is taken to the capacitor/contact breaker junction. The other, high voltage, end of the secondary {{is connected to the}} <b>distributor's</b> <b>rotor.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{ignition}} coil {{consists of two}} transformer windings — the primary and secondary. These windings share a common magnetic core. An alternating current in the primary induces an alternating magnetic field in the core and hence an alternating current in the secondary. The {{ignition coil}}'s secondary has more turns than the primary. This is a step-up transformer, which produces a high voltage from the secondary winding.The primary winding {{is connected to the}} battery (usually through a current-limiting ballast resistor). Inside the ignition coil one end of each winding is connected together. This common point is taken to the capacitor/contact breaker junction.

500|$|The tank {{broke down}} twice. The <b>distributor's</b> <b>rotor</b> arm broke and a {{replacement}} {{had to be}} sourced from Madrid. Then two of the device's valves used to cool the oil exploded, due to solder melting and mixing with the oil. It was very hot in the tank, despite the installation of ten fans, {{and the lack of}} suspension meant the driver was unable to stop shaking during filming breaks. The tank only moved at , which Vic Armstrong said made it difficult to film Indiana riding a horse against the tank while making it appear faster. A smaller section of the tank's top made from aluminum and which used rubber tracks was used for close-ups. It was built from a searchlight trailer, weighed eight tons, and was towed by a four-wheel drive truck. It had safety nets on each end to prevent injury to those falling off. A quarter-scale model by Gibbs was driven over a [...] cliff on location; Industrial Light & Magic created further shots of the tank's destruction with models and miniatures.|$|R
40|$|Operational {{efficiency}} of multi-functional road construction machines depends on number of working bodies which are simultaneously performing technological operations. Systems for propulsion pto to the running equipment drive and active working bodies of road construction machines are developing {{in the way}} of using three-axis hydraulic drives. When designing a hydraulic system for road construction machinery dividing of power flow from propulsion to the running equipment drive and active working bodies is considered as rather essential problem. Leading companies do not pay attention to the development of flow divider designs, preferring to produce more expensive multi-flow pumps. One of the ways to increase {{efficiency of}} multi-functional road construction machinery is an implementation of running equipment hydraulic driving system based on a mono-aggregate pump unit which consists of a pump and a volumetric divider of power fluid flow. A principle of volumetric division and summing-up of power fluid flows, technical realization and methodology for calculation of key parameters of discrete flow distributors has been developed on the basis of discrete hydraulics regulations. The paper presents results of mathematical modeling of hydraulic systems equipped with the discrete flow distributor. Analysis of a dual-motor hydraulic drive operation has shown the following results: a discrete flow distributor ensures independent load mode of the current consumer circuit operation from the load mode of the second consumer circuit within a wide range of loads; rational value of working fluid flow discretization parameter is the following value interval  k  = 4 – 6, maximum value of parameter efficiency is reached when an angular velocity of a <b>distributor</b> <b>rotor</b> coincides with the angular velocity of a pump shaft; discrete flow distributor provides a possibility to change parameters of hydraulic flow feeding in consumers’ pressure lines within a wide range due to changes in geometrical parameters of the design; discrete flow distributor should be installed either close to the pump or be integrated into its design. The developed mathematical model and methodology for determination of parameters for the discrete flow distributor allow to optimize its design. Application of the mono-aggregate pump unit which consists of a pump and a discrete flow distributor of running equipment drive in multi-functional road construction machinery permits to decrease a number of hydraulic drive pumps, to withdraw from large-sized and material-intensive pump drive gear box. </p...|$|E
50|$|K16 models used MEMS, with a 1.6 ECU from 1990 until 1994 and a 1.9 ECU from 1995 onwards, {{in either}} Single Point or Multi Point forms, {{with a single}} coil {{on the back of}} the engine block and a <b>distributor</b> cap and <b>rotor</b> arm on the end of the inlet camshaft. MEMS 2J was used on the VVC engine, to control the Variable Valve Control and the distributorless {{ignition}} system, which was used because there were camshaft drive belts at both ends of the engine. With the launch of the Rover 25 and Rover 45 in 1999, MEMS 3 was introduced, with twin coils and sequential injection.|$|R
2500|$|ALL New LS1 Aluminum Engine (Gen IV small block); it {{featured}} individual coil packs {{instead of a}} <b>distributor</b> cap and <b>rotor,</b> aluminum block and pistons, a very deep skirt design for increased durability, and many other technical and manufacturing innovations. [...] The LS1/LS6 are the progenitor for the entire C6 & C7 engine lineup, with the LS2, LS3, LS7, LS9, being primarily increased displacement and supercharged versions of the LS1/LS6. [...] Even the LT engines are still primarily increased displacement LS1's/LS6's but with modern, improved technologies of Direct Injection and Cylinder Deactivation for improved fuel economy for their larger displacement [...] "thirstiness". [...] This third-generation small block V8's complete redesign also featured a new cylinder firing order to improve idle and rev smoothness. It was initially rated at [...] and , but was increased to [...] in the 2001 edition. The new engine, combined with the new body and its low 0.29 drag coefficient, was able to achieve up to 28 mpg on the highway.|$|R
5000|$|One {{problem with}} this design is that, even with a {{properly}} sized capacitor, {{there will be some}} arcing at the points. Arcing causes the points to [...] "burn." [...] This in turn introduces resistance at the point contacts that reduces primary current and resulting spark intensity. A second problem involves the mechanical cam-follower block that rides on the distributor cam and opens the points. The block wears over time, reducing how much the points open (the [...] "point gap") and causing a corresponding change in both the ignition timing and the fraction of time during which the points are closed. Tune-ups for older vehicles usually involve replacing the points and condenser and setting the gap to factory specifications. A third problem involves the <b>distributor</b> cap and <b>rotor.</b> These components can develop conductive [...] "sneak paths" [...] on their surfaces (also called 'tracking') across which the coil's secondary voltage produces a current, often {{in the form of an}} arc, that bypasses the spark plug. When sneak paths develop, the only remedy is replacement of the cap and/or rotor. A fourth problem can arise when one or more of an engine's spark plugs becomes [...] "fouled." [...] Fouling, caused by combustion-byproducts that form deposits on a spark plug's internal insulator, creates an electrically conductive path that dissipates the coil's energy before its secondary voltage can rise high enough to produce a spark. So-called capacitive discharge ignition systems create coil voltages with much shorter rise times and can produce a spark across spark plugs with some fouling.|$|R
