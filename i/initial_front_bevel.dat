40|$|The {{whole process}} of mesh {{generation}} is presented in detail. Advancing front technique (AFT) is pro-posed for 3 D tetrahedral mesh generation [1]. AFT starts from <b>initial</b> <b>front.</b> <b>Initial</b> <b>front</b> is a boundary surface conformal triangulation. On each step a new tetrahedron is constructed and the front is updated. At this point local mesh size could be selected automatically {{in order to create}} quasi-uniform mesh, or mesh coarsened to the interior of the region. Local mesh size could also be controlled by the user explicitly. AFT method has some issues in 3 D case. There are such front configurations in which new tetrahe-dron can not be created. Another Delaunay-based mesh generation technique is used in this case [2]. This method consists of Delaunay mesh generation followed by boundary faces restoration. This ap-proach allows us to generate tetrahedral meshes starting from <b>initial</b> <b>front</b> fully automatically and still in controlled way. <b>Initial</b> <b>front</b> could be constructed in several ways. Four approaches will be discussed in detail. 1. Analytical boundary parametrisation based on boundary representation (BREP) model. 2. Interface with CAD systems based on the same BREP model. 3. Initial surface mesh refinement. 4. Surface meshing of solid constructive geometry (SCG) models. Each of these approaches is more suitable for particular cases. For example analytical boundary parametrisation method is more convenient for simple regions like spheres, boxes, and other poly-hedrons with planar faces. Complex regions like union of several simple primitives could be processed with solid constructive geometry approach. More complex regions designed in CAD systems could be meshed with the help of interface between CAD and AFT mesh generator. Regions could also be defined by their boundary discretization. Latter may have a bad shape surface triangulation, and thus surface mesh refinement process might be very useful. Several examples will be presented introducing mesh generation library from Ani 3 D project [3]...|$|R

50|$|Single bevel knives are knives {{made in the}} Japanese {{tradition}} and have an omote (front or face on the right for right-handers), a shinogi (where the <b>front</b> <b>bevel</b> meets the flat of the blade face), and a urasuki (backside hollow to release food). These knives are usually a little thicker at the spine and body than Japanese double bevels but are thinner right behind the edge. They leave a better surface finish but the produce must bend a further distance due to the thickness. These are the knives of the established traditional Japanese cuisine and were originally developed from double bevel knives from China. They are sharpened along the single bevel by applying pressure to the shinogi to raise it and to the edge. Honbadzuke is the initial sharpening to form a flat surface along {{the perimeter of the}} urasuki to strengthen it, straighten the backside, and lay geometry for future sharpening. The omote is sharpened much more than the urasuki {{in order to maintain the}} function of the single bevel. Kansai style knives usually have pointed tip for use standing up (which helps in decorative tip work) and Edo style knives have a square tip for use sitting down (which makes a more robust working knife). The standard Japanese knife kit includes the yanagiba, deba, and usuba. They are essential to Washoku (Japanese cuisine).|$|R

30|$|In contrast, the {{moisture}} response to precipitation at deeper layers (Fig. 5 (b)–(f)) has greater attenuation and shows a larger lag because of soil moisture diffusion (Eq. (5)). For example, the estimated soil moisture increase from April to May 2010 is attenuated by a half at depths between 25 – 30 cm {{and by a}} quarter between 95 – 100 cm, {{and the time of}} the first moisture peak is delayed by 1.3 and 6.5 days, respectively. On occasion, a number of precipitation events concatenate into one moisture peak, as seen in April 2009, July 2009 and July 2010. Thus, non-linear characteristics in soil water equations can be seen; the proceeding infiltration fronts draw level with the <b>initial</b> <b>front,</b> since the <b>initial</b> infiltration increases soil moisture, θ; permeability, K(θ) (Eq. (14)), and diffusivity, D(θ) (Eq. (15)); and soil moisture speed, |υ| (Eq. (4)), in sequence (figure 2.17 after Nakano, 1991).|$|R

40|$|The {{advancing}} front {{technique is}} being used to develop a code to generate grids around complex 3 -D configurations for use in computing the invisid flow solutions by the Euler equations. By the advancing front technique points are introduced concurrently with the connectivity information so that a separate library is not required. The generation of a 3 -D grid is accomplished in several steps. First the boundaries of the domain to be gridded must be described by two-, three- or four-sided surface patches. Next, a background mesh is required to control the grid spacing and stretching throughout the domain. This coarse tetrahedral grid is not required to conform to any of the boundaries. Next, each of the patches is mapped to 2 -D, triangulated by the advancing front technique and mapped back to 3 -D. These triangles form the <b>initial</b> <b>front</b> for the generation of the final tetrahedral mesh...|$|R
