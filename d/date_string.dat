5000|$|A {{challenge}} requiring reading {{natural language}} {{instructions on how}} to reply, with the inclusion of a special string or pass-code in the reply. For example, converting a <b>date</b> <b>string</b> (such as 'Thu Jan 12 08:45:44 2012') into its corresponding timestamp (1326379544). Other Turing Test approaches include a simple problem, or answering a simple question about the text or the recipient.|$|E
5000|$|The {{following}} is a sample of CL programming. The program interactively converts dates from Julian to MDY and vice versa. Results are displayed on line 24 of the terminal. It accepts two parameters. The &IN parameter which is the <b>date</b> <b>string</b> to be converted. If a Julian string {{it should be in}} the format YYNNN where YY is the year number and NNN is the day number of the year. If a MDY string it must be in the format MMDDYY. The second parameter is &TYP which is the type of date to be converted to. It must be 'J' (Julian) or 'M' (MDY). For example: the command CALL PGM(ICVTDATC) PARM('04180' 'M') will convert the Julian date 04180 to 062804 (June 28, 2004).|$|E

40|$|The highly conserved {{regulatory}} {{mechanisms that}} control progression {{of a cell}} through the cell cycle do not, alone, explain the programmed control of cell proliferation during animal development. Additional controls must coordinate the cell cycle regulators with developmental regulatory events. Here we report studies of cell cycle control in the imaginal tissues of Drosophila melanogaster, specifically in situations where cell cycle progression is regulated by varying {{the length of the}} G 2 phase. We show that G 2 -phase arrest in late larval wing imaginal disks requires transcriptional control of stg, a mitotic inducer that encodes a D. melanogaster homologue of the Schizosaccharomyces pombe p 80 cdc 25 phosphatase. In a second study, string transcriptional regulation was also shown to be important for G 2 -phase regulation in eye disk cells posterior to the morphogenetic furrow. Finally, unlike all other situations described to <b>date,</b> <b>string</b> transcriptional regulation was found not to be the cause of G 2 arrest in abdominal histoblasts, these cells being refractory to ectopic expression of stg. This study further establishes string as an important regulator of G 2 phase during D. melanogaster development, but also reveals that at least one additional mechanism is utilized to control G 2 -phase length and thus cell proliferation in different developmental contexts...|$|E

However, it is not required. Trailing fields other than the year are also optional. The default value for day and month is 1; all other numerical fields default to 0. If no GMT information is specified, the relationship of the specified time to GMT is considered unknown.

40|$|International audienceDynamic {{taxonomies}} {{have been}} proposed as a solution for combining querying and navigation, offering both expressivity and interactivity. Navigation {{is based on the}} filtering of a multidimensional taxonomy w. r. t. query answers, which helps users to focus their search. We show that properties that are commonly used only in queries can be integrated in taxonomies, and hence in navigation, by the use of so-called logics. Hand-designed taxonomies and concrete domains (e. g., <b>dates,</b> <b>strings)</b> can be combined so as to form complex taxonomies. For instance, valued attributes can be handled, and different roles between documents and locations can be distinguished.

40|$|The Virtual International Authority File (OCLC Online Computer Library Center 2013) [URL] {{is built}} {{from dozens of}} {{authority}} files with {{tens of millions of}} names in more than 150 million authority and bibliographic records expressed in multiple languages, scripts and formats. One of the main tasks in VIAF is to bring together personal names which may have various dates associated with them, such as birth, death or when they were active. These dates can be quite complicated with ranges, approximations, BCE dates, different scripts, and even different calendars. Analysis of the nearly 400, 000 unique <b>date</b> <b>strings</b> in VIAF led us to a parsing technique that relies on only a few basic patterns for them. Our goal is to correctly interpret at least 99 % of all the dates we find in each of VIAF’s authority files and to use the dates to facilitate matches between authority records.

50|$|InfinityDB can be {{accessed}} as an extended standard java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentNavigableMap, or via a low-level 'ItemSpace' API. The ConcurrentNavigableMap interface is a subinterface of java.util.Map but has special ordering and concurrency methods: {{this is the same}} API as java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentSkipListMap. Maps may be nested to form complex structures. The Maps have the standard semantics, but work internally on a 'tuple space', while the Maps are not actually stored but are helpers, each representing nothing more than an immutable tuple prefix. Maps may be created dynamically at high speed if needed for access, and are thread-safe and multi-core concurrent. The key and value types available include all Java primitive data types, <b>Dates,</b> <b>Strings,</b> small char or byte arrays, 'ByteStrings', 'huge array' indexes, Character Long Objects or Binary Long Objects, plus the special-purpose types 'EntityClass' and 'Attribute'. Maps may be multi-valued.
