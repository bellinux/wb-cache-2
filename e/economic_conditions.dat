5|$|According to Faustus of Byzantium, {{the cathedral}} {{and the city}} of Vagharshapat were almost {{completely}} destroyed during the invasion of Persian King Shapur II in the 360s (circa 363). Due to Armenia's bad <b>economic</b> <b>conditions,</b> the cathedral was renovated by Catholicoi Nerses the Great (r. 353–373) and Sahak Parthev (r. 387–439) only urgently and partially.|$|E

40|$|This paper uses {{individual}} level data (the Japanese General Social Surveys 2000 - 2003) {{to examine how}} socio-economic status influences own and spouse’s earnings. After controlling for own and spouse’s characteristics such as human capital and age, I found: (1) childhood <b>economic</b> <b>condition</b> considered as socio-economic status is not associated with own income {{for both males and}} females. (2) The better a female’s childhood <b>economic</b> <b>condition</b> was, the higher her husband’s income. On the other hand, a male’s childhood <b>economic</b> <b>condition</b> was not related to his wife’s income. This suggests that social stratification persists through marriage for females but not for males. ...|$|R

5|$|Gaza was {{occupied}} by Israel during the 1967 Six-Day War following {{the defeat of the}} Egyptian Army. Frequent conflicts have erupted between Palestinians and the Israeli authorities in the city since the 1970s. The tensions led to the First Intifada in 1987. Gaza was a center of confrontation during this uprising, and <b>economic</b> <b>conditions</b> in the city worsened.|$|E
5|$|The {{architecture}} of Norway has evolved {{in response to}} changing <b>economic</b> <b>conditions,</b> technological advances, demographic fluctuations and cultural shifts. While outside architectural influences are apparent in much of Norwegian architecture, they have often been adapted to meet Norwegian climatic conditions, including: harsh winters, high winds and, in coastal areas, salt spray.|$|E

5|$|After Ranga Rao died in 1801, {{there were}} efforts to merge Bobbili with Vizianagaram {{but these were}} thwarted and a lasting {{settlement}} of the property was made with the adopted son of Ranga Rao. Rayadappa and his son Svetachalapti who succeeded in 1830 and lived till 1862 managed their property very well. In {{the middle of the}} 19th century, successors of this lineage constructed the present Bobbili Fort, following their improved <b>economic</b> <b>conditions.</b>|$|E
5|$|After the organization's establishment, Alpha Kappa Alpha {{has helped}} to improve social and <b>economic</b> <b>conditions</b> through {{community}} service programs. Members have improved education through independent initiatives, contributed to community-building by creating programs and associations, such as the Mississippi Health Clinic, and influenced federal legislation by Congressional lobbying through the National Non-Partisan Lobby on Civil and Democratic Rights. The sorority works with communities through service initiatives and progressive programs relating to education, family, health, and business.|$|E
5|$|Alternatively, Suzanne Bergeron, for example, raises {{examples}} {{of studies that}} illustrate the multifaceted effects of globalization on women, including Kumudhini Rosa's study of Sri Lankan, Malaysian, and Philippine, workers in free trade zones {{as an example of}} local resistance to globalization. Women there use their wages to create women's centers aimed at providing legal and medical services, libraries and cooperative housing, to local community members. Such efforts, Bergeron highlights, allow women the chance to take control of <b>economic</b> <b>conditions,</b> increase their sense of individualism, and alter the pace and direction of globalization itself.|$|E

5|$|An {{economic}} crisis took {{effect in the}} mid-1980s to late 1990s {{as a result of}} international <b>economic</b> <b>conditions,</b> drought, falling petroleum prices, and years of corruption, mismanagement, and cronyism. Cameroon turned to foreign aid, cut government spending, and privatised industries. With the reintroduction of multi-party politics in December 1990, the former British Southern Cameroons pressure groups called for greater autonomy, and the Southern Cameroons National Council advocated complete secession as the Republic of Ambazonia.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the poor <b>economic</b> <b>conditions,</b> Eurostar {{received}} state aid in May 2009 to cancel out some of the accumulated debt from the High Speed 1 construction programme. Later that year, during snowy conditions in the run-up to Christmas, thousands of passengers were left stranded as several trains broke down and many more were cancelled. In an independent review commissioned by Eurostar, the company came in for serious criticism about its handling of the incident and lack of plans for such a scenario.|$|E

In 1932, Argentina required immigrants to have a labour contract prior to arrival, or proof of financial means of support. The Roca-Runciman Treaty of 1933 gave Argentina a quota of the British market for exports of its primary products, but the discriminatory British imperial tariffs {{and the effects of}} deflation in Britain actually led to a small decline of Argentine exports to Great Britain.|$|E
5|$|In December 2008, Paul Krugman {{released}} his book The Return of Depression Economics and the Crisis of 2008, arguing that <b>economic</b> <b>conditions</b> {{similar to what}} existed during the earlier part of the 20th century had returned, making Keynesian policy prescriptions more relevant than ever. In February 2009 Robert J. Shiller and George Akerlof published , a book where they argue the current US stimulus package is too small as {{it does not take}} into account Keynes's insight on the importance of confidence and expectations in determining the future behaviour of businesspeople and other economic agents.|$|E

As a representative of the Committee on Public Information, he spent most of the year in Italy and won the praise of President Wilson. He also received the decoration of Grand Officer of the Italian Crown from King Victor Emmanuel III of Italy.|$|E

5|$|The Great Southern {{companies}} attracted {{debate and}} criticism {{associated with the}} operation of managed investment schemes generally, and the environmental performance of their Tiwi Islands operation in particular. On 16 May 2009, {{as a result of}} worsening <b>economic</b> <b>conditions</b> and regulatory issues, the GSL, GSMAL, GSF and other subsidiaries of GSL entered into voluntary administration. Ferrier Hodgson was assigned as liquidator of Great Southern Group. The collapse of Great Southern Group, in conjunction with the failure of another high-profile agribusiness company, Timbercorp, led to three separate Australian parliamentary committee inquiries into the MIS industry.|$|E

5|$|The {{end of the}} Napoleonic Wars in 1815 had {{resulted}} in periods of famine and chronic unemployment, exacerbated {{by the introduction of}} the first of the Corn Laws.

In response, the Manchester Patriotic Union, a group agitating for parliamentary reform, organised a demonstration to be addressed by the well-known radical orator Henry Hunt.|$|E
