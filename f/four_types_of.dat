5|$|The <b>four</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> flower parts, namely carpels, stamens, petals, and sepals, are {{homologous}} {{with and}} derived from leaves, as Goethe correctly noted in 1790. The {{development of these}} parts through a pattern of gene expression in the growing zones (meristems) is described by the ABC model of flower development. Each of the <b>four</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> flower parts is serially repeated in concentric whorls, controlled by {{a small number of}} genes acting in various combinations. Thus, A genes working alone result in sepal formation; A and B together produce petals; B and C together create stamens; C alone produces carpels. When none of the genes are active, leaves are formed. Two more groups of genes, D to form ovules and E for the floral whorls, complete the model. The genes are evidently ancient, as old as the flowering plants themselves.|$|E
5|$|The vast {{majority}} of living organisms encode their genes in long strands of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid). DNA consists of a chain made from <b>four</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> nucleotide subunits, each composed of: a five-carbon sugar (2'-deoxyribose), a phosphate group, {{and one of the}} four bases adenine, cytosine, guanine, and thymine.|$|E

5|$|A few species release fertilized {{eggs into}} the water, but most retain the eggs until they hatch. There are <b>four</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> larvae, but all are balls of cells with an outer layer of cells whose flagellae or cilia enable the larvae to move. After {{swimming}} {{for a few}} days the larvae sink and crawl until they find a place to settle. Most of the cells transform into archeocytes and then into the types appropriate for their locations in a miniature adult sponge.|$|E
5|$|Bhikshuka Upanishad {{consists}} of a single chapter of five verses. The first verse states that <b>four</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> mendicants seek liberation, and these are Kutichaka, Bahudaka, Hamsa and Paramahamsa. The text describes the frugal lifestyle of all four, and asserts that they all pursue their goal of attaining moksha only through yoga practice. The first three mendicant types are mentioned briefly, {{while the majority of}} the text describes the fourth type: Paramahamsa mendicants.|$|E

Some midshipmen {{were older}} men, and while most were officer candidates {{who failed to}} pass the lieutenant examination or were passed over for promotion, {{some members of the}} original rating served, as late as 1822, alongside apprentice officers without themselves aspiring to a commission. By 1794, all midshipmen were considered officer candidates, and the original rating was phased out.|$|E
5|$|Croatia can be {{subdivided}} {{between a}} number of ecoregions because of its climate and geomorphology. The country is consequently {{one of the richest}} in Europe in terms of biodiversity. There are <b>four</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> biogeographical regions in Croatia—Mediterranean along the coast and in its immediate hinterland, Alpine in most of Lika and Gorski Kotar, Pannonian along Drava and Danube, and continental in the remaining areas. One of the most significant are karst habitats which include submerged karst, such as Zrmanja and Krka canyons and tufa barriers, as well as underground habitats.|$|E

5|$|The two {{strands of}} DNA run in {{opposite}} directions {{to each other and}} are thus antiparallel. Attached to each sugar is one of <b>four</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> nucleobases (informally, bases).
