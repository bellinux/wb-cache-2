50|$|A <b>graduated</b> <b>pipette</b> {{commonly}} used in medical technology with serologic pipettes for volumetric analysis. Invented by Donald Dexter Van Slyke.|$|E
50|$|A Mohr pipette, {{also known}} as a <b>graduated</b> <b>pipette,</b> is a type of pipette used to measure the volume of the liquid dispensed, {{although}} not as accurately as a volumetric pipette. These use a series of marked lines (as on a graduated cylinder) to indicate the different volumes. They {{come in a variety of}} sizes, and are used much like a burette, in that the volume is found by calculating the difference of the liquid level before and after.|$|E
5000|$|Micropipettes {{can take}} a minimum volume of 0.2 µL and maximum volume of 10,000 µL (10 mL). [...] They thus are used for smaller-scale {{transfers}} than equipment such as <b>graduated</b> <b>pipettes,</b> which come in 5, 10, 25 and 50 mL volumes.|$|R
5000|$|Glass {{pipettes}} {{are classified}} as genre, class, and dimension at a specific <b>graduated</b> <b>pipettes,</b> which considered as the excellent specification standard. There are two genres called genre 1 and genre 2 characterized as “Standard taper tip” and “long taper tip” respectively. The class of the specification standard consists of two class called class A and class B. The signification of the class A in the <b>graduated</b> <b>pipettes</b> approves for the applicable designation and precision criteria. The marking of class B specify for the general contemplate as class A. Volumetric capacities for Class B pipettes necessitate for at least twice of the identification scope allowed for Class A pipets. The class specification or serial number in class B is not marked.|$|R
50|$|<b>Graduated</b> <b>pipettes</b> are {{classified}} into three types: Type 1, Type 2, and Type 3. Type 1 and Type 3 pipettes have the nominal value {{at the bottom}} (Zero at the top). For Type 1, the solution is delivered partially for all volume. For type 3, the solution is delivered totally only at the nominal value. Type 2 pipettes have the nominal value at the top (Zero at the bottom) and the solution is delivered totally for any volume.|$|R
50|$|The {{recommendation}} for using pipette is {{near to the}} desired volume. Before utilizing pipette, rinsing is required to prevent error. The standard technique for handling a <b>graduated</b> <b>pipette</b> is to hold the pipette in the solution without touching {{the bottom of the}} beaker. Then use a propipetter, a pipette bulb or rubber bulb, to draw the liquid into the pipette. The effective way to control the volume of the solution is to use a forefinger. After getting the desired volume, the solution can be released into another vessel by lifting the finger. During pipetting, the pipette must not divert from its upright position.|$|E
5000|$|The minim was {{introduced}} in the 1809 edition of The pharmacopœia of the Royal College of Physicians of London as a replacement for the drop, which had previously been the smallest unit of the apothecaries' system. It was observed that the size of a drop can vary considerably depending upon the viscosity and specific gravity of the liquid. (At the time, the phenomenon of surface tension was not well understood.) The minim, on the other hand, was measured with a graduated glass tube known as a [...] "minimometer" [...] later known as the minim-tube. The minim-tube was a type of <b>graduated</b> <b>pipette,</b> a device invented in 1791 by Francois Antoine Henri Descroizilles.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the first}} decade of the 19th century, the minim, the {{smallest}} unit of Apothecary Measure, was promoted by the pharmaceutical and medical establishments as an alternative to the drop. It was noted that the size of a drop can vary considerably depending on the viscosity and specific gravity of the fluid, as well as the size and shape of the vessel from which it is poured. (At the time, surface tension was not well understood.) The minim came with a set of procedures for ensuring accurate measurement, specifically, diluting powerful medicines that had previously been measured by the drop, then using a [...] "minimometer" [...] or [...] "minim glass" [...] (<b>graduated</b> <b>pipette)</b> with minim marks at regular intervals. The minim was defined as one 60th of a fluid dram or one 480th of a fluid ounce. This is equal to about 61.6 μL (U.S.) or 59.2 μL (Britain).|$|E
5000|$|<b>Graduated</b> <b>pipettes</b> are {{a type of}} macropipette {{consisting}} of a long tube {{with a series of}} graduations, as on a graduated cylinder or burette, to indicate different calibrated volumes. They also require a source of vacuum; {{in the early days of}} chemistry and biology, the mouth was used. The safety regulations included the statement: [...] "Never pipette by mouth KCN, NH3, strong acids, bases and mercury salts". Some pipettes were manufactured with two bubbles between the mouth piece and the solution level line, to protect the chemist from accidental swallowing of the solution.|$|R
50|$|Pipetting {{syringes}} are hand-held {{devices that}} combine {{the functions of}} volumetric (bulb) <b>pipettes,</b> <b>graduated</b> <b>pipettes,</b> and burettes. They are calibrated to ISO volumetric A grade standards. A glass or plastic pipette tube is used with a thumb-operated piston and PTFE seal which slides within the pipette in a positive displacement operation. Such a device {{can be used on}} a wide variety of fluids (aqueous, viscous, and volatile fluids; hydrocarbons; essential oils; and mixtures) in volumes between 0.5mL and 25mL. This arrangement provides improvements in precision, handling safety, reliability, economy, and versatility. No disposable tips or pipetting aids are needed with the pipetting syringe.|$|R
50|$|<b>Graduated</b> <b>{{pipettes}}</b> are pipettes {{with various}} volumes along the tube. It permit {{the transfer of}} precisely known volumes from one container to another. Measuring pipettes are made from plastic or glass tube that has the taper shape {{at the end of}} the tip with the small divided number calibrated, offering varieties of quantity to measure concentration of the liquid solution with the normal range of 0.1 ml and 25.0 ml. There are two ways to measure the fluid volume by using Mohr pipette or Serological pipette and the differences between them are the position of the graduation mark at the tip of the pipette.|$|R
5000|$|Historically, the {{accuracy}} of a <b>graduated</b> <b>pipette</b> was {{not as good as}} that of a volumetric pipette (accuracy of 3 significant fig); however, with improved manufacturing methods, the accuracies listed by the manufacturer can equal volumetric pipettes. Graduated pipettes are considered to be more precise than Pasteur pipette. They have +/- tolerances that range from 0.6% to 0.4% of the nominal volume when measured at [...] It works by creating a partial vacuum above the liquid-holding chamber and releasing the partial vacuum created to draw up or deliver liquid. Graduated pipettes are manufactured according to ISO specifications for accuracy and the arrangement of the graduations. Grade A and AS pipettes have the highest accuracy and S stands for swift delivery. It has identical error limits as the DIN EN ISO standards. Grade B pipettes generally have twice the error as compared to grade A and AS pipettes.They commonly come in 5, 10, 25 and 50 mL volumes. A variety of propipetters have been developed, both entirely manual and electrically assisted. Originally pipettes were made of soda-lime glass but, currently many are made of borosilicate glass; disposable graduated pipettes are often made of polystyrene.|$|E
40|$|An {{instrument}} {{is described by}} which aliquot portions of a liquid may be mechanically measured and delivered. It was devised especially for use in immunological experiments, {{to take the place}} of a <b>graduated</b> <b>pipette</b> in setting up serum tests. The instrument may be set for any quantity within its capacity and measures sterile liquids without danger of contamination. It may therefore find a wider application in other procedures requiring sterile measurements of small amounts of liquid...|$|E
40|$|The rennet {{activity}} of chymo-trypsin (or pepsin) is conveniently measured by allowing a standard solution of milk to which chymotrypsin {{has been added}} to flow slowly through a <b>graduated</b> <b>pipette</b> and observing the rate and distance of flow of the milk before it clots. The time required for chymo-trypsin to clot milk may be calculated from these observations. The rennet activity is expressed as the reciprocal of the time in minutes required for 1 ml. of enzyme solution to clot 10 ml. of standard milk powder solution...|$|E
5000|$|Class AS: {{contains}} the calibration delivering, presenting as TD and Ex where [...] "S" [...] is sudden delivery. Moreover, the additional functions influence class AS to be commonly established {{due to the}} lower risk of blocking in pipettes and burettes because of a expanded tip. Also, the delivering of fluid is recompensed when observed from the waiting time.Commonly, <b>graduated</b> <b>pipettes</b> also contain acronym [...] "AS" [...] as same as various volumetric instruments {{at the top of}} the pipette which located under the volume of the pipette. This as mentioned, it is the accuracy of classification called [...] "Class AS" [...] in which [...] "A" [...] means the highest-level precision and [...] "S" [...] means fast delivery. In addition, defined by its tolerance according to the DIN ISO standards, the toleration of class AS is half of the class B.|$|R
50|$|The {{delivery}} and waiting times present {{the efficiency of}} the fluid as being delivered occurred as TD and EX. The marking of TD ("to deliver") and EX means that the specified volume is the amount of solution that will drain out of the pipette, which might be less than the total amount that is present due to remnant fluid that still attaches on the wall of a glass or film of the equipment. The delivery time is described as the duration of time that meniscus reach the end of the tip starting from the upward volume and downward volume (the free fall of the meniscus due to the discharging of water) which has the connection for the waiting time for class AS volumetric equipment. Mostly, the remained fluid still drop down to the glass wall. The waiting time of the class AS is set for 5s for bulb and <b>graduated</b> <b>pipettes</b> which is the duration when the meniscus presently comes to rest in the tip. TD/EX pipettes are the most common type.|$|R
40|$|Agitation {{in water}} often fails to {{separate}} conidia from each other, conidiophores, and aerial mycelium. When preparing macroconidia routinely for plating or when selecting for mutants by filtration enrichment, {{it is important}} to remove multicellular agregates and fragments of mycelial or conidiophore hyphae. To obtain suspensions of mainly single conidia, filtration after agitation is often necessary This can be accomplished by passage of a suspension through filters of various types. For noncritical applications, especially in large-scale procedures where many filters are needed and volumes are small, <b>graduated</b> <b>pipettes</b> can be adapted for use as filters. Procedure Large volumes: Cotton or glass wool in thistle tubes has commonly been used, with mixed results. Metzenberg (1989) has found a material that is convenient and reliable. The following description is from that source: “Suspensions containing conidia and growing hyphae may be separated by filtration through glass wool, cheesecloth, Miracloth, or absorbent cotton, but in my hands, the separation is erratic. The filter may either contain a few oversized holes so that everything passes through, or it may plug up so that even non-growing conidia are removed. I find “Thermolam Plus”, a felted synthetic, to be very much superior to the traditional filtration materials...|$|R
40|$|Several {{modifications}} of the roll-tube method {{have made it}} simpler for routine use in the isolation and growth of anaerobic bacteria. These include use of a check valve {{for the production of}} prereduced anaerobically sterilized media; a Salvarsan tube under oxygen-free gas pressure for the dispensing of molten prereduced anaerobically sterilized agar medium; a Kelly infusion bottle with a <b>graduated</b> <b>pipette</b> side arm (also under gas pressure) for quantitative delivery of fluid prereduced anaerobically sterilized media; and screw-capped prescription bottles for the cultivation of anaerobes. Colonies of Bacteroides melaninogenicus were easily identified and counted by this method. Other anaerobic bacteria have also been cultivated successfully...|$|E
40|$|A multi-centre {{study was}} {{undertaken}} to: a/ determine {{the density of}} human semen, and b/ assess the validity of measuring semen volume either volumetrically or gravimetrically. Semen samples from four clinical categories (azoospermia following vasectomy, azoospermia without vasectomy, oligozoospermia (20 × 106 /ml)) had similar densities (one-way ANOVA: F(3, 180) = 1. 25, not significant), being close to 1. 0 g/ml when taken to one decimal place. Measurement of semen volume was then made with either a <b>graduated</b> <b>pipette</b> or by weighing and assuming a density of 1 g/ml. A comparison of the two methods gave an excellent correlation, with a gradient of 1. 0571 and a coefficient of determination (R 2) of 0. 98 (p< 0. 0001). However, {{it was noted that}} the aspiration of the ejaculate in to a <b>graduated</b> <b>pipette</b> underestimated the volume by approximately 0. 2 ml, but in an inconsistent manner making the use of a set correction factor inappropriate. The estimation of volume to one decimal place by weighing the collection container before and after ejaculation, assuming a density of 1 g/ml, {{would seem to be a}} viable alternative although the density of a small number of samples may deviate from this assumption. Whilst the relatively small underestimation of volume with a pipette is unlikely to have clinical significance, the known reporting of inaccurate results by a laboratory is contrary to the philosophy and key principles of quality management.

40|$|A neutron {{dosemeter}} {{which offers}} instant read-out {{has been developed}} for nuclear criticality accidents. The system is based on gels containing emulsions of superheated dichlorodifluoromethane droplets, which vaporise into bubbles upon neutron irradiation. The expansion of these bubbles displaces an equivalent volume of gel into a <b>graduated</b> <b>pipette,</b> providing an immediate measure of the dose. Instant read-out is achieved using an array of transmissive optical sensors which consist of coupled LED emitters and phototransistor receivers. When the gel displaced in the pipette crosses the sensing region of the photomicrosensors, it generates a signal collected on a computer through a dedicated acquisition board. The performance of the device was tested during the 2002 International Accident Dosimetry Intercomparison in Valduc, France. The dosemeter was able to follow the initial dose gradient of a simulated accident, providing accurate values of neutron kerma; however, the emulsion was rapidly depleted of all its drops. A model of the depletion effects was developed and it indicates that an adequate dynamic range of the dose response {{can be achieved by}} using emulsions of smaller droplets...|$|E
40|$|The {{anaerobic}} filamentous organism Actinomyces israelii grows as discrete colonies which sediment in static {{liquid media}} and are too large and variable {{in size to}} be suitable for quantitative inoculations of experimental media. A stirred-culture technique yielded uniformly small viable colonies of Actinomyces israelii. The microcolonies obtained still sedimented rapidly but could be kept in even suspension by bubbling nitrogen through the suspension. Such suspensions gave uniform inocula from a <b>graduated</b> Pasteur <b>pipette</b> as judged by total-nitrogen determinations and showed the growth characteristics of A. israelii grown in static liquid media...|$|R
30|$|Endo-enzyme {{activities}} {{were determined by}} measuring the decrease in viscosity of a substrate solution, either 2 % (w/v) pectin for endo-PMG or 3.2 % (w/v) polygalacturonic acid (sodium salt) for endo-PG. Reduction in viscosity was determined according to a method of Mill and Tuttobello (1961), utilizing a <b>graduated</b> glass <b>pipette</b> as viscometer, which was modified as described in Heerd et al. (2014). The applied sample concentration was adjusted to 1 U/mL of exo-PG activity and the incubation time was reduced to 5  min at 40 °C. One unit of endo-pectinase activity (either PG or PMG) was defined according to Patil and Dayanand (2006) as the quantity of enzyme, which caused a 50 % reduction in viscosity of the reaction mixture per minute, under the applied assay conditions. Endo-pectinolytic {{activities were}} expressed as unit per milliliter crude extract (U/mL).|$|R
50|$|The {{physiological}} tube is one-piece vertical feature {{without any}} crossing {{part of the}} pipettes. Any types of pipette with the cross segment included in a plane perpendicular to the longitudinal line are required to adjust to circular.Delivering tips of the genre 1 and genre 2 are different. For the genre 1, the capacities of the delivery tips is constructed at the gradual taper between 15 to 30 mm for 5 ml, and  20 to 40 mm for 10 to 50 ml. The genre 2 has a longer distance between  50 to 65 mm from the tip end. The tip end of the pipettes are perpendicular construction to the axis. A unexpected constricted orifice is not acceptable for the genre 2 pipettes. The beveling and fire polishing from the external margin of the tip is essential {{at the end of}} the tube. The position of zero graduation line is important for determining of initiating scale of the pipettes. The requirement for the scale of the graduation line is not less than ninety mm due to the capacities.This includes from the top stop following to all of <b>graduated</b> <b>pipettes.</b> The exception presents only for 0.5 ml pipettes that require not less than eighty mm.The period of the extensions and the discharge have some limitations. Unplugging the pipettes, the out-flowing time is vertically flow according to the utilizing 256 5°C of the distilled water together with the stopwatch. The determination of the discharge time depends on the unrestrained outflow liquid from the zero calibration to the final base. The abstaining of the flowing time can be observed during this period.The standard of marking of all pf is  irreparable and comprehensible.The tracing mark of the graduation is required not to greater than 0.40 mm from the elevation. The starting position of the plane required in perpendicular to the upright position. Etching and filling along an eternal colors can enhance the lines and marking spots.|$|R
40|$|Numerous {{techniques}} {{have been described}} for the propagation of bacterial cultures from individual cells. (See Hildebrand, 1950, for a review.) Although isolation of single cells may result in genetic homogeneity in the few generations immediately following their isolation, spontaneous mutations almost certainly destroy this homogeneity upon continued cultivation. Consequently, the de-scription of another technique for obtaining such single-cell cultures would serve little purpose. The present paper describes {{an extension of the}} usual tech-niques that makes possible critical genetic studies when applied to suitable material. This extension consists of the isolation of a number of single-cell cul-tures of known relationships descending from one original cell.

The objective {{of this study was to}} analyze the interference of adjuvants in the amount of air {{included in}} droplets generated by spray nozzles. The treatments were composed by four spray solutions containing mineral oil, vegetable oil, surfactant and water, and three spray nozzles, two air induction type and one pre-orifice. The air included was calculated by the difference between the volume of spray mix (air plus liquid) and only the liquid, which was made by means of sprayed samples captured in a funnel and collected in a graduated cylinder. The surface tension was estimated by the gravimetric method using a precision scale and a <b>graduated</b> <b>pipette.</b> The surfactant provided the largest percentage of air included in the spray. For the surface tension, the mineral oil and the surfactant had the lowest values. It was concluded that the use of adjuvants had a direct influence on the percentage of air included. In addition, products with greater ability to reduce surface tension and to form homogeneous solutions provided the increase in the percentage of air included in the droplet...|$|E
40|$|Background and aims. Salivary glands are {{extremely}} susceptible to radiation injuries. The {{aim of this}} study was to evaluate radiation-induced xerostomia in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinomas, referring to Tabriz Imam Khomeini Hospital in 2005 - 2006. Materials and methods. Thirty patients with nasopharyngeal carcinomas, who received conventional radiotherapy, were included in the present study. The patients ’ unstimulated saliva samples were collected at three intervals, i. e. before treatment, 3 weeks after the initiation of treatment and at the end of treatment by spitting, and measured with a <b>graduated</b> <b>pipette.</b> Results. The differences in the mean values of the patients ’ salivary flow rates at three afore-mentioned intervals were statistically significant (p< 0. 001). Two-by-two comparison of the mean values of salivary flow rates of all the patients and of males and females, carried out separately, demonstrated statistically sig-nificant differences (p< 0. 0025). However, there were no statistically significant differences between males and females before treatment (p = 0. 723), 3 weeks after the initiation of treatment (p = 0. 724) and at the end of treatment (p = 0. 595). There were no statistically significant relationships between age and a decrease in salivary flow rate in the total sample (p = 0. 76, r =- 0. 057), in males (p = 0. 96, r = 0. 011) and in females (p = 0. 539, r =- 0. 208).

Samples were collected by vertical tows with a closing WP 2 net (56 cm diameter, 200 mm mesh size) in the following depth layers: 100 - 200 m, 50 - 100 m, 0 - 50 m. Sampling was always performed in light hours. A flowmeter {{was applied to the}} mouth of the net, however, due to its malfunctioning, the volume of filtered seawater was calculated by multiplying the the area by the height of the sampled layer from winch readings. After collection, each sample was split in two halves (1 / 2) after careful mixing with graduated beakers. Half sample was immediately fixed and preserved in a formaldehyde-seawater solution (4 % final concentration) for species composition and abundance. The other half sample was kept fresh for biomass measurements (data already submitted to SESAME database in different files). Here, only the zooplankton abundance of samples in the upper layers 0 - 50 m and 50 - 100 m are presented. The abundance data of the samples in the layer 50 - 100 m will be submitted later in a separate file. The volume of filtered seawater was estimated by multiplying the the area by the height of the sampled layer from winch readings. Identification and counts of specimens were performed on aliquots (1 / 20 - 1 / 5) of the fixed sample or on the total sample (half of the original sample) by using a <b>graduate</b> large-bore <b>pipette.</b> Copepods were identified to the species level and separated into females, males and juveniles (copepodites). All other taxa were identified at the species level when possible, or at higher taxonomic levels. Taxonomic identification was done according to the most relevant and updated taxonomic literature. Total mesozooplankton abundance was computed as sum of all specific abundances determined as explained above...|$|R
40|$|The {{apparatus}} here described was devised in {{the first}} place for recording continuously the secretion produced by the trachea, but the method appears to offer possibilities for the graphic recording of secretion from ducts and for the observation of smooth muscle contraction in hollow organs. The apparatus can be cheaply and easily made in any labora-tory. A light-tight box 20. 5 cm. wide x 22. 5 cm. long x 20. 5 cm. high was constructed with one of the sides 20. 5 cm. x 20. 5 cm. detachable. Through the length of the box a spindle was in-serted, which projected through a bearing at one end so as to carry a variable pulley on the outside. The other bearing for the spindle was carried on the detachable side. The dimensions were so arranged that a Palmer’s drum could be put on the spindle so as just to clear the top of the box and the detachable side be then fixed in place. A V-shaped depression was cut through the top of the box parallel to the spindle. The under surface of this V was lined on either side by soft felt which came into contact with the drum. Photographic paper of the right size was then gummed onto the drum in a suitable light, the drum inserted into the box, and the detachable end carrying a bearing fixed in place.

This study was conducted along the lines of a previously described study of the bactericidal efficiencies of some of the phenols and alcohols (Tilley, 1939). EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE Bactericidal efficiency was determined by the Rideal-Walker technique, modified as follows: Either infusion broth or FDA beef extract broth was used instead of R-W standard broth; instead of a standardized dropping pipette a 1 -ml <b>pipette</b> <b>graduated</b> into tenths was used to measure out the 0. 5 ml of culture required for the test; medication temperatures were sometimes 20 C and some-times 30 C instead of 15 C to 18 C; dilutions were made in sterile Erlenmeyer flasks instead of in cylinders; fixed amounts of the stock solution of disinfectant were added to varying amounts of distilled water, all measured with sterile standardized pipettes; the time of exposure was extended beyond 15 minutes, subcultures being made at 2. 5 -minute intervals when exposure varied from 2. 5 to 30 minutes, at 5 -minute intervals when exposures varied from 30 to 80 minutes, and at 10 -minute intervals when exposures were beyond 80 minutes; and Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli were used as test organisms instead of Eberthella typho 8 a.
