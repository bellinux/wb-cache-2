At the Cavola landslide we show that this spectrum is dependent on the direction of propagation of wave <b>fronts</b> for <b>incidence</b> <b>angles</b> in the range 30 ° to 90 °. Our study is based on comparison of spectral ratios from observations and 2 D numerical simulations. We have modeled propagation in a 2 D profile for SH and SV waves with several <b>incidence</b> <b>angles</b> in the 0 ° ± 90 ° range, where 0 ° and 90 ° are respectively vertical and horizontal incidence, except that ± 90 ° denotes Rayleigh waves in the P-SV. We discuss in detail the result for <b>angles</b> of <b>incidence</b> of 0, ± 20 °, ± 60 °, ± 90 °. We have obtained observed horizontal-to-horizontal earthquakes spectral ratios using three reference sites. Two of these have matching receivers in the model, located at the opposite ends of the 2 D profile. Overall observations are matched best when the reference site is located {{on the same side of}} the landslide as the incoming wave front. We also find general agreement of the observed H/H spectral ratios from earthquakes with H/V and H/H spectral ratios from noise, and the match between H/V values from noise and synthetic spectral ratios using an absolute, flat half-space reference is very good.

In this paper, we propose using a high-reflectance shutter so as to resolve temperature-related precision problems in lithography systems. A single-layer molybdenum film is used to greatly reduce the quantity of absorbed radiation energy by the shutter structure (in line with Fresnel equation) by increasing the <b>incidence</b> <b>angle.</b> A green laser is used as the light source to construct an automatic measuring system for reflectance and transmittance to verify the increase of material reflectance by the <b>incidence</b> <b>angle</b> of the photosource.

40|$|International audienceWe analyze an {{important}} aspect of the behavior of surface plasmon polariton (SPP) Bragg mirrors: the dependence of the angular acceptance for reflection on the <b>incidence</b> <b>angle.</b> By means of leakage radiation microscopy, both in direct and Fourier space, we observe that the angular acceptance diminishes for increasing <b>incidence</b> <b>angles.</b> This effect, which can considerably affect the design of devices based on these elements, is shown to be the consequence of the decrease of the bandgap width with increasing <b>incidence</b> <b>angle.</b> (c) 2007 Optical Society of America...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The {{solution}} of a boundary–value problem formulated for the Kretschmann configuration {{shows that the}} phase speed of a surface–plasmon–polariton (SPP) wave guided by the planar interface of a sufficiently thin metal film and a sculptured thin film (STF) depends on the vapor <b>incidence</b> <b>angle</b> used while fabricating the STF by physical vapor deposition. Furthermore, {{it may be possible}} to engineer the phase speed by periodically varying the vapor <b>incidence</b> <b>angle.</b> The phase speed of the SPP wave can be set by selecting higher mean value and/or the modulation amplitude of the vapor <b>incidence</b> <b>angle.</b> I...|$|R
40|$|Like other {{microwave}} frequency bands, L-band scattering coefficient (~`) measurements {{have shown a}} definite dependence on ocean surface wind speed (W). The {{relationship between the two}} depends on the observation angle of the radar. The satellite-borne L-band radars SEASAT-SAR and SIR-A made observations at fixed <b>incidence</b> <b>angles,</b> while the just completed SIR-B mission has made observations at multiple <b>incidence</b> <b>angles.</b> The present work uses the theory of scattering from a composite surface and generates an analytic function of ~" - W relationship for varying <b>incidence</b> <b>angle</b> at L-band by the method of empirical curve fitting...|$|R
40|$|The {{preliminary}} results of algorithm development and testing for soil moisture retrieval at high <b>incidence</b> <b>angles</b> are reported. Based on first-order surface backscattering models, a physically based algorithm for retrieval of soil moisture {{was developed and}} evaluated using NASA/JPL aircraft synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data. It shows that the copolarization ratio is sensitive to soil moisture change but not to surface roughness at high <b>incidence</b> <b>angles.</b> This algorithm performed well at L-band and should be useful. This study suggests that <b>incidence</b> <b>angles</b> greater than 40 degrees are optimal for such monitoring...|$|R
50|$|QuikSCAT {{consists}} of an active microwave radar that infers surface winds from the roughness of the sea surface based on measurements of radar backscatter cross section, denoted as σ0. σ0 varies with surface wind speed and direction relative to the antenna azimuth, <b>incidence</b> <b>angle,</b> polarization, and radar frequency. QuikSCAT uses a dual-beam, conically scanning antenna that samples {{the full range of}} azimuth angles during each antenna revolution. Backscatter measurements are obtained at fixed <b>incidence</b> <b>angles</b> of 46° and 54°, providing up to four views of each region of the surface at different <b>incidence</b> <b>angles.</b>|$|R
40|$|Multiple <b>incidence</b> <b>angle</b> SIR-B {{data of the}} Cordon la Grasa {{region of}} the Chubut Province of Argentina are used to {{discriminate}} various forest types by their relative brightness versus <b>incidence</b> <b>angle</b> signatures. The region consists of several species of Nothofagas which change in canopy structure with elevation, slope, and exposure. In general, the factors that appear to impact the radar response most are canopy structure, density, and ground cover (presence or absence of dead trunks and branches in particular). The results of this work indicate that (1) different forest species, and structures of a single species, may be discriminated using multiple <b>incidence</b> <b>angle</b> radar imagery and (2) {{it is essential to}} consider the variation in backscatter due to <b>incidence</b> <b>angle</b> when analyzing the comparing data collected at varying frequencies and polarizations...|$|R
