5|$|The Leopard2E {{is a major}} {{improvement}} over the M60 Patton tank, which it replaced in Spain's mechanized and armored units. Its development represented a total of 2.6million man-hours worth of work, 9,600 of them in Germany, at a total cost of 2.4billion euros. This makes {{it one of the}} most expensive Leopard 2s built. <b>Indigenous</b> <b>production</b> amounted to 60% and the vehicles were assembled locally at Sevilla by Santa Bárbara Sistemas. It has thicker armor on the turret and glacis plate than the German Leopard 2A6, and uses a Spanish-designed tank command and control system, similar to the one fitted in German Leopard 2s. The Leopard2E is expected to remain in service until 2025.|$|E
500|$|Whence, in {{the name}} of Count Buffon and Baron Cuvier, came those dogs that I saw in Typee? Dogs!—Big hairless rats rather; all with smooth, shining, {{speckled}} hides—fat sides, and very disagreeable faces. Whence could they have come? That they were not the <b>indigenous</b> <b>production</b> of the region, I am firmly convinced. Indeed they seemed aware of their being interlopers, looking fairly ashamed, and always trying to hide themselves in some dark corner. It was plain enough they did not feel at home in the vale—that they wished themselves well out of it, and back to the ugly country from which they must have come.|$|E
2500|$|Starting in 1971, the new Hornet {{was built}} and {{continued}} to be marketed under the Rambler brand. American Motors South America (Proprietary) Limited was the official license holder for production of the Rambler Hornet at the Motor Assemblies Ltd plant. However, sales after 1971 were hampered by problems arising from regulations. The nation's tariff structure considered only the weight of parts or materials made in South Africa would be calculated toward local content requirements. The objective was to increase <b>indigenous</b> <b>production.</b> As a result, {{the last of the}} South African-built Rambler Hornets had [...] Chevrolet straight-6 engines. The objective was to standardize the manufacture of vehicle components within South Africa. In this case, a large component, the Hornet's original AMC engine was eliminated from the marketplace, while the switch also provided greater local production volume to the General Motors engine.|$|E

2500|$|The initial {{focus for}} the industry's export efforts was the United Kingdom. The late 1970s and early 1980s were not only {{pioneering}} times for production but also marketing and as with many New Zealand products, wine was only really taken seriously at home when it was noticed and praised overseas and in particular by British wine commentators and critics. [...] For much {{of the history of}} New Zealand wine exportation the United Kingdom market, with its lack of <b>indigenous</b> <b>production,</b> great thirst and sophisticated wine pallate has been either the principal or only market. In the last decade [...] the British market's overwhelming importance has eroded; while still the single largest export market, it now (2006) makes up only one third of total exports by value, only slightly larger than the American and Australian markets. [...] Japan is a particularly strong importer of high-end New Zealand wines: in 2006, it spent NZ$14.44 per liter of wine imported, compared to New Zealand's average price of NZ$8.87/L.|$|E
60|$|There {{were some}} curious-looking {{dogs in the}} valley. Dogs!—big, hairless rats rather; all with smooth, shining, {{speckled}} hides—fat sides, and very disagreeable faces.

6000|$|Rooms {{have their}} atmosphere, their necessities, their artistic proprieties. Apartments à la Louis Quatorze {{represent}} {{the ideas and}} the sympathies of a period when the rich lived by themselves in luxury, and the poor were trodden down in the gutter; when there was only aristocratic contempt and domination on one side, and servility and smothered curses on the other. With the change of the apartments to the style of that past era, seemed to come its maxims and morals, as artistically indicated for its completeness. So John {{walked up and down}} in his Louis Quinze salon, and into his Pompadour boudoir, and out again into the Louis Quatorze dining-rooms, and reflected. He had had many reflections in those apartments before. Of all ill-adapted and unsuitable pieces of furniture in them, he had always felt himself the most unsuitable and ill-adapted. He had never felt at home in them. He never felt like lolling at ease on any of those elegant sofas, as of old he used to cast himself into the motherly arms of the great chintz one that filled the recess. His Lillie, with her smart paraphernalia of hoops and puffs and ruffles and pinkings and bows, seemed a perfectly natural and <b>indigenous</b> <b>production</b> there; but he himself seemed always to be out of place. His Lillie might have been any of Balzac's charming duchesses, with their [...] "thirty-seven thousand ways of saying 'Yes;'" [...] but, as to himself, he must have been taken for her steward or gardener, who had accidentally strayed in, and was fraying her satin surroundings with rough coats and heavy boots. There was not, in fact, in all the reorganized house, a place where he felt himself to be at all the proper thing; nowhere where he could lounge, and read his newspaper, without a feeling of impropriety; nowhere that he could indulge in any of the slight Hottentot-isms wherein unrenewed male nature delights,--without a feeling of rebuke.|$|E
