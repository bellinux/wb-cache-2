5|$|Much of {{the debate}} in the 2008 {{legislative}} session centered on crafting a budget for the 2008–2010 biennium, a period when the state was projected to encounter a shortfall of nearly $1 billion. Beshear expressed surprise that the budget issues consumed so much of the Assembly's time during the session, but admitted that the legislature had become much more independent of the governor than <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> was a legislator two decades earlier. He listed early childhood education and expanded health care for children among the priorities that he was unable to address in the session.|$|E

During their {{conversation}} Ste reveales Amy was the only girl he really had feelings for and that his confusion over his sexuality was not the reason for him abusing her during their relation ship. Ste is very relieved by Amy's good reaction. Amy {{is the one who}} discovers that Brendan is hitting Ste and she tells Ste to break it off, reminding him of how <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> was hitting her.|$|E

He was buried at Oaklands Cemetery near West Chester, Pennsylvania.

25|$|Previously being a Nazi paratrooper Trautmann {{admitted}} {{during and}} prior {{the war he}} saw the British and Jews as enemies, however <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> taken as {{a prisoner of war}} in England that he quickly reappraised his view of both. He was astonished at his treatment as a POW, after being invited for Christmas dinner, an unthinkable luxury in an brainwashing, dictatorial Nazi Germany. Trautmann soon warmed to England that he decided to settle in the country upon repatriation in Lancashire and even changed his name from the hard to pronounce Bernhard to a more English Bert. Having taken an interest in sport, he soon played for St Helens Town and humbled when Manchester City signed him in 1949.|$|E
25|$|While in {{the short}} term the fiasco led Bill Cosby to end his {{advertising}} for Coke, saying his commercials that praised the superiority of the new formula had hurt his credibility, no one at Coca-Cola was fired or otherwise held responsible for what is still widely perceived as a misstep, {{for the simple reason that}} it ultimately wasn't. When Goizueta died in 1997, the company's share price was at a level well above what <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> had taken over 16 years earlier and its position as market leader even more firmly established. At the time Roger Enrico, then head of Pepsi's American operations, likened New Coke to the Edsel. Later, when he became PepsiCo's CEO, he modified his assessment of the situation, saying that had people been fired or demoted over New Coke, it would have sent a message that risk-taking was strongly discouraged at the company.|$|E

25|$|After the {{old regime}} is ousted and Historia ascends to the throne in his place, Eren {{and the rest of}} the Survey Corps depart to Shiganshina to reclaim Wall Maria by sealing its breach with his new power. However, upon {{arriving}} there, they face an army of Titans led by Zeke, the Beastly Titan, as well as Bertoldt and Reiner. The vicious battle ends with almost all members of the expedition killed, including Erwin, save for Eren and his companions, but Zeke ends up forced to flee, leaving a captured Bertoldt behind, which is later consumed by Armin to save his life. With Shiganshina secured, Eren fulfills his promise to his father by reaching the basement of their old house, where he and his friends retrieve some books and a photograph of Grisha, his first wife, Dina, who Eren recognizes as the same Titan who killed his mother, and their son, who is no other than Zeke. Upon returning home, Eren realizes that to control the power of the coordinate, he must obtain the blood of someone from the royalty, as the only moment when he managed to use <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> got into contact with Dina, a descendant of the Eldian kings herself, in her Titan form.|$|E

Scouts from seven major league teams were vying for his services, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> was playing in an exhibition game against Anson's Chicago White Stockings team that he got his opportunity to sign a major league contract. After the game, White Stockings owner Albert Spalding offered him a contract to play for his team, and Gore signed. Spaulding offered him $1,200 a season, and although Gore originally asked for $2,500, they eventually compromised on $1,900.|$|E
2500|$|The {{ruins of}} the cashel itself are {{described}} as being a circular wall enclosing an area of [...] in diameter. The wall had a height of [...] with a breadth varying from [...] to [...] While not perpendicular, it had an inclination inwards indicating its similarity to most other Irish stone forts. [...] Petrie suggests that it was probably originally between twice and four times as high as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> surveyed it. [...] up on the interior side of the wall, the thickness was [...] due {{to the presence of}} terracing. The terrace is reached by flights of steps {{on either side of the}} entrance gateway. Fallen stones had covered any other existing stairs. Petrie suggests that there were originally three or four such terraces ascending to the top of the wall. [...] On each side of the entranceway, there are [...] "galleries" [...] within the wall. Their precise purpose is not clear and they do not connect with the entrance. These two wall-passages, one on the south and another from the northeast run towards the gateway, but stop short. Near the north end of the south passage is a small recess in its west wall. At the south end of the north passage there is a seat-stone.|$|E
