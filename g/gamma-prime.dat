5000|$|Inconel alloys are oxidation- and {{corrosion-resistant}} materials {{well suited}} for service in extreme environments subjected to high pressure and kinetic energy. When heated, Inconel forms a thick and stable passivating oxide layer protecting the surface from further attack. Inconel retains strength over a wide temperature range, attractive for high-temperature applications where aluminium and steel would succumb to creep {{as a result of}} thermally induced crystal vacancies (see Arrhenius equation). Inconel's high temperature strength is developed by solid solution strengthening or precipitation strengthening, depending on the alloy. In age-hardening or precipitation-strengthening varieties, small amounts of niobium combine with nickel to form the intermetallic compound Ni3Nb or gamma prime (γ'). Gamma prime forms small cubic crystals that inhibit slip and creep effectively at elevated temperatures. [...] The formation of <b>gamma-prime</b> crystals increases over time, especially after three hours of a heat exposure of 850 °C, and continues to grow after 72 hours of exposure.|$|E
50|$|A major {{challenge}} facing turbine design is reducing the creep that is {{induced by the}} high temperatures. Because of the stresses of operation, turbine materials become damaged through these mechanisms. As temperatures are increased {{in an effort to}} improve turbine efficiency, creep becomes more significant. To limit creep, thermal coatings and superalloys with solid-solution strengthening and grain boundary strengthening are used in blade designs. Protective coatings are used to reduce the thermal damage and to limit oxidation. These coatings are often stabilized zirconium dioxide-based ceramics. Using a thermal protective coating limits the temperature exposure of the nickel superalloy. This reduces the creep mechanisms experienced in the blade. Oxidation coatings limit efficiency losses caused by a buildup {{on the outside of the}} blades, which is especially important in the high-temperature environment. The nickel-based blades are alloyed with aluminum and titanium to improve strength and creep resistance. The microstructure of these alloys is composed of different regions of composition. A uniform dispersion of the <b>gamma-prime</b> phase - a combination of nickel, aluminum, and titanium - promotes the strength and creep resistance of the blade due to the microstructure. Refractory elements such as rhenium and ruthenium can be added to the alloy to improve creep strength. The addition of these elements reduces the diffusion of the gamma prime phase, thus preserving the fatigue resistance, strength, and creep resistance.|$|E
40|$|ISGF 3 {{is a major}} protein factor which mediates the {{transcriptional}} activation of interferon-inducible genes. ISGF 3 is composed of two subunits, ISGF 3 gamma and ISGF 3 alpha, which are stimulated by interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha), respectively. In this paper, the effect of pretreatment of IFN-gamma on the response of K 562 cells to IFN-alpha, termed `'gamma-priming,'' is examined. Using techniques of gene transfection and mobility shift assay, we studied the <b>gamma-priming</b> effects on the kinetics of appearance and disappearance of (i) the protein product of a luciferase reporter gene driven by an IFN-inducible promoter and (ii) the binding of ISGF 3 to the interferon-stimulated response element. We found that exposure of cells to IFN-gamma prior to IFN-alpha greatly increased both the levels {{and the rate of}} ISGF 3 binding activity during the early phase of IFN-alpha treatment and caused the amount of ISGF 3 bound to the interferon-stimulated response element to decrease more rapidly with time during the later phase. Such effects were reflected also on the kinetics of expression of the interferon-inducible luciferase gene induced by IFN-alpha. In order to understand the basis of these <b>gamma-priming</b> effects, we use an in vitro reconstitution method to examine the kinetics of the subcomponents of ISGF 3 in response to different IFN treatments in K 562 cells. It was found that <b>gamma-priming</b> not only increased the levels of ISGF 3 gamma, but it also stimulated both the rates of {{rise and fall of the}} activated alpha-component of ISGF 3. A molecular model is proposed to explain these findings...|$|R
40|$|The basic {{framework}} for the JAK/STAT pathway is well documented. Recruitment of latent cytoplasmic STAT transcription factors to tyrosine phosphorylated docking sites on cytokine receptors and their JAK-mediated phosphorylation instigates their translocation to the nucleus {{and their ability to}} bind DNA, The biochemical processes underlying recruitment and activation of this pathway have commonly been studied in reconstituted in vitro systems using previously defined recombinant signaling components. We have dissected the Interferon gamma (IFN gamma) signal transduction pathway in crude extracts from wild-type and STAT 1 -negative mutant cell Lines by real-time BIAcore analysis, size-exclusion (SE) chromatography and immune-detection. The data indicate that in detergent-free cell extracts: (1) the phospho-tyrosine (Y 440 P) -containing peptide motif of the IFN gamma-receptor ct-chain interacts directly with STAT 1, or STAT 1 complexes, and no other protein; (2) nonactivated STAT 1 is present in a higher molecular weight complex(es) and, at least for IFN <b>gamma-primed</b> cells, is available for recruitment to the activated IFN gamma-receptor from only a subset of such complexes; (3) activated STAT 1 is released from the receptor as a monomer...|$|R
40|$|Background: Adults with {{advanced}} HIV {{are susceptible to}} invasive and recrudescent infections with nontyphoidal salmonellae. Objectives: To examine whether persistence and recurrence of salmonella infection results from HIV-related defects in macrophage internalization and intracellular killing or from ineffective type 1 cytokine responses. Such defects could be {{a direct consequence of}} macrophage HIV infection or secondary to reduced enhancement of macrophage effector functions by interferon-gamma (IFN gamma) as CD 4 cell count falls. Design: Ex-vivo scientific case-control study. Methods: Primary ex-vivo human alveolar macrophages (huAM) from HIV-negative and HIV-positive subjects were challenged with Salmonella typhimurium under unprimed and IFN <b>gamma-primed</b> conditions to study internalization and intracellular killing of bacteria and cytokine responses of huAM. Results: Priming of huAM with IFN gamma reduced bacterial internalization but enhanced microbicidal activity against intracellular salmonellae. HuAM from HIV-positive subjects showed unimpaired internalization and intracellular killing of salmonellae, with and without IFN gamma priming. Opsonic and mannose receptor (CD 206) -mediated entry was not required for optimal internalization. HuAM from HIV-positive subjects, however, exhibited increased secretion of tumour necrosis factor a (TNF alpha), interleukin (IL) - 10 and IL- 12 in response to S. typhimurium challenge, regardless of IFN gamma priming. This cytokine dysregulation showed a trend to a curvilinear relationship with peripheral CD 4 cell count, with marked decline at values < 250 cell/mu l. Conclusions: Dysregulation of proinflammatory cytokine release, including IL- 12, by macrophages during salmonella infection may underlie the susceptibility to severe salmonellosis in patients with AIDS. This defect was not reversed by IFN gamma and may represent a proinflammatory effect of HIV infection upon the macrophage or the alveolar milieu. 2007 Wolters Kluwer Health vertical bar Lippincott Williams & Wilkins...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of composition on the microstructure of single crystal nickel-base superalloys was investigated. Co {{was replaced by}} Ni, and Ta was replaced by either Ni or W, according to a matrix of compositions based on MAR-M 247. Substitution of Ni for Co caused an increase in <b>gamma-prime</b> solvus temperature, an increase in gamma-gamma-prime lattice mismatch, and the precipitation of W-rich phases in the alloys with high refractory metal levels. Substitution of Ni for Ta caused large decreases in <b>gamma-prime</b> solvus temperature, <b>gamma-prime</b> volume fraction, and gamma-gamma-prime lattice mismatch, whereas substitution of W for Ta resulted in smaller decreases in these features. For the alloys with <b>gamma-prime</b> particles that remained coherent, substitution of Ni for Co caused an increase in <b>gamma-prime</b> coarsening rate. The two alloys with the largest magnitude of lattice mismatch possessed <b>gamma-prime</b> particles which lost coherency during unstressed aging and exhibited anomalously low coarsening rates.

The peak corresponded to an initial microstructure consisting of cuboidal precipitates aligned along 001 line directions. These aligned cuboidal <b>gamma-prime</b> particles directionally coarsened into a relatively perfect lamellar gamma/gamma-prime structure {{in the early stages of}} creep, whereas the more irregularly shaped and distributed <b>gamma-prime</b> particles in both under- and overaged material formed more irregular lamellae with more imperfections.

Furthermore, these Co-Al-W <b>gamma-prime</b> alloys are interesting as potential cast-and-wrought alloys because they have a relatively narrow range of solidification temperature and large range of temperature between the <b>gamma-prime</b> solvus and the solidus, suggesting than manufacturing via an ingot metallurgy route would be feasible. However, since J. Sato et al discovered <b>gamma-prime</b> in the Co-Al-W alloy system in 2006, the focus in the literature has been on characterizing the structure and properties of these alloys and measuring and assessing the thermodynamics of the alloy system primarily for application as castings for turbine blade applications. To date the author is not aware of any publications describing the microstructure of vacuum induction melted, vacuum arc remelted ingots of a size more than about 2 kg. Most work has been performed using small, laboratory-scale, cast-and-hot-rolled samples or samples cast as single crystals.

Increasing the Mo content significantly influenced the PSDs and decreased the coarsening rate of the <b>gamma-prime</b> cubes, as a result of increasing the magnitude of the lattice mismatch. After extended aging times, the <b>gamma-prime</b> cubes underwent massive coalescence into plates at a rate which was much faster than the cuboidal coarsening rate.

Characterization of the melt-spun ribbon by optical and scanning electron microscopy indicates a range of microstructures, including single-phase beta, <b>gamma-prime</b> necklace phase surrounding either martensitic or beta grains, and a mixture of equiaxed martensitic and <b>gamma-prime</b> grains.

In contrast, multiphase (<b>gamma-prime</b> + either martensite or beta) alloys tend to display a peak in flow stress between 600 and 800 K, with little or no signs of microcracking.

However, thermomechanical processing modifications reflecting the effect of Co on the <b>gamma-prime</b> and carbide solvi are shown to restore the workability and the properties of alloys {{with little or no}} cobalt...|$|E
