40|$|Enhanced <b>environmental</b> quality, fuel <b>security,</b> and {{economic}} development along with reduced prices of ethanol-gasoline blends are often used as justifications for the U. S. federal excise tax exemption on ethanol fuels. However, the possible effect of increased overall consumption of fuel in response to lower total price, mitigating the <b>environmental</b> and fuel <b>security</b> benefits, are generally not considered. Taking this price response into account, the optimal U. S. ethanol subsidy is derived. Estimated values of the optimal subsidy reveal that the subsidy's <b>environmental</b> and <b>security</b> benefits are questionable. However, positive <b>environmental</b> and <b>security</b> benefits from the ethanol tax-exemption subsidy may be obtained if the subsidy is combined {{with an increase in}} the excise tax on gasoline. ...|$|R

LLNL staff have been heavily involved in the cooperative nonproliferation programs with Russia to secure at-risk weapons materials and assist former weapons workers in developing peaceful applications and self-sustaining job opportunities for their expertise and technologies. In the mid-1990s, Lab scientists began efforts to devise improved biodetection capabilities, leading to miniaturized and autonomous instruments that can detect biothreat agents in a few minutes instead of the days to weeks previously required for DNA analysis.|$|E
500|$|Social {{disruptions}} like war, {{crime and}} corruption divert resources from areas of greatest human need, damage {{the capacity of}} societies {{to plan for the}} future, and generally threaten human well-being and the environment. Broad-based strategies for more sustainable social systems include: improved education and the political empowerment of women, especially in developing countries; greater regard for social justice, notably equity between rich and poor both within and between countries; and intergenerational equity. Depletion of natural resources including fresh water increases the likelihood of [...] "resource wars". This aspect of sustainability has been referred to as <b>environmental</b> <b>security</b> and creates a clear need for global environmental agreements to manage resources such as aquifers and rivers which span political boundaries, and to protect shared global systems including oceans and the atmosphere.|$|E

[...] In 1994, Romm published Lean and Clean Management, a book that discussed management techniques that can reduce the impact of manufacturing and other industries on the environment while increasing productivity and profits. [...] He co-authored, with Charles B. Curtis, [...] "MidEast Oil Forever," [...] the cover story of the April 1996 issue of the Atlantic Monthly, which predicted higher oil prices within a decade and discussed alternative energy strategies. The same year, he co-authored a paper for the ACEEE Summer Study on Energy Efficiency in Buildings on [...] "Policies to Reduce Heat Islands". [...] In 1999, Romm published Cool Companies: How the Best Businesses Boost Profits and Productivity by Cutting Greenhouse Gas Emissions, the first book to benchmark corporate best practices for using advanced energy technologies, including fuel cells, to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Heading The terms <b>environmental</b> {{and human}} <b>security</b> and {{vulnerability}} are defined {{in this paper}} in a broad sense. Human security {{is directly related to}} environmental preservation (water, air, soil, ecosystems, and biodiversity). <b>Environmental</b> and human <b>security</b> have been recognised as key factors for socio-economic growth and prosperity and sustainable development. Regulation and policy to sustain <b>environmental</b> and human <b>security</b> in European Union (EU) countries, and more specifically in the Mediterranean region, are briefly reviewed in this presentation. Examples from environmental sectors like water resources may include the EU Water Framework Directive (EU-WFD) and institutional issues for facing water quality degradation and hydrological extremes such as floods. 1...|$|R

2500|$|In September, Clinton {{unveiled}} the Global Hunger and Food Security Initiative {{at the annual}} meeting of her husband's Clinton Global Initiative. The goal of the new initiative is to battle hunger worldwide on a strategic basis as a key part of U.S. foreign policy, rather than just react to food shortage emergencies as they occur. The secretary said that [...] "Food security is not just about food. But it is all about security: economic security, <b>environmental</b> <b>security,</b> even national security. Massive hunger poses a threat to the stability of governments, societies and borders." [...] The initiative seeks to develop agricultural economies, counter malnourishment, increase productivity, expand trade, and spur innovation in developing nations. Clinton said that women would be placed at the center of the effort, as they constitute a majority of the world's farmers. The next month, to mark World Food Day, Clinton said, [...] "Fighting hunger and poverty through sustainable agricultural development, making sure that enough food is available and that people have the resources to purchase it, is a key foreign policy objective of the Obama administration." ...|$|E
