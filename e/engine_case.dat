This was the troublesome engine that was {{installed on the}} 1977 to 1980 Cessna 172N Skyhawk. [...] It was notable from all other Lycoming models by incorporating hydraulic lifters that were barrel shaped instead of mushroom type, {{in an attempt to}} make the lifters possible to be serviced without having to disassemble the entire <b>engine</b> <b>case,</b> but the higher load on the cam lobes resulted in severe spalling. Multiple service bulletins and airworthiness directives have been issued regarding this specific model, and multiple modifications exist to attempt to mitigate its design defects.|$|E

Here the oil doubles as cooling liquid, prompting the name [...] "oil-cooling." [...] Suzuki has produced many oil-cooled motorcycles. Modern BMW R-series flat-twin motorcycles, such as the R1150GS, use air and oil cooling. Polaris's Victory motorcycles use oil/air cooling exclusively.|$|E
40|$|Procedures for {{modeling}} the high-speed impact of composite materials {{are needed for}} designing reliable composite <b>engine</b> <b>cases</b> that are lighter than the metal cases in current use. The types of polymer matrix composites {{that are likely to}} be used in such an application have a deformation response that is nonlinear and that varies with strain rate. To characterize and validate material models {{that could be used in}} the design of impactresistant <b>engine</b> <b>cases,</b> researchers must obtain material data over a wide variety of strain rates. An experimental program has been carried out through a university grant with the Ohio State University to obtain deformation data for a representative polymer matrix composite for strain rates ranging from quasi-static to high rates of several hundred per second. This information has been used to characterize and validate a constitutive model that was developed at the NASA Glenn Research Center...|$|R
40|$|An {{integrated}} team of NASA personnel, Government contractors, industry partners, {{and university}} staff {{have developed an}} innovative new technology for commercial fan cases that will substantially influence the safety and efficiency of future turbine engines. This effective team, {{under the direction of}} the NASA Glenn Research Center and with the support of the Federal Aviation Administration, has matured a new class of carbon/polymer composites and demonstrated a 30 - to 50 -percent improvement in specific containment capacity (blade fragment kinetic energy/containment system weight). As the heaviest engine component, the engine case/containment system greatly affects both the safety and efficiency of aircraft engines. The ballistic impact research team has developed unique test facilities and methods for screening numerous candidate material systems to replace the traditional heavy, metallic <b>engine</b> <b>cases.</b> This research has culminated in the selection of a polymer matrix composite reinforced with triaxially braided carbon fibers and technology demonstration through the fabrication of prototype <b>engine</b> <b>cases</b> for three major commercial engine manufacturing companies...|$|R

50|$|Engines {{with more}} {{cylinders}} {{for the same}} displacement feel smoother to ride. Engines with fewer cylinders are cheaper, lighter, and easier to maintain. Liquid-cooled motorcycles have a radiator which is the primary way their heat is dispersed. Coolant or oil is constantly circulated between this radiator and the cylinder when the engine is running. Air-cooled motorcycles rely on air blowing past fins on the <b>engine</b> <b>case</b> to disperse heat. Liquid-cooled motorcycles {{have the potential for}} greater power at a given displacement, tighter tolerances, and longer operating life, whereas air-cooled motorcycles are potentially cheaper to purchase, less mechanically complex and lighter weight.|$|E
50|$|The drive {{package on}} the Venture Royale {{includes}} a liquid-cooled V-4 engine. It has four valves per cylinder, overhead camshafts with shim over bucket valve adjustment. The five speed transmission {{is integral with}} the <b>engine</b> <b>case.</b> The engine and transmission share lubricating oil. The drive shaft and final drive assembly are built into {{the left side of}} the double sided swing arm. Swing arm motion is damped by an air preloaded monoshock mounted in the center of the frame. The clutch is of the wet plate design and is hydraulically activated by the left hand lever.|$|E

In the Blaster version & some of the DT200WR versions the oil pump is not installed, blanking plug is fitted over the oil pump drive.|$|R
2500|$|Engine {{failures}} may {{be described}} as [...] "contained" [...] or [...] "uncontained". A contained engine failure {{is one in which}} components might separate inside the engine but either remain within the <b>engine’s</b> <b>cases</b> or exit the engine through the tail pipe. Engine enclosures are not designed to contain broken turbines, rather the turbines are designed not to break. An uncontained engine failure is more serious because pieces often exit the sides of the engine, posing potential danger to the aircraft structure and those within the plane.|$|R
50|$|In 1927 the J. I. Case Company ceased {{building}} its legendary steam <b>engines.</b> <b>Case</b> steam <b>engines,</b> of which over 30,000 were produced, were painted in black with green machinery, while the gas tractors were painted grey. In 1939, Case changed its color scheme to Flambeau Red, with the excavators being a ruddy yellow. By 1929, Case had expanded to Australia, Mexico, Sweden and other countries. Also that year, the J. I. Case Company produced its first crawler tractor. S and V tractors {{were introduced in}} 1940.|$|R
5000|$|Porsche {{designers}} {{decided to}} use the <b>engine</b> <b>case</b> they had originally designed for the Volkswagen Beetle. It was an air-cooled pushrod OHV flat-four engine. For use in the 356, they designed new cylinder heads, camshaft, crankshaft, intake and exhaust manifolds and used dual carburetors to more than double the VW's horsepower. While the first prototype 356 had a mid-engine layout, all later 356s had a rear-mounted layout. When the four-cam [...] "Carrera" [...] engine became available in late 1955, this engine became an extra cost option starting with the 356 A, and was available through the 356 model run.|$|E
5000|$|As of 2011, {{the engine}} {{capacity}} limit for all motorbikes {{competing in the}} Dakar Rally is 450cc. Engines may be either single or twin cylinder. Riders are divided into two groups, [...] "Elite" [...] (Group 1) and Non-Elite (Group 2), with the latter subdivided into two further groups - the [...] "Super Production" [...] (Group 2.1) and [...] "Marathon" [...] (Group 2.2) classes. [...] "Marathon" [...] competitors {{are not permitted to}} change such key components as the engine (including the <b>engine</b> <b>case,</b> cylinders and cylinder heads), the frame, the forks or swinging arm, whereas those in the [...] "Super Production" [...] and [...] "Elite" [...] classes may replace these components.|$|E
5000|$|In post-war Germany, {{parts were}} {{generally}} in short supply, so the 356 automobile used components from the Volkswagen Beetle, including the <b>engine</b> <b>case</b> from its internal combustion engine, transmission, and several parts {{used in the}} suspension. The 356, however, had several evolutionary stages, A, B, and C, while in production, and most Volkswagen-sourced parts were replaced by Porsche-made parts. Beginning in 1954 the 356s engines started utilizing engine cases designed specifically for the 356. The sleek bodywork was designed by Erwin Komenda, who also had designed {{the body of the}} Beetle. Porsche's signature designs have, from the beginning, featured air-cooled rear-engine configurations (like the Beetle), rare for other car manufacturers, but producing automobiles that are very well balanced.|$|E
