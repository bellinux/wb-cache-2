5|$|Benfica opened April in Azores against Santa Clara on the 6th. Lacking attacking options, {{the team}} was unable to score and ended with a goalless draw; they {{remained}} ahead of Porto only with the goal <b>difference.</b> <b>On</b> 14 April, Benfica received Paços de Ferreira at home. With two goals {{in the first half}} and another two in the second, the team won 4–0 and remained in third. A week later, Benfica visited Sporting for the second Derby de Lisboa of the season. Despite a first score by Jankauskas, a mistake by Armando Sá allowed Sporting's Jardel to score from the penalty spot. With its third draw in just one month, Benfica was overtaken by Porto in the league table, dropping to fourth. On the 28th, Benfica hosted Boavista, knowing that by beating them, they would award the league title to Sporting. The meet ended with a 2–1 win for Benfica, after Mantorras took advantage of an error from Bassey William Andem in the 81st minute, confirming the second title in three years for Sporting.|$|E
5|$|In {{a survey}} {{released}} by the Pew Research Center in April 2007, viewers who watch both The Colbert Report and The Daily Show {{tend to be more}} knowledgeable about news than audiences of other news sources. Approximately 54% of The Colbert Report and The Daily Show viewers scored in the high knowledge range, followed by Jim Lehrer's program at 53% and Bill O'Reilly's program at 51%, significantly higher than the 34% of network morning show viewers. The survey shows that changing news formats have not made much <b>difference</b> <b>on</b> how much the public knows about national and international affairs, but adds that there is no clear connection between news formats and what audiences know. The Project for Excellence in Journalism released a content analysis report suggesting that The Daily Show comes close to providing the complete daily news.|$|E

25|$|In 2000, {{researchers}} Roberto Colom and Francisco J. Abad {{conducted a}} large study of 10,475 adults on five IQ tests {{taken from the}} Primary Mental Abilities and found negligible or no significant sex differences. The tests conducted were on vocabulary, spatial rotation, verbal fluency and inductive reasoning. Roberto Colom in 2002 found that males' IQs were 3.16 points higher on the WAIS III test, but {{that there was no}} <b>difference</b> <b>on</b> the general intelligence factor (g) and therefore explained the differences as due to non-g factors such as specific group factors and test specificity. Responding to findings by Richard Lynn in 2002, researchers Roberto Colom and Oscar Garcia Lopez proposed that g factor is the variance of correlation among different IQ tests and not the sum of group scores published by Lynn in his studies. So measuring variance of Colom's study of 4,072 high school graduates, they found that females outperform males on the inductive Primary Mental Abilities reasoning test, males outperform females on the Raven's Progressive Matrices and that there is no <b>difference</b> <b>on</b> the Culture-Fair intelligence test and therefore concluded no difference in general intelligence. Using multi-group covariance and mean group structure analysis in 2006, researchers Sophie van der Sluis, Conor V. Dolan and Roberto Colom found that g factor couldn't explain any sex differences on the WAIS III. Later that year in another study, the same researchers concluded that sex differences on WAIS are due to primary factors or broad stratum abilities like working memory and perceptual organization not g factor. A study conducted by Jim Flynn and Lilia Rossi-Case (2011) found that men and women achieved roughly equal IQ scores on Raven's Progressive Matrices after reviewing recent standardization samples in five modernized nations. In 2010, researcher Emily Savage-McGlynn proposed that inconsistent results in sex differences are due to opportunity samples rather than samples that represent the general population. After a study with a nationally representative sample of 926 participants in the UK, no sex difference was found in the Raven's Progressive Matrices test.|$|E

25|$|On April 30, 2010, McDonnell {{authorized}} issuing $493 {{million in}} transportation bonds in May 2010 {{and an additional}} $1.493 billion over the five years to finance previously approved transportation projects. The bonds {{were a part of}} a transportation package enacted three years previously, but had not been issued while Republican State Delegate Robert Marshall filed a lawsuit challenging the their constitutionality while certain transportation notes issued during the Gilmore Administration had not yet been paid off. Critics noted that Virginia lacked a revenue source to amortize the bonds. On December 9, 2010, McDonnell announced a revised transportation funding plan which included both $1.8 billion in bonds that had been approved in 2007, as well as an additional $1.1 billion which he proposed to pay back from future federal transportation funds. He also proposed to spend $150 million of the 2009–2010 budget surplus and $250 million in reserves to protect against gasoline tax revenue shortfalls. On January 9, 2011, McDonnell proposed funding projects to address traffic congestion in Northern Virginia and Hampton roads by diverting 0.25% of the sales tax collected in those areas from the General Fund into the transportation fund. Legislation was required to implement the proposal, and Democrats responded that the revenues were needed in the General Fund for schools and public safety and that the projected revenues were insufficient to make a <b>difference</b> <b>on</b> highway needs.|$|E
