5|$|Throughout the mid-1990s, the Daddies toured constantly, {{carrying}} out six cross-country tours in 1996 alone following {{the release of}} their third independent album, <b>Kids</b> <b>on</b> the Street. A remarkable musical departure from their previous work, <b>Kids</b> <b>on</b> the Street was primarily a showcase of the ska influences which had gradually become {{a major part of}} the Daddies' live sound, forgoing their usual brassy funk and swing-based eclecticism in favor of guitar-driven ska, rock and punk. Distributed by noted indie label Caroline Records, <b>Kids</b> <b>on</b> the Street wound up becoming the Daddies' then-most successful release, remaining on The Rockets Retail Sales Top Twenty for over seven months and eventually working its way onto Rolling Stones Alternative Charts.|$|E

5|$|In 1998, James Dewees {{recorded}} his first solo album under the pseudonym Reggie and the Full Effect. While Dewees wrote the songs himself, he asked Matt Pryor and Rob Pope to help record {{some of the}} instrumentals. The resulting album, Greatest Hits 1984-1987 leaned heavily {{on the use of}} synthesizer keyboards for its sound. Their work together on the Reggie and the Full Effect album led Pryor to invite Dewees to collaborate with The Get Up <b>Kids</b> <b>on</b> Red Letter Day, a five-track EP produced by Ed Rose to fulfill their two-record deal with Doghouse. The cleaner, more focused sound of the EP provided the chance to experiment with the inclusion of keyboards and acts as a sonic bridge between the raw sound of Four Minute Mile and the more dynamic, produced style of their next studio album.|$|E

5|$|Static Shock was an {{extremely}} popular show, granting its new renewal for a second season just a month after its debut. As of December 2000, it was the highest-rated pre-teen—from 2 to 11 years—show among all networks on its timeslot, and the third best on the Kids' WB! lineup. From its debut to July 2003, the show secured the second post among boys aged 6 to 11 years. Ratings increased after Richie's character obtained superhero powers; McDuffie affirmed {{that this is what}} secured the renewal for a new season. Indeed, the show's third season was its most popular and was the second best-rated Saturday morning program among boys aged 6 to 11 years, and tweens and male tweens aged 9 to 14.
