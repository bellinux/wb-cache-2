Spin-systems are well-defined models, for which, in special cases, exact properties may be derived.

40|$|The rise of China and {{relative}} {{decline of the}} United States have caused a heated debate on a possible power shift in the Asia-Pacific. Whether China and the U.

This necessitates a thorough study {{on the future of}} China-U. <b>S.</b> <b>relations</b> and how they will affect the strategic chessboard in the region. This Thesis examines the possible scenarios of China-U. <b>S.</b> <b>relations</b> by 2030. It argues that while the nature of China-U. <b>S.</b> <b>relations</b> is characterized by strategic competition, increasing interdependence between the two countries requires them to cooperate and co-exist with each other. If current trends continue, by 2030, the most likely scenarios for China-U. <b>S.</b> <b>relations</b> will, in descending order, be a continued China-U. S. strategic competition in peaceful co-existence, a new Cold War, a G- 2 style condominium, and a predominance by China over the U. S. in the Asia-Pacific. The Thesis also finds that unlike the past, China-U. <b>S.</b> <b>relations</b> will be increasingly influenced by external factors and unpredictable events or crises. Each of the scenarios in China-U. <b>S.</b> <b>relations</b> will have a different but equally profound impact on the security architecture in the region, especially the ASEAN-led mechanisms for regional security cooperation.

This liquid undergoes a continuous pair-unbinding transition to a more conventional Luttinger liquid region obtained by polarizing the system above the Haldane gap region. This pair-unbinding transition is shown to be in the Ising universality class on top of a Luttinger liquid, leading to an effective central charge 3 / 2. We also revisit the nature of the partially polarized Luttinger liquid around and above the Uimin-Lai-Sutherland point.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work is to enhance the {{understanding}} regular algebraic semigroups by considering the structural influence of Green 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>relations.</b> There will be three chief topics of discussion. Green 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>relations</b> and the Adherence order on reductive monoids Renner’s conjecture on regular irreducible semigroups with zero a Green’s relation inspired construction of regular algebraic semigroups Primarily, we will explore the combinatorial and geometric nature of reductive monoids with zero. Such monoids have a decomposition {{in terms of a}} Borel subgroup, called the Bruhat decomposition, which produces a finite monoid, R, the Renner monoid. We will explore the structure of R by way of Green 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>relations.</b> In particular, we will be exploring the nature of the Adherence order poset combined with J-, R-, L-, and H-classes. From reductive monoids we broaden the impact of Green 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>relations</b> and explore regular algebraic semigroups. Specifically, we resolve Renner’s conjecture and show that the supports, Xl = J/R and Xr = J/L are projective varieties. Spurred on by the result, we use invariant theory to generalise the Rees matrix construction for algebraic semigroups to construct irreducible regular semigroups with 0. Our construction will start with specified maximal classes, Re, Le, and He and reconstruct an entire semigroup. In a lengthy example, we will use some of our previous combinatorial results to apply the construction to a natural generalisation of determinantal varieties. Highlights include the unique 2 ̆ 2 vanilla form 2 ̆ 2 decomposition for elements of the Renner monoid (Definition 5. 36), a proof of Renner 2 ̆ 7 s conjecture on the projectiveness of supports for irreducible regular semigroups with zero (Theorem 8. 40), and the construction of irreducible regular semigroups from prespecified maximal R- and L-classes (Definition 9. 6) ...|$|R
