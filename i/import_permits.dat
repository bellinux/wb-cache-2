25|$|When the US Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 {{effectively}} {{stopped the}} capture of Pacific orcas, exhibitors found an area more tolerant of killer whale captures in Iceland. Icelandic herring fishermen had traditionally seen killer whales as competitors for their catch, and sale of live killer whales promised a large new source of income. 48 live killer whales captured in Icelandic waters were exported to marine parks between 1976 and 1988. The capture process was based on luring the orcas by dumping leftovers from herring fishing {{in front of the}} pod, capturing the killer whales in a purse seine net, selecting desirable animals and hauling them on board in a specially designed frame, then placing them in foam-lined boxes full of seawater. However, restrictions on US killer whale <b>import</b> <b>permits</b> and advances in captive breeding programs meant that the market never became as large as expected. Growing concern from conservationists and animal rights activists has caused the Icelandic government {{to limit the number of}} orcas that may be captured each year.|$|E
500|$|All cacti are {{included}} in Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), which [...] "lists species that are not necessarily now threatened with extinction but that may become so unless trade is closely controlled." [...] Control is exercised by making international trade in most specimens of cacti illegal unless permits have been issued, at least for exports. Some exceptions are allowed, e.g., for [...] "naturalized or artificially propagated plants". Some cacti, such as all Ariocarpus and Discocactus species, {{are included}} in the more restrictive Appendix I, used for the [...] "most endangered" [...] species. These may only be moved between countries for scientific purposes, and only then when accompanied by both export and <b>import</b> <b>permits.</b>|$|E
2500|$|On his retirement, Mahathir {{was named}} a Grand Commander of the Order of the Defender of the Realm, {{allowing}} him to adopt the title of [...] "Tun". He pledged to leave politics [...] "completely", rejecting an emeritus role in Abdullah's cabinet. Abdullah immediately made his mark as a quieter and less adversarial premier. With much stronger religious credentials than Mahathir, {{he was able to}} beat back PAS's surge in the 1999 election, and lead the Barisan Nasional in the 2004 election to its biggest win ever, taking 199 of 219 parliamentary seats. Mahathir is the CEO, Chairman and hence a senior adviser to many flagship Malaysian companies, such as Proton, Perdana Leadership Foundation and Malaysia's government-owned oil and gas company Petronas, etc. Mahathir and Abdullah had a major fallout over Proton in 2005. Proton's chief executive, a Mahathir ally, had been sacked by the company's board. With Abdullah's blessing, the company then sold one of the company's prize assets, the motorcycle company MV Agusta, which was bought on Mahathir's advice. Mahathir also criticised the awarding of <b>import</b> <b>permits</b> for foreign cars, which he claimed were causing Proton's domestic sales to suffer, and attacked Abdullah for cancelling the construction of a second causeway between Malaysia and Singapore. Mahathir complained that his views were not getting sufficient airing by the Malaysian press, the freedom of which he had curtailed while prime minister: he had been named one of the [...] "Ten Worst Enemies of the Press" [...] by the Committee to Protect Journalists for his restrictions on newspapers and occasional imprisonment of journalists. He turned to the blogosphere in response, writing a column for Malaysiakini, a online media news website , and starting his own blog. He unsuccessfully sought election from his local party division to be a delegate to UMNO's general assembly in 2006, where he planned to initiate a revolt against Abdullah's leadership of the party. After the 2008 election, in which UMNO lost its two-thirds majority in Parliament, Mahathir resigned from the party. Abdullah was replaced by his deputy, Najib Razak, in 2009, a move that prompted Mahathir to rejoin the party.|$|E

The Japanese use administrative guidance to buffer market swings, anticipate market developments, and enhance market competition.|$|E
