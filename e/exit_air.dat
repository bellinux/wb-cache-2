40|$|This is {{the seventh}} Quarterly Report for this project. The {{background}} and technical {{justification for the}} project are described, including potential benefits of reducing fuel moisture, prior to firing in a pulverized coal boiler. Coal drying experiments were performed with lignite and Powder River Basin coals {{to determine the effects}} of inlet air moisture level on the equilibrium relationship between coal moisture and <b>exit</b> <b>air</b> relative humidity and temperature. The results show that, for lignite, there is a slight dependence of equilibrium moisture on inlet humidity level. However, the equilibrium relationship for PRB coal appears to be independent of inlet air humidity level. The specific equilibrium model used for computing lignite coal dryer performance has a significant effect on the prediction accuracy for <b>exit</b> <b>air</b> relative humidity; but its effects on predicted coal product moisture, <b>exit</b> <b>air</b> temperature and specific humidity are minimal. Analyses were performed to determine the effect of lignite product moisture on unit performance for a high temperature drying system. With this process design, energy for drying is obtained from the hot flue gas entering the air preheater and the hot circulating cooling water leaving the steam condenser. Comparisons were made to the same boiler operating with lignite which had been dried off-site...|$|E

Fine glass beads of mean diameter 125 ?µm were used as the bed material.

A simple model based on the available correlations for bubble-cloud and cloud-dense interchange (two-region model) was used to predict the overall mass transfer coefficient.

40|$|The {{effect of}} bed hydrodynamics, {{particle}} and feed slurry properties on maximum slurry feed rate and elutriation during spouted bed coating of seed was studied. Experiments were {{performed in a}} 0. 15 m diameter laboratory batch spouted bed using 13 different seed types and two fertilizer coatings - monocalcium phosphate (MCP) and tricalcium phosphate (TCP) - with a methylcellulose binder. Gas superficial velocity, bed height and temperature, orifice size, coating strength and flow rate were varied during experiments. The slurry feed rate is limited by spout collapse caused by the formation of embryo agglomerates in the spray zone {{at the bottom of}} the spout. The formation of agglomerates is determined by a balance between binding forces which are related to seed and coating properties, and shearing forces which are determined by bed hydrodynamics. The spout collapses before <b>exit</b> <b>air</b> from the bed is completely saturated with water. The relative humidity of the <b>exit</b> <b>air</b> at spout collapse increases with increasing excess air velocity and particle size, decreases with increasing feed slurry viscosity and is independent of bed height and temperature. Attrition of newly formed coating is the main mechanism to generate elutriated fines. The elutriation rate increases linearly with feed slurry rate and with gas velocity to the third power. It is a strong function of coating strength. Two attrition models - the inlet gas kinetic energy model and the excess energy model - were examined. The inlet gas kinetic energy model best explains the elutriation data from these experiments at constant orifice size (25 mm). However, when the inlet orifice size is decreased, the increase in elutriation is less than predicted by the increase in inlet gas kinetic energy. The mechanistic models used in this work may also be relevant to other spouted bed granulation and coating processes...|$|E

40|$|Solar {{energy is}} one of the {{renewable}} energy sources which can be received more by designing more accurate systems. In this article a flat solar collector with the area of 2 × 1 m 2 and thickness of 0. 5 mm, made of steel iron in the form of venetian blinds (in order to increase exposure to air) has been used. The surface of absorber plate was black and for insulation of the body of the collector glass wool has been used with 5 cm thickness. One of the essential problems of air solar collectors is that the temperature of the <b>exiting</b> <b>air</b> temperature from the collector is variable during the day and their efficiency is low in the last hours of the day and also when the weather suddenly gets cloudy. In this study, to keep constant the <b>exiting</b> <b>air</b> from the collector consistent in the desired limits, a control system is designed and constructed by applying photovoltaic cells, a microcontroller (AVR) and temperature sensors (LM 35). Three temperature sensors were installed in the exit of the collector.

40|$|Dimensional {{restrictions}} in electronic equipment {{have resulted in}} miniaturization of many existing cooling technologies. In addition to this, cooling solutions are required to dissipate increased thermal loads to maintain component reliability. Axial fans are widely used in electronics cooling to meet such thermal demands. However, if the extent of non-uniform heat transfer rates, produced by highly three-dimensional air patterns is unknown in the design stages, premature component failure may result. The current study highlights these non-uniformities in heat transfer coefficient, using infrared thermography of a miniature axial fan impinging air on a flat plate. Fan rotational speed and distance from the flat plate are varied to encompass heat transfer phenomena resultant from complex <b>exit</b> <b>air</b> flow distribution. Local peaks in heat transfer coefficient {{have been shown to}} be directly related to the air flow and fan motor support interaction. Optimum locations for discrete heat source positioning have been identified which are a function of fan to plate spacing and independent of fan rotational speed when the Reynolds number effect is not apparent. © 2010 Elsevier Inc...|$|E
