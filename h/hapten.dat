5|$|Heparin occurs {{naturally}} {{in the human}} body, but the development of HIT antibodies suggests heparin may act as a <b>hapten,</b> and thus be targeted by the immune system. In HIT, the immune system forms antibodies against heparin when it is bound to a protein called platelet factor 4 (PF4). These antibodies are usually of the IgG class and their development usually takes about five days. However, {{those who have been}} exposed to heparin {{in the last few months}} may still have circulating IgG, as IgG-type antibodies generally continue to be produced even when their precipitant has been removed. This is similar to immunity against certain microorganisms, with the difference that the HIT antibody does not persist more than three months. HIT antibodies have been found in individuals with thrombocytopenia and thrombosis who had no prior exposure to heparin, but the majority are found in people who are receiving heparin.|$|E
25|$|Another non-food protein reaction, urushiol-induced contact dermatitis, {{originates}} after {{contact with}} poison ivy, eastern poison oak, western poison oak, or poison sumac. Urushiol, {{which is not}} itself a protein, acts as a <b>hapten</b> and chemically reacts with, binds to, and changes the shape of integral membrane proteins on exposed skin cells. The immune system does not recognize the affected cells as normal parts of the body, causing a T-cell-mediated immune response. Of these poisonous plants, sumac is the most virulent. The resulting dermatological response to the reaction between urushiol and membrane proteins includes redness, swelling, papules, vesicles, blisters, and streaking.|$|E

40|$|The {{coupling}} of <b>haptens</b> to carrier proteins {{is required}} for the generation of antihapten antibody response, To date, different polypeptides (such as gelatin, albumin, and keyhole limpet hemocyanin) have been used to increase the immune response against <b>haptens,</b> Different methods of conjugation have also been used to increase the specificity of the antibody response, Our results, obtained through an analysis of the antibody response at both the polyclonal and the monoclonal levels, show that carrier proteins specifically modulate the antibody titer, the specificity of the response, the fusion efficiency, and the number of specific clones, Moreover, the affinity constants of both serum and randomly selected hybridomas directed against different <b>haptens</b> {{have been found to be}} exclusively modulated by carrier proteins, In addition, the results show that the carrier protein should be selected considering its possible physicochemical interaction with <b>haptens,</b> Data obtained suggested that any carrier is suitable for hydrophilic <b>haptens,</b> while the choice of the carrier for hydrophobic <b>haptens</b> is critical in obtaining a specific immune response, The use of specific carriers allowed the production of highly specific antibodies: even IgMs, obtained by using these carriers, were able to specifically react with hydrophobic haptens; the case of some IgM monoclonal antibodies specifically reacting with protoporphyrin IX is reported...|$|R

5000|$|<b>Hapten</b> {{inhibition}} or [...] "semi-hapten" [...] is the {{inhibition of}} a type III hypersensitivity response. In inhibition, free <b>hapten</b> molecules bind with antibodies toward that molecule without causing the immune response, leaving fewer antibodies left to bind to the immunogenic hapten-protein adduct. An example of a <b>hapten</b> inhibitor is dextran 1, which is a small fraction (1 kilodalton) of the entire dextran complex, which is enough to bind anti-dextran antibodies, but insufficient to result {{in the formation of}} immune complexes and resultant immune responses.|$|E
50|$|A {{well-known}} {{example of}} a <b>hapten</b> is urushiol, which is the toxin found in poison ivy. When absorbed through the skin from a poison ivy plant, urushiol undergoes oxidation in the skin cells to generate the actual <b>hapten,</b> a reactive molecule called a quinone, which then reacts with skin proteins to form <b>hapten</b> adducts. Usually, the first exposure causes only sensitization, {{in which there is}} a proliferation of effector T-cells. After a subsequent, second exposure, the proliferated T-cells can become activated, generating an immune reaction that produces typical blisters of a poison ivy exposure.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Hapten,</b> small {{molecules}} that can elicit an immune response under certain conditions.|$|E
50|$|An {{explicit}} {{example is}} a <b>hapten.</b> Haptens are low-molecular-weight compounds that may be bound by antibodies, but cannot elicit an immune response. Consequently, the haptens themselves are nonimmunogenic and they cannot evoke an immune response until they bind with a larger carrier immunogenic molecule. The hapten-carrier complex, unlike free <b>hapten,</b> can act as an immunogen and can induce an immune response.|$|E
50|$|Haptens {{are small}} {{molecules}} that elicit an immune response only when {{attached to a}} large carrier such as a protein; the carrier may be one that also does not elicit an immune response by itself. (In general, only large molecules, infectious agents, or insoluble foreign matter can elicit an immune response in the body.)Once the body has generated antibodies to a hapten-carrier adduct, the small-molecule <b>hapten</b> may {{also be able to}} bind to the antibody, but it will usually not initiate an immune response; usually only the hapten-carrier adduct can do this. Sometimes the small-molecule <b>hapten</b> can even block immune response to the hapten-carrier adduct by preventing the adduct from binding to the antibody, a process called <b>hapten</b> inhibition.|$|E

40|$|Clinical {{outcomes}} of anti-nicotine vaccines may be improved through enhancements in serum antibody affinity and concentration. Two strategies were explored to improve vaccine efficacy in outbred mice: {{the use of}} enantiopure <b>haptens</b> and formulation of a bivalent vaccine. Vaccines incorporating natural (-) nicotine <b>haptens</b> improved relative antibody affinities > 10 -fold over (+) <b>haptens,</b> stimulated a two-fold boost in nicotine serum binding capacity, and following injection with 3 cigarette equivalents of nicotine, prevented {{a larger proportion of}} nicotine (> 85 %) from reaching the brain. The activity of a bivalent vaccine containing (-) 3 'AmNic and (-) 1 'SNic <b>haptens</b> was then compared to dose-matched monovalent groups. It was confirmed that antisera generated by these structurally distinct <b>haptens</b> have minimal cross-reactivity and stimulate different B cell populations. Equivalent antibody affinities were detected between the three groups, but the bivalent group showed two-fold higher titers and an additive increase in nicotine serum binding capacity as compared to the monovalent groups. Mice immunized with the bivalent formulation also performed better in a nicotine challenge experiment, and prevented > 85 % of a nicotine dose equivalent to 12 cigarettes from reaching the brain. Overall, enantiopure conjugate vaccines appear to improve serum antibody affinity, while multivalent formulations increase total antibody concentration. These findings may help improve the performance of future clinical candidate vaccines...|$|R

50|$|Different {{indirect}} {{methods can}} be employed to achieve high degrees of specificity and sensitivity. First, two-step protocols are often used to avoid the cross-reaction between the immunolabeling of multiple primary and secondary antibody mixtures, where secondary fragment antigen-binding antibodies are frequently used. Secondly, haptenylated primary antibodies can be used, where the secondary antibody can recognize the associated <b>hapten.</b> The <b>hapten</b> is covalently linked to the primary antibody by succinyl imidesters or conjugated IgG Fc-specific Fab sections. Lastly, primary monoclonal antibodies that have different Ig isotypes can be detected by specific secondary antibodies that are against the isotype of interest.|$|E
40|$|Allergic contact {{dermatitis}} (ACD) to strong experimental <b>haptens</b> is mediated by specific CD 8 + T cells. Here, {{we show that}} similar mechanisms occur for weak <b>haptens,</b> which comprise {{the vast majority of}} chemicals responsible for human ACD. We used a model of ACD, that is, the contact hypersensitivity reaction, to test for the allergenicity of three weak <b>haptens</b> involved in fragrance allergy. ACD to weak <b>haptens</b> could not be induced in normal mice. In contrast, mice acutely depleted in CD 4 + T cells developed a typical ACD reaction to the three weak fragrance allergens that peaked 24 hours after challenge. Priming of CD 8 + T cells was observed in draining lymph nodes 5 days after sensitization and development of ACD was associated with the infiltration of activated CD 8 + T cells in the challenged skin. CD 8 + T cells were effectors of the ACD reaction as in vivo treatment with depleting anti-CD 8 mAbs abrogated the ACD responses and as purified CD 8 + T cells could adoptively transfer ACD to naive recipients. In conclusion, our data demonstrate a dominant role of CD 8 + T cells as initiators of ACD to weak <b>haptens,</b> and suggest that CD 8 + T cells may represent potential targets for preventing or treating ACD...|$|R
40|$|Small {{molecular}} weight chemicals may irritate tissues via the induction {{of the production}} of various proinflammatory and chemotactic molecules. The structure of these irritants is heterogenous, as is the pattern of their effects. Chemicals are potentially allergenic (i. e. <b>haptens)</b> when {{they are able to}} bind proteins such as immune response molecules. Sensitization will occur when these <b>haptens</b> additionally induce irritation resulting from an intrinsic adjuvant's activity of the chemical. In most cases <b>haptens</b> induce the activation of hapten-specific T cells with a type 1 cytokine profile mediating delayed hypersensitivity. A limited number of <b>haptens</b> induce the production of type 2 cytokines in T cells and, consequently, allergic reactions after inhalation. Similarly, inhaled proteins become allergenic when they activate protein allergen-specific T cells producing type 2 cytokines. In many individuals this cytokine profile is associated with atopy. It must be expected, however, that a type 2 cytokine profile can also be inflicted by the action of various adjuvants types, such as biologically active small {{molecular weight}} chemicals and proteins (i. e. enzymes) and microorganisms, thereby promoting allergic reaction...|$|R

50|$|There are {{two models}} for this: the <b>hapten</b> {{model and the}} {{autoantibody}} model.

Antibodies are created against the protein-drug complex, leading to the destructive sequence described above. The autoantibody model proposes that, through a mechanism not yet understood, certain drugs will cause antibodies to be made against red blood cells which again leads to the same destructive sequence.|$|E

40|$|The binding of {{divalent}} <b>haptens</b> to IgE-class antibodies leads predominantly {{to their}} oligomerization into open and closed dimers. Kinetics {{of the open}} dimer formation was investigated by fluorescence titrations of Fab fragments of monoclonal DNP-specific IgE antibodies with divalent <b>haptens</b> having different spacer length (gamma = 14 - 130 A). Binding was monitored by quenching of intrinsic tryptophan emission of the Fab. Addition of divalent <b>haptens</b> with short spacers (gamma = 14 - 21 A) to the Fabs at rates larger than a distinct threshold value caused a significant decrease of Fab-binding site occupation in the initial phase of the titration. This finding was interpreted to reflect a nonequilibrium state of hapten-Fab-binding. Such nonequilibrium titrations were analyzed by inserting a kinetic model into a theory of antibody aggregation as presented by Dembo and Golstein (Histamine release due to bivalent penicilloyl <b>haptens.</b> 1978. J. Immunol. 121, 345). Fitting of this model to the fluorescence titrations yielded dissociation rate constants of 7. 8 x 10 (- 3) s- 1 and 6 x 10 (- 3) s- 1 for the Fab dimers formed by the flexible divalent <b>haptens</b> N alpha, N epsilon-di(dinitrophenyl) -L-lysine (gamma = 16 A) and bis(N beta- 2, 4 -dinitrophenyl-alanyl) -meso-diamino-succinate (gamma = 21 A). Making the simplifying assumption that a single step binding equilibrium prevails, the corresponding dimer formation rate constants were calculated to be 1. 9 x 10 (5) M- 1 s- 1 and 1. 1 x 10 (4) M- 1 s- 1, respectively. In contrast, all <b>haptens</b> with spacers longer than 40 A (i. e., bis(N alpha- 2, 4 -dinitrophenyl-tri-D-alanyl) - 1, 7 -diamino-heptane, and di(N epsilon- 2, 4 -dinitrophenyl) - 6 -aminohexanoate-aspartyl-(prolyl) n-L-l ysyl (n = 24, 27, 33) exhibit a relative fast dimerization rate of the Fab fragments (greater than 7 x 10 (6) M- 1 s- 1). These observations were interpreted as being caused by orientational constraints set by the limited solid angle of the reaction between the macromolecular reactants. Thus, ligands having better access to the binding site would react faster...|$|R
