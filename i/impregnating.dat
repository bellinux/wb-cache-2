5|$|The rose petal's micro- and {{nanostructures}} {{are larger}} in scale {{than those of}} the lotus leaf, which allows the liquid film to impregnate the texture. However, as seen in Figure 9, the liquid can enter the larger-scale grooves, but it cannot enter into the smaller grooves. This is known as the Cassie <b>impregnating</b> wetting regime. Since the liquid can wet the larger-scale grooves, the adhesive force between the water and solid is very high. This explains why the water droplet will not fall off even if the petal is tilted at an angle or turned upside down. This effect will fail if the droplet has a volume larger than 10 µl because the balance between weight and surface tension is surpassed.|$|E
5|$|Sergeant Lope (Demián Bichir) is {{the ranking}} {{military}} officer aboard the Covenant {{who is married}} to Sergeant Hallett. Lope leads the excursion on the planet's surface to the crashed Engineer ship. On the journey back to the lander, Lope notices Hallett's condition deteriorating, which alarms him. Upon reaching the lander, the ship explodes and a Neomorph attacks while another bursts from his husband's throat. A Neomorph attacks Lope when David intervenes and leads the survivors to his base, where Lope discovers Shaw's corpse. He is attacked by a Facehugger, but he is quickly and seemingly saved by Cole, who manages to cut it off him, though his face is severely burned by acid in the process. As Cole is killed by a now mature Alien, Lope escapes with the other survivors to the cargo lander. Aboard Covenant, Lope receives medical treatment, but dies when an Alien erupts from his chest, revealing that despite the short time that the Facehugger was on him, it succeeded in <b>impregnating</b> him.|$|E
5|$|Varno said he {{received}} uncredited assistance from {{his friends and}} fellow screenwriters Jerome Bixby and Harold Jacob Smith, the latter of whom won an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay for the film The Defiant Ones (1958). Varno ran lines and ideas by both men and sought advice. Smith in particular inspired lines for the speech made by the monster {{at the end of}} the film, in which the creature discusses how the human characters consider him the embodiment of evil simply because he is different from them. Varno said much of that dialogue from Smith, however, ended up getting cut from the final film. One of the primary themes of the film, as embodied in John Corcoran's attempts to defend the alien creature, was that simply because someone or something is ugly or different does not necessarily make it evil. However, the script also followed a common trait of most horror films of the 1950s that even somewhat understandable monsters are not entirely sympathetic, and the Blood Beast creature proves itself evil by <b>impregnating</b> Corcoran against his will and pursuing world domination.|$|E
40|$|The {{focus of}} this {{investigation}} {{is the development of}} a solvent <b>impregnated</b> resin for phenol removal from dilute aqueous solutions. Using a solvent <b>impregnated</b> resin (SIR) eliminates the problem of emulsification encountered in liquid-liquid extraction. <b>Impregnated</b> MPP particles and <b>impregnated</b> XAD 16 particles are successfully used for phenol extraction. <b>Impregnated</b> MPP particles are preferred, as <b>impregnated</b> XAD 16 particles show less mechanical strength and are more expensive. <b>Impregnated</b> MPP particles perform better compared to other synthetic adsorbents and basic ion exchangers. The maximum phenol capacity of <b>impregnated</b> MPP particles with 0. 99 mol Cyanex 923 kg- 1 SIR is 4. 1 mol kg- 1 SIR (386 mg g- 1 SIR) and of MPP particles containing 1. 47 mol Cyanex 923 kg- 1 SIR it is 5. 08 mol kg- 1 SIR (478 mg g- 1 SIR). The regenerability of <b>impregnated</b> MPP particles is easy and complete, and the particles are stable during several cycles. The equilibrium constants for the extraction of phenol are determined as Kchem = 37 L mol- 1 and Kphys = 18 (mol L- 1) (mol L- 1) - 1. With these values the SIR isotherms can be satisfactorily described. The results indicate that SIR technology is a promising alternative for the conventional phenol removal technologies at low phenol concentration levels...|$|R

The results obtained were as follows: (1) The equilibrium moisture content (EMC) of <b>impregnated</b> sitka spruce decreased to some extent compared with untreated wood. (2) Frequency dependencies of tanδ a about 400 – 8000 Hz showed that <b>impregnated</b> wood has much lower tan δ than untreated wood at around 9 % mois ture content (MC), except for the high-frequency region. At high relative humidity, <b>impregnated</b> wood has a minimum tanδ (at around 4000 Hz); and at other frequency ranges the tanδ of <b>impregnated</b> wood did not differ considerably from that of untreated wood. (3) The apparent activation energy of the mechanical relaxation process (ΔE) concerned with adsorbed water molecules was higher for <b>impregnated</b> specimens than for untreated ones at moderately high relative humidity, whereas at high relative humidity the difference was not observed. Based on these results, it is thought that the tanδ of <b>impregnated</b> wood decreased at low rela tive humidity because of the formation of direct hydrogen bonds between <b>impregnated</b> extractives and wood components.

After awakening from cryosleep near LV-223, he introduces the purpose of the mission with Shaw. While the Prometheus flies over the moon, Holloway spots an artificial arrangement of structures and directs the ship to land near one. He goes with the first expedition crew to the concealed Juggernaut, discovers that the air is clearer than anywhere on Earth and removes his helmet. After Shaw retrieves a preserved Engineer head, the expedition is informed of an incoming storm and Holloway {{and the rest of the}} crew return to the Prometheus. Disappointed by the Engineers' apparent extinction, he sulks and berates Shaw for still being a Christian. David brings Holloway a drink, and they discuss the merits of creating beings; he tainted the drink with a minute organism from a cylinder he brought from he structure, infecting Holloway. Holloway has sex with Shaw shortly afterwards, <b>impregnating</b> her with an alien embryo. After seeing a small, extraterrestrial parasite in his eye, Holloway returns to the Engineer ship and becomes ill.

With Branson's death {{as a result of}} the {{neutrino}} flair from the nearby star, Christopher becomes the captain of Covenant, though he perceives his command as being questioned by Daniels and the other crew members. When Shaw's transmission is received from the habitable Engineer home world, Christopher orders Covenant to divert to the planet, though his judgment is met with protests from Daniels. After leading a ground expedition to the crashed Engineer ship, Christopher returns to the lander to see it explode. Christopher accepts David's aid on behalf of the survivors and accompanies David back to his base. He searches for Rosenthal, who he finds decapitated, along with David communicating with the Neomorph that killed her. Christopher kills the Neomorph and holds David at gunpoint, demanding an explanation for his activities. David leads him to his makeshift laboratory, as well as a hatchery, where he keeps a number of Alien eggs. David goads Christopher into approaching an egg, which results in a Facehugger attacking and <b>impregnating</b> him. Christopher is awoken a short time later by David, only to have the first Alien chestburster erupt from his chest, killing him.|$|E
5|$|In Egyptian mythology, the sun's {{emergence}} {{from the}} horizon each morning is likened to Ra's birth, {{an event that}} revitalizes him and {{the order of the}} cosmos. Ra emerges from the body of a goddess who represents the sky—usually Nut. Depictions of the rising sun often show Ra as a child contained within the solar disk. In this context, the Egyptologist Lana Troy suggests, the disk may represent the womb from which he is born or the placenta that emerges with him. The Eye of Ra can also {{take the form of a}} goddess, which according to Troy is both the mother who brings Ra forth from her womb and a sister who is born alongside him like a placenta. Ra was sometimes said to enter the body of the sky goddess at sunset, <b>impregnating</b> her and setting the stage for his rebirth at sunrise. Consequently, the Eye, as womb and mother of the child form of Ra, is also the consort of the adult Ra. The adult Ra, likewise, is the father of the Eye who is born at sunrise. The Eye is thus a feminine counterpart to Ra's masculine creative power, part of a broader Egyptian tendency to express creation and renewal through the metaphor of sexual reproduction. Ra gives rise to his daughter, the Eye, who in turn gives rise to him, her son, in a cycle of constant regeneration.|$|E
