2500|$|The {{instrumentation}} {{needed to}} perform capillary electrophoresis is relatively simple. [...] A basic schematic of a capillary electrophoresis system {{is shown in}} figure 1. [...] The system's main components are a sample vial, source and destination vials, a capillary, electrodes, [...] a high voltage power supply, a detector, and a data output and <b>handling</b> <b>device.</b> The source vial, destination vial and capillary are filled with an electrolyte such as an aqueous buffer solution. [...] To introduce the sample, the capillary inlet is placed into a vial containing the sample. [...] Sample is introduced into the capillary via capillary action, pressure, siphoning, or electrokinetically, and the capillary is then returned to the source vial. [...] The migration of the analytes is initiated by an electric field that is applied between the source and destination vials and is supplied to the electrodes by the high-voltage power supply. [...] In the most common mode of CE, all ions, positive or negative, are pulled through the capillary in the same direction by electroosmotic flow. [...] The analytes separate as they migrate due to their electrophoretic mobility, and are detected near the outlet end of the capillary. The output of the detector is sent to a data output and <b>handling</b> <b>device</b> such as an integrator or computer. The data is then displayed as an electropherogram, which reports detector response as a function of time. Separated chemical compounds appear as peaks with different retention times in an electropherogram. [...] Capillary electrophoresis was first combined with mass spectrometry by Richard D. Smith and coworkers, and provides extremely high sensitivity for the analysis of very small sample sizes. [...] Despite the very small sample sizes (typically only a few nanoliters of liquid are introduced into the capillary), high sensitivity and sharp peaks are achieved in part due to injection strategies that result in concentration of analytes into a narrow zone near the inlet of the capillary. [...] This is achieved in either pressure or electrokinetic injections simply by suspending the sample in a buffer of lower conductivity (e.g. lower salt concentration) than the running buffer. [...] A process called field-amplified sample stacking (a form of isotachophoresis) results in concentration of analyte in a narrow zone at the boundary between the low-conductivity sample and the higher-conductivity running buffer.|$|E

50|$|Ion beam {{analysis}} {{works on}} the basis that ion-atom interactions are produced by the introduction of ions to the sample being tested. Major interactions result in the emission of products that enable information regarding the number, type, distribution and structural arrangement of atoms to be collected. To use these interactions to determine sample composition a technique must be selected along with irradiation conditions and the detection system that will best isolate the radiation of interest providing the desired sensitivity and detection limits. The basic layout of a ion beam apparatus is an accelerator which produces an ion beam that is feed through an evacuated beam-transport tube to a beam <b>handling</b> <b>device.</b> This device isolates the ion species and charge of interest which then are transported through an evacuated beam-transport tube into the target chamber. This chamber is where the refined ion beam will come into contact with the sample and thus the resulting interactions can be observed. The configuration of the ion beam apparatus can be changed and made more complex with the incorporation of additional components. The techniques for ion beam analysis are designed for specific purposes. Some techniques and ion sources are shown in table 1. Detector types and arrangements for ion beam techniques are shown in table 2.|$|E
