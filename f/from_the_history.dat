5|$|Stalin {{reacted to}} the growing {{strength}} of Trotsky's supporters with a major political massacre of people within the Soviet Union, and the assassination of Trotsky's supporters and family abroad.

According to the historian Mario Kessler, Stalin's supporters turned to anti-semitism to whip up sentiment against Trotsky (as Trotsky was a Jew). Stalin's daughter later claimed that his fight with Trotsky laid the foundations for his later anti-semitic campaigns.|$|E

5|$|Aveni {{states that}} one of the {{strengths}} of the Brown methodology is that it can explore astronomies invisible to statistical analysis and offers the astronomy of the Incas as another example. The empire of the Incas was conceptually divided using ceques radial routes emanating from the capital at Cusco. Thus there are alignments in all directions which would suggest there is little of astronomical significance, However, ethnohistorical records show that the various directions do have cosmological and astronomical significance with various points in the landscape being significant at different times of the year. In eastern Asia archaeoastronomy has developed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>History</b> of Astronomy and much archaeoastronomy is searching for material correlates of the historical record. This is due to the rich historical record of astronomical phenomena which, in China, stretches back into the Han dynasty, in the second century BC.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the series, events {{converge}} with accepted history, when King Richard IV and {{his entire}} family are poisoned, allowing Henry Tudor to take the throne as King Henry VII. He then rewrites history, presenting Richard III as a monster, and eliminating Richard IV's reign <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>history</b> books. In reality, Richard, Duke of York, one of the Princes in the Tower, was only twelve years old (and perhaps two years dead) when the Battle of Bosworth Field took place in 1485, and thus too young to have had two adult sons. One notable anachronism is Edmund´s title, Duke of Edinburgh, as Scotland was an independent kingdom ruled by a different royal house from its inception in the ninth century until 1603 (with the exception of some periods during the turmoil of the Scottish Wars of Independence) though given that this is an alternate history, it is possible that Henry Tudor falsified the history of Scotland as well.|$|E
5|$|From 1877 to 1882, Jovanović honed {{his artistic}} skills at Vienna's Academy of Fine Arts, {{studying}} under Christian Griepenkerl and Leopold Müller, among others. In {{the early part}} of his career, he painted mostly Orientalist works, which were in high demand at the time. The paintings were based on his own experiences in the Balkans, the Middle East and North Africa, and assured his fame among art connoisseurs in the West. In the late 1880s, Jovanović turned to history painting, depicting scenes <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>history</b> of the Serb people, as seen in The Takovo Uprising (1888). Nevertheless, his reputation as an Orientalist meant that he was best known for these types of works in his first decade as a professional artist.|$|E

5|$|<b>From</b> <b>the</b> <b>history,</b> {{indicators}} of pulpal, periodontal, {{a combination of}} both, or non-dental causes can be observed. Periodontal pain is frequently localized to a particular tooth, which is made much worse by biting on the tooth, sudden in onset, and associated with bleeding and pain when brushing. More than one factor {{may be involved in}} the toothache. For example, a pulpal abscess (which is typically severe, spontaneous and localized) can cause periapical periodontitis (which results in pain on biting). Cracked tooth syndrome may also cause a combination of symptoms. Lateral periodontitis (which is usually without any thermal sensitivity and sensitive to biting) can cause pulpitis and the tooth becomes sensitive to cold.|$|E
5|$|G. Homer Durham, {{a member}} of the First Quorum of the Seventy, {{replaced}} Joseph Anderson as director of the Historical Department in 1977 and began restraining the History Division's activity. Durham required that all manuscripts go through him for approval before publication. He attempted to combine the Mormon History Trust Fund with the general department budget, but was prevented by Arrington. Durham also refrained from hiring new staff members to replace staff who had left. The multi-volume church history project was dropped, allowing the outside authors to seek publishers other than Deseret Book who would give them royalties and not be tempted to sanitize church history. Not all twelve authors completed their projects, but many books that started <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>History</b> Division project were later published through other publishers.|$|E
5|$|In 1963, Hogg {{purchased}} property near Round Top, {{hoping to}} move its historic building to Bayou Bend. When that plan proved impractical, she decided to restore it in place and temporarily moved to Round Top. After personally supervising {{the restoration of the}} Winedale Inn, a stagecoach inn near Round Top, Hogg donated the property to the University of Texas at Austin. Known as the Winedale Historical Center, it is used primarily as an outdoor museum and music center, and annually hosts Shakespeare at Winedale. In 1969, she restored her parents' house in Quitman; the town renamed it the Ima Hogg Museum in her honor. The museum holds items <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>history</b> of Wood County and northeast Texas. She later restored the home of her maternal grandfather and had it moved to the park.|$|E
