50|$|Djibouti has {{experienced}} stable {{economic growth in}} recent years as a result of achievements in macroeconomic adjustment efforts. Fiscal adjustment measures included downsizing the civil service, implementing a pension reform that placed the system on a much stronger financial footing, and strengthening public expenditure institutions. From 2003 to 2005, annual real GDP growth averaged 3.1 percent driven by good performance in the services sector and strong consumption. Inflation has been kept low (only 1 percent in 2004, compared with 2.2 percent in 2003), due to the fixed peg of the <b>Djibouti</b> <b>franc</b> to the US dollar. However, as mentioned above, unemployment has remained high at over 40 percent in recent years. Djibouti's gross domestic product expanded by an average of more than 6 percent per year, from US$341 million in 1985 to US$1.5 billion in 2015.|$|E

50|$|Estimates for FGM {{prevalence}} rate of FGM in Djibouti {{range from}} 93% to 98%. According to a UNICEF 2010 report, Djibouti has the world's second {{highest rate of}} Type III FGM, with about two thirds of all Djibouti women undergoing the procedure; Type I is the next {{most common form of}} female circumcision practiced in the country. Like its neighboring countries, a large percentage of women in Djibouti also undergo re-infibulation after birth or a divorce. Two thirds of the women claimed tradition and religion as the primary motivation for undergoing FGM. A predominantly Muslim country, Islamic clerics in Djibouti have been divided on the FGM issue, with some actively supporting the practice and others opposing it. FGM was outlawed in the country's revised Penal Code that went into effect in April 1995. Article 333 of the Penal Code provides that persons found guilty of this practice will face a five-year prison term and a fine of one million <b>Djibouti</b> <b>francs</b> (approximately US$5,600). <b>Djibouti</b> ratified the Maputo Protocol in 2005.|$|R
