They are somewhat shorter than Imperator cultivars, but more tolerant of <b>heavy</b> <b>soil</b> conditions. Danvers cultivars store well and are used both fresh and for processing. They were developed in 1871 in Danvers, Massachusetts. Cultivars include 'Danvers Half Long' and 'Danvers 126'.|$|E

25|$|According to the Herbarium of Western Australia’s records, {{there are}} 3,314 {{flowering}} plant species from 119 different families and over 4,200 different taxa (which includes undescribed species, subspecies, hybrids and varieties) recorded so far for the Great Western Woodlands. It {{is estimated that}} almost half of these species are endemic to the south west of Australia. This floristic diversity can be attributed {{in part to the}} wide range of habitats throughout the region, from <b>heavy</b> <b>soil</b> valley floors, to sandplain, salt lakes, granite hills, banded ironstone hills, greenstone belt mosaics and many others. Each of these environments provides the conditions for unique types of flora. The amount of plant diversity in the Great Western Woodlands is comparable to the plant diversity in Canada, a country more than 60 times the size of this region.|$|E
25|$|The {{share is}} {{the cutting edge}} of the {{moldboard}} plow. The share makes the horizontal cut that separates the furrow slice from the soil below and when it is worn it is important to fit a new one. Conventional shares have points that are shaped. This shape, which was developed through years of field experience, penetrates ordinary soil efficiently and stands rough use. The share is shaped so that it pulls itself into the ground. As the share wears away, it becomes blunt and the plough will require more power to pull it through the soil. A plough body with a worn share will not have enough 'suck' to ensure that it penetrates the ground to its full working depth. The tip of the share is pointed downward, causing the plow to run into the ground. This is called “suction or down suck”; it literally sucks the plow into the ground, to a regulated depth. The clearance, also usually referred to as “suction or down suck”, varies with different makes and types of plows (the related clearance at the side is called “land suck”). Its configuration is related to soil type, particularly in the down suction, or concavity, of its lower surface. Generally, three degrees of clearance or down suction are recognized: regular for light soil, deep for ordinary dry soil, and double-deep for clay and gravelly soils. In addition, the share has horizontal suction, which is related to the amount its point is bent out of line with the landside. Down suction causes the plow to penetrate to proper depth when pulled forward, while horizontal suction causes the plow to create the desired width of furrow. The share is a plane part with trapezoidal shape. It cuts the soil horizontally and lifts it. Common types are regular, winged-plane, bar-point, and share with mounted or welded point. The regular share conserves a good cut but is recommended on stone-free soils. The winged-plane share is used on <b>heavy</b> <b>soil</b> with a moderate amount of stones. The bar-point share can be used in extreme conditions (hard and stony soils). The use of the share with mounted point is somewhere between the last two types. Manufacturers have designed shares of various shapes (trapezium, diamond, etc.) with bolted point and wings, often separately renewable. Sometimes the share cutting edge is placed well in advance of the moldboard to reduce the pulverizing action of the soil.|$|E

2500|$|This {{variety is}} a popular garden plant, and is grown under {{a wide range of}} {{conditions}} in eastern Australia. Its behaviour is difficult to predict, as it varies greatly with provenance and growing conditions. In general, it grows slowly, taking up to eight years to flower from seed.

2500|$|The Groningen {{horse was}} {{originally}} bred in the Groningen {{region of the}} Netherlands to perform agricultural work in the <b>heavy</b> <b>soil.</b> They were influenced by the other heavy warmblood breeds of Frisia: Ostfriesen, Oldenburgers, and Holsteiners. From 1897 to 1942 they were managed by the Gronings Paardenstamboek ("Groninger Studbook" [...] abbreviated GrPs), after which time they were united with the rather lighter Ostfriesen in the North-Netherlands Warmblood Horse Studbook (NWP). In 1969 the NWP merged with the Gelderlander breeding society to form the KWPN, or Royal Warmblood Horse Studbook of the Netherlands. Dutch horses would thenceforth be bred as competitive riding or driving horses.|$|E

50|$|Cosolvent {{systems are}} used for heavy oils, waxes, greases, waxes and fingerprints, and can remove <b>heavier</b> <b>soils</b> than {{processes}} that use pure or azeotropic solvents.

2500|$|The {{most famous}} of the heavy warmbloods was the Oldenburg. Today's Oldenburg is bred for sport, and so the old type is {{designated}} as such: Alt-Oldenburger. The history of the Oldenburg is almost indistinguishable from that of horses bred in nearby East Frisia. Though there are two names (Old-Oldenburg and East Friesian), the horse is quite the same, having always exchanged genetic material. The plow horses of the Frisian marshes had to be powerful {{to work through the}} <b>heavy</b> <b>soil,</b> and so were significantly heavier than farm horses in other parts of Europe. Organized horse breeding began in Oldenburg under Count Anton Günther (1603–1667), who brought popular stallions from Spain, Italy, Turkey, and Poland. Later on, Cleveland Bays were introduced as well, and the result was a solid, good-natured mare base from which came the Karossier.|$|E
