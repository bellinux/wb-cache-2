5|$|Despite {{what was}} {{initially}} {{expected to be}} a heated race, Gillibrand easily prevailed against <b>former</b> <b>Republican</b> congressman Joseph DioGuardi in her first statewide election. By the end of October, a Quinnipiac University Polling Institute poll showed Gillibrand winning 57-34%. Gillibrand won the November election 63–35%, carrying 54 of New York's 62 counties; the counties that supported DioGuardi did so by a margin no greater than 10%.|$|E
5|$|Johnson ran {{again in}} 2016, once again winning the Libertarian {{nomination}} and naming <b>former</b> <b>Republican</b> Governor of Massachusetts William Weld {{as his running}} mate. Johnson received 4.4 million votes (roughly 3.3% of the total vote), which is most for a third party presidential candidate since 1996 and the highest national vote share for a Libertarian candidate in history.|$|E

25|$|The Daisy {{became a}} single party in February 2002. It {{was set up}} by former left-leaning Christian Democrats, centrists, social-liberals (former Liberals and <b>former</b> <b>Republicans),</b> as well as other left-wing {{politicians}} from the former Italian Socialist Party and Federation of the Greens.|$|R
50|$|NARAL is a {{non-profit}} organization, and has approximately 20 state affiliates. NARAL and its affiliates {{have been criticized}} by some other pro-choice political activists, both for supporting pro-choice <b>former</b> <b>Republicans</b> Lincoln Chafee and Michael Bloomberg and for supporting moderate or conservative Democrats.|$|R
5|$|According to Meintjes, Kruger {{was still}} not {{particularly}} anti-British; he thought the British {{had made a mistake}} and would rectify the situation if this could be proven to them. After conducting a poll through the <b>former</b> <b>republican</b> infrastructure—587 signed in favour of the annexation, 6,591 against—he organised a second deputation to London, made up of himself and Joubert with Bok again serving as secretary. The envoys met the British High Commissioner in Cape Town, Sir Bartle Frere, and arrived in London on 29 June 1878 to find a censorious letter from Shepstone waiting for them, along with a communication that since Kruger was agitating against the government he had been dismissed from the executive council.|$|E
5|$|Willson further alienated the {{legislature}} by issuing pardons for several individuals convicted of {{complicity in the}} assassination of Governor William Goebel (1900). These included <b>former</b> <b>Republican</b> governor William S. Taylor (18991900) and Taylor's Secretary of State, Caleb Powers. Henry Youtsey, who was convicted for complicity in the assassination but turned state's evidence, was not pardoned, leading Democrats to portray the pardons of Taylor and Powers as partisan. Goebel's likeness was also removed from state checks and documents {{and was replaced by}} likenesses of either Abraham Lincoln, Henry Clay, or John C. Breckinridge.|$|E
5|$|Combs {{began his}} {{political}} career with his election {{to the office of}} city attorney in Prestonsburg in 1950. Later that year, Governor Lawrence Wetherby appointed him to fill a vacancy in the office of Commonwealth's Attorney for Kentucky's 31st Judicial District. Combs announced, however, that he would serve only until a new election could be held. In April 1951, Governor Wetherby appointed Combs to fill a vacancy on the Kentucky Court of Appeals caused by the death of Judge Roy Helm. Later that year, he sought a full eight-year term on the court. His opponent was Simeon S. Willis, a popular <b>former</b> <b>Republican</b> governor who had previously sat on the court. Combs won the election by a vote of 73,298 to 69,379. In George Robinson's oral history, Combs attributed his victory to Willis's advanced age (68) and {{the fact that many of}} Willis' supporters assumed that their candidate would win and did not vote.|$|E

It {{was set up}} by former left-leaning Christian Democrats, centrists, social-liberals (former Liberals and <b>former</b> <b>Republicans),</b> as well as other left-wing {{politicians}} from the former Italian Socialist Party and Federation of the Greens.|$|R

50|$|It was {{composed}} basically of former Liberals and Radicals, {{and also of}} some <b>former</b> <b>Republicans</b> and Socialists. Most of them came from Forza Italia, the party which has been home of most Italian liberals since 1994, and by its liberal factions, notably Popular Liberalism and Liberal Reformers.|$|R
5|$|In January 2000, Ferraro and Lynn Martin—a <b>former</b> <b>Republican</b> Congresswoman and U.S. Secretary of Labor who {{had played}} Ferraro in George H. W. Bush's debate {{preparations}} in 1984—co-founded, and served as co-presidents of, G Strategies, a management consulting firm underneath Weber McGinn. Its goal was to advise corporations on how to develop more women leaders and make their workplaces more amenable to female employees. G Strategies subsequently became part of Golin Harris International. In , Ferraro was made {{executive vice president and}} managing director of the public affairs practice of the Global Consulting Group, an international investor relations and corporate communications component of Huntsworth. There she worked with corporations, non-profit organizations, state governments and political figures. She continued there as a senior advisor working about two days a month.|$|E
5|$|On May 9, 1921, {{striking}} of the Morgan dollar resumed at the Philadelphia Mint {{under the}} recoinage {{called for by}} the Pittman Act. The same day, Congressman Vestal introduced the Peace dollar authorization bill as a joint resolution. Vestal placed his bill on the Unanimous Consent Calendar, but Congress adjourned for a lengthy recess without taking any action. When Congress returned, Vestal asked for unanimous consent that the bill pass on August 1, 1921. However, one representative, <b>former</b> <b>Republican</b> leader James R. Mann (Illinois) objected, and numismatic historian Roger Burdette suggests that Mann's stature in the House ensured that the bill would not pass. Nevertheless, Vestal met with the ANA {{and told them that}} he hoped Congress would reconsider when it met again in December 1921.|$|E
5|$|Other {{candidates}} in the Democratic field included sitting lieutenant governor Thelma Stovall, Terry McBrayer (the choice of sitting governor Julian Carroll), congressman Carroll Hubbard, state auditor George Adkins, and Louisville mayor Harvey Sloane. Initially the leading candidate, Stovall was hampered during the campaign by ill health. During the campaign, Brown was attacked by McBrayer for refusing to release his federal tax returns. McBrayer also claimed that Brown had not voted in a Democratic primary since 1975, a charge validated by public voting records. Nevertheless, Brown won the primary {{by a margin of}} 25,000 votes. The race was so close that Sloane, Brown's closest competitor, refused to concede for two days. Brown defeated <b>former</b> <b>Republican</b> governor Louie B. Nunn in the 1979 general election by a vote of 554,083 to 376,809.|$|E

5|$|The 1960s {{were less}} {{successful}} for the club, with Real Madrid monopolising La Liga. The {{completion of the}} Camp Nou, finished in 1957, meant the club had little {{money to spend on}} new players. The 1960s saw the emergence of Josep Maria Fusté and Carles Rexach, and the club won the Copa del Generalísimo in 1963 and the Fairs Cup in 1966. Barcelona restored some pride by beating Real Madrid 1–0 in the 1968 Copa del Generalísimo final at the Santiago Bernabéu in front of Francisco Franco, with coach Salvador Artigas, a <b>former</b> <b>republican</b> pilot in the Civil War. With the end of Franco's dictatorship in 1974, the club changed its official name back to Futbol Club Barcelona and reverted the crest to its original design, including the original letters once again.|$|E
5|$|Despite having {{previously}} {{shown little}} inclination toward politics, Brown surprised political observers by declaring his candidacy {{for governor in}} 1979. With the state and nation facing difficult economic times, Brown promised to run the state government like a business. A strong media campaign funded by his personal fortune allowed him to win the Democratic primary {{and go on to}} defeat <b>former</b> <b>Republican</b> governor Louie B. Nunn in the general election. Because he owed few favors to established political leaders, he appointed many successful businesspeople to state posts instead of making political appointments. Following through on his campaign promise to make more diverse appointments, he named a woman and an African-American to his cabinet. During his tenure, Brown exerted less influence over the legislature than previous governors and was frequently absent from the state, leaving lieutenant governor Martha Layne Collins as acting governor for more than one quarter of his term. He briefly considered a run for the U.S. Senate after his gubernatorial term, but withdrew from the race after only three weeks, citing health issues. He has continued to invest in business ventures, the most high profile of which was Kenny Rogers Roasters, a wood-roasted chicken restaurant he founded with country music star Kenny Rogers.|$|E
